I used Sam Adams beer for these meatballs.  I baked them, then cooked the recipe in a crockpot for three hours.  Great aroma, and super taste.  I used them for meatball heros.  Dyn-O-mite.

We didn't enjoy these at all--they left a horrible smell and a horrible taste.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I thought it would be perfect for all the beer lovers in the family but it was NOT a big hit. We threw the leftovers out which is a bummer after making the meatballs from scratch.  The meatballs are good, the sauce is not.  Did not smell good cooking at all.  You're better off making the meatballs and just using a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.

Beer and Ketchup. Hummm....I have played around with this recipe a few times. As written, I don't like it. Onion and garlic make great meatballs, but if you change the chopped oinion to minced onion, and change the garlic powder to minced garlic, you have a very tasty meatball. The sauce is watery, and kinda smells bad. This could be the basis for a good recipe, but as written, not so good.

I used my own meatball recipe because what this recipe called for was extremely bland.  I found the ketchup and beer sauce to be much too sweet, to the point where it was inedible.  While cooking, it produced a disgusting smell that made me nauseous.  All these things combined, I simply could not enjoy the sauce and ended up eating the meatballs separately.  I would not recommend this recipe.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe, and I make it frequently.  My mom (who likes spicy food) uses the hot ketchup instead of regular.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent recipe, my husband loved these meat balls. I did add an egg to the recipe to hold the meat together. Worked well.

To make them even easier, I throw a bag of small, frozen Italian style meatballs in the slow cooker, then the beer (O'Douls for us) and ketchup, and voila! My family loves these meatballs as appetizers, party food, or even over rice as a meal! :-)

I added egg and some bread crumbs to the meatballs.  For the sauce, it seemed off, so I used 16oz. beer and then ketchup and BBQ sauce.  The sauce turned out thicker and had a better flavor.

For the people that didn't like this, I really wonder what kind of beer you used.  Some beer is just not made for cooking.  I never use anything but Grain Belt, the original light beer.  Also some ketchups are sweet, (or too sweet).  I prefer a lighter bar-b-q sauce.  I can't handle the hot one's.  I take these to parties quite often, and everybody seems to like them.  I always have an empty dish when I leave.

3 stars because personally to me it was not to my liking. It all smelled delicious if a bit strong. But the sauce ruined it for me. There was three of us there, One loved it, the other wasn't impressed but didn't dislike it. We're gonna play with the recipe a bit but I think I would suggest spicing up the balls and lessening the liquid with the sauce and adding something else to it because one bite made the nerves in my jaw SCREAM. Made really good leftovers when I mixed it with some rice and less sauce.

My family enjoyed these meatballs, but only after I made some changes to the recipe.  One, the meatballs themselves need some seasoning; at the very least salt and pepper.  Second, I added soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper to the sauce.  Without the additions, I seriously doubt that we would have liked it.  It smelled yummy and tasted as good as it smelled!

I am going to try this one as written, cause I never met a meatball  Big , Small , Appetizer or Main Course that I didn't like. Sounds like a quick fixer for an Appetizer. I have had good luck with Heinz Chili Sauce and Grape Jelly. 1 Bottle Chili Sauce and 1/2 C. Grape Jelly in saucepan heat till combined pour over meatballs in Slow Cooker. Cook high for 4 hours. Unlike the other comment made about reheated makes them taste worse, with these they are better. Meatballs Rock.

I made this recipe exactly as-is.  It was very tasty as it was served.  Not great reheated - but that is pretty typical for meatballs.  My only complaint is that my sauce did not thicken up enough - I think we could have used a little less beer.

What a great recipe!  It smelled so good while it was simmering I couldn't wait to try them.  The meatballs soaked up just enough of the beer taste to make them absolutely delicious!!

Not very good.  Took it to a party - 1 person loved it - everyone else said it was "ok".  Sauce only thickened to tomato soup consistancy after 4 1/2 hours.  I even added cornstarch but it was still runny.  The meatballs need something - I would suggest using some chives, parsley, or oregano.

I was pressed for time to go to a reunion. I improvised with Farm Rich soy meatballs. I used Samuel Adams Octoberfest beer 2-12 oz bottles. I also used a 32 oz bottle of Hunts ketchup.
I had about 10 meatballs left after the reuion.

WOW!  We had so much fun making this!  My 7 year old got into making the meatballs.  The house smelled so so good.  I had a few complaints that it was bland, but the kids thought it was BBQ.  I think maybe next time I will add a tablespoon or two of Marion Kay's BBQ seasoning and see how it turns out.

I took off a star because I think 2 bottles of beer would be far too watery, and I think the meatballs need jazz.  However, with one bottle of beer and my own meatball recipe (which has more spices than this one), this was excellent.

This was not good at all.  I'm giving it one star because I have to give it a star to rate it! I followed the directions exactly and was very disappointed to have wasted all that meat...especially since meat is pricey these days.  I would definitely try a different recipe if you're in the mood for meatballs!!!  But, I do realize everyone has different tastes...

I did alot of changes to the meatballs in this recipe, but kept the  other ingredients the same. I found the sauce way to watery. I only had 1 of 4 kids who liked it. I found it uninspiring at best.

I agree w the other reviewers on the sauce.  As it turned out, I only had a 20oz bottle of catsup, so added 8 oz of hot picante sauce to make up for it, and even then the catsup made the sauce way too sweet.  Shoulda just thrown a jar of Ragu in the crockpot!  Or added more beer!!

Meat balls were a little dry and sauce wasn't anything I would make again.  I did use half ketchup half bbq sauce.

This recipe was awful.To start off, I had used chili sauce instead of ketchup, thinking it would add extra zip. THEN, I read the bad reviews after I had already started making this and applied some of the suggested changes. I added salt in pepper to the meatballs (altough atfter I had already rolled the balls) and then added BBQ sauce to the sauce. But they still came out with an OVERWHELMING beer taste. That's all we could taste. It was a huge disappointment to bring these to our superbowl party.

This recipe was not to our taste but some people might like it.  It would make a better appetizer than a meal.

I followed recipe as listed.  It is very easy, however, I didn't care for the meatballs themselves.  The sauce turned out okay, but did not thicken up too much.  If you try this recipe I would suggest using fresh minced garlic instead of powder and may decrease the amount of beer.

I have made this or a similar recipe for years. Instead of cooking them in the oven, I brown them in a skillet.  You can also substitute ground turkey for the ground beef. If you are in a rush, you can purchase pre-made meatballs. Don’t be afraid to experiment with this base recipe. It is a great recipe, but just put your personal touch on it.

I used bud light and the sauce was a little bland.  I added some garlic and Italian seasoning at the end of the cooking process and the sauce came out great.  I had to thicken with cornstarch near the end of the cooking process but this was still a pretty good recipe.
