We liked this recipe. I used prepared basil pesto instead of making my own so it was quick and you can easily adjust to taste. A little salt and pepper. Colourful side-dish.

It was good, but not something we'd repeat often. A lot of effort and not enough bang for the palate buck.

Easy and tasty. I used partially dried herbs and it came out fine. I am sure it would be even better with fresh
