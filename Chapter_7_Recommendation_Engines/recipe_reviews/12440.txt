Great,  easy recipe - especially for a novice pie maker!!  Mine, too, though ended up being very crumbly in the bowl - no ball shape here.  I fixed that,  though, by scraping all the crumbles into a ziploc bag and then forming it into a ball -- super results and little mess that way, too.  Put the Ziploc in the freezer for about an hour and then rolled it out b/t sheets of wax paper like I remember Mom doing........makes the transfer to the Pie pan easy, too.  Lots of little tips here - but I am an "ease" baker!!

I've used this recipe three times now, the first time I had no experience making pie crusts whatsoever. This recipe is GREAT!!! After the crust is cooked it is so crumbly it seems to just melt in your mouth! I used this recipe with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie, that's also on this website, and it is an amazing combination! Although, at first, I too had problems with the crust being too crumbly, but I found out that all you have to do is mix in the Crisco (I use butter flavored Crisco as well) a bit and then shake shake SHAKE! If you don't shake it long or fast enough, for whatever reason, it won't turn out how it's supposed to. I actually get quite a workout when I shake mine. ^_^

Flaky and delicious!  I used stick butter shortening...and after the shaking, ended up with about 15 varying sizes of shortening balls.  I suppose I needed to keep the shortening in one clump rather than cut it up...I'll try it next time. I still had to use my hands to bring it all together, but that wasn't a problem...it was easy to make, easy to work with, and tasted wonderful!  I used it with "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" from this site and it was great! Thanks!

i used this mixing method with my favorite old crust recipe, was easy and great! i always hated to mix piecrust before... some who have had problems with it might try adding a BIT of water to help form balls.

Okay, maybe since this is my first homemade pie crust, I did something wrong, judging from all the good reviews.  But I shook and I shook and it was still super-crumbly and I had to form a ball with my hands.  I refrigerated it while I made my filling, but it was still too crumbly to roll.  So I formed it into the pan with my hands.  I was surprised that once it was baked, the pie crust was very yummy.  It had a buttery-flavor, because I used butter flavored Crisco.  Maybe I will give this one another chance.

This pie crust was very easy to make.  I did not shake it like recipe stated because of all the other reviews i read about it not forming into a ball.  I instead mixed it with my hands and did not have the problem.  I put it in the freezer for maybe 20 minutes while mixing the glaze for my pie.  I rolled it out for the latice cover to my apple pie.  It turned out excellently!!!!

I was very nervous about trying this.  I have only made one other pie crust and it was diasterous! This recipe was very easy and made a wonderful flaky crust!  I did not separate it into two balls.  I made a thick crust and it turned out beautiful!

Use a larger sized Glad or Ziploc or Tupperware container instead of a bowl. If it isn't in one big ball, you need to shake more!! :)

I made this today and it was soooo good!!!  I used a clear bowl so I could see what was going on!!  At first it was balling up but still a lot of flour rolling around.  I looked at the recipe again and realized I did not put the water in!!  After I put the water in, I proceed to shake the ball and it worked!!!  I used this crust with Gramma Opels Apple Pie recipe from this site.  My husband said "this is the best one yet"!!! I did use the butter flavored shortening as suggested by others and the crust turned out wonderful and so easy to make with no mess!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe Esther!!!

I love this recipe.  I used lard (I don't usually, but that's what I had on hand today) I thought it was so great!!  I did have to add a little more flour and water, but it did turn into a ball as it said it would.  I made it for the wonderful Apple Pie By Gramdma Ople.  We haven't had it yet but it looks GREAT!!  I highly recommend trying this pie crust and maybe add a little more water if it doesn't form a ball for you. I will use this recipe/method again!!  Thank you.

WHILE GOOD IN THEORY....I'VE MADE THIS RECIPE A FEW TIMES AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER HOW I DO IT, IT JUST DOESN'T MIX UP THE WAY IT SHOULD. ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL, I'LL TRY ANYTHING.

This is an awesome pie crust.  So I like butter, so use it in place of shortening.  But I have a cheater secret. I melt the butter in my mixing container, then add the ingredients according to the recipe.  Then I roll it out a bit, fold it over side to side, end to end, roll, fold, roll fold. This process creates layers thereby making the crust very flaky. I then put it into the freezer to harden the butter, which creates air pockets where the water in the butter evaporates while cooking and leaves these wonderful flakes. I just used this to cover a chicken pot pie recipe from this site. Let's just say it was to die for. Best I've ever made and my family loved it.  I have also used it for quiche, and fruit pie. I have added herbs to the quiche, like italian seasoning, garlic, added sugar and/or cinnamon for the fruit pies. Hope these ideas were helpful and or inspiring.  Yum, Yum, Yum
If you are having trouble getting it to form a ball, just add a tad more water. Altitude effects dough making, so a bit extra flour if it's too moist, or a tad more water if it's too crumbly is what will make it just right.

Good tender, flaky crust.  I had a little difficulty in getting it to form a ball, and I didn't make much time to chill it so it was a little sticky through the rolling, but I stuck with it.  So glad I did!  The end result in my cherry pie was fantastic, flaky and tender, and melts in your mouth.  Well worth the effort!

This pie crust tasted good but the method of shaking was a bit of a pain.  I ended up mixing it with a fork, which is why I rated it lower.

since i don't have a bowl with a tight lid, i put all ingredients in a large ziplock bag... yep i really did. and shook it up like crazy and it didn't ball up.  some of it stuck to the sides.  I put most of it on a piece of wax paper, scraped the rest off the sides of the plastic bag, took some loose flour and formed to balls. i wrapped them in wax paper and stuck them in the fridge while i made the filling.  after baking, the crust was light and flakey.  the zip lock bag method worked great for me!  the only thing i would change is that i needed about 1/4 c of extra flour because the dough came out quite wet from the bag.

This was a total surprise to me...I thought I had used every recipe and trick for pie crust "in the book"...I was all set to use my old "tried and true" if it didn't...But now I HAVE seen everything...This REALLY works ! ! !  KUDOS!!!  It was so easy...the only mess is in a bowl.  The resulting crust was tender and flaky...Wonderful in BOTH one and two crust pies, fruit and cream,
Perfect for my Pecan Pie...I just kept shaking all evening...turned out 24 6-inch pies in one evening...thanks.

I always use this recipe because it is super flaky and tasty, as well as very forgiving. Keep in mind it is very crumbly, rolling it out between plastic wrap helps.

The way I see it, you definitely need to add more water. At least double. It still won't be a solid ball but it'll be good enough to work with. My bottom crust wasn't one solid piece, but once it baked you couldn't tell and it tasted great. My dad said it was the best crust he'd ever tasted, and that's high praise.

I used this with the Grandma Ople's Apple pie recipe and it came out amazing, according to friends. However i experienced a couple issues. I had prepared the dough saturday morning chilled and used it sunday night. It was quite difficult transfering without it breaking especially when it came to making the lattice crust. Any suggestions please? I would love to make the lattice crust for thanksgiving.

As another user mentioned, i decided to try this crust with grandma ople's apple pie recipe. It was absolutely amazing! Though i didn't get a ball after shaking the bowl for about a minute, i ended it by hand without a problem. Totally a keeper!

I was skeptical about this recipe, it sounded far to simple. I tried it tonight, it mixed up perfectly! I put it in the freezer while I was preparing the apple pie filling. After tasting the pie, I literally threw out all my other pie crust recipes! Simply amazing!

It was easy enough, but just didn't taste as good as I thought it might.

Eventhough this recipe is "clean" it comes out horrable if it comes out at all. Will not be trying this one again.

Mixing this by shaking did indeed work, and was amusing to boot!  Rolling the dough out, however wasn't nearly as easy or amusing.  Perhaps more time chilling would have helped.

The shaking part in the bowl doesn't always work well but it has a great taste and it's easy !
