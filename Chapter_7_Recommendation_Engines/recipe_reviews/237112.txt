Okay so this didn't turn out yellow for me but what it did turn out was delicious. I used it with shrimp but it would be good on any protein. The only one thing I will do differently the next time I make this is to cut back on the sugar but that is it.

i used about a tablespoon of sriracha in place of cayenne tomato paste and garlic. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white. turned out great!
