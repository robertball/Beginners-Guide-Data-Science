I made this as directed. I had a hard time getting the dough to rise, and next time I plan on using three packets of yeast. This is a large volume recipe. It made 7 small loaves to give away for Christmas this year. My husband, from Hamburg, approves the German quality of this Christmas bread.  It's not too sweet. I haven't aged it yet, but it tastes like a perfect breakfast bread. Use unsalted butter!

This bread is a family recipe. We have ancestors that were German Swiss. I remember eating this with butter and dippng it in coffee. Coffee really brings a good flavor.
