Best salad I’ve made in a while! I used “Middle Eastern Couscous Triknoa”. I have no idea if that is the correct kind, but, it looks similar and tasted great!

Thought this was  easy, delicious and interesting! Swapped walnuts for almonds and at least doubled the spinach.....oh, and failing to find Israeli couscous, it was perfectly delicious although possibly less beautiful with regular.  Serves 6-8 easy.
Plan to try leftover mixture on fresh spinach again tomorrow to see if it’s just as yummy!

No I didn’t make any changes. However, I will not make it again. Too much work for a flavor that was just blah.
