This is great but I added about 2 tsps of italian seasoning, added salt, and added 1/2 can of tomato sauce, then eliminated the onion soup mix.

Tried this out since we had nothing in the house but pasta and frozen meatballs (I really need to go shopping soon), and I wanted a variation from the standard spaghetti and meatballs.  SO GOOD!  

Skipped the mushrooms (we don't like mushrooms), and added crushed red pepper during the boiling water phase.  Also sprinkled some fried onion straws, for some crunch, and shredded cheese on to each helping.  My family loved this meal!

Absolutely delicious, halved the recipe for my wife and I.  Left out the mushrooms and used tomato paste instead of a can of tomatoes(our preference).  My wife, who doesn't like meatballs or tomatoes went back for seconds.  Next time I will try adding green beans.

I made this soup exactly as called for in the recipe. My husband isn't a big "soup" fan so I thought I might not have a hit here. However with the pasta making it less soupy, it turned out really well. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I'll be making it again. Especially if you buy that big meatball bag from Costco and need somehow to use them up!

On the plus side, this recipe is easy to put together.  On the minus side, the taste is only average.

Needed a recipe that called for lots of meatballs (that's all the protein I could find in my freezer).  This recipe was perfect.  My 3 children and husband loved it especially because it was such a cold evening.  I always ask 'how many stars' and they gave it 4 (basically that means I will make it again but need a few weeks in between).  Thank you for the recipe.

I needed a quick dinner tonight.  My husband wasn't impressed with this so I won't be making it again.  I liked it more than hubby did.

This was just ok, nothing special, lacking in flavor for me.

This was delicious!! Definitely a mixture between and soup and a stew! I added an extra cup of water, mixed with a little beef bouillon for extra flavour, plus fresh green beans and baby spinach for added veggies!! I will absolutely be making this again! :)

I went ahead and gave this one 5 stars, but would have given if 4 and a half if I could have just because of the need to adjust the amount of liquid.  I added an additional 2 cups of water and when making again will probably add a total of 4 extra cups.  That being said, this is GREAT!  Good flavor, easy to make, loved it!
