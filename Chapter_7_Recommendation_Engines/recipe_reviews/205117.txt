these were awesome i made them for sunday night football, the store was out of the choco bars, for a bar pan of 9x13 it took about two bags of cookie chips. I did half milk chocolate and the other half the reeses peanut butter and they turned out great i actually like the pb ones better.  will make again

Oh my goodness these were a hit at a family bday party. The kids ran over to the pan after eating their meal and dove in. They all said they were so good. I will make these again. The only thing I had to do different is use Pure Vanilla extract. Don't know where to find the other extract. We live in rural Illinois not to many choices to shop. YUMMY even my brother loved them and he is very picky.

I don't understand the bad reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it was fine. It got rave reviews when taken to a holiday treat table at work. Gave a pan to all of my family (7 siblings) for christmas with the pan. They love them, I've been told they are addicting and have been made numerous times by some of my siblings. Shrug. They loved it, the bars set up after being allowed to cool. I did not find the syrup to be an issue or the time it took to make it. Nothing stuck to the pan. I used non stick pans and sprayed liberally with PAM. Came out like the recipe states and looks like the photo shown. Thanks for sharing this recipe here!!!

These were out of this world! Just butter the pan good, they will come out. They are worth the struggle of a little sticking. YUM.

This recipe was very easy and came out perfect, I even surprised myself after reading a bad review I was a little hesitant!! But my son is a s'more lover so I thought I give it a shot, and they came out beautifully and looked EXACTLY as they do on their pictures, I will definitely make them again!

This recipe is a disaster!I followed the directions precisely---including putting it in a well greased pan---Now that it has cooled, it is *bonded* to the pan! Unbelievable! So now I have to make something else for the bake sale, and I am out a pan, because that stuff is never coming out!  edited to add---I was able to salvage 12 squares out of this recipe and wash the pan with a huge amount of effort! They really stuck to the bottom! They were sweet but tasty. I wouldn't make they again though, way too much work to cut the bars!

These taste like s'mores but you'd be better off just making s'mores. This recipe takes longer to prepare, costs more, is just as messy, and basically impossible to get out of the pan!

A very rich dessert.  You definitely have to wait for it to cool before cutting or serving or it's a major disaster.

Tastes identical to s'Mores on a fire. I would suggest to make this for a big crowd as my family wasted more than half of it because we were tired of s'Mores.

These came out pretty good.  Not the favorite, but still good.  Hubby said they tasted more like a cereal bar than S'more's, so perhaps the title is a little misleading.  Pretty easy to make, and fun to eat.

These were good, and so easy to make.  I poured a little chocolate syrup over the marshmallows after baking instead of the mini chocolate chips, then I refrigerated it-they really need to cool at least an hour, as it says in the recipe, before you try eating them.  Take it from me-I couldn't wait, and my piece fell apart.  Once cooled though, they stay together.  Taste just like s'mores!

I gave it three stars because I took the average from votes in my family.  My youngest absolutely loved it, my other kids liked it as did my husband, but no rave reviews.  Super rich is what I heard the most.  Also, it was a beast to get out of the pan after I refrigerated it for an hour.  I greased the pan with Crisco too.  I would grease and use parchment paper and grease the parchment paper as well if I make again.  Also recipe doesn't specify what kind if mini chocolate chips.  My store only carried semi-sweet which was cool with me.

Awesome! Didn't have chocolate bars, used milk chocolate chips instead. Turned out great - kids and adults loved them!

I wasn't sure how I'd like these but they were delicious.  I used the equivalent amount of milk chocolate chips in place of the bars.  Also found they last pretty well for a bit longer than 2 days.  Will likely make again.

My advice: Do NOT over bake this! The marshmallows would not brown enough- who likes anemic-looking roasted marshmallows?! I kept an eye on the marshmallows while baking it a couple more minutes, then a couple more, etc. until they looked like roasted mallows. They cooled in the fridge, as per instructions, then I took it to the party in the dish, uncut. That's when I discovered I should have brought a clean chisel- ugh. ?? The corn syrup in the crust melded to the dish. People scraped the topping off. Next time, if the marshmallows are too pale, I will turn the broiler on for a minute or two after baking. I bet this would've been delicious, if I hadn't ruined it. I will try again, since I now have a big box of Rice Krispies and graham crackers.

These were tasty but the crust was really hard. My recommendation is to make the crust like a 7 layer bar, 1 1/2 package of graham crackers with a stick of butter melted on the bottom and then put the bottom. Also, I used milk chocolate chips to go with the Hershey bars.

Very easy to make. Had no trouble following the recipe. The hardest part was waiting on them to set up, an when they did they didn't last long. Thanks

My family loved these.  They were extremely easy and fast to make and they were just like smores but better.  They have all the same flavors as smores but a little sweeter and the texture is chewy and much easier to eat!  I followed the recipe to a "t" except I wasn't sure exactly how much graham crackers to use because each brand has a little differnt size crackers so I just measured 2 cups of crushed grahams.  I also cooked mine for the entire 8 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Also, if you are looking to cool them down quicker than an hour in the fridge, you can do what I did and give them a 15-20 minute ice bath.  I just fill my kitchen sink with 1-2" of ice water and it chills them very quickly.  If you like smores then you will love these.  They are kind of addicting...
