This was a very good patato salad.  I've never tried it hot before.  Just a suggestion...use red potatoes because they don't fall apart as easily as brown potatoes.  It still tastes good when the potatoes are crumbled put if you're looking for presentation points I'd use red!!

Super!!!!  I am just getting around to rating this and thank you submitter.  I have served this many, many times and there is never enough.  Currently it's my favorite item to bring to parties.  I do add more bacon (because we love bacon) and I make more sauce than called for but no one can go wrong with your directions.  Thanks again.

My dad was saying it's been years since he had German potato salad and he really missed it,so I thought I would try my hand at this and surprise him. Wow! Was it good! I boiled my potatoes with skin on,and peeled and sliced when they cooled down a bit(much easier.) I used less potatoes than called for, 8oz. package of bacon,3/4 cup onion and doubled the rest. I like lots of sauce so I gradually added my potatoes to my liking,you can use leftovers for hash browns. Thanks Tequila!

Delicious! I'm a big fan of German potato salad, and this one certainly didn't disappoint. What's great is the addition of the celery seed, gives it a tiny little crunch but a ton of flavor. I always use cider vinegar rather than white but don't know if that makes a huge taste difference...maybe a bit mellower. I quartered the potatoes to cook them, then made it easy on myself and sliced them with an egg slicer. Perfect size. Also, just before serving, I topped it with a handful of minced fresh parsley which gave it a wonderful fresh flavor boost. This was a great side to my grilled brats from the German butcher. Thanks, Tequila!

This is exactly the same as the handwritten recipe I received from my German born grandmother 30 years ago before she passed away. She had made notes on it about the ingredients (ie: use approx. 3 pounds of potatoes, cider vinegar not white, a bit more bacon if available, boil potatoes whole and slice, use red potatoes, use a bit of brown sugar). She added more liquid (if it was too thick) more vinegar (if it wasn't tart enough), etc. She always made adjustments according to the circumstances. I have added my own twists - like a pinch of dry mustard for a tiny bite and stirred in chopped chives or scallions at the end for a burst of flavor. Her final note was " start here for good potato salad." It has all the basics you need to make a great Hot German Potato salad - so this is indeed - a good place to start.

Excellent! Very good my husband loved it, though it needs to be a ,little clearer on what sized potatoes I used pretty large ones not thinking it would be too much next time I will use smaller potatoes.Thanks for sharing!

This is a mediocre recipe; it would serve as a good base to try, then alter to your own liking.  I found the proportions to be off. The "dressing" made by this recipe was enough for 6 medium sized potatoes (not 9). As a result, the salad was enough for about 7 or 8 conservative servings (not 12).  I was surprised to see that one reviewer suggested using less vinegar. I thought the salad was rather bland and needed 2-4 more tablespoons of vinegar (I like a German potato salad that makes you pucker!).  Not a complete loss, but not the 5-star recipe I was hoping for.

Just like Mom used to make when I was a kid, because my father wouldn't allow "that mayonnaise abomination in the house".

I left out the flower because I have a wheat allergy and it came out just great, the trick was letting it sit on the stove for about a half hour after I mixed everything together, and letting the potatoes soak up all the flavor.  I cubed it instead of sliced the potatoes because that's what I am used to, and I was searching for a recipe like my mom used to make.  This is the real deal, and got the thumbs up from central texas Germans at my Oktoberfest party.  Thanks!

This recipe duplicates that delicious potato salad you can usually only get in German restaurants.  I loved it and have already made it three times.  It goes well with anything, from burgers to bratwurst.

I really love potato salads, but can't seem to get over the hang up of "warm" potato salads.  I grew up on the old fashioned refrigerated kind... and you would think I'd be open to other variations. I love the sweet / tart combination, but wondering how this would be served cold?  (hahaha, I guess I'm doomed.) I'm gonna keeping trying.  Thanks Tequila.

This is an excellent dish. I loved it and so did my guests. I served this as part of a German meal for an Oktoberfest party I had for family and friends. I did as another reviewer suggested and used 5 pounds of red potatoes, 1 pound of bacon and doubled everything else, including the vinegar. I definately used cider vinegar. I followed the instructions for preparation and then dumped everything into a crockpot that I set on warm. Every bit was delicious and it served 15 people, including 4 teenage boys, with just enough left over for me to eat for lunch the next day.

Let me tell ya, I remember having to eat this stuff as a kid, and hating it....funny how your taste buds change as an adult. I had never made this before, but remember my Mother making it... I wasn't sure that I was on key until I made the sauce and it turned opaque..... then I knew, I had a winner. My Dad is coming for dinner tomorrow, and hasn't eaten this since my Mother passed away 11 years ago.... my eternal gratitude for a long lost recipe that Mom never wrote down!

I doubled this recipe and it came out just fine.  One thing the directions didn't mention was that this potato salad actually improves with age.  I know its suppose to be eaten while warm, but the potatoes actually soak up the flavor of the dressing if you let them sit 30 minutes.  If you try it and the taste has too much of a bite for you, give it some time to mellow.  A great recipe hot or cold!

Had some friends over at the last minute for Brats on the grill.  This was a great side dish! I peeled & sliced the potatoes about 1/4 inch thick, boiled for about 10-15 minutes and the dish was ready in 30 minutes! Excellent. Also, simmered my brats in beer with onion for 20 min before grilling - really DOES make a difference!

I've been making this for years and didn't realize I never rated it! I double the sauce, use cider vinegar instead of white, a ton more bacon (we are bacon lovers) and use half celery seed/half celery flakes. I lost my German great-grandmother's recipe and with my tweaks on this recipe it is the same as hers. Another thing...I always, always, always throw this together and put it in a slow (225F) oven for a few hours, give or take. It really melds the flavors, I try to make this the day before I want it because it's always better the next day.

So tasty!  My husband gobbled it up and said it tasted almost exactly like his grandmothers!  The only changes I made was that I used red potatoes and left the skin on and cut them up into bite sized pieces before boiling them.  This sped up cooking time and gave the dish a great taste.  I also only used 6 potatoes since some reviews said more dressing was needed so I just used less potatoes.  I would highly recommend this dish if you love vinegar and are looking for a great side dish!  Fantastic!

Delicious!  I omitted the bacon slices and sauteed the onions in about a tablespoon of olive oil.  I added some reduced fat bacon bits after cooking.  Really reduces the amount of fat and cholesterol without sacrificing too much taste.  I also reduced the salt because the amount required yields nearly a full daily serving of sodium per serving of potato salad.  I thought the amount of sauce was more than adequate (although I did cut the potatoes into big chunks instead of into thin slices).  Next time I might up the vinegar slightly because the recipe as written doesn't have as much tang as I like.  Overall,  an easy, really fast, delicious recipe!

This recipe makes a very good potluck item.  I’ve gotten many “wonderful” comments about it.  Only warning is to be sure and DOUBLE the sauce quantities, as everyone wants more.

YUM!!! This is amazing-- Reminds me of the old delis we used to go to when I lived in NY/NJ! I've been on a quest for the perfect German Potato Salad recipe and, after many "Not bad, but..."-type recipes, found this one. Made it the night I found it, and fell in love! My husband wants it on a daily basis! Thanks so much, Tequila!!!

Although I don't care for German potato salad, I found it better then any I have tried in the past. My wife has been hounding me for the longest time to find and make it for her. She thought it was the best she had ever eaten and wants it added to my recipe file. By the way did I mention she is German!.

This was an easy recipe to make, in fact I made it ahead of time keeping the sauce and the potatoes separate until serving then I reheated the sauce then mixed with the potatoes and it worked wonderfully!

Made this by following the recipe exactly, except I ended up adding extra bacon for good measure, and used only 7 out of the 9 potatoes I cooked. I was afraid it wouldn't be saucy enough. It really just depends on the size of the potatoes, but Germans like it saucy. I'm not german, but live in Germany and my friend whose family is from Austria said it tasted just like the potato salad they always make. Except they serve it cold and without the bacon, but I know Germans do it this way (hot and with bacon). I did try it cold but preferred it hot. I wanted to use apple cider vinegar instead of white, but decided to stick to the recipe exactly. Next time I will try the cider vinegar to make it a little milder, but only because I'm not a fan of vinegar in the first place, unlike Germans. Point is, this recipe is authentic, I made it successfully, and I've never even made any kind of potato salad before.

This recipe is out of this world. I went to a German-American Festival and bought some to try. I was wanting to make some at home and I came across this recipe. I also doubled the sauce and added more bacon. Instead of using celery salt, I sauted celery with the onions. My husband says it's better than the Festivals potato salad. Will definitely be making this again!!

Very good.  I had been looking for a recipe like this.  I used to have this when I went to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg and always loved it.  This was almost exact and it was delicious. I did use everyone's suggestion and double the sauce. Everyone in my family loved it.  I can't wait to have the leftovers.  Yum!!!!

I never enjoyed the American versions of German potato salad because they were too vinegary (especially the vile canned stuff).  I didn't know I really liked the authentic version until I had "kartoffelsalat" in Germany recently.  I've been searching for a recipe that tasted the same and this is it!  I used packaged bacon bits and sauteed in a little olive oil instead of using bacon fat for heathiness reasons.  It was still fantastic with this change and probably would have been that much better with the extra flavor the bacon fat would have added.  Highly recommended.

We love this recipe! Best one we have tried. We used Harrington of Vermont Smokehouse bacon which adds a lot of extra flavor. Took it cold to a picnic and got rave reviews!

This is an excellent recipe. However, I have one thing to add as told to me by my German neighbor. The key to a good German Potato Salad is to NOT sautee the onions. Chop them fairly small and add them to the final cooking time. They add a little burst of crunch and taste. Try it.

Good stuff!!! Used this recipe for our oktoberfest party and it was great! I made ahead of time and put in the crockpot.  It was ok the next day reheated, but the bacon grease was a little funny.  Used lots of bacon and apple cider vinegar. I totally forgot the celery seed..so it probably would've been even better!!! Will make again.  Got lots of raves for it!!!

This recipe is outstanding.  My boyfriend doesnt really like potatoes (more of a rice person) but he likes these.  Really taste german and add a lot to the right meal although 2 tbsp sugar is unnecessary I used 2 tsp, I don't like sweet potato salad.  I think of them more as home fries or something not salad. They are good with the pork chop and saurkraut recipe on this site. I used 6 potatoes and did not double the sauce recipe.  Also take your time and cook the onions slowly for a better flavor. I don't often give 5 stars but this deserves it!!

Delicious!  I cut the potatoes into chunks rather than slices since that's what I prefer and then boiled them for 15 minutes.  I also added some chopped parsley at the end and let it sit and absorb the sauce for about 30 minutes as recommended by other reviewers.  I will be making this again!

This has become my signature potluck dish! I make it all the time and everyone loves it. I hate mayonnaise and fell in love with the german potato salad while living in Germany, this is the closest recipe I've ever found to it. I've made a few changes though. I tend to use red potatoes rather than russets. I also tend to use apple cider vinegar rather than white vinegar. The white vinegar is fine, but the apple cider vinegar just adds a little tang, especially as I use applewood smoked bacon. I love vinegar and found the original recipe a little light on it. When I make it for myself I swap the water and vinegar ratios. I find that is a bit stronger than most people like though so when I am taking it out I use 1/2 cup vinegar and 1/2 water. This isn't quite the same amount they say to use but it's close enough. Also I never have celery seed, so I've never added it in. Be careful with the flour mixture as it can bind up really fast if you aren't careful and make the texture odd but the flavor is still great.

Very good recipe!  I made this on a camping trip to go along with some beer brats.  Everyone raved about it.  Even my 9-year-old grandson had 2 helpings!  I used red potatoes.  I needed to add a little more water than called for, but that was probably because it had to sit for a while and thickened up a bit.  Very yummy!

I didn't add flour and instead of distilled white vinegar I used Salata (a seasoned vinegar dressing) made by Kuhne.  I think it adds a better flavor than regular vinegar.

pretty good, I did do 1 1/2 the amount of sauce as other reviews said there wasnt enough and I dont like dry potato salad.  It turned out great, just the right amount.  Sauce is tangy and a bit sweet at the same time.  I felt like something was missing texture wise... not sure.

The only substitutions I would make would be to use cider vinegar, add dried garlic, onion powder, paprika, dill weed, and any other seasonings you see fit (you can even use a really good seasoning salt). I cooked the onion in some of the bacon fat and cubed the potato into a 1/2 inch dice. The bacon should be added last with chopped green onion. You can cook the onion in the bacon fat and then add the flour to it with chicken broth to give it flavor and moisture. Overall great starter recipe.

Holy Moly this is yummy!  I used just four large thin Idaho patatoes, and it was perfect with the sauce.  I also added a tablespoon or more of mayo to make a creamy sauce (as my mother taught me). I'll try it with the red skin potatoes next time.  This recipe is even better than my mom's.  Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe was great!  I made it ahead of time and served it cold, and it was still delicious.  I served it with burgers and apple/cabbage slaw.  My husband HATES traditional mayonnaisey(sp?) potato salad, so he always asks me to make my grandfather's German Potato Salad recipe.  I don't do that one well because it is a "pinch of this" and everything "to taste"...so not having experience with it makes it hard to get right. So, I went looking for a different german potato salad recipe and found this one.  I will definitely make this  again.  Thank you!

This was good.  However if I make this again, it will only be once in a blue moon.  Maybe if something else was added to the potatoe salad to give it more of a taste rather than vinegar.  Also, I will slice the potatoe before cooking it.

I had a 5lb bag of red potatoes to use up and based on the other reviews, I decided to double the sauce ( there were about 10 regular sized potatoes, not minis). Well, it was perfect!  I doubled the onions too, but not the bacon and it was delicious. I added the sliced potatoes warm (no need to peel reds IMO) and they soaked up all the yummy sauce. This is a keeper for me!

5 stars- My husband is part German, I am not at all but he absolutely DEVOURS this every time I make it. On the occasion there is any leftover, it tastes even better the next day. This is divine warm or cold and can be served along many different entrees. Only thing I do different is double the bacon-actually I use a whole package. If you can get Hormel Maple flavored black label bacon , even better. Always use red bliss potatoes too. Thinking about this now and I want some bad....

Delicious! I had hoped to recreate my mother's recipe  that I remember and sure enough this one is it.  Just the right about of tart but not too.  Only change I made was I used apple cider vinegar as that's all I had. My husband said this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

Used 9 medium red potatoes, diced in 1 inch cubes.  Had no trouble with them falling apart at all.  Although the amount of sauce was adequate, I think the next time I will use 1.5 the amount.  Use precooked bacon (more), so sauteed onion in butter.  Did not think there was too much flour.  Used 1 t of salt, because I was concerned about the amount.  Next time I will use the full 2 t.  Didn't use celery seed because I didn't have any.  Used apple cider vinegar.  Would definitely make again.  We enjoyed this.

This year for 4th of July I was asked to make a German potato salad. I've never eaten it before, and to my knowledge, nor has anyone else in my direct family. If I didn't love them so much, they wouldn't get to eat this one either -- I would eat it all up right now I think! Again, I have no idea what it's "supposed" to taste like, but for how it DOES taste, it's unbelievable. Sweet and tart, salty, oniony, bacony, and celery-y! I'm absolutely in heaven and this one is immediately going in my handwritten recipe box. Thanks for posting! (P.S. I used the amount of potatoes and sauce as written. The celery is a strong flavor so if you leave it out, it IS going to affect the end result!)

Thank you so much for posting this I lost my Great Grandmothers awhile ago and this is the most similar recipe I could find, takes me back to when I used to live in Germany when I was a child!  I added chopped parsley and doubled sauce because I love my potato salad a little saucier!  THANK YOU!

This was DELICOUS!

I used Yukon Golds boiled whole w/ skins on - START WITH POTATOES IN COLD WATER or they will cook unevenly and/or get waterlogged.  Be sure to liberally salt the water.  I followed the suggestion of a few reviewers and added more bacon (I used turkey bacon) and doubled the sauce - added 2Tbs unsalted butter and 2Tbs olive oil to make up the extra fat needed in order to properly double the roux for the sauce.  ONLY ADDED 3 TABLESPOONS FLOUR instead of 4 for doubled sauce recipe.

Be sure to pour the sauce over the HOT potatoes so that the potatoes drink up the vinegary/onion-y sauce!

I thought this recipe was really good. Nothing will ever compare to my Grandma's but what can you say. The only problem that I had was that I did like some of the others and doubled my rue (sauce): which you should do:  but when I did I doubled salt also, and boy was that a BAD idea. I had to toss the whole thing out, it was yuck! So just as a heads up, if you are doubling don't do as I did, if I hadn't done that I can guarantee that I would of probably ate the whole thing by myself LOL.

Outstanding! I used 5 lbs of potatoes, 1 lb of bacon and doubled the other ingredients. I peeled and cubed the potatoes then boiled them. I browned the bacon until crispy and used half of the bacon fat to saute the onions in. Once they were done, I tossed in the vinegar/water mix, then the dry ingredients. I then poured that over the potatoes and mixed it up. I then transferred the finished dish to my slow cooker and kept on warm (we had a football party). This dish is so yummy! I received alot of compliments on this recipe - thanks! We served with the Wisconsin Bratwurst recipe on this site.

I made this for my husband who had a hankering for it. I hate the stuff and made him do all the taste testing - he says it is fantastic. Unfortunately, I didn't follow the recipe exactly and chunked the potatos rather than sliced them. Next time, I'll slice them up and they'll be perfect! Thanks.

I love German Potato Salad and this recipe was just what I was looking for. It was a perfect side dish to our grilled bratwurst. 

Be warned: this is NOTHING like the traditional cold potato salad (which I dislike and gives me the willies!). This is definitely more of a hearty side dish than a salad.

i keep looking for a recipe like the german potato salad my gramma makes (ok, so i could ask her, but i keep forgetting) this wasnt it, it was very good all the same.  i will definately be making this again.  the only things i altered are instead of celery seed i used fresh celery, about 1 stalk thinly sliced, and i added a little extra sugar cause i was trying to get it to taste more like grammas, which is sweeter.

Followed the recipe except used a package of Simply Potatoes, the sliced variety, instead of peeling, cooking and slicing my own. The sauce was enough for the amount of potatoes in the package. Using this shortcut made the recipe very easy. My husband has been asking for german potatoes but every recipe I have seen before just seems too time consuming. We both loved the recipe and I will be serving him his German potatoes on a regular basis now

I love this recipe. I gave it 4 stars because as written it is a little off on portions. I looked at several of the other comments and decided to double the "sauce" and I used more bacon but that's just because we like bacon around here. It was perfect! We even warmed it up for lunch the next day and I thought it was even better warmed up. Be careful not to over cook your potatoes though. It's much easier to mix if they arent mushy.

Made this last night for the first time. It turned out so well, my guy scarfed it up and requested more for tonight! Used cider vinegar rather than distilled but that's just a personal preference. Thanks!

still can't believe I love this so much!  Couldn't find my "warm potato salad & bacon" recipe so I found this in a pinch.  Wasn't crazy about adding flour and sugar... but decided to try it anyway since I needed a side and was looking for something similar.  It turned out great. I keep making it again and again.  The first time I made it, I boiled the potatoes... but ever since I bake them in the oven while cooking up the bacon.  My favorite is small finger potatoes cut into chunks, baked at 400 for 20 minute (use a little olive oil to prevent sticking) then just add to the mixture in a pot on the stove.  Perfect every time!

This recipe is delicious. This reminds me of the hot german potato salad my Austrian mother would make. I suggest doubling the flour, sugar, salt etc and accordingly doubling the vinegar & water. I have made this recipe with 50% apple cider & 50% white balsamic vinegar & this  gives it a nice tart taste. Like my mother I add caraway seeds at the end.

We really liked this recipe!  I used 1/2 the sugar and no celery seed and it was wonderful!  I usually only make true german potato salad, but this was a very refreshing change and an excellent cold weather dish.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is an easier recipe than some of the german ones i've seen. I lived there for several years and this is a good recipe. You can try caraway seed instead of celery, but use a smaller amount (very strong flavor), but is delicious! Thank you for a time saver form of a wonderful dish!

These spuds definitely have a delicious tangy kick to them! My boyfriend thought they were a bit too intense, but I loved them! I used apple cider vinegar instead, and they turned out just right. Thanks for the recipe!

I let another reviewer talk me into using less potatoes and I shouldn't have. The flavor was good and tart. Stick to the original amounts the recipe calls for and if you don't like hot potato salad or you don't like vinegar then DON'T make it anyways and then complain. Geez I hate when people do that!!! This was very good and I will make again!

My daughter is in the Air Force and whenever she gets home on leave she especially requests this dish. I made one change to it. I use apple cider vinegar instead of plain white vinegar.  I was out of white vinegar the first time I made it and everyone just thought it was great using apple cider vinegar.

I had a recipe from a German friend of mine that I had lost and this one was fairly close to hers.  In addition to the ingredients the poster listed, I added about 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar and 1 tablespoon of parsley which made it darn close to the one I lost.  I used 9 red potatoes as they tend to be around the same sizes and boiled them whole with the skins on.  No need to peel them...just slice when cooked, make the bacon and sauce and it's all good!  Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for a potluck at work. I added 3/4 of a package of Hillshire Farms "Lil Smokies " for extra interest and "filler"---People loved it. Even two days later people came up to me to compliment it. Thanks so much for the recipe. It's staying in my "Recipe Box" always. Pris

Good stuff! As others suggested I doubled the recipe and used apple vinegar instead of white vinegar. My husband (who lived in Germany) declared it authentic! I recommend that you use red potatoes for this dish - with the skins on. Great with grilled brats!

Awesome recipe.  I've made this over and over again.  I don't typically have celery seed, so I just add a few dashes of celery salt and tastes great.

This was really good.  I did have leftovers so I made them into patties and pan fried them.  The salad does have a vinegar taste but I like that flavor and so did the people I served it to.

I made a couple of changes using turkey bacon and fresh celery instead of bacon and celery seed. I also left out the salt. Use a small amount of spanish olive oil in order to cook the onion and celery. Much healthier and just as good I'm sure.

This salad would taste exactly the way my Grandmother's did if there was more vinegar added. Add a little more vinegar and you have the original German Salad. It almost brought a tear to my eye.

Mmm, what a nice change from the ordinary.  And so nice hot, too (usually only have it cold).  Recommendation: go for 1/4 cup vinegar instead of 1/3.

Thank you!  For 15 plus years my husband has been telling me what great German Potato salad his mother used to make.  I've even stood next to her, watched her make it, and written down what she did, but his verdict was always "Not as good."  

This recipe got a "pretty close" which from my husband is like a gold medal!  I used red potatoes, increased the salt to 1 tablespoon, used white wine vinegar and 1 tsp of celery seeds.  He loved it!

So for anyone who's looking for a great warm potato salad recipe to please a Hoosier, this one is it!

I wanted to make something different  this year for our family  Christmas  party. This recipe got a lot  of  praise from the guests. 
What's  nice is it's  so easy to make and changes up any menu nicely.

Love it!  Used red potatoes, boiled them whole - unpeeled, doubled the sauce mix, but did not increase the flour.  Used cider vinegar.  Used about 3/4 lb of bacon.  YUM YUM!

At 7, my family was transferred to Germany. (Army Brat) I learned to enjoy food there.  My first taste of German Potato salad was there.  As I remember, the lady used cider vinegar and that's what I always used.  I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it.  Of course, I had to cut it down, but it was excellent.  I did make more sauce and cut down the sugar.  I read through all the recipes and this was the only one that looked right.  Thanks.

I liked this recipe but I also didn't have enough of the sauce. It was dry so I made another batch and added it to my potatoes. I also would cut back on the celery seed. Just my preference. Would make it again but double the sauce.

This was fabulous. The recipe was fabulous in and of itself and my guests were raving about this recipe. The only modification I would make next time is to add 50% more potatoes and double the "sauce." Likewise, I would add a teaspoon or two of dried mustard seed - It gives it a more traditional flavoring. I like my hot german potato salad a bit on the saucy side - getting it too dry is so "blegh." Might as well boil plain potatoes and eat them right out of the pain with only a dash of salt and other flavor. But it IS the best recipe base I have ever used, and was well loved by those I served. (made a German dinner - Bratwurst, German potato salad, braised red cabbage, sauerkraut and Brussels sprouts.)

Good stuff Mainard!  My only change was to use 1/2 tsp. celery salt & 1/2 tsp. regular salt since I had no celery seeds.  I used fewer potatoes since I like LOTS of sauce.  We live in a part of Texas with a large German population and this is as good as any I've had in various eateries.  First rate grub!

This is SOOOOOO GOOD! I had not had anything like it before, and have made it 5 times in the last few weeks. I do agree with PP - red varieties tend to hold up better and don't turn to mush. I also double the sauce, but it it great just the way it is :-)

My husband and I went to a German restaurant earlier in the week, and he got a side of German potato salad but I did not. So, when looking for a side to make with the small potatoes I got from our CSA, I found this recipe. I was roasting a pork shoulder, so I used the grease from that to cook the onions and added in some Hormel Real Bacon Bits instead of dealing with cooking the bacon. I used celery salt instead of celery seed. It came out so good, and DH said it rivaled the restaurant's. This is definitely going into the recipe book.

DELICIOUS! So easy to make and taste wonderful!! Use red potatoes and leave the skin on. I served this with Wiener Schnitzel from this site. The combination of recipes made for one happy hubby :)

I'd never had hot potato salad, so I was hoping this would be a big hit. It was ok...easy enough to make and the sauce (dressing?) had a decent flavor, but I didn't really like it. There are lots and lots of potato recipes I prefer, so we probably won't make this again.

Holly wow. I overdid the potatoes, so now I have mashed potatoes, but this dressing is out of this world perfect. I added a decent amount of paprika (maybe a tsp) during the onion phase, but I cannot imagine this being any better. MAKE MORE OF THE SAUCE THOUGH!

This recipe was great just the way it was; I didn't change a thing.  It was super well-received at the Oktoberfest party I brought it to.  Make sure you use good quality potatoes and bacon, as they're the key parts!

my mom always made this for my dad when he had a hard week. i dont like canging recipes but i add extra bacon 9 pieces all together and i add bacon bits and a sprinkle of hot mustard powder. my friends then add a shake of hot sauce but i found that it is just too much with the hot sauce but you can always try new things but do it on the side so you dont ruin the whole batch if you dont like it.

The only change I made was to cut back the salt. I used just a dash of sea salt and it was delicious. Bacon is salty enough on its own.  We'll be having this again and again.

This was really good and a nice accompaniment to a reuban sandwich.  I used 6 potatoes instead of 9 and increased the bacon from 6 to 8 pieces.   I actually didn't even end up using all the potatoes or there wouldn't have been enough sauce..must have been the size of my potatoes.  The taste was really good - but, I actually think I might add a few more spashes of vinegar next time.

My father is German so I made this for him.  He LOVED it.  I read some of the other reviews so I made twice the amt of sauce.  I used about  1 1/2 of the sauce.

I reduced the proportions to 8. I thought it was a bit dry for my liking so next time I will increase the dressing by half and see if that does the trick. Otherwise easy and tasty.

Perfect - defintely double the sauce.  I made it a few hours ahead - arranged potatoes in a baking dish and poured the sauce over it - reheated it in 350 degree oven for 30 min - was perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I also didn't have celery seeds but instead used celery salt.  I was satisfied with the amounts for the sauce but would not object to increasing the quantities.  The only problem I had was trying to keep the potatoes together.  I like the idea of trying red potatoes to prevent that so I will try them next time.  I will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe exactly - it turned out wonderfully. Every member of the family loved it (even the picky eater who doesn't like potato salad asked for more!). This tastes like the authentic German Potato salad I had growing up. Great recipe!

definitely double the sauce, and use 9 medium white or red potatoes -- not the big bakers.

This recipe is exactly like the one my mom used to use. I like mine to have a little more tang, so I added a little more vinegar the second time around. I also don't use the celery seed because I don't have it on hand and it doesn't make any difference at all. Also, the recipe doesn't mention it, but red potatoes work the best for the recipe.

I love this recipe.  Even people who don't expect to like it usually do!  I usually add more bacon and sub apple cider vinegar for white vinegar.  Sometimes I don't peel the potatoes, but that makes them hard to slice, so I don't recommend it.  I have doubled and even tripled this recipe with great success, you just need a bowl big enough.  I kept a triple batch warm at a family reunion in a large electric roaster, and that worked well as it tastes best warm, not cold.  This is one of my favorite recipes!

My husband gives it 6 stars!  Used 5-6 good sized red potatoes (skins on) - easier and gives it a nice, rustic look.  Absolutely delicious!

this is very much like my grandmother's recipe which I don't have. I used 5 large potatoes, only 1 tbsp sugar, added 1 tsp grainy mustard and 1 bay leaf.  I used my grandmother method in which she brought the potatoes to boil, covered and turned off the heat, made sauce, drained potatoes, tossed with sauce, bake at 350 for 30 minutes and then stirred in bacon so it stays crispy. If you don't like vinegar then this isn't for you, it is supposed to be strong, very good thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for, just like my dad made =) Substituted bacos for a vegan version for a potluck, and it was a huge hit!

This is the best German Potato salad that I have ever had!  I am so happy that I made this recipe out of all of the others.  I did add more bacon and was happy with the extra drippings.  Thank you so much!  It was relatively very easy and delicious.

I am a personal chef and recently got a request for hot german potato salad. Not having a really good recipe, I went on the search. Tried this one and got wonderful feedback at the baby shower I catered. I didn't change much with the exception of using a white wine vinegar to impart a deeper and richer vinegar flavor. Thanks!

This was very good and my first attempt at German Potato Salad.  I had used 15 potatoes and had tripled the rest of the ingredients (except using only 3 tbsp. flour.  I added a little extra bacon than tripled too.  I also used cider vinegar instead of white, added some red wine vinegar and fresh chopped parsley(upon suggestions below).  I accidentally overcooked the potatoes and overbrowned the onions, but somehow it still tasted good.  Next time (if using so many potatoes like I did), I will use even more sauce.  The sauce is what makes it and it didn't seem like it was enough with all the potatoes I used.  Thanks for the recipe - it's going in my favs. cookbook.

This is the real deal! Sliced potatos is a must, not chopped or cubed. The presentation is just super that way. Thanks for the memories, didn't realize someone actually knows how to make this right.

Very good, but a little too salty for my family's taste.  Especially with the saltiness of most bacon, the added salt can be significantly reduced.

One thing I hate about cooking with potatoes is that it's too unpredictable.  What constitutes a "small" potato versus a "medium" potato?  For this recipe, I cut back to six potatoes (2.5 lbs) as others recommended.  I doubled the sauce, but it didn't seem to be enough.  I would recommend that whatever size potatoes you use, only use 2 lbs and FOR SURE double the sauce. I took this to a pot luck and it was a big hit.  So the flavor is okay - it just needs some tweaking with the ratio of potato:sauce.

This  improves a lot as it sits. It's important to quarter the potatoes before cooking so you don't get some undercooked. I poured off some of the bacon grease and used canola, but then added more bacon. Yum.

This is a great base recipe for German potato salad. Very traditional and right on, excellent flavor. The only change that I have to insist be made, is to use apple cider vinegar, not white vinegar. Cider vinegar will give that authentic taste you're looking for, although white vinegar does taste good too. Also, the celery seed is a must for an authentic taste, so this recipe does a great job.

Yum! I love German potato salad and this recipe. I just made it for myself because I had everything except for the celery seed, and it was good even without it. I doubled the sauce because I LOVE vinegar and I'm glad I did. This recipe is a definite keeper, thanks!

Very good recipe, and very easy to prepare.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will cut down on the vinegar just a bit.  I did what the other reviewers had suggested, used apple cider vinegar and doubled the sauce.  The sauce amount was perfect.

I made this for a girls night dinner last night and it was a hit!  I must agree with other reviewers that you need to double the amount of sauce you make in order to cover the potatoes.  I ended up wasting almost two whole potatoes because I didn't want to add them in because I could tell there wasn't enough sauce.  I will make this again for sure!

Fabulous! I cooked & then peeled my potatoes . I also let them sit for 3 hours  & covered dish with a tea towel for flavour to develop  before serving  . Besides these minor changes I followed everything else as per recipe. Thank you for a great recipe.

we're a buncha college kids and  since im the mama of this household, im always searching for recipes that'll appeal to them. My 3 homeboys are picky eaters, but they totally loved this recipe. i lessened the recipe for "4 servings", added  more bacon & bacon drippings, about 1/4 cup of water and another tablespoon of sugar cos I found the vinegar too potent for the boys taste. Like real kids, they don't eat they veggies, so I hid 4 stalks of chopped celery instead of celery seeds, and they happily devoured the whole thing. It's fabulously tasty, however, I would only make it from time to time cos I think it's not very healthy.. thanks for sharing!

Wow!  My grandparents were dear friends of a Mr. & Mrs. Mueller who came over from Germany, and I remember a divine German potato salad she made.  This is as close to it as you can get.  I took some other's suggestions and tweaked the dressing a little.  Specifically I doubled the sugar, salt, flour, pepper and celery seed, and I put 1 cup of water and 1 cup of vinegar (I used cider vinegar).  Wonderful memories and a wonderful recipe!  I will make this again!

The taste is good (due mostly to the bacon), but the amount of "sauce" for the salad is inadequate. It doesn't make enough to coat all of the potato slices. It should probably be doubled.

This is by far the best potato salad of any kind I have ever tasted. I thought I would bring something different for our 4th of July BBQ last year, but the mother of my uncle-by-marriage brought her version, too. Well, needless to say mine was gone by the end of the evening and hers was intact. It beat out mom's recipe!! I am bringing it again, as it is now one of my signature dishes, and memorable to all who ate it.

I left out the onions...I know, key part of the recipe, but I hate them.  First bite, I made a face, fiance made a face.  Not a good face.  Took a little to get used to.  I ended up eating 3 servings of this stuff.  I love it!  Glad I gave it a chance.  This will be made again.  We decided, though, this isn't a recipe to make all the time.

This was "ok" - I thought the potatos cooked WAY too long and made them very mushy and watery, other than that the flavor was pretty good and easy to make. Served with Keilbasa. Thanks

My husband and I really like Hot German Potato Salad and usually use the recipe in the orange Betty Crocker Cookbook. I was searching for variations when I came across this recipe. It is the same as the one in the Betty Crocker Cookbook. I usually double the sauce.  Excellent hot salad.

All I have to say is- WHOA! That is honestly the best potato salad I have ever made. I was suprised by the fact that it didn't taste too vinegary. Everyone loved this and I had to make it for 2 more cookouts this week! Good job on the recipe, Tequila!

I've used this recipe several times, and it always comes out great.  I change just a few things.

First of all I abhor peeling potatoes.  So I usually use red potatoes and leave the skin on.  

Second, I'm sort a freak about using salt during cooking.  That means, I don't.  So I don't salt the water.  

Third, I don't eat pork.  I've found a really great beef bacon substitute.  

Forth, I love vinegar.  I use double of what the recipe calls for.  

My husband loves this one as much as I do.  It's almost the main course.  It goes really well with Kielbasa!

This was an excellent recipe!  While it took a chunk of time to do, it was well worth it.  We ended up using a lot more bacon and I'm glad (mm, bacon...)  wE ended up using yukon gold potatoes and I think it worked well with the slightly sweet flavor of the sauce and the texture was great.

I found this to be a simple recipe to make and exactly what I was looking for. I too used red potatoes and I cut up smoked sausage in mine because I wanted more of a main dish. Thank you for the excellent recipe.

This is a very good salad - very easy to make also.  I only changed the potatoes to red potatoes and didn't use as many.  I also used some red onion.

The sauce seems good, but nine potatoes is too much. Would be better to know a total weight of potatoes.  I will try again with more sauce at hand.

This is a great basic recipe for German Potato Salad.  I could never find a recipe that sounded like what I wanted -- until I found this one.  Very tasty and my family enjoyed it very much. I used more bacon than it called for, just because we like bacon so much.  I didn't use the celery seed, but I will next time.  I added green onion to it to make it look pretty.  The only thing I would change is the sauce.  We don't think there is enough of it, so I'll make a double batch of the sauce and maybe add a little more vinegar and sugar to it.  Otherwise it is a very good recipe and it will be made often at our house.  Thank you for sharing

This recipe is absolutely amazing! My husband said it's better than any German potato salad he's ever had! I agree with other reviewers that suggest using small red potatoes as you have a more saucy salad versus using larger potatoes.  The sauce is amazing and I often mix my less exciting vegetables like peas or broccoli into the sauce left over on my plate.

Grest recipe. I used a combo of white, red and purple potatoes (9 small total) and the rest of the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great. Peeling is much easier after the potatoes are cooked. Actually I did adjust the liquid - I did 1/3 C vinegar and then just added water to make it a cup, so only 2/3 C water. Loved this recipe!

This recipe is spot on! Absolutely delicious. ..I did add more bacon though, lets face it, bacon makes everything just a little bit better! My family loved it! I can't wait to tell my mother-in-law!  It was actually better than hers! Shhhhh!

very good German potato salad... tasted excellent... however the potatoes I used were on the drier side of things and crumbled... they also soaked up a lot of the water and vinegar mixture... next time I have dry potatoes I will definitely add more water and vinegar maybe even double it... but otherwise very good

My sister used this recipe last weekend.  Everyone was loving the dish.  On my drive home, I was hankering for more of the Hot German Potato Salad.  This weekend I am going to make it and add it to my favorite list of foods. It was THAT good!

Super good! I used 8 medium red potatoes and thought it was just the right amount for the sauce. My recommendations would be to add a few tablespoons more vinegar and make sure the potatoes are completely cool when you slice them. Next time I will be making mine ahead of time and refrigerating them so they're easier to slice.

This looks very good but I think I'll stick to my centuries old one that I finally allowed to be published in my new church cookbook.

I use 5 lbs. (exactly) of red potatoes and dice them quite large (they do shrink up when adding sauce).  Also, after doing the bacon (same amt. and crumble same way), and sauteeing the 3/4 c. onions, I add 3/4 cup sugar (now use Splenda).  Stir until almost melted.  Then add 1 tsp. mustard, or more to taste and 2 T. flour.  Stir thoroughly.  Then add 1 c. white vinegar (I use anything but Heinz) and 1 c. water.  These two items must be exact.  Then I add 1 c. chopped celerg and salt and pepper to taste.  Add crumbled bacon.  Stir until thickened and cooked down to desired thickness.  Pour over peeled and diced potatoes and mix thoroughly.  Allow to stand for 15 minutes.  Must be served warm.

Holy Hanna did this hit the spot! Just the right sweet & sour mix. The only thing I did different was I baked the potatoes, then peeled and sliced them - once they were cool enough to handle. Once you've had baked potato salad you realize how much flavor is lost by boiling. Other than that small change it was perfect.

For those that prefer a moister salad (think consistency of the super market) by all means you will need to double up on the "dressing" portion...as for myself and family we liked it as posted.

Filling, tasty comfort food. I like this, but not everyone I've served it to does. Guess it's just one of those things :)

Finally! A classic german potato salad recipe. It is the celery seed that gives this salad its authentic flair

We make this recipe often and it's always a hit! It has a great zip to it with the apple cider vinegar.

I made this exactly like the recipe, but I added a 1/2 cup diced red and orange bell peppers, and 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions, just to make it more colorful. I served it alongside burgers at a bbq and it was a big hit. Thanks so much for sharing! Hot potato salad is delicious.

My dad really liked this, but out of the 7 people who ate it, he was the only one! I think its just because the rest of us who had never ate German potato salad before, desided we don't like it. I might not ever try another recipe for this again and just stick to making my regular mustard poptato salad. For those of you that like G. poptato salad, my dad said it tasted just like the last time he ate it at a German resteraunt.

Soooo yummy! I didn't have enough potatoes, or celery seed, but it still came out wonderful! Family gobbled it up! Made it twice this way, but can't wait to try it w/the celery seed! Not sure it could get any better!

I used brown russet potatoes and used just 2 (which was not enough - I couldn't figure out how to "convert" 9 red potatoes to big brown ones).  Probably 4 would have been better.  The kids actually loved this, though the 11 yo said it was a bit sweet (surprisingly).  I cooked the bacon halfway in the microwave and then the rest of the way in a pan, so only used about half of the available drippings (presumably). All in all, really good and I'll make it again.

This was tasty! But be sure you use some kind of waxy potatoes and not russet potatoes like I did! (that's all I had and I didn't feel like going to the store!) Mine turned into Hot German Mashed Potato Salad hehe! But it still tasted great. Next time I'll do it right!

This was fabulous !! My husband is part German and LOVED this recipe. This was my first attempt at hot german potatoe salad and I could not have been more pleased. We're taking our new batch to the veteran's home in Yountville, CA tomorrow as members of the Elk's Lodge Veteran's Commitee. I used 12 potatoes and 2 batches of the dressing. It's perfect !

This was absolutely delicious!  I served it alongside kielbasa and kraut.  My boyfriend loved these, saying something along the lines of "I've had something like these before...but never this good!"    I've never made or tried this before.  The recipe was super simple and even though my potatoes turned out softer than intended, it was amazing.  Highly, highly recommended!

used new baby potatoes with skins on (super easy cause you don't have to slice them at all!) and eliminated the celery seed because of family preferences.  this was definitely the HIT of the bbq and everyone wants the recipe now!  i'm reluctant to share it because its so easy and amazing i want to keep it for bringing EVERYWHERE!!

I loved the taste, but there is no way the sauce is enough for all these potatoes. I had to double the sauce for it to even look remotely like the picture. Good recipe. Will make again, but with more sauce.

really enjoyed this recipe. was my first time trying a hot german potato salad so didn't really know what to expect. I made a couple minor adjustments to the recipe and it turned out amazing. substituted actual celery for celery seed and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar. took it to a bbq potluck and it was literally gone before i could get a second helping. will definitely be using this for future bbq's.  cheers

With four of us in our family it's a challenge to find something that we all like so that we can have it again. This one makes the grade!  I add ground stone mustard to take it over the top in awesomeness.

It was AWESOME, and so simple! I didn't have bacon, so to substitute for its fat being used for roux to thicken the gravy/dressing, I used 1 tbsp butter in place. Needed a little dressing, so I added in a little more sugar/salt/vinegar.  P.S: While I hate people who add in or change one crucial ingredient that causes the flavor of the recipe to change and then claim "BEST RECIPE EVER", but a little mustard could never hurt, could it?

Wow! Is this ever delicious! Thanx so much Tequilla. I didn't change anything in the recipe. I can't imagine one could improve on it. This was a big hit. YUM!

Made for Easter dinner for extended family. First time I ever made it. Everyone loved it! It was very sweet to me but everyone else said it was perfect so I guess it's just me. I'd definitely make this again!

Great hot potato salad, I upped the sugar just a bit and next time I will try with apple cider vinegar instead of the white. We enjoyed this very much. It was a nice change for a side dish. Also, I used 4 large potatoes but kept the dressing ingredients the the same so it would have more sauce, and it worked out perfect. Thanks

To start: I did "like" this recipe, but it was a lil bland for my taste...I also want to note that there was not enough dressing for the potatoes- really be careful on the size of the potatoes and adjust accordingly.

This was great. My husband, who does not normally like potato anything, said it was great. I followed the directions exactly...except I chopped up the bacon with kitchen shears before frying it and just fried up the bacon pieces along with the onions. We will make this again!

very good.  i had to cut them in chunks because i had a hard time slicing the cooked potatoes. i also had to use red onion because i was out of white.  it looked like there wouldnt be enough sauce but once everything was combined the sauce was perfect. i served this w/ Scalloped Cabbage with Ham and Cheese also from this site. i think this would be great w/ a pork roast or schnitzel

I love this potato salad!  I'm also a fan of the more American style stuff, but for those who want more of a vinegary kick without the egginess of your usual potluck variety, try this recipe.  Since I've made this a few times now, I've come to like changing things up - these alterations aren't necessary, but I like them.  As many people suggest, red potatoes just taste better - and stand the boiling well.  I  use baby potatoes.  I cut after boiling if I need to (the tiniest can stay whole).  I keep the sauce the same, but use only one small white onion -- for the rest of my onion flavor I throw in around 1/2c to 3/4c sliced spring onions/scallions right before serving.  In terms of vinegar, I like to use 1/2c white and 1/4c apple cider -- a little of that goes a long way, and too much I've found to be overpowering.

Though I've eaten a lot of homemade german potato salad, this is the first attempt I've made to make it myself. This turned out very much like my family recipe. I substituted fake bacon for the real bacon so everyone at my office party could enjoy it, and it didn't seem to make any difference to the end result. I did need more moisture when adding the dry ingredients to the onions and "drippings", but just adding the water and vinegar early solved it.

This was excellent!  I never had German potato salad before and thought to make it this weekend and it turned out AWESOME!  I didnt have any celery seeds although I did add some chopped celery to it to give it some crunch and I also added some chopped parsley to punch up the color but otherwise it turned out GREAT!  Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! I halfed the amount of potatoes & bacon & kept the rest of ingredients the same...came out to a perfect amount of sauce. Only had cider vinegar on hand & liked the extra bit of sweet it gave it.  First potato salad i've ever liked - great recipe!

Are you crazy? 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken 1.1 cups of liquid. It made great wallpaper paste. I threw the potato salad in the trash.

This was really tasty. I cut the recipe in half. When I did this, it called for 6 potatoes and I only used 3 large gold potatoes and actually sliced them up before boiling, so they cooked a lot faster than I realized. I kept the sauce proportions as the recipe called for (keep in mind, I cut the recipe in half). The sauce to potato ratio was really good this way, and if I would have used more potatoes I imagine it would have been really dry.  I also didn't have celery seed on hand, which was a bummer because I think that's a key ingredient in german potato salad.  But I did use 2 tablespoons of dill out of my garden and added it to the sauce and it tasted really good this way.  I paired this with a bratwurst and a beer and it was a really good meal! I'll make it again.

Nice change of pace for potato salad. I enjoyed this very much. Stubborn boyfriend surprisingly wouldn't even try this.  I'm glad he didn't because I only made the recipe for 2 and I gobbled it all up myself.  His loss, VERY GOOD! I am the potato fanatic in the house though, he prefers meat.

This was gooooood! I've made it 3 times. I haven't changed anything from the original recipe, except I tried the second with apple cider vinegar. Stick with the white vinegar, as it adds a lot more flavor to the dish. Don't overcook your bacon unless you like the charred flavor. Almost as good as the local German restaurant.

I agree with an earlier reviewer -- the potatoes fell apart, maybe will use red potatoes next time. The flavor was fantastic! I tried to scale down the recipe and I found it to be a bit dry, but I just added more vinegar and water later on and thinned out the sauce and it was still amazing!!!! Very pleased. Thanks!

This was tasty, and not too hard to make, either. Just make sure you don't overcook your potatoes.  I used cider vinegar.  We had this with German bratwursts, Kaiser rolls, and broccoli.

Great recipe! Since moving to Munich from the States, I eat potato salad every time we go out, trying to find my favorite recipe. I've tried a number of recipes for potato salad in the past few months; this takes the cake!

I added 2 macintosh apples (cut in apple cutter, then sliced into thirds again, then boiled for 3-5 minutes) at the very end of the cooking. It was SO good.

I also modified by adding a splash more vinegar and 1 Tbsp more sugar.

OMG - this is a FANTASTIC dish!  I used 7 slices of peppered bacon didn't have celery seed, so just tossed in a little celery salt.  Rather than the 12 servings indicated, I calculated my Weight Watcher points based on eight 1-cup servings, and each serving was only 5 points!  I made a pork loin roast and brussel sprouts to go along with the salad - best meal I've had ina long time.  You don't have to look any further for the best hot German potato salad recipe because this is it!  I will most definitely make it time and time again.

I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce- I took it to a super bowl party last night and everyone loved it- the bowl was scraped clean- all commented that it tasted authentic-  I had to add olive oil though as mine was dry due to the fact that I used already cooked bacon.  it was super easy to make will definitely make it again

I made this for a picnic for my in-laws (I'm not a huge fan of German Potato Salad).  After reading all of the reviews, I added a splash of red wine vinegar.  Other than doubling the recipe for more sauce, that was the only change I made.  I thought it tasted too vinegary, and was worried that others felt the same way.  Well, everyone raved about it and now wants the recipe.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I doubled the sauce but it got really really sticky, and kind of was paste like.  My husband never finished the leftover and he eats everything.

Different yet delicious!  I used small red potatoes (almost 3 pounds) and didn't peal them.  As others suggested, I doubled the sauce (glad I did!).  I left out the celery seed, and instead added a 1/2 tsp. (or so) of caraway, which I really liked.  I wanted a healthier meal, so I used turkey kielbasa sausage instead (1/2 a package) of bacon.  I sliced the sausage thin and added it after the onions browned in olive oil.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

VERY easy and a perfect compliment for saurbraten. I used apple vinegar instead of white vinegar and loved it. My husband and very picky son could not get enough.

My ex's family was from Germany & used to make this but I didn't have the recipe. Found this one & it turned out awesome; very authentic. I doubled the sauce & used apple cider vinegar as others suggested. I'm so excited to have found this recipe!!

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used red potatoes (as suggested by others).  My mom always made a great German Potato salad, but I could never get the sauce to come out like hers.  This one was as good as hers, if not better!  I also added a few green olives, the way my mom always did.  Even my picky kids ate it!  Thanks - it’s a new favorite in our house.

This is a favorite at our house. Definitely double the sauce amount. I tried it with apple cider vinegar the second time I made it. We didn't like it as well as the white vinegar. We love this recipe as is. Thanks for sharing!

Ehhh. Ok. My mom used to do everything almost the same but use mayo as the dressing base and add boiled egg. I prefer her way much better.

This wasn't bad, although I found it to be a little too sweet and slightly bland. Next time, I may omit the sugar and substitute chicken broth for the water. I will likely try this recipe again with modifications. Thank you for sharing!

I hated potato salad until I tried this recipe. We have many potato salad lovers in our family so I was looking for a good recipe to serve at my son's birthday party. This one is awesome and the only potato salad I can say that I LOVE! Got rave reviews from the former mayo potato salad lovers at the b-day party. I used red potatoes and chunked them instead of sliced.

This salad was a pleaser!  Brought back a lot of memories as a child.  I didn't change a thing, but my dad thinks it should have had more vinegar.  I disagree.  It was perfect.

I liked this alot. It was a nice balance and the bacon made it yummy. I made double dressing since I had extra potatoes and it worked excellent. There were no leftovers.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used the servings calculator to increase the measurements to make a bit more dressing, as I like it nice and goopy.  I think next time, I may decrease the vinegar a bit.  How delicious those onions smell when sauteed in bacon grease! Mmmmmm!

I overcooked my potatoes so they were kind of mushy. Even still, it was very tasty. I will make this one again but cook the potatoes right. It's not 'diet food' though.

This was excellent.... I used apple cider vinegar instead, and substituted brown sugar for the white.  I also added fresh chopped parsely.  It was wonderful!!

My husband and I just returned from a wonderful vacation in Leavenworth, WA, where we had some absolutely fabulous German food.  My husband has always turned up his nose at potato salads (he doesn't like mayonnaise & hard-boiled eggs) and I had a hard time convincing him to try German Potato Salad.  When he did try it, he loved it and requested that I find a recipe as soon as we got home.  Even though this recipe is a little different than the salad we had in Leavenworth we found it to be VERY good.  My husband said that it's a definate "keeper"!

I have tried several German Potato Salad recipes, this one was by far the easiest and the most tasteful.

This one is a keeper.

First let me say I'm 64 years old and I've always detested German potato salad. While my poor husband loves it, I've never made it. For a recent outdoor get together I decided to make this. Let me say everyone loved it, including myself. While I followed the ingredients to a T I did alter the amounts. I used about 3 pounds unpeeled (I'm lazy) red potatoes, about 3/4+ pounds thick cut bacon and 1.25 cups onion and doubled the sauce. While I doubled the sauce I did not double all the amounts. For double the sauce I used: 2 tsp of flour, 2 tsp of sugar, 2 tsp of salt (might go 2.5 or 3 next time), 1 tsp celery seed (might try 1.5 next time), 1/4 tsp pepper, 1.5 cups water and 2/3 chips white vinegar. When it was done I put it in an uncovered crockpot just to keep it warm. I was not impressed when it was first finished but after sitting for an hour or two  in the crockpot it was delicious. So my take-a-way: This must sit for a period of time so that the flavors will meld. This was really good and quite the hit. I will make this many more times. Thank you for this recipe.

Pretty good.  I'm looking for a german potato receipe like Schmidt's in Columbus OH - this was close.  Not enough of a vinegar taste for us, maybe we'll adjust next time.  Good though!

WAY too much flour. Next time I make this I am going to try a bit less than 1 tablespoon or maybe none at all-----defintely not two tablespoons. The "extra" flour made the salad a bit gluggy and slightly dissatisfying.

Also:  I wish the person sharing this recipe would specify in the ingredients list the weight of the potatoes or at least the size of the "9 potatoes."  I am certain I'm not the only cook wondering just what size/type/amount of potatoes to use.

And:  I agree with earlier commenter who said a bit more vinegar would be better. I took her advice and added another two tablespoons (white wine vinegar) to my recipe.

Other than the flour mishap and having to guess at true amount of potatoes-----this recipe is a keeper.

Oh-----and I used veggie bacon. Delicious.

I cut the potatoes into four pieces so only took about 15 minutes to cook. I found the sauce to be in perfect ratio to the potatoes.  I made as directed and put into a slow cooker set to warm for an hour before serving so I could fully concentrate on the chicken dish I was also preparing. Delish.

We loved this salad! I did double the bacon, as we are bacon lovers. I used red new potatoes, 4-1/2 pounds. Even with the red potatoes, felt it lacked in the eye appeal so added scallions and parsley, too. Took it to a party last night, and there was zero left, so I am now making it again today! That's how good it is! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is fantastic! It never lasts more than a day in my house, the family can’t get enough of this delicious potato salad. I do add more bacon and onion and use apple cider vinegar for some extra tang.

My son and husband really enjoyed this recipe. I used six med. large red potatoes, 1/4 cup of cider vinegar because a similar recipe using 1/3 was too sharp.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious, old fashioned German Potato Salad.  I bake batches of bacon, then freeze the cooked strips. No bacon grease was available, so I just used 1/2 T butter to brown the onions.  I ended up browning the flour mixture in the cooked onions, then added the vinegar and water to make a gravy.  After draining the potatoes, let them sit over low heat for a bit to release the steam before adding the sauce.  The potatoes will stay formed and not be as gummy.

This recipe sounds great but whoever reads this review PLEASE LISTEN. This is a family secret from my German ancestors... do not drain the bacon fat,save it in the pan low heat and simmer, then add your spices and onions as well as your vinegar, simmer 3-5 minutes making sure not to burn, then pour over potatoes. This makes the dish much more flavorful and savory. Truly the ultimate comfort food.

Made this for an Oktoberfest party and it was a hit!  I used red potatoes and made 1-1/2 times the amount of sauce (since people were saying it tended to be dry), and it was perfect.

Tastes exactly like my favorite  German restaurant. Family loved it. Used red potatoes ,  didn't overcook them so mine looked better than the photo. Will definitely  make again. Served with red cabbage and pork.

I made this yesterday using 9 large potatoes. There was not enough dressing so it was rather dry and bland.  Today I tried it again with 6 medium potatoes, more bacon and twice as much cider vinegar.   It's much better and I'm happy to serve it.

Great German Potato salad!  I made for Easter and it was a hit!
I used red potatoes and left the skins on.  I doubled the recipe for 14 people and kept it in my slow cooker so it could be served warm.  I followed the recipe exactly and felt that there was more than enough sauce for the potatoes.  Will definitely be making this again - YUM!

I used a 5 lb bag of red potatoes a lb of bacon and doubled the sauce mixture .  The only ingredient I changed was I substituted celery salt for the celery seed just because I personally don't care for celery seed. My family loved it! This is definitely a go to recipe.

Awesome and EASY! Test subjects were an impromtu get-together after trick or treat. I was confused about the size of 9 potatoes, but I used 1 large can of potatoes to save time, and I did not have celery seed, so I doubled the amount and used celery flakes.  What a hit!!!  I really don't know what the negative reviews are about.  Flour amount was perfect (maybe they did not boil long enough?); not too much vinegar. I sliced the potatoes right into a slow cooker, crumbled the bacon on top of the potatoes and poured the sauce over top.

Wonderful as-is – I thought the amount of sauce was just right.  I made a half-recipe for 6 people.  Be aware if you scale the recipe on the web site to 6 servings, it did not adjust the pepper amount correctly for me – it stayed at the original amount.  I used medium red potatoes, and substituted chopped chives for onions to make it low-FODMAP.   The chives cut the cooking time down, and made the salad pretty.  The kids all liked it.  I served it for a German-themed meal with Weiner schnitzel, rye bread and “Grandma Jeanette's Amazing German Red Cabbage” from this site.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe – it’s a keeper.

Boil time for potatoes is WAY TOO long....they were mush.  Leaving skins on might have helped or using LARGE potatoes instead of average size for 30 mins of boiling.  Amount of bacon, vinegar, water, and celery seed is proportioned too low with amount of potatoes---doubled it by comparing it with another recipe I found in a old cookbook.  Look for another recipe and skip this one.

As others mentioned need to double the sauce and use red potatoes so they hold together well.  Good flavor though.

This recipe is exactly the one that I have been making for years.  It is a family favorite with a few changes.  I use cider vinegar and always double the bacon and sauce; I also use red skin potatoes and videlia onions.  I've even made it hours before the party and just put into the oven for a half hour to reheat.  Yummy!

Great recipe. I made the potato salad as written. I do agree that you need to double the sauce. It tasted just like I remember!
Made it again and used 7 potatoes instead of 9. Did not double the sauce. Just right! Also, I used unpeeled red potatoes. Yummy!

UPDATE: I THINK I KNOW WHY MY FIRST ATTEMPT WAS BLAND AND DRY. TEQUILLA DOES NOT SPECIFY WHAT SIZE OF POTATOES TO USE. HAD I GIVEN IT SOME THOUGHT (AND A GOOD DOSE OF COMMON SENSE HAHA), I WOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT SINCE MY POTATOES WERE QUITE LARGE, I'D NEED TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE SAUCE TO COMPENSATE. THIS TIME AROUND, I WAS SURE TO USE SMALLER POTATOES AND ADD A GOOD DOES OF S&P TO FINISH - PERFECT! THE KEY IS ENSURE THAT YOUR POTATOES ARE EVENLY COVERED (NO NEED TO DROWN THEM BUT FEEL FREE TO DOUBLE THE SAUCE IF NEED BE) AND SEASON TO TASTE BEFORE SERVING. THIS IS NOW A WINNER IN MY BOOK! Not bad. I've had better, but then again I didn't expect this to be as good as my local German restaurant's potato salad. Both my hubs and I found this to be good but a tad bland. After sneaking just one bite, I knew I needed to s&p to taste. I added a GENEROUS dose of both and still felt something was missing. I then added another 1/4 t of celery seed and a T more vinegar (my potatoes seemed a bit dry without it). I even let the flavors blend for a half hour while my hubs grilled our brats. Still bland. :( Ironically enough, my neighbor liked this better lukewarm (I gave her half of what was left), so I'm hoping I will too. Thanks anyways, Tequilla! :-)

I made these because I remember my Mom making it often for my Dad back in the 70's. I remember hating them and wishing she made mashed instead.  Made them to go along with the Sauerbraten recipe I also ma from this site. The taste was the same except now I kinda like them. Its  deffinately a different taste from scallop or augraten but a nice change, give em a try.

This was great!  Made some changes based in what I had on hand.  Used both white and sweet potatoes, red wine vinegar and added a squirt of mustard to the dressing. I'll make this gain for sure!

This was a delicious recipe and different from normal potato salad.  I enjoyed the mix of flavors and the dressing was spot on.  I have to say I enjoyed this warm or hot versus cold.  Thanks for a delicious recipe I will make again.

This was good - I halved the recipe, but still made about the same amount of bacon (what can I say, we love bacon!). I didn't read about how you were supposed to cook and slice the potatoes, until I already had them in the boiling water. Regardless, we enjoyed this and will likely make it again.

Needed more sauce. Good to let the bacon get very crisp/black so it will crumble.

Very good basic recipe. I added more vinegar and less water and sugar. It is very easy to adjust this to taste. Also used much less flour to keep the dressing lighter rather than heavier like gravy. Everyone loved it.

my husband and I decided to make a German meal tonight, something we have never done, and I came across this recipe. It turned out GREAT! We actually both agreed that maybe it had a little too much bacon and plan on cutting back next time, but aside from that, we will definitely be making this again! Great Oktoberfest menu item!!!

Just like Grandma's!!! I recommend substituting apple cider vinegar, though.  And I use golden potatoes.

This is EXACTLY the recipe I use when making German Potato Salad and it never lasts long at parties.  Even though it is very unhealthy for you (considering the sauce IS the bacon grease...), it is still so delicious.  I was hoping to find a similar recipe to what I use at home, and I am happy to find the exact same ingredients in yours :)

This recipe was really good. It gets much better after standing for a few hours. The sauce was a little thicker than I expected so I thinned it a smidge with water. I think I will add a little less flour and a little less vinegar next time as the sour part slightly overwhelmed the sweet. More bacon crumbles too as these really add the salty kick to perk up the potatoes.

Very Yummy and very authentic! I was born and raised in Germany. You can order something like this in many resaturants in Bavaria. I used only half the bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon of salt and upped the onions to 1 cup. Also added a handful of chopped italian parsley for color. Delicious.

This was my first try at a German Potato Salad.  i was always a egg potato salad maker.  To me it came out fair, but the MRS said it was too sweet.  i did manipulate the recipe by adding 2 TBS of flour to thicken the sauce.

The 5YO also ate a fair portion and gave it 4 1/2 stars.   I think i will give it another try and cut down the sugar.

also the 30 min cooking time for the  potatoes was a bit long.  i would think 20 min would work as my potatoes came out on the mushy side and hard to slice.

I WILL be making this again.

Recipe is great as written. Don't change a thing. The family said it was better than our local German restaurant serves. Don't compare to cold American potatoe salad.

Needed a little bit of salt after the fact but very yummy. Served this with pulled pork sandwiches and fresh green beans. DELICIOUS alternative to mayo-laden potato salad. Will definitely make again.

Classically delicious! I don't have celery seed, and it is fine without.  If you have trouble with your cooked potatoes crumbling when you slice them, you can always dice the potatoes instead and boil them that way - it's faster too.  When I don't serve these right away, I keep them warm in a crock pot.

Wonderful dish - exactly what I wanted to accompany some specialty sausages I picked up. Only change was to use some small, 'new' potatos I already had. Very nice taste.

I am disappointed... I am German and I was very much hoping this would be close to my grandma and grandpa's recipe but it wasn't even close.  I think if I were to make it again I would use less vinegar and use apple vinegar instead... bummed.

Amazing, absolutely delicious. My grandmother (my Oma) is from Germany and this tastes very similar to her potato salad which I never thought I would be able to reproduce. This would make an excellent side to a German main course like Rouladen or Weinerschnitzel.

Thank you for a great recipe. The second time I tried it I did a couple of things differently. I went for green onions and I like the variation and I have an idea to try peas that would probably work nicely to compliment the vinegar/sugar and potato.

Yummy !! I served this along with pork chops and they were just perfect !! Don't hesitate to try them ! I cheated a little and made my sauce right in with the bacon after cutting it into little pieces. I was also afraid that the vinegar would be to much and wanted more sauce so I added 1/2 cup of water. I also doubled the sauce but did not double the vinegar nor the celery seed. Will certainly make it again and I forgot to say that I'm a bacon lover also so I added more bacon. This seems to be a sauce that you can easily adjust to your liking. Thank you !!

This is absolutely delicious.  I always double the sauce and trim the fat off the bacon.  Sometimes I use turkey bacon if that's all we have.  It always turns out great.

I had never made or even tried warm german potato salad before, but it was the perfect side dish idea for our Oktoberfest party so I tried this recipe.  It was wonderful!  I followed it exactly.  The only change I will make in the future is to use red potatoes with the skins on. I used peeled baking potatoes which fell apart too easily.

This Recipe is 4 star 'as is' if you take the other reveiwers advice about the potatos. It's even better if you put a bit less flour and a little bit more vinagar into it. Thank you!

This was excellent!  I liked the tangy flavor so much I added a little more vinegard  to it.  In order to speed things up I peeled the potatoes, sliced them first then boiled them.  Had em ready realy quick that way.   Yummy!

This is the very best german potato salad I have ever had! I made this one other time from a different recipe and I did not care for it.I found this one on here & thought 'well I'll give this one a try'..Well I'm so glad I did it was soooo very good.I did make more of the dressing since I read some of the reviews before I made it.And did also add a splash more of vinegar which I used Braggs organic vinegar and it was fine.Gave a dish to my neighbor & she Loved it!Not to mention so did my hubby! This is surely going into my recipe box.More than a 5 star recipe.Ps;I only used 7 med.Potatoes.

Halved this recipe and it came out great!  I did leave out the sugar, can't eat it and not much of a fan of sweet potato salad.  Other than that, made recipe as stated.  LOVED it.  Boyfriend also said it was a "keeper".

This was a great tasting and easy to make recipe.  My only complaint was that it was not saucy enough.  Next time I will double the sauce ingredients to give a less dry salad.  It was a big hit for dinner.

Inspired by my sister-in-law's success with this recipe - I decided to give it a go and I'm so glad that I did.  It was amazing.  I paired this salad with the "Beer Brats" recipe and some sour kraut...and have been raving about it ever since!  Can't wait for the leftovers tonight!  (Oh - I didn't add the salt, as I felt that the bacon would be salty enough.  I would leave it out again in the future.)

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was awesome!!  I do think that it needed more of the sauce and less potatoes. Also, don't serve it cold.  I thought it would be just as good cold, and it was not even close.  Needs to be eaten warm.

I followed the recipe exactly, and  we enjoyed these tasty potatoes with Jagerschnitzel.  Next time I will use 7 or 8 medium potatoes instead of 9 to get a little more flavor on the potatoes.

Your really have to like vinegar to enjoy this potato salad.  I have never had german potato salad before and perhaps my substitutions didnt cover the vinegar taste properly. I did use cider vinegar and green onions and had no celery seed.  I also doubled the sauce as it was said by others it didnt have enough.  Again, this could just be my error.

I'm just finishing up my first serving of this and going back for more.  This is a really good german potato salad.  The only thing I did different was to add a hint more sugar otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T".  I will probably make a batch of this for the 4th weekend ahead of time and reheat in a crockpot.  Thank you!!!

This is my grandma's recipe but she always added a rib or 2 of chopped celery and also a chopped bell pepper with the onion.  I have made this many times for church suppers and always get rave reviews. Try this you won't be sorry!

I have used this recipe for years, and always taken office potlucks...never any leftovers.  My version calls for a Kelbasa, which I slice thickly and fry a little after the bacon and remove from pan.  All gets added back in the end and you can even keep it in a casserole dish and heat in the oven the next day.  Very Very Yummy Recipe.

This was fantastic. I'm really trying to cut back on fat and meat, so I eliminated the bacon and sauteed the onions in a small amount of hearth-healthy margarine instead. To add the bacon flavor, I used a few shakes of Bacos (not made of meat, low sodium, no fat)after the salad was already made. I made the sauce all at once; mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl, added the water and vinegar, and cooked all together until it boiled. I used golden potatoes (some fell apart, but still good), mixed the sauce in, and let it sit for a few hours at room temperature. Sprinkled the Bacos on after mixing together. Friend absolutely raved about it. Thank you, Tricia!

This is extremely good! I've tried many potato salads and this one is by far the best! I will continue to use this as my go to recipe. I followed the directions to a T. My husband likes a cold potato salad so I served this as such -I would prefer the hot salad, but it is just as delicious cold. Plus, no mayo means it can sit out for awhile longer if using at a picnic. :) A recipe worth submitting, thanks!!!

I have had german potato salad from the deli at my local grocery store and didn't enjoy it very much.  I however can't get enough of this potato salad.  I never thought I'd see the day when a sauce was made with bacon grease.  And there is just the right amount of vinegar to give it a slight tang, instead of the salad tasting like vinegar.  I love this recipe and will use it many times in the future.

My only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because there is definitely not enough sauce for all those potatoes.  I only cooked 6 potatoes because of other reviews.  I was only able to use 4 of them.  The flavor is amazing.  I will simply triple the sauce recipe in the future.  Really terrific salad!

A friend brought this to a potluck baby shower and I had to get the recipe so that I could have more!  I just used real bacon bits and sauteed them with the onions.  I probably added more like 1/2 cup vinegar since I love vinegar so much!

This is the closest I've seen to what my mom used to make. Absolutely love it! The only difference how I make it is that I up the bacon to 1lb. for a dozen potatoes. I also like it a little more tart so I increase the vinegar and decrease the sugar by a quarter. Sauteing the onions in the bacon fat adds to the flavor and makes the sauce stick to the potatoes better. I also cut back on the salt a bit. Still this is totally YUMMY! I rarely have enough for leftovers.

This was so much better the 2nd day - after a night of soaking up the liquid. I followed others and doubled the liquid ingredients - very happy with the results.

Great recipe!  Never made German potato salad before but was making it for a friend who was born in Munich and to serve at an Oktoberfest.  He said it was like he remembered as a child growing up in Germany.  The only thing I changed was I used med. sized red potatoes that weren't peeled.  Not peeling them saved me a lot of time, especially since I changed the recipe to serve 25 people.  It came out great!  Everyone loved it.  Since I made such a large amount, I mixed the potatoes and sauce in 2 different bowls so that I didn't damage the potatoes and combined them after they were mixed. I would totally recommend trying this recipe.  Thank you to the publisher!

I like this to be a little more saucy, so I added just a little extra water and used just a little less potato. I also added an additional piece of bacon, but I'm thinking 2 extra pieces of bacon would  be perfect.

Yummmmm!  My two mistakes: cooking the potatoes for too long (they were somewhat mushy), and realizing I didn't have any kind of vinegar except balsamic.  Even with these two elements, the dish was delicious.  Otherwise, I prepared according to instructions using regular Idaho potatoes.  I added some chopped green onions on top for color.  Thanks for the recipe!!

The BEST german potato salad recipe! Just like the one I remeber my german relatives making when I was young.  We like it "saucy" so I double the sauce.

I really liked this recipe!  The only change made was omitting the salt, as the bacon adds enough saltiness. I'll be making it often.

Good stuff!  I used extra bacon and one less potato.  Definitely cut back on the salt, 2 t was too much especially since bacon is already salty.

Loved the taste but only one complaint...I would halve the sugar next time.  Too sweet for my taste- but I like a bit of a pucker when I take a bite of my salad.

This was my first time eating, let alone making German Potato Salad...so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It was good, but a little too sweet for my liking.  My kids liked it, but echoed my sentiments.

I will definitely make it again...only next time I will use little/no sugar.

Thanks for sharing the recipe. :)

Just needed extra vinegar when used on new potatoes that were on the sweet side. Good method, better then an old recipe I've used for years.
Glad it was available.

i love this recipe. i don't care how you feel about potato salad you must try this one. a lot of people raise their eyebrows when they think of vinegar in potato salad, but it works!  my mother used to make this when we were younger and this is about as close to it that i have found.  even she loves it. i tend to just use a whole package of bacon.  everything is better with bacon and I double the sauce ingredients.  potatoes soak up a lot of sauce.

try it.  you will not be disappointed!  thanks for the recipe.

I was a bit nervous serving this to my family - different for potato salad here.  My son who does not like cold salads, loved it!  I thought it was quite tasty too.  I have a tendency to cook without tasting (smelling is a different story) and tweeking recipes even on the first time.  Because I have never had this in any shape or form, I followed directions exactly as printed.  Very good with rave reviews from the entire family.  Will make again and again.

This was just what I was looking for!  I cubed the potatoes before boiling to speed up the process.  Added 2 cloves garlic to the onions.  Added 1tsp djion to the end and a few sprigs of fresh thyme.  I also used apple cider vinegar b/c I was out of white vinegar and it was great.  Thanks for a keeper!

This was awesome--just like my mom used to make. I ended up making a double batch to fully cover the potatoes. I made these ahead of time and put them in a casserole pan and warmed them up before serving. I can't wait to make these again.

This is, by far, the BEST German Potato Salad I've ever made or had.  I was quite pleased with this recipe- and so was my German friend!!  

I did, though, like many others, make more of the "sauce.  I doubled all the sauce ingredients and it was absolutely delicious!!

Thank you for the recipe!

His,
Mrs. U

I wasn't expecting to like this.  I grew up in a german household and never really cared for hot "kartoffel salat".  I decided to give this a try due to such high ratings. WOW!  It was UNBELIEVEABLY good!  FAR better than what my mom  used to make.  I think the difference is in the flour used in the recipe.  Also, the addition of bacon made it really outstanding.  In fact, I didn't care about any other part of dinner than this!  Even my children loved it. Thank you so much, this is a FANTASTIC recipe I will be using over and over again!

Fabulous! I used half the potatoes but the same amount of sauce. The whole family loved it.

I have made this before and I just cannot stop eating it! I like it after it has been in the refrigorater just as well as hot.
I really recommend this recipe.

VERY good!  I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved!  I used about 5 med sized white potatoes, and they worked great.  My husband thought there was a little too much of a celery flavor, so I will cut back on the celery seeds next time.  I loved it though, and will definitely be adding this to my list of regulars!

Good recipe, I used 4 large baking potatoes and left out the celery seed. Next time I make it I will still use 4 baking potatoes but I will double everything else to make it a 5 star recipe (we like a lot of bacon and vinegar flavor)

Ok Im revising this review because of a recent experience. Last night my boyfreind and I spent the night at a ritsy hotel and dined in their restaraunt. They had an entire german section on their menu. He loves german food and ordered this potatoe salad as a side. What he got in the restaraunt was IDENTICAL to what we have when I make this recipe. Whe talked to the waiter about it only to find that the german section of the menu had been puchased from a german family restaraunt that sold out and some of the german staff including the head chef was preparing this food for the meal we had. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!
I made this recipe for my boyfriend after he had it at a German fest. I followed the recipe to the letter and didn't change a thing. We both loved it! He has been begging me to make it again. I found it to be alot of work but very worth it.

I'm not a big fan of German Potato Salad, but my hubby is.  I was in a hurry and  made the mistake of buying the cooked, presliced potatoes in the bag.  It was not good!  I'll give it another try  but next time I'll use fresh potatoes.

Good!  Kind of dry.  I doubled the sauce as other's suggested.  I left the vinegar as stated in recipe and my husband and I thought it could have used more.  Good overall.

Like many others, I doubled the roux for this wonderful potato salad; however, I don't think it needs a roux at all.  I also used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  This was a big hit in our house.

Very good, but I would cut down on the vinegar just a little bit next time.  I brought it as a side dish to a potluck Oktoberfest, and it disappeared quickly!

Love, love, LOVE german potato salad!  I doubled the sauce for this recipe and add thinly sliced radishes for color and taste, roughly 1/3 of a cup.  I also add sliced hard boiled egg, 1 or 2 of them depending on the amount of salad I make.

Oh so good.  I did make some changes,.  Substituted powdered onion for regular onions (hubby doesn't like them), apple cider vinegar instead of white, 1 tablespoon honey instead of white sugar.  Also Added a touch of parsley and mustard powder.  I really liked the tartness. It tasted like my moms but maybe a bit creamier.  Will definitely be on our list of regulars.

This was a very good recipe. I reduced the recipe in 1/2.  None of the flavors was overpowering and all blended together nicely.  I always microwave my bacon, so I just scraped the grease into a small frying pan to begin to saute the onions and all worked out well.  I also reduced the time of cooking the potatoes to about 25 min.

Terrific!  I make this for all my family get togethers, including kids' parties.  I do prefer it without the celery (I've made it both ways).   I usually use fewer potatoes than the recipe calls for, and there is always plenty to go around. I also add a bit more bacon if I have it on hand.

I loved the potato salad. I omitted the celery seed because I didn't have any but other than that it was really good. I added a lit more sugar to cut the tartness of the vinegar a little. My boyfriend loved it. Will definitely make again.

These take work, but they're definitely worth the effort. Very flavorful and unique. I usually either double the sauce or decrease the potatoes by about half.

I made this last night for dinner along with some smoked sausage. It was wonderful. My step mom is german and this recipe was better than hers! We loved it! I used thick cut peppered bacon and I added a few extra slices! I also used more water and vinegar than called for and I also used celery salt rather than seeds. It was terrific and I will definately keep this recipe around! Thank you!

I took this to an Octoberfest potluck and received numerous compliments.  I used 5 lbs of potatoes, having no idea how to figure out how much 9 potatoes weighed.  I did double the sauce, used 2 cups of chopped onion and 1 lb. of bacon.

This was my first time preparing and eating german potato salad.  I am glad I made it, it was very good.  I found the vinegar flavor was very strong.  It's probably supposed to be, but like I said, I had never had it before.

This salad was really good, and it went well with our German themed party last night. I followed the advice of other posters and doubled the sauce. I mixed up the potatoes earlier in the day, refrigerated them, then reheated and added the bacon. Nice make ahead dish. Every one enjoyed them.

Wow!  This was the best German Potato Salad!  I didn't have any potatoes, so I used a can of sliced potatoes that I rinsed really well.  They turned out to be a great time saver and they tasted great.  I also subbed apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar and it was really good, too.  I will definitely make this one again!

I like this stuff but it does seem like more work than regular potato salad. I made this exactly as written except, I don’t know why, it seemed like Apple Cider Vinegar was the thing to use instead of white. I also didn’t follow the method. I’m not one who terribly fat conscious but all that bacon grease seemed like too much. I did sauté the onions in it but then skimmed them out of the grease when they were done. I boiled my potatoes and made my hot dressing in the microwave. Heat dressing mixture on high for about a minute, and then stir. Heat another minute or so and it begins to thicken on the bottom. Stir again to distribute the thickened dressing through any that is still watery. It also thickens a little more as you are doing this. I thought this needed a double batch of dressing though. Maybe it was that I cooked my potatoes pretty soft and they soaked it up or maybe you do need all that bacon grease.

Exceptional! My husband and I prefer this to the mayo based salads. I made it for a group of friends from Georgia (they had only ever had southern style potato salad), and it was a hit. Good as cold leftovers too.

Excellent!  Rave reviews!  One suggestion: I doubled the amount of sauce for the potatoes, since it soaked in after a while.  All-in-all... my family said that they definitely won't mind, at all, if I make that again sometime in the near future (I guess that's a hint).

My dad said that it tasted like the kind his German grandma used to make!  It did turn out a little dry - it needed more sauce or less potatoes.

I added like 1 more TB of flour, and a few more strips of bacon and almost a cup of vinegar.   (Have to taste the vinegar to me)
But everyone loved it.
 Will be definitely be making this recipe again.

Fabulous! I use Red potatoes if I have them but I've made it with Russet as well.  ***TIP ***make sure you stop boiling the potatoes when they are still firm or they will fall apart when slicing and stirring. Also I put mine in a colander and run cold water over them or they will continue to cook if left in the hot water.  Really good as is but easy to tweak if you like extra sauce or more vinegar...

Loved it. I only had precooked bacon which didn’t  produce enough grease. Used about 10 slices. Had to add 2T butter to get the roux set. It turned out great.

Good but not what I remember from my Aunt Elfriede.  Was a little bland and dry.   Maybe soaking longer as others have suggested would help.

Very good!  I didn't have bacon so diced some smoked sausage.  Also didn't have celery seed so used celery salt.  We really enjoyed it.

I would suggest  a slight variation to the Recipe. Use boiled red potatoes that are allowed to cool down after cooking and then skinned. Allow the bacon fat to cool down and then add a small portion for the dressing mixture of mayo, vinegar, sugar and small dab of sweet spicy German mustard. Do not heat this dressing. I would also recommend adding chopped boiled eggs, chopped pickles and chopped celery to the potato salad.

This is a favourite. A regular side dish when we eat pork & my favourite potluck dish to make. It's always eaten up with nothing left to clean up & easy to make with inexpensive, on hand ingredients.

This is very close to the German potato salad I used to make,  then lost the recipe.   The changes I  made were to add about 1 tsp of ground mustard,  and since I love the dressing so much, I double upon the ingredients and triple to quadruple the bacon (because the only thing better than bacon is more bacon). It freezes well,  but the potatoes get a bit mushy when reheated,  so the texture is almost like a very chunky mashed potato salad.

Made this dish for my sons high school basketball banquet, was so well received that by the time I went through the line it was already gone.  Used redskin potatoes 5 lb. bag, sliced potatoes thick and boiled till partially cooked. Doubled the sauce ingredients, substituting apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar. Cooked in oven covered, one hour at 350.

I use apple cider vinegar and a T dijon in my dressing.  If you can get them, it is great to use kipferl  potatoes, also known by most as banana potatoes. They are small and waxy, hold their shape and easy to peel after cooking.  My MIL was Austrian and this was what she taught me.  RIP Rosie bussi.

My daughter had to take a cultural dish to school to share with her class.  We chose this recipe and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe! Fun to connect to our German heritage.  We used russet potatoes and 1/8 t. celery salt because I didn't have celery seed.  I diced the potatoes before boiling and boiled for only 10 minutes which was more than enough time.  Yummy!

This was fine.  If I were making it for dinner, perhaps it would've been great, but for a party, it wasn't the best choice.  I spent far too much time during the party trying to coordinate this so it would still be hot.  Ended up with good flavor, but kind of gluey (I used red potatoes).  Won't likely make it again because we don't eat a lot of potato salad, but for another person, this might be great.

I made it last night. I substituted a pound of Italian sausage for the bacon, milk for the water and didn't use flour. Yum!!! Everyone loved it!

The bacon I used was already pretty salty so I would recommend not adding any additional salt to the dry mix. I also wasn't crazy about the celery seed. It is a strong bite when you eat one, but overall it was really good.

This is a really nice change from the traditional mayo based potato salad. I didn't need to change a thing.

Yum! I pressure cooked unpeeled potatoes then let them cool slightly before slicing. I added some fresh parsley for color. The only change I would make is less vinegar and/or more sugar. It was perfect for me but a little vinegary for most!

Took this to Christmas dinner and everyone had 2nds.    
I  reserved the potato water,  used some to cook a pkg. of cut green beans which  I also stirred into the potatoes.   If you like sweet and sour green beans this will work for you.    The rest of the potato water will go with the rest of the leftovers for soup tonight.

I have made this recipe numerous times. My only change is, I cut up the red potatoes before boiling them. It is the best potato dish my family has ever had. My hubby and son ask for it daily, lol. But we don't really have it that often,  just a few times a month and on holidays!

I had never made German Potato Salad before so wasn't sure what to expect.  Turned out great.  A nice side dish with a different taste that I will make a little more often.  Goes great with chops or brats.  I liked the suggestion of using an egg slicer to cut the potatoes.

Loved this! Only thing I did different was to use 6 medium potatoes and about 3/4lb of bacon ends from the local farm market...fraction of the price and in my opinion works better than  just crumbling a few slices.

Delicious! Suggest that it is served immediately. 
I used red wine vinegar and BC balsamic salt. Next time I will try balsamic vinegar if using sea or regular salt. Adds a touch more flavour.

I made this as a side dish that was a little "something different."  My fiance' loved it!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used cider vinegar.  I used unpeeled red potatoes and loved the flavor and texture, but my egg slicer (as suggested by a second reviewer) kept getting gunked up, so it was just easier to do a quick slice by hand.  I agree with a third reviewer, as well, in that I'll make extra dressing next time.  As careful as I was, I ended up mashing some of my potatoes to get coverage with the dressing.

This is a great dish. If you want to make a more salad-like version of this you can switch out the onions with garlic and add some parsley. Also, next time I make this I will double the amount of the sugar/vinegar mixture, as I thought that the quantity called for in the recipe was not enough for the amount of potatoes.

It's a good basic recipe. Not outstanding. Needs something to balance it out, less vinegar I think. Also this isn't very pretty ( I know most of you don't care about how it looks but it does leave something to be desired). Pepper is needed.

Delicious! Just what I was looking for, tasted just like the potatoes I had in a Fredericksburg TX German restaurant. I didn't use celery seed and used peeled and sliced red potatoes (about 6 big ones). Will make again for sure. Served with Reuben sandwiches and pickled shoestring beets-yum!

Great recipe! Although, it needs more sauce or less potatoes. I also added more bacon and celery seed and 1/2 tsp of Caraway seeds. My family loved this with brats or German sausage. It all depends on taste as to adding more vinegar or less. We like the sweet/tart combination. AND it does need to be served hot! Will not serve well cooled down, because of the bacon and grease. Excellent recipe to start off with a German dinner.

I made this to go with schnitzel the other night for dinner. It was easy to make and absolutely delicious! There's nothing in this recipe that you probably don't already have at home and it makes such a flavorful and delicious accompaniment to a meal. This will definitely be going in my rotation of recipes I make regularly.

Tastes EXACTLY like my mother used to make - absolutely perfect!!! Only changes I made were to use more bacon and I substituted the celery seed with celery salt because I didn't have seed in the house.

MMM, MMMM, MMMMMMM!!!!!! I made this for my family who loves German Potato Salad and they RAVED about it. Doubled the 'sauce' ingrediants because we like it juicy and I added a sprinkle of dill for some extra flavor because we have had it that way before. Will make this again for sure.

This is a great potato salad if you're looking for something different than the traditional potato salad with mayonnaise.  I like the mix of the slight vinegar flavour and the bacon.  I made it exactly as the recipe outlined and it was simple but yummy.   It has been a hit at many BBQs and potlucks!

I love this recipe and have made it many times since finding it here on Allrecipes; it tastes even better the next day. Love it cold too. This recipe reminds me of my first "true love" boyfriend and his mother made this. However, she added hard boiled eggs which I also do. Brings back fond memories both of taste and boyfriend. My husband loves it too and yes, I told him about my boyfriend's mother but not necessarily about my boyfriend. ;)

The flavor was fabulous - though I might make a little more sauce next time to coat the potatoes more.  And I WAY overcooked my potatoes so the end result was a bit on the mushy side.  Still yummy, though!

As I have never tried German potato salad I didnt have a flavor palet to judge by.  I was a bit scared of the ingredients, but the final product was good.  I cant say it was great because I wasnt mpressed with the flavors, however my Boy friend said it tasted just as he remembered it should.

As a german potato salad, it was good made as directed.  The big surprise, however, was finding out how tasty the leftovers are when fried up nice and crisp as a breakfast side.  I would make this again just to get the german-style homefries!

This is a very good recipe.  It gets 4.5 stars as written.  I used half the potatos called for because it was just the 2 of us.  Definitely use reds.  Did not halve the sauce ingredients as suggested by others.  The next time I make it I will increase the sauce ingredients even more because my husband compares every German Potato Salad recipe I make, to the canned version, because that is his fav.  This recipe is really a wonderful fresh version of that.  We both really liked it. I will never have to eat the canned again!

Yum. I have used this recipe now about 4 times, and I love it!  Small changes that I make are to add two TBSP chopped green onions toward the end of cooking for enhanced color, and I use 1 tbsp only of chopped real bacon bits (instead of fresh bacon) to simplify.  I also do not use the celery seeds.  Both white and apple cider vinegar work well.  Easy and delicious!

I made this last year for our Octoberfest Party and was asked to bring it again.  I did make one mistake in the recipe,that I will repeat.  I used 3/4 cups of cider vinegar and 1/3 cup of water. That was a great Oops.  I also used red potatoes and left the skins on for ease of preparation.  I kept it warm in my slow cooker. It was a perfect side for the brats the host served.

This turned out very well despite the fact that I messed up on following the directions.  I didn't change the ingredients though -- it was great and everyone loved it.  Was a nice complement to my roast pork.  I will make this again!

Good flavor, but more specifics would definitely help. I made it without reading many reviews the first time. This is the second time...

DEFINITELY use waxy potatoes. I tried russets the first time and they fell apart. Used white rose this time and they fell apart, too. I'll try reds next time, as well as not boiling for 30 minutes.

And I agree with another reviewer that the sauce-to-potato ratio is low. I only used 7 small-medium sized potatoes with this batch, and had I used 9, there would not have been enough sauce.

Excellent!  I didn't have celery seed, so I used celery salt (and cut back on the other salt), and it was great.  My husband said it rivaled the Hot German Potato Salad at our favorite local German Restaurant!

This is an amazing recipe...everyone in my family loves it.  The only thing is that I make a lot more sauce so that the salad is moist and not dry.  Instead of celery seed I use whole mustard seed.  And, I never add flour.

This potato salad was perfectly tangy and I could not stop myself from eating it.  I didn't have celery seed on hand but the sauce ended up tasting great anyway.  Make sure to double the sauce!

Great recipe, served with porkchops and slaw.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Probably will only use 7 large potatoes next time.

I've never tasted flavors like this together in a potato salad.  I really liked it!  I took the recommendations on changing the size on the potatoes and upping the sauce.

This recipe tastes very close to the one my grandma used to make.  I loved it!  I, too, will double the sauce for next time.  It didn't make enough to generously coat all of the potatoes.  I am looking forward to making this again!  Thank you!

When I first took a bit I thought it was a bit too sour...but after a few mouthfuls I quite liked it.  My 15 year old step-son loved it and wondered if I could fry the potatoes and use for a breakfast dish.  May be....we'll see.

I wasn't a fan of these. I cooked the potatoes 30 minutes as indicated, they were too mushy. Doubled the sauce, that was a good thing. But, I didn't really like them as much as I thought I would, from reading all the reviews. I won't make again

I found this recipe a year ago to use up potatoes and have a side with brats different from regular potatoe salad. My husband and children LOVE it especially the vinegar taste, more authentic.  So, it's a regular in our home now with the minor tweaks: double sauce (not the vinegar), used small potatoes so 8-9 seems right especially since my kids like cooked potatoes plain. Great side dish!

This was the first time in 35 years that I had this type of dish and I loved it.  Loved everything about it! I did take the advice of some of the others and used red potatoes and I left the skin on.  I did not use quite as many potatoes as called for but make the same amount of "sauce" and it was great!  I am so very happy I found this recipe because I was told that I would not like this type of potatoes salad and the only thing I can think of why they would say that is because of the vinegar. But I really liked the vinegar taste with the bacon and the other seasonings. If you do not like vinegar then try not using it but the taste will be different. You could try cutting the amount in half but remember -- whatever the amount of vinegar is that you may take away -- you need to add water.

Made this for my husband's German inspired birthday.  It was a hit!  He said that it tasted just like the salad a friend's Grandmother from Germany used to make when they were kids.  I made the recipe as is, except that I used a frying pan that was too small and had to add bacon shreds to the pan, then drizzle over a bowl of potatoes and mix that way.  It was still warm and delicious.

I rarely give recipes five stars unless they are really something special...this is! It is so deliciously unique, unlike anything I can remember eating...and addictive, too. I found myself going back for a bite here, a bite there...anyway, this is a unique recipe, so if you're looking for traditional potato salad this isn't it. I served this with grilled brats and beer on a hot day, so yummy. Only tip: DOUBLE the sauce recipe, no matter how many potatoes you use! Also, the recipe calls for far too many potatoes...I doubled the sauce and still left some potatoes out because the sauce wouldn't cover them all (I used medium-small yellow potatoes). Thanks for a very delicious and authentic recipe!!!!

I love the flavor of this potato salad and my husband eats almost all of this by himself when I make it.  I did modify the recipe a bit by using 2/3 cup white balsamic vinegar instead of 1/3 cup vinegar.  I also added chopped up green onions at the very end because we just  like the onion flavor and it adds a little color.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe minus having 1 less piece of bacon, so when it got to the point of sauteing the onions and adding the flour mixture, I added about 1/2 TBSP of butter in place of some of the bacon grease.  Reminds me of my friend's Grandmothers recipe, and she's from Germany!

not huge into german cooking so i gave it a try...i think that the amount of vinegar is excessive it takes away and from and over powers the dish. other than that it wasn't bad but not great.

Excellent. Made this for July 4th BBQ and it is really delicious. I would have given it 5 stars accept I had to make more sauce to cover the potatoes adequately. The flavor is perfect though. Also I used apple cider vinegar as it was I had and it turned out so good. With the extra amount of sauce-its perfect.

I just made this last night, and it got rave reviews from all at the table.  I didn't have to change a thing, this is perfect as it is.  I can't wait to make it again.  This will be my new favorite side dish to bring to a party or family gathering.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I really like this! I have never tried German potato salad before. I don't know how German potato salad is supposed to be, but I thought that it would be better if there was more sauce for the amount of potatoes.

We really liked this warm potato salad!  It was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  Perfect side dish for brats & kraut!  It's a great alternative to roasted potatoes on the grill!

My whole family loves this recipe! I've made this recipe "as is" numerous times and always get great reviews.  A great alternative to "regular" potato salad.  Definitely better served warm, so if you have any leftovers (I rarely do), be sure to reheat them before serving.

This was fabulous.  I made the salad using an assortment of baby potatoes and let the potatoes cook in the vinegar dressing for a while to make sure all the water was out of them and the dressing got in.  This was better than I could have expected.  As a note, I didn't have any celery seed in the house so I just cooked some diced celery with the onions.  This is an awesome summer potato salad.

For me, this turned out very dry but still good.  However, I believe that may be because the recipe doesn't specify the type of potato, and the russet potatoes I used were fairy big.  Also, after I fried the bacon, it just didn't look like I had enough residual grease to make a dressing, so I even doubled the bacon, and still didn't have enough moisture for the amount of potatoes.  This may be because of the brand of bacon I used.  For these reasons, I am still giving this 4 stars.  Side note:  a couple of days after, we took the leftovers and added some mayonnaise to spruce it back up.  The potatoes had soaked in the flavor from the dressing, and it was doubly delicious!

This was awesome!  I wanted to make a potato salad that I didn't have to chill.  I followed the recipe as stated with a few shortcuts (pre diced onions and real bacon bits) with the exception of the omitting the sugar and substituting splenda.  I will definitly make it again.

Tastes just like the potato salad my mom learned to make from her German grandma. As long as you're not expecting it to be anything like traditional American potato salad, you won't be disappointed.

For those who don't like the cold salads heaping with egg, this is your recipe.  I add more bacon, 1/3 cup beef stock and use green onions instead of white.  Fantastic!

very good side dish when served with beer/brats, used double the amount of bacon and added balsamic vinegar instead of the white.

We quartered our potatoes and decided to add more sugar to the mixture as I think the recipe left it more on the salty side. We also didn't have fresh bacon and used prepared bacon bits and shortening.  I'm sure it would rock with real bacon, though!  I added a hard boiled egg to the mix just to add a little protein.

This was good, although it had sat overnight in the fridge, so it wasn't as creamy looking as in the picture.  When I make it again, it will be when I can enjoy it immediately.

The flavor of this salad is nice. Using the bacon fat put me off a little, but that's probably why the flavor was so good! I served this warm, but I also enjoyed eating it cold the next day.

It's amazing how food can bring back such great memories.  I made this for Memorial day dinner.  As soon as I put it all together, the smell of it made me cry because it reminded me of my Oma that would make this when she would visit from Germany.  This recipe is fantastic.

Good recipe, but I thought it was missing something... green onions for color? The taste was good, I tripled the recipe for a potluck for work- it was really easy to make, and you don't have to worry about refrigeration as much as w/ a mayo-based recipe.  I thought that there were a bit too many celery ceeds, but I might have put in too many. Just beware to watch the ingredients you put in and you should be fine.  My German husband said that what he remembers, is that his grandmother's sauce wasn't as thick, but this recipe tasted good and he liked it.

I will admit, I was a bit wary of this recipe, since I generally hate potato salad. I needed to use up some potatoes, though, and I figured it was different enough from the potato salads that come in plastic boxes that I might like it.   I LOVED IT, it tasted great as a side when we had grilled steak, and it was just as good reheated the next day.  The only mod I made was to leave out the celery seed, but that's only because we didn't have any.

This is really a very good recipe.  As written, 4 stars, but made with only 7 potatoes instead of 9, I would give it 5 stars (with more potatoes I don't think there's quite enough "sauce" because it soaks in over time).  I've made it many times, tinkering with the vinegar amounts, the onions, bacon, etc.....but I just made it again as written (but with 7 potatoes) and it's perfect.  Try it!

This is pretty good. My husband was impressed and said he could eat this every night. I only give it four stars, because I think it needs a little more of the water/vinegar mixture.

My family loved this salad.  I liked it because it did not taste too greasy.  Thank you for posting.

Flavor was good, but need to make like twice the sauce for it to be wet enough -- way too dry otherwise.  I had to go back and remake another batch of sauce for the potatoes to be covered.

This was so good. I did like other reviewers did and used 8 red potatoes, the small to medium size. It was the perfect amount. I also didn't have any celery seed so I didn't use that . I will be making this dish on a regular basis!

I guess I've never had "real German" potato salad! This was SO good!! It was definately different than anything I've tried, but I loved it!! I did add about 1/4c of sour cream for the creaminess. That probably changed it completely. However, we loved it! We'll definitely make it again!

Loved that it was hot.  However for me, the vinegar taste was too strong.   My good friend who is 85 years old and of German descent loved it!  Next time I will lighten up a tad on the vinegar and see if I like it better.

I absolutely love this recipe! I make it at least once a week. My entire family eats it gone, and when we have people over I have to make 2 or 3 batches because it goes so quick. I would also suggest red skin potatos they're just easier to work with. also DO NOT use large potatos because I made the mistake of using large potatos the first time I made this and the sauce just turned into a thick paste. If you like the potato salad to have more saucey consistency I would use less than nine potatos.

We really loved these potatoes.  I reduced the vinegar a bit, but I think I'll use the full amount next time, as I enjoyed the flavor more than I expected.  Had no celery seed, so I substituted a bit of celery salt, and cut back the salt in the dish.  These disappeared fast.

Really yummy! Only a couple modifications.  I added some cut up slices of ham to the onion fry mix. Then after slicing up the potatoes I browned them in a little EVOO.  Then added them to the sauce.  (had to add a little bit more water to the sauce too)
Taste just like an authentic fried potatoe/bacon/ham dish we used to eat while stationed and living in Weilerbach Germany.

Excellent recipe! I didnt realize I was our of white vinegar when I started so I had to sub red wine vinegar in its place. Fantastic, the little critics in the house gave it about 3 stars but that to be expected when using vinegar. Awesome I will make again. Served with Wiener Schnitzel for a perfect true German meal.

I have never made German Potato salad before, but I had it as a child since my grandparents were German.  I liked this recipe, but the next time I make it I will eliminate the starch.  I prefer the potatoes to be clean rather than pasty.  The flavor was good.  I cut back on the salt by adding just 1 tsp.  Next time I will add 1.5 tsp.  Thans for the recipe.

I think you REALLY must like the taste of vinegar and celery seed to enjoy this (and perhaps all) german potato salad. I followed the recipe exactly but added the boiled apple at the end as on reviewer suggested. My husband enjoyed that added element of sweetness.  
In my opinion, if you like vinegar I'm sure you'll enjoy this recipe BUT if your looking for a recipe to solve your "I've got lots of potatoes" problem, I'd go with a recipe that has less pungent ingredients.

Delicious! Took this to an International Dinner at my son's high school and the German teacher loved it!  I used medium sized potatoes and added a little more bacon.  Really good!

This was really good and easy to do- I made a few changes, I used some chopped up turkey kielbasa instead of bacon, and used broccoli and garlic as well as the onions. I've never had a hot potato salad before, but I like it.

My DH and I loved this recipe.  I used caramelized onions I already had in the fridge, and some beef bacon (I live in a Muslim country, so I can't get pork - it's very lean and looks and tastes nothing like real bacon, but it's smoky and delicious nevertheless).  It was excellent.  Thanks for a great new way for me to make potato salad!

This is an awesome recipe!  I have made it twice now.  I found that 3 pounds of potatoes and twice the sauce is perfect.  "9 potatoes" is far too vague.  We love bacon so I used a whole pound.  I also added a splash more vinegar like some suggested.  Very good!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I loved how the vinegar and celery seed combine for that one-of-a-kind aroma.  The only change I made was I sliced my potatoes before boiling, so I had more of a "mashed" version as a final product.  Great job!

Good basic recipe, but the amount of water is slightly too much. Even so, it tastes better if the water is replaced with apple juice! Also, scatter some sliced scallions on top for color and crunch.

I made this for a 4th of July party & it received several compliments. Perfect for a grill out because there is no mayo in the recipe. Next time I may make a little more of the sauce but I will definitely make again. Delicious!!

I tried this recipe as a side dish for our 4th of July BBQ. It did not dissappoint, it was delish!

I boiled and sliced unpeeled small red potatoes and doubled the sauce.

This recipe is wonderful! I made this for a fourth of July party since it is healthier than traditional mayonaise based potato salad. It was the hit of the party! Everyone loved it, and the only thing I added was 1 tsp of dried rosemary. This is an excellent recipe that I will be making again and again!

Very good! I followed the recipe almost exactly. My only changes were to saute one rib of chopped celery with the onions (since I didn't have celery seed on hand), and I used 4 extra slices of bacon, which I chopped up before frying. I find that the bacon looks better when it's chopped and not crumbled and broken.  Brought it to a 4th of July picnic and not a slice of potato was left!

This salad struck my fancy because it doesn't contain mayo and it has bacon. I used a few extra slices in mine, I also sprinkled green onions on top. My boyfriend even liked it, and he hates vinegar. He put some sour cream on top, making it more baked potatoish. Great flavors! I will for sure make it again in the future.

Very tasty, I had some extra spices to kick it up.  We enjoy something with more kick, so I suggest a little cayenne if you have it on hand!

I really liked this German Potato Salad.  I have been trying to find one like my Grandma used to make.  This is the closest so far.

This recipe was great. My whole family loved it. I doubled the recipe and add more vinegar than water. I will be using this recipe again.

Very disappointed with this recipe. Had very high expectations. My sauce ended up looking like paste. Became unsalvageable other than adding some Italian dressing to make it edible.

I REALLY wanted to like this dish.  I doubled the sauce like most recommended and it ended up tasting too vinegary.  No one ate it as it was.  I think I will try it again without doubling the sauce.

This is an awesome recipe. The only change I made was to use gold petite potatoes. Everyone in my family loved, only had a tiny bit for leftovers the next day and it was even better then! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was wonderful! I did double the bacon and the sauce ingredients as suggested. I also added about a cup of onions and used apple cider vinegar. I did not use the celery seed (personal preference) And it was perfect!

Fantastic, and quite authentic.  I don't think extra sauce is necessary, but I do like to add some extra bacon.  Letting it sit a full day before serving makes it even better.  Thanks for the new favorite!

This salad was great. I didn't have a package of bacon, so I used about a cup and a half of bacon bits, and I also used less vinegar.

allthough the sauce was delicious it wasn´t enough for all the potatoes and I felt they were too hard still so I baked them in a cacerole for like 30 min in the oven, turned out better.

I made this for a potluck luncheon at work and it turned out better than I thought it would. I did substitute the white vinegar with white wine vinegar which turned out quite nicely. I also added some green onions at the end for some color and added flavour. I'll be making this one again!

I have made this recipe so many times now and it is always a big hit. The first time I followed the directions EXACTLY and it was quite delicious. Each successive time I have added or decreased items (usually doubling the sauce) and it still works. My German friends give it two thumbs up for authenticity and flavor.

Good stuff, and EASY!  I used 7 red skin potatoes (skin on) and the sauce was just right to coat everything.  I do not like celery seed, so I used chopped celery instead.  I also used a bit more bacon than called for.   It was a nice side dish.

This was okay, I have had a better version of this recipe at a friends house.  It tasted a lot like a recipe my mom would make for breakfast but frying the potatoes.  I don't think there was enough vinegar in the recipe.

It sure is good to have a website like this to look up new recipes to try.  I appreciate the reviews too.

I'm not a real big fan of German Potato Salad, but I made this because my husband likes it.  This was a good recipe.  I read some of the reviews before I made it.  I used less potatoes than the recipe called for and used 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 distilled vinegar, because of the comments about which kind to use.  It seemed just right.

This recipe was very tastey- excellent flavor. My inner German wouldn't let me use white vinegar- I had to use apple cider vinegar. It was a little on the dry side, so I will definitely follow the suggestion of some others next time and double the amount of rue, but other than that, it was superb.

More bacon than called for and used red, white and blue skinned baby potatoes, I'm not sure that I like the consistancy but quests sure did.

I thought this was pretty good, but a little tart. I didn't have any bacon on hand to use so I am sure that makes a difference.

This was my first time making German Potato Salad and it was wonderful! I had to add more sugar than it calls for to cut the acid of the amount of vinegar and it worked beautifully. Everyone loved it at my Oktoberfest party. I will be making this again.

We made this for an Oktoberfest party and it went over very well.  I used 3 pounds of red potatoes and used 1/4 cup of cider vinegar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted great.  No leftovers!

This was an excellent variation of the typical mayonnaise based potato salad. I took the advice of some others and added more onion and more bacon; I also doubled the sauce as was suggested and added a bit more celery seed as it is such a flavorful addition to this dish. I made mine with standard Idaho potatoes, but I think I'll try it with some quartered baby red potatoes next time. This one's a definite keeper!

I've never had German Potato Salad before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  I doubt I will make this recipe again but it was good for a German themed party. Everybody at the party really enjoyed the salad.  I also doubled the sauce and used apple cider vinegar.  I tasted it immediately after making the salad and the vinegar was very powerful.  After I drove to the party and dinner was served the flavor had toned down some and it tasted much better.

This is my "go-to" recipe for german potato salad. I've had to add more salt & pepper then the recipe calls for, but the amounts given are a good starting point.  I also subsitute celery salt for some of the regular salt because I don't have any celery seed.  I use red potatoes and either slice them or cuts them into 6ths after cooking. Reheats well too.

not bad, not great....kind of vinegary and the sauce was a bit thick and overwhelmed the taters...
