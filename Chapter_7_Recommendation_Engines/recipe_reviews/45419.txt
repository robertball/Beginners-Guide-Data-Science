very good, quick easy meal. I did not have turkey bacon on hand so I used very lean center cut bacon. I didn't see the point of using garlic powder and fresh garlic so I used 3 cloves of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, I also upped the basil, and added some oregano too. I am not a canned pea  person so I used frozen peas and cooked a few minutes longer.

Pasta the way it oughta be - fresh tasting and lightly dressed.  But...I used fresh, diced, red-ripe tomatoes,no garlic powder, no dried basil.  I used bright green, frozen peas, not bothering to cook them. I used regular bacon and found I needed to add some butter to the pasta at the end.  I didn't measure anything, just added and tossed till it was delicious and looked right.

I thought this recipe was great, but I did make a few additions to it.  I added:  1/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp cayenne red pepper and 1/4 tsp Coriander.  I added all the additional ingredients at the same time as with the garlic and basil.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I added 1 tsp of dried basil. Kids loved it.

I really enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures in this recipe.  Thought it was a nice change from the usual spaghetti/pasta sauce.  I followed the suggestion to use coriander and used parmesan cheese for a topping.  I also "swished" out the remaining tomato sauce in the can with a little wine and then added that to the sauce-gave it another flavor layer.

I liked this recipe.  It reminded me of something my mom used to make us growing up.  I've made it twice now but used my home grown tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I used regular bacon and I tossed it with rigatoni noodles instead of spaghetti.  Makes a a nice change for a pasta dish without being too heavy.  Thanks!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  To me the bacon flavor did not work with the sauce and the cheese didn't go flavorwise with the rest of the food.  I won't be making this again.

I didn't love this recipe.  It was sort of in-between...not too spicy, not bland, but couldn't really get a good taste out of it, everything just sort of blended together.  Not sure if that's at all helpful, but I'm not planning to make it again.

This was pasta dish was delicious, ....but PLEASE use (thawed) frozen peas, instead of peas from a can!  They taste like rotting garbage, and belong in a backyard mulch pile.

Cook the bacon first!!!  If bacon, onion and garlic cooked all at same time, the onion and garlic are burned by time bacon is cooked enough.  Deglaze with some red wine prior to adding tomato sauce.  This looks absolutely nothing like the picture, it's easy and tasty, but u may want to add to the fresh garlic if u love garlic.  I like it with diced tomatos instead of tomato sauce.

I have to say that this was an excellent blend of flavors! My picky 16 yo who seems to have an issue with almost any food I make came back from 2nd and 3rds and said 'this is really good Mom!'.  Nicely done--I will totally be making this again!

Made it with small elbow macaroni, real bacon real garlic delicious.  I will make it again, trying it with different pastas.  It was  quick & easy. The   serving size for 6 is a little stretch, I think, maybe with larger noodles.  We had it as a main and no sides, so we ate more or less a double serving.  The left overs were even better, letting flavours blend & age always improves. It was a good side for a steak, with a small portion for our dog, so we actually got 5 servings
Try it you'll like it,  best for a quick kids meal if you have them

I have done this one before. It is a good one since it uses pantry items that you can keep on hand. Sometimes I substitute a bag of frozen broccoli or asparagus for the peas.

Not our taste. Used frozen petite peas. The texture was not pleasing and it lacked flavor. Disappointed because peas are one of my families favorite veggies & had hoped to find something to incorporate peas into.

I used fettachini  noodles and I didn't have much tomato sauce so I had to add tomato paste with water instead. I added Italian spices to try and recreate a tomato sauce but I did't like it.

Easy recipe, very adaptable. Contrary to someone else's comment, I actually like when folks share the adjustments they make. We don't always have the exact same items on hand, and sometimes it's not convenient to go out just for that missing ingredient. I didn't have 30 oz of straight tomato sauce, but I did have pasta sauce on hand. Frankly, I think (even with the seasonings) that a pasta sauce is more flavorful. I didn't have turkey bacon but thoroughly fried out 6 slices of regular bacon, blotted off all the grease. Added some chopped hamsteak, too. Therefore, I didn't use any oil (just a quick drizzle) for sauteeing onion and garlic cloves. Also added some chopped broccoli and bell pepper.  
I kept the pasta separate and portioned into individual servings that I put in the freezer so I can pull out whenever needed for this or any other recipe.

Very quick and easy to make, I added black eyed peas instead of green peas and used a hickory smoked regular bacon I instead of Turkey. My kids and I loved it very much.

I used pork bacon for a proper bacon flavour, tinned tomatoes and tomato paste instead of tomato sauce for added richness, heaps of fresh garlic, and a whole chopped bunch of fresh basil. The recipe otherwise is too bland.

I make a similar version of this with a quick white sauce, but I use frozen peas. The frozen peas tend to be a little firmer.

Did not care for this recipe. Too many odd flavors  blending.
