We really enjoyed these potatoes! The vinegar was not too overpowering, which was nice. I did not have any tarragon on hand, so I omitted that. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

For my leftovers, I put some of the potatoes on a sheet of foil and topped with Kraft shredded Italian five cheese mix and let it melt in the oven. Cheesy, vinegary, garlicy and salty, they were even better this way. Cooking time may vary so keep an eye on your potatoes while theyâ€™re in the oven.
