My family wanted burgers tonight but I was not in the mood for a big beefy patty, so I found this recipe in my box, and thought I'd give it a go!  I thought it was great, such a nice alternative to meat!  I cut back some on the cumin, used a red bell pepper instead of orange and used fresh homemade bread crumbs.  The yogurt sauce is wonderful.  Sauteed some onions and mushrooms to have with these as well.  Good stuff!

LOVED these! They were a little crumbly, though, so the next time I puréed them with my immersion blender before baking and they held together much better. I don't like cilantro so I added a bit more parsley. I like the fact that they are baked and not fried, and that they are gluten free. This will definitely be a new staple in my cooking repertoire

Kinda of crumbly,  I didn't quite have enough of bread crumbs and I cooked the lentils to long I think. I also switched up the amounts for cayenne pepper and cumin. So it was pretty hot!
Need to double yogurt sauce.

These were yummy and easy to make. I didn't have enough cumin and they still turned out quite tasty.

Really nice recipe! Easy, healthy, and a great veggie main dish. Great served with roasted potatoes, and/or salad.

The only changes I made:
- I added the spices (cumin, cayenne, and some paprika too! You can also add curry or any other spice you like) into the pan with the onions to sautée them to bring out the flavours of the spices.
- I didn't include celery, because I don't like the flavour of celery. :-P 
- I didn't add all of the breadcrumbs into the mixture at once. I stirred them in bit by bit until the mixture was a good consistency (not too sticky, but not too dry), and ended up using ? of the total amount of breadcrumbs.
- I tried baking half of the patties, and fried the other half over medium heat in a small amount of oil (olive or sunflower seed oil both work). The fried patties were ready faster (I fried them for about 6 minutes on the first side, 3 minutes on the second side), but were a bit more oily than the baked patties.
- In the yogurt sauce, I also added half a clove of crushed garlic, a bit more lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

I'll definitely make this recipe again! I may try adding a couple of canned peeled tomatoes (drained and diced) to the lentil/vegetable mixture to add some more juiciness and flavour.

These are so good!! They save really well for leftovers too. Made them the first time with yogurt dipping sauce and it was good. The 2nd time I used them like hamburger and added provolone, turkey bacon, tomato and wheat pita. Wow, so much better! I also fried in tablespoon of coconut oil and that gave it a nice texture.

I made these by the recipe, but I did not make the yogurt sauce.  I think the fresh herbs really made it  special.  We served them on a good quality bakery bun (not a processed white roll) and added avocado instead of sauce.  I put together all the ingredients earlier in the day.  Then I formed the patties and cooked at mealtime.  I did cook longer because it started out cold from the fridge.  My son and I loved them, but my husband wasn't sure about the texture.  I will definitely make again. Delicious flavor!  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were great!  A little time consuming but worth it.  I've made different veggie burger recipes and have not been able to find one with a good consistency.  These aren't perfect but seem pretty good as far as thickness and texture and they do hold together okay.  I used less cumin and added a curry seasoning mix which really made this dish for me.  I also added Siracha to the topping which was great!  I had mine on lettuce leaves and my husband on Naan bread.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I put the burger between a slice of toasted whole-grain bread and added some guacamole and salsa. It was delicious.
