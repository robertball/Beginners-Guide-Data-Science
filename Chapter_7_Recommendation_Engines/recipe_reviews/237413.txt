I love this recipe, I have it every Tuesday and Thursday replaces my main meal. I followed the recipe the first time exactly. I added blue diamond almond milk vanilla original 60cal vanilla 80cal per cup also added unsweetened frozen Strawberries about 4 and finally about 1 1/2 teaspoon of Chia Seeds for omega's really just takes it to another level...

I was skeptical, but really didn't taste the kale. I used skim milk and almond extract instead of almond milk. I told my VERY picky 4 year old it was a pineapple milkshake and got him to drink some too.

We used frozen fruit and yogurt instead of milk and it was DELICIOUS.  My 11 year old daughter loved it too!

We amended the recipe and still, it was delicious! I was out of pineapple, so  used frozen mango chunks. Fearing it might be bitter, added a tablespoon of maple syrup. It was delicious!

First time using kale and loved it! Because I'm allergic to nuts, I used soy milk vs. almond milk. Tastes great and I would recommend this if you haven't ever tried kale before, you won't be disappointed!

I used this recipe to make freezer packs. Worked like a charm. This makes 2 really big cups if you are wanting to make a single smoothie, you would need to cut it in half. I have used orange juice and coconut milk and both make delicious smoothies.

I keep a stash of frozen bananas I use regularly with almond milk for a smoothie – had just purchased fresh pineapple (to get my husband to eat SOMETHING healthy) and had purchased kale simply because of its low calorie – high nutrition. So finding this recipe, I added fresh ginger and of course STEVIA – thank God stevia is so easy to access now in regular grocery stores.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a very tasty smoothie.  My husband even liked it and he is skeptical of these things.  I substituted spinach for the kale because it is what I had and it was delicious.  It does have a very strong banana flavor but I could still taste the pineapple.  I think when I make it again I will use coconut milk.  I definitely recommend it!

I'll admit, I'm a little scared of kale, but this smoothie was delicious. I never tasted the kale. I did freeze the kale in small pieces, so it blended in very well. I also added about 1/2 cup of greek yogurt for added protein. I will make this again and often.

Simple and good. I could use more kale and less pineapple to make healthier. I don't mind a bit of kale taste. This one had almost none because of sweetness.

I used a mix of baby spinach and kale, and I substituted frozen mango chunks for the pineapple because I didn't realize I was out of pineapple until I had started putting it together.  It was tasty!  I will definitely make this again soon!

Great taste! Be sure to remove kale stems before chopping. I tried frozen kale which included little pieces of stem. The smoothie was filled with tiny strings of it so I strained it through a colander. Definitely a lovely, refreshing smoothie.

I have made this smoothie every day for the past two weeks, I love it. Even my carnivorous hillbilly husband loves it. I have played around with it some- did 1 cup of frozen pineapple and 1/2 cup of frozen mango (which my Oster blender doesn't like, so I have to stick a long spoon down by the blade and loosen it up.) I also use two bananas for a two serving recipe. I also added a half of a container of Wegman's plain super yogurt. Very yummy!

I love the use of almond milk, vanilla almond milk is also great if you want added sweetness. Ripe FROZEN bananas will make this much creamer and spinach can also be used along with kale if you want a lighter green drink flavor. Overall great smoothie base to use with whatever fruit you have on hand; peaches, strawberries, mangos, raspberries, and blueberries are some of my faves!

I improvised with this a bit.  first of all I only had tinned pineapple and used soy milk.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I'm guessing I veered too far from the original recipe.  my kale seemed to stay flakey also, is that a poor blender or poor kale?

Instead of almond milk, I used half cup skim milk and half cup light vanilla soy milk.  The little bit of vanilla added a nice flavor.

I exchanged kale with spinach, overall not bad, although I think the almond milk gave it a strong flavor which I would change next time

If your looking to add some greens to a fruit smoothie this is definitely the way to go! I only had a bag of frozen pineapple & strawberries so that is what I used and reduced the almond milk to 3/4 cup and what an awesome treat!! You don't taste the kale at all, I bet my kids will love it too!

First off, I have a tendency to accidentally dress up recipes. This time I accidentally grabbed Almond Silk with vanilla. I don't keep sugar, artificial sweeteners or corn ingredients in my house (with a rare exception for limited organic options). This was a delicious, wake-me-up morning shake. Unfortunately, my kids wouldn't touch the "Shrek juice" (surprisingly- my toddler loves Boost Green Machine, Trader Joe's kale chips and roasted seaweed). I will have to try this again with plain kefir and add vanilla as I prefer a simpler ingredient list than what's on most almond milk.

Trying to talk my Love into drinking kale was NO easy task! But the apologies I got after he finally tried it were priceless... Great recipe for a kale introduction. Thanks!

Deliccious! I used Silk's Coconutmilk and FRESH pineapple and threw in some hemp protein along with the kale and banana. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I'm not really a kale fan. I know it's good for you so if I can get it in my diet by hiding it in something good, I'll try it! This is Amazing!! I added a tablespoon of honey to sweeten to perfection! You don't taste the kale,  just the fruity goodness. :) I've subbed spinach for the kale and coconut milk for the almond-delicious too!!
