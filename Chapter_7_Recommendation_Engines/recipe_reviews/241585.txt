Butter is not listed in the ingredients list and there is no specification of how much to use. I found 2 tbsp per cake worked passably for me but I also didn't have a large pan. Step 1 is poorly worded. Make sure to set aside half of ONLY the green onions and parsley into their own bowl and mix ALL the salt, pepper, and rosemary into the potatoes. The part about using a silicone turner needs to be bolded. My first batch burnt after 2-3 minutes, so I recommend ignoring the time suggestions and just wait for the golden crust.

Loved this.  I didn't have sour cream so I used greek yogurt with the mustard for the sauce.  It was delicious.  I also added cheddar cheese, and served with apple slices.

Making this for a brunch side dish for easter. I tested it tonight and it's easy to make and tastes delicious! Simple and bursting with flavor, the sauce on top is the perfect combo

This potato rosti is absolutely delicious! My 12 year old found this recipe and made them herself! They are very easy to make and a light side dish that we served with stuffed chicken and salad. We will definitely make them again!
