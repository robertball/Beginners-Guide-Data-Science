I made this for my husband and kids. It was pretty rich and tasty. I didn't exactly find it simple though as it was sticky and a bit messy to assemble. A word of caution: you honestly do not need that much honey. Next time I would maybe do more like a half cup.

These are delicious! I rolled them in different things to try them out (coconut, oats, wheat germ, coarse bran, chopped almonds and sprinkles).

My kids loved these and I dare adults to eat just one! It's a bit sticky so I added extra oats (about 1/2 cup) and kept them in the fridge. Yummy!

This is such an easy and surprisingly tasty treat! My little brother really loved rolling them in chocolate jimmies (we didn't have any coconut!) and my siblings really liked them. I do think that they are a little to sweet, however, and the dough was pretty sticky. If I make them again, I will cut the amount of honey to 1/3 cup to solve both of those problems. Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious candies/cookies, but you might really want to refrigerate the dough before shaping the balls. As other reviewers already mentionned, it should be great to drizzle some melted chocolate on top of the moonbeams, or even to dip them in melted chocolate! Great way to include fiber in your peanut butter cravings.

I loved this recipe when I was in elementary school and had been looking for it for some time - thanks! We leave out the coconut flakes and fold in things like nuts, dried fruits, or chocolate chips to change up the flavor a bit. Great snack for a long trip - boosts energy without a sugar rush!

I loved these!! Thanks for the recipe.  It was a favorite of mine as a child, but no one remembered how to make them.  My daughter and I had a great time making them.  Yummy!

I made these rolled in four different things; nuts, choc. sprinkles and even had raisins in some. The best was the coconut and I must agree with others about not having the need for that much honey. They were very soft, too soft. I actually thought ice cream could help to firm them up. My kids love cookie dough Blizzards so next time I'll add some choc. chips and stick it in some vanilla. No raw eggs either. Bonus! Still, probably half a cup of honey, you can always add more if needed. The wheat germ was actually yummy too. Go figure. After people would comment how good they were I found it fun telling them what was actually in it and seeing their suprise.  Especially the men! Tee hee My mother used to give us wheat germ OIL by the spoonful. Yuck! I can remember some rough mornings at the bus stop. Ug

Pretty good.  I reduced the honey to about 1/4 cup and rolled the balls in more dry milk powder.  Everyone loved these!  =)

Anyone with a child who likes to cook has to make this recipe.  My two year old had so much fun making these with me.  He could even help roll in the coconut and there is no baking so he helped with the whole process.  To top it off they are delicious and addicting and healthy!! What can I say, I just love everything about this recipe....except I prefer using crunchy peanut butter to give them more texture.  thanks for the great recipe!

Very tasty, and my 6-year-old could do the whole recipe nearly by herself. She was very proud of the results. The 4H judge at our fair gave only great comments!

Loved this! I only used 1/2 cup of honey and added wheat bran, oat bran, *and* oatmeal in place of the wheat germ. I made them with kids and we had so much fun rolling them in sprinkles and chocolate shavings! Yum!

Easy and addictive. Great way to "sneak" in healthy ingredients!  I didn't have any coconut at home at the time. So to try and make them less sticky, I crushed chex cereal and added cocoa powder to chex then rolled dime-sized balls in chex/cocoa. Then I popped them in the freezer. YUMMY! Can't wait to try them with coconut.

I love coconut and like to find new recipes to use it in! These were very simple but a little too sweet. Next time, I will take the others' advice and cut down on the honey. I also lightly buttered my hands before rolling them into balls- you guessed it- b/c they were sticky.  I also needed to add 1/3 cup more coconut for the rolling (I used shredded b/c it's finer). Before I served them, I refrigerated them to harden a little, as they were quite soft. Still a GOOD recipe that I would use again!

I thought these tasted great. I also added oats and flaxseed meal and refrigerated them because they were still very sticky.  My daughter ate them, but she didn't like them as much as I did!

These peanut butter balls are okay--I'm not real fond of the powdered milk, but the wheat germs adds another texture that is interesting. The recipe should definitely state that you should firm these up in the fridge for a bit. The texture is just not good when they are too soft. I rolled some in chocolate jimmies, some in coconut and some left plain. I preferred the coconut ones. I also cut down on the honey a bit.
