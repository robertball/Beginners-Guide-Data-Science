I just made this bread - it's amazing! I cut the recipe in half because I only own 1 loaf pan. Minor alterations - used 1/4 cup unbleached white and 1/4 whole wheat pastry flour (since I halved the recipe). I also used light soymilk in place of the milk. I will be making this A LOT.

This was actually my 1st attempt at making bread ever (I am new to cooking).  Everyone thought I was crazy to take on the task of making bread.  But, it was VERY easy to make, and provided me with 2 loaves of sweet and dense brown bread.  It's wonderful!

Good, but not what I was expecting.  I'm looking for something similar to the brown bread served at The Cheesecake Factory.

A big hit at Thanksgiving and easy enough for the kids to bake. I used mini loaf pans, so I could place cute loaves around the table (of 30 people!). Great with tons of butta!

I really liked the flavor of this bread.  It is very sweet, so to me it's like dessert or breakfast cake.  The taste reminds me of shoo fly pie.  I was surprised that it had neither shortening or egg in it.  I'll make it again as it was so easy and good.

Pretty good. Had much more the consistency of a gingerbread cookie than a loaf of bread. Thank you for sharing it, I.m glad I tried it!!

This was very good, especially with honey butter.  However, it wasn't the kind of brown bread I was hoping for.  This one was more of a breakfast treat.

Pretty good.  It is sweet but it's nice with butter or plain.  The loaves are pretty small so if you wanted a larger loaf you could probably just pour it all into one pan--but if you do that, make sure you bake longer!  I added dried cherries and raisins just because.  Very easy, and a good use of milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my first bread I made on my own and everyone loved it. My dad is pleading me to save the remainder for later, my mom's begging for the recipe and my one year old tried some and said 'Num num'. It is rather gingerbread like in texture, thick, and though my family likes it plain, I'm enjoying it with butter. Thank you much!

Definitely a pleaser.  A very thick, sweet bread that's a good compliment to pasta, or tasty just by itself.

I halved the recipe and used fat free milk. This came out super moist and dense, I can't believe it's so few calories! Top with fat free cream cheese and it is delicious!

I wanted to make some fresh (and quick) bread to go with the chili I made for dinner.  I didn't have any molasses at the time, so I was forced to use honey.  It turned out great! My family loved it! It was probably a bit too sweet to eat with chili, but I'll definitely make it again. Next time I'll try it with molasses.

I am a professional chef with 40 years experience.This year I am challenging myself to do more new recipes especially baking.Most cooking is straight forward.If you add extra vegetables to your soup it doesn't matter.But baking is a science .One thing off and it can change everything.This breaded easy and tastes great.Only thing different I added raisins.

The method calls for a "small bowl" for the wet ingredients and then instructs to add the dry ingredients to the wet!  This is obviously an error in the method. Haven't finished making this recipe so the low rating may not be accurate. Time will tell!

I omitted the sugar and increased the molasses and decreased the milk. Also added raisins. Delish.

Delicious brown bread that is very easy to make. This is my go-to bread when I feel like making fresh bread but am too lazy to go through the whole bread-making process (i.e. kneading / letting bread rise etc)

y Very good. Try it toasted, oh my God!! Had it on the Thanksgiving table along with the regular rolls. Was a nice combination of bread choices with our Turkey and gravy!!!
