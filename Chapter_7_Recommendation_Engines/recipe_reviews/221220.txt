This sauce is very yummy. It tastes like the bottled stuff at my local bbq place. It is not overly sweet or overly vinegary, but yet has both to the sauce. It makes a useable portion for cooked meat for sandwiches and is so quick to mix together. Ty

This was mild in taste but very good because it let the meat taste shine through. Served this with sliced pork tenderloin sandwiches.  Love the honey and mustard.

I used approximately 1 c of ketchup, and added all the other ingredients to the ketchup bottle. I used molasses, white sugar, chili powder, Worcester sauce & garlic powder to taste. It was amazing! I didnâ€™t measure the ingredients, but it was very good.
