I tried this both ways, partial cooking bacon and baking at 300 and raw bacon and cooking at 250 for a longer time. The raw way at 250 is much better, bacon and brown sugar soaks into the craker and tastes so much better

I made these for a pot luck and they were a huge hit...the crackers didn't get too greasy and smelled even better on Day 2....I used dark brown sugar...the only think I would recommend is that you should use a sieve or colander to help spread to brown sugar more evenly...hard to do with a spoon. Also I put the bacon the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up to make cutting it easier, just a personal preference but otherwise without doing that the heat from my hands melted the bacon fat and it was harder to pull apart slices for each cracker.   I'll make this again and again....after about 45 minutes in the oven at 250F, upped it to 300F, watched carefully and then broiled them for a couple minutes to get any remaining sugar to melt and caramelize.

I mixed cooked chopped bacon with the brown sugar and blended it all with cream cheese before spreading on the crackers (then no need to toast).  Unbelieveably delicious.  My husband saved some extra for his breakfast bagel.

This is a really great recipe. Really simple and guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser. I used Ritz crackers IPO Club crackers. I have an electric oven that runs a little slow, so I baked these at 275 for an hour and a half. You need to bake these long and slow to really get the best results. I baked them on a jelly roll pan with aluminum foil laid out, no need to bake on a rack, I wanted the crackers to soak up the grease, that's what makes these good. Gone in NO time.

If you can't get extremely lean bacon, I would think that precooking the bacon till 90% done, would really help this recipe to not be greasy...and it would take lots less time to bake. Otherwise, I'd bake them on a rack [in the pan], so most of the bacon grease could run off.

I just made a trial-run of these. They are very good. The only problem was, the 250 degree oven wasn't working. I moved mine to 275 degree's and that was perfect! They weren't greasy or too sweet at all!

As I read other comments, I decided to make this recipe leaner by pre-cooking the bacon a little more, and get rid of the grease. I found it to be very dry, and the brown sugar didn't "melt." I think it needed more of the grease to dissolve the sugar and crisp up. I'll try it again.

I have made this easy recipe for many years and always gotten rave reviews.  To reduce calories and mess, I don't even use any brown sugar and people still love them.  I do always cook them on a rack to prevent them from becoming too oily and to prevent oven flare-ups.

This is great, however, I would bake at 350 degrees. 250 degrees did not work at all in my electric oven.

I make mine using turkey bacon as it is not greasy and it cuts the calories.  I also add some cayenne pepper to the brown sugar to make it a bit spicy.  The hot sweet combination is quite good.  Also cook at 250 for about 45 minutes. This snack does not last long in my house.  Everyone loves it.

This is such a fast appetizer to make!  I was scared at first to use 1 tsp. of brown sugar. It seemed to much, but you need it to glaze the bacon and cracker.  I baked mine a little longer and there were still some crackers with brown sugar that hadn't melted, so I broiled them at the end for just a few seconds and it worked perfect.  Everyone loved them!

I love making "different" desserts and this has to be one of the best ones yet!  Very easy to make!  I did cover the pan with foil but I found that after it cooled a tiny bit that the crackers were wanting to stick to the foil.  Luckily I got them all off before they had permanent foil bottoms :o)  Next time I will use parchament paper or spray the foil.  Also, 45 mins on 250 was perfect but I did use the last 2 minutes to broil on low.  These taste better cold and are fantastic the next day (tastes like candy)!!

AMAZING! So simple! The crackers soaked up that amazing bacon flavor and were still crisp. I didn't use tinfoil because I was out and they still didn't burn. This one is a keeper!

Do  these need to be served hot - right out of the oven, or do they work at room temperature?  I would like to make these to take to pot luck, but do not have a way to heat them up once I am there.  Thanks for any advice you can give me.

These were the hit of our Memorial Day BBQ. I had so many requests for the recipe, I ended up posting it on FB. My only suggestion would be to cut the bacon into fourths instead of thirds. Not only does the bacon go further, I think it's a better bacon/cracker/sugar ratio that way.

I had high hopes for this . . . enough I made two pans.  And threw away two pans.  I fully accept it was probably my fault as everyone else seems to think it is easy and delicious.  Maybe I overthought mine . . . I removed large pieces of fat and tried to use leaner portions, and placed my crackers on racks to bake.  They turned out dry, tasteless, and very unattractive - curled up.  I'd love to taste them prepared by someone successful.  I mean, bacon and brown sugar - yum!

Love this version. I have always made these with Parmesan cheese instead of brown sugar... nor sure which I like best. Best part after making them can freeze and thaw when need them for a quick appetizer.

Followed the directions and it was amazingly delicious!! Needed a little extra time to melt the sugar. I agree with one reviewer who felt a sieve might be helpful for the sugar. My crackers were sticky and stuck to the paper towels. Next time maybe on a drying rack?
I wish Allrecipes allowed you to flag unhelpful reviews, ones that don't remotely follow the recipe.

Such a good little treat. I make one small addition.  I sprinkle a little cayenne on top of the brown sugar.  I love the sweet hot salty crunchy combination.

Fantastic.  Made as directed, spreading out the brown sugar.  I thought about making on a rack but opted not to, and I'm glad I didn't.  These are super-soft when they come off the pan so you'll need to use a spatula; as they cool they will get hard again.

I made 2 pans of these.  One pan at 250, which took way too long and another at 350 which burned the crackers before the bacon could get done, and I don't eat raw bacon.   Tomorrow I will try pre-cooking to about 75% and then putting them in a 325 degree oven.  I think I'll have much better luck with that.

These are so yummy, and I get asked all the time for me to make them for work.  They call them "Bacon Crack".   :))

What a disaster!Five stars for taste, if i could give zero for ease and waste, I would. They start to stick to the foil before you get get them off of it. Glad I have time to go get something from the deli at the grocery store before the cookout i was going to take these to.

I had no brown sugar or the recommended crackers so I did my own thing... substituted Ritz crackers and  used maple syrup plus white sugar to make a brown sugar substitute, added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, added 1 tsp vanilla  to sugar mixture. i used way less bacon( maybe 4 slices? not more than 5) :  cutting  the bacon with a pair of scissors was easiest method.  after small square of bacon  was placed  on each  cracker, I put 1/2 tsp of sugar mixture on each piece of bacon. Before putting them into the oven , I lightly sprinkled each cracker with a few red pepper flakes. The spicy + the sweet is what makes these crackers! Thanks to the reviewer that suggested this!   I then baked them for 90 minutes at 275*.  The baking time was a mistake, was working in the garden and forgot the time. I was worried i burnt them, but they were perfectly caramelized and super crunchy.  I loved them as made this way, but next time I will bake them for one hour only and see how they turn out.  My husband loved them, too. They are addicting! By the way, they were not greasy at all, maybe because I used such a smaller amount of bacon??  Other reviewers suggested cooking them on a wire rack, and I have a bacon pan (with many holes in in)  that i used. My only regret: I should have sprayed the pan with spray oil first because some of them were really stuck to the pan and were hard to pick up.  Never used foil or parchment paper, I think that is another reason why they were not greasy. I will make th

I used Ritz crackers, cut the bacon into 3rds (I did put it in the freezer for a few minutes first to make it easier to handle), and spread the sugar evenly over the top. They are amazing! Savory, sweet, greasy goodness!

A very quick and easy 'do ahead' snack treat/appetizer.   It really does taste better the next day if you live in a dry environment. The cracker crisps back up and the brown sugar and bacon are delicious.  I actually allowed mine to cook 1 1/2 hour at 250 because the bacon didn't look quite cooked enough for my taste.  The nickname "Pig Candy" fits this treat.

Someone has finally found a way to eat all the bacon fat that renders from the slice as it cooks.  Far too greasy for us and downright unhealthy.
