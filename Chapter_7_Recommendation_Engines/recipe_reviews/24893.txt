This tastes wonderful but the directions need to be rewritten.  The walnuts and vanilla were left out.  I knew where to put them in but some others may not.

You're so right, Cheryl! The crust on this was much better than the pretzel salad. The ladies at my luncheon raved about it. Very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

Although the recipe calls for walnuts, we left them out and enjoyed a wonderfully creamy smooth texture.  This recipe is absolutely wonderful!

This was very good.  However, the family did not especially like the meringue/cracker/nut layer - though I thought it was delicious.  They much preferred the traditional pretzel layer from similar dishes.  I did substitute Strawberry- Flavored Cool Whip for regular which gave a nice flavor & color to the middle layer.

This is very very rich in sugar... But still very good ... when I make it again I am going to try exchanging the sugar for equal and see if it will be a little bit better... otherwise we loved it!!!

The crust was extremely sweet.  Next time I'll use Splenda in place of the sugar and cut the amount back some.  Otherwise it was tasty.  I think  I prefer the pretzel crust though.

This unique meringue base is one to try!  It's like one of those Italian meringue cookies, only an entire layer in the bottom of the pan.  I used coarsely chopped club crackers and pecans incorporated into the whipped egg whites.  Be gentle when adding the cream cheese layer as the base is very delicate and could collapse easily.  We absolutely loved this version of a strawberry cream salad.  It's so much better the next day, and the day after!  Definitely a keeper.  Will be great to take to potlucks.

Very good! I used an 8 oz. container of cool whip instead of the recommended 16 oz. size. The 16 oz. size would have been too much for my 13/9 pan. Using the 8 oz. size the jello topping came right to the top of the pan.

Addictive!  The only change I made was to use fresh strawberries sliced thinly.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!  It's definitely better after it sits for a day.  I think the crust would be just as good (maybe better) without the nuts.  I will be making this again :)

I made a half recipe & put it in a pie plate.  Delicious!  Next time will be better.  Didn't have a full carton of cool whip this time.
