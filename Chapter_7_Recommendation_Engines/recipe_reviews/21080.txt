I replace the mozzrella with 1/2 cup parmesan...and it turns out amazing every time!!  I simplify the whole recipe by stirring the garlic powder, parsley, and parmesan into softened butter to make a thick paste, spread the mixture onto the bread slices, and sprinkling a bit of paprika in the center of each piece...then bake!  To die for!! :)

Four stars as written, using garlic powder and dried parsley.  Five stars, using fresh garlic and parsley.  I used long, crusty Italian rolls so I didn't bother to bake them.  Just toasting these under the broiler worked just fine.   Heavier, of course, than traditional garlic bread, but nice for a treat. Very good!

After this, I will NEVER BUY STORE BOUGHT GARLIC BREAD AGAIN!!!  We love garlic bread and this one tops all garlic breads!! I only used 1 TBLS garlic powder (which was plenty) and the "sauce" only covered half a loaf of french bread. Of course, the bread was gone in no time! I'm just sorry to see what I have been missing all this time...thanks Noelle!

Yum!  I left out the herbs and skipped the cheese this time because my husband didn't want it, but it was still delicious.  I used fresh minced garlic and garlic powder because we adore the stuff and can't seem to get enough.  I baked it at 350 for 10 minutes then stuck it under the broiler for about a minute and a half to make it nice and crispy.  Definitely a keeper.

This is by FAR the best garlic bread EVER!!!  So good and SOOOO easy.  I serve it with a dish of balsamic vinagar and olive oil.  It gets more attention and complements then the main course!

This is good garlic bread!  I've been making my own version similiar to this one for a long time.  I just toast several slices of bread and spread them with butter and sprinkle with garlic powder and parsley.  This is a must with pasta!!

The kids thought this was great!  We love garlic bread & not only was this easy, but tasty as well.  I sprinkled paprika on top of mine instead of the cheese.  I also used the recipe for Mama D's Italian Bread (found on this site) & went from there.  Thanks Noelle!

Mon Dui!  Wonderful stuff, the presentation is great too--it looks like I spent quite a bit of time on this side dish.  I agree w/ prior reviews:  use fresh garlic.

Very good - I used minced garlic from the jar vs. garlic powder, half the amount of parsley, and added 1 tsp. of dried oregano.  Instead of melting the butter, I let it soften and formed a paste.  I spread that over the bread.  I used parmesan and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to make it nice and crispy.

I have attempted twice now and both times there is too much garlic. I can tell that if I figure out the measurements.. it would be very good. Hopefully the next batch will come out much better. =)

Forget melting the butter over the stove.  Soften butter or margarine instead in a microwave and mix the garlic powder and parsley in.  Then spread over the bread and toast in the oven.

I sauteed minced garlic cloves in butter and used fresh parsley.  I also had some asiago cheese to use up so I substituted that instead of the mozzarella.  I highly recommend using real garlic as oppose to the powder.  I think it makes a huge difference.  Also, I always use fresh herbs as often as I can.  It really does make a difference in the final taste and presentation of a dish. Thanks for sharing !

This is SO simple and so good.  I have done all sorts of variations it's always great.  I usually make a paste out of softened butter and the spices instead of melting it just because I think it's simpler.  My family likes this best with some grated parmesan cheese mixed in with the butter but it's good without too.

THIS IS GREAT GARLIC BREAD!!  I basically made 1/2 the recipe, but used 2 big cloves of fresh garlic and fresh parsley.  Based on some of the other reviewers suggestions, I added some parmesan cheese and cut back a bit on the mozzarella, which in my case was actually a mozzarella/provolone blend.  After baking for 10 minutes, I did slip this under the broiler to add a little color.  I think next time I make this I'll make the full recipe and try freezing some.  This would be great to have ready and waiting in the freezer!! Thanks for the recipe - it will be repeated for sure.

Yummy~  I used half the butter (1/2 cup is way too much!), Italian seasoning instead of dried parsley, and added some fresh parmesan cheese.

Thought this was terrible.  If I were to make this again I would use fresh minced garlic in the butter instead of the garlic powder.  I also thought the mozzarella was too gluey on the top and would try freshly grated Parmesan instead.

I used to buy the garlic bread with the garlic and everything on it. I wanted to try this because there is always too much spread on the premade ones. This was fantastic and so easy. Made it exactly as the recipe except didn't add cheese called for and this will definately be my go to recipe for garlic bread. Thanks for posting!!

I didn't make this exactly as it was called for because I didn't want to use so much butter. I did use a fair amount of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (I really can because I LOVE real butter :) ) and I used more garlic powder than what was called for. I thought exact measurements for this recipe was pointless. If you like a lot of garlic then 1.5 tbsp is not enough so I dusted until I was happy. I also added some onion powder and I sprinkled Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning and I used the prepackaged Italian blend of cheeses (from Sargento I believe). I toasted the bread in the oven for maybe 10 mins (cheese was already on) and then I put it under the broiler (on high) for 2-4 minutes until the cheese started to bubble a little and the ends got to be a lovely golden brown. This is excellent garlic bread for homemade!

This was excellent!  So quick and easy, I will probably never buy the frozen boxes again!  I used italian seasoning instead, and a little more garlic powder, and my entire family loved it!  Goes great with the "spaghetti italian" from this site!

Just made this tonight and it was delicious! I have tried so many recipes and my search for the perfect garlic bread is over. I followed everything except adding the mozzarella cheese on top (instead I added a few dashes of Parmesan to the butter mixture); I prefer the garlic to be the star of the show!

My family loves this recipe. We use focaccia that they have at our local grocery store and top with cheddar. So simple and so delicious.

Followed recipe exactly and I enjoyed it! I rated it four stars b/c it was not my husband's favorite garlic bread.

I tried this recipe 2 times once with melting the butter and the next time with just softening the butter and mixing everything and making a garlic spread. the second time turned or so much better them the first time. and three first time it  barely got touched, and the second time I made it my family was fighting over it. Wil be making again tonight without melting the spread. Thank you very much for the recipe.

I found it too dry, its better when you dont melt the butter and use fresh garlic with dried parsley then butter the bread then bake, that way the bread will be crunchy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside, this was more like toast that tasted garlicy!

No More Store Bought Frozen for Us! This was great...used hamburger buns and 1/2 cup Garlic Spread from Sam's Club (premade, 24oz, garlic minced and parsley and romano cheese in margarine spread tub for those not familiar) melted in microwave.  YUMMY!  Gobbled up by all with spaghetti and salad for dinner.   I've also had this done with monterey jack cheese, as well as spread on two long halves and baked in foil or done on the grill.  Very versatile (sp?)....thanks for the keeper.

Absolutely wonderful!  The only change I made was using Italian seasoning in place of the parsley (I couldn't find dried parsley at my supermarket).  Very flavorful and decadent.  This recipe helped make my husband's birthday dinner special.  Thank you!

Great recipe. My son eats pasta all the time so I make this and freeze (without baking). When it's time to eat I just pop a few slices into the oven for 5 min at 170C and it's done! This way we have garlic bread in a flash any time we need!

I used homemade bread sliced thick, and 4 servings covered exactly 6 slices of bread.  It was delicious - every bit as good as the store bought frozen Texas cheese toast! (I use 1/4 the garlic powder)

This recipe was wonderful!  I used an Italian herb loaf from the local grocery and then followed the rest of the recipe.  The kids gobbled it up and asked for more.  Will definitely make often.

I halved this recipe, and used real garlic instead of the powder. I used 2 cloves of garlic for the half a loaf of bread. It turned out great! We loved it. Could even use 3 gloves of garlic for one half of the bread. We ate with homemade spaghetti and meatballs, and went really well.

GREAT recipe! It was so delicious, fast, easy, and I had everything on hand I needed to make it. I did use half butter and half "Can't Believe It's Not Butter", and it turned out fine. An extra thing I appreciated about finding this recipe is that it's easy to cut down (tonight there were just the two of us, so I just made four slices. Thanks for sharing, Noelle!

Great, easy, tasty recipe!  I added a few roasted garlic cloves that I mashed into a paste and mixed in with the butter and some garlic powder to form a paste rather than melt the butter.  Felt it was easier to spread on bread.  Sprinkled grated fresh parma cheese then topped with the mozzarella cheese.  YUMMY!

This recipe is amazing!  The only thing I did differently was that I used 3 cloves of real garlic (my husband and I are both garlic lovers), I added some parmesean cheese and I put it under the broiler after I put the mozzerella cheese on.  I will definitely use this recipe from now on.  My picky husband loved it, too, so it must be good :-) Thanks, Noelle!

I have used this for over a year & I no longer buy Garlic Bread at the store...
Oh, you must use FRESH GARLIC!!! It only takes a min to mince it up and so werth it... I keep a mixture of the butter on hand at all times. I use it on homemade Pizza crust or if I want a fast garlic bread I toast up a burger bun & brush it on yummy!!! You can use it on so may things.....

This was among one of the best garlic breads I've had in my life time, and believe me I've had a lot of garlic bread.  Beware of the garlic powder though, DO NOT add too much as it will ruin your experience with this exceptional bread.  My kids really enjoy this recipe when I soak the bread, the night before, in pickle juice.  They find it add a unique flavor.  If I could rate this 50 stars I would.

Very easy recipe that turns out perfectly. I softened the butter in the microwave then mixed in the garlic powder and parsley. Saved time and one less dirty pan.

The garlic powder becomes a gummy mess separated in the butter.  I won't use this recipe again.  Next time, I will butter baste each slice and sprinkle a little garlic powder.  It's more time consuming but consistent instead of not knowing how much of the gummy garlic you're getting on each slice with the basting brush.

Truthfully I thought this WAS the way to make garlic bread at home. I've always made it this way. Actually it does make a difference if you melt the butter. I used to make a spread, but if you melt it helps for all of,the flavors to seep deep down into the bread.  Unless I am baking I rarely use measurements so it is difficult for me to tell you how much of anything to use.
I usually make one half of the loaf of just garlic bread and the other half adding mozzarella cheese. I like to broil for just a minute or two. Add a little fresh Parmesan...perfecto!

A good loaf of bread helps to start off with, but really it doesn't matter in a pinch. (Have used hot dogs buns when kids begged for garlic bread!) I season the outside of the bread with Rosemary or whatever Italian herbs you have available, broil the outside for just a minute to help it crisp up. Then prepare as normal. Kids can have their own little personal loaf. 
P.S. Just put two halves back together and wrap in foil, stick back in turned off, but still warm oven to keep warm if you're serving a lot of people.

To be fair, I used French bread and an Italian cheese blend because that's what I had, and I also didn't read it right and used minced garlic, instead of powder, but it was still awesome. and next time I will try it according to the recipe which I'm sure will be just as great.

Easy to make and very delicious! Instead of mozzarella by itself, I used a shredded cheese mix of mozzarella, parmesan, romano, and provolone. Will definitely make again!

I made this garlic bread tonight to go with our pasta and we both loved it. I think we liked the garlic bread more than we did the pasta LoL. Thanks so much for posting this. It is a keeper for sure. Made as written.We are garlic lovers so it was great for us.

This is the best garlic toast ever! After the first time I made this my husband and dad always ask if I can make it with any pasta dish we have. The only change I have made is I add 5-6 cloves of real garlic to the pan with the butter, it makes it that much better. However, if my grandma is coming over for dinner, I omit the real garlic but it still tastes really good.

A family favorite.  I've tried a few different recipes before this one, and I will look no further!  I always double the recipe so that there is some of the butter mixture left to add after the cheese goes on.

I like this recipe so much that I'm practically making it every time we have a creamy soup for dinner. Easy yet home-made. However, be sure to serve it fresh out of the oven as mozzarella can get tough and chewy when cooled.

The parsley was clumping together, so I would have one piece covered in parsley, and another with barely any. I decided to just spread butter on both sides of the bread, sprinkle with garlic powder, sprinkle with parsley, and bake for a few minutes. Then I topped with mozzarella cheese and broiled until cheese was melted and bread was crispy. Turned out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!

I eyeballed the ingredients (didn't want to take the time to measure it out), added a little Parmesan cheese and put the mix on some hoagie rolls.  I thought it turned out pretty well.

Fantastic bread!! Was a great addition to my spaghetti recipe and tasted great when dipped in the extra sauce! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I just guess-timated since I was  only making a few pieces.  Will definitely make it again!

I love garlic bread, it's probably one of my favorite foods. This was not the best. The bread was too hard and it hurt my mouth.

This garlic bread is so yummy!  I have made it 2 times in 3 days.  I did make it one time with Promise instead of butter.  It just isn't as good, but better for the heart!

I didnt find this that flavoursome. I doubled the garlic even, but I think the taste of the garlic powder gets too killed by the cooking time.

This got rave reviews at our house.  My hubby LOVED it.  No more store brought garlic bread here.  I did make one change.  I added garlic salt along with the garlic powder.  We are big garlic fans at our house.  You have got to try this one.  Thank you so much for this fast and VERY easy garlic bread recipe!!!

Great classic garlic bread! Only thing I had to change was using 1 teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning because I didn't have any parsley on hand. So delicious! This would be great without the mozzarella too, so if you don't have any, go ahead and make this, it's wonderful! We had this last night with pasta that had a tomato cream sauce, and the bread wasn't too "heavy" as some garlic cheese breads could be. I will use this recipe again, we really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing :)

Good garlic flavor, but mine left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The only thing I changed was using margarine instead of butter.

This was good and I will make it again. I did not have french loaf - so used english muffins. I cut the recipe in half and put 2 teaspoons on each half of english muffin (3 muffins or 6 halves). I put mozzarella on some and parmesan on the others and prefered the mozzarella.

Very easy and good. I used mozzarella on some of these and cheddar cheese on some because I didn't have enough mozz. I used whole wheat slices of bread because that is what I had on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I used 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of powder. And I melted the butter mix in the oven as it preheated because all my burners were being used. That worked great. I accidentally put the cheese on before pre-baking. Opps! It was still great but not as crispy.

This is so easy and tastes great.  Only change we made that we like better is we don't bake the bread because the bottom is hard.  We broil it so the top is crispy, bottom is still soft.

Yes this is good but if you want somethig equally delicious and fast try the following:
Slice your favourite baguette into hand  friendly sizes, to 1 cup of spreadable  margarine or butter add 2-3 tbs garlic powder and 1/4 cup grated Romano cheese. Mix thoroughly. Place bread on baking sheet under the broiler (watch carefully) for 3-4 minutes and voila! hot,crusty, delicious and chewable

Great with fresh minced garlic and parmesan. I added a light sprinkle of cayenne for a little kick. Next time I would also add a little minced parsley and some salt, as the bread was "almost there" but not quite...

I really liked this recipe...I cheated a little and used some jarred garlic with the fresh and used italian seasoning instead of parsley. Fantastic!!

Here's a helpful hint-if you don't have a pasty brush, use a big spoon with holes...works just as well!

Yummy garlic bread.  I modified it a little, though. Instead of melting the butter with the garlic powder and parsley in saucepan, I let my blocks of butter soften at room temperature. I then mixed the softened butter, garlic powder, added "fresh" italian parsley, a dash of garlic salt and cloves of fresh minced garlic altogether, and used it as a soft spread over the bread. I baked for 10 minutes as the directions stated, and let the butter mixture melt when baking. Then removed and sprinkled fresh mozzarella cheese over. Finished the recipe as stated and the bread was fabulous! Very good and compliments any meal! Will be my garlic bread recipe from now on.

You won't have left-overs of this garlic bread.  Try subbing Italian seasoning for the parsley.  I don't  cut my bread into slices, I split the loaf in half length-wise and brush on butter and cheese.  Then after toasting it under broiler, I cut slices.  Its easier for me to cut toasted, rather than try to cut the untoasted bread into even slices. Plus the half slices are an easier portion for my younger children.

This is wonderful! I changed it up a little, I spread butter on the bread and then sprinkled garlic powder and italian seasonings along with the cheese-I used the pizza blend cheeses and then popped in the oven. Great!

I thought this was really good. Better than the store brought stuff , and a lot cheaper. Thank you for sharing with us.

Similar to the garlic bread that I've been making but instead of cutting the bread into slices.  Cut the bread lengthwise to make two halves then spread margarine on it (you don't need to melt the butter) and then sprinkle garlic powder on the margarine and cheese.  You can vary how much garlic you want on it - heavy or light.  Slice the bread when it comes out of the oven.  It's how my husband and I have been making it for 10 years and everyone loves it.

I made this for my girlfriends and they loved this!!  I used half the butter mentioned in the recipe and it was still good.  Next time I might try a variation with adding salt and removing the mozzarella.

Absolutely yummy! Would definitely make it again... Added an extra layer of grated Parmesan cheese, made it more cheesy!

I will never buy garlic bread again! This was amazing. I couldn't believe how good it turned out. I made this to go with lasagna so I didn't add cheese to the bread (too much cheese for me with lasagna). Also I melted the butter in the microwave instead of stovetop.

I just wanted to say that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!! The garlic bread was excellent and my family raved about it! I didn't have a French baguette, so I used potato rolls and split them in half, the bread was still delicious, just not as crispy and firm. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bread and will use this recipe in the future! I will NEVER buy frozen garlic bread again! Thanks for a great recipe! :) :)

When I make garlice bread, I don't melt the butter, I slice the bread butter each slice on both front & back, then sprinkle it with garlic salt & powder (I don't measure it)then wrap in aluminum foil and bake for 15 - 20 minutes.

Simple, easy, delicious! You don't even have to add the cheese. I agree with other posts...I will never buy frozen or bakery version again. I have the ingredients on hand all the time! I have 3 sons and they loved this! I'm sure there are more gourmet versions on here. But for a simple DELICIOUS garlic bread to go with spaghetti night. ...this is it :)

I just spread some margarine made with olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder and parsley on top, then followed the rest of the directions. Came out very good and I had no extra saucepan/container to clean!

Be sure you are using garlic *powder* not garlic *salt*.  It's best if you mix the spices into softened butter rather than melted, and it's perfectly delicious without the mozzarella.

Tasty and highly versatile - great as is. If I have it on hand I add 1/2 tsp minced garlic and sub Smart Balance for the butter. I've also subbed shredded Italian blend cheese for the mozzarella.

This is my favorite garlic bread I found on this site. Instead of using the basting brush I dip one side of the bread in the dressing, this way you get a lot more of the flavouring!!

Yum-o-matic! Went with the recipe exactly! I might add some finely minced garlic in the pan also since I love garlic. Also gonna try it with parmesan cheese since I dont get mozzaralla much. Better than store bought or from a restaurant:)

I've tried this both with Parmesan and mozzarella. We prefer it with mozzarella. While it is good with Parmesan cheese, the sharpness of the Parmesan mingled with the garlic is a bit potent.  Like some others, i make a paste of the garlic, butter and parsley. I toast it for 5 minutes and then top it with mozzarella and toast it for another 5 minutes. If you put a long pan under the bread you'll achieve the perfect "crispness" without burning the bottom! Thanks!

We loved this bread!  I didn't melt the butter, just mixed the parsley and garlic in with softened butter and spread it on the bread.  I will never buy frozen garlic bread again!!!

I make this recipe all the time because it is SO easy. And if the ingredient list wasn't already easy enough, I simplify the directions as well. I don't bother melting the butter, and instead I just use the whipped tub stuff and mix it together with the garlic and parsley. As I'm generally only making enough for myself, I cut the recipe down to one tablespoon of butter mixture per slice of bread and really layer it on. Then I just pop it in the oven for 10 minutes to toast, forgoing the cheese. If I was serving this as an appetizer or a snack I would add it, but I generally feel that there's already enough cheese with the main course as it is. I've also started cutting down on the parsley by about half because it was just too much for me. This makes a quick garlic bread that smells amazing when it's toasting in the oven.

I have to say, this is very good!  I made it a few times, the first time following the directions, but it was too garlic'y for me.  So the next time I put in less garlic powder and more butter, and it came out great!
I first bake the bread a little to warm it up, then I spread the mixture on (I also just add in the ingredients and spread everything like butter) I put on a little cheese (very little) and bake until the cheese has melted.  Then I put on the rest of the cheese and Broil it, until its all melted and it comes out great.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I had this for dinner tonight with lasagna and it was absolutely delicious!  I did, however, make a few modifications.  I used unsalted butter so instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons of garlic powder I used 1 tablespoon garlic powder and 1/2 tablespoon garlic salt.  Instead of mozzarella, I used a six cheese blend.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe! Update-I made this again last night and instead of melting the butter and mixing in remaining ingredients, I softened the butter stirred in the garlic, parsley and half of the cheese and spread evenly over the bread.  Baked for 10min then added the rest of the cheese and baked for an additional 5min.  Try it this way.  You will not be disappointed!

This is a great recipe! Makes perfect buttery, garlic-flavor infused bread that goes great with pasta and lasagna! It's also very easy to make!  

PS:  I made mine without cheese and it was killer! The butter and garlic flavors really stand out without the presence of cheese.

This is a great, easy recipe - I've tried mixing it up a little by using Mrs. Dash's seasoning instead of parsley and guests LOVE it!  I also skipped the cheese with the Mrs. Dash's -

I didn't add the cheese, mostly because I didn't have any on hand and people still inhaled it.

Being a klutz in the kitchen, I was pleasantly surprised when it came out better than expected. It was so easy to make! And tastes even better than the last one I ate which was bought. As soon as they were finished, I was just itching to make them.

Two major points: Tastes great and is quick & easy to make! I quickly put this together while I was making the main dish. It goes well with the "shrimp dijonnaise" recipe. I really really love garlic so I also added a few cloves of minced fresh garlic on top of the garlic powder.

Delicious!  Instead of cutting the bread in individual slices, I cut the bread in half and brushed the mixture on the two long slices.  I did not have dried parsley so I substituted dried Italian seasoning.  Kids loved.  Thank you
4/17 - Made with parsley this time but the kids told me they liked much better with Italian seasoning (more flavor.)  Guess I will continue making it the first way using Italian seasoning.

This didn't turn out really great.  Maybe I sliced the bread too thin... put too much of the mixture on both sides maybe?  Don't know but it was too strong of a garlic flavor, and had a greasy consistency.  Maybe next time I will slice the bread thicker, use less garlic and only put mixture on one side of the bread... also, my butter was unsalted and this really needed more flavor (other than the garlic) so I added a bit of salt...

Was very disappointed in this recipe.  All the adding of the mozzarella cheeze does is mute the garlic flavor.  It might be good using cheddar cheese but I think I will just stick to plain old garlic bread in the future.

Very good, the cheese is an awesome addition! I don't use as much garlic powder as called for though. I also just use softened butter instead of melting it. Blend in the seasonings and spread as much on the bread as you like and store the rest of the butter in the refrigerator or freezer for another day.

Great flavor!  I made this with a pan of lasagna this weekend and it went perfectly.  I used real minced garlic instead of the powder and added freshly grated Parmesen cheese to the mozzarella cheese.

Excellent garlic bread.  Hubby said it was the best ever.  I used some french rolls I had in the freezer, subbed 12 the mozzarella with freshly grated parmesan and added a little more garlic powder.  Wonderful!

Nothing special, but it was still good.  I expected it to taste better than the frozen kind, but it wasn't any better, and more time consuming.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I did add some olive oil to the spread.  I don't think the mozzarella was a big deal, especially since I bought a bag of it and had a bunch left over.

Delicious recipe! The only change I made was to butter the baking sheet first which resulted in a crispy, buttery bottom. The time and temperature was perfect!

MY PICKY HUSBAND LOVED IT!!                    
 First time I made garlic bread without premixed garlic bread powder. 
This recipe was great! But I did change it up a bit but not much.  I added about 1 Tbsp. Finely grated parmesan cheese with the mozzarella cheese, or to taste.  1Tbsp. Garlic powder.  I also put the sour dough loaf halves under the broiler before and after adding the cheese.

You can't go wrong with serving garlic bread with any meal. I changed the recipe a little bit by using minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, and softened butter.( I tried with the melted butter first time around and found that the  melted butter was too messy and the minced garlic stayed on the bottom of the melted butter. ) Also, I think I might make 1.5 times the amount or use less bread because I didn't think it was "garlicy" enough.

The first time I made this was for a Christmas dinner party with two loaves of bread, I was so surprised that 6 people literally ate all of the bread I had and raved at how delicious it was. 

I did follow the other review and made a thick paste with the mixture and made some changes based on other reviews as well. First I replaced the original amount of garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and added 1 freshly minced garlic based on another review stating that the original recipe was too garlicy. For the cheese, I did an equal mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheese since mozzarella cheese has a creamy taste and parm balanced the flavor with a salty contrast. 

Overall a great recipe. The only additional tweak I would make is to use less Italian seasoning since the flavors were a little too strong for my personal taste, in particularly the rosemary taste in the Italian seasoning.

Yummy & easy garlic bread recipe.  Took the advise of another reviewer & added Romano cheese to the mix of butter & garlic powder to make the mixture thicker, used reduced fat shredded Italian cheese instead of mozzarella.  Stored the left over baked bread in a zip log bag in the fridge and warmed it in microwave.  This is a keeper recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

I minced one clove of garlic instead of garlic powder. It was not the prettiest mixture in the butter but was still delicious with freshly grated mozzarella. I used an Italian Herb bread kit instead of buying a premade loaf. It took longer to make but was a lot more fun and very tasty.

Garlic can be overwhelming., and if you agree, try this: Instead of sprinkling on chopped garlic, or using garlic powder, put a halved garlic clove (or several) into butter or oil, and heat gently for a little bit.   REMOVE the garlic, and use the butter and/or oil.  With this method, I get the nice garlic flavor, but it never "repeats" on me.

Just what I needed with some bread I had. Parsley a little hard to spread though since it gets stuck to brush.

Edit: I found out that shredding your own cheese from block is better because pre shredded bag cheese uses a preservative/chemical to make the cheese not stick or clump together and makes it not taste as good and probably not melt as good.

This turned out great. I added more butter than the recipe called for because I think it needed it. Other than that, it was very good and very easy. I'll definitely be making it again.

Way too much garlic and the cheese doesn't  brown. I like my garlic cheese bread to have an nice crispy cheese topping, but this is just...barely melted.  I would suggest using broil when melting mozzarella in the oven.  There are better garlic cheese bread recipes here on this website.

This was AMAZING!! Tasted just like Olive Gardens....maybe even better!! I used rotisserie chicken and didn't use the cornstarch mixture. It was the perfect consistency without that. I only used half an onion since I don't care for onions too much. I also only used about a handful of spinach. My friend is a chef at Olive Garden and she told me they add about a teaspoon of chicken bouillon base, I did this and it added much more flavor. Will DEFINITELY make this again.

We live in France right now so I made this with a couple-days-old baguette instead of italian bread and I didn't add the cheese. And it was DELICIOUS. My husband and I both ate four pieces and wished we had more. This will now be our staple for when we don't finish a baguette the day it was made. Yum!

Made some tonight (to add with the Pesto Chicken Florentine from this site, which is really good!) ....and turned out great! Not a fan of using my broiler so this was great since the oven was already hot and didn't need to broil to brown (or burn!!,)

I have made it twice in the last week. My family loved it with cheese and without the cheese. It is so quick and simple to make that I will never buy frozen garlic bread again.

I liked it, but also a little too garlicky for my family's taste. Added some parmesan to the top at the end since I didn't have any mozzarella. Cheaper and better than store bought!!

Wow-- this was so easy and everyone LOVED it. I softened the butter and mixed it all up the day before substituted the cheese for parmesan. Let the butter thaw and spread over the bread. I have never tasted such amazing garlic bread and believe me I have had my fair share of eating garlic bread. You'll want to make two loaves  for 4 people!!

The first time I made this I ended up using 6 slices of bread instead of Italian bread. I also only used 1 Tablespoon of garlic powder instead of 1-1/2 Tablespoons and it was still to garlicky. The next time I made it I used 6 slices of bread again but this time only used 3/4 Tablespoon garlic powder and it came out perfectly. I now make this every time I make spaghetti.

This turned out great. I scaled the recipe to 2 servings, and I ate both servings! I mixed the garlic powder and parsley into softened butter and spread on the bread. I used old hamburger buns, and they worked perfectly. I used Italian blend cheese instead of mozzarella. I cut back on the garlic powder just a little bit, but I think the full amount would be fine.

We didn't melt the butter entirely and used about 1T of fresh, crushed garlic and it was just right.  Cooking time was right about on and amount was good for a 16oz loaf, which we split lengthwise before buttering.

I followed the recipe to the T except for I added Italian and Parmesan cheese then put them back in the oven. It was very tasty, and the amount of garlic powder to parsley ratio was perfect taste-wise, though I had to make more of it to cover the slices of bread completely. Very delicious!

Delicious!  Reduced the garlic powder by half and added a scant teaspoon of garlic salt, put a tablespoon or so of shredded parmesan on before adding the mozzarella.  My husband loved it!

I added fresh garlic and used a baguette instead of Italian bread. Also sprinkled paprika on after it came out of  the oven. No cheese because I'm lactose intolerant.

I loved this recipe. It was amazing and just as good as store bought, maybe even better though I confess that I followed the top reviews recommendation about making a thick paste and using Parmessan. My boyfriend loved it. I did choose the lazy path and bought already sliced bread from the bakery but I didn't use Italian bread (didn't find it) but French. It was still good.

Very good!  I prefer to use only 1 TBsp garlic powder, and instead of just parsley I use a mix of herbs that replicates the bread dip mix from Carraba's restaurant.  Yum!

I substitute parmesan for mozzarella and don't melt the butter...just soften it, mix the other ingredients in and spread it on sliced Italian or French bread. I've also used sliced onion buns, which are also very good! Much better than any frozen garlic bread.

Variations: Try adding shredded or grated parmesan cheese ,fresh cilantro or dry marjoram or oregano depending on what type meal you are serving this with, Italian, Mexican etc; instead of garlic powder try using fresh minced or dry minced; use a baguette or cuban bread cut in slices..Ive done them all and they ar FAB!

This was pretty nice, though it's a simple, almost intuitive recipe. I made it exactly as written, using a "Pane Toscano" that happened to weigh exactly a pound. I used all of the butter mixture on step 3, but I think I probably should have saved some of it for step 4. I agree with another reviewer that using fresh (crushed) garlic might just make this a 5-star recipe. I may make this again, and perhaps I can bake it a little longer - I would've liked the mozzarella to be a little browned if possible - this first time out, it was just all melted.

This recipe is really good! I was skeptical about the mozzarella because I am not a big fan of melted cheese, but it was great! I found myself eating 4 pieces. husband and kids also enjoyed it. Very simple and good following the recipe exactly.

This was wonderful and easy. I eyeballed everything and omitted the cheese because I didn't have any. I brushed on the last bits of the butter mixture right before serving and I think that was the best part! :o)

GREAT.  I had to change of few things.  Didn't have parsley so I used Italian Seasoning and used cheddar instead mozzarella.  It was great and husband really liked it.

This is great garlic bread.  Instead of melting the butter, I mix the parsley, butter, and garlic powder together and then spread it on the bread.  I have also tried this with oregano and it was very good.  I do not buy pre-packged garlic bread any longer.

I also tried this tasty garlic bread. I also made a few adjustments. I sprinkled a bit of cheddar, Parmesan cheese and chives on top of the Mozzerella Mmm Mmm good.

I used 1 Tbsp of italian seasoning.. way too much.  Completely overpowered the garlic flavor.  Next time, I may just sprinkle.  Otherwise.. very good!

This was really good! I added a wee bit of olive oil and I used parmesan cheese instead of mozza (just because I thought it would go better with the soup we were having). It was amazing! My bf said it was restaurant quality.

YUM!! I used fresh garlic, whole wheat french loaf, and a dash of salt. I saturated the bread with butter, and only put parmesan instead of mozzarella. It was delicious! I'll use this recipe every time I make garlic bread!

Worked great for me. I did put one clove of crushed garlic in the butter plan and allow it to absorb some of the garlic flavor. Used a very small amount of garlic powder.

I used this recipe on regular wheat bread and it turned out good. I melted my butter in the microwave instead of using a saucepan to save time. I don't know what the difference would be. I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley out of habit - it wasn't that good but that was my fault. The cheese on top was a nice addition.

I happened to have the cheese on hand, so I thought I'd try thing.  It was really good and easy.  It did not have that WOW factor I look for, but it was good and I most likely will make again.

Tasted like normal garlic bread...very easy! I think it needs something, but I personally can't put my finger on it. I think I'll read through the reviews and see if anyone else has suggested anything.

This was wonderful and so easy.  I used a mini french loaf because there is only 2 of us.  Both of us really liked this.

OMG good! I used crushed real garlic instead of the powder. Loved the cheese on these guys. Great :)

I thought this was pretty average... didn't seem like anything special to me.  Altough the fresh basil was really nice.

I've often been lazy and bought my garlic bread pre-made.  Not any more.  This was easy and delicious.  I didn't have parsley so used oregano and basil.  I also split my loaf in half as it was easier.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The kids get the vote on this one being that they liked this much better than I did and in the end, that's all that really matters anyway. I guess I'm just a purist and prefer my garlic bread the traditional way. Will certainly make it again at their request. Thank you Noelle!

Excellent and easy way to accompany any Italian feast. Why worry about spending alot of time on the bread when you can have "home made" garlic bread in an instant.

I only used 1 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and that was plenty of garlic for us.  This is very good just adjust the garlic to your personal taste.

I have to say some of the yummiest garlic bread I've ever had.  Beats the stuff in the grocery store hands down.  Quick and easy especially for someone like me who is extremely challenged in the kitchen.  Thank you Noelle!!!

Very tasty; the cheese helps keep the center of the bread soft and chewy, while the edges crisp nicely.

Quite possibly the best garlic bread I've ever made... or consumed.  I wondered, however, if combining fresh garlic with the butter as it melted might be another approach.  I'll try that the next time... but will remember this quick and easy recipe.  Thank you!
