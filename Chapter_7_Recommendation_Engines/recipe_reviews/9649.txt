These were a success.  I also increased the amount of water to about 3 tablespoons and they turned out well this way.

Good cookie bu baking them 18 minutes makes biscoti.  I made mine 10 - 11 min for a softer cookie.

Nice, but a dry dough.  I had to add 3 tbs more water, so maybe an extra egg next time.  I left out the nuts but followed the rest of the recipe.  Not sure of the purpose of dissolving the baking soda, though--probably just as easy to just mix it in.  I baked at 13 minutes each, not 15-20.  Overall, a nice hearty cookie but needs a few adjustments.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted very healthy. A bit dry also.
