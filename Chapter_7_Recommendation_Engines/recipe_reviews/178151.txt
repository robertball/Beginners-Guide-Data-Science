I decided to give this one a shot, in spite of my skepticism about the amount of flour - it's more than a cup more than my usual recipe, so I was a little nervous. I followed the recipe exactly, including the (also scary, LOL) 300 degree oven temperature. This is a great cookie for all the chewy CC cookie lovers, I think that's the effect of the additional flour - a chewier cookie. The dough is VERY stiff to work with, my KA didn't like it much. Very tasty cookies, and I'll probably make them again!

well.. I think with a title like this one they're going to disappoint.  They are really really good cookies! I like them.  They would be amazing with some ice-cream.  I would have given them a five if the title wasn't so ... final.  I do recommend only putting eight cookies on a sheet, when you flatten them they get much bigger then you might expect.  so to avoid an unfortunate mess just put less cookies on the sheet.   *edit*   I have made these cookies MANY times now.  I think this is officially "my" chocolate chip recipe.  I usually use 1/2C margarine and 1/2C shortening, it saves on using up all my butter at one time.  I also don't usually put in all the vanilla it calls for (depending on who I'm cooking them for, my mom hates cookies with a lot of vanilla flavor)  If your using vanilla extract use the full amount, but if your using REAL vanilla, you can half the amount and they still turn out wonderful.   I've also noticed that sometimes I don't always use the last 1/2 C of flour, I add the flour 1/2 a cup at a time and sometimes 3 1/2 cups is too much.

There are SO many great chocolate chip cookie recipes, many of them on this site. I can't remember ever making a "bad" chocolate chip cookie. This is no exception, but it is not exception-AL compared to other great recipes. While it may not hold the distinction of being "the best," it nevertheless holds its own with the best of them. Looking over the reviews I noticed these described many ways - cakey, crumbly, chewy, crunchy and more - all are correct. Experienced bakers will know that how cookies turn out, even with the same recipe, will depend on a number of variables such as size, thickness and how long they're baked.  In my case, I prepared the dough as written, but couldn't bring myself to bake them at 300 degrees. I baked them at 350 and they were delightfully crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle, just how I like them. After scooping the cookies onto the sheet I flattened them only slightly and they turned out pleasantly thick and substantial. All and all, I was very pleased with this recipe - and hubs and I were both very pleased with the resulting cookie.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for! The cookies came out chewy, with a crispy outer edge - perfection! Just like another reviewer said, they're like Subway cookies. I like my cookies chewy, and the crispy outer edge is enough so that it doesn't fall apart and doesn't appear underbaked. It is a large cookie - about 1/4 cup dough for each. 

Notes:
The recipe didn't say if brown sugar was to be tightly packed or lightly packed; I made mine tightly packed. I didn't grease the baking sheet since the recipe didn't call for it, not a problem at all... it actually came out a bit greasy. I left the cookies on the baking sheet for 10 minutes after taking them out of the oven (15 mins baking time), then put them on paper towels to absorb some of the grease. 

I can understand how the title can put some people off. It uses a lot of ingredients and I was a bit afraid to make the full recipe but went for it anyway. I'm more than happy I did!!! SINFULLY YUMMY!

Sorry, but these aren't the best I've ever eaten. 

For my tastes, they're way too big, dry and have too much flour. 

That said, the ingredients list shows 6 tablespoons of white sugar, but it's not called for in the instructions. Maybe the white sugar is not supposed to be there, but I added it with the brown sugar. Maybe that's why mine came out dry and hard.

Also, when baking at 300 degrees, there was no way these cookies were done in 17 minutes. I kept going until the edges were golden, and the result was that they were just hard lumps. I upped the oven temp and the second batch seemed a little better. 

I don't have any incentive to try again, but my recommendation to anyone attempting this recipe is to boost the oven temp to 325 and make sure you flatten the dough balls quite thin.

The Byrds are a family of stubborn authority-fighters. We hate to be told what we can't say. Still, not one of us was able to say these aren't the best we've ever eaten. A couple of us said they were ONE of the best, but no one said NOT the best. So, there you have it. I've made the reipe several times with great results except for when I doubled the batch. If you double this recipe you probably don't want the full amount of flour, so add it slowly. I didn't. The cookies are still fabulous, but not as chewy as I would like. My fault. Thanks so much for this one!

I had a hard time believing there was a chocolate chip cookie recipe better than the one I already use. Curiosity got me and I tried them out. Absolutely fabulous! A nice big cookie...great for wrapping individually for a gift. Took a little longer in my oven...more like 18-20 minutes. I'm going to go hide them before the kids come home from school!

A great recipe!  I have spent years trying out various chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this one reminds me of the delicious, big ones you can buy at Subway or lots of sandwich shops.  They are a bit greasy, which is why I took off one star.  Otherwise, a delicious treat and a nice chewy texture with a crispy outer edge.  I made the cookies about 1/2 the original size so you can 2 without quite as much guilt.  :)

These really are amazing cookies! It's silly to rate them lower than 5 because of their name. Be prepared for stiff dough, but I still managed, even with a hand held mixer. A bag of chocolate chips is approx. 2 cups, and I made mine heaping. The cooling time on the sheets is important, since it lets the middle of the cookie finish baking through. My kids couldn't believe I gave them a cookie THAT big. The only down side to these is that the dough, being stiffer, isn't so tasty uncooked. More for the oven, then.

These cookies are AMAZING I LOVED them! I'm a very picky cookie eater and i've tried several different recipes. These held their size, they were FAT, and a slight crisp on the outside but oh, so soft and chewy/gooey on the inside. The dough is a little bit weird, kinda crumbly, but yummy. I fed them to my big family of 11 and they all absoluteley loved them. I can't wait to make them again.

These actually do live up to their rather cocky title. I've baked so many different cookies over the years and none of them have ever been as good as the ones you find in a bakery. Some have been close, but these are really amazing!! My friend even went so far as to say they're the best he's eaten (without being prompted!).  I halved the recipe and it worked just as well. I think I also made them smaller than the recipe calls for since with 1/2 the recipe I actually still made 20 cookies and they were done in 13 minutes.   They stay so perfectly soft and chewy in the middle with a wonderful crunchy edge!  I used non-hydrogenated margarine as I really don't like using butter too much because of the cholesterol factors, I also find with cookies it makes them crunchier and thinner.   Oh and for the people finding this comes out crumbly - you are probably using too much flour. When measuring flour into cups make sure you spoon it in and level it off, scooping the flour *with* the cup will result in too much flour because it compacts it and so you get more!  Also, leaving them on the baking sheet for 20 minutes is a typo I think! I left them for the usual 3-4 minutes as with most other cookie recipes and as long as you're careful (as always) that's plenty long for them to set!

Now, as crazy as this may seem, I'm choosing to rate this recipe by rating the RECIPE, not the recipe TITLE...crazy, I know...Drum roll, please:  da, da, da, da, da, da, da:  5 STARS!  And I have some serious high bar standards to earn a 5 star for a chocolate chip cookie recipes (cause, really, aren't they ALL good?!)...to earn the full 5, they have to become my *go to* choc chip cookie recipe. Now, I'm not ready to say these have dethroned my "old standby" Half & Halfs (from AR), but they are def at least tied.  I followed the recipe to a "T" (though I do always sub sea salt for regular salt as I like a little salty bite in my sweets), even the *scary* 300 degree baking them, and I was not disappointed.  This recipe seems to make a ton:  I baked 2 large (1/4 C) cookies, froze 36 golf ball sized rounds of batter for use in my Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cupcakes, and baked 8 more 1/8 C cookies.  Try these, you will not be disappointed!  Thanks, Felix, for a great recipe (and I give you props for your creative title, as well...it's a shame people rate based on the title as opposed to the recipe)!!

I was hesitant to even try this recipe because I have another recipe i usually use but I am so glad I did. I only made about 6 giant cookies, which my kids loved, because my husband wanted to bring them to work, so i made the rest smaller. They were delicious. I had no problem whatsover with the batter, it was slightly crumbly but as soon as you rolled the dough into balls it was fine. I baked them at 325 for 18 minutes. Perfect.

This recipe doesn't need another 5 star review, but it deserves one, from us, so here it is. :)  These were, indeed, the best chocolate chip cookies I've made. I have always doubled the vanilla in a recipe, but never used this much. What a great flavor they had.  As good at that was, though, it is matched by their texture. They were crispy on the outside and nice and gooey inside.  I doubled this so won't need to make any for a while, but when I do, it will be this recipe. Thanks for the submission! :)

Alrighty, here's the deal... These are GOOD. I made the recipe exactly as stated. Changed nothing. I even measured out just under 1/4c of cookie dough, per cookie, per the instructions. I did not flatten the dough. In 17 minutes at 300 degrees, I was gifted with thick, soft, cookies. They're a little heavier then the usual choco chip treat. And by that I mean more dense, a la brownie, and less greasy, then my usual recipe. This comes from the extra flour/sugar and less butter I suppose. It's a little different, so die hard buttery, crispy cookie lovers might be disappointed but I think they're incredible. Soft, thick, doughy and perfect. Thanks so much for sharing Felix K. These will definitely stay in my go to cookie rotation.

This recipe should have a full five star rating, it is absolutely perfect and different than any other chocolate chip cookie recipe which sets this one apart. I made regular sized cookies using my cookie scoop, but my favorite is making larger cookies using my 1/4 measuring cup. This is the one, hand down. Try this!

This is the perfect cookie texture I have been searching for! I made my cookies out of 2T of dough and did not flatten, they spread evenly and slid right off my worn, old pans(that never happens!)The taste was good, my husband was REALLY happy with them, I perfer the more complex flavors in the Mrs Fields recipe on this site though. I used the big Guittard chips, which didnt work so well with the size of these, next time Ill use regular sized chips. Oh just as I was about to submit this review, my husband looked up from his computer and said, "by the way, those cookies are what sugary dreams are made of. They're soooo good!" hahaha

I don't eat chocolate chip cookies after they've sat in a container for days - until these. These changed my life. Do you read me? Life changing cookies. Now that I've got that out of the way... I made each cookie about 1 1/2 tbsps, and flattened as directed. They do spread out quite a bit, but not so much that they're too flat. I used only a scant tsp of salt (because I used margarine - *gasp* I know, margarine.) and that's salty enough for me. I didn't need to leave them on the sheet for 20 minutes. About 5 did the trick for me. Even the ones I overcooked were great. Thank you!

I used wheat flour instead of white, and they were some of the best choc. chip cookies ever. I think the wheat flour made a big difference!

Excellent cookie. I made JUST AS IS, with the idea that I could make again with modifcations after trying them. They were perfect. YES, cook them at 300, and YES, let them cool 20 minutes on the baking sheet. They were still chewy in the center days later, but crisp at the edges. LOVE!!!

These were OK, not as good as I had hoped.  The family will be glad to eat them but they just aren't as stunning as I thought the would be.

If you like a nice, soft, chewy chocolate chip cookie, these are the ones!!!! My only issue with the recipe is it fails to mention that these are LARGE cookies. I placed them on the cookie sheet as I would regular cookies and they really spread out. Next batch, I placed only 6 cookies on the baking sheet and that was perfect. I used parchment paper and they came out beautifully. Also realize that these do NOT brown on top, so cook them for specified time, and they will finish setting on the baking sheet. (One batch I turned up to 325 degrees as a reviewer suggested, and they came out lightly browned, but also crispy instead of soft & chewy.) So stick with EXACT directions and these are fabulous!  A bit more time & effort than the recipe on the chocolate chip package, but well worth it! Thanks Felix....they ARE the best I've ever eaten!

These definitely are the BEST chocolate chip cookies!  My 9 yr. old grandson agrees too!  I made them just like the recipe says except I traded 1 stick of margarine for 1 stick of butter.  I baked them at 300º for 17 min. and let them cool for 20.  They didn't look done when I took them out of the oven but after setting they turned out just like they were supposed to

These are fabulous. I wouldn't say the best I've ever had but really darn good and I would definitely make again! The only change I had to make was that I didn't have quite enough butter so I made up the difference with butter flavoured shortening. Yum!

These were the best I've ever made, but the best I've ever eaten were from a local bakery. I've been trying to make cookies that good ever since I tasted the bakery ones. These come pretty darn close. I tend to pick one up every time I see them sitting in the kitchen. And I'm like, "Hey, when did this cookie get into my hand? Oh well, better eat it." Yum.

I'm only giving this 4 stars for three reasons:
1. Any recipe with a title like that is sure to disappoint.
2. Just a personal preference...even though the long baking time and low heat made a good cookie, I found it tedious and time consuming to have to drag out the cookie baking that long. Also, the cookies need to be partially cooled on the pan, which tied up my pans when I needed them for other things.  
3. Another minor personal preference: as the recipe is written these are huge cookies.  I made them half the recommended size and they were just right for us.  Still a nice, big cookie, but more within the range of appropriate for calorie intake!

First impression: Tasted like salty crunchy butter with lumps of chocolate, though the flavor did mellow out after a few days.

Although I enjoyed them, it tasted a lot like the other many recipes I've tried. It's not the flavor that makes me move on, it's the texture. I want a fluffy cake like texture, not a flat kinda greasy one. Next...

Excellent chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I followed the recipe, except that I baked them in a 325 degree oven for 17 minutes.  I kept waiting for these to get more brown on the top - but guess what?  They don't!  They are actually done, and have a very light color.  They do remind me of the cookies at Subway. Thick, crisp on the outside, but soft on the inside.  They are picture perfect as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical of baking a cookie for so long, and at 300 degrees.  I like my cookies a little under done and not crispy or cakey.  For those who think all chocolate chip cookies taste the same, try this recipe!  It is a very different tasting chocolate chip cookie.  It was very good, and had complex layers of flavor, although I'm not sure it's my favorite.    You have to take the cookies out at 15-17 minutes and let them sit on the baking sheet for an additional 20.  You have to!  I think that's why some people baked them too long and ended up with rocks, and others must have tasted them too soon thinking they were underdone.    A good cookie!

Delicious! We followed the recipe as written, and I think we found our new go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies. The only thing I think we could have done to make them bigger, better, and chewier was to have more dough per cookie (we didn't measure the dough, so we might have been a little shy of 3tbl per cookie) and flatten them a bit more prior to baking so they spread out more than up. We used milk chocolate chips this time, and I think that using a semi-sweet or dark chocolate chip might help the flavors in the cookie stand out even more. I love the vanilla flavor - you can definitely taste it in these cookies.

way too much flour. too much vanilla, too much sugar. eliminate 1 cup of the brown sugar, eliminate 1/2 cup of the flour and get rid of 2 teaspoons of the vanilla and use 1 cup butter flavored crisco instead of 1 cup butter.

These are pretty good! However, I like my old chocolate chip cookie recipe more. I followed this one to a T. Crispy outsides with chewy middles. You'll definitely need a big glass of milk to drink while you eat these.

I agree that this recipe makes a beautiful cookie. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, making these with my son for his class only making littler cookies with my small cookie scoop. I baked these first for ten minutes, then again for eight. Seems to me they're just right at about nine minutes. I thought these were good, but not my absolute favorite. I agree with Marianne that these were a little salty. I'm sure his class of first graders will appreciate them and inhale them. Thanks for sharing.

I can't stop eating these, therefore, they are awesome!  They are soft and chewy and have a wonderful flavor (love all the vanilla).  I used real unsalted butter and added an extra 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  If you are using an insulated cookie sheet, I would recommend adding and extra 1 - 2 minutes onto the baking time, but don't overbake them!

These are really good and more of the type of chocolate chip cookie I'm looking for.  I don't like the cake-like homemade chocolate chip cookies.  These were not cake-like at all!  I didn't use the 6 TBl of sugar(I thought 2 cups of brn sugar was plenty, I might try 1 1/2 cups of brn sugar next time.)  You do need to flatten them. I used about 1 1/2 Tbl of dough per cookie and got 4 dozen decent sized cookies. I will be making again.  I would bake for 12 minutes at 300 for a nice soft cookie.  Store in an airtight container so they don't dry out.  I made all the dough balls and baked 2 dozen and froze the other 2 dozen, so all i need to do is just place them on the cookie sheet and bake.  Very good cookie recipe!  They look like bakery cookies when finished!
**UPDATE** I made half the recipe and only used 3/4 cup brown sugar, did everything else as recipe states.  Oh, I flattened the dough down and I made mine smaller by making each cookie 1 heaping Tablespoon (I made 16 cookies)  Baked at 300F for 14 minutes and were perfect.  I used milk choc chips and white choc chips.  They were a little greasy, but still good.

I am always disappointed when I make chocolate chip cookies.  Mine always...and I mean always... come out very flat...no matter what recipe I use.  I decided to give this recipe a shot and am very glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and these are awesome!  Perfect!  My family loved them!  I think that anyone who hasn't enjoyed these cookies must have messed the recipe up somewhere.  Yummers!

These are wonderful!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  The cookies aren't the normal crunchy ones that we're used but I think these are just what my family has been looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly and it's true, they don't look "done" when you take them out of the oven, but they are perfect when you take them off the cooled cookie sheet.

YEAH! NO MORE FLAT COOKIES!

I don't like shortening but always get flat cookies with butter.  I've always wanted to try more flour and sugar but couldn't figure out the right combination. These turned out PERFECT!

ok I tried these again and had to change my review.  They didn't turn out so perfect.  I admit the first time I used half white and half brown sugar and they were better. This time my family didn't like them as much.  I still like this recipe but will change the sugar.

These a good cookies. When warm, they were pretty bland and had a weird texture. BUT they cooled hard and crunchy and nummy! They reminded me of a super awesome version of chips ahoy! They're great for dunking in coffee or milk! :) I liked em!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! Nestle's recipe for chocolate chip cookies were too "cakey". I was looking for something crunchy on the outside and still soft on the inside, and this is it! I added cocoa to make them chocolate (about 1/2 cup because I cut the recipe in half). These were very good so I can't wait to try them without the cocoa too.

very good cookie- perfect texture after exactly 15min baking time. i didn't change a thing when i made these... but i might leave out about 1/4C of the flour next time, as they had a sort of flour-y aftertaste.

Sorry - not for me. :/ While the flavor was alright -the texture was all wrong for me. For those of you who really enjoy a cakelike chocolate chip cookie - you might really enjoy these. For those of you who prefer a more traditional toll-house consistency - these are all wrong. Too "fluffy" for a cookie - too chewy. It was worth a try and I love the name so I had to try them - but this isn't the consistency I enjoy for cookies.

EDIT: Had to increase the rating. These were better after sitting out a day so they weren't so soft. However, it seems to be all personal preferance as my daughter and husband really enjoyed them. Best? No sorry but they were alright.

OH MY GOSH. These cookies look amazing, and they taste amazing too! I did everything dead on, no changes. I have no idea why people think this a lot of flour, my dough came out so soft and pliable but not sticky at all, which is the kind of dough I aim for when making cookies. Soooooo yummy. Each cookie is almost 1/4 cup of dough, so I was a bit worried at the oven temperature but they turned out fantastic. So soft and chewy. This is definitely my go-to cookie recipe from now on! I can't wait to try it as smaller cookies.

Amazing.  I think it's all been said before.  I have never come across a cookie recipe that produces a cookie that looks so perfect and tastes as good as this one does.  It was so easy that my 4 year old helped me make them.  My only concern is that people will think I cheated and bought a pre-made cookie dough :-)

Flour here is milled a bit finer than, say Gold Medal, for instance, so I tried compensating by adding a bit more flour (maybe a full 1/4 cup) to make the dough less manageable as described by other reviewers. I must have come really close. These are so good...and not difficult in the least! Worst part was waiting 20 minutes to remove from pan!

VERY good! I followed the recipe exactly with one little difference. My first batch I let cool on the cookie sheet as stated, for 20 minutes. The cookies were a little hard to get off the sheet after 20 minutes. The next batch I let cool for 10 minutes and it made a big difference in ease of transferring the cookies to the rack to finish cooling. I had no problems with them spreading too much as some other reviewers did. I made them golf ball size and flattened slightly as directed. They are crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. Yummy, thanks Felilx!

These are not the Best! but they are pretty good. I prefer a softer cookie myself, however my husband loved these! im hoping I can find a happy median. You can tell from the picture that the texture is a harder one. My family thought they were store bought and couldnt believe how nicely they looked. Pretty good so says the man of the house :) as for me... not bad, ALSO ABSOLUTELY NO NEED FOR THE OFFENSIVE BAKING POWDER!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND OMIT IT. TRUST ME! I have been baking cookies for years and couldnt bring myself to add it.

I will confirm the title of this recipe. These turned out pretty doggone fantastic. I added a scoop of white chocolate chips just to get them out of the pantry. Otherwise, I made no alterations to the recipe. They cookies turned out great and two days later are just as yummy.

An excellent recipe for chewy cookies.  They keep well, if you have any leftovers. I made some large, as directed, but prefer them smaller so I can eat more and have more to share.  Don't tell people you made them or they'll bug you for more.

These are definitely in my "TOP THREE" chocolate chip cookie recipes.  I did use butter Crisco and a little bit less of the brown sugar (RAN OUT!).  Baked for 19 minutes.  Just the right texture - perfectly balanced crispiness and chewiness.

I'm not sure I would say that these are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten, but they were very good! I used the dough as the base for the "Cream Cheese Cookie Cups" recipe on this site. They baked up beautifully, and tasted great! Thanks for sharing; these cookies are very tasty! ++++++++++++++++Update+++++++++++++++++++ I just changed my review to 5 stars because I used the dough again for the base of a cookie pizza. This dough works great as a base, and makes really, really good cookies that stay soft, but not puffy. Thanks for sharing; I must say this is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever used!

Maybe not "the BEST", but these are delicious! Had to bake them for about 20 minutes even though my cookies were smaller than the recipe said to make them. And they were kind of hard so I put 3 pieces of bread in the container with them. It made them so nice and soft!

This is my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe ever.  They come out perfect every time.  I prefer my cookies soft, so these are just what I was looking for.  I make them for bake sales, and I get major compliments every time.  My kids friends love them, and always try to barter for them when I put them in their lunch boxes.  I make no adjustments to the ingredients, but I do make them slightly smaller.  I get about 30 cookies out of this recipe.  I will probably never use another recipe again!  Thank you Felix!

I'm not saying this is not a nice, tasty giant cookie, but I am very disappointed that mine came out soft-chewy and smooth, a bit thin instead of puffed up and crinkly like many of the pictures. The way one measures flour (I follow flour company directions on the bag to stir/fluff before measuring)makes a big difference; should I have just scooped the flour, which gives up to 1/4 cup extra flour per cup in the dough? I also use extra large eggs, but don't know what size the original recipe calls for. I won't be repeating this because I have a big crunchy/chewy that works better for me.

No changes to the recipe.  I did try a few things with the dough.  The size was too big or the oven temp is off for me.  It was too low at 300, 350 seemed too high.  I tried smaller sizes.  Just not the right recipe for me. Thanks anyway.

Three and a half c. flour is too much. No wonder the cookies are dry,and I've never heard of such a low temp to bake them. Dry on outside,raw in the middle,no, these are not the best cookies I've ever eaten

Stick to the chocolate chip cookie recipes that you find on the back of the chocolate chip bags. This is the WORST chocolate chip cookie....it's a pain to make & they taste gross.

I made these exactly as the recipe is written, only adjusting my oven temp up a little (my oven runs a little cooler).  They did not need to cool for 20 min on the sheet...more like 5.  Like other reviewers mention, these cookies resemble what I remember Subway cookies to taste like.  The best recipe?  Depends on what you like in a cookie.  Is it my favorite?  Depends on the day!  They are very good, though, and worth trying out!

these are excellent cookies - thought the name was a bit over confident, however they are pretty darn good! Although because of the 300 oven takes a long time to bake, but the outcome at the lower temp makesa the difference (upped it to 350 for one batch and immediatly lowered it after the one tray)

Finally, a cookie that is that perfect balance of crunchyness towards the outside and has a chewy middle. I've tried a few different recipes listed that have made that claim, and though the flavor was ok, many turned out cakey. The flavor and presentation was wonderful on these. Thank you very much

Tried it twice. Fail both times. They were like muffins and when I tried baking them longer, they burned. Definitely not the best I've ever had. Won't be doing again.

A beautiful cookie that is soft and chewy.  These won't last very long at our house.  My search for a great chocolate chip cookie recipe is over.

I would give it 5 more stars if I could. Definitely want to spoon the flour in and use large room temp eggs.For the  2nd batch I did decrease baking powder to 1/2 tsp. and increase the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp. also just a pinch of salt as the butter was salted. Beautiful looking cookie too! Oh, almost forgot, used an ice cream scoop and it was super fast. Just scoop and press them down to 1/4 in rounds. Oven temp and bake time were perfect.

These cookies are fantastic!!! The dough is thick, but the cookies are the perfect mix of crispy outside and chewy inside. They freeze well too!!!

These are great cookies but I experimented with the baking temperatures to see which is best.  I followed the directions exactly until baking them.  I baked one batch at 300 degrees and those turned out very pale and soft.  The next batch I baked at 350 degrees and those turned out crispy on the edges and chewy interiors.  The 350 degree batch was my favorite.  Fresh out of the oven, these tasted very sugary.  Tasting them today, they are soft and not as sugary as tasting them last night.  A good recipe but for me is better when baked at 350 degrees.

You really gotta live up to a name like that and these do NOT. A previous poster nailed it on the head....many variables to consider, but the quantity of flour and sparse wet ingredients should have been a warning about the flour hockey pucks about to emerge from my oven.

I have to tell you that I have made many choc chip cookie recipes. This is one of the best! I use a one tablespoon scoop instead of the 3tbls so it makes about 3 1/2 doz cookies. I also added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts

These are some darn wonderful chocolate chip cookies! They are almost perfect! Great flavor and everyone I know loves them. I only have 3 issues with these cookies. First issue, the batter is nearly impossible to work with. It is nice and firm, however, it is so greasy that the chocolate chips will not stay. They slide down to the bottom of the batter and you end up with cookies that have tons of chocolate and cookies that hardly have any. Second issue, I found that the 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips was too much. I ended up having about a quarter of the bag left in the bottom of the bowl, and hated to throw them away. Third, if you like soft, chewy cookies, you might want to cut down on the baking time. However, these cookies are worth the trouble!  They are melt-in-your-mouth yummy! Thanks so much for the recipe, Felix! They really are the best.

marvellous! this cookie is chewy as I like it and taste just nice. and before baking, the texture is very nice and easy to work with. I can tell that it's gonna turn out nice just looking at the batter. I added 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon and 3/4cups of chopped almond. Yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

Cookie dough. Who really likes cookies that aren't done? They probably are good, if baked long enough and at a proper temp. Never, never again.

They weren't sweet enough and I dont think they had enough chocolate chips.  Alot of the times I was eating a cakey cookie with not much of anything in it.  I turned the oven to 325 aswell and flatened them to paper thin to try and get the chips noticed.  I will probably experiment with them again.  But I dont think the are the best I've EVER eaten.  There are others on this site that I thought were better!  Sorry, and thanks!

These are the best if you followe the recipe.  I don't understand how someone can give less than 5 stars when they didn't follow the directions exactly.  I think the secret was the lower baking temperature.

These cookies were a major hit at my house! I did tweak a few things: Oven to 350, only 2 tsp of vanilla (The extract I use is pure and VERY strong!), KA White Whole Wheat flour (because that's what was in my cupboard), and just a skoch more than a tsp of baking powder to compensate for the whole wheat flour. I followed the instructions precisely, and ended up with huge, chewy, sinfully delicious cookies. The extra vanilla is so good! Makes the cookies smell heavenly while baking, and tastes almost like caramel with all that brown sugar. YUM, I will definitely make these again!

These are to die for.  I added a bag of Heath milk chocolate toffee chips in addition to the chocolate chips, meaning to just pour a fraction of the bag into the dough when -whoops- the whole bag poured in!  What makes me favor this recipe is the brown sugar, butter only, heavy vanilla & salt.  Keeper!

I was very disappointed with the way these turned out.  They were not chewy to begin with and by the next morning were rock hard.  This much butter is bound to make a less chewy cookie, I'll keep looking for a new recipe.

These are not the best I've ever eaten.  I made them two times, exactly as the recipe is written.  The texture was cake-like and I was looking for a chewy cookie.  Flattening the balls of dough is a good idea, though.  I have to learn to be wary of recipes with names like this.

Yeah, I'm not even going to try to say these aren't SOME of the best I've ever eaten, because they are... Mine baked for 21 minutes at 300* in an electric oven and I don't think they were as big as directed. They look and taste like professional or store bought cookies - and you can't argue with that. ~UPDATE~ I used Earth Balance buttery spread in place of butter and they're still fantastic. Baked at 350* for 15 minutes and they're perfection.

I didn't think these were that fantastic.  I made them exactly as the recipe stated, and they took forever to bake, seemed dry, and wer sickenly sweet.  The dough was really dry too, and while they didn't taste bad, they just aren't worth raving over.   I made a second batch, reduced the brown sugar to 1 1/2 C. and baked for 14 minutes at 325 and they came out much better.  I think the 300 degree baking time is way too low, and dried out the cookie due to the extended baking time needed at such a low temp.

These were delicious cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great. The only thing I did was cook the cookies for 10 minutes, then I took them out and added choc. chips or m&m's to the top, then put them back in the oven for 7 more minutes. They are chewy, yet still a little crisp. A very pretty cookies as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I give it three stars, partly cause I can say these aren't the best I've ever eaten, despite other reviewers saying it's stupid to rate it based on the title. Secondly, I found that when they were fresh out of the oven, they were wonderfully chewy, but by the next day they were just about rock solid. I might try the recipe again sometime, and maybe add less flour next time, I'm pretty sure that's what's making it go hard.

If I could rate these as cookie dough only I would be a 10.  I'm not a cookie dough person and I loved these as the dough; the cookie part I could've done without, it was just an okay cookie for me, but it does make the yummiest cookie dough

I usually like to make my cc cookies w/chunky peanut butter and walnuts.  DH wanted just chocolate chip cookies.  These have been recommended a lot on the exchange, so I gave it a try and I was not disappointed.  The only change I made was to sub half whole wheat flour for the ap.  Compliments from the entire family!  Thank you for sharing.

Umm, Wow!  We have pretty high expectations when it comes to baking, especially chocolate chip cookies.  I must say everyone thinks these are pretty spectacular.  They wondered if they were allowed to eat them they looked like they were for company.  I will say, the second batch into the oven was a little thinner.  I think it's because the dough was sitting out and got warmer.  Next time I will keep it slightly chilled.  Followed the instructions to a tee, I did, however, use 1/2 C. margarine & 1/2 butter.  Butter results in a thinner cookie because it melts faster than margarine or crisco.  So, I wanted to play it safe. Thanks Felix K!

Excellent recipe as written.  I have been using the Martha Stewart chocolate chip cookie recipe for the last several years, but it has now been replaced.  Everyone in my family agreed that yes, this is the best chocolate chip cookie.

Very good - a little chewy and crunchy together. Be careful not too bake too long as they do not brown much.

The name made me laugh and I had to try them. Seems they came out perfect. Hubby said they were very rich, and "really big".. So he only had two.. I read that the dough wasn't all that tasty... I know mine was! Oh, I used chocolate chunks. I think I'll be taking them to a baby shower.. Thanks!  (edit:) these have become required by hubby for his lunches every day. I add almonds to them, for his taste, and he won't let me run out his favorite cookies!

I was really hoping this would be "the" recipe. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I followed the receipe exactly, except I used half the vanilla after reading some other reviews. These cookies were not chewy at all. They weren't even as good as the recipe right off the bag of chocolate chips! Sorry Felix K., I have to say it ... "These aren't the best I've ever eaten."

I did`t change any thing , and the result was great, I just think the cookies need more chocolate chips may be 1/2 cup or more.

These cookies were good but certainly not the best I ever tasted.  I was disappointed because I really thought they would be the best.  I think it had too much of a brown sugar/vanilla taste to it.

This is one-heckuva recipe!  Cookies come out great!  I agree with previous reviewers - if you are making the cookies as big as the recipe calls for, it's best to reduce the amount of cookies on the baking sheet because they do grow quite a bit... I actually only put 6 on a sheet.  And, I needed about 17 - 19 minutes to get the cookies to the right baked consistency.  These are just my own personal findings, though!  This receipe is definitely worth a try!!

These were okay. Honestly I was expecting a lot better, but they were still good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half semisweet and half milk chocolate chips. Maybe I'll try again, like I said they weren't bad, just sort of plain tasting.

very good cookies. everyone LOVED them but they were a little too cakey for my taste. i followed the recipe exactly and they turned out way bigger than i usually make my cookies. i got 34 cookies (only fit 8 on a cookie sheet). still searching for the very best chocolate chip cookie recipe but this is definitely a keeper!

I'm not going to try to say these aren't the best because wow! I was digging the explosion of flavor in my mouth when I was eating these! These cookies are like the ones you get at a bakery. I did not deviate from the recipe at all! Crispy edges, moist centers. Wow. Very good. Make sure you let them cool the whole time.

These are the best cookies I have ever made, they go out instantly at any social gathering. The key is to use ingrediants that have more flavor, i.e dark brown suger and dark chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet kind. Also, take them out of the oven as soon as you can withdraw a toothpick cleanly from the center of one of the bigger cookies. Also, if you melt the butter completely instead of just creaming it, it will give you a chewier cookie, for those of us who like chewy cookies.

THIS IS THE BEST EVER CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE EATEN BY ME!! Followed the recipe exactly. Replacing my Nestle's Toll House recipe with this one.     2-26-10 Made these today and used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour to try and make them a little more diabetic friendly. They taste delicious.

Really good!  They may not be the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had but I don't think they should loose a star for that because they were excellent.  Great flavor, not overly sweet, crisp edges with a chewy middle...just all around a very tasty cookie.  This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've tried so far from this site.  Make these!

Longest 17 minutes ever. These were great. I followed the recipe exactly (but used 1/2 a bag of choc. chips b/c I don't like very many). The first pan was gone before the 2nd pan was out of the oven! I have tried pretty much every recipe on this site for choc. chip cookies, and this is the best one for me so far! My search is over!

Excellent cookies!! Followed the recipe as written the first time then the other times I only changed the size of my cookies so I could get more out of a batch. These cookies will not look done but will set up fine. They are very soft and chewy just the way I like them. You can get about 4 dozen out of a batch when you make rounded teaspoon sized cookies.

These are good but not the best I've ever eaten.  I think I liked the raw cookie dough better then the baked cookie acually.  The cookie itself didn't get the nice brown colouring from baking either.  On a postive note, the cookie had a nice crunch on the outside and a chewy  inside which we really like. It also doesn't have the (sickening)sweet and nothing but sugar taste as alot of C.C.cookies do. I followed instructions and found the bake time right on. Thanks

I should have read all the bad reviews and I wouldn't have tried these.  DH and I don't like cake-like cookies at all because the chewy gooey ones are soooo delicious. These were just dry dry dry and I followed every step of the recipe as written. Sorry

On rater said it wasn't done in 17 minutes, then said it was too dry after cooking them for more time.  I think that was your mistake.  Take them out in 17 minutes and let them sit for 10 min. before taking them off the pan.  Then they will be perfect.  I used a size 40 scoop.  Leveled the scoop and I did not flatten them.  Cooked them for exactly 17 min., took them out and let them cool on the pan for 17 min.  They are just perfect.  I made them exactly like the recipe called.  The sugar does go in with the brown sugar.  One rater said to add the flour in slowly.  This was important.  I added 2 cups.  Stopped the mixer to scrape the sides.  Then added the rest of the flour without stopping the machine.  It does get thick and it will tax the motor if you stop and start the mixer at the end.  If you stop it and then think it needs to be mixed more, you will have to mix it by hand or risk damaging your motor.  These are simply great cookies!  I will repost tomorrow and let you know how these cookies rate a day old.

What a fantastic cookie recipe.  The flavor was excellent.  I did make the cookies a little bit smaller than what the directions said.  But I followed the ingredients as specified and they turned out so good.  This is definitely a cookie recipe I would make again.  Thanks for sharing it!!

These cookies never browned at 300 degrees, I ended up leaving them in the oven for about 20 minutes and they still did not brown nicely. However, they tasted great. The next day I used the left over dough and made regular 1tbsp sized cookies and baked them at 350 degrees with a MUCH better result. They were golden chewy and delicious.

Perhaps it was the unsalted butter, but these cookies did not work out for me.  They were flatter than pancakes despite my very best efforts at following the directions precisely in my VERY OWN quest for the perfect chocolate cookie.  I was so hopeful I was practically chanting Felix's name as I spooned them onto my parchment paper lined pan.  (Was it the parchment paper?: )    At the end of the evening, I had a whole lot of cookies to show for my efforts, but not one of them was the perfect cookie that was promised.    I still honor Felix for his efforts to tinker with his recipe in search of perfection even if our stars (and measuring cups) didn't align.

I think these are the best!  They are crispy on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  I make them about golf ball size and flatten them to about 1/2 inch.  I only put 6 on a sheet because they do spread out.  Do bake them at 300 degrees like the recipe says to do.  Make sure you take them out of the oven when they are just barely golden on the edges - the middle will still look very soft, but if you leave them on the cookie sheet to cool for 10-20 minutes, they'll set up nicely and be really soft and delicious!  Great recipe!  This is my favorite one so far!

I made a triple batch of these for an easy dessert when we had 3 of my hubby's concretors here overnight to do an especially big house foundation.  The 4 men ate all (but 2 that I hid for myself) before dinner time.  I am now expected to make a huge batch of these everytime they have a big job.  They were easy, and very YUMMY!  Thanks for the recipe Felix!

"Simply the best"  The first batch has just come out of the oven and they are delicious.  I made mine quite smaller, about 1 tbsp of dough.  They are crispy on the outside and soft and chewy inside.  These may become the favourite.

Yeah, the title is just a tad obnoxious...but hey they are probably the best chocolate chip cookies that I've ever made.  They are super chewy and not cake-like at all.  Thanks Felix.

I really liked these cookies.  Crunchy outside, chewy inside, and a lot of flavor. I also liked that they didn't come flat as a pancake. I added walnuts to mine and thought it gave it that extra delicious flavor.

Nope. The difference in this and my recipe is 1/2 cup more flour, mine bakes at 350, and the offensive baking powder. I've stuck to my recipe for so long I got sucked in by the title. The baking powder changed the texture to a thick, cake-like, non chewy, just "okay" cookie. The low heat needed to bake for about 20 minutes, and still just done. My cookies are even better the next day, in a ziploc with bread-these were drier, and tasted blander.

I found these to be too dry and 'cake like' for my cookie tastes.  The flavor was rather blah and surely needed something to liven them up a bit.  Perhaps with a higher cooking temp they would supply the necessary crunchy edges and chewy center.  I followed the recipe exactly even down to the baking time and was disappointed with my results.  There are much better cookie recipes out there!

"Wow", "the best" those are just some of the words out of my husband and kids mouth after their 1st bite. I was in search of a new recipe since my family said basiclly that my cookies all of a sudden "suck" I couldn't resist trying this recipe especially beacuse of the title. It holds true to it's name, large chewy cookies. There are a ton of choc. chip cookie recipes on this site you can't go wrong with this one.:)

I am currently 6 months pregnant and have been craving some ultra-yummy chocolate chip cookies and these *definitely* lived up to the name. I made mine with packed dark brown sugar and used m&m's candies in place of the chocolate chips. I also made my cookies a little bit smaller... but all adjustments taken into account, these were still the most awesome cookies I've ever eaten. I will be saving this recipe to use again and again. Thanks for satisfying my pregger's craving, Felix K!

LOVE this recipe. It's the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use now and I have made these at least 10 times since finding it. I like to add white chocolate chips, M&Ms to the top, peanut butter, etc. depending on what kind of cookie I'm looking for. This is a fantastic jumping off point. I also use this dough as the dough in Lovestohost's Cookie Dough + Cupcake = The Best Cupcake EVER recipe. Thanks!!!

Great flavor, almost like sugar cookies (with lots of vanilla), but these way too dry for me and too crunchy when cool. I like chewy cookies, and these were not chewy in any way, though I took them out exactly as prescribed. My suggestion to people is that after you mix the flour, baking soda and powder and salt, only add in what your dough can take, and don't overknead the batter (as I did, trying to get the dough to absorb the flour), as this adds to the toughness of the cookies.

Had to try these because of the fun title & the the fact that I'm a Chocolate Chip Cookie connoisseur.  Mine ended up quite flat and too soft.  Being as large as they where, for easy handling they needed to be thicker.  I tried to make a smaller size, but, they got too hard.  The flavor however, was pretty good and they where goobled right up by my kids & their friends!

They don't need any tweeks. Make them as is and you'll be fine. I did use mini chocolate chips (minor tweeks) but I've made these several times already. Nice sweet, chewy cookie just how I like them!

My 30 year old daughter, not knowing the title of this recipe, said she thought these might be the best chocolate chip cookie she's ever eaten" - LOL...I thought they were exceptionally good, as well.  I followed the recipe exactly and therefore netted 24 GIANT cookies (equivalent to three typical sized cookies).  I would definitely make this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing, Felix K!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and this recipe is "right on target" with everything, from the ingredients, amounts, incorporation methods, to the baking temps, times, and instructions. As is (which many recipes on here aren't) this is easily a 5-star recipe. I honestly wouldn't care what this recipe were named, but I find the name fun, and am pretty sure that's how it was intended. Regardless , I think this recipe is headed to a top position where it will earn that title. :) It must have taken a lot of time and effort tweaking this recipe to get it to where it is, and I'm thankful to the submitter for taking that time to develop it, and then share it with the rest of the world. Wonderful, unique, delicious, and downright beautiful to look at CC cookie!!! thank You!!!

Fantastic. We have tried so many different cookie recipes and this one is now at the top of the list. Tastes BETTER than the store bought package of cut and heat. We knew they would be good by looking at the batter, nice and moist and still holds together.

It's a soft cookie.  I like crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside and these did not produce that.

Another 5-star review! This recipe deserves it. So melt in your mouth delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except used my #24 cookie scoop (2 tbs size) and put 9 cookies per parchment lined rimmed cookie sheet. Flattened to about 1/4" per directions. My oven took about 16-17 minutes to bake at the recommended 300 degrees. I was tempted to bake at 350 but I resisted and am glad I did. They don't get the golden brown look but they are deliciously tender and chewy in the middle with a slight crunch to the edges! Oh my!

I have to hand it to you, you have figured it out. I didn't have brown sugar so I substituted equally what was called for with white sugar and 2 tbsp of molasses, also I had really really good butter on hand, Plugra, so I feel that helped a lot AND I divided my chocolate chips with dark chocolate and regular chips which is my secret for cookies every time....all this turned out to be a wild success. Crunchy crust, chewy in the middle, nice, big cookies. It's the next morning and I just ate one...still holds the chewiness the next day! People, seriously, this is the one and I'm very thankful you shared it!

Finally, the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe! I used the exact recipe, but changed the oven temp to 350 and baked for 10 minutes. They turned out great! Thanks for sharing this recipe:)

Not your regular, chewy, chocolate chip cookie.  It is a bakery cookie.  I haven't had one of these in 30 years!  My dad would always go on Saturday to the bakery and get us each a big cookie ~like this!!  More dry, than chewy, but not cakey.  A bakery cookie!  Loved it!  Thank you for the recipe.  PS I used less chips and less sugar.....

I liked these cookies because I am a fan of brown sugar. I didn't make these as large as the recipe called for. Used my cookie scoop then flatted them with the floured bottom of a glass. They didn't spread much more than that in the oven so feel free to put another row on the baking sheet. They were a bit harder the next day but I like them with coffee. Good Cookie

Bam! These cookies totally live up to their given name! First off, I only tweaked the butter ratio, by using one stick of butter and one stick of crisco. This combo makes for a crispy edge and nice chewy center in any cookie recipe. The rest of the recipe I followed to the end, and they turned out beautifully! My tip to those who haven't tried this recipe, (or even for those that have) is follow the instructions exactly as Alex wrote them. Leaving them on the cookie sheet after coming out of the oven is as important as baking them in the oven! Do NOT omit this from your steps. I promise folks if you do every step and ingredient you will end up with outrageous, bakery worthy cookies.  I am very glad I didn't let the neg. reviews intimidate me out of making these cookies. Thank you Alex for your tried and true CCC recipe, it's officially my go to recipe in my home from now on! BAM,

Since I quit cooking with shortening and margarine I've had a hard time finding a chocolate chip cookie recipe using butter that doesn't spread thin. This is the one! They taste great and are just the right thickness. The butter isn't the overwhelming flavor, but you can definitely taste it. I always form my cookies and freeze them for 2 hours before cooking (seems to help when using butter) so the cooking time for me is 30 minutes. Thanks so much for this recipe! Now that I'm not using artificial ingredients, this is my go-to chocolate chip cookie! I also find these make 2.5 dozen hefty cookies.

Finally tried these. Not sure what I did wrong and I even kept the dough cold but they spread out all over the pan:( I exchanged part of the flour for Mesquite flour. It Did compliment the chips in the cookies. The kids really liked the cookies. Thanks Felix:)

Amazing. These really are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten. Chewy and perfect... not too sweet, just tasty goodness. I did add some nutmeg, and if you're not a vanilla fan I'd recommend reducing the vanilla. I don't normally like chocolate chip cookies, but these... make them. Like others have commented, the dough can seem hard to work - it seems really dry for a while, but it'll work out. Remember not to overwork it. Also, my cookies were more like 2 Tbs-sized balls, so they took more like 14 minutes, so be careful.

Let me just add my 5 star review.  Very stiff dough but it makes a great chocolate chip cookie.  I did use the mini chocolate chips so they are very chocolaty.. but that's perfect for me!

These cookies are the best I've had.  I've never made cookies with so much vanilla, but I think it really adds to them.  They are delicious and chewy with a nice crunch on the outside.  The only think I modified was the size of the cookies.  I made the dough into 36 cookies instead of the 24 it says to make the dough into.  I might even make the cookies smaller next time.  They are delicious, but pretty unhealthy, so I don't want to make them so big.  But overall, I loved this recipe and will be saving it in my cook book for sure!

well, felix is right.  crunchy, melty, the texture is so great.  thanks for sharing this.
i gotta say, i did not have regular sugar so i used confection sugar, and guessing from experience, it may have given it more of a crisp outer texture, which is exactly what i love.  the cookies esthetically cook up beautifully.

ok, so i am one to try any chocolate chip cookie recipe.  These are really good, and even better fresh out of the oven.  I changed a couple things, added 1T of milk and only 3 tsp of vanilla.  Messed around a little with the temp.  Just good cookies!  The name of them is why i even tried it, and i'm glad i did:)

These are great cookies if you want some just like at the sandwich shops- but they did not keep well in my experience so I recommend freezing any that won't be eaten within a couple days.  They are very good, the flavors are perfectly balanced with a crispy edge and chewy middle- and I think they would make amazing ice cream sandwiches! Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

These really are great       recipe says. If anything I would cut the flour down by like maybe a 1/4 cup next time, it was hard making a cookie with the last bit of dough. Give them a try you'll be glad you did!

An average cookie...tasty but not stellar.  The name is creative, though. =)

These cookies were not what I expected - they were way too cakey and not very flavorful.  I will not try them again.

Doesn't live up to the reviews. I made this recipe in the hopes of a soft, chewy center with crisp edges. No such luck. I read over 50 reviews before deciding to try the cookies. I followed the recipe exactly but made 36 cookies instead of 24. I use a temperature gauge for my oven so I know it was at 300 degrees exactly. I also use a timer and baked the cookies for the 17 mins. The cookies definitely have too much flour and vanilla for my liking. The vanilla totally overpowers the taste of the chocolate chips while the flour just made them more like biscuits. I was worried with the amount of sugar but it was fine. I won't be making these again as they are not to my taste but for those of you who like dryer cookies these are probably the ones you will want to try. I am going to stick to my old recipe but will continue to try new recipes as I love to bake and my roommates love to eat!!! lol lol

I don't see what the fuss is about this cookie.  Was excited to try it, but in the end they were less than average.  They didnt  have much flavor  to them. To much flour I guess.  Will  stick to my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe.

What is all the hype about. These were good, kind of big, overkill on vanilla,but in general just good. I probably will stick to my regular recipe for CC cookies. Still thank you for sharing and my grandchildren thank you too.

They are Great! I was surprised bcz the ingredients just seemed to be too far out of the norm, but they were very good. I did not roll them into balls, I just dropped them and used the times of a fork to flatten like you would with Peanut Butter cookies, and they came out just fine without all the rolling!

My experience with this recipe is this: I followed the recipe exactly except I cant have regular salt and only have unsalted butter so I had to adjust with sea salt to taste. A pinch or so is all I used. Other than that I followed the directions and ingredients as written. Knowing when there are done baking is tricky at 300 degrees as they do not get brown. You just have to have faith. I baked 15 minutes. They were fantastic. I am going to chill the dough and bake some and also bake some at 325 just to see if they get a little brown or the texture is different. But, prepared just exactly as is they are great. I should note that I did not have my electric mixer handy and used a potato masher to mix the dough and stirred the chips in with a spoon. They were neither caky nor crunchy, but the bottom had a toffee like crunch after cooled from all of the sugar used. I removed from the pan to cooling rack immediately.Even you do not think they are THE BEST, you will definitely like them. Also, the dough is somewhat dry, it helps to let the it set for awhile to let the flour absorb some moisture and then form the cookies with your hands.Edited August 2011: I now brown part of the butter and add a bit of molasses to my cookies.   Gives it a nice flavor.

Meh. Highly Meh.  After first batch, added extra chips and some nuts .... Still meh.  Came out bland and doughy, so I increased temp to 350oF and shortened time to 13 minutes ... better, but still blah.  It wasn't awful -- after all, still a cookie, and still has chocolate. But I won't make it again.

I just made these and they were sooooo good. I loved them! I had to leave them in the oven for like 10 minutes longer, because my oven is stupid... It doesn't work as well as it should. But either way, they were so good. Crispy on the edges and chewy in the inside. Definitely making these again!

These cookies were awesome! I followed the recipe with a couple of minor changes. I was a tad short on chocolate chips so I added some raisins along with them. I measured the dough out by large teaspoonfuls and rolled it into balls which I set on the baking sheet. I baked the cookies at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. They baked up golden on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect! Thanks for a great recipe.

I've seen this recipe floating around for a long time now and finally decided to try it ... SO GOOD!!!  I did alter it though... half butter, half butter-flavored shortening, 1 TB vanilla (instead of 4 ts), and a bag of peanut butter m&ms instead of chocolate chips =)  This is a GREAT recipe, good work Felix, and sassy title.  I did bake one tray an extra 6-8 minutes for a few crispier ones...

Pretty good recipe, I am glad I tried it. My only change was to use half shortening, half butter, as they stay good for longer and bake a little nicer. My only real issue is the vanilla- too much IMO.  This recipe makes beautiful cookies, but I still prefer Toll House's original recipe.

They live up to their name! This recipe fixes a lot of the problems I have with many recipes: too cakey, the chips don't really melt and just maintain their shape, don't spread. I made some with the suggested 3 tbsp/ cookie amount, but they were really huge, so I did the rest with 2 tbsp/ cookie. These were superb! Great flavor, relatively flat and chewy-- the way I like it. This one is a KEEPER!

I was really hoping that these would be fabulous, after seeing them recommended so many times.  BUT for me, they didn't hit the spot.  Maybe it's personal taste, but these are way too 'cakey' for me.  I like mine gooey, these were not.  Also the appearance wasn't that great compared to some other choco chip cookie recipes.

well.. Dont get me wrong, these are good cookies! it's just that i feel like there are better ones out there, you know? The look of them was very pretty, so if you want to impress with the shape and size of chocolate chips cookies, this is the recipe to use. The first batch I actually followed the instructions and flattened each cookie, but that made them spread way too much. They came out much better when I just rolled them into tiny balls and left them alone. That said, they also tasted pretty decent. I think I like the taste better of the BEST BIG FAT CHEWY cookies from this site better, but they don't come out looking as pretty. I think there was just a little bit much vanilla in the recipe for me. Next time I would half it.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for quite awhile and finally decided that today was the day to try it.  I was a bit skeptical at first...2 cups of brown sugar...but they turned out very well.  The dough (yes, I love cookie dough) is amazing!  I think that we ate at least 3-4 cookies just in dough.  I like the fact that you shape the dough and then flatten them onto the sheet.  They come out perfectly round and very pretty.  The cookies have been sitting now for a few hours and are still soft.  Overall, a great recipe that I will make again(even if it is just to eat the dough).

These are really good cookies! I used smart balance margarine in place of the butter and skipped the salt. They got quite large and taste delicious!

Yeah so I was skeptical too from the title but... these cookies are by far the best tasting chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  Just the right texture too.  I used a 1/4 cup measuring spoon for the dough and had to bake them a little longer because my oven runs cool.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar which gives the tops that "crinkly" bakery look.

very yummy. i make them with freshly ground whole wheat flour and honey sucanat. they are scrumptious. i pressed different things into each blob of dough on the sheet. for some, I pressed in raisins, or choc. chips, or pecans. very versatile cookie dough. the extra flour and the lower baking temp are key secrets I think. !!!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written, and I must agree, these are THE BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever eaten.  My daughter's 8th grade class agrees.  So does the soccer team I coach.  Definitely teenager-approved.   A couple of hints:  beat the butter and sugars extremely well, at least five minutes.  This is a key step to have the sugar well-incorporated before the rest of the ingredients are added.  When adding the flour, add very slowly, beating a little bit at a time.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks which complimented the size of the cookies nicely.  Try to use REAL ingredients like butter and real vanilla. Skip the generic chips and go for higher quality brand.   The quality of your vanilla will make a difference in the recipe between that's good to That's GREAT! When taking them out of the oven, the cookies don't look done.  Leave them to cool on the same baking sheet as the heat of the pan continues the cooking.  This is what keeps the cookie from being overdone and over-crisp.

I made these cookies today, and they are really good the only thing that I would change is the amount of salt that you put into the cookies.  Otherwise these are hands down good.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for these. I always make the Best Big Fat Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies and just wanted to try something else. Oops, my mistake! The batter was rather sugary but not bad, I then followed the directions and flattened my cookies before baking. They spread out a bit and looked fine. I pulled my cookies out at exactly 15 minutes and let them cool on the sheets. The warm cookies were 'meh' and the cooled cookies were just thin and crunchy, definitely NOT chewy. I'm going back to my old recipe...

These cookies were really nice. However, freshly baked and within the first day I found the cookies to taste like molasses- due to all the brown sugar, also due to the brown sugar available to me isn't all that great. After the cookies sat for a day they had a much better flavor. They are very beautiful cookies and stay very moist. Can't say that they are truly the best ever- Mrs. Field's fresh baked cookies still hold that title in my book, but they are definitely good quality.

These cookies are BIG!  I am making them for a tailgate party.  Remember girls, as the directions state, they are 3 tablespoons in size when you are placing them on your cookie sheet; which is a regular ice cream scoop.  There is no way that you can make more than 6 at a time if you are using a regular 18"x 13" inch cookie sheet.  If you are using a smaller sheet I would recommend not trying to make more than 4 at a time.  I guess you could make them smaller but I already have a regular chocolate chip cookie recipe.  The reason I am using this recipe is because I wanted to make HUGE cookies.  They are very good but they are an occasion cookie.  Something you would make for a bake sale, or a social event.  I wrapped each cookie individually in plastic.  I had to curb my urge to put coconut in them but next time I will.  I decided to try a recipe I didn't tweak for once. :-)

Hm. I wouldn't say these are the BEST cookies I've ever made, but they were pretty good. I made them into heaping tablespoons balls instead of 3 tablespoon balls, and cooked them for 14 minutes. Be careful NOT to overcook, otherwise they will turn from delicious chewy cookies to dry and crumbly ones.

This is a great cookie! Personally, I enjoy the vanilla/brown sugar taste and the texture is nice and chewy...not too sweet. I will make again. (Oh, only used 3 cups flour, but that was the only change.)

Like a lot of other people, I have to say this doesn't come close to living up to the title. They're an okay cookie, but the best? They're not even the best cookie I've made, let alone the best I've ever eaten.

Are these the best cookies I have ever had?  Will have to eat a few more of them before I make my mind up!!!  The only changes I made was to swap out the chocolate chips for Cranberries and White Chocolate chips.  I did think maybe there was a little too much flour in the recipe, It did made the dough a little crumbly to work with.

I'm not at all rating based on the name not living up to my expectations. These cookies just didn't cook for me. I followed the recipe exactly, but the center of the cookies didn't cook no matter now long I let them sit on the pan to set. And if I cooked them longer they just got brown...So needless to say I'm gonna stick to my regular chocolate chip recipe.

Instead of regular table salt, use the equivalent amount of kosher salt.  That little change takes chocolate chip cookies to a new level.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made in my own kitchen.  They are also SOME of the best cookies I have ever tasted!  However, if you don't have 3+ hours to devote to these than forget it.  THIS RECIPE TURNS OUT PERFECT IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER.  The only thing I did different was using 420 grams of flower instead of 440 (i use a scale when baking).  You MUST let the cookies cool for about 20 minutes on the sheet this finishes the baking process.  Also, for the people complaining of "cakey" cookies you used too much flour (hince why I use a scale).  If you use a tablespoon to help form the cookies and press them to almost exactly 1/4 inch these cookies are exactly like store bought!  Crispy and chewy and buttery!  I only got six to a cookie sheet too so be patient!

These are pretty good.  I rated them at a five because the recipe is outstanding.  However, i won't make them using three tablespoons of dough anymore because the cookies were too large and I had to adjust the cooking time.  This is classic chocolate chip cookie dough.  Thanks.

I have an electric oven too and needed to cook them 19-21 minutes depending on the size of the cookies. They are very good but taste more than sugar cookies with chocloate chips. The batter was drier than I'm used, afraid it wasn't going to work, but they turned out chewy and nicely formed.

This will be my "go to" cookie recipe.  Fabulous taste!  I took a suggestion from mysweetcreations and split the dough up used chocolate chips in half and m & m's in half, also by her suggestion I baked some up and rolled most of the dough into balls for freezing.  Just baked the frozen cookies and they came out great.  Such a great recipe and the convenience of freezing the dough into balls to pop in the oven s few at a time is perfect for us.

I was short on the recommended chocolate chips so I used what I had and added walnuts. I also had some cocoa-chili powder so I added 4 tsp of that too.   I do believe this is the best I've ever eaten - something about the texture make it +++

I love these cookies!  If you want soft and chewy - this is a great recipe.  I follow it exactly!  Just a big recommendation: don't overcook or they come out hard (we still enjoyed eating them hard haha), so they may not look done when you take them out, but let them sit 10min and they're perfect!

very good cookie! I'm giving it 4 stars because the dough was very hard to handle. I really like Best Big Fat Chewy Chocolate chip Cookies from this site. I'm bringing these to a House Church Service tomorrow, so we will see what everyone else thinks!!! Thanks for posting!

I was afraid of the high amount of flour and low temperature at first but went ahead and tried this recipe. I halved the recipe and used all whole wheat flour and milk chocolate chips.  I only had to cook them for about 10-12 minutes in my oven. Crispy edges and chewy moist center. Be careful not to over bake and spray your pans with non-stick cooking spray. I cooled my cookies on a cooling rack but couldn't wait 20 minutes to have them.  Delicious bakery sized cookies! Must try!

These cookies are the best! I did try different  baking times, until I got it right. In my oven it is about fourteen minutes.

I didn't want to try another chocolate chip cookie recipe because I was so happy with my other one.  But I decided to try these, and I've made them twice now.  The first time, I was impatient and didn't let the butter soften properly. They were very good (really chewy), but too hard the next day to eat.  I also only used about 3 cups of flour. I wanted to give these cookies a second chance, so today I made them again. I'm so glad I did! This time, I let the butter soften completely, (you don't want it to be cold in the middle), and creamed it with the sugars really well.  I was able to use all the flour, and the dough was soft yet pliable.  I baked them for about 17 minutes, and let them cool off on the baking sheet for only 5 minutes. They had chewy centers and crisp edges. They were perfect!  thank you so much for this recipe Felix K!

About the only "adjustment" I made was not cooling the cookies on the pan for the directed 20 minutes. The first pan I did that on were slightly hard to remove. But I also didn't make them as big. I got about  40 cookies out of the batch. They were hailed as delicious by my brother and his family-I am invited back to stay any time! lol

very good, but I don't know that I would say "the best...". They  were almost too sweet for me, but I did love that they were very doughy. I will make these again but will cut back on brown sugar. Thanks Felix!

These cookies are very good...just not the best I've ever had. I  found that they were a little too sweet for my liking. On the other hand, the vanilla flavor was fantastic and the texture was perfect. The next time I make this (yep I'll do it again) I'll  make the cookies smaller.

I'm not a raw cookie dough eater, but I had a hard time stopping myself from eating this dough so that I could have actual baked cookies to review! I had several bags of chips needing to be used up so I mixed white, semisweet & milk chocolate chips (about 1 1/2 cups total). Delicious!

wow! i never thought i would find a chocolate chip cookie recipe that would rival the one i have been using for years.  i may go so far as to say this may become my recipe of choice!  the only change i made was to increase the oven temp to 350 and i baked them for 15 minutes.  YUM!

I wouldn't say the flavour of these cookies is that much different than any of the other popular chocolate chip cookie recipes, but the texture was nice.  I added walnuts to my version and made them much smaller (about 1 Tb and they were the perfect size).  I cooked them for 14 minutes at 305 degrees.

This just seemed like too much work for a batch of cookies! It took a long time to bake them all because they are so big and I could only fit a few on my cookie sheet. I thought they had a strong vanilla taste, funny enough I think I preferred them the next day. They also remained quite pale even after baking for 20mins. These were big chewy cookies that were nice, but I won't bother making again.

This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe!  It is absolutely perfect just the way it is, and I am not sure I will even try another recipe in future.  Like the previous reviewer noted, they are beautiful and look like they took forever to make, when in actuality this is a simple way to wow everyone.  Felix K makes a bold claim, but in my opinion, to say that these are the best is absolutely true!

Very good cookie. I used dark chocolate chips & baked the cookies at 305 (was skeptical about the 300).  Turned out perfect!

so these cookies were pretty good but there's something weird about them i don't know. i guess when i eat cookies i don't want to feel gross afterwards and these cookies just definitely gave the gross i just ate a bunch of  feeling. they also don't keep very well and get hard by the next day.

This chocolate chip recipe really is the best in the site. The cookies had little burnt sugar rings around the sides, oh god i nearly lost it when i ate one. sooo good. I used mini reese's cups that I found at trader joe's as a substitute for chocolate chips. Best decision i've made in a long time. My cookies came out so perfect and the firefighters that i gave them away to loved them.

Great cookies, they were tasty and looked awesome. My only complaint was that they were a little too big, I'll try the recipe again making the cookies smaller. I baked 2 batches at the recommended time (17 mins), and baked 2 batched a little longer (about 19 mins), I didn't let them cool for long on the cookie sheets and I thought they were better than the cookies baked for the shorter time/longer cooling. They were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.

I LOVE this cookie recipe!  I love to bake, but cookies never seem to turn out right for me... they're usually flat and too crisp.  This recipe has turned out thick, chewy cookies for me everytime I bake them!  Thank you Felix for the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe!

Looking for a change today I gave these cookies a whirl.  They have much eye appeal, but are lacking in moisture/flavour content. Not a family favorite of ours.

Good but hard to find the size that baked up the best.  I made several huge, 2 to a cookie sheet and then I started making the cookies my normal size.  I use a small Pampered Chef scoop and I get the best sized chocolate chip cookies.

Yum! This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  The only other chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever used is the one on the back of the chip packages.  We really enjoyed these thin and chewy cookies.  I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of using a smaller scoop to make a smaller cookie.  I’m looking forward to making this recipe again.

I dont know what I did wrong, these tasted great but they stuck horribly to the cookie sheet. I even greased the pan. They also spread way to thin. But I have to say: what I did rip off the cookie sheet tasted great!

I think these are the best I have ever had. I was out of chocolate chips so I used Andes mint pieces. This will be my go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies from now on. We loved them!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and overall, I ended up with a very good cookie. They were a little too cake-like for me, though...I wouldn't quite characterize them as dry, but they were bordering on it.  I may try them again using a little less flour and see if that helps.  Good flavor, and my kids thought they were great. Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried many recipes, looking for that perfect chewy cookie like you can find at the bakery, and this is it! They came out perfect! I cut the recipe in half (I knew if they turned out good I would be tempted to eat way too many)and followed it exactly and they came out great! So Happy!!!

These are really one of a kind, that's for sure. Even coming out they was something different about them. Needless to say they were a hit, my dad describing like a sugar cookie, sweet with chocolate chips added to them an not dry. Then they dissapeared ;P I think I'll make this my regular, replacing Big Fat Chewy Cookies on this site. Right now I got them in the oven with Cookie Dough Cupcakes by lovestohost [[whose been doing a pretty sweet job pimpin' these out, by the way]]. :D THANKS so much

Ok Felix K.... I was skeptical when I read the title but after seeing the reviews and making them myself, they are FABULOUS! My kids absolutely loved them and I can't keep my hands off them! Followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.

Very good recipe, I usually made Award winning from this site but I like not using the pudding mix. I used whole wheat flour and they turned out great.  Used 1/8 cup measure and got 40 large cookies.

With a name like that, I SO wanted these to turn out. I baked 2 test cookies...following the directions exactly. They weren't done in the middle. I reduced the dough ball size to about 1 1/2 Tbsp. Pressed the dough down to about 1/2 an inch and baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes. Much better that way. My cookies were done all the way through and were thick and chewy. I was 1 cup short of enough brown sugar, so I put 1 Tbsp. molasses in 1 c. white sugar. I may make these again because my husband even gave me a 'thumbs up' on the ones that weren't done in the middle (or maybe he just didn't want to hurt my feelings).Edit time...Now that my cookies have been sitting in their container a couple days...I can't stay out of them! Gonna stick with the 3 stars though, since the recipe(as written) didn't come out 'done' enough.

With a title like that how could I not give them a try!  These are some pretty  darn good cookies and just might be my new favorite.  I followed the recipe as stated, but did use dark brown sugar  since I was out of light brown.  Baking temp and time was perfect and so were the cookies.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Felix!

I have used the same chocolate chip cookie recipe FOREVER.  I saw this and decided to try it.  I made a half batch of this and a half batch of the old.  The 'old' recipe isn't even done baking but the new is and I think I have a winner.  These cookies are sooooo good!  and they hold up really well.  Easy to take to work, school, etc to share w/others.  Don't break apart or stick to the baking sheet.  Wow!  I think I may be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks!!!  I'll have my husband and a few others do a side by side comparison to see which they like better but I have a feeling it will be this one!

Hubbard rates these a 5!  I'm relying on him because I'm on a sad diet that doesn't let me eat yummy cookies :(  all so I can squeeze myself into a brides-maid dress in October... there, I just had to get that out.  I feel better now.  These looked & smelled good though!  I had to bake them for 19 minutes to give them a little color and Hub says they're a little crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  MMMmmm my mouth is watering.  I always line the cookie sheets with parchment paper (mostly because I'm lazy and I absolutely HATE washing dishes) but it also makes the cookies nearly slip right off the pan!  Man I love that stuff!

I have tried several different recipes for chocolate chip cookies and these are by far the best. I made my cookies smaller - about 1 1/2 tbsp, but other than that I followed the directions exactly. I baked them at 300 degrees for 15 minutes and they were perfect - crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. They taste so good! This is the only recipe I'll use from now on. Thanks for a great recipe!

Next time I make these, I will reduce the baking powder to 3/4 t and the salt to a scant teaspoon.  These came out pretty and more cake like.  I baked exactly to specs and let them cool 20 minutes before removing.  No brown bottoms...the part I don't like about cc cookies.  If you use unsalted butter, then go ahead with the full teaspoon of salt.  Better than toll house

This recipe made 36 cookies using 2 tablespoons of batter per cookie.  While these were good, they are not my family's favorites.  I felt they were a little salty.

I agree they do not keep well and you can really taste the butter.  We make cookies about every week and will probably pass on this one.

I thought these cookies were fab! They aren't my favorite- my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe is the "Best, Big, Fat, Chewy" one, but these are a nice change. I found they are much better warm, and don't keep very well. I used to Nestle semi-sweet chocolate/white chocolate swirl chips.

Good cookies.  Absolutely the best?  I wouldn't know about that.  Everyone who had them loved them, but they just taste like basic chocolate chip cookies to me.  I think they are easy and good, and for that they get 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are good if you cook them right.  They are more cakey than others I've tried.  I made smaller cookies than the recipe instructed.  My dough was moist/crumbly and hard to work with like others said, so I must have done that part right.  At first I used both light and dark cookie sheets; the lighter spread the cookie out and it was too thin so I used dark cookie sheets for the rest of the batch.  I lightly sprayed cookie sheets with nonstick spray and used a paper towel to evenly coat the sheets with a thin layer of spray.  I shaped the dough into small balls and gently flattened the tops with the palm of my hand.  At first I made them too flat before putting them in the oven, so I only pushed down the dough a little for the rest of the batch.  My cookies took 14-15 minutes on dark cookie sheets at 300 degrees.  I removed the cookies from the oven when the undersides (not the edges) started to turn golden brown.  The recipe says to keep the cookies on the sheet for 20 mins but I only kept them on the cookie sheets for 1-2 mins before transferring to cooling racks.  Some people say that leaving your cookies on the sheet for too long causes them to "steam cook" and the moisture escapes.

WOW! I really love this recipe!! My new go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have made it twice in two days. Everyone raved over them. They are so easy and they just can't be beat for texture.  Crispy outside and chewy inside. Not sure how they store because they don't last long enough. I was a little worried when I first made them because they seemed a bit dry when mixing together but they are fabulous!!! Must try them if you have not yet. Thanks for submitting it!!!

Hubby LOVES these-he won't stay out of them! I didn't flatten them & glad I didn't because they do spread some & would've been way too thin for our liking. I don't think they're dry at all!

These are really good cookies. (I left out the baking powder.)  I find that the lower temperature helps keep the cookie from going flat. (still tasted fine) I experimented with a 325 degree oven for 12 minutes (Tablespoon size dough) and a 350 degree oven for 9 minutes. Next time I will have to follow the recipe and try the 300 degrees. The ones that were baked in the 325 oven had a better appearance.  For those that are baking until they are very visibly brown - cookies continue to bake (because of the hot sugars) while cooling on the pan.  I usually bake them until they are slightly golden on the edges if I want a  softer chewier cookie.  Thanks for the recipe Felix.

Not bad.  Even though I did not over bake the cookie they turned out a little hard, maybe just the day.  But overall not a bad tasting cookie.

I found a bag of chocolate chips in the back of my fridge and made these on a whim; I'll definitely make them again! As some other reviewers have said, these are probably the closest I've ever made to Subway chocolate chip cookies. My husband doesn't *eat* sweets, I had to bribe him into trying a bite, and he finished my cookie!

Felix (whoever he is) you are awesome! My favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe to make. They reminf me of Keebler soft-batch cookies--but better.  I do use egg-replacer instead of real egg and 100% dairy-free margerine instead of butter due to my children's egg and dairy allergies. They still come out yum!!

Terrific. I had a kitchen full of people oohing and aahing over these. This will be my new cookie recipe. Thanks so much.

I was worried these would be cake like, but I was NOT disspointed.  These were chewy and very yummy!  Don't over cook them.  My husband LOVED them...

These were wonderful! Those who wrote bad reviews must have done something wrong. My husband just told me that he can't stop eating them and they're "a keeper". I can't remember the last time he said that about a new recipe! I think this is my new chocolate chip recipe.

My family loved these. They said they reminded them of bakery cookies. I actually found the dough to be a little crumbly until I squeezed it into the ball (I also used large eggs). I'm sure I'll be making them again. Update: I made these again tonight and didn't have crumbly dough at all. I used margarine and adjusted the servings to 36. Either way, they still get 5 stars. My oldest son proclaimed these the "best he's ever eaten". That was before I told him the name. Thanks, Felix!

I was really disappointed.  I MUST have done something wrong, but for the life of me can't figure out what.  I measured everything EXACTLY.  They came out very flat, not like the picture. I really loved the flavor and would like to make them again, but am cautious to do so.  I used large eggs. I'm taking them to church tomorrow, and was disappointed, but my husband said they'd eat anything.  True.

Good cookies, but it definitely depends on the pan you use as to the time needed to bake. Lighter pans need higher temp and longer cooking time and dark pans work with time and temp suggested.

ok, first off let me say i'm amazed!!!!! this recipe is EXACTLY what i have been looking for....my first batch just came out of the oven and they look perfect!!!! the bottoms are not at all burnt (i hate burnt bottoms on anything)and they smell fantastic! i put them in for exactly 15 minutes, and thats all they needed, the size is just right for what i was looking for, and only putting 8 on the pan at a time was a good idea, so that they dont touch. all in all, a great recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

Beautifully, perfect, HUGE cookies!  The only thing I did different was I lowered the amount of butter to 200g instead of 225g ( 1 cup minus 2 tblsp) because some of the reviews said they were too greasy.  These didn't look greasy at all to me.  They look perfect...though I haven't tried them yet (I did taste the dough though and that was yummy!).  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy.  I used my Pampered Chef 40 cookie scoop and baked for 14 minutes at 300 degrees.  Turned out perfect.  I think this is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes on the site and I have tried tons of them.  Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I will admit these are pretty darn good! Dense, thick, chewy and crispy. I little difficult to work with, probably due to the extra flour. 3 Cups is more than usual. None of this is a complaint. I will make them again, but also continue on playing with new recipes too. Thanks.

Most Definitely the BEST Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever made. - My only tip is , Don't cook them to long...if you want them to stay soft after they cool don't quit cook them until the edges are golden :)

When I saw the name for this recipe I thought to myself, "I HAVE to try these." And I'm so glad I did! They're not the chewiest cookies out there, but that doesn't even matter (and I'm a die-hard chewy cookie fan) as they're perfect slightly crunchy. The flavor hits you like a subway and they're BIG. Which I always like. :) I followed the recipe to a T and I'm bringing them to my church tomorrow, so we'll see if it's just me who thinks that these are DELICIOUS!

I only made a half batch of these and still got about 24 cookies. I'm glad I made a half batch, though, because I didn't think they were that great...I liked the texture a lot, but the flavor didn't do a lot for me. Too vanilla-y, for one. Think I'll stick to my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe!

Very good, thank you for the recipe. I have tried many different cookie recipes, and this is by far my favorite. I usually always pay careful attention to the directions and noticed you did not mention where to put the white sugar (although i'm sure you mix it with the flour and brown sugar). Anyway, great recipe! My husband and I enjoyed it very much :)

this is my all time favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, everyone who tries them loves them. One change, if you want a crispy outside, but tender inside, increase the tempeture to 320°, still bake for 20 mins.

This is my go-to cookie recipe for cc cookies of course, but I also use this base recipe for other cookies.  I’ve made all kinds of substitutions according to what ingredients I’ve had on hand at the time and every variation has been great!  Depending on the butter/sugar/flour type I’ve used, sometimes it takes a little less flour, sometimes the full amount.  It’s pretty foolproof.  Really love it!

AWESOME cookie. I tried the recipe as-is and loved it (got rave reviews from the family), but I had to adjust the baking time. 17 minutes was too long in my convection oven and the edges were a little hard. Start checking at 13 minutes or so. You will still get a beautiful golden cookie because of the sugar!

I chose to sort of roll the dough in the chocolate chips and it made for a beautiful, bakery-perfect looking cookie.

The next time I make this recipe, I may experiment by adding  corn starch to see if it makes them overall a little softer.

You are absolutely right I can’t even tell you that these are not the best chocolate chip cookies I have made in a long time and I am in a constant search for the best chocolate chip cookie! Thank you for sharing! I followed the instructions without modifying anything and they turned out like the picture! Very pleased and I know my family will be!

I decided to update my view. They do look beautiful, they taste good (nice vanilla and brown sugar levels) but they are a bit greasy.  If I make again I’ll try less butter.

These were really good, as in perfect! My 12yo son would not stop raving about them - he said they were much better than Subway cookies which he loves! I am in Sweden where we use celcius. I would actually recommend raising the temp a little to 175c. And 15 minutes is perfect. Can't recommend these enough!

I didn't read the reviews before making this.. I am glad I didn't these were awesome! I changed nothing and cooked the for 17 minutes. I thought at first they might not be cooked all the way. Oh these were perfectly chewy!! Great Great Recipe!

Welcome home from vacation! I decided not to make one, but two recipes for the boys to try. Definitely, was surprised when we loved this one, even more than the Nestle Toll House we have always loved through the years! What fun to put them to the taste test! Simple goodness, would make them all over again! Only change, I would buy a better chocolate chip!

Well I was the dumb person to jump into this head first, doubling the recipe, having no idea how they would turn out! Thank goodness these bad boys were some of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever made! 
And yes I even baked them at 300! (a first for me!) 
My only suggestion would be to make them slightly smaller. Because these are some massive cookies were talking about here! I've got younger siblings and large quantities of sugar can cause negative aftermath! Lol
Very satisfied overall though!

These were pretty good but not my favorite. The dough difficult to work with and in the end was not amazing. Overall good but not as good as I was expecting.

These were delicious and stayed soft for several days.  Although they were gone by day 3!  I did make a few changes, and I'm only putting them here because Allrecipes has removed the ability to put your own notes on recipes. However, that being said, it is a healthier cookie.  I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. I used 1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 cup of oatmeal flour (that I made myself), 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I also added about a 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  I refrigerated the dough overnight, then I baked them at 320 convection for 12 mins.  They were perfect. 12 mins was flattening the dough slightly 1 additional minute if you leave it as a ball.

I keep everything else the same with this recipe except the flour. I start with two cups then start adding more and more flour until it  looks good.  Best cookies ever! Make sure you put them into a container when they're done cooling from the oven or they'll get crunchy!

I always found the cookies from my normal recipe to be quite flat and hard, so I decided to try a new recipe. I found this recipe, so I decided to give it a try. I followed the recipe exactly (except for I made the cookies slightly smaller) and for me, these cookies lived up to their name. Easily the best cookies I have ever made, and my family agreed as well. I was a bit weary at first because the dough was very firm and quite dry, but they turned out amazing. Perfectly soft and chewy, and looked great too. I highly reccomend this recipe to any cookie lover!

This was the best instructions I've seen so far for how to get big, flat showy chocolate chip cookies. The taste was fine. Didn't change my life, but it's pretty hard to do that with chocolate chip cookies, since I've tried a lot of them, all delicious.

Behold, the best chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER! =) I usually can't stand day old chocolate chip cookies, however these cookies day old are still super  yummy! Don't change a thing and be sure not to overbake. I've made these twice in the last month they're so good! =)

I looove this cookie recipe, and I was super hesitant to try something new. They keep a great shape but stay super chewy! There wasn't enough chocolate in them for my taste; but, that's more my mistake than the recipe's.

Turned out very good. I will make it again. I altered the size and made  1/4 of the size mentioned in the recipe.

I made these once before and they were a little to dry, however I followed another's suggestion and used 1/2 cup less flour.  It did the trick (for my taste buds Anyway). :-)

These are the best chewy chocolate chip cookies I've ever made.  I used margarine instead of butter and extra large eggs because that's what I had and followed the rest of the recipe and bake time.  They turned out great and stayed soft and chewy.   I will definitely make them again but smaller and reduce the baking time.  Thank you for sharing.

My only complaint is that the recipe made them too big so I halved it and perfect :)

I have to agree with Steve. They weren't even close to being done at the allocated time.  I also let them bake until the edges were light brown. I ended up with hard, dry cookies., that were slightly chewy in the middle.

These cookies are amazing! My husband loved them and is so excited to know I can make these. I followed the recipe exactly except for two changes, I cooked them at 350 degrees instead of 300. And I used dairy free ingredients. They had the perfect balance of crunch and chewiness. Thanks for sharing your recipe! I will be making these from now on.

These cookies were tasty and gigantic, but other reviewers were correct that they are a little greasy and the batter is a little dry. I would try making them again, making 48 cookies instead of 24, and doing something to make the batter a little more moist and less greasy. UPDATE: After letting the cookies sit overnight, I found that the next day they truly were the most delicious cookies ever, and I wouldn't change a thing!

This is my go-to chocolate  chip cookie recipe. Full disclosure: I am NOT a baker. Therefore, when I attempt to bake something,  I follow the recipes to the letter. I don't  add "something  extra" or my "special touch." Wait, I did add an additional pinch of salt since I used unsalted butter. After successfully making this recipe several times, I can honestly  say this recipe is reliable and tasty! I am puzzled  as to why some reviewers had disastrous results. These  cookies are always chewy and delicious,  even DAYS later when stored in zip top bags.

Amazing recipe, unlike other recipes with butter, these did not flatten out. They stayed huge and chewy and the vanilla taste is outrageous!!! Saved to my computer, I  love this recipe!!!!

Reeaally good! I did adjust the temp and the length of cook time to what I knew would be the best. My mother said they tasted just like what her grandmother's tasted like! 

It's a keeper with the modifications. Makes a good amount as well.

Yummo Felix!! Followed your recipe almost exact. The only change I made was 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. These cookies came out of the oven beautifully. The title of this recipe is why I chose it. It will be my go to for the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted because I can't say it isn't!

As others have reviewed, they taste like Subway cookies. They spread out quite a bit and look amazing, but taste dry and stale out of the oven. I have no idea how that's possible!

They had to bake longer than time called for. I personally think there's too much sugar and vanilla so I'll try again with less. Otherwise they were big and chewy, huge hit with the kids.

These are delicious. Followed the recipe to a T. Made about two dozen huge delicious cookies. Even better the next day.   My kids are asking for these, much to my husband's chagrin, as he prides himself on making he world's best chocolate chip cookies.

We did a taste taste of over 30 cookie recipes, all made exactly as the directions state.  We compiled recipes from all over the place, from internet sites to family secrets.  This was a multi night event with multiple taste testers.  This cookie recipe was in the final three.  Make it just like it says and you will see why.

Love this cookie! I made a few adjustments- I replaced 1/2 cup flour w/ 1/2 cup ground oatmeal (gave it a nice texture). I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. I cut down the vanilla to 1 tablespoon and cut the white sugar down to 4 tablespoons (they were still a smidge sweet for me). I also added extra chips (you can never have enough in my opinion). I baked these at 325* for 14 minutes and they baked PERFECTLY - cooling on the pan for 1 minute then on a rack for 10 minutes. Wonderfully chewy with slightly crisp outsides... Pretty close to perfect!

I had this recipe from the back of my flour bag...the cookies looked great but tasted like nothing...except for the chocolate chips. THESE COOKIES taste great all over and are exceptionally delicious!!! The cookies don't look done at all at the 17 minute mark....but, they are. Take them out against your better judgment and you will have wonderfully chewy cookies instead of really hard ones.

I've made these a few times now, per directions, and they are PERFECT. Love the giant cookies they make! This has become a go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe for me; it's either these or the good old Toll House recipe. Tonight I substituted chopped up Belgian truffles for the chocolate chips (approx 13 oz, by weight) and that took it over the top- you guys, these are officially the best cookies in all of ever.

OMG I have found my new chocolate chip recipe. I have made them twice now and they come out perfect. I use a 1/4 cup sylicone measure to scoop them and it makes exactly 24 cookies. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever tried.  This is so much better than some of the more popular/highest rated cookie recipes on this website (I should know...I've tried most of them!).  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazinggg!  They have the same consistency/texture as the cookies from Subway (Otis Spunkmeyer brand) which is exactly what I've been searching for.  This recipe definitely lives up to its name!

Everyone has a different preference in cookie texture. Mine is gooey, chewy and sweet. This recipe made more of a dry, light, fluffy cookie with a crunchy outer layer. Very unique cookie!

These are awesome! They are very easy to make and taste great! I've been using this recipe for 3 or 4 years now and everyone who tries them loves them! Similar to a "Tollhouse" recipe.

These were THE BEST cookies I have EVER had in my entire life. Now whenever I make chocolate chip cookies, I will use this recipe. I have had slice and bake and frozen, heat up in the oven cookies, but nothing beats homemade cookies from scratch. Thank you so much for impressing my family with my newly found baking skills. I am going to make these cookies for the rest of my life! I couldn't believe that I found something better than the slice and bake but these cookies really won the prize. THANK YOU!

This is the best. I don't care what anyone says. These are easy and big and totally wonderful. I have made thm twice now and just altered the recipe a touch to make chocolate cookies with white chips. In case you're wondering the alt was 1/2 cup white sugar instead f the 6 TBL spoons and 1/2 cup of baker's cocoa. I'm going to try it again ad make peanut butter cookies substituting 1/2 cup PB for 1/2 cup of the butter. Can't wait and Thank you so much for posting this amazing recipe!!

Very good chewy Cookie, however they are just a tad too sweet. I made a second batch with a little less brown sugar and they were perfect. Thanks a mil for the recipe. Definitely one to add to my database!

Best chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER! Everyone loves this cookie. I go by recipe when mixing, however I do scoop them smaller, using a #40 cookie scoop, and adjust baking temp & time to 350 for 12 minutes (my oven). I no longer search for a better chocolate chip cookie. Thank you Felix K!

Excellent cookie.  Different consistency than Toll House.  Thicker.  A big hit with the grandchildren.  Followed it as written except made them a bit smaller, about 3 dozen.

Just finished making these cookies.  Yes the batter was stiff from the high flour content but they baked up just fine at 300 degrees. I waited for the edges to brown slightly and they stayed chewy inside.  They are very sweet with almost no other flavor beside the chocolate chips. Too sweet for me but I bet kids'll love these big chewy cookies.

Even though I own and operate a popular restaurant, I've always said "I can't bake to save my own life".  So of course I was intrigued by this recipe.  I was nervous about the low baking temp of 300.  I did one test cookie....it was a bit less chewy than I wanted.  I added a touch more butter ( 1/8 cup)and increased the temp to 325. Crispy edges & a chewylicious center. I am so proud of myself.  These are really the best I've ever tasted (and baked!)  PS-sprinkle with a touch of coarse sea salt!  Amazing!

These cookies are really good, but the dough is really crumbly so difficult to work with - chocolate chips falling out and when trying to squish them, they'd crumble and crack. I had to bake them in 3 batches - each batch had different sized cookies. My husband hasn't tried them yet (he's not yet home from work), so we'll see what he says. I will probably make them again, and make them the smaller size. I couldn't squish them down to 1/4 inch height, so they weren't golden brown and crispy on the edges.

One afternoon while feeling pretty adventurous, I thought I would compare this cookie recipe to another cookie recipe (called Best Chocolate Chip Cookies, submitted by Dora, also on this site).  I am an experienced baker and followed the directions as they were written (didn't change them based on any comments, so that I could compare one original recipe to the other).  I found that these Felix K cookies were dry and floury.  They definitely resemble what you get at a bakery.  Some people like that kind of cookie, and if you do like that big floury flat cookie, then this is the recipe for you.  I was looking for a cookie where the base of the cookie is buttery with a hint of salt, balanced by some delicious chocolate chips.  I also wanted a more tender cookie.  I found that the other recipe that I mentioned above (Best Chocolate Chip Cookies submitted by Dora) fit that bill to a "t"!  So, from now on, I am going to make that one.  My sister however, liked Felix K's better, so, like I said, it depends what you are looking for.  Happy baking!

There's too much flour. I followed the recipe and they turned out like hockey pucks. After they cooled they've been good dipped in milk to help soften them up. If I made these again I'd really, really flatten them and see if that helped... but I probably won't make them again.

I just don't think these are the best I have ever eaten. They were missing something, and I think they needed to be a little softer.

Yep, PERFECT! I'm currently serving a church mission in Russia where some ingredients are not available for many American foods, and my cooking/baking equipment is a lot different. I can find everything in this cookie recipe in Russia, and I made no alterations for ingredients or time in the oven. I'm entertaining a lot, and this is one treat everyone loves, be they Russian, German, or American!

I don't know about it being the best... maybe I ought to have baked them at 350F for 15mins or so instead of 25mins at 300F?  My even tends to be a bit cooler, most things take longer to bake than usual. They were chewy, but could've been chewier. But I had no problems with greasiness, and even replaced some of the flour with whole wheat flour. I liked it- I'll try again, this time baking it at 350F for a shorter amount of time. And I ended up with more cookies than the recipe stated- my cookies had about a 3" diameter. Everyone else must be making big bakery size cookies!

Great! I was shocked about the amount of brown sugar, but hey, it's a cookie. I did fill the cups of flour a bit skanty on purpose because it did seem like a lot.

This is the first review I'm writing, as I absolutely LOVE these cookies - best I've baked! - but there are some parts of the recipe that I've found need to be adjusted.

16 ounces, even 12 ounces, of chocolate chips is too much. I find myself using about eight ounces with great success. Any more than that and, even with cookies that are filled to the brim with chips, and I still have a ton left in the bottom of the bowl. While these make a great snack while the cookies are baking, it isn't necessary to waste them! Just use half.

The baking time as stated has never worked for my in any of the three ovens in three different states that I've made these in. I've had much more success with the oven at 325 for about 18 minutes.

Hope this helps someone make the best chocolate chip cookies ever!

These are great, but don't keep very well, so unless you have a lot of mouths to feed, consider cutting the recipe in half.

I just made these cookies as a possible candidate for my Memorial Day BBQ. Hands down, these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever. I even used some of the dough to make white chocolate macadamia (spelling?) nut cookies, delish!

ok, i was a little leery about trying this recipe, too, simply because of the name. THESE ARE DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!! I previously stated another chocolate chip cookie on this site was the best...I LIED. These come out soft and chewy. I did alter one little, itty, bitty thing: I used a mini scooper to size them, instead of 3 tbsp for one cookie. This was due only to personal preference. I cooked them at the 300 degrees as stated, and yes, that is VERY scary, but it works!! I WILL MAKE THESE COOKIES FOR EVERY BAKE SALE, COOKIE EXCHANGE OR FOR NO REASON AT ALL. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!

I have an electric oven which can be tough to bake with. The cookies came out a little overdone and I was sad until I tried one. Still delicious! Crispy outside and soft chewy center! This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

These are a good cookie. As some one said in another review they would be great w/vanilla ice cream. As for me and my hubby they were just to large and not for us. Will go back to my regular recipe.

DEEEELicious! these cookies are amazing and so easy to make - the only thing I did differently was mix it all with a fork since I don't have a mixer right now, but it turned out perfectly. I love these and I'll definitely make them again! Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I didn't want such a big cookie so I only used 2 tablespoona of dough per cookie. That gave me 36 nice size cookies. I also baked mine @ 350 for 14 minutes. Make sure you let them cool the whole 20 minutes on the sheet.

These were great. My only thought is that they taste a little too brown-sugary.  Next time I might replace a little with just white sugar. I love the chewiness but I didn't want to only taste brown sugar.

I think this is a good starter recipe. The key here is lots of butter, lots of sugar and salt. Always yummy. But to get the right consistency, add a little less baking powder. I also notice that if you melt the better halfway before you mix the sugar mixture together your cookie comes out more crispy and less doughy and hocky puck like (as some of the reviewers here who rated this recipe down mentioned)  This is the recipe I always take out when I want choc. chip cookies. And I apply the changes I mentioned above.

At the end of this debacle the cookies tasted alright. Not the best I've ever eaten .. not even close .. but alright.  It also calls for WAYYYY too much flour. I had to add two more eggs and another half cup of brown sugar just to get the dang thing to mix. I think it try to burn out my beaters.  No. I'll never make this version again. The recipe on the back of the chocolate chips is better. (And I think if you're going to use a picture you should take a picture of the cookies that came from the recipe - as mine looked like mountainous craters).   I also agree the temp was too low and it screwed up the cooking time. I like soft cookies but they were just too much.

I have to start by saying these are just ok for me and my family. I made the recipe just as stated. I put nine cookies on a pan and cooked them 17 min then let them cool for 20 on the pan when i went to take them off they were stuck to the pan and not done in the middle. So the second batch i made the cookies smaller and that seems to help. I have had better cookies and for kids the size of the cookie is to large. I will not make these again will stick to the recipe on the chocolate chips. Thanks anyway.

These were just OK. They were extremely brown sugar-y and a bit greasy. They tasted more "commercial" (or store-bought) than I prefer. They were chewy, but they fall apart really easily when you try to eat them. They were decent. I guess. Even for their type of cookie (the chewy, larger kind) they weren't very good. I'm sorry. They're not exactly sub-par, I suppose. Just... par.

These cookies were good. I followed the recipe exactly, but regret adding the salt. All I could taste was the salt in the batter and after the cookies were done. I don't usually add salt to cookies like these. Overall I think that they were good,but not the best I have ever had.

I followed the recipe exactly, and am a pretty good baker usually. I was worried that so many people say their dough is very stiff; mine wasn't. I used the 3 1/2 cups flour specified, and did not overmix, so I'm not sure why my results would be different. Out of the oven, these are amazing. Soft and yummy and just perfect. They did take me closer to 20 minutes to finish baking, but other than that they're exactly what they should be. Perfect five stars.

For us, this was a wonderful cookie.  I didn't change anything. I even froze some of the dough and used it in the cookie dough cupcakes from this site that I previously reviewed, for a going away party, recently, and it made a great cupcake, perfect.

Eh... I didn't think these were any better than my usual recipe!  In fact, they were crispier.  I don't really like a crispy cookie, and I did follow the recipe exactly.  Sorry Felix :)

This is a great recipe. I was very curious about the 300 degree temp, but it works!  I like a thinner chewier cookie, but overall they were good.

My family give this recipe 2 thumbs up! I used 1 stick margarine and 1/2 c. shortening. It only needed 1/2 bag of semi sweet chocolate chips. This recipe is the one to use!

Fantastic recipe.  I substituted 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup butter flavoring shortening for the butter.  They turned out soft and delicious.  I followed the directions and made the 3 Tbsp. dough balls.  They made a LARGE cookie.  It was fun for the kids to eat, but next time I will probably make the balls smaller for regular sized cookies.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making these again-soon.

I was very skeptical about this recipe with so much flour, brown sugar, and vanilla.  I've been making the same chocolate chip cookie recipe for more than 10 years.  However, I took a chance.  I am so glad that I did!  This were delicious!  My hubby said that these are the best he has had.  I will say that for me it made 45 cookies for me.  They were what I would call a standard cookie size.  I can't even imagine how big the cookies would be if I only made 24.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

So i dont know...i didnt like them and my husband didnt either. I was quite dissappointed after reading previous reviews and the title of the recipe. oh well...off to find a new recipe to try

Very good! I saved some of the dough in a plastic bag, and kept it cold. I really enjoyed having fresh cookies all week! They were chewy, soft, and wonderful while hot, or cold!

These were very good!  I made the first batch a little smaller then called for and tried one before starting the second batch and I'm glad I did.  I made the second batch bigger and they were so much better.  The whole group commented about the chewy center and thought they were delicious.  I would still pick my sister-in-laws over these but it is hard to compare :)

I've made this recipe multiple times. These cookies are absolutely fantastic. I think I make mine just a little bit small than the recipe says to and they are always the perfect size and the perfect amount cooked.

I tend to believe that I am the chocolate chip cookie queen, but I have to give it to Felix, these are the best ever!  They do taste just like the ones from Subway, and I followed the recipe exactly as given.  My husband baked the last batch for me, but baked them too long - still great, just crunchy all the way through.  Kudos to you Felix, fantastic

Felix, these truly are the best choc. chip cookies I've had. I've been making them for a year now and think that the 300 degree oven, longer baking time is what does the trick. A winner!

I can't even believe that these cookies came out of my own oven. They really are the best I have ever made! I stayed 100% true to the recipe. I live in Northern Az. at a high elevation and they still came out PERFECT. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Wow!  These are the best chocolate chip cookies EVER!  They stayed nice and soft, chewy and plump!  The only think I did different was I cooked them at 350 for 13 minutes and didn't flatten them out before cooking.  They were perfect and are now going to be my go-to chocolate chip cookie!

these were the 1st cookies i've ever made. Maybe my lack of experience inhibited me to make them as excellent as the title promised. They were goood, but far from great. Thanks. Maybe will give them another try at some point.... Substituted chocolate chips with cranberries, silced almonds, and peanut butter chips

Made these following the recipe exactly and they were really good. The last batch I made, however, was amazing. Used half butter and half margarine which I think gave me a thicker cookie. Also added a spoonful of peanut butter and did half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips. They were sooo good!

I made these exactly as the recipe states and they were good, but (sorry Felix!) I've definitely had better. Too much flour for my taste, so if I do make these again I'd definitely cut back on it.  Everyone likes they're CC cookies a little different...these just weren't my personal preference.

These cookies turned out great!  I will be making them for christmas for everyone next year :)  I might try to cut some of the butter and add applesauce instead just to try and cut some of the fat.  But as the directions are, these are AMAZING!  And great for ice cream sandwiches!

Wow! The only problem with this recipe is that it's hard to get any of the cookie dough into the oven before I eat it all! Perfect-o. I've found that my standard 9 min. at 350* works great. Love these cookies!

These are just about perfect. Best if you let them cool a bit first so that they solidify. Don't be afraid to add a bag of peanut butter chips to the mix, no need to decrease the chocolate chips if you do.

These cookies are beautiful to look at, and the dough tasted great, however the finished product was way too sweet for my family

This cookies are absolutely amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly, and I must admit I was a bit leary. But I gave it a go anyway! I have had issues with my cookies being too flat and crispy in the past, but not these!! They are full and chewy and really taste and look gourmet! Wow! Okay I have to get them out of my house so I stop eating them. ahahh

Just made these and I think Felix has a winner.  I have been using another cc cookie recipe for years.  I felt the need to try something new.  Warm they are very chewy inside with a crisp crust.  Very pale, and cooked for 23 minutes and was worried they might be getting dry.  I think another 2-3 mins would be perfect for those who prefer a darker, crisper cookie.  I also doubled this recipe and as previous reviewers said, add the flour slowly towards the end.  I think I ended up with about 6 2/3 cup of flour (doubled).  Kids are lovin' em, they were worth breaking my new years resolution for (at least for a minute!).  Thanks for sharing!

The name says it all, someone said if you didn't have 3= hours to forget it:O WHAT, they only took me like 30 mins before my first batch was done!  I already had a recipe that we called the best choc. chip cookies ever but these were the best!  I love them and they look awesome too! I already have the recipe written out and in my card file:)   Oh and I followed the recipe exactly too!

These cookies live up to their title! I was looking for a recipe that would produce soft gooey cookies that would stay that way for more than an hour. I made a batch and got about 4 dozen cookies, they lasted almost a week in our house and were still just as gooey as the day I baked them. This is a great recipe!

Well, I made these exactly as written. I did not find the dough as dry as I was expecting based on others reviews. I used milk choc chips, and baked for approx 17 min. They were "ok". Hubby tried one, said it tasted like a choc chip cookie (go figure), he also said he thought the choc chips were weird..I wasn't done baking, so I added some mini semi sweet choc chips that I had to the rest of the batch. I also thought that, while the other cookies seemed cooked enough, they were just a little too soft, so I cooked the last round (also, the only round w/semi sweet) for approx 19 min. WOW, What a difference. The texture was perfect, and semi-sweet choc chips are the way to go. I would have given this a 4, and continued my search for the best choc chip cookie, but I think I may have found my keeper. I'll try again w/o the milk choc chips next time before I confirm.

I love the title of the cookie and it makes it more tempting with the hint of a challenge.  :)  These are very good cookies when they are warm, but when the cool they taste like store bought "soft" cookies.  They would be good used for cookie sundaes and I may try them as such sometime.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  My husband wanted soft chocolate chip cookies and these are just that.  The 6 T. of sugar was odd, as was the oven temp and baking time but followed the recipe exactly and the results were perfect!  Yummy!  My husband said, "don't lose this recipe."

These cookies were great!  Just what my husband was looking for:)  I have to admit I was afraid of the oven temp with the amount of sugar but let me tell you these turned out perfectly... slight crunch on the outside, soft and pillowy inside. I followed the recipe exactly except for pushing them down.  I had to bake mine a few mins longer than what was suggested.  That is better than over cooking, just keep an eye on them. I WILL make these again!  thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe as is but cut in half. The cookies turned out super good. ONE of the best Ive had. Definitely not too cakey (which I was worried about). Nice and crispy on the outside and chewy goodness on the inside!

These were easily the best cookies I have made because I am notorious for messing up even the premade cookies.  The dough was pretty tough to mix and almost overheated my hand mixer but the end result was delicious chewy cookies.  I used only 3 cups of flour and 2 tsp of vanilla.  I also made them a bit smaller so they only needed 12-13 minutes.  This will be my chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I have made many different cookie recipies over the years and am very happy, and yes, surprised that the kids and their friends loved them. Great dough to work with I did cut the flour by about 1/3 cup and they were wonderful!

A pleasant surprise because the dough was very dry and crumbly.  Came out so soft and chewy, and HUGE!!!  I used a little less chocolate chips and threw in some walnuts.  Definitely a great recipe.

This was a great recipe! Pro's: Bottoms didn't ever get dark, soft w/o tasting underbaked, keep well & don't lose their softness. Con's: Has a tiny it different taste form other cookies in my opinion very vague but I can taste it BUT I did 1/2 the vanilla-don't like it too sweet, dry batter but that's how I know they'll be good-lol I just added a Tbs water & it was fine.  I will make these again for sure. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are pretty close to being the "best". I felt like they were too sweet. The first batch I mad according to directions, and didn't like the "underbaked" taste of the huge cookies. Though I LOVE soft cookies. The second batch I made just regular sized (maybe a couple of tablespoons each) cookies, and decreased the baking time. I took them out just as the edges were getting brown and they were still soft! I love a soft cookie, but I don't like a soft cookie that tastes or seems "undone". I will definately use this recipe again making the smaller cookies.

I tried this simply because of the title. I can't say that this was the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever had, but it is sure up there. These cookies did puff up rather than flatten out, so I flattened my dough balls before baking. I also baked these at 350 for 10 minutes, and that was the perfect amount of time and temperature. I will probably make these again, but isntead subbing applesauce or plain yogurt for the butter next time to cut out some of the fat.

Definitely my favourite chewy chocolate chip recipe - so far at least.  Best one i've tried on All-Recipes anyway.   I would give it more than 4 stars but, imo, a couple things need tweaking.  The dough is great and, if you soften the butter long enough, doesn't seem too dry.  However, I prefer my cookies much smaller....I usually get about 6 dozen out of this batch instead of the suggested 2.   ALSO - even my smaller cookies take 17-19mins at 300degrees.  I can't imagine the large ones getting done in 15....however, perhaps it is an altitude issues.    Anyway, those gripes aside, LOVE this recipe and everyone I have fed them to has raved about them.  That's enough for me! :)

This recipe was delicious!  I thought it would be hard to beat my mom's recipe but this one came in at a very close 2nd and everyone in our house loved them!  I did only use a total of 3/4 cup butter and I took an earlier suggestion and used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter.

These were really easy to bake and are a visually very pretty cookie.  I felt there was too much of a flour/dry ingredient taste for my own liking.  I did however get a lot of compliments on these! Thanks!

These are definitely the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made and if not the best I have ever eaten, then pretty darn close!  I made absolutely no changes to the recipe except cutting it in half.  Use high quality chips!  My cookies came out crunchy on the outside and chewy inside just like I like them!  Will be making again I'm sure!

Very good indeed! I used an ice cream scoop so the balls of dough would all be the same - I actually did measure to make sure that one scoop was three tablespoons.  Mine had to bake more like 20 minutes before they got any real color, and I think next time I'll up the temp a bit.  Good crisp-chewy texture and flavor, although my personal preference in a chocolate chip cookie is all or half shortening instead of butter - these were very "buttery" to me. (Not that that's a bad thing...)

These were EXTREMELY good chocolate chip cookies! The best I've ever baked. I didn't use an electric mixer, and it still turn out fine! I added 1 & 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, and it was a bit much. I will try adding 1 &1/4 cups next time.

Whoa!  Yuuuumy!  What a beautiful cookie!  I replaced 1C all purpose with whole wheat, and they still turned out beautiful.  I also made mine smaller and they turned out great!  Thanks for a great cookie recipe!

not bad. not as good as i'd thought, but still pretty good nonetheless. 'specially if youve got kids that like to eat 4 cookies at once. this is good for telling them they may only have ONE cookie. these would be good for some kind of soft serve ice cream dessert.

I have looked this recipe over several times and I finally decided to try it.  I have been modifying all of the choc. chip recipes so that my diabetic husband can eat them and until now couldn't find one he REALLY liked.  This worked perfectly and will be my new go to recipe.  I changed quite a bit but it all worked.  One stick of margarine, and a bit less than a 1/2 cup of canola oil, for the flour I used 2.5 C a/p flour and 1 C of oats (oats ground up in food processor to equal one cup after grinding), one real egg and 1/4 cup egg substitute, 3/4 C splenda brown sugar blend and 1/4 C + 3 T of the white splenda blend, 2 t. vanilla all else the same.  I did add toasted walnuts as well.  Baked as directed with a smaller portion I use a medium cookie scoop bake on parchement paper.  Perfection!  They are correct in saying to watch as they don't brown much but a GREAT cookie in the end!  Thanks for this great recipe.

Great recipe.   I followed it exactly (1 stick salted butter, 1 stick unsalted) and cooked them for 16 minutes.   Perfect!

Hmmmm...not the best I've eaten.  Don't get me wrong; they were good, but I was expecting that Subway cookie chewiness and I didn't get it.  They were big and saucer like, but a little dry and crumbly.  Not bad, but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

Great texture.  Very large cookie. Mine didn't brown much and I definitely  wouldn't cook them longer than the 17 minutes. Mine were almost too salty, but probably due to the fact that I used salted butter.  Would recommend it!

I rate my cookies based on how hard it is to stop eating the dough and cookies. You know, when you have to make yourself stop. Didn't have that problem with this recipe. However, my husband, who hates everything walked into the kitchen grabbed a cookie and said "Wow these are really good.Maybe even the best you ever made." I prefer the recipe on the package of I Can't Believe Its Not Butter baking sticks. WAYYY BETTER.

These were okay but not the best by any means.  I thought they were way too thin and had too much of a brown sugar taste.  I guess I prefer my cookies a little more substantial.  The butter was probably what caused them to spread so much..maybe if you divide with shortening they would hold their shape better.  Also, using bread flour instead of all-purpose may make them "cakier".

These were pretty good, and easy to make, But too cakey. I baked them at 350 instead of 300.  At 300 I felt like they would never cook. The hubby said that they were the best "dunking in milk" cookies ever though. Thats why I gave them 4 stars and not 3.

These are good!  I don't think they're the best I've ever had, but they're quite yummy.  They were kind of crunchy last night after they had cooled and I'm curious to see if they've softened up at all.  I will add these to my regular cookie rotation. :)

These were good cookies, but not the best I have ever tasted. I also didn't like the fact that they came out so thin! Although they spread so much, they didn't turn out crisp in the end. They actually remained soft and a bit chewy. I only baked for 17 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

the dough was easy to work with if you use a stand mixer, making sure to use the dough hook near the end. I liked the fact, that you didn't need to refrigerate these before you bake them. Also, I made mine with a heaping tablespoonfull so that we would have more smaller cookies. Yummm!

So these were really good, but not my favorite I have made from the site. I expected them to be a fuller thicker cookie. But I love trying new things, and these did not disappoint. I used milk chocolate chips, one cup of whole wheat flour (I try to sneak it in whenever I can) and cooked for 15 minutes.

These are the best cookies I've ever made.  I made some giant, some regular, and some itty bitty, and all of them were fantastic.  They aren't cakey or crispy, but not too dense either.  The giant ones resembled the cookies from out local Pacific Cookie Company.    These cookies are perfect.  Now to make them into a chocolate cookie with mint chips....

well they weren't the best I've ever eaten but they were the best chocolate chip cookies i have ever made. For some reason I've just never been able to do the cc cookie but now with this recipe i finally can do the simple task of making cc cookies! I followed the recipe and mixing all the flour in was rather hard to do but it was sooo worth it. I didn't find them greasy like i had read in a few other reviews. Over all a very good cookie!

these cookies came out very tasty, but not as puffy as i was hoping theyd be.  i will definitely make them again, because they are still better than any other recipe i have, but i'd like to figure out how to stop them from spreading so much.

These cookies do come out good they taste great if you don't think about all the flour. The dough is a little hard to work with all the flour in it but it's still manageable. I cooked them at 300 F but it took my stove 20 minutes. One last thing these cookies get big when cooked I got about 6" cookies, next time I'll probably use half the portion size so they won't expand as much.

if you like big soft cookies to go with a cup of milk these are for you. personally i didn't think the flavor was that great, not a traditional chocolate chip cookie flavor. i prefer a more chewy less cakey cookie. My husband thought they were really good though.

I am a firm believer if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it. However this recipe is going to change that. As with others I was sucked din by the title. Followed recipe exactly. I did not care for these at all.

Recipe converts well to a 'reduced sugar' treat. I used Splenda brown sugar, Splenda white sugar, Hersheys SF chips and halved the recipe. Nice soft, chewy consistency, mega-sized. But, they were REALLY sweet (I had 'firmly' packed the brown sugar but will cut back on next batch.)

Okay, first really terrible name.  Second, I will never make just 24 cookies from this recipe again.  I found they just never really cook all the way through.  VERY GOOD cookie.  I don't know how often I would make these though.  Maybe just for special occasions.  ??  I wish I could rate these 3.5, I have made other recipes I like as much.  I was expecting a phenomonal foolproof  cookie with name like that, they just don't live up to the name.
