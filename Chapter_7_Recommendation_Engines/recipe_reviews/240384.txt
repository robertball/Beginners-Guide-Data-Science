Wow, does it get any easier than this?  I used leftover potatoes from dinner the night before and it was super quick and easy.  I love how flavorful this was and a nice change from the typical bacon and cheese.

Loved these easy, crispy taters!!!  I did use the No Bean version of chili. . . I like spicy so I may add jalapenos next time:)

I didn't scoop out the potato pulp, because I wanted to use them for a meal, so I just cut a baked potato in half, and spooned on the chili and cheese, then baked in oven for 3 - 5 additional minutes and topped with sour cream and green onions, as directed.  Really good and made a great lunch!

These were great, just a little bland. My boyfriend doesn't like sour cream so we need something else to spice it up.

It could have used about fifteen or more minutes in the oven before the hollowing process.

One of my new favorites! The Hormel Chili really kicks up the flavor! I omitted the sour cream and green onions.  Made twice so far.

I loved everything about these and I was especially impressed with how good the Hormel chili was. These were pretty enough to serve guests yet simple enough to whip up for a football game. I expected the chili to loosen up as it heated and run out all over the place but it stayed perfectly tucked into the potatoes where I put it. I was very impressed with this recipe and will make it often. Thanks Hormel for restoring my faith in can chili!

These were delicious! Very easy to make and filling to eat.
I did use dried chives in place of the green onions,  because that's what I happened to have on hand. The Hormel Chili with Beans was so good and easy to work with. We will be having these again very soon.

This was easy to make and looked "fancy" when the sour cream and chives were first added.  I would have liked it spicier and would salt the potatoes with garlic salt instead of regular salt next time.  Jalapenos would be a plus!  Otherwise, really easy for the kids to eat.

Absolutely delicious!  I roasted mine with the salt and pepper from the beginning as I didn't want to fiddle with hot potatoes anymore than I had to.  Spicy xhili would be even better with this!  Everyone in the family enjoyed these bites of yumminess.

A side that's easy to make, fun to serve, and different from chips on hot dog night.
