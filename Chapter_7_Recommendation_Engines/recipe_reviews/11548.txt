This recipe was not good, not bad... Lots of work involved. These are the kind of cookies that you would only eat to spare throwing them away. I almost had to force my family to eat these for dessert! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you like stale, over-buttery, crumbly cookies

I grew up with these cookies, and I make them every year.  I mold them as thin as possible to make a crisp cookie.  Make sure to cool them in the tins - they're much less likely to break.  They taste great with coffee or tea.  A wonderful light butter cookie, not too sweet.
