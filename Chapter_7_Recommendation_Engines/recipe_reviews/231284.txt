Had no idea this had been published... thanks!!  I found the readers' reviews very helpful. Note I do add honey to the banana mixture now, and I don't ever skip the banana extract or the flavor will get lost. I have not tried this yet, but I thought about making candy bacon and adding a struesel topping for the top with the bacon in that, rather than putting the bacon inside .

I'm the only one who has tasted this so far and I find it hard to rate.  I don't love it but don't hate it.  I only made one change to the recipe by using all vanilla extract.  I did not want to buy banana extract which I would probably never use again.  The banana taste in the final product is not pronounced which probably could be helped with the banana extract.  You can taste the whiskey and you can taste the bacon.  I think I'm disturbed by the bits of bacon in the bread.  They just don't seem to belong.  I think for my preference the bacon and drippings could be left out altogether for a better final product.  I will update when DH tastes it and then when he takes it to work for his coworkers to try.  ***Update:  the bread was more appealing when it had cooled and sat for a while.  I still am not fond of the bacon bits.  DH could not identify what was in it but he did guess alcohol although he thought vodka.  The people at his office snapped it up as usual and most had positive reviews.  He asked that I make this again only in mini muffin tins.

Just made this and it is SO GOOD! I substituted the butter for yogurt and use gluten free all purpose flower.

Whiskey, bananas and bacon – as the submitter states “Just ALL kinds of wrong!”  I was intrigued with this recipe since ‘It’s A New Day’ pointed it out.   I went to the liquor store and purchased a small airplane size bottle of Wild Turkey American Honey ® Bourbon Whiskey for this recipe.  The liquor store owner wants a loaf of this bread to try it out.  It is quite different than any banana bread I have tried.  The liquor taste really is lost in the bread, but the bacon flavor is not.  I can’t say we loved this bread, but we didn’t dislike it, either.  It definitely is better the second day once the flavors had time to meld.  We actually liked it best toasted for breakfast rather than eating it as a quick bread.  My 5 loaves baked in 35 minutes.  Thanks “HappyAZGirl” for sharing your recipe and having me step outside of comfort zone as far as banana bread is concerned.

I really really wanted to like these.  I tried the recipe twice, but the bourbon flavor got lost both times even after I added more.  The original recipe is too sweet and overpowers the bacon perhaps some honey instead would boost the flavors.
