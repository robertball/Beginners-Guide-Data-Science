These are great, espeically as a vegetarian option for a hot appetizer.  One suggestion:  after rolling spinach and dough up, put it in the freezer for 15 minutes, or refrigerate for as long as you like, they are much easier to cut that way.  I also put extra cheese spread on.

I've been making these as party appetizers for a few years now.  I use fresh baby spinach and the light alouette garlic and herb cheese spread.  Sometimes, I put in a few very thin slices of virginia baked ham from the deli as well.  They are always a hit.  I appreciate the idea to refrigerate them before slicing.  I've always found them hard to slice, but I'd never thought of that.  Thanks for the suggestion- I'll try it next time!

Great idea! I modified it a bit... sauteed diced ham, onion, and mushrooms in olive oil, then added to half of spinach mixture before placing on crescent roll dough. I also added some shredded cheese to the mixture, plus some oregano & ground black pepper. I  made "mini" pinwheels, then topped with swiss cheese before baking. Had to bake an extra 5-6 minutes to get them cooked through and golden brown, but they were great! Especially good served with a creamy dressing/dip, like Ranch, dill, or Caesar. Will definitely make again!

these pinwheels are easy & delicious! i made a half recipe for new years day using one package crescent rolls, a 4 oz. package of boursin's lite herb cheese spread & almost the whole 10 oz. package of spinach. as recommended by other reviewers, i chilled the roll for easier slicing. i also put the pinwheels under the broiler during the last minute to make them golden brown. thanks bonnie!

This is a very easy and tasty appetizer. Definitely put the dough back in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes for easier slicing. Next time a will use more of the cheese spread and might even stir the spinach into it before spreading. I will make these many more times I'm sure!

These were ok I had trouble with the insides cooking, maybe I had too much filling but the outsides were close to burning before the inside dough was baked.

Tried these over the weekend and they were VERY good. Everyone loved them. Personally, I thought they needed a little bit more flavor. Even though I used the garlic and herb spread I think it needed more garlic/salt to make it tastier. Also used garlic butter crecent rolls. I love the way they smell while cooking. I mixed the spinache and cheese together and then spread on dough. ABSOLUTELY need to put in the freezer for a little while in order to slice.

3 simple ingredients with great results!  Even when they're messy to cut, they still end up looking pretty decent and tasting wonderful.  I used Alouette spread and the seamless crescent roll dough.  This is a keeper.

Big hit!  I used cream cheese mixed with minced garlic and green onions as the spread.  putting it in the freezer after rolling in your ingredients is a must!

I made these for the first time to share at a get together with some girls from church and they went over well.  Everyone was immediately eager to try them, and said they were very good.  I tried one straight out of the oven and felt that it was good but seemed to be missing something, just needed a little more flavor.  When I tried them again later I didn't notice it so much, so I'm thinking I like them better when they're not steaming hot.  Super simple to make, looks really appealing, and tastes good.  I'll definitely make these again.  Also, they're not terribly unhealthy - I used low-fat crescent rolls and you couldn't tell a difference.  My one definite tip is to chill before cutting.

These are delicious and super easy to make!! I used reduced fat crescent rolls and light garlic herb cheese spread. These would definitely be good with the addition of mushrooms, onion, ham, etc.

This recipe is sooooo easy to make and everyone loves it. I've brought it twice to parties and it is the first thing to go. It's my new go-to appetizer. They are probably best hot, but they do sit out on the buffet for a while just fine and get eaten. I use a handful of fresh spinach for each roll-up because it's easier than thawing and draining.

So easy! Used 1 can of crescent dough because it was all I had. Then I used 1/2 a brick of plain cream cheese and mixed it up with 1/3 box of spinach, garlic salt & garlic powder. Mixed that all up together and spread on dough. Froze for 15 minutes before slicing. Great suggestion! Delish! Next time will make for a party.

Made these in the past and everyone loved them. The one change I made with this recipe was that I used different types of goat cheese as it is a soft cheese and really added flavor to these. I used a garlic and herbs and pepper spiced goat cheese for the inside filling. This did add a little extra work, but nothing difficult at all. I had no complains and everyone loved them.

I'll be making them again this thanksgiving

I made these for a potluck and everyone seemed to love them! I used fresh spinach, and I think I should have squeezed a little more moisture out of it before baking - the insides were definitely a bit less done than the edges. Despite that, my cousin said it was one of his favorite potluck recipes, and since we've been having potlucks almost weekly for about a year, I'd say that's a pretty good review! Definitely freeze them for a little while before cutting!

I personally thought this was really bland, my coworkers and boyfriend seemed to enjoy it though.  I definitely suggest freezing the rolls as other reviewers have stated; it makes slicing a lot neater and easier.

Very yummy! I wasn't sure where to look for the garlic herb cheese spread but i found it by the veggies and fresh sandwiches. I'm sure these would taste great with any cheesy spread!

Made for a quick new years appetizer and it is so yummy and easy! Next time I would add red pepper flakes or minced garlic to give it some zip! Also I froze half of the recipe so if I have people pop in I have an instant appetizer.

These were great!  I used light refrigerated crescent rolls and light Rondel garlic and herb cheese. They came out great!! My only warning is this: Make SURE to squeeze out all the moisture from the spinach, and don't be tempted to add the cheese thickly or the dough might not cook all the way.  These would be great for appetizers, or even just to bake a batch or two at the beginning of the week and stash them away for quick snacks during the week!

I used garlic butter crescent rolls for this, and they turned out absolutely delicious. However. I had a very difficult time cutting them, and did not get as many per roll as the recipe says.

These were really good (my 2 VERY picky children ate them)!!  They were also very easy.  I couldn't find the vegetable garlic cream cheese @ the store so I used vegetable medley & sprinkled a little garlic salt over it.  Do re-refrigerate after making (maybe even freeze) cutting was a bit challenging.

These are good and easy. I would have given them a three, but they got such rave reviews that I figure it was just me. Also, I don't think I spread the cream cheese on thick enough. I used regrigerated pizza dough in a tube instead of the crescent rolls as that was what I had. I rolled it out and then cut it in half lengthwise to make two long and fairly skinny rolls. I followed another reviewers advice and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes and they were easy to slice. Because I didn't add enough cream cheese, I served them with a Tzatziki sauce for dipping. The two went very well together.

Easy and great.  I just used a small tub of onion and chive cream cheese and tore up some fresh spinach leaves to sprinkle all over the top until the cheese was covered.  I can't imagine putting in more cheese than the recommended amount, but to each his or her own!

Tasted like I was eating grass. The spinach totally over powered the pinwheels.  I used frozen, chopped spinach drained very well. I used garden vegetable flavored cream cheese. I froze the pinwheels for about 20 mins before slicing. I will not be making these again.

I was reallt disappointed with this recipes, especially after reading a number of glowing reviews.  They had close to no flavor.  I may try them again sometime using fresh spinach as someone suggested and MUCH more of the cheese spread as someone else suggested.

I loved these and so did my company.  I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  Highly advise everyone else to go that route.

These came out so yummy. They went so fast I only got the chance to eat one!! Be sure to really keep an eye on them in the oven, my oven is very strong and they could have burned easily with one minute left too long! Big hit at Thanksgiving, will definitely be making again and again.

I made these exactly as written. I deducted one star because fifteen minutes was way too long of a cook time. Eleven minutes was perfect. The first batch also stuck to my sheet pan, so I sprayed it with Pam for the rest of the batches. Next time, I will mix the spinach with the cheese because it was hard to get the spinach spread evenly. I’ll also add a little Monterey Jack for some additional flavor and texture. We ate them at room temperature at a baby shower, and everyone raved. Thanks for a tasty and simple recipe!

Great simple last minute kind of recipe! I used a lot of cheese just tastes better that way. Everyone inhaled them. If you can find the crescent sheets of dough it’s much easier.

Used garden herb cream cheese and fresh spinach.  Was well liked.  I followed the advice to freeze fro 15 min before cutting, but I may even do a little longer next time.

What I would recommend is to use the butter flaked pillsbury crescent rolls dough rather than the original and spread more of a thinner layer of spread! I rolled mine just like a crescent roll and it came out just right!
With this recipe I can get my brother to actually eat spinach! Haha

I used the Philadelphia cream cheese spreads and they came out awesome! Half of them were the spicy jalapeno flavor and the others were the chive and onion flavor. The second time I made them, I used fresh spinach that I had soaked in water for a little while and then chopped it up. I actually liked them even more that way. Great easy recipe! Oh and the buttery garlic crescent rolls are great if not using a garlic spread!

Really easy to make and tasty. I used my mini muffin pan instead of a flat cookie sheet and this worked perfect to make the perfect size to make a mini spinach muffin. This way i did not have to worry about making a perfect pinwheel. They worked as an appetizer for a superbowl party - for those who wanted at least a little veggies with their wings and meatball. I will make them again.

I was rather dissapointed in these. I read all of the reviews, hoping I had fixed anything difficult with the recipe. I even made homemade garlic and herb cream cheese. I read some reviews that said the insides were still raw, and I assumed they used garlic and herb cooking cream and not the cream cheese. However, mine seemed kind of doughy on the inside also. I was hoping, from the picture, they would be crisp and flavorful. However, they seem to have no flavor and are pillow soft. I was using up some leftover crescents from Christmas, and so wanted to have a new appetizer to add to my holiday list. These just tasted like a soft biscuit with spinach.

i had some difficulties with keeping the pinwheels rolled, I'm thinking of using a toothpick the next time. I also added turkey in my second batch.

Definitely were hard to cut.  If I had read the reviews I would have chilled the dough before cutting.  In the end I wrapped the rest as croissants and those were good too.

This recipe is a great start to many variations.  It's a must to put the rolls in the freezer for about an hour in order to firm them before slicing into rounds.  I may try real bacon pieces next time just to add flavor.  But it sure is easy!

Although the spinach was "chopped" I would chop it up more with a knife and cutting board.  We tried a dip rather than a cream cheese type substance, but that was not very successful.  I would definately make this again, but use a cream cheese mixture.  It was a hit with my family.
