This recipe is Great!if you don't have enough time to whip something up this was so fast and so inexpensive to make. the only thing I did different was I used a regular size cool whip and I put it in a graham cracker crust pie shell. so good so good! I say give it a try. I made 3 of them and I didn't have any left.

1/2 sugar per 8 oz cream cheese works better with this recipe, also blending the sugar into the cream cheese with a hand mixture until the cream cheese is smooth will give it a creamier texture. Also I had pudding cups so I mixed 2 chocolate pudding cups in, then grated a bit of chocolate candy bar over the top as a garnish. Best way to make it seems to be using cupcake holders in a cupcake pan, put layer of fruit filling in, add this cream cheesecake until 3/4 full, top with oatmeal cookie, freeze. Take out, remove cupcake wrapper, place on plate with fruit side up and let thaw for individual cheesecakes. My husband has informed me the best way to eat this is rolled up in a pancake topped with fruit for his version of a blintz.

I really liked this pie. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust. I also added one teaspoon of amaretto liqueur.: ) Nice flavor. Topped with cherries it looked visually appealing. It didn't quite have the texture of regular cheesecake. Wonder if the cream cheese needs to be increased? At any rate it's quick and convenient - which works for me being a full time working woman. I took it to a potluck last night and it was all gone.

This was pretty good. Definitely not the best cheesecake I've ever had by any means but the quickness made up for it. I didn't make the crust as I used a pre-made one.

Good flavor although it doesn't have the texture of cheesecake at all. I've made this many times using a premade graham cracker crust. Try adding chocolate chips caramel or any other toppings to make it different variations of cheesecake.

I have made this recipe using a graham cracker crust and adding 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar and also adding either lemon juice or lime juice. If I use a lemon or lime I use the whole lemon/lime. If I don't have a lemon I use a capful of lemon juice. My mother likes it plain without fruit on top. If we have company then I add some cherry pie filling to the cut piece of pie. If I use the lime I don't use any fruit with it. Sometimes I will sprinkle some colored sprinkles on top of the pie to decorate it. Dont expect a New York style cheesecake but do expect a quick easy good dessert every time.

I loved this pie filling with a few variations. I added a 16 oz. carton of whipped topping and 1 cup of powdered sugar to the mixture. I used 2 6 oz graham cracker crusts and a can of blueberry pie filling on top. Yum yum!

I've made this a couple of times using the basics. I change the cream cheese to 4- 8oz.fat free blocks fat free frozen whip topping and use 2-3 tsp. almond extract. I delete the sugar seems the cool whip is sweet enough. I portion these into 3/4 cup portions and stir in frozen blueberries when served. It makes a nice fat free snack.

Great Job!! I used a little different approach for low sugar: Slenda instead of sugar with hot fudge drizzled on top. Sugar per slice is 2g. That is using the sugar free cool whip.

So good! A much lighter texture than regular cheesecake which I loved! Definitely worth trying for a light simple dessert with great cheesecake flavor.

This is so delicious and easy to make! The best crust to use for easier preparation is the pre-baked store bought graham cracker crust. For the topping I used a mixture of fresh sliced strawberries strawberry jam and a bit of sugar. Very good!

Super Easy and tasty! I used a store bought graham cracker crust and used light Cool Whip and reduced fat cream cheese. I topped it with canned cherry pie filling for a fast and easy dessert. I only gave it 4 stars because I was hoping for a more "cheesecake" flavor which it is lacking. But still tastes great nonetheless.

I was the only one who thought so but this turned out almost unbearably sweet. I wouldn't have been able to have more than one slice. I added in a large amount of blueberries and strawberries which fortunately turned it delicious. As the recipe says however it was ridiculously rich for me - perhaps it was just the whipped topping I used. If you're not adding fruit I suggest using non-fat whipped topping and 150% or 200% the original amount of cream cheese. Then taste to see if you need to add the sugar. (I would assume you'd need to after adding the extra cream cheese.) The pie wasn't a disaster by any means but I think it could use a few adjustments to make it outstanding.

Added a little lemon zest and juice of a half of a lemon. Also 2 drops of yellow food coloring since it was so white! Topped with crumbled mini Oreos. very quick and easy!
