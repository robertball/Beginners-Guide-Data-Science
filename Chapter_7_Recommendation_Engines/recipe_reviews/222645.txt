I flip-flopped the basil/thyme amounts. I used this whole recipe in a greek pasta salad recipe. Fantastic. Was the perfect blend of spices in the perfect amount. LOVED IT.

I love this seasoning.  I use it to make Greek salad dressing: 1/3 c of red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard, and 1 Tbsp of this seasoning.  Superb.

This was really good. I sprinkled it on scrambled eggs this morning. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, but it was delicious! Thanks for sharing.

Very simple to get together from ingredients I already had in my pantry.  I subbed the dried garlic for fresh. Was perfect on the Greek Seasoned T-Bone Steak from AR.

This was a pretty good substitute for the expensive canned Greek seasoning. I did have to pump it up a bit with kosher salt, doubled the oregano and added 2 teaspoons of dried mint. Worked great for my dish. Thanks for sharing!

This Greek seasoning was amazingly yummy!! I initially was trying to make. Greek salsa that called for Greek seasoning, which my grocery store didn't have so I quickly looked this up, I cut the ingredients in half added olive oil and white balsamic vinegar, drizzled it over cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, added fresh garlic and sea salt!! OMG

Nice for a home version. The best I have tried is Jimmy's Greek Seasoning but this recipe took five minutes to mix and is pretty tasty.

I would go to the Greek restaurant just for their marinated steaks and chicken etc. Now I make my own. This can be a rub on almost anything like chicken, steak, pork tenderloin, salads pasta you name it. You can change the blend a little to get flavors you like more but I made it just like it is and use it all the time and everyone loves it.

Love Greek seasoning. Best I have had was my aunt Marie, sadly she has passed on, hoping my cousins have the recipe. I have made this yet but it looks really good.

We liked if!  I added salt equal to half of the oregano, and I was going to use o Jon powder but couldn't find it.  I didn't tell the fam that we had fun out of gyro seasoning for our chicken fillets, but they didn't seem to notice!  In the future, I shall skip the salt and do that separately.

Why was I buying Greek seasoning at the store? This is WAY better! I put it on some burgers and topped them with feta cheese and OMG they were so delicious! I'm glad I have this recipe and will be using it on all sorts of stuff because I love Greek food!

Too much oregano for my taste. Maybe if I had added some mint, it would have been better. It was just too heavy.

I added the mint and it was amazing on lamb chops. Store bought greek seasoning is loaded with salt. After a heart attack  my husbands is on a reduced sodium diet, so this was perfect.

This is so good. I use this when I make roast potatoes as a side for greek chicken, but I would love to try this in other ways. Great flavor :)

I thought this was a quick and easy blend. I needed it for a recipe I found calling for Greek seasoning. My only change was using granulated onion and garlic powder instead of minced. The recipe called for olive oil and Kosher salt. I think, it is what saved this from not having an over-whelming amount of flavor. I still ended up adding some garlic salt at the end of my recipe. If I made again I might use fresh minced garlic, the salt, and then let the blend sit a in a little olive oil before adding to a recipe.
