I just made this to take to a party. There seemed to be too much whipped topping so I'm just adding more fruit w/juice for sweetness and rice. Pretty good for a quick easy rice salad!

This has been a staple in our house as a special dessert with dinner night since I was a kid in the 80's. Instead of fruit cocktail my Grandmother used just diced maraschino cherries to make it. My daughter loves this and I'm glad to pass it along to her.
