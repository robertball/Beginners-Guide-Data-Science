I liked this! I didn't have the kale on hand, so I just used spinach, celery and carrots. Next time I would probably add 1/3 cup of barley next time.

Good - different. Next time I might spice up the chicken a little.

I made this using what vegetables I had on hand - a little kale, spinach, bok choy, potato, carrot, scallions, garlic and 3 chicken breasts and it's very good. Used "Better Than Bullion" for broth, lower in sodium. Bringing it to a friend recovering from heart surgery. I will save this recipe to use again!

I loved this recipe.  I will definitley make again.

I added extra 4 cups of broth, 4 sm/med red potatoes with skin and a whole bag of spinach leaves.  

I also used chicken pulled from previously cooked chicken legs, not breasts as the recipe called for.  I think the leg meat is more flavorful myself.

Its on the stove. ROFL! What a job. I think the name of this soup is far too banal. It should be something like Vegetables of the Lost World soup or Chupacabra soup in honor of that strange k named vegetable. Haven't tasted it yet and I will be back to weigh in on that. It's done and it's fab! Everyone warned me oh those turnips will be bitter.... nope! They taste good. And so does that K vegetable. It is a bit bland but I figure a person can add to taste things like pepper or cheese. Thanks for the great recipe.

I forgot to buy a leek so I threw in some diced onion and some fennel I had on hand.  My friend can't have barley so I used wild rice instead.  And I added celery seed because it needed some more flavor.  Everything else was per the recipe and everyone except my 7 yo loved it!

I made this recently. I used the base recipe and added what I had on hand. Zucchini and Bok Choy. Way more vegetables than chicken. I also added a bit of cumin and curry because those are the flavors I like. It turned out really delicious.  You can use anything really to make this a great soup. Will use this recipe in my rotation.

I agree with Laure. A little more barley would be good. Great simple recipe

This is a super flexible recipe. We used rutabaga instead of turnip, parsnip instead of carrot, skipped kohlrabi, and added 1/3 cup of barley instead of 1/4.  It was excellent.
