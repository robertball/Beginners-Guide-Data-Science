Maybe I did something wrong since all the other reviewers loved this recipie.  It came out horrible.  We ended up having to eat out since no one wanted to try the ham.  It was overcooked and smelled awful.  I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to this meal all week.  I followed the directions to the letter, but it was still awful.

Very Easy and very good. The only thing I changed was I used a boneless 1/2 ham instead of a canned ham. I happened to be at home the day I made this, so every couple of hours I would baste the ham with the O.J. mixture but I don't think that is necessary. The family raved about it. I will make this again.

I did not like this recipe at all.  The combination of orange juice and pineapple left a very bitter flavor.  I thought that adding some more brown sugar would help, but it didn't.  I ended up pouring the entire thing out of the crockpot and just putting in water, brown sugar and honey to save my ham.  At least I can say this much - the ham cooked very well in the crock pot despite the fact that my pot seems to burn things often.

Very easy and family loved it.  Used tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  Will definitely make this again often.

I used half as much juice and added a TBS of horseradish. You could also use any non diet cola, horseradish and brown sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.

Love love love this recipe!  Made with a boneless ham, not a canned ham. And don't forget to baste frequently.  Is the juiciest ham I've ever eaten, and terrific flavor!

I tried this for a holiday dinner and it was great!  I thickened the sauce with a little corn starch after it was done and served it as a glaze at the table.  Will definitely make again!

I did not care for this recipe but I gave it a "3" because it might be better using fresh ham instead of canned ham

Tasted bitter to me, not sweet. It was edible, but I wasn't impressed.

This recipe worked out perfectly! I just moved in with my boyfriend and my cooking experience is very minimal but I thought I would give this one a try with my new slow cooker. Instead of using canned ham I used a 1 Kg boneless smoked ham, 6 hours on higher heat in my slow cooker. It was so juicy and tender we both loved it! Definitely going to keep this recipe around!   Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. The only oj I had was Sunny D. I do not recommend using this, because every bite of the outter parts of the ham tasted just like it. My husband really like it, which was a shock. Will make again using regular oj. Thanks.

Didn't care for this much.  Tons of liquid when the 8 hours were over.  Seemed more boiled than slow cooked.  Not alot of flavor.  Won't make again.

i changed quite a bit, but still used the same idea :) i used a can of sprite instead of water, half cup of brown sugar, half cup of oj, and chunk instead of crushed pineapple, and added cherries at the last hour and a half.  cooked all day in the slow cooker, and was sooooooo good!

I made this with a fresh, 5 lb ham...Wonderful! There were a few problems, though. There was way too much liquid at the end, and the rind cooked completely off. Also, it was so tender it was falling off the bone, which makes it hard to slice. I think next time I make this I will reduce the orange juice by half, and possibly knock an hour or so off the cooking time. Other than that, this recipe was WONDERFUL!

Good recipe. To thicken the sauce I would suggest using orange marmalade.

Very, very good and easy!  Used a 6 lb. fresh ham instead of canned (cooked for 6 1/2 hours instead of 8 on low).  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Did baste a few times while the ham cooked.  Will definitely make again.

Came out badly and I followed the directions exactly with a quality 5# ham. I had to grind the whole thing up and make ham salad. Total waste of a beautiful ham.

I used a whole fresh ham, not canned, and my husband said it was the best ham he ever had, maybe it depends on the OJ you use, ive found some are more bitter than others.
