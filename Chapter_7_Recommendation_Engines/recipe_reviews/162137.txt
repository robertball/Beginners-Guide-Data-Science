This might say "Pie Filling" but let me tell you it is great on toast or English muffins too.  I wish I had a ready supply of blueberries.  I would be making this all the time!  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

It tasted watered down, if I make again I will cut way back on the water. It thickened up when I cooked it, but after I canned it was as thin as water. Make only as much as you will use right away and it might not be so bad.

I used this recipe as somewhat a base for Blueberry Pie in a Jar.  I packed 17 qts BLUEBERRIES (raw packed), 10 c apple juice & 10 c tropical fruit juice, 2 c sugar, 6 T lemon juice, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, 2 c cornstarch.  I packed the blueberries into jars, made the thickened syrup & poured over.  Processed in water bath for 20 min.  Absolutely fabulous!

The pie filling is tasty, but I warn everyone who makes it in pint jars to leave a whole inch of headspace because this expanded in the canner and leaked everywhere.

I made this recipe to the exact directions. It turned out too watery for pie filling. It will be great to use as a blueberry syrup for pancakes, French toast or over ice cream. I would suggest less water. Taste great! Just too watery.

I only added 1 tsp. Salt. It turned out perfect. Berries we're still a bit firm and filling thickened nicely. I'll make it again!!

Well this looked fine until I made it.  Too much water first. Took hours to cook down. Too much salt. Salty taste   Not enough corn starch.  I redid it using 5.5 cups water (4 with the berries and 1.5 with the corn starch) no salt. And 1.5 cups corn starch.  It came out excellent.  30
Min in a water canner.

The salt is unnecessary and just didn't taste right. The corn starch globbed up and gave me mouthfuls of goopy starch. I was glad I made only a half batch, and didn't bother processing it.

Horrendously salty. Consistancy is good, colour good, blueberry flavour is good but then it's ruined by all that salt.  Going to try it with about 1/4 of what's called for and see how that goes.  Sure happy I made a small test batch and didn't ruin *all* my berries.
