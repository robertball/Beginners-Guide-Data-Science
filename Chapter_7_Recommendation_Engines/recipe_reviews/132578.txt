Had this for a bunch of ladies, everyone seemed to like it.  Had nice kick and I liked the taste of the Edam cheese.  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the mushroom mixture.  I gave it 3 stars because it kind of fell apart while cutting.  I think it needs a little more egg mixture.  I would try this again.

This was just OK. It could have had some chopped garlic added in with the onion to give it more flavor, and it could have used more spice. Also, it didn't say when to add the parsley...maybe sprinkled on top? Since I used dried parsley, I mixed it in with the egg/sour cream mixture. I probably won't make this again.

I prepared this exactly as written except that I used low-fat rather than fat-free sour cream.  It was okay; not bad, but not something I look forward to making again.  It didn't really have enough flavor for us.
