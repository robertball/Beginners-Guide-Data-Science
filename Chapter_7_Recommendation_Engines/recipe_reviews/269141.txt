I made it and got great reviews.  I used Penzey Spices rather than fresh which saved time.  I would not add salt next time because the cheese provides enough.

I have made this recipe twice now.  One time we made it for a women's luncheon with 60 women attending and it was such a hit.  I had people asking me for the recipe for a week after.  I did cut the butter way back and went 3/4 heavy cream and 3/4 milk.  I find that if you let it sit after bringing it out of the oven the excess grease is absorbed (I think its from the cheese).  Anyway it was a real hit and I'm making it for Christmas dinner.

Lots of prep time chopping and cleaning fresh parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme plus thinly slicing the sweet potatoes.  Could do this the night before to make feast day less hectic.

The recipe as written is delicious. I did sub swiss for Gruyere because my local cheese counter was out and I couldn't find it elsewhere. I was concerned with my sweet potatoes fully cooking and baked 1/2 hour covered followed by another half hour to 45 minutes uncovered and my potatoes were still not done when I went to serve them.  The potatoes had been sliced thin using my mandoline.

This was just a smidge too oily for us as written, but when we tried it again with 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup cream, it was FANtastic. The herb flavor comes through and you get nice browning on top. Definitely Thanksgiving worthy!

Loved all the fresh herb flavor! I lightened it up by cutting back on the butter and using  some milk in place of the heavy cream.

I loved the flavor of this gratin and the gruyere was a perfect pairing with the sweet potatoes.  I only rated the recipe three stars though because it was really greasy.  I don't know if it was from the butter or a combination of the butter and the oil from the cheese.  The recipes also didn't state what size pan to use.  I used a 9 x 13 pan which was perfect for two layers.
