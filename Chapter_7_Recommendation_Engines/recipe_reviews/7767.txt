Taste is a subjective thing but I'm going to add my two cents on this cake regardless.
IMHO this cake has absolutely NO carrot flavor.  It's a beautiful and moist cake
but if that's is all I wanted there are other cakes I could have made.  If you really 
want a carrot cake wait until you have the time and the energy to grate those carrots.
Otherwise wait.....this shortcut isn't worth it.

This recipe is unbelievable.  I had been looking for a good carrot cake recipe- but instead found one that is superb!  My very picky husband and I ate 3/4 of the cake ourselves in 2 days!  The other 1/4 went to some former co-workers that have been begging me for the recipe ever since.  The title says it all- this carrot cake recipe is golden!

I tried 7 differant carrot cake recipes to find the perfect one for a wedding. Everyone agreed, this was GREAT! The baby food is much easier than grating all those carrots(and better flavor).

Ok, I read the reveiws before making this and found I agree with ONLY ONE! I'd like to know how other people got a wonderful carrot cake out of this, good cake yes, but it didn't taste like carrots at all! I'll be grating my carrots from now on, the shortcut this one takes makes you lose too much flavour!

This was the tastiest, moistest yummy carrot cake ever!!!  I had all the ingredients on hand except the coconut so I substituted grated carrots for the coconut.  I will use this recipe from now on.  I was unsure of what kind of icing to use so I prepared my ole trusty icing recipe.  A block of cream cheese, half a stick of butter and a lb of powdered sugar.  I baked the cake in a 9X13 pan and topped with the icing while the cake was still hot.  Very delicious!

I have been making this cake for years, and everyone seems to love it.  If you don't want to use the babyfood (yes, it can be expensive). Use two 14.5 oz cans of cooked carrots, drain and mash them. You get a little more texture and a little more carrot flavor.

I have made this cake for years and lost the recipe, thank goodness someone had it! I also heated up some butter with karo and poured it on top after poking some holes in it. It was so moist, no need for icing. Try it!

This is the best cake ever.  I made it last week for a family gathering.  Used sweet potatoe baby food instead with the pineapple.  People were literally eating the crumbs off the plate.  Next time going to try squash baby food. A diffent keeper.

A great carrot cake. Very easy to make. Very moist and tasty, too! I made a 9" layer cake instead of a 9x13. Used the 'Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe here and then pressed crushed walnuts on the side of the cake. It was beautiful and delicious!

I've made this quite a few times and I absolutely love the recipe. Everyone I've ever served it to has loved it as well.  One little issue is that I have never been able to find 4.5 oz. jars of baby food. Last time I bought two 3.5 oz. jars and one 2 oz. jar to equal the total 9 ounces, but that isn't a very economical way to go.  Also, the bake time has always been way off for me. I usually end up baking it at least 55 minutes if not a full hour.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.

I, like the other reviewer, read all the reviews before making it but gave it a shot anyway.  I was a little apprehensive because of two reviewers remarking on the lack of carrot taste.  I fully agree with them now that it's done.  It's a good cake, don't get me wrong, but I want a carrot cake.  If you're not interested in grating your own carrots, you can just buy them grated at the grocery store.  But you shouldn't substitute on the carrots...that's definitely not a good idea.

I love this cake.  I did change the amount of oil I put in it.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups I put 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce.  It was still super moist and cut out a lot of fat!!!!

Made this for my husbands 60th Birthday last week...really moist and not overpowered with spicyness...just DELISH!!! Adding the baby carrots instead of chopping up fresh carrots saved a ton of time in the prep...would make this again. :)

Excellent cake -- moist and flavorful.  Have used this recipe as well as the more tradtional recipe (fresh grated carrots) for years.   Some may say that the pureed carrot version has less flavor.  Wrong!  I really don't think freshly grated carrots add that much flavor especially by the time they are baked in a batter with spices and other ingredients -- which is what really makes a carrot cake.   However, if you like to see the specks of carrot in your cake, go for it.  But if you want a fantasticly moist and delicious carrot cake, go for this version.  Trust me, no one will spit it out!

Have been making this cake for over 35 years.  It's the one cake each of my family members ask for as their Birthday Cake. Before this, my mom use to make it for my birthday.  Great flavor and texture.

Excellent recipe.  I had this recipe and lost it.  Did a search and voila!  Best, moist and wonderful.  Great carrot taste.  Compliments from everyone and requests to bake it as a dish for dinners, etc.

This cake was great tasting. I made it as a layer cake instead of in a 13x9 pan. I used my cream cheese frosting on it and it was very good. Very easy. Thanks

This cake was absolutely fantastic. I made it at Easter, with some cream cheese frosting, and it was a family hit. The only thing about the recipe that I had issues with was that baby food (at least locally) comes in 2.5 oz and 4 oz sizes, not 4.5 oz. Two 4oz jars worked perfectly.

Read the reviews, made the cake, and this is my assesment:  True, there are no real carrot shreds in recipe.  True, it is the moistest cake ever!  True, it takes longer than the cook time.  True it is a wonderful tasting cake!  True, did not find 4.5 oz baby food jars, used two 4 oz and added an additional 2T of pineapple.  True, I did not use the walnuts or coconut.  True, EVERYONE loved the cake, and I had to sign on to allrecipes to print out recipe.  True, will make again and again
