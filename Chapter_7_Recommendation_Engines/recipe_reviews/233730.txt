Really good.. easy. I added more red pepper flakes and S&P as I prefer a less sweet more spicy sloppy joe. Served it in a high fiber tortilla for lunch.. yum

We like sloppy joes a little sweet and more sloppy, so I added a little BBQ sauce and small amount of water, 6oz, and it was perfect.

Great alternative to the ketchup- filled recipes. I added about a quarter cup of diced jalapenos.

I loved this healthy version of sloppy joes with ground turkey.  Although my turkey came out a bit burnt, it tasted all right with toasted whole wheat hamburger buns and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I have enough for one more sandwich later this for leftovers.  No tweaked adjustments.

Made it as written, mostly. May have added a little more red pepper flakes than called for because hubby likes things with a little kick. Taste mellowed out the second day. Really good! Will definitely make again.

Added about 12 oz of water and about 2 T of ketsup.  It was very dry but with the water it was great.  Cooked about an hour after water added.  I loved it!

I read all the reviews about how bland this recipe was and according to the exact recipe which is what I started with it was bland. I ended up adding some Tabasco, all purpose seasoning, chili powder and a bit of honey, a can  of tomato sauce and some beef broth was also needed to give it that sloppy joe consistency. It would've been dry without those. One thing I did take away from this recipe was using fresh shopped tomatoes. I will definitely always include those in future sloppy joes no matter the recipe.  2 stars because of all the modifications.

I was looking for something healthier that doesn't use ketchup. This is really good but my family didn't like the bell pepper and, frankly, it was pretty strong. Next time, I plan on using less. 
Also, my leftovers the next day were great so I plan on letting it sit longer before I serve it.

A fast delicious recipe to use ground turkey. I'll definitely be  cooking it again. And, it's more healthy to know the ingredients in what I'm eating.

When I made this, The recipe didn't have enough sauce. So, I added a can of tomato sauce, and it was a much better consistency. Very yummy recipe.

Good stuff! Definately use tomato paste not tomato sauce like I did.. I like my a little more spicy. If you do, add extra red pepper or some jalepenos!

Subbed ketchup and barbeque sauce for tomato sauce because that is what I had on hand.  Pretty good.  I have another recipe that I prefer, but this was still a nice dinner.
