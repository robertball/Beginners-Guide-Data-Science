I changed a few things on this recipe to make it the way my grandmother made them. With these changes i assure you, you cant go wrong. the directions are a little vague so here is my way. i mixed 2 1/2 cups of flour with 1/2tsp salt and set aside. then i mixed 1cup of butter with 1 egg white and 1 1/2tsp vanilla. Then i added 1/3cup of powder sugar(aka confectioner's sugar) then i added the flour mixture and 1/2-1cup of finely chopped walnuts. i rolled them into small balls, a little smaller than a golfball and baked them at 400F (205c) for 8-10min then i rolled them in more powder sugar (confectioner's sugar) to coat. these are great cookies with a slight crumble. full of flavor if you fallow the changes i made.

These have become my favorite! I just ate about 10! I can't keep my hands out of the cookie tin. My daughter helped me make them, they are very simple, and simply delicious. As a co-worker exclaimed, "they just explode in your mouth!" We rolled them twice in the powdered sugar to really make them "snowy". I am so glad I came across this recipe. It will be a part of my Christmas portfolio now!

The balls are small and gimpy.  We took them out early, but at the recommended time and temperature they probably would've caught on fire.  They tasted like crackers covered with icing sugar.  There is only one tsp of sugar for the whole recipe!  I would never make these again.

This is also my favorite, but I use chocolate chip instead of nuts.

These are great to make, especially if you have a good electric mixer with a paddle.  It literally took minutes to mix and was fun for the grandchildren to help with.  I have made these in the past with pecans, peppermint candies(crushed) chocolate chips(minis) but the wasnuts are my favorites. I made a double recipe last night and not one was left tonight!!!

These were great.   After reading some of the other reviews I was a little leery but thought it was worth a shot.  They turned out fabulous, way yummy.   I would just warn what may have happened to one of the reviewers it is didn't ball up--DON'T melt the butter.  Use the same method you would do a pie crust.  Cut the butter into the flour and other ingredients.   Thanks B. Bell...this is one of my favorites

It never would thicken to where I could roll it in balls. I was able to salvage it by finding a different recipe.

Christmas memories abound!  When my girls were young we always had a similar store bought cookie.  I altered this recipe to make it gluten free and viola our favorite cookie is back!  Use Bobs Red Mill baking flour and a 1/4 teaspoon of xanthum gum. Enjoy!

I used peacons and added 2 teaspoons of almond extract insted of vanilla. The almond extract was a huge boost in flavor, otherwise they are just kind of bland.
