Nothing spectacular, really.  But it was decent for a quick weeknight dinner, when I just didn't have the energy to throw more than a few ingredients together.

Pretty basic but also pretty good.  Took no time at all to please the crowd.  Try doing it with Ortega Taco spices as well to get some awesome tacos!!

For a more interesting variation, add a layer of refried beans, some cooked onions, a couple of tablespoons of chunky salsa, and a little cheese.  I make a bunch of these at a time and freeze them for quick lunches any time.
