This soup was amazing. My husband is on his seconds now and said, "This is one of the best soups I have ever had," This coming from a man who usually responds when I ask him how something tastes with, "it's ok."

I only added a little salt and my picture should show, if it uploads, red bell pepper instead of green cause I had it on hand.

Worth a five star rating.

Excellent!  Only thing I did different was I made it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours and added more veggies.  For the last hour or an additional hour, you add your milk mixture and turn slow cooker to high.

I had originally rated this recipe 4 stars.  After letting the soup sit in the fridge for 2 days, I had it for lunch and it was delicious.  Thank you!

I used some of my homemade pesto rather than the dry basil and parsley. I also omitted the milk and flour because my husband isn't fond of cream soups. It was wonderful and very simple to make. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow, made this for family, it was amazing. Changed it a little, First I made 12 servings, 8 not enouph for seconds, yum. Second doubled everything and tripled the ham, also added 2 cans of white beans. I didn't bother with measuring veggies just added whole or a can, round it up.

Exceptional.  The flavor is wonderful.  I used extra sweet potato and ham and next time I will use more and bigger pieces of celery, carrot and green pepper. The creamy broth has enough flavor to carry a lot.  Really a simple, fast and delicious soup.  Thanks for a new regular soup. 

The second time I made this I used a cup or so of all the vegies and sautéed them in EVOO before adding the flour (cooked that a bit) then the stock.  I used gouda cheese.  still wonderful.  Thanks.

I made this soup with some left over spiral ham and it was outstanding!  So much flavor packed into each bite.  I did make two changes: 1) I left out the corn 2) I ran it through the blender at the end once everything was cooked through then I added some fresh chunks of ham to the creamed soup.  Thìs is by far the best loaded potato stylesoup I've ever had.

SO SO GOOD!!!  used red bell pepper as that's what I had on hand, omitted parsley as I didn't realize I had run out, and added handful of cut-up haricots verts because they were in the fridge.  didn't make the base creamy as definitely didn't need anything extra added to the broth base!

Do not even read the recipe just put it in your recipe box and make this soup. It is incredibly delicious and easy to make. I used sweet potatoes from the garden and fresh red peppers instead of the green and it came out fantastic.

Wow. My husband wasn't to sure about this when I told him that I was making sweet potato soup.  Once he tried it he nonchalantly said was good, then proceeded to eat 2 more bowlfuls!  It's a keeper.

Excellent soup, and a good way to use leftover ham. I used nonfat milk and low sodium chicken broth to make it even healthier. Hubby loved it, and so did I!

We were surprised how much we liked this soup. I added the carrots with the onions and waited to add the ham until the peppers and corn. We will make this again.

I made this soup with a leftover ham bone after Christmas. I am currently avoiding corn and green peppers on a restrictive diet I am currently on, so I eliminated those. I also have a gluten allergy, so I did not make the “white sauce” (butter/flour/milk). I just added shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top. It was delicious!! I loved it!!

This is a delicious fall soup recipe that's easy and flexible. I think it's the first time I've ever made a soup and didn't have to do any flavor adjustment at the end at all, not even salt (this might depend on the broth you use though).

If there's any ingredient you don't like, it's easy to leave it out or substitute something similar. For our household's tastes, I left out the bell pepper and corn, and added some fresh thyme and rosemary as it was handy, and it turned out absolutely delicious. Based on the other reviews I have to assume you can make plenty of adjustments to this versatile recipe and get good results. The stars of the show, the ham and sweet potato, go together amazingly well and make for a lovely savory cream coup with just the tiniest hint of earthy sweetness.

Good, Tasted good, i took away a star because it didn't have the "mouth feel" (I always thought this was a joke), I thought it would have. I used Tarragon instead of Parsley. Might have cooked the onion and garlic first, added the potatoes (sweet and white), celery, celery root or endive (some light, tasty green) and stock, cooked then emulsified.  Then added the corn and ham chunks and the cheese roux. Mine looked more like a veggie stew than the beautiful picture of orange soup. But it Was Tasty

THis was so yummy! I did a few changes - 6 c broth & 1 c milk. Added cornstarch to milk to thicken soup. Didn’t add any butter or onion. Used red pepper instead of green.  Used Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar cheese.

This is a very tasty soup. I made it almost exactly as posted. I did omit the pepper as I didn’t have one on hand. I also added the full can of corn. Hubby son and I rated it as five star. I’ll definitely make it again.

I halved the recipe because we were three adults. There was just a little bit left. We all three thought it was great. I will make it again.

Made this in the crockpot as directed by another’s review with just a couple tweaks due to what I had on hand. No peppers and a very small chunk of fresh ginger. I made the milk sauce separate and then added that to the remainder in the crockpot, mixed and let it sit for a little bit prior to serving. My husband and kids Loved this soup! Thank you!

This was absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe as closely...possibly adding more spices but I lived it as did my family.

I will admit, I had misgivings about this recipe from the sound of  the ingredients in it. But, wow!  Delicious! I didn't have green pepper, so used yellow. And I didn't have corn, so omitted that. I roughly mashed up the sweet potatoes with a potato masher once cooked. But all else was the same. I can see why the corn would be a good addition, so next time I'll add that, too.  It's a lot of ingredients, but worth it.

Very good. The first bite seemed bland as it was something new but I keep eating and it was just right. I wish I could say I followed the recipe but I didn't measure the vegetables. I forgot to add the garlic and carrots so I put it them in with the rue. It reminds me of the YES sweet potato corn chowder. I might add some wild rice next time.

Amazing. This is one of the best soups I have ever tasted and definitely the best I have ever made. I added more ham and corn and left out the green peppers and celery (for picky kids). My mouth is watering just writing this.

We were very surprised and impressed by this soup.  It came out rich and homey, prefect for cold weather or a family meal.  I preferred a little extra ham in mine but others enjoyed theirs as is.

Yum! Didn’t add any salt bc of the salt already in the ham—-plus i addd more than the recipe called for.  Kept everything else the same. Great recipe. Even my picky 2 year old gobbled hers up. I’ll be making this again.

I usually always need additional recipes to try out with leftover ham because I get tired of eating it the same way day after day.  Finding a recipe that called for sweet potatoes rather than standard potatoes raised my curiosity.  
I tried it and it is now added to my queue.  As my husband said, "It's a risky thing to try out a new recipe with ham.  Ham is so good already, you don't want to ruin it."  Guys, he had seconds.  
The only thing I did a little different was add a bit of curry too.  It just seemed to call it.  Not too much, though: because it is a delicious soup as is.

I absolutely loved this soup! I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious! I am so excited to eat some leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  I think I might add even more vegetables the second time I make it because I love chunky, hearty soup! Soon good!

My new favorite soup!! I made this almost exactly as the recipe said, except I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it and I added a whole can of corn instead of 1/4 cup. Even my husband and kids (who claim they don't like sweet potatoes) loved it!!!

Delicious, loved it.   I/We like ham and cheese so I doubled those two ingredients and substituted sweet peppers for the Bell pepper.

This was a very good soup. It had some sweetness to it...but that shouldn't be surprising...due to the sweet potato. My changes: I added more sweet potato and omitted the bell pepper.  I added all the veggies as I chopped them up, instead of waiting a few minutes to add the rest. However, I waited to add the corn until it was almost done as I like it to have a fresher taste. I did not make the milk sauce in a separate pan. I just made a slurry with the milk and flour and then added it to the soup. I substituted some  Velveeta type cheese for the cheese.  I'll definitely make again, but I might cut down on the dairy. It was a tad creamier than I'd prefer. Nevertheless, it was very good.

This had a fantastic flavor and, even though it does require some prep time for all the veggies, it was relatively simple to make.  My family loved it so much that they added that to their list of "musts" to remake!  I made it again without the ham and using vegetable broth, with some fresh herbs I cut out of my garden and threw in, and it was just as wonderful.  The texture is great and the sweet potatoes make the dish.  Thanks for a great soup!

Made it as written except for the carrots and parsley.  I didn't have those on hand so I omitted them and added a pinch of garlic salt.  It actually tasted better on the second day after having time to let the flavors blend.

This is a lovely soup. I made the recipe as it was submitted. I wouldn't change anything about the ingredients.

I cooked the soup a bit longer than suggested before blending in the cheese mixture. I simmered it in two stages for 15 minutes each according to the steps in the recipe, and then I turned off the heat and let the broth and vegetables sit covered for another 20 minutes while I set the table, got the remaining ingredients together, and then made the cheese mixture. Having only made it once I can't be sure, but I think it benefitted from the extra time.

This is a terrific way to use sweet potatoes.  I would never have thought to put them in soup.  The second time I made this, I didn't have any ham, so I used some hot Italian sausage that was in the freezer.  It was as good as the ham.

I was looking for a recipe to use my leftover ham from Christmas. I had some sweet potatoes in my pantry as well. I plugged in ham and sweet potatoes into the app. This recipe came up. It is now one of my favorite soup recipes and it will always be the recipe I use for any leftover ham. This is a must make!

Very bland. Threw most of it out.  Will not be repeating.

I have to admit I was pretty skeptical about this recipe. There are many ingredients and it was rather time consuming for me to prepare everything, However, the finished product was very yummy! I would make it again, but definitely not for awhile.

This was a wonderful soup! I used 1/3 cup of butter to make the roux, which is just a touch more than 5 tablespoons, but easier to measure. I forgot to add the cheese to the milk and roux before I poured it into the vegetable mixture, but it melted just fine into that. My husband had seconds, and took the leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for this great recipe!

Used a left over piece of kielbasa and no parsley flakes because I didn't have any. 2% milk. I make a lot of soup, usually just by cleaning out the fridge so following a recipe was different for me. This was really good!

So, my problems with this were absolutely my fault - word to the wise, don't stray too far from the veggie proportions here. I tend to wing it when I cook, and I added a lot more veggies than were called for (as that's generally a good thing in my book). Not so here - but the flavor was delicious, so I imagine if I take the 10 seconds necessary to measure out the vegg instead of roughly eyeballing it with a "more is good" attitude then it will probably be great.

I served this soup to a group of about 80 clergy and church staff who raved about it and requested the recipe.  I only took a quick taste test before feeding it to the masses, but I would say it was a success.  My only change was to put in sage instead of basil and only because I was all out of basil.

This was great--had some sweet potatoes I didn't know what to do with, and this was a great use! My only change--and I guess it is big considering ham is in the title, but I used spicy Italian sausage that I crumbled and cooked up beforehand (about 1/2 cup) b/c I am not  a big fan of ham--added a great amount of spice!

This soup is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I did differently was  use italian seasoning in place of the basil because I was out and put a left over  ham bone in the pan during the first step  which helped remove the remaining ham off of the bone.  I also used some of the left over pan drippings from my shank ham.  I would omit the salt if using a shank ham next time, as  it was just a tad salty, but nothing to complain about.  This soup is thick and rich and is something you would expect to get at a very nice restaurant!  Will definitely make it again.

This soup was wonderful and I don't even like sweat potatoes!  I did make some changes. I added more veggies, and pepper (I used a lot!)I added a half a cup of white wine, and I took out half of everything and put it In the blender then added it back to the rest to make it creamier. I am allergic to anything from a cow so I substituted goat butter,  almond milk for the milk and I used sheep cheese instead of cheddar.  I also added more cheese.  It was so creamy good.   I made a separate batch for my husband with regular butter,  and cheese. I used the almond  milk for him too. I had so many compliments on this soup.

This soup was great!!  I did make a few changes, but nothing to change the rating... I boiled the ham shank in water and used that instead of the broth.  I also followed the advice of quite a few other cooks and used some red pepper instead of green peppers.  Lastly, I added 1t. cayenne pepper (needed a little extra pep) and 3t. chicken bouillon.  My husband ate 3 bowls & said it was "The best soup he's ever had!!"  We are DEFINITELY making this again :-)

I added some fennel, and instead of boring diced ham pulled out some pancetta from the freezer to really send it over the top.  Super yummy, savory Fall soup. I served with some fresh sourdough bread and chardonnay.  Lovely.

Mostly healthy, easy, and delicious! I added some red bell pepper, replaced the parsley with a basic Italian seasoning because I had it on hand. I used some homemade chicken stock that I had in the freezer. My husband enjoyed it very much as well. It's filling without being heavy.

SO SO SO GOOD!! I will make this over and over again! I added a red pepper instead of green, any color would be delicious. And I added a little more chicken stock than it called for because I used more ham and sweet potatoe. Kind of winged it with the amounts of add-ins, I don't really measure when it comes to that. But it turned out so good. It was the first creamy type soup I have made and just so yummy! I couldn't get enough!

I used more sweet Potatoes,I wanted to use them up. I changed the process of the recipe. Cooked the onions and celery first. Then added bell pepper, carrots and garlic. Sweated a few minutes longer. Next I added the broth and sweet potatoes. Cooked awhile. Took some of the cooked mixture out and used a hand mixer to puree some of the sweet potatoes. I wanted a thicker broth. Potatoes thicken a broth nicely. Added back into soup. Then cooked the corn in the soup,later added the cheese and white sauce mix. While eating, I added a mix of peppers, Serrano,cayenne, I felt it needed a little more kick. Could have used hot sauce too. Maybe, cause I added more sweet potatoes.  Like one other reviewer, I like a little more ump to my soups. Felt it was on the mild side. My husband liked it,too.

We added this to our list of favorites.  Delicious.  And we didn't have ham, so we substituted leftover pork loin, and it worked just fine.

Great winter meal. Warmed up a loaf of sourdough bread, great for dipping.
