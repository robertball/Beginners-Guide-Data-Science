Hi everyone, I wrote this recipe when I was just out of high school! Now I am just finishing with graduate school and I realize it should be tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the worchshire and steak sauce. No wonder it was bland! As with any soup though, it is all a matter of taste so add as much as you like to make it taste good. I just give them both a good shaking into the pot and often have to experiment with adding more or adding more water!

I replaced 4 of the cups of water with chicken broth and I used more steak sauce (A-1) and hot sacue then this recipe called for along with some parsley and season salt. The one thing I would do differently next time is to double the barley because I found myself hunting for it with just 1/3 cup. All in and all it is a good recipe and I really like the addition of the steak sauce. Although I feel it needs a bit of tweaking, it is still a fast and hearty soup and I will make again.

This soup is delicious and so easy to make.  I left out the salt/pepper, worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, and hot pepper sauce and added a couple of beef bouillion cubes instead.  I also added chopped zuchinni and a can of cream style corn.  It was delicious.

This was pretty good and easy to make. It ended up being more like 6 to 8 servings. I increased the Worcestershire and hot pepper sauce at the end quite a bit as it tasted a bit bland.

This turned out to be a nice spagetti sauce without the barley but did not resemble soup. Barley must be cooked for a long time or sooked over night in advance.

I had to massively spice this recipe up to make it palatable... it was bland as is. I added some garlic, tarragon, whole pepper, red pepper flakes and beef bouillon, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was good, but a bit bland, as others have said. I added a dash of oregano and garlic powder, and extra hot sauce and steak sauce. With these additions, I'll make this again. Thanks.

I made it according to recipe except I was out of steak sauce. It has a flavor profile similar to a mixture of chili and beef barley stews. My husband and two of three kids really liked it too. I will make this again.

I love this recipe.  I never make it the same way twice.  I sometimes mix 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground sweet Italian sausage.  I usually substitute beef broth for the water and add red wine.   I typically omit the beans and double (and then some) the barley.  The worchestershire sauce is an absolute must in this recipe!
