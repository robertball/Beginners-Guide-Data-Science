This was so easy to make and a hit at Easter dinner.  It is very simple and not overly sweet.  I made the whipped cream using heavy cream, but I suspect that you could buy a whipped cream to make it even easier.  Very tasty!

Followed the recipe just about to the T, but I couldn’t find an 8 oz container of the yogurt, so I used two 5.3 oz containers and did not change any other ratios and it turned out great! I did make more of the crust to put on the sides of the pie pan, the original amount only filled the bottom. It was a hit!

I really liked this, and got pretty good reviews from family.  I did take shortcuts, and still really enjoyed it.  I used a store-bought graham cracker pie crust.  The filling was a little bit more than the pie crust could hold, so I just put the rest in a container in the fridge - a nice little treat!   I also used cool whip instead of whipping my own cream.  Also, I substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream, and therefore reduced the granulated sugar by a tiny bit.  Even with the shortcuts, it was still a light, not-too-sweet, fresh tasting dessert.

This was a big hit at a dinner party. A nice, light summertime dessert . To make it more healthful, I substituted Fage Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It's slightly sweeter, so consider using a little less sugar. Also, I used an additional  1/2 cup of blueberries. I may use the whole pint next time (or put some on the side, as shown in the picture).  I also may try shortcuts -- already made whipped cream and graham cracker crust. Kind of hate to tamper with it though -- delicious!

If you are looking for a light, refreshing and delicious dessert for these hot summer days, try this recipe.  You’ll love it.  I couldn’t find an 8 oz. blueberry yogurt, so I used two 6 oz. containers and adjusted the sour cream accordingly.  It was perfect.
