I have made this for thanksgiving two years in a row and everyove raved about it! It comes out unbelievably juicy and simply delicious! I cubed two apples and stuffed the cavity to have enough to serve with the turkey. I also took the turkey out of the roasting bag about 2/3 of cooking time to prevent the skin from sticking to the bag and basted every twenty minutes after that until it was brown and crispy. I highly recommend this recipe!!!  The flavor is amazing and it's so easy to prepare!
The apples and the champagne really follow through in this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

This Thanksgiving will be the 3rd year I've used this recipe - the last 2 years it has turned out PERFECT!! Since we usually have between 10 and 16 people for Thanksgiving, we use a turkey that is at least 25 lbs - even with the larger turkey you can't go wrong with this recipe!  You do need to check it before the end of the cooking time listed, some ovens tend to cook faster than others (like mine!) so you want to make sure you don't over-cook it.  And definitely make sure you flour your bag before putting the turkey in.  The drippings make an awesome gravy and has been a HUGE hit, one of our guests hates gravy, but when I make this turkey and the subsequent gravy, he can't get enough!  I'm looking forward to making this again this year, we're having more guests this year than the last 2, and they're looking forward to having this awesome turkey! :)

Loved this recipe-just one question:  were we supposed to make "slits" in the oven bag prior to cooking?  I would really appreciate it if someone would respond to this question.  Thanks so much.

My first Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out perfect. Had a bit of trouble figuring out how to remove the neck (was reaching for the hammer when my boyfriend took over), but prepping the bird couldn't have been easier. Season it, squish some butter under the skin and then pour champagne on, in and under the bird's skin, tie close the bag and toss it in the oven. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to cook my 12-pound bird at 275 for 2.5 hours, removing it from the bag and then returning to the oven for another 45mins to brown the skin. Let it sit for another 20 mins before carving and it was amazing. Everyone raved about how moist and delicious it was. Thanks Sarah for the great recipe!

FABULOUS recipe!  And super easy to make too.  A caution when using the oven bag.  I forgot to read those instructions and you need to add flour to the bottom of the bag so it doesn't burst.  I found that out later on and ended up switching bags before I put the turkey in the oven.  The turkey was very moist and I added some chicken boulleon to the broth after it was done cooking so I could make gravy that tasted less sweet.  I highly recommend this recipe, or the homestyle turkey- michagander way on this website.  I've only made 2 turkeys in my life and these turned out better than ones family members have made for years (shh don't tell)

Good luck!

This was fantastic! I used half a red onion and half an apple on the inside, and we used sparkling apple juice instead of champagne (cheaper). The only issue was we did not buy a thermometer, and it didn't cook all the way through in the time allotted. It might be because this was a free range ornagic one, but who knows. We laughed, tossed it back in, and when it came out it was insanely juicy and absolutly amazing. This was the first turkey I have ever cooked, and now my family swears that they won't be using any other recipes now, it was so good. Thanks so much!

I used this recipe to make a 20lb turkey.  It took 2 1/2 hrs. at 350 degrees.  Inside I added 1/2 an onion and cinnamon.  This really added to the flavor of the meat and gravy.  Also I put butter betwen the skin, and on the outside I added butter, tyme, sage, and marjoram.  This made some tasty skin.  My family loved the gravy and moist turkey!

All I have to say is WOW!!!! So perfect and truly THE WORLD'S BEST TURKEY!!!! FOR THE USERS THAT KEEP ASKING : Yes make sure you cut slits in the roasting bag and make sure you flour the bag too or the skin will stick. My turkey was completly wiped off the table and there were only six of us! All gone...I also used the drippings and sauce for gravy and I used the gravy recipe from "Easy Turkey Gravy" and they both combined excellent! This was the first time i made turkey and now I have enough confidence to make Thanksgiving Dinner. TIP: FIRST MAKE THE TURKEY BREAST SIDE DOWN AND IT WILL BE REALLY JUICY. I flipped it back up to the other side the last hour and removed the bag so it could brown. I basted it with melted butter every 20 minutes until it was ready. If you are making your first turkey this is the recipe for you. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!!!!!

Just finished Thanksgiving Dinner using this recipe it was the best turkey I have ever made!!  I used Sparkling Apple Cider instead of Champagne just because I wasn't sure how the recipe was going to turn out but WOW everyone raved over it and how juicy it was. I stuffed the bird with apples and stuffing (it was a 24 pound bird) The stuffing and the gravy made from the juices both turned out spectacular.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  I will definitely use it for Christmas too.

This was a huge hit. This was my first Thanksgiving as the host and I have never cooked a turkey before. We had a 24lb turkey and it came out beautifuly. We cooked it for exactly 3 1/2 hours. We also put butter and champagne under the skin. The gravy that was made from this was just as much a hit as the turkey. Will definitly use this again!

This is the best turkey I have ever made (I've made it about 10 times). It has turned out moist and delicious every time and each time I'm invited to a family gathering I'm asked to provide the turkey (that's the only drawback I've seen to this recipe)! 

I've only seen a few people have problems and here is how to avoid them. First check the temperature of your oven with a thermometer before putting the turkey in - just because the dial says a certain temp doesn't mean your oven agrees. Also make sure you brine your turkey the day before (look for recipes here to do so - it makes a big difference). You also need to make sure the butter is properly distributed in pats under the skin. Always make sure you adjust the amount of the ingredients for the size of the turkey! Some people prefer to add a little less champagne so the gravy isn't affected as much. Lastly I would imagine that some of the people having trouble with dryness might have used a frozen turkey and didn't allow ample time to thaw and they probably didn't brine it which is the secret to increible, moist, turkey.

Another tip for Thanksgiving - try making a Pumpkin Marble Cheesecake - easy and delicious!

I made this last year after cruising the net for a great recipe and it was indeed one of the best turkeys I have ever had. We put a little twist on it...as all good cooks should, which was to pack the cavity with bacon as well as the apples and also layed strips of bacon on top of the breast to kick in a bit more flavor and keep it super moist. Trust me on this, it was a great way to go.

This turkey was fabulous!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I made a few changes based on what we had in the house.  We didn't have any apples, so I cut up 1 1/2 onions and 3 ribs of celery and put that in and around the turkey. I added ~1/2 cup chicken stock to the champagne (we used barefoot dry champagne-it was cheap). In addition to the garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I put ~ 1 tbs rosemary and thyme in the cavity of the turkey.  It was AMAZING.  Simply the best turkey, everyone is still talking about it. It took only 2 1/2 hours to cook a 20 lb turkey, it could have stayed in longer, but it was up to 165 so we took it out.

I have used this method for years -- juiciest turkey ANYONE has ever tasted.  I put an orange, an apple and a short stalk of celery in the cavity.  Also I use BROWN PAPER BAG to roast the turkey.  I spray PAM on the inside and outside of the bag...If turkey is too big to fold bag closed, use another BAG to face into the first one.  I also use a rack to keep the turkey from laying in the juices.  When the bag is opened....the skin is the perfect color and exactly as the photo looks!!!

I have made this recipe for the last 5 years. I have perfected it over the years. First I brine the turkey for a day before using Apple brine for the turkey the night before also found on this site. I then inject the bird with a whole bottle of Tony Chacheres Creol butter injection. I mixed in 2 tbls chopped garlic with the butter before I put it under the skin. I use one apple and red onion sliced in the cavity.  I also put the turkey breast side down for half of the cooking time and then flip in over for 1/4 of the time.  The remaining quarter I remove the turkey from the bag to allow the skin to brown.  I also leave the turkey in the oven for an hour after its done to cool.  I use a Brut champagne and I use the whole bottle for an 18-22 pound turkey.  This makes the best juiciest turkey every time.  I do not flour the bag or cut slits in it. I only baste the last 30 minutes of cooking. The juices make wonderful gravy and also stuffing.

I make this turkey every year and it turns out great.  Just a note to answer a couple questions I have seen, I do cut slits in the bag and I use Asti for my champagne.  It is delicious and everyone raves about it.

Everyone commented on how good this was.  The only thing is it didn't say what type of champagne to use.  I searched the web for some time before I found another recipe similar and it said they used Asti Spumante.  So that's what I used and it was very good.

The instructions on the bag say to cut half a dozen slits in the bag.  Also shake a small amount of flour in the bag to help stop the turkey from sticking.  I have used the bag many times with great success.

E X C E L L E N T!!!

First time baking a Turkey and it came out PERFECT!  The whole entire thing was gone.  No leftovers!

Minor adjustments:

Like a few others here, I used white wine instead of champagne.  I also used aluminum foil instead of using a roasting bag.  I tented it loosely for the first 1 1/2 hours and untented it for the next hour.  After an hour I flipped the Turkey over, loosely tented it again for 30 minutes and untented for another 30 minutes.    

I also basted every 30 minutes.

Breast side down first!

Let it stand for 20 minutes before carving ;)

Yum!!!

Will definitely make this again.

For my first Turkey ever I used this recipe & tweaked it just a bit and all I can say is WOW!!  I have never had such a flavorful or moist turkey. I stuffed the turkey with apples, onions, tangerines & carrots with a ton of cinnamon both in the cavity and under the skin. Per a suggestion I saw on another recipe I covered the turkey in slices of bacon to help seal in the moisture & season the drippings. I cooked my 12 lb turkey in a bag & put slits in it as per the directions & it was done in exactly 4 hours.  While moving the leg to the side to get a good temp reading with my thermometer the bone literally came off in my hand! The turkey was so tender & the drippings made a fabulous gravy by adding sour cream and flour. My family raved throughout dinner about how the turkey turned out. Who knew champagne would do the trick?! I'd highly recommend trying this recipe & can't wait for Xmas dinner at my place again next year.

I used one and a half bottles of woodchuck cider instead of champagne and stuffed the turkey with pears as well as apples.  I have never had a more moist turkey and will use this recipe again in the near future. It was sensational!

I did this way different.  I always start my turkey upside down (most of the fat is in the lower part of the bird) Half way through I flip it over (not easy, but worth it). I also stuff the cavity with apples, oranges and dried apricots wrapped in cheesecloth. That bottle of bubble gets split into 4 applications, 2 before flipping and 2 after.

This was my first time making the turkey for Thanksgiving, and my entire family was impressed. I did follow the directions on the ovenbag box to add flour to the bag before placing the turkey and also cutting a few slits on the top before baking. I used the entire bottle of champagne, at the time I thought it was too much, but it was just right - had plenty of drippings to make the gravy. I did add a bouillon cube to the gravy to counter some of the sweetness from the champagne. Also following some suggestions from other reviews I added a cut up red onion to the inside and an extra apple (mine was a 20lb turkey). After about 2 hours in the oven I cut up the top of the bag so the skin would get nice and crispy. It took about 3 hours to cook and after letting it rest for about 30 minutes the meat was falling off the bones. I'll definitely be making this again for Christmas.

The turkey was very moist and tasty. Be sure to use dry champagne or if you want to use the juice for gravy it'll taste really sweet.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it was just fabulous!! I could not get over how moist the turkey was!!  You have to like champagne(and I do like it)because you can really taste it. I will keep this recipe for future turkey's!

I have cooked this turkey for the last 5 years! Have always cut up onion and added with apple.  We also usually do a 20lb turkey so double the recipe.  Be generous with the garlic powder and use whole bottle of champagne for bigger turkey. And yes, cut a few slits in the bag. 2 or 3 are enough.  Enjoy!

Excellent recipe! The turkey turned out very moist. I used a Brut champagne, which complimented the apple flavor. Do NOT cut slits in the bag. This will cause the turkey to dry out. You want to seal in all of the moisture. Spiced apple rings compliment served with this dish compliment it nicely.

I cooked for 12 people for an early Thanksgiving.  I used this recipe but had a 20 lb. turkey.  I doubled the apples but the rest was the same.  I let it sit on the warm stove top in the bag for at least an hour to reabsorb juices.  This turned out excellent and so juicy.  My brother-in-law, an avid chef took home the recipe to make for Thanksgiving day.  Everyone loved this!!  I will always make my turkey this way.  Just make sure you give your turkey time to rest in the bag before cutting.  Also, turkey baked in cooking bags tends to cook much faster.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the directions to the letter and it was awesome! We served this on Christmas Eve and everyone commented on the great taste. You can not taste the champagne at all, which I was concerned about. So easy, it just didn't seem right! (Be sure to coat your oven bag in flour first.)

This was my first Thanksgiving to cook.  The turkey was good, not just good but Gooood.  The only problem was the turkey burst down the middle.  I might have used a little too much champagne.  And when my husband picked it up from the pan the wings fell completely off.  Everything might have not turned out exactly like it should have but it was STILL DELICIOUS!!!!!

Funniest thing, when it came time to eat, my daughter (who was 2 or 3 at the time) just sat there sucking on the meat.  Next thing you know she falls over asleep.  

This is now known as the Drunken Turkey in our house.

This is always the way we made turkey for Thanksgiving. It always makes for a juicy bird. One thing that I have seen in the comments that needs to be addressed is that there are different cooking times for different size birds.....use the cooking times on the cooking bag that you purchased and not cook a small 12 pound bird for 3+ hours. So yes, this recipe uses a cooking bag you will find at the store alongside the ziplok bags and aluminum foil. Yes, you do put flour in the bag to keep it from bursting and yes you do cut slits in the bag before you put the bag in the oven. Other tips are:don't let the bag touch any of the walls of the oven and let the bird sit for a little while after you take it out of the oven, this will ensure the meat is moist all the way thru the bird.

Had a 15 lb turkey, cooked according to directions on turkey.  Used ginger ale instead of champagne, I cut some slits in the bag, and it turned out wonderful, everyone loved how moist it was.  Be careful not to tear the skin when you're putting in the butter pats, I did and that very small part that was exposed turned out to be dry.  Everyone loved the stuffing and couldn't get enough, and the gravy that was made was great too.  Def. going to use the recipe again.  Thanks.

This recipe was ok.  I had an 11.8 lb turkey and I only needed to cook it for about 2 hours.  I even turned down the oven to 325.  I ended up leaving it in for a bout 2.5 hours, so I think it over cooked a bit, which may have been why mine wasn't as juicy as others mentioned.  Overall it was good, and the champagne and drippings made a good gravy, but I couldn't give this one 5 stars because the flavor was about average and the cooking time was too high and long.

I make this turkey, following the recipe, every year for Thanksgiving and it is a huge hit with my family.  Everything turns out moist and delicious! Also I recommend the recipe to beginner cooks because I am not very skilled but was able to pull this recipe off.

i altered this a bit, didn't cook in a bag and used white wine instead. THE KEY TO A SUPER GOOD TURKEY IS TO PUT IT BREAST SIDE DOWN IN YOUR ROASTER PAN! mine was so juicy we had to pick it apart, the knife wouldn't slice it. the gravy was super good too.

This is truly the Worlds BEST Turkey I have ever eaten. My family and friends loved it; they still talk about it. You will not believe how tender and juicy it turns out. I used Granny Smith apples and Martini & Rossi Asti. It was Fabulous. This is the easiest recipe ever. You have GOT to try this turkey.

to start out it was very delicious.  i wish there would have been more specific details though.  like pour champagne under the skin also.  i didnt do that,  i poured it over. so i think it would have been even better.  also specify what kind of champange to use,  since im not a regular user to know which is the best.  i think if i would have known which brand to use that i would have rated a 5 instead of 4.  oven bags are so easy and awesome to use,  thanks for the idea,  and thanks for the recipe.  i will make it again

Great recipe!  To those who ask about cutting the slits in the bag and the flour in the bag; though I did this with this recipe because I always do when using the turkey bags or oven cooking bags, my husband never does this (he does not believe in reading the directions)!  Anyway, it has always been alright without.  Unlike the person who said it would cause the bag to blow up and the gas to be blown out in your oven, this has NEVER happened in the very many times he has done this (and I do have a gas oven)!  The only way that would happen is if you could somehow seal the bag air-tight, and the ties for these bags will not do that!

Like everyone else I'd give high marks for juiciness and flavor. HOWEVER, I took my 12 lb. bird out after only 2:45 mins at 350 (my oven temp is accuarte) and the meat was actually pulling back from the leg bones. I should also say that I had my turkey sitting on the kitchen counter for 2 hours before I started cooking it. If I would have left in for 3 1/2 hours I would have had saw dust. Also, looks-wise, this bird is only average.

Great recipe just as written, I really am not a big turkey fan, and this certainly changed my mind after almost 60 years. I did brine the turkey first for 4 hours and washed it thoughly of the brine solution and dried it well, only eliminated the apple and used a bottle of Asti Spumante instead of champagne. Had an antique covered roasting pan,though I wish I had a cooking bag and it came out perfect. It was a 12 lb. bird and was fall off the bone in under 2 hours. Will stick with this recipe forever! Thanks so much.

All my adult life I've never made a turkey because of pure intimidation.  But last year, I made this recipe the Friday after Thanksgiving (when the stores were practically giving the Turkeys away).  I found my recipe!  The turkey came out so good and with so little preparation!

Interesting and did make a moist turkey.  Not sure what to think of the flavor, especially of gravy made from the broth.  Might use dry wine next time.  I also added 5-6 cloves fresh garlic (minced).  But, overall, a fair recipe.

This turkey turned out extremely well.  I did a few things differently however.  I added some poultry spice, garlic powder, and parsley to the butter that I put under and on the skin.  I added red onions to the apples, (as suggested by a few others), I brined the turkey for about 12 hours, and I took it out of the bag for the last hour or so to get a better browning of the skin.  The gravy I made from the drippings had a little kick to it, (from the champagne I think) but was the best gravy I've ever made for a turkey.

If you follow the bag instructions you should have no problem.  Also, I usually oil the skin of the turkey and always have a beautifully browned bird everytime.  I never take it out of the bag until it's done.  Also, to get all of the juice out... have a strong person  hold the bag by the tied end over the baking pan, snip one corner and the juice pours out easily.  Then make your gravy either in the roasting pan or transfer to a pot to do it.  I have used cooking bags for turkeys for years without one mishap. I always stuff mine using half purchased herbed cubes and my own cube dry bread, fresh sage and  cubed apples, chopped celery, chicken broth and an egg or two to bind it.  If you follow the bag instructions for a stuffed bird the dressing will always be piping hot.  I make enough to have extra for a casserole.  Also, I have found these great cheese cloth bags at at the dollar store.  The stuffing pulls right out.  Love it!

I have made this turkey every year, for the last 5 years. It always comes out super moist, and delicious! To church it up a bit I like to stuff it with apples, and adouille sausage.

Made this Turkey for a neighborhood pot luck for the first time, and it turned out so good, that people from other potlucks heard about it and joined ours to get some of that Turkey. Very moist.

I do about the same thing except I roast my turkey upside down {it makes the breast very juicy} & add an orange to the cavity.  I also use regular white wine...makes delicious gravy!!!

This turkey was the best I've ever made or tasted!  All my relatives raved about it.  I cooked a 22-lb turkey in a cooking bag on a rack in my electric roaster to free up my oven for side dishes, and it took 4 hours at 325 degrees.  (I had intended to cook it longer at a lower temp, but my alarm didn't go off!)  I used the butter as suggested (used a whole stick in patties under the skin since it was such a large bird), and sprinkled on some Lowery's seasoning salt.  I also omitted the champagne and put 2 C chicken broth in the bottom of the bag instead.  Couldn't taste any apple flavor from the apples inside, but maybe they helped keep it moist.  Roasting it upside down is the key!!  Thanks for the tip!  The leftover breast meat on sandwiches the next day just melted in your mouth!  Not a tad dry!  This is my new turkey recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to follow with great results. I used gala apples and Andre Cold Duck champagne for the recipe. It was so much quicker and easier than I expected and next time I wont be afraid to cook a turkey. And I cooked it at 325 for 4 hours for a 15 lb bird. Another time I used Andre Brut Champagne and it was a sweet and good flavor.

This is the best turkey my husband ever ate! I didn't put foil on top and it got brown very quickly. So I added the foil at about 30 minutes into cooking and didn't need to take it off at all the rest of the time. Keep in mind that there is  a lot of liquid and if you don't have a large enough roasting pan, the champagne will spill out over the sides (in the bag of course). Next time I am going to try it upside down.

This is my new turkey recipe! So moist, so easy, and the soup I made the next day (boiling down the bones, adding the juices from the roasting pan) was the best I ever tasted. Everyone agreed. Thank you!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year instead of deep frying and I think this will be a recipe I will use over and over.  I am sure that I put too much Champagne in it, but it was fantastic. Texture was great and the meat just feel apart and was so moist.  Will probably make again for Christmas!

My first time cooking a turkey and i came out great! Loved this recipe! I did a few things differently though. I put bacon on top of the turkey as well as inside the turkey. I also put sweet onion and cloves of garlic inside as well! Came out great! my family was impressed. I also used a brut champagne and i used more butter and garlic than suggested because i like more. :)

We found this turkey bland and a huge disappointment. I did use inexpensive champagne so perhaps it was my fault but I would not make this again.

It was my 3rd time ever cooking a turkey and it was the best turkey I've ever had. So moist and flavorful. It was a hit!  I modified the recipe a bit though by omitting the bag and instead creating a loose aluminum tent. I also basted it every hour or so in its own juices. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I've made this turkey a few times now.  Using a different size turkey each time.  I do add extra everything basically.  I really like to taste the seasoning.  But, I think overall this recipe is great, and really adds a different spin to turkey.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Only changes I made was using Sparkling Apple Cider and put yellow onion and bell pepper in the cavity instead of apples. It was incredible. My mom-in-law said in 60 years she had never seen turkey fall off the bone. It was very moist and tasty. This will be our turkey recipe forever!

I think this was a awful recipe however the technique is wonderful. I have been using cooking bags for years for turkey, roasts and ham. It makes the turkey very moist and great gravy. The gravy in this recipe was a bit acidy from the champagne.So give a cooking bag a try but add spices that you like.

I've made this turkey for the last 2 years (for about 8 people), and it's turned out to be fantastic each time. the meat is so moist it practically falls off the bird. This year I added a handful of fresh, chopped rosemary inside and outside of the bird, which made it wonderfully fragrant.

This was my first attempt at a turkey.  It was simple to make and the white meat was so moist you would have thought it was dark meat.  we cooked it at 500 for the first half hour and used foil to cover it instead of an oven bag.  the last half hour we let it brown without the foil on it.  It was a big success and the apples tasted great.

This is the best recipe for Turkey that I have tried. Have used it since 2003. I use granny smith apples and sweet onions, have used champagne but also like to use sparkling apple cider instead. I season with the garlic salt or seasoned salt. I also think it is important to use the right turkey. I have tried numerous brands but find the best to be a Young and Tender turkey. If from the midwest, I suggest a HyVee brand turkey.

Really yummy, excellent turkey!  Moist and flavorful! The only complaint I had was that a couple of my less adventurous relatives (lil brother and his wife) could taste the champagne in the gravy (made from pan juices) and didn't care for the gravy as  much. But it really was one of the tastiest turkeys we ever had!

This turkey came out very moist and flavorful. I added a few cloves of garlic, rosemary, tarragon, and sage to the cavity, and also added sliced onion and celery to the bag.  The drippings made great gravy, and cleanup was so easy from cooking the turkey in the bag. To answer other questions about this recipe, I cut slits in the bag just as instructed on the box, and it came out perfectly.

To make a moist Turkey place the butter under the breast skin, cover with bacon rashers and put either apples or onions in the cavity. This is a waste of champagne I think? 

Yes folks you DO need to slit the bags so the air can escape otherwise it'll blow up and go bang in the oven and if you use gas it will blow the flames out and gas the occupants of the house or even worse blow it up!

fantastic!  the only MINOR thing I added was I  squeezed two lemons over it, and put them in the cavity along with the apples.  I will never make turkey without a bag again!!

This IS THE WORLD"S BEST TURKEY! I made a different more complicated recipe last year that also included champagne, but it did not even compare to the juiciness and deliciousness of this turkey. Even the leftovers reheated in the microwave were moist! In answer to Andy's question, I did slit holes in the cooking bag per the directions on the box. Perfection!

Scaled it for a 20lb turkey and it was good. The gravy was outstanding. It did cook quicker in the bag with slits.(only 4 hours and it was already done at meat temp @200.) A little over done but what a great 1st try. Did cook it breast side down too.

First time I tried this, I cooked it wayyy to long. I did a 20lb turkey for 4hrs. The second time I did the correct cooking time and the turkey ended up being so moist and delicious. I got rave reviews for my Christmas Dinner. Will use this recipe for years to come...

I gave this recipe a three star rating because I am unsure how it would have turned out if things would have worked out right.  I had over a 20 lb turkey and so I thought I would need to double the time (from 3 hours to 6).  Well, it was cooked in 3 hours, which was three hours earlier than I had planned.  I might try this again for Christmas unless I decide to cook duck instead!  :)  It sure sounded like it would have been great...

I've made this two years in a row now and it always comes out great, follow the instructions for the turkey bag, so you cut slits in it, but every time i've also cut the bag open before it was done so that the skins could get crispy. to keep the turkey from sticking to the bag, put some butter on the breast where the bag would touch. Last year I added some onions to the cavity because they can get sweet as well... amazing both ways!! This will be my 3rd year making this and my first year hosting. Can't wait for everyone to dive into this turkey!!

I have made this turkey 2 years in a row and I LOVE it!! My family requested this turkey in advance and they were not disappointed.  The only thing I change is that I add the entire bottle of champagne for added moisture.  It is delicious!

I made this for Chrismtas Dinner for my family Christmas Evening. It was nice an moist, but don't look to use this as a bird you can place on the table to carve. It was so moist it fell apart when I tried to turn it over in the roasting pan. I also think that it needed less champange as my turkey meat tasted alot of champange. I assumed that the flavor would "cook out" of the actual meat, but indeed it had a champagne flavor. Also, the giblet gravy made with the drippings tasted of the champagne, so, it was good, moist, but different in taste than I was accustomed to.

This is an excellent recipe! Considering all the other dishes you have to get together for Thanksgiving, it's so nice to have the main dish in the oven in about 10 minutes and not have to mess with it until it's time  to take it out of the oven. Besides all the ease in preparing it, it's great tasting. To everyone wondering if you need to cut slits in the cooking bag, absolutely! Thank you Sara!

I have made this turkey for three years (this will be my fourth).  It always falls off the bone.  I don't really ever have to "carve" it.  I never liked turkey.  I like this turkey.  With this recipe I discovered turkey doesn't have to be dry!

I used this recipe to make my "first" Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out EXCELLENT.  My entire family was raving about how good it was, how juicy, etc.  Everything turned out so well, including the gravy, and for the first time ever, my little sister actually didn't complain about the turkey!!

Wow!  Thanks for a great recipe Sarah!  This was my very first "Christmas Turkey"...it looked like I had made many-it was perfect!  My turkey didn't brown enough in the bag so I took it out for the last 15 minutes (it made A TON of gravy!)

Didn't care for this. The turkey had a "boiled" flavor - not roasted.  It was very moist but not flavorful.  I did not taste the champagne. I even added a lot of herbs and spices which seemed to be boiled away. Definitely NOT the World's Best Turkey in my opinion. Thanks anyway.

Have been cooking turkey this way for years, just use different seasonings, only time I have had a bad one is once I forgot to switch from broil to bake, needless to say the turkey was a little crispy.
Besides the apples inside I quarter an onion and another apple and just throw in the bag around the outside of the turkey. I am going to try adding the champagne this time, it sounds like a great addition but you can't go wrong fixing a turkey this way. Don't forget to flour the bag and even with the champagne I would cut the slits.

I followed the recipe to the T (except added some herbs for flavor) and would have to say that this turkey came out ok. It is good if you are used to dry turkey at Thanksgiving (who hasn't experienced a few too many of those?) but was not the best turkey I've had. The parts of the bird that weren't submerged in champagne/juices actually turned out pretty dry (did 3.5hrs for 12.5lbs of bird) but the parts that were submerged were pretty juicy. If I didn't add some herbs I think I would have thought it was bland, as some others have mentioned. Overall this was a decent recipe, but not "the one" I want to use to wow family in November. I'll keep hunting though!

Fantastic! I have made this recipie several times, and referred it to everyone I know. I will never cook a turkey any other way!  To answer the question about cutting slits in the baking bag: I cut slits in my bag every time.

Absolutely wonderful.  My only comment is that to watch out if you're using a bigger turkey, as you'll need more champagne.  The first time I made this recipe I neglected to adjust; guess I was looking forward to having the rest of the bottle for myself!  Remembering to adjust amount needed made a HUGE difference in the moisture.  Phenomenal.

followed recipe for our 13 lb Xmas dinner bird.. a hint of boiled chicken more than Turkey was the outcome. will stick to the roasted method [ no bag] next time and save the Champagne for consumption with the bird .. It cooked much faster than recipe indicated 2hrs
so as suggested in other reviews 275degrees would be a better choice perhaps . Gravy was Ok but no one raved about it .. Will not repeat this one

My husband and I do not drink so when I saw "champagne", I was a little hesitant to try this recipe. This was only my second time to ever prepare a Thanksgiving turkey on my own. I couldn't be more happy that I tried this recipe. Since I only have two of us to cook for, I had to alter the recipe just a teeny. We used a 7lb bone-in turkey breast, and a whole onion (I didn't have any apples)-other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. This is by far the way to go when preparing a turkey. You just put everything in the roasting bag, put it all in the oven, and walk away. The turkey was falling off the bone and was the juiciest turkey breast we have ever had. Don't worry if you are not a champagne aficionado. The meat does not retain any of the true champagne flavor and the drippings make a fantastic gravy! The gravy is hearty and full of flavor and has an added tang that is unexpectedly good. I will no longer go to the trouble of preparing turkey in the traditional manner. This recipe is an absolute keeper!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I had never cooked a turkey in my life and chose this recipe for last Thanksgiving.  It was delicious!  Very very juicy and flavorful.  For Christmas I tried a different recipe and regretted it after the first bit.  This holiday season, I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I had 12 guests over for Thanksgiving two years ago and used this recipe.  Everyone loved it and now for every family function where turkey is served I am required to make this.  One thing i do differently is put stuffing inside the turkey instead of the apple.  The champagne doesn't alter the stuffing flavor at all.  The turkey does take a little bit longer to cook.

This was the first turkey I ever made and it was great. I will follow the suggestions next time to cut the bag for the last 20 minutes or so. The turkey was so moist that we couldn't cut it!

Hands down, the best turkey ever.  I recommend opening the bag around the last 30 minutes of cooking for nice browning and to avoid the bird from getting to mushy.  Also, a meat thermometer to get that 170 degrees right on the head!!

First Thanksgiving cooking for my inlaws. This recipe was absolutley perfect. Moist, tender, perfectly browned. Just perfect.
The only variable I made was to drop the temp to 325 @ 15 mins per pound. I couldnt have asked for a better recipe.

I haven't used this recipe, but I do think if you don't puts slits in the cooking bag, you could probably expect some sort of Thanksgiving explosion in your oven. I would follow the instructions on the box of bags regarding slits.

I just used this recipe for my first turkey, and got rave reviews from everyone.  It was so juicy and tender, and the champagne made a wonderful gravy.  I cooked mine in a Nesco roaster, breast down, and added portabello mushrooms to the juice to use for the gravy - I think I have my new Thanksgiving tradition. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

I made this Turkey for Thanksgiving last year.  It come out wonderful!  The only thing I was not fond of was the flavor of the gravy.  The Champagne did make the gravey to sweet.  I even used a dry champagne.  All in all it was a great recipe, if you don't use gravy  :)  Thanks

WOW!!!  This was my first attempt at a turkey and it turned out wonderfully...my husband is not a fan of turkey...but he could not stop raving about this.  The white meat was so moist it just fell apart.  Gravy was also really good.

I thought this recipe was great! It was my first turkey ever and I was cooking for a crowd, and my turkey was super-moist and very good! Cooking in the roasting bag does make the turkey cook a little faster; I had a 23 lb turkey and at 350 F it was done in about 4-4.5 hours. I will definitely use this for years to come! The champagne did give it a nice flavor and made the meat moist and tender, too. Thank you!

I did not like to cook whole turkeys, but for Thanksgiving 2004 I tried the Worlds Best Turkey recipe and it was the best turkey I've every had. Family members were calling the next day for more. I did not have any left for turkey salad or turkey soup.

This was my wifes and mine first thanksgiving turkey that we made ourselves since I am stationed in Korea.  We have a few friends over and it was awesome.  We did not have to carve the turkey just poked it with a fork and it fell apart.  Here it is Christmas day and we are making it again.  simply great.

I wonder if I didn't do something right, because this turkey was dry and flavorless.  Maybe I should have cooked the turkey upside down, I don't know, but the white meat was dryyyy.  The dark meat's pretty good, hence the extra star in the review.

I have used this recipe for the past two thanksgivings and I have been so pleased with both birds! The first year we made the mistake of roasting the turkey upside down in the bag, but it worked out really well because the juices at the bottom penetrated the breast so we had the most tender white meat I've ever tasted. We did it again last year we liked it so much!

The one thing I wish the other reviewers would have mentioned is that the cooking time on this recipe is for a larger bird.  

This was my first ever turkey!  The taste is great and the meat is tender and flaky.  I was only confused by the 3-3.5 hr cook time, which conflicted w/the bag instructions of 1.5-2 hrs, in a 350 oven, for my 12lb bird and I cooked for 2.5 hours.  Which, as it turned out, was about .5 hrs too many!  It dried it out just a smidge.  
I'll absolutely use this recipe again, just cook it for only 2 hrs!

I took the risk and it paid off!!!  EVERYONE loved this turkey! I generally slow cook my turkey all nite, but this method was much faster and the turkey was VERY flavorful and tender!  For a bit extra tendercy, try cooking a bit slower at about 250-275 degrees for an extra hour and a half or until golden brown.  Also made great gravy!  Two of my finicky guest already asked me to give them the recipe.  WOW!

Had a 16 lb turkey, baked it for 3 hours, and it was overcooked. Never had turkey that dry before. Temperature is too high, turkey should not be cooked at 350 F for that long in my opinion. It would probably have been done in 2 hours. Wish instructions would have been better, temperature lower, and suggested to start checking after 2 hours. Will never make again...also...the champagne really watered down the drippings, which turned out not to be very flavorful for the gravy at all. Don't understand why this one got such great reviews.

This recipe was great! I was concerned using champagne with kids eating it that the taste of the champagne would come through to much. But to my delight it didn't. I used Asti which is sweeter and paired nicely with the apples. It also made an amazing gravy to go with the turkey. If you are looking for an easy amazing turkey recipe you have just found it.

I have to agree with the name...  I tried this this year and was it ever a hit.  The champagne DID make it sooo moist.  I put 1/4 apple in each cavity, then stuffed with the cranberry/apple stuffing you will find on this website (minus the sausage-I think it competes with the turkey) another hit!  The champagne addition made the best gravy we have EVER had for Thanksgiving.  It was so rich, and the champagne gave it a gourmet taste.  This has just become our Thanksgiving staple.

AMAZING!!! I've made this quite a few times and it always turns out wonderful! I only added a few things: I am not a fan of powdered anything so I used real garlic (and herbs) and mixed it in the butter that I spread under and ontop of the skin. I also mixed the apples with a somehwhat traditional sausage stuffing (made bread crumbs from italian herbed bread). Sweet and delicious gravy with the drippings!!!

I made this turkey for new years, and was very excited based on the reviews..but I have to say I was disappointed with the flavor,  I found it quite taste less.. a little garlicky but thats it.  It did remind me a litle of boiled chicken.  It was faily moist, and did fall off the bones, but I think I prefer more herbs.  Will not make again, although I did enjoy the extra champagne

I never made a turkey before and it came out perfect! - moist, golden and yummy!  Oh, and I did cut slits in the bag as directed on the package.  It didn't hurt anything.  For all of those people who can't cook (like me) this crazy easy!  The hardest part was touching a raw turkey!

Great unique recipe.  I also added onion and celery to the "oven bag".  The turkey was very good, and the broth was fantastic!  I saved the juice, skimmed off all of the fat, and strained out the apples/onion/celery and made a fantastic pot of turkey noodle soup, using a home made egg noodle recipe from this site.  I will be using this recipe again. Thanks!

This recipe makes a fantastic turkey!  I happen to work for a restaurant company and was blessed enough to have one of our chefs help me through the turkey baking process.  We baked a pre-bird to test the recipe (this was my first time cooking turkey).  We followed the recipe making only a few modifications as suggested by some of the reviewers (white wine instead of champagne, adding a red onion, etc.).  Not only was it easy, it was absolutely delicious!  I've never had a juicier bird.  I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year and look forward to showing my family what a turkey SHOULD taste like!

I didn't end up with an out of this world turkey with this recipe...although I DID end up drunk  :)    

The turkey was good but nothing as amazing as I had expected.

I  DID put slits in the bag as directed on box - GOOD.  And the turkey DID brown more than I had expected using the bad - GOOD.

but...overall, save your champagne for yourself, not some big bird.

I have used this recipe three times now. My step mom has used it, after I told her about it. It is by far the easiest, tastiest, turkey you can make. I like the champagne gravy that it creates in the oven. A definite choice for the novice turkey chef

The apples and champagne didn't really make a difference in the taste of the turkey, and it was't very moist.

Some people asked about poking holes in the bag. I have never done it this way; it seems to me that a lot of the steaming/poaching would be lost and thus, moisture as well. It looks in the oven like the bag is going to explode; it puffs up enormously! But it's never exploded in our kitchen and the turkey comes out moist and tasty :) HTH

This turkey got RAVE reviews at our house!! I used non-alcoholic sparkling cider.... it was expensive, but made all the difference. The butter under the skin also makes it excellent. I'm not normally a huge Turkey dinner fan, but this was fabulous. And the gravy was just sweet enough. Really different, but good!

I made this for thanksgiving. The turkey tasted good, I might even make it again. The apples inside the turkey lose all their sugar after cooking, and get soft. The oven bag makes it so you can't baste the turkey, but like I said, it still turned out good.

I only cook 1/2 of a turkey so used 1 apple and 1/2 bottle champagne. I put the champagne in the bag before adding the garlic powder & salt & pepper. It was done in 2-1/4 hrs (9 lb. turkey) and was falling off the bone. It was moist and tender. The juice made great gravy, too! For a simple and easy variation of the standard turkey, this is very good!

I used (and modified) this recipe for my first turkey EVER for more than 32 people in my boyfriends family, and it came out PERFECT. I used sparkling cider instead of champagne, used 2 apples and one lemon. The lemon flavor infused the whole bird!

Definitely, the turkey was very delicious. It had a piquant taste. Quite unusual, but I was pleased. However, the turkey came a little dry.  Probably the recipe requires some water adding while cooking.

This was the first turkey I had ever made it and came out PERFECT!  My fiance is still talking about how tender and flavorful it was!  I did let it cook a little longer though, more like 4 hours.  Definitely will make this again!   Thanks for sharing it!

This turkey is delicious!! I've made it for the last three thanksgivings, and it's the only turkey that will be eaten all before people are tried of thanksgiving leftovers.. I put it in the roasting bag with seasonings and champagne overnight, i think it makes it even more tender..the apples are good too..

Thank You so much for this recipe. This was my first turkey and my hubby was sure I would mess it up and it would be too dry.  I found this recipe and it sounded relatively easy so I decided to try it.  It turned out wonderful, and my hubby is still raving about it.  He said it was one of the best turkeys he's ever tasted.  Thank you, thanky you.  I will be using this again next year.

This turkey was delicious! It was quick, easy and great for those who prefer to make their stuffing on the stove top.  For an alternative to this, incorporating stuffing, see my Juicy Turkey Recipe.

I have made this the last 3 years. I always stuff it with my stuffing instead of apples.  This year I did it upside down-18lb turkey in 3-1/2 hours-it was the best turkey ever-I cheat with my gravy-I use all of the juices bring to a boil and mix 2 packages of country gravy mix with about 2 cups of milk-whisk that in - the best!!! Love this recipe will never cook a turkey any other way.

This recipe sounded strange but I thought I would try it. It was terrific! I didn't make gravy from the drippings but there were plenty to do so. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I let our bird cook for the full 3 1/2 hours and it was falling off the bone.  It was beautiful, moist and tastey.  I will make it again for sure.

My 23 lb. turkey was a hit!  Moist, tender and with an incredible hint of sweetness from the apple.  The combination of champagne and apples made a delicious gravy too.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe. It was the saving grace of dinner! Kids were fighting over the last pieces. I made it with Pinot Grigio as opposed to champagne. It was so easy I felt like I'd missed something somewhere.  I only wish I'd had a bigger turkey!

The Best turkey I have ever made. Was moist and juicy, falling off the bone tender. Yes you do want to flour your bag and cut small slits in the bag for venting.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of rubbing some butter on the outside of the turkey also and giving it a little extra love, since I had butter on my hands anyway. I also opened bag and started basting about 3/4 of the way thru.  This recipe did cook the bird a little  faster than expected, so check early and have your meat thermometer handy.  Our 13 lb bird cooked beautifully  in just under 3 hours.

For 5+ years, I've used this fool-proof recipe, TRULY AMAZING!

Notes: S&P inside cavity and outside, butter between the skin, using spatula to loosen skin.

Butter: I used Land O Lakes garlic butter if I don't have time to chop garlic or fresh herbs are too expensive.

ADD ONS: added red onion & fresh thyme.

Champagne: blanc de blanc from Trader Joe's

Apple: Fiji apples, Crispin apples

Oven bag: Don't forget to add flour (in past I didn't have any, so I've also used pancake mix as stand in & it was fine). Also, I am in the cut-slits in the bag camp before roasting.

Cooking time: general rule of thumb I use is 10-min/lb at 375F. I had 22 lb turkey, cooked in 3-hrs plus 10-min of basting & 20-min rest.

Crispy Skin: last 30 min, I remove the plastic and baste, baste, baste with melted butter (or flavored butter). Do NOT leave it alone or it will burn.

Gravy: Use Tony Chachere Creole gravy with the drippings. I mixed it with some turkey stock. F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S!

I made this a couple of years ago --OMG it was amazing!! Meat just fell off the bone, it tasted incredible! Note--definitely use a deep pan when roasting!! Not only do you have the liquid of the champagne but also the juice of the turkey.

Made it thanksgiving dinner, amazing!! Did a few modifications-used sparkling cider, also injected butter into thighs and front in addition to what we stuffed it with.  We also did an Italian seasoning brine first.  Last, we used an electric roaster oven and it only too 2.5 hours on 350.  We also stuffed the inside with a bunch of fresh herbs for flavor.

My first time cooking a turkey for christmas and it turned out great. I used sparking cider instead of wine and injected the trukey with butter and garlic marinate everything i did the same cooking time was a little less, but I only had a 12 lb turkey, my family loved it, the turkey was really tender, and moist, and seasoned thur out. My niece told me "you put your foot in that turkey". will make again.

I've made this twice. The first time was when my entire family was coming in for Thanksgiving and I was in charge of dinner. I'd NEVER made a turkey before and I was worried because who hasn't choked down a dry turkey all the while smiling at the cook and pretending it tasted good? Both times were perfect. Juicy and yummy. Everyone raved. Definitely recommend.

I will never make turkey any other way, and that includes the deep fryer sitting outside. This was the most tender, juiciest turkey I have ever made. My daughter said, "You know I don't really like turkey but this is so good!". My son said, "This turkey isn't dry at all!!!!".  My son mentioned it again the next day while making his sandwich with leftovers. I've worked for decades to make a juicy turkey. This is it. I did not waver from the instructions other than I had to cut up the apples some to fit in the cavity. I used the cheapest champagne I could find on the shelves. I did NOT cut slits in the bag as the recipe didn't say to do so. It was fine. Thank you thank you thank you thank you.

This was the best turkey I have made in years, and the simplest.  What normaly takes me a couple of hours between making the stuffing and then stuffing the bird was cut down to 30 min.  Left me with plenty of time to spend with family and not locked in the kitchen for the day.

I made this a few years ago.  It was my first turkey, ever.  I was so nervous as I was only 21 and was making it for my fiance and his family.  It was such a simple easy recipe and I have never had a better turkey.  I had to cook it longer than I estimated, but that was my own calculation problem.  I haven't made the Thanksgiving turkey since, but this year I will be making it again for Christmas and I can finally show my side of the family this amazing turkey.  The White Meat really is as moist as the Dark meat.  It is incredible!

This recipe is A+++++MAZING! I stumbled upon it 4 years ago when I was attempting my first Thanksgiving with my Fiancee and boy is he glad I did! I have made this each and every year since and now we're celebrating our first Thanksgiving as Husband and Wife!

Made this for an intimate gathering of friends. Turkey was super moist (I may have used more champagne than was called for) but the flavor of the bird was nice as well. The white meat was so moist I would even eat it (I'm a dark meat lover). Served it with Harvest Rice Dish (also on the site) and soaked the cranberries in champagne as well. The dishes paired nicely.

I used this with two roaster chickens after new years celebration with the left over champagne.  This was a meal we were able to used left overs for a week!  Good recipe but may have been too greasy for chicken.  I do want to make this again but with turkey next time.

Absolutely the best turkey ever.  I had reservations about the flavor of the "drippings" for gravy.  I added a bit of chicken bullion as I had a 7 pounder and 2/3 bottle champagne was to much liquid for so little drippings.

This turkey was the most moist turkey I have ever had. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did cut slits in my bag per the instructions on the oven bag. I also added some onions to go alongside the apples stuffed inside.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving this year and my husband took one bite and said it was the best turkey he's ever had in his life!  It was so moist and juicy, it just fell off the bone.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely be using this again next year.

I used this recipe the first time I ever cooked a turkey. It is unbelievably juicy and I now use it every year. I also inject my turkey with garlic infused olive oil and this also does WONDERS, but the champagne just gives it a rich flavor.

For those of you who have asked, DO NOT CUT THE BAG!!!!!!! I do open the bag about every 45 minutes and baste the turkey (and to avoid the top from sticking to the bag). I also open it to use the turkey juices to make my stuffing and gravy. I also will brown/roast the top by opening the bag/uncovering the top of the turkey when it's almost done. If that doesn't work, then cut it open so you expose the breasts (that sounds so wrong, lol!) to get a perfectly browned turkey, but only do that at the very end, towards the last 15 minutes. 

Anyway, this is an awesome recipe - please try it!

This was my first time in charge of making the turkey and it came out perfectly.  I kept the turkey in the oven for about 3 hours. Might limit that to 2 hrs and 45 min. next time.  Very easy and the turkey was very juicy!! Rave reviews!

I have never roasted a turkey in my life, and when I saw this recipe, I felt the courage to do so... 
I'm glad I did because my family raved all about it! 
I used sparkling cider like the other reviewers did, and added quartered onion to the quartered apples for stuffing. 
I gave it 4 instead of 5 because the bag started to stick on the skin after 3 hours.  Was it suppose to be at 350degrees?  I opened the bag up, thinking that if I didn't do it, we would end up with a plastic/skinned turkey!  
I also rubbed sage, marjoram, salt and pepper all over the turkey.  Delish! Thank you for this great recipe!
I will make it again next year - this time, with real champagne!

I had high hopes for this after all the wonderful reviews, however we thought it was your average turkey...  It wasn't as moist as we expected.  We watched carefully for doneness, so I know it wasn't overcooked.  But, within 5-10 minutes of seeing it was underdone, the turkey seemed to implode on itself.  Very odd indeed.  I won't do this one again.  I did inject the turkey prior to cooking with broth, garlic, and spices - that was yummy even though the meat was dry.

You can't beet this one for a first time recipe! We couldn't "carve" the turkey, as it just fell of  the bone. I used a white Zinfandel and the light fruity flavor made for fantastic gravy. I would recommend this one no mater how novice or expert of a cook you are.

This recipe did not work for me! Granted, this was easy to do but it didn't brown correctly in the bag. It produced so much juice that the turkey starts boiling instead of roasting. I had to cut open the bag and siphon the juice out. I then had to get my 2-toned turked to even out. I won't be doing it this way again.

I was very surprised at the taste of the turkey.  The beast meat was juicy and very tasty.  Although, the champagne was a little strong – it gave the bird a great flavor.  I would most certainly use this recipe again.

This was the very first whole turkey I ever cooked and for Thanksgiving at that for the whole family(s) and friends. I used a 19 lbs bird and added mushrooms, sage, rosemarry, and thyme. Plus I basted it throught the cooking process after 2.5 hours. It turned out the best !!!!!!

This turkey was absolutely the best I have ever made or tasted!  So easy to do, cooked in less time than usual and very little mess with the oven bag.  I will always make this turkey when I cook Thanksgiving dinner again.

Very moist and tender.  With a little tweaking this may very well be the world's best turkey.  My family enjoyed it for Thanksgiving Day.

Absolutely delicious! Follow the recipe as written. I have made this for 20 years now and it is always a hit. I use a good brut champagne. I used a cheap purple champagne one year and the turkey was purple and horrible so use a good champagne.

A totally yummy recipe even though I overcooked the turkey--make sure you check the bird before the time in the recipe to avoid overcooking!

Tried this turkey last Thanksgiving and decided not to do it again this year.  It was ok.  I think the "ooh" factor was better than the actual taste of the turkey.  And I couldn't make tasty gravy with the drippings.

It was great as my first turkey. Except the oven bag stuck to breast when I took it out so no skin. Bummer, because skin is the best part of the turkey.

I made this recipe for a party of 18 people last year and I was very nervous given that I am by far not a natural in the kitchen and I was cooking for a few true chefs.  To my amazement - it was the "World's Best Turkey" anyone had tasted.  I would recommended a few minutes longer on the browning time though.

Uncoventional - but turned out excellent!  My whole family enjoyed, but a couple complained about the gravy not tasting "traditional".  I thought the gravy tasted better!

I had used this recipe last year for a rib in turkey breast along with my ham and it was a big hit!  Yummmm!  I did it again this year with a 12 lbs. turkey!  Yummmm once again!  My family, including my parents who joined us love this turkey!  It's even great and juicy the next day!  
Used turkey stock (boiled the giblets and neck) and the juices from the turkey to make a wonderful gravy as well!  
I would be too afraid to ever try anything else!  This recipe makes "The World's Best Turkey"

After following the recipe to a T, we were excited to try this delicious smelling, and looking bird.  The disappointment came when biting into the breast meat and coming up hard and dry.  The dark meat was a little better.  Don't think we'll be trying this one again.

Ok, this was my best turkey ever.  Great recipe!  I didn't taste the Champagne at all, but then again I used Austi as I prefer its taste. 

I will definately use this recipe again!  Thanks!

This was the juiciest most flavorful turkey I have ever cooked. I did mine on the grill and stuffed it with apple onion and lemon. The champagne mixed with the drippings in the butter made the best tasting gravy I have ever had.

I’ve made this for the last couple of years and it’s a huge HIT! Everyone is so surprised when I tell them I cook my thanksgiving turkey in champagne :-). QUESTION: has anyone perfected the gravy?! How do I make a good gravy with the juices??

This turkey turns out moist and delicious. I prefer to use pear or apple sparkling juices instead of the champagne.  I don't make turkeys often,  but when I do, this is the one I love.

The turkey was the best that I have ever made. Making it again tomorrow for Christmas Dinner. Our turkey was so moist that it fell off of the bone and the flavor was simply amazing! Can't wait until tomorrow.

Just amazing turkey. Baked as directed my 14 lb. unstuffed turkey was done in 3 1/4 hours on 350.  But do add a Tblsp of flour to the empty bag so the turkey slides in easily and yes, do cut about 4 one inch slits in the top of the bag. Turkey was moist and perfect. Also makes excellent gravy by adding a little flour and water whisked together and gradually stirred into the boiling juices from the cut away cooking bag. This will now be my favorite way to cook a turkey.

I added chopped onion and celery to the inside and outside of the bird. It weighted just 13 pounds and was done in 2 hours at 350. This was the best gravy ever, and the turkey was moist and juicy. I will definitely use this again. I just added chicken boullion to the juices and a little corn starch. Yum

I used an 18 lb turkey and it cooked in under 3 hours.  I kept it at  180 degrees for 2 hours after I drained most of the liquid from the bag. My gravy was made well before and wasn't part of the last minute flurry of activity.  This was a super tender, tasty turkey.

This is truly the most delicious turkey recipe in the world! It was super super moist. The champagne made it so very juicy and a little sweet. I will always make it this way from now on.  Everybody loved it and it was gone in 5 minutes.  I didn't cook it in the oven bag but did everything else she said and it came out delicious. Ten stars. :)

Folks - simply the best turkey ever made. My Mother in-law was blown away by it and she has made turkey for the last 30 years. 

Tip: I wet brined the turkey for 24 hours, then rinsed the brine off before baking. I also added rosemary and thyme to the recipe. Smelled amazing and was the most moist turkey ever! the apples really added alot of flavor to the meat - add this for sure!

I was a little skeptical of using this recipe but every year I like to try something different so I gave it a shot and boy am I glad I did.  I had an emergency happen on Thanksgiving and had to reheat this the next day for our celebration so I was dreading the dryness of the secound reheat and I am truley amazed how moist and wonderful this turned out.  I am actually making another turkey for Christmas and doing this exact recipe again..... thank you for such a easy simple and delicious recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a 15 lb turkey, cooked it for 3.5 hrs, I followed the recipe, the only difference I used fresh garlic and put it under the skin with the butter and I used cajun season instead of salt and pepper. Very nice easy recipe.

This was my first year making Thanksgiving dinner and I was so afraid that my turkey was going to come out dry. This recipe really is "The World's Best Turkey!"  It was a life saver for me and my family raved about how good my turkey was! Thank you for this recipe, it was amazing!

Sad to say I was disappointed. After reading all the rave reviews, I was let down when my turkey actually came out more dry than my usual recipe. The gravy however, was delicious.

Amazing recipe! Wow. Everyone raved about this turkey. Was my first time hosting holiday supper and roasting a turkey and everyone commented on how moist this turkey was and that it didn't even need gravy. I followed the directions on the roasting bag and poked holes on the top of the bag once turkey was in the roaster. And threw in a few of my own spices that I had on hand. I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could.

I have used this recipe every year since I first found it.  I do rub herbed butter under the turkey skin on the breast meat, and I stuff the cavity with herbs and oranges in addition to the apples.  I also buy the cheapest champagne I can find, the high sugar content seems to caramelize nicely on the turkey skin.  We always have a fairly large bird, at least 22 pounds, so the cooking time and temperature work fine for me. While I am busy making everything else, this turkey just cooks itself and turns out fabulous.  The pan drippings make a very tasty gravy too!

This makes a wonderful turkey. Take the time to really put butter under the skin of the whole turkey. Also, microwave half a white onion, 1 apple cut in half, a cup of water, and two cinnamon sticks for a few minutes.  Put all except the water in the cavity. Will pump this recipe up!

I have made many turkeys and this was the moistest turkey ever.  You don't really taste the champagne but it leaves a very juicy turkey.   I used more apples to fill the cavity and put freh poultry herb sprigs.  The apples were also delicious.  I used Barefoot Bubbly champagne and would use it again.  I also used more apples to fill the cavity of my 19 lb bird and put fresh poultry herb sprigs in the middle.  The apples were delicious as well.   This is my new Turkey Recipe of choice now.  I cooked the stuffing in the crock pot on high one hour and low for 5 hours foe two cub bison boxes.  Added apples for more moisture.

I have made this turkey for several years.  To answer the questions about slits in the bag - I don't.  But, I have never seen those instructions on my bags (I use Reynolds brand).  Just dust the inside of the bag with flour.  My family cannot get enough of the gravy made with these drippings.  And the bonus is that I get to have a mimosa on Thanksgiving morning, after the bird goes into the oven (with what's left of the champagne).

This was NOT the best turkey I've ever had nor did it come out moist.  I will stick with my regular method.  The turkey had no flavor of the items inside.  I usually cook mine in a bag with fresh herbs under the skin.  I will do that next year.  Thankfully, the stuffing was the best I've ever made! Lol

I hosted my first Thanksgiving this year and it was an absolute success! My dad is still talking about how moist the turkey was! As some other users have posted, I was concerned whether or not to cut holes in the baking bag. I cut holes to remain onthe safe side and everything worked out well. The bag did stick to the skin of the turkey a little bit but was easily pulled off. I reccomend this recipe to everyone!

Perfect, the skin was awesome and the turkey was moist. The mushy apples in the middle made a great topping!!

I've never attempted a turkey before, but this was super-easy and delicious!  It was so tender, that when I went to carve it the meat just fell right off the bone.  Simply wonderful!

Pretty darn good.  I would leave out the butter next time, as it made some of the meat really "greasy".

This recipe wasn't as amazing as I was expecting it to be. For personal preference, I didn't use the champagne, but followed everything more or less. I added a few more spices inside and outside the bird, and added some onion and carrot to the apples inside and outside (used cider instead of champagne). Given, the turkey was just as moist as all of the other reviewers said it would be, but the flavor wasn't remarkable. It wasn't bad, just not "the world's best." Sorry to give a low rating--it wasn't a bad recipe (in fact, I'll probably be using the oven bags more often now), but it just seemed like effort for nothing out of the ordinary--with no apple flavor, at all.

Amazing.

Also, i did substitute the champagne for some Sparkling cranberry/apple cider. I also put other berries with the apples. Makes a great aroma while cooking.

I LOVE this recipe, I used it two years ago at Thanksgiving when I made my first turkey for my in-laws. The bird literally fell apart, it was so moist, everyone loved it and I was able to make a ton of gravy from the drippings.  I used it again last christmas and I'll be using it this year too!!!

I tried this recipe 2 years ago and it is a Thanksgiving staple now. Very easy and the white meat turns out perfect. If this is your first time cooking a turkey, this is the perfect recipe.

Took this to a work pitch-in.  I prepped the turkey the night before (rinse, dried, and skin pulled up.)  At 3:30 I woke up turned on the oven...shoved the butter under the skin, seasoned the skin (I used Cajun seasoning), shoved onions in the cavity, used white wine instead of champange  and went back to sleep.  
Not only was this a great novelty item to bring in late August, but it was so tender (thank goodness) I was glad I forgot a carving knife...just to watch the gals ooooooooh and ahhhhh as the breast meat fell off the bone!

This was the most moist delicious turkey we ever ate.  I followed the recipe to a T and it was fabulous.  The skin was very dark, and I thought that I had overcooked it, but after we pulled the meat off the bone (it was too tender to cut) the serving platter looked awesome.  Will definately use this reciped again and again.

I found this recipe last year while searching these archives, decided to try it and I got the best Turkey reviews I've ever had at Thanksgiving, trust me on this, you will LOVE this recipe, and I'm going to with out a doubt use it again, another tip I have is along with the butter using your hands rub a bit of peanut oil under the skin!!!

This was the first turkey I cooked, and it turned out great. The meat was so tender it literaly fell right off of the bone. I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

This recipe sounded so unusual I just had to try it - the turkey was really delicious and moist; it did fall from the bone!!!

I made this turkey last year, as my very first turkey ever, and plan to do it again this year.  Everyone loved it and there were NO leftovers!  Thank you for this excellent recipe.

I used this recipe last Christmas to make my very first Turkey.  It was EASY and the turkey turned out PERFECT. The top of my turkey was a dark brown (almost looked burnt), but that was due to the butter, but the Turkey was not burned, it was delicious and juicy. Thanks!
