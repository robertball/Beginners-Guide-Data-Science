I made this as directed, only doubled it. I really liked it, but my husband didn't finish his bowl and said "I'm glad you like it- you have lots of leftovers to eat." He said he didn't like the stalks of the bok choy (I left them chopped in large pieces), and said he didn't like the lime taste in it. I however, really liked it- I will chop the stalks smaller like celery next time, and maybe add a cooked chopped chicken breast, and maybe some red pepper flakes. I also will just sprinkle the chopped green onions on top before serving along with the cilantro, as the freshness of the green onion disappeared after it was cooked. I also added fresh cracked black pepper over the top.  I will make this again for myself- only not doubling it next time :). 2nd review- This time I chopped the bok coy stems smaller, added  1 chopped yellow onion, 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, 1 seeded jalapeno, 4 inner stalks of celery and leaves, chopped,  sauteed in olive oil, and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. turmeric powder, skipped the cilantro and put chopped parsley on top. Did not add any lime juice. Delicious!

I made some changes... instead of regular bok choy, I used Shanghai bok choy. They are smaller and more tender. Find them at the Asian grocery. I cut the mushrooms medium sized how I like them. Instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable stock since I am vegetarian. I used granulated garlic, ground ginger; ground onion, parsley, and Italian seasoning in the soup. I did not use cilantro. I also added cayenne pepper because I like spice. I added a little pink salt and black pepper as well. As for the lime, I only added a few drops and taste it as it cooked. That way too much wouldn’t be put it and over power the soup because like isn’t a favorite of mine. This way it was adjusted to my tastes and very good.

This was excellent. I only omitted the cilantro and put the green onions on top when it was done. I am on a keto diet so I added some heavy cream at the end. Will definitely make this again.

This soup is absolutely delicious and very easy to make!  The only change I would make is to add more vegetables.  I  had to send this recipe to my friends who raved about it when I made it for a quick lunch on a cold day.

One of our Absolute Favorites!!!   We buy high quality mushrooms (not just the usual white caps) and use bone broth to make this soup....  it feels like one of the healthiest / most restorative foods that our family eats!   I actually feel energized after eating it.... so I think that's a good sign.

yes, this is a simple soup, but that's what makes it great.   the flavor of the bok choy and the mushrooms really came through.

Overall a good recipe with a nice flavor profile (although my wife found it a bit too spicy). I added a few tablespoons of soy sauce because (a) I thought it needed some salt and (b) it seemed like soy sauce would work well with the other ingredients. I was happy with the result.

Loved the flavors in this soup!  Modified a bit based on available ingredients. Added a little ginger. And some chicken. Next time will add some red pepper flakes for more kick.

We grew a bunch of Bok Choy and thought this would be a great soup but the lime RUINED it! I didnt even put the full amount in. The flavor came out too tangy and we threw it all out. I will try this again another time and leave out the lime.

This is the first time I have had bok choy. This soup turned out so good I had to make a review even though I did not make it exactly. I added a little kale and used bouillon and better than bouillon to the base, added red pepper flakes, ground ginger instead of the real thing, and regular onions in the soup instead of green.  I know people don't like it when you change the recipe and make a review but the recipe deserves credit for giving me the idea of trying it. It is really good.

I made this soup twice because I thought, "maybe I did something wrong?" But after two tries with the same results - I'm going to say that it's just not for me.  It's a little too busy and I found the ingredients to be a little two conflicting.  Maybe something simpler for a light healthy  bok choy and mushroom soup.

Loved the flavor combo of ginger root and lime.  I halved the recipe and added the juice of 1/2 juicy lime.  Still added 5 slices ginger that I julienned.  Almost tossed in some red pepper flakes before tasting.  Glad I didn't.  The ginger root was just right.  Made homemade chicken broth and added 1 chicken thigh, chopped, to make it a main dish. Had a couple of little packets of soy sauce from take out.  Put those in.  Will make again.  I try to incorporate different veggies every week.  This recipe fit the bill.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I used two limes and may of had to much, after I got past the pucker of the lime juice, it was great! I didn't have green onions, was not going out to get more. But it was real good and filling!

A friend recommended this recipe to me.  I had a HUGE bok choy from my CSA.  I chopped a good deal of the white stems (kind of like you might chop celery).  I didn't use all of the mushrooms because a pound of crimini would have cost $8 on sale!  I might not know where to buy mushrooms!  But this soup was great and I'd definitely make it again.

It was just what I was craving! I cooked chicken in a slow crock pot so it fell apart into tender chicken little pieces. My husband liked chunks better though so I'll just cut it next time. Don't use boullion though it made it too salty!

I was looking for a broth based soup and this fit the bill. I used half olive oil and half butter for the sauteeing. Delicious with out being  too filling.  Lori L.

A really tasty and simple recipe. I'm always looking for ways to use bok choy and I really enjoyed this. I loved the addition of lime juice. It adds a nice subtle tang. I thought this needed a touch of salt before serving, but this will depend on what kind of chicken broth you use. Soy sauce would be a nice addition too. Thanks for the yummy recipe!
