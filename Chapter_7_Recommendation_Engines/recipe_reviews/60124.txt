I used frozen corn, so the presentation wasn't what it should have been.  I had been concerned about the wine with the cabbage and corn, but the taste was very mild.  I did not use any butter, and it still tasted good!

Not much to this dish.  It wasn't bad, there just wasn't much flavor to this dish.

This was real easy and very tasty.  I used corn off the cob and slightly less butter.  I used Chardonnay.  Also, I melted the sauce in the microwave.
