Excellent! Finely chopped ingredients are a must-big chunks make the whole thing fall apart.
Add bread crumbs to stiffen the mixture. Also put in freezer for a bit before grilling to make the skewers hold together. 

Don't leave on the grill for too long as they cook faster than you may think. 

Goes well with a nice ale.

This recipe is excellent. We love it! I made it twice - once using lamb and once using beef. We liked it both ways. Also, I made it in the oven instead of on a BBQ and was satisfied with the result.

This is a great, unique BBQ recipe!  You may need to add some bread crumbs to the mixture if your ground lamb is moist.

3/5/06 This is a great recipe - I LOVE the combination of mint and cilantro! Also, when I make kebabs (Indian or Greek) I often use half ground lamb, half ground beef - the flavor is really excellent, and the meat stays a little more moist than if using just lamb. I serve these on warm split naan breads or paratha with a drizzle of cucumber raita. With a leafy salad, some onion chutney, and a couple of pappadums, this makes an awesome meal. 8/9/07 Made these again for lunch today. Absolutely outstanding. I'd forgotten how much I love them! Thanks so much, Yakuta!

I used the food processor to chop the onion and cilantro and had no problems with it falling apart.  Only had dried mint so used 1 tbsp. of that.  I waited a few hours and took a small portion of it and made a 'sample' hamburger to see what needed to be tweeked.  It tasted very nice and I could see it would hold together for kabobs.  I did add 1 tsp. of allspice because having company from Jordan for dinner so wanted to tweak this a little middle eastern.  Soaked the skewers first so I would not need to call the fire dept. later.  Put these on the broiler pan lined w/aluminum foil brushed w/oil and put them in the broiler.  These would be great on the summer grill.  Served these with "Red Lentil Curry" and "Indian Spiced Rice" here on allrecipes and it made a very nice meal.  Great presentation on the skewers.

I thought these kababs tasted fantastic.  The chopped mint and cilantro really adds a lot of flavor.  I did, however, make a few changes. I made the kababs as stated substituting ground beef for lamb and minced chilies instead of green chile paste. I allowed the mixture to marinate overnight (the longer the better), brushed the patties with olive oil, and grilled them on my George Foreman grill.

I did something a bit different:  I used turkey instead of lamb.  And I don't use the two pastes (since I don't have them), but add a bit of ginger powder instead.  My adjusted version has always turned out amazingly well.  I have done it several times, and even grilled them on a George Forman grill a few times - they always turn out great and get fabulous reviews from my friends (Many people have asked for the recipe).

I really didn't expect to like this going into it, but I was -very- pleasantly surprised. This is perfectly seasoned lamb! I ended up having to use freshly diced green chilis, as I could find no paste. Everything else was the same. I had no trouble at all with these sticking or falling apart. I think you need to have your grill very hot, and let it sear and get brown on one side before moving it. My lamb wasn't lean, and it was a little greasy for me - but that is entirely my own fault. Use lean lamb, it will be better! Thanks. - Served with tzatiki sauce and naan bread.

I made with 2 separate batches, one with beef and other with chicken.  Chicken was way too wet and did not hold together on the skewer.  Used about a cup of breadcrumbs, which did not help either.  Beef kebabs turned out well, but still required about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs for it to hold together.  I noticed someone using flour to hold together falafels, may use that next time.  Will make again but cut down the amount of mint and increase coriander.

I have made this several times.  The first was a few years ago, and I would have rated the recipe 3 stars although I followed it exactly..they were dry and bland.  Then just a few months ago I decided to make it again, and follow the recipe once more.  This time they were excellent!!  The difference?  The first time I used lamb from the supermarket, the second time I had the butcher make it from lamb shoulder.  I always get the lamb from the butcher now, it's so moist and flavorful that way.  I have tinkered with the spices, etc but really its good as written.  I don't leave out the cilantro even though I don't like it, because it adds to the overall flavour.  You can't really taste the mint even if you use fresh.  Fanstastic recipe! Use good quality meat!

These are so good!  I made them into patties and fried them, mostly due to laziness.  I will be making these regularly, thank you!

Great! Tastes like the ones in the resturaunts. Everyone loved it. Tastes
better if you fry or grill them extra crisp and drizzle with lime juice. I found the spices too strong so I reduced them by half. For a healthier alternatve, try mixing chicken and lamb

Perfect spice blend and very easy to produce. I have made this over and over again using ground chicken or beef. I don't have a grill, so I simply shape them into mini patties or mini logs and brown them in a skillet before transferring them to a cooking sheet and baking them in the oven. Very tasty. Thank you for sharing.

SO yummy! I used all ground beef. Be sure to chop the veggies and herbs finely, or they will fall apart. Don't be shy with the cilantro and mint! Served with naan and cucumber raita from this site. Excellent!

I made this last night, and got the best reviews ever from company. I only used one large onion, and ground the lamb myself with the help of my stand mixer. I ended up making small patties, though, and cooking them on cast iron on the stove (ran out of propane for the grill). I had my company say it was better than the food they'd had in authentic curry houses. Top notch.

Delicious. As others have mentioned, using half ground beef, half lamb works very well. I used the rest of my raw beef-lamb mixture for pastitsio.

This is an awesome recipe!  The first time I made it I made it as written and it was delicious.  I expected it to be hotter than it was. My husband and I both love spicy food, so the next time I made it I doubled the cayenne pepper and used Hungarian (hot) paprika, some hot curry powder, red pepper flakes as well and also chopped up a jalapeno pepper and it was perfect for us.

Tasty and moist. I used beef instead of lamb and did them in the oven. The flavours work well together. Looking forward to trying it again on the BBQ

Great recipe. I left out the mint because my husband hates it. I did make a sauce with yogurt, garlic, chopped onions and chopped cilantro that really added to the dish, I thought. Love the flavours. Did some grilled eggplant and basmati rice and pitas on the side. Great dinner. A little different from the usual! I'd definitely make it again.

This "Indian Style Sheekh Kababs" recipe is FANTASTIC! It tastes very authentic and it is so easy to make. My husband is Iranian, and Iranians usually grate the onions by hand for their kababs (rather than chop them finely). I'm too lazy for that, and usually just puree them in the food processor (S Blade, NOT the grater disc). For this particular Indian-Style recipe, I suggest doing all of the following in the food processor: (a) "mincing" the ginger; (b) "grating" the onion (JUST BARELY PUREED and added on top of the ginger); (c) mixing the spices with puree mixture so that they will be evenly distributed in the meat mixture; and (d) adding the cilanto and mint to the onion puree and "pulsing" a couple times to "chop them finely". (You will want to work quickly and wash your food processor right away so the spices don't stain it.) Also, in the wintertime, we often just make meat patties using a restaurant-style burger press, and bake them in the oven with a broiler treatment the last few minutes. Although it is not as good as on the BBQ, it is still pretty darn good. This is one of our favorite recipes! Thanks Yakuta!

Serrano peppers are the best. I found adding a beaten egg also helps the cohesiveness. Yum with the cucumber raita. :)

I have done this recipe twice -- once for the ground lamb as directed, and once using the ingredients as a marinade for lamb chops.  Both times it was delicious and I became the heroine of the day.

Loved it! Took others advice and used bread crumbs and used food processor to make a nice paste with the onions and spices. Also added garam masala like someone suggested.

This was wonderful! The flavors were fantastic! I have an international supermarket nearby with all I needed for this. I changed nothing at all. Didn't need to mess with the food processor, just ran the onion through the coarse side of the box grater. Everything else tasted the edge of my chef's knife! ;)  I served this with frozen nann (cheated, sorry.. ) and the AWESOME cucumber raita by BeneloventEmpress elsewhere here. Had to roll me to bed... ;)

I left out 3/4ths of the spices because I was going from memory. I was shocked, SHOCKED! when it came out a little bland. Actually it wasn't bad considering. I bet this recipe is awesome when in full force.

These were delicious, served as part of an Indian dinner last night.  Made no changes other than I had to use dried cilantro and mint paste as I had no fresh.  They are a little time consuming to make and its very difficult trying to form around the skewers.  I tried everything including making sausages and then putting the skewers through later, no matter what it was still quite difficult.  I guess worth the hassle, as they were gorgeous.  Cooked on an electric griddle, as didn't want to use the grill this time of year!!!

Ridiculously good. I'm always eager to try lamb dishes, because I love lamb, and so few dishes in the US use it. I stuck to the recipe for the most part, but I did add in a bit of turmeric and some spicy curry powder -- just a bit. I was in lamb heaven. I love the cilantro and mint... excellent combination. I'll surely be making this again. Everyone who tried it thought it was amazing.

Excellent recipe that also works well with a ground beef and sausage mixture.  Try using flat skewers (if you can find them) and the meat will not spin when you try to turn it on the grill.  And as someone else mentioned...chop ingredients very fine.

I always have ground lamb in my freezer for this dish -it's so cheap. I don't make it too hot and usually use what I have in the cupboards (cumin and coriander are a must). I serve this with an amazing greek yoghurt and salad or rice.

This was an excellent recipe, although I made it with yellow curry paste.  I recommend  eating it with the cucumber raita recipe from here..and pita bread..an Indian soulvaki.

When I hear someone say that they don't like lamb, I know that haven't had lamb cooked right. This is lamb cooked right. The combination of herbs and spices blend together to mask any "gamey" flavors. It is also the first time I know of where I had lamb, liked it and it didn't have any garlic in it.

Way too much mint and cumin.  I gave up trying to fix the taste and washed all the spices off.  I added a box of Shan Tikka Seekh Kebab masala to fix it and thank God that it became edible.

You can also make a similar recipe with minced chicken, garam masala, chopped onion,  cilantro, green chilies and red chilie powder which would be delight for chicken lovers.

Love the minty hints! Definitely very flavorful indeed. I did not marinate it as long as the recipe suggests but it still tastes fantastic! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! Btw, I used beef instead coz lamb is just too expensive...

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using ground beef as opposed to lamb, they were delicious! Tasted so much like the ones at the Indian restaurant that we order them from! We made a coll greek yogurt, cucumber and mint sauce to go along with them. This is a recipe i will make again!

This is a comment about methods to keep the meat from rotating when you turn them or falling off the skewers. At middle eastern markets (if you have one near you) one can buy metal skewers that are flat and a scant half inch wide. Forming the ground meat around these is much easier and relatively failsafe. A second method is to use 2 skewers (well soaked bamboo or wood). While the meat will easily rotate on a single skewer, it usually will not using 2 skewers. I have not made this recipe but gave it 5 stars based on ingredients. I am sure it would be very good, but I have a recipe that I have used for years that is a little different.

Great grilling idea.  May need to cut the salt.  If using metal skewers, you'll need to refrigerate the kebobs before grilling to keep them together.  Adding the breadcrumbs helped.

Definitely adds a punch of flavor and herby aroma. Added garlic salt and 1/4 c breadcrumbs to prevent the mixture from breaking apart. Formed patties and ate as a burger.

I was so concerned that the meat would fall off the skewers on the grill, but they held in there perfectly. Don't try to turn them too soon, let them really brown on the bottom--best way to ensure this is to use the oil specified in the recipe to coat the grill racks. This recipe was very easy, fantastically flavorful, and fun to eat. LOVED IT!

This is a wonderful recipe! I usually make it with lean ground beef instead of lamb. I have never used mint - instead I use double the amount of coriander leaves. I usually do have to add bread crumbs to the mixture to help it stay together. I have made this both with and without skewers. Without skewers, I just shape them into smaller kebabs. I usually broil these for about 5 minutes, then turn them and broil for about another 5 minutes but they do have to be watched quite closely as they cook very quickly. Thanks, Yakuta for this great recipe!

This was AWESOME! I love cilantro so the flavor was fantastic to me!  I'd make it again over and over except for my husband was a bit overwhelmed with the same cilantro I love so much.  He did like it better as leftovers, though...

This is a fantastic, flavorful recipe that my family and friends love. Couple of suggestions for preparation
And serving; We use lean beef instead of lamb just because it's more economical.  It's difficult to form the meat around skewers, so form them first and then just insert the skewers.  This pairs well on Greek pita bread with humus, cucumbers, lettuce and tomato's.

Love this recipe and really folks,  you can't substiture lamb for anything else.  It may taste ok but it won't be Sheekh Kabab.  I'm a big lamb fan and so is my family.

Very tasty meat mixture. I used a mixture of 50/50 pork and beef, as I am not a fan of lamb.  If I were to make again, I would cut the amount of salt in half, as I found the kebab's overly salty. Would make again with some minor tweaks.

This is a great recipe! I can't always find mint, so I just use cilantro and where I'm to, I would have to purchase a whole package of green chili which isn't economical so I'll substitute with chili powder. If people need a binding agent, try using chick pea flour which was told to me by my Pakistani friend.

I use ground beef, fresh ginger root, and both spearmint and chocolate mint. I did add some minced garlic and 1/8 teaspoon of garam masala. I baked these fearing they would fall apart if I grilled. They were too spicy for my wife but my son and I liked them.

This is a family favorite.  I use either ground lamb, meatloaf mix, or a combination of meatloaf mix and 90% ground beef.  I chop all ingredients in food processor and mix with spices in a bowl.  If I am out of fresh cilantro, I double the amount of ground coriander. I find baking the skewers on a broiling pan at 425F works very well, turning after 20 min and cooking for an additional 5-10.  You don't want to overcook or they get really dry.

Awesome dish! I added one diced thai chili pepper sans seeds, tumeric, fennel seeds and garam masala and cardamom.  I used fresh ground ginger root and not the paste.  This is a repeater!

I made this for my family tonight.  I did not have any lamb.  I used a meatloaf grind (veal, pork and beef).  It came out delicious.  I can't wait to try it when I have some ground lamb on hand.

Nice recipe, but you need a binding agent. Chickpea flour (besan in India) is recommended, but you can substitute with white flour. But avoid cornstarch, it has a tendency to get slimy.

Extremely flavorful.  I thought it was better leftover the next day, so next time I might try leaving it in the fridge overnight before I cook it.  I put all the herbs and onion in the food processor for a spin, so everything was really finely chopped which as others have said really helps hold things together.  Make sure you use wide metal skewers, or just skip them altogether and make logs.

Well, hubby cooked these on the grill and was so irritated with them falling apart he said "we're not making these again!" After he tasted a crumb that fell apart he said "next time we make these, we'll just cook them in a fry pan, these are better than papa gyros! (Papa gyros is a nearby restaurant) I'd say this is a win! Thanks for this awesome keeper!

Wow!  This recipe is superb!  Rather than making into kabobs, I just made sliders.  Definitely use lamb, if you want a traditional, fabulous kabob.  The seasonings are spot-on and I followed the recipe just as written.   I wouldn't change a thing.  I paired this with Chef John's tzatziki sauce, it was the greatest compliment of flavors!  Way to go, and thanks for the great recipe.

I made this as an appetizer for an annual curry cook off that my English friends host. It took honorable mention as a write in vote!   They were gone within minutes. I made 1.5 x the recipe and added 1 lb of lean ground beef as others had mentioned. I also added enough dry bread crumbs to keep it together. I used a mixture of fresh tabasco and jalapeño peppers because I couldn't find green chili paste at the store. We broiled these because of the rain but plan to grill the next time . These made about 30 skewers and had I known what a hit they would have been I would have tripled it. I can't say enough how good these are. Thanks for sharing the recipe

Great flavor, but they wouldn't stay together...I ended up adding panko and eggs.....its ok but I think I'll stay with meat cubes as opposed to ground meat.

This was fantastic. I omitted the skewers & formed small sausages & baked them, it worked fine. I would serve it with a cool yogurt sauce (I like Tzatziki myself). Will definately make again & again.

Good flavour and molded well - lots of front spices without a good robust flavour to back it up.

We loved these. I used 2 seeded jalapenos instead of chile paste. Will probably dbl cilantro and drop the mint as we are not fond of mint and will try a tidge of breadcrumbs to stiffen. These were nicely moist though so I don't want to ruin that! These would be great in a pita with salad, tahini sauce and cucumber raita. thx!

Wa Wa Just like my mom makes! You can also make round patties like a burger and eat them like a burger.

I used lean beef instead of lambs, and put the chopped chiles, ginger, and onion in the food processor.  I added bread crumbs and refrigerated but still had a problem with the kebabs falling apart on the grill.  We liberally oiled the grill grates, but the kebabs kept sticking to the grill, and were ripped apart when we turned them.  These still tasted wonderful, and I will make them again but I will shape them into patties instead.

I broiled patties of this tasty meat mixture and WOW!! really great!! A little over salty but I'll fix that next time. I want to try this on the grill. I served with a little yogurt, the carrot peanut salad on this site, hummus, naan and plain green peas. Terrific Dinner!!

Flavorful, moist, and adjustable! I used ground turkey, fresh ginger (kept in freezer and grated finely), and canned chopped green chilis. I also had to add 1 cup of bread crumbs to give the turkey some binding ability. My family has asked me to make more next time!

This was pretty good, but not quite the flavor I was looking for.  This one has a very "bright" flavor, with the mint and the cilantro etc.  I froze the leftovers, and I do plan on eating them sometime.  It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that I was looking for a "darker" flavor... if that makes sense.
