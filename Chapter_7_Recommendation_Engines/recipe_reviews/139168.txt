I did not enjoy this dish. I would not recommend making it. Maybe thats why it was never rated before besides me! Keep looking.

I don't what the 1st reviewer was looking for but I thought these were great! Kids loved it, I loved it. This is not gourmet food, it is Bar & Grill food....

These were GREAT! I made them in the oven, not the microwave. Very tasty, perfect for a football game with some ranch dressing for dipping.

Like the recipe says, great for a dorm!  Butter & hot sauce is the traditional way to make wings (Red Hot, of course!) so have to give props for that too!

Was Very easy to make! Thought it was better in the oven than in the microwave by far.... A little more hot sauce and a little less butter!

Bake your chicken in the oven. Microwave your sauce but half it and you will have plenty. As written you will end up with soggy chicken and way too much sauce. Quick and easy recipe but it needs adjustments..

Your wings are GUARANTEED to be soggy if you make them in the microwave OR oven. Instead, throw them in some hot vegetable oil and fry them for about 10 minutes.
You will thank me
