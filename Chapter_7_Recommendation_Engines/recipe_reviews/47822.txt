i used a butterflied boneless leg of lamb for this and it turned out beautifully. i cut the leg into 4 pieces and marinated them all day before grilling. the brown sugar carmelized nicely. the spices together had a morrocan flavor, so i served the lamb with cous cous and grilled vegetables. outstanding.

I served these as appetizers for our 4th of July dinner. FANFLIPPINTASTIC! I made no changes to the recipe except to soak the chops (mine were frenched) in milk for an hour (to remove the gamey flavor) before applying the rub. Cooked them to med well & they were incredible...tender, juicy & extremely flavorful w/out the overpowering lamby flavor that I can't stand. Thansk for a fabulous recipe Deborah Bonzey!

Fantastic different taste for lamb. I didn't have just tarragon on hand but did have herb blend of parsley, chives and tarragon. So I used it which added to the flavour. I will serve this lamb again especially for guests.

I used the broiler. You need to cook it a bit longer. Very tasty.

This recipe made out of the world lamb chops!!  I usually make lamb chops with a garlic, basil, lemon pepper rub, so a sweet rub was a change.  My husband, who rarely expresses enthusiasm about much, raved about these chops!! The flavors were so complementary, and nothing is easier mixing a few spices and herbs together to rub on meat before grilling.  Definitely worth a try.

Great recipe... I let the lamb marinate all night long. Love the way the brown sugar caramalizes on the meat.

I think this would have received 5 stars if I had a grill. The chops were good but I think they might have been better if I were able to grill them, the spice mix was tasty though even with pan frying.

This is very good - even if you accidentally burn the chops a little.  Whoops!  Seriously, this is a great recipe.  My boyfriend told me to put it in regular rotation.  I was a little worried by some of the reviews saying it was too sweet, but I did not find it too sweet at all.  The flavor is very subtle (even after marinating it for more than two days).  I cooked five chops, and there was more than enough rub/marinade.  I broiled it instead of grilling, too.  Definitely a different mix of spices, but it works well.  Thanks, Debra!

Absolutely delicious!  Between the ginger and the brown sugar it's like an invisible BBQ sauce.  Ten minutes on my electric grill was perfect too.

Just made 11 lamb chops this past weekend using this recipe.  I substituted tarragon and cinnamon with just rosemary instead.  Also, I first pan seared each side for about 3 min before baking it for 10 min in 400C, they came out perfectly at medium (each chop was about 1.5 inch thick).  Everyone loved it, will definitely make this again.

Excellent.  Couldn't find lamb chops at my local market, so I substituted pork chops.  They were just as good.  Definitely a recipe to keep on hand.

This was an amazing recipe. My husband LOVED it. It works with Lamb steaks as well, but is better with thick ones. I've made it twice already, and my husband (a "foodie") said: "Right this one down"

Dear Gods, it's so good. I've never used Tarragon before but I plan on using it more often!  So fragrant and tasty.  Now I don't have a bbq but I do have a George Foreman type grill.  So I used that.  I used two large shoulder chops instead of four small ones and I found that the rub did just perfectly for them. (They were each just under a pound)  I tossed all the stuff in a large freezer bag and rubbed it all over the chops, letting it marinade in that instead of on a dish.  Given the size of the chops, I left them on the grill for 8 minutes, poking them a few times with a thermometer to make sure they were doing alright.  Gorgeous, I'm taking this recipe with me to make for Easter for the in-laws.

This recipe is awesome!!  I let the chops marinate for about 6 hours and then my husband put them on the grill.  The glaze that comes from the sugar and spices is amazing.  I have made this a few times, always on the grill, I don't think cooking indoors will give the sugar the carmilization that you get from the grill Again, awesome recipe!!

I doubled the recipe ingredients because I had 8 chops.  I put everything in a zip lock bag and tossed chops and ingredients and left them in the refrigerator for an hour and grilled them for 10 minutes as the recipe said.  Two of my 3 guests said they hated lamb but would try it.  They absolutely loved them and even ate a second chop.  This recipe is 5 stars in my book.  I didn't have Tarragon but replaced it with Oregano (Mediterranean).  It was wonderful!!

Good recipe, but I didn't give it a full five stars because we thought the brown sugar was too powerful in the taste, making it too sweet.

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and soaked it in milk to remove gameyness....then marinated more than expected (two days)...I don't typically like lamb and they were GREAT! My little bro told me it was the best thing he has ever tasted EVER...cooked in a restaurant or at home included! I'm making them this weekend again!

Loved these chops!  I followed all the ingredients as the recipe states and then added olive oil to the mixture to make a paste.  Rubbed both sides of the chops and let them sit in a seal container in the fridge all day, until we grilled them for dinner.  This is my favorite way to fix lamb chops from now on.  We had very thick chops (about 2 1/2 inches) so they took longer to cook, but very, very yummy.

YUMMY!  I am not a lover of lamb because it seems greasy, but cooking it this way made it AMAZING!  Not to mention the rave reviews from my picky eating family. Loved It!

Wow! That's the word I heard over and over at the table this evening. Everyone loved these. We don't serve Lamb often (not sure why) but we will now. Every single person cleaned their plates and had very nice comments about this recipe. The young children enjoyed these as much as the adults. There was no fussing with them to "finish your dinner" :)  I'm sure this is the recipe we will turn to when lamb is on the menu the next time. Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight and my husband and I definitely will add it to our recipe book.  We did omit the tarragon because we arent big fans of it, and we used  butterflied lamb because thats all the store had.  We are huge lamb fans and are glad to have a new way to cook it.  Will make again in the near future!

This was a real hit with the whole family, I used a little olive oil to wet the mix down so I could rub it into the meat, left it about 6 hours before cooking, so taste and tender.

I substituted the brown sugar with condensed milk, left out the tarragon, and baked the lamb chops. They came out perfect. Will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a 10 star recipe. I made baby back pork ribs using this wonderful rub. I placed 1/2 slabs in aluminum foil and applied the rub to both sides, cooked for 2 1/2 hours on 300 degrees. Removed them from foil, lightly sprinkled with rub and placed on the grill for 3 to 4 minutes each side. YUMMY! Don't under estimate the flavor, after tasting no one wanted bbq sauce.

I didnt have a grill but baked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees (2 bone chops per serving) turning it over midway and sprinkling more of the rub on it . Turned out great!

Second time I've made this, both times met with outstanding success.
I didn't have any tarragon on hand either time so I cut back the ginger and cinnamon and used Chinese Five Spice instead. I suspect the star anise flavoring gave it a different feel, but it was sooo good!
Soak your lamb in milk for at least an hour before applying the rub, it helps remove any 'sheepy' flavor.

It is very delicious! My Mom and I loved it but we also have sweet tooth. My husband on the other hand didn't like that much because of the sweetness. It's a good thing that I made a batch for him that is not seasoned. :)
I grilled it with cast iron to get the ridges for about 10 minutes in medium low and then baked it for 8 mins at 350 degrees. 
I didn't have tarragon so I used thyme and it was good. We had rice and asparagus on the side and it is the right balance for the sweetness of the glaze. Great recipe!

Lovely recipe, due to the weather we browned it in a cast iron skillet and finished in the broiler.  Unfortunately my preschoolers did not like it.

The lamb chops were so moist and tasty, I wish I had made more.  Next time I'm going to try it on a roast so that we get to eat more meat.  I highly recommend this recipe.

We loved this, especially the kids.  Had to find some lamb recipes since we bought half a lamb from a local farmer and this one is definitely a keeper.  Followed recipe except no tarragon, so substituted with anise seed and oregano.

This was my first experience cooking lamb and I marinated the chops for more than one hour.  I broiled the chops in my toaster oven.  I loved the taste of the lamb and the sweetness of the seasonings together.  I will definitely make again.

This was so fantastic!  I didn't have time to marinate or get the grill going so I simply followed the recipe and pan seared the lamb in a skillet, 4 to 5 minutes each side and these came out wonderfully!  I had to go get more lamb to make these again!

Delicious!

I didn't have any tarragon, so I used 1-1/2 tsp. of an Herbes de Provence blend, and 1/2 tsp. of dried chives.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  We don't have a grill, so I pan fried them in a cast iron skillet on low for 7 minutes each side.  Next time, I will use a bit more garlic, and I will use tarragon, as I thought the rosemary was a little overpowering.

We gave this to my uncle who "hates" lamb, and he wanted seconds!

Very good and easy.  I love lamb and enjoy trying new ways to make it.  The flavor combination was quite different.  My husband didn't enjoy it as much as I did.  I will most likely try it again but cut down on the cinnamon. Thanks for sharing!

This was so tasty! I used lamb leg steaks as you get more meat. Also I grilled it both sides first and then popped it into the oven for about 30
minutes so it was tender.

We use the spice blend from this recipe all the time. The first time we made it with lamb, and it was excellent, 5 stars all the way. At this point, this is the only thing we'll do to lamb. We've also used it to season potatoes, roasted vegetables, pork, and chicken. It is outstanding. We usually reduce the amount of brown sugar per our taste.

I substituted marjoram for the tarragon because I didn't have any.  I cooked them 5 mins on a side in a cast iron skillet with grilling ridges.  They are simply amazing!  Thanks so much for such a great, yet simple recipe.

I was told by the people I cooked these for that it was the best lamb they've ever had. These folks are 80 years old and have gone through life dining on the most expensive meals, so this recipe MUST be something else. I'm about to try the rub on some ribs over night! Awesome combination!

This was the best lamb chops I have ever had bar none.  Prior to this recipe I cooked lamb chops in a very generic way, salt, pepper, garlic salt then broiled the Lamb and served mint jelly as a condiment but I never really cared for it, it was boring,. Not anymore  Thanks so much

I use fresh garlic and fresh ginger PLUS I use fennel instead of tarragon, because the first time I made it I was out of Tarragon and used fennel as a sub, then tried the original one and the whole fam liked fennel better. One of my British girlfriends declared it the best she has EVER had! So try it and dont be afraid to mix it up a bit. I also add some honey and wine to make it a paste...ok have I changed the whole recipe? Sorry! I cook...not BAKE! lol

AMAZING! I've never had sweet lamb and now I think I'm addicted. Next time I would like to try soaking the lamb in milk for an hour first. Also, I would like to decrease all of the rub by 1/2 because I got a headache from over seasoning.

This was a very unique and interesting rub. We used it on lamb steaks but it would have been even better on lamb chops (or just thinner cuts).  Next time we might also try to add a little chili powder and see if that makes it even better.

We ate these for Mother's Day.  My children have never had lamb.  They ate these like crazy!  The spices are so different (from the usual rosemary) and they weren't sweet at all.

Absolutely the best lamb I have ever tasted! I was hesitant to make lamb since other recipes I've tried haven't turned out well but this recipe was so easy and delicious! We cooked on my Sanyo indoor grill for around 10 - 12 minutes per side.

I was looking for something to do with lamb and I've found it!  I stumbled on this looking for something else and decided to try it even though I wasn't sure about the ingredients and how they would taste.  I did a semi-boneless leg and it was awsome.  I think I'm going to try this on a flank steak.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe to a tee, which I rarely do, and it was fantastic.  I used it on chops and a leg of lamb.  You can change it around but I didn't feel a need too.

this was fantastic. I didn't have dried tarragon, but had fresh, so i substituted a few tablespoons of the fresh tarragon, and added a splash or two of red wine so that it was a marinade rather than a rub. It was amazing!  next time, i will use real garlic and ginger..i think it will improve this already wonderful recipe.

This is DELICIOUS. I follow the recipe exactly, just I double the rub. I've made this multiple times and everyone loves it! It gets asked for by request when I offer to make dinner for family and friends. I serve it on top of couscous as an easy and simple side :)

Absolutely Amazing! I had never had lamb and was a little skeptic, but it came out great. I had to make a minor sub because i did not have garlic powder so i used half the amount of salt as directed and used garlic salt instead. This one is a keeper for sure. Thanks for a great recipe

Very good...I discovered I like a savory lamb dish to a sweet one.  This was my first "sweet" attmept. Then my 12 year old daughter gave me "heck" for cooking a baby sheep...so that did kind of ruin it for me I must say.  Overall though...I would make it again.

I have made this recipe about three times now and love it!! My 7yr old actually asks for this. Here are my modifications. I didn't have Tarragon so that was ommitted. I used rack of lamb instead of chops and added just a bit of cloves. Turns out really nice! Love this recipe.

caramelize them at the end! I honestly think this is the best sweet lamb recipe I know. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except thyme for tarragon and 5-spice powder for cinnamon (a good idea if you have any). I grilled it on a medium flame for about 10-12 minutes per side. Towards the end, I melted a mixture of butter and brown sugar in the microwave and brushed it on the chops. I coated them fairly liberally and turned the heat up to high for about a minute each side, just to caramelize the sugar. That last step ads so much to this dish, if you don't do anything else, do that.

This was OUTSTANDING.   I love lamb anyway; but I was looking for something different to do with lamb for Easter.  I found this recipe, made it exactly according to the recipe and it was divine.  The flavor was so wonderful that my husband and I scarfed through more than was good for us.  I will definitely make this again -- especially if I have people over that I want to impress!

I thought this had a unique flavor, not sure what I thought about it.  My husband; however, loved it.  He just now said it's the best dinner I every made.  That's a stretch-by-far in my thinking, but definately don't shy away and try this recipe.  I followed the recipe, except used fresh tarragon.

This rub is incredible. Here are the changes I made:
1. I placed the lamb chops in a tupperware container with about 1/8 of an inch of soy sauce at the bottom and let them marinate in the fridge all day.
2. I seared them in a skillet with olive oil for 2-3 minutes, until lightly browned.
3. I put them in a roasting pan (the one I use for the Thanksgiving turkey) and cooked them for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.
My husband, who usually loves rare meat, raved and raved about how tender and juicy these were, even though they were cooked all the way through. (If you like rare, cook for less time.) They were so good, this will definitely be a repeat!!!!!

I never made lamb before this recipe.  I must say this was a great introduction, and the recipe came out very tasty!

Very easy to do, but so very, very good.    I did make one change: I added olive oil to make the marinade a liquid (just my preference--I always BBQ with olive oil).

The meat eaters in this house all say EXCELLENT!
Tender, juicy, great flavor, and could always eat more.
Kids ate it, but I didn't let them know what they were eating.
I would probably make it again on special occasion, the price of the meat is the one and only down fall.

This was not really to my liking, too sweet and didn't lilke the tarragon although I found it OK.  However my Mother said it was really nice so that's why I gave it 4 stars.

This was the VERY BEST lamb I have ever tasted.  I was skeptical after they were done grilling because they were a bit blackened, but the flavor was amazing.  I'm not crazy about lamb, but let me tell you, I have dreams about this recipe.  ;)

This glaze with grilled lamb medium rare was the perfect combination.  Slightly sweet but not overbearing.  Served with grilled vegetables made the perfect summer meal.

beyond delicious. easy, easy, easy and soooo good. the spice rub takes away from the gaminess of lamb which i don't love and makes a nice carmelized crust that seals in flavors. it was too hot too grill(105 outside) so i broiled the chops(used 1- 1 and 1/2 inch thick chops) and they turned out moist and divine. better than anything i have had in a restaurant!! AAA++++

I just made these grilled lamb chops last night and they were AMAZING!!! I lhappened to forget to buy brown sugar, so I eft out the brown sugar and the cinnamon and replaced both these ingredients with EVOO (I eye-balled it when pouring in the EVOO) - enough that the mixture wasn't too thick or too oily. I also used lamb rib chops (smaller than full lamb chops) and grilled these for 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes on each side. Served with bacon and onion basalmic green beans and angel hair pasta tossed with freshly minced garlic, salt, pepper and EVOO - - Super good!!!

I had never had lamb before, but I couldn't pass up the brown sugar glaze I'd been craving. The brown sugar was perfect with the lamb because of it's strong taste. I did as some of the previous comments suggested and soaked the lamb in milk for an hour. They turned out really good and I will definitely make this again!

WOW! This was our first time preparing lamb, and it wasn't difficult at all! We could not find lamb chops with a sell-by date beyond Easter, so we bought a leg of lamb instead. My husband deboned and butterflied it himself (after learning how from a video online--you can Google it). He ended up slicing it into three sections. Just make sure it is no thicker than 2"! The rub was delicious! We let it marinade for just over 24 hours. Then we grilled it, and used a meat thermometer to check for doneness. What rave reviews we received on this dinner! I highly recommend this recipe, and will definitely do it again! Don't change anything!!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this recipe!!  Easy, quick, & delicious.  Tastes somewhat similar to a terriyaki, nicely spiced, and very complementary to lamb!  I'd recently bought a boneless leg of lamb from Costco (for less than $14) and I wasn't sure what to do with it.  I found this recipe on AR based on previous ratings and reviews and decided to give a try... I trimmed and cut meat into approx 2" chunks then covered with the rub and let meat sit on counter for about 30 minutes.  Simply cooked (sauted) in hot skillet with olive oil.    We're looking forward to trying this recipe many times again...with chicken, on a steak, and of course to repeat lamb.  Also plan on using this throughout summer on the BBQ!!  Definitely a keeper!!

I thought my favorite lamb recipe from this site (rosemary marinated lamb chops) could never be dethroned but this one totally soared above that one!  I used lamb shoulder chops and coated them liberally with the sugar & spice mix.  I did not refrigerate them for an hour, instead I let them sit at room temp for about 15-20 minutes before putting them on the grill and they were FULL of flavor.  Don't grill at too high a heat or the sugar will scorch and burn.  These were AMAZING!!  My husband couldn't get enough of them.  Will be making them again for him on Valentine's Day :)  Thanks for the most awesome lamb recipe ever!  PS... I've put the spice mixture together (minus the brown sugar) in larger quantities and stored in an airtight container in the pantry so that whenever I want to make these I just measure it out, add the brown sugar and I'm ready to go.  Hard to believe something so delicious could be so easy!

Great! I used "Simply Organic" steak seasoning because we did not have any Tarragon and it has Tarragon in it, along with several other ingredients.  It was perfect!  My husband who was skeptically totally enjoyed.  We had it with asparagus and couscous for Easter Dinner.

Excellent.  Grilled under the broiler and burned it (take care) but it was still wonderful. So easy.

I liked it, but my husband didn't (he didn't like the sugar). I baked them at 350F for 7 minutes a side and then broiled them for 1 minute a side and they were very nice and tender.

The flavors of the rub excited my tongue! They were interesting and tasted wonderful with the lamb. --I used my broiler and it took a couple extra minutes. I'm sure a grill would be better, but it's a Minnesota winter people :) no grilling outside. --Thanks for the recipe!

I had never had lamb before but I used this recipe on some lamb chops and talk about perfection!  My husband doesn't like lamb but this recipe changed his mind.

We tried this last Sunday night, and I nearly cried when we plowed through the chops before dinner hit the table.  Had I known how much I loved these, I would have cashed in my IRA and bought all the chops in the store.  A more economical choice in the future will be to buy a butterflied leg of lamb and do it up family style.  I imagine that this rub would be awesome on veal as well.

We eat a lot of lamb, and usually season the meat the same way every time- this was a great way to mix it up. I loved the sweet taste- it's definitely not the last time we're going to use that recipe! Thanks!

Absolutely 5 Stars.  I made this exactly according to recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and stepson loved this as a fathers day dish and kept asking me about the "secret" ingredients.  It goes really well with sliced baked sweet potatoes and vidalia onions spiced with tarragon - a nice compliment to the slight sweetness of the rub! YUMmee!

Really great!  My husband and 2 year old son loved it.  I didn't have any ginger, so I used Chinese Five Spices instead.  I cooked it inside on a grill pan.  Next time I would cook it a little longer on a lower temperature.

My boyfriend and I had our single friends over for a Valentine's Day dinner party.  It was a huge success and the Lamb Chops went over famously.  Even his teen-age children enjoyed them, which was a first.  We plan on making this recipe again next week, when we can splurge - just the two of us!

Ok.... I was really excited about this recipe and the smell that came off of the meat was intoxicating, however I did not like the taste of it. it was not terrible but I expected more. I'm still glad that I tried it.

I pan seared the lamb chops, then added apple cider vinegar to deglaze the pan. I added the mixture to the vinegar and created a reduction sauce with it. Then I poured the reduction sauce on top of the chops in a casserole dish and finished them in the oven. These braised lamb chops were wonderful!

Delicious!  I lowered the sweetness by using 1 tablespoon maple syrup instead of the recommended 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Fresh tarragon and ginger instead of dried (since I had fresh on hand).  Loved it.  Thank you for posting.

I used the recipe as a spice guide and this was a hit. I didn't have tarragon  so i used a few dashes  of 5 spice powder.  I prepped my chops then went to hang  with  a friend.  Although  these are delicious  alone I  made a sauce to accompany it.  I used  three cloves mashed fresh garlic, a few mint springs and honey.  Use less garlic for milder garlic flavor.    Great recipe !

Served this for my in-laws and everyone loved it.  Husband gave it 5 stars and insists it is a "do-over" again and again.

WOWZER! sooo yummy! i had lamb chops but gave it a shot anyway. i thought the cinnamon was a little strong for my taste. it left a strong after bite, i will cut down next time. my husband is from new zealand and he LOVES his lamb...me, not so much. but this recipe has me considering it more now. i didn't have a grill so i sautéed it in a saucepan for a few mins on each side then foiled a baking sheet and popped it in the oven at 200 degrees for 20 mins to finish it off while i prepared the sides. it was falling off the bone! you can guarantee i will be making this again next time i have lamb!

Wow!! My first time making lamb chops and found this recipe to use, I'm so glad I tried this one. I'm not afraid of Lamb anymore! Didn't have any ginger, used a little more cinnamon and it was great. I love the sweetness but I do not think it was too sweet. Just try it.

I made this last night for a special valentines dinner for 2. I had never cooked or eat lamb before, but my boyfriend loves lamb. I was nervous about serving this since I had no idea what lamb was "suppose" to taste like. He said he has eaten a lot of lamb prepared different ways and this was by far the best he had. He said it was good enough to be on a restaurant menu. I thought it was good too. It was not too sweet like some reviews I read. I added some olive oil to mine to make a paste/marinade and let it set overnight. They were really good and made a gorgeous presentation along side the asparagus mashed potatoes, salad and crusty bread.

I do not usually eat lamb, but my husband loves it...so I thought I would give this a try. I broiled it because my grill was out of propane. It was really good. Will try on the grill next time. The flavors in the glaze complemented the lamb perfectly.

This is a fantastic recipe and I would be doing a disservice to other by not giving it the thumbs up.  I find recipes online all the time and appreciate the feedback from others so I'll add mine.

My wife does not like lamb, she gave it a shot this time and LOVED it!!

I didn't have tarragon, and for the heck of it added dried rosemary and thyme and basil, just enough so that I could see the little bits of herbs on each chop.  Also I used my Cuisinart electric grill and did the 5 min each side and they came out PERFECT!! Man I can't wait to do this one again. Trust me folks this is a great recipe.

Awesome, made exactly as written EXCEPT I used basil instead of tarragon simply because I didn't have any. A finicky eater even LOVED them.

The flavor of this dry rub was outstanding and very unique. I was a little nervous this would be too dry but it wasn't even a little bit, very juicy. This was enjoyed by everyone, even myself who does not prefer eating lamb cooked in any preparation. I'd really like to try this on pork ribs for an interesting/new taste.

Great recipe. I didn't change anything except for the marinade time. I rubbed the lamb in the morning then cooked the lamb around six. Everything was perfect. Delicious. Thanks for sharing and I will keep this recipe for other meats.

Great Dish! I paired it with rosemary baby red potatoes, broccoli, and a delicious red wine. I also wrapped the lamp in a thick slice of bacon which added some great flavor.

This was great! This is the first time I've made chops and it came out fantastic. I didn't have tarragon so I used rosemary instead. My hubby loved this also. I will make this again. Next time however, I want to make a complementary glaze.

Easy, but a little sweet for my taste.  I will reduce the brown sugar a little next time.  I liked how it crusted, though, so that my compromise the crispy crust!  We'll have to see...

Outstanding.   The only challenge when grilling is keeping the flames down and limiting the char.   Keep a close eye on the heat, and try grilling each side for 1 minute, and then grilling with indirect heat.  Enjoy!!

I was in the mood to try something new so I gave this a try.  I threw the spice mix in a plastic bag and shook a bunch of lamb loin chops in it, set them to marinade in the fridge for 2 hours and then grilled them up on the forman grill (4 min each side).  These came out INCREDIBLE!  This is such a simple, quick and easy dish to make and it went over so well that I'm sure I'll be making it often.  My wife is the pickiest eater I've EVER come across and she not only loved it, she said it was probably the tastiest meat she'd ever had!

This was the best rub!  Made this for the holidays and it was huge success!  Refrigerated about 3 hours prior to grilling.

We used a boneless Leg of Lamb and cut it open to get the same thickness throughout. Seared the meat on both sides then cooked for about 40-45 mins with indirect heat on the grill and was a perfect medium rare. This a wonderful main dish and a great rub. Thank you.

I used a 2.5 lb leg of lamb, cubed; didn't have tarragon so I used basil and thyme, and it worked wonderfully. Served with brown rice and caramelized onion, with a side of tabbouleh. Great!

I have made this several times.  Most recently for Valentine's Day.  This is such a yummy pairing with the lamb.  It would be a bit strong on other meats though.  Definitely best grilled. It does carmelize quickly though.  But when the outside was done, the inside was perfectly medium rare.

This was very simple, yet very good. It had subtle hints of sweetness. I was a little worried of the spice mix sticking to the meat and not the grill but it turned out fine. I only used 2 lambchops but still used the same amount of spices. I kept sprinkling little amounts on when I flipped the meat.

Tried this rub with pork chops and used a broiler since I don't have a grill.  Very flavorful - in fact, I found it a little too strong.  I cut the recipe in half and cut the sugar down to 2 tbsp for 3 pork chops.  Quick and easy.  Would definitely make it again but maybe try out some minor adjustments.

I am the lamb lover in my family and I did not care for this at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I just think lamb is soo good by itself it doesn't need this rub.  I will not make this again.

did not make any changes except to double recipe, because we had double the lamb.  Would rather have marinaded it for over night, but will next time.  And by accident overcooked just a little, very little pink, but it was still out of this world in taste, will always cook my lamb this way.  Oh and cooked it in the oven.

I made this recipe as is with no alternations.  The marinade smelled terrific.  I marinated 3 small lamb chops for an hour and cooked for about 10 minutes on an electric grill.  The marinade was not sweet and the tarragon seemed to blend well with the other spices.  I marinated 2 lamb steaks over night and will cook them today on a traditional grill.  Overall, nice marinade and recipe.

This was a perfect cook in the oven. The rub is incredible! Even on a less than perfect cut of meat. I can’t wait to use this same rub on pork chops for this Sunday dinner.

I didn't have tarragon so just left it out. This was our first try at lamb steaks and they were absolutely perfect. My husband gets sick from beef and he has no troubles with the lamb steaks. I'll definitely be making this again, especially after I can buy a lamb share!

Lamb on the sweet side ! I am used to that in Moroccan tagines.. Everyone in the family loved these lamb chops ! I grilled mine 5 minute per side with the lid of the grill opened and they were medium-well as I like them.
I just found the rub to be too much for 4 chops. There was plenty of it for 8 chops.

whooo hooo!  Loved it!  Marinated 4 days due to circumstances.  Pan fried in a bit of olive oil for 3 minutes on each side and then finished in oven at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.  Perfect!  Served with and garlic mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus and kale, glazed carrots and Pugliese brea.d.  Melt in your mouth good!

Your review (optional)
I follow the recipe exactly and I must say my partner and I just loved  it.  These are probably the best lamb chops I have ever made.  Also, preparation is so easy and grilling is so fast.  Amazing!  Don't hesitate to make it.  It is a favorite now.  This is my  fourth time making them and I realized I need to tell the "Allrecipes world" how astonishingly good the chops are for not only an easy dinner for your  family and but guests as well!  They will think you are a  gourmet cook.

I loved this recipe.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes.   I would recommend you check it at about 35 minutes for rare cooking.  The full 45 minutes and the lamb was medium as opposed to rare (as I like it).  It was still fantastic.  It was easy to prepare and cook.

Wow! Definitely a company dish, and an every day dish, and a true winner! For those who think it might be too sweet, we didn't taste sweet, we tasted mostly ginger. I made it exactly as per the recipe, except that I put the ingredients in a Ziplock bag (gallon size) and did the shake-and-bake thing. My husband couldn't stop talking (between bites) about how good it was!

I used a butterflied leg of lamb for this recipe.  I doubled the 
 recipe for the rub.  I didn't have tarragon so I did without and it still came out wonderful.  I did marinate overnight in Greek yogurt then applied the rub the next day.  The rub gave the lamb such a wonderful flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made these for dinner a couple of nights back. Followed suggestion of others and soaked lamb in  whole milk  for 1hour before cooking. No bed bugs  or other pests.
Grilled to 130. Let rest about 10 min and served. Will make again.

I wanted to rate this at four stars but went with three stars because while it taste amazing and is sweet. The lamb is extremely sweet once done. The recipe calls for an abundance of brown sugar in relation to the other ingredients. I will make this recipe again but I will definitely decrease the brown sugar. I might also trying adding some spice or heat to balance out the heat.

Excellent!!! The flavors were great, loved the caramelized edges from the brown sugar. I thought it was very rare after 5 min/side, so let them go a little longer.

This recipe was SIMPLY delicious! Literally! This is the second weekend in a row that I'm making them for my family! This time around I let them marinate overnight. The next day I baked them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, flipped them to the other side halfway thru, and presented these with buttery mashed potatoes and crabcakes. FANTASTIC!

Not a fav. We love lamb and used to have a friend raise one for us every year. We much prefer a savory rather than sweet taste to our lamb chops.

Having never made lamb before I was a little unsure about how to prepare it. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Hubby and I both LOVED it. The flavor was incredible!  Very easy to make! We will definitely use this as our go-to recipe for lamb. Thank you!!

Hubby loved it! I did not grill but used a cast iron pan and cooked 4 minutes per side. Perfect mix of seasoning, a great balance of flavor.

Delicious!! Made this and let the chops marinate for about 4 hours before cooking. Such a nice flavor that brown sugar and cinnamon brings! My husband liked it so much we made meatballs using ground lamb today and he wanted to marinate them before cooking. Well that turned into an icky mess so he ended up mixing the brown sugar mixture into the meat. Then we made meatballs and cooked them with the mixture in the meat. DELICIOUS!! WOWZA!! We put the meatballs on pita with tzatziki sauce for dinner tonight. The meatballs would be great appetizers with toothpicks.

Easy recipe to make with little or no effort.  I used fresh minced ginger, instead of powder and a dab of tumeric powder.  Wife said I should open a food truck and sell this after she tasted them...lol

Brilliant! Didn't have tarragon so used Italian seasoning. My husband, being Aussie, is a lamb lover and absolutely loved the taste. Will be using this rub from now on. Thank you for the recipe.

I used loin chops and first tenderized the meat with a textured mallet- that way I got more surface area for the glaze! Also cut away most of the fat for even cooking.

I used this recipe as a base as suggested by Alee. I substituted rosemary and oregano for the ginger, tarragon and cinnamon.  Also, I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and also added some fresh rosemary and lemon.  Much better. Rating it 3 stars based on my original but would be 4 stars with my changes (I guess I really changed the entire recipe).

This is a fabulous recipe. I've used on a few cuts of lamb and all turned out just wonderful. I was a little concerned at the mix of spices but I'm glad I went ahead and tried it because it's now one of my family's favorite dinners!

Took a lot longer than 5 minutes per side (probably 15-20 minutes per side) to get to 140-degrees. But it was great! Also used the rub on some chicken breasts (because some of the family wouldn't even try the lamb chops) and they came out great too! I'll be using this recipe again!

This was just ok. I liked the caramelized crust but it was a bit too sweet for me. Might be ok as a component in an appetizer or with something savory.

I followed the recipe exactly and this tasted like I was doing the cinnamon challenge.  The friend I had taste-test it with me said cinnamon is one of his favorite things in the world, and this was the first time he thought something had too much cinnamon. I gave it a shot anyway based on all the good reviews, and regretted it.

I used this recipe as a base, however, and discovered that if you leave out the tarragon, ginger, and cinnamon, and add some rosemary and oregano instead, it's absolutely delicious.  I wish I could make it every night.  As written, though, it was completely inedible.

This dish does everything to make me forget about the lamb and mint jelly I was raised on! Anytime you mix brown sugar and ginger and rub it on meat, you are on the road to delicious success. I recently tried a 'winter' version of this by broiling in my oven and I will say that grilling is far better. If I didn't like them so much, I would wait until summer just to use the grill but, not a chance.

WONDERFUL! This is the only way I will eat lamb from now on! I had to run errands so I let the chops soak in milk for 3 hours, then applied the rub, then put it back in the fridge to sit for 2 more hours. Grilled it for 4 minutes on each side and it was perfect. Brown sugar heaven. The moment the flavor hit my tongue I knew why it had earned 5 stars!!

Made this recipe with 1 serving of alternate golden sugar and shoulder chops of lamb without the tarragon. It still tasted delicious!

EXCELLENT flavoring!  We really enjoyed doing something different with the chops, and had never thought about a sweet marinade.  I'll definitely be making these again.

This was my first time grilling lamb chops.  This spice mix had a very unique taste, and the carmelized finish from the brown sugar was perfect.  I put the spice mixture on generously and put in fridge for about 3 hours.  They turned out great!  Doesn't need a glaze with it, but I would recommend one.

This recipe is awesome! The only thing we did was mix together fresh mint with a little olive oil and brush it on at the end of grilling. Delicious!! Highly recommended!

Absolutely fantastic!!! I chose this glaze for my first time making lamb chops. It is great! I did cut down on the amount of pepper though, for my children. I will use this again...possibly for other meats too!

I followed the advice of another post and let the chops marinate overnight.  Yummo!!!  This glaze/rub would be great on just about any meat.

Amazing recipe. Was skeptical at first, thought lamb would need more time marinating, but no. Just perfect. The exotic flavor is indeed a invitation to repeat a thousand times! Totally recommend. I garnished with baked sweet potato, thyme and rosemary twigs, also added some lime wedges... everyone loved!

This recipe was very easy to make, and it was a fascinating combination of flavors.  I found it was a bit too sweet for my family, but would probably have been better if the crust were scraped off before serving, or else just before cooking, so it was not quite so sweet.  I kept thinking I wanted some bleu cheese melted over the top, also, to balance the sweetness.  I will probably try this again, with half the sugar, and the bleu cheese.

My wife and I love a good lamb chop, usually cooked on a BBQ.  With it being winter we do a little more cooking indoors.  Tried this recipe today and it was a success.  Easy to  make, tasted great and presented well.

OMG! This was super delicious. I added all the ingredients with a little bit of cayenne pepper to spice it up a little bit (it added that extra little kick) My husband loved it which makes for a happy home ;-)
