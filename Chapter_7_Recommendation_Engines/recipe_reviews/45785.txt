This side dish I agree is easy and makes good size portions, but I would recommend using a chicken, vegetable or even beef broth instead of water for more depth of flavor. The spices are strong (I would have held back a little on the thyme), but compliment the veges. Cooking the vegetables with the rice makes them mushier than I would have liked, so I may not cook them much first next time. I also added fresh mushrooms and topped with parmesan cheese when served. Husband generally liked this, so we will try it again.

Very good! I used couscous instead of rice(1 cup water + 1 Cup couscous)and I mixed it all together once the couscous was steamed and fluffed. I will probably make it the same way with the rice because I afraid that the veggies might be overcooked for my taste.  I will be making this again with rice, couscous or maybe even pastas like orzo and risi. Thank you for this versatile gem!

Not the greatest.  It had a good flavor, but cooking the veggies WITH the rice for so long made them mushy.  If I make again, I will add the veggies for the last couple of minutes the rice is simmering.

Not sure why you would cook the vegetables until tender, followed by cooking them again, for another 20 minutes, with the rice.  You’d end up with unattractive mush.  I didn’t do that.  I sautéed the vegetables separately, cooked the rice in chicken broth, and then combined the two. In addition, looking over the recipe told me this would be "herb overkill" for my tastes, so I just used Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning (but any seasoning of your choice would work).  This was very good with the above-mentioned modifications, and I’m glad I came across it to make use of the zucchini and asparagus I had in the fridge, but it’s still a basically flawed simple recipe for rice mixed with vegetables.

I did several things differently... I cut up 2 chicken breasts and cooked them in butter, set that aside, then cooked the veggies and added the chicken back in right before adding the spices.  I personally liked the zucchini the best, so I used 2 of those.  I doubled the amount of oregano, basil & garlic.  I also made the rice in a different pan.  I tried to make basmati wild rice, but that didn't work out so well... :) (if anyone knows how to make it right, I would love the help!) so I ended up making instant rice and mixing it in with the veggie/chicken mixture, which was EXCELLENT.  My husband loved this!

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I will use a little less cayenne next time as a bit too hot for my taste. Also used chicken stock rather than just water. Delicious!

This was a disappointment. I thought it had a very bland flavor and needed a lot of salt. Too bad, too, because it looked and smelled good while cooking!

Followed it pretty much, except used only zucchini and added more cayenne pepper and I used chicken stock. It made a little less than the serving said, but overall good. 
- I will make this recipe again.
Thanks for sharing!

Not a bad recipe.  I cooked the vegetables in some vegan margarine, then transferred it to my rice cooker with brown basmati and water.  After cooking I threw some defrosted edamame in with it.  I would definitely play around with the seasonings in the future, but it's a nice and healthy side dish!

This was a huge hit with my family. I put the rice, water and vegtables in the bottom of my rice cooker. I put the vegtables in the steamer basket of my rice cooker. When the rice and vegtables was done tossed them together with the butter.

I tried this recipe with a few changes...I used chicken stock and brown rice, and I added mushrooms and garlic. It was delicious. Definitely a keeper!

Super good!!  I was looking for a nice asparagus-infused recipe and made this for my mom and myself tonight... there is definitely enough left over for tomorrow!  I could have used a little more spice, but my mom likes it mild... though I added Srarchi (sp?) hot sauce to my own portion, and that tasted supurb.  Also, I didn't have any thyme on hand... and substituted instant brown rice for the regular rice.  Still delicious!

Snapper says this is a good recipe.  Snapper cooked the rice in my rice cooker and added it to the vege mixture.  That way the vegetables didn't get soggy.  Snapper added chicken which was very tasty.  Simmered it in a mixture of soy sauce, chicken broth and thickened it with flour.  I then added it to the mixture as well.  MMm very tasty.

This was not appreciated by my family.  The rice was too soft and the color was unappetizing after cooking it with the vegetables.  My husband thought it had an unappealing aroma - even before he tasted it.  We love rice, zuchini, and especially asparagus.  I was suprised that the combination of everything wasn't a hit.

I only used zucchini because my husband doesn't  like asparagus. The spices give it an Italian flavor in my opinion. I followed the rest of the recipe and ended up with a pot of mushy rice. The second time I made it, I took some users advice and cooked them separately and mixed it together afterwards, didn't end up with a pot of mush that time.

Not so great. I used brown rice and cooked it separately. It was pretty bland considering the amount of spices in this. Won't make it again, I was disappointed.

I used a blend of Greek seasoning instead of the spices and herbs along with the cayenne.  It turned out great.  Delicious.  I will make it again.

Very good, I will definitely make it again. I used chicken broth in place of water to cook the rice for added flavor and I had a yellow squash instead of the zucchini.

Cooked for 30 minutes using brown rice. Veggies were soggy so next time cook rice separately for 20 minutes then combine with veggies to finish cooking. Also try increasing amount for each spice.

The flavor was great.  I cooked my rice separately  using chicken broth [instead of water].   then mixed the 2. I prefer my vegies ala dent!!

This was a nice light side dish. I omitted the onion, used only italian seasoning, and cooked rice separately in the rice cooker.

Very flavorful!  My husband really liked it and he's not a big fan of veggies.
