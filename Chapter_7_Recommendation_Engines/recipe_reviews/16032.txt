These cookies didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped. They took more work than I usually put into cookies, and the flavor was rather bland, even with the chocolate frosting. I baked them for 8 minutes instead of 6 because they seemed too doughy, but then they ended up hard. I probably won't be making these again.

These are nice and easy to make and have a great chocolate mint flavor when sandwiched together!
