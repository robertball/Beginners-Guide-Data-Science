If you are fan of *bright* flavors like cilantro, drop the black eyed peas and use fresh de-seeded jalapenos.  I also recommend rinsing any beans before using them for a purer flavor and less sodium. Also, Trader Joe's sells a frozen corn that is "fire-roasted." the kernels are big and striped with the roastedness. Works great in a dish like this.

This is great!  I added a diced avocado and left out the black-eyed peas, but threw in some extra black beans.  Delicious - and a real hit at every party!

I've made this several times and EVERYONE asks for the recipe.  I use green onions instead of white and I omit the bell pepper (because I don't like it.) Also Wishbone Robusto makes a great choice for teh sald dressing.  A few of the other reviewers   commented on it being to watery...  I have found that the longer it sets the more liquid is absorbed.  Tastes great with Frito Scoops!

I served this at a recent gathering at my house. It was almost gone by the end of the night - and there were only seven of us eating it! The only thing I added was the juice of one lime. It was wonderful that night, and the little bit of left over was even more delicious the next day. What a great way to get your veggies!

when I first read the recipe, I thought this was too simple to be impressive...but it was fantastic!  I made it for a cinco de mayo party and people would not stop talking about it.  (They ignored my flan and other way harder things to make!)
I almost make a batch weekly over the summer - add grilled chicken or rice etc...for an entire meal.

Don't go overboard on the cilantro, too much can kill it!

The Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and extra garlic powder really makes this salsa.  When I take the time to chop peppers and onions, it is such a great gourmet salsa.  My friends have raved over and over when I make this.  They even request that I bring it to parties.  I've added extra types beans to this as well, which makes it all the more interesting.

I used a bag of frozen mexican veggie mix, it was already seasoned and chopped so it made it extra easy.  I left out the peppers for personal preference and used taco seasoning and garlic salt.  We put the caviar in the middle of openfaced cojack cheese and bacon quesadillas.  It was so good! We ate the leftovers with chips and then made more!!!  It was so easy. It took like 5 minutes to make the caviar and like 10 to do the quesadillas--yummo!

This is a great recipe, however I changed a few things and it made it even better. I completely omitted the Italian dressing and  used 1T Balsamic Vinegar, 1T Apple Cider Vinegar, 2T EVOO, 1T sugar, a generous amount of cumin and salt and pepper to taste. I also added cubed avacado, fresh diced grape tomatoes, and added green onion. Tastes so fresh and will last for a couple weeks in your fridge if you can keep it that long =)

This variation of cowboy caviar differs slightly from the one I've seen on other sites. I altered mine to make it more like those. I added one ripe avocado, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and instead of garlic salt, I used a half a teaspoon of regular salt and 4 cloves of fresh garlic chopped up in a food processor. I also used half the amount of picked jalapeno peppers they call for here. That seems like a crazy amount to me and I do like spicy food. I think that next time I'm going to use the Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing and add some lime juice.

This would be a great dip/salsa for chips.  Almost too much liquid to eat plain.

This is a hit every time I make it for a party! I dont use Italian dressing though. I use lime juice,red wine vinegar a dash of frank red hot and add fresh garlic and salt and pepper also a lil olive oil...green onion goes great as well! Tastes best when left to marinade for 4 hours or so. thanks so much for the recipe!  :))

This is my new favorite thing to bring to parties!! Everyone loves it and it's gone within minutes!! I modify the recipe a little - I use 1 can white corn, .5 cup frozen yellow corn, pickled jalepenos (approx. 1/4 cup), approx 1 whole diced sweet onion, 1/4 cup cilantro chopped finely, 1/4 cup green onions chopped finely, 2-3 tomatoes, 1 cup black eyed peas, .5 to .75 cup shredded cheddar cheese and almost entire reg. bottle Kens Italian Dressing.  This is such a great recipe because of all the flavors, it's like nothing you've tasted before!! Definitely a party hit!!

Excellent!  My children, myself, and my husband all loved this dish.  I used about half of the italian dressing called for (that was plenty) and squeezed in the juice of one lime.  I also used fresh jalapeno instead of pickled.  I absolutely will be making this one again!

Delicious and simple.  I used fresh jalapeno peppers and black eyed peas that I soaked overnight then boiled in homemade chicken stock.   If you use reduced fat dressing, this is practically a Zero-point item on the Weight Watchers Simply Filling program.

I loved this!  I did do some changes - I used green onion instead of white, fresh jalapenos instead of jar.  I added a CUP of shelled sunflower seeds!  Only used 3/4 cup of Italian salad dressing.  I think next time I will use more corn, maybe.  I saved the juices from the beans, peas, and tomatoes and used it in soup!!!  This was such a real hit when I served it everyone wanted the recipe.

This is very good.  It makes a HUGE bowl... a lot more than shown in the pic, at least 10 servings.  I added the zest and juice of one lime, and made sure to add enough cilantro that you got some in each bite!

Very Good!!  Made 30 hours in advance of party. I was worried that might have been too far in advance...but it was excellent.  Many comments and questions on the recipe.  For the Italian dressing I used the 'good seasons' dressing packet mix.  To keep Italian dressing from separating, I first whirled dressing for a couple of seconds in blender prior to pouring over beans.     I used the trades joe's frozen fire roasted corn, as was previously suggested.  The fire roasted flavor was great addition.  (someone even asked me how I had roasted the corn)  I served this as an appetizer with Tostitos white corn chip scoops.  I was planning  to serve with Fritos scoops, but when I sampled it with the  Fritos, it  really overpowered it and made it taste 'off'.   Luckily I had time to send my son to the  store to pick up other chips :) The tostitos scoops are lighter and seemed to play better with the marinade.      It says serving size of 8, but as an appetizer it serves more like 20.  I've had similar appetizers, but this one is a great recipe.  Thanks!

Yummy. It is a bit mushy, but I served it over rice which absorbed the liquid.

So delicious.  I made this for a 4th of July potluck, it competed against two other bean salads and won!  I think it has a bit too much dressing, I had to drain some liquid off before serving. I omitted the pickled jalapeno peppers. Delicious in a taco salad!

The best fresh salsa dip recipe ever! I've made this many times and always get asked for the recipe. I substitute a 4 oz. jar of grn chiles for the jalapenos otherwise it is VERY spicy! It is good on burgers and quesadillas too!

Didn't like this at all.  Made it as directed but I should have used my own judgement and left out the cilantro and use only half the pepper and onion.

I've been making this for several years now and decided it was time to review it.  I first learned about it from another source, but now use this recipe exclusively since I have gotten rid of all my cookbooks and only use Allrecipes.  I have had requests for the recipe from every place I have brought it.  I follow the recipe exactly, using a fat free Italian dressing when I have it.  I also have found that if I don't remove the seeds from the jalapeno peppers, it's too hot for my family's taste.

YUMMY!!!!  I like to call this redneck caviar...being from the south.  I could eat this stuff everyday, and it is good for you too!  Made exactly as the recipe was written.  Don't leave out the black eyed peas like other have said.  Trust me, I really don't care for them either, but they don't taste like black eyed peas when they are mixed up with everything.  You will love it!

Super easy and very good. This recipe always gets compliments and is eaten up.  Like others I used only 1/2 cup calorie wise Kraft Zesty Italian dressing. I also omit the black eyed peas and use pinto beans or more black beans also add a diced red pepper. I have also turned this in to a great chicken chili recipe. I add this recipe ( I use the 1 cup dressing for this) plus 3 cubes chicken breasts in slow cooker on high for 5-6 hours

Tasted great, everyone raved at my bbq. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I had to make due with some variations. People liked the spice, without it being overwhelming. I think ancho chile might also be good.

What a hit at a recent party and with all three of my picky Girls!  Instead of the "garlic salt" I added garlic powder and a sprinkling of celery seed.  With the cilantro ... make sure it's fresh!  Fresh makes a world of difference!  YUMMY!  I did have some leftovers [about a cup +] and made a terrific soup the next day by adding a package of Ramen noodles [no flavor packet used] and just enough water.  Very, very filling and very, very good!

Of all the cowboy caviar-type recipes here on allrecipes, I've found this one best suits my tastes and it's a huge hit at our church dinners. Pastor can't get enough :) I make it exactly as posted, only exchanging all black beans since black-eyed peas aren't a favorite with me. Thanks so much for sharing!

Excellent recipe..used Rotel tomatoes with green chilis and used diced red onion. I used frozen corn and just ran cold water over to thaw, and used olive oil rather than the Italian dressing.  You might want to start out with about 1/2 cup olive oil and store overnight in the fridge.  The next day, add additional olive oil to get the consistency you want.  Excellent with pita chips!!

I made some changes, some intentional and unintentional, to this recipe and it came out PERFECT! I used all black beans on purpose, because I wanted this to be more like a traditional salsa. Plus I prefer raw red bell pepper to raw green because the taste is less harsh to me. Now onto my mistakes -- I added nearly a whole pepper by accident because I didn't notice the recipe only called for a fourth. I also didn't notice there was onion in the recipe so I accidentally left it out. I used garlic powder and salt separately to taste. 

I didn't measure anything, so this recipe is pretty much foolproof and very adaptable. 

This really does change on the second day. The first day it tastes exactly like the ingredients, nothing more, nothing less. The second day it turns into a medley of awesome.

I made this for a beach picnic with my boyfriend, and he almost begged for the leftovers (It makes a HUGE amount for two people, even though we vegetarians used it as a light entree). Serving suggestion: Tostitos Scoops!

I used Kraft Zesty dressing because it came in a perfect-sized 8 ounce container.

Very tasty!  I used less jalapeno because mine were home-canned and very hot.  I also added about a tablespoon of sugar.  I love to have this in the fridge for a quick snack.  It's also good on a tossed lettuce salad.

This was great!   I made just a couple changes, but I'm sure if you followed the recipe it'd be just as great! I didn't add as much italian dressing, and added a little more garlic salt.  Next time I think I'll use fresh grape tomatos instead of canned diced. I served this as an appetizer on taco night and it was definitely a hit!

This was a flavorful salsa/pico to make! I changed a few things: I added 1/4 cup more cilantro and jalapenos and squeezed a whole lime into the mix. I used Wishbone Robusto Italian (gluten-free) this time, but making your own vinegar/oil based Italian dressing works well too. I'd add more tomatoes next time for sure. In the summer, I will make this with all fresh vegetables. This was a great recipe that looks wonderfully colorful. Thanks for sharing!

This was fairly easy to make and it came out pretty well, but I put on a whole cup of Italian dressing and it was WAY too much.  It was swimming in dressing.  I put it in a colander to drain the dressing and after that the salad was much improved.  Otherwise, it was quite good.

Great! Minor changes: Subbed red pepper for green, jarred garlic for salt, Rotel tomatoes for regular. Added dressing only to taste. It's important to let it marinate overnight for flavors to meld. After that it is wonderful!

Don't forget to bring tortilla chips for dipping! Great base recipe and so easy to change up. My changes: Omit garlic salt and jalapenos, add fresh garlic, sea salt, and canned diced chilis (the kids aren't always down with the spicy!) And if I'm feeling extra sassy, I'll add diced avocado! People ALWAYS ask for the recipe.

Love this recipe.  I use pintos instead of black eyed peas and also use red/orange bell pepper (personal preference and it gived it great color).  I was skeptical the first time I read this recipe regarding the Italian Dressing....but it is great! The last time I made this, I made it a fancy appetizer by adding rock shrimp and serving in a martini glass....very versatile..thanks Pam for posting!

I have to say, if I can I  use  "fresh" tomatoes it gives it a much better flavor and look.

This is delicious.  I didn't follow the recipe precisely. I chucked the onion, a whole red bell pepper, a handful of green onions and a handful of cilantro in the food processor and chopped it all together, then just mixed that with the beans, corn and dressing. I was skeptical about the Italian dressing, but trusted others' reviews that the Kraft Zesty Italian was the way to go, and it was fantastic.

So Good! I just used what I had, no measurements. Black eyed peas, corn, canned tomatoes, ground red pepper, italian dressing, avocado. Mixed it up, baked corn tortillas - 10 minutes in the oven on each side. Really, it's that easy. Doesn't even need to marinate.

I have made this recipe many times.  I only wish it was easier to reduce the serving size but tough to do with all of the canned ingredients.  I like to add additional jalapenos as the base recipe doesn't have a lot of kick.  I typically drop in some red pepper sauce as well. Sometimes substitute black-eyed peas with chili beans, just a personal preference.   Outstanding appetizer and healthy too.

Absolutely delicious! I made this recipe for the superbowl and it was a huge success! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Definitely a keeper. Note: I used light Italian dressing to reduce the fat content and it was just as good!

Excellent!! I went by the recipe for everything except the garlic salt and instead added some jarred chopped garlic, and I also made my own Italian dressing from a packet instead of using it from a bottle. This is cheap, easy, and yummy! I will likely keep a bowl of this made in the fridge from now on!

Have made this several times and it's always a winner. I use no fat italian dressing and cut amount to 1/2 cup, tastes fine.   Have also used navy and pinto beans, makes no difference - still wonderful!

I am always surprised how fast this disappears! When I have the time I make some small changes such as replacing garlic salt with fresh garlic sauteed with the onions, charring the corn in a hot skillet, replacing the jalapenos with some roasted hatch chiles, and replacing the dressing with some EVOO and balsamic.  Recipe is a winner

Absolutely delicious !  I was wary about the whole cup of Italian dressing, but it worked great !  I also added a diced avocado and a dribble of lime juice.  This is one I'll be making again.  Thank you !

I made this and took it to school to share with my fellow workers.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and reduced the jalepenòs to 1 tbsp. for those like me who don't like it too spicy.  Excellent recipe.  I make it over and over!

I love all things SPICY, but since the kids were eating this one too I used 1/4 Cup of Jalepeno Slices. The kids loved it and so did I. With less jalapenos it still pleanty of kick!

My husband and guests laughed at the name of this appetizer- but LOVED it!  I left out the corn and bell peppers, used fresh jalapenos (chopped and seeded) as well as fresh garlic, and added two tablespoons of cider vinegar.  Didn't have fresh cilantro, though, but used about a tablespoon of dried.  This made a lot, but mixed up with rice as a side dish the next day was fantastic!

I use Ken's Italian dressing. After making this a few times, I've settled at using half the specified amount of dressing, or just 1/2 cup. 

And instead of frozen corn, I use two cans of corn.

I made this yesterday for a Memorial Day BBQ. Although I had never made it, I just followed the simple recipe and overheard several people saying 'This is incredible'.  A couple of pointers....I made sure to rinse and drain the beans and corn really well until no water dripped from the colander when I shook it.  While I was gathering veggies from the refrigerator I remembered I had pepper jack cheese and decided to add chopped very small. Although I doubled the recipe, I only  added about 3/4 cup of zesty dressing,  mixed it up well and then refrigerated everything.  I stirred it around after several hours in the refrigerator  and noticed that it didn't need any more dressing.  I made sure to stir it three or four times over a six hour time period  to make sure everything was well coated.  I would definitely make this again!

Love this recipe!  To make it my own I sub one can of shoe peg corn for the 2 cups frozen and make my own dressing with olive oil, wine vinegar (red or white, both are fine), garlic sale, sugar, salt and pepper.  I also gee all of the canned veggies a quick reins (except for the tomatoes.   This recipe is always a big hit at family functions.

Yum!  I had to alter the ingredients a bit to what I had on hand, but the base recipe is great for a hot summer meal or snack.  I used seeded diced cucumber and sweet mini yellow peppers instead of the green pepper and jalapeno.  I also added one chopped avocado and a couple shakes of Tapatio for a bit of heat.  Even my 5 year old gobbled it up!

I used Tahini dressing and red onions. I think I used dried parsley because that's what was on hand. I also added red kidney beans and omitted jalapeno. I look forward to trying it with fresh cilantro.

This is a family favorite! We never eat black eyed peas & I don't like bell peppers.  That said, this recipe is fantastic.  The flavors blend together so well, that I never taste the things I don't like.  We put it on tacos, hamburgers, sloppy joes. I have even used it as a salsa topping for tilapia. Corn chips are superb with it.  I use the diced jalapenos in a jar, usually 1 whole bell pepper, and rather than measure the cilantro I just chop up the whole bunch.

What a great recipe! Always a hit at my house and has been for years - HOWEVER...if you are looking for a comparable appetizer in a jar, check out Cowboy Caviar at www.cowboycaviar.com It is a vegetable spread made with 100% Fresh Vegetables and I have started using it both as an appetizer and as a garnish for other appetizers!

This was really good and very easily prepared! Made a great side dish. I served it with grilled salmon and shrimp. I subsituted fat-free Italian dressing also, and you couldn't taste any difference.

I've made this twice in the last 2 weeks and can't stop eating it. I used fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden. I omitted the black-eyed peas and used extra black beans instead. Adjust the jalapenos to your taste, I only used a tablespoon and it was plenty spicy for me. I served this as an appetizer/ dip with scoops corn chips. A winner!!

Yummy!  I used fresh Jalapenos instead of pickled.  Next time I will use red onions (or green) and maybe add chopped black olives.  This was a great recipe.

OMG this was soooo good! Needs MORE cilantro and onions though. A little wary about the Italian (what?!) dressing but it was fine. I have to twist my husbands arm to eat vegetables however I couldn't keep him out of this - he LOVED it! Way easy to make! It is a keeper!

I made a double batch to bring to work and it was all gone by lunch time! I did tweek it a little. I added the juice of one lime, left out the cilantro, and added diced green chiles instead of the jalapenos, then simply served it with tortilla chips.

Outstanding.  I only used about half of the italian dressing, that was plenty.  I ate this for dinner one night!  Would be wonderful with grilled chicken.

Very, very tasty!  Omitted the cilantro (personal taste).  Easy recipe that gets better as it sits.  We had some leftover spaghetti noodles that we sliced up a bit and threw in the following day.  It was fantastic!  I thought I had Zesty or Robusto Italian dressing but didn't.  I would've used that instead of straight Italian but it wasn't even missed.  It was quite "robusto" enough on its own.  Thank you!

This is an awesome recipe.  I bring it everywhere and always get asked for the recipe.  I don't like tomatoes so I use roasted red peppers in their place.  I also use fat free Italian dressing and serve it with baked scoops. This makes it a very healthy snack to bring, without anyone thinking they're eating healthy.  I sometimes mix this recipe with lettuce and reduced fat cheese for an awesome southwestern salad.  That gets rave reviews also.  There are many variations on this recipe, but I like this one the best.  Always go for the fresh cilantro as it makes it taste so fresh!

When I make this, everyone raves. They think that it takes a long time to make.  I almost want to tell them that it did, just to impress.  But then they ask for the recipe, and find out the truth.  I even had a Cardiologist compliment me on this one!

We LOVE LOVE LOVE this salsa....although I use 6 Roma Tomatoes instead of canned and I also substitute green onion for white. I always make a double batch for crowds...otherwise we run out fast. Our favorite chips are the Scoops hint of jalepeno. Tasty!

I make this a lot and always get asked for the recipe.  I used a canned tomato with jalepeno (drained) and then don't add jalepenos.  I also use a roasted red pepper vinagrette.  Kraft makes one as well as Safeway Select.  I always serve with Scoops but I have had people that eat it as a salad. I always have most everything on hand because it makes a quick last minute appetizer to bring.

I am not much of a cook AT ALL but I love this recipe. An equally kitchenly-challenged friend of mine recommended this recipe and told me it was SUPER easy and that I should definitely be able to handle it ( I can , after all, manage to use a can opener successfully!). I just got done and pretty much went with the recipe. I followed another contributor's suggestion that lime juice be used and I happened to have a lime so I squeezed it in. Other than that, I just went with the original recipe.. I tried it after 20 minutes and just added salt. I'm bringing it to a party tomorrow and am rather certain it will be a hit--wish me luck!

This was delicious.  I didn't use corn or green peppers.  I made it and left it in the fridge overnight before eating it, and the next day it didn't look appealing, but it was delicious.  It gets better over time.

I thought this was great, but I made a few modifications.  I left out the corn (didn't have any), and made my own Italian salad dressing with olive oil, cider vinegar, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  Also, I don't like cilantro, so left that out too - this is a pretty versatile dish - you could serve it as a dip or a side dish.  Ymmm!  I highly recommend this.

This recipe is always a favorite... and it is SO easy too!  I added an avocado and used fat free zesty Italian dressing.  It's always best the next day once the flavors mesh, so if you have time to plan that much ahead, make it the day before.  It's still excellent when served immediately though!  I make this sometimes for just the 2 people in my house and use the it for lunch and make a salad with the cowboy caviar, lettuce, slices of grilled chicken, and fat free ranch, OR make quesadillas with it.  YUUUUUM!

I made this for a church potluck and everyone asked for the recipe! It's great too because it's flavorful but not too spicy.  My daughter who is 2 has a ton of food allergies loved eating this and it provides lots of fiber and vitamins!  You can also add more heat for people like my husband.  This is a great dip that you don't have to feel guilty about...oh and definately set it overnight for the flavors to mingle..thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Make this recipe the night before to let the flavors meld.  Before serving add chopped avocado that has been drizzled with lime juice.  The recipe is my guaranteed favorite crowd pleaser!

I made it by the book. My 11 year old and l didn’t like the Italian dressing but everyone else did. I used 6 cut up avocados. I have pictures. If l make this recipe again, l will try something different and use Rotel instead of Italian dressing.

My version was not as soupy as your photo as I drained my canned veggies well. I added minced garlic, instead of garlic salt, minced cucumber, mixed fresh green & red peppers and garbanzos beans. I omitted the hot peppers as my group, as a whole, would not have liked that. It tasted very fresh. I received multiple complements on this. Pretty much a favorite! I will make it again.

This was a great dip.  Brought it to a Super Bowl party and there was nothing left.  I only used 1/2 the Italian salad dressing and I think that was plenty.

This has become my "go to" for parties where we're asked to bring "a dish."  I found frozen roasted corn which ads some texture.  I also diced a large avocado, and added a tablespoon of lime juice.  I then marinate it overnight in a gallon ziplock bag after squeezing as much air out as possible.  Fritos Scoops is an excellent suggestion for serving.

So yummy! I added white beans,  skipped the tomato, and reduced the Italian dressing a lot (I didn't want it so wet). This was still VERY VERY tasty!

This recipe was not a disappointment, at all. We make versions of this here quite often, in the summer. This is also a nice recipe to take to gatherings. When having at home, we tweak a bit to suit our own tastes, and I love that my husband will grab a bowl of this and some tortilla chips, versus the container of Oreos.  This keeps well, and is better if it rests for awhile, a few hours or overnight.

This was easy and great!  A 'fresh' salsa with a lighter taste, and it is healthy to boot.  Easy to make and popular as a group feeding dip.

I made this a few times this week end , for the fight and for another gathering. came out amazing i added a few things like i always do. i usisally take recipe and add my own player to it I added avocado as a garnish to this Italian salad dressing different types of bell peppers red yellow and orange although my last one I put green in it. Either way you can't go wrong with this recipe remember to drain it though because it will get soggy with all the ingredients we used organic blue corn chips with it again you can't go wrong it was amazing

I omitted the black eyed peas for another can of black beans.  Did 2 10-11oz cans of tomatoes with green chilis, omitted the green bell pepper.  Subbed the onion for a grated shallot, added a grated clove of garlic, a diced fresh jalapeño instead of pickled, and the juice of one lime.  Also added salt, pepper, and cumin to taste.

I add a whole green pepper, used a bag of cooked steam fresh sweet corn, used fresh jalapeño and used garlic powder and regular salt. I use Kraft Zesty Italian. I add a squeeze of lime. It's a hit wherever we go especially with lime flavored tortilla chips!

Delicious! I made this with what I had on hand: fire roasted tomatoes, Olive Garden dressing, no cilantro, and subbed canned green chili peppers for jalapeños. This is so simple, so delicious, and so much better for me than my usual cheese dip. ;)

5 star is with my dressing otherwise it would be a 3 for me.
I used 1/2 bunch of cilantro, eliminated the  canned tomatoes and used 3 roma tomatoes chopped.  Instead of bottled dressing I added 2 tbsp olive oil, 1 lime juiced, 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar. It was a hit at my party

This is my go-to recipe. I love to take this for 
food days at work and for family functions. It's delicious. You can make it hotter by using jalapenos or you can make it mild by using green chiles. We are not big fans of cilantro, so we just leave it out. Delicious! Love it! It also makes a huge portion. Plenty for friends/family  to take leftovers.

Wonderful side dish/salad, really interesting and fresh flavors. The cilantro and jalapeño give it that oomph. I'm bringing it to a pig roast on 4th of July weekend. Perfect and REALLY easy.

I did rinse all canned veggies.. Fresh cilantro and line juice is a must. Adjust heat by removing or leaving seeds and ribs in peppers. The longer it marinates the better it is. My family loved it!

This is a summer staple around our house.  I put everything but the kitchen sink in this one and it is always good.  I usually make a double batch and substitute banana peppers for the jalapeno peppers.

Followed the directions exactly. Prepared earlier in the day for a dinner appetizer at a friend's and everyone loved it! Will definitely make again!

So amazing!!!  I did chop the rotel tomatos more than they already were in the can, they go further and match the sizes of the other ingredients better.

This is possibly the best "salsa" in the world. I threw in diced avocados, extra back beans, went light on jalepenos and made my own Italian dressing.  Rave reviews from every one. We ate it with chips made of white and black beans. Amazing!!!!

I have made this several times and I find it amusing how people have to be talked into trying it.  Once you can get someone to try it, they are hooked.  
It is important to make this a day ahead to allow the flavors to blend.  And, I substitute a 4oz can of diced jalapenos for the pickled jalapenos.  
Double up this recipe - you will go through it quickly.

I took this to a bbq and there were two other similar dishes.  This recipe was the best.  I highly recommend using Trader Joe's roasted frozen corn kernels.  I used Trader Joe's Tuscan Italian dressing.  I felt like I should have used roma tomatoes instead of canned, but it was still good.  I'll bet using dry black beans (soaked and cooked of course) would have had even better presentation since canned veges lose so much color.

Easy, delicious, and multiplies easily for a crowd!  Substitutions work well.  I use fresh garlic (in lieu of salt) and serve with a big chunk of avocado.

Amazing - I couldn't believe how good it tasted.  I had had a black-eyed pea salad at catered event and thought it was good so I was looking for a recipe to duplicate it and stumbled across this.  This is even better.  I didn't have any cilantro, so I omitted that and used a little cumin to add some flavor.  

We were fighting to see who got to take the left-overs in their lunch as we both could have just eaten a big plate of this for dinner.

FWIW - I goes great with Grilled Okra.

I've made this recipe before and its great. For my family I have to cut down on the cilantro though. Not everyone likes it. I used red, yellow, orange, and green peppers just to make it more colorful.

Liked this recipe very much.  I made my own salad dressing with apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, oil, poppy and sesame seeds, and sugar.  Next time I make it, I am going to add a can of pinto beans, as well.

I boiled dried beans, used fresh tomatoes from the garden, fresh jalapeño, fresh garlic, and red onion and it turned out great!  I also used about 1/3 of the Italian Dressing and added lime juice.  I left out the cilantro because I can't stand it's smell ever since stink bugs infested Maryland.  Too bad - I used to love cilantro before then.

I prefer this recipe with a couple of changes - leave out the corn and cilantro, add some green onions and replace the Italian dressing with Asian Toasted Sesame dressing - a friend of my recommended that dressing and I LOVE it . Marinate for several hours or longer in the fridge.

Tasty. If we had the capability to rate in half steps (e.g. as with Red Box video), I'd bump this up to 3.5 stars. Prefer the "Uptown Cowboy Caviar" from this site, altho I've settled on a hybrid with my own tweaks.

Basic recipe is very solid base to start with.  I've just changed to two cans of diced tomatoes and chilies. One hot (habaneros) and one medium to ramp up the heat a little.

I decided to cook this recipe because it was so popular and I needed something to do with all of the beans my father-in-law grew in his garden this year. I didn't really pay attention to the preparation until after I bought the ingredients to make it. I was a little skeptical but....TURNED OUT GREAT! I will use a little less dressing next time though!

This is really delicious!  Great dip for the summer!!  We have been making a container of it and taking it to the beach.  It is a hit with everyone and very easy to make.
