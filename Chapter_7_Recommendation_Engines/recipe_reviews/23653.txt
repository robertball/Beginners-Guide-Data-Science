Wow!  This was great.  Creamy and full flavored but not overly sweet.  I typically make it exactly as written.  This last time I toasted about 1/3 cup coconut in the oven for 3 minutes after I took out the pie crust and put this on top to change the looks of the pie.  I haven't tried it yet, but as far as looks are concerned, it's far more attractive.

This recipe was tastey, but the consistency was kind of watery, and it needs some type of extra whipped topping on it to protect the batter from sliding everywhere, especially if your transporting it.

This was pretty good, but not what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly, only adding vanilla, but it is more of a coconut custard pie than a cream pie.  It is very dense and eggy in my opinion, but my family enjoyed it very much.  I will continue to look for a fluffy coconut cream pie.

SUPER GOOD!  I'M NOT A COOK AND THIS IS SO EASY AND DELICIOUS THAT I CAN'T BELIVE I MADE IT.  I USED THE COCONUT MILK INSTED OF HALF AND HALF AND I USED CORN STARCH NO FLOUR.  I ALSO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF COCONUT FLAVOR AND NO EGGS.

This pie was really good. My boyfriend doesn't like coconut but thought the pie was great. The consistency was perfect. Not watery at all. The longer the custard is cooked, the thicker it becomes.

I made this pie for Christmas dinner, and it was so good!  It was much easier than other coconut pie recipes I've tried.  I saved the egg whites from the yolks for the custard and made meringue for the top.  Other recipes I have tried have been watery or bland, but this had an excellent flavor and made a firm but creamy custard.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for coconut pie (my husband's favorite pie).

I made this for Easter dinner and it was pretty good. This is the first time I have ever made a coconut cream pie successfully. I felt it had a little too much coconut though. I think next time I will use half the amount. But I will definately make this again.

This recipe was fantastic! I did, however, make a few changes.  I use agave necter for a sweetener, and I used one (19 oz.) can of coconut milk instead of the milk and cream. I used cornstarch instead of flour. I mixed the agave, cornstarch, and coconut milk (which I had heated first) together in a double boiler. after it had heated I added a cup or so of this mixture to the beaten eggs, then added the eggs to the mixture in the double boiler and cooked until thick. After I had added the coconut and vanilla, I beat in a 8oz pkg of cream cheese and then added the toasted coconut on top...it was absolutely the best coconut cream pie I have ever tasted!

Was absoloutly delicious.  I didnt use quite all the coconut, as it would have been a bit too heavy.  Aside from that, this was a perfect coconut cream pie recipe!

Funny how many people thought it was too runny. . . mine was thick and spreadable when poured into the pie crust. I used skim milk for the "milk" and it still turned out rich. I used the rest of my carton of heavy cream and made whipped cream for the top of the pie and sprinkled toasted coconut on top. Definitely not your conventional coconut cream pie but tasty!

I've had better coconut cream pies. It's still very good and very easy to make. It's a little too rich for my taste.

I did make some changes to the recipe. Probably pretty important. 
First off, I used only One cup of milk and Two thirds cup of heavy cream. Also only used Three yolks. After I finish mixing I added a couple scoops of Cool Whip. No clue how much just tossed a couple tablespoonfuls. Turned out wonderfully.

This was VERY dense.  I made two pies at Thanksgiving, this one and a Coconut Custard and my Custard was lighter and fluffier than this recipe.  It tasted good but it just isn't what I think of when I think of coconut pie.

MMMMMM. I can still taste the beautiful flavoursof this pie in my mouth. When I was told about this recipe someone said it was nice but not sweet enough. When I tasted it I thpught it was creamy but not too sweet and the concictancy was nearly right but it was just a bit watery. The family will enjoy this!

I thought this turned our really well. I got a tip off a cooking blog on the internet and used the microwave to toast the sweetened coconut at 30 second intervals mixing it around with a fork in between. That turned out really well. I topped the pie with real whipped cream (from a can) and the toasted coconut. The filling has a great taste, but I would like to try the recipe next time with unsweetened coconut.

I have made this recipe many times. I did not change a thing. It is better by far than any pie You would order in a restaurant or buy in a bake shop. I have been asked to bake some for anniversary dinners and many special events.

Pretty good recipe, might make again, but needs a fresh whipped cream topping to cut the sweetness a bit.

It wasn't like a custard. It was a weird flour-y, but nicely thickened, glob. Flavor was fine. Texture was funkalicious.

Tasty and easy to make. I used 2/3 cup of whipping cream and 11/3 cup of milk. Also added a cap full of vanilla. I would make the custard again on its own. Great pie. Add some fresh whip cream and toasted coconut on top and it's heaven on your plate.

Very good! I even messed up and added the eggs and milk all at the same time; I just kept stiring over the heat and it still set up to a perfect custard consistancy. Will make again.
