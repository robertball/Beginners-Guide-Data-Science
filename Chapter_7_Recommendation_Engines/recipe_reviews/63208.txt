This recipe is wonderful, and so easy!  I served it with a baked ham for valentine's day (thus, the red color).  I added 1/2 cup of chopped bing cherries (you can buy them in a can during the off season), and 3/4 cup of raisins.  Kept warm all day without separating.  I used the remainder to marinate some chicken next day before grilling.  Wonderful flavor.  A keeper!!

very nice way to add to ham did not put directly on ham but offered in a dish on the side
