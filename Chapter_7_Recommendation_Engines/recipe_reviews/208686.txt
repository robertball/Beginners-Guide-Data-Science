I liked the Avocado Aioli but not with the salmon. Would use the Aioli on toast or crackers.

I used 1.5 tsp ground ginger since I didn't have fresh on hand. I used halibut and broiled, coating the fish with sesame oil instead of olive. I served the fish topped with the aioli, hoisin, and seeds as directed. I skipped the lettuce and bread. My fish was cooked perfectly and I thought the dish was good. My hubby had a thicker piece and it needed to go back in the broiler -- topping and all -- for a a couple more minutes. He said that it was good before but phenomenal after the topping was broiled. He said with the broiled topping, it is 5 stars.
