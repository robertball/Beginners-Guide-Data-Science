Really simple to make and so good!  I made this with 2 mangos so I increased the amounts slightly.  Also, I didn't have Roma or Serrano, so I used regular tomato and jalapeno.  Great on grilled chicken breasts with brown rice!!

My friends stopped using chips and grabbed a spoon instead. I didn't change anything and it came out great.

Really simple and really tasty. Nice and refreshing for the summer. Definitely tastes better the day after. I also added a little bit of rice vinegar to mine.
