Now that was a tasty dish.  Well worth a trip to the Asian market for the spice.  I had my skillet hot, but it took about 10 -12 minutes at high heat on my commercial range.  Easy to make, don't skip on the green onion garnish, it completes the taste of the dish with perfection.

This is a very good recipe.  I have never found Korean red pepper, so I use 1/2 tsp. crushed red peppers, instead.  I, also, use an apple instead of a pear with the same basic effect and is readily available. I use only a tsp of fresh ginger.  You can add a few veggies like carrots.  I sometimes make it with chicken.

This was very good!  Some things I will do next time:  marinate for 3 hrs, it just needed a little more time.  Make sure you use the fan on the stove and open the windows; a very hot cast iron pan will work perfectly for caramelizing but prepare for the smoke alarm!  This beef dish is simple and quick to cook; you will love the amazing flavors, remember to keep it rare for best results.

Made this tonight just as the recipe stated. We were able to find the Korean red pepper at a Kroger store called frys. The pear was called an apple pear at our store. The meat we used was boneless country style ribs and it turned out so tender and amazing. I let it marinade for about 4 hours and it was very delicious. I highly recommend this recipe and we will be making again.

I used a flank steak that was about a pound and a half, so only marinated for one hour. Initially, I wasn't sure whether to give this four or five stars. However, we had some left over and I used it for sandwiches the next day with good rolls, pickled veggies, and spicy mayo. They were outstanding. My regular grocery does carry gochugaro, but it was about three times as expensive as the Asian market. If you have an Asian market in your area, try them out. Big variety and big savings.

This is the closest I have made to authentic Mongolian Beef. I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn’t have a pear or apple, but I did find a little pack of unsweetened applesauce in the pantry. It turned out perfect. My husband was picking all the little scraps off the platter when we were done. I used a 2 1/2 lb chuck roast and put in the freezer while I doubled the marinade. Just long enough to make easier to slice thin. This will certainly go in the rotation. Yum! Don’t forget the green onions; they’re a must!

I used low sodium soy, and did not use any additional salt. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe as stated.
I put the meat in the freezer to firm it up,  then slice it, a quart of an inch thick. Used a cast iron pan, the meat came out terrific.

Love this recipe!!! Came out perfect, even with my budget-friendly restrictions. I used 2 pounds of beef, 5 1/4 tsp minced garlic, 4 green onions, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 3/8 cup soy sauce, and 3/8 cup teriyaki sauce. I cut the beef into 1/4 inch thick strips with scissors and marinated them for 5 hours. Definitely going to make this again!!!

This was very, very good, albeit a bit salty.  I think I will use a low-sodium soy sauce next time to see what happens.  Other than that, it was delicious and tender.  Extremely flavorful, too!  I loved the carmelization on the meat.  I served this on Korean black (purple) rice, and we loved it!  This is a great weeknight dinner, just be sure to allow time for marinating!

Wife and kids loved it. I was going to use a commercial jar of bulgogi sauce, but was shamed into not using it as it had a lot of corn syrup ( listed twice for some reason ??). The only thing I couldn’t get was the Korean pepper. I found gochujang chili sauce at the store and thought it might be a close second.

I marinated about 3 hours, and cooked the meat a little longer, as I sliced it thicker.  It turned out delicious!

I tried this with sliced peices of chuck steak it it was great! I marinated only 2 hours and it came out really tender. I served it over white rice. I agree with others to open the windows and have that vent on high or else that flavor will be hanging around into the next day. We will be doing this again and will look for some good Asian noodles to serve it over.

I've made this twice now, and it's delicious. My wife loves it, and says it's as good as what we've gotten at a local Korean BBQ place that's very highly regarded.

One thing I should note is that a full tablespoon of the red pepper flakes seemed like a bit much, so I made it the first time with only half a teaspoon (yes, 1/6th the called for amount). That gave it some good flavor without making it too spicy for my wife's sensitive palate. The second time I made it with a full teaspoon, and that definitely gave it a nice bit of heat, without being overwhelming (though it was a tad on the spicy side for my wife). Anyway, if I were making it just for me, I'd probably bump it up to a teaspoon and a half, but no more. I really like spicy foods, but a full tablespoon I'm sure would be too much, even for me.

I've used this recipe many times now, using the same cut of meat or other tough cuts of beef already pre-sliced in the grocery. A huge hit. And yes without a fan your house will smell like Korean bbq for a couple of days. Worth it. :-) Oh, try it with Chef John's Persian Rice!

Great recipe.  It did require a trip to  the grocery store since I don't have some of the ingredients in my pantry.  Yet the trip was so worth it.  Flavorful and ever so worth it.

Very good recipe!!  This is my go to recipe for Bulgogi!!  I do double the brown sugar because I like it a little sweeter. I can’t get the spice locally, so I use Togarashi instead at about 1/2 tablespoon. Thanks Chef John!!

I really liked this.  I might add 2 TBS brown sugar next time.  My cast iron skillet was pretty hot and cooking two minutes per side gave me some very brown crispy pieces, even blackened a bit around the edges.  I enjoyed it that way but I'm not sure that's how it's supposed to come out.  Next time I may reduce the heat a bit on the skillet, and try cooking two minutes on one side and one minute on the other.  I made exactly as directed except I substituted flat iron steak.  It was very tender after a four hour marinade and a quick cooking.

I added a quartered onion and a green apple wedges to the marinade.  Then I chopped them and cooked them with the rice. I drizzled a spicy cheese sauce I made on top then added some quick pickled onions to the top. Perfect!
