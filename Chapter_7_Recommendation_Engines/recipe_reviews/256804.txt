This was a big hit with the band and band wives last night. It was incredibly easy to prep (measure, dump, stir, bake). I prepped ahead of time and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake (and then baked a touch longer, maybe 35 minutes?) and serve. I just can't do canned corn, so I used (thawed) white frozen in its stead. I don't like cilantro, so I left it off. I served it with both Tostitos and Fritos scoops. Thanks for the recipe, McCormick!

I doubled the recipe, using 1 bag of frozen, steamed in microwave corn, and skipped the feta cheese.  Everyone LOVED it!!

This is always a big hit when I make it for a potluck! I’ve started doubling the recipe and adding a can of rinsed black beans and the last couple times I’ve added leftover shredded rotisserie chicken. Never any leftovers!

Not great flavor or texture.  I almost decided to throw away the leftovers but decided to keep them in the fridge for an appropriate amount of time first so as not to feel guilty about wasting ingredients.

We loved this dip for Super Bowl!  Too bad the wrong team won - but this dip was a big hit!  Served with Frito's Scoops.
