I've been on AR for several years now & found lots of great recipes, but this is the 1st one that I said "Wow! I've got to rate this one!".  Thank you Anita!  My 4 yr old is allergic to peanuts & tree nuts so he had never had caramel corn before (but is a BIG popcorn fan).  He loved it - told me it was "quite good"--no, we're not British;)
Just a side note, two 3.5oz bags of microwave popcorn=7 quarts of popped corn.

Outstanding!!  I have made one similar to this for years.  One suggestion....use a turkey roaster and a stiff spoon to stir with.  The tall sides of the turkey roaster make it so much easier to do a good job stirring.  When you stir, make sure that you scrapt the bottom and sides of the roasting pan.  Hope this helps....

An easy way to coat the popcorn is to put the popped corn in a paper grocery bag and pour the caramel mixture over it and stir with a wooden spoon, then dump the mixture out onto your baking pan and throw the paper bag away.  I agree with another reviewer that 200 degrees is the right oven temp.  I bake it 45 minutes, stirring every 15.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe -- it's scrumpdillyicious! :)  Instead of 1/2 c. light Karo, I used 1/3 c. light Karo and 1/3 c. molasses.  This gave it a flavor absolutely identical to Cracker Jacks (I also used Spanish peanuts rather than dry roasted).  I used a large roasting pan and a jelly roll pan, placing the jelly roll pan on the bottom rack in the oven and the roasting pan on the rack just above it.  When you first pour the caramel over your corn, you'll think you'll never get it mixed up well....BUT...after the first 15 mins in the oven, it becomes thinner so that you can easily stir to combine.  After that, it progressively gets thicker and totally adheres to the popcorn.  Believe it or not, clean-up was a snap (I was pleasantly surprised!).  Just butter your pan very well and then rinse with hot water as soon as you finish.  I would definitely suggest using a good quality popcorn (rather than the cheaper type) so that you get nice fluffy, puffy pieces.  I used Orville's microwave butter popcorn, and it took about 2-1/2 bags to make 7 qts.  Thank you again...my entire family loves this recipe! :)

Update:
I am speechless....only because my mouth is stuffed with caramel corn. 
5 stars is not enough.
I followed other users tips.
1. Baked at 200 for 40-45 minutes stirring every 10-15 min.
2. Used butter instead of margarine.
3. Used a large roasting pan. Much easier for stirring.
4. I used a whisk for stirring but when adding the baking soda, I switched to a large spatula. That way you are able to get all the caramel out of the pan.
5. I made the caramel first then popped the popcorn. When the popcorn is hot it's easier to stir the caramel mixture into it. Be sure to remove any unpopped kernels.
6. Before you add the caramel sauce, drop 1 tbsp. of it on wax paper. Wait for it to cool down and you have a piece of homemade caramel just as a treat for you! Cuz you're worth it!
Pros: Best I've ever tried
Cons: Should have made two batches. One for me and one for the rest of the family.
Another con was waiting for it to cool down. I just couldn't stop picking at it.
Quality control is important you know.
This will be a new gift at Christmas time. And it's cheaper than buying it.
Thank you so much for sharing.

I've made twice.  The first was following the recipe exactly and it was AWESOME.  It was somewhere between caramel and toffee.  The second time, I realized (already into it) that I was out of brown sugar, so substituted white sugar and added 4T molasses.  It too was awesome and if you're looking for a Cracker Jack knock-off, the latter is the ticket.  Yum!

This is just the BEST caramel corn! I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn. After corn is popped, I place it in a large paper grocery bag and pour caramel mixture over it (stir with a wooden spoon).I also added some slivered almonds and some dried cranberries (yum).Poured mixture in jelly roll pan coated with nonstick spray. I baked for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 mins.
The next time, I might even try doubling the caramel topping.  If you like caramel corn, you'll LOVE this recipe. Thanks for the posting!

I've been making this recipe since 1979 and it IS the best caramel corn recipe I ever found!  I never use peanuts, though. I use almonds, cashews or pecans.  Do use butter - improves it so much,if you can believe that!
This is great to give in tins or those pretty decorative bags at Christmas!
Make  more than you think you'll need, because people will ask for more! :)

Very yummy.  I used Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop Kettle Corn popcorn for this recipe.  I lined one of the pans with foil, but ran out when I went to line the other pan.  On the unlined pan, the carmel drippings came off and mixed very well with the popcorn while I stirred it and also when I removed it from the pan.  The lined pan (even though it was greased) wasn't nearly as cooperative as the unlined pan.  It was even worth the washing.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I prefer this made with butter rather than margarine but otherwise thought this was really good.  I used about one and a half cups of unpopped corn & no nuts.

I'm the cook who posted this recipe and to those who had issues with the syrup being grainy...take heart!...I've had that happen to me once or twice too. I think that this happens when I'm impatient and try to bring everything to a boil too quickly and some of the sugar is not fully dissolved. I have also seen that boiling it too rapidly also seems to make the mixture want to crystalize. I recommend using a medium high heat (stoves will vary) just so that you have a nice SLOW bubbling boil going. Once crystalization happens there's nothing to do to reverse it so that batch is pretty much a gonner at that point. I've also read that humidity and heat (air temperature) play a roll in candy making and it is best to do this on cool dry days. Hopefully these tips will help.

For a great variation, I prefer to skip the dry roasted peanuts and add slivered almonds and dried cranberries (Craisins).  A wonderful hostess or teacher gift for the holidays!

There's a good reason this is a top recipe on AR.  It's simple, tasty & pretty quick.  Making it as listed in the recipe (minus using margarine) ... is pretty awesome - I've made several dozen batches over the years.  A few things I did to adjust it to make it my own that seem to be pretty popular with friends and family:
1)  Only use real butter - it makes it very rich & yummy.  I like handrolled fresh butter best.         
2) I add cayene pepper - sometimes just a dash, sometimes more; adds another warm layer of flavor & I don't even like spicy food that much - this addition seems to be most popular with everyone whose tried it.           
3) Adjust the salt to your liking - I add a bit more - I think it provides a bit more balance to sweet/salt.        
4) I add 1/2 tsp more baking soda .. it makes the mix very light and fluffy. Much easier on your teeth too.     
5)  Once it cools a bit in the pan, toss it around with your hands to loosen it up &  separate.  It keeps the kernels whole instead of breaking them up like a spoon does.  I wait 15 minutes after its out of the oven & test if its too hot, then toss it every 15 minutes a few times until hardened.  Don't wait too long - it clumps.    
I think the key to this recipe is to try it once, as is, &  then make adjustments on subsequent batches to make it your own.  Ive added peanut butter, substituted some of the corn syrup for maple syrup & have made some spiced with cinnamon and other spices.  All super yummy!

I love this recipe. The only thing I change is to use butter instead of margarine. Other than that, it's perfect. I always buy one of the large disposable aluminum pans which makes clean up a breeze. Another thing I do to minimize the number of unpopped kernels in the final product is to pour out my popped popcorn onto a wire cooling rack. The unpopped kernels fall through and the popped popcorn stays on top. Thanks for a great recipe!

Do yourself a favour and make this recipe. It seems like a pain but it's easy as anything and so delicious. I made them to give out for Halloween. I'll also give them for teacher gifts.

People who said this was chewy didn't cook the sugar enough. Invest in a candy thermometer and cook it until it gets to 250F. Also use the full hour. When you stir it every 15 minutes every kernel will get covered. Awesome awesome recipe.

Great recipe! I admit I was a little hesitant to make a full batch, but I'm thankful I did. We had our Youth Group over and they ate ever last kernel. I used butter instead of the margarine and skipped the peanuts (didn't have any in the house). 1 cup kernels equals approximately 7 quarts popped popcorn. The popcorn coated very nicely and evenly by the second stirring. I used one roasting pan and one jelly roll pan. I would use a 9x13 cake pan before I use a jelly roll pan again, too much spilling while attempting to stir. Thank you for the super yummy recipe! :)

I feel so badly reviewing this recipe with 3 stars!  Mine tasted kind of burnt.  I will definately try it again and cut down the cooking significantly.  My oven only goes down to 300 so I cut down the cooking time to only 25 minutes and stirred it often...still tasted burned.  I would NOT use margarine either...ICK!  I will for sure try it again though.  Thanks!

Update-I made this again with perfection.  I'll share my tips to perfect caramel corn!  It is a 10-star with my changes.  Maybe the first recipe was fine, but it just didn't work for me.  I used 2 bags of microwave popcorn (it was buttered) and picked out the popped corn.  I made the caramel exactly like the recipe except using real butter.  I greased two large baking sheets and set those aside.  I used a large paper grocery bag, sprayed the inside with Pam and dumped the popcorn in.  Then when the caramel was done i poured it into the bag, stirred and then shook the bag.  I dumped the coated corn out onto the prepared sheets.  The corn was totally covered!  I cooked it at 300 for about 19 minutes stirring every 5 minutes.  I used a large spatual to stir the corn as to get all the caramel off the bottom of the pan.  I think followed the directions for cooling the corn.  Perfection!!!!  I hope my tips help.

This was excellent! Great flavor, used real butter but I halved the recipe since I didn't want a huge amount. Two 3.5 bags of microwave popcorn were perfect. I kept the popcorn in a 200 degree oven until the caramel was done. Everything mixed easily, and cleanup was quick after a quick soak in  hot water. I will make again for Christmas gifts.

The only word I can come up with to describe this delicous treat is "decadent".  This is one of those recipes you can't mess up as long as you keep the oven temperature and the burner temperature low and keep stirring.  It was easy and clean-up was a breeze. Just poured the entire batch out into a party bowl and threw the disposable pan out!  This recipe yielded more than enough and is the best caramel popcorn I have ever tasted.  In comparison to storebought it is much better and so much fun to make.  I don't know if this made a difference in the taste, but I used 2 sticks of unsalted butter rather than margarine, in the recipe.  I used a disposable aluminum turkey pan and sprayed it generously with butter flavored PAM. I also sprayed the spoon before each stir. I used honey roasted  peanuts which worked well although next time I would like to try plain salted. Because sometimes my oven runs hot, I baked this at 200 degrees, again I dont' know if it made a difference. The one thing I didn't do that I regret was not sifting through the popcorn and removing the unpopped kernels BEFORE I poured the caramel over it. I had to be very careful about chomping down on an unpopped kernel and breaking a tooth and once these unpopped kernels are coated with the caramel they are almost impossible to spot. Other than that, I can't say enough about this recipe except that I will be doubling up for the holidays and giving it out to friends and neighbors as gifts.  This stuff stores great in

Now, to take it over the top, after the caramel corn has cooled, take 5 large (4.25oz) dark chocolate bars, melt 'em and drizzle over the caramel corn. I used hershey's special dark.  Once the chocolate has set up, ( you may need to pop it into the fridge for a few minutes) break it up and enjoy.

very tasty!  we used 3 1/2 bags of microwave popcorn, stirred the mixture in a large paper bag, and baked it at 200 degrees for 35-40 mins.  
If you have never worked with cooked sugar before just a warning that it is VERY touchy/time sensitive.  not enough time on the stove and the coating will be a bit grainy and miss that "deep" caramel flavor.  but if you leave it boiling too long, you end up getting a burnt sugar flavor and the coating will harden up REALLY fast out of the pot, making it hard to mix into the popcorn.  So make sure you do this without too many distractions around!

I've been making this recipe for years and had to finally write a review. Follow it exact. This is the best! I use 2 bags of microwave popcorn for 7 quarts.

This was incredibly simple to make... and SOOOOO amazingly good!!! I used just over a cup of unpopped popcorn, and was able to fill a cookie sheet, and 2 9x11 pans. There was enough syrup mixture to nicely coat all of that, so it made a LOT! Only thing I did different was to use half corn syrup, half blackstrap molasses (just because I love the taste of molasses)and it was just amazing. Served it to a bunch of friends and they were very impressed! Try this one for sure!!

Good caramel corn!  When you make this with molasses instead of light corn syrup it tastes just like the old-time corn, boxed with a toy inside.

Oh MY goodness!!!! This is SO addicting and SO incredibly delicious!! I made with honey roasted peanuts and butter instead of margarine, which made this popcorn even more wonderful than it already is!!!

This was so yummy I couldn't stop eating it last night!  The only change I made was to use maple syrup instead of corn syrup since I didn't have any.  It turned out spectacular!  This will definitely be a recipe I will make over and over again!

This is excellent! Everyone loves it and it is definitely addictive! My only  suggestions are: 1)Put it in a deep pan, like a roaster, instead of a jelly roll pan. The first time I made it I used jelly roll pans and every time I stirred, I had popcorn  everywhere.  2)Use a 1-1/2 qt. saucepan for the sugar mixture--smaller makes it boil over when adding the soda, and larger makes it harder to get it all out.

Simple to make. BIG hit with my husband.  I used molasses because I had no corn syrup and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine...I packaged it in Ziploc baggies.  1 day later, the kids tell me it's still crunchy.

This was SO easy and SO yummy! I made some for the holidays. My kids ate it up! It stayed pretty well in a large Ziploc bag for several days. I would imagine packaging it up for holiday gifts would work well, too. Then, since my daughter's birthday is in January, I made some more for her Birthday party. I mixed it with regular salty popcorn for that sweet-savory combo. I've never seen popcorn go so fast! This recipe is a keeper!

Okay, first, 7 QUARTS is 28 cups. That's about 6 bags of microwave popcorn. I halved the recipe and still had too much popcorn for two large baking dishes. I would say you will need three, minimum, for a half-batch, six for a whole batch.


Second, there wasn't enough caramel to really coat the popcorn, even after I tossed it in a big paper bag (watch out for hot caramel on the sides of the bag!) and after it spent an hour in the oven (stirring q15). The only solution would be to make more caramel or less popcorn. YMMV.


Third, a big bag is a great way to get the unpopped kernels to the bottom BEFORE you add the caramel. Shake shake shake and then scoop and transfer the popcorn to another bag. There will still be unpopped kernels so watch out! But there will be fewer.


Lastly, I am a bit skeptical about whether an Amish family would use margarine. I think the poster has taken a liberty or two, but if it makes it affordable then where's the harm?

Wonderful. Everyone who tried it, loved and and there were many requests for more as well as for the recipe.  Only changes I made (and not at all to the ingredients, just used the microwave to make it quicker) was add the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt to a large microwavable bowl, heat on high for 1 minute to melt the butter, mix well, and then put it in again on high for the 5 minutes.  Mixed well, added the vanilla and baking soda, mix again and added popcorn to the large bowl and tossed together until coated, then put on coated pans to finish up in the oven.  Will make this often.

Very good, no problems.... I used two pots of homemade, old-fashioned popcorn made on the stovetop (about 8+ quarts, I would guess) and I made 1-1/2 times the amount of sauce so it was well coated.  I cooked the sauce to 260 degrees on the candy thermometer (between the "hard ball" and "soft crack" stages) which took about 6 minutes from the point of boiling.  I used honey roasted peanuts instead of dry-roasted, and split the popcorn/peanut mixture between two deep roasting pans so they didn't spill when they were stirred.  Based on the other comments to bake at a lower temperature, I baked for 45 minutes at 215 degrees until it was no longer sticky and the pieces seemed a bit dry and broke apart easily as I stirred.  No problems, great recipe, sure to impress as a holiday gift!  It would be yummy to stir in dried cherries or cranberries for color and add a bit of tartness.  It's ultra rich and sweet!

SO GOOD!! The best caramel corn I've had. Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used butter instead of margarine. After reading some of the other reviews, I wasn't sure if I should go with the original instructions of baking at 250 for an hour, or 200 for 45 minutes, so I split the difference and went with 225 and gauged the time as I was baking. I happened to use a dark roasting pan and a light roasting pan (one of the disposable aluminum ones). My advice: If using a dark colored pan, cook for 45 minutes; if using a light colored pan, cook for an hour. Also, I just noticed another reviewer mentioned that boiling the mixture for 5 minutes was too long. I just bought new set of pots & pans that has a superior heat conductivity to my old set. I took the mixture off the heat at just under 5 minutes because I sensed it was just at the burning point.
Lastly, after pouring the caramel mixture over the popcorn, don't forget to take a rubber spatula and scrape all of the yummy mixture from the saucepan and eat it. Mmm Mmm. I just might make the mixture and turn them into bite-sized caramel chews next time.

Update it has been a few years since I had made this and made it last weekend at a baking party.  Everyone could not stop eating it instead of putting it in gift bags and everyone wanted the recipe.  I use butter instead of Margarine and with use 1/2 cup air popped popcorn per single recipe.
Very good and not that hard to make.  I made it with sunflower seeds.  Some people really liked the different flavor the sunflower seeds made and some people just liked the popcorn.

Love this - make it all the time with the following changes:  After popping the corn in a hot air popper and removing all the kernals, we divide the popcorn between two brown paper grocery shopping bags (about 1/4 way full each) and then pour the cooked brown sugar/butter topping (I also only use one stick of butter and not two) over the popcorn in each bag, fold the top over a couple of times and shake, shake, shake.  Then we place one bag in the microwave on high for 30 seconds while shaking the other bag. When the first bag is done, we put the second bag into the microwave while shaking the first bag.  We cook each bag 30 seconds for the first time, 45 seconds the second time and 30 seconds a third time, shaking well in between each cook time and alternating the bags.  Pour out onto waxed paper on the counter and break up large pieces.  Quite a bit sticks the to the side of the bag but tear it down the sides and the popcorn comes off easily without taking paper bag with it if you run a rubber spatula or spoon over the edges.  The caramel corn turns out much more well-coated than in the oven and it's super fast to make.

OMG THIS IS SO SO GOOD!we are huge fans of the Popcornopolis caramel corn from costco but it's so expensive and not always available.. This is identical! to the reviewer who said this tastes like cracker jack's you are sadly mistaken, I am not a huge fan of cracker jack's so that review almost prevented me from making this recipe. I did take some other reviewers suggestions as followed; #1 I used two bags microwaved popcorn, if you use more than that you will be diluting the caramel to thin and you won't get enough caramel on each piece of popcorn. #2 After picking out all of the unpoped seeds I dumped the popcorn in a grocery store paper bag and then poured the caramel mixture over the popcorn and stirred with a wooden spoon. #3 I greased a 13x9 glass pan and baked the popcorn at 250 degrees stirring every fifteen minutes. This is an amazing recipe and deserves 10 stars!!!!!

I made these as part of my x-mas basket gifts. 
I bought the bag of kernels (not the microwave type). I never made my own popcorn before but it was really easy. Just make sure your fire is on high & the kernels will stop to pop away!
I had a hard time figuring out how many cups of kernels to use to make 7 quarts of popped popcorn. I used 3/4c of kernels for this recipe...and it didn't seem like I had enough caramel so I will probably reduce it to 1/2c of kernels. I did use the paper bag trick....which seemed to work best when I put 1/2 batch of popcorn, then pour 1/2 of caramel over it, then repeat.
It hardens quickly when you take it out of the oven so you should work quickly when seperating the pieces.
I also melted some milk chocolate with a little cream & poured it over half of the caramel corn. After it dried (took a long time), I mixed the chocolate batch with the regular caramel corn batch. Just like a certain gourmet popcorn they sell for $10/bag!

Amazing popcorn!!!!!  Easy and goofproof.Drizzled melted white and milk chocolate on top of popcorn -to make a zebra pattern.  Did not have pastry bags for the chocolate so used ziplock bags and cut the corner off.  Make sure the hole you cut is SMALL otherwise you'll get globs of chocolate instead of a drizzle. Pam is your friend :)

One of the best sweet snacks I've ever eaten (and this is coming from someone who usually doesn't like sweets unless they involve chocolate!). Made this for Superbowl Sunday and our guests loved it. Tastes like Crunch-n-Munch. I used cashews in ours. It disappeared and I'm making another batch today (with Macadamia nuts). Fantastic and foolproof.

I have made this several times now. It is perfect every time. I use the Orville Redenbacher tender white microwave popcorn. Light brown sugar gives the best results in my opinion. I used dark brown once and it made a very dark stronger flavored caramel coating. This stays fresh and crisp for a while if you keep it sealed air tight so it is great for shipping. Thanks for a great recipe.

This came our much better the second time I tried it.  If you have a stove that tends to overheat, make sure you cook this on the low setting.  In the end, this is a good carmel corn, but nothing amazing.

This recipie is very easy.  Taste is good as well.  I gave 4 stars rather than 5 only because I prefer a slightly less buttery taste in my caramel.  Also for those who thought it was chewy...if you do not get the popcorn coated it will get chewy. The hardness comes from the caramel hardening when it cools.  Do your best to get it coated for best results.

Yummy and EASY! Actually, it is still baking, but I have tried it and cannot wait until it is finished. A few tips from my kitchen: *I cannot get large paper bags where I live (outside of U.S.) so I used a GIANT metallic bowl and wooden spoon...worked great. The caramel doesn't dry too quickly. *Next time I will shake in a few grains of Nescafe for a MORE caramelly flavor. *Next time I will also invest in some VERY LARGE baking sheets with sides b/c this time it was hard to keep the popcorn on the sheet when I mixed. I also noticed when the popcorn wasn't only a single layer and in clumps on the baking sheet, it didn't get light and crispy. I think single-layer baking is the best. *I used heavily salted popcorn! YUM. *I used salted peanuts and almonds...next time I will try sesame seeds, macadamias, cashews, dried fruit...whatever I have on hand.  *The popcorn I used was stove cooked with olive oil from 3 days ago and it worked fine.  *I have a sweet tooth and this amount of coating was great....it was light and subtle, but I decided to increase just the coating mixture by one quarter to make sure all the nuts and kernels got some sweetness.  *I cooked this at 200 for an hour. I would NOT bake at a higher temp and risk burning....better take time and have success. Thanks for the recipe! If only everyone could make popcorn, build houses and respect the land like the Amish do, we'd be in a better place! Happy crunching.

I made this in my big roaster lined with Release foil so that the popcorn wouldn't stick and I'd have no messy pan to clean up later. The carmel corn was nice and crunchy - not chewy at all.  I left out the nuts because of personal preference.  It ate so much that I actually broke a tooth (small filling came out) but it was worth it! Mmm...

WOW! This stuff is great! I actually forgot to put in the baking soda and vanilla after boiling it, and it was still fantastic! I used one batch of popcorn from our Stir Crazy popcorn popper (holds 6 qts, and it wasn't quite full), and I left it in the oven after I turned it off so it would get crispier. Delicioso!

I will NEVER EVER buy caramel corn at the store again.  This is the absolutely the best in the world.  And so easy to make.  I put my popcorn in a paper bag and poured the caramel over the top and shook very well.  Then transferred it to the baking pan.  The result was evenly coated caramel corn.

My mom used to make caramel corn about once a year, so I assumed it was hard to make.  This recipe is so easy and tasty.  Made for an Oscar party and everyone loved it.  Will use for Christmas gifts in the future!

My mom taught me how to make this back in the 60's.  Then along came the microwave and made it much simpler.   I put my popcorn and peanuts in a doubled brown paper grocery sack.  When the caramel is cooked, I pour it in on top of the popcorn, use my long-handled wooden spoon to stir it into the popcorn, roll down the top of the sack and put it in the microwave.  For my microwave, which is 1300 watts, I microwaved the mixture 2 minutes on high, stirred it and microwaved another 2 minutes.  This time I just shook the sacks real well (using mitts so as not to get burnt on the hot sacks), put them back in the microwave for 1 minute.  Then I just dumped the whole mess onto a clean, cut open to lay flat, brown grocery sack.  When it was cool it came off the sack perfectly.  One caution....don't microwave too long or it will burn but every microwave is a little different, especially if it is lower wattage so it may take a little longer.

Absolutely mouth watering! Huge hit at our BBQ. Only thing I would try differently next time is to not separate the chunks so much...I like it when 3-4 popcorn kernels are stuck together :)

Awesome Caramel Corn!!  I too used butter and it turned out  perfect.  I used a very sturdy rubber spatula to stir & coat...it was able to scrape the caramel from the bottom of the pan and coat the popcorn quickly and easily.  Thanks ANITALOUISE for submitting this great recipe.

Made this the other day, exactly to the recipe.  It came out wonderful my husband loved it.  I watched the video it helped and I learned pointers.  One was that when doing the 15 min. mix. returning the corn to the bowl made the mixing much easier.  If a person has never made carmel corn I would reccomend watching the video.. Thank you.

Very good! I didn't have peanuts so I substituted thin-sliced almonds. Most of them ended up stuck to the bottom of the pan, so I wouldn't recommend using them. Next time I will used peanuts!

This is the first review I've written on here (after being a member for probably 10 years), so that says a lot about how I feel about this...  This is one of the best recipes I've ever come across.  It's simple, easy-to-follow and comes out exactly like it's supposed to.  And, the caramel corn is amazing!  Much better than stuff you can buy!  I've been making it for a couple years now, and always include it in my list for homemade Christmas gifts.

This is my very first recipe rating ever, but I just HAD to rate this delicious caramel popcorn recipe.  Every time I make this, I get rave reviews from my family of bakers.  I've made it many times and get a lot of requests for this awesome treat.  Thank you for sharing this very awesome recipe!

I have made this twice now- both times turned out FABULOUS! I have had several people say this is the best caramel corn they have ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the nuts (just my preference). Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Totally addicting.  Used butter instead of margarine and reduced it to 1/2 cup because that's all I had left and just decided to give it a try.  My husband and I started eating it hot out of the oven and can't seem to stop!

INCREDIBLE!!!!  WOW Was this good!
I air popped mine then mixed it in a grocery store bag before I baked it.  You might want to increase the temp while baking because it seemed like the Carmel wasn't melting until we increased our temp!  Everyone loved it!  Not way too sweet! Just perfect!

This is better than the stuff you buy in the store.  Yum!  Didn't change a thing.  1 cup of unpopped popcorn = 7 Qrts.

This is my first time working with sugar like this and the taste is wonderful!!!  Soooo much better than store-bought!  Here are some of my tips: I used my non-stick stockpot and buttered the top third of it in case the sugar mixture boiled up and I used a wooden spoon so 1. it wouldn't scratch the interior, and 2. so that it wouldn't melt (I read somewhere that plastic utensils can melt when working with high heat such as candymaking).  I also used SALTED butter -- again, I read that it makes a difference in the final product rather than using unsalted butter.  Don't rush by thinking at first that medium heat isn't going to do anything -- soon enough the sugar mixture will behave and start getting bubbly and gooey. Have everything ready to go when you first start including the tsp. of vanilla and baking soda so that you can immediately pour them in when you take the pot off the heat.  I baked mine for 45 mins. after reading other's tips here and it was delicious!  Oh, I also made this on a damp day here in California and it still worked...I also found that two 3.5 oz. bags of microwaveable popcorn were not enough (only makes 2 quarts - or 8 cups - ), so I popped another quart - 4 cups - because I wanted to be sure to have a lot of caramelly goodness on my corn!

So good!  It's caramel-y goodness melts in your mouth...don't look any further and try this one.  We made it using butter instead of margarine because it's blasphemous to make caramel with margarine in my house.  We found 1 cup of uncooked popcorn kernels made 7 quarts of air popped corn.

This was perfect. My first time making caramel corn, and it turned out great! Here's something I learned: When separating the pieces to let them cool, leave the other pan in the oven (but turn the oven off). That way one doesn't harden while you're working on the other. I used disposable pans and a little less butter than called for - will definitely make again!

WOW! This is really good; better than storebought stuff. I served it at a party and it got devoured. I cut the recipe in half and there was still tons, so I wouldn't reccommend making the entire recipe unless you're feeding a really big crowd. Just remember 1 quart=4 cups of popped corn. Thanks Anita!

SO good! I've made this three times. Twice I halved the recipe. Be careful not to cook the caramel mixture too long. If you have a candy thermometer, you can't go wrong if you cook and stir till 250 degrees.

Leave it to those cute Amish people to come up with this delicious recipe. Over the Christmas holiday, I made this several times and liked it best when I used already popped bagged popcorn since it was so big and fluffy compared to the microwave kind. Also, I learned that you should put the butter and corn syrup in pan and let it melt a little BEFORE the brown sugar so that it's easier to incorporate and you don't burn the brown sugar. When you add the Vanilla Extract and Baking Soda, it does start to get light and foamy, so be sure you don't use a saucepan that is too small. I also used a very large aluminum pan (about 13"x20") so I didn't bother pouring out onto the wax paper. I just tossed it every 10-15 minutes or so until it was completely cooled right in the pan. This was really tasty and delicious. I'm a huge fan of nuts but even without them, it was a homerun!

A delicious, easy recipe.  I used butter and have to say, I think all candy-based recipes turn out better with butter instead of margarine. Don't give up on this recipe if it's a bit grainy the first time--humidity makes a huge difference.  Try on a dry day.

Positively delicious! Easy to make, fantastic caramel flavor, almost like cracker jacks. It's right about not worrying about even coverage when you pour the caramel over, it evens out by the last stir and 15 minute bake time. Thanks for sharing this, with the upcoming holiday season I know I'm going to use this quite a bit!

This is an update on my second time making this, so I am changing my comments. Oh, and STILL awesome! MUCH better this time! I see now I really overcooked the caramel the 1st time. 5 min. over med/low heat is fine - no need for a candy thermometer. It needs to be light and foamy, just like it says. I used just 3 bags of Jolly Time Blast O Butter microwave popcorn and the ingred. as they appear for 28 servings. (Oh, and use butter!) Every piece of popcorn gets covered nicely! This should be chewy and easy to stir, so if you overcook the caramel and have trouble stirring @ the 15 min. intervals, you didn't do something right. It definitely takes one hour @ about 240. It still may be a bit chewy, but once you let it cool, it hardens nicely. I used a large turkey roaster for the entire batch, which works wonders. This is SO SIMPLE AND SO DELICIOUS! This should have 10 stars!Thanks AnitaLouise!

YUM YUM YUM!  This was my first time making caramel corn, and it came out GREAT.  I didn't add nuts, because I didn't have any.  I ended up using another reviewers suggestion ( because I didn't have a big enough container anyway) and mixing the popcorn and caramel in a brown paper bag.  It was actually really easy to mix it in there, and I eliminated one extra dish to have to wash later.  FANTASTIC!

This recipe was awesome!  The caramel that goes over the pop corn is delicious alone, my mom and I found ourselves scraping it from the bottom of the pan while the corn was in the oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

WONDERFUL recipe!!! We made the caramel for the 28 servings but only used 24 cups of popcorn.  Just a bit more caramel made a huge difference =)

This has become a Christmas staple for me. I make one batch with peanuts and one without and put them in red and green bags (red for no peanuts, and green for with peanuts) and give them out. There are people who wait every year for it. Some years, I melt a little chocolate and drizzle it over it for added decadence. The recipe is great as is, although I usually make a little more caramel.

I started as a purist and only made "real" popcorn, but I've given up and use unbuttered microwave popcorn now and I think I'm the only one who even notices.

I use one of those throw-away roasting pans and just toss it for easy clean up when I'm done. Since I usually make about 10 batches for the holidays, this doesn't feel too wasteful.

Do not try to make this when it's humid. It's terrible and soggy. I made it once in July and regretted it right away.

I discovered an important tip for the success of this recipe! I had to make a double batch and during the oven baking process I used my roasting pan for half the amount and a corning ware casserole dish for the other half. I got VERY DIFFERENT results! The roasting pan batch was crispy and separated nicely at room temperature. The casserole dish batch was a bit chewy and best served slightly chilled and stuck to the teeth more. The stove top portion was cooked all in one pot so that was not the difference. The recipe was DELICIOUS!!! I will do it again but stick to the roasting pan only.

This is awesome - as is - but you can do SO MUCH MORE with it. This recipe is much easier with cooking directions than using a candy thermometer.  I stir constantly in the beginning while on medium heat -dont rush it -  until entire surface has small bubbles not just the sides, then dont stir or touch it for 5 minutes while it boils- NEVER FAILS NEVER BURNS & it makes the best coating texture.  I find air popped popcorn works best for coating to stick well & coat evenly. I ALWAYS use butter - amish or hand rolled butter I think works best.  A best seller at fund raisers - sells out every time & people even order several more batches from me to deliver when we sell out.  One batch goes FAST!  I add other flavors sometimes- to mix things up:  like cayene pepper to make spicy (my personal fav), ginger- or a bit more salt or sea salt - so more like caramel kettle corn; subsitute maple syrup or molasses  for part or all of the corn syrup - changes the flavor in a great way.  YUM YUM YUM YUM~

Outstanding.  I decided to use Almonds instead of peanuts and added light sprinkle of sea salt and a dusting of powdered sugar when I dump it out to cool.  I had to give it away immediately to stop eating it.  The whole family loves it.  Thank you very much for posting this recipe.

YUM! So easy to make an everyone just loved it! I skipped the peanuts and just followed the recipe as is. I used a roasting pan for half the corn and a jelly roll pan with tin foil for the other half. There seemed to be some reaction between to sugar and foil which caused it to become a little crystalized so next time I will skip that. It was a little difficult to stir it on the jelly roll pan, so next time I will just use 2 roasters.  I will never try a different recipe for caramel corn again!!!!!

OMG - the 5 stars isn't an exaggeration!  This was crispy, light and delicious.  My air popper uses a 1/2 c measure which gave me 12 c of popped corn so two rounds of that gave me just about 7 qts (28 c).  I used a friend's suggestion to put the popped corn in a large paper grocery bag and shake it with the brown sugar mixture.  It worked wonderfully and there was essentially no clean up.  Also, I used my son's "milk free" (Earth Balance) butter substitute with great results.

Caramel did not get light and foamy when the baking soda and vanilla  were added.  The moment I took the caramel off the heat, it hardened instantly.  Could not mix it with the popcorn.  Too stiff.  Cooking it in the oven did nothing for it.

Excellent and easy.  Be sure to have enough time to do this!  I had to forgo watching a movie at the theater since I had to keep stirring it, but the popcorn itself was well worth skipping the show!

great recipe, a few recommendations tho for people who are more like me and was like 5 min eh...melting sugar concoction with no temp and too much room for variation in stove tops? 

when i heated for 5 min on a thermometer it read to around the soft ball stage which is 240 degrees F. another thing i would recomend is if u make the popcorn before the caramal take the popped popcorn and warm it in your oven a few minuites before the caramel is done. 

also what works much better for the pan is one of those square turkey/roaster pans that are around 8-10 inches deep. i used also all of the other tips in the other reviews VERY helpfulll. 

makes tasty Caramel to!

p.s u def need more caramel or just cut the popcorn in half

it is the same recipe I use. I don't stir my caramel mixture while it cooking for 5 minutes, at a soft boil. It turned to gritty sugar, if I stir it. I got some caramel corn that had cinnamon it, oh I am in heaven with that one.

This was so great - thanks for sharing!  I too used butter in lieu of margarine and changed to 1/3 cup molasses and 1/3 cup light corn syrup, along with Spanish peanuts (for the Cracker Jack version) and it ROCKS!  This one is a keeper!

this caramel corn had good flavor, and i ended up with a crunchy corn at the end, but i had to make double the amount of caramel mixture in order to cover the popcorn. another thing is that the popcorn was too hot to separate at the end sooo i got caramel corn clusters. they tasted good but were not separated. some tips i have is to make double the amount of caramel and put half of it on before it goes into the oven. after 30 min pour the other half on top (still stir after every 15 min). another thing in order to have a good crunch at the end you have to boil the caramel long enough. 5 minutes after it starts boiling is about right... to be sure boil about 30 seconds longer. another thing i did was used buttered popcorn out of a bag. the butter that was on the popcorn gave it a salty/sweet taste, sooo if you like kettle corn this might be a good option for you... overall this was a good recipe... time consuming but good

I love this recipe! My sister loves caramel corn, so I've made it for her a couple of times. There are only two things less-than-perfect about it: it's time consuming, because you have to stir it often; and it makes a huge batch. The huge batch is good if you need it for a lot of people, but if it's just for a few friends or your family, I'd probably halve (or even cut to a third or fourth of) the recipe. I guess this should be obvious, since it says 28 servings, but somehow I guess I thought the serving size might be skewed or something. It's not - this is a LOT of delectable caramel corn (:

This is definitely the best caramel corn.  With or without nuts.  It's hard not to snack while you're making it!  It's now my tradition to make this for Christmas every year and people love it each time.   Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

It's ridiculous how good this is!!!

My take on it: 
I use real butter, and 
6 bags of microwave popcorn. (sometimes the butter lovers type).

I toss it in a big plastic tub, and I mix it really well so I don't have to turn it once it goes into the oven.

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!  OUTSTANDING!! It just doesn't get any better than this! I did add the peanuts and pecans, as well, cuz I'm crazy about nuts!!  I found that 2 bags of microwave popcorn was the perfect amount for this recipe.  I just could not stop eating this!  Perfect snack, but VERY addictive and got RAVE reviews by all!! Thanks so much!

Oh ye gods - simply amazing.  I halved recipe, ended up having to rush, and was only able to cook for about 50 minutes .... turned out absolutely wonderful!  Thank you so much for recipe.  NOTE TO SELF: do *not* use Country Crock - stick with real butter and watch time - went full hour and started to burn (could be the Country Crock).

Made this with my 13 year old for Christmas gifts and it was awesome!   Easy and so yummy!  I agree with someone else's comment of it being 'addictive'.

We made this for Christmas gifts and everyone has been raving about this popcorn. Be careful, it is addictive!  As a note: I messed up one batch and forgot to add the vanilla and the baking soda... it still worked, but the flavour was missing something and it clumped together more.

I have the identical recipe and it is the best for sure.  I get lots of requests for the recipe.  I don't put the nut in though as my children don't like them in it. And I do use butter also.

My daughter's friend LOVES caramel corn and could not believe that this was homeade.  Used non stick aluminum foil on a sheet cake pan and the clean up was a breeze.

I give this five stars because of the ease of the recipe. I made two batches of homemade popcorn using 1/2 cup kernels each time and that made right about 7 quarts popped corn more or less. It was the perfect amount of popcorn for the amount of sugar mixture called for. I poured the mixture over the popcorn in a paper bag then stirred with a wooden spoon and shook. I poured the popcorn equally into three greased 13x9 pans and it cooked beautifully. The clean up was a breeze too! Still crunchy the day after! The next time I make this the only change I make will be to cut the vanilla in half or leave out all together, especially if omitting the peanuts! Fabulous recipe!

Amazing stuff! (i used 3 bags of microwave popcorn and there was enough caramel to cover it perfectly) The taste is awesome, but it's chewy chewy chewy. I might make it one more time and let it 'dry' longer.

This caramel corn recipe is the best I've ever made.  My family loved it.  I messed up and only used 1/3 cup of corn syrup.  I didn't have my glasses on.  lol  But, it came out just perfect.  I reduced the temperature to 200 degrees as other have suggested and I only baked it for 45 minutes.  It could have gone an hour, but didn't need to.  I used one roasting pan and one jelly roll pan.  I popped the popcorn on the stove in a dutch oven.  I made two batches and used about 3/4 of it.  I used a large stainless steel saucepan for the caramel and it came out perfectly.  I made one part with peanuts, and one part without.  We actually preferred the recipe without the peanuts.  I plan on making this again for a Halloween party.

I made this for a party that I needed something to share. Have not made caramel corn for a LONG time and lost my recipe. I made two different recipes. Actually they were pretty much the same ingredients, just different quantity with the amount of popcorn. I used three bags of micro popcorn for the amount of sauce. I turned out very well. One thing for sure is to cook it for the whole hour even though it seems the corn is covered very well with the caramel unless you want softer caramel corn. I like mine crunchy. I did not have any problem with cooking the sauce. I used a stainless pot which worked out very well and really easy to clean as others suggested to rinse with HOT water right away. I also used a LARGE foil roaster I had gotten when I bought fried chix from my local grocer. It is heavy and has tall sides, perfect. I happen to have two and I used the second one to cool the cooked popcorn. I did keep stirring while it cooled because I like the single kernels. Also, if you are to add nuts or cranberries, they MUST be added before pouring the sauce over the popcorn, otherwise the sauce will not stick to any of the nuts or fruit. Thanks, I got comments from everyone that it is too good, can't stop eating. Will be making it again for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Oh, I did cheat on one batch and used purchased already poped corn. BOY, does that make it super easy. The warehouse clubs have a huge bag for about three dollars :)

I have to say this was a disaster for me! I was so excited when I read all the rave reviews. I used microwave popcorn  and butter instead of margarine as others recommended, I baked at 225 for an hour. It just never got that hard crack candy coating that caramel corn needs, and the sugars actually crystalized in the oven. What did I do? That many glowing reviews can't be wrong. I gave it three stars, although no on in my house would touch it and I threw the entire batch away. I am still on the hunt for a caramel corn recipe. For me... this one just isn't it. Sorry.

OMG, This so good.  I've never made caramel corn before but I have to say, I will make this again!  I did use the paper bag trick to pour the caramel over the corn, mmmmm so good.  This is to good to pass up.  I also used parchment paper to line the pan.  Easy clean up, great treat!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

My first time making caramel corn and I have made this recipe 3 times and it is perfect.  Anyone who uses a candy thermometer should just heat on medium til it reaches 250 degrees.  Perfect.  Anyone having trouble with candy recipes should be aware that SUGAR HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.  You have to use CANE SUGAR and the only brand I can find in the grocery stores here in the midwest is C&H.  They are pure cane sugar, not beet sugar or other random sugars the other mfgs are using.  It really makes a difference in candy recipes.  I found this out when my fairy food was not turning out after making it for years.  I called a local candy company and they educated me on the importance of using CANE SUGAR in certain recipes.  I only buy pure cane sugar for both white and brown sugars now.  It is plainly marked on the front of the pkg.

This popcorn is crisp and just the way I like it.  A few notes... putting it in "any old pan" might be a problem.  I used a broiler pan and a cookie sheet with a lip; both of which are a bit darker in color and in the last 15 minutes I felt like the sugar coating might begin to burn so I pulled everything with 10 minutes to go.  Next time I think I will use two of those disposal roasters because 1) they're lighter in color and 2) it will be MUCH easier to stir the mixture, and 3) I can toss them when I'm finished.  My oven door saw a lot of popcorn that escaped but I think using a metal spatula was a good idea so I could easily scoop up the yummy caramel when mixing.  I didn't have roasted peanuts so I threw in a couple handfuls of cocktail peanuts I had left over from another recipe.  So good! (oh, and I'm going to drizzle chocolate on the next batch!)   UPDATE: I took my own advice and used a roaster, putting all the popcorn and the caramel sauce into one pan.  Still did the stir every 15 minutes.  So good and much less mess... plus you don't have to guess how much of the sauce to put on each cookie sheet!!

I made this recipe today for the first time.  I followed it as written with one exception.  One reviewer said that 7 qts of popcorn was equal to two microwave bags.  I didn't question that, but I should have done the math myself.  I should have used 3 bags.  Instead of having that caramel crunch, it was more like caramel mush.  I still gave it 5 stars, because caramel mush is still very good!  But crunchy, caramel popcorn would have been much, much better.  I will definitely make again using three bags of microwave popcorn!

This was delicious.  Don't make the same mistake I did with the first batch I made, and cook it too hot in the over, I would say turn the oven down a bit if your oven runs hot, and make sure not to cook it on the low racks.  second try was MUCH better, slower cooked and didn't burn :D Burnt sugar smell took days to get out of my house with the first batch, and it happened so quick!

I only used 2 bags of Microwave Smart Pop popcorn, which equaled 6 quarts of popcorn.  We didn't mind because we LOVE caramel and the popcorn was perfectly coated in caramel.   Made with dark corn syrup, butter instead of margarine.  Baked for 45 min instead of one hour, started to get too dark for my personal taste. This is the BEST though!  YUMMY, thanks for the recipe.

This was easy and tasty. I will make this again. I used a leftover bag of movie popcorn but will use natural popcorn next time for a less buttery flavor.

I first made these exactly as the recipe states and my family devoured the entire batch.  I tried a second batch, using 1/4 cup corn syrup and 1/4 cup dark molasses, which turned out even better!  I made a third batch to share as holiday gifts and I received tons of compliments!   I highly suggest using the peanuts, and don't slack on the stirring (every 15 minutes while baking)  I will be making these over and over!

This is a great recipe, I made it for a potluck gathering and it was a perfect dish for munching throughout the night. I did not change the recipe but we like a thick caramel coating so I made more sauce than it specifies. I also roasted my cashews separately from the popcorn so that they'd be properly coated rather than falling to the bottom of the pan. Using disposable roasting pans is highly recommended!

I made this for the first time over Christmas.  I gave it as gifts and took it to several parties.  This got rave reviews, people could not stay out of it, even "fighting" over it at one party.  I always use butter when cooking, and used light microwave popcorn, mixed nuts and followed the prior suggestions to bake it at 200 degrees.  This is a really good, simple recipe...ended up making it several times...definitely a keeper!

This is honestly better than any caramel corn you can buy, I wasn't a huge caramel corn fan until this.  I've never had it not turn out.  The reason I never cared for caramel corn is because you end up picking half of it out of your teeth.  This is not stale or sticky at ALL.  I have packaged this up for gifts, I still get asked to make it by friends and family!  Awesome recipe!

My mom's recipe is almost identical to this but I use butter rather than margarine. I also half the recipe and cook the mixture on the stove for only 2-3 min once it's boiling. Then rather than using the oven use the microwave...it's MUCH quicker and turns out great every time. I put the popcorn in a clean grocery bag (sprayed with non-stick cooking spray) and pour the caramel mixture over. Shake it. Microwave it for 1 min.  Shake it again. Microwave for another minute and shake again. Finally microwave for 30 seconds and shake it one last time then dump the caramel corn onto wax paper/parchment paper and let cool. As its cooling you can easily break up the pieces.

A little time consuming but very easy and inexpensive. I used 2 sticks of butter which really makes the caramel taste great. I'm so exited about this. Glad to add to my recipe file.

Wow!! I very rarely rate a recipe, but this one is easy and good.  I took the suggestions of some of the others and used a large disposable (lasagna) pan.  I popped the popcorn using a hot air popper that uses 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels per batch.  I made two batches and this ended up being the perfect amount.  My children kept sneaking pieces when it was trying to cool.  This recipe is going to become a part of my Christmas baking each year and going into my heirloom cookbook.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Incredible!  My husband says this is the best caramel corn he's ever tasted and I have to agree!  I made it with 94% fat free buttered popcorn and  butter instead of margarine since that's what I usually buy.  As others had suggested, I baked at 200 for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  I will be making a triple batch for Christmas - this recipe is sure to please!

This recipe is wonderful. It was very easy to follow the directions. The only thing I did differently was I only baked the caramel corn for 45 minutes.

Are you kidding? This should be called 10 pound caramel corn because that is about what I'm going to gain eating this stuff!! I CANT STOP! I made it with roaster and two aluminum disposable pans. The aluminum pans worked MUCH better. Easier to get out too. I think this will make wonderful holiday treats for family and friends. I'm super happy to have found it!

I had a craving for some really good caramel corn. This is cracker jacks, kicked up a notch! (Even our dog Spanky loves the little bits he is allowed). The first time, I made it with honey roasted nuts and I cooked it in a large roasting pan, in order to mix it easily. Next time, I'll use salted roasted nuts and perhaps add a touch of cayenne. (Remember to take out the unpopped kernels first so that you don't have any one breaking any teeth) REALLY GOOD

I stumbled across this amazing recipe last year, and toyed around with the idea of serving it in our concession stand. This is a fantastic recipe! We will certainly be serving it this year, it will be one of the more profitable items we serve. And as a side note, you can freeze this! BONUS!!! No joke! I put it in individual bags (3 cups per bag), place 4 bags inside a gallon ziploc, and place them in my deep freeze. Just pulled out a bag from 2 months ago, let it thaw for about an hour and tasted like I just popped it. A freakin mazing!

All I can say is wow this is really good.  It's dangerous to keep around the house, I end up eating it and eating it.  Really easy to make also I know most people will have thought of this but make sure you pick out the unpopped seeds before adding the sauce cause when you bite into one of those kernals it's really hard on teeth.

This is really good.  It's better with pecans, though, because the peanuts tend to fall to the bottom.  Don't overcook the syrup or it will be grainy. And keep stirring it while it cooks.

This recipe is fantastic! I was expecting a gooey sticky mess in the bottom of my pot after baking the corn, but there wasn't one, just a little goo on the bottom but nothing a little soak in hot water can't fix. Do not over cook your caramel like I did beause it will be very stiff. (I should know better, since I'm a party chef too!) I recomend a good wooden spoon to stir, as a rubber spatula will fail you miserably.

Loved it! This was my first time ever to make caramel corn and this was easier than I thought. And it turned out too good! Yes that is right taking it out of the house before I eat the whole batch. Kids love it too! I will reduce the salt next time to 1/2 tsp.

Perfect!  I used only a half cup of butter and it turned out great.  I used one pan instead of two because I lent my other one to a friend.  Two is definitely preferable.  Would have been much easier to stir, but it was doable.  Also, a warning to other clutzes:  the caramel mixture is HOT! I got just a tiny bit on my finger and now I have a huge blister! So be careful!

My favorite caramel corn recipe.  Our family doesn't bake it.  We just let it cool on waxpaper and it makes the perfect soft caramel corn.

WOW!!!  I made this Caramel Corn as a part of my holiday gifts and have been making it ever since!! So quick! So Easy! SOOOOO GOOOD!!!  Also...once while pressed for time, I only was able to get in 30 mins of baking time and 2 "stirrings" and it was just fine.  One hint: follow the directions exactly! Do not raise the temp, be sure to stir every 15 mins minimum.  :-)

Perfection. I omitted the peanuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. One cup of popcorn air-popped will be enough for a whole recipe.

I made this today and it turned out great! I used real butter and found it to be a tad on the salty side. Next time I will omit the additional salt.
I followed the directions and my corn came out crunchy and delicious! I will be making this again.

Holy moly - this caramel corn is divine! I used two bags of microwave popcorn, and next time I will use at least 2 1/2 bags so the coating of caramel is a bit lighter. (It also will make more, which is definitely a good thing with this totally addicting recipe...) I used only my large non-stick lasagne/roasting pan rather than two pans, and it turned out perfectly. Clean up was super easy, too. I did bake it at 200 degrees for the first 30 minutes per some reviewers suggestions, but I increased it to 250 degrees for the last 30 minutes. Three days later, after being stored in ziploc freezer bags, it is just as fresh and crunchy as day one - not chewy at all. I am really, really impressed and plan to share this recipe with everyone I know.

This is a keeper!  I do not like Cracker Jack and Crunch n Munch so I cooked this like others suggested at 200 degrees for 45 min.  It comes out crunchy but yet a little chewy. Perfect. The flavor is a home run.  Also, 3 microwave bags of Pop Secret Butter was the perfect amount.  All kernels were covered with a nice coating.  I hate kernels that are bare. Do not overcook unless you like Cracker Jack.

I love all types of sweet popcorn, but this was just okay.  We ate some and after a few days threw the rest away.

I cooked the caramel glaze as instructed, but my resulting caramel corn didn't have the smooth, shiny coating I expected.  While I love butter and sweets, the mixture of butter, corn syrup, and brown sugar is just TOO much, even if you pour it over a large quantity of popcorn.

If you like Cracker Jacks, this recipe is probably right up your alley.  I personally prefer kettle corn with it's subtle sweet/salty taste.

Although I am not a lover of caramel corn, I made this because my book club is discussing a book that takes place in a circus, so I thought this was appropriate.  Honestly, this is off the charts delicious.  At one point, I thought about asking my husband to hide it because I feared I would eat the whole batch before my book club ever laid eyes on it!   I used butter instead of margarine and, for those who said the caramel got too grainy, do not scrape the sides of the pan too often and make certain that you cook it the entire five minutes. I used a silpat on a baking sheet, and clean up was a breeze.

Wow! This came out so beautifully. I can't wait to give it away as gifts. I popped my corn in a stapled brown paper bag in the microwave (I read about it online). It took several batches, but it came out great. I also used only half of the margarine (this made a cup serving only 3 points, for those who are counting). I had no problem with getting the popcron well coated. I used a huge roasting pan. I put the plain popcorn in it and put the whole thing into the 200 degree oven to warm while the mixture boiled for 5 minutes. Having everything warm made a big difference as far as coating. I have a feeling that I will use this recipe over and over again :)

This was super easy and tasty. I mixed the corn and caramel in a big paper bag as another reviewed suggested. I lined my 3 pans with parchment paper, which I don't suggest because it kept moving around when I tried to stir the popcorn. I added one tin of cashews to my recipe and it was a hit!

Just like a post right below mine, the corn tasted wonderful, but it was more sugary than caramely. I would HIGHLY suggest baking it at 200 degrees and for 45 minutes instead of 250 degrees for an hour if you want more of a caramel corn and not a candied corn. I will be doing that next time. Overall, this recipe was very easy to follow and it tastes very good. I just wish I would have listened to my instincts to take it out after 45 minutes.....

Can I give this 10 stars?  This is so deliciously sweet.  You will become addicted to this fabulous recipe.  I have made it several times for Christmas as friends have not stopped asking for it. I would not use the 7 quarts of popcorn.  Reduce the amount of popcorn to five quarts and the popcorn will be more evenly coated.  I have added coconut, almonds, walnuts, whatever I had left over from my holiday baking and the results were amazing!!!!!!  This is a must try for Cracker Jack fans.

If I could have given 6 stars; I would have!! This was fantastic and I do not really like caramel corn!!  I am taking it on a women's retreat to share with friends next month and expect to be the hit!  I did discover that using a cookie pan did not work for me...I liked the deeper turkey type pan better.

My only gripe with this recipe is that cooking the syrup on the stovetop for five minutes was not enough time.  The coating on the corn ended up a little granulated, indicating that the sugar was not fully caramelized.  Next time I will use a candy thermometer to make sure it reaches the proper temperature.

Other notes:  
-I used 1 cup of unpopped corn in my air popper; this ended up with a generous syrup to corn ratio.
-It works best to put the popped corn into the pan for the oven, then pour the peanuts over the top, then pour in the syrup.  If you try to mix the popcorn and peanuts before pouring on the syrup, the peanuts sink to the bottom and don't get any coating on them.
-About halfway through the oven time the corn was beginning to smell a little too hot; I reduced the temp to 225 and didn't have any scorching.

This is a wonderful recipe! I substituted butter for the margarine and my first batch disappeared almost as quickly as it came out of the oven! For my subsequent batches, I cut down the popcorn to 6 quarts for more even coating. My company hands-down preferred this special treat over what had formerly been our traditional Christams pies and cakes. Next year, instead of the usual hostess gifts, I'll be giving caramel corn!

This was awesome!  I added the peanuts and it was so much like cracker jacks.  My family ate most of it as they were separating the pieces to allow it to cool.  Most of it never got the chance to cool, and I had to make another batch.
Thank you for this recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  Was very tasty and easy.  I left out the nuts, because I always pick them out anyway.  I was trying to replicate my grandmother's caramel corn, and think I may have just done it.  Next batch I'm going to use 1/2 molasses and 1/2 corn syrup as an experiment.

This was my first attempt at caramel corn & it is WONDERFUL!!!  I stirred in candy corn after taking from the oven and also thought you could use M&M's as well.  I have had many want the recipe so have sent them to this website.  My daughter also wants to take this for her birthday treats to school this week.  YUM!!  YUM!!

I LOVE this caramel corn. My husband and I make it every year for Christmas to give out to friends and family, and have requests for the recipe every single year. My suggestion, similar to others, it to use a turkey roaster, or a deep pan. This makes it a heck of a lot easier to stir without popcorn flying everywhere.

Excellent recipe. I followed the suggestions on setting the oven at 200 rather than 250 and reducing the time to 45 min tossing every 15 mins. Super easy, super tasty.

This recipe is amazing!  I've made it twice and the only thing I do different is that I add sea salt to the caramel corn during the last 15 minutes of baking, so it has a nice salty sweet taste.  I pop the popcorn on the stove top (about 1 cup of kernels makes 7 quarts of popped pop corn).  The first time I made it, I ate some of the caramel corn without baking it, and it was good, but it tastes much better when you bake it.

Very addictive!!  

My family has been making this recipe for caramel corn for 30+ years.   The BEST popcorn to use is "mushroom popcorn".

I didn't read the hundreds of reviews so maybe someone else already mentioned this:

For quick caramel corn, you can make it without using the baking soda or baking it for an hour.  Just pop corn, cook syrup, pour on corn, stir and pour out onto a large piece of foil, parchment or wax paper then separate chunks while still warm.  Be careful not to burn yourself...of course!  :)

This is absolutely incredible! Very easy to make as well. I prepare the popcorn on the stove -- 1 cup unpopped kernels for this recipe (which I think yields a bit more than the 7 quarts called for, but I like these proportions). As is, the recipe is fantastic! However, I've also made it with honey instead of corn syrup; I love the flavor and the texture is not adversely affected by the substitution. Like others suggest, I always cook for about 45 minutes at 200 degrees, stirring every 15 minutes. I find the peanuts taste a little burnt if I add them at the start, so I like to put them in midway. Warming up the popcorn in the oven just before adding the caramel helps a bit when stirring in the caramel the first time as well. Highly recommend!

I have made this and given as gifts for the last three Christmas's.  The first year I made it as written, including the peanuts. The peanuts do not add much, so I have left them out the last two years.  I have found that the oven temp at 250 gives me better results than the review suggested 200 degrees.  I think this year I will try adding cranberries and almonds to one batch. I also use butter instead of margarine.  Can't wait to make it again this year.

This is fabulous in terms of it's flavor and ease of preparation.  Had no peanuts, so threw in some cashew halves instead and used butter instead of margarine.  We adjusted the recipe down to 7 servings and not quite doubled the caramel and thought that was necessary to get the coating we wanted.  Excellent recipe!

Made a double recipe of this for my Super Bowl Party and had a friend grab my caterer to "find" the bag for the Carmel Corn so she could find out where I purchased it.  Needless to say, the Carmel Corn was a hit!  It was fairly easy to make...more tedious stirring and separating the kernels than anything.  I added Spanish nuts and think the little bit of salt was a nice addition.  I popped my own corn using Amish Country Blue Popcorn and a Nordic Ware Microwave popcorn popper using no oil. I will definitely be making this again and again!

I have made this twice and both times came out great. I cut the recipe in half and used 2 bags of kettle style microwave popcorn. My grandfather used to make caramel corn when I was little and this is very similar. Thanks for sharing.

Simply AWESOME!  I gave as teacher gifts this year and had to fend off my DH and kids from eating the gifts.  I did find that I like the taste even better with salted stick butter vs. Blue Bonnet butter.  It gave a richer taste and a thicker glaze.  The thickness made it a little harder to stir in the popcorn, but was worth the little extra effort.

Good recipe.  It turned out better than I expected.  It's a bit of a messy project, but I don't think I'd change anything.  Just need to have a lot of space and a lot of trays, etc.  I was making this for gifts and it didn't make as much as I would have liked.  But, even then, it gets back to space.  I have a small kitchen with little counter space and this was really pusing it.  The end result was very good though.

I've made better caramel corn.  This did not taste buttery! Sorry, margarine does not cut it for me.  Also, I used part dark brown sugar, because that's what I had on hand.  I don't recommend it.  The coating was darker in color and I didn't think as attractive as when I've made other recipes with light brown sugar.

To test this recipe in preparation for Christmas candy making, I divided the original recipe by 4. I used butter instead of margarine, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - including cooking time. The result was perfectly crunchy, salty-sweet, light caramel corn. It tastes very much like crunch and munch actually - which is what I was going for. Well, this actually tasted better. It's really good.

Awesome!  I made two batches; three bags of microwave popcorn worked well, two bags gave a nicely drenched batch!  Used butter instead of margarine. I see making this recipe a few times a year!

Delicious! I am a BIG fan of caramel corn, but don't eat it often since I'm the only one in my household who likes it. I wanted to give my neighbors a Thanksgiving gift, but didn't have a lot of time to bake last night. My hubs and I picked up several bottles of our favorite local-made hard cider this past weekend and then it clicked.... caramel corn and cider are a PERFECT match (and seasonally appropriate too!). Because I only needed a small batch (and wanted some leftovers), I made 10 cups worth. I took half, added it to a large treat bag, tied that with raffia and placed in a kraft bag along with the cider. I packed everything with festive tissue paper and tied it with pretty ribbon and a handmade gift tag. I took some of the extra caramel corn to my in-law's (to nosh on before our turkey dinner) and my MIL and one of my brother-in-laws thought this was the BOMB! Thanks for making me look like a pro, ANITALOUISE! I can't wait to hear what my neighbors have to say about this! :-)

Awesome recipe.  I used 1/4 light corn syrup and 1/4 molasses per another reviewers suggestion.  Boiling 5 minutes just took it to the edge of burnt, so I will reduce it to 4 minutes next time.

Great recipe!  I used 1/4c molasses and 1/4c corn syrup. I baked at 250 an extra 15 minutes, because i like my caramel corn crunchy. If you like your caramel corn sticky, don't bake for a full hour. I also used pecan halves instead of peanuts.  Don't waste time looking at other recipes.  This is a keeper!

Can't talk.....eating.  This stuff is good.  The second time I made it, I used 10 ounces of prepopped pop corn, and added 1 cup of Spanish Redskins to the carmel mixture while still in the 4 minute boiling cycle; I also used sea salt and instead of regular butter, Smart Balance spread.  Also, 10 ounces of popped corn fill a standard sized roaster.  Baked for 15 minutes, gave it a good stir, and for another 15 minutes, another stir (if you like it chewy); if not, cook longer.  Thank you for the excellent recipe.

This is absolutely delicious. I have to force myself to stop eating it, and I'm not even a huge fan of sweets. I think it is the sweet/salty combo that is so appealing. I would not change a single thing about this recipe. Thanks so much!

Totally addicting! My whole family and all my friends who have tried this say it's better than any store bought caramel corn they have tried. I agree. The only thing I changed was butter for the margarine, and used pecans instead of peanuts. I've made 2 batches in 3 days and its gone already again with everyone begging for more. I'd like to see how long it will stay good in ziplocs but can't get it to last for more than 2 days! Oh well, love this recipe! Thanks so much.

This is TO DIE FOR!  I have made this twice now - once my ingredients were fresh, and the second time my brown sugar was hard as a rock but I still used it.  Definately use fresh ingredients - my first batch was chewy and rich and carmelly and amazing...this is one of my top ten recipes from this site!!!

The words "to die for" come to mind!  I used real butter as I cannot imagine using margarine in any recipe.  I popped two Whirley Poppers of corn = 1 cup unpopped, and then poured it all into my enormous Staub and mixed, spread onto 2 pans, and baked.  This was much easier than I imagined and a super snack - so easy to pack in individual servings, too!  Pop your own corn instead of using microwave corn - it really is so much better!

I needed to make a large amount of caramel corn so I decided to try this recipes.  I made 3 batches and they turned out great.  I had a large roaster and made the entire batch in it.  There was plenty of sauce over the popcorn and I had no problem washing the roaster afterwards.  I did try making 1/2 batch also, but it did not come out as well.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This caramel corn is to die for! Make sure you only boil caramel for five minutes though. I thought it looked too runny and cooked it for six minutes, so mine was a little bit chewy. It keeps fresh in a ziplock bag for at least five days... well that's how long it lasted in my house.

This is soooo good. A little time consuming, but well worth the wait. I used butter instead of margarine (I don't use Margarine) and it was delicious. Next time I will probably up the caramel to popcorn ratio though.

Absolutely fantastic! I remember my mother making caramel corn when I was a child and she lost the recipe a long time ago and once I found this I was pretty sure I'd found the long lost recipe, and when I tasted it I knew I had. The biggest problem is finding enough cooking dishes to accomidate all of it (I used 2 large deep casserole dishes). 5 stars. Delicious!

Same as my Moms Recipe!  Excellent!  Instead of stirring the corn (which breaks it all up) you can do it in a roaster and just put the lild on and shake it - less mess and less broken peices!

Very delicious and not that hard to make. I used someone's advice and did half syrup and half molasses and they came out perfect. I used almonds, roasted them first... It is a must have during christmas, or any time of the year for that matter :)

I don't know what I did wrong but when I poured the mixture on the popcorn the popcorn just seemed to melt and did not resemble popcorn at all.

This recipe is awsome!!! made it for a Christmas party and it was a hit! I used some of the reviewers notes and used 2 roasting pans and oven temp 200 for 45 min... i also made the caramel recipe 1 and 1/4 so all my popcorn was evenly coated.  i also bought some "mushroom" popcorn which almost every caramel corn out there is made of... soo great will definately make this again...

This is definitely a 5 star recipe!  Superb!  I used kosher salt and added a little more than a teaspoon.  On one batch I drizzled first with milk chocolate and then with white chocolate.  Looked like it came from a gourmet candy shop!  I also baked it in my Nesco roaster set at 250 for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  A lot easier than using cookie sheets when stirring, and turned out just as good.

amazing!!  you can add any flavoring you want, I added a tsp of rum extract and green food coloring for Halloween.  Super easy to make!  I roasted it in a big disposable aluminum pan from the grocery store.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I followed the advice from another review and used butter instead of margerine, almonds instead of peanuts and baked for 45 min. instead of the full hour.  I did one batch for an hour and it had a strange burnt after taste.  Overall, best caramel corn recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and the results have been fantastic every time.  I've done it with and without nuts - my preference is for almonds or pecans over peanuts.  By the way, if you want to get another treat out of this recipe, you can use the caramel coating over pecans or almonds alone - bake them like you would the popcorn, stirring occasionally - and you end up with a wonderful batch of candied nuts.  Since this recipe would cover a lot of nuts, you can make a half batch of caramel corn and use the rest on a couple of cups of nuts.  I promise, you won't have any leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe.  One of my favorites on AR!

Yummmmm! Super easy and super tasty. Who could ask for more? I appreciated the help with popcorn quantity: 3 bags of microwave popcorn were perfect. I used half margarine and half butter, and took the suggestion of mixing the popcorn, nuts, and caramel syrup in a large paper grocery bag -- one less pot to clean! After the caramel corn cooled, I drizzled some of it with melted dark and white chocolate, chilled it to harden the chocolate, and broke it into clusters. Makes a pretty gift in cellophane bags tied with a ribbon.

A co-worker made this recipe and it was so tasty I asked for it! I made 28 cups (seven 4-cup containers) of popcorn with my air popper Used one giant disposal roasting pan from the dollar store and threw the entire batch into the one pan. I did lower the temp to 200 degrees as my oven cooks very hot and cooked for the full hour  Next time I will make a little more caramel or use less popcorn so its more evenly coated  It was fantastic! Best Caramel Corn I've ever had! It'll make great Christmas gifts!

Made this with my son as part of a raffle basket for his Marching Band.  It was easy and fun.  Followed the tip about adding couple dashes of cayenne to brown sugar / butter mixture to give it a hint of heat!

Really wonderful recipe. The batch disappears quickly in our home! I agree that 200 degrees is the correct temperature. 250 was too high. Can't wait to make these for gifts during the holidays!

I followed the recipe exactly. This is a Goldmine recipe. A keeper for sure. I will be making big batches of this from now on EVERY Christmas! Thanks for sharing Anita Louise. I am very thankful for everyone that shares recipes on this website. Instead of keeping their prize recipes a secret they are kind enough to share them. Thanks again.

This is truly wonderful caramel corn.  My husband is a Cracker Jack fanatic and he has informed me that this is much better tasting.  He had an opened bag of Cracker Jack in his other hand at the time. Be sure to remove the unpopped kernals. I use a drying rack as suggested by another reviewer.  Also make  sure you time the syrup mixture or it won’t be the right consistency.

This was exceptional.  I have been making it for holiday gifts for the last 3 years and it never fails to be a favorite.  A few things I have learned: 1.  3 regular sized bags of microwave popcorn is the perfect amount  2.  After popping corn and before adding caramel, take the time to remove the uncooked kernels.  Save on dentist bills!  3.  The 15 minute intervals of stirring do a great job of distributing the caramel evenly.   4.  Hide finished caramel corn from family if you want to use it for gifts or they will eat it all up before you give it away!

I have made this recipe for years using the oven bake method, however I have found an even easier and less messy way to bake.  I divide the coated corn into two large brown paper bags.  I microwave each bag separately on Medium Level for 4 minutes, removing every minute and shaking the bag to coat and keep corm from over cooking in spots.  Remove from microwave, use a spatula to loosen corn from sides and bottom of bag, spread out on flat surface to cool.  No clean-up...just throw away used bag.

We can't get enough of this!!  I've made it three times since Thanksgiving, and my brother-in-law is requesting more.    I used microwave popcorn, Orville Reddenbachers Lite, and I've also used just a cheaper Light Butter flavor.  They were both good.    Be sure to get out as many unpopped kernels as you can before you add the caramel sauce.  They become stuck to the popcorn and are a royal pain to separate, as well as pain to bite into!  I used peanuts in one batch, mixed nuts in another and no nuts in the last batch.  They were all great, but I might just prefer it with no nuts at all.    This recipe is just fantastic and very easy.

Omigosh! This is so delicious I could not stop eating it. You will never eat caramel corn from a box again. It is simple yet time-consuming. I used butter as I never buy margerine and it was perfect. Three bags of Boyscout butter light popcorn made the perfect amount. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and used my roasting pan. Worked beautifully. Rather than pouring it out on the counter, I left in the pan and stirred it every few minutes while it cooled - no problems. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is a cinch and extremely devine.  I made it to fill my baby shower favor bags which contained a neat little saying about "she's going to pop".  Everyone loved this and wanted the recipe!!!

This recipe was a huge hit! My entire family loved it, and they want to make a family tradition. The only thing we changed about the recipe was doubling the caramel for each batch. That way they were all coated nicely. We also cooked it at 200 for about 25 min. and then at 215 for the last 15 min. The popcorn doesn't need to cook for an hour, 35 min was perfect, nice and crunchy not too chewy. This is definately a keeper.

I love this recipe. I don't eat refined sugar and I really wanted something sweet to munch on. I did a few substitutions to make it acceptable to my diet, but boy was it good.
I replaced the sugar with Turbinado sugar (raw sugar; Sugar in the Raw) and the corn syrup with raw honey.

I used buttered microwave popcorn and salted butter istead of margerine.  I think I could've omitted the additional salt. It was still great!!

To make the popcorn crispier, I usually turn the oven up to 300 degrees for the last 30 mins.  It just makes the caramel corn more crunchy and yummu!!!

I made this and put into tins for Christmas gifts and have received many nice thank you cards and requests for the recipe.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  I recommend doubling the caramel and use real butter.  I used a teflon pan for the caramel so it would slide out and used disposable aluminum roaster pans.

very easy to make.  I love the idea that others shared about using a paper bag to mix up the popcorn and caramel mixture - saved lots of mess.  The taste was wonderful.  I used cashews instead of the dry roasted peanuts.

Amazing.  Easy.  The best caramel corn I've ever had, never mind made!  Some tips:
-I've used light corn syrup and dark; I prefer dark, but both work fine
-I use a little over 1/2 cup unpopped kernels
-Works with butter or margarine
-I don't put it in the oven at all, and don't add the baking soda.  This makes it chewy rather than crunchy.
-Have used Roger's golden syrup when I didn't have any corn syrup on hand, and worked well.  I could imagine Maple syrup tasting really good too!

Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Wow!  Also excellent with drizzled with chocolate:  spread carmel corn on a cookie sheet, heat almond bark (it's chocolate coating, no almonds in it!) according to microwave directions, drizzle and cool in the fridge for 10 minutes.  Awesome.

The best popcorn ever! I did not use the paper bag, instead I dumped the popcorn into a aluminum pan sprayed down with Pam. I stirred in the caramel. No mess, no fuss. I sent these out for Christmas gifts via mail and they were a hit. I have also added mixed nuts or dried fruits for a variety.

Made on the spur of the moment and turned out delicious!  I had to substitute 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 white for the light brown because I was out, and pecans for peanuts for personal preference.  Perfect!  I will definately make it again!

Very good recipe, although I would recommend making about 25% more caramel than the recipe calls for so that all of the popcorn gets covered.

I've tried many recipes for caramel corn for the BF and this is a yummy, easy and  great treat for V-day! I used 1 large and 2 mini bags of pop corn, 1/2 lb toffee peanuts, heated the "caramel" until 250 degrees and cooked for 3 minutes, mixed in pans no problem, baked at 200 for 1 hour (mixing every 15 min.) Sugestions that may be obvious to others but you know - CAREFUL not to add any un popped kernals from corn, 2 roaster pans do not fit in the oven at once side by side?  I used 1 roaster on the bottom shelf and a 9 by 13 on the top shelf, switched the 2 3/4 way thr. cooking, also dumped on brown bags at the end to cool - soaks up some of the grease and very easy clean up!  Next time i would use 1 bag of corn for the caramel so it could cook in 1 large roaster pan w/ cashews. Thank you!!!!!!!

This was pretty good.  The only thing I was dissapointed in was that there was no "shine" to the glaze on the popcorn once I baked it.  It was almost sugary looking.  It tasted great!  I used chopped pecans instead of peanuts, and it turned out great.  Just not as pretty as I wanted it to be.  Thanks for the recipe, AnitaLouise.  I will make again for parties and the like.

This is terrific!  Odly enough, my favorite part was probably making the popcorn itself, in a heavy pot with oil, shaking constantly... it brought back memories of my childhood.  Anyway, the finished product is awesome.  I also made a half batch as a test for xmas gifts and it passed hands down.  I will probably use 1 and a half times the topping when I make it again, just to bring it over the top.

This recipe was fairly simple and yummy!!

I halved the recipe so I could try it out before making it for Christmas gifts - it's definitely going on the list!

This is not a sticky caramel corn recipe, it's not too sweet, which I think people will like.

The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the peanuts did not stick to the popcorn too well.  Next time I make this, I think if I pour the sugar mixture over the popcorn and nuts and stir it more quickly, it will help solve the peanut issue.

So delicious, baking it in the oven makes it just like the gourmet popcorn places. I like to drizzle melted milk and white chocolate over the popcorn to make it even tastier.

Made this at Christmas time and it didn't last until Christmas! It was a big hit around here!  (Plus, I couldn't keep my hands out of it!)

This is truly addictive!  So easy and oh-so good.  Should have gone with my first instinct and halved the recipe.  Can't... stop... eating this!!

I've made this recipe several times, and I find it's better if I skip the step with the baking soda and vanilla.
I just boil the sugar, corn syrup and butter and put that right on the popcorn then bake it, and it's way better that way.

excellent buttery, caramel taste. super easy and turns out great every time. my family loves this and i will make it often- one note-i found 45 mins to be better for cooking time, an hour seemed to have a bit of a burnt caramel taste.

this was so good! i, too, used butter b/c i didn't have any margarine. and i also decided to use cheese puffs (mike sell's cheese puffcorn to be exact) instead of popcorn. (this is b/c my husband and i had the most delicious mix of popcorn at garrett's in chicago - half cheese and half caramel.) it didn't look too appealing but it tasted heavenly. everyone was trepidatious at first, but quickly became addicted. will definitely make again. my only regret was not adding nuts, but it was still tasty.

Really good!! Made it twice in the last month and got rave reviews. I used my large roasting pan and it worked better than using the cookie sheets. I cut the corn syrup in half and used molasses for the other half.

I'm giving this 5 stars, even though this didn't turn out really well for me.  I decided that double caramel to popcorn would make this super great.  It was too sticky and didn't separate very well.  The taste, however, is awesome.  I'm very confident that following the recipe to the 't' next time will render great results!

A+ Made some to give as gifts - but it was gone before I could package it up.  I put the popcorn in a large paper bag and poured the brown sugar/butter mixture over it.  That made it much easier to stir, then I poured it into two non-stick foil lined pans.  Came out perfect!

Love this popcorn.  I melted some semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled it over the popcorn while it cooled.  It gave it a real gourmet look.  Pretty easy too!

Very yummy!  We were short on brown sugar and had to substitute white with a bit of molasses for about half, and it still turned out great.  I may use this in Christmas gift baskets this year.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! I need to make more Amish friends!  This caramel corn definitely disappears quickly it was so good.  Be sure to check the oven temp and time because after 45 minutes the batch started cooking a little too dark.  Besides, you get to eat it 15 minutes sooner too!  Enjoy!

did not make any changes and will not make again! Tis recipe was too gooey for me wanted something more crunchy. This was a mess and to eat it with gloves . the problem here lies I believe . NO TEMP FOR CARAMEL GIVEN!!!!!   Candy making is a craft its not just something you throw together.
  baking was ridiculous . took way to much time and wasted energy If I do this again I believe I will take the caramel to exactly 300 degrees f. or hard ball  Stage. Ever eat soft gooey crunch and much or cracker jacks? I do don't think so. Oh one more thing. cut the sugar in half as this is sickeningly sweet.

For those of you wondering how much 7 quarts is.  I made two batches of popcorn stovetop with 1/2 cup each raw kernals with 3 tablespoons oil and ended up with probably more like 8 quarts popped corn - and this turned out perfectly.  I did use butter instead of margarine and didn't not boil my sugar as long as I didn't want it to harden and caramelize too soon.

This was pretty good. Very time consuming. Be very very careful when letting the sugar mixture come to a boil. I accidentally burned my thumb and finger. :( 

Overall it was really good.  You're better off using  a roasting pan vs a  cookie sheet ..It makes it a lot easier to evenly coat the popcorn pieces. With the cookie sheet you end up with pieces of popcorn on the counter. We don't have large paper grocery bags out here or I would've opted for that instead. 

I used molasses and corn syrup combo and it was really good and added some peanuts as well. It tastes just like Cracker Jacks. Yummy!!

I have tried other recipes on this site, but this one is the best! I followed the recipe to the T and everyone loved the taste!!(I couldn't keep my hands off the treat while it was cooling, lol)
I have made it with or without nuts, either way it never lasts long, I made a batch just yesterday to give away as Christmas gifts. 
Here's a tip, if you don't have waxed paper, seeing as to how I grew up with my thrifty Grandmother, I always keep large brown grocery sacks,unused ones, on hand..just cut it apart, spread it out, take a cold stick of butter and rub it across the paper, works very well. I always use a large aluminum roasting pan or pasta pan. Great Recipe, thanks for sharing, this one will be a keeper in my Family!

This is a recipe that I would rate a 5+.  For my family, this is the perfect caramel corn!  I use my air popper to pop 27 cups of popcorn and then proceed with the recipe, only using butter rather than margarine.  I've made it with peanuts, with mixed nuts, with pistachios and with almonds.  Each batch was equally delicious.  I bake on 2 large cookie sheets and rotate them every 15 minutes when it is time to stir.  Two very important steps to making perfect caramel corn is - 1.  don't put it away until it is completely cool and 2.  don't make this on a rainy, muggy or high humidity day as it will turn gummy.

YUM!  This is so good.  It is really important to remove the unpopped kernels of corn before you add the caramel.  Also, I like to sprinkle a little salt after the caramel coating right as it comes out of the oven.  Oh man, this stuff is good.  So addictive and really not that hard to make.  I've made it several times now and always get compliments on how good it is.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday for the first time.  I had never made caramel corn before.  After reading many of the comments I decided to try the recipe as listed.  I did increase the amount of caramel by 50%.  I added dry roasted honey roasted peanuts and pecans.  My wife didn't know I was going to do this.  She got home about 3:00 pm.  I had everything cleaned up and the finished product in a large canister.  I opened it for her and she thought the Boy Scout popcorn had arrived.  I said it wasn't.  She tasted it and said it was very good.  We ate a lot right then.  Today about 24 hours later is as almost gone (just the two of us).  I would never have believed we could (or would)eat that much caramel corn in a day.  We just can't leave it alone.  It is by far the best I have had.  It came out flawless.  I chose to cook it at 210 degrees and stir it every 10 minutes.  By the fifth stirring it was completely coated and separated.  Nothing was stuck together.  I dumped it out on the wax paper covered counter to cool.  The coating is clear and glossy, the kernels are individual.  It has a slightly brittle outside and very tender popcorn inside.  It is absolutely perfect.  I am almost afraid to make another batch.  We just shouldn't eat that much sweets.  Great recipe.

Some helpful tips... use a turkey roasting pan with curved corners. The higher sides and curved corners will help with the stirring every 15min. I also made extra plain popcorn and diluted the caramel corn at the end when cooling with the plain. Good idea if you have kids and are watching the sugar intake or if you are trying to make the batch stretch a bit. I also used a sprinkle of lrg grain sea salt toward the end when the batch was still warm enough for it to stick. Yum!

Made according to directions and it came out fine.  Tasted like Cracker Jacks.  It does however leave you with carmel sticking to your teeth which my husband hates so I will not make again.

The flavor is great, I need to work on the sauce.  I tried 200 as others said but thought it needed the 250 so I turned the oven up.  Somehow the brown sugar started getting grainy so I took it out of the oven.  I did make this on a day where the humidity was 44% - maybe that is too much.  I will try this again.

This is an excellent recipe. I've made this recipe for years.
It was on the Jolly Time Popcorn bag many, many, many years ago.

After having made this several times, I think that the caramel sauce is cooked to a point just prior to it burning. So, it is a little tricky to make and simple to scorch, but totally worth trying and I highly recommend it (with or without nuts). We keep an empty pretzel rod container we had gotten at BJs, just to store this when I make it. I use loose popcorn and unsalted butter instead of oil.

I made this for a "Passover Dessert", it was a huge hit with kids and adults.  Everyone wanted to take one home at the end of the evening! Instead of spreading them on a baking sheet for the last step, I formed them into balls and didn't bake them.  I was hoping without baking they would have been more chewy. I will definately make this again and in addition to the ingredients, I will put in "Kosher Marshmallows" for the chewy effect I'm looking for!  Shalom!

I've made this recipe for a couple of years and will never try another. It is the absolute best caramel corn! If you use almonds, real butter, and pop your own popcorn, you will experience a premium caramel corn! I sent some to my sister-in-law and she said it was the best she has EVER eaten. Highly recommend!

Awesome! Even in spite of my failure to remember all the ingredients this was a hit. I used two bags of Orville Redenbacher's Naturals Simply Salted microwave popcorn. If you're like me and have never made caramel corn before, the thought of mixing the popcorn with the caramel mixture was a little daunting, but I decided to go with the paper bag idea. I sprayed the large grocery store paper bag with oil, poured the popcorn in and then poured the caramel mixture over. It was hot, duh. It mixed fairly easy, but in the stress of thinking about how to mix this I forgot to add the baking soda and vanilla to the caramel mixture and didn't remember till it was too late. I baked as stated on a cookie sheet sprayed with canola oil and allowed it to cool on parchment paper. Wow, this was amazing! I'm sure it would have been even better had I remember the baking soda and vanilla, but even with all the other goodies on Thanksgiving this caramel corn was gone fast. I'm still not sure if using the paper bag is the easiest way to cover the popcorn with the caramel, but it worked this time. Fantastic recipe!

Really yummy, classic caramel corn.  I use agave in place of corn syrup and use a little less sugar. For me it never takes longer than 25-30 minutes in the oven to get nice and crispy.

This is the best caramel corn recipe I have ever tried.  It is failproof if you follow the directions.  I put it in a big turkey roaster instead of two pans.  I also use two 6 oz bags of cheese popcorn instead of regular popped corn.  The cheese popcorn gives it a good depth of flavor.

This is amazing!  I'm not a huge fan of caramel corn, but whenever it's my turn to take snacks for our small group bible study, I'm "expected" to bring caramel corn since I made it a while back and everyone was a fan.  Can't wait until tonight and surprise everyone with this new recipe.  (if I don't eat it all first)  So yummy.  Since it's close to Easter, I sprinkled the coated popcorn with pastel sprinkles before putting the pans in the oven.  So pretty and springy.

I had some leftover popcorn (4 C, or 1 quart), so I scaled the recipe and used butter instead of margarine. This recipe was fantastic. I just couldn't get the popcorn evenly coated...I'll need to figure that out...but the flavor was so wonderful I was willing to overlook the uneven coating and give this 5 stars. Will definitely make again.

This is the best caramel corn I have ever tasted!  I used dark brown sugar and dark karo syrup since that was all I had and it came out wonderfully.  I will try it the original way next time.  WORD OF WARNING- when I added the vanilla to the boiling hot liquid it spat at me.  Also, the baking soda fizzes up really quickly so make sure you have a big enough pot.  I didn't, and I made a bit of a mess.

Liked the recipe, but I think 7 quarts of popcorn is too much.  Would like to have more coverage of the caramel mixture.  Using Orville Redenbacher's Original popcorn, the yield was approximately 6.5 quarts, which would have been more than enough.

Cooking the caramel mixture in a non-stick pan really made the clean-up easy!

Large, aluminum, throw-away roasting pans worked great, and also helped tremendously with the clean-up.  

Would make again.

Simply Amazing! I popped 1 cup of kernels but could have done 2 cups easily. The caramel coating is crunchy and delicious, but a little too much for the amount of popcorn I had.

Love this recipe as did my family and friends. Making it tomorrow for some friends that are getting together for a Christmas dinner. Putting it in individual bags with some costume jewelery rings hidden in the bags to mimic cracker jacks. I am sure the girls will get a kick out of it.

Lovely but a bit too much butter for me.  Would make again using half the quantity.

This recipe also worked well on my family's traditional "puffy" corn for caramel corn too, same measurements except use store-bought corn puffs (the stuff made similarly to puffy cheetos.) No hulls, and a bit of a different flavor.

I'm not sure why this got such fab review...I thought it was just OK.  I read a review that suggested 1/4 c. corn syrup and 1/4 c. molasses instead for more flavor.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

This is AMAZING!!!!!!  If you like sweet/hot add 1/4-1/2 tsp CAYENNE PEPPER when you add the soda and vanilla.  It adds a little underlying heat at the end that balances out great with the sweet.

I've tried many different recipes before finding this one. By far the best. During the holidays I add roasted pecans and bacon to the caramel corn halfway through baking. My friends rave about it and it always goes first at the bake sales!

This stuff is so good! I actually put a little more popcorn than it says because I like it a little lighter. Set out a huge bowl of it for Christmas last year. Everyone raved and cleaned out the bowl. Yum!

Mmmmmmm...so yummy. Made it exactly as written, except no peanuts. The kids couldn't wait the 60 minutes, so I gave them a bowl each after only 20 minutes. It tasted great, but was chewy. After 50 minutes, it was perfectly crunchy. Cooked the whole time at 200, not 250.

YEP! This caramel corn is delicious.  the first time I made as directed. GOOD!  I have adjusted to real butter-better flavor, in my opinion. I have also made this with different nuts...and delicious also.  (NO nuts-still yummy or pecans or mixed nuts--you can do whatever nuts you prefer...Mmmm! )

My first batch was not so good, I didn't really pay attention to the time on the stove and had the oven too hot. But I made a second batch today and it was perfect! I used my whipey popcorn pot and one batch made more than enough corn. I'm going to add milk chocolate and white chocolate drizzles when I make it again in 3 days! This will be a staple for Tuesday night bingo!

This recipe is fantastic! I've made it several times and it's always a hit. My only change is to use butter rather than margarine. Also, try adding some cooked crumbled bacon (use the real stuff, not the fake bits) to the caramel before pouring the mixture on top of the popcorn. Bacon caramel corn is all the rage -- talk about decadent.

Excellent caramel corn. I used cashews instead of peanuts, and it is delicious. I also baked it on 225 instead of 250.  Will make this again for sure!

Awesome!!!  I cooked 2 batches of popcorn on the stove (1/2 uncooked popcorn in 3T canola oil) total of 1 cup popcorn kernels.  Then I used HALF the caramel recipe.  Perfection!  I baked at 200 for an hour...but I think 45 minutes would be fine.  Yum Yum Yum!

This is the second year that I have made this corn and when I was late making it this holiday season I was repeatedly asked when I was making it this year!!  Thanks so much for posting!  Super easy even for myself and my beginner cook (my 11 year old son helped).

**update**

Made this again tonight and I wanted to be sure to let everyone know to be very careful with the caramel.  If it seems to be getting too dark, take it off the heat.  As with any recipe for candy, if you follow the time guidelines too strictly, it might be burnt so use your own judgement!

Turned out great again this time, but I took it off the heat at about 3.5 minutes and I only baked it at 200 F for about 30 minutes, not 45....

I made this last night, Christmas Eve, with my kids and it is delicious and...addictive! Be careful! I followed the recipe for caramel sauce exactly, except I used butter in place of the margarine and I made an extra 1/2 batch and used 3 bags of tender white microwave popcorn. I baked in the oven in big foil lasagna pans, lightly sprayed with non-stick spray. To one pan I added a handful of good quality semi-sweet choc chips (at the last 15 mins of baking) and a big handful of walnuts. When I spread the popcorn out to cool, I sprinkled it with red and green colored sugars, which looks very festive. I found some silver and gold Chinese take-out style containers at the dollar store, lined them with holiday plastic wrap and filled them with the popcorn...tied with a ribbon and they are adorable and yummy! Thanks for the recipe, it will become a holiday staple.

The first time I made this, all I did differently was add molasses as suggested. The second time, I decided to add 3/4 t. of cayenne pepper. The heat was just subtle enough. Definitely recommend!

Yay!!! Awesome recipe. I've been making a very similar one for several years & get RAVE reviews. I recommend using butter (2 sticks) instead of the margarine. I use 3 bags of unflavored microwave popcorn & remove all unpopped kernals. My husband loves cashews too so I sub them for the peanuts. I don't know how much difference it makes, but I add 1 tsp of baking soda to get it all "puffy" ....can't go wrong with this recipe!!

This saved my life today! A friend borrowed my cookbook that has this recipe that I have been making for YEARS, and wasn't home when I needed the book. So I did a search and FOUND IT! This was spot on...except I don't use the nuts and I use butter not margarine. I use about 3/4-1 airpopped popcorn and I pop it into a large aluminum rectangle pan. Easy to coat and stir. My friends request this every Christmas and even return their tins so I can refill them each year. It is a family and friend favorite! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

I made this caramel corn to give to all the teachers and specialists at my son's school.  They loved it!  Several asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used 6 bags of popcorn to fill 15 of the Ziplock brand cube-shaped containers.  I also followed the advice of a couple reviews I read and decreased the oven temp to 200 degrees and baked for only 45 minutes (stirring every 15 minutes).  Turned out great!

Made it for the first time this year.  Added toasted almonds along with the dry roasted peanuts.  Was asked for the recipe many times.

I just made this delicious caramel corn today to share with friends and family. I added 2 12oz. bags of pecans instead of peanuts, light brown sugar and salted butter. I suggest using the middle rack of oven, and a wooden spoon to stir every 10-15 min. and baking no longer than 40-45 min. Then separate on wax paper with wooden spoon. Prep time is closer to 30 min. not including bake time.

I just gave this to my coworkers and husband's for Christmas and everyone LOVED it! I had people ask for the recipe. This was really easy to make and I would make it again! Instead of peanuts, I substituted for dry roasted almonds for people with allergies. I made two batches and burned myself on both batches because if the caramel which gets really hot!

The best caramel corn ever. I add a little extra butter and corn syrup, just so more of the popcorn is covered. I have neighbors asking for this all the time.

OMG, you have to try this!  It is the best caramel corn and easy to make!  Not all my corn got completely covered so next time I may make a but extra caramel but this is a great receipe!  Oh my only tip, I bought  this disposable cookie sheets, dont!  Its too shallow of a pan to try and turn the popcorn while in the oven!  Next time, and there will be a next time, I may try a roast pan.

Very yummy!!!!  I found this recipe very easy!!!  I did make my own simple sugar syrup (sicne I didn't have corn syrup) and I used butter instead of margarine.  I also used fresh stop popped pop corn, since I was going with the whole natural concept.  Turned out great!!!  And clean up was not that bad either!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!  OMGosh!  It is soooo good!  I use 3 bags of microwave popcorn and it works perfectly!  Great any time of the year but I make it most from Halloween to New Years. For kids party I put it in sandwich bags so their fingers aren't all over the caramel corn!  Makes wonderful gifts in tins for the holidays and is AWESOME at tailgating parties too!  So perfect!!!!

I do not rate recipes that I alter as I do not find it fair.... with that said - note the 5 stars.  This is rock star caramel corn.  Super duer crazy addictive, a wonderful salty sweet taste.  It is perfect as is but also awesome drizzled with chocolate, sprinkle with some sea salt, add chocolate covered pretzels.....or, honestly, huge bowl, you, comfy chair and a great movie - perfect!

SO GOOD! OMG, this tasted just like Cracker Jack's - even better! I decreased the servings amount to 15 since that's all the popcorn I had, and since I didn't have corn syrup, I substituted maple syrup. Tasted real good, and at first I thought the caramel was too less.. but once I put it in the oven.. it became easier to mix! I do have to agree, the mixing part IS kind of a pain, but it's all worth it! My teacher said: "This is really good!" My classmates couldn't stay away from it!

ive been putting this one off for a long time because of the amount of steps (im a lazy chef) but i finally did it and its amazing! i couldnt stop scraping the sauce pan for more remnants of the caramel.  it turned out perfectly! i highly recommend doing the paper bag method and 45 minutes at 200 degrees worked well for me. im putting it in baggies mixed with candy corn and candy pumpkins to take to work. also i used non gmo popcorn and organic corn syrup. a little more pricey but worth it to me. thanks!!

I just whipped this up and it's YUMMY! I reduced the sugar by 1/4 C. and did a scant 1/2 C. corn syrup, and it's still plenty sweet, you can't even tell. I added roasted mixed nuts for variety. Mine was done baking in 45 min. Will definitely add this recipe to "My Fav Goodies" cookbook :)

Mine didn't turn out as well as I hoped. But the caramel tasted really good so I will have to make it again. There was way to much popcorn that the caramel couldn't coat the whole kernal. Not even half of it. We like our caramel corn fully coated. So I will try again and make less popcorn this time.

This is the best caramel corn I ever made! Everyone went nuts for it! Thank you for such a great recipe! It was so good that my daughter and I were eating it off the floor every time I stirred it and some fell out. Next time I'm making it in a huge turkey roaster!!

I dont normally leave feedback on recipes, but I absolutely had to on this one.  I decided to make some of this caramel corn for my mom (who loves fiddle faddle, cracker jacks, all that kind of stuff).  It was so easy and so inexpenisve.  First off, just let me say that I am not a fan of caramel corn, but OMG, I tried some of this and it was absolutely wonderful.  My husband and my 20 year old son could not stop eating it!!  I have now made three big batches in the past two days to give out to family members with my cookies, and people keep asking me to make more.  I will be making another batch this evening and putting a little aside for myself.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  And Merry Christmas.  :o)

This always turns out perfectly for me. I learned the first time I made it that 1/2 cup unpopped corn makes 7 quarts. I use one large greased roasting pan for the whole mix, stirring every 15 minutes. I used cashews instead of peanuts, and sometimes I drizzle melted chocolate almond bark over the popcorn as it cools on parchment paper. So yummy. I never bake with margarine, so butter was the only way to go for me. This is also a great idea to send in Christmas care packages, or summer camp care packages. It travels well, it's lightweight, and it stays fresh in a large ziploc bag.

Made this last night with my husband. We followed the recipe exactly, except for using butter instead of margarine, and it came out great. Didn't have any problems at all. Used disposable baking pans bought at the dollar store, which I sprayed with cooking spray so nothing would stick to the pans. I thought 2 cups of peanuts was a bit much and the amount should be scaled down a bit, but my husband thought they were the best part. I'm sure I'll be making this caramel corn again, especially since I was planning to bring this to a Christmas Eve party and don't think it's going to last until then. Maybe next time I will drizzle melted chocolate on top. YUM!

This is soooo yummy!! I don't think I will bake cookies at Christmas anymore. I will just make bags of this! I found at 250 degrees the caramel hardens more at least in my oven. Also a good tip is to pour it on parchment paper when it is done. Mine stuck to wax paper, but slid right off parchment paper.

This recipe is wonderful!!!  I used 2 bags of Act II Light Butter popcorn.  After the caramel was done, I mixed it and the peanuts with the popcorn in a brown bag with a wooden spoon.  Used two well-greased 9x13 pans and baked for 1 hour at 200 degrees!  I can't stop eating this stuff!!

We have made this at least 5 times and it is always perfect-not too sweet, crunchy and so easy!! I scoured my Moms house searching for an old Amish cookbook we used to make caramel corn with no luck-thrilled to have this! I love air popped corn for this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I have done this popcorn a few different ways.  I have to say, I read a previous review stating to use a paper bag to stir the caramel and popcorn together, and this was by far the worst way to get the popcorn covered!  It covered the bag more than the popcorn.  That was highly disappointing.  Other than that, it tastes excellent.  I will continue to do it by just pouring the caramel over the popcorn on the baking sheets. Yummy : )

Very, very good stuff!  Having made this several times before, I thought I'd hurry the oven time along by using a higher temperature and ruined it.  Just follow the instructions.

I made this last night and I have to say I sent some with my son to daycare, they couldn't get enough of it! Part of it was too chewy, but it was my fault, I pour too much caramel to that baking sheet of popcorn, the other was perfect! No modifications what so ever were done and it was perfectly buttery, salty...delicious!

This recipe was such a hit at our recent fall party.  I'd never made it before, but I will certainly make it again.  It was perfect.  The only thing I changed about it was using butter instead of margarine.  Soooo good!!!

This is a really great recipe.  I followed the main ingredients but substituted grey sea salt (used 1/2 teaspoon) and added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes to the syrup mixture before boiling.  Gives the perfect balance of salty/spicy/sweet!

FANTASTIC recipe!!!!!! I used 3 bags of microwave popcorn. I don't know if it was maybe my dark baking sheets but I think that I will bake for only 45 mins next time. I am giving it away is goodie bags for my daughters birthday party this weekend. Thanks for the great recipe I will definitely make it again and again!!

If you add nuts, do it in the beginning when you pour the caramel sauce over the popcorn while the sauce is still thin. If you add nuts halfway through, the sauce will be too thick and won't coat the nuts.

I have made this recipe several times over the holidays for gift-giving and it has always turned out perfectly!  Thanks for a great, easy and delicious recipe! The only note I'd make is to use brand-name popcorn.  I tried it once with store-brand, and it wasn't as fluffy as the brand names.

The first time I made this, it tasted burnt, maybe because I cut it in half, without changing the boiling time. Yet, it was still strangely addictive. The second time, I also cut in in half (I used 1 bag of microwave popcorn both times) it tasted better. I never had problems with coating the corn and there was tons of caramel. My advice when you put it in a container, seal and and put in on a high shelf or you may eat it all in one sitting. For relatively easy cleanup, put a lot of butter on the cookie sheet (or whatever you use) and get the pans and dishes in hot water as soon as you're done using them. This was great, I'll make this oft. Thanx!

This is the BEST caramel corn I've ever eaten. It was easy to make, and had that oh-so-wonderful soft caramel taste. I did end up using more popcorn than it called for though, mainly because my family and I don't like it to be insanely sweet. A real keeper!

This is a fool proof recipe and we loved it!  I made it just as stated and baked the caramel corn in a disposable large roasting pan. This was served during the Super Bowl and everyone RAVED about it.  We couldn't stop eating it.  This is a definite keeper and it was truly easy to make.

This is absolutely to die for...I made it in a large roasting pan. At first, it seems like the popcorn will not be covered with the caramel mixture, but after stirring every 15 minutes, it comes together nicely.  I used REAL BUTTER.  Would be terrific for superbowl or as gifts.

Wow, made this for Christmas gifts and I can't even begin to tell you how many calls I got for the recipe! This is a no-fail, super easy caramel corn recipe.  It turned out PERFECT. I used Orville Redenbacher Smart Pop (was all that I had in the house) and real butter, not margarine. YUMMY!!! For the reviewer who had problems, two things.. One, it sounds like you didn't let your syrup boil for the complete 5 minutes. Two, for the sticking, did you remember to grease your baking sheets? I used butter to grease mine.

Wow, this was excellent! I didn't read the review before making, which was a mistake because it would have been so much easier to bake this in a disposable huge roasting pan.  I used 2 lasagne pans and struggled to mix it all up. Oh well, I got through it.  I didn't have a problem with grainy texture, but I remained patient with my caramel sauce, letting it warm up slowly (yes, it takes a while, but I didn't want to have to do it again) I made one batch with dry roasted nuts and one without. The one with nuts was way better.  I'm making this again on the weekend and am going to load it with nuts.  Excellent! For the popcorn I used 2 bags of Vic's white popcorn from the grocery store. It was already salted so I omitted the salt in the caramel sauce. Also used butter instead of margarine.

Wow, this stuff is amazing.  I took the advice of others and used a large throw away roaster pan and sprayed with PAM.  I let the sugar get heated slowly before boiling, remember if you constantly stir it you must stop at times to see if you are at the gentle rolling boil, it's easy to stir and not start the time right, then you overcook.  This, however was foolproof!  We couldn't get enough and it is so easy.  Thanks! **Also, I forgot to mention that I cooked at 200 degrees for 45 minutes**UPDATE this is now a staple in our house.  My kids love it! We always pop our own corn on the stove first to avoid the icky microwave kind.  I have made this for neighbors too and they loved it as well.  It always turns out great for me.

This is very good. I can't wait to share it tonight. Hopefully it will go over as well as it did with me. I used fresh home made popcorn. Maybe a little less than stated in ingredients. Then I cooked it for 1 hour at 200 degrees.

Not that this needs any more rave reviews, but I was always one to throw my 2 cents in :P
This was fantastic. I used 1 1/2 cups of unpopped popcorn. Popped it on the stove in 1/2 cup oil, then picked out the unpopped kernels. Made the caramel as recipe says and used 2 jelly roll pans to bake. Baked at 225 for about 45 minutes stirring every 10-15 minutes and it was perfect! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I do mix it in a double layer paper bag like others have suggested and that makes it so much easier.

I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was. And the flavor of the popcorn is unbelievable; SO much better than caramel corn you buy at the store. Best of all for me, I can give it to my daughter if I leave out the optional peanuts. She has a severe allergy and almost all the caramel corn you can buy either contains nuts or is made on shared equipment with them.

I'm not sure what happened to my batch! It tasted ok coming out of the oven, a little soft. Once it cooled completely, I put it in ziploc baggies and it turned into mush! Well, sort of. When eating it, it tasted wet, not crunchy at all!  I did cook it at 200' as some suggested and if anything, I had too much popcorn, so it wasn't over saturated.  Maybe I didn't let it boil long enough? Sorry! I guess I'll stick to my TNT caramel corn!

I've made this recipe dozens of times in the past year, and it always gets rave reviews.  Over the years, I've made so many caramel corn recipes, but this one is without a doubt the very best recipe I've come across.

I am not a fan of caramel corn, never have been. I LOVE THIS. I made half with walnuts, half without. Both halves were great. It was devoured at work and at home. Recipe worked well first time. My second batch is iffy. It is in the oven now... I guess I will know soon.

This is amazing!  I've made this several times and given it as Christmas gifts.  It's so addicting we eat almost half of it just by grazing each time we walk by as it's cooling!  The only changes I make are butter instead of margarine, and I don't think I've ever greased the pans - they clean up fine with hot water and sometimes a brief soak.  Oh, and this last time I didn't quite have enough popcorn, so I found some Crispix cereal to pour the remaining caramel over - that was really good too, and actually safer to give my 2 yr old than popcorn!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My Mom lost her delicious caramel corn recipe and this is the closest thing I can find to it.  It's wonderful. I usually omit the nut just cause Mom always did and have used honey instead of corn syrup for a twist on the original recipe.  I also use a stainless steel bowl instead of baking sheets or roaster.  It works well for stirring this and other baked snack mixes.  Yum-Yum!

My husband always raves about my cooking but with this recipe the compliments have not stopped coming and the caramel corn has been gone for 2 days.  He says I am really on top of my game.  Followed the recipe and  mixed it up in a paper bag as someone recommended, loved that idea.  Used both microwave popcorn and air popped since that was what was in the house.  Even the 13 year old girls I made if for could not believe I made it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a awesome recipe!  The carmel corn is not hard and it doesn't stick to your teeth!  It was very easy.  I read a lot of the reviews, but decided to pour the carmel over the popcorn in the pan.  Something about mixing it in a brown bag, isn't very appealing to me. (although it probably spreads it better)  The next time I make this I will probably make extra carmel..I added cashews, and baked it for 1 hr at 200 degrees stirring it every 15 mins.  Once it was cooled I drizzled dark chocolate over it..Yummy!  It yielded to large tins. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

If I could give this more stars, I would! This is the absolute best caramel corn recipe, hands down! It's easy, the caramel has a rich, creamy flavor, & it's crunchy! I think I'll try it with almonds or pecans, or maybe mixed nuts next time. I'm giving this wonderful delight packaged in pretty tins for Christmas this year.

This is the most delicious caramel corn I have had in years.  Tastes just like the kind we used to get from the candy counter when I was a kid.  It was super simple to make, I had no problems with the caramel at all.  Five minutes was perfect.  I used three bags of microwave popcorn and each piece is coated nicely.  The only substitution I made was to use pancake syrup in place of corn syrup because I was out (pancake syrup is basically corn syrup with maple flavor added).  It didn't add any maple taste to the final product though I wouldn't have minded if it had.  I packaged this in small bags for my kids to give as gifts to their friends in school and I managed to get 8 generously portioned bags from one batch!  Really inexpensive gifts considering the few dollars it took to make the whole batch.  I guarantee this will become a new tradition at our house!

I've made about 6 batches now for holiday gifts and agree - mixing in a paper bag is an awesome tip.  Just tried on 6th and should have done with all.  Added pecans & craisins, dipped some clumps in white choc and some in dark.  Thanks for a great one!

Oh YUM!  A student of mine told me about this recipe and I just made it on my own.  It was amazing.  She told me to make it more chewy to skip baking it and she was very right.  The student has taught the teacher a new trick!

WOW!!!! The BEST caramel corn ever. I followed some of the review suggestions, such as putting corn in a large paper bag,and cooking at 200 degrees for 45 minutes. I also added some lightly roasted pecans. This is an awesome recipe. I had to make a second batch, because my husband and I ate half of the first batch!

So good and very easy to make.  My sons and all their friends loved it.  I will be making more for the holiday gift baskets I will be giving this holiday season. I used a disposable foil 13x9 cake pan. Once you are finished with it, through it away. Makes for easy clean-up.

this is great made with margarine or butter.  I have made a dozen batches for friends and family and it always turns out great.  You can add any kind of nut or no nuts.  I have done almonds, peanuts and a combo of dried cranberries and mixed nuts for Christmas.  Super easy to make.

I tried this recipe and it's delicious.  Mine is just a little sticky and the peanuts didn't stick to any of the popcorn.  I used cocktail peanuts and next time I'll try roasting some raw peanuts that don't have oil/salt.

This is delicious popcorn.  I made two batches today and burnt half of the first one so had to make another.  Note: When you take it out of the oven, IMMEDIATELY put it on the wax paper.  I broke something and left the popcorn on the pan too long.  I had to stick it back in the oven to soften it enough to come off the pan--it's like cement.  That didn't help the popcorn though, it burnt!  The second batch was great although more chewy like others mentioned, I don't think I baked it quite long enough.  (If you take it out of the oven to stir for too long you need to add a few more minutes of baking).

Never made caramel corn before...and now I will never buy it again. This recipe rocks. I have a bad sweet tooth so I used more of the caramel coating than suggested. I gave it out with the other treats I made for Christmas, well except for the half I ate on my own. :)

How can caramel corn be bad?  This was a great recipe, with plenty of room for substitution and modification.  I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup - delicious; I added at least 4-6 cups more popcorn than called for - it was still very caramely; I skipped the peanuts - wish I hadn't, they would have been great; I mixed up my popcorn & caramel in a paper bag before putting on the cookie sheets - it gave a very even coating.

A WINNER and so EASY.  I have made at least 10 batches in the last month and it has received rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  A true KEEPER. I used my hot air corn popper and lined my pans with Release Foil.  Cleanup was a breeze.

This is very yummy and easy.  This uses margarine insted of butter so its more affordable. Much better than store bought!!! I set the oven at 200, and checked and stirred the popcorn every 10 minutes to help it not burn.  I sized the recipe to 44 servings for the caramel and used that for the popcorn popped from 1 cup of kernels.  This is a great recipe for gifts.  My family wants me to make more for them, right now!!!!

Definitely delicious!  Was a bit of a chore to make, I think next time I'd mix it in a big bowl, then put it on the cookie sheets.  I should have made it in my roaster pan but I forgot I had one.  I accidentally mixed all the sauce ingredients together, and that worked fine instead of adding the soda and vanilla later.  Will make again maybe for Christmas once a year.  I used 3 bags of natural popcorn microwave popped.

My college mom used a recipe very similar to this to make caramel corn for a house full of college kids.  She would heat it in the microwave, though instead of the oven.  She would pour a half recipe into a brown paper grocery bag, pour the caramel mixture over it and shake well.  Then roll up the bag tightly and microwave for one minute, take out and shake well, microwave one more minute, shake, microwave one more minute then scrape out onto wax paper and let cool.  I've always gotten very good results this way, though if you have a high wattage microwave, you may want to do it on 80% power.

This was a HUGE hit with my husband and his co-workers.  I bake something for them every week and wanted to try something different for a change.  My husband actually asked for a separate tin for his "special stash". As others suggested, I used 1 stick of margerine and 1 stick of butter.  I also used my large turkey roasting pan to cook the popcorn.  I did goof - I used my large dutch oven as opposed to a sauce pan, which made it difficult to pore over the popcorn mixture because I had to use 2 hands.  Live and learn!

Awesome recipe!  One tip...after the butter (can use margarine), brown sugar, corn syrup and salt are boiling, you can let it boil for 4 minutes (actually 4 will do) without stirring.

Perfect!  The best we've ever tasted.  A little extra time to make sure the popcorn is turned every 15 mins. but worth it.  We'll be making large batches for Christmas gifts this year.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just made this tonight with almonds and peanuts!! It's wonderful!! I used some inspiration from previous reviews and used half moleasses and half light corn syrup. Pretty easy to make ...fairly messy, although that decribes me more so than the recipe!

Nothing but compliments when I make this! I use air-popped popcorn and add 2 cups whole almonds for better health and extra crunch and flavor. When I used margarine, it came out a little chewy, but very tasty. I also used half butter and half margarine and that made it more crunchy and slightly buttery.  I loved it both ways.

This was quick and super easy to make. This was my first time to make caramel corn and I didn't have any problems. I used regular microwave popcorn and it turned out great. It kind of had a sweet and light salty taste....husband loved it. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

My daughter wanted to bring caramel corn for a youth group movie night so I decided to try this. It was a hit with all of the kids and the leader and for all of the friends we have let have some since.(Only good friends as this is soooo good) I spent all afternoon making three batches but it was so well worth the time! I saw that some of the other reviewers said that it took much less time to cook and that some even said that it burned a bit, I wonder if they assumed that the oven temp was 350 not 250 because it took all of the time and then some for me, but my oven temp is often lower than it says so I upped the temp by 10 degrees and then again by 20 in later batches. I have given the recipe to several friends already. Thanks for sharing!

The only changes I made were to use real butter!!!.  I keep the air popped popcorn in a 200 degree oven and after I put the caramel on popcorn, I kept the oven at 200 for 45 minutes and stirred every 15 minutes. That way it doesn't over cook the caramel. My favorite!!!!

This worked perfectly!  I realized though that I didn't have margarine so used butter instead and it was just fine.  I love how the recipe takes the pressure off of you to coat the kernels evenly right away.  Over the hour that the popcorn is in the oven you stir it every 15 minutes and it all gets coated perfectly. And everybody LOVES the flavor!

This almost identical to my late Aunt's, who made it every year for Christmas (minus the vanilla though).  This is the first year I've tried to make it myself --- great tip from an earlier reviewer who recommended warming the pan and popcorn in the oven first --- I'm sure  made a world of difference, given how this stuff sets up as soon as it hits cool air.   I used my large non-stick turkey roaster, and them turned out the finished caramel corn on 2 parchment-lined half sheet pans.  Worked wonderfully.   A fabulous recipe!

Delicious! Use a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixure to 270 degrees in a thick metal stockpot, NOT TEFLON and you don't really need to stir it constantly while cooking. I've made this recipe several times, real butter tastes better than margarine.  I set the oven a bit lower than the recipe calls for. Making a 1/2  batch is much easier to manage.

I found to make any type of candy corn you must use mushroom popcorn.  You get better coating coverage with this type of popcorn.  I cannot wait to make this recipe again so I can try a couple tweaks. The one thing I did do different this time was use butter instead of margarine and added 1/4 cup of water.

Got to agree with my peers on this one. Best recipe on AR! My friends are badgering me for the next batch. One caveat: I used plain popcorn rather than microwave because I don't like the additives in microwave popcorn. It turned out great but make sure you don't have any uncooked kernels left. Not a fun surprise.

First review on this site, and I picked a winner of a recipe to review.  Easy to make, and IMPOSSIBLE to stop eating.  This one's gonna be a regular in my house.  I used two bags of instant popcorn and unsalted butter instead of margarine.  It came out PERFECT.  I must stress, BE CAREFUL AROUND THAT HOT CARAMEL.  I actually burned my knuckle during the popcorn coating process and it was no joke.  Other than that, I enjoyed every bit of it.  Being from Maryland, you know I had to sprinkle a little Old Bay on.  If you can get some, I highly suggest trying that.  The spicy and sweet combo is magical.

Enough reading, get cookin!

The most important part of this recipe is to BOIL for 5 mins., not a little trickle boil, but wait for the rolling boil and TIME it, don't guess. Stir the whole time when it's boiling...pain in the butt, but you have to.  Good tips: Have your baking soda and vanilla ready to use. I use butter, not margarine. Somewhere over the years I learned the paper bag trick for coating, which saved a lot of time! I use cooking spray inside the bag and dump the popcorn in and then the caramel while stirring with a WOODEN spoon (less stick). I always use 2 cookie trays per batch. Oh, and personal preference, I always old-fashion pop popcorn kernels, it has a different flavor. I don't know if anyone does that anymore, but there you have it.

Great recipe! I replaced the margarine with coconut oil, as I was making it for a friend with milk protein allergies, and it turned out really tasty. I will definitely make this again!!

I have made this recipe (as written) many many times and it is always a huge hit.  I use a disposable (foil) turkey roasting pan and a strong spoon.  After letting it cool on waxed paper I store it in gallon bags.  It stays fresh for days.

This was very good but was a bit sticky even though I cooked it the full 5 minutes. I'll make it again but will cook a little longer.

This recipe turned out great! I popped 1 cup of kernels on the stove and doubled the caramel recipe. I knew there was no way I could fit the popcorn onto cookie sheets, so I used a turkey roaster and baked it at 200 degrees F. I can't stop eating it and neither can anyone else!

I wish I could rate this higher than a 5.  Absolutely perfect.  

Accidentally used 1/2 tablespoon( not teaspoon) baking soda, but turned out perfect.   Made 30 quarts of this for Christmas gifts and was PERFECT

SO good! I've never made homemade caramel corn before and this recipe was so easy!  I did read the reviews before I started out.  There is always good advice in them ;)

I popped 1 cup of kernels and had plenty of popped corn.  I used 2 sticks of salted butter (margarine has no place in my home ;) ) and I totally forgot to add the salt, baking soda and vanilla at the end.  The caramel was so amazing!

I didn't have a paper bag to dump the corn into so I just used my VERY clean kitchen sink.  Dumped all the popped corn in there, poured the caramel over it and mixed with a wooden spoon.  Then I scooped it all onto two big baking sheets and put them in the oven at 200 for 45 minutes as other posters recommended.

BEST caramel corn I've ever eaten!  Can't wait to make this again.

i make this all the time!  I use the margarine and it seems to come out better than when i use butter, I don't know why.  Also I have made and measured the popcorn over and over again, and every time, wit about 10 unpopped kernels, I use 2 CUPS of uncooked popcorn and it always always always makes 8 qts.
I make this recipe as stated and have never had a bad batch ..until I used the butter  ?  wonder why?

Wonderfully crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Used the seeds from a real vanilla pod instead of vanilla sugar, though.

Make this all the time! So so easy and the entire batch is usually gone in less than an hour! I have to double the recipe now just so it will make it until the next day. Every time someone new tastes it I have to give them the recipe so I printed about a dozen and keep them in my kitchen drawer. The only thing I do differently is I use air popped popcorn. I tried it with stove popped and microwave and its just not as light and crunchy PLUS you save a lot of fat & calories this way. A LOT!  So you can eat more lol.

Love recipe just as it is!!! I have used real butter, molasses, mixed fancy nuts, mixed candied nuts ( burned) etc etc - the best way to make it is just the way it is written! But! I do love to melt some ghiradelli chocolate and drizzle it on top! Put in freezer after to harden quicker .... to eat faster! I use aluminum turkey roaster pan did not like paper bag thing. I use 3- 3.5 oz bags microwave popcorn

I thought caramel corn would be really difficult, but this recipe is super-easy and tastes SO good! I have made it several times now and it is often requested at family get-togethers. I follow the recipe exactly, and don't add the peanuts.

Loved it and so did the family. I used almonds and pecans but next time will also add peanuts I just didn't have any. I also used butter as I do in all my baking but other than that, I made no changes. I used suggestions of cooking in a roasting pan which was helpful.  I have added this to my recipe box and this will be a Christmas tradition from now on. Thank you for sharing

Great recipe!  I gave it as Christmas gifts and it was quickly gobbled up. I don't buy corn syrup so I used molasses in its place, same amount.  Did everything else as directed and it was delicious. With the peanuts and molasses, it tasted just like homemade Cracker Jack.

This is so amazing! I have been making this now for a few years - it's a Christmas tradition now. 

I always triple the batch (six packages of microwave popcorn) and use two turkey roaster pans to stir. It helps to have my kids stirring the caramel into the corn with me! (I am asked for this recipe every time I give it to anyone - it makes perfect Christmas gifts wrapped up in pretty cellophane bags.)

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for submitting this!

This was just way too heavy and greasy tasting.  Followed recipe exactly.  If you want something on the lighter side don't use this recipe

AWESOME!  I wish this was for me!  My only change was to use butter in place of margarine because it was what I had on hand.  Long story short, this was one of the treats made for the fellows who load trucks with donated toys for the poor.  It adds more joy to what they already experience.  Thank you ANITALOUISE for sharing your AWESOME recipe!

This is the best caramel corn.  I give it out for gifts every year and I always get rave reviews.  I've even had friends call me up to see if I have any left over so that I can give them more!!

OMG is this stuff d e l i c i o u s!! 

I used two and a half bags of Pop Secret Movie Theater Butter microwave popcorn and thought this amount was perfect.

I tried the paper bag method, as suggested by others, it failed horribly for me.  To much of the caramel stuck to the bag, I was so disappointed.  

I made a second batch and used a turkey roasting pan, as suggested by another use, it turned out perfect!

Thank you Anita Louise for taking the time to share such a wonderful recipe.

This is the same recipe you can find many places, including I think the Jolly-time website. That being said it is delicious. Never have made any changes.

This is so good. I did use 3 bags of microwave popcorn and about 1 1/2
cups of cashews. Also used butter like most reviewers very easy recipe.

Used butter instead of margarine, skipped the vanilla but I will add it next time.  It is hard to measure seven quarts of popcorn, so I just made a bunch.  Could have used about a third more of the caramel mixture.  Or maybe even half again as much.  Doubling it might be just too over-the-top.  But I'm thinking about it.

I have made 6 batches of this recipe now and haven't had any desire to change a thing! My friends and family love it!! I used a large disposable deep pan with non-stick aluminum foil inside. It was a snap to clean up. Thanks so much for this recipe. It is truly awesome! I used 3 bags of buttered microwave popcorn: 2.9 oz each, worked perfectly and I did remove any unpopped kernels before I poured the caramel over the popped corn.

Oh my gosh... I need a distraction this caramel popcorn is so good I'm afraid I could easily eat it all!   I made an adjustment per the review of someone else.  I used 1/3 C of Light Corn Syrup and 1/3 C of Molasses (ulsulphured).   3 regular size bags of Orville R. Micro butter popcorn = 7 QTS.  Oven at 200 not 250 is what I chose.

Simply amazing!!!

This recipe is directly out of "Popcorn Cookery" by Larry Kusche, 1977, an "HP Book". There are a LOT of good recipes in this cookbook, if you can find it. Thank you Mr. Kusche.

I get rave reviews every time I make this caramel corn. It's delicious and it disappears in a flash! I leave out the peanuts because my kids don't like them, but that doesn't take away from the goodness. The only tweak I do is to use real butter instead of margarine.

Made 2 batches for a fundraiser bake sale.  One batch original recipe, another batch with the molasses & spanish peanuts for the Cracker Jack appeal. Used many suggestions from others, no need to ever try a different recipe for caramel corn.  Fantastic!

Having never made caramel corn before and having bad experiences with caramel/taffy candy I was very wary about making caramel corn.  I read this recipe and all the reviews at least as long as it took to make the caramel corn!  Love this recipe.  I can do it!  Thank you very much, original poster and other reviewers.  

I followed the advice of some other reviewers because I don't like to use corn syrup and used 1/2 cup molasses and 1/8 cup agave syrup because it was next to the molasses in the cupboard.  Yum!  I will absolutely make this recipe again and again.

Wonderful! Makes a pretty big batch which is good, because it disappears quickly. I use two air-popper batches of popcorn with one carmel recipe. Perfect.

Amish people use margarine? Well not this butter lover :-) I also don't use corn syrup, I substituted Lyle's Golden Syrup but I suppose you could use agave as well.Yummy, Yummy, Yummy.

I brought this to a potluck and it was a hit!  And cheap to make!  Now I know that instead of measuring out 28 cups of popcorn (7 quarts), I just have to do 2 popping sessions (2 regular bowls of popcorn).  I also thought it was interesting how it makes crackling noises while it's drying on the counter.

This recipe is excellent and very easy. We're dairy-free so I used coconut butter instead of margarine, and it turned out amazing!  We will have this all eaten by the day's end.

This recipe was one of, if not THE best dessert I have ever made. It's hard to make, it's monotonous, and can be tiring to make, but it is delicious. Be very careful in working with the caramel, too slow, and it hardens before getting on the popcorn, too fast, and it tastes funny.

YUM!!!  This was a very easy recipe! I had never made carmel corn before... I made 5 batches this Christmas!  Followed the recipe just as written.  Did use real butter and 3 bags of microwave popcorn as another reviewer suggested.  I found that you don't have to bake for an hour. ONe fo the batches started to smell burnt the lst 15 minutes so I cut teh baking time down to 45 minutes and it worked fine.

I made this recipe.. thinking about how hard it would be. But I will never eat regular microwave popcorn or buy caramel popcorn again. This is the best popcorn I have ever eaten. It did not last so be prepared to make it again. I gave as gifts and everyone asked for it again. I used butter and no nuts but I think I will try the other variations for a change. But if you follow the recipe, it will turn out perfect.

I came across this recipe a few years ago and make it at Christmas time for gifts. Seriously people, this is the best! I guarantee you people will rave. At my brothers birthday party we placed large paper bags on every table and a pretty well known Chef that was a guest could not wait to get his hands on this recipe. lovelove

Love this!  I use real butter and one 7 or 8 oz bag of Corn Puffs - found in the snack aisle (Jays, Vitners, Peerless, etc).  No worries about unpopped kernels; I put this in cute containers for Christmas; everyone loves it

I have tried this recipe twice.  The first time I tried it with the various modifications other reviewers suggested (butter over margarine, reduced bake temp, stirring more frequently, etc.).  Today I followed the recipe EXACTLY and both my husband and I preferred today's results.  Both attempts had good flavor, but today's version was crisper and didn't stick to the teeth...overall a better result.  Follow the recipe and you will be pleased!

Made just as called for (minus the nuts) and it really could have used more caramel sauce. I started pouring the sauce over and decided to leave out some of the popcorn just to have more sauce. Very good flavor but will double the sauce for next time

Made this last week for our family movie night and it was great! Because I was last minute to find a recipe for caramel corn, I didn't even bake it and it was very good. Next time I'll bake it and see the difference. We loved the sweet and gooey caramel!

This was pretty good. And sounds worse than it actually is. I'm wondering though how it would taste with just 1/2 cup of margarine. I used the full cup (1 stick of butter and 1 stick of margarine)and do feel it's a bit...not oily at least not by touch but taste. It melts in your mouth and I cant help but think that's the butter talkin. I will see what happens if I decrease this a bit. Sprayed 2 jelly roll pans with cooking spray and wiped off excess with paper towel. Used 2 bags of a generic butter microwave popcorn- sifted kernels and hulls out. placed 1 bag on each pan, mounded them in middle of pan, poured caramel on in a long row then used rubber spatula to coat the popcorn with caramel...THIS STUFF IS HOTTTT be careful (duh right? but still). Placed both pans in oven and set timer to beep at 20 minutes to remind me to stir. I did this 2 and a half times so popcorn was in oven for total of

This recipe is a hit at my house!  We gave it as gifts to my kids' teachers, and my kids request it often.  We've jazzed it up before with almonds and peanuts, but honestly the basic recipe is just great.  (And clean up is pretty easy too!)  
I make it in my turkey roasting pan, which works really well. 
THANKS FOR SHARING THIS DELICIOUS RECIPE!

This is such a fantastic recipe. I've made it four or five times for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. It is really important that you follow the recipe exactly. the first time I tried to make it i used a little less popcorn than it called for thinking it would make the coating on the popcorn thicker, and it made it really sticky and soggy. This is such a fantastic recipe and I really enjoyed it. Come Hanukkah, no one in my family will be without this delicious caramel corn as a gift. It's also great for parties.

MMMMMMMmmmmmm.....this is so good!!!  My son does not like sugary treats but he loved this!!  Yes, it is a little work but well worth it.  I measured out the popcorn into cups and thought, Wow, that's a lot of popcorn!!  Then made the carmel coating as directed but felt the popcorn was not coated well enough, so I made a second batch of coating and poured it on at it's first 15 minute stirring....My husband agreed that it looked and tasted sooo much better, and yes we must sample as we go!!   I had no problems with separating the popcorn, we had four pans in the oven at once, we would take out one dump it in a huge bowl, stir and dump it back on the pan and back in the oven, each time you stirred the popcorn it was less adherred to each other, when time was up it was already separated just needed spread on the counter, then try and not eat it....yeah right, yummy!!!

Straightforward recipe, excellent result!

To simplify clean up, I lined baking sheets with parchment paper (skipped greasing sheets) and just stirred the corn every 15 min as directed. When done in oven, transfer whole sheet with corn on wire rack to cool. Clean up was a breeze!

Makes a TON of really great carmel corn!! The only tip I would add is to use plain popcorn. I used movie theater butter popcorn because it's what I had in the pantry and I think that affected the taste a little. It was still really good, but it would be even better with plain popcorn as its base. Great recipe!!

Awesome as is!  To kick it up a notch, once it was cooled and laid out on the wax paper, I drizzled chocolate (sparingly) over it.  It looked beautiful and tasted even better!  Bake sale sell-out for sure!

This is very easy to make compared to the usual make caramel and stir fast before it hardens and barely covers all the popcorn! The periodic stirrings while baking in the oven is genius. I'll be making caramel popcorn more frequently with this.

Ended up baking and tossing much longer than the recipe called for--I wanted to make sure it was completely dry.  Made great Christmas gifts in tins.  My grandpa told me I was responsible for him gaining five pounds this holiday season, and my husband was sad I didn't make enough for us to keep.

I just finished making this and it is AMAZING!!! I was not expecting it to be this crazy good!!! I made it EXACTLY as written, peanuts and all, and would not change one thing. Store bought caramel corn does not even come close. As a matter of fact, they should not be compared or even called by the same name......Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

This is insanely good. I took some reviews suggestions and mixed it at first in the paper bag. I added craisins and almond slivers. This is amazing and I'll be making another batch since I'm probably going to eat the entire first batch I made to give away!

Very good - I used cashews and they all sank to the bottom but I also may have used a little too much popcorn so there wasn't enough of the caramel to go around - next time I will use a little less popcorn and see what happens.

This one is a winner!! I used a roaster as someone else had suggested for when it is in the oven and it worked out great. I was able to stir it without losing any and didn't have to dirty up 5 pans to cook it! And it was super easy! So that's a plus and I didn't have to make any changes to the recipe.

This is my first time making caramel corn, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I halved the recipe and omitted the nuts. I used one bag of boy scout popcorn. The caramel mixture sticks to EVERYTHING and is really hot so be careful! I dumped the mixture into a 9 by 13 inch pan and baked it a 220 degrees for about 40 minutes stirring about 3 times. It is deliciously sticky, sweet, salty at the same time, YUMMY!

So delicious!  This was my first time making caramel corn, so I wasn't sure how it'd turn out but it was great!  It was just a hair too salty for my tastes, but definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe for Halloween. My grandchildren and children came over they asked me more than once to make them a great big bag of it. This is the best carmel corn I have ever eaten!!  Didn't change one thing.    The only question I have is, can I make this in a big roaster pan? I used cookie sheets which were fine but, making big batches this weekend I was hoping to use something bigger. Thanks for posting this recipe, I recommend to anyone loving carmel corn to give it a try. You won't be sorry, I promise.

Great recipe and easy to make. After it was cool, I added malted milk balls, candy corn, and candy pumpkins to make a fall snack mix I saw in a specialty store.

This is delicious! I made it without the nuts and used butter instead of margin, I also needed to turn the oven temp down because my oven cooks a little high. So 225 for 45 mins was the perfect time. I took the advice of others and used a turkey roasting pan. It was the perfect size. This is very easy to make. It's gift worthy. You will not be disappointed!

Worked out really well! Love this recipe, have been using it for quite a while. I wouldn't make any ingredient adjustments. 2.5 bags of microwave popcorn seems to be plenty of popped corn for the 7 quarts needed.. I used 2 roasting pans and split the batch into them to make it easier to stir.

This was the first time I ever made caramel corn and it worked out great!  I made this for my daughter's 6th grade picnic and I know it's going to fly off the table happily.  I made it without peanuts to allow students with allergies to eat it.  I will try at home, but I think with almonds.  Thank you for this great recipe.  Once again allrecipes doesn't fail me!

Wow! This is the best I've tasted!! I used butter instead of margarine, and ended up having to turn the oven down to 200 deg. Will be making this again! What an indulgent treat.

Love this recipe!  I use pecans instead of peanuts most of the time because I usually have them in my pantry.  I have found that making it in a large roasting pan is easier than cookie sheets

This recipe is outstanding and always enjoyed to the very last kernal of corn.  I substitute butter for the margarine.  Butter makes everything better, I have to agree with Julia Child and Paula Dean.  YUM, YUM!

Oh yeah. This is fantastic. Just wish I had a bigger pan to toast it in the oven. Make sure your pan is big enough or it will be difficult to stir without getting all over the oven.

The absolute BEST! Very easy! My kids love this popcorn during any holiday! We Like to mix in mini marshmallows, chocolate chips and graham cracker cereal to the cooled caramel corn. Makes a great gift.  One hint though...we always add a little cinnamon to the pot when making the caramel coating!

WOW! This is absolutely delicious. Made as-is except used butter instead of margarine. I made it the first time using orville's 'original' kernels. The 2nd time I made it, I used orville's 'white' kernels and what a difference (smaller, whiter and much more tender!). I'll be making this for holiday treats this year and I can't wait!

This is the first caramel corn I have ever made, however, this is probably the best I have ever tasted.  I did not make it with nuts because I forgot to pick some up at the store, but it was great just the same.  I imagine next time I will make it with pecan as I think the flavor is already remeniscant of pralines (candied pecans).  I highly recommend this recipe.  Also, I used butter instead of margarine. YUM!

to make things easier for people, 28 cups of already popped corn is needed to make this recipe.  It's delicious; once you've figured out the amount you need.

I was looking for something to make for the troop's bake sale and this was a HUGE hit! I divided the popcorn into plastic bags and tied each with a curly ribbon. It was delicious and inexpensive to make.

I made it using 3 bags of microwave light butter popcorn, omitting the salt, and real butter.  It came out perfect.  My first time making caramel corn and it won't be my last.

Update:  I've been making it this way for 4 years now and it always comes out great.  People rave about it and ask for it every year.

Made this for a gift and everyone who tried (stole) some loved it. I thought it was a great basic recipe, turned out without a candy thermometer and gave me no problems (a novice to candy making). I tried it after all of the baking stages and think it really does need the hour in the over, MAYBE 45 minutes. I did add the peanuts and couldn not see it without, they were my favorite part. This recipe as written filled almost an entire empty popcorn tin (the kind with the scene on the outside and 3 types inside). My boyfriend commented it needed more caramel/less corn but no one else thought so. I won't look for another caramel corn recipe, thanks so much for sharing :)

This was so delicious!! I used 3 bags of extra-butter microwave popcorn per batch (along with the 1 C. butter in the sauce/topping). My oven runs hot so I baked them at 200 for only 45 minutes, stirring every 15. Turned out perfectly! Yummy taste and very crunchy!

This was my first time to make caramel corn. I made it exactly how it was written except I used 1 big turkey roasting pan instead of 2 pans. Since it was my first time making caramel corn, I wasn't sure if I should cover it or not. I chose not to cover it and I'm glad I didn't. It had a wonderful color to it! This will be a regular at our house for movie nights & holidays! Thank you!

BEWARE of the BURN!! Yes, this tastes yummy. However, and its a big however,  I found this to be a bit more labor intensive than I preferred. The stirring evry 15 min. is what I mean. A big mess!! AND, one pan burned even though I carefully tended it. Good, but not worth the trouble.

This recipe is fantastic. The only adjustments I made (per other reviews) are as follows: :: put the popcorn into a paper bag and poured caramel mixture into the bag for initial mix :: baked at 200 degrees; stirred every 15 minutes; total of 45 minutes.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe - great Christmas gifts for family and friends.

I have been making this recipe for a LONG time....I use butter as well and never put peanuts in until this year....it was EXCELLENT!  To the cook who said this was "grainy" did you leave it in the oven long enough?   I have never messed this recipe up...yet!  LOL SO....5 BIG stars and MORE!

Fabulous! Easy to do, tastes awesome, & makes a great gift. I used 2 packages of Newman's Own simply salted popcorn and omitted the salt from the recipe. I also used butter rather then margarine.

This is so addictive!  Very easy to make.  The amount of topping is perfect for the amount of popcorn.  Too often you are left with plain kernels, but this was not the case with this recipe.

This was fabulous!  It works very well to use a roasting pan for baking.  I made it just as the recipes indicated.  I may try white sugar and molasses like others suggested just to see what it taste like, but the making it as the recipe states is wonderful!

ok, this was easy and tasty!  I did use a roaster to bake in the oven (which help with the stirring as well) and also 4 cups of popcorn = 1 quart.  Not as much popping as one might think.  Only 2 pans for me to pop.

This is absolutely THE BEST caramel corn I have ever eaten.  Very easy to make.  I didn't change a thing.  This is one recipe that doesn't need tweeking.  I have been asked for the recipe so many times, and someone even told me I should sell it.

I made this caramel corn for the first time a few weeks ago and it was FABULOUS!! It disappeared quickly and was so easy to make. I followed the recipe as written except that I substituted butter for the margarine. I used my large turkey roasting pan and cooked it for the whole hour. YUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMM

Found this recipe recently and have made it twice in less than a week's time for just the two of us - I could eat this all day without getting sick of it.  I have not made caramel corn in years and enjoy making it now - I used regular popcorn instead of microwave, the kernals are very crispy once they have been baked with the caramel, not sure if I would even try microwave popcorn.  When popping the corn on the stove I used 1 1/2 c of unpopped corn, popping 1/2 c at a time. Popcorn did not burn especially if the bottom of the pan was covered with oil.  Planning on using this recipe for my Christmas gifts for my co-workers this year.  My husband even enjoys helping make this little treat (he's the popcorn popper and caramel coater).

I just made this caramel corn and it is WONDERFUL!!! I was about an 1/8 of a cup short of the kayro, so I use maple syrup. Then after it came out of the oven and cooled I drizzled it with a little melted chocolate!!!!! This won't last long!!!!!!

My mom couldn't remember the recipe for the caramel corn she usually makes other than it calls for white sugar and not brown. So we tried this one, and OMG this is going to be MY recipe. I loved this recipe, in fact I liked it better than my mothers. Everyone thought it tasted like cracker jacks. I cant wait to make this again. Yummy!

This is the best caramel corn. Everyone I have ever made it for has LOVED it. I followed the recipe exactly as written. The first time I halved it, b/c I thought 7 quarts was a lot. Everytime since though, I have made the full amount. It's just so good. We HAVE to share.

Great flavor!  The biggest reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it was extremely difficult to get the caramel to coat the corn evenly.  I tried pouring/stirring and I tried the paper bag method.  I have found that the microwave method of making this (Microwave Caramel Popcorn from this cite) actually makes a more evenly coated batch, using a paper bag works and its faster and easier.  Again, the recipe is great, but my biggest frustration is with getting the caramel to coat the popcorn.  Will probably only use the microwave recipe from now on.  I used 2 1/2 bags of microwave popcorn and baked for 45 minutes at 250 degrees.

Although this certainly doesn't need more 5 star reviews, I'll write mine in hopes it helps me remember and may help someone else a little when they try it.  It turned out great in the end, but, following the advice of barefootlady, I only cooked 45 minutes at 200.  In my oven, at least, that was a mistake.  Even after cooling, it was so gummy it was one big clump.  The next day, I put it back in the oven, at 250 this time, and cooked, stirring after 15 minutes, another 30 minutes.  Then, I dumped it out on waxed paper, again, and it was just as it should be.  I also took a little of discobunny's advice and used about 2 1/2 bags of Orville's microwave butter popcorn and added a couple of tablespoons of molasses to the Karo with good results.  Don't leave out the nuts!  It's all yummy.

I made this using 1.25 cups of un-popped corn, and the suggested modifications of using butter and baking it at 200 degrees for 45min. I also used the paper bag trick. Worked out perfectly for me, and I am no cook. The first time I made it, everyone loved it and it was gone FAST. I just made it again for tonights pre-Halloween party. Equally as good this time. I'm sure everyone at the party will love it! I just hope I don't eat it all before then. LOL.

I only had about 5 quarts of popcorn but it still turned out perfectly. I dumped the popcorn on a clean kitchen surface to separate. Clean up was a breeze. Also, to clean the pans, I ran hot tap water over them, scrubbed with a brush and all the hardened caramel melted away.  Followed the recipe to a T - fabulous item at a bake sale!

Wow. This is really good! I mailed half of it to my college aged daughter in a care package - but I could have eaten it all myself!! I did use butter instead of margerine because I'm of the belief that butter is better for your health.

Amazing caramel corn!  I have never made it before, but I'll make it again and will definitely use this recipe! We made this for a carnival sponsored by our church, so we didn't put any peanuts in due to possible peanut allergies from our guests.  We also chose to use butter, because that is what we had on hand. Unfortunately.... I'm thinking we should have made more because we probably ate 1/2 a batch to "test it"!!!  :)  Thanks for this awesome recipe!  Oh... and clean up was surprisingly easy!  With our greased pans and spoons, it all washed up with just soap and hot water!

this is easy to make, easy to clean up and delicious. In a house full of teen-agers who have frequent visitors, it doesn't stand a chance! The kids look for more whenever they come over. The only change I have made is to cut the vanilla in half, because all of the corn syrup in our stores has a lot of vanilla in it and it gets a bit overpowering for our tastes. Thank you!

Wonderful, easy and plenty of caramel!  Make sure to grease pan generously and clean up is a breeze.

This is excellent; yields a product better than what you can buy, in my family's opinion.  I pop the corn using the 'Microwave Popcorn' method found on this site.  An easy, wonderful and inexpensive treat!

This was perfect.  The only change I made was to substitute 1 stick of the marjarine with 1 stick of butter.  We made it twice already, once with the peanuts and once without.  I like it better without. It was a huge hit!!

I've been making caramel corn for years, but the last time we moved my recipes were misplaced... so I had to use AllRecipes to find what I wanted. And this is GREAT! Tip: I use brown paper grocery bags to pour and mix the caramel onto the popped corn (clean up is use - just throw the bag away!).

This is a great treat but I think I found an eaiser way to make it. I use CORN PUFFS. Like Vitners or O-Kee-Do-Kee brand. You use the same ingredients as the pop corn recipe. Try It.

I have been making caramel corn like this for years. But I have a harder time with microwave popcorn so I suggest using regular popcorn. Also make sure you use dry roasted nuts if adding as any other nut will not taste right.

I thought this recipe was fantastic. It was my first time making caramel corn and I got some very good feedback. I'm not too much of a sweet person so I had to take half next door to share with the neighbors and they loved it.

This recipe is wonderful...I made a batch today for New Year's and everyone just gobbled it up!  Based on some other reviews, I did add 2 teaspoons of black strap molasses, substituted butter for margarine and reduced the oven temperature to 225 degrees F.  Also, 1 1/2 cups of unpopped popcorn does turn out to be 7 quarts (28 cups) once popped. I used a regular lasagna pan and a nonstick roasting pan...the higher sides of the roasting pan worked out much better for stirring and the nonstick surface made it a snap to clean up. I will definitely be making this again and giving it for holiday gifts next year...Thanks!

I made this (among other goodies) for Christmas presents and it was a hit!  Next time I am going to try and mix the nuts in when I pour the carmel over the popcorn - otherwise all of the nuts sink to the bottom of the popcorn making it harder to get a good mix of popcorn and nuts.

This was great!  It was easy to make and great to give as gifts.  I did over cook it though, had a slight burnt taste. I think I would either lower the baking temp or cooking time to 45 mins...perhaps it's just my oven.  But great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best caramel popcorn I've tried.  Homemade or store-bought.  It makes a hard popcorn, not soft, but it melts in your mouth without sticking to your teeth the way some do.  My husband loved it so much that we made it twice in one week to hand out on our Christmas goody plates.

This is the best recipe. I also use dry roasted peanuts. Easy to find & inexpensive. I use my largest roasting pans. Don't worry about cleanup. If you put the pans in hot water for a short time, the caramel will practically dissolve right off the pan. Clean up is really a snap. I am planning on making lots of gallon bags to give out over Christmas.

Not too happy about this one. Maybe I boiled the mixture too long, because it turned out tasting burnt. Someone suggested baking it at 200 instead of 250. I tried that for 30 minutes, but eventually turned it back up to 250 because the mixture would never soften up to spread around. It was in the oven for about an hour and a half. I tried saving it by sprinkling sugar over while it cooled, but the burnt taste was still there. :( Edited January 09-I made this again and didn't boil it as long. It came out wonderfully! I didn't add any peanuts because of family's preference, but I'm sure it would have added to it greatly!

This recipe is amazingly tasty and easy to prepare - however, there is one reason I did not give it five stars. I made about 4 quarts of popcorn and decided to make the full amount of caramel to make it super-sweet and caramelicious, but it seems that even having used almost half the amount of popcorn and the full amount of caramel my popcorn isn't as coated as I'd like. I would recommend multiplying the caramel by 1.25. Like I said though, otherwise it is a great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing.

Yum! Super easy to make, I only did half the recipes (wanted to make sure it was good before I had a ton of it!) I used 1 3.5 oz bag of lightly buttered popcorn (make sure you pick out any pieces that don't pop before you add the caramel) and halved the rest of the ingredients, leaving out the nuts. I baked it at 225 for 45 min, stirring every 15 min. Cleanup was easy, with the exeception of the wooden spoon which I didn't butter before stiring the popcorn! Will certainly be making this many more times!

What a great recipe! The caramel stayed chewy and gooey but firm enough that I could press it into a springform pan and set it as a birthday cake for my popcorn junky sister (click on my profile to see the pic). It was a huge hit :)

Wow this recipes is the best. So simple and so good. Next time I will use real butter for a little more flavor. I also mix the popcorn and peanuts up in a brown paper bag, so easy to clean up.
I add 1/3 C. corn syrup and 1/3 C. Molasses.

So so good!  I used air popped popcorn,and unsalted butter-because those are what I had on hand.  The only thing I will do differently next time is use a disposible turkey roasting pan, so I can stir the corn without some of it falling off the pans.  
This is going on my Christmas baking list

Hellllloooo fat pants! I made this 2 days ago and have since eaten it all myself. Deeelicious and very easy to make. (BTW, I substituted with pecans.) I suggest using parchment paper to help ease cleanup. 
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe. I will be making it again for Christmas!

it took me a couple times to get this right, but it was very good once I did.  The first time it was too chewy and a little soggy, so be sure you have a big enough pan to spread it out in and stir it at regular intervals.  The second time I was able to get it more crisp but the caramel topping actually tasted a tad burnt.  Third try I got it right.  Just make sure to check it often.  Even though the first two batches weren't perfect we still ate every bite, so you pretty much can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is sooo Yummy!! The first batch I ended up burning a bit because I followed the receipes recommended temperture and cooking time.  I think 200 degrees is a more accurate cooking time. At least where I live. Thank you.. This is so simple and easy. I'm putting some in my "movie bag" to take with us tonight thanks again.. Update: I made it again....  But I used cashews instead of peanuts and drizzled milk chocolate over the top after it came out of the oven. Put in the freezer for a fast 5 minute set up and it was to die for.... Can't wait to experiment again maybe with macadamia nuts...

The flavor was good, although not as sweet as I thought it was going to be. It was also a bit on the greasy side. That said, it was all gone in one day.

not bad but nothing to rave about.  it had a nice flavor but we were hoping for a bit of a softer caramel popcorn.  this definitely is the crispy kind with a very thin coating.

This caramel corn was pretty good. I added mixed nuts (almonds/cashews/peanuts) because I'm not a fan of just peanuts alone. Next time, I think I'll make more caramel to put over the top, because I didn't feel like the corn was coated enough. I made 6 quarts of popcorn, but it still wasn't coated to my liking, although still very good. I enjoyed eating the caramel off of the spoon... yummy!

This is good stuff.  I made mine in a big roasting pan and when I made the sauce added an extra 2 Tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar to make sure there would be enough to cover the popcorn.  I also tried melting some red hots into it, but they didn't completely disolve.

I knew this recipe was a keeper when a co-worker who likes to dislike anything said it was the best caramel corn he'd ever had. I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted and that worked best. I tried with the oven at 200 for 45 mins but it didn't keep the caramel soft enough and ended up just breaking all of the popcorn. If you use bag popcorn I suggest kettle corn it complements the caramel perfectly.

Make this every year! I always have to make 2-3 batches, as it goes really fast - taking it in small bags to school for teachers, and to church for a fundraiser, I ended up giving out the recipe as much as the popcorn!

This stuff really is pretty awesome!  I made it at the last minute for a Christmas party and ended up forgetting to grease the pans.  To my surprise, it really wasn't a big deal!  We also had to dump the corn out onto plastic placemats sprayed with PAM since I was out of waxed paper.  Still worked pretty well!  The amount in the recipe made a good party snack for 12+ people.

I have made this twice already and it is definately becoming one of my favorites.  The recipe is pretty simple and it tastes better than any caramel corn I have ever had.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Very good!  My first attempt at ever making caramel corn turned out quite well.  I'm always on the look out for dairy and nut free recipes for my 2 year old son who has allergies.  This recipe doesn't need much modification to be dairy-free (actually, vegan) and nut-free.   I just omitted the peanuts, and used Earth Balance "margarine".  I also used the paper bag trick to mix the popcorn and the caramel mixture.  Good stuff my whole family can enjoy!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Excellent taste and very easy to make. Added peanuts and it was very good, but next time will add pecans.  Has a very buttery flavor.

Excellent- my kids love it.  It takes just like Cracker Jacks.  I liked it because it wasn't sticky and messy.  Great texture and great flavor.

This is insanely good. The kernels just melt in your mouth. I used 3 bags of plain microwave popcorn and it was just the right amount for the amount of caramel in the recipe. Very easy, takes a little time, but who cares when it tastes this good!

I made this for Christmas gifts. I made a HUGE batch! lol So I did half in the brown paper sack in the microwave and the other I made in the oven.
Couldn't tell a difference. They loved it all! I will be making this again. Thank you for the awesome recipe!
God Bless

What can you say after 172 good reviews?  This recipe was easy to make and tasted awesome.  Even better the next day.  I used dark corn syrup because I didn't have white and it was really good.  This recipe is great for a crowd but I think for our family I will cut the recipe in half as it makes a LOT!  I used other review tips and poured the caramel mixture over the popcorn in a paper bag then stirred.  That worked out well.  I also baked it for 45 minutes in 2 roasting pans.  One large pan and one smaller.  The caramel corn wasn't sticky at all.  Just perfect.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

On my gosh!!!!  This recipes ROCKS!!!!  I made it last night and was planning on bagging it all to give as gifts but we ate half before it even cooled!  The only thing I changed was the oven temperature to 225 instead of 250.  
Thanks for a great recipe!  :o)

Excellent recipe!  Very easy too!  This was a fun recipe to try because I popped fresh popcorn and this was the first time I used an air popper.  My 15 month old was amazed by it! :-)  I think I may make a second batch.  Good idea with putting it into a paper bag to coat.

This is the same recipe that is on the back of the popcorn I bought. It is good however a bit chewy. Not as crunchy as I would have liked. Our jaws were getting tired from chewing.

I just made this caramel corn and it was great!  I cut the recipe in half.  I used butter instead of maragine as other reviewers recommended.  I also used butter flavored popcorn because it was what I had on hand.  I will make this again for sure.

I REALLY loved this stuff!  It was such a fun treat and it was easy to make too.
It is a little too chewy though and it hurt my jaw so I couldn't eat very much at a time.
I would recommend this stuff for a nice rainy day though. :)

Great popcorn.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine, and it tasted a lot like Crunch 'N Munch popcorn.

Great recipe!  I used some molassas as someone suggested, so good.  I also made half a dozen carmel balls that I just let sit and cool and then cooked the rest.  I didn't have a pan big enough, it makes alot.  The carmel corn was yummy and I was delighted that the carmel balls were just as delicious!  A double use recipe...carmel popcorn balls or carmel corn :)

Easy, Tasty, Excellent gift idea! It shipped well when packaged tightly. I used peanuts and even drizzled a batch lightly with thin ribbons of chocolate (melted semisweet chips) - chocolate took awhile to "dry" but have saved this recipe and recommend to friends!!! Make this today! (I used an air popper to make the corn and it's way easier than stove-top popping:)

I made this last year for the first time at Thanksgiving and it was a requested item again this year!  My Mom just told me that for Christmas day, if I don't bring the caramel corn, I don't get presents!!!  Sometimes I throw in almonds or cashews instead of, or with the peanuts but no matter what it's always yummy and easy!

This was my first try at caramel corn and it was great. I made two batches because the first one seemed to "disappear". I used mixed nuts for the first batch and cashews and peanuts for the second.

This was easy (if you don't overload the baking pans) and great tasting.  I made it for a church function, and the ladies thought it was HEAVENLY.  Even dieters ate some!

Unbelievably Yummy!
My husband just placed an order for two recipes worth - to take to the fire station tomorrow.  Guess I will be making Caramel Corn tonight!
I pulled my first batch out of the oven about 15 minutes to early, but the caramel was starting to brown, and I didn't want it to burn.  I think that is what made it so chewy.  I did cook at 250 degrees, but I had just taken a pizza out of the oven that had been cooking at 400 degrees, so that may have made the difference.  I also used half margarine and half butter.
Excellent recipe - extremely easy and oh so yummy!
Thanks for sharing!

A Christmas tradition I make and give every year...very fun. 

For variety, I put a little cinnamon into the caramel mixture. But then, I like cinnamon in everything.

Made this multiple times. The only thing I did a little differently is sometimes used cashews, peanuts or pistachios. All good. I think I am going to try a little shaved coconut next time. This recipe is easy and pretty foolproof. Everyone loves it - almost a staple in the household now!

So good! And so easy! I was out of corn syrup so I substituted with 1 cup of pancake syrup. Worked out great! As another reviewer said I baked at 200 degrees for 45 mins, stirring every 15 mins. Also used 2 popped bags of microwave popcorn. I used a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil. Clean up and transfer to wax paper was easy! Def gonna make again. Prob would be great to make a big batch for a party!

This is delicious!  The only problem I had with the recipe is trying to stir the popcorn on two large cookie sheets.  I had trouble keeping it on the pans while getting it coated well.  Pans with edges would have been very helpful for me so I will try to do that next time.  And there will be a next time!

I listened to the tips and reduced oven temp to 200 and cooking time to 45 minutes.  I used butter instead of margarine.  This was UNREAL delicious, definitely worthy of my plan to give out as a christmas gift to coworkers and my daughter's teachers.

I've made this for years!Everybody loves it!Makes great Holiday gifts! 

Amish Caramel Corn Notes!!
1.preheat oven to 250°
I only cook this for 40 minutes as instructed below.
Also i don't put nuts in it due to allergies and also is messes up the caramel in my opinion!!
Last but not least i only use butter in the recipe,its worth it trust me!
2.spray a roasting pan with cooking  spray
3.cover counter with wax paper to cool caramel corn on
4.cook 4-5 large bags extra butter flavored microwave popcorn
5. dump popcorn into a colander and pick out unpopped kernels.When finished dump into roasting pan
(Usually end up with 7.5 -8 quarts popcorn)
6.cook caramel over medium low,stirring constantly.once caramel just starts to boil.Set timer for 5 minutes and continue stirring.
7.When timer goes off  shut off and stir in vanilla & baking soda quickly to incorporate .Pour evenly and quickly over popcorn stirring quickly to coat.
Don't worry if its not all coated,it will be when its done.
8.put in oven to cook.
1---Set timer 15 minutes/stir quickly &thoroughly to coat.
2---Set timer for 15 minutes/stir quickly&thoroughly to coat
3---Set timer for final 10 minutes/stir  and finish baking
9.Stir &dump onto wax paper covered counter too cool!! 
break up large clusters
10.Bag and enjoy!!
Makes great gifts !!

Came out awesome!  The only item I added that was not included in the recipe was cream of tartar to minimize the crystallization of the caramel.

Made this as written, except I used a mix of pecans, slivered almonds and cashews, and increased the nuts by about 2/3 of a cup.  My whole family loves this, even the ones who don't like popcorn. Just follow the recipe... it really is foolproof.

I was hoping to find an old recipe for Peanut Butter Caramel Corn, and this recipe is almost exactly the same. I used air-popped corn, from about a half cup of kernels, and carefully transferred the popped corn into a greased roasting pan, so that there were no un-popped kernels, then added about 2 cups of salted peanuts. I liked Spanish the most, but any kind will do.  I followed the caramel recipe using butter, and once the caramel had boiled for 5 minutes I added a cup of smooth--Crunchy works just as well--peanut butter and then the vanilla and baking soda. Let it bubble for a minute, and immediately drizzled the caramel PB mixture all over all of it, gently stirred with it with a greased spatula until the corn and nuts are fairly well coated, and divided the mix onto two sheet pans. Baked the pans at 250 degrees for about an hour and a half, tossing gently every 15 minutes, and rotating the pans top to bottom each time too. Let cool till I could handle heat and tossed the mix till it was cool and loose enough to bag it, I used some plastic bread bags and got about 6 of them. Don't crush!
Years ago I sold this at our farmer's market, if we didn't eat it all first! 
This is the best keeper I think I've ever made too, a week is best but will keep a little longer before it gets soggy. I've even frozen it successfully. I know the original recipe will be great too, just because It looks almost Identical to the one I'd lost.

I halved the recipe and Used butter and honey roasted peanuts because that’s what I had on hand. Scrumptious! Easy recipe and best caramel corn i‘ve ever eaten. Beware—you will want to eat the whole bowl.

I made this for my coworkers. A few said it was the best caramel corn they had ever had. I added 1 & 1/2 cups salted peanuts & 1 & 1/2 cups salted cashews. And, like others suggested, I did use butter. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Delicious. Used butter instead of margarine.  So easy to make. Used large roasting pans on middle and bottom racks. Baked for 45 min and turned every 15 min.

Baked for an hour at 225 degrees. 
Used butter instead of margarine. 
Used three bags of cheap micro popcorn. 
Didn't have brown sugar so I used white. 
I sprinkled salt on the whole batch after baking. 
I thought caramel corn would be hard to make. 
Not so. 
Melts in your mouth.  Love it. 
I am now a hero in my home. 
Thank you Anita Louise!!!!

I don't use a microwave oven so I made my popcorn the old fashioned way, in a pot on the stove with oil.
I made the caramel corn using the directions, but took the advice of reviewers mentioned on the video to bake it in 200° oven. Every recipe I have used for caramel corn call for a 250° oven, so I was kind of surprised by the lower temp. 
Anyway, after the 2nd turning, I decided to turn up the heat to 250° as the caramel was not softening enough in the oven to get a good coating. Worked perfectly! 
I will continue to use the higher oven temp when I make this. Also I used butter instead of margarine. I think I would also add another teaspoon of vanilla next time.

This is the best caramel popcorn I've made! I did make it a little differently than the original because of what I had on hand. I used butter instead of margarine, I used 1 bag of original skinny pop popcorn, and I microwaved the caramel instead of cooking it on the stove. I also baked it at 200 degrees for 45 minutes stirring every 15 as many suggested. Although it is a little different than the original, it turned out very good.

4.5 stars.  I wish I would have made either less popcorn, or a bit more caramel.  It covered each kernel, but I would have liked a thicker coating.  If I make this recipe again, I would probably use a bit less popcorn.  I used 1 1/2 c. of almonds instead of the peanuts listed.  The flavor was good though.  I'll be giving this as a gift and I believe the recipient will enjoy this popcorn.

Unbelievably good.  Absolutely addictive.  Takes awhile to make,  but it's worth it. 
I popped 4 bags of microwave popcorn. After popping, I "sieved" the popcorn through a cooking rack so that the unpopped kernels would drop out, as another poster mentioned.
I doubled the sauce ingrediants,  used half light corn syrup and half unsulphured molasses,  used butter,  and added a bit more baking soda. I also added red skin peanuts 
Impt: the sauce almost boiled over when I added the vanilla at the end,  so be careful. 
I split the popcorn between two disposable big lasagna pans. I ladeled the hot sauce over the popcorn and stirred in between ladelfuls.
Stuck it in a 200° oven for about 50 minutes,  taking the pans out and stirring vigorously every 15 min. 
I sprayed a couple gallon plastic bags with Pam, and dumped the popcorn into the bags. 
For the next hour or so,  I massaged the bags to break up the clumps of popcorn as they cooled.
I took this to a Christmas party, and they DEVOURED it. 
My husband made me put it away because he couldn't stop eating it. 
Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made the first batch according to recipe and burned 1/2 of it, the bottom rack in the oven burned!  The good 1/2 was excellent.  I tried again and made a 1/2 batch instead of a whole batch but...I poured the caramel sauce over the popcorn in a big bowl first, then turned it onto a cookie sheet before baking - turned out perfect!  Oh, and I also turned down the oven a notch - 225 degrees - 250 is just a tad too hot.

Where has this recipe been my whole life? I love caramel corn and this is the best homemade caramel corn I've ever tried. Based on other reviewer's feedback, I tried a 200 degree oven first. However, I found that the corn wasn't as crunchy as it should have been. In fact, it was a bit too chewy. So I turned up the oven to 250 degrees and tried baking it again. After another 30 minutes, it was perfect. The coating was crunchy, just as you'd expect it to be if you bought it from a candy store. I'm going to package this up in holiday treat bags for friends and neighbors. I also agree with others that it's not difficult to make and it is SO much cheaper than buying it. Thank you Anita Louise!

I know this recipe is very similar to another, so I thought it couldn't really be any better, but it sure is!  This recipe is absolutely perfect.  Every.Single.Time!!  We use 3 bags of microwave popcorn for this recipe.  I use lightly buttered and salted.  Always, always use the best popcorn.  Oh, and I use Karo dark corn syrup, because it's not high fructose.  Enjoy!!

So far I have made 5 batches of this for gift giving this Christmas! I have made 1 nut free due to allergies in the family,  and used different nuts in different batches. My taste tester says they are all great. I put parchment paper on the counter top & just dump the mix on it when it 's done baking.  I substituted dark brown for the light brown sugar with one batch and it too was good.. Maybe because I use  a 18" x 12" x 3" lasagna pan instead of the baking sheets  baking for 1 hr @ 250 F is perfect. Easy and delicious!

I've made this several times (without peanuts due to folks' allergies) and it never lasts long enough to get stale.  It's one of my go-to recipes if I need to take something to a party or potluck and it always goes over well.  It's even easier if you use microwave popcorn (3 standard bags yields about 7 quarts) but I've been equally pleased with both stovetop or air popped and microwave. I've sometimes used butter instead of margarine, depending on what I had on hand, and both work well. Using a silicone spatula to stir with keeps the caramel from sticking and parchment paper makes a good substitute for wax paper when cooling the caramel corn (just be aware 7 qts. of popped corn takes up a fair amount of space) I'm planning to give this out as gifts over the holidays as it's been so popular with friends, coworkers and family. The tricky bit will be remembering to set some aside for myself before it disappears.

This is the best Caramel Corn recipe I have ever made and I have tried a few! It stayed crisp and delicious until the last kernel was consumed. It is so good that my two granddaughters, ages 3 & 6, after tasting a gourmet brand, told their parents that Nana’s was better! This is the keeper recipe for me. Thank you for sharing it! I made it exactly as stated in recipe.

My son needs a dairy free recipe, so we replaced the margarine with earth balance vegan butter instead. The kids enjoyed it. It was similar to a buttery recipe we used to make and is a nice substitute so that we can still enjoy caramel corn.

Absolutely delicious!  We make this any time we want to take our popcorn to the next level of awesomeness.  Just make sure put the timer on when you're stirring the caramel sauce - it really does need the full time.

I popped 1 cup of kernels and used butter instead of margarine.  Turned out great.  I mixed it all in a roasting pan and heated it at 200 degrees, stirred every 15 minutes for 45 minutes and cooled on wax paper on the counter.

I made no changes.  I made this just as the recipe stated and it turned out great.  I made it to share at our annual cookie bake.  Everyone loved it and wanted to know who had time to make homemade caramel corn!  I will definitely make this again.

Yummmmmm!!! This awesome caramel corn and my family cannot get enough. The one thing that will ensure the caramel will come out perfect is to make sure it reachs the soft ball candy stage, otherwise the sugar will remain grainy; other than that perfect!!!

I'll never buy caramel corn again!  I made this for a monthly game night with friends and we devoured it!  I took advice from a few reviewers and made with 2 bags of plain microwave popcorn.

I made this following the directions but only used 6 quarts of popcorn since that is how much I made with my micro-wave popper. I baked it for the full hour at 250 and I think it would have been better at 45 minutes as some others said.   For me I like the Classic Caramel Corn recipe on this site better.  I also like the taste better using light brown sugar instead of dark.

I used 3 bags of Puff Corn, the hulless popcorn. I also doubled the coating recipe and used butter as recommended by others. Be sure to let the coating come to a boil slowly  over low to medium heat. I use a large granite turkey roasting pan that has been sprayed with butter flavored Pam to coat the popcorn, but an aluminum turkey pan would work too. I baked it at 200 degrees for an hour turning every 15 minutes. This has been a huge hit wherever I take it. My family asks me to bring it to family functions. I haven't found another recipe that is better.  Using hulless popcorn allows kids with braces to eat it and toddlers  can enjoy it too.

Awesome and easy to make.  I used butter instead of margerine.  I also didn't spread it out on the counter but just left it in the roasting pans I made it in.  It falls apart which you put it into containers

Love this!  So addictive. I substituted butter for margarine and did watch the oven temp to make sure not burning.   I used both a thicker baking pan and throw away aluminum pans. The popcorn on throw away pan was a bit chewier at first and I was a little worried but after it cooled it was just as good.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

After throwing out my first two batches due to burnt peanuts, I decided to add my peanuts at the very end. I would also recommend protecting your eyes when you break your peanut brittle. I had a piece pop up into my eye. Luckily I closed my eye before it got in and it landed on my eyelash. Those shards are very sharp and can do some real damage!

As written, this recipe did not work. I followed the instructions and ingredients EXACTLY, and it turned out grainy and chewy. I believe the problem is with the caramel-making part - it needs instructions for what temperature (on a candy thermometer) to bring the mixture to. Even after boiling for 5 minutes, the temperature was only 225 degrees - I later read on a different website that it needs to be 300 degrees to achieve the right hardening/crunch for caramel corn. The ingredients had a decent flavor, so I'm sure if the caramel-making part had been written differently, it would've turned out more successfully. After the long amount of time and ingredients I put into this round, though, I'm just left feeling frustrated.

Hy husband says this tastes just like his grandma's! I used 2 bags of movie theater butter popcorn, switched out butter for the margarine, and baked for only 40 minutes. Perfect!! Best recipe I've tried for caramel popcorn (and I've tried A LOT over the years as I've been trying to recreate hubby's family recipe every Christmas since about 1990!)!

Yummy! Not going to last long :) I used two bags of Microwave popcorn and used 2 deep baking dishes.  I did one with peanuts and one without.  One note: don't let the unpopped kernels fall into the baking dishes when you're pouring the popcorn in.

I always get the "free refill" popcorn at the theater.  It's about 5 quarts so I adjust the recipe accordingly.  It is delicious and disappears very quickly!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this today while I'm on vacation for the thanksgiving  holiday.  This had great flavor.  I only had butter so I used that instead of margarine. The only problem that I had was that I adjusted the recipe to a serving of ten and there was not enough caramel to cover all of the popcorn. I'm not sure what happened, but needless to say I will be making this again with double the coating.  Thanks for sharing.

PERFECT! Just make sure you use wax paper as instructed, not parchment paper. Otherwise, it’ll turn out chewy instead of crunchy

Everyone seems to be picking the kernels out of the popcorn by hand.  The easy way is to pour the popped corn into a bowl, top it with a wire rack used for cookies or pastries, flip it over the sink or a garbage bag and shake.  All of the kernels will fall to the bottom and out.  I put the popcorn in a large lightly buttered roasting pan, while heating the oven to 250 degrees.  I think this crisps up the popcorn.  I have tried it at 200, but the 250 degrees  thins the carmel and coats the popcorn better. This recipe is delicious and I make it often.

For those commenting on their finished product being “chewy” or “grainy” , the problem is not the recipe. In order to get that crunchy caramel corn you need to heat your caramel to the “hard crack” stage.  In order to accomplish this you should get a candy thermometer that lists the different stages on it.

Not that this recipe needs another review, but I wanted to share how I make it with air-popped corn.  I make two batches with my air popper.  I distribute the corn between 2 half-sheet pans and and a 13 inch square pan.  Then I increase the caramel sauce by 50%--add half more of everything.  Then the sheet pans go into my oven, and the little pan goes into my toaster oven.  Stir and swap the two between upper and lower racks every 15 minutes for an hour.  Turns out perfect every time!  Thanks for a great recipe.  We have been enjoying it for years.

My family and I have been making this recipe for years.  Everybody loves it. We do use butter, instead of margarine, but don't change anything else.  My husband requested I make it today so he can snack on it while watching basketball.  He loves it too!

Made this according to instructions (but used real butter rather than margarine). I used 3 bags of Blast-o-butter popcorn and it was the perfect amount of popcorn for the caramel sauce.  My family loved it!  Next time I think I will use mixed nuts rather than peanuts.  This will be a regular recipe at our house.

Act ll butter popcorn, 2 bags were perfect. My oven runs a tad hot, so I baked at 225 degrees for the first 35 minutes and then bumped it up to 250 degrees for the last 25 minutes. I've never made this before, it is VERY good. Better than any in a box. At first, I didn't think there was enough caramel, but after stirring every 10 minutes or so, it was plenty to cover all the popcorn.  Better than my childhood favorit Cracker Jacks too. You gotta add roasted spanish peanuts, awesome!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.  The ingredients and flavor are a 5 star, but the given procedures to  make it get a 1 star.  I should have known that there would be some issues with messiness when the instructions said to mix the popcorn and caramel together in a shallow baking pan.   I was able to salvage the caramel corn, by forming it into caramel popcorn balls though.  I will make this again, but next time I will mix the popcorn and caramel in a mixing bowl before transferring it to the baking dish.

Wow, This is good, I hate when people comment on a recipe they don't follow, but I had no choice but to split butter and margarine, only  had one cup of brown sugar left so I used it and added, one cup of corn sypup and half a cup of maple syrup. The result was awesome. I will try it again next weekend, this time following the recipe, Thanks for sharing !

All I can say is that it's a good thing I made two batches because my girls devoured the first batch...they loved this recipe. I added cashews instead of peanuts and they were excellent! I air popped the popcorn so I figure this is a heart healthy recipe.

Outstanding. I used butter and had better results with 250 degrees during baking. I doubled the recipe for a church picnic. Next time, I will pop all my corn first because it seemed to take too long to get enough popcorn made for all the syrup. I used Orville Redenbacher's in my microwave air popper. I did pass the popped corn over  a cooling rack to siphon off the unpopped kernals. Great idea.
Thanks for the recipe and all the comments.

Wow! I thought I had the best caramel popcorn recipe. For some reason, I wanted to try something different. This recipe tastes better and it coats every kernel. I added some sea salt for extra yummyness. This will be my new go to.

The first time I made this it wasn't great so I read alot more of the reviews and tweaked to my likes. First I use butter instead margarine.   The next thing I did was before I ever started the carmel I preheated my oven, buttered a roasting pan so when I finished the popcorn it was ready.    as soon as the corn was popped I put it in the roasting pan and into the oven to keep it war.  I then proceeded to make my carmel, once the carmel was done I pulled the popped corn out of the oven poured it over the warm popcorn in the warm pan made it so easy to handle. I put it back in the oven for 15 minutes gave it a quick stir and was amazed at how easy it was to coat all the popcorn.  Placed it back in the oven for 30 more minutes stirring every 15.  When done dumped onto wax paper let cool and then separated and placed into baggies!!!!  Was gone that night....

We loved this, I used to make caramel popcorn and give it as gifts as a teenager, this tastes just like that stuff! My boys love it! One addition, if you're in the mood for chocolate caramel corn, add about 1/2 cup of cocoa to the butter, brown sugar and corn syrup. Then, cook as normal.

Sorry. I didn't like it.  I felt there should be more caramel sauce and it got dry rather than gooey.   Going back to my old  recipe.

Really good. I used another reviewers suggestion and poured the popcorn into a paper bag  and then poured in the Carmel.  I also used toasted pecans instead of peanuts because that is what I had.  I will definitely make again.

I make a very similar recipe, no salt. I add chopped toasted almonds and whole toasted pecans. I call it Poppy . At Halloween I add the dark corn syrup  and add red skinned peanuts.  I also use a large roasting pan. when done I dump it out on to a large piece of foil to cool. Very important because if you leave it in the pan it will stick bad.

I made this Carmel corn for a party and it disappeared so fast and was easy to make. I used plain microwave popcorn (3 bags since I only did 1/2 of the recipe). Followed all the directions as is. I will definitely put this recipe in the save file and do it again.

So good I made it twice this week for Christmas treats! I used butter instead of margarine. Took a tip from a reviewer who suggested to pour the foamy caramel sauce over the popcorn set into a large paper grocery bag and stir inside the bag.  So easy and not messy!  Just toss the bag out afterwards. I used two giant disposable turkey roasting pans sprayed with butter cooking spray.  Turn it every 15 minutes for an hour and it will evenly mix for the right amount of caramel candy coating.  I used a huge bag of Nearly  Naked popcorn that comes in 22 ounces.  Use 2/3 of the bag to equal 28 cups of popcorn.  A hit with the family.

I saw this recipe while searching for treats I could make as part of  Christmas presents... saw all the raving reviews, the recipe looked easy enough and because I am busy with late nights at work, thought it was perfect to make in big batches. On a whim, I picked up all the ingredients, got out my hot air popcorn popper and got to work. Man- my studio apartment has never been filled with such a delightful aroma such as this caramel corn produced! I made the caramel sauce in a big pot and separated the popcorn into three glass bowls, poured the mixture on the popcorn and tossed. I let it cool for a few minutes (that stuff gets hotter than Hades- I tell ya what) and spread it all out on a pizza pan (Dont have a cookie sheet) lined with lightly greased aluminum foil. I baked at 245 for 30 minutes since my oven is so small and it is perfect in texture and so so yummy! Truly a melt in your mouth flavor- and I used real sweet cream butter in place of margarine! Thank you for sharing :) I can't wait for my family and friends to taste this so I can be like "Hey- I made that! " .

Perfect every time. The only time it doesn't turn out right is when I make a mistake and don't follow the recipe as written.

Make this just as it says... the only other thing I do is hit it with sea salt while it is warm after it's done in the oven!  I am allergic to nuts so the salty and sweet are a hit. This is amazing

Tried about 4 different caramel popcorn recipes, and everyone agrees this one I'd a keeper and the best. Found recipe easy to understand and do,  made with my 5.5 yr old granddaughter and had a great time, definitely saving and making this one a staple in my recipe book

I have made this recipe many times, as is and with butter. Butter is a bit better/richer. It's always delicious and I have never had a bad batch! My favorite way to dress up this recipe is to add either cashews or salted Caramel peanuts and top with either white chocolate or butterscotch drizzle. I just melt white or butterscotch morsels in a sandwich bag with a teaspoon or so of coconut oil, mix well, snip off a tiny corner and drizzle over the caramel corn. Cool completely before breaking up your caramel corn (if  it's hot in your house, you may need to refridgerate). This not only tastes delicious, but it helps the nuts stick to the clumps of caramel corn. Happy baking! :)

I loved the fact that I didn't have to use check the temperature of the syrup.  It was kind of tedious to stir every 15 minutes, but the end result is wonderful.  I think the peanuts added a lot.  I am thinking of using mixed nuts next time.  I am also bagging this up to give out at Halloween.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

The original recipe for this came out in the late 60's from Kitchen Klatter an Iowa based radio show where two sisters shared recipes during morning coffee at the kitchen table. They had a line of baking extracts that is now called X-tra-Touch.com which is the only place I know of to get the burnt sugar extract. Their recipes are legendary. Here is the original recipe that I have made for decades and it is a HUGE hit whenever it is made. The flavorings add a level of flavor you do not get otherwise. When using flavorings I always use Xtra touch or Watkins as store brands or off brands can add an "off taste." I always make it in the microwave. To make the original recipe: Put 4-6 quarts popped corn in a buttered large oven proof bowl or pan. Microwave 1 C butter, 1/2 C light corn syrup, and 2 C brown sugar until it boils and boil for 5 minutes. NOTE: all microwaves are different so check it often so you do not burn it.  Use a large bowl as it will bubble up. I usually stir after 2 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate dish, mix together 3/4 t salt, 1 t baking soda, 1 t butter flavoring, 1 t burnt sugar flavoring. Add this to the hot mixture (it will foam up) and stir well. Pour over popped corn and toss well. Bake at 250 for 1 hour, tossing every 15 minutes.

I had everything on hand except just a few peanuts in a can but we did it anyway. I got my husband to help stiring during the 15 minute intervals and this was a breeze to make and SO delicious. We will definitely do this again soon.  The only problem was it didn't last very long. I'm thinking Christmas and neighbors but I will have to bag it up fast and make it to pretty to open or we will devour it before it gets to the neighbors.

This is absolutely great! The only changes I made were butter instead of margarine,  turkey roaster instead of smaller pans, and I stirred about every 10 minutes.  This will make very nice Halloween treats.

I've been making this popcorn for many years, and give it as gift at Christmas every year.  I reduced the popcorn to 6 cups to allow for more coating. Sometimes I add pecans.

I usually make Karo's Classic Caramel Corn on this site, but decided to try this recipe this time instead. It makes more, and I decided to put all of it into my big roaster rather than having to figure out half of the sauce for 2 pans. The entire time I was trying to stir the stuff, I was thinking I had made a huge mistake. But it all turned out well in the end. I don't think this amount of sauce covers all the popcorn as well as the Classic Caramel Corn does. But it tastes fabulous, so I'm not disappointed with the final outcome. Not sure which is better. I'd have to have the two side by side. All I know is that both are very addicting!

This is excellent caramel corn. It is even better the next day and stays fresh and crunchy for days, maybe longer. Great for gifts.  The only slight change I made was to add more salt (to taste) while this was cooling because I like a little more salty-sweet taste. Love this and will make it again. My picky husband commented that this tastes just like the expensive stuff from specialty stores.

I followed this recipe to a tee. I wish I could give more than five stars. I did not know popcorn could be so good homemade. This is the first recipe I have tried and I am glad I found this one first. I have to say that it did not make enough. It was gone in 1 day. My son woke up the next morning and said mom, you know you a chef right...LOL. It put a smile on my face. I love the appreciation. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. This is definitely a favorite

No more Crunch N' Munch for this girl . . . this stuff is the bomb! I halved the recipe, and added the optional peanuts (mine were raw/salted, not dry roasted) and it is SO good! So easy to make too. Thank you!

I used leftover/refill movie popcorn!  Because of that I halved the salt.  I love the flavor of molasses so I substituted half the sugar with white and half the corn syrup with molasses.  I also used butter rather than margarine.  I had mixed nuts on hand so I threw a couple of handfuls in.  It turned out so yummy!  I wanted to take it to work Monday....I have serious doubts it will make it there!

Loved it! I used 2 bags of plain microwave popcorn  and popped it while I was making the Carmel. I also took others advise and used a roaster to cook it in the oven. Super easy and delicious to make! Took very little effort and better than store bought

Very good caramel corn. At this time of year we receive a lot of store bought flavored popcorn and this recipe is by far superior to anything we have purchased or received.  I used 3 bags of butter flavored popcorn and the proportion turned out perfectly. I used three full size baking sheets, sprayed with butter flavor cooking spray and was able to get all three bags of popcorn baked evenly at once.

Wow.  Just wow!  This is ridiculously good and addictive!  I followed the advice to use a high sided pan to mix to popcorn and sugar mixture-glad I did.  I would also coat the baking pans with a thin layer of butter to help from sticking and remember to stir every 15 minutes or you will be breaking apart pretty large chunks (I had to do that because I forgot.).  It was easy to make and the cleanup wasn't hateful - just a few minutes to soak the pans in very hot, soapy water.  This is something simple you could easily make for a homemade gift for several recipients or take along to a party for munching.  A half cup of unpopped popcorn made plenty!  Delicious!!!

made 2 batches of this tonite, ran out of corn syrup for the second batch so I substituted honey, and it came out fantastic.  I make my own popcorn, and did 1 1/4 cup of kernels for the first batch, and I think I had too much because the coating seemed sparse compared to the second batch.  I used 1 cup kernels and got pretty close to the 7 quarts, perhaps a bit shy.  I put peanuts and dried cranberries in the first batch, and cashew pieces in the second batch.  Solid recipe, loved it.

This recipe is incredible. I have used it the past two years to make treats for coworkers and family. I receive rave reviews and many requests for more! 
I use butter instead of margarine and occasionally add pecans instead of peanuts.

This was the easiest  and best caramel pop corn!!!  I hate to say this, BUT...the only thing I changed was I only popped six (6) quarts of pop corn.  I like more of the caramel to cover the pc!  Other than that, recipe was perfect!  That's just a preference I like!!  Everyone on my street got a tin can of "Amish Caramel" pop corn this year for Christmas!!  Thanks for sharing your friends recipe!!! :)

This is an amazing recipe and the best I have found through the years. Make it without peanuts or with, comes out awesome every time. I have also drizzled some melted chocolate over it and it's a party in your mouth.

This was the second batch. I added cashews and dry roasted peanuts. I watched the clock this time. It was much easier to drizzle and toss. The popcorn tasted like Cracker-Jacks!

I've made this several times, and after following the directions and using shallow pans, I switched to turkey roasting pans I bought at the dollar store.  SO much easier to coat without all of it going everywhere!  I also don't bother putting it out on waxed paper.  I just let it cool in the pans and then break it apart.  I also use butter instead of margarine.  This caramel corn is addictive; it always gets eaten quickly whenever I serve it!

So me and my brothers are watching a star-wars-a-thon and we of course wanted a snack with it, I decided to make some caramel corn, and let me tell you this is as good as anything you will get at a fair. I made it according to the directions and in the end it tasted perfect! Thanks so much for the recipe, will make again. One fair thing to note: Stir, stir, stir!

One review said it's not amazing. ..I wonder if she didn't make it correctly. It's very simple and I have to say that it is AMAZING! I make it all the time for everyone and   it goes so quickly. .addicting  addicting addicting!  It doesn't seem like it will coat  all the popcorn in the beginning but just be patient and keep turning and  coating  every ten to fifteen minutes for  about an hour and  it will be perfect. So so delicious!

The flavor was good but it didn't coat the popcorn as well as I hoped.  I'll give it another try using less popcorn.

I made it this afternoon and it is great. Better than anything store bought. I used a dutch oven to pop the corn and then poured the corn into a roasting pan. Actually I lifted the popcorn out of the dutch oven and laid it in the roasting pan to leave the unpopped kernels and small pieces behind. (I had almost no unpopped kernels as I used a med-hi heat.} Made the caramel mixture in the dutch oven and poured over the popcorn and nuts. Cooking and stirring the mixture is a must to coat evenly. Thanks for a great recipe!  Ron

Made this with my daughter, was easy and turned out perfect.  I did not use microwave popcorn as I see many do, instead I popped it in a pot with some coconut oil.  The end results were great.  Even if I did not have an air tight container it would have never had time to get stale it went so fast.

The only change I made was to lower the oven temperature to 175 so the mixture did not burn. This way you don't have to watch it a lot either. Just scrape softened carmel like topping from the bottom of pan into the corn and return to the oven.

Wow, I followed the recipe exactly, temp & time are spot on!  I did not add the peanuts and it's a winner, winner.. !!!  I used a paper grocery bag and it was so easy to mix the caramel over the popcorn.  You do lose a bit of the caramel but it's easy peasy so it was worth it.  I'll make this again for sure!

I've made this recipe 3 christmas' in a row. Every year, I make a triple recipe early in December, thinking it will be enough. Silly me, every year I have to make another triple recipe in the middle of December, to keep everyone satisfied!

Thank you! Great recipe!

Really good, tasty and easy to make caramel corn.  Pretty much exactly the same recipe as Karo's Classic Caramel Corn on the AR site (the Amish follow English recipes, too).  Butter is a must!

YUM! I used 2 disposable turkey roasting pans and filled each with popcorn using my air popper. It takes about 5 batches - 1/2 cup of kernels in each batch to fill the 2 roasting pans. Delish!

This probably would have been a great recipe without my tampering.  I added too much salt but I could still conclude that this is a good caramel corn recipe.

This recipe is a great starting point...I recommend using salted butter (never use margarine, it is unhealthy) and adding a tablespoon or two of molasses.  I added the peanuts to the caramel mixture before mixing with the popcorn.  While using a paper bag has some advantages, I think it wastes too much caramel sauce, so I used the biggest mixing bowl I have and it worked just fine.  I found that 200 degrees is not hot enough to perform the final baking steps, so I turned it up to about 225-250.

I made this 3 times.  First in the micro but it wouldn´t dissolve the sugar.  The next 2 times on the stove top.  First time it burned, the second time it was good.  I think u need a candy thermometer to get it good the first time on the stove top, this burns quite quickly once it is ready.  This is the same as micro peanut brittle which is very easy.  any leftovers, just pour on a greased surface, cool, break into chunks

My mom got this recipe from a friend a long time ago and we LOVE it.  We change a few things to make it heathier and sweeter. Instead of 2 cups sugar just do 1 1/2.  And instead of 1/2 corn syrup do 1/4 of it and maple syrup.  The maple syrup adds a darker richer taste.  Enjoy!

This is some TASTY stuff!  Its easy to make, and I acutally 1/2 the recipe.  My son's friends ask for it every time they come over, and its an easy treat that feeds a lot of kids, plus it makes the house smell nice! I also overpour my vanilla (just because I like vanilla).  Use air popped popcorn- the microwave stuff wont taste right (and it's not good for you)!

This was the first time my caramel corn turned out great!  I used salted butter microwave popcorn so I didn't add as much salt as the recipe called for but it was yummy!  My only problem as been keeping it crunchy but it won't last long enough to matter too much.

Super Duper tasty! better then any caramel corn I've had before, including Cracker Jacks! sorry CJ. It is a bit time consuming but worth the effort. I have popped my own popcorn before but tonight I just made a batch and used Trader Joe's popcorn in the bag.  Due to time constraints. It took 2 1/2 bags of popcorn. I always use butter and add a bit more peanuts then called for.  I am making this for halloween and giving out to my inlaws and nephew. This is the perfect snack to have around the house!

This caramel corn is amazing! I've made some in the past (different recipes) and the popcorn ended up soggy, but not this time. Very easy to make and a very tasty treat. Will make again and again!

This is sooo good and so very easy to make.  I mixed it in a paper bag as others suggested and it was not difficult at all to deal with all that popcorn!  I will definitely make again, probably for holiday gifts.

After printing out this recipe, I looked in my cookbook and realized it's the same recipe my mum's been using all my life (but she made it without nuts). Not only did we kids absolutely LOVE it growing up, I had schoolfriends trying to buy my bag of caramel corn off me when I brought it in my lunch! My mum apparently only used 6 quarts of popcorn, but with using bags it's probably easier just to go with the 7 (since someone said that's 2 regular bags).

Absolutely wonderful! I've made this many times now, and it's terrific. I pop my corn on the stovetop, and sometimes I only bake for 45 minutes if I want a chewier product. Be careful, it's addictive!

this is WONDERFUL! the only change I made was dropping the temp to 200. My first batch at 250 burned within the first 15 min. I also want to thank the people who suggested mixing the caramel corn in a paper grocery bag and then putting it on your baking sheet. This made a HUGE difference in how well I was able to cover the popcorn! Great recipe!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count. Like others I too prefer butter to margarine. I made this once for a sleep over for my daughter and some of her friends and they renamed it Glory Corn.

What an awesome recipe! Thanks for sharing, I love caramel corn.  I did 1/3 cup molasses 1/3 corn syrup as someone else suggested and made sauce and poured over popcorn in paperbag.

AMAZING!  Crunch, sweet, salty!  We used more popcorn  (so the coating was not so thick) and used the microwave kind so it was already salted.  Delicious!

What a delightful recipe! DH helped make this yesterday and we had fun in the kitchen. As soon as we put it on the parchment paper we dove in!! It is the best we have ever had. Was going to share with some neighbors..but we are having second thoughts. We tossed in the dry roasted nuts and they were REALLY good. Thanks for sharing with us. Everyone should give this a try.

This recipe is so simple and it's worth cooking for 1hr. My son's who are 17 & 20, with their friends, thought that this treat was awsome. I think I've impressed them with such little effort, that sure feels good. It will be one of those childhood memories that some one will say, remember when mom made that awsome caramel corn? Thank you for the recipe.

Amazing recipe!  I made this carmel corn for a housewarming party and a Superbowl party and everyone LOVED it.  It's very easy to make too.    My husband is diabetic, so I made him his own lower-sugar batch using Splenda brown sugar and it was just as good!

The best caramel corn I've ever made. perfect combo of chewy and crunchy. I used butter, and cooked it at 200 deg for 45min, stirring every 15 min. I used less popcorn, because we like ours heavily coated (1 c unpopped kernels). It all fit in our large roasting pan.

Delicious recipe.  I made it a second time with 1.5 times the caramel mixture for extra caramel on the popcorn, but I think either way was just as good.  Will definitely make this again!

I absolutely loved making (and eating) this snack. I had a difficult time trying to figure out how many cups of unpopped popcorn I would need, but figured it out in the end. I used butter, but will try margarine next time to taste this difference. Parchment paper instead of wax paper worked very well. I used a very large roasting pan to cook these and the tall sides worked perfectly!

This is amazing!! I made batch after batch for  Christmas presents and everyone raved. I used peanuts for the first batch and I forgot them for the next batch and I liked it much better without, which really surprised me. But it really allowed the   flavor of the caramel  to come out. My oven cooks a little high so I used 325 degrees. I made two half cup batches of popcorn kernals for the perfect amount of popcorn for 1 batch. Beware-- its hard to stop eating this!!

By using puffed corn (don't have to deal with the old maids or the hulls), it works out beautifully and is just as delicious.

This was a very good recipe. Like other reviewers suggested, make sure you have all of your ingredients on hand BEFORE you start making the carmel. I buttered and salted my popcorn prior to adding the carmel mixture. I also put the popcorn on top of the nuts. I found that if I followed the directions and put the nuts on top of the popcorn, then the nuts got all of the yummy carmel and not the popcorn. Make sure to eat this quickly because it will go stale in a few days. If it does go stale, microwave it for about 20-30 seconds and eat immediately. Thank you for sharing!

This is FANTASTIC! No one believes it is homemade. I thought the large amount this recipe made would be more than enough but I was wrong!  I popped my own plain corn and used real unsalted butter. After it cooled all spread out on the counter I drizzled dark chocolate over it. YUM!

SO GOOD!  I cut the margarine to 3/4 cup (because I didn't have the whole 1 cup) and it still turned out wonderful!  I hope to keep this recipe as a Christmas tradition.

Fantastic! I'm a lazy baker and I was intimidated by the time involved, among other things. It was much easier than I thought. Not sure if I had 7 quarts of popcorn, but I had enough to cover the bottom of a jelly roll pan and the bottom of a Pyrex 9x13 pan. I basically halved the caramel sauce recipe because I didn't think I had enough popcorn. We like a little less coating. Excellent recipe! And fun to give.

This is very yummy! I made it in my huge roasting pan, buttering the sides first. The clean up is easy and the results are no less than addictive! YUMMY! I make this every year at Christmas time for holiday gifts.

I must have done something wrong!  My "caramel", after baking on the popcorn is somewhat grainy and it didn't coat the popcorn as I anticipated.  I either cooked it too long in the pan or I messed up when I added the vanilla and baking soda to it (I added the vanilla and stirred, then the baking soda and stirred).  Still tastes great though!  Will definitely try it again soon.

This was perfect!  It was so easy to make too!  I used butter instead of margarine because that is what I had on hand, and it worked just fine.  My toddler and husband won't stop eating it!  Truly delicious :)

I am giving this a 5 star rating even tho I should have used different popcorn. Taste is outstanding...I set temp at 250....next batch I will definitely lower the heat. I used pecans and it is yummy. I used orville plain micro popcorn...way way too many husks...so will by regular popcorn and do it on the stove, and I know that will be much better. The micro corn tends to break up in bitty pieces...sooo I will have happy birds and squirrels tomorrow morning! A+ rating for taste and ease! I used 2 roasters, finally transferred all to one and stirred for frequently! Awesome snack and gift...thank you!

LOVE this!!! Made my own popcorn on the stovetop. Reduced the recipe to 10 servings. Baked in an aluminum pan coated with cooking spray, used a rubber spatula to stir. Much easier than I thought it was going to be. Came out perfectly, but might add the peanuts next time. Yum!

This is every bit as good as everyone says it is!! Beware though you won't be able to stop eating it! Easy to make but next time I might leave out the peanuts or only put in a few, just a taste preference.

This is just like a recipe I had lost which we would make 20 years ago!  Thanks for sharing!  Made three batches in the air popper and doubled the caramel sauce.  250 degrees and 1 hour is perfect!

Not a fun one to make.  Next time I will use the advice of my fellow members and try the paper sack trick.  Honestly, I don't know if there will be a next time.  The flavor was good, but, no matter how long I let it cool, it remained sticky.

I made this caramel corn for the first time several years ago and it is fantastic!  It was very easy to make- even if you've never made anything like this before.    I found popping my own popcorn on the stove to be the easiest (and cheapest way) to get plain popcorn for the caramel corn.  I make sure none of the kernels go into the caramel corn.  This year I hope to find empty popcorn tins to store large amounts of the caramel corn in.

Yum. Still warm out of the oven! The more it cools, the crunchier it gets. I used butter, it is what I had. Next time I will try margarine, see what difference it makes. To be able to give it five stars, it has to be the best I have ever had. It doesn't beat our downtown candy store's caramel corn. It is excellent though. I will rerate it with the margarine, maybe that is what it is.

I'm eating this popcorn as I type and it is DELICIOUS!  I did have to substitute honey for the corn syrup (we don't keep corn syrup in the house), but it was still great.

I have made this recipe twice now, and it is amazing!!  The first time, I made the recipe exactly as listed, but I wanted more caramel, so the second time, I used four quarts of popcorn (about two air popped batches), and the recipe is perfect!

This is fabulous. I didn't change a thing. I like the idea of using a Turkey roasting pan, as another reviewer suggested, because it does make a mess when you try to stir it.

Five Stars....Made this popcorn last night, can't stop eating it! Butter definitely makes this great. I also used other reviewers tips and set my oven temp to 200.  Very easy clean up, used a buttered dutch oven.   The best popcorn recipe ever. No need for speciality or gourmet popcorn anymore, I can create it in my own kitchen.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The caramel didn't cover all of the popcorn. It needs some pizzaz.

Having grown up in Western New York, I know the Amish have very good food. (Anyone ever had an Amish donut? Yum.) So I was immediately drawn to this recipe. I've made caramel corn before, but never baked it, so the caramel corn would clump together and be chewy. Which is good in its own way. But I wanted a crunchier version this time, so I thought I'd try this one. It was great! I used a glass cake pan, pretzels instead of peanuts because I didn't have any peanuts, and microwave popcorn.  I had to leave out the vanilla, because we had run out. I love vanilla in stuff, so I'm glad it turned out great without it. And I personally, cut the amount of salt in half. I don't use it in a lot of my cooking. I would totally recommend this caramel corn, and I think I'll be making it for Christmas!

This receipe was really easy and the popcorn is delicious!!  I was nervous when I first poured the caramel mixture over the popcorn because alot was not coated.  I followed the recipe and by the time I mixed in it during backing I was relieved.  It was really fun to do.  I am going to make another batch tonight for my nephews with out the peanuts (food allergy).  Thanks so much. LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I found it hard to get all of the popcorn coated evenly, not to mention the mess that was left on the pans. Next time I will definitely line my pans with parchment paper. The taste was delicious despite the spotting coating.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  It is so easy and turns out perfectly every time.  I found this recipe about 3 years ago when my husband said he felt like caramel corn for a movie. I stay far away from corn syrup, but I keep a bottle on hand now, hidden, just for this.  I had a hard time getting enough to last to give away for Christmas.  It is a keeper!  No changes (except I leave out peanuts when it is for my DH and kids since DD is allergic).

So yummy and easy!!!  The only thing I changed was using butter instead of margarine.  I used my deepest roasting pan, which made the stirring a lot less messy. This is the perfect goodie to send with Christmas presents!  Thank you for sharing!

Very, very good. Just let the brown sugar mixture come to a boil over medium heat - it will take some time.

I used the brown bag method and it worked well with my hubby shaking the bag as I poured in the mixture.

I only gave the recipe four stars because it's the first caramel corn I've ever tried to make. However it is FANTASTIC and deserves all the accolades already posted. My husband and son ate so much of this last night I am making more to give to our friends for the holidays. I advise using the paper bag method as it makes cleanup very easy. YUM!

Fabulous.  I made for a Holiday treat for my neighbors and got rave reviews.  Easy and yummy.  I may add M & M's next time after the corn has cooled.

Easy and tastes great.  I used the paper bag method suggested by another reviewer to mix the carmel and popcorn.  I also kept the oven at 200 degrees as recommended by other reviewers.

This recipe was very tasty. My family ate all the popcorn in one day! The only thing I would recommend is putting the popcorn in a bag, pouring the carmel coating in, and then shaking it. This makes the carmel spread evenly over the popcorn. Some of the other users had recommended this as well.

OMG!!  This stuff is awesome!!  And was honestly easy to make.  My boyfriend - who doesn't get in the kitchen much even helped with the last batch.  Used the butter as many suggested, but other than that no changes.  I'm now making 3 more batches to send to the troop we adopted in Afghanistan earlier this year.  They are going to love it!!

I made this last night to add to my Christmas gift tins.  I used real butter, but kept the other ingredients the same and it turned out fabulous.  I used roasting pans and it was super easy to mix and clean up. My oven only goes down to 260 degrees, but it came out perfectly crunchy and delicious!  I will be making this every year!

Oh my, this is wondeful, and my first successful attempt at making caramel corn.  I was making it to take to work tomorrow, but will need to make another batch, as my husband and I can't stay out of it.  Great, and easy, recipe!!

I made a batch of this the other day following the recipe exactly, it was my very first time EVER making caramel corn. Not only was it very easy (and affordable,) it is honestly some of the best tasting caramel corn I've ever had. I'll be using this recipe again and very soon.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this since my family loves caramel corn. I followed the directions exactly and it came out way too soggy and chewy. I cannot imagine what went wrong. Maybe this recipe just isn't for me. Sorry

The best caramel corn. I used honey butter that I had on hand instead of margarine. It was delicious. My family and friends couldn't get enough of it.

YUMMY!  This recipes makes a generous portion of caramel corn.  I popped two cups of regular popcorn in a combination of equal amounts of olive and canola oil (approximate 1/4 cup each).  Then proceeded with the rest of the recipe as usual.  Our family of 6 is still eating on it three days later.  I plan on making it to give out in small fall bags at our church's party, The Reformation Festival.

I made this for my son's birthday to share with his classmates.  I left out the peanuts for potential allergy issue. It was easy to make and seperately packaged in goodie bags. It was enjoyed.

OK, I have to tell ya.  I enjoy cooking when I'm motivated and have the time.  Rarely do I ever dabble with deserts and/or snacks.  But this my friends!  No more traveling to the beach to get the caramel corn.  No more store bought, sometimes stale, sometimes not pot luck caramel corn!  I vote for new diet consisting of this alone!

Really, this stuff is great and easy!!

I've beenusing this recipe for several years.  It's always a hit.  I just tell my friends that my Amish friend stopped by and they all know I've made caramel corn.  I follow the recipe mostly as written, but I use real butter instead of margarine.

Very delicious!  Easy to make. I used air popcorn in two batches and the carmel was just enough to cover the corn. Very hard not to eat it all at once! A+++++++++

Very very good. We made it in honor of Popcorn Day today.  We kept some and took some to my husband's workplace for them to share.  I used canola oil to prepare my popcorn for the caramel corn and I won't do that again.  I could taste it.  Maybe corn oil next time?  That's not part of the recipe, just a tip on the preparation of the popcorn.

Made several batches to give as holiday gifts...however, between the kids, the husband, the dog and all the people that pass through here sampling it at their leisure, I didn't get to give out nearly as much of it as I would've liked! Many people commented "this is the best caramel corn I've ever had".  Very yummy!

I loved the texture of this recipe -- nicely crunchy like popcorn should be -- but I think it had a noticeable butter flavor even though the popcorn was plain.  Next time I'll decrease the butter a little.  Very good though!

this recipe was FANTASTIC!!  my dad buys the caramel popcorn from the stores which are probably loaded with preservatives.  i tried this recipe to ensure he's getting the goodstuff and the very first time he tried it, he said: "I LOVE IT!".  i did burn one batch just slightly, but it was still really tasty!!  EXCELLENT STUFF!  thanks for sharing!

So easy.  I didn't even measure any of the ingredients and it came out great.  This should be made in a roasting pan, or a lasagne/casserole pan if you don't have a roasting pan- much easier to stir.  I made it using 4 bags of microwave popcorn- 2 with butter, 2 were "Light Kettle Corn".  You could use just about any kind of popcorn.  Be careful of the unpopped seeds though- those are hard on your teeth.

Absolutely addictive and delicious. Nobody who tried it could control themselves...that's adults and children too!
Going to make another batch this weekend. 
The recipe's just fine as it is...not complicated or difficult.
Many thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I made this and couldn't stop my mom (or myself...:)) from opening the oven to grab a few pieces while cooking.  The only thing I had a problem with was getting the corn evenly coated - I think I'll use the paper bag method next time.  I also want to try this dipped in dark chocolate.  Yum!

I can't believe how yummy this stuff is!  I took one reviewers advice and used the paper grocery bag to mix corn and caramel together and it worked PERFECTLY!  It was a big hit at the party that I made it for!

Delicious. Served this at a monthly card club night and received rave reviews. I used yellow kernels in my air popper; used 3/4 cup butter instead of margarine; and omitted the peanuts.

Awesome recipe!  We bagged this up for all the teachers and support staff at school.  We mixed a double batch in a paper bag and baked at 200 degrees. Thanks for a perfect recipe.

Delicious! I cut the amount of butter in half and it still tasted great. Just like the caramel corn I have been buying at the mall. I cut the recipe in half since there's only 2 of us in the house. It still made a lot.

I 100% agree with the suggestion to boil the carmel for longer (I went 10 mins) to ensure that the sugar carmelizes, stirring everything in a paper bag first to coat (stirring every 15 mins on a jelly roll pan is a nightmare, skip that!) and then 45 mins in the oven at 200 degrees... with those modifications, this popcorn was AWESOME.  Easy, GREAT tasting, and it looked beautiful too.

ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!! After the first bite out of the first batch, I realized I didn't make enough-batch 2 is in the oven now!  I have never had much luck with popping my own popcorn in the pan, so I ended up using 4 full size bags of extra butter microwave popcorn...if you are a fan of super extra buttery caramel then this is the way to go!  I don't think it was quite 7 quarts, because the caramel coat was pretty heavy, but thats the only way to have it!  I think next time I'll try 1/4 cup corn syrup and 1/4 cup molasses.  This will definitely be a year round favorite.  Thanks AnitaLouise!

The caramel corn was great.. I wasn't able to coat all of the popcorn, though.  So, some of it was just plain.

I made this with one bag of microwave popcorn (ends up being about 3 quarts). I thought it was ok (I don't have much of a sweet tooth anyway) but Husband enjoyed it. It was a little stickier than I thought it would be.
