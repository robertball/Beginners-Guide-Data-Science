I made this recipe for a cookie swap and it was a big hit. I will be making this one many more times. Someone said that the dough was "watery", if the chocolate is too hot, allow the dough to cool off a little bit before putting on the cookie sheet so that it firms up a little.

super easy, sweet, fudgy, and chewy.  Don't leave the last batch on the pan to cool, they'll stick!  It's easiest to take them off the sheet while they're still soft.

I halved the recipe, which shouldn't have mattered, but the results were disastrous.  The cookies were watery, crunchy (not in a good way), and generally awful.

These were good right out of the oven. The second day that got very hard and too crisp. They are def a same day cookie, but they are excellent. Very easy to make and little clean up.

Wowsers, these are great!  You know how you read some recipes and they say you'll get a fudgy cookie out of them but you don't.  Well, you do with these babies!  One guy at work even classified these as the "best cookies he's ever had in his life!"

I've been searching for an eggless recipe that would appease my taste for brownies and these cookies hit the spot! Lovely bits of chewy chocolate goodness.
Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful recipe.  Nuggets had a chewy bottom and center.  I doubled the recipe and split the dough into thirds.  By the way, this dough is VERY easy to work with.  Then I made some nuggets plain, another group I mixed caramel swirl chips into, and yet another group I mixed mark chocolate chunks.  Sinfully delicious.  It's a winner in our home.

We really like these, and I didn't even have chocolate chips! As a substitute I used 1 cup + 2 TBSP cocoa powder, 3/4 cup + 2 TBSP sugar and 1/4 cup + 2 TBSP vegetable shortening.  Since I had nothing to melt, I just mixed the butter, sugar, shortening and sweetened condensed milk together, then added everything else. The batter was pretty thick and hard to mix after adding the flour, but they were still super quick and easy! Great recipe! I think I like these better than brownies!

After reading all reviews the only change I made was to add the sweetened condensed milk after I melted the chips, butter and sugar together in the microwave.  Dough was a stiff consistency and the baked result was crispy on the outside, moist and chewey on the inside. This recipe is a family hit!

In an effort to use up ingredients before I move, I made this recipe. I had to use margarine instead of butter, and I substituted orange extract for the vanilla and white chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and pecans for the walnuts. I used the microwave to combine the ingredients rather than the stove. Once the batter is made, let it sit for a few minutes as it really sets up. Also, it's better for them to be slightly undercooked rather than overcooked at all (plus I think this oven I'm using has a higher temperature than it's supposed to). The orange extract was a nice decision, and I'd recommend it. The cookies were chewy, and soon became quite hard. I'm not sure how often I would make them.

I made them with 3 1/2  cups milk chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cup butter, 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, no nuts and only 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and dropped balls of the dough about 1 1/2 inches around on parchment paper on a cookie sheet so they were about 1 1/2 inches apart and there were twelve cookies to a batch then baked them for ten minutes. They made 34 cookies and came out perfect. I think only using one can of condensed milk made them not as sweet as if I'd used 2. They were really good

This is awesome and super easy.  After the first batch I figured out that I didn't need to grease the pan since I use parchment paper.  I also didn't bother to get another bowl dirty, I mixed everyting up in the saucepan and they turned out great.

The best chocolate cookies I've ever made and tasted! They were a hit! My friends and family loved them and we have all agreed that they taste like brownies. They were so soft and chewy. Simple AND delicious. Simply delicious.

Not bad, but not great.  The dough spread a lot, and it did harden up a bit as it sat waiting for the next patch.  As someone said, they do not look nice, I added white chocolate chips to some and decorated the tops of some with sliced almonds.  Very chocolatey, which is nice..but I am not raving about them.

These are baking right now. they seem to have an odd texture, more like fudge than cookies. Hopefully they turn out good. I put almonds and sprinkles on top.

Very fudgy tasting.  If you LOVE dark chocolate, then you will love these.  Too much for my taste buds.

A-Mazing. Chewy, gooey chocolate bombshells that will obliterate the fiercest craving. Be sure to grease your pan well.

My kids really liked these.  They were good, but not something I would take to impress.  I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  VERY chocolatey..

Chocolatey and chewy, very good. The bottoms of the cookies were done much faster than the tops, could just be my oven. I will make this again.
