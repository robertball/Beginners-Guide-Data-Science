This is a very good recipe my grandmother used to make a variation of this.  Instead of using boneless chicken breast, which tend to dry out easily, I use a whole chicken cut into pieces, I cut the vinegar with about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup water, add about 1tbs of crushed red pepper flakes and put in a slow cooker to cook all day while I am at work.  All that's left to do when you get home is make some rice and whatever veggies you might like.  Talk about something good.

OhmiGAWD.  This recipe was a complete shock (a positive one!).  After reading the reviews, I didn't expect this to turn out so well, but the taste of the sauce...wow, mindblowing.  I LOVED this dish, and I will definitely be making this again and again.  The sauce is fantastic over potatoes.

The apple cider vinegar tangyness was overwhelming at times.  I tried this recipe because I didn't want to have to make a trip to the grocery store, but after trying it I wished I had.

Good recipe. I did NOT find it too tangy at all - the vinegar ends up blending with all of the juice/liquid let off by the chicken. Could use a little perking up - next time I will add crushed garlic, maybe seasoning salt/celery salt, pepper, paprika.

Overdid the garlic a bit, because I misread the recipe to be for 4 half breasts.  Also overdid the vinegar.  As I was making it, I realized that the housemate really dislikes vinegar, so I cut the tang with a drizzle of honey on each breast.  Despite being overly generous with the ingredients, the hubby loved it; the vinegar hating housemate will eat it if I make it again, which is actually high praise for something made with vinegar.

I'd pay closer attention to amounts next time; definitely step back on the garlic, which I had doubled for 7 half breasts.  It did create a lovely, tender chicken, and the honey did take some of the sharpness out if you have someone in your house not overly fond of vinegar.

I didn't have garlic salt so I used some celery salt and garlic powder.  I also added some red pepper flakes because we like spicy food and added a bit of water to cut down on the tang of the vinegar.  Overall, I think it's a great recipe for chicken...not your everyday flavor!

For the ease and speed of preparation, I gave this 4 stars.  I'd say the taste is more tangy than puckery (similar to salt and vinegar potato chips tanginess).  I used legs and thighs so I cooked it about 45-50 minutes and it was still very moist.  I also like the low calorie count but I agree the meal is a bit bland and lacking in color if you don't beef up the side dishes.  We had sauteed spinach and portobello mushrooms, cranberry sauce, and steamed white rice (I also drizzled some of the juice from the chicken on my rice).  My three kiddies and hubby liked too, so I'll be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the quickest, easiest chicken recipe I've ever made, and with so few ingredients I'm always sure to have on hand. The chicken came out very moist and tender.  My husband couldn't guess what was in it, but said it was "very tasty".

I used my crockpot & used garlic powder instead of salt. Felt it needed a 'kick' to it so I added 1 Good Seasons Italian seasoning packet (dry) plus 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The sauce was delicious when mixed with the chicken's broth!!!  I then poured the broth into a saucepan and thickened it to make a nice gravy.  Served over mashed potatoes...everyone LOVED IT!

Surprisingly good. I love the flavor combination of vinegar and garlic so this was perfect. I added some hot pepper flakes for an extra punch and served it with egg noodles. Great for a quick weeknight meal.

I made this as the recipe directed excepted that I halved the recipe to feed 3.  We loved it - the chicken was moist (amazingly so for boneless & skinless breasts) and tasty and not too strong of a vinegar flavor.  My husband is not a fan of chicken breasts & he loved it.  Will make again and again.

This was really good and I didn't feel the vinegar was overpowering at all.  I did make some changes based on my BFF who uses a very similar recipe.  I seasoned my meat with all-purpose seasoning, topped with red pepper flakes, and added some water.  Additionally, at the end, I browned the meat under the broiler then removed the meat from the pan.  I placed the pan on top of the stove, brought to a boil, added 1/3 c brown sugar and thickened the sauce with Wondra gravy mix.  Outstanding and even better the next day for lunch!  I only gave 4 stars based on my additions (even though the recipe as written is a good base recipe) and the cooking time written.  Thirty-five minutes at 350 degrees wasn't nearly enough time.

I am a big fan of vinegar, but I have to admit that this really didn't sound very good when I read the recipe. However, because it looked very easy (and it was), I gave it a shot. The final product confirmed my suspicion. (I wish tht I had seen the suggestion to use the chicken in a sandwich or salad--with some other flavors, this wouldn't be a waste.)

I really am shocked by the sheer number of glowing reviews for this. 

Never again for me.

I love that this recipe is quick, easy, inexpensive, AND very good!  I changed the recipe for just two people and was worried about how much garlic salt it said to use.  Surprisingly, it worked out really good and did not over power the dish.  I did take some advice from other reviews and added a little water to the dish and it came out perfect.  Thank you!  This dish is perfect for those days where you don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.

I have a twist on this receipe that is so good! Instead of apple cider vinegar, I use a really good balsamic vinegar and thoroughly brush both sides of skinless, boneless chicken breasts with it, and leave some in the bottom of the backing dish.  I place thme in a shallow glass pan and sprinkle both sides with fresh ground seasalt/garlic (available in the spice aisle).  Then I put a HEAVY layer of brown sugar over the entire top, and turn the breasts over, once during cooking. The combination of flavors is incredible.

Delicious.  Instead of garlic salt, I sprinkled each breast lightly with seasoned salt, then crushed a large clove of garlic on each piece before pouring the vinegar over all.  Tender, juicy and flavorful, without any overpowering aspects.  Chicken was rather thick, so took a little longer to bake.  Great dinner.

This is a keeper although I did do some adding to the recipe. I used boneless thighs. Since other reviewers said it was blah looking I seasoned first and then gave the chicken a quick browning in a skillet before baking. I also used granulated garlic, some white pepper, and a smig of sea salt. I also cooked at a lower temperature for a longer time. About half way through I also drizzled with honey.  Very good! "Da hubs" ate it and ask for more. Two stars for taste after changes, two for ease.

Love it... I made a few adjustments. I added 1/2 cup of water, 1 tsp. of seasoned salt and 2 tbsp of butter. I also put my oven at 250 degree's and cooked it 2 hrs. The chicken was moist and fell apart. Will use this recipe many times over! My family loved it :)

This was...unique.  It's kind of a funky flavor, not bad, but probably not something that I would make very often.  There's a very vinegar tang to the chicken, and I think it would mellow out nicely with an apple salad or something else that would take out a little of the acidity.
*I found out the next day that these are really good for chicken sandwiches; a little mayo, a little toast, and I actually enjoyed it more than I did fresh from the oven.*

I did not care for this recipe. The only thing good about this recipe is that the chicken stayed moist.  .My 8yrold, who eats practically anything, would not eat it!

I'm gonna give this recipe 5 stars, mostly because of it's simplicity, how few ingredients there are, and how fabulously tender the chicken comes out. I was only making 1 serving, so I just put my chicken in a small dish, sprinkled it with garlic, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper (as suggested by other reviewers), then covered it with 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar mixed with 1/2 cup water and a little bit of honey (again, suggested by other reviewers). I'm not usually a huge fan of vinegar, but I thought this came out wonderfully! Ate it over roasted cauliflower, asparagus and yam.

I like that this is a really easy recipe as well as delicious.  I use a mixture of garlic salt and garlic powder to taste, because I don't like salt that much.  This would probably be good with some crusty bread.

Easy, easy, easy.  Even if vinegar is not your favorite, give it a try.  Or like others suggested cut the "tang" with a bit of honey or less vinegar and add a bit of water....  Comfort food at it's best.

Very good!  I took the advice of several reviews, and added worchestershire and soy sauce. I also added red pepper flakes and cut the vinegar with water.I plan to try this on the grill.

This recipe sounded strange, but it sure was good, and ridiculously easy.  I didn't like the thought of baking raw chicken (would have looked too pale!), so I seasoned and browned it first in a little oil in an oven-safe skillet, then added the garlic and vinegar.  Cooked to perfection in 35 minutes!  Thanks!

Super Quick & Easy dish.  I didn't have cider vinegar so I used Rice Vinegar instead and sprinkled some parsley on top.  Served it with steamed white rice and steamed veggies.  A very light but flavourful meal that even my kids enjoyed.  Will try making it with cider vinegar and compare which tastes better.

Very good, but could use something else to add to the flavor.  Maybe balsamic like another reviewer suggested?

I had to reduce the servings to 2 and it still turned out great.   I would baste once in awhile if using boneless chicken breasts.  Thanks for this healthy recipe.

I tried this last night and decided it was not a stand alone recipe.  I was going to serve the breasts with a couple of side veggies, but it was not good enough to eat like this.  Instead I used the chicken for fajitas and it was really good.  The chicken was so very tender and tasted great.  I will use this recipe for anything that calls for cooked chicken...I bet it will be perfect for chicken salad!!

The recipe was alright the first time I made it. After reading other reviews I chose to use both the apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar. I made to recipe again and chose to use apple cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar. I found the flavor to be better, the chicken more tender, and the color of the chicken to be more appealing.

Easy to make and you don't need to make a special trip to the store for obscure ingredients.

I was a little concerned about the 'pucker level' after reading some of the other reviews.  My husband is NOT a fan of sour food (sauerkraut in particular).  This chicken had a tasty tang, not quite as 'puckery' as I was expecting.  The husband liked it very much; I ended up spooning the extra juice over the chicken and my mashed potatoes for some extra zing.

I used chicken breast tenders when making this, and the flavor was really strong. I'm sure if I was to use a regular chicken breast the taste would not be so strong and I would really enjoy it.

VERY surprising recipe...I decided to try this against my wife's protest that it was going to be dry, or vinegary and it was NEITHER. I used bone in chicken breats (7) and this recipe was delicious enough for me to make monthly. My finicky children also said to give this a 5 start rating- and that's something!

I have used this recipe for years, without so much garlic salt, and grill the chicken pieces. I would use margarine and vinegar to baste the chicken pieces. This was an old recipe from a friend's mother, and it always make delicious, moist chicken. Try it on the grill!

Chicken came out good!  Thanks to a liberal drizzling of honey over to top of the chicken breasts because I wasn't gutsy enough to try this as written... and I'm usually a vinegar lover!  The vinegar and garlic combination smelled heavenly as I was putting it into the oven, but there wasn't any taste any of that flavor left after it was done cooking... and the vinegar left sort of a metallic aftertaste that I didn't appreciate.   I used 1/2 red wine and 1/2 cider vinegar.  I won't be trying this again I don't think, chicken breasts are pretty hard to mess up and there are lots of better recipes out there just as easy.

I halved the recipe to accommodate 3 chicken breasts, and it was just way to vinegary and lacking just that pizzaz (for lack of better word). 
 
I followed other reviewer's advice and added crushed red chili flakes, garlic salt, and some seasoning salt. But with these changes, it just wasn't yummy.

 Will definitely NOT make again--how disappointing. I'll stick to just lemon pepper/salt/pepper on my chicken! :)

I found this recipe to be EXTREMELY easy and quick to prepare. A new go to.  The flavors were excellent and the chicken can be eaten stand alone or in many different ways once baked. Like other reviewers I added garlic and paprika but I then dredged the chicken in flour, salt and pepper.  Next time I make this recipe, I plan to marinate the chicken in the cider, paprika, fresh minced garlic, salt and pepper, then will dredge the chicken in flour, pour the cider mixture over the chicken and then bake.  I also found the drippings to taste excellent, however, thought that it might be better if reduced.

This recipe is amazing.  It produces moist, tender, and flavorful chicken every time.  I bake some almost every week just to have some on hand.

I absolutely loved this dish! The chicken breasts we used were frozen and re-thawed and the chicken STILL was so moist all the way through. I didn't think the vinegar was at all overpowering.. Can't wait to make this again with potatoes in the vinegar as well.

If you like salt and vinegar potato chips, you'll like this chicken.  It reminds me of a dish my grandmother prepared that I have never been able to replicate.  She used pork and sauerkraut.  As suggested by another reviewer, I cut the vinegar with 1/4 cup water and I used a whole roaster, cut up.  I think fat enhances the flavor of the juice, and a whole, skin-on chicken provides that.  I would definitely like to try this in the Crockpot, using sauerkraut plus 3/4 cup vinegar & 1/4 cup white wine, some crushed red pepper, and a whole cut up chicken.  This is delicious.  It is warming and homey.

Little on the dry side, but the flavor was awesome.  Looked nothing like the picture.  Wondering how they got that nice blackened look.  My son loved it mixed with Yellow Rice and Broccoli

Very easy and very tender.  I thought the vinegar would be too strong of a flavor because the odor was very strong out of the oven.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the vinegar flavor was nowhere to be found.

Decided to take the advice of other raters and use basalmic vinegar. The chicken was ok, but was bland.  We ate it, but will not cook it again.

I cut the vinegar down to 2/3 cup, and added water from a jar of peppers.  I also drizzled honey over the top prior to baking.  It turned out pretty good.  I'd make this one again, but I'll add more honey and cut the vinegar down to 1/2 cup next time, and maybe add the peppers themselves to it, too.

I gave it three stars because it is ridiculously simple to make.   The taste was a little, well, odd, but in a good way.  Not terribly vinegary.   I had to add some parsley to the chicken, not for taste, just for color, and I recommend serving with brightly colored sides.  I may make this again, but it still needs something.

I'm sorry, I love vinegar and experimenting with cooking, but this just didn't work for me. This is rare but I couldn't even finish it. The chicken was unappetizingly pale looking, and tasted strongly of vinegar even after I cut down on it a bit. To me, it had a weird metalic aftertaste. My boyfriend said it was ok but he didn't want to keep my leftovers for later use, so I definitely won't be making this again.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this dish!  It sounded very odd, but I thought I'd give it a try because I had the ingredients around even when the cupboards were practically empty!  My husband and I loved the tangy flavor and the meat turned out so moist.  I used 3/4 cider vinegar and 1/4 red wine vinegar. Except for the fat from the chicken itself this is virtually fat-free... the pan doesn't even need greasing.  And consider this:  If you want to make something quick and easy for your family, this is healthier and took half the time as mac and cheese from the box!  I will definitely be making this again.

I used boneless breast tenders and used an oven bag to bake the chicken. I was very pleased with the flavor. It was a nice change from the typical chicken dishes I've made. Easy, flavorful, and healthy.

So delicious.  Can't believe something this healthy tastes so good.  I bake mine for an hour though, 30 mins on each side. One thing I also like to do is chop the chicken up for salad and use the extra cider vinegar that's in the pan as a dressing.

I thought this was super easy to make and very good! I really like tangy food, so I thought the flavor was excellent. I used large chicken breasts when I made this, so that might explain why the vinegar was not overwhelming for me like it was for others. I will certainly be making this again.

I made this recipe last night. I used 6 bone in thighs with the skin since that is what I had on hand. We loved this recipe! All of us in the household love salt and vinegar potato chips and this is very similar. I basted the chicken with the sauce as it was baking and cooked it for about 45 minutes. I also thinly sliced potatoes that I spread on the bottom of my baking dish and put the chicken on top. Definitely will be making this again!

It was interesting. The chicken was very tender. So tender you could cut it with a fork.   It's probably not something my southern bred husband will enjoy.  For me it was ok, I put more garlic on it and added some bbq sauce. It was better after the add'l ingredients, but to each their own.

Really enjoyed the tangyness of the apple cider vinegar, and the chicken came out really juicy.  I sliced 4 breasts in half lenghtwise so I had 6 thin pieces and a lot of sauce leftover.  Added a packet of Italian dressing mix/seasoning, garlic powder, and paprika.  Baked @ 375 for 35 min and they were perfect.

This is fantastic. Hubby is critical of different chicken recipes and this met all his expectations. Mine too. This is so easy to make and the reviews from family were spectacular. I didn't change a thing. I did thicken the pan drippings and used it as a gravy over mashed potatoes. This is a keeper and I will be making this again and again and, well, you get the picture. Thanks for sharing your recipe. :-)

If you like salt & vinegar chips, you'll love this.  The amounts listed were just right for a nice taste.  The vinegar blends with the juices from the chicken, so it doesn't taste as strong as the vinegar smells.  Apple Cider vinegar is very healthy for you! The garlic salt I used was a grinder from Trader Joes, so the little pieces of garlic on top of the chicken browned nicely.  Put the garlic salt on last so the liquid doesn't wipe it off the top of the chicken.

This was just ok for me. The chicken had a sour taste to it which made my son pause for a moment, but fortunately it wasn't too strong that he kept going. I put chopped onions on the top which were delish! The chicken was very moist and tender which was nice. I probably won't make this again but if I did, I might consider using a different type of vinegar and reducing the quantity.

Add onion and slices apple. Cook for an hour. Flip and stir. Top with brown sugar. That's cuts the vinegar "bite". Chicken is falling off the bone delicious golden brown.

At first we were concerned that the cider vinegar was going to be overwhelming with the chicken (and we all love vinegar, but there's such a thing as too much!) After reading other reviews and hearing that it was bland, I opted to use chopped garlic instead of garlic salt, minced onion, and some red pepper. It came out amazing! Not overpowering at all, moist and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it. Will be repeating this one!

I just made this dish tonight! it was very tasty. But I agree, next time to add some of my own seasonings to add a little more flavor. Over all it was good though! Glad I tried it. fyi, I don't really consider myself a great cook, so if I can do it, anyone can!

We did not like this at all. The chicken turned out really dry with no flavor. If I were to ever make this again I would dip the chicken into the vinegar first then put seasoning on it.

I could barely get my husband to eat half a piece. The vinegar taste was way too strong, even after I added a few TBSps of honey.  There must be some real vinegar lovers out there to give this recipe such high marks.  I won't be making it again.

WARNING...this will smell up the whole house but it is TOTALLY worth it! Awesome flavor! It was not overpowering, as I feared it may have been, based on the smell. It had a such a nice bite to it.

We really don't like this. I have made it twice, and even followed the instructions from the REBAJEWEL photo, and still a no. The smell if the vinegar was too much, maybe an acquired smell?
Thanks anyway.

I don't understand the rave over this 'great' recipe...i tried it exactly as written and it turned out with no colour and in fact a total waste of perfectly good chicken breasts.  I had to use my reserve gravy to make the chicken taste like anything.

Wow the taste of vinegar is really overpowering. It does make the chicken tender, but I couldnt get past the taste. My husband used it for chicken taco and said he didnt notice anything different about the taste, but I could!

Yes, I too was worried about using so much apple cider vinegar here. I made the recipe exactly as written, except that even by increasing the cooking time to 45 minutes, some of the chicken was still slightly underdone inside - maybe it's my oven? And even then the chicken wasn't the desired "browned", not even slightly. Still, the taste was pretty interesting, surprisingly so. But visually it's pretty boring, and needs good side dishes to complement it. All in all, this was just okay, and I probably won't be making it again.

This was very tasty!! Surprisingly so. I followed the recipe and just added a handful of dried red pepper flakes, and some canned, minced garlic. The cider vinegar was real strong at first coming from the oven, but, not for long. Try it, you'll probably like it. Next time I make this I will add some honey to it.

i did not like this at all. it wasn't because of the vinegar but because of an overall blandness. my husband salvaged his piece with lots of extra garlic salt. i won't be making this again. it might be better on other parts of the chicken but the breasts were just too bland.

There should be a zero star choice. This was a waste of chicken. Thankfully not a waste of time- it WAS quick and easy.

I liked this recipe! It was quick and easy! The chicken was tender and it gave it a tangy taste, it was really good I will make it again!

Loved this- made dinner for myself and my roommate.  We liked it so much I made a second batch for leftovers. I added red pepper flakes to the mix. Also, I did not follow the proportions in the recipe- I just poured in the vinegar and salt (and pepper flakes) liberaly.***update*****I just made this again ( a few days later) and just wanted to say again how much I LOVE it.

Very moist and delicious!  My husband asked me to make it again and even our two toddlers ate it happily.

Didn't think it was that great. Neither did my husband. Although the chicken was moist, it provided no flavor.

Other than this being good for a quick, easy meal to prepare, I wasn't impressed. Sorry.
