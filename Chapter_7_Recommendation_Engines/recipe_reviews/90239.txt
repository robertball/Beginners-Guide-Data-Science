This recipe was excellent.  I teach a basic nutrition education program designed for limited resource families, and I was looking for a good, easy and inexpensive hoppin john recipe for New Year's.  Several groups have done this recipe, both as written and with additions of Chorizo sausage, Old Bay Seasoning, and leftover honey baked ham.  Even people who do not eat black-eyed peas rave about this recipe.  For those with problems with black-eyed peas, any other bean would work well.  It's a great recipe as is, or as a base for a very creative cook.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

We liked this hearty soup.  I added celery, green pepper and onion to the sausage as it browned. Only added one can of tomatoes and used 3 C chicken broth with 1 C water.  Added all ingredients except rice and simmered for about an hour (reduced it some too).  Added rice and simmered on heat for 10 minutes.  Removed from heat and let sit until rice was done but not mushy.

Too bad the ratings only to 5!! I'm not from the South and I've never had this soup before. It's a welcome change and easy to prepare. I pretty much followed the recipe, but added two stalks of celery,diced and one medium onion, chopped, and cooked them in with the saugage as a reviewed suggested. I used a 16 oz frozen pkg of black eyed peas, thawed, because we like fresh or frozen veggies much better than canned. I gave the peas about a 20 minute head start in the broth and water. I also added about a cup of thinly diced cooked ham, per a reviewer. Served with made-from-scratch cornbread. Yum!! This goes into the rotation file, for sure!!

Like others, I don’t care for plain old black-eyed peas for New Years. I wanted to make this recipe exactly. I had most of the ingredients. One of my cans of peas was “with snaps” but I figured a few pieces of green beans wouldn’t hurt anything. I got the exact Sage sausage. I couldn’t find the 6-ounce, uncooked, with seasoning packet, long grain and wild rice. My store only had Rice-a-Roni called “long grain and wild” and it was a 4.3 ounce box. I love Rice-a-Roni but it isn’t all rice. The Roni part is Vermicelli. I got Uncle Ben’s, already cooked, long grain and wild rice in an 8.8-ounce package and I left out the 2 cups of water. Since I had varied, anyway, from the recipe, I threw in some onions that I pre-cooked in the microwave. A must in any soup worth eating! I didn’t need it to be that quick. I simmered in my Crock Pot on High for a few hours. My hoppin’ John soup was very tasty and I’d make it again. It’s mild though. If you want spicy, a little garlic powder and hot sauce would blend well, or use a spicier sausage. Good recipe that doesn’t require exactness.

EXCELLENT.  SO.... much flavor.  I  added sauteed chopped celery, peppers, onions, roasted garlic, sage and cayenne.  I substituted pork sausage for smoked turkey sausage.  And also I did one can of mild rotel tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 cans of the same.
I'll definitely make this one againg

As written, I'd rate this a 4.  But, I added some andouille sausage instead of the sage pork sausage, and omited the tomatoes and 1 cup of water (we wanted it a little less soupy.)  A little cajun seasoning,  and we thought this was a 5* for sure.  Thanks for helping us start the New Year right!

I cut this recipe in half and it still fed 5 people for dinner - with leftovers for 2 the next day! I let it boil down to a very thick stew. Very Enjoyable!

This soup is sooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for I decided to add some cayenne pepper to add some heat.  My husband said " oh honey this recipe is a keeper".  It is so simple to make & yet tastes to much more complicated.  Great recipe!!

This soup is excellent!  I made one change and omitted the tomatoes.  The black eyed peas I used came seasoned and were very good in this soup.  It will become a family favorite! Thank you for sharing!

2 years after first trying this recipie, I'm updating my review, but keeping the 5 star rating!  This has become a staple recipie at our house - almost every week in cold or cool weather.  It is SO easy to tweek & very forgiving : I've forgotten the water, used only water because no broth on hand, added & substituted link sausage, ham, barley, seasonings, various veggies, etc., doubled & tripled it & it ALWAYS turns out DELICIOUS!  We often make this after work-done in 30 min. or less, or on days off I let it cook low & slow & it gets almost stew like.  It's also a frequent request for work pot lucks (between this & 'clone of a cinnabon' also from AllRecipies-which, btw makes a nice companion/dessert with the Hoppin' John).  If you have any left over it re-heats nicely as well(I have to make a double batch to have left overs)  If friends know I'm making this, they've been known to invite themselves over for dinner, too!.  I still can't thank you enough for this recipie!

This soup is excellent! It was quick to prepare and would be easy to do after work for a warm dinner on a cold night. My husband declared it a success and asked to have it again. I think it would be good with chopped smoked sausage, too. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have sage sausage. Our FFA kids sell Blue and Gold Sausage, and that's what I had on hand. Goood job, Nephi. I'll watch for your name on recipes again.

I have made this recipe for the last two New Years and its fantastic.  I even made it for my family up North this year and they actually loved it.  I love to pair it with a great corn bread recipe.  I like to leave it sit a bit so the rice soaks up a little of the liquid so its real hearty, and I like to add a half a bag of frozen okra, very yummy. Great recipe thanks for sharing.

GREAT soup!!  I don't like black eyed peas but I loved this!  I used Spicy Italian Sausage because my husband and I love the flavor of it.  I did what others suggested and added an onion, celery and bell pepper.  I also added 2 cloves garlic and used fresh grape tomatoes instead of canned and frozen black eyed peas instead of canned.  I used brown basmati rice without seasoning and all chicken broth instead of half water.  I know I changed this recipe up quite a bit but I still gave it 5 stars because it is a great base recipe that can be changed up according to your tastes.  I will definitely be making this often!

This was so easy to make, and the result was absolutely delicious. I will be making this every New Year's Day! I even froze some of the leftovers, and they reheated pretty well. I recommend pairing with some good cornbread!

First time making anything like this - was HUGE hit with even my picky-est eater.  DId keep the rice separate as did not want it to get mushy - will do that in the future as well.  Very filling and tastes even better the next day!

Quick prep, easy to make, few ingredients, and it tastes great. Even Mr. Picky had seconds.

I made no modifications.

I made this recipe to celebrate New Year's day.  I can use the luck! It was great.  I used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage.  I cooked it with a chopped onion, green pepper, and celery.  I drained and rinsed the fat.  I was trying to keep the sodium low, but tasty.  I used Zatarain's brown and wild rice mix, a 32 oz. box of low sodium chicken broth, 2 cans of Glory brand seasoned low sodium black eyed peas (drained).  My tomatoes were organic and lower in sodium.  I used 1 1/2 cups of water due to the additional chicken broth. The seasoned black eyed peas really made a difference, I think.  They had really good flavor and a nice smoky smell.  I didn't use additional salt, but did add some cayenne pepper and a dash of creole seasoning. This really was good.  I can see how it could be varied using different meats, beans, and rice mixes.  I will definitely make it again.

I'm sitting with a bowl of this in my lap - couldn't wait to review it. I made this "as-is," then tossed some spinach and kale in at the end so I could have a one-dish New Year's dinner (hoppin' john for luck, greens for money).  I'll definitely make this again, and will probably use some of the suggested additions (celery, carrots, onion, garlic, etc).

This received rave reviews when I served it this New Years!  I always have black eyed peas for good luck, but I've always hated them.  Thank you for offering this delicious alternative.  (I pureed the diced tomatoes but only because I have a friend who won't eat cooked tomatoes.  Still great!)

I always like to have black-eyed peas on New Year's.  This is a family tradition in the south.  My husband isn't very fond of plain black-eyed peas, so I try to find interesting recipes using them.  This soup really hit the spot and my husband liked it very much.  This will be a keeper. I used the sausage with extra sage which gave it a little spicy tang.  Very good.

I made this on New Years Day and it was delicious!  I used regular italian sausage, sliced and fried in a pan.  I added carrots, celery and onion to the pan to soak up the yummy flavor.  The only other chnage I made was to use one can of black beans and frozen black eyed peas.  The whole family really enjoyed it!  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is fantastic!  Very easy to prepare.  I had a difficult time finding the black-eyed peas in a can.  I looked at three stores and was about to buy a bag of dried black-eyed peas (finally the last store at least had them that way) when I remembered a reviewer said they bought them frozen.  The store did have them frozen (thank you Joe G. because I would not have even thought to look in the frozen foods).   I prepared them the way the bag said, drained them, and then added them to my soup.  I also took the advice of viewers and added onion and celery to the sausage while it was cooking, about ½ cup each.  My sausage was just regular sausage so I just added sage to it while it cooked.  I used Uncle Ben’s long grain and wild rice mix and did not think the end result needed any added salt.  My whole family liked this soup.  We had never had black-eyed peas before, but we all liked them.  I think this soup would also be great with spinach or kale dropped in the last few minutes of cooking and will probably try it that way the next time I make it – and there will definitely be a next time.

Delicious! I added celery, onion, garlic and bell pepper per other reviews. I used 1 can of tomatoes and increased the broth-DH not a big tomato fan. Made it New Years Eve to have on New Years Day- easy and good. Thanks for posting!

My family loved this, and they "don't eat black-eyed peas!"  Changes:  Halved recipe due to having onlyone can of peas...Pre-cooked, crumbled turkey sausage was on hand for the sausage, and I also had some pre-made Minute Rice brown rice.  My can of tomatoes had onion and green pepper in it I think.  In any case, love it!

I'm sure this is fantastic as written! I didn't have a wild rice mix, so I added about 1 1/2 c. white rice and seasoned with some creole seasoning, a bay leaf, cayenne and black pepper. I also added diced onion when I was cooking the sausage. Before adding the rice, I let it simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes to reduce the liquid and let the flavor intensify a bit. The final result wasn't really a soup, but more of a casserole consistency. I served with hot cornbread. It was perfect for our New Years Day meal!!

I made a double batch of this for New Year's Eve/ New Year's Day 2009 and now I am thinking I should have tripled the batch! My family of four loved it. Even my non-green eating husband enjoyed it and my picky eating 13 y.o. daughter had 3 consecutive servings.  The only changes I made were: I used Polish style sausage link quartered and browned (I did NOT double this due to fat), added a green pepper, and garlic salt.  Served with Glory Foods brand Southern Style Seasoned Collard Greens-- and this combo was freakin' awesome!  Seasoned individual servings with hot sauce and/or diced jalepenos.  We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. Also, in preparing my double batch, I inadvertently used 28 ounces of diced tomatoes rather than 56 ounces but they were never missed (and I love lots of tomatoes). Very aromatic & flavor- popping when combined with the Glory greens.

This is the best!  I was looking for something different than the same old blackeyed peas and rice.  This recipe fit the bill.  I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes as this is what was in the cupboard then omitted the water and salt.  Also did not add any additional seasonings.  The end result had a stew consistency that set off the Southern Collards (from allrecipes) and pan-fried cornbread.  This one is a keeper!

Loved this last year and have been looking forward to making up a big pot for New Years!  This combines all the things that I love.  I think it has some wiggle room to change per taste.  Overall a great recipe and perfect for a cold day.

Wonderful, quick soup!  I used sliced smoked sausage instead of the sage pork sausage (don't like sage), and only one can of diced tomatoes.  I also added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, to make more of a stew like texture.  Excellent flavor, quick and easy to assemble - this recipe will be one of my regulars!  Thanks for sharing!

To "cajunize" it a little, I added celery, onion and bell pepper. It was good, but greatly benefited from having a serving of cornbread in the bottom of the bowl. Flavors improved on day two.

Good base recipe. We used 1 can of Pinto Beans and 1 can of Black eyed peas, because it was what we had. 2 bags of frozen rice from another entree and added Chicken Jalapeno Sausage from Trader Joe's. Delicious! Made enough for a 2nd day.

On a 1/5 scale Hubby gave this a 10.5 stars. He loved it more than anything else I've cooked in a very long time. I took this to a church supper and this was the only dish that came home empty! My alterations included doubling the sausage, and adding 6 inches andouille sausage. I also added an extra pkg of wild rice I had on hand. While browning the sausage, I added two celery ribs, and chopped green onion. With this many canned veggies, I went low sodium - the broth, tomatos and beans were all lowest sodium I could find - and the broth was still VERY tasty.  Cornbread on side.  This goes into the rotation file, for sure!

Literally used what I had on hand.  Three qtr. lb. of "Hot" sausage and diced up 4 smokey breakfast links. Zatarain's yellow rice mix and frozen black-eyed peas went into the pot.  Used mostly chicken broth but the soup was still too thick so kept started adding V-8 Spicy Hot till the consistence I desired....Yummy !

this was absolutely fantastic!! really filling and flavorful! 

I, like many other reviewers, opted for spicy italian sausage and also added both onions and celery to the mix, which really added a lot of taste and body to the soup. The spicy sausage with this recipe is just a perfect pairing; I'd highly suggest it!

And also, Uncle Ben's has a quick long-grain & wild rice that comes in a box w/ seasoning and it's really inexpensive...I noticed people saying they couldn't find this rice with the seasoning, but I'm just telling you all- it's out there!!

Overall this recipe was great.  I did make several different changes due to family tastes.  I included fresh smoked kielbasi, and used different beans instead of the black eyes peas.  Also, used some different and additional spicing.  My family really enjoyed it.  I will definately make it again.  Oh, almost forgot I also added whole kernel corn with red peppers.

Not typically a fan of black eyed peas but will eat them on New Year's Day. Loved this, however, and will likely make it again during the year! Made it pretty much the way it is stated, except I used diced tomatoes with green peppers and chilies for a little extra kick. My husband and two year old loved it, too! Served it with some spicy southwest cornbread!

I left out the 2 c water to make it thicker.  Added leftover ham, sauteed onions and peppers, some cajun seasoning.  it was so delicious and thick like a stew rather than a soup and I served it with cornbread.  Yummy!!  Will definitely make this again!!

I made this today for New Years.  Used all the ingredients as listed. I did however take others suggestion and put onion and green pepper in with the sausage.  As it was cooking, i would taste test and found it to be a bit bland. I ended up adding ground pepper and then Franks Hot Sauce.  If I do make it again I will add seasoned tomatoes.  You can really be creative with this recipe, but as it stand on it own, didn't have enough flavor for me.

I thought this was yummy, but my husband didn't like it. I used Rotelle tomatoes for the diced tomatoes, and added some onion, green pepper, and celery when browning the sausage, but kept everything else the same. I thought it was hearty, and the flavors were excellent. It was even better the next day!

Delicious and so easy!  Will be making this again.  I doubled the recipe, and only had one package of wild rice, so I also used a package of Zatarain's dirty rice as well.  Worked great.

i liked it but my family liked it more than me. I almost made it a rissotto consistency ...pretty darn good, filling, and easy to make. Couldnt find sage sausage so I just added my own sage..probably more since I love it. Interesting taste..very yummy

I was wondering what I was going to do with the can of black eyed peas that I had in the cupboard and came across this recipe. Since I only had one can I also used one can of Kidney Beans. I decided to use about 3/4 lb of Kielbasa which I had in the frezzer and I needed to use it up, I also added some chopped lunchmeat ham I had in fridge, some bacon which I had cooked this morning,and at the very end I was preparing some Lasasgna and added some of the seasoned ground meat that I was using for the lasagna. I didn't use the seasoned rice I used jasmine (FAMILY FAV) and added two packages of sazon and 1 package of ham seasoning. I used one can of rotel tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos. I added some sofrito and black pepper, garlic powder, and I also sauted onions and celery with the kielbasa and ham, I used chicken broth and a little water only to thin it out a bit. I made cornbread to go with it... and served some freshly grated mozzarella on top.... This was so yummy and everyone enjoyed it! My husband had 3 bowls!!! My son and his friend gobbled it up too!  This is a great recipe which can be adapted to almost any beans etc.  Thanx for the great recipe!!

My Grandmother who is 85 years old just told me about this old recipe that her dad use to fix her when she was a little girl. I searched and found it here!  I made it for her last week and everyone just thought it was the greatest!  I am fixing another pot tonight! I added a bit of crushed red pepper for a little zing!! Thanks for sharing with me.

I really like Hoppin' John so tried this soup on my family and served Mexican cornbread with it and they all loved it! Even the teenagers!  So several different ones wanted the recipe.  We liked it so much I will probably make it again New Year's day for our annual meal of black eye peas, cabbage, pork jowl and ribs.  It was super easy and I went exactly by the recipe; the only thing it needs is a good shake of hot sauce.  Absolutely delicious!

We all loved this one!  Very tasty!  I added some frozen peas for color and a can of condensed tomatoe and rice soup to give it a little more body.  Also used low sodium chicken broth and I did not add any additional salt.  And it was still very tasty!

I doubled the recipe and it made a ton of soup (froze some).  Soup was fast to throw together and tasty - even better  reheated.  I served the soup with hard rolls and butter.

I made this recipe for our church's Old Fashioned Christmas in large quantity....It was a definite favorite!  made it  as directed a day before, so had to add broth as the rice soaked up the original broth (but I planned on that happening so no big deal to me ).  Flavors were wonderful and people couldn't get enough!

EXCELLENT! This soup has so much flavor! I added another pound of sausage, hominy, and another can of chicken broth just to make it more of what my family likes to eat. Besides that... I am definitely saving this recipe! Thanks for letting the new year start off with a bang!

I made this the other day even though I don't really like black peas my husband loves them. And after reading reviews from other people that don't care for them I thought maybe this would be something we could both enjoy. I was right we both liked it I even sent it to my sister-in-law in Tx. It is quick,easy and tasty. The only change was to use smoked turkey sausage instead of the sage pork sausage. I will make it again and I think I'll add diced carrots just because I like them.

Yummy! I followed directions, but only used one can of blackeyed peas and a large can of stewed tomatoes. I didn't have any sausage...so boiled some chicken (used wings since that's all I had)...kept that chicken water to add the can of chicken broth to..then cooled chicken and took it off the bone. Cooked everything else as directed and added chicken at end. Wish I had been more prepared 'cause corn bread with it as many reviewers did, sounds perfect!

Just saw this and decided this would be a fast fix.  I did not care for the tomatoes with the chicken broth.  It was okay, but would not say it was good.  Both my boyfriend and I had the same opinion.

Just OK. Really not enough flavor. Did not have black eyed pea beans and used white beans instead. Also added onions and garlic to the sausage when sauteing and added 2 packs of wild rice mix because it seemed very watery. Would try adding celery, more onions, and stock instead of broth if I made this again. Maybe after it lays awhile it will taste better.

Loved this and I usually hate black-eyed peas.  We used Smoked Turkey Sausage and added some sage rather than using the pork.  Will definitely make after New Years.

I made exactly as written- really good and so easy. I made for New Years's (legumes and pork are considered good luck for the New Year). Will make again and again. Served with cornbread made from Marie Callender's "restaurant style" mix (excellent). Thanks for sending this!

Very good base recipe! Used a few reviewers suggestions. Made with Turkey kielbasa sliced and cut into quarters, sliced deli ham cut up, 1 can each black-eyed peas and pinto beans, 1 can each diced tomatoes and diced tomatoes with chilies. Sauteed 1/2 a medium chopped onion with sausage in EVOO and pat butter until tender. Hubby thought it was a bit spicy, but still went back for a second bowl! Will try to make with a bit less spice next time. Great served with Grandma's Best cornbread from this site.

Added chopped and sauted celery and onion; can of RoTel instead of one can of tomatoes; used chicken broth instead of water; used regular breakfast sausage; and used canned pinto beans (didn't have black-eyed peas). It was really good and filling. Better the next day.

Great Soup! I made this recipe for New Years Day. I'm from the south and my family's tradition is to eat black eyed peas for luck in the New Year. Even my skeptic guests loved this soup! Followed the recipe exact. I did use the garlic and onion flavored diced tomatoes.

Used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes - a bit spicy but my husband insists he wants it made the same way next time.
He generally does not like soups, - but this was an exception.

It's that time of the year down here and this recipe is on my stove to be ready for Tuesday. Match it with the Kickin' Collard Greens SUBMITTED BY: Ken Adams in AllRecipes and some cornbread and NO ONE will know you're not from down here (until you say 'Thank You').

4.5 stars. Great winter soup & one-pot meal. I tweaked it by first sauteing half an onion and half a bell pepper, then using a package of spicy chicken sausage. The diced tomatoes I used had garlic/onion. Also, instead of rice I used Trader Joe's spelt flavored with bell peppers (cooks like rice but nuttier with more protein), and instead of black-eyed peas I used chickpeas. I also had to add some water intermittently to keep it soupy. Thanks for this easy & tasty recipe!

delicious and hearty! i will definitely make this over and over again.  this family does not eat black eyed peas nor do we celebrate the new year but we loved it.  i used the sage sausage and added eckrich smoked sausage as well, and a can of spinach. only used 1 can of black eyed peas instead of 2 and added 1 extra 14 oz can of tomato sauce and 1 can of water (to offset the saltiness that the smoked sausage gave to the soup).

THIS WAS GREAT!  I added some Emeril's Essence and used smoked sausage rather than sage dressing.  I ate on it all week and shared with a co-worker.  It was great and will do again!

This was very tasty, with several modifications. I didn't have sage flavored sausage, so I used my usual breakfast sausage, and added a tsp. of sage to the recipe. Also, I prefer a thicker stew type soup, so I left out the water, altogether. Will definitely make this again.

This was really good, although I did make a few changes. I started by chopping one onion, 4 strips of bacon, 8oz of ham, 8oz smoked sausage in my food processor. Fried that up with about 1 1/2lb. ground beef. Drained fat, rinsed with hot water. I used 2 cans rotel and a can of diced tomatoes. Tossed in about a cup of shredded carrot and a stalk of celery, chopped, a 16oz bag frozen black-eyed peas, and doubled the rice(I had Uncle Ben's Spanish rice on hand). 
My 9yr old made up some cornbread muffins. We had a scrumptious supper!! Everyone at the table raved and had seconds!

Per some suggestions I used frozen peas not canned (just have to cook longer). I also added onions and garlic and celery to the step where the meat gets browned. I also added collard greens (for money) and we had this as a New Years lucky soup!  It was great.  Even my very picky husband who swears he doesn’t like Blackeyes peas LOVED it. It’s a keeper for sure

I found this recipe a few years ago & despite this being a family favorite, I'm just now getting around to rating it.  (sorry)  I've given it 4 1/2 stars as-is & and extra 1/2 star for its flexibility& how we make it now.  My husband calls it '2-can Hoppin John' because it's "2 cans or boxes of everything".  While we really liked it as written (plus the extra box of rice because I read it wrong the first time & we liked the extra rice), I wanted a little bit ...more...and it IS quick, but many nights we need something ready & waiting for us when we get home, so here's what we've changed: I now add a diced onion & some minced garlic to the sausage while browning, then use a slotted spoon to transfer into a large crockpot.  Add a link of Andouille sausage, sliced, then all the listed ingredients.  I also add-in 2 drained cans of sliced mushrooms, 2 cans of diced chilies or a few diced fresh peppers like jalapeno or serrano (or use about 29 oz of Ro-tel), & either some drained canned or bite-sized fresh greens such as collard, mustard, turnip, kale, &/or spinach (I eyeball it & use any left over greens for other meals).  Set it on low & in 4 hours it's ready, but we've had it go as long as 10 hours & it's still tasty, just a bit mushier.  Also tastes great the next day whether as written or with my changes.

I love this soup as it, but this time I made a lot of modifications. I call it Asia's Everything Soup! I serve this with cornbread muffins and freeze half of it for a few months down the road! It is better a few days later!

 This is my recipe:
1 pack of Italian Turkey sausage ( Plubix brand)- take out of casing
1 box of Delia’s chicken sausage
1 onion
4 Celery stalks
1 Table spoon of minced garlic
1 pack of frozen spinach (unthaw water)
1 can of Mexican or Fiesta Corn
1 can of Amy's Organic Chunky Tomato Bisque-low sodium
2 cups of water
1 can of string beans (Glory brand 1 pound)
2 (6 ounce) package uncooked long grain and wild rice mix, with seasoning packet
UNCLE BEN’S® READY RICE® Long Grain & Wild
2 (15 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
3 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid
4 (28 ounce) chicken broth- Low sodium
2 cups water
 
Warm skillet to medium , add  about  3 tablespoons of olive oil,chopped onion , celery, and Chicken sausage, allow to cook to thaw and 
scramble add turkey sausage a scramble mixture in skillet over medium heat and cook until evenly brown.

Note: I added a some  onion power, garlic powder, season salt, Mc Cormicks celery seed,  Mc Cormicks celery flakes,  Tony Chachere's® Creole Seasoning , and ground black pepper.  I made sure to cook the sausage a bit longer than usual so it will not be too mushy ( like turkey can be)  in the soup.

In a large pot, mix the cooked sausage, rice mix with seasoning packet, black-eyed peas, a

We usually double soup recipes and put the other part in the freezer to defrost when we don't feel like cooking.  This didn't stay in our freezer over a week it was so good!  We added cumin and more basic spices such as salt and pepper than called for in the recipe.

We love this soup.  The ease of preparation, common ingredients that are usually in the pantry and the large amount if makes for leftovers tomorrow make it a favorite.  I add a medium diced onion to the sausage as it browns and Frank's Red Hot pepper sauce to taste before serving.

I made this for my husband and best friends on New Year's Day 2016. I added a diced onion -- browned it with the sausage. Also added 1 can of tomato sauce and 1/2 tsp. dried red pepper. It was delicious and a big hit with everyone. It is super easy to make and tastes like you spent all day working on it. And now we will all have good luck all year long because we had black-eyed peas on new Year's!

Excellent Recipe! My modifications were mainly just my individual preference to use dry peas and my personal seasonings of choice. 
I used Italian brats sausage. Casings removed, crumbled & browned in lg soup pot. Drain grease.
 Add 1/2 purple onion chopped
Add 1 1/2 c dry black eye peas. Cover with water 4+ cups
1 lg can diced tomatoes with juice
2 stalks celery, chopped
Emeril pork spice, Red Devil, Sea salt, crushed red pepper
Bring to low boil for 1 1/2 hrs
Add 1 1/2 c white & or wild long grain rice. Cook 30-60min longer adding more water as needed/desired for soup vs stew
Top with grated sharp smoked cheese of choice and salt to taste.  ENJOY!

This is delicious! Only things I did differently was to use reduced fat sausage & less of it (just to save some fat & calories) and since time wasn't an issue, I used dried black-eyed peas.  Be sure to use chicken broth--really enhances the flavor.  It's great to have such an easy, delicious recipe that uses ingredients one might typically have on hand.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe as it's written. I made it again and added a chopped onion, chopped celery, and 5 chopped garlic cloves to the sage sausage as it was cooking along with some additional sage and crushed red pepper. This was absolutely delicious and very easy to make.

Love this recipe! Actually my whole family does, including my picky 4 year old. I like to add onion (sautéed) and fresh kale (which cooks down). It has great flavor!

This recipe is a keeper.  I was looking for an easy but tasty Hoppin John to make for New Years.  This definitely fits the bill.  I only cook for me so I halved the recipe.  I had read the reviews so I added some onion which I diced and sautéed with the sausage.  I only had three little plain breakfast sausages so I added some bacon. I also used Rotel and added some fresh thyme which I happened to have on hand.

A great, quick meal to use what I had on hand. I sauteed an onion with the sausage. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. Then came a diced carrot, a clove of garlic and a can of white beans. Celery would be nice too. Delicious!

Really easy and yummy dish. More importantly, you this recipe holds up to changes if you don't have the exact ingredients in the kitchen. I didn't have Chicken stock so I dissolved three bouillon cubes in water. I didn't have pork sausage so I use Italian Turkey sausage. The dish was still really good.

I gave this a 5 even tho I didn't care for it. I made it 1 New Years thinking it might make the bep's taste better. I just don't like bep's. But I was really impressed with the taste of the broth. I took the advice of another and sauted onion and celery in with the pork sausage. And added extra sage. Soooo I decided to try it with great northern beans. I added 3 cans drained and rinsed. And boy is that yummy. Can't get enough of it.  I also added some kale to it.  It is a great recipe either way. If you like bep's.  lol

I've never had Hoppin' John Soup, but was more than happy to share some of this (since it makes a bunch) with some neighbors who are equally lame. We all loved it. I made some changes, but it doesn't matter what those were, because the basis of the original recipe is strong enough to let us play with it. Don't be afraid to use what you've got on hand. We'll do this again and again - thanks for the recipe!

Good & simple.  I found myself longing for a bit more flavor.  Maybe the sausage I bought didn't have enough seasoning??

Had to modify to fit ingred's on hand.  We used spicy sausage and then tossed in some sage.  Also added red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne (we like spicy!).  Added diced onion and celery, used 2 cans mild rotel and used water w/chicken boullion in place of one of the cans of chicken broth.  Never had Hoppin John before so not sure what's "authentic", but we liked the tomatoes in it and this turned out great and it was done quick! Score!!

This is the best Hoppin' John that I have ever had.  We liked it well enough to incorporate it into our rotation of winter menus.  It is easy to prepare, and we really enjoyed it.

Very tasty and really makes a big pot! I used 2 cans of Glory brand low sodium blacked-eyed peas, 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes, threw in slices of smoked turkey sausage and a large can of Glory brand collard greens. Didn't add the extra liquid because I cooked the rice separate, and had corn bread on the side. Excellent base to start and can do so much with this recipe! Thanks ThoHug!

I doubled this recipe, except for the wild rice mix - and it was great. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would not double the rice mix in a double-recipe. The flavor of the seasoning packets would be too overbearing. I used Uncle Ben's and 1 box totally changed the flavor of the whole dish. Wasn't too sure I liked the flavor combination, but got rave reviews from others. None the less, this is a hearty soup, and worth taking the time to write a review. Thanks for sharing!!

We did a vegetarian version for some of our New Years guests. It turned out great and we just added a smoked tofurkey sausage to the side for them and smoked kielbasa for us. Served also with a side of cornbread and sautéed kale, topped with green onions, hot sauce, and sour cream. It really made for an easy, affordable, colorful, flavorful, and satisfying meal. The beans and rice mixture did just fine without the addition of the meat, all measurements kept the same as listed. Will make again!

Used Zatarain's Wild Brown Rice Mix & Jimmy Dean's sage sausage.  Coupled it with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread by Bethany Weathersby off this site too and this meal couldn't be easier or tastier for my husband and four kids ages 4-11 on New Year's.  Thanks!

This soup was easy and really delicious.  I used a 32 oz box of low sodium chicken broth,  1 1/2 cups water to account for 4 oz more chicken broth, low sodium tomatoes, and a 4 1/2 oz wild/long grain rice mix with seasoning.  The sausage and rice mix had enough sodium, that using everything else low sodium was perfect for our family tastes.  Also, the 4 1/2 oz rice mix was plenty for the soup.  There was not a lot of excess broth.  I will definitely make it again!  Thank you.

Tried this a few weeks ago and what a nice surprise. This soup is delicious and filling. It makes a great winter meal. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it requires no modification, yum. If you would like a little more heat, add some cayenne. Other than that, perfect.

This is SO good!  I added one large carrot(sliced), 1 cup chopped green bell pepper and about 1.5 cups shredded green cabbage, just for extra veggies. I had mild sausage without sage so I added 1.5 tsp. of thyme in place of the sage.  Served with cornbread.  FABULOUS!

So delicious and such a hearty meal. I added dried minced onion while cooking the sausage. I threw in some chopped carrots along with the rice, used diced tomatoes with green chiles for a bit of heat, and added garlic powder, two chicken bouillon cubes and salt & pepper to taste. My ten-year-old had two big bowls and said she loved it! I will save this recipe and make again and again.

This was so easy and so good.  I made some changes though.  I used one medium onion, chopped.  Instead of using 4 cans of black-eyed beans, I used 1 can of red beans, 1 can of Pink and 1 can of black-eyed beans.

This was really delicious!  The only change I made was to use 2 boxes of long grain/ wild rice mix, because the brand I used (Farmhouse) was only 4 ounces. It ended up thick and hearty, and very tasty.

Excellent soup!!!!! I used turkey sausage (mild, b/c the store was out of hot - so I added hot pepper flakes) and browned that with celery, onion and garlic. Subbed Rotel for one can of tomatoes. Spiced it up with a bay leaf and a bit of Emeril's "essence." My daughter (a professed soup-hater) LOVED it and even my son (hates beans) ate about half a bowl. I would have kept eating and eating it if I hadn't gotten full! I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you!!!

This was awesome! I added more of the chicken broth than what was called for, as the rice tends to absorb most of the liquid. 
I also tossed in a "few" flakes of crushed red pepper to give it some kick. Loved it, and was even better the next day, although it was more the consistency of a stew vs soup. Still very yummmy!

Just made this tonight with the left over Black-eyed Peas from New Years ... 
IT IS AMAZING!! EASY and DELICIOUS!!
I did use one can of Rotel Tomatoes to give it a tiny kick.
And I had made a whole pound of peas - so I used two boxes of Wild Rice. Anyone should adjust your proportions accordingly. And yes, as others have said - you can add just about anything you want to this.
I've never made this dish - always heard of it - I WILL BE MAKING THIS RECIPE AGAIN!!

So good. Couldn't use spice packet from rice because of gluten intolerance so added garlic powder, onion, thyme, parsley, bay leaf and Emeril's Essence. Also, leftover ham instead of pork sausage. Fabulous 30 minute meal.

This soup is really terrific. I have been making it for New Years for sevveral years. Use diced tomatoes with jalapenos for an extra kick, andoiulle sausage, onions, green pepper, and celery. I also add a dash or two of cajun / creole season ing. I haven't added garlin and I don't know why but I certainly will next time.

My husband loves black-eyed peas, so I tried this recipe out today for him.  He loved it!  Just used a hot sausage and added celery, onions and garlic.  Nice way to warm up on such a cold day.

I made a vegan version without the sausage. It was quick, easy and satisfying. It will be a good base for other additions and substitutions, so I will definitely make it again.

Nice and tasty for the amount of effort involved.  I used some homemade wild hog sage sausage, and used 1 can of hot rotel tomatoes and peppers instead of 2 cans of tomatoes.  Good wintertime meal.  Really wish I had made some cornbread......

I almost gave it 5 stars for how good this is compared to how easy it is to make, however, the overall taste doesn't rank up there with the best soups ever.  It is still good and worth making.  Update: I made this again for 2011 New Years and changed it bit which made it better.  I sauted onions with the sausage and finely chopped celery. Served topped with shredded cheddar.

This was a good way to clean out my fridge. I didn't have black-eyed peas, so I subbed chic peas and used 2 packs of the Rice-o-Roni Wild Rice & Wt Rice. There was no "roni" in these packages, as stated by another reviewer (which surprised me actually). Anywho--great taste and so easy!

Very good and very easy.  I used frozen black eyed peas.  Next time I'll probably make it in the slow cooker. This will become a standard in our house.

Made this for New Year's Day this year and it was very good (and easy).  I cut the recipe in half and it still made 5 bowls.  Because I like things spicy, I added cayenne pepper and hot sauce.

This is delicious!  I made it today for our New Year's Day meal, but this would be great any time of the year, especially on a cold, winter evening. It's easy to prepare and would be a nice meal to bring to a potluck or party (would be easy to double or triple the quantiy).  I found the long grain and wild rice mix (Near East brand) in Whole Foods Market.

I thought this was excellent, and I hate black eyed peas. I made this for my boyfriend for New Year's because its his tradition, and I really liked it myself. It was very easy and quick to make, and it had a great flavor. I did change one thing, and that was to use 1 can of regular petite diced tomatoes and 1 can of green pepper, onion, and diced tomato mix. The broth of the soup was so tasty! Overall a very good recipe!

it was tasty but better after i added some cumin, garlic powder, peppers and onions. I omitted the water and just cooked the rice in the broth for a richer flavor.

This recipe is so delicious and so easy, I have to give it 5 stars.  I make a batch on Sunday and bring it for lunch all week.  The sausage really gives it a lot of flavor.

Very good! Next time I may use pasta instead of rice, but turned out good overall.

Very tasty! I used cut up kielbasa (because that's what I had) and added some sage; I think I tossed in some seasoned salt as well. My kids aren't big on soup, but they were able to sort of pick and choose what went in their bowls. My husband made short work of the leftovers at lunch the next day. Thanks!
*I'm editing this to give it 5 stars because it is just so easy, yummy and versatile. It pleases my hubby and father-in-law because it is hearty, and the rest of us just love the flavor. I have made it with kielbasa and with regular or sage sausage, with more or less peas, tomatoes, broth, etc. and it has never been bad. I may look up a homemade copycat rice mix recipe next time to make it less processed.

I didn't get my black-eye pea fix this New Year's Day, so I really wanted to try this soup. :-) I didn't have the pork sausage (don't care for pork anyway) so I used turkey smoked sausage instead. I started out by sauteeing a small onion with the sausage, used just one 15-oz. can of stewed tomatoes and one cup of water. Added a handful or two of frozen spinach at the end per another reader's suggestion. It looked quite festive, and tasted awesome! Made a big ol' pot to share with family, friends and appreciative co-workers. Now I know 2008 will be a good year cause I had my blackeye peas. Thanks!

What a wonderful recipe! I used leftover honey ham and also added red, green & yellow peppers, onions, and flavored canned tomatoes. In addition to the salt, I seasoned with accent and lawry's seasoning. As a side, I baked cornbread. A very hearty meal that we will definitely use again ^_^

Great black-eyed pea recipe for New Year's! I've been making this for 4 years now and never have any leftovers. Added some green pepper, celery and some red pepper flakes and serve on top of cornbread when finished with a side of turnip greens and you're set for the New Year!

Very good soup and super easy. I used hot and spicy sausage instead of the sage sausage and it gave the soup a little kick. I only added one can of tomatoes because I'm not a huge fan. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out great. Very flavorful. It would be easy to add other ingredients to it and customize it to your specific tastes.
