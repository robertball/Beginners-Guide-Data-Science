Creamy, full of flavor, and simply delicious. Don't be tempted to reduce the amount of strawberries, even while it may seem too much. The corn syrup acts as a stabilizer, and reduces crystalization, so I'll be curious to see how this ice cream fares after a few days--if it lasts that long! I used 1 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. half and half (experience has proven I like that ratio best) and added 1 tsp. vanilla to the cooked custard. I pureed about 2/3 of the strawberries in the food processor, then added the remaining strawberries and pulsed just to chop them up a bit.  It was the perfect combination. This is  intensely strawberry with a beautiful, vibrant color. I am anxious to try this with raspberries and blueberries!

This is very good if you want a basic, lovely strawberry ice cream recipe. I love to make ice cream and have been making it for many years. The only thing I would say is that you will need to stir your custard as it is heating. Remember to not let it boil! If you do not stir, your yolk will not properly incorporate and you will get cooked egg lumps. I imagine this is why she added the seive step. You will not need to draw it through a seive if you stir and keep the ingredients together. It will not take 5 minutes when you continually stir it. It is probably closer to about 15 to 20 before it coats the back of a spoon. It will give you a nice creamy texture and the ice cream will be very smooth. I promise! :) I also added fresh cut strawberries to the mixture at the last five minutes of my ice cream machine's cycle.

This is a very good, flavorful ice cream.  I made a couple of changes for ease more than flavor, and a couple for flavor.    For flavor, I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the berry puree.  I used a ratio of 2/3 heavy cream to 1/3 half and half - this gives a better overall ice cream texture.    For ease, I whisked the 1/3 part half and half with the egg yolks until it appeared completely mixed in, then added the sugar and corn syrup and stirred until desolved.  I poured the mixture directly into a cold pot and added the cream, them whisked until completely blended.  I heated over low heat, then once hot, increased the temp to medium low and cooked until mixture coated the back of a metal spoon.    Doing this eliminates the need to strain, and also eliminates the possibility of your yolks turning into cooked egg bits.    Adding corn syrup is great if the ice cream maker you are using has a metal mixing container.  Many times the metal gets too cold and the mixture will stick to the insides like a sorbet.  This did not happen with this recipe!  I had perfect, flavorful ice cream.    This recipe is also a good base for other flavors of ice cream, and not just of the berry variety.  I definitely plan to experiment.  We will use this recipe time and time again!  It's a winner.  Thank you to Christy J for sharing it.

Pretty good recipe.  Next time I try this, I'll double the batch though.  Too much effort to be all gone in just a couple of days.

A little too sweet, so I'll reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup next time ... and I used 1c. whole milk plus 1c. heavy cream for a slightly denser product.  Came out good! I did just mash the berries, though, instead of pureeing them.  I like the chunks!

I made this recipe because I had extra strawberries and a new ice cream maker. I normally do not eat strawberry ice cream. This however was AMAZING! A great recipe. I did as someone else had suggested and pureed most of the strawberries and chopped the remained up so that there are chunks in the mix. Loved by all!

This is my first attempt at strawberry ice cream and so far it is delicious fresh out of the machine.  Will have to see how hard it sets up and what the ice crystals are like after that.  But a great way to use up the extra berries I had after a dinner I catered.  Thanks, Christy J.!

The taste of the berries was like nothing I can buy, and I USED to buy nothing but premium ice cream.  Next time, I'll try using a bit less sugar.  And believe it or not, using the best, most ripe berries made a big difference.

Excellent recipe!  I changed a few things:  1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half and half so it wouldn't be too rich.  I also used 1/2 the strawberries (fresh).  With those changes, it was fabulous!!!

I'm not a big strawberry ice cream fan which is weird because strawberries are my favorite fruit. This recipe, on the other hand, was delicious! I could eat this anytime! For the reviewers that thought this was "too sweet" and wouldn't add so much sugar the next time, that really depends on your strawberries and how ripe they are. The strawberries I had weren't super ripe so the amount of sugar the recipe called for was perfect.

Pretty good, however the process was very involved and I ended up dirtying a lot of large dishes.  I probably won't make again as it tastes like store bought ice cream.  Plus, I didn't like the corn syrup-it just didn't feel right putting it in there.   I also noticed there was a horrible metallic aftertaste.

It was ok.  I will leave the cinnamon out if I make this again, as it was pretty over powering and not really necessary in strawberry ice cream, in my opinion and I think it had an undertone that actually took away from the berry flavor.  The texture was creamy and it never developed ice crystals even two days later, but it left a funky film on the roof of our mouths and on our spoons that just seemed to get worse the more we ate.  Not sure what that was from, but imagine it had to be either the yolks or the corn syrup.  Overall it was ok but personally, I think I'll make an eggless version next time.  Thanks for sharing!  =)

O-M-G, no kidding, this is strawberry perfection!  This may be the best ice cream I've ever had.  It's the end of strawberry season in Florida, and I picked up a flat (12 pints) of berries right at the grower's field this week for $4.99.  The berries were about as fresh as you can get, and maybe that's what made the difference.  In a recent cooking class I took, we made vanilla ice cream, and the chef put the custard into an ice bath until the temperature reached upper 50's.  I just put mine in the fridge, but I did chill it to 58 degrees F before putting it into the ice cream maker, and 25 minutes later, it was the perfect consistency.  This is so smooth, creamy, and rich, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks, Christy J, for this delectable recipe.

My husband and I thought it was excellent.  I left the strawberry puree fairly chunky.  I did not adjust the sugar, and added vanilla.

It wasn't too bad except for the film that get's left on the spoon and your mouth. I think I'd cut the amount of heavy cream and sub in more half and half if I try this one again.

Made this for a birthday party so I had to double the recipe. We made it up 2 days before the party and froze it, no ice crystals and soft enough to serve straight from the freezer. Everyone said it was like eating frozen whipped topping with strawberries, they loved it! Thumbs up from the picky sister makes this recipe a keeper.

I am an ice cream -making novice so I'm not sure what the problem was, but I found the texture of this to be too foamy and almost oily-tasting in my mouth.  From reading other comments I wonder if it would be better if I used part half and half or whole milk instead of all heavy cream.  I followed the recipe closely except I didn't puree the strawberries (just mashed them thoroughly).  Otherwise, the flavor was great-a little tart, not too sweet, very fresh.

EXCELLENT strawberry ice cream.  My husband, who is a strawberry lover said it's in his top two ever.  I may have added a bit more pureed strawberries, but otherwise left exactly as is described.  Will make again.

This was the best homemade ice cream my family has ever had...in fact, it was the best strawberry ice cream I've ever had.  We did not strain the custard through a sieve, just put it straight into the berries.  We also added a can of Sweetened Condensed Milk at the last minute just because it couldn't hurt.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.

The first homemade ice cream I've ever made that I actually thought was better than store bought! My kids and I LOVED the bright, fresh berry flavor. It kept extremely well in the freezer - no ice crystals. It was almost a cross between the light fruit flavor of a sorbet, but still creamy like ice cream. We can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is very good and a lot easier then others i have attempted. i did however use frozen strawberries instead of fresh (going for easy here). i think it helped because it cooled down the custard faster. and i cant tell the differance between using fresh and frozen. my boys say to give it 5 stars, so i do.

This stuff is WONDERFUL!  I am not a fan of fruit ice creams but had a quart of strawberries to do something with and I haven't made ice cream all summer so this was the ticket.  I truly believe ice cream needs to have egg yolks in it and again, this recipe fit the bill.  I did not change this at all except to add about 1 t of vanilla to the finished mixture before freezing and I used the dairy products I had on hand which was half and half (about 1 cup) and skim milk (1/2 cup).  I bet it is over the top delicious with heavy cream.  I will be making this again.

Great flavor and texture! If I were you, I would avoid using any half and half or milk.  This recipe has a lot of pureéd strawberries (mostly water) and you need all the fat from the cream to keep the texture right (and keep it from freezing too hard to scoop.)  Just my two cents.

Very good, I only gave it 4 stars because I did have to change a couple things.  It needs a pinch of salt.  It makes the berries brighter tasting.  I also pureed the berries with 1/4 c. sugar and a splash of lemon juice for the same reason.  I know how to temper eggs, but I still had egg bits in the bowl, so I'm glad I strained it anyway.
All in all, I'll keep this recipe because for some reason the Perfect Scoop doesn't have a strawberry ice cream recipe!

This was a delicious ice cream. I listened to other reviewers and used slightly less sugar, and it was scrumptious.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now and it is a *hit* exactly as written. Add some high-quality vanilla and you'll never buy strawberry ice cream again. 
My only criticism is, why add the extra step by putting the cream into the yolk/sugar mixture and then putting it back in the pan? Just mix the yolk/sugar into the pan, it works fine as long as you stir it. 
Also, make sure you puree the strawberries. I tried them chopped and it did not work. It was like biting into frozen strawberries.

This was AWESOME and was the hit of our neighborhood party! The only suggestion I would make is to puree only half of the strawberries (or any fruit, for that matter), and dice up/toss in the remainder. Chunks of fruit give the ice cream a bit of texture and some flavorful surprises to find as you eat the sweet treat.

This was great ice cream.  The sweetness of the berries dictates the amount of sugar so taste your berries.  my favorite combination is 2 parts heavy cream to 1 part half and half....so rich and creamy!

I was a little disappointed in this.  It was not sweet enough and the texture was off.  The ice cream was just wanting to fall apart which made it very hard to get a pretty scoop.  Very pretty color though!

After searching around for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for, I decided to give this a try as a test for the KitchenAid mixer ice cream bowl + attachments that a friend loaned me. I was skeptical about the corn syrup, but the flavor of this coming out of the freezer bowl was really tasty. Like other reviewers, I reserved some the berries and just rough-chopped them and tossed them in at the end to add a textural element.  Fabulous!

I made this recipe, but with peaches, since we had hit the orchard today...the family raved about it, and ordered me to make more some time! The flavor is phenomenal, especially with a little cinnamon on top.

I had the best success with this recipe than any other so far. I doubled the recipe, only mashed the berries, and used only 1/2 the cream, substituting 1/2 with whole milk. PERFECTION right out of the canister. Nice and thick, very scoop-able. I noticed someone mentioned a metallic flavor... I noticed this developing also, but my hunch is that it is simply the high-acid berries reacting with the aluminum canister. I put mine in a plastic storage container and it's fine. I can't wait to try this recipe with PEACHES!!!!!--(I used the Nostalgia electrics 4-quart ice cream maker)

Delicious! I tried this recipe twice twice, once as listed, and again by subbing some of the cream with half-and-half to try to reduce the fat content. Stick with the cream- even with the higher fat content, there were still some ice crystals after a couple nights in the freezer (which is obviously made worse by using half-and-half). This is such a flavorful, easy recipe with that great "summer" flavor.

Fantastic, creamy, flavorful and delicious!  Why do we buy that processed, artificial drool sold in supermarkets today?  I added shaved bakers semi-sweet chocolate toward the end of the churning/freezing process for the second batch and loved it.  I think this will be a superb base for any flavor and can't wait to try a vanilla bean batch and a chocolate batch.  Thanks Christy for this greatest of recipes.

This is great. I have reduced the corn syrup to 2 T and reduced the sugar a bit. Using 1/2 half and half and 1/2 cream is great, and i like to leave some of the strawberries not totally pureed.

Very good ice cream.  I agree with the reviewer that said she would make a double batch.  I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup half & half, and substituted a part of the corn syrup with vanilla syrup.

My first time making Ice Cream and what a winner I selected for my first try.  I followed the directions step by step and it was creamy, sweet and full of strawberry flavor from the fresh berries.  This is a keeper and I'll make it often.  Thanks!

I made this again last night and used Whipping Cream and added a package for Frozen Strawberries in light syrup.  It packed an awesome punch of strawberry flavor.  A Must try

The best strawberry ice cream I've ever made. Granted, it's the only strawberry ice cream I've ever made, but it was fantastic! Just what I was hoping for-creamy and delicious!  I pureed all but about 2/3 of the strawberries.  The rest I mashed for some chunks. This one's a keeper!

This was the BEST-tasting and most successful ice cream I've ever made!  I have decided, as one reviewer suggested, to use 1 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup  half and half (instead of using all heavy cream).  The ice cream was thick and tasty, but I think using 1/2 cup of half and half would make it more creamy.   I also pulsed 1/3 of the strawberries as to chop them and have some small chunks.  Overall, this recipe was a complete success and I'll definitely make it again!

I don't even like strawberry ice cream.  This was beyond delicious.  I made it for my family.  I followed some gal's advice about stirring the mixture after the ingredients were mixed so I didn't have to strain it.  I wonder how many products modern manufacturing ruins.  I wish I could give it 6 stars!

My first attempt at making ice cream and the result was fantastic!  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  I cooked the egg/cream base mixture over medium heat for 10 minutes.  I skipped the sieve step and the resulting ice cream was creamy.  Could not have been better.  My strawberries were pretty tart, which worked out fine because the resulting product was just right sweetness-wise, as I do not like too-sweet ice cream, and loved the fresh strawberry flavor with a hint of natural tartness.  Can't wait to use this recipe and adapt to other flavors.

Not creamy at all. The taste is good but it tastes like a frozen smoothie which is not what I expected.

This is fantastic!  I've made it exactly per the recipe and it was great!  I've also made it using 1/3 Strawberries, 1/3 Mango and 1/3 Orange and that was great also!

Very creamy, loaded with strawberry flavor. I doubled the recipe and added vanilla, as others suggested. I think I will make it with half cream and half milk next time. It was a little thick tasting for me. Husband loved it!

I thought this was delicious. My husband thought it tasted more like a smoothie than ice cream. Whatever. But my kids were 'meh'. What gives? They eat cookies off the floor for crying out loud. I made this exactly written but found there was no need to strain the custard if you babysit it while it's cooking. I think it's a solid recipe, apparently I live with mutants.

I forgot to add the corn syrup until the mixture was about half-way through the freezing process. It was still delicious. I made this in a salt & ice rotary freezer, then took out the paddle and put in the freezer for several hours before I served  it. It says it only makes six servings, but we served it beside strawberry cake and there were many more than 6 servings in that setting. Excellent taste. The piece of strawberry were frozen very hard. Next time, I'll look for a way to puree them more thoroughly. I added 10 drops of red food coloring and I believe that the color was perfect.

This is truly the best strawberry ice cream I have ever tasted! Very flavorful, smooth, creamy, and colorful. I doubled the batch for two ice cream makers, and it was no problem at all. I also made the mix, refrigerated it overnight, and mixed it the next day. It came out perfect! I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first time making ice cream, so I was a little worried when I realized I accidentally mixed the sugar, corn syrup and cream with the berries while the 1 1/4 cup of cream was being heated on the stove. It still turned out just fine! I used raspberries from the freezer that I picked last summer instead of strawberries. It was very flavorful and delicious!

OMG!  So easy and SOOO GOOD!  I have a Cuisinart 2Qt ice cream maker...so it was all I could do to keep everyone's spoon out of the pot while it was churning.  I did not strain anything, personally I'm not really sure what it meant to do that, so I just poured the creamed mix of egg and sugar (oh I substituted the sugar with Splenda for diabetic hubs) and corn syrup into the pureed strawberries.  I chilled a few hours in the fridge and then placed into the ice cream maker.  I just placed into the freezer so I wont know if the splenda will have any effect on ice crystals or not until later...if it lasts that long.  
Smooth creamy texture, doesn't have that filmy coat your mouth feeling and a tad bit sweet..but it all depends on the strawberry s mine were very ripe from the farm.  I'm sure with store bought fresh strawberrys it may need that extra sweetness.

Super creamy, rich, and smooth, this strawberry ice cream exceeded my expectations! I used 4 cups of frozen strawberries which I thawed and they worked perfectly. The ice cream base is great for variations, chocolate, plain vanilla etc. I will be using this recipe from now on!

Delicious! I didn't have enough heavy cream, so my adaptation had a mix of heavy cream and milk so I just added another egg yolk, plus I added a dash of vanilla just because.
