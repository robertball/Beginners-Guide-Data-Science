STOP THE BUS!!! Get off said bus, and RUN, don't walk...RUN to your kitchen and make these!!!! This recipe is a definite keeper. There were a couple of subs only because i didn't have the ingredients, and forgot one. i didn't have any creme fraiche, so i subbed low fat sour cream and and a splash of half and half. i didn't have any sherry vineagar, i used white wine vinegar and i forgot to add the oregano, so i just added it to the marinara (which i made). So delicious! i used brown basmati rice in the recipe and added some sauteed cremini mushrooms to the rice before serving. YUM! Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!

This is to rnelson775, all recipes call for certain ingredients; most people who know how to cook think about what they have on hand & substitute....  REALLY!   I have made numerous Chef John recipes & have never had a problem.  As other viewers states I used red wine vinegar & sour cream as that is what I had on hand...Very good & will make this again!

I thought this was great. As for some other reviews and concerns over the ingredients, lol, look..the sherry vinegar is just cooking wine in a nutshell. You can buy a bottle of it at Walmart for heavens sake. You can even substitute it if you like easily enough with, well, a few things. A creme freishe is easily made with whipping cream and buttermilk right at home. None of the ingredients in this recipe are too stumping. But they do make a tasty and moist meatball and a great alternative to a beef. My family enjoyed it very much. Thank for another meal in my rotation.

In my house albondigas contain fresh chopped mint from the herb garden. The flavor of these meatballs is enhanced by finishing the cooking in a red sauce. I plan meals in advance and obtain all the needed items beforehand. Thanks again Chef John for improving American tastes one dish at a time. Your name on a recipe is click-bait for me.

Sooooo good.  Like others, I substituted the creme fraiche and sherry vinegar with light sour cream and red wine vinegar because that is what my pantry has and left out the parsley since one of my kids is anti-green.  Big hit with the adults and the kids.  Definitely going into regular rotation.

I really liked the texture of the meatballs but I found the cumin overpowered the other flavours in the sauce.  I did make a few changes due to dietary restrictions and what I had on hand. I didn't have sherry vinegar so I subbed white wine vinegar as another reviewer did. I had to make it dairy free so I subbed a flavourless coconut based coffee creamer that I thickened with a 1/2 tsp of corn starch instead of the creme fraiche.  There were three of us for dinner and it was rated 3, 4 and 5 therefore I gave it a four.

Excellent easy recipe, turned out delicious. I did not have smoked paprika, used regular paprika and threw in a teaspoon of Worcestershire to the meatball mixture.

This recipe is awesome! Great alternative to the ho-hum Italian meatballs we always make. Family all liked it too, however next time I will cut down a smidge on the cumin & cayenne. (It was fine for my taste buds but was a tad too spicy for husband and daughter.) I made the recipe as-is except for a couple of things. I used sour cream with a bit of half-n-half because I didn't have creme fraiche, and long-grain brown rice because that's what I had on hand. As for the reviewer who complained the sauce was too boring, I used a good quality seasoned tomato/pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and it turned out wonderful. And after baking the meatballs, I put them in a slow cooker to finish off instead of on the stove top (just because I had the time to do so). The meatballs were tender and the flavors were out of this world! This will definitely be made again in our house.Great recipe, thanks for posting!

I followed the recipe exactly. We did not enjoy these at all. The flavors /spices used did not work well IMO and the tomato sauce was bland and acidic.

This was  my first time making meatballs.  These were super  and very tasty.  Followed recipe to a T except I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand so subbed with red wine vinegar and used pre-cooked brown rice instead of white.  Served with roasted broccoli.  Will make again. Thanks Chef John!

The meatballs were melt in your mouth tender and so flavorful !
I had to make few changes to use what I had on hand. I used ground chicken, white vinegar for sherry vinegar and milk for creme fraiche. This amount made 15 medium meatballs for me. I served with "quick and spicy spaghetti squash" also from this site.

They were delicious. I didn't make the sauce. I made a tzitki sauce with it and made pita sandwiches.  Big hit with the husband.

Half the family loved it, half thought it was too spicy.  I doubled the recipe as it was two pounds of ground turkey but  I should have left it same amount of spices for one pound.  It would have been more than enough flavor.  We like spicy and it was over the top.  Would try it again though.

Everyone loved it!  The only thing that I did different is I used pasta sauce since I had no tomato sauce.  I served it on rice.  Will make it again.

I think the cumin an spices gave it a taco taste and with the tomato based sauce my brain kept going to Italian. Worth trying but I won’t be making it again.

YUM! I  only made a few changes. I used mint instead of parsley in the meatballs because it was what I had on hand and another reviewer mentioned it. Also used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. I had home made Turkey stock from the freezer. Served meatballs and sauce with rice. Everyone raved.

I am glad I read the encouraging reviews because I liked this a lot. I served it over Brazilian White Rice (the recipe is on this website). I used 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne because I like things spicy - I think next time I would use even more cayenne. The meatballs were tender and flavorful.

FABULOUS!!! We loved these meatballs! I forgot to put the garlic in the meatball mixture so I put it in the sauce instead (and added extra as I love garlic). I used sherry cooking wine in place of the sherry vinegar. And ended up using the entire 14.5 oz can of chicken broth. It was wonderful!!!! So much flavor with just a slight touch of heat.

I would make it again. It's very good with the smoked paprika, parsley, saffron rice. My meatballs were soft, but they held together in the sauce, and separated completely with my fork in the rice when served. I don't know if the meatballs are supposed to be firmer, but I would make again.

I can't use garlic, due to dietary restrictions of my husband. The saffron rice gave it the perfect blend of flavors. 

Add more cayenne, either to the sauce or meatballs, if you want it more hot.

Another score for Chef John!  We loved this recipe!  I've never been a fan of ground turkey, but this dish made me a believer.  The spices for the meatballs gave a richness and depth of flavor  that provided a good pair with the saffron rice.  Even though there are a lot of ingredients, it all came together quickly.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious. I addd a splash of Worcestershire sauce to the sauce mix and it turned out perfect. I found there was too much sauce for the meat though.

OK,  I used meatless meatballs, cauliflower saffron rice,  added onions and a few extra spices. 

Great vegetarian dish and a whole lot less calories. 

Thanks for the framework!

Great, easy recipe. I substituted sour cream for creme fraiche, but it was good. I also added some garlic salt to the meatballs.

Made the recipe for meatballs exactly with the deletion of the cayenne pepper to make it more kid friendly. Everyone loved them which is a difficult feat in my house.  I substituted sour cream and red wine vinegar and the sauce was perfect.  Will definitely make these again!

I substituted the sherry vinegar for white wine and I used my micro plane to make sure the garlic was fully incorporated (don't like biting into bits of garlic).  Love the recipe, easy to make and has a great flavor.  Definitely a make again recipe!!

My family and I loved this tasty recipe.  I didn't have all the ingredients like the sherry vinegar, and the parsley. I used fresh rosemary instead of parsley and it was delicious.  I skipped the vinegar all together.

Excellent!  Served over Saffron rice.  I used brown rice in the meatballs.  Didn't have sherry vinegar so used red wine vinegar.  Lactose intolerant so used lactose free milk with a tiny bit of butter melted in, instead of Creme Fraiche.  Made the pasta sauce I use for spaghetti (with the spices, etc. as I normally do), and then added the red wine vinegar and broth to it.   Oh, used 1/2 the salt called for in the meatballs.

These meatballs were a huge hit with my family.  I didn't cook them in the sauce as not all family members like sauce and they were delicious on their own. I also substituted the vinegar and creme freshe (for balsamic and sour cream) and it worked fine.  I might try  brown rice next time as others have done just to make them a tad healthier. Thanks for the great recipe.

This came out so flavorful!!! I served over saffron basmati rice and the entire meal was perfect. I didn't need to add anything as the sauce stayed loose during the first 45 min and thickened up perfectly during the last 45 min. I also double up the portions to make 5 large plates (2 meatballs per)

Meatballs were tasty and my  husband enjoyed them.  I substituted basmati brown rice and while dense, these were still good. I loved the tips on having moist hands to roll meatballs.  I also ate over rice and had leftovers over spaghetti squash for a paleo twist.  I used basil and herb tomato sauce in addition to all the ingredients.  I also used crema suprema and garnished with mint leaves and cotija cheese.  I doubled the sauce and that was plenty. Thank you for the recipe and cooking fun Chef John!

The stars above aren't mine, but I should have checked here first, for my Betty Crocker recipe for Porcupines has disappeared, so I'm making a Daly special porcupine at the moment.  It is a turkey ball, with tomato sauce over it.  It is for a church pot luck luncheon there this morning.  I do pray that it will be OK.  As for a recipe of any nature, I just start pulling appropriate items from my frig, chopping in the blender, but basically, I see I'm very close to yours.  Have a good day.

Really great and the perfect twist for kids used to Italian cooking.  Here are the tweets we made: substituted lebne (lebanese yogurt cheese) for creek fraiche, used sherry and a little white wine vinegar for the sherry vinegar, used 2 eggs for the meatball mixture and added both cumin and  coriander.  Next time - double the sauce.  It cooks down to nothing if u need the full 60 min.

When you make this as written and not with ground turkey breast, this is a five star recipe.  That being said, I make it (except for the first time) with ground turkey breast.  It is really delicious.  My husband and I really love these.  It's quite filling, the sauce is really yummy and for the time involved, very satisfying recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it is delicious.

Wow - so good!  I didn't make very many changes - just read through all the reviews and took a few pointers here and there.  Meatballs - made as is.  
Sauce - sauteed about 1/2 finely diced onion and a bit of garlic (I used the Christopher Ranch already chopped garlic in a jar) in some olive oil and added the spices (salt, pepper to taste, a bit of Italian seasoning and the recommended amount of paprika). Then I added the rest of the ingredients, except for the cream, which I added at the end.  Speaking of cream, I used Mexican crema because creme fraiche was 7 dollars.   I used some left-over tomato basil pasta sauce (Private Selection Basilica) and about 3/4 can of Hunt's Tomato Sauce, because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar and a small splash of red wine.  Served over saffron rice.  Next time I will pick up some Mexican queso fresco or cotija cheese to sprinkle on top!

The meatballs are tender and delicious but the sauce could use some work. When I first tasted it before putting the meatballs in, it was creamy and delicious. However, after an hour of simmering the meatballs it had darkened in color and the flavor was more acidic instead of creamy. Typically, you would put herbs in at the beginning and any dairy products at the end for a sauce. I think putting in the creme fraiche too early ruined the flavor. One of my family members even commented it tasted like Chef-Boy-R-Dee which is obviously not a compliment! Next time I will put the parsley in first and wait until serving time to stir in the creme fraiche.

It was good, but I felt the sauce tasted either off or was just missing something. It reminded me of the inside of stuffed peppers and tasted quite close to ground beef. I'm gonna send recipe to my family to try too.

What a delicious combo of flavors we loved it! I made a few delineations instead of cooked rice I used cooked orzo - instead of Cream Fresh  I used heavy cream and instead of 1 TBSP sherry I used1/4 c Champagne!  Made meatballs 1/3 cup size w/Cooking time in sauce 60 mins only & Meatballs were so moist.

We enjoyed the dish very much. The meatballs were tender and tasty. I subbed Mexican crema and a combo of balsamic and cider vinegar. Served it over orecchiette because I felt it needed something to hold the sauce. Next time I'll use spaghetti squash to keep it gluten free.

I have made this several times. They freeze well. I make stuffed grapeleaves around Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am going to use this receipe this year to stuff them. I may add a couple of other ingredients. I will post again after I make them and let you know how they turn out. This is a very good receipe.

This was easy and delish. I forgot to add the egg to the meatballs and they stayed together beautifully!!!  I gave this a 4 because the video has chef John using marinara sauce vs tomato in the recipe. I used the marina and it was awesome. I also served it over saffron rice.  I doubled the recipe.

I like this version of meatballs a lot and a nice 'lighter' variation to traditional ground beef.  I had everything in stock except the crème fraiche so I used plain yogurt and it seemed fine.  A nice combination of spices and I did not find anything overpowered.  Will definitely make again.  Trying to think of a different sauce to finish them off in rather than tomatoey sauce every time.  Ideas??

This was excellent! I was actually surprised by the result. My family is raving about it, gobbling up the leftovers and asking when I will make it again. I followed the recipe with the exception of the creme fraise and sherry vinegar. I didn't have any so subbed straight sour cream and ume plum vinegar. Make extra rice when you cook rice for the meatballs so you have it for serving. Yum!

WOW! that was good! I really, really liked that one! I've tried a couple of Chef John's recipes and they are always delicious, fast, and healthy. We are a family that eats a lot of rice, and I hate to throw out the leftover rice, so it just accumulates in the fridge. This recipe not only uses it up, it makes the turkey meatballs so moist and delicious! One of my daughters has to eat low-fat, and this recipe was perfect! Very low-fat, but not low on taste! I had to leave out the creme fraiche, because she can't eat dairy, but I didn't think our usual substitutes would work, so we just went with a flavorful tomato sauce. I didn't have sherry vinegar, but added sherry. I was worried that there would be too much salt in the meatballs and ALMOST cut that back, but I didn't, and it was great! 

Making the meatballs on a cookie sheet in a hot oven was a stroke of brilliance . They were browned and tasty withouy falling apart. Delicious recipe! This is going on our regular rotation.

Is there any recipe by Chef John that isn't awesome? Gosh, this was just so mouth watering good! Why did I never think of using an ice cream scoop as part of preparing meatballs?!?! While, it make take time to cook, the recipe is effortless and end result is just so delicious! No need to adjust ingredients in the recipe.

I'm in love with these, can't wait to make them again! I followed the recipe, except cut down the salt in the meatballs to 1 tsp. I also swapped sour cream for the crème fraiche.  I served it over spaghetti squash. Using 1/4 cup meat mixture per meatball, it made about 14 meatballs.

Made this for dinner last evening and my family loved it!  I made absolutely no changes, and none were needed.  Chef John continues to inspire me as I've made many of his recipes.

I used ground turkey because that is what I had and homemade chicken stock and red gravy from the freezer. I did all other recipe items by the book! I have made this 3 times and serve it with mashed potatoes and bacon jam. We love this recipe!!

Takes time but worth it. Followed recipe fairly close and served with my family recipe sauce. All four kids and wife loved it. No complaints and many requests to make again.

Turned out sauce was fine but meatballs were sour and tasted like they absorbed the vinegar in the sauce.

The only thing I did was add a little red wine to the sauce, and everything was delicious, my family loved it!  I served it over toasted sourdough cheese bread, like an open faced sandwich!  Make a quick salad and you have a great weeknight meal!!

Delicious. Made exactly as written except used ground turkey breast.( I don't like dark meat). Made the creme fraiche. So easy. 1 cup whipping cream and 2 Tablespoons buttermilk. Stir together in a covered glass container. Let sit at room temperature for 24 hours and it was perfect.  The sauce was very good and creamy for a heart healthy dinner. I made a second batch with sauce and froze them for another time. Thank you for this recipe.

This was very well received and I found the spicing to be interesting.   While my personal preference is for a "moister" meatball (which I never find with ground turkey), everyone else was delighted with the lower fat content and firm texture of the meatballs.  I found one or two of the spices tended to drown out the rest, as far as the meat, so I would suggest experimenting until you have the right mixture.  The sauce was delightful, truly fresh tasting; the creamy texture helped balance out the less fatty meat.  Again, you might have to experiment with the sauce spicing to meet your own tastes, and I did add a tiny amount of sugar to it to cut acidity.  The meatballs only need to be simmered 60 minutes max- the longer you simmer these, the "tougher" they will become, so go easy.  All in all, simple to make and great tasting.  Serve over saffron rice, complement with some baby spinach salad, and you've got an outstanding meal!

I did not use creme fraiche in the sauce, as one of the people I made it for is lactose intolerant.

I was supposed to prepare this recipe last week!  Ground turkey was on sale at the grocery store.  I had sufficient leftover saffron basmati rice to use in the recipe.  All the remaining ingredients were available in my pantry - what more could I do?  We enjoyed these meatballs, including those leftover , which warmed up well.

This recipe was great!  I only had one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce so I also added a 15.5 oz. of diced tomatoes.  I wanted to get rid of some fat free Greek yogurt so I used that with a little light sour cream.  The sauce did thicken up quite a bit so I had to add a little more chicken broth (or could have used water) to thin it.  I served it over Far East rice pilaf.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will be making it again.

I was very impressed with how this  turned out. The entire family enjoyed it, including my 8 and 5 year olds.  I served it over jasmine rice (I did not have basmati rice) cooked with a pinch of saffron (which I ground up before adding). I used cream in lieu of creme fraiche  and red wine vinegar in lieu of sherry vinegar. Delicious!

I made this and it was very good. I do not like dark poultry meat so I used ground turkey breast and added a little more olive oil because it was so lean. I made the sauce in the Crockpot and my only regret is not adding the meatballs sooner so they could be in the sauce longer. In my quest to eat more veggies I added mushrooms, some zucchini and fresh spinach and didn't serve it over additional rice. I enjoyed it and felt it was a healthy meal.

These are the best meatballs I've ever made. The only change I made was to not add cumin as my husband has a strange aversion to it. I also cooked some egg noodles to pour the meatballs and delicious tomato sauce over. For the tomato sauce- I sauteed some garlic in olive oil w/ some salt & pepper and dried italian seasoning before adding the spaghetti sauce (I used Barilla tomato and basil). Delicious!

Okay, so the meatballs are great. I also did some alterations. Since I didn't have a lot of time I used Newmans Own Peppers spaghetti sauce (it's healthy and no sugar in it).  I also only used 1/2 cup long grain brown rice to cut some calories. It made no difference in taste and was still wonderful!!! You don't have to serve this with the saffron rice. I used Private Selection creole rice but you could use brown rice or saffron. I love saffron but did not have it at the time. I will be making this dish again.

I subbed sherry vinegar for white wine vinegar and left out the cumin since I had run out. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and loved it. I make porcupines, cabbage roll stuffing etc. with rice, but for some reason, never thought of making meatballs with rice. I will make this again using either turkey, chicken or beef.
