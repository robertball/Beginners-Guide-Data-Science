This was so yummy and a nice change from a usual vegetable. It could actually be a “meal” but I used it as a side dish for my family. My husband said that he could eat it every night and my oldest two boys loved it. My younger two children actually didn’t “complain” so I know we’re on to something. I actually may start taking this to group dinners/Christmas etc as a wonderful alternative to heavy vegetable casseroles.
