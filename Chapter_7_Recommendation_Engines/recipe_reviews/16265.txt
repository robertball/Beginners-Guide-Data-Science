I had to adjust this pie slightly because I had a hard time finding cranberry Jello (probably because it's not the holiday season). I used cran-raspberry juice, sugar-free raspberry Jello and "light" whipped topping. For the pie shell, I made a graham cracker crust. We all LOVED this pie, even my husband who claims he hates Jello. He never even noticed. GREAT light dessert on a hot day.

My husband's favorite Thanksgiving pie.  he even makes it.  Instead of cranberry gelatin, he substitutes raspberry.  And he uses a graham cracker crust.  Never any leftovers.

Delicious light and easy pie. Another good point is that it isn't too tart. Frozen whipped topping is not available where I live, so I used 2 cups stiffy whipped cream (about 1 cup whipping cream stiffy whipped).

This is a wonderful recipe.  I was given it ages ago by someone else and searched today to remind myself how to make it.  The only difference is a store bought or even better a homemade graham cracker crust.  Even if you aren't a cranberry lover this is amazing.

Tasty and easy.  I used a pre-made grahmn cracker crust and served with whipped cream.  It was  a perefect palate cleasner and went great next to my pumpkin pie.  I was surprised how much I liked it since I am not a cranberry lover, but I did enjoy how light refreshing it was after all the heavy food we had for thanksgiving.

I made the mousse part, didn't put it in a pie shell, and it was wonderful! My only mistake was to not let it chill until thickened; I rushed it at maybe 2 hours, and it was a bit runny, but my guests were none the wiser and raved. Oh, I also didn't use frozen whipped topping b/c of the chemicals in it; I made fresh whipped cream instead. So it probably wasn't as sweet as it otherwise would have been (which is a good thing--there's already a ton of sugar in this). LOVE IT!

My grandma always made this pie for Thanksgiving.  As a child I thought that it was the best tasting thing on earth.  Most kids love it as well as adults.  I think she used Raspberry jello instead of cranberry.

I made this pie exactly by the recipe and my family loved it.  I did decorate it up a bit with a pretty whipped cream edge on top with fresh raspberries and sliced almonds for decorations.

My family loved this dessert. I didn't have enough whipped topping, so I sub'd sour cream. I served with a dollop of whipped topping on each piece and sprinkled with chopped pecans. Yum.

I just made the mousse without the pie shell, for Thanksgiving as the cranberry side. I didn't have cranberry Jello so had to use raspberry, unfortunately. The ONLY thing I'd change about this recipe is not using whipped topping and instead making your own WITHOUT any sweetener added (I added a little bit of vanilla and almond extract). The mousse was plenty sweet enough, even if I had served it for dessert. And I like things sweet! If I had used sweetened whipped topping, it would have just been over the top sugary.

This was very tasty and refreshing - the only change I made was to use rasberry jello, made my own graham crust and although it was fine with the crust I think I prefer it in a dessert bowl as is with a dollop of whip cream on top!  Will definitely make this again ~

I thought this recipe would make a nice new addition to our Thanksgiving meal...I was looking for something light to pair with the heaviness of pumpkin and sweet potatoe pies. Well, this was it! My husband was skeptical and was sure that this pie would be the last to go, but on the contrary, it was the first to disappear! We loved the light creamy texture, and the refreshing flavor! This will become a permanent part of our Thanksgiving menu.

I live with two men who are really hard to please.  And I'm not a cranberry lover myself ... but since I introduced this pie at Thanksgiving two years ago, I've had to make it year long!

I read this recipe and thought "really?"  Then I made it and thought "really!"  It reads like a dinosaur from the 60s, but it's really good, and both times I've brought it to pot lucks, it's vanished before everything else.

It was a bit too strong for my taste -- both too tart and too sweet at the same time. Maybe next time I will try adding more whipped topping to tone it down a little. Also I had to stick it in the freezer for a bit to keep it from being too mushy.

This is my kind of recipe as it comes together with ease, and is not particular regarding measurements.  I used a large size graham cracker crust, and it was just the right size.    I used the full 8 ounce container of Cool Whip instead of measuring out two cups so the pie was slightly soft but the cut pieces held their shape. I folded in 1/3 cup of plumped, chopped  Craisins when I added the Cool Whip.  My family really enjoyed this pie and wanted more.

I was unable to find cranberry Jello and used raspberry Jello instead.   The flavor combination works, buts this dessert is overly sweet.  And since it is made from all highly processed foods, it tastes like highly processed foods.  Yuck.

I added another cup of whip because it was a little too tart.  The next time I make this I will layer it into individual cups instead of the pie form.  This would be a great dessert around the holidays.

This recipe also can be used just as a mousse for a great dessert or side dish.  I prefer to make as a mousse.  Very delicious recipe.
