This was delicious! It's the first time I cut butter into flour, and the result was light and fluffy even though it was whole wheat. I used frozen wild berries that were picked on my grandma's land a couple of years ago, and made 4 cups of the berry and sugar mixture. I saved extra for spreading on biscuits or toast!
