Very easy and very good! I would have never thought to prepare fajitas using Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning mix! For the marinade, I used olive oil vs. veg. oil, cut the amount of black pepper in half and added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder along with a bit of minced garlic. I used sirloin vs. flank steak and let it marinate in the ziploc bag all day. This would work equally well with chicken. Since this was a "Ranch-Style" marinade, I felt it would lend itself nicely to a wrap and nothing pairs better with ranch than bacon, right? So, instead of grilling the onion and pepper I fried up some bacon and gave these a BLT twist. I assembled these with some Colby-Jack cheese, fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes, and bacon - DH was in heaven. These were great with all the traditional fajita sides - fresh salsa, guacamole, and of course sour cream!

These are the BEST fajitas I've ever had! I forgot to marinate them in the morning before work, so the steak only marinated for 2 hours. But it was still juicy and delicious! Even my picky toddler ate it. I also didn't have lime juice so I substituted lemon juice instead. Worked pretty well. I also added a small squeeze of honey (maybe 1/2 TBSP) to the marinade just to give it a little sweetness. I'm excited to try this agin when it marinates for the full 6 hours!

These were pretty good.  You can detect a subtle hint of Ranch and lime, but overall not a lot of flavor to the meat.  Still quite tasty when it all comes together.

We liked this. I used 2 whole peppers and 2 pounds of cheap flank steak. I used lemon juice since thats what I had on hand. The leftovers will make a good steak salad for dinner.

I unintentionally marinated the flank steak overnight (something came up) and they were still delicious.   This was a big hit with the family.

Very good.   The ranch flavor was almost non-detectable and it definitely needed salt.   If you cook this in a pan, as I did, you are going to half to cut the oil in half, at least.   Otherwise it is too oily.   No fault of the recipe, because it clearly does not call for this method.

These were great! I marinated my meat overnight and used flat iron steak instead of the flank steak (it was cheaper). The meat came out moist tender and flavorful. The whole family really enjoyed these...I will def be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
