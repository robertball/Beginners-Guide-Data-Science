I just wanted to add some information to my mom's recipe. When the recipe says 3 tbs, that's 3 heaping tbs (but adjust to your liking). You may reduce the soy sauce down to 1/3 cup - the recipe won't allow me to correct this but I do find 1/2 cup to be a bit salty. You can throw the chicken in the pot still frozen, it still gets well-cooked all the same. It's important to use bone-in chicken as it makes the meat more tender while cooking, that's why I prefer drummettes. I like to toss in baby carrots instead of chopping large ones. If you're using Red potatoes, add them at the same time as the chicken since they need more time to soak the sauce in. I liked someone's suggestion of bell peppers, I'm using it now myself. Once everything is in the pot, reduce the heat to med-low. The sauce won't cover all the ingredients, so you'll need to stir occasionally. It's ready when you can half a carrot & potato piece and see the sauce has soaked inside (won't soak very far into Red potatoes). The liquid will thicken more as it cools. And if you make this recipe with anything other than Korean hot pepper paste "gochujang," such as sriracha, then you did not make this authentically as this is the primary ingredient for this recipe - please don't knock down the review if you don't like your substituted version. Always serve this over a plate of rice.

This is dish is very delicious and very authentic.  I remember my mom making it when I was younger.  Here are some of my changes:  I added 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped ginger and instead of the red hot bean paste, I used Korean red pepper.  The commercial red hot bean paste has a lot of extra stuff you might not want.  The red pepper will give it the same flavor without the extra stuff.  Yummy!  Would make it again!

One recommendation I would make is although, you might want the dish to be healthier by using boneless chicken breast, you will loose a lot of flavor by doing so.  Use the the drumettes or chicken thighs with bones.  Something about cooking meat with the bone in makes it so much better!  I usually trim as much of a the fat as possible off most of it and leave one piece of chicken with the fat.  It's part of the whole flavoring thing.  Growing up the only way we ate this dish was served with white rice.

Great recipe! I am not Korean, but I love Korean food.  I actually came to love Korean food from watching Korean Dramas (sounds weird, but makes total sense to a Korean drama addict!).  

I loved this recipe, but it took me two tries to get it right.  Here is what I have learned:
1. It is a good idea to use drumettes--because the bones and small size help to thicken the sauce.  Using a breast or other chicken parts won't thicken it as well.
2. I stir fry my drumettes in a tablespoon of vegetable oil to brown the skin while I make the sauce and finish chopping the vegetables.  This makes the drumettes so delicious! I stir fry them until they are slightly browned (about 10 minutes), and then pour the sauce on top and stir in the vegetables.  I cover it and lower the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes more until the vegetables are softened.  Browning the drumettes helps to make the sauce much richer, too--because as they brown I stir them and the little bits get scraped up, so by the time I add my sauce--the chicken flavors have been released and enhanced.
3. I don't use the red pepper sauce--instead I add a teaspoon of ginger and some red pepper dry spice (not too much, because I have children). This works fine.  
4. You have to eat this with the potatoes and rice (from a rice cooker, please!)--to skip the rice because the potatoes are already a "starch" is just sad.  Korean food--you need the rice!
Thank SARAKYONG
for posting it! Bashya--you will be blessed.

I'm korean and this recipe is definitely authentic. It is meant to be spicy so if you dont like spicy this is not the recipe for you. I used a combination of boneless skinless breasts and legs. Definitely use a combination. Something about the bone-in makes it juicy. I used about 1 cup of water because I like a little more sauce and plus the potatoes tend to soak it a good bit of it. I used 1/3 cup of low sodium soy sauce and only 1 Tbs of sugar as someone had recommended. I also added a good 1/2 cup of green onions in the last 10 mins of cooking. My aunt used to add this. I also added extra garlic- minced! and red pepper flakes because I love spicy!! Also about the hot pepper paste: this is a key ingredient. Must use the korean hot pepper paste otherwise you are making a totally different recipe and definitely use 3 huge heapings of it. One last thing....it definitely has to be served over rice. Not serving this with rice would be like serving meat sauce without the spagetti pasta! Thanks for the recipe! My husband raved about it!! The meat just fell off the bones and was very juicy. I can see myself making this very often!

My boyfriend and I eat Korean food quite often and this particular dish has always been a favorite of his. This was my first time cooking it for him. Overall he really enjoyed it. The only part that neither one of us cared for was that the recipe was too sweet. I would definitely cut back on the sugar next time and add bell peppers as we have had before. Thank you for the recipe!

My wife is part korean and had the paste already on hand to make this. She told me the Korean name for this meal is "tak toritang." "Gochujang" is the Korean name for the paste. It was her first time and it came out soooo good! I'd say it was a mild spicy. It's a good hardy meal and I can't wait to have it again.

Delicious and easy! Just a few modifications:  I used drumsticks and wings (started them frozen with the soy sauce and water while I prepped the veggies), reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon and substituted 1 1/2 tablespoons of Grandma's Volcanic Hot Sauce (something I picked up in Barbadoes) for the hot pepper paste.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious. Very hearty. I used chili garlic sauce (sambal) instead of the hot spicy paste. It was very spicy. May use 2 tbsp instead of 3 tbsp next time.

This was great!  I've never tried making Korean food till now.  It reminds me of the Filpino adobo but spicy version.  I did add some sesame oil and marinated the chicken and vegetables overnight.  I then put about a cup of water and a cup of the marinade and let it simmer for exactly an hour.  The meat was falling off the bones and the vegetables were PERFECT! I used chicken legs and thighs for this.  Thanks Sara!

My mom is Korean and unfortunetly I haven't learned how to make all my favorite Korean dishes.  When I saw this I thought it looked really easy, I could handle it.  I prepared everything like the recipe says & then called my mom to see how she did it.  She told me to add a little bit of sugar and some red pepper flakes.  She never measures anything.  I also threw in an extra clove of garlic and more potatoes & carrots.  Of course, she said 1/2 cup was to much soy sauce but that's what I used and it tasted fine.  She's always complaining about how much soy sauce we use ("It's to salty!!!")  Add more red pepper paste if you want it spicier.

The meat, potatoes, onions and carrots all tasted the same.  It all had the same flavor. I grew tired of the taste after a couple of bites.

Loved it. I cut the chicken into smaller bite sized pieces, and cooked the whole thing for a bit longer. It was easy to make, and came out Delicious. Definitely a "mans" kind of meal; when my mom's boyfriend ate it he kept going on about how it was the best thing he had ever tasted... and he ate it cold! The potatoes did take a while to get soft, but I'm not sure if that was due to the pot I was using.

I like mine super spicy, so I omit the amount of sugar. I also add some dried red chili peppers (course grind), or if you don't have that cayenne pepper about 1 1/2 Tablespoons. also add 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Also, for fun instead of drumettes, I use a whole cornish hen chopped into chunks the size of drumettes. Or for healthier approach use, chicken breast chunks (not frozen).

Delicious!  My mother used to make this dish a lot when I was growing up.  I've tried, unsuccessfully, to get an exact recipe from my mom.  This was great and the closest I've come to matching her recipe.

The hubby requested Korean food so I tried this, and we were not disappointed.  Reading the suggestions, I decreased the soy sauce to 1/3 C and increased the water to 1/2 C.  I also added just a splash of sesame oil for the flavor.  I didn't have drummettes so I used tenderloins, which came out very well and is probably easier to eat.  I will definitely make this again.  Wish there were more Korean recipes...

Super easy to make.  Made a couple of days before to let the ingredients soak up the flavoring and, let it simmer for a LONG time.  The meat was flaking off the bones!  Yum!

I used boneless chicken thighs and I actually didn't use the hot sauce which doesn't follow the recipe.  But I know some people can't do any spicy whatsoever, so I'm just saying if you follow the recipes otherwise it still takes great, very natural and healthy tasting.... hearty

Well, this is just one of those great recipes that I'll be making over and over. So far, I've fed "my version" to 6 people and every one asked for the recipe. I did make changes to suit my own situation: 1. I doubled the recipe. 2. I made it in a large crock pot (10 hours). 3. I added 30 ounces of canned chicken broth. 4. I used Sweet Chili Sauce (Mae Ploy brand) instead of the hot paste. We ate this with deli rolls and butter -- utterly fantastic!!! Thank you so much for sharing your fine recipe, Sara. You are a wonderful chef!
Big Pat.

I saw this food is tasty and a hardy food about reviewers. Your recipe about this food is excellent. But, I'd like to say that Tak Toritang is changed Tak Pokkeumtang. Tori is Japanse which stands for birds or chicken. I know Pokkeum is harder than tori. however, I hope to make Tak Pokkeumtang one of the Korea ethnic dishes clear. Thank you for reading notes. 
 p.s I considered your phonetic problems. d, b sounds are more difficult than t,p sounds.

This is fantastic.  I made exactly as directed except I used two pounds boneless skinless thighs.  I served with sushi rice on the side.  I normally only cook brown rice but I think that sticky sushi rice complements this well.

This might be one of the 5-10 best dishes I have ever made, and I am 50 years old so that is saying something.

As others have said, the liquid might not seem enough at first but keep simmering and stirring and you will be rewarded.  I simmered about 1:15 but it would tolerate even longer if you wanted to.

Very nice dish.

My Korean husband loooved this.  We moved to a small town which has no korean restaurants and this was my first attempt at a korean dish.  The grocery store only had a korean sweet and spicy paste but it still came out delish, and I was told to make this more often.  YUm Yum Yum

What can I say this recipe is fast and easy not spicy at all. Definetly would cut the sugar in half next time its a bit to sweet for me. Also, ive used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. By the way this recipe is delish and a keeper.

This is delicious.  I served with rice.  I used chili garlic sauce (the kind in the jar with rooster on it -- not siracha) instead of the hot sauce called for because that's what I had on hand.

Yummy! I use chicken thighs usually, b/c I have them on hand, but it always turns out great! I add 1 cup of water instead of 1/4 (b/c I always add more potatoes & carrots than called for) and let it simmer for much longer to let all the flavors really absorb into the veggies. Thank you for the great recipe!

we love this — and I'm Korean :-) i usually use breasts instead of drumettes and add some freshly grated ginger, this smells amazing while it's simmering. if you don't have hot pepper paste on hand, Sriracha (the hot chili sauce) works incredibly well in this too.

This recipe was great !!!...Tried again a few days later & I wanted the chicken to be a little crispy so I browned the chicken in a skillet for about 5 minutes first...Was absolutely great.... Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is great! l made a few changes l only put one teablespoon of Gochujang paste so the taste isn't that hot and l add more potatos on it and some green onions or spring onions to add a color. l add a bit of water too..And turned out GREAT! YUM YUM! Oh l also tried this recipes using beef instead of chicken. l used no bones beef cut into bite size. And turned great too!  This is really great in cold season. We love it! Thank you for sharing, Sarakyong!

I grew up with this recipe and LOVED it!  I'm pregnant and can't handle spicy food so I skipped out on the hot pepper paste (go-chu-jang) and still thought that it tastes delicious.  I added red and green bell peppers and doubled the potatoes (the potatoes are my favorite part to this recipe).

Wonderful!

I really enjoyed this recipe, tasted just like what I would eat when I was in Korea. I would suggest something though, I added some bok choi to my batch right at the end and let them soften just a bit before serving. They gave a good change in texture and taste, especially good if you are serving people who are not used to Korean level spice! It also made the meal look nicer too! Another change I made was that I added some rice vermicelli, I cooked it and through it in at the end, right before the bok choi...a nice change from rice.

i love it!!! I just made the dish and it came out great.  I actually did reduce the soy sauce by 1/4 cup since i like the flavor of gochujan (hot pepper sauce) more.  Added some more water to cover up all my chicken just so that everything cooks evenly.  You can always reduce the water at the end anyway.  I wish there were more korean recipes on this website

Easy, and yummy.  I do add green pepper.  I also tossed the chicken on the grill after removing from the pot to crisp up the skin.

I was skeptical because this is so easy to make.  However, it was GREAT.  My husband and 2yr old son ate every last bite!  (Didn't add potatoes b/c I didn’t have any)

I thought the sauce has good balance so I wouldn't change it.  I made extra sauce because I was worried it wouldn't be enough to cover all the ingredients, but there were enough juices from the chicken that it wasn't needed.

I'm Korean, and this is pretty similar to what my mother makes. Generally I just start the whole pot at once, but my mom said I could throw in the carrots a little later to keep them colored. Also, careful not to make the sauce too watery, it's supposed to be a little thicker.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! Fantastic, as written.  (Non-Korean here, but love the cuisine). I used the gochujang, and it came out medium spicy, which was perfect for us.   I was worried when the liquid didn't cover the contents of the pot, so I used about 1 1/4 cups of water (i used more chicken as well). Will probably not add as much water next time, but I was very satisfied with the result this time.   Thanks again for sharing!

This is one the easiest recipe to do.  I modified the recipe by including one can of coke to make the flavor sweet and make the color dark. This was a tip from a Korean friend. Delicious!

I'm Korean and I made this for me & my sister tonight...We absolutely LOVED it!!!  I was worried that it wouldn't taste like my mom's/"authentic" Korean cooking (like many other recipes that I find online), but decided to try it after reading one of the other reviews and I'm so glad I did because this was right on!  I only added a little more red pepper paste since we like things extra spicy, but wouldn't change a thing otherwise.  Thank you so much for this recipe...I will definitely be making this again and again...probably for our next family gathering :).

Boil the chicken first for five minutes. Drain and add soy sauce, garlic and 1 tbsp on ginger. Then add your veggies and potatoes. I like to add leeks to this as well. I also like it super spicy so 3 tbsps of gochujang is never enough.

Loved it!  I used legs and thighs and then added some cut up chicken tenderloins about half way through for my husband (who is more of a boneless/skinless chicken person).  So good!  The next day I separated all the leftover chicken meat and used it along with some of the pan sauce to make a spicy fried rice.  Delicious!!

Don't laugh, but I teared up the first time I ate this because it tasted just like what I used to eat at my Halmoni's house. SHe always used drumettes,too. (Halmoni is what we call my grandmother even though I am only a 1/4 korean I was raised around my mother's side of the family). That said this recipe is five star perfect in my book! I made it for my lil sis when she came to see me and she kept thanking me for it, haha.

This really DOES taste the way my mom used to make it! When I made this, it reminded me of her and her cooking. I followed the recipe almost exactly. It helps that there are Korean stores around here, so it's easy to get Gochujang, the Korean chili pepper paste. I like garlic, so I added a couple more cloves, and because I'm paranoid about chicken not cooking all the way through, I let the pot boil for a bit longer before letting it simmer. I served it to a couple of friends, and they all enjoyed it. I don't think the dish is spicy with all 3 heaping spoonfuls of gochujang. One of my friends can't eat spicy things very well, and she didn't even notice. =) Thanks for the recipe! I'm keeping this one for sure!

Really good. Made this for my wife, a native Korean, last night and we both loved it. I used drumsticks and thighs, added a little extra pepper paste as well as two types of chopped hot peppers(dont remeber which kinds) instead of bell peppers and fried the chicken for about ten minutes as someone suggested. The sauce looked a little oily after adding the fried chicken but tasted good. Might try it without frying for comparison next time. I served it with rice, traditional kimchi, cucumber kimchi, and crisp lettuce leaves which we rolled the mixture in like Bulgoki. Goes really well with soju(korean style sake).I thought it was way too much food when I put it on the table but it was gone in a flash. My only great is I dont have any leftovers for lunch today. Thanks for the great recipe.

WONDERFUL! It was great! I didn't add the full amount of hot pepper paste becuase my family is not a spicy family and I used boneless chicken breasts instead. It really was great, I will make this again!

Great, fast, all-in-one-pot meal!  The sauce was perfect...just wanted MORE!  I may just double on the "gravy" next time!

This was the first Korean dish I've ever attempted - it was easy and really tasty and I made it just as the recipe stated.  Next time I'll add more red pepper paste to give it a bit more zing.  My friends and I loved it - will use the recipe again.

This was a really great recipe.  My husband has a limited range of acceptable tastes and he gave it a thumbs up!  I was unable to find hot pepper paste so I used a combination of 1/4 c. bbq sauce and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I used thighs and legs and less sodium soy sauce.  Thank you very much for such a great recipe.

This was easy and fun to make.  I added a stalk of celery and 1 red pepper.  I used baby carrots, sliced up fine.  I added 1 teaspoon of ginger and 2 1/2 tablespoons of sriracha.  The sriracha added a bit of chilie sweetness to the dish.  I am a big garlic lover so I upped the amount of garlic to 7 cloves.  I took LisainCalifornia's advice and stir fried the drummets before adding them to the pot.  It does make a big difference in taste.  Overall this is a great recipe, easy to make and goes great with rice.  My teenage boys both loved it -- they ate it all.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I made a variation using white onion chunks instead of green onion, chicken breast instead of drumettes, orange juice instead of soy sauce and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also had no hot pepper paste but it was still amazing.

Easy and delicious.  Just a few modifications:  I added 1 tbs sesame oil, 1 tsp rice vinegar, some sliced turnips and I used 1 tsp soy sauce only. Also, I used drumsticks and thighs and marinated for 2 hours and it was delicious and the meat was falling apart.

Soooooooooooooo Goooooooooooood !!!!!!   Amazingly easy and very flexible.  Used leftover shredded chicken & leftover quartered roasted potatoes.  Also added chopped celery, a bell pepper and 2 hungarian wax peppers (for a little heat since I don't have pepper paste and my husband isn't keen on really spicy stuff).  
Next time I'll increase the soy/water/sugar so I have more juice.  Will make again, and again, and again.....  Thank you Sarakyong !

I was looking for an easy & inexpensive way to feed ~40 hungry high schoolers.  This dish was PERFECT.  I used regular-size drumsticks & sauteéd them brown before simmering them with everything else.  I also only used ~1T minced garlic (from a jar), a handful of green onions, ~1T of gochujang and 1 full cup of water (not all kids like spicy, but they all like sauce).  The flavor was good & the chicken that fell off the bone, combined with all the stew-y bits at the bottom, was good enough to eat alone after we ran out of rice!  (note to self: next time make more rice to eat with the leftover sauce!)  I would totally make this again, for large or small groups.

Came out great - made it for company - kids ages 9 - 19.  The picky & adventuresome eaters both liked it - the grown-ups did too.  Mine wasn't as spicy as I expected, doubled it, maybe some proportions were off.  Used up most of my gochuchang though.  Used chicken thighs, cause that's what I had.  I especially liked that it was a relatively quick korean dish.

I am Korean, and I thought this recipe was great.  I followed it exactly, but doubled it for 5 lbs of meat.  My husband RAVED. I also gave some to my parents, and they also thought it was very good.  A truly authentic, and delicious Korean recipe.

The first time I made this, it was amazing! I used chicken breasts instead and as I live in Korea, I have access to all of the Korean ingredients. I made it for a Korean who loved it and asked me to make it again. I did and used chicken drumettes, but both of us found it to be nowhere near as good as with the breasts. Maybe I altered the recipe or maybe the chicken drumettes were not great quality, but I will stick to the breasts~in fact, I'm going to make it tonight and will let you know how it turns out!
***I definitely prefer the chicken breasts. I also added some red pepper powder (gochu garu), sliced red pepper (gochu) and some large green onions (pa). Delicious!!

This is my all-time favorite recipe! Its so simple yet so flavorful! Plus it satisfies my spicy craving. Ive made this countless times. I added a little MSG and lots of sesame seeds for more flavor! Its so juicy and spicy, yet the perfect amount of sweet, bcuz of the baby carrots and small amount of sugar.

I'm Korean & this dish did absolutely nothing for me. I thought the saltiness & the sweetness was total overkill. I'm only giving it one star because it didn't taste like the authentic dish, and I had to make substantial changes. Healthy cooking in mind, I made the following changes-- 1) reduced from 1/2 C. of regular soy to 1/3 C of low sodium soy; 2) bumped up the water to 1 cup; 3) I elimated the sugar altogether and sweetened with naturally sweet vegetables Beets (I know it wouldn't make it authentic, but beets are incredibly sweet & it adds a vibrant Red color to the sauce, and if you find the sweetness lacking, you can add splenda to taste), red peppers, and carrots; 4) I used Yams/ sweet potato in place of regular potato (the starch from the sweet potato has similar 'thickening' effects as regular potato); 5) since I like my food spicier than the average person, I added chopped jalepeno (membrane & seeds included). I served the dish with a mixture of basmati & wild brown rice. Packed the dish for lunch the next day, and it tasted even better.

My mom makes this all the time and it is SO good but like most Korean Moms, she never really had a "recipe" (i.e., measurements, precise instructions, etc.) So when i came across this, I was thirlled! It came out great (not as good as Mom's but isn't Mom's always the best?!)

I used red potatoes and added diced red peppers like another user suggested. I enjoyed eating the potatoes more than the chicken, my boyfriend loved it, but said it was almost as good as his mom makes. Maybe next time! :) I will try this again.

I made this recipe last night and it was a big hit!!  I grew up eating Korean food and this tasted very authentic. What I did differently was I used chicken breast cut up and I cut my veggies up smaller so it would cook faster.  Loved the chicken breast in it, plus it made the meal more lean.

I adapted this for a slow-cooker. I threw in all the veggies including a sweet potato, placed a whole chicken on top and then poured on the sauce with some extra water. I didn't have hot pepper paste so I used red pepper, chili powder and paprika. I cooked everything on high for four hours and it made good, flavorful meal.

Made this for dinner last night. Told my bf we were eating Korean and he didn't seem excited. Well, he took the left overs for lunch today. I used boneless chicken thighs (1 1/2 lbs)and Red Chili paste. I think next time I will try two tbps b/c it was a little hot for me and I really like spicy food. Also made the rice and the Korean Cucumber Salad from this site.  We really enjoyed it and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  Superb!  I can't get pepper paste at my grocery store so I used garlic chili sauce, approximately the same amount.  I did end up adding a little more sugar because I felt that it would improve the flavor, and it did.  I think I may have added more like 3-4 tbs.  Oh, also, I used chicken breast to make it lower in fat.

This is SO DELICIOUS!  I doubled up on the sauce and I also used a little bit of ground red pepper instead of the hot pepper paste.  It was amazing!

Hearty, almost stew-like quality.  Used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, 1 1/2 tablespoons of sambal-spicy hot garlic sauce, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/8 cup sugar and used chicken broth instead of water.  Thickened with a little cornstarch before serving over rice.  DH loved it.

I love Gochujang and was thrilled to find a recipe that uses it.  I usually just use it as a condiment. 
This is DELISH!!! I will definately repeat it on a regular basis! YUM!

Even though it's a pain, I think it is worth is to skin the drumsticks (also sold as wingettes in the grocery store).  marinates the chicken much more with the spicy soy infusion. I used yukon gold potatoes and they soaked up a lot of the juice as well!

Absolutely terrific---used skinned chicken drumsticks (don't like cooked skin unless it's crispy) but everything else as written.  Hubby loved it, I loved it, it was a hit!  Served over jasmine rice with some kim chee.  Will definitely make this again---thank you!!!

One of my all-time favorite meals - very comforting, very hearty. Some might think it is too spicy, so be prepared for some spice. I've had it three times already and every time it turned out great. If you would prefer to use chicken breast, like I did, make sure the chicken is cut into drumette-size pieces so it will cook through. I also substitute the korean pepper paste for sriracha since that's what I have on hand. It turns out just as amazing.

This recipe was super easy to make! Even for a university student like me with very limited cooking skills. and patience. I actually made it with chicken breast (because it was on sale :p) and flavored with a tsp of chicken stock powder. Maybe it's because of the chicken stock that it came out way too salty. My only other complaint about it was that the chicken turned out to be too dry. Maybe I cooked it for too long? Not sure the reason, or even if it was because of the recipe or something I did. Either way, awesome tasting recipe, super convenient and easy to make, and I definitely love how it can last for numerous meals- saves even more time since I can just heat it up with some rice. Next time I'll definitely put in more hot pepper paste. Thanks so much for sharing this!

This was very tasty and reminds me of my grandma's cooking back in the old country!  I used a whole fryer chicken cut up into pieces and browned them in a splash of sesame oil.  I also doubled the sauce using low sodium soy sauce.  I have made this several times now and it just gets better each time!  Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband loved this!  The smell this dish gave off while it was simmering was divine.  I did add some more water to make it a little more soupy and more hot pepper paste to make it spicier, which it did not need (the paste).  I used semi-thawed chicken breasts and cubed them into bite sized pieces, served it over brown rice.  Delicious and oh so easy to prepare.

this was delicious!  i live in korea and have had this dish many times.  all my korean friends, especially my boyfriend, were surprised that i was able to make this!  i didn't add the sugar...but otherwise, i followed the recipe except i added more water.  one tip, don't add extra liquid because you don't think there is enough- as it simmers, the chicken produces a lot of juice.

Very delicious Recipe.  I used big ol drum sticks and ended up having to double the liquids just so it could reach the top of the pot to cook everything in there.so i had about just under a cup of water and 3/4 cup low sodium soy sauce  Other than that though everything came out great.

I just made this pretty much per the directions except I used some Sriracha hot chili sauce instead of the Korean paste and I also sprinkled Luzianne canjun seasoning on the dish a couple times to make sure it was good and spicy.  Turned out great served over white rice.

This was excellent and my first attempt at Korean food.  I love the Korean spicy chicken at a local restaraunt and this was similar.  I  cut up boneless skinless breasts since I always have those on hand and added water chestnuts and red bell pepper a couple times.  I don't know if this is the right sauce but I've been using "Ground Fresh Chili Paste" from the grocery store ethnic food section and have no complaints. I've made this four times now and it's become my favorite recipe and really quite easy. I can start the rice and chicken at the same time and pretty much just sit back, relax, enjoy a glass of wine and in 45 minutes, voila!

It was fantastic!!! I doubled the hot pepper paste. I would not recommend such things to someone who does not like spicy cuisine. Good luck with your version! :) It tastes even better the next day when the flavors have had the chance to mix.

A pretty good chicken dish except that it could be a LOT more spicier otherwise the sauce itself is not bad at all

I used boneless chicken thigh pieces and it turned out very tender. I used a mix of chicken stock and water to cook the chicken for a bit in the beginning. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. At the end, added a handful of chopped green onions. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty. Not sure if theres a big difference between chili paste and hot pepper paste but i used chili paste because thats what i had. I like to simmer my chicken in the broth for quit a while so i dont add my potatoes, and carrots until the last 30 mins or so of the simmering process. This is a keeper!

Yum! Really easy to make and tasty! My chicken came out a bit dry but I think it's because i didn't use drumsticks... I also added 1 Tbs mirin (cooking wine).

This recipe was really good. However, I added some cabbage and some green peppers close to the end. I don't think I will be using carrots again though. It made it feel too much like a stew.

MMMMM...just had this for dinner and it was fantastic! I got off work late today and needed to throw dinner together FAST. i threw this together in no time. i adjusted a few things: reduced sugar to 1 TBS, used low sodium soy sauce, added bell peppers, cracked black pepper, and a few dashes of red chili flakes because we like it spicy. my husband loved it. thanks for a great recipe!! =)

I just made this for dinner. I thought it was a bit bland. Not much flavor. I may give it another try, but can someone recommend what type of hot pepper paste would be best for this??? I also didn't add potatoes as I didn't have any, but I'll be sure to if I make it again.

I used 4 skinned chicken thighs (bone in) with the recipe amts for the veges and this was just right for 2.  Added one green bell pepper (because I needed to use one up). The only comment I would make would be sure to use the right seasoning as stated in the recipe. I used a combo of tsps of hot chili oil and sweet Chile sauce - next time I'll  use the Tbsp.  Good recipe for the winter months.  Thanks.

Very easy and good.  Used boneless skinless chicken thighs and only 1/3 cup soy sauce as mentioned.  Used Chipotle paste.  Mixed all sauce ingredients in a cup and poured over the chicken.  Will make again when in need of a simple meal - thanks!!

Sooo easy to make, yet so tasty. Did not have Korean hot pepper paste, so I used Indonesian chilli sauce. Nice and spicy, but not overpoweringly so. Made extra sauce so my kids can have them spooned over their rice. Thank you for posting.

In Australia Korean Red pepper paste is available in Woolworths  in the Asian section and I guess most big supermarkets and of course in Asian food stores.

I have been making Tak Torytang since my first assignment in Korea in 1987.   I lived there for three years in KOrean homes.  I do it a little different.  I do not use gochuchang (red pepper paste).  I use gochucuddu (red pepper flakes).  Gochuchang has vinegar in it so it is not pure pepper paste.    I also add mushrooms and green onions.   I never add water.   NEVER!   But sometimes I do add red wine, white wine, or a good strong beer.

Very authentic base recipe.   As with most things though, everyone has their own version, I did this with 5 lbs of skinless thighs so I doubled the recipe, added some green onions, ginger and a half dozen quartered jalapenos (I like it spicy).

Commonly referred to simply as "Hot Chicken" this dish is a 2AM (or later) favorite of many USAF personnel at Osan AB in Korea where I was first introduced to it (A restaurant named Mama's Kitchen).  This brought back many fond memories and will definitely be a frequent addition to the menu in my kitchen.

Thank you!

The only switches I made to this recipe were that I used full sized drumsticks, used 1/3 cup soy sauce, and cut the gochu jang (did I spell that right?) down to two tablespoons to make it a little more kid friendly. It was a huge hit with everyone from my husband down to my two year old!

Yummy!  My family likes Asian food, but on the mild side.  (When we go to an Indian restaurant, we order it mild.)  With this in mind, I used only 1 Tbsp. of the  gochujang.  I also used only 1/4 cup of soy sauce.

I absolutely love gojuchang so when I saw this recipe I knew I had to give it a try. Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe except for substituting 2lb boneless chicken thighs (4) for the drumettes & browning the thighs while chopping up the veggies & making the sauce. Trust the recipe, there's definitely enough sauce that combines with the chicken juices as it cooks to make a gravy.  Next time I'll probably double the sauce (husb is a gravy guy!) and add more thighs and veggies. This is the first time I've had tak toritang. It was nice seeing so many positive reviews indicating that this recipe is like "what mom makes".  A keeper!

As a Korean American, I don't know how to make a lot of Korean dishes; I just never took the time to learn. This, however, tastes much like (maybe even better...sorry mom!) than what I grew up eating. My husband (not Asian) loved it as well! I cut back the soy sauce to 1/3 cup (used low sodium). I used more like 4 tbsp gochujang and kept everything the same. I used a combination of skinless boneless chicken thighs and drumsticks. Perfect!

This is my husband's favorite meal. I have made it a few times but last night followed the recipe and put it in the pressure cooker. He was underwhelmed. It wasn't spicy enough. I usually leave out most of the sugar. I will do this from now on and serve with greens and Johnny cakes instead of rice.

I really likes this recipe and thought it was tasty! I substituted chicken breasts since that is what I already had available.  I also added more gochujang.  Delish!

Used all the tips: combined chicken breast with drumettes; added ginger, bell pepper and spring onions and reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Otherwise used the recipe as is with one change--used a slow cooker. Marriage made in heaven :-)

I made it with a substitute for the Korean spicy paste, using red pepper flakes, soy sauce and sugar.

Very simple meal to make. My family and I loved it. The only change I may make next time is reducing the soy sauce to 1/3 cup or even 1/4 cup.

Made this multiple times and is always a hit with friends.  So simple and very easy to adapt to your taste.  I used chicken thighs, added cabbage to sweeten the sauce naturally, and just added a tiny bit of sugar or agave syrup to taste. I've also made this spicy and not spicy...both coming out great.  So easy to adjust to your taste buds and it still comes out delish!

I made this last night, with regular drumsticks instead of drumettes, and it was delicious. It was also incredibly simple to make. I might use a little less sugar in the future, though, and I'm glad the original contributor added the note about heaping the tbsps. of the gochujang, because I do like spiciness. At the risk of losing the authenticity of the recipe, I'm thinking that adding other root vegetables along with the carrots might be good, and maybe even throwing in some other vegetables toward the end, such as chunked zucchini or yellow squash. (Someone here also suggested green peppers.) In other words, this is a beautifully flavorful, easy-to-make, and versatile comfort food. Thank you, sarakyong, for sharing the recipe.

Delicious! Super simple! I followed the recipe for the most part: chix was 1/2 chicken tenders, 1/2 mini drumsticks. Added 1c water, and two scoops of coarse red chili powder. Very spicy, long simmer to make the broth thicken. Served with sticky rice.

Chicken thighs went bad so had no choice but to use chicken breast. Cooked it all in the slow cooker. Turned out really good. Almost like a Asian style pot roast using chicken.

Very good and very easy. I used bone-in thighs but pulled off the skin. Used russet potatoes to soak up the sauce. In my braising pan it created much more liquid than I expected, so I reduced at the end and thickened with cornstarch. I cooked it longer so the thighs were coming off the bone and tender. Oh, and tossed in an aging bell pepper. Makes terrific leftovers, too!

All I had was Chicken breast and it turned out wonderful...next time maybe I'll throw in some thighs.  I used red pepper paste as I know that's what my Mother in-law uses, not gochujang.

Good recipe - thank you for posting. I used thigh meat and added two teaspoons of fresh ginger, I also added 2 chopped pieces of celery for an extra texture and skipped the white sugar by adding just 1 tablespoon of raw sugar. I also skipped the hot pepper paste but did add crushed red pepper. Looking forward to having it again!

Yummy!  I used chicken breast instead of the drummettes to decrease the fat content.  I used red potatoes, zuchinni and a green pepper in addition to the other veggies.  My non Korean husband loved it!

I didn't have all of the ingredients so had to substitute garlic powder for actual garlic, and some liquid habenero sauce instead. Was spicy this way but not too bad. Both hubby and I really enjoyed it! Will skip the potatoes and serve over rice next time!

My mom has always called this "Chicken Chim". I'm half Korean and this is a favorite of our family. I wanted to try this so that I wouldn't have to call my mom anymore to ask her to make it so we can come over and eat for dinner. lol. Thats pretty sad huh? My mom adds zucchini squash also to this and uses sesame oil (about a swirl of it in the pot)and sesame seeds. But She doesnt use the gochujang she just uses the same red pepper flakes used in making kim-chi. My sister and I like it made with more vegetables than meat but she does uses chicken breast or drumsticks depending on what she has. The recipe was good. (That says alot because nothing is ever as good as my mom's)You can always play with the main ingredients though. It's very hard to write recipes for korean dishes because they never measure things out. Thanks for the recipe.

I absolutely loved this dish.  I did add about 1 cup more water because I love sauce over my rice.  This was very spicy which my boyfriend and I absolutley love.  To make this even healthier I used bone in legs and removed the skin.  The bone in keeps the meat moist and delicious.  I also added a few extra garlic cloves.  This is a keeper.

WOW...  My mouth is still tingling from this...  but it's probably my fault since I had to sub chinese hot sauce for the hot chili paste.  May have changed the flavor, but as this is my first experience with Korean recipes, I didn't miss anything.  Also used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had.  Very tasty, flavorful, and spicy.  Husband said this is his favorite thing I have made off this site so far!

I liked it. Alittle too spicy but I enjoyed it. I tripled everything but the red pepper paste and it was still VERY spicy. But I liked it.

this was extremely delicious. i put red thai curry paste instead of the pepper paste and i added a little bit of fish sauce because I thought it lacked a tiny bit of flavor...but after that, it was extremely delicious! thank you for sharing! this is definitely a keeper!

I made this for dinner last night, and I have to admit that despite the reviews, I really didn't expect much, but boy, was I mistaken.  This is quite flavorful and very filling.  Next time I try this, I will slice my onions instead of chop them, add some sliced red and green bell pepper and I even thought about adding some peanuts too (however that might be a little more than necessary).  All this to say that this is a very good recipe.

Excellent option for any type of chicken or pork. Not just wings and drummettes. We also add habanero peppers to make it really spicy. The Szechuan Hot Pepper Paste is what we use - hot, but not terribly spicy. The habanero kicks it up a notch. Love this dish...it's graduated to a monthly feature. Thank you!

I enjoyed this a lot.  My boyfriend decided to put a sweet potato in instead of a regular potato, so the potato didn't really taste so good (sweet and spicy at the same time).  However, the only thing I was surprised about was the lack of sauce.  I was expecting a lot of sauce for the chicken and vegetables to simmer in, but that didn't happen.  However, everything else turned out great.

I found this to be a very basic stew like meal. Even though there was some hot pepper paste, I found the rest of the flavors a bit bland. I wasn't so crazy about it, but my husband ate it up.

We didn't care for this.  Something just was not quite right about the taste but we could not put our finger on it.  I doubt that I will make it again.  Sorry!

You don't need rice with this.  The potatoes are starchy enough.

Was pretty good, though I tried it with frozen chicken tenders.  I'd try it with real chicken next time.

Made it for dinner this evening and while it had a pleasant taste it is not a recipe I would make again but I would recommend everyone try it once.
