Tasty; I did make a few slight changes due to lack of ingredients and a low tolerance for spice! but I liked the fresh pico de gallo topping as an accent to the cooked chicken & quinoa. I will probably make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a good lite dinner or a nice full lunch.  I used a prepared fresh salsa from our grocery store but kept everything else the same.  Super healthy, filling and tasty!  The recipe made 5 bowls (filled halfway).   Will make this one again!  Thank you!

A bit like a cross between Spanish rice and chicken chili but with healthy quinoa.
I did use a jalape√±o in my salsa. I also served this with some guacamole and sour cream. Delicious
