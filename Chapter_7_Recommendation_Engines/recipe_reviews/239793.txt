I made these for a barbecue I am going to and wanted a dessert I could eat, since I am diabetic and on a high fat low carb diet. I did use the 1/2 c. Almond flour but also added 1/2 c. Coconut flour as well since many said the crust was oily.  I also added - little almond extract to the crust and baked the crust for about 5 or 6 minutes which made the crust more like an almond coconut shortbread.  I also added more almond extract to the filling. After they were baked I made a small hole in top and added a small dollop of red raspberry fruit spread.  They were absolutely delicious!

These are really phenomenal. I used Swerve as the sweetener and I added maybe a 1/4 cup of sour cream and they really tasted like "real" cheesecake.

Ok so I was trying the recipe and mistakenly ran into the best tasting keto "cheesecake".  So I halved everything since it was only me that was going to be eating this but I didn't read the directions carefully and ended up mixing the almond flour and butter into the recipe.   So instead of having a cheesecake crust I just had this concoction.  I decided to cook it anyway for 30 minutes then let it cool in the fridge overnight.  Tried it today and it was soooo good!  For my sugar substitute I used Truvia which  has erythritol as the main ingredient.  So if you didn't read directions well (like me) never fear, it  may still come out delicious.

for the crust i used 3 tbsp butter and added 1/2 tbsp coconut flour and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Gently pressing on crust to spread evenly. Baked in preheated oven for 6-7 min. Then firmly pressed down on crust for a great crust texture! I absolutely loved this recipe! Thank you!!

I did what others suggested and used only 1/8 cup butter and 1/2 cup sweetener. These do seem to be the correct portions to use. I did not care for the almond meal crust. I think next time I will try flaxmeal, which is lower in carbs and may get that crumbly texture better. The cheese cake itself also seemed a bit... off. I think I may be more used to  New York style. Next time I'll try adding a 1/4 cup sour cream.

I just made these for my birthday! I used lemon extract instead of vanilla. I used the full butter amount but the key that is missing is baking the crust first without the filling for 5-6 minutes. I did this and the crust came  out like a graham cracker crust of a regular cheesecake!
  I also used 1/2 cup of sweetener which was the perfect amount of sweet. I found these to be a light fluffy cheesecake not so much dense like regular cheese cake.
 
 I will definitely make these again real soon!!!

This is a great starting point! I’d cut back on butter for crust add a dash of cinnamon and Swerve. I also added a bit of sour cream and lemon juice to the filling. Used confectioners Swerve instead of granulated. Very tasty!!

Made this the first time as prescribed. Crust was way too greasy but the taste was otherwise pretty good. This time I cut the butter half as others suggested and added 2 tablespoons of splenda to the crust. Also upped the splenda in the batter by 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream straight to the batter.  Amazing!

We infused the butter for the crust with cardemom and I used orange extract instead of vanilla for the filling. My husband who is on the keto diet was eating the filling straight out of the bowl and telling me he didn't need me to cook it or add crust! 

Note: I used stevia in the exact proportions listed and there were no complaints. Splenda tends to be too sweet and stevia is better for baking in my experience. 

4 stars because this called for splenda which would not have worked (as seen by other reviews too) and I found that there was maybe 1/4-1/3 too little crust to really coat the bottom of each cupcake liner. There was exactly the right amount of cream cheese filling though.

Less splenda, only used 1/2 cup. Also added just a 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar to the crust bottom. They are very good and a perfect treat from my husband on a keto diet.

It needs a little more almond meal for the crust, it was a little runny. I also added almond extract to it besides the vanilla. It was amazing. My girlfriend loved them.

I halved the recipe and subbed 1/2 t of liquid Stevia since I didn’t have granular. I also added the juice of a half a lime. Considering how low carb these are, they are very good!  I think I’ll make them again full recipe and a little more Stevia. I’m always afraid of adding too much. Less is definitely more!

This was a very welcome treat! Subbed ground flaxseed for almonds, since that's what I had in the pantry. I used stevia packets, and added a couple tablespoons of honey just to cut the "off" taste that I find stevia has in large quantities. My kids just devoured them, and asked me to make these all the time. :) 
Also, stick a couple in the freezer when they come out, if you want a treat right away!

These are perfect! The only modifications I made were to the crust. I used about 1/2 the recommended butter in melted state. And then I sprinkled a bit of coconut flower on top of each crust. Baked crust for 5 min as recommended by another reviewer prior to filling with cheesecake mix. I got more than 12 cups, more like 15.  I used erythritol for my sweetner. Love it!

Very good! Needed a few tweaks though. Reduced butter in crust and added some cinnamon and swerve. For the filling I added half cup of sour cream and fresh lemon juice for the win! I also added blueberries to a few of them and they were excellent!

This was my first attempt at both a cheesecake and a Keto dessert (my husband just started it). He said it was amazing, and makes the diet bearable for his sweet tooth. The portion control (in muffin cups) is a good idea too. The only change I made was to bake the "crusts" first for about 5 minutes. Gonna keep 'em coming!

I make these for my husband and it's a great go to snack/dessert for him.  I've found, in making them several times, that I've chosen to add a little coconut flour to the almond flour to help the "crust" to be more adhesive.  Also, since he doesn't care much for the taste of stevia, I mix about half stevia with half erythritol.  He loves them!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Amazing! I've had a sweet tooth since starting the keto diet & this hits the spot. I used almond flour instead of the meal & after putting in the "crust" I put it in the oven for about 2-3 min.

It's delicious!!
Made it as a WHOLE CHEESECAKE.
I
For the crust I used a whole cup of butter and exchanged the almond meal for coconut flour, cooked it for a few minutes in the oven before putting on top the cheese mixture to which I added a whole egg, the zest of two lemons and the juice of one lemon.

Great!!

OMG..I've always make these for the holidays but the old way with real sugar and cherry filling but let me tell you, they taste exactly the same and I haven't even put any topping on them. the crust comes out like a light cookie,  very similar to the vanilla wafer Im use too. I only had 1/2 cup of stevia, and I added a tablespoon of lemon juice. If you like cheese cake you'll love these.

Made these for my older brother and myself for Easter and he LOVED them. He wants me to make them for his workers who are on Atkins. I omitted the almond meal. Just made the cheesecake.

I made a few needed changes. I added a packet of Splenda to the crust (which I made out of equal parts of almond AND coconut flour). I used 2/3 c of Splenda in the filling and it was still very sweet. I hollowed out the middle (after baking) and filled each with a tsp (or two) of puréed strawberries and Splenda (heated over medium for 5 mins to thicken)

For being low carb and low sugar they were very good! I used half artificial sweetner and half white sugar because I think too much sweetner tastes weird. The "crust" was rather greasy once cooked so I would suggest using less butter. I shared these with coworkers and everyone enjoyed them!

AWESOME SAUCE!   I doubled this receipe and it was a HUGE HIT at my summer BBQ.   I did make a few additions:  To the crust, I added some swerve sweetener and ground cinnamon, everyone raved about the crust and didn't now it was almond flour.  I also added a little lemon juice to the batter, and topped them with Sugar Free canned cherries.  I used the liners and they were adorable.   Took longer to bake with liners, I think I added an extra 10 minutes.   Will be making these again for the holidays!!

My husband was so thankful for these after ten days of his keto diet.  I doubled the recipe and made them in 48 mini bite-size muffins (with enough left over for two small individual cakes in small ramekins). Per another reviewers advice, I added nearly an equal amount of coconut flour to the crust, along with a generous pinch of Splenda and a teaspoon of extract for more flavor, and baked the crusts for 5 minutes first.  They came out great, and I set a bowl of sugar free cherry pie filling next to the cheesecake bites for those who wanted something on top. Pretty!

This is the most delicious recipe ever!  I wouldn't be able to stay on the Keto Diet with out it.   I've made this twice  &  the only thing I did different on the 2nd time  was cook the crust for about 5 mins. &  let cool before putting in the cheesecake mixture. It gave the crust a little crunch.   Absolutely Amazing!!!

Excellent!  I have tried a couple of other keto mini cheesecake recipes but this one is the best so far. It’s not a graham cracker crust but it’s a fair alternative. I agree with the reviewer‘s who said maybe a quarter cup of sour cream would improve the recipe even. It’s just a tad bit sweet for me.

Holy moly!!!!!!!!!! Yes gawd! I added almond extract in addition to the vanilla, and ran out of stevia, so used 1/4c white sugar, and 1/4 stevia xiltol mix  to get my 1/2c instead of 3/4... Wait I almost forgot, I also added the .5tsp of brown sugar to the" crust". Man its good... Next time I'm making it just as the recipe states. I'd like to get an idea of what its like without adding white sugar.

I made these for a work friend's birthday.  Everyone loved them!  Super easy except for maybe the crust portion.  The butter and almond flour made a paste and it was difficult to spread into the cupcake liners.  My co-workers who are trying to eat low carb all loved them.

I've been trying to find new low carb recipes, especially dessert recipes because I do have a sweet tooth! This recipe is one of the best I've tried, that being said, it's obviously not the same as a real sugar dessert. It does have that grainy  mouth feel that most low carb desserts I've tried do, but it satisfies the craving!

I did make a change as others have recommended. I added about 1/4 cup Coconut flour to the crust (otherwise it's too greasy) and then baked it for about 15 minutes. I also added a few blueberries to the batter which made a nice tart burst every few bites without adding many carbs.

I made this as a cheesecake I added 1 tablespoon of sucralose and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the crust. 3/4 cup of sour cream and a dash of salt to the mix. I bake for 20 minutes only and allowed it to cool for 20 minutes and refrigerated overnight uncovered. ( no open onions or seafood in the refrigerator or it will take on that taste and odor)

Excellent recipe! Happy to see keto recipe here. I’m going to be one of those people who made a few changes, sorry! I used a keto shortbread recipe for the crust. Baked it 9 minutes before filling the them with the cream cheese mixture. As suggested by others I did add a spoon or two of sour cream. I also used powdered Swerve for my sweetener and a bit of coconut flour to make cream cheese more thick and creamy. They turned out so silky and creamy and delicious. I added blueberries to the top. I will definitely be making these again. 
Hope to see more keto recipes on allrecipes.com!

These were very good!! I added some cinnamon to the crust, and it tasted EXACTLY like sopapilla cheesecake!! The only thing I would change is to use slightly less Splenda/sweetener, they were super sweet. Also, I would make a little more crust than it calls for next time, I had way more batter than I had crust for. It makes more than 12.

The cheesecake part was awesome.  The crust had way too much butter and was very oily.  I will happily make again and omit the crust altogether.

These turned out amazing! Very similar to the real thing, not a “Frankenstein” version. The only change I made was in using Enrythritol vs Splenda.

Baked the almond flour and butter (3 tablespoons) for 7 mins on 360. I substituted a second 8 ounce container of cream cheese for 1/3 cup chia seeds and 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (let it set in fridge). Also added 1/4 cup sour cream and used cake batter extract too. Soooooo good and only 2 net carbs per! I sprayed a silicone muffin tin and they came out fine after.

I love cheesecake,  but I'm trying to cut out as much sugar as I can from my diet. So when I found this recipe I was a little excited to make it. I made them for my bartender at work for her birthday last year and now I have to make them at least once a month for us at work.  The only thing I changed was I added a little dash of cinnamon.

Used unsweetened coconut flour in place of the almond meal, which was available at the time and xylitol for the sweetness. This is a great alternative to my all time old time favorite cheesecake. I offered some to my sister and family and they loved them. They almost ate the entire dozen that I made. I will definitely make these again. This is on my list for holiday desserts too.

They tasted just like cheesecake I remembered with the exception of the crust, which I didn't care for since I don't care for almond or coconut flour.

Great!!! Changed the recipe according to some of the reviews by adding a tablespoon of almond flour, vanilla extract and sweetener to the ground almonds. I added a little lemon juice to the filling.

So my friend at work brought these since we are all on Keto. They were amazing! I tried to make them myself today and the only thing I might say is decrease your butter for the almond flour because the crust seems oily. Other than that they were good. I used Pure stevia and will go a little lighter than recommend next tome on that too. Maybe a half a cup instead of 3/4 of a cup. But overall great!

Oh my goodness! So delicious, and so easy to make!! My husband does Keto, I’m Weight Watchers.  These are a splurge for me, but so worth every point! I used Swerve for the sweetener, I also added 1/2 T. of Swerve to the crust mix and baked it alone for about 7 minutes before adding the filling and baking 15 - 17 minutes more. Delicious!! Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!!

I added some lemon zest and they turned out pretty good. I will change the amount of butter used by half next time as they were too oily. I baked them for 18 minutes but they could have gone for a couple more. Over all, a wonderful treat that I will be making all of the time!!!

For the crust I upped to 1cup of almond flour and baked alone in cups for 5 minutes per other reviews. The rest I made exactly as written using splenda for my sweetner. THESE ARE PHENOMENAL!!! Bravo!!! I'd eat these even off the keto diet! A hit with family and friends!! MAKE THEM!!

The cheesecake batter was terrific; however, I'm allergic to all nuts (including almonds) so what can I substitute to make the bottom crust?  I tried coconut flour with the butter but that didn't work out well at all.

Followed the recipe exactly but used coconut palm sugar for the sweetener and added a bit of cocoa to the filling to make these chocolate cheesecake. They came out divine!! My only thought is that I would want more for the crusts -- there was barely enough to cover the bottoms of 12 cupcake liners. I will be making these again and doing 1.5 x the crust amounts. Yummmm!!!

Oh, these are sooooo good. They taste like the real thing, and since they are keto, they don't spike my blood sugars. I kept a few in the fridge and froze the rest. Also, these are great when my co-workers are bringing in donuts on Donut Thursdays, so I can enjoy a cheesecake cupcake without feeling I'm missing out.

Very good desert but came out slightly dry. Next time will add slightly more sweetener and will shorten cook time from 17 to 16 min.  But WILL be making again!! Thanks for the keto friendly dish!

Very tasty!  I did find that the 'crust' wasn't quite enough for 12 cupcakes so I had to make just a tad more.  Batter was simply divine.  Came out well but they stick to the paper a lot.

I loved the portion size of these cheesecakes. My husband found the flavor a little bland for his liming, so next time i may place around with some flavoring.

I am cooling them now but when they came out of the oven, they looked great, nice a rounded and full.  Taking them out to cool before putting into refrigerator, I went back to them after about 10 min and they had all fallen, concave, into the cupcake holder.  Have not tried them but very disappointed on the great looking out of the oven and the bad looking cooling cupcakes!

I will never use another recipe! I prefer the individual cheesecakes since covering a springform pan with foil and placing it in a water bath plus the almost assured cracks that result is a bit more labor intensive with less payoff in my opinion.  It is essential to bake the crust for 5 minutes or so prior to filling. That will prevent the greasy crust mentioned in prior reviews. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and used Splenda brown sugar in my filling. Absolutely delicious! I can't wait to try lemon extract and zest... same for lime. Maybe low/no sugar strawberry jam swirled in, or add semisweet chocolate chips. Almond extract and some chopped almonds on top. The possibilities are endless!

I made this recipe yesterday - I used some lemon juice and doubled the vanilla.  Bake your crusts for five minutes before adding the topping and they will have a nicer texture.  These were "ok" yesterday. After sitting overnight, they were good, but are still missing something, so I will try the almond extract or berry compote next time.

These were delicious, easy to make and cooked in a short period of time.   The crust was superb. 
I did not have almond meal but had whole unsalted almonds. I put them in my miniblender and pulsed them until crumbs (it is recommended not to pulse too long or it can become almond oil)

I made the crust with flaxseed meal and used a little less butter, adding swerve.  Also baked the crust for five minutes.  I only used 2/3 of the swerve for the filling and added two tbsp of sour cream.  Great texture.  Topped with blackberry compote.

It has a great texture similar to traditional cheesecake. I added a little almond extract. We did not cake for the flavor of the crust. The overall taste was better than okay but the crust has a good texture but not a good flavor. I will be making this again. I am going to try to put an all fruit spread on top and see if that helps and looking for alternatives to the crust.

I used 3/4 of  a cup of Truvia instead of Splenda  because that is what I had. I think I will decrease it to a 1/2 cup because it was plenty sweet.  I loved this recipe and I plan on making it again!

They're pretty good.  I added 1/4 cup sour cream and cut back the sweetener to 1/2 cup as others suggested.  I might add more sour cream next time for more of a kick.  For the crust, I mashed up 4 Fat Snax low carb ginger tumeric cookies and mixed with about 2 tbsp melted butter.  It made just enough for 1 tbsp of crust per cupcake which I spooned in and flattened with a shot glass. Worked great.

Great Cheese Cake Recipe. I suggest that you only put 2 tablespoons of butter into the crust, so it's more crumbly, and bake it for 5 to 7 minutes, and then add the cheese cake mix on top. I baked mine for 20 minutes in a water bath, and it came out clean and yummy :) Thank you for the recipe!

I was out of almond flour so I used coconut flour instead.  Probably a mistake.  I also put three whole pecans on top of the crust before i added the filling - that was great!  I cut back on the sweetener by 1/4 cup and it was just right

I haven't made these - yet - but a co-worker brought them in.  OMG delicious!  The crust is a bit crumbly, but the incredible cheesecake part makes up for it.  I will be making these soon.

I tweeked it just a little bit... No crust for me... Added carbs just isn't worth it, but I did add a teaspoon of lemon juice, a tsp of coconut oil, and 3 tsp of sour cream... I used 1/4 pyure as my sweetener, and it was just divine ...  It came out 1/2in flat but tastee! The next time I will be adding another 8oz of cream cheese for added thickness...

I used low fat cream cheese, almond flour and only 1/2 cup Stevia. So not really sweet and texture more like a cake...wonderful. Left out cinnamon. For sweeter tooth added melted salted Carmel or preserves...

I substituted Splenda for Xylitol, used egg whites, and sprinkled carb chips at the 10 minute mark. These were a nice sweet treat!  I will make them again.

Absolutely divine!  I wanted something sweet for Christmas and I made these and I can't believe that I was eating them and they weren't bad for me!
I did change up the recipe somewhat, my husband is allergic to nuts so for the base I used 1/4 cup of coconut flour, 1/2 tsp of guar gum to bind, and I ended up using a little more butter as the flour sucks up moisture.  The change I made with the actually cheese mixture was to double the vanilla and use 3 pipettes of liquid stevia.  It's essential to taste as I found with the original measurements the bitterness of the cheese really came through and it wasn't too sweet once cooked as I can't do super sweet. Thanks for the recipe, it's a gem!

I eat this everynight as my dessert.  I save a few carbs and skip the crust.  I also use 1 cup of spenda instead if 3/4.  Yummo.
