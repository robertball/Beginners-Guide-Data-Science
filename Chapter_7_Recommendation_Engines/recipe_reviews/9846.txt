I used 1 1/5 cups of sugar, evaporated milk and 4 tablespoons of peanut butter.  The trick is you need to boil for 2 1/2 minutes or they will not set up.  I have been so frustrated trying to get it right, but this will work for you!

I used evaporated milk, creamy peanut butter and the extra teaspoon of vanilla another reviewer suggested and these turned out to be the creamiest best version of this no-bake cookie I've tried.  I always forget the proportions for this old recipe and will definitely be using this one in my 'used often' staple of recipes. Thanks!

We love these, and they're so quick and easy. Bring the pot to a full, rolling boil (the whole surface is covered with bubbles) before you start the timer. Once you add the oats and peanut butter, keep stirring until it cools enough to get sticky and thick.

This recipe made the cookies just like my grandma used to!  I found that I needed to boil the ingredient for around 2 minutes to get them to dry just right on the wax paper.  I also found that dissolving the sugar in the milk before adding the other ingredients made the consistancy a bit better.

Tastes great. I'm not sure if i did something wrong but they didn't harden up quite like I would have liked. My second batch i boiled a little bit longer (probably more like 3-5 mintues) and they are in the fridge right now cooling. Is anyone else having this problem? If not, what did I do wrong? Like I said, Taste great thought!

My favorite cookie recipe.  I 1st made these in Preschool mover 30 years ago, and had the original recipe sheet until moving, then searched for this one.  If you are having difficulty getting these cookies to set up, the quick oats work much better.  By design, these oats make thicker, faster oatmeal, which will be replicated in the cookies.

With a peanut allergy in the family, I substitute an equal amount of freshly ground almond butter.  It seems to give the cookies a bit more substance and is less sweet.  I never thought I could improve on this recipe, but the almond butter is an even bigger hit!

Oh my goodness these are good!  I know them from my past as "Dogfood Cookies".  I got the craving for them, and I'm so glad I picked this recipe.  I used the quick cooking oats as other reviewers had suggested.  I also boiled the mixture for a little over two minutes, as opposed to the 1.5 minutes suggested in the recipe.  The cookies are very soft, but did still set up without a problem.  I'll make these again and again!  Thanks for bringing back wonderful childhood memories!

Very good texture-not too runny or too dry. No- bakes are a little too sweet for me-but everyone here loved them. To some, I added dried cherries. The grown-ups liked the added chewiness and flavor.

Perfect. I added a few more oats because I like them a little thicker and I subbed dark cocoa powder. Yum.

My family has been making this recipe for years with great results. I have made some small changes, which result in richer, better cookies. First, I change the proportions to 1/2 cup of everything except sugar and oats. It makes them chocolatey and delicious. The chocolate mixture should be boiled for 3 minutes, and then removed from heat. Then, the peanut butter is stirred in, along with the vanilla and then the oats.  Great recipe

I also had the problem with the cookies not hardening up as they were supposed to.  I scraped them off the waxed paper and microwaved them for a minute and they were better.  Next time I'll boil them longer.  The taste is delicious...yummy.

These are what I used to make when I was a child. I did cut the sugar down to 1-1 1/2 cups as 2 cups was way too much. I also used 4-5 TBSP of creamy peanut butter to give it more of a fudge texture. I did let it boil 3 minutes and they set wonderfully. All around wonderful cookie you can tweak any way you want.

I like this recipe because it uses rolled oats instead of the minute oats, which cuts down on the beneficial nutritional value. I used Splenda-sugar mixture that you can bake with to cut down on calories, it's a great product. Next time however I will add more peanut butter.

My mom has made this recipe forever. I suggest more moms make this recipe. Careful with the amount of oatmeal. Use creamy peanut butter. cook when kids are not home. Enjoy one for yourself first. Drink milk.

My favorite recipe to make when I was a girl.  My recipe used 1/2 c. creamy peanut butter and 1/4 c. cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and my kids liked that better. We microwave the ingredients.   My 9 yo daughter is now the one who makes these!

Well, I tried to " boil but not stir " , And I could see it wasn't going to be a good 1st try. The peanuts and such burnt to the bottom of the pan. So we tried again. This time we waited to add the panut butter. We stirred every so often and when it was thickening up, we pulled it off the burner, added the peanut butter, then the vanilla and then the oats. MUCH better results! Kids thought it was way yummy!

Put mini chocolate chips in half the batch, those firmed up, the rest didn't.  Added about an extra 1/2 cup of oats.  My 4 year old niece loved mixing these up and licking the spoon.  I also found them to be a bit too chocolatey.

Easy and great cookie. I use creamy peanut butter, Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and throw in a hand full of chocolate chips for an extra chocolate boost.

We had a very similar cookie growing up, but it didn't have peanut butter... A great addition! Today, my 4-year-old and I did a half-batch of these for Halloween cookies: We made six HUGE cookies and then six much smaller ones. The huge ones were spiders, complete with four pretzel sticks on either side for legs and two little candies for eyes, and the smaller ones were "spider eggs" with an eye or two here or there... Both my daughter and I had a blast, and she enjoyed stirring the batter and putting on the eyes. I cooked the syrup for a little over two minutes and I used only around 3/4 cup of sugar. Excellent! Thanks for sharing, Pat!

good recipe, only the amount of sugar is crazy - go for one cup (maybe 1.5), and make sure you're using quick cooking oats, and it will take care of the "sticking together problem".  Also, throw three giant heaped tablespoons of PB in there, as well as some toasted coconut.

I thought this recipe would be good because it combines three ingredients I love: oatmeal, peanut butter, and chocolate.  However, these cookies were a disappointment.  They were crumbly, and the sugar mixture was pasty.  They were also too sweet.  Maybe it's because I substituted shortening for butter (but I did follow Crisco's instructions for the substitute), but I wouldn't make them again.

Just like I remember as a kid! I did use 2 tsp vanilla as this recipe was also on the Hersheys Cocoa container, only calling for 2 instead of 1 tsp. vanilla.My kids devoured these and I ate 4 before they were all gone.An easy treat when you don't want the oven on.Will definately make again.

Really tasty! Only problem I had was they stayed sort of gooey despite cooking properly. This recipe could easily be modified to make your own healthy granola bars too.

These are good, but way too sweet.... next time I will cut back on the sugar by at least a half cup.  To balance it out, I added a quarter cup more peanut butter, more cocoa powder and more than a cup more of oatmeal. Even with the additions, I only got about two dozen cookies from the recipe. Update: Yes, with 1 1/2 cups of sugar, it is much better. I made them again with sunflower butter & I like it better than peanut butter. I add 1/4 cup of flax meal and a tsp of almond extract. I replace the milk with soymilk.

The cookie was way too soft to be eaten - like eating soften butter.  i left it in the refrigerator overnight to harden a bit, but it didn't help.  i left it for another night but it was still too soft.  the flavor is all right, but you can't eat more than one.

The key for making these cookies is decreasing the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups and letting the mixture boil until it starts to form a soft ball.  My family has made these for years.  Also, try dropping the mixture into a 9 x 13 pan, if you make a double batch.  Cut 'em up like brownies.

The key to boiling the mixture until it makes a soft ball is the key to it setting properly - we've made these cookies for 40 years or more - passed down from generation to generation.

These were delicious.  I actuall just poured mine onto wax paper then lifted the wax paper and sat it inside a bar/sheet pan.  When it hardened, I lifted the waxpaper out and cut it into squares.  Neat, easy and delicious!!

I just made these cookies. I used 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter instead of the crunchy. They look perfect to me, not runny and not too dry.

I've tried 3 different no bake chocolate cookies from this bunch of no bake recipes and this is my husband's favorite and it has never turned out too loose which is a problem I have sometimes found in these sort of cookies.  I love your recipes.  Thanks!

Love this recipe, so easy and yummy. I've tried a few different additions, like coconut and rice krispies, but by far, our favourite is adding mini marshmallows and putting a tablespoon full between 2 graham crackers... Mmmmmm taking the s'more up a notch! The kids will love 'em.

This is a good basic recipe.  The key to no-bakes is the timing...which I seem to get right about a 1/3 of the time :)  You really have to be so careful as to "under" or "over" boiling because they won't turn out either way.  Luckily these turned out on the 1st try!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used evaporated milk, and used slightly less sugar than the 2 cups called for.  I used peanut butter with no additives (just ground/creamed peanuts) and even added a few more rolled oats.  These didn't set properly, even though I let it roll boil for 2.5-3mins.  I'm sure that these are delicious, and the batter itself was yummy, but mine just never set.  I'm unsure if I'll try them again because I don't want to waste the ingredients if they aren't going to set again. :(

After experimenting with the old Hershey fudge recipe, I've come to a conclusion on these old recipes.  When they were developed, it was back before 2% and skim milk were used.  My dad makes an awesome batch of fudge using the old Hershey recipe, but had a hard time getting it as creamy as his mother used to.  It was then that I thought about the fact that his mother had the milk man deliver full fat milk which creamed on the top.  After that, we made fudge with half and half instead of milk and it was PERFECT!  I'd suggest using a whole milk or evaporated milk to help with texture and setting.

These are the kind of cookies my grandmother always made at Christmas time.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and did 4Tbs of peanut butter, 2tsps of vanilla and used the evaporated milk and cooked for 2.5 minutes.. Not to sure they are going to set up right and they taste way sweet.. still have a good flavor though! Next time I will add a touch more peanut butter, and cut the sugar down, and cook for a tad longer.. then they should be perfect.

These were good, but as others mentioned, too sweet. Very quick and easy to make, but if I try them again I will definitely cut back the sugar.

I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and these were still way too sweet. I also couldn't really taste the peanut butter. I think next time I'll try cutting the sugar down even more and adding more peanut butter.

couldn't get these to set properly, very sweet but still yummy. Next time I would do less sugar at 1.5 cups, 2 tsp vanilla, 4 Tbls peanut butter and boil for 3 or 4 minutes.

Amazing!!! Same as the others, I reduced the sugar (didn't really measure- used about 1 1/4 c), increased the PB to 4 tbsp and the vanilla to 2 tsps. I cooked for 5 minutes, stirring and then put the tray in the fridge to set for a few minutes and they were perfect. They set up nicely with no problems. Tastes like cookie batter!! YUM!

Very easy to make and came out perfect.  Everyone in my house loved them also got rave reviews from our neighbors we shared them with.  Will definitely being making these again and again.
I just made these for a second time but this time added 1 1/2 cups of coconut flakes for something different and they turned out awesome.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any problems with the cookies setting.  Next time I would definitely up the peanut butter, add a pinch of salt, and use 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit for a hot August night!

My mom used to make these growing up & they seemed a lot more chocolatey. I used 2 cups of Splenda and my boyfriend was able to tell. Plus, with 3 cups of oats, they were really oaty & a great jaw workout! HAHAHA!!! :) Next time, I'm going with 2 cups of oats & 1 cup Splenda/1 cup of sugar to see how they turn out. I thought they tasted really good & healthy, but he thought horses would like them...

Recipe worked great. Taste is excellent. I had to substitute unsweetened chocolate squares for some of the cocoa powder and it still came out beautifully! Did a double batch....made 95 cookies...used evaporated milk....excellent recipe.

This recipe is so simple and uncomplicated. I was hesitant at first to use regular oats vs. quick-cooking, but was told by an experienced baker that regular oats would be fine. I used the regular oats and I actually like them in the recipe better than quick-cooking oats. My 7 year old loves them!

Made exactly as stated, turned out fantastic.  Got only a dozen as I like them size of large cookies (2.5-3"dia.) You do have to scoop them out quickly before they cool! I would say to get 4-5 doz., they'd almost have to be bite sized.

First time I made them they were very chewy, and didn't set properly. So the second time around I put the batter in a pan and made them like fudge, very yummy. I will definately make them again. (Also, my boyfriend hates cookies, but he ate most of these and was sure to tell me to make them again).

I followed the recipe as written and the cookies did not set (even after sticking in the fridge overnight).  Other reviewers note to add extra oats (which I didn't have on hand) so it seems as though the recipe should be edited to note the proper amount of ingredients.

Maybe I'm being too critical because I've never made a no-bake cookie before, but these were entirely too sticky. I could barely get them up in one piece. I'm sure I followed the recipe correctly, it's so simple. The flavor was great. They are definitely being eaten, but a napkin is a must to wipe off the goo from your fingers. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome since they are VERY tasty.

It is really good! I changed the recipe slightly. I put about half the amount of sugar in and put a little honey (around a tablespoon) to make it a little healthier. I also put about half the amount of oats in and substituted it for vanilla and almond granola.

The flavor is good-not too peanut-y & since I only used a scant 1cup of sugar, not too sweet.  I cooked for an extra 1.5 minutes but they still never firmed up. I waited 3 hours on the counter in a cool kitchen in December. I put them in the freezer & everyone has been eating them from there. If I take them out of the freezer, they stay firm about 20 minutes or so. If you like no-bake desserts this is nice & quick, but I think I will skip this one next time.

I just made these, and was SUPER impressed by how effortless they were. I also like this recipe better than others like it because the cookie forms softer and more gooey than the tradition ones that "harden". When I was young, we used to scrape them up before they would get hard...now I don't have to! Bravo.

I used 1.25c sugar, just to save on unnecessary calories, and they turned out sweet and yummy!

I was looking for a recipe that used rolled oats since that is all I have. After trying it I realize that quick oats would be better. The taste is good, but the texture is all wrong.

I was hoping these would be like what I made as a child, but not so much.  They formed really well, I let the mix boil 3 minutes and they set great.  I just wasn't a fan of the texture and they are too sweet!!  I did 1 1/2 cups sugar, and could have done with less.

Delicious! 
I read other reviews before making these, and followed their recommendations: I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used 4 Tbsp peanut butter instead of 3, and 2 tsp vanilla instead of two. Most importantly, I boiled the mixture for 2 1/2 minutes instead of 1 1/2, which apparently is the key to making them set.
Mine came out great - I would even try cutting the sugar a little bit further next time, as they were pretty sweet. All in all, though, a definite keeper!

I LOVE this recipe! It's just like the recipe I used to make with my sister all the time. I used creamy peanut butter, but the rest I left the way it is. It's amazing! They are cooling right now, (I stole some of it while it was warm to taste-test. XD) can't wait to have one.

My cookies set perfectly, I did my fair share of reading and boiled for 2.5 minutes at medium heat.  I didn't really know what to expect I've never really heard of no bake cookies, they taste well, but it almost seems like I coated oatmeal in a wonderful mix of chocolate and pb- and that's it.  I used cocoa mix and used less sugar - Overall they're good, but there's no way the recipe yields 5 dozen.

Couldn't find my mom's recipe, so tried this.  LOVE that you don't have to stir it constantly like my mom's version... but these don't seem to set up quite as dry as I like them.  On the bright side, they're MUCH easier to work with (hers dry out before you can even get them on the paper if you aren't fast enough!) and the flavor is the same.  Fast and easy.  YUM.

I read so many no bake oatmeal cookies, I think this is the one I made! :-)  I followed some of the advice from various reviewers and I used creamy, all natural peanut butter (no sugar added).  I also used quick cooking oats.   I didn't read the recipe through so I mixed the oatmeal mixture in while it was on the stove.  I also let it boil for a full 2 minutes once it came to a rolling boil.  So far,they seem to be setting up okay.  I made these for my husband since he loved them as a child.  I hope they're what he remembers.

I used creamy peanut butter and evaporated milk and boiled for 2.5 minutes like suggested. They turned out great. They were sweet but not overly. They were some of the creamiest no bakes I have ever made.

These turned out great.  I read some other reviews and I did allow the mixture to boil for 2 1/2 minutes before adding the vanilla and oats.  I also added a cup of coconut to the mixture.  I have had trouble with no bakes setting up in the past, not this recipe, but the one I couldn't find, and these set up perfectly!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Tasty, my husband always takes a batch to work, and never comes home with leftovers!  I always have to add more rolled oats, because when I follow the recipe, it is too runny.  Other than that, it tastes great!

these were absolutely delicious! i did, however, use only 1/2 stick of butter, 1 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup peanut butter.  i also boiled the mixture for 2.5 minutes, and it seemed to help them stick together well for a no bake cookie!

I don't understand in any possible way how this recipe will make 5 dozen cookies! Not to mention that they were so dry that they wouldn’t even stick together. These are the worst no bake cookies I have ever made. I will defiantly stick to my old recipe! I have been using allrecipes.com for 5 years and have never been this dissatisfied with a recipe.

These were pretty good but I will look for a different recipe. They didn't get as firm as I would have liked them to and I even added more oats. They tasted similar to the ones I had as a kid but something was a little off. Maybe it was the kind of oats I used.

Alrighty, this concoction tasted good, but everything else went wrong for me! I followed the recipe, except had to use brown sugar instead of white, but I didn't think it would make such a big difference, my cookies are still gooey after 2 hours in the fridge and show no signs of hardening. It's basically like eating cookie dough, which is alright but I can't take them anywhere and I won't be sharing. And what's with the quantity? 4-5 dozen?? I got 23 normal sized cookies (eating no dough!) I don't know what went wrong but I won't be doing this again.

Awesome.  I've made this recipe many times!  Usually while I'm watching tv in the evening, I'll get a taste for it and whip up a batch.  I make sure to always have the ingredients on hand!  I boil a little while longer to make sure the cookies set-up.  Sometimes they don't anyway and sometime they get crumbly.  Not sure what that's all about, but I eat it regardless! :)

The taste is excellent.  I added one cup of flaked cocoanut. I'm wondering though, if quick cooking oats would absorb some of the liquid, as with the three cups of regular rolled oats, there was alot of liquid left over. The cookie itelf was quite loose.  I had to use 4 cups of rolled oats. A YUMMY COOKIE!

Delicious cookie!  My only suggestions would be to use creamy peanut butter, decrease the sugar to 1.5 cups, and stir a little while the mix is boiling and the cookies will turn out great!!

Very good!  I needed a quick recipe to take to an event and I was VERY low on groceries.  This fit the bill perfectly!  I had no flour on hand and was almost out of milk.  I added sweetened condensed milk (1/4cup) to meet the 1/2 cup milk requirement.  I doubled the vanilla as suggested - glad I did.  Only had smooth peanut butter on hand, which worked fine.  Next time I'd like to try crunchy.  My kids enjoyed doing this recipe with me.

This cookie reminiscent of my child-hood days and I have searched for just the right one.  I am happy to say... THIS IS IT!!!  The peanut butter adds something that was missing in other similar recipes I have tried.

This was the first cookie I made with my Mom.  Her recipe files were lost when we flooded.  I was releived to find the same one on this sight.  My memory was close, I wanted to sub marshmallow creme for the milk!  My babies love spending time in the kitchen, this one is messy with out being  continuos heat dangerous!

Instead of using peanut butter, since my boyfriend is alergic to it, I used chocolate chips (1/2 cup). It was fast and definitely satisfied my chocoholic cravings!

Delicious! I did a bit of tweaking to the sugar, 1 1/2 c. and sub coconut oil for butter. Also, 4 heaping tbl of chunky peanut butter. I will make em´ again and reduce the sugar even more. Crazy, because I am a sugar lover but it was still too much.

Yummy cookies! I cut sugar to 1 1/4 cup and would even go to 1 cup but fear may not hold together? They hit the chocolate spot well. And I did boil for about 4 minutes.

It did not set up boiling for only 1&1/2 minutes.  I got a similar recipe from my sister-in-law which recommended 3 minutes of boiling and had better luck.

Classic recipe, classic taste. Don't cook too long or too short while boiling or they will end up not setting or crumbly. For the people who find them runny: you need to start the minute and a half once there is a "rolling boil" (all over the pot which doesn't go away when stirred) instead of a few bubbles around the edges. I always use regular oats & smooth peanut butter because that's what we have. Also I skip the butter ring around the pot and just stir...it's only for a couple minutes, what's the bother?

This recipe is the almost the same as the one I learned to cook from my elementary school friend's mother around 1960 and have made ever since. My recipe calls for 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter, omitted the vanilla and boiled the mixture exactly 3 minutes. In fact, the recipe was called 3-minute Oatmeal Candy because it used Quaker 3-Minute Oats. I cannot find that exact oatmeal but it was a texture between the Quick Quaker Oats and the Old Fashioned Oats. The candy is delicious but to me it will never be the exact texture without those 3-minute Oats.

Followed this recipe exactly, as it's the first time I've made these since I was a kid and I needed a refresher. Turned out perfectly! My 3-year-old loved being able to help. They set up really well just sitting on my counter, and when they were hard enough to handle, I put them in the frig. Yum! I'm pretty sure my sons & I will be making these again (and again and again and again....)

These did not set up very well for me but remained somewhat gummy. I started timing after my mixture came to a rolling boil, but I should have probably let them boil for two minutes instead of 1.5. I also used rolled oats and feel like they remained too tough. I will try again with quick oats and evaporated milk.

I made a half batch. I've never had these before so I'm not sure what they're supposed to be like. I boiled my mixture for 2 1/2 min and they set up just fine. The problem was that these were way too sweet and the texture of the sugary coating was off-putting. I don't know that I'd change anything though. I think it's just how they're meant to be.

Simple to make.  I remember making these when I was in middle school.  Takes very little time to make, and just a couple hours in the fridge to cool off and solidify.  Also, I put about 1/2 cup less of sugar to cut on the sweetness.  I might cut even more than that next time.

If you want a really great taste, eat some of these with strawberries.  Delicious!

Another thought:  I'm going to try replacing the oats with Rice Krispies and see how it turns out.  I also thought about replacing regular cocoa powder with dark chocolate to see how it turns out.

I'm a terrible baker so I thought I would give these a try.  I was a little concerned it might not set up since far better cooks were having trouble.  But I made sure the bubbles were all across the top as some one else had suggested and they turned out great!  After a few "test" cookies I realized there aren't many left.  I am off to make a double batch this time!

needed to make a dairy-free version while I was nursing - I simply substituted coconut milk and earth balance buttery spread for the milk and butter, and I'm really happy with how they turned out. a little on the sweet side, but set just like a no-bake should.

I thought we got these cookies as kids when we had been very, very good!!!  My brother and I nicknamed them messy cookies because if they didn't set (usually due to the humidity) we just grabbed a spoon and dug in!  My mother always used creamy peanut butter so that's the only change I made.  I even got an A+ in college describing these cookies in an essay!  My Mom was so proud!!!

These cookies were a big hit!  Next time, I'm going to try cutting back the sugar a bit and see if they will still set up nicely.  They were a little too sweet for me.  However, as I said, they were a big hit with the rest of the crowd.

When I need a chocolate fix, this is the cookie I go to! I used to make these all the time as a kid with my mom, the only difference is the PB was missing. I love the addition of PB! (I think they taste great no matter if they set up right or not.)

Make with 1/2 cup evaporated milk instead of milk. Reduce sugar a little. Double peanut butter. Used 1/2 butter instead because its what I have. Add a few shakes of salt. Boil hard until soft ball on temp.

As recipe stands it was a 3 star.

Loved them! BUT I cut the sugar in half, and added 1/2 c coconut and 2 1/2 c oatmeal instead of all 3 c oatmeal. I used other people's suggestions by putting in evaporated milk instead of regular, used smooth PB, and doubled vanilla.  They were still gooey after over an hour in the fridge, but the taste is worth it!

I just tried these, been having trouble with my Grandmother's recipe. Definitely boil these 1 1/2 minutes. Read earlier reviews and was afraid they wouldn't set up. There are great but a little dry. I boiled 2 minutes. Stick to recipe. I just ate one. Yummy

This recipe was very easy and simple and tasted great.  I never heard of these cookie before until my husband asked me to make them for him.  He said he had them all the time when he was little.  They turned out great and everyone like them :)

Oh my goodness these are gooood!  I couldn't wait for them to harden.  I did use 1/2 C of peanut butter and extra vanilla.  They are divine, I will have to try the evaporated milk next time.

My husband LOVES these. He calls these "crack" cookies because he says they're highly addictive. 

I like to make them in the summer when it's too hot to turn on the oven. I just made him a batch for our anniversary. They disappear in no time. Super easy. I grate a square of dark baking chocolate in and add extra peanut butter. Sometimes I use cashew butter instead of peanut. All very tasty!

crunchy peanut butter works well, also try honey roasted peanut butter.  I let the coco, sugar, milk and butter boil for about 3 mins then add the vanilla and peanut butter. Adding dark chocolate coco will give a more bitter chocolate taste.

They came out good after I added more oats (I used the old fashioned, and they probably didn't set up as well as the quick) I also added dried cranberries. Always a favorite.

I was looking for something easy to make with ingredients I had around the house, and this recipe was perfect! I may have used a bit too much sugar but I can't fault the recipe for my error. Anyway, my boyfriend ate three right away, and that was a very good sign. The only thing I did differently is make the recipe smaller to yield 10 cookies. I ended up with 8 medium-sized ones and can't wait to make more!!

I as well found it to be too sweet, so I leave out the peanut butter and add chopped pecans.  It definitely is a must to start timing at the onset of the rolling boil.

These are the cookies that my grandmother made when I was growing up. This recipes is FAB! Easy, quick, minimal ingredients, and makes great gifts for family and friends over the holidays without breaking the bank! Also these taste great without the cocoa as well. Great recipe, will use again and again!

wow, I found this recipe, made it and enjoyed it all in 30 minutes!  My 4 year old helped, and it couldn't have been easier.  Very yummy!  We couldn't even let them cool long enough before eating them.  ** I ran out of sugar at 1 1/2 cups, so added a few tablespoons of brown sugar- came out perfect (and still very sweet!)

the consistency was very good, not too drippy but not dry.  however, i felt the taste was a little off from other no-bake cookies i've made, but maybe it's just the brand of ingredients i used.

These were okay, but a little dry. There seemed to be too much oatmeal for my taste. My mom makes a similar recipe, so next time I'll use hers. Sorry.

These satisfied my craving for something sweet when I didn't have a lot of ingredients around.  However, as others have mentioned, they are very sweet and seem almost like a candy rather than cookies.

Great!!!!! Cookie!!!!! I only used 1 cup sugar and about 1/4 c. honey. I also boiled mine for just over 2 min. Next time I will only use 1 cup sugar because I thought is was very sweet! And like most others....Tastes as good as I remember them!!

This recipe is the first no-bake one I've tried. I loved it!  I used chunky peanut butter which tasted really good.  Very easy!!!

I've been making this recipe since I was a little girl and I absolutely love it! It's great for chocolate cravings ;) Sometimes I have troubl with the cookies setting properly, but that has never affected the taste!

Good recipe. I would use about a tablespoon less sugar, but good recipe. I used to make these as a kid, but lost the recipe. Thanks for it! :-)

5 stars! We love cookies but I begrudge the time it takes baking them, until now.  This recipe was a huge hit with my husband, I did not change a thing.  Thank you.

These are easy and very good (I have made a similar recipe in the past that used quick oats instead of rolled...I think I liked that better because more of the liquid was absorbed)

My family is convinced that these are addictive because they're so good! I absolutely love these cookies, and will be making them again. Next time, I might try reducing the butter slightly so that they're not so greasy.

Excellent cookie Pat.  I made a batch of these and they were gone in less than 24 hours.  I used creamy PB instead of crunchy (due to a picky 5 year old) and they were delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

This has the perfect flavor but way too gooey.  Not the right consistency in the end.

It took a couple of tries to get them to harden properly. Once I perfected it, they were great!These are very similar to no-bake cookies my Mom is famous for making around the holidays, especially when we get tired of baking & decorating all the other cookies! I also like that they are lower in fat, etc.

These are so easy and so good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the vanilla to 2 tsp.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  They came out perfectly.  Our older son (who had requested that I make them) and our younger daughter LOVE them.

I too used the evaporated milk and extra teaspoon of vanilla as another reviewer suggested.  Wowie-Wow-Wow!  These were great and very creamy.  I should tell you that I used the old fashioned slow cooking oatmeal so they had a better appearance and tasted even better.  Quick oats simply don't cut it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yum-yum!  I'd never made these before, not even as a child (as everyone else seems to have done).  They were easy, and fun, and tasty.  I added miniature marshmallows to some of them, just to see what that'd be like.  I think they're rich enough without them.  Thanks for the fun recipe!
