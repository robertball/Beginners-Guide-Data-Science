Calling all avocado lovers! This particular recipe was extremely quick and easy. Very smooth and creamy! This is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time. The sour cream adds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime. This recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado, but I did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty. I have made it with the chicken blended and while I do not mind it, I really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad, so I opted this time to add it after I have blended all of the other ingredients. I served it along with some brioche sliders and voila! Perfect for a group of friends too. Will continue to make this again and again!

Not very kid friendly.
Next time I won't pur√©e the chicken.
The consistency was sort of pasty

I made this and loved it! The only changes I made were using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, & I used half the amount of pepper (but next time might use even less). I also don't have a food processor, so I kind of chopped the chicken then shredded by hand a little and it turned out just fine. Will definitely be making again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used light cottage cheese (blended to make it smooth) instead of the sour cream to keep it light.  Delicious!

Good basic recipe, made better when I made the following changes:  Used half sour cream, half mayo and cut back on the pepper.  Also chopped the chicken into bite size pieces and stirred the dressing in.  Was so tasty that I forgot to add the avocado!

This recipe is delicious! A couple changes- instead of sour cream, use 0% milk fat Greek yogurt. Tastes the same, has less fat, and is loaded with protein. Also, I added some red onion for a little crunch! And because I love garlic, I threw in a few cloves. We ate this on crackers, and also rolled up in a tortilla. YUM!

This was really good and creamy. Two out of three kids ate it. The recipe calls for too much pepper I think. Next time I'll cut the pepper down.

This is good. I really liked the lime and avocado flavor with the chicken. I didn't add all the pepper--probably just a total of 1/4 t. I used canned chicken, so I didn't puree any of it--just stirred it all around until creamy, but with a few chunks. I took some out for myself, and then I added diced red onion because my husband has to have raw onion in any chicken salad. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce to his.

Flavorful and delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  Loved the cool of the sour cream, the zing of the lime and the creamy avocado.

Yummy!  I use a hand mixer to shred the chicken after I break the chicken into big chunks by hand.  And I mash the avocado with an avocado tool I have with a little masher on the end.  Easy peasy :)

This tasted really good. The only thing I didn't like was having to get out my big food processor for this little bit of food so I tried to use the blender- bad idea. Way too thick so I ended up using a fork to shred the chicken and it was hard to get everything out of the bottom of the blender.
