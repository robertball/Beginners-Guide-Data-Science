Yum!! I made this dish exactly as directed and it came out perfectly. No one flavor/ingredient overpowered the other - they all blended together perfectly. My 8-year-old daughter loved it too.  I plan to make this part of our regular weeknight dinners and won't change a thing!

This was a hit tonight!  I did double the chicken, , subbed butter for margarine, added extra garlic, and used just ground black pepper instead of lemon pepper.  It came out tasting great - I subbed in multi grain pasta and no fat sour cream to feel a little less guilty.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

Such a great tasting dish, for any of those folks who love Bertucci's lemon creme penne rigate this is the perfect substitute.  Definetley add more chicken, cheese and think about doubling the spinich and mixing it through out the mix not just on top.  So tasty!

I liked the concept of this dish but the pasta came out really dry. Next time I think I will add more sour cream and perhaps even some cream cheese.

This recipe was tasty, but a little dry.  Also, this is for well more than 4 people.  Adding milk to the leftovers improved the dish.  I also added auteed onions in the butter/oil after cooking the chicken.  I put the spinach in the sauce and used more than it called for.  At least a full cup of spinach is better for this, would be great adding other veggies as well.

I followed this recipe almost to a  T, and it was fabulous! I used butter instead of margarine and  just added a little extra lemon when I put the cheese on, and it was superb. My family really enjoyed it (including my husband who detests sour cream.) Great dish, will certainly be making again.

This was excellent. I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I used penne instead of bow-tie and cream cheese instead of sour cream because it was all I had. I also upped the white wine. Was excellent. My boyfriend loved it and keeps asking when I'll be making it again. Great recipe!

I made this based on the good reviews and the ingredients I happened to have around the house.  I brought it to a potluck dinner.  The guests seemed to like it.  My husband really liked it too.  But for me, it was just a bit strange.  Much too lemony and I felt it needed salt to balance out the acidic taste.  But my husband said the lemon gave it a very fresh flavor.  So, not my favorite...but apparently good for others.

Delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a lasagna pan. I accidentally added the entire amount of lemon, so I squeezed a half of lemon over the top at the end for liquid. It was so lemony and good. Everyone raved about it. I'm going to try mushrooms, black olives and ham (instead of the chicken) next time. Hint: If you like your pasta al dente, undercook your pasta a little. It continues to cook in the sauce while in the oven, and got a bit mushier than we would prefer.

My MIL requested "Italian" for her  birthday dinner. I chose this...Perfect. Everyone enjoyed it, all having more than one helping. I used three chicken breasts and half a bag of baby spinach which I stirred into the sauce. I also used more cheese. I will definetly make this again. My MIL requested the recipe, which never happens! Outstanding.

My family would not eat this recipe.  Eventhough we love lemon, this taste was way too strong.  Plus, it was kind of dry.

This recipe was good but the lemon flavor overpowered it. I may have added too much-I didnt have a zester so I used a grater. Mistake!  It was really delicious nonetheless. I would at least double or triple the chicken and same with the spinach. Also would mix it up before the last 10 or so minutes. Yum!

This was very good! I used a pound of pasta to the 2 cups of sour cream, 1/2 cup of white wine and added more garlic, basil and spinach. I think the spinach could be mixed in at the end to cook through because it is rich rather than just on top. I used 1 cup of reg sr cream and 1 cup lowfat.

Awesome! The pickiest eater in the world ate it (my hubby)! I would add more cheese and less lemon in next time, though. But other than that, SUPERB!

Followed recommendations and added more garlic, spinach, basil and cheese. Also used ff sour cream. This was too tart for my family. I'm going to try this one more time and substitute cream for the sour cream and then simmer to reduce.  Also I feel I should have added the basil a minute before the sauce was done. Got overlooked for my taste.

It's good but there's lots of room for improvement. Double the basil, parsley, spinach and parmesan. Reduce wine with garlic before adding cream and add the basil AFTER removing from heat. All that sour cream makes the flavor too sour combined with lemon and tends to make a lumpy sauce. A bechamel with cream or half n half would make a smooth sauce and reduce sourness.

This was delicious!  Rather than layering the chicken, pasta & spinach, I just mixed it all together and put in the casserole dish.  I omitted the butter and cooked the chicken in olive oil.  Followed all other directions as written.  Great flavor, quick & easy!

This definitely had a "different" type taste, but it was good.  I would probably make this dish every once in a while, but probably not frequently.

This was really good! I didn't quite have enough sour cream, so I added a little cream cheese to it. The sauce was delicious and stuck to the pasta. Made with colorful bow tie pasta and served with bread sticks! It was awesome.

I wasn't sure it would taste good when I put it in the oven because the garlic was overwhelming, but the spinach and cheese balanced it out nicely. I didn't have a fresh lemon for the zest but I put in some lemon juice. It was great!

The absolutely only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because it was so good I ate WAY too much and got a tummy ache. So for not guarding myself against myself it gets only 4 stars. Great pasta. All the seasonings come together so well and I love spinach. Told my 2 year old it's what popeye would eat so of course he loved it, too.

I was looking for an easy pasta recipe that included lemon and basil and found this.  I tried it with what I had on hand (didn't have parmesan so I used jack and gouda..also no spinach so I added mushrooms). I don't think those changes affected the flavor, it was great!  The basil didn't add much flavor (or my lemon was too overpowering) but the combination of flavors was perfect for my taste! My husband said "The flavor isn't what I would think for a creamy sauce..it's not bad just not what I would think". He rated it 3 stars and I thought it was 5 stars so I rated it between the two. Thank for the great recipe!

I liked the flavors but mine had a wierd texture. I doubled the recipe because one chicken breast would not have cut it in my household, so maybe that's why. I'll probably make it again, but use less sour cream and less parmesan but more mozarella.  I really enjoyed the freshness of the spinach and parsley & the leftovers were better than the original.

Made exactly as written.  It was very lemony and everyone loved it.  I might use more spinach next time and mix it into the dish.

This would be very good with the following tweaks. After step 4, mix pasta, wine, garlic, sour cream, basil, lemon juice and zest, parsley, and spinach together. Then put over the chicken, and top with the cheeses and extra lemon juice.  Also add more spices.  Serve with Pinot Grigio.

THIS RECIPE IS SUPERB! As others have noted it is a bit dry so I recommend adding a little more white wine. But man what an amazing tasting dish. This will be a regular for us!

Loved this.  Had a small taste prior to leaving it for my mom as dinner while we were out of town.  She ate every last bit and asked for the recipe as soon as we got home.
I made it exactly as written.  Yes it is not dripping with sauce - if you like tons of suace with your pasta then increase the amount.  I liked it just the way it is - tasting pasta, spinach and basil.

I can't rave enough about this dish.  I doubled the recipe, then tripled the chicken.  We are not usually big eaters, but this was so delicious that we all had, at least, seconds.  It barely fed the six of us.  I will be serving this to friends and, often, to family.  Thank you, thank you for this marvelous recipe.

This is one of the best new dishes I have made in a while! My family ate it up. This dish would adapt well to personal preferences. I love basil and will add more next time. This would also make a great potluck dish. Definitely going in my recipe box!

Very good!  I used a whole chicken breast.  I didn't realize I only had about 1 cup of sour cream, so I also halved the garlic, white wine, and lemon juice.  Since I had already boiled all of the pasta without realizing I didn't have enough sour cream, I just dumped in what looked good enough.  The rest of the ingredients I just guessed as well.  Turned out great!  Could have even used two chicken breasts to make more servings.

I made this recipe the other day.  Easy to make but it came out dry.  I would add 1/4 cup more wine or add more sour cream next time.  The flavor was good though.

This as an excellent and is also a very good base sauce to take into some new directions after I get this one down the way we like it. I never made a sauce with sour cream before so I'm very pleased to have had such a good recipe to try it with. I will tweak a bit the next time. We are a garlic loving family so I will add more garlic, also a bit more basil and some grated parm into the sauce itself and I'll add all of the lemon juice to the sauce as  putting it over the top broke the sauce. And definitely more cheese over the top! We also decided that we'd prefer it with the spinach as a base with the pasta over that and a breaded chicken cutlet on top and the sauce over all.

I made this last night it was awesome. I added a little milk to before I baked it becuase it seemed like it would be too dry for my taste. I also added some spinach into the sauce as it cooked and later as the directions called for. Oh and I used 2 chicken breast halves made it seem equally balanced.  Great meal!

This was a pretty decent and quick recipe. I did use a bit more cheese than what was called for, approximately double as my kids love cheese. Definitely repeatable.

A great meal for the summer no doubt. It came out a little dry for me. Next time I will add more sauce and less chicken. I had help, so I think the ingredients were miscommunicated. Loved the taste!

LOVE this pasta!  I made one change, I had lemon basil AND lime basil on hand, but not regular ol' basil.  So I used the lemon & lime to add to the flavor.  The dish was great!  Thanks for sharing a yummy recipe.  
Oh, wait, I made another change...I read a few reviews complaining that the dish was dry so I threw in a little extra white wine ;)

Just fabulous! The sweet basil in the flavor mix was a revelation.  I generally stay away from casseroles, having been raised on them as a nightly meal, lol.. but this one was perfect.
Only substitution's I made were chicken broth for white wine  and butter for margarine.

loved, loved, loved this dish.  The fresh lemon flavor is the best do not substitue that.  I would add  a bit more spinach because 1/2 a cup was just not enough.  I made it exactly as it says and it was perfect!

The dish was very good!  I added more basil, also I thought the pasta and the caserole itself was a little dry after the first bake time so, I added a little milk to the dish before adding the cheese and lemon juice, this made the dish very good.  My family loved it!  I would recomend this dish looking for a quick meal!

This recipe was dry-ish. I didn't have mozzarella so I used sharp cheddar which gave it a nice zing.  I will tweak it to make the sauce a little creamier next time.  I loved the basil/lemon combination.

I made this the other night and it was good, but I will make some changes next time.  First thing I would change would be to use more chicken.  Maybe I got a smaller chicken breast, but there wasn't much there and I think I would use the whole thing instead of half next time.  Next is the lemon, half the juice is plenty and there is no need to drizzle the remaining lemon juice in step 5.  Also, I'm a garlic fan so two cloves was not enough for my taste.  The only other thing I would add would be some diced onion with the wine and sour cream mixture, and maybe some capers too.

I like this recipe.  It is tasty.  Made a few revisions:  only 1 cup of low fat sour cream, added more wine, added chicken broth to total probably more like 1.5 cups of liquid when I poured it over the pasta, used more parmesean, spinach and fresh mozzarella.  I did not add the last half of lemon juice.  It came out creamy, flavorful and just right.  Also it made a medium sized Pyrex rectangular casserole which I consider to be about six to eight servings.  Thanks for a great idea!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  We doubled the chicken, doubled the garlic, doubled the cheese and spinach - all the rest is as listed.  Thanks to those sharing comments, thanks to the folks that posted the recipe in the first place.  It definitely joins the rotation.

Excellent. I followed the minor changes suggested by a number of people. I doubled the garlic as well as the chicken and added extra white wine to avoid the dryness. I too used butter instead of marg. -> ' it's always better with butter' - as any cardiologist!
The lemon was a touch much but that is a matter of preference.

This was so lemony. Out of the five in my family only one person didn't complain  but she is a baby and can't talk.  I was really surprise it got such great reviews. It was edible and the chicken everyone picked out and said it tasted good.  I would not make this again.

Just made this tonight and it was excellent! I followed the recipe as stated, except I used about 1/2cup of wine, and light sour cream. No issues with it being dry at all. Will be making again!

After trying a new rec  all 6 of us review at the table. I did chng wine for chicken broth & doubled the chicken.  Did not measure the fresh baby spinach or the cheese.  Just put a healthy layer on top.  One said a little to tangy - 5 yelled "eat a peanut butter sandwich".    Next time they'd like to try peppers & mushrooms added to the sauce.  Thank you for sharing Brennan, this is a keeper.

Tried the recipe and did not like.  We like lemon but this was too lemony.  It was also very dry.  As we do not eat meat I did leave the chicken out  I am guessing the juice and fat from the chicken would have added more moisture.  Will not try again.

This dish was very flavorful.  I added an extra cup of sour cream due to the reviews stating it was dry, but it was still dry.  Overall a good dish!

It was fine, but a bit bland and too lemony.  I will make it again, but use 1/3 the lemon, more basil, spinach, garlic and salt. I also liked the idea of some other reviewes of adding cream cheese to make it more creamy.

LOVED this!  The only alteration I made was using fat free sour cream.  My family said it was definitely something they wanted again.  I may try putting more vegetables in it, but it was delicious just the way the recipe said to make it.

I thought this sounded pretty good, but was kind of disappointed.  I added lots more chicken, quite a bit more wine, and more garlic, but you couldn't taste the wine, the sour cream, the garlic.  The lemon came through, and was quite nice, but all in all it was kind of bland and not too memorable.  If I made it again, I'd increase the wine some more, the basil more, and maybe more salt.  The pasta wasn't too dry--pretty good.  Just kind of a bland dish that I don't think I'll try again.

Loved this as is. Will be perfect meal for my book club. Can make ahead and heat up when guests arrive. Next time i'll add a bit more chicken and toss with the pasta.  Served with a green salad and crunchy French bread.

De-li-cious!! I didn't have the lemon pepper, so I used regular pepper and added extra lemon to the sauce. The flavor of the lemon with the basil turns out great and using the farfalle pasta creates perfect layers to serve. Thank you all recipes for the suggestion and Brennan for posted it. Already in my recipe box!

I was intrigued by this recipe and I love lemon. My husband won't eat spinach, so I used a small can of mushrooms, put half the cheese in with the original sauce dump. It was a little dry, but very tasty. Warning: do NOT try to use reduced fat sour cream. My bad. Otherwise good, just not "I've got to make this again next week Good". Definitely worth a try :)

Wow, this dish has a unique flavor that I really liked. On top of that, it's such an easy dish to make that you can really customize it all sorts of ways to make all kinds of fun variations. I've made this recipe as is and I've made it with some changes. In the end, it was all good. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good but I agree with some of the other posters, I thought it was a bit dry. The sauce looks thin when you put it in the casserole dish, but by the time you bake it, the sauce thickens up and I like my pasta sauces thinner. Also, be prepared for it to be QUITE lemony... I might leave out just a bit next time. Delicious otherwise!

This dish was amazing :) I did change it a little, just for the simple fact I didn't have all the ingredients. I left the spinach out all together, and instead if fresh basil I used dried Italian Seasoning. I also doubled the wine, and used more chicken. My four year old loved it. She had two helpings!! We have plenty of leftovers, so we will be sure to be enjoying this for a couple days to come.

Horrible. I love lemon, but there was way too much. It over powered the basil. The recipe could have used more spinach. I was hoping for a creamy consistency, rather than. A cheesy one, so I substituted cream cheese, knowing it would make little difference in the flavor. It wasn't enough.

This is a great recipe.  I did have to tweak a few things based off other people's reviews and comments.  I used one cup of sour cream and one cup of cream cheese.  I did not layer the pasta and the spinach, but mixed it all together before pouring on top of the chicken.  I also did add onion and garlic when cooking the chicken (don't cook the chicken all the way since it still needs to go into the oven).  Topped it with fresh grated parm and mozzarella cheese, and left over basil and parsley. Oh also if you find it being a little to dry after you take it off the foil just pour some milk or heavy whipping cream (I had some in the fridge) before putting on the cheese toppings.  Family enjoyed it very much.  We are thinking of trying it with shrimp next time.

Great! I coupled it with zucchini and tomato casserole. Four different cheeses! Do yourself a favor and get better cheese with robust flavor! Yum!

Good, but I wouldn't say great.y husband liked it and said to make it again. I felt it needed more chicken such as 2 chicken breasts not just 1 and maybe just mix everything together. I cheated and used frozen leaf spinach and no complaints.

Made a few changes based on prior reviews and the need to increase the serving sizes. Used 1.5 lbs chicken with an extra tsp of lemon pepper, 4 cups of pasta, and increased the white wine to 1/2 cup. I probably added more parsley and spinach than it called for, as I didn't really measure. I think the proportions of chicken, pasta, and sauce were spot on with these changes. This is a surprisingly light pasta dish with the cream-like sauce. Great for summer!

I skipped the baking part, kind of just mixed it all together and served as is, and I acknowledge that baking may have given all the flavors a chance to meld a bit. For me it was good, but not a go-to recipe.

This is a keeper! I happened to have all the ingredients either in my fridge, pantry or backyard so I gave it a try and I'm glad I did! I used light sour cream since that's what I had. I thought this was even better the next day. Thanks for sharing!

LOVE THIS DISH! I did make a few substitutions only because I didn't have all ingredients handy and a bit short on time. First (and highly recommend!), I used an electric skillet set at 350 to cook the chicken. I seasoned with dash salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp Mrs Dash garlic herb seasoning. When almost done added garlic, zest, 1/2 juice, wine and 1tsp dried basil. Brought to boil and added cooked (wheat) pasta and torn dark green romaine. Heat thru (about 5 mins) and added 1 cup plain Greek yogurt WITH 1/2 grated Parmesan cheese, and 1 tsp dried parsley. Poured remaining lemon juice, stirred and briefly heated. Served immediately right from skillet, easy! Received glowing compliments from my husband and has requested this again soon!

It was good, but next time I'll cut the lemon zest in half. I did have a large lemon. Just a little too lemony.

I loved this recipe  I added cheese and spinach to the dish when I added the bow tie pasta to the sauce, I still added those ingredients to the top. I also used 3 small chicken breasts with extra lemon pepper.  The flavors blend so well together you just can't go wrong!

As written this is a 4-star recipe. Flavors are great - however, there is not enough sauce and I believe there should be more basil than called for, as well as more spinach.  I used a pinot grigio wine from one of our local wineries. I liked that there was plenty left to drink with the meal!  I would put this at a 4-5 serving recipe.  This will be made again.  Maybe next time I will also add some mushrooms.

YUM! Used already cooked chicken breast chunks, added more wine, more garlic, and used only 2 cups of pasta...also didn't have lemon pepper so used juice of entire lemon. Family loved it.

This came out really good even though I didn't have quite all the ingredients necessary!  I used more wine, and only had about 1 1/4 cups of sour cream so I made up the difference with milk.  Used a bit more garlic and 2 chicken breasts, and only had bottled lemon juice.  I mixed the spinach and mozzarella in with the pasta, sauce and chicken, then baked covered for about 18 minutes. Added more mozzarella and parmesan on top, and then baked uncovered another 12 or so minutes.

This one will go into rotation to be made on a regular basis at my house. I took other reviewer's advice and doubled up on the garlic, cheese, basil, and spinach, and used 3 chicken breast halves. I also added the basil with the other ingredients that are added just before the last 10 minutes of cooking as basil loses flavor duing cooking. Using fresh basil, parmesan, and lemon make a huge difference in this recipe as it doesn't have a lot of ingredients. I didn't think the lemon was too much, but I love lemon. I made this in a 10 x 13 casserole, I think it may have fit in a 9 x 11. My husband and I ate 2 large helpings, and had to force ourselves to stop eating!

Good flavor if you add more basil and lemon. However there's just way too much cream going on here in my opinion. I'd cut it by half.
