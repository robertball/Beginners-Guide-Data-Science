I used this wonderful recipe to start me out.  I added avacados, cucumber, garlic, and my favorite blend of all spices.  I was happy to see limes instead of lemon and fresh tomatoes being used instead of canned paste or puree.  Double your recipe because its healthy and tastes even better the next day. Thank you Skeeter.

I tweaked a bit due to personal taste. I added an avocado and half a cucumber. Delish! Great summer meal. Thanks so much for sharing Skeeter!

This recipe is fantastic!  I've made this countless number of times and everyone who tastes it loves it.  I add diced yellow and an orange peppers.

Delicious! Each region of Central and South America have their own spin on ceviche.  My friend from Guatemala said to add "salsa inglesa" (Worcestershire sauce) and Tabasco sauce.  That added just the right "punch" for our taste buds.  
Thank you for sharing!!

My wife and I liked this recipe just the way it is. Although, next time I will use baby shrimp.

This didn't turn out well for me at all.
