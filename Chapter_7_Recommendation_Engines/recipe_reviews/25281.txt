A delicious and easy vegetarian meal, although I made a few changes.  I felt the stacks needed a bit more flavor, so I added minced garlic to the marinade and then sprinkled grated romano cheese inbetween each layer.  (Also be sure to season everything with salt and pepper.)  I chopped the mushroom stems, leftover onion and eggplant and sauteed in olive oil with 4 cloves of minced garlic, then added a can of diced tomatoes to make a quick pasta sauce.  It simmered while the stacks cooked in the oven.  I served the stacks with pasta and sauce; the entire meal was satisfying and delicious.  I feel that this dish needs slightly higher heat or a longer cooking time, especially if you cut your slices on the thicker side!

This was really tasty.. Earlier in the day I grilled the mushroom, onion, and eggplant to give it a nice smoky flavor.  Then when we were ready for dinner, i just popped it in the oven. Next time, I think I'll try it with fresh mozzarella cheese. mmmmmmm...

First I took the slices of eggplant and put them on a cookie sheet and sprinkled them with olive oil, basil and garlic powder.  Broiled them 5 minutes on each side.  Then I threw the eggplant in a 9X13 pan and threw in the balsamic marinated mushrooms and onions.  I dumped in a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes and and baked for 45 minutes to one hour at 350.  Then topped with mozzerella and parmesian.  It was incredibly yummy.

I love this recipe and have made it for years.  I take thin slices of chicken that I have cooked and set them on top of the mushroom.  I am going to try the recipe next time with basil like others have suggested.  Super yummy!

I really like this recipe. The only thing missing, for my taste, is some fresh herbs. A few whole basil leaves between the onion and tomato make a big difference.
I have also tried this casserole style - I made a simple sauce with the tomatoes and onions, with some garlic and lots of fresh herbs-oregano, basil and rosemary. Omitted the balsamic vinegar and instead poured the sauce over the eggplant and mushroom and topped with the cheese. This made a delicious and healthy vegetarian main course. Thanks for sharing, Deb!

Good! Mine ended up looking quite comical because my garden didn't have any large tomatoes ripe for me when I went out to grab one for this recipe, so I had to use halved cherry tomatoes. Looked funny, but still tasty. I did sweat the eggplant while the mushroom & onion marinated. I added fresh cracked black pepper and garlic powder. Thanks :)

SO EASY! the flavors were superb, but terribly difficult to eat. it really tastes best to get all the ingredients in one bite, but to not feel like you're stuffing your face, you need to chop it uo into bite size pieces.

This was great!  My picky husband even liked it!  I did add some fresh basil in between the mushroom and tomato which turned out well.  I also added pepper, garlic powder and some lemon pepper seasoning throughout the stack since others said that it was a little bland and it turned out great!

mmm tasty.  1: the eggplant won't dry out.  it'll get mushy as it cooks (one reviewer added oil because of concern of this).  2. this recipe totally looks appetizing!  

great way to serve fresh veggies.  i think when i do this again i'll add some fresh basil.  but yum!  thanks!

This recipe was excellent! The step that indicates the method of putting the stacks together was a little confusing, so I placed them them this way: mushroom, eggplant, onion, tomato, and cheese on top.  
I did marinate the onion and mushroom as instructed and would keep it this way but not too much, so that it's not soggy.
The eggplant should be thinly sliced as its overpowering if to thick. In order to keep the mushroom and eggplant from drying out I made mix of extra virgin olive oil and salt mix (garlic powder, vegi-sal, and seasoning salt)and lightly coated them.  
This would be a fun appetizer if sliced into triangle shapes and placed on toothpicks!!  Next time I make it I am sure to add a photo if one has not been added yet!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I griled the veggies, as some of the reviewers suggested, but marinated for a much shorter time.  Stacked the veggies, then covered with tomato sauce adn cheese, baked and broiled.  It was great, but the veggies are so pourous, I wouldn't marinate at all or cut the marinade to avoid excess liquid att he end.

Perfect lazy-single-guy source of a healthy meal :-).  I used extra vinegar, some olive oil to stop the eggplant drying up and red capsicum.

This turned out even better than expected. I will definitely make again. I took the advice from another reviewer and grilled the mushroom, onion and eggplant slightly before baking. This was a very satisfying dish and looked nice also.

This is a quick, colorful and healthy recipe. In a small variation, I used a red onion to add a little more flavor and color, and instead of making four stacks, I consolidated the ingrediants to make two larger stacks. These stacks were the delicious and fragrant centerpiece of a vegetarian meal for two--served along side a salad of baby spinich, mozzarella, and homemade spicy sweet-and-and sour dressing and a slice of crusty french bread. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this dinner, and I will definitely make the stacks again!

Some major yum going on here! The only thing I did different was to use a skewer to guard against slippage. Still slipped a bit, but I was glad for the help. This is staying in my favorites.

Found this by luck, planned on making mushrooms and eggplant and needed a recipe to combine the two.  very easy to make and tastes great.  We've been trying to cut the calories and I thought this was a great choice (without the cheese).
