Delicious.  I skipped the tomatoes but the ginger aroma was heavenly.  Very easy to make, i'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Excellent dish, VERY easy and VERY tasty! Thanks Charsiew! Reminded me of my childhood fish dishes, and my husband and family (who are not Chinese) absolutely loved it too.  One note: make sure you cook this in a dish that can catch all the delicious sauce (i.e. not a steamer with holes).

very good flavor, the only thing I changed was baking for 35 at 350 degrees my steamer was not big enough.

It does not say this in the recipe, but make sure that you put the sauce over the veggies, because otherwise the tomatoes and mushrooms are totally tasteless.  The fish turned out and was good, but it was not spectacular.  Then again, my husband and I have had lots of amazing, authentic Chinese fish dishes, so we are probably too spoiled.  :)

Great base recipe! I substituted things for what I had on hand (ground ginger instead of fresh, crimini mushrooms, and ~1/2 tsp. of fresh chili paste instead of the diced red chili). I also used more like 2Tbs of soy sauce istead of 1, and threw in juice of 1/2 lime. Huge hit! I chopped mushrooms and spread them out in a 9x13 pan with cauliflower florets (just to add more veggies) and lay the snapper over the top of them. Topped seasoned fish with diced tomato, and poured soy/sesame oil/lime juice/chili paste mixture over the top. 400 for 15 minutes. Sprinkled with the cilantro after. Delicious! Best white fish recipe!

This is wonderful!!  My family does not care for fish and they actually had seconds.  I do not have a steamer so I put it in a covered glass dish and microwaved it till it was done. We loved the ginger flavor.

Another healthful Chinese dish.  I liked the liquids imparted from cooking of the tomatoes, fish and soy sauce.  It was a good way to mix it up with rice.  The mushrooms were the best part, providing great texture and an earthy taste.  A versatile recipe to use with other types of fish.

Awesome!  Very flavorful, very quick.  So little prep time.  I was able to get dinner on the table with this dish, rice, and edamame in 30 minutes!

I was looking for something different to do with my tilapia and this was it! So good, not to mention a very healthy way to prepare fish. I did season my fish first and was very happy with lunch today. Thanks so much!

This came out light and flavorful and smelled amazing!  I only wish I had made more.  I used tilapia since snapper is so expensive here, and took out the mushrooms, since we don't like them.  I loved this recipe and am going to add it to my regular rotation.

I used 2 Roma tomatoes and a pack of shiitake mushrooms (3.5oz) and tilapia in a rice cooker.  We loved it. We steamed it for 25 minutes and will definitely make again.

I have made this several times, it works well with snapper, mahi mahi, and orange roughy.  I've also used different veggies, and since I like things spicy I add a couple sliced jalapenos.

Put all the ingredients on a ceramic plate so that all the juices catch when the fish is cooked.  The juices are pretty good on rice and the fish itself.

I love this easy dish. Ive had my fair shares of chinese food ( seeing that my mom is half chinese) but i could never make it as good as her. The only additional thing i did was that, i coated the fish with salt, pepper and garlic ( i love garlic. I put the veggies around the fish so that it could be coated with the juice and sauce :) Great stuff!

This was delicious.  Would definitely make this again but would leave out the red pepper because my kids like mild.

This was very simple, and quite tasty...I prepared it with Tilapia as it is also a very mild fish.  I will definitely make this again.

This was easy to make and good.  The complete miricale was that my three picky kids (ages 7, 4 and 2) all loved it!  I will probably make this again.

This was very yummy and super easy. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: I used tilapia, crimini mushrooms, campari tomatoes, added a clove of minced garlic, a tablespoon of dark soy sauce and chopped asparagus. Was filling and delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this again with cod and even though it was a thicker fillet it was overcooked. Will cook it only 10 minutes next time.
