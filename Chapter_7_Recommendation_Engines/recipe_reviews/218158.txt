This recipe was fast & easy and everyone loved it! It's a great new way to use all the things we normally have around the house already.
We cut the recipe in half, used honeycrisp apples instead of gala, used gluten free flour and omitted the wheat germ to accommodate my gluten intolerance and it was still delicious and enjoyable for all!

This was a delicious twist on apple crisp.  Our family had sooo many apples to use this fall, and we were tired of the same desserts.  This has a wonderful crunch and is simple to make!
