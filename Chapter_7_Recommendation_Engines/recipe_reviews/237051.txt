I loved this!  Very easy to make and tastes delicious.  I used to buy this at the deli at a local market and now I am happy to be able to make it myself.  I threw in a handful of sliced green onions and I also used fresh basil.  Wonderful!

Brushed thin slices of French bread with the oil. Placed a piece of cheese on each slice,  broiled at 400  until brown and cheese melted.

Fantastic! I did not use the roasted red peppers, but followed the recipe otherwise. I may add a little sprinkling of sea salt and coarse black pepper before serving next time. This is a great little appetizer, and everyone LOVED it...I will be using this recipe over and over~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for a BBQ, I put a cherry tomato a piece of fresh basil and then the marinated mozzarella cube on a toothpick. It came out nice. It is not the same as the mozzarella balls, only because I used a block instead of a log of the fresh stuff. I think it would be better using the fresh mozzarella. I was trying to save money as the marinated fresh mozzarella in the deli section is expensive.  But it is a great recipe using mostly pantry items and I will make again.

Good and it does need to marinate. We also put it over  hot pasta which was really tasty.

Really tasty!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Only thing I would change next time is use half olive oil and half canola, because I thought the olive oil taste was a little strong.  I will definitely make this again!
