I've been making this cake for years.  It's one of my childrens favorites. The only thing I do different is use a pineapple cake mix.  I'm making it today for Our St. Pats day get together.

I thought the cake was really easy to make, tastes good, but in order to get the frosting green I had to add a little green food coloring.

An amazing cake! I took three of these cakes to a church function and every single lady there took at least two pieces home! They said it was marvelous and had never tasted anything like it before. All the different flavors and textures went well together.

This was so ESAY to make and a great addiion to my daughter's St. Patrick's day feast at school.  The pistachio was actually quite mild and the pineapple added a nice texture to the whipped topping.  I added green food coloring to the topping to make it really green and a couple drops throughout the batter as well.  Good choice this holiday!

Everyone enjoyed this cake. It was so easy to make. That Jell-O brand pistachio pudding mix was perfect for the colour. I will definitely make this one again.

Good cake, and so easy . . .not everyone ate it, but we had a ton of food.  I have to say that cool whip is not that easy to frost, but the flavor is pretty good.  the green is there, although very light, so if you want darker, add the food coloring.  I didn't, though, and thought it was fine the way it was.  Thankds for the reicpe!
