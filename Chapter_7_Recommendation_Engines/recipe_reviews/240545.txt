I am so sorry, this was just not for us. I had seen at least 3 similar recipes made recently and decided to give this one a try. I noticed the others had a little arrow root, almond flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. They really need some type of flour consistency like substance. This also had an additional egg than other recipes I viewed. I thought it tasted like banana eggs. The ingredients do not transform themselves. I did add a small pinch of salt and cinnamon. I also used a little safflower oil, not being a fan of coconut oil tastewise to cook food. I am sure these would be fine to simeone that has had flour and grains out of their diet for sometime. Be careful, as they go from raw to near burnt in seconds. Cooking between a 3-5 is best.

I made these for my 7 month old and he loved them. Once I had gotten the hang of size and flipping the pancakes they turned out great. I did use the flax seed as well. Very yummy.

These were great especially for no sugar however I didn't quite like the texture so I added a quarter cup or whole wheat flour and an extra half of a banana. And to increase flavour some cinnamon and pumpkin spice. And I also use d some chia. Will be making this more

They were more like  sweet omelettes.  I would add gluten free flour or oats if I were to make them again.

loved them!  Sometimes I put in a tablespoon or so of flour, but I've made them without flour too and like them both ways.  I've never made them with the flaxseed, so you're on your own there.

The best part is that my 2 1/2yr old doesn't even ask why we're not having syrup, just wolfs them down.  Great, healthier alternative to "normal" pancakes.

I enjoyed these!  My daughter is pre-diabetic so we're trying to get her weight down.  Since she loves pancakes and I found this recipe...it worked for her.  She really enjoyed them.

These are very good, a fantastic part of a wheat free power breakfast. Having said that, I deducted a star because these are not your typical fluffy pancakes, these can be flat and perhaps almost rubbery for obvious reasons. They are still delicious and are a great base for modifications (adding lemon/orange/almond extracts, fruits, nuts, oatmeal, you name it...), but most definitely not your typical pancake- more like a glorified omelet/scramble. Have made this over a dozen times.

Just made this recipe. 1st batch was ok but lacked the consistency I like in a pancake. next batch I added flaxseed and coconut flour until the mixed thickens up. make sure to mix bananas until they are almost liquid consistency, then add your eggs and fold in your dry ingredients.
A word if caution they burnt very easy, once I got the hang of it my 3 year old loved them. will make them again.

My grandson can't get enough of these.  They come in very handy when he is in a picky phase.  And it's the only way he will eat eggs yet, at 17 months old.  I love them too.  The coconut oil gives them a whole other dimension of taste.  We don't even need syrup or other sweetener with them.

I added 3 tbs of  oat bran along with 1 tbs of ground flax seed and 2 bananas. I topped my pancakes with peanut butter instead of syrup. Very delicious! Will make again. Next time I will add some vanilla extract.

Delicious! Made just as listed. I highly recommend using the flax seed. It helps give them a firmer texture.

Banana omelettes. Not pancakes. I’d use less eggs and something to thicken the batter.

My wife and I just came off a Daniel Fast and wanted to continue our healthy trend. We made it but added a 1/4 cup of oatmeal ground up. Made it rise a bit and tasted less like banana.

I used cooking spray and added a packet of powdered chocolate smoothie to give it a chocolaty flavor ?????
The texture was a little bit different, but I liked it?? Definitely will make these again??

I'll start off my saying that they were difficult to flip, but maybe because I only used 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. I salvaged them by shaping them into a crepe looking things. I did add chia seeds because my mom won't stop giving me some and well why not! I really enjoyed them with some sugar free pancake syrup and nut sprinkles!  Also it's a great way to use that last banana that got way too ripe and you don't want to throw out because, lets face it, Mamma wouldn't approve of that. Haha... OH! I added a whole teaspoon of the vanilla extract  (by mistake but it wasn't bad) and a splash of mootopia (I needed for my chia to expand).  Just keep an open mind so that you don't miss the flour- I didn't.

These were absolutely amazing! It was so easy to make them too. My five year old daughter begged me for more. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the texture, but the flavor made that doubt disappear! Next time I'll add some chopped banana to them. They were delicious with organic maple syrup.

My husband was skeptical but even he liked them.  I didn't have flax seed so I didn't use that. I added a little cinnamon, very good addition!
These are not fluffy but they are packed with flavor!
I tried using spray oil, too much smoke, I went back to the coconut oil!

It was good but not great. Mixture was a little too runny so I added 3 TB of almond flour which helped the texture and gave it a slight fluff. I also added some cinnamon and omitted the flax. The coconut oil caused them to burn on the outside while the inside was still a little mushy so I just eliminated the oil and cooked it in a sprayed non-stick pan.  I will probably make these again.

These were so incredibly good.  The easiest way to flip them is to keep them small.  We love them.

I love this recipe! Often I make it without flax and it is still wonderful.  Topping it with walnuts and fresh juicy cherries and some flaked coconut makes it an amazing dessert.  Sometimes I microwave frozen blueberries and dump them over the top with pecans!  I have been eating sugar free and grain free for 3 weeks and when I need a pick-me-up, this is it!
