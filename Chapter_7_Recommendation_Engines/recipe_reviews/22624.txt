The oil does not absorb as much as I wished, but it is a tasty spin on pretzels. My guests admitted that they didn't like pretzels until they had them this way. I will make this again and had many ask for the recipe.

Good! I did use less oil and I ended up baking them for like 20 minutes because they were really greasy. The garlic and herb dressing mix is a nice change from the usual Ranch mix I use on pretzels. Thanks :)

I make pretzels similar to this, but my recipe calls for baking them in the oven on 275 degrees for 45 minutes and stirring them every 15 minutes.  The oil will absorb then.

I make this every year for thanksgiving. here are some modifications:

Instead of strawberry I do raspberry Jello and frozen raspberries. They help cool down the jello. Do make sure that the jello is starting to set up before you put it over the cream cheese layer. 
I also like to add canned and mostly drained pineapple chunks to the cream cheese layer. I love the extra fruit. 

Everyone loves this and sadly, I only make it for thanksgiving. I should make it more often!

Not sure how this made it into the low carb section, 15oz of pretzels has just over 327g of carbs probably need to adjust your nutritional info.

Like... SO EASY!  I am rating the recipe 4/5 stars, only because I reduced the amount of oil to 1/4 cup.  The finished snack was salty, zingy, not too greasy, and required no baking.  Thumbs up!
