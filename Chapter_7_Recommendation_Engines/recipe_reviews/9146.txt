OK, I know everyone's written about this recipe, but I just have to say that we NEVER eat turkey. I made this for Christmas last year (I was in a "traditional" mode) It literally fell off the bone. It was incredible. We devoured it. NOTHING LEFT.
  Since then, we've made it several times. Each time - amazing results. I have referred many people to this recipe. It's worth it's weight in gold!

I first reviewed this on Nov. 20 but after reprinting it since I lost mine went through the reviews again and decided to update since I seen some had some issues with it being dry and not browning.  I used a 23 pound turkey and replaced the water with chicken broth. I used the same amount of butter for the pockets, rubbed it with olive oil and I took the foil off the last hour so it could brown.  I also let the turkey rest covered with foil for 30 minutes before carving so the juices would flow back throughout the turkey. After transferring the carved pieces to the platter there was still juices left on the platter after the turkey was all gone.  That's how juicy the turkey turned out to be. 

Nov. 20th review:  This makes the best turkey, moist, tender, delish.  I found this recipe last Thanksgiving and use it to cook turkey year round. I do add quite a bit more chicken stock (personal preference) and make gravy with the drippings. Yummy

Wow, easy and great! And moist! Last year I made "Perfect Turkey" from this site, which required both brining and turning over during cooking. Don't bother with either! Make this much-easier and just-as-good turkey instead! The only changes I made were to put the turkey on a bed of onion, celery & carrot chunks, and to stuff a few pieces of the above plus a chopped apple into the cavity. None of these veggies are eaten, but they give the turkey and juices a great flavor. Don't use the cooking times in the recipe as my 20-lb bird took only 4 hours. (Also note that in ingredient list, "broth" is supposed to read "bouillon.")

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  I was raised a half mile from Cornwell's turkey farm outside of Marshall Michigan.  I can tell you that this is the closest you will get to their "secret recipe" from their restaurant.  The only difference is they soak their fresh turkey in a salt brine (2 cups salt, cover turkey with water - soak over night) before they cook them. Use home made or commercial turkey or chicken broth instead of the bullion and water, fresh chopped onion and fresh parsley in pace of the dried also.  Out of this world!

This was a fantastic turkey....I did change a few ingredients.  Instead of warm water I used half chicken broth and half apple cider.  I also reduced the butter I put under the skin.  This was a great juicy tasty turkey.  And the gravy I made with the drippings was one of the best I ever made.  Oh my bird was 13 pounds and it was done in just over 3 hours.  Five stars with my changes....thanksRobin!

My neighbor gave us a turkey, so I tried this recipe.  Very Good, but the gravy that I made from the drippings was really salty.

Quick and easy! I have made this several times, always with success. This year I tucked some butter under the skin, and also brushed the skin with a little vegetable oil, that helped crisp up the skin nice. I had a 24 pound bird this time so I just doubled everything. This is the only recipe I use!

Being a vegetarian I had never made a turkey before, this year I hosted my first Thanksgiving and of course wanted a turkey for my meat-eating family so I made this one (my husband cleaned it and pulled out the giblit bag --too yucky for me).  Everyone loved this turkey, it was so moist it was falling off the bone.  My only complaint about it is that it is so moist it is hard to remove from the roasting pan/rack, so for looks it didn't really make it to the table, but it was sliced up for the buffet and everyone loved it.  I made it in our  18 qt roaster oven and did not cover it with foil.  A complete success (except for presentation) and I'll probably use this recipe should I make a turkey again.

This was a great recipe but instead of using 4 cups of water I used 2 cups of wine and 2 cups of water. It was my first time making a Thanksgiving Turkey and it was fantastic. I had a 10lb bird and I would recommend using less liquid though for the smaller ones.

Loved this turkey! Mostly I loved how simple the recipe was and how quickly it cooked! The drippings turned out great and made fantastic gravy. I did add some chopped onion and an apple in the cavities for flavour

I think I printed off this recipe the first time about 10 years ago. Not even kidding. This is the only recipe I make! We get a moist, delicious turkey every time without fail. Whenever we have company, the turkey gets rave reviews. Everyone loves it. And I love not only how tasty it is, but just how easy it is. I will continue to use this recipe every year. :)

Very good, but like others mine was done in a little over 3 hours and the drippings were really salty. I will make again but cut down on the seasoning salt.

I brined the turkey for the first time this year.  I also made some wonderful gravy because of this delightful recipe.  Wonderful way to have a successful Thanksgiving dinner!

Made this for my first Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!!!!! My fiancee said that it was the best turkey he has ever had and everyone commented on how every bite was juicy. I used the best brine recipe from AR and brined the turkey overnight but other then that followed these directions exactly! Impressive and easy, a must for the holidays and any other time you need to impress guests w/out too much effort.

I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of decreasing the seasoning salt to 1 tbsp.  It was definitely the tastiest, juiciest and moistest turkey I have ever made!  My kids who don't normally like turkey loved it and even my picky bf said it was great!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe Robin C.!

we have about 4 turkey's a year, and i use this recipe every time. the last 3 thanksgivings we've had the family over here, and this has always come out falling off the bone tender and delicious. that's all there is to it, this is how to properly cook a turkey if you want a great turkey from your oven.

I made this last year and I made 2 this year. For a person that does not care for turkey at all, I ate an awful lot of it. It could not have been more moist and juicy. It also had a great flavor. I will continue to use this recipe.

I made this recipe for a small Thanksgiving celebration using a 5 lb. turkey breast instead of a whole turkey. Also, I used fresh parsley instead of dried and cooked it for 2 hours and 15 minutes. I could not believe how moist and flavorful it came out! This is now my go-to recipe for turkey.

Discovered this recipe last year and have made it several times; always get raves. Wouldn't change a thing, it's always moist and flavorful. This recipe is so popular with family and friends, I cook this in the summer in the garage or out on the deck in the electric roaster

This was REALLY good.I was a little scared to stray from making a "traditonal" turkey & was sceptical about using minced onion & seasoning salt,I thought it would be a little overpowering but it was just great!!The gravy turned out awesome too & it made lots with all the water/boullion that was added.I will deffinately make it this way again!!Very delicious & subtle!!YUM YUM.

This was wonderfully moist and tasty! We don't eat the skin, so I put all the butter under the skin, cooked the bird, and removed the skin afterwards. The meat was so moist, even the next day! No more dry Thanksgiving turkeys for us! Thank you!

This recipe was so easy to follow, and turned out awesome! I used a butter ball turkey and put it in the oven for about 4 hours on 350 degrees F. I used more butter than the recipe asked for and I used chicken broth instead of water. The turkey I had was 8 kg. Thanks so much for a great recipe, the turkey was gone in minutes!

This is a great recipe! Everyone loved it!  I had a 20lb turkey and so adjusted the recipe appropriately - I also cooked the turkey at 400 degrees for an hour and then at 350 for another 3 hours.  I used a stick and a half of butter and like another reviewer, really made sure the bird was buttered!  It turned out soo golden brown (I've posted a pic) - and was so moist.  I did add bacon strips on top of the turkey by demand of the family...this will be my turkey recipe from now on :)

Best turkey I have ever eaten, next year I'm making the turkey to take to my in-laws house. I added one clove of garlic and 1 tsp rosemary, but other than that I followed the directions exactly and it was moist and flavorful.

I did this for my first turkey and it was really yummy. I didnt have the boulion granules so I used 9 cubes and it made a great gravy and the turkey had good flavor (even my turkey-hating husband said it was the best he'd had). I over cooked it a bit so it wasnt as tender as I'd hoped, but that was my fault, not the recipe's.

I didn't used to love turkey, but now I do thanks to this awesome, easy to make recipe. I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect. My parents and brother's family say I'll be making the turkey from now on! With this recipe, I don't mind at all. Umm umm, tasty, tender, and golden, just the way turkey should be!

This made the most amazing turkey! I brined my turkey overnight first, then followed the recipe.  I was a little worried it might end up too salty when I forgot to cut the salt content of this recipe after brining, but it was perfect!  The only thing I did differently was to also add a couple of tablespoons of butter under the skin of each leg. So easy, no basting required and my small family devoured the entire turkey!  Will try making a larger bird next time so we might actually have some leftovers!

I've used this word to describe so many other thanksgiving recipes I used from this site but it definitely applies here. "AWESOME". Thank you Robin C, I never made Turkey before, but this one was SO juicy it squished out juice like some kind of fruit, and was very tender and well cooked. I stuffed mine with a medley of veggies, carrots, celery, fresh thyme, fresh basil, fresh sage and fresh rosemary and onion and a cut up lemon. I let the Turkey temp get to 180 f and the inside 165 f before I took it out. The skin was especially delicious and golden brown. I added a bit of paprika and garlic salt because I was panicking as I didn't have seasoning salt and this combination made sense for some odd reason. anyway, it didn't hurt. The gravy I made from the dripping was great. Oh, and I maybe basted it once or twice with only a tablespoon of the broth from the pan. Fantastic!

The best turkey I have ever eaten! In the past, I have purchased very expensive pre-cooked turkeys from various well known places in the Dallas, Texas area. They don't even compare or come close to the quality of this meal. This easy recipe helped me to cook a turkey at home without spending a lot of money. Everyone said that it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. It was moist and super tasty. The turkey literally fell off the bone while carving it. Guests who didn't even care for turkey, liked it. It was a store brand turkey (I actually got it free from a local store) and I used sweet cream butter. It was incredible! I highly recommend it. My only suggestion would be to prepare it the night before, slice it all up ahead of time, soak in the chicken broth mixture remaining in a glass dish, and keep refrigerated overnight. Just pop in the oven (covered with foil) to warm-up the next day or use the microwave instead.

I've been cooking turkey for over 30 years and this was the best recipe ever!  Canadian Thanksgiving and with some family home we all enjoyed it so much.  It turns out so moist, it melts in your mouth.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I am trying to omit butter, but saw this recipe and had two turkey thighs in the refrigerator. I knew they could be dry if not cooked properly, so put them in a casserole dish, poured homemade chicken broth over them, sprinkled liberally with fake butter powder, the minced dried onion, some Emeril's seasoning and a handful of fresh parsley. Baked for 1 hour 1/2 and it was absolutely devine. Very moist and flavorful. I may be dieting, but I don't feel deprived. Will use this again, even for chicken.

I just used this recipe for my first Thanksgiving turkey and the flavor was great. We had a 20-lb bird (the recipe is for a 12-lb bird), but I kept the same quantities of butter and broth solution. I did add some celery, onion, and carrots to the pan and in the cavity. I roasted the turkey breast side down at 425 for the first hour and then turned it down to 325, covered the bird with foil, and occasionally basted it until my meat thermometer registered 180 for the breast--this baking method was the recommendation in "The America's Test Kitchen: Family Cookbook." The only "issue" we had was that the bird generated so much liquid that I actually had to extract some from the pan while it was cooking because it was literally swimming in juices. While this was not necessarily a bad thing--lots of great broth for soups, moist meat, and a golden bird--next time I will follow the cooking instructions in this recipe exactly. I am definitely looking forward to making this turkey again and may try it with a chicken too.

I used this recipe 3 years ago and lost it. I am cooking Thanksgiving Dinner this year and searched the web until I found it. I always remembered the ingredients and I could not forget the compliments I received at the dinner table. The turkey came out very moist and flavorful. The recipe was very simple and fast. With this recipe the turkey won't have a chance to sit in the refrigerator for days waiting to be eaten.Definitely a winner!

This was wonderful!  I added some changes, but I believe the turkey would have still been great...brinded turkey (1 cup corse salt to 1 gal of water, 10-12 hrs) and injected it with 3T butter.  This also makes great gravy, just add flour.

This recipe was wonderful. I substituted chicken broth with a no-salt chicken version, and I used a salt free seasoning mix of 24 herbs and spices, instead of seasoning salt. I took another reader's advice and put my whole turkey breast in a slow oven 225 degrees and roasted covered for six hours, turning up the temperature to 250 about three hours before done. At an hour before I took it out of the oven, I uncovered and let it brown on top. This was delicious. It made a wonderful broth. I served it with a lo carb dressing I cooked on the range.Because of diabete I can't have other dressings. I also fixed a great salad. My husband and I really liked this, and I will definitely make again. The breast turned out moist. A suggestion: if using a breast cook breast down for a moist bird. This also works when cooking a full turkey. You have to turn right side up, of course, to get it brown.

This is a really great recipe. Been using it for the last few years of turkey roasting. This year, I bought a turkey that came without the temperature indicator "popper" by mistake and I had to estimate the cooking time of my turkey. To be safe, I roasted the turkey for longer than the estimated duration for the turkey size and it still turned out nice and juicy!!

This was my first turkey on my own - Celebrating Thanksgiving in Scotland - and this was a big hit with everyone!!  I made up my own seasoning salt (Beau Monde, Bay Seasoning, Garlic Powder, Salt, Crushed Black Pepper, Celery Salt & a few I don't remember the names of) but followed the rest of the directions to a "T"!  This will be my 'regular turkey' recipe for future Turkey Dinners.

This was my first attempt at roasting a turkey. I made this as written, except used turkey broth in place of the water and bouillon.  Also added a can of beer.  It turned out excellent!!! Thank you!

Easy, moist and good.  I used organic chicken broth, fresh parsley and onions.  Rather than discard the giblets, I simmer them in water with some onion, celery leaves, carrot, salt/pepper and use the resulting broth to moisten my dressing.  (Do not include the liver.)

I made this as my first turkey, and it turned out great! Everyone wants to come to my house from now on because the turkey was so good. I didn't change a thing from the original, and it was so juicy it just fell right off the bone when we tried to pick it up.

This was really quite good.  I would have given five stars, but the skin didn't crisp up.  Followed directions as written.  Turkey was done before time also, and I thought I over cooked, but it was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever made.  Will definitely make again, and will try with chicken too.

Absolutely perfect.  Suppose you can season to taste...but the trick with the butter will make the breast as moist as it can be.  Rave reviews from everyone that ate it.

This smelled delicious and look absolutely beautiful.  The meat was deliciously moist however it really lacked flavor.  I would recommend rubbing herbs under the skin to increase the flavor of the meat.  Other than that, it was fantastic!

Awesome recipe for  a wonderful, but super easy turkey.  This was the easiest to turkey to carve the meat literally fell off the bones.  I used my meat themometer and my turkey was done earlier than I expected.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good way to make a wonderful turkey.
We used this for Thanksgiving and let is rest almost thirty minutes before we sliced into it and it was so juicy and tasty that we will use this recipe again and again!

Loved this recipe.  Family loved it too. Paired it with the easy gravy recipe from this sight and it doesn't get any easier to make Thanksgiving dinner anytime of the year.  Thanks for sharing.  3/31/13: Update to my original review.  Making this recipe for Easter this year. I have been making this recipe for years now, I always use chicken broth in the pan, and just sprinkle the bird with onion powder and seasoning salt. I put the pan drippings into a big measuring cup and take to top fat part to make my gravy. I then freeze the rest of the drippings for making gravy for future meals.

First time making a turkey and it was very successful, putting the butter between the skin and breast meat made it so juicy! I will recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to make a delicious turkey!

I've used this recipe the last two years and always hear how juicy and delicious the turkey is.  I cooked a 22-pounder and a 13-pounder this season, both with great success.

This is the only way I will cook a turkey from now on!!  I've done it this way twice in the past few weeks and both times it was very tender and moist!  I did give the color a little help by rubbing Tom with olive oil and paprika.  Thanks!!

this is a very good recipe. I used this on turkey and chicken. I followed the recipe exactly except added a few sprinklings of garlic powder and baked in a cooking bag and took the meat off the bone before serving. I would absolutely recommend cutting back on the seasoning salt. The gravy was excellent just a little too salty.  I thickened the pan juices with flour and on one occassion added a jar of store bought gravy to stretch it out.

This was just o.k. 4+ cups of liquid in the bottom of the roasting pan seemed sort of odd. But then again, a baked turkey is almost foolproof with any recipe.

I used this recipe for my first turkey and it was **fabulous**!  Instead of rubbing plain butter under the skin, I used a parmesan garlic butter.  So good!  Also you can get the butter under the skin without cutting it -- just reach between the meat and the skin.

Added my own italian seasoning mixture, 2 cloves garlic with the warm water. I placed 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the butter under the breast skin. I did sprinkle just 1T seasoning salt over the turkey top. Turned out a wonderful Thanksgiving meal.

This is a great recipe  that is my go to for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This always gets rave reviews.  The only thing I do differently is use chicken broth rather than water and bullion. The whole family loves this!

I followed this recipe to make a turkey in my grandmother's clay dutch oven. I have never made a turkey before and was nervous I would do it wrong! Turned out to be the best turkey my husband and I have EVER had! The meat fell right off the bones. I had a 17.25 lb turkey and cooked it for 4.5 hours. The skin was perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and the meat was tender and juicy on the inside. I added sage to my butter mixture. I think the clay pot combined with this recipe will be my best kept secret for years to come!

I didnt actually taste it since I am a vegetarian however I heard It was a hit and had no leftovers so it must of been true. Simple to the point receipe. I did brine it the night before which I have come to believe is the only way to prepare a turkey theses days.

Simple and tasty.  Mine didn't turn out as moist as others raved, but still yummy and so much easier than other recipes I've tried in recent years.  Next year I'll try this recipe again, but cook it in a roasting bag instead of in a roaster tented with foil.

This was the best turkey, moist and perfect and it was just the cheap frozen one.  The difference is the broth, the turkey sits in a steam bath! It was a 20 pound bird, stuffed and only 4 T of  butter under skin. I also basted it every 90 mins.

Great recipe. Moist and delicious. My husband even admitted it was better than his father's, especaily the dark meat where the juices had gathered.

This turkey was very very moist! I am a first time turkey cooker and it was a really easy recipe. I used all fresh herb instead of the dried (the ratio is 1 tea dried: 3 tea fresh). I have to say, I couldn't taste the herbs that much. My turkey also wasn't very crispy, perhaps that was me...But overall, it was a really simple, stress free recipie that produced a moist turkey!

This is the 2nd year that I made this turkey.  It has been great both times.  The drippings from the gravy boiled down some.  When I tasted it was salty so I added enough water to make the 4 original cups and then added another glass full.  I also simmered the neck, and other parts and added that broth to the mixture too.  The result was one of the best gravies ever and a LOT of it.  We also buttered the outside of the bird.  It was wonderful.  Thanks!  PS Turkey cooked in Bellaire, MI.

This is THE BEST! I have made more turkeys than I can count, but none have been better than this one.  No need to brine, no need to roast upside down, no need to baste.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect and EASY!  Obviously the large amount of liquid combined with the tightly foiled pan allows the bird to be extraordinarily moist and tender. I took the foil off for the last 45 minutes of cooking and the skin browned up beautifully.  Thank you Robin, for making this and all future Thanksgivings easy and stress-free!

Very good and the stock made great gravy.  I will reduce the stock by 1/2 next time, at least.  Use the extra to baste with.  If you put 4 cups of stock in the pan with the turkey, it destroys any stuffing you might have put inside.  So glad I had extra dressing to cook seperately.  I would also put the dry ingredients into the turkey roaster and then add the stock.  Otherwise, a lot of it sticks to the inside of the measuing cup.

OH MY GOSH this made the most moist turkey breast I have EVER had.  This was my first Thanksgiving to ever cook a turkey and it came out SO awesome!  The only thing I did differently was to cook it breast down, and then flipped it breast up for those last 45 minutes to let it brown.  The skin wasn't super crispy, but the moist and tender breast was so worth that! Thanks a bunch!

This turned out to be the most tender & juicy turkey that I have ever tasted.  The meat just fell from the bone, was very fast and easy to clean up and put away after cooking.  Although I did not make gravy this time around, it did leave plenty of juices in the pan for those who do plan on making gravy or soup.  I will be sure to do that the next time I use this recipe for the upcoming holidays.  Great recipe!
