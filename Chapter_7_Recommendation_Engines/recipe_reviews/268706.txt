I used crushed Townhouse crackers instead of the corn flakes, mostly because I didn't feel like buying a box of corn flakes which I'd never use for anything else, and the recipe was delicious.  An easy way to combine 2 dishes in one.

The only change I made was instead of the corn flakes I used crushed pecans.  I should have made a double batch as this was so good I didn't have enough for seconds and thirds!

This came out much better than I expected. I got a little freaked out because there was a lot of excess juices in the bottom of the pan and I felt compelled to drain it all off, but couldn't without dropping the whole thing. But it came out delish and I added some more of the butter, sugar, and pumpkin spice sauce sprinkled over the potatoes and marshmallows on top of the cereal for that little extra something.
