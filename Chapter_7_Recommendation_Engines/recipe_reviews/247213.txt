I made this last night for dinner. As usual, I changed the ingredient list a bit to include what I had on hand. I am sure the original is just as tasty. I used sesame oil and added broccoli and green beans. I didn't have zucchini on hand. I was pleased with the level of spiciness and it has a great flavor.
