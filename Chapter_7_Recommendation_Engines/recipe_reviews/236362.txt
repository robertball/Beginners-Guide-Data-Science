I have made a similar recipe using Italian breadcrumbs and olive oil mayo instead of egg...it's a quick go-to recipe! I am giving this recipe 5 stars to cancel out the review below from "kdawg3511"...if you haven't tried the recipe you shouldn't be rating it, and what do you eat if not carbs nor protein?!?!

The chicken was moist and delicious. Very easy and I had everything on hand. I pounded out my chicken breasts and made them nice and thin which cut the baking time down by half.  I also served mine over a bed of spaghetti and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and fresh, chopped parsley.

I am cleaning out my freezer, fridge, and pantry for an upcoming move and this was a great choice for today's dinner.  Normally, I would make mine with a homemade sauce, but for what this is, it is great! I try to keep a jar or 2 of Ragu in my pantry for times when I don't have any of my own in the freezer. I will make this again.

This recipe was easy.  But the recipe had no Parmesan cheese in it so I added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and it came out great. I just felt if it was called Parmesan Chicken then it needed Parmesan cheese. For the sauce I used Bertolli cause I like that brand better. My son love it.

I'm giving it a 5 star only because it sounds and looks great and I am going to try this tomorrow. Also because I read the post that someone gave a one star rating because he doesn't like chicken!! If you don't like chicken you shouldn't even rate it at all. Go rate something you like.

I made this recipe twice now first time I used Classico Italian Sausage with Peppers & Onions Pasta Sauce it tasted awesome! No offence to author's choice of using Ragu but my tastes buds found it not very pleasing and bland tasting. The chicken was so moist and tender so I gave it 5 stars, even though I used another brand of sauce that complimented the simple recipe!

For me this recipe was not the greatest.  It didn't taste like any chicken parm that I've ever had before.  My boyfriend loved it, but this is not a recipe that I would ever make again :(

I made this tonight and it was fantastic.  I don't usually review but this is one recipe that I will keep.  Delicious, easy, and quick.  It calls for only 7 ingredients which is what caught my eye, but I simplified it even further;
Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the first 3 ingredients.  This recipe could easily feed a gathering of up to 10 people at the same time by doubling the ingredients. Ready within an hour: expect compliments.

My whole family loved it. The only thing I did differently is added parmesan cheese as well as the mozzarella. I'll definitely make this again.

Instead of using the oven. Using the stove top is just as simple! Laying four strips covered in spices and breadcrumbs for 7 minutes on each side. Then adding the sauce and cheese on and cooking additional time. Highly recommend. Something you can make for the family once a month

The chicken was very juicy and I liked it overall, but I would probably use a different sauce. I wasn't a fan of the old world kind. I usually use garden combination instead.

This is an easy three step process as long as you use Ragu or any other sauce of your choice. I dusted the chicken in flour, salt and pepper, browned the chicken breasts in olive oil and 2 teaspoons of butter. I put the chicken breasts aside and then used the oil and butter in the pan to cook  one half chopped onion, two teaspoons of chopped garlic. I added the bottled sauce and cooked it for 15 minutes and then added the partially cooked chicken breasts. Place the breasts in the sauce and put  a lid on the pot, cook an additional 15 minutes or until chicken is done. While preparing the sauce put your spaghetti on to cook. Place parmesan cheese on the chicken breasts, add as much as you like. Bring together the  spaghetti and sauce,  place the chicken breasts on the top of the pasta and sauce.  Enjoy!

I'm not crazy about chicken but using my own sauce and like someone suggested parmesan in the bread crumbs....my family was very happy and I enjoyed this. I would give it five stars but  no stars are showing up. In the review section. Tasty, moist and quick.

It turned out very well to be a last minute recipe decision. I didn't use Ragu like the recipe called for, but it still tasted great. I also used fresh morrazella from a cheese retailer and it melted wonderfully. I wished I added more cheese though!!! Will definitely make again.
