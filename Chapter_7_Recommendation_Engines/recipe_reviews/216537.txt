This was an easy dish to prepare, and had good taste.  I had to add more liquid, as it  cooked it up quite a bit.  Good aroma and good comfort food.

Really enjoyed this! Very easy and delicious. I did sub beef stock for chicken stock, just because it seemed to make more sense. The smoked paprika is key here - I wouldn't make this with regular paprika. I think the folks that ended up with gummy noodles missed the part where it says to add water to make sure the noodles don't get dry. I added about 2/3 of a cup, which may have been a bit too much but it all worked out. Without knowing anything else, my husband tasted it and said, "Yum! It's healthy Hamburger Helper!" I'll definately make this again. Thanks!

I was really disappointed when I had my end product with this one.  My husband is Polish and I really thought this was going to be like a paprikash,but not at all.   I thought the noodles were way undercooked and gummy because they cooked in very little liquid.  Also, there was way too much paprika.  Needless to say, I won't be making this again.

This dish was very good. However, I would cut back on the "Smoked Paprika" and only use 1 TB instead of 2. Smoked Paprika is far more pungent than the sweet variety. I would also increase the powered mustard by adding 1/2 teaspoon more

This actually turned out pretty good! I used evoo instead of butter and decided to par cook my noodles separately. Once the beef was browned I removed it and wilted my cabbage. In addition to the seasonings suggested I also added garlic and onion powders. The noodles and liquids were then added and I let it simmer until most of the liquid was absorbed. A great way to use up all the cabbage we've been growing! Thank you so much!!

I was excited when I read this recipe because of the smoked paprika.  I was disappointed.  I added some sour cream which improved the over all flavor.  But, this was just an average slumgullion to me.  It was also very under-seasoned to me in general.  I think the meat needed salt in the cooking.  Won't make again.

I agree with the reviewer that said it's similar to Hamburger Helper ... :/ ... I don't want hamburger helper ... 'Changed things, as I do, but not enough to make my review invalid.  I didn't use the hamburger.  'Wanted to try it as a side, & then as a main dish if we liked it.  'Don't understand why you'd reduce the chicken broth then add more water - so I didn't.  Just continued the recipe without reducing it.  I only added a cup of noodles & yeah, it needed to be thickened; but that was okay.  It looked cheesy with the paprika so the kids tried it - but "no go" on more than a bite.

Pretty good, but rather bland.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and it needed something more.  I have a large amount left over, so perhaps I'll add cheese when I reheat it.

Update: I've made this a few times and while the basic recipe is good, I made a few changes to add more flavor. I only use 2 tsp paprika and add other spices like Luzianne, garlic salt, and season salt - then ADJUST your salt.            Another important note: if you have a "paste" you made a wrong turn. DO NOT try a double batch - this is so easy as a single batch, just make it twice. Trust me

While this was a simple recipe, my family was not impressed. It is certainly edible, but has no real flavor. It's quite bland. Everyone ate it but asked that I not repeat it.

In an effort to make this a one pot dish, I skipped step one and started with Step 2, adding garlic (garlic goes into everything!) with the onion and added homemade stock, the cream and cabbage last and let it simmer until the cabbage was tender.  Using good hungarian paprika is key.  I used 1 tbsp hot paprika and 1 tbsp regular.  No noodles needed-they are just empty calories and lots of carbs.  Topped with some cheese, this dish was excellent!  The hubs said to "add it to the list".

Mark, this dish deserves more than the 3 1/2 Stars that it had when I made it.  This is the flavor that I love in food.  For me, I would add a little more noodles just because I like them.

I reversed, as suggested by another review, browning the ground beef & then adding the sliced cabbage before adding seasoning & then beef stock plus water.  A one pot meal. I used cubed cheese & sour cream, adding after the noodles were tender.  Subbing for the heavy cream was not by choice but because I was just using what was on hand.  It is delicious and am happy with this recipe.  Thanks!  Serving with slow cooker spicy black eyes on New Years Day.

I used ground Turkey instead of ground Beef. Steamed Brussels Sprouts instead of cabbage. Low sodium beef broth instead of chicken bouillon.  Added low sodium Worcester Sauce and garlic. Replaced heavy cream with sour cream.  Cut the paprika in half.sautÃ©ed the onions first with the ground Turkey, added the salt and pepper, garlic and half of the smoked paprika.

This was a good dish if you enjoy cabbage.  I pre-cooked the noodles before adding to the rest of the dish, and then added some of the pasta water to thin it out even more.  My husband isn't a huge fan of cabbage, and thought it was just ok.

Although not a big fan of smoke flavor, I liked this dish - quite unique.  I also used beef broth, added some garlic and used more cabbage.

I made this using mild curry powder (1 tbsp) instead of the smoked paprika.  Tasted pretty darn good too.  However, the dish was not visually appealing
