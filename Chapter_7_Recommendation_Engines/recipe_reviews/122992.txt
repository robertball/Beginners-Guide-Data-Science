Great flavor combination!  The tarragon was especially nice.  I added a diced tomato and a sprinkle of parmesan to the filling.  It was a delicious omelet.

I didn't quite follow the recipe fully but these still ended up tasting great. I used chicken marinated with Stubb's Chicken Marinade, 1 teaspoon of dried parsley because I didn't have fresh,celery salt instead of celery seed and then cut back on the salt used, and I didn't use tarragon at all. Despite these differences, the meal still ended up being quite tasty with some fresh pico de gallo on top.

This was very good and very easy. It had a nice fresh taste due to the onions and parsley. We added a little bit of mozzarella cheese, which made it hold together a little better. Next time I think I'll try adding fresh mushrooms as well.

This was a nice way to use up one lonely leftover chicken breast. I did add a small amount of leftover spinach too. Thanks!

A great way to use up some leftover roast chicken. I made one change, I didn't have any green onions so I chopped up a shallot and softened it slightly in the butter before adding the egg mixture. Also once the egg was pretty much set I popped it under the broiler for a couple of minutes just to brown it up a little bit, which is something I've always done with omelettes. Thanks for a good recipe.
