I think this would have been good as written, but I did change it quite a bit. I used crumbled polish sausage, didn't use the chicken stock, just the sauerkraut juice. I also added about a half cup sour cream at the end, and that gave it a great taste as well as the saucy texture of a regular sloppy joe. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for New Years Eve - Loved it too much!! We used the juice from the kraut instead of the broth, added a tsp of worcestershire, a little black pepper, and garlic salt. Excellent!!

Good taste.  Nice light alternative to bbq sloppy joes.  Next time I'll leave out the broth and include the liquid from the kraut and add the kraut at the last minute to keep the tanginess from cooking out.  I couldn't find kraut with caraway seeds so I added 1 tsp caraway seeds.  These are good on Rye rolls with swiss cheese.

This was easy/quick to make and had a lot of flavor.  It was hard to keep the filling on the bun.  I reduced the recipe to just one third and I got six sandwiches.

We reallyy enjoyed this and I made this per the recipe.  We had it on rolls with thousand island dressing and swiss cheese.  This disappeared quickly in our house.

Great recipe. I used a 4 pound pork roast as I had no ground beef, baked it, shredded it and put it in the slowcooker for a few hours with 1 quart sauerkraut with juice, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 onion and 3 celery stalks. No bell pepper. Nice change.

I made these for my Tuesday card club lunch and all the ladies liked them I found the joes easy to make and delish. I made half a recpie as there are 6 of us. I couldn't find sauerkraut with caraway seed so I added 1tsp. caraway seed with the sauerkraut. My only change next time will be the rolls the kaiser ones ( to  me) are just to much bread ( I'm not a bread fan). Thanks Laurie for a different sloppy joe that is oh so good!

Very tasty, but a bit difficult to eat. I did a third-size batch (with one pound of ground beef), and I took the suggestion of using some of the sauerkraut liquid with a little water instead of broth. Our fresh onion was getting old, so I used maybe Â½ tsp onion flakes instead. The taste was much like a cabbage roll (delicious!) but it needed sauce or cheese or something to keep it from falling out of the bun. My husband inhaled it, so I'll definitely make it again! Thanks for sharing, Laurie!

A nice base for a different type of sandwich. I couldn't find sauerkraut w/ caraway, so I subbed extra celery seed. Eliminated green pepper (wasn't in the mood for that taste), celery (since I used celery seed) and onions (used onion powder for flavor). Flavored the meat with seasonings while it was cooking. Used 2/3 ground turkey, 1/3 ground beef.

I had leftover sauerkraut. I didn't know what to do with it, so I loved the idea of ground beef and sauerkraut combo, but didn't have celery or bell pepper, so I substituted some chopped carrots and mushrooms during cooking, instead, added garlic and Italian seasoning to the mix, and then fresh, diced tomatoes right before serving them on toasted hamburger buns. (I also used the sauerkraut juice tip from other reviewers) My husband and I both loved them!

I've made this recipe several times and we absolutely love it! Don't forget the thinly sliced Swiss and marble/rye bread.
