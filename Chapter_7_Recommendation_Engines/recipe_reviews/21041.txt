After reading many of the reviews, I was suprisingly disappointed in this recipe.  The rollups didn't taste bad, they just weren't jawdropping awesome like I expected.  They really were kind of bland tasting like cream cheese mixed with salsa.  I even added in a litte taco seasoning for extra flavor.  After mixing it up, I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to blend the flavors.  I heated my tortillas for about 30 seconds in the microwave...if you do this it helps you to get a tighter rollup, which prevents the hole in the middle once they are cut.  I regrigerated them overnight and then sliced.  As I said, they were good, but they didn't quite meet my expectations.  The only way I would make again is if I need a last minute appetizer as I usually have all the ingredients on hand.  Otherwise, I'll go with a different recipe.

The FIRST time I made this recipe, there was nothing left at the end of playgroup.  The SECOND time I made them, I used two packages of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of salsa, and 1 small can of chopped olives.  They were gone before some of the moms had arrived.  I've also added sliced ham (ommitted the salsa) for a nice change-YUM!  I get constant requests for these as they're a hit with everyone.  Thanks' for a winning recipe!

This was so quick and easy!!  Everyone loved it.  I used three different kinds of tortillas.  i.e. MISSION sun dried tomato, spinach, and plain tortillas.  A beautiful way to display this dish with colorful variety.  (Just be sure to add a thin layer of mixture or the taste will be way too overpowering.)  Enjoy!!

I personally would have given these only 4 stars, because they tasted like any other tortilla rollups to me, but my guests devoured them and I got multiple compliments, so that's a 5 in my book!  I did add chopped black olives and some taco seasoning, and I used 1/2 cup salsa rather than 1/4 as recommended.  Even with the extra ingredients, I only managed to fill 7 tortillas!  I don't know how you would fill 10 tortillas, maybe if they were very small.  But they did taste good in the end!

I loved this recipe and so did all my guests!  The only thing I did different was add a little more salsa so it was easier to spread.  Also, you need to chop green onions very thin so you can spread nicely!  Yummy yummy

I was looking for an appetizer that wasn't a dip, and this seemed to fit the bill perfectly. It was gobbled up by my guests, children and adults alike. I definitely added taco seasoning and red peppers like others suggested, used a black bean and corn salsa--probably more than the 1/4 cup. Definitely a recipe that you can customize to your own tastes and I doubt you would go wrong.

Good recipe, but needs more cream cheese, and sour cream would be good, too, to give a creamier texture.  Angela

These are fantastic!  I was having a big party, so I quadrupled the recipe and put it on miniture flour tortillas and left them whole.  It made about 80.  These were the only thing NOT left over.  Everyone LOVED them!

These were very good.  The only change to the recipe was to double the salsa and add 1 oz. sliced olives (it gave them a nice color).  I made a double batch of the filling and ended up with 11 rollups.

This recipe is very good.  I think it needs a little taco seasoning mix and perhaps some Tabasco to add a little bit extra zing.

Made these many times... a hit each time. Some ideas I've tried.. spread one tortilla (Pesto and Garlic)  and one Sun-dried Tomato tortilla. Note:  Spread thin.  A little goes a long ways.  Put one on top of the other and roll.  Have used 3 spears of asparagus with the Cheese Tortillas.  This recipe is very flexible.  Don't limit yourself just to cheddar cheese.   4 oz cheese a little much.  Three was better.  For Salsa..I Bullet mine for those who don't want to see any green pepper or tomato chunks in the filling.  Adds a nice pink color too. I use Hot Salsa.  The cream cheese tones down the heat   while keeping the flavor.  Don't need to refrigerate to cut.  A bread knife does a great job cutting without squishing the roll.  You can make filling ahead of time but don't assemble til the day of the event.  They tend to go very gummy over a 24 hr period..not good.

To be honest, I did not make these the way the recipe stated.  I have been making these "pinwheels" for over 20 years now and I add garlic salt, chopped jalapenos, chopped black olives and shredded cheese.  I also add about 4 oz. of sour cream to mine.  I have found that 8 oz of cream cheese makes about 4 pinwheels.   I usually use 2 packages of cream cheese to get about 8 finished rollups.  I also wrap them in clear wrap or waxed paper and let them set in the fridge overnight before cutting and serving to get the best flavor.

Made these for a bridal shower and for a graduation party in the past 3 days.  I must of had 40 people ask me for this recipe between the two events.  These little rollups were a HUGE hit.  I took the advice of those who went before me and suggested adding a 1/2 cup of salsa instead of 1/4, and I also added about a teaspoon of taco seasoning.  It was FABULOUS!

If you have a jar of jalpenos handy add a little of the liquid to the cheese mixture to help with the spreadability and give a little extra kick.  Also warm the tortillas in a slightly damp paper towel in the microwave and keep them covered with damp towels during make-up this will aid in creating a tight roll.  Use a very sharp non-serated knife (a sushi knife works great).  This will prevent tearing.

I made this recipe for my Mothers of Multiples group.  They were very good.  The few that I did end up taking home my 11 yr old daughter finished.  I will definately make them again.  Very Easy

Good recipe but you need more salsa. I used a med. size jar of pineapple salsa and the recipe filled up 5-6 tortilla's.  Save some creme cheese to use as as glue to close the wrap. Enjoy!

Yum, I made a half recipe for my husband and I to try this out.  It was really good; I'm a big fan of the cream cheese/salsa combo.  As others have noted, this recipe doesn't use nearly as many tortillas as listed.  For a half recipe, I only covered one and a half tortillas rather than the 5 it should have covered.  However, I could have spread it thinner, but I doubt it would have made much more than 2 full tortillas.  Oh well, it was really delicious.  I'm just glad I did a "test run" before preparing for a party so I have a better idea of how much this recipe makes.  Thanks!

These were good little appetizers and quick to put together.  I'm usually not a cream cheese person, so in this recipe, I used the cream cheese with chive spread and added chopped black olives and red bell pepper for more texture.  I made these for myself since no one else in my house would have like them, but I thought they were really good.  Would make again.  Thanks for sharing Debbie.

These were one of the less popular appetizers that I took to a charity wine event.  They aren't bad, they just weren't out of this world awesome either.  Basically, I chose the recipe because it was easy & I could make ALOT of them for very little cost.  The only thing I changed was to add in a few dashes of cumin (after I read other readers reviews).  Like I said, these are pretty good but just not a homerun. However, if you are looking for something fairly quick and very affordable that makes a good quantity to feed a crowd then totally try it. Oh, and I had more than plenty of filling for 10 shells (make sure to get the taco sized shells as opposed to burrito sized, that might be why some people had issues). Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe like listed (except used 2 green onions, not 4), then added 2 tbs of sour cream, 2 tbs of fresh chopped cilantro and about 1/2 tsp of of taco seasonings. I let the mixture refrigerate over night. I prepared the rolls the next morning and refrigerated them for 4 hours. They turned out great. Very popular at the party!!!  * Used green spinach tortillas

I forgot about the green onions, but they were a hit anyway.  I used alot more salsa than was called for - about 1 - 1 1/2 cups.  And I also added quite a bit of cilantro which gave it a very fresh taste. Used sundried tomato and spinach tortillas and it made a VERY pretty display.

Everybody loved these! I used green tortillas instead for more contrast. I was planning for a larger group so I doubled the recipe (bought 20 10-inch tortillas)... but the doubled mixture only filled 8 tortillas! It made 70 individual pieces altogether. Maybe I used too much filling per torilla... but if you follow it exactly, you may need fewer than the suggested 10 tortillas (maybe only 4 or 5 to make approximately 35 pieces)
Very yummy but could use a little more "kick" of some kind. :)

I'm not seeing the best ingredient in any of the Tortilla Rollup recipes. Add chopped walnuts they really are great.Perfect crunch to them. I also add chopped jalpenos and no salsa in them but salsa for serving on the side. 09/16/07.... I wish this new posting would go to the top of the list!.... what a difference it makes to add walnuts!! I have ate MANY varieties of these through the years and seriously the walnuts really are  a great addition please try it this way I hope you enjoy the difference! I give it a 5 star with walnuts and jalepenos.

These went over well at a lunch buffet. I increased everything by 1/2 except the onion. I also added a half cup of sour cream. Next time I would add even more salsa for flavor and color. It was a bit bland for my tastes. Next time I will add more salsa and maybe some Mexican spices. Increasing by half, let me have enough filling for the 10 tortillas. I know several people said they ran out of filling.

Didn't care for this. Used green tortillas. The filling didnt seem to have much flavor. Probably wouldnt make again.

Made these as a last minute extra dish for a potluck and they were a huge hit. I added a little extra salsa, and only used 2 green onions. I only got 6 tortillas, not 10. I probably could have got 7 if I went a little thinner. I also heat them in the oven for 7-8 minutes before serving, and everyone just loved them. And they were so easy to make.

I have to say, almost the entire plate of these were left over after my party. Something about the flavor seemed very off, it was so tangy and "chemical" tasting. There are far better recipes of this type out there.

I agree with most of the reviews that this one was a little less than what I expected.  I took the advice by increasing the filling and used 12 oz cream cheese, about 4 oz of sour cream, doubled the salsa and shredded cheese.  It filled the 10 tortillas perfectly.  The filling reminds me of a dip that I make so I knew it would be good but the tortillas gave it a bit of a doughy taste.  However, it was still good and a hit among our guests.  I was asked to give out the recipe and make it again.

great with a little sour cream and taco seasoning added. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and lite sour cream. They still tasted great. Maybe about a fourth of a cup sour cream and a light sprinkling of taco seasoning. I also used jalapeno and cheese flavored tortillas which added that extra kick.

I followed the recipe and it was good and they went over well. I did make double filling and used tomato basil tortilla's and also spinach ones. I will make again but I will add some green peppers or red and more salsa and chopped black olives and some taco seasoning. Many ways to make different fillings. thanks for the base recipe. And make sure you chill them well before cutting them

I brought these in for a Halloween Potluck,and I received many compliments. I made them the night before due to time constraints as well as the fact the cream cheese mixture has to be room temperature to work with & i didn't want to "nuke" it cuz i thought it would change the consistency of the cream cheese. I justleft them uncut,rolled them in foil overnight and then right before serving the next day cut them into 1" pieces. They were pretty good/the tortilla was slightly soggy but still looked & tasted fresh. I made the following changes: I took others suggestion to add 1 tbs taco seasoning mix, took a piece of deli turkey & cut in half and placed on top of cream cheese mixture so the turkey slice covered the entire width of tortilla, then added finely chopped romaine lettuce to add extra texture and some color.  I think the next time i would use 12 oz cream cheese because was spread pretty thin. I was only able to assemble 8 tortillas with the 8oz cream cheese mixture.  Overall it was a good recipe and would make again, it's very versatile!  Thanks for the recipe

This recipe was quite tasty and very easy. I made if for a St. Patricks Day potluck at work. I used spinach flavoured Tortilla, added 1/2 salsa and 1 tsp of Taco Seasoning. I refidgerated it over night and it came out lovely. They were all gone and people kept saying how good they were. Next time I may add some refried beans too, I think that would be good too!

Made this for an office pot-luck and was a big success!  Minor alterations:  went easy on the onions and used combo of finely shredded cheddar and jack cheese.  Added more salsa cos I used the thick and chunky type--just enough to get good spreading consistency.  Got many compliments.

I made these for a party and they went over great.  While we were setting up I had to threaten my friend who kept stealing them.  You could keep them the way they are or use fewer tortillas and then they'll have more filling or add salsa if you like them spicy it's all a matter of taste.  I would definitely make these for another party.  Thanks.

I enjoyed this.  It was pretty cream-cheesy though.  I may add some milk next time and maybe a little more salsa.  I sliced the onion very thin and it worked out nicely.  I guess I like more filling because I only ended up using 4 10 inch tortillas.

Super easy! Huge hit at every party! Some helpful hints: the cream cheese definitely needs to be softened first. Also, I've found that it's best to wrap foil around the tortillas after they've been rolled up. This helps it maintain it's shape while refrigerating. I add diced black olives the mixture for some added flavor and texture. I normally use more that one package of cream cheese.

I make something very similar to this recipe, only I add chopped fresh and pickled jalapenos and either Frank's hot sauce or Tobasco. Occasionally I skip the tortillas and serve as a pretzel dip!!

I made these for a superbowl party and they were gone quickly. I added some sour cream, extra salsa, taco seasoning, and cilantro, yet I was only able to fill 4 tortillas as opposed to 10 like the recipe says. So I now have a bunch of extra tortillas to use, but they were delicious!

This is alwasy a hit at a party. Changes I made: Added chopped jalapeno black olives Mozzeralla cheese and sharp cheddar cheese versus plain cheddar to give it a nice cheese bite. ~ 2 green onions (tops only) as they get a bit over powering with the Salsa ingredients. Extra cream cheese and extra salsa. Delish!

These were outstanding. I added some Bacon because I had so left over from the broccoli cheese casserole I was making and I added some diced black olives and a nit of taco seasoning. This made a nice lunch time appetizer while we were waiting for the Christmas turkey to finish. My father in law (Mr. meat lover) said more bacon and they would be even better, but the rest of us really enjoyed them as is. Fast and easy when you're short on time. They did only make 6 10 inch tortilla's so plan accordingly.

I guess I forgot to rate this one the first time I made it. These are so yummy and everyone at the party I went to enjoyed them. There were a lot of appetizers there, and these were probably the first ones gone. I used chives for lack of green onions. This tastes MUCH better if you make it ahead put it in the fridge. I put a little extra salsa in mine and might try ham or shredded chicken next time. Thanks for an easy appetizer!

Yummy, this was really good.  I sampled the dip on corn chips also and that was good too.  I put in some crumbled bacon and the combination was great.

Very tasty.  Exactly what I was looking for when I searched for rollups.  Good consistency for making the rollups and good flavor.  Also great base for adding any extra ingredients that suits one's fancy.  I added some chopped deli ham just because I had it on hand.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe - used only 5 green onions, added 1/2 package of taco seasoning for depth and also added some fresh cilantro.  Made about 11 tortillas when doubling the recipe.  These were a big hit - they were the first thing gone!

Big hit at the party! Didn't add anything and people kept raving about them. The only (small) problem is that they're not visually impressive (pink cream on tortillas).

The best rollups ever!  I have made this recipe repeatedly for work and family functions and everyone loves it - I always get requests for the recipe.  At Christmastime I use red and green tortillas for a more festive look.  
If you like a bit more kick to them, add some taco seasoning to the mix.  This is an A++ recipe!

These turned out great! I took them to a gathering today and they were a big hit, they didn't last long at all! I just followed the recipe and did not add anything additional. I will say I doubled the recipe and there definitely was not enough to fill 20 tortillas, more like 12!

I thought these were pretty good and got eaten up quickly at xmas dinner.  I did add some chopped black olives and a little bit of taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested.  Also used low carb tortillas which worked out well.  next time I would add something crunchy to the mixture since it is so creamy, like some chopped red bell pepper.

This was pretty good. I doubled recipe and was only able to make about 9 tortillas. I also preferred using only half of what's suggested for green onion.

Loved it!  Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 cup salsa like some suggested.  I also added some canned jalepenos and chopped them up fine.  When I showed them to my husband, he didn't seem to impressed.  But as soon as he put them in his mouth, his entire expression changed!  He was amazed!

I have made this kind of recipe dozens of times but unlike others, I don't like to put the salsa inside the tortilla.  I use it as a dipping sauce for the tortillas.  My other variation is making it with cream cheese and black forest ham as a variation of the regular tea sandwiches.  Always, always a hit for presentation, ease of prep work and delicious every time!

These were excellent!!  But be warned, they are very rich.  I overstuffed mine.  You definetly can spread it on the thin side because it is so rich.  I added black olives and doubled the salsa as other people suggested. I also didn't have any green onion so I just left it out. These are so easy to make, travel well and don't have to be heated so they are great to bring to parties.  I will definetly make these again but I will use less filling in each tortilla.  I doubled the stuffing and only used I think 8 tortillas.  Way too much stuffing.  You couldn't eat too many of these made that way. Anyway, I will make these again and again.  Big hit.

I wasn't very excited about this recipe.  I thought is was a little bland.  I would add more salsa, maybe some olives or jalapenos to add more zing.  It was definitely easy to make.

These were really good. The only thing I would change would be to use this amount of filling for only 5 tortillas so that there would be more filling in each. Everyone loved them at a Christmas party I gave.

This is a very good recipe and met my expectations.  I like simple, easy appetizers with 4 ingredients or less.  I added some thinly sliced deli ham pieces to it, and next time I'll add a bit more salsa and probably chopped black olives to enhance the flavor.  This recipe didn't fill all six of the 10-inch tortillas however - only four of them, so you either need to double the recipe with the cream cheese or buy smaller 6-inch tortillas instead.  All in all my girlfriends enjoyed them and I had leftovers to share at work the next day.

Very simple rollups. No green onion so I used some diced yellow onion but added some diced green pepper for the green color. Added just a little bit of sour cream with the cream cheese.

I add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to each roll before rolling them up.  These things are addictive.  People clear the plate at parties.  Always a hit and easy to make.

Very quick & easy.  I added chopped black olives becau I was trying to use up a bunch of them.  I used mango peach salsa & that was yummy.  Also used whipped cream cheese which made for very easy spreading, but they also got soft quickly.  Next time I'll add taco seasoning for a bit more flavor & probably use reduced fat cream cheese instead of the whipped.  They were totally devoured by our guests & I'll make again soon just for family!

This is the type of finger food most people will go for.  It's good, but not especially wow.  I took the suggestion to double the salsa and I didn't add taco seasoning, but instead, cut up a chipotle chile and added it.  It added a lot of flavor and spice, but may be a little too spicy for some palates, so maybe for these people, just add 1/2 a chile or just 1-2 t. of the ancho sauce.  I could maybe only get 5 large wraps out of 1 recipe's worth of spread.  It's colorful and attractive and easy - so I'm giving it 4 stars.

Spread barely filled 10 tortillas.  As a result, rolls were very small and made tiny wraps.  Cute for snacking, but not what was intended, or illustrated by the photo.  Also, a little heavy on the green onions.

It's taste pretty good but it's missing something... a protein or something. It would probably taste good with turkey, ham, or roast beef life a sandwich rollup. It was too much with just the spread and tortilla. The spread does not make 10 tortillas either... a little less.

My kids didn't like them, I didn't like them. The only thing that was great about the recipe is the versitality of ingredients you can use. I may try a sweet version with a strawberry cream cheese and chopped banannas or other fruit.

I love tortilla roll ups.  I made mine a little different than what this recipe calls for.  I used two packages of cream cheese, used the onions and I added chopped black olives and chopped green chilis.  If I have it, I'll had chopped deli ham as well.  I let mine refrigerate for at least an hour before I slice and serve.  I don't use the salsa or any taco seasoning or cheddar cheese.  I think it's just a matter of taste.

I made this for Christmas eve.  I don't know if I used too much of the cream cheese mixture, but I could only fill 4 tortilla shells, next time I will double the batch.  It was delicious and everyone really liked it though.  I set out extra salsa to dip them in, but everyone said they were great without anything else.  I will definitely make these again.

This is a great party appetizer.  I’ve made them for dozens of parties and have gotten great feed back.  I’ve upped the salsa to 1 cup and cheese to 1 to 1.5 cups for a thicker spread.  Also this you have more spread because the first few times I would run out.  After chilling for 4 or so hours, I cut them up and serve them with a side of salsa (for dipping).  Thanks for the great appetizer recipe.

Brought these to work for our Halloween luncheon. Made exactly as written with the exception of using Burrito size Tortillas. This made three wraps which I cut into about 24 small rolls. These were a hit and were gone in about 5 minutes! Definitely a keeper!

This was a splendid recipe! I was looking for something fairly simple and uncostly, and I finally found the tortilla roll ups. They were the first thing to vanish at the bring a dish gathering, and I had several people ask for the recipe. I used 1/2 cup of salsa, and added some taco seasoning for a little extra zest (as recommended by other reviewers). I also found that I could only fill up about 6 tortillas. Simple fix:double your recipe. You will be glad you did! :)

Very good!  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the salsa and added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning. Without this, they were a little bland. I think that I will also double the shredded cheese next time.

I made this for the first time a year ago for my high school reunion. I made enough for 150 people, and they were gone within the first hour! I have made them many times since for many occations, and everyone, including my children, love them. It's also a fun recipe for kids to help make. My 8 yo loves to cut the tortillas into the "pinwheels." Great recipe!

I thought these were pretty decent. I didn't add the onion because the chunky salsa has plenty. I think the key is to use a good thick salsa, not homemade. It was lacking something but I'm not sure what, maybe a can of green chilies. Next time I'll try these with added some taco seasoning to the cream cheese. THanks

I made this for a birthday carry-in at work, and they were all eaten within a couple of hours.  Two people even came and asked me for the recipe at the end of the day!  I did double the salsa as some other reviews suggested, and added a dash of taco seasoning.  I only ended up with enough for 6 and a half tortilla shells even though I spread it really thin.  If you are having a larger group you should double it.  I will definately make this again!

Very easy & quick to make & tasted very good, used the green spinach wraps (looks really pretty next to the red salsa to dip it in)served with salsa on the side as others suggested. There were none left, thank you!

good recipe for a party snack - may need a bit more cream cheese or maybe sour cream but very tasty.

After reading the other reviews, I thought I'd add more flavor right off.  I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of the cheddar, left out the onions, added finely chopped green pepper, 1 small can of chopped black olives, 1/4 c salsa verde, and added a generous sprinkling of Mrs. Dash's "Tomato, basil, garlic".  After my official taste tester (hubby) sampled the recipe, it was a hit. It's on it's way to the Super Bowl party as we speak!

These were edible, but my guest didn't really take to them.  I think maybe the cream cheese taste was too dominant.  If I ever made them again, I'd probably use half cream cheese and half sour cream.

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit, there wasn't a single one left! I doubled the filling, but not the tortillas. Can't wait to make these again!

These were wonderful...I would double the receipe but not the tortillas and make sure you spread it thick on the tortillas and go all the way to the outside of the tortilla when you are spreading the mixture on otherwise when you cut them, the ends will have no filling in them and you end up throwing that part away on each one.  Will definately make again....

I made these for a baby shower and thought that they needed a little more filing, but were still great.  I made them again for a family function, but this time doubled the filing and they were a real hit.  I will be making these for occasions in the future

I used this recipe for a Mexican Theme for a Gourmet Club and I thought it was delicious. However, I thought it was a bit plain so I added some fresh parsley, cucumber, celery and avocado to taste. My spin off is much better but this recipe is great for starters.

These are good, just not what I expected them to be from reading all the reviews. It just seemed like something was definetly missing. Even added taco seasoning,olives, and used mild salsa, but it still needed a little help. Maybe refried beans or some kind of meat(ham or chorizo) could gives this a little kick that this need. Might try this again with a 
little tweeking.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at a New Year's Eve party!  Very easy to prepare, although the cutting into bite-size pieces takes a bit of time.  Definitely be sure to allow this plenty of time to get cold in the fridge before cutting.  I actually combined this recipe with one of the other tortilla roll-up recipes....rollups IV, I think.

These were very good.  I added chopped green pepper, which gave them a nice crunch.  I used a hot salsa, but since it was spread so thinly, the rollups weren't very spicy overall.  I might try spicing them up a little more next time.

My friends were not really into this recipe. I served it at a party and only a few pieces were gone. They said it was too creamy and rich. Not enough texture and I even added diced bell peppers. The people raved about the cucumber sandwiches and restaurant style spinach and artichoke dip (both on this site).

Try making more than it says.. maybe double the recipe so you can spread the cream cheese mix on thicker.  I put in a little bit of taco seasoning also.. Helps a LOT.. Put more salsa than it says to make it softer.

I needed to take a “party food” to a small group gathering, and these went over well. Very easy to put together the night before and then cut into slices the next day. I served them with extra salsa on the side.

Everyone loved these at the party! I did increase the recipe and add a few extras. I used 2 packages of cream cheese, a little taco seasoning, some chopped sweet onion in addition to the green onion, a little garlic powder, a few drops of Louisiana hot sauce and a few chopped black olives. It sounds like a lot of changes but it was just adding extra goodies to the original recipe and making it bigger. Excellent appetizer, in fact I have a request to bring it to another party next weekend. These are actually fun to make.

Made this using the recipe as stated. Very easy to make and very tasty! Used10 inch tortillas and cut into bite size finger foods. Will make it again, and maybe experiment a little to see if adding ingredients adds taste, but this is good as is.

This is a very easy recipe. Great last minute appetizer. To add flavor I added 2 teaspoons of chili powder.

Very tasty! I used spreadable cream cheese, doubled the amount of salsa and added 1 tbsp of taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture.  Received favourable comments when I took this to a finger food potluck.

I made this with reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sharp cheddar. I had left over 6 inch tortillas and they used it up nicely. My husband said that he still likes the party pinwheels better since these seemed a little bland but I liked them and so did my toddler.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. the only thing that was disappointing was that the ingredients only spread thin 3 - 10 in tortillas.

These are really great tortilla rollups; after reading some of the comments, I did add extra salsa and some taco seasoning.  I also chopped up some fresh cilantro for an extra zing.  My tortillas were a little dry, so before spreading the mixture on, I warmed them in the oven, wrapped with moist paper towels and they rolled up perfectly.  Excellent!  Incidentally, you would have to spread the tortillas VERY thin to get ten; I managed to get four, and I thought they had just the right amount of filling.

I made this for a work pot luck and it was very popular.  I did change the recipe a bit by leaving out the onions and adding 1/2 a pack of ranch dip mix to the cream cheese.  Very Good!  I followed the measuring instructions and I was able to fill 6 large tortillas.  I will be making these again!

These were really good. Very easy and yummy. Only thing I did different was that I used less green onion and I didnt have enough cheddar so I also used some monterey jack cheese.

Took these out in the boat Memorial Day weekend for snacks. They were great! I used Jalapeno Cheddar wraps instead of flour tortillas to add a little more flavor. Perfect summer snack!

Good as is but this is just a starting point to add anything you wish to suit your tastes. Reminds me of pimento cheese spread. Nice presentation, I plated them on a small platter with a bowl of salsa for a little extra zing.

I thought these Rollups didn't have enough flavor. I think adding ome sour cream and Mexican flavoring might kick them up a bit, but I probably wouldn't bother making them again. However, some of my guests did like them.

These were not fantastic, I am sorry to say.  I was so hoping that they would be! I added ham to try to add to the flavor, but they were still just a little off.  Dipping them in hot salsa helped, but I think that was only because it covered the taste of the cream cheese!  Very easy to make but just not a great taste, unfortunately.

These are pretty good and they all got eaten at our football & poker party today. I thought they had a slightly odd taste, but everyone seemed to like them so I'll go with 4 stars. I did chop up a jalapeno and throw it in with the medium salsa I used. Thanks!

Easy, good, guests enjoyed.  Definitely didn't use 10 tortillas!   I stretched the mixture to fill 6 tortillas and wish I would have spread the mixture a bit thicker.

This turned out to be a very good recipe.  My guest really seemed to enjoy it.  I felt like it needed a little more flavor so in the future I will use more salsa, probably double what the recipe asks for.  Also, when I serve it I cut off the ends, since it didn't have a lot of the good stuff.

These were EXCELLENT!!!  I added jalapeno peppers (from the jar) to these just to add a kick.  I made them for a party and they were gone very quickly! AND, everyone asked me for the recipe!!  This is definitely a crowd favourite!

I've tried making these before with just the cream cheese and salsa but I think the green onions really made a difference.  Referidgerating them before cutting is a definate must as I found the hard way with prior tries.  But, I made them for a little casual get together with friends and they were the first to go.  Another one I'll be making again and again I'm sure.

Great recipe! Simple and easy.  These were the hit of a recent potluck.  I used sharp cheddar and 1/2 c salsa instead of the 1/4 c. so the filling was more spreadable.  I was able to use 9 out of 10 tortillas.  The only problem was there were no leftovers!  I'm anxious to use this versatile recipe again and experiment with different fillings.  Thanks from another Debbie.

I made these for a housewarming party, and they were a huge hit.  I used cheese-flavoured tortillas for added colour and medium salsa for dipping.  I pesented them on a platter in a dominoes formation.  Rave reviews from all!

These are SO good!!  I have a similar recipe that I have always used, but this one is much better.  I will admit that I was skeptical while I was assembling these because it looked like there was not enough filling...the amount on each tortilla is quite thin.  However, that is what makes these good.  They are not so overwhelmingly rich, as my other recipe is.  Perfect just as written.  My 8-year-old, who tries everything but doesn't like most things, could not get enough of these.  Thanks so much!

Yummy recipe! I did the following variations; 1/2c salsa(I used a Southwestern Corn&Bean type). Used 5 green onions and added a couple tablespoons of chopped green chiles and a couple tsps of mexican seasoning. Had everyone asking for the recipe. Will be making this again real soon!

Nice appetizer.  You can change the flavor just by using different types of cheese.

We thought these were a little bland.  Will try again adding some garlic powder and use extra sharp cheese.
