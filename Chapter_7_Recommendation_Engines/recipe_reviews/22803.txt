Oh, these are so chocolatey!  I thought this was too much chocolate, but after letting the cookies cool completely, it was a wonderful chocolate taste. I used milk chocolate chips instead of a bar, and chopped up some whole almonds I had on hand.  I made a batch with no almonds, and the rest with almonds.  I like them much better with the nuts, it balances out the chocolate flavors.  I think it would be safe to cut back on some of the chocolate in the future, a little bit of each.  I will make these again if I ever am in need of a super chocolate fix!

These are great!  I toasted my almonds on foil in a 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes.  You can mix and match they type of chocolate you use depending on what you have on hand.  I used milk chocolate chips instead of cutting up the squares.  They have a fantastic consistency, both chewy and crispy, so good.  UPDATE:  Had to come back and say that I made these for Christmas cookies this year and they were the biggest hit out of everything.  I just rolled them into 1" balls and baked for smaller cookies to add to my cookie tray.  FANTASTIC!

This is a good oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I prefer bigger chunks of nuts so I did a rough chop on whole almonds. Thanks for the post.

Excellent. I used maple syrup (the good stuff) instead of vanilla extract.

These cookies are delicious!  I used half butter half margarine, and just a little bit less sugar (I didn't pack the brown sugar, and used just a tiny bit over 3/4 cup white sugar).  Amazing cookies.

This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes ever!  I made it for my husband and he loved that the cookies came out more crispy than chewy.  I used M&M's for the milk chocolate in the recipe and they worked wonderfully.  The oatmeal just makes it better!  Try these-you will love them!!!
