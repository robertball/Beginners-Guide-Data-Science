Delicsious recipe w/ Daiya cheese   .I wanted to clarify an earlier rating.  Cheese made by Lisanatti is NOT vegan.  It contains casein which as derived from animals.   Daiya is 100% vegan.

It's yummy! I replaced the soy milk with water and it was great.... Oh also I added the juice of two small lemons cause I love lemon juice.   P.S. The vegan cheese you use matters I used Lisanatti foods- Almond mozzarella style cheese this with the lemon juice is what made it better than crack

OMG this is VERY good. Best vegan alfredo ever!!! If I could give this 10 stars I would. I love the sauce uncooked too as a dressing, dip etc.

Made per recipe though used almond/cashew milk instead of soy.  Very tasty though tasted even better over brown rice!

This was excellent! The non-vegans didn't care for it but what do they know? Sauce was a little dry/thick but I used extra firm tofu so maybe it was that but in the future I'll either add more soy milk or a few tbsp of vegan butter to help the consistency.

I used broccoli instead of cauliflower due to market availability and added mushrooms , otherwise following the recipe. I'm not a huge fan of Alfredo in general but I thought this was pretty good. I'll be making it again with cauliflower next time. Good vegan recipe!

Would have given it more stars if not for me messing it up. I accidentally grabbed daiya sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. Gave it a sharper (obviously ) taste.  Will make it again and try to get it right.  Otherwise, not too bad.  Very filling.

I found this recipe to be delicious and so creamy. It is hard to believe it is vegan.
