Eggs, goat cheese, and Sriracha, yum!  I added the Sriracha with the egg mixture. The flavor is unbeatable and the texture is smooth and creamy. Thank you for this awesome brunch recipe. It serves well with a bloody mary.

Delicious... the goat cheese is subtle, not overwhelming. Add a tiny bit a lemon at the end of long with the sriracha

I liked this recipe a lot.  The only things I changed were that I added Adobo seasoning, something my family always does to eggs because it's so delicious, and only whisked in half the cheese.  I added the rest when they were almost done in the pan so when they were served there was multiple textures, because who doesn't like melty cheese? Great recipe overall.

I didn't add the goat cheese and I used bottled chives instead. I liked it the way I did it and I hope you guys can try it too!
