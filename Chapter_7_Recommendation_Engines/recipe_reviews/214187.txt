Several months ago before you posted this as a recipe, I asked if anyone had a Buttered Rum recipe in the exchange. You were kind enough to write the entire recipe out on my post. I tried it, I loved it and now I'm happy to see that I can rate it. I realized you posted it when I went to review your awesome shrimp salsa. Please WW, keep the recipes coming! :-)

I think I'm coming down with a cold so I was looking for a warm drink with a little kick that might help this sore throat and general icky feeling I have. I didn't have creme brulee flavored ice cream but I did have Ben and Jerry's cinnamon roll ice cream so I used that. Otherwise, I kept it to the recipe only using Captain Morgan's spiced rum because that was all I had on hand. This was awesome. I'm actually getting ready to make another one right now!

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Love it.  I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Vanilla Rum coffee creamer instead of icecream.  It turned out fantastic, will definantly be making another one!!

Hmmm, well Ive never had hot buttered rum before this, but I find it very watery as is. The second time I tried it, I used hot milk instead of water, which was much better. I guess that's not very *authentic*, but the hot apple juice alternative that people have mentioned sounds terrible. I suppose I should try it anyway before I give up on hot buttered rum altogether... Added later: Forget water or apple juice. Use hot coffee!!! Mmmm!

Yummy. weathered turned cold and I was looking for a something to warm me and this was the perfect drink. I used coffee ice cream and that  does the trick too. I suggest trying different flavors of ice cream.

This tastes great so I gave it 5 stars, but I almost gave it four since I changed things...  I found the finished drink to be too small and weak so I doubled it and then added an extra shot (that way it fit my cup ;]).  I also used all brown sugar and vanilla ice cream, and whisky instead of rum.  Can't wait to share the recipe and try ti with hot apple juice instead of water!  Thanks for sharing with us!!

This should be double cup hot buttered rum.  There is no way I could drink just one of these.  Fantastic recipe!

I've been sick for a couple of weeks and just found out I have pneumonia...with strict orders to rest and get plenty of fluids.  That's what the doctor ordered.  Friends just kept saying that I should have some whiskey, which got me in the mood for a hot, alcoholic drink to soothe my congestion.  Hot toddy's seem a bit much for me, but this recipe was perfect and my husband made 4 of them for me throughout the day yesterday.  We only had pumpkin flavored ice cream and chose spiced rum, which added a nice fall twist on the recipe.

I barely tasted the alcohol and never felt it and today I don't have a hangover in the slightest.  Maybe I'll make myself another cup now. :)

I don't like things too sweet so I skipped the confectioners sugar. All I had was butter pecan ice cream, which worked very well. It's perfect!!! Thanks!

YUMMY!!! I used 2 ounces instead of 1.5 ounces of Captain Morgan's rum and that was the only change I made. This is super easy and really delicious! :)

Delish.  I used Skinny Cow dulce le leche ice cream.  The addition of the ice cream at the end cooled it down a little too much for me.  I popped in the micro for 30 seconds and it was fine.  I would suggest stirring up the ice cream before adding it to warm it a little.

Fantastic! I was about to experiment on small portions of hot buttered rum batter myself. This has saved me lots of time :-) I used clotted cream ice cream and it was divine.

Thank you for creating a 1 cup version of this!  I needed to tweak this a bit due to refined sugar sensitivity.  I subbed agave syrup for both the brown and confectioners sugar.  I didn't have any nutmeg left after Thanksgiving, so I did without.  All in all, IT WAS DELICIOUS.  If I get around to tracking the exact way I make it next time, I'll let you know.

This was my first cup ever of hot buttered rum and I thought it was delicious! I used French Vanilla ice cream since I couldn't find Creme Brulee. Next I might try it with hot coffee as one person suggested. It is a real good warmer-up on a cold, rainy day; thank you for this yummy recipe!

This is a superb recipe. I am now working on my second mug.  Lacking the crème brûlée flavor, I tried mixing in a bit of powdered cocoa.  Alternatively, as noted by Mark Bittman in his cookbook, when nothing else is at hand one can get the "brûlée" part by blasting some sugar with a propane torch until it bubbles and browns. Then, add cream and presto: the crème brûlée ice cream effect.  Happy New Year!

Just the thing for a snowy Nrw Year's eve. I used Vanilla ice cream ('cause it was there), and a healthy double of Meyer's Dark rum. I'm gonna work out a way to prepare this one on my Jetboil stove for XC ski outings. ByeBye! S.

I was quite surprised with the ingredients but it turned out really delicious and I was very pleased with the recipe!  I did not have any dark Jamaican Rum so we used a golden rum instead.

Wow!  I didn't have any ice cream but used cream and a dash of vanilla extract.  I also just used plain old rum but what a good drink!  If I'd had hot coffee I would have done that!  Amazing!!

I was so glad to find this single cup recipe. I used 2 tb Appleton Rum (because it has nice flavor) and plain vanilla ice cream. It was delicious!

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this, and I especially like that it's a recipe for a single serving, so I didn't have to commit to a whole container of ice cream's worth in case we didn't like it.

My only complaint is that, like others, it was just a tad watery to me. I might try using more ice cream next time, or maybe milk.  Still, it's a great base recipe.  Thanks for posting!

This recipe is fantastic for single servings of hot buttered rum.  As with just about any recipe, you'll want to flavor to your preference, and what I think is great about this recipe is that it is so flexible!  Probably don't add any additional butter, but play with the other ingredients to make your beverage as sweet, spicy, or high alcohol as you prefer!  I used probably about two shots of spiced rum (bottom shelf), a bit extra brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, and vanilla ice cream instead of the fancy stuff suggested.  I really am impressed with how it came out!  Great recipe to hang on to.

OK, this was spectacular. Being vegan, I like it with earth balance butter and non-dairy ice-cream. A light grating of nutmeg over the top.... oh my oh my this was GOOD!

Thank You! This was the first time I tried this and it was nice to find the single cup recipe, I didn't have the right ice cream but, the coffee fudge ice cream worked just as good. 
Again it was Buttery Good!

This is really, really tasty, and I didn't even have ice cream to add. Instead, I used cream (and Captain Morgan Spiced Rum). It was perfect, except I tripled the recipe and it barely filled two mugs for my husband and me. Definitely double it for one person.

Made no changes except more icecream.  Oh, and rum.  May be the best hot buttered rum I've ever tasted, let alone made.  Yay for the single serving!!

I didnt have ice cream, so I just used whole milk with a little splash of vanilla instead of ice cream and water. I used cruzan black strap rum which is really really dark and it turned out good. it was pretty strong, but I think that's kind of the point of this drink

We didn’t have any ice cream on hand, so we substituted it with 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, and added a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla.

This recipe lends itself to adjustments very well! I used what I had on hand: Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and frozen whipped cream instead of ice cream. Only used brown sugar, omitting the confectioners sugar. Two oz of rum :) So rich and creamy and delicious!! I was feeling icky but no longer after one of these!

This was SO yummy on a cold winter night! It was good to find a single version of this drink since I've only seen the ones that make a huge amount. I just doubled it, and it was perfect for a regular-sized mug. I used milk (for a nice and creamy result) and only used brown sugar (no confect), and it was the perfect sweetness. I highly recommend this!

Very good base, I changed things because I didn't quite have everything. I used coconut rum and vanilla ice cream then added a healthy splash each of Baileys and half and half. Yummo!

This is my first time having hot butter rum! I must express how important it is to: mise en place before you start cooking or making anything in the kitchen. I realized after I started drinking my drink that I forgot the nutmeg and cinnamon two crucial components to this drink!!! After I added that I thought I was on cloud nine!!! It was so good. Definitely making one before bed tonight. Might even make the full batch and save some. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

Quick and easy.  I didn't have ice cream so I just added cream and vanilla.  I used the stevia brown sugar and the stevia baking sugar instead of the regular brown and powdered sugar.

I am lactose intolerant and didn't have any ice cream so I added almond milk creamer instead.  Then I heated up my almond milk instead of water.  It was terrific.

So good! Have a terrible cough nothing is calming it down. Someone suggested a hot toddy. So I looked up the recipe on my favorite site. Only had coconut rum and used vanilla coffee creamer as I didn't have any ice cream.  It was delicious!

This was exactly what I needed for this -37C weather!  I used salted caramel ice cream (closest I could find) and Kracken rum since I had it on hand.  Will definitely try again using hot coffee instead of hot water!

I doubled this recipe for a big mug, added a little cinnamon, and I didn't have ice cream or dark rum,  so I used Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Crem Brule coffee creamer. Yum. Warmed me up on this cold night.

Cold winter night and I wanted a hot drink with a little kick, and this was lovely. I substituted granulated white sugar for the confectioners (it's what I had) and I used coffee ice cream (again, that's what I had). It was delicious and warming and wonderful. I'm off to make another!
