OMG!!! Best cake EVER! This tastes like a peanut butter and banana sandwich only sweeter! They had the PERFECT texture! Light and fluffy and moist! They took me an hour and a half but totally worth it!!!!! I used the cake recipe for cake pops and with a thin vanilla glaze on them, it just topped it off perfectly! I will absolutely make these again! ( ;

these were fun to make, however I didn't have the marshmallow fluff so I improvised and roasted marshmallow using the low broilers for the last 30 seconds of their baking and when they came out of the oven I smooshed the marshmallows so it covered the top of the cupcake.They are a tad on the sticky side but my kids don't seem to care

It was easy to make and went over well. 
The peanut butter was a little heavy so it should be cut back a little to keep from hiding the bananas quite so much. 
I only fill d the cups about 1/2 way and they baked to about 3/4's full. Topped with a chocolate ganache then the marshmallow topping. 
Definitely one to keep and make again.

The peanut butter overwhelmed the cupcake so you didn't get any real taste of banana.  I doubled the recipe thinking I would get 2 dozen... I got 3 dozen.  Next time, I would lessen the peanut butter and add a little more banana.  FYI, I topped with chocolate icing.  The kids loved it though.

These weren't nearly as awesome as I'd hoped.  They tasted more like banana muffins with frosting than cupcakes.  The kids at my daughter's birthday party loved them though!

These sound great! I was wondering if these need to be kept in the fridge? Thanks for the recipe!
