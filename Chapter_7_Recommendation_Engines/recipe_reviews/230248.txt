Too much cayanne pepper. Scale it back to about 1/2 tspn. Added sliced mushrooms and a pinch of saffron to brown rice. After that it was amazing . Calls for 2 cups chicken broth. I used 1.75 cups, the rest white wine ! . Delicious and easy one pan meal.

Delicious! This dish was really easy and had lots of flavor. I did reduce the cayenne pepper a little bit; I think it would have been a bit too much if I wouldn't have.

My family loved it! I left out the cayenne pepper & had to cover the rice, add more broth & simmer twice as long to cook the rice all the way but was well worth it! Thanks for sharing this!

Note to self: Check other reviews before cooking. Need to cut back on the cayenne pepper. Other than that it is good recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe!!  The cayenne is a bit strong even at 1/2 tsp so be wary of that. I brown everything, throw into a casserole dish and bake it, covered, at 300 for 2 1/2 hours. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

It was pretty good! Cut way down on the cayenne pepper as we are not much on super spicy food! Followed the recipe exactly... W/one exception.. I added a lil extra broth towards the end of simmering to allow the rice to fully cook. Overall, a very tasty rice dish.. Will def make this again!

The recipe as written is good for 2 maybe 3 but I have a family of 6 so I doubled the recipe. For the spices I used a pinch of each except cayenne, I omitted that and used a very small pinch of red pepper instead. I also used a whole container of chicken broth since I doubled everything else.  I also didn't have any onions so I used the dried flakes which worked wonderfully and I used powder garlic, also awesome! Totally making this recipe again.

This is the best rice I have ever made. Ever. The pork chops are pork chops. They were juicy and tender but not very flavorful. This rice I will make again and again and again. Thank you for the recipe! Edit: made with chicken breasts instead of pork and it was excellent as well!

Taste wonderful my family loved it, though I did add more spices and left out the cayenne. I have my own mixture of spices I use mixed and used that its kind of a southern Cajun taste spice. I did leave the rosemary and thyme. I covered my pan with foil for the rice to cook better. I must say I loved the bacon in the rice....wish I had thught of that before, my family loves bacon.

Loved it.  Used minute rice, though.  Just cooked it separately and then added last to the grease, onion, and garlic.  Plated it first then put pork chops on top.  I will definitely make this again!

Let me start by saying that the rice was very, very flavorful. It's an easy to follow recipe but I did do a couple of things differently. First of all, I used 8 chops but only doubled the recipe ingredients. Which might explain why the chops were a little bland. Well either that or I didn't salt and pepper enough (no clear measurements to go by). After browning the chops, instead of putting them on a paper towel, I put them on a plate and covered with foil. This way I could add the juices that settled at the bottom of the plate to the rice when I put in the chops. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown rice and I gave a large onion a rough chop and sliced four large pieces of garlic, instead of dicing and mincing them. I added 1 cup of broth to scrape the pan then added the rest of the broth to the rice. Because I doubled the ingredients, I used 2 tsp of cayenne (even though I read a lot of other reviews saying that even 1 tsp seemed to be too much). By the end of the final 20 minute cooking time, the rice tasted fiery hot and wasn't even close to being done. So, I added 1 more cup of broth (5 altogether) and let the dish cook for another 20 minutes. Some of the pieces of rice were still stiff and the chops were somewhat dry but the extra cup of broth toned down the fire a bit. Because the chops were a bit bland/dry and the rice was stiff after 40 minutes, I can only give this 3 stars. But I would still give this another try.

This is really good.  Very simple and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I will cut down the cayenne pepper a bit in the future, as it was a bit too much for us, and we like spicy!  Definitely not the healthiest, so it will have to be a special treat, but the rice was delicious.

Changes I made:  No rosemary (not a fan) and lowered cayenne to 1/4 tsp (1 tsp is way high for my cayenne) - end result, LOVED it.  In the future, I will ensure bacon is extra crisp (it was a bit limp and had I cooked it more it would've added a lovely texture to the rice).

Flavor was AMAZING.  With my cayenne change, it had just a tiny bite with no real heat and good flavor balancing with the garlic, bacon and onion.  This is going into permanent file for rotation.

This was pretty good. I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was just enough for us. Didn't want it to spicy.

Excellent! Thanks for sharing this. We liked the chops but we LOVED the rice. I will add some more seasoning to the chops next time just as a personal preference but they are good as is.  The day after making this dish, I was home alone with no other mouths to feed and made just the rice part of the dish for my dinner. Loved it that way as well.  Easy and well worth the minimal effort.

I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit with adults and kids; thankfully I tripled the recipe for the size of my group or I would have run out of rice!  I heeded the advise of others and only put in a heaping teaspoon of the cayenne (for my triple batch)  I also had fresh red onion  on hand so I substituted those for the dried herbs.  I also used my garlic press for fresh garlic.   I will definitely make this again!

This was very flavorful and I'll definitely make it again.  However, I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne and it was still spicy.  Also, the rice took much longer than 20 minutes to cook, so the pork chops got a little tough.  Next time, I will cover the rice for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.

Made this last night and we really enjoyed it!  After reading other's reviews, I "sprinkled" the cayenne pepper on top of the rice mixture and it turned out plenty hot enough for us.  I added a can of mushrooms, a handful of chopped celery, and a couple of strips of red pepper chopped.  My husband loved the rice with all the seasonings and veggies.  I used the above recipe amounts for three pork chops, but cooked six chops and it made enough for the two of us with leftovers to look forward to.  I used two cans of chicken broth and minute rice.  I cooked everything in a large 12-inch frying pan which I covered for about 25 minutes to simmer, then uncovered for about ten more minutes to reduce the liquid.  Yum!  It reminds me of a childhood friend's mother's dish of "pork chops and rice" that I loved and that I have been looking for to reproduce.  Will definitely make this again now that I've got the process above.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

I have to agree with others on the Cayenne Pepper.  I used a small amount and it was way too hot.  My husband who loves spicy food thought so also.  Loved the idea of skillet pork chops and rice, but if I make it again I will throw a dash of the hot pepper in.

I really loved the flavor of the rice!, and the pork chops stayed moist! I followed the advice of other reviewers and halved the cayenne pepper. Also, I didn't have rosemary, but I didn't miss it.  I doubled the rice (used jasmine brown rice), broth, bacon, and pork. It cooked a bit longer, but they may have been due to me covering the pot. The recipe didn't say to cover and simmer, but it seemed that I should. Maybe not. After 20 minutes, there was still lots of liquid. So I uncovered and continued cooking. Eventually it was done. Anne it was great!

Today was not a good day. This recipe went a long way to making it better.
While on the never ending hunt for something for dinner,I discovered that we had some leftover pork chops that needed eating. Since I frequently come here for inspiration, I searched "Pork chops" and found this recipe. So glad I did!
I followed the recipe fairly closely (a rarity for me), just making the odd change to make up for a lack of cayenne (I used Epicure's Cinqo Pepper Blend), white rice (used basmati) and rosemary (Epicure's Holiday Spice to the rescue) in my cupboard. After accidentally over salting my sauteed zucchini (I told you it was a bad day), I dumped that in as I hadn't added salt to the rice yet and it was pretty much perfect. I laid the pork chops on top and covered it for the last few minutes to heat them up. The chops were still moist and juicy and my husband, who rarely comments on dinner, said it was really good. That's enthusiastic praise coming from him!
Thanks for an awesome recipe. Will definitely add it to my go to list of what to make for dinner.

Easy and tasty.  Like other reviewers, I had to add a bit more broth before the rice finished cooking.  Our "meat & potatoes" lover took 4 helpings of the rice.

I have made this several times and it comes out great. I did cut back a bit on the cyanne. For novices, step 5 should read "cover and simmer". Some have stated the rice was hard and/or the meat was dry. It needs to be covered to keep everything moist and delicious.

This is a very nice recipe except I would not put the cayenne pepper in it. I believe that is a typo. Other than that, it's a very good recipe.

I omitted the cayenne pepper since I was cooking for my lil ones as well. I definitely had to cook the meal longer, as the rice wasn’t cooked in the allotted time. I think I added too much chicken broth when I cooked the rice longer; it turned out somewhat gummy.

don't eat bacon very often only in turkey dressing. So, I put 2  tbsp of cumin instead and it was delicious.

Ultimately loved this dish, but was glad I read the reviews before making it. I added 1 cup of sautéed mushrooms when I added the pork chops back into the rice mixture. I also reduced the cayenne to 1/4t, and used ground rosemary because my husband hates the “sticks” of regular rosemary. To keep the dish lighter, I removed 3/4 of the bacon fat, and the chops sautéed up just fine. Great dish!

It was good - I'm glad I read the reviews because even cutting the cayenne pepper in half was still a little too spicy for us.  I used boneless pork chops and they cooked way faster than the rice, so next time I'll cook the rice alone, then add the pork chops halfway through.  I also used cream of mushroom soup and water instead of chicken broth to make it a little creamier.  Overall, good recipe.  I'll do this one again instead of cooking it in the oven like I usually do.   One less pan!

Excellent base recipe.  I didn't have enough chicken broth, so I used water and added a pack of  Pork Gravy mix. Used the spices our family likes - powder onion and garlic, salt, pepper, and season salt on the meat, thyme and marjoram in rice.  Covered the pan to simmer. My dish was so good!  The chops were so tender and moist. Thank you so much for sharing,  It's a keeper!

Great kid friendly meal.  Rice was very flavorful.  I used minute rice and the meal came out great.  I did adjust the spices to a level I knew the kids would still eat.

We are not big pirk eaters, but i had just bought a huge piece from the New Year's sales. My husband cut some pcs of pork off a whole boneless loin.  We used those. And I had already cooked white rice in the fridge, so we just used that too.  I've also played with the spices and varied it each time I've made it. Tastes great each time.

Fabulous! Used 1/2 t. of cayenne but think I'll use slightly less next time. Used cooked rice instead of cooking rice with the pork chops. Really good, even the day after leftovers.

I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but they are constantly going on sale at the grocery store and then I end up buying them and thinking "Surely I can do something to make myself really enjoy these this time." This recipe came pretty close! I really liked the combo of rosemary and bacon. It sounds like it would be strange, but it wasn't. I'll add this to my permanent pork chop rotation.

I think this is a easy and delicious recipe. I doubled the recipe but only put in 1 teaspoon of cayenne and it was still too spicy and we like things hot. I found the chicken stock did cook down too quickly, and resorted to adding more stock and covering the pan. This may have just been because I had the burner too high, so I can't really blame the recipe. I will definitely do this recipe again.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of cutting back on the cayenne pepper.  I think a tsp is too much.  I put in a little less than half of that and it was plenty spicy enough for my kids and I..my husband probably would have put the whole tsp in, but he was out of town, so....lol

I found the rice was absorbing the liquid a little too quickly and that would have resulted in undercooked pork chops, so I covered the pan and simmered for the 20 minutes.  No problem with hard rice.  It was cooked to perfection and the chops were so tender.

I will definitely make this again.  Even my 12 year-old daughter, who doesn't like you to mess with her rice LOVED this (pork isn't her fav and she didn't care for that part, but it's not the recipes fault).

Let me start by saying that I hate bacon. But my husband loves it, so I wanted to make this for him. I have to say that I actually did like the bacon in here. It added a nice smoky flavoring to the rice and was not too overpowering. That being said, this was still just okay. It was very heavy. I substituted some chili powder and paprika for the cayenne pepper since I didn't have any, and the rice was very flavorful, but the flavor is very one-dimensional. Plus, I had to add an extra cup of broth to the rice and cook it for another 10 minutes because it was completely raw after the 20 minutes was up, but this left the pork chops incredibly dry and unappetizing. Even my husband said this recipe was just all right, and he loves everything. So, I probably will not be trying this recipe again.

OMG! This was sooo good, I took out too many pork chops so i doubled the recipe and it made a ton but it is all going to get eaten!!  I also added a can of diced tomatoes when I added the chicken broth then a can of corn 5 minutes before the end of cooking time.  Very bad for you with all the grease but I will make this again in the future.
