I scaled this to 1 serving, but used 2 full scoops of ice cream. I liked that this shake didn't call for much milk, as many shake recipes call for too much. I used pumpkin puree instead of pie filling, and it still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! I scaled the recipe to 1 serving, using canned pumpkin and pumpkin ice cream. It was delicious but oh so small. I only got 1/2  cup. It was so small I wasn't even able to take a picture of it since I don't have such a small glass! Next time I will omit the brown sugar since I found it to be a bit too sweet. Thank you for the recipe.

I used frozen vanilla yogurt instead of the ice cream but this is absolutely delicious and tastes like a frozen version of pumpkin pie
