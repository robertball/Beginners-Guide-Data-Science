I need to fill a huge pitcher for a larger gathering and wanted something a little less acidic and more light so I made this with a twist.

This is so, so good. Little sweet, so I added just a little more vodka. Personal taste only. VERY GOOD.

Delish and deadly! Don't skip the lime, it adds just the zing it needs. Add an orange slice for fun too!

This is a wonderful drink recipe.  I absolutely loved it, very sweet and tropical tasting without being sickeningly sweet.

This was pretty good.  Simple, not too fancy but it will definately get the job done!  Be careful with these because you really can't taste how much alcohol is in them!

The first time I made this beverage, I followed the recipe exactly and it truly is as potent as it is delicious. If you want it a bit lighter on alcohol content, then add orange juice in place of the Grand Marnier. It still has that great tropical taste but with a bit less "punch".

My husband loved this recipe as written but it was a little strong for me. I added a couple extra ounces of pineapple juice to dilute the alcohol. I also added a few drops of grenadine for color.

Wow! We brought the ingredients for this to a party and it was a HUGE hit! We made the recipe as published and they were yummy. Then changed it up a little when we ran out of vanilla vodka. This drink is a little sweeter with Whipped Cream vodka and with birthday cake vodka it tastes like pinapple cake. Yummy! The drink sneaks up on you though so make sure drivers are just having the pineapple juice!

A bit sweet for my tastes, but that could be fixed easily with more vodka. I'd love a pitcher of these poolside!

Used Chambord as I didn't have any orange liqueur on hand. Made it quite sweet, but delicious!

Wonderful! I made one for my mother (a huge Hawaii Five-O show fan) then for myself. I didn't have vanilla vodka, so I used the same amount of vodka with the smallest dash of vanilla extract (probably ~1/8 tsp, at most). I also used an un-sweetened, pure pineapple juice that allowed this drink to not be overly sweet. It was so wonderfully smooth and what a great treat! Thank you so much for this lovely recipe!
