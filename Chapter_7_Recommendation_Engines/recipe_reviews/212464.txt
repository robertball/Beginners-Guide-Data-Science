Great scone recipe!  I toasted the walnuts at 350 for ten minutes.  I didn't have maple extract so I used 2 Tbsp. of pure maple syrup.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I always freeze my butter and grate it into the flour mixture - it makes things a little easier.  These came out very nice.  They really don't even need the glaze, but I did one anyway: 1/2 c. confectioners' sugar, 2 Tbsp. of real maple syrup, and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract.

Just to comment and this might help.  The scones should not be crumbly.  This is why I do not grate the butter.  If you put the dough together with some of the butter in small pieces (not all), the butter will melt in baking and create a moist scone.  One other thin, if you have the dough out longer than ezpected, put in the refrigerator again.  That way the butter isn't all melted when you go to bake them.

Amazing recipe! I used two tablespoons of maple syrup in the scone recipe, and they turned out wonderful. I think next time, I'll just mix the powdered sugar and some maple syrup together for the icing. As it is, it was nothing special.

This is the first time I've made scones and now I'm hooked!  I didn't have any maple extract so I used 2 T. of maple syrup.  I also used maple syrup in the glaze. I patted the dough out to about 1" and cut out heart-shaped scones.  This recipe made 16 scones.  Delicious and so easy!

I've made these twice.  The first time I used whole milk and pecans instead of walnuts, and they were great.  The second time I used almond milk instead of half and half, and substituted 1/3 the sugar with erithritol.  No one could tell any difference, they were just as great.

Delicious! My husband and I love these. (The kids don't like nuts so didn't try them) The first time I made them, the walnuts looked and smelled burnt but I used most of them anyway. Great flavor! The second time, I baked them less time and the nut flavor was not as bold or noticeable. I did use real maple syrup as someone suggested instead of the extract. It make the drizzle frosting very sweet but very good on the scones.

These have to be the best baked scones I've ever had, though I admit to substituting hazelnut flavoring for maple since I was out of maple.  The texture of the dough is perfect for forming and cutting, and the final result is a moist, delicious, non-crumbly scone.  My new favorite weekend breakfast!

These taste  great! I was unsure to give it 5 or 4 stars, it was very dry and crumby, BUT I'm not real knowlagable on scones; maybe scones are supposed to be crumby. these ARE TASTY! just serve with something wet; a cream or sauce, they'll be impressed. great with coffee. I took the advice of another reviewer with the frozen grated butter. Also, I don't like walnuts, so I used a cup of chopped fuji apple- YUM!

These are just plain good.  Made as written but made another half recipe of the glaze as I wanted them with a tiny bit more frosting.

So good.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used a food processor instead of the pastry blender for ease in combining the butter and flour mixture.  Thanks for sharing!

fantastic. i used maple syrop and the flavor was great. texture was just right - not dry and crumbly - instead it s chewy and soft. I was pleasantly surprised, as the scones didn't brown much in the oven and i was concerned they are under-baked. But they were perfect! I will definitely make these again.

My husband made these and they were fantastic!  We didn't have any maple extract, so he used 2 tbs. of real maple syrup instead (maple flavor could have been stronger, but it was nice this way.  maybe we'll try adding more next time??).  If you don't have a pastry blender, just "pinch" cold butter chunks into the dry mixture until all the dry ingredients are moistened.  Don't add more ingredients, just keep pinching....  (make sure you use unsalted butter, otherwise eliminate salt in the ingredients). Our batter was really sticky, so we covered and chilled it for longer, (about 45min) and that helped to roll it out.  We made the glaze and just barely drizzled it on- not too sweet, but just sweet enough.  Also good with chocolate chip add ons!

I made this exactly as is, except for the glaze I followed the suggestions of others and mixed 2 tablespoons of maple syrup with confectioner's sugar and then added some cinnamon and vanilla extract.  These are amazing!  I will be making them again - and soon.

Absolutely delish! Definitely a no brainer. I will be making this one time and time again. Changes: pecans instead of walnuts (good choice), 3/4 c oatmeal (but don't decrease the amount of flour at all, you need it!), and 1% milk instead of half and half. I found I only needed to bake them for 15min. The glaze was mildly disappointing as it didn't turn out like a thick icing in the picture. I guess I was hoping for that. Next time I'll use less water to get that consistency. Everyone loved these and gobbled them up right away.

MY SCONES CAME OUT DRY AND CRUMBLY.  IT MAY BE BECAUSE MY BAKING POWDER WAS OLD. I WILL TRY AGAIN WITH FRESH BAKING POWDER.

These scones are awesome!  If you are a scone lover you must try these.  As others have said. Make sure your butter stays cold, I often refrigerate my dough before baking it. If your butter does not remain cold (and chunky) your scones won't turn out right.

These are fabulous if you love a light, sweet maple flavor! I didn't have half-and-half, so I added 1 Tbl of sour cream to two percent milk to make the 1/4 cup. Turned out perfectly. My family LOVES these!

Although tasty (due to the amount of walnuts) the final result was dry and crumbly. I wouldn't try this recipe again. Sorry!

they were tasty but i may have done something wrong, the dough was very gooey and i definitely lost the triangular shape when trying to transfer them to the pan. i didn't even need a rolling pin; since the dough was so soft i was able to pat it down by hand into a circle before cutting.

I used real maple syrup instead of the extract, so the maple flavor was a bit fainter, but I also added crystalized ginger bits and put in pecans instead of walnuts. I love a recipe that whisks instead of sifts, and uses half and half instead of heavy cream!  I never knew I wasn't the only one...

This was so easy and so delicious! Friends and family amazed at how much better these were than ones we've bought locally. I also used a dark, wonderful, real maple syrup instead of maple flavoring. I just loved them.

These are so yummy!!!  I am usually not a fan of scones,  but this recipe makes wonderfully moist and delicious scones! I did have to add a bit more half and half. The recipe does state to combine until it resembles fine crumbs, but after watching a video for scones that suggested that the dough should be handled gently, leaving some of the butter in larger chunks helps to make a more moist scone, I took that suggestion. I first shaped the dough into a rectangle and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, then folded the dough over, patted it down gently and then shaped into a circle for cutting. Instead of adding walnuts to the dough, I  topped some of the triangles with maple glazed sliced almonds (some in my family do not like nuts) after brushing each triangle with maple syrup. I then sprinkled each with cinnamon sugar. Baked in 325 degree oven for 20 minutes. This is a must try scone recipe.

The scone had a good flavor to it, but the texture was a little off for me.  I made it as written, and refrigerated for the 10 minutes.  The finished product was a little drier than other scones I've made.  I really enjoy the taste of maple, so I'm going to give this another try.

Delicious and easy to make. The icing left a little to be desired--too runny. When I make them again, I think I will add more maple flavoring and I will experiment with the icing--maybe just confectioner's sugar and maple syrup . . .

Absolutely delicious scones holy moly! Perfect texture,not too sweet or dense. I added chocolate chips as well as the walnuts and they were so so good. One thing I changed was the glaze, I used about 1 1/2 tablespoons on confectioners sugar and two tablespoons of maple syrup and that was perfect. (Also swapped maple extract for maple syrup in the scones)

These are now my favourite.  Cup of coffee and a maple scone can’t be beat.

The ingredients looked like they were just perfect so I made a batch last evening. This morning my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed eating them, it's a good thing the recipe only made 8!!!

Toasting the walnuts for 5 minutes was far too long, at 4 minutes they were already burnt. But not bad even without the walnuts.

I made these and they were amazing.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  Super easy to make and the taste was wonderful.  I'll definitely make them again.

Lovely maple scones!  I made just a few adjustments, two for preference, the last to quicken the process.  I used heavy cream in place of the half & half, 2 Tbsp. Real Maple Syrup instead of the extract, and finally, cut the butter down to 4 Tbsp.  I've found when using more than a quarter cup of butter in scones (at least for 8 of them) the dough gets too "wet" to work with comfortably, and a slightly drier dough can be shaped and cut immediately (no refrigeration time!)  My scones came out beautifully, and I used Jillian's suggestion for a glaze mixture: the combination was HEAVENLY!  My husband is a VERY happy boy today; thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I substituted pecans instead of walnuts, 2% milk instead of half and half and 2Tbsp maple syrup instead of extract, simply because that's what I had.  I used a pastry brush to apply the glaze over the entire scone.  I would definitely make them again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Sandie!

Very good! Made a few changes, based on the ingred. I had on hand. Used about a half cup chopped pecans in place of walnuts, half sour cream and half milk for the half-n-half, and I doubled the glaze, as we really liked it. Delicious, and the little ones ate them up! Very easy, and they don't take much time.

Very solid recipe. Easy to follow and delicious! I made this with candied walnuts and had to substitute maple syrup for the extract. I can't even imagine the flavor with actual extract, yum! Thanks!

I didn't have walnuts, used about 1/3 cup nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of half and half, skipped vanilla, used about 2 TB. Vermont Maid Syrup, and made these like drop biscuits and found they cook best in a glass or pyrex pan. I also skipped the glaze and these are perfect. These will be regularly baked in my house !
