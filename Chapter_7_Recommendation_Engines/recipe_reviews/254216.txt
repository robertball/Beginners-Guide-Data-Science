How wonderfully simple but looks like it took hours!  I made it as an appetizer to rave reviews and then made it (with cream cheese and strawberry jam) as breakfast two weeks later to equally thrilled compliments.  Thank you so much for the demo!

It was very tasty.  I definitely should have drained more oil off the pesto though and pinched the dough together better.  Mine didn't look as pretty.

This looked really pretty, but I thought it lacked flavor.  I tried dividing the circle into 4 wedges when spreading the pesto.  I used basil on 2 and sun dried tomato pesto  on the alternate 2 - to get the holiday colors.  Thought it would have twice the flavor, but no comments on the taste, only the look, and had leftovers.  : (

This is a very neat, very simple recipe.  Something you will feel very good about putting out for guests whether family or friends or "newly mets."  I made it, except for measurements of ingredients, as written.  I haven't used Frozen Puff Pastry often and wasn't sure whether or not it could be rolled out thinner.
The recipe called for cutting out a 12" circle from each of the two pastry sheets, but my pastry could only accommodate a 9" circle (per sheet) at best. So I scaled back the amount of ricotta and pesto accordingly.   I baked as instructed, until browned, but think that in future I will heat the tray in the oven before placing the pastry (on parchment paper) on it.  To firm up the bottom.  It was a bit doughy.  But still delicious.  I'm thinking that this technique can also be used with other fillings! My thanks to Magda!

This was so simple and quick to do and had such a big effect on presentation, and the possibilities to be creative with different flavours. This definitely falls  into the `simple but interesting` bucket for me.

I did have to reduce the amount of pesto as the one I used was a bit salty. I'd recommend tasting the ingredients first and adjusting the amount to taste.

I also tried it with Nutella and another with cream cheese and red current jam. All had similar wow factors and was tasty!

Wow, with just a few ingredients you can make a very delicious and impressive looking appetizer or accompaniment to your main dish. I served it with the seafood stew. Everyone loved it!

This turned out great and everyone asked me to make it again!!! I used Boursin cheese instead of ricotta.

I am surely classified as an novice amateur cook and this was easy to make and delicious.  I made the mistake once of having my home made pesto being too runny and layering in top of the ricotta cheese.  I rectified that next by mixing it into the ricotta cheese.

This was very good, looked great, and tasted yummy!  We added a bit of shredded mozzarella, and cut back a bit on the pesto but it still had a good “pesto-y” flavor.  Will definitely make this again and also experiment with other fillings.  What a great idea!!

This was totally delicious! Smelled amazing while baking. I added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes I was trying to use up.

I was not able to be as fancy with the pastry dough but this was a big hit at a Christmas party. I also substituted the  ricotta for shredded cheddar.

Very easy and good presentation. Used De Cecco pesto which was not oily and had great flavor. I brushed the pastry with egg white before baking for a nice shine. Bake until nice and golden to ensure pastry is cooked all the way in thicker areas. Will try again with different savory and sweet combinations.

Since I used two squares of puff pastry, I cut the dough into 8 narrow lengths and put a full twist into each rectangle. After baking, I cut the twists in half to make 16 servings.

This was great and so impressive and easy. I didn't have ricotta, so I used cream cheese. Worked like a charm!

As with someone else who reviewed this recipe, my puff pastry sheets were 10" squares, so I could not make 12" circles, unless I were to roll out the dough. I think that would have made it not "Puff" pastry anymore. Still, the only change that made was a little less filling used. It came out great. looked great, and was gone inside of 20 minutes!

How does one retract a review?  I rated this badly by mistake.  I should have rated the "GF" recipe for the pastry instead I gave this one a bad mark.

Sorry!

Excellent recipe!!  Easy to do, very soft, pliable, & sturdy dough.  Your instructions were complete and very easy to follow.  Came out looking  just as beautiful as the picture.  Doubled up on the cinnamons used, Tung Hing Chinese cinnamon and Vietnamese cinnamon.  Added fresh ground nutmeg and ground cardamom.  I made 2 of them & everyone Loved them.  Thank you so much.  Already have plans to make savory versions, thanks for the suggestions.

This was as beautiful as it is delicious. I took it to a New Year's Eve party and I received compliments, so I will make again. I could only find square puff pastry that was about 10" square, so I could not use a 12" circle - however, it was still good.
