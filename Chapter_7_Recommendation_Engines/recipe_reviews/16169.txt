This is a great recipe. I think that I will add some onion the next time I make it.  At first I thought that the spinach amount might be to much but after making it according to the recipe I liked it. Very easy to put together.

I made this recipe in order to try and use up the last little bits of matzah lying around, post-Passover.  I was very disappointed.  It uses an incredible amount of spinach, and is impossible to turn over as a single unit.  Maybe this would have been better with a single package of spinach, and cooked as a true frittata, in the oven...

The idea of mixing these things together is fantastic! I also added chopped onion and red pepper and added a LOT of salt, garlic powder and black pepper.  You should definitely add a LOT of seasoning to give it some extra flavor as spinach and matzo both are very un-flavorful.  I also added a lot of mozzarella cheese after it was out of the pan... I love it! And it is sooo healthy.  Just add what you think would taste good! It would be hard to mess up!!!

As far as Passover dishes go, this one definitely gets 5 stars. It was easy to make and delicious. I added onions, quadrupled the amount of cheese, and next time I will be adding goat cheese to the mix as well. As is, the recipe is bland, but an absolute winner for kosher keeping spinach lovers!

TASTY!  Added some saut√©ed shallot, and used "shredded" parmesan.  Might use more cheese next time.
