This was absolutely delicious. I made it for company whom I knew loved salmon. All four of us loved the mixture of flavors and how moist the salmon was after being baked in a foil packet. 

My local groocery store did not have whole star anise pods. After a little research online I learned that Chinese star anise and Anise seed come from a different plants, but both contain the same three essential oils and have a very similar licorice taste, though the star anise flavor is more intense. 

Each of the eight points in a whole star anise pod contains a single glossy seed.  Star Anise is used in Chinese cooking Anise seed comes from a flowering plant grown in the Medeterrainian and South West Asia. 

Anise seed may be substituted in place of a whole star anise pod. Use ¾ teaspoon crushed anise seeds or ½ teaspoon ground anise for each star anise pod. 

Our local grocery store also did not have ground anise, so I went with crushed Anise seeds. I crushed my own seeds and rounded up to use 4 teaspoons in place of the 5 whole pods. 

One other change, we bought a 2 pound fillet, but I did not adust other ingredients to match. 

We will definitely make this again. Sooooo YUMMY and Easy to Clean Up, just fold up the foil and throw away. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I made this recipe this evening and love it! My husband said it was some of the best salmon he has had. The only change I made was to substitute Chinese Five Spices for the star anise. I used 2 tsp. and it come out perfect. This is a keeper!
