For a sugar free muffin, this was surprisingly tender and fluffy.  Taste was good, but really could use double the splenda.  Maybe a touch of cinnamon as well.  I do not like almond extract, so I used vanilla.  All in all, this is a nice muffin and can be varied to your tastebuds.  I will make this again.

omigosh!  Made an experimental batch, ate one muffin and hauled out all the ingredients and bowls and measuring cups and made ANOTHER batch!  These are light and tasty and I will attempt to keep a supply in the freezer for guests (and myself!).

Surprisingly simple to make and oh so yummy!  The addition of preserves on top really makes these muffins special.
