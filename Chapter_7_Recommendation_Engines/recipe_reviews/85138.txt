This is really a beautiful salad, with lots of contrasts in flavor and texture.  The dressing alone is worth giving this salad a shot!  Just an awesome, classic vinaigrette, although I did alter the oil to vinegar ratio to 3:1 to suit my tastes.  I also omitted the sugar for the same reason. At the submitter's suggestion I threw in a couple of extras - celery for texture and crunch, and kalamata olives for a punch of flavor and contrasting color. The feta and sliced almonds were definitely the crowning touch.  A thought on the garlic - you've gotta be a garlic lover on this one, and insist that your hubs or significant other eats this as well - it is potent, but delicious!  Not wanting to bite into chunks of garlic, I chose to mince it very finely rather than chop it as the recipe directs. I used butter lettuce rather than the mixed greens which made this a very "sturdy" salad for lack of a better way of describing it, tho' I'm sure the submitter would agree any lettuce or salad greens would be perfectly suitable.  I felt good serving as well as eating this salad - not only is it pretty and delicious, but it's so heart healthy!  Eating this you felt like you were really doing something good for yourself (as well as your tastebuds!) This, along with crab cakes, made for a light but satisfying meal.

i have made this many times and it is thoroughly delicious. i don't change a thing it is perfect as is.  don't worry if you don't have almonds, avocado or feta, it is yummy just plain on salad greens. but all together is outstanding.

I have made this recipe several times for company and am always asked for the recipe.  I tried it with half spinach, half lettuce, and dried cranberries most recently and it was great.  Walnuts also work nicely if you don't have almonds.

The first time I made this salad, my husband said, "This is by far the best salad I have ever had." And I'm going to make it all the time now! And it's easy once you get all the ingredients out and measured.

The dressing is delicious!  Add a little at a time for best taste, then more on the side if desired.  Highly suggest adding pears when in season.

We had this salad with ham and it went perfect together!  Everyone loved it.  I did add a touch of honey to cut the bite of the mustard but not enough to taste.  Very easy and very good.

This salad was light and refreshing.  The only thing I changed was the cheese. I used shredded parmesan. It gave it a "Ceasar" feel.

What a delicious, tangy, garlicky dressing! It was pretty strong combined with the feta, though--next time I'll reduce it. I added zucchini and used chopped hazelnuts (forgot to buy almonds). Next time, I'll add black olives and red bell pepper.

I loved the dressing for this salad. I used walnuts instead of almonds and it was a big hit with my friends! I will definitely make this again.

I ommitted the avacado (didn't have any) and the almonds (personal preference), so I wasn't sure if it might be too plain because of that...but it was still fantastic!  That dressing is great, and I'm not usually a huge feta cheese fan, but it went really well.  Thanks for the recipe.  EDIT: I'm editing my review because I've now made this several times I enjoyed it so much.  I tried making the dressing ahead of time and keeping it in the fridge and it really didn't keep very well at all!  A word to the wise: Awesome dressing for this salad, but it's definitely best served immidiately.

Loved it! I love avocados and they are so good for you. I used a baby spring mix and toasted the almonds. The only change I would make is to reduce the salt in the dressing.

This was really good.  I didn't have a ripe avocado on hand so I substituted red onion.  My husband just thought it was ok, but my parents who were in town visiting, loved it.

Very good, but it is quite strong tasting. I liked it but I enjoy sharp, tangy flavors. The rest of my family didn't like it so much.

Made this tonight to go with my soup party and it was brilliant. Only thing I added was two clementines and it made it very colorful and yummy. Thanks Jesspooh for a great recipe. The dressing will go on many salads.

I thought this recipe was just fair.  My son loves salads and he and I both agree the dressing was a bit on the bitter side.  Dressing wasnt any better than one you could buy in the store.

Delicious, kid friendly if you reduce the garlic. Made the recipe using all the ingredients, although pulled out some of the dressing before adding the avacado and lettuce as it looked like a lot of dressing. Ended up not using 1/4 cup of the dressing, but saved it for another salad. Used two small cloves of garlic in a press and it was very garlicky. Next time will just use one clove. Kids, aged 13, 11, and 8 enjoyed it, albeit the garlic. Had it alongside BLT's for a quick dinner and would definitely make it again.

The dressing really makes this salad.  Light and flavorful!  I added several extra veggies, left out the avocado and forgot to add the almonds.  Can't wait to try this when all the veggies in my garden come in!

This is an awesome salad!!! Sticking with the green theme I added a green bell pepper, green onion, cabage and broccoli. Also, I did not have white wine vinigar so I used cider vinigar and it turned out great

Just DELICIOUS.  I, too added red pears that I sliced w/the peel on.  This salad was so delicious.  I even tossed the dressing a little too early (I don't recommend) and it wilted the greens too much, but it was STILL delicious.

I have made this recipe so many times over the years and *everyone* loves it. The dressing is so good, I have actually never even made any other dressings for ages. The toasted almonds with the feta and avocado are a perfect blend of crunchy vs smooth.

This is an awesome salad!  I used butter lettuce, added diced celery & a diced pear based on the ratings.  Toasted the almonds to enhance their flavor.  Everyone loved it.

I LOVED this salad! I've made it three times in the last week. It's nice enough for company and easy enough to make for a quick weeknight side (I serve it with roasted chicken and couscous). I add cranberries every time which makes it delicious. One note: this does make A LOT of dressing so either scale down that part or add more greens to soak up the extra. Really great side.

I took this salad to a luncheon today and it was a real hit. Loved it as it was so easy & so tastey . I did make a few changes......did not add the avacado as I wasn't sure if all the guests would like it, I used the small sweet grape tomatoes as an addition, I toasted the almonds, used parmesan instead of feta and used another 2 to 3 tbsps of EVO.

The only thing I will do differently is omit the salt and maybe not use as much mustard.  Otherwise it was a very good.

I really enjoyed this salad.  Made it exactly as is, except didn't add the almonds.  I really love butter lettuce with avacado's so that would certainly be my lettuce preference for this salad.  I thought the dressing was perfect and even my 5 year old enjoyed it.

This didn't appeal to me or my husband. I thought the garlic was too strong, he thought it was the mustard. I bought the avocado just for this recipe but unfortunately I won't be trying it again. **UPDATE** The leftover dressing I mixed into pasta the next day and it tasted better than in the greens.

This was just what I was looking for. I didn't have a lemon so I used lime and it turned out great. I have already past the recipe on twice.

There was not a drop left.  I cut the lettuce up really small and chilled both the lettuce and dressing and added pear and it was great!  Even my picking eater wanted more!

Simple, but oh soooo good! One of the best salads I've had from this website in a while (and belive me I've tried quite a few). We had this salad with Ham and potato soup (recipe also found in this web site)for a delicious dinner enjoyed by kids and adults. Thanks Jess for sharing your recipe with us :)

This salad dressing is delicious! I just made it for dinner with my boyfriend and his brother, they couldn't stop talking about it. Easy to make, had all of the ingredients on hand except feta. I just added some cherry tomatoes and left out the almonds.

The recipe doesn't look like much, but it is a delicious salad! I didn't have white wine vinegar so I ended up adding about two tablespoons of lemon juice and I left out the sugar. The garlic and dijon give it a bit of a kick. Also took the advice of another cook and added diced pear - a nice touch of sweetness. It's a new favorite!

I made this on for Christmas lunch.  It was sensational!  I did add handful of Spanish olives.  The dressing was very tasty.  I rated this salad 5 stars - easy, delicious, and everyone loved it.

excellent salad, the almonds give a nice crunch and pairs well with the avocado.  The dressing is delicious, and you really can add lots of stuff to this salad if you wish, or enjoy it just as written.  I didn't have mixed salad green so I used romaine, but other than that I followed the recipe.  This is great for lunch.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this salad for a party last night and it got rave reviews!  I would scoop the avocado out of the dressing and add it to the salad. Then toss to see how much dressing you should add.  You don't need to add it all.  I also added grape tomatoes which added some nice color.

I made this salad as a main course by adding chicken.  I realized a little too late that I was out of white wine vinegar, so I just used white wine instead (hehe) and added a little extra salt to make up for it.  After cooking the chicken,  I tossed it and the feta cheese in with the dressing and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  When we were ready to eat, I added the lettuce, avocado and almonds and tossed until well coated.  The dressing acted as a marinade for the chicken - making it taste sooo good!  Highly recommend!

Searching for recipes that used both avocados and feta, I came across this salad.  Instead of almonds, I used toasted walnuts -- quite good.  Next time I'll add the suggested pears.  Thanks.

Fantastic recipe as written - although I did add sunflower seeds in addition to the almonds.  However, next time I would suggest serving the avocado/dressing separately from the salad as the leftovers tend to be mushily inedible.

Excellent  combination of flavors in this salad and dressing!  My family loved it.  I used champagne vinegar and toasted slivered almonds because that is what I had in the pantry.  Also used only 2 tablespoons of olive oil, omitted the sugar and increased lemon juice to 1 tablespoon.  Used romaine lettuce.  Highly recommend this delicious salad to serve to your family or company.  It was that good!!

Great dressing, great components. But not altogether. I feel the Dijon mustard is the deal breaker . Really overpowers the lovely avocado, almonds,feta.but I was really attracted to the idea of the avocado in the dressing with all the greens. I will develop a tequila lime vinaigrette for this,sweet with a little tang, maybe eliminate the feta. Still working on it.

Served to guests and everyone loved fresh, clean taste.  I used a lemon just picked from tree in backyard for the juice and maybe that is what made it so good?  Whatever, this recipe is a keeper.  There is way more dressing than you will need for the salad however.  Don't pour it all on or it will be drenched in dressing.

My mother in law made a salad almost identical to this for my kids first communion and everyone loved it! I saw this recipe, made it and it was equally as delicious as her salad. The dressing is amazing!  I prefer butter lettuce with this salad. Every time I have made it I have gotten tons of compliments on it. Plus it looks pretty if you slice the avocado and lay them on top of the salad.

Nice salad! I added some honey to dressing.  Could try to liven up the salad with some mandarin oranges, strawberries or grapes?

Very tasty but dressing was almost overpowering.  I used more than 4 cups of greens and added some leftover black olives.  I think a crisper type of greens would be better than spring mix.  Will make again with less dressing and crunchy romaine.

This dressing is wonderful. I didn't have an avocado on hand so I omitted that, but can't wait to try it again with one!

I cut back the garlic and put it through a press. Made the dressing otherwise as written. Put it in a jar and shook it to mix, added a little to the avocado so it didn't get mushy, then added the avocado to the greens after I'd tossed them. Only use as much dressing as you need, it makes way too much and your salad will be soggy. Delicious.

I made this over the weekend for a family get together.  I had to make a few small changes based on what I had on hand.  I did not have an avocado, but I wish I did - it would have been very good with it.  I added cubed pears & substituted toasted pecans for the almonds.  Also threw in some homemade baguette croutons.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly.  It got rave reviews from my family & it was all eaten quickly.  Personally, I found the dressing to be a little more bitter than I like.  Next time I will make sure I have avocado, & add a tiny bit more sugar to the dressing.

The salad dressing was super pungent. The avocado helped, but it was just too strong for me. Next time I'll add more vegetable oil and less mustard.

I love the dressing on this salad and will be making it again and again. As for the toppings on the salad, I think I'd keep the avocado but omit the cheese and nuts and instead add more veggies - cucumber, carrot, peppers. The dressing is very bright and the nuts/cheese weigh it down a bit in my opinion, but it's a great base recipe - thanks!

This salad is really great. I absolutely love avocado so I doubled the amount and we also added tomatoes, but otherwise I followed the recipe. The dressing is very good. I made this for my family and they requested it again the next week. Very customizable and you can make the dressing ahead of time and just toss it with the veggies when you are ready to serve. Great!

I brought this to our band practice last night. Made it as written, with romaine, but just throwing the avocado in with the feta and almonds. Everyone raved about it and asked what was in the dressing!  For those of you who thought there was too much garlic, make the dressing hours ahead and let it sit on the counter (not fridge).  This will marinate the garlic, taking out the “ bite!” Don’t leave out the almonds, they’re perfect in this salad!  Delish!!

Great tasting salad!  My hubby is a skeptic to any dressing that's not 1000 Island, but he really liked this....dressing and all.  So it will definitely be a keeper.  It was so fresh tasting and that is what I liked about it.  Thanks Jesspooh for a winner recipe!

I added an additional tablespoon of olive oil to tone it down just a tad! It was fabulous!  I just made a large batch of the dressing, so all I need to add is avacado and salad greens.

I made this for a pitch-in and there was not a smidgen left. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. For the greens, I used a mixture of kale and Romaine. The only changes I made were to increase the feta and almonds a bit. This is a great combination of flavors that I will make again!

Delicious! Yes, it’s garlicky - but oh so good. I did mince the garlic in a press, just so it didn’t crunch - and the flavor was fantastic. I think you could add almost anything from tomatoes to fruit and still maintain the integrity of these flavors.

Very tasty salad.  I made it with mixed greens. My feta cheese I had in my fridge wasn't fit to eat.  Even without it it was a very good salad.

I had to make some changes. No avocado or almonds (allergies). I only had red wine vinegar. 

Otherwise, this was really tasty and I'll be making it many times! Thank you!

I love this dressing and so did everyone else.  I just made a green salad with what I had but I used avocado as suggested it was amazing in the salad.  I also toasted pine nuts but didn't use the cheese.  Thanks!

I've been making this salad with carrots, apples or grapes & whatever other veggies I feel like throwing in since the first time I had it over 3 years ago. I make the dressing without the avocado & keep it on the counter ALL THE TIME! I don't use any other dressing except when Im dieting & useing only balsamic vinegar. Everyone who gets salad at my house gets this dressing and loves it.

My family, and especially picky teenage boys, went back for thirds on this salad! It's my new favorite go to! Be generous on the almonds and avocados. I skip the cheese because my husbands lactose intolerant, but I didn't miss it since the other flavors are so good!

This was a great base to a solid salad. I can see how adding 'this or that' can work well for it. The dressing had just enough bite to not be overpowered or overpowering.

I loved the avocado, but the salad dressing is a little tart, even for me.  I don't care for sweet dressings unless it is on a fruit salad.  If I make it again I will add some chopped apples to see if that sweetens it a bit.  M

Made this with romaine and red leaf lettuce, peanuts ( an intriguing change from almonds ), kalamatas of course, and the dressing as is. I got distracted by my taste buds and sorta zoned out. Finally was brought back to the present by a strange quiet. I looked up to see my table mates just staring at me. With grins on their faces. Enjoying it? One asked. I apologized for dropping out of the conversation, and resumed my gastronomic pleasure event.   This is great stuff!!!

Very easy to make, yet very delicious. Made it for company last night and everyone loved it. I added 1 granny Smith apple.

I've made this about 6 times now, and we just can't get enough! The last 2 times I used spinach instead of mixed greens and we thought it was more delicious!  Several times I have been asked to share the recipe.

Loved this simple salad!  So did my family.  The dressing has a light and delicate flavor.  The salad ingredients go together perfectly.  I used slivered almonds which gave it a nice tasty "crunchy" taste.  Goat cheese works well, also.

One of my favourite salads.  Love the combination of  avocado and feta.  I am a garlic lover,  but found that two cloves was a little much.  I also added chopped tomatoes for a little color  and added flavour.

Since finding this recipe about 8 years ago, my husband and I love the dressing so much, we almost never have anything else. EVERYONE asks for the recipe. It's so easy to make, bottles well - and you can use it on other things. My sister prefers to put it on salmon as a marinade and bake. Five stars all day long!

I liked this salad, I thought it was pretty good. I liked how the avacado was mixed in with the dressing and that the feta and nuts were sprinkled on top instead of wilting the lettuce or making it look messy. This is not a sweet dressing, but I didn't find it too tart like another reviewer mentioned either. Only change I made was using a pinch of dried parsley instead of a tsp of fresh and I cut the amount of sliced almonds in about half. I had a package of 4 baby mixed lettuce blend. It took 2 to make the 4 cups. I got 5 servings total, at about 229 calories as made.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  Didn't have white wine vinegar, Dijon, almonds, or feta so I substituted cider vinegar and spicy brown mustard, added red onion to the dressing, left out the sugar, and added more cider vinegar because I like it tart and it was exquisite.  To the lettuce I added shredded carrots and thinly sliced celery and next time I'm hoping to have feta and almonds to add to the salad.

I really liked the salad, as well as my guests! Now is in fashion to add fruits to the salad, so as to bring a little more of color I added strawberries and blueberries.  Apple is also a good choice but remember to keep the thin slices in cold water in the refrigerator, because if not they will get brown. Ahh...and I doubled the dressing ingredients, it was delicious.

Very nice and simple salad, especially when you are in the mood for savory.  The avocado and cheese add nice creaminess.  The dressing is quite strong and would be more complimentary with a bit less sour and bit more than a pinch of sugar.

Good salad, but there is way too much salad dressing!  I would also cut the amount of oil by a tablespoon.

Not too bad, although this salad is definitely begging for some different color.  I wasn't too impressed when I'd assembled it--everything except the almonds kind of blend together visually.  I think it would be much better with some craisins, and tossing in some tomatoes would help too.  It wasn't that memorable; the dressing was fine (I halved it) but not memorable and the salad itself was the same.  I'd definitely need to jazz it up a bit in order to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the dressing with yellow mustard since I don't have or particularly like dijon mustard.  I also added about a 1/2 to a full teaspoon of honey.  I served it over a salad of greens, tomato, cucumber, green bell pepper, avocado, and some grated parmesan cheese.

I thought it was good; however, everyone at the dinner party I brought it to raved about it and asked for the recipe.  They give it 5 stars - but I'll stick with 4.

Outstanding recipe and unusual chunky dressing. Only thing I would change is omit the salt since the Dijon mustard adds alot anyway. I tripled the lettuce but you do not need to triple the dressing- just double it. I had some leftover when tripling it.

So simple and so delicious!  It is very garlicy so if you like milder garlic, reduce the amount of garlic to 1 clove.

This is a great, tangy dressing.  My husband and I loved the combination of salty feta w/ the sweetness of the dressing.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband did not care for this salad.
I served it to company and the rest of us ate it. No requests for the recipe.
Did not mix in the greens til serving but it was not anything special.
