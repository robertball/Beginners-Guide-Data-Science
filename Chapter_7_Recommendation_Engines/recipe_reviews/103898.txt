I did not care for this recipe.  I consider myself to be a more advanced cook so therefore when making the risotto I heated the broth/wine and added it by 1/2 cup measures as you're supposed to do when making risotto.  So as a result, it takes much longer than the recipe states. The sourness of the wine/lemon juice completely overpowers the flavour of everything else (the seafood choices in this recipe are such delicate flavours!).  I made this for my husband and mother and none of us cared for it.

I made some changes to the recipe but I used all of the flavors in the meal.  I sauted the seafood on the side in olive oil and added a squeeze of lemon.  I served the snow peas steamed on the side, and I used more chicken stock instead of wine in the recipe (only 1/2 cup of wine).  I didn't put any lemon into the risotto since the wine had plenty of citrus flavors.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  After a few changes we had a great meal.

good and refreshing flavor.  Hubby found it a little too sour, so next time I'll only use about half the lemon juice.  Also didn't use scallop, which I think would've given it a more complex flavor.

This was really good!  I didn't follow the directions exactly with respect to the risotto technique, but instead followed the method I always use: after cooking the rice for a minute or two in the oil, add about 1/2 cup of wine.  When that has been absorbed, add the chicken stock about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and adding the next 1/2 cup after the previous one has been mostly absorbed.  (Note: The stirring is important because it releases the starches in the rice, which is what makes risotto so creamy without using any actual cream.)    When the rice seemed like it was about 5 minutes away from being done, I added the peppers, scallops, etc.    The name of this dish is a bit of a misnomer.  The lemon added at the end makes a huge difference in brightening up the dish and I really loved it, but it does not taste lemony.  Just a warning in case you are craving something with a real lemon zing!

This is a wonderful, easy risotto.  I only had cooked frozen shrimp on hand and, after thawing, I threw them in for the last few minutes to heat through.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a big hit with my family.  Not too lemony at all, as some reviewers thought.

Made a few modifications to this recipe.  Skipped the leek, substituted asparagus for the snow peas.  Used both lemon juice and lemon zest.  Used fresh basil leaves instead of dried.  Also added butter with the wine  Turned out really creamy with an excellent tart flavor.

Love it! Used all scallops (no shrimp). Only because I had scallops left to use. Used peas but next time will definately make with asparagus. Added 1T butter at end. Mmmmm. Thanks!

This was delicious. Only problem - I followed the 2 serving amount and it was not enough for 2 people.

Wow, Kelcampbell was tough! I thought it came out pretty well.  I used left over broth from a clambake, flavored with corn, sauage & potatoes (well-strained using cheesecloth), and I didn't have wine, so I used beer. It tasted great. It's certainly not like a traditional risotto, so be flexible. Keep stirring. I added the shrimp last, since it was already pre-cooked (like most shrimp nowadays), But it all worked just fine. My main tip would be to cook it long and slow after you've added the rice & broth. My total cooking time was more like 90 minutes. I'll make it again.

Just finished this easy to make dish, along with the rest of the wine.  Pretty tasty.  Not knock your socks off good, but definitely above average.  I'm going to use asparagus next time and cut back slightly on the lemon.  Calamari?

I'm having a tough time rating this one - I made this a while back and thought it could be a good recipe if you definitely change the cooking time, then adjust seasonings/flavors to taste.  First of all,  Arborio rice needs time to turn into risotto, and these instructions just did not work for me as stated.  Plus, I think it needed more flavor, but taste is subjective so I can't say that others would agree with me.  So, as written, 3 or 3 1/2 stars.  A couple minor changes and you'll have a winner - first, more herbs, and fresh is better, and secondly, at least 1/2 cup or fresh grated parmesan.  Finally a splash of heavy cream at the end - maybe 1/2 cup - and let that cook down.  I made this for New Year's Eve with several changes to ingredients, and most importantly, to the cooking time, and ended up with a solid 4 1/2 star recipe, that I would probably make again!

Did not like this at all. Was really excited to make it. Followed the directions to the T and came our boring and not enough flavor.

I used 1 lb. scallops and asparagus.  When I added the scallops, I didn't want them to overcook, so I took the dish off the stove in 5 minutes.   The liquid hadn't been absorbed by then, so there was a soupy broth left.  The rice wasn't creamy but rather had an al dente taste.    It was delicious though, and the scallops were perfect.

This is a really easy, tasty meal. I made it as written except with about half the lemon juice since hubby tends to complain if theres too much lemon. It may not be a true risotto but I liked the simplicity and speed of it.

Great recipe. Made some alterations though:1- added 1/2 pound calamari as well, really adds to the texture of the meal. 2- omitted the wine and just added extra broth. 3- let the seafood marinate in the lemon juice with some salt and pepper  instead of adding  lemon the end; this prevents it from being too sour and flavours the seafood very well. 4- used fresh basil.  Yummmo!! Made it a couple times to rave reviews...

Wonderful, fairly easy recipe, but I found that the rice wasn't quite cooked thru in the specified time so I just added about 5 more min.  I also used asparagus instead of the snow peas and about half the lemon juice, served it with a salad and loved the result.  I'll be doing this recipe for "The Ladies" next time they come over for our monthly luncheon.

Absolutely loved the combination of flavors. My 33% reduced sodium chicken broth was apparently not low enough in salt for my taste, but that's not the recipe's fault. I might increase the wine to broth ratio next time to help with that. This is a great launching pad for testing out different ingredients. I tried Quinoa instead of Arborio rice and spinach instead of snow peas. Excellent. Thanks for the fantastic meal.

This was a great recipe.  Made it exactly as shown with one exception.  I used shrimp, scallops, crab, mussels and lobster meat.  I added the seafood at different times to allow for differences in the normal cook time.  All of the seafood was thoroughly cooked and not over cooked.  In the future I would not use mussels, because they overpowered the other shellfish.  This was the perfect 1 dish meal!

The instructions in this recipe are different from the normal way of making risotto, but I was game.  I used 1lb of shrimp (no scallops) and vegetable stock instead of chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Finished product was not as creamy as normal risotto, due to the instructions (adding broth all at the same time, not constantly stirring) and quite sharp in flavor, due to the wine being added toward the end and the lemon juice added right at the end.

While I did not consider this a complete waste of time or shrimp, I will stick with my other recipes from this site.

I made several substitutions with items on hand and it still came out great. Onion instead of leek, plain brown rice (it took a lot longer to cook), scallops only, mint instead of basil, no lemon juice. Very good recipe.

This was a great dish!  Afterwards we thought it could use More Lemon. We also 1/2 an onion and frozen peas that were defrosted in the microwave. We did toss in mussel meat, which we wouldn’t do again. Perfectly balanced as written

So I tweeted it a bit.  I used 1/4 cup of wine and a combination of seafood stock and vegetable broth.  I didn’t add snow peas because my husband is not a fan and I used a whole pound of both scallops and shrimp!

I followed 2 pieces of advice from the other reviewers.  I did not add the whole amount of lemon at once, tasting to see if it needed more.  We added half and then just a little more.  We also did break up the amount of broth and wine to 4 segments, as advised.  Turned out great.

I increased the liquid in this recipe by about a cup and added it little by little. I seared the scallops separately and topped the dish with them.

Fantastic recipe. Made it with slightly different cooking way. I marinated shrimps & scallops with salt, white wine and leek before hand so they will not smell fishy when cooking and also they will taste more fresh as I made them with frozen ones. I also sautéed them separately before adding to almost done risotto. The rest are made just like stated. They tasted delicious! Thanks for this easy risotto recipe. It made my first attempt to make risotto a big success!!
