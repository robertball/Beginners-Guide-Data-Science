We halved the recipe, and it made enough to serve at least 6. I couldn't fit all the liquid called for into the pan and had to leave out 1 C of the OJ/broth mix. It was really good. I used the extra juice (and there was a lot of it!) to make rice, which was the perfect accompaniment for the chicken.
