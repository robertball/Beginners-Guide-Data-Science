I used diet Cranberry juice, sugar free raspberry gelatin and "lite" whipped topping. SO good. It really is like a mousse in texture. The kids and I just fell in love with it. Next time, I'd like to see if I can't pull this off with fresh cranberries some how which will cut back on some of the sugar in this recipe.

I make this every Christmas and everyone loves it. My mold always comes out a little mushy, so next year I may just chill in a pretty bowl and serve with a spoon. It tastes fancier than the ingredients seem. Very yummy.

Always a hit with the kids who do not like traditional cranberry sauce.  I've used Strawberry Jello and mixed Cranberry juices as well.

Simple! Tangy...yummy. What a refreshing alternative to cranberry sauce (which some people turn their nose up to).  Did I mention simple?

Flavor was okay, used cranberry sauce with cranberry skins in it, would be much better with jelly
