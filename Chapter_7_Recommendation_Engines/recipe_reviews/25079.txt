Good, easy to make but very much like chocolate cake.  If you prefer a more fudge like brownie then skip this one.

This is actually a delicious cake recipe I've usually seen as "Texas Cake". However, I wouldn't call them brownies at all.

This is what I call a Texas Sheet Cake, not brownies.  There are better sheet cake recipes out there than this, but having said that, this is super easy and pretty decent.  Next time I would probably add a dash of salt to the batter and some vanilla.  You can sub sour cream for the buttermilk, too.

Cake-like texture, neither too sweet nor too chocolatey. My kids ate them with whipping cream instead of frosting and the pan was clean.

I have been making this cake for years.  This is actually a buttermilk cake recipe as well.  The froasting is not supposed to be thick.  You should cut the cake while it is still warm, and then pour the froasting over top letting it seep into the cake.  I have many requests for this cake.  It isn't a normal chocolate cake recipe but it is good.

I am really not sure why this is a recipe for brownies.  It's a chocolate cake with chocolate icing and I have to say that it did not get very good reviews in our house.  Ice cream makes it a little better so we'll have to get extra plump with this cake.

Definitely a cake, not brownies. But VERY GOOD! 
I added,
3/4 c. cocoa (instead of 1/3)
Vanilla
All I had was almond milk (no buttermilk) so I  used that.

Very good though!

Brownies? I agree with other reviewers- this tasted like cake. Although it was good, I would have preferred brownies...The icing was the best part about this recipe.

No matter if you want to call this cake or brownies, it is delicious!! Nothing like this confection!! Try it, you will love it!! We always make a frosting that has a titch of buttermilk in it too.
