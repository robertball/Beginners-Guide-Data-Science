Didn't care for the texture.  Spouse didn't like these cookies at all.

Five stars if you increase the cinnamon and vanilla. Amazing - you can't taste the Splenda in the cookie if you use real chocolate chips. Not too pumpkin-y either. Very light and fluffy!

Thank goodness these are sugar-free; they could become addicting!
