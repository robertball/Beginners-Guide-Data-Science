If you plan on making this recipe, I do not recommend Ghiradelli chips.  I just attempted to use them and ended up with a grainy unmelted mess!

SUPER easy and you can use crushed peppermint candy, choc. covered peanuts, almonds or raisins,
pretzel pieces or mix and match.  The oil is a better addition than shortening, doesn't dull the product so much and is not as fatty.

Great fun for the kids too as it is made in the microwave.

Very good,  I added chopped pretzels sticks too.  Next time I will press the M&Ms into the chocolate at the end.  Some of the coating started to melt and swirl in the white chocolate.  A neat effect IF that is what you want.

Very good, but be careful melting the white chocolate chips - they burn/scortch VERY easily (this makes a grainy, clumpy mess that you can't salvage) - I don't rec. melting them on high heat. I microwave for 30 seconds at a time; stir; heat again, etc.  Also, it helps a lot to cool the melted candy several minutes before adding the mini M&M's.  That way the colors don't "bleed" into the white chocolate.

Instead of using chips, I recommend using 10 oz. of good quality white chocolate.  Coarsely chop it before melting it (either in double boiler or at 70% power in microwave.)  This candy is addicting!

Best recipe. Easy and gets so many compliments. Be careful about doubling. The chocolate is harder to melt. Do each back individually. Will stick and hard to get smooth.

I used the candy canes crushed and white chocolate (1 lb chopped and melted in dbl boiler) and added a 1/2 to 1 tsp peppermint flavoring.  Addicting is right!  It's on my list for every Christmas from now on :-)  I'll try the cranberries or raisins next time too!
