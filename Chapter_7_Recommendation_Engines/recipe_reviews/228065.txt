It has great potential and probably I did something wrong the first time, but the amount of water & salt seemed very excessive. I cut back by half the second time and ooh-la-la. I agree with an earlier poster - use fresh spices for the canning. I doubled the spices in the jars the second time & added some whole allspice. And I have experimented, adding some pineapple chunks and dried cranberries a few times. Nice. This is *really* is a great base recipe, I've enjoyed it and I can see doing a lot with it as time goes on. Thanks for sharing, Keryne.

First and last time growing watermelons in So Cal.  Only got ONE watermelon from a jungle of vines (squirrels got two other ones! #($@)  So I was determined to make the very best of that darn melon.

This recipe was clear and easy.  However, peeling a watermelon resulted in me inventing new swear words.  I'm lucky I still have all my fingers.  Not a fun process.  BUT...the taste of this recipe is delightful.  I actually would be willing to use it again on a Farmer's Market organic melon.

This was my first experience with canning. The watermelon rinds tasted like sweet pickles and the juice had a very nice flavor. The only thing that was unclear to me was whether to use fresh cinnamon and clove in the jar or use the spices in the cooked packet. I used the spices that I prepared for the packet, but next time I will use a fresh cinnamon stick and clove for the jar. This was a good recipe and I will certainly try it again.

I made these last summer, and they were a hit - especially at Christmas dinner with family.  This year I bought a 20+lb watermelon.  This produced about 20 cups of cut up cubes which filled 12 pint jars.   I find the easiest way to peel is the following: cut watermelon in half lengthwise.  Cut each half again lengthwise. Cut each of these sections into slices about 1 1/2" thick.   I then peel each section with a vegetable peeler.  I leave a little of the pink on as I think it makes a prettier pickle.   I added about 1/2 t of red pepper flakes to 3 of the jars for my friends who like things spicy.

After trying several other pickled watermelon rind recipes (some from this site), I finally found one that replicated the tangy, sweet flavor that I remembered from my childhood. I have made it several times, and have made only one alteration to the recipe as written:  I did not cook the rinds 45 minutes, only about 20 minutes and they were plenty soft.  Try to get a melon with a thick rind which is easier to "peel"…the small seedless varieties tend to have thin skins and are harder to prepare.

These pickles have a very complex flavor.  Everyone at one of our family gatherings just loved them.  I will probably make them again.  I just need more watermelon rind.

They are out of this world delicious. So easy to make. The only thing time consuming is waiting for the watermelon to process in the refrigerator overnight. They taste like my aunt and used to make. They were a delicacy our whole lives. Just plain yummy.

What an interesting taste! I had never had pickled watermelon rind before. While the watermelon has almost no taste, it is an excellent vehicle for sugar and spices. I expected it to be crisp like a pickle, but it wasn’t. It’s still an intriguing taste. I did make one change, which I don’t usually do the first time a make a recipe. I used about 3/4 inch of ginger cut into thin slices which I added to the spice bag. I used this recipe because it used less sugar than other recipes I had studied.

Excellent.  I thought i was doing something wrong and wasn't going to have enough liquid to fill the jars with the pickles, but it worked.  

I omitted the clove/cinnamon in the jar, but added a little extra cinnamon and about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the pot while boiling (step #3).
