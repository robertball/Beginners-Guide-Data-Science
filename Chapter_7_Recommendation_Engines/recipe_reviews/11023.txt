Great Recipe.  I substituted 1 tsp. almond extract for more almond flavor and kept only 1 tsp. vanilla extract. - Excellent :)

Excellent cookies, very easy to make. As suggested before, I used a tsp. vanilla, and a tsp. almond extract. I will definitely make these again!

this cookie was great...i wasn't too sure with all the shortening vs. butter...but it did turn out very well...I went ahead and added almond flavoring instead of vanilla for that added almond flavor... I shaped mine like crescents and while still alittle warm, I rolled them in 10x sugar. a very delicate cookie. Next time I might even play with 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.

So DELICIOUS!!!  These cookies are rich and delicate.  Just what I was wanting!  I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening - worked wonderfully and the flavor is incredible.  I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 2 teaspoons almond extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I just dusted them with powdered sugar this time but I will try the chocolate next time.  And there WILL be a next time, these cookies are fantastic!

This cookie is a hit! It looks great!  I rolled out a real long strip and then cut it into uniform strips 3 inches each.  In order to make an exact curl for each cookie, I curled them against a small glass. (I'm on a diet, but the children said it tastes yummy!) thank you for a perfect recipe
