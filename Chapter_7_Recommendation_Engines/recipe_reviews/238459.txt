Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  These are so good.  I used cooked pumpkin and I toasted the nuts. I used pecans instead of walnuts and pumpkin seeds mixed with the sunflower seeds.  I added a bit of coriander too.  I fried for about five minutes per side though.  They came out crispy and perfect.  Thanks!

Thank you, I have been looking every where for a recipe that does not have beans, lentils etc as I can not eat them.
Fantastic recipe, I left the cauliflower out as I can't eat that either, and just mashed an avocado and added it to the mix :-)

I served these to a friend who is following the paleo diet.  They are a good source of plant protein even for a meat eater.  The recipe lends itself to modifications so having a basic mix on hand opens the door for flavorful adaptations. Quick, easy and a welcome addition to my stash of vegetarian recipes!

These are fantastic.
I made these in my Thermomix, so they ended up a bit sloppy, so I added breadcrumbs to thicken it up.
So good! I made a double batch and pretty sure they'll be all gone. No leftovers for me!

these are quite good! I added a bit of crumbled feta cheese to the mixture before I fried them for a bit of extra zing (yes it takes away from being paleo), but very good! I eat mine on a salad!

These were a surprising hit at my house.  I honestly was not as blown away, but my wife loved them.  She is not eating Paleo, so had them on a whole wheat bun with either Havarti or horseradish sauce.  

Perhaps I did something wrong, but they were very crumbly.  Next time I will add some egg to try to help hold them together.

WOW! This recipe is my favorite gluten-free and vegan burger recipe. And it is versatile, I've used pumpkin instead of squash and a variety of veggies. It's great!
