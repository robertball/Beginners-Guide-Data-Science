I always saute my vegatbles before adding to the soup - this makes a HUGE difference in the flavor(try it and you will agree).  I fried the beef in a huge saucepan, removed from pan then sauted two onions and garlic (I don't know why this recipie doesn't have onions!) and the other vegetables. Then in the same sauce pan added all ingrediants, in the interest of conserving flavor and reducing dishes. Turned out great.

This is a very good soup!  I did make a few changes, as suggested in some prior reviews.  I added 2 onions, 1 more stalk of celery, garlic, Sherry, Liquid Smoke, beef bouillon, homemade vegatable stock, Italian seasoning, and fresh parsley (instead of dried).  

I sauteed 1 onion and 3 T. chopped garlic with the meat, drained off the fat, saving about 3 T. to saute the vegatables.  Sauteed 2 stalks celery, cabbage, carrots and potatoes, another onion and added 3 T. of Liquid Smoke.  

While that was cooking, I added 1 c. Sherry, 4 T. beef bouillon granules, 1 T. Italian Seasoning, 1/2 c. fresh parsley, corn, barley, mushrooms, tomatoes, 6 c. homemade vegatable stock, water, salt & pepper to the hamburger mix.  After vegatables were sauteed, I added everything together in one large pot.

After this came to a boil, I let it simmer for 1 1/2 hours, while the bread finished rising and baking.  Very flavorful this way and comforting.

This recipe is good, but a lot like one I already have. I wanted to do something with some barley I have, so I gave it a try. I agree with some other reviewers that the recipe is pretty bland, so I added an onion, some garlic, and a few beef bouillon cubes. I also left out the corn and mushrooms but added some zuchinni because I had some I wanted to use up. With these changes and some fresh rolls it was a very good meal!

I loved this recipe. Along with some homemade bread, my husband and I find this makes a complete meal. I added a large can of tomato sauce and some Italian seasoning and the added flavour was wonderful. This will now be a regular soup in our home.

This was okay, but it would have been pretty bland if I hadn't added some beef soup base and 4 beef bouillon cubes.  It is a good way to clean out your vegetable drawer.

When making this soup you need to use the "cheaper" hamburger, it will give the soup more flavor even though you do stain out most of the fat.  Also please remember that a stalk of celery is the whole thing (not just one rib of the celery). Onion and other veggies can easily be added to this recipe. I don't like onion so don't use it very often. I also add several cubes of beef bullion (2-4, otherwise it can get too salty).

You have to add beef boullion cubes - I added about 12 to 14 cubes you figure there is 12 cup of water. I also added onion when I browned up the meat. Omitted mushrooms and parsley (I didn't have them) Everyone like it very much!

I was disappointed in this soup. With the amount of vegetables it should have been more flavourful

Loved, loved this soup!  Did alter the ingredients though.  Added diced onions and green peppers, 1 1/2 lbs. kielbasa as I didn't have enough hamburger and substituted cauliflower for the potatoes.  I also reduced the amount of water to 2 1/2 quarts as we prefer less broth.  Definitely will make it again!

I really like this recipe since it's so adaptable. I used quinoa instead of barley and you can easily use whatever vegetables you have on hand.

I left out the corn, mushrooms and barley and added some soya sauce for flavor. It's quite tasty.
