I had high hopes for this recipe, but I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was very thin, not very creamy, and too profuse for the rice. It ran right out of the salad and onto the plate. I found the flavor rather sharp, with no hint of the sweetness of the oranges or ginger. It might have been the combination of dijon and red onion that overpowered the ginger and orange and gave this recipe more bite than it needed. I would leave them out next time.

Very good summer salad.  To reduce the problem of the dressing being runny, I cut the mayo to 2 Tbs, cut the olive oil to 2 Tbs, and added an extra half cup or so of rice.  To cut the tartness others discussed, I added about 2Tbs of honey; flavor was a perfect mix of sweet and tart (and the honey also helped thicken the dressing).

I used brown rice; I think this salad would definitely benefit with the wild rice!  You can taste each individual flavor, I would prefer more of a blend!

way too "mayonnaisey."  the orange and ginger flavors were drowned out by the other ingredients.  pretty disappointing.

Great recipe if you are looking for something different. I cut the amount of OJ in half so that the dressing wouldn't be runny. Lots of variations of this recipe could make this one of your favorite summer salads.
