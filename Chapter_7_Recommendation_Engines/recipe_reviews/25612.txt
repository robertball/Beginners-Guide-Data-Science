I take my baking very serious.  I'm usually a cake mix snob. I had to try this because I wanted to experiment. This was, surprizingly wonderful. I made mine alittle diff. because I didn't have some things on hand.  I used oil instead of butter(I'm sure butter makes it better.) I omitted the lemon extract for 1/2 tsp of almond extract and 1 TBL of good van.(That's what gives pound cake the traditional lb.cake flavor.)  Also, I only had french vanilla cake mix.  I also used buttermilk instead of the 2/3c of water.  You have to make this cake a day ahead to appreciate it.  Do not eat it warm because it still tastes like cake mix.  Trust me, next day!!  I also wouldn't ice it or glaze it unless you like you cake super sweet.  We found it was wonderful with a cup of coffee.  This would make a great base for s.c coffee cake.  I think I will use this as my new lb. cake recipe-because it is so easy.  However, next time, I will use butter and butter cake mix.  I think that prob. makes it!  You can still use oil- it was still great! Just use butter flavored cake mix.

Great cake, tastes just like homemade. Use Duncan Hines yellow BUTTER cake mix, a little more flavor and beat 5 minutes at the end. The BUTTER yellow cake mix makes a better cake than just the regular yellow cake mix. I have experimented a lot with this recipe and it is very versatile.  As a pound cake, I top it with any type of icing. It also makes a great sheet cake.  I use this same recipe to make chocolate sour cream pound cake, using Duncan Hines BUTTER chocolate cake mix , eliminating the lemon flavor and adding more vanilla. Top with chocolate or white buttercream icing.

This cake is wonderful!!!  I made a few alterations though.  I changed the cake mix to Devil's Food, omitted the Lemon extract and added in a package of chocolate chips.  The cake baked very well and the chocolate chips held together but melted into the cake at the same time.  To die for!  I bake regularly and people always love it but I've never had every single person who got some to ask for the recipe.  Even the men!

I admit my general bias against yellow  boxed cake mixes, however, every now and then I come across a recipe that really can fool even me. Not so here. No matter that this recipe doctors up a cake mix nearly to the point of its being a scratch cake; it tasted like, well, a yellow cake mix - a dry, yellow cake mix. Better to have skipped the cake mix altogether, since all the rest of the ingredients for a pound cake were there. In addition, the baking instructions state 60-80 minutes - mine was a tad over baked at 55 minutes. As previous reviewers remarked, this has a coarse crumb, and is not nearly as moist as it should have been. My suggestion, if you are a fan of yellow cake mixes to begin with, is to simply bake a yellow cake mix according to package directions, or look for a doctored cake mix recipe that includes sour cream and pudding. Otherwise, skip the cake mix and make a scratch pound cake.

This cake is easy and taste just like a homemade cake.  I used a chocolate cake mix and cooked this cake a little under done.  It was so moist I could have eaten it all myself.  I did not put in as much sugar as the recipe called for.  I always take my  cakes out of the oven when a little bit of cake is left on the toothpick.  But it does look cooked.

This was amazing, better than any homemade pound cake I've ever made. I used DH butter recipe cake mix, skipped the lemon and doubled the vanilla.  My "what the heck kind of cake has no frosting--that's the only part I eat" kids went nuts and asked for this for their b-day cakes!!  AAAAA++++

This is the best cake. I've made it 4 times in 3 weeks, and I can't get enough of it. I have made it with lemon cake, golden butter yellow cake, and regular yellow cake. It is fabulous. I've even toyed with the extracts a little. It tastes better than my grandma's homemade, much to her dismay!

I have made a variant of this recipe and that is what my rating is based on. I apologize to anyone who prefers that we not rate/review recipes that we've tweaked, but this is too good not to share. Here's what I used:  1 white cake mix with pudding 1 c. flour 1/2c. butter 1/2c. margarine 1 c. sugar 5 eggs 8 oz. vanilla yogurt (not sugar free or fat free) 1/2c. milk  NO WATER  Mix these ingredients in the manner and order included in the recipe. This is absolutely exquisite. Hope it works well for you!

What an awesome cake!  Had to use a lemon cake mix. Drizzled the finished cake with a lemon glaze.  At a recent church fellowship, it disappeared before I could even sample.

After adding all the ingreds to the cake mix, it still tasted like a cake mix. This cake is not bad. I just thought it lacked the flavor of a pound cake. The texture was okay, moist enough but not quite dense enough. I won't bake this one again. Sorry.

This was by far the best pound cake I have ever made. I used almond extract instead of lemon(because I didn't have any lemon)and everyone loved it. We ate it with strawberry's and blueberry's. Then later we added ice cream with the fruit. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I am an experienced baker and I love homemade recipes. With that being said, this recipe is definitely a keeper! I don't know how other readers experienced dryness, lumps or cake mix flavor. I used real vanilla and lemon, and I sifted my flour and cake mix. Follow the steps and make sure you mix each set of ingredients well. Mine came out very much like my homemade recipe does. Light but flavorful. Definitely will be using this recipe time and time again! Happy baking!

The flavor of this cake is very good, however the texture is that of a boxed mix.  For me a pound cake has a dense structure with very little crumb and that isn't the case with this recipe.  I will make it again, but I won't advertise it as pound cake.

This recipe make a pretty good pound cake. If you're in a hurry and don't want to do a scratch cake, this will certainly fool your guests. We enjoyed it as written. I garnished with fresh sliced strawberries and real whipped cream. Thanks Patsy!

This cake is awsome, when my grandmother used to make pound cake she would dust the pan with powdered sugar instead of flour, it makes a nice sugary crust on the outside of the cake, no need for icing or glaze. I did it when I made this one and it was awsome, I have had countless requests for this recipe when I make it. It is very good with a Lemon Cake mix, lemon pudding and lemon extract!

Oh my goodness, this cake is gorgeous.  I did make a few changes, not because the recipe called for it but just to meet my pantry ingredients.  I used a Duncan Hines WHITE cake mix, used 4 oz sour cream and 4 oz of vanilla yogurt.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and only had to cook for 60 minutes.  The result was one light and tasty pound cake.  No one would ever guess this started life in a box!

I love this easy cheaters pound cake recipe. I used this recipe to make an Almond pound cake by using two t. spoons of almond instead of the vanilla and lemon. My friends and family loved it and it was gone in not time. I also used this recipe to make a lemon raspberry pound cake by switching the yellow cake mix for the lemon supreme cake mix. You can use what ever flavor combinations you like.

**********On a scale of 1-10, I give this a 20!!!!   AWESOME, easy and flexible.  Needed something in a hurry and wanting to use what I already had, I chose this.  I substituted plain yellow cake mix for "butter" flavor and used the zest of 1 small orange instead of lemon extract.  Out of the oven, you could easily eat a small loaf, NO PROBLEM!  Note:  flour and grease pans well as they tend to stick, even after cooled.

I have used this recipe many times using Duncan Hines Yellow butter recipe (16.5 oz). After adding the eggs to the butter and the sugar, let the mixture beat for 2 minutes.  Then add the flavor, mix in.  Then add the sour cream and water, mix in.  Last, add in flour and cake mix.  Mix well and beat for 2 minutes on medium.  The batter will have the texture of a pound cake.  It only takes 50 to 55 minutes to cook in an aluminum pan, slightly less time in a dark pan.  Hope this helps those who did not have success the first time.  This recipe also works well for layer and sheet cakes. I get rave reviews all the time and everyone thinks its made from scratch.

Not that great; I've had better dressed-up cake mixes. This one tasted almost too "eggy" to me. My husband like it, but he'll eat almost anything! :-) Won't make again.

Don't eat it the first day, I made that mistake the first time.  It still tastes like a boxed mixed then.  If you wait a day, the flavors seem to meld and it takes on the right texture and taste.  Don't know how but it tasted like a scratch made pound cake then.  I make this recipe most often to use as a base for strawberry shortcake.

I followed the recipe except for the lemon extract an this came out really good...I love the fact it started out as your typical box cake.  I topped mine withe powdered sugar and cinnamon.  I used baking spray and it was done in just under 1 hr.  Next time I think I will use the butter cake mix as others had suggested and double the vanilla.  The family loved it!

This is a great basic recipe using a boxed cake mix. I used a German Chocolate cake mix and then added half a tub of German Chocolate frosting to the mix and it was heavenly!

Overall, this pound cake was only ok.  I'm in the camp that thinks a pound cake should be less crumbly, less airy, and more dense.  Flavor was nice, but texture could use some work.  By the way, I didn't use any lemon extract.

My husband loves this cake.  It's so easy. I've also changed the cake mix flavor and extracts to create a variety of different cakes. Delicious plain or topped with strawberries and whipped cream.

I made this cake a couple of weeks ago for my family and they LOVED IT!!! It was so delicious! I used Duncan Hines Butter cake mix (as suggested by a previous reviewer). I followed the recipe otherwise. This recipe is a keeper!

This is truly the best pound cake out there! I used white cake mix and omitted the lemon flavoring. Three tiers layered with *Devonshire Cream* recipe from Allrecipes, and fresh strawberries around the edges for a beautiful strawberry shortcake wedding cake. People are asking for another wedding so they can get some more!

this is pound cake perfection!!  i love this recipe.  my only change is to use nonfat greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, and to omit the lemon extract.   i served with two sides - chocolate frosting and cherry pie filling - and let people choose how to top it.  some had it plain, some used both chocolate and cherries.  but everyone thought it was a great cake.  super easy and no-fail for sure!  thank you!

My husband loves this cake.  I have made it several times and it always comes out moist and delicious.  Only thing I advise is to add sour cream first then gradually add water or the mix will splash everywhere!! I bake for 50 min. at 350* Enjoy!!

This is indeed a delicious CAKE but not what Southerns would call a Pound Cake. The only adjustment I made was add a touch bit more of lemon extract and then I followed it with a lemon glaze once the cake was cooled (2 TBSP of melted butter, about a cup and half of powdered sugar, dash of lemon extract, and 3 good squirts of concentrate lemon juice; mix and pour/drizzle over cooled cake).

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. This doesn't even look like pound cake and the consistency is the same as a regular "cake from a box". Pound cake is supposed to be dense, not airy. I used the mini loaf pans and the cake stuck so bad that they all fell apart when I tried to get them out of the pan. What a waste! I will never use this recipe again. Not sure what everyone else likes about this recipe!

It was very good, and pretty easy to make. I used 1 TBSP vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extract instead of the lemon. I baked for 40 minutes, and it was perfect. It was good, but it was maybe a tad too sweet? It was also not as "buttery" as I like. Still a very good recipe.

Pretty easy and turned out nicely. I used a vanilla cake box mix and subbed in the zest and juice of a lemon instead of the lemon extract. 

Next time, I could try another lemon and I REALLY should sift the cake mix. It made the batter quite lumpy!

Oh, and I could try another recommendation to use devil's food cake mix and chocolate chips.

I am usually very skeptical of using cake mixes (okay, I'm a bit of a cake snob) but this worked very well. I notice that another reviewer kept saying she would omit the oil...what oil? I made it exactly as written, NOT making the cake according to the box, but dumping the mix in dry. I added two tsp. good vanilla, a tsp. almond extract and a tsp. of rum extract. After I turned the warm cake out on a rack to cool, I drizzled a light glaze made of confectioners' sugar, a little water and a tsp. each of vanilla, rum and almond extracts. My husband and father loved it, as did I. If I have to use cake mix I buy Duncan Hines ONLY...no other brand...ever. I used the Golden Butter Duncan Hines cake mix and this made up very well with my few tweaks. You don't need to cook it 60 minutes. I think 50- 55 tops would do it, although ovens do vary. This is a very good cake, especially with coffee.

I made this cake to top with strawberries for strawberry shortcake.  I did not have lemon extract so I used tsp of vanilla but that was the only change I made.  We ate some the first day after it cooled and it was good but not really and dense as regular pound cake.  The next day it had the perfect pound cake texture though!  If possible make this a day ahead, it makes a big difference to let it sit a day.  It was still great the same day for strawberry shortcake though.  It did seem a tad sweet is my only complaint, I may cut the sugar in half next time.  I think this recipe would be amazing if made with a lemon cake mix too.

I used a little additional lemon and vanilla extract and what really made the difference for my husband (who absolutely loves this cake) was: instead of using flour when preparing the pan, i used confectioners' sugar.  i used a small sifter and sifted it right into the greased pan.  Gave the cake a delightful crustiness while the rest of the cake was very moist.  Take it from my husband who has had a slice of "pounder" for about 30 years now - this cake is TOPS!!!  (I've already made it many times!)  Thank you so much for the great recipe!!!

I am so glad I waited to write this review.  When my cake had cooled I had a piece and thought it was very good but not the consistency of pound cake.  Surprise, next day it was perfect pound cake.  Will make this one again and again.

I don't know what I did wrong but this cake didn't taste good at all, and it was crumbly.  I normally use my own pound cake recipe, and everyone likes it.  I took this to church and brought most of it home!  Anyway, I guess I'll use it in a trifle.

I had this pound cake at a friend's house the other day and WOW was it delicious!!! We were all oohing and ahhing over how moist and delicious it was. And of course, everyone wanted the recipe! :) I like the fact that it saves a lot of steps & ingredients by adding a mix. It turned out as tasty as any I have had.I can't wait to make one of my own!!

This cake was awesome! I really suck at making cakes, so if I can make this one anyone can! it had a lovely light lemon flavour, and nice moist texture. I did not have sour cream so I subbed 3/4 cup sour milk (milk with 1 Tbsp vinegar) and added 1/3 cup butter when creaming the butter and sugar. 

I served each slice with a generous amount of homemade strawberry rhubarb compote. the tartness of the compote really worked with the sweetness of the cake.

I found this recipe simple and delicious! I took advice from other reviewers and cut back on the sugar. This helped because the cake was sweet even when I cut back on the sugar. I was hesitant with using yellow cake mix, but it worked. I enjoyed this recipe and will use it again.

I agree this is not a pound cake, but I will say it makes one hell of a bundt cake! I tried this cake for Sunday dinner and it was a hit! This recipe is simple and you can make alterations without damaging the final product. I didn't have vanilla extract so I used double lemon extract. Next time I plan on adding more butter. TRY IT YOU"LL LOVE IT!

I used it a few times as listed then used chocolate cake mix and the most recent time I made it I used gluten free cake mix and coconut flour and all purpose gluten free flour. Which turned out really great. I was very pleased. I as many of you am always very resistant to use mixes but I was impressed and it made gluten free baking so easy! Thanks for you great recipe.

Contrary to naples34102's opinion, in my opinion, I think this was a vast improvement on a plain cake mix (I used BUTTERY yellow). It got rave reviews at a church fellowship; no one guessed it was from a box. I didn't have any lemon extract, so I tried almond. I had just under a teaspoon left in the bottle, but used it anyway. It gave just a hint of something that made it taste DELISH! In my oven, I did only need to bake it about 50-55 minutes. Thanks for a great way to dress up a cake mix! I'm adding lemon extract to my grocery list so I can try it that way next time!

Very nice, a oh so moist.  I used a white cake mix.. the eggs make it yellow anyway :)  Also used butter flavor extract in place of lemon (didn't have any)  So very good and doesn't even need frosting.  All I did was sprinkle a little powdered sugar for presentation.

This came out great!    I substituted peach brandy for 1/2 of the water and added a little almond extract.  Next time I think that I'll up the peach brandy though.....I liked the taste enough to want some more.

I don't know if I'd call it a "no fail" poundcake...it was quite crumbly.  But it was okay cause I used for trifle.

This was the best pound cake I have ever tasted! Very light texture and wonderful taste. I prepared mine in 2 loaf pans and sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top for an added treat! Turned out great. It was yummy served with cool whip and strawberries.

It is a bit lighter than a true pound cake, but denser than regular cake. As part of a recipe, it's fine. Standing alone, you can tell it's not pound cake. I frosted it so it passed as pound cake. I needed a big cake, so this was better than boxed pound cake mix, which yields only 9x5 loaf. PREPARATION TIPS: use a stand mixer....this makes a lot of thick batter...not pourable. Baked mine in a 9x13 glass pan for 35 mins.  My topping was 8 oz cream cheese, 8oz whipped topping (tub style) and 1/4-1/2 cup confectioners sugar blended. Frost cake and top with sliced strawberries. Very pretty. Thanks Patsy.

I made this recipe as written save adjustments for our high altitude here in New Mexico and a substitution of ingredients.  I only had a lemon cake mix so I used that.  Since we live at 6500 feet, I did the following for the cake: 1)reduced sugar by a tbl, increased the extracts by half, increased water by a tbl and increased flour by 2 tbl.  The cake cooked for only an hour.  The crumb is not the lightest I have ever eaten, but that could be due to the fact that I was trying to make it altitude friendly.

First time making pound cake, this recipe is out of this world good. As suggested before, I use a butter cake mix and also added 1 tsp orange extract. Served it with fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries and extra creamy cool whip. Great reviews by co-workers. Thanks for the recipe!

I found out about this website from a co-worker, and I just love it!  My boyfriend requested a pound cake for his bithday. After a full day of work, this recipe was perfect! Quick, easy to follow and not a lot of ingredients.  The cake was wonderful. It was very moist and more importantly, he loved it!!

excellent cake. I used almond extract, and would recommend even more like 2-3 TBSP of it, to bring the flavor to the forefront. I used a "castle" bundt cake, and I must have not pam-sprayed it enough, so it was broken, as I got the cake out of the pan. I patched it all together, using a glaze, and since it was for Easter, decorated it with Peeps, jelly beans, and green coconut, in the center. It was a hit!! Very moist, good cake. Try it!!

This is not a pound cake, the taste is similar but it is really a bundt cake- More dense than a layer/sheet cake.
I made just 2 minor changes...1/3 c buttermilk in place of half the water, and I used almond extract and butter flavoring instead of the vanilla/lemon.  I figure the cake is already vanilla flavored!!
One hour in a tube/bundt pan and it came out wonderfully!!! MMmmmmmm!!!
I served balsamic strawberries over it, but next time I think I will make a streusel layer in the middle with cinnamon, pecans and sugar, and glaze the top!!

Five stars!  This recipe turned out fantastic.  I did make changes, but with using a cake mix, I think most probably will.  I used almond extract in place of the lemon since I used milk chocolate cake mix.  I used 2/3 buttermilk instead of water and 8 oz of fat free yogurt instead of sour cream.  This recipe turned out very chocolately and tangy.  VERY good and very easy.

Just made this and it's pretty good. The only change I made was I substituted lemon juice for the water. This is not a pound cake, it is a dressed up boxed cake. I will make it again, just note for me, in my gas oven,  the cooking time was 90 minutes and I could have left it in longer. But it is good...

This is a veiry good place to start if you are new to baking and still want something that has a 'from-scratch' flavor but you do not want the 'from-scratch' hassle.  My only complain is that it is a tad bit dry, and you can even see that from the featured picture.  Pound cakes should be more dense, and this one has a pretty good crumb to it.  I think I would add an extra egg next time and maybe a full cup of liquid or a few Tbsp. of pudding mix.  Overall it's a great place to start experimenting.  It's very similar to the White Almond Sour Cream Cake that is very popular among cake decorators...combines box mix with scratch ingredients.

I made this cake last night and my husband that is used to scratch cakes that I make said that this was an excellent faux pound cake.  I rarely make boxed cakes so this was a first for me and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe except instead of lemon extract I just doubled the vanilla extract.

Anyone who rates this lower than a "4" must have done something wrong! This is so good! I made this for a wedding shower (with icing) and everyone who tried it said it was the best cake they had ever had. I normally don't even like pound cake or yellow cake at all but even I ate some of it. Amazing recipe! The only tip I have is DON'T try to double the recipe and use a stand mixer LoL because it will spill over.

Sorry, there was not itme to take pictures. I made this for my husbands birthday as pound cake is his favourite. This recipe did not disappoint. The only change I made was to replace the lemon with almond for a light almond flavour (my husband's prefernce). Would use this recipe again for sure! Thanks

Very tasty! I added 1 1/2 cups of blueberries (rolled in flour) to mine. Topped it with a glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar. Family gobbled it up!

I've made this cake twice and both times it turned out great. A nice way to change it up is to play with the flavorings - I included vanilla, but switched the other out - lemon, almond, etc.  It's a very versatile recipe - we'll be making it again!

I am no baker by any means, but I must say this recipe is outstanding.  I made it with my 6 year old grandson over the holidays and my family just loved it, especially the grandson.

This was a tasty cake!  Not as heavy as a pound cake and very moist.  I used a vanilla cake mix instead of yellow and 1 Tbsp vanilla extract instead of the 1 tsp called for and the 1 tsp of lemon extract.  Thanks for an easy, quick recipe

The perfect easy pound cake recipe. With the chocolate caramel rasberry sauce, it tasted even better! That sauce was made for a pound cake and you can find the recipe on allrecipes.com! Talk about a 1-2-3 easy recipe! For either!

I am giving it a 5 because the taste was great, probably the best I ever tasted, however, the cake was quite crumbly.  Not the consistency I think of when I think of a pound cake.

This was very moist.  I used almond extract instead of lemon and used a white cake mix instead of yellow!  I cut up some fresh strawberries and it made a yummy strawberry shortcake!!

Well received! Made 4 mini loaves with Betty Crocker butter cake mix, omitted the lemon extract. Served with a fresh strawberry topping. Great flavor, but would prefer my pound cake a little bit denser. Will Definitely make again. Thanks!

This was just delicious. I'd bet it would be good with a 1/4 cup of cocoa added too (which I plan to try next go round). I glazed the top with my 'Sour Cream Frosting' recipe (located on this site).

At first I wasn't completely impressed with this cake.  It's better completely cooled than warm.  The second time I tasted it, I really liked it. My husband wanted to eat it for breakfast. It's not the best pound cake I've ever tasted, but it is very good and quite easy.  I'll make it again next time I buy half a flat of strawberries. I halved the recipe, only using one egg instead of 1 1/2 and baked it in a loaf pan.

Just made this cake for the first time last night.  It was simple, but delicious.  It's a lighter texture than regular pound cake.  I baked it in a tube pan rather than a bundt pan, and it only took about an hour.  I've had three phone calls about it already, and it was just cut!  I frosted it with a buttercream frosting, per the request of the birthday girl, and it's great!  Thanks for a recipe that will be used again!

This cake was ready to go in the oven when I discovered my oven was broken.  There it sat for about half an hour while I tried to figure out what to do.  I decided to bake it in my toaster oven and, to my surprise, it still came out perfect.  I did not add the lemon extract, but substituted extra vanilla and a little butter extract. Served it with sliced strawberries and Cool Whip, and it was wonderful.

This was a very good recipe to try!!  I made this with butter/nut in place of the vanilla and lemon flavoring and it had a very good flavor...although I could plainly taste the cake mix...it still had the flavor and good texture...remember to mix as directed...to much mixing will incorporate too much air and the batter could flow over the edges!!!

Mine baked in 45 @350. I started checking with a skewer at 40 min and the outer portion of the cake was done. Baked 5 more minutes. Made exactly as written. Very yummy cake. Will make this many times for my hubby who prefers cake with no frosting.

YES, the boxed cake mixes are smaller than they used to be, so you need to make adjustments.  If you don't, the cake will be too moist and not come out of the pan nicely (hence, the falling apart others have noted.)   We loved the texture and flavor; I glazed my cake.  Great on its own, or with crushed strawberries.

I did add a package of lemon pudding mix, as my cake mix was only 15.25 oz.  Had a good flavor, but I prefer a more dense pound cake.

I used the suggestions in Amelie Hinson's review (5 eggs, 1 C butter) and another person's suggestion (1 TLB vanilla) & was rewarded with a fantastic cake.  I was out of lemon extract so substituted the juice of 1/2 of a medium size lemon.  The cake batter filled the pan more than previous recipes the I've used and rose nicely.  I found that 55 minutes was sufficient baking time.  It was heavenly with crushed strawberries, ice cream and whipped cream.    It was also delicious the next day, plain, as a snack while hiking.  I will definitely be making this cake again.

I hate to be the one negative review in so many outstanding ones.  But something is wrong with this recipe.  I was so determined I made it 4 times!  I just fell apart when trying to remove it from the pan. (I used Bundt cake pans.)  And of course I used Pam spray and flour to grease the pan.

I noticed later that it calls for an 18.25 ounce package of yellow cake mix.  Do you know cake mixes today all come in 15.25 ounces?  So that is what I had to use. Don't know but possibly this may have contributed to the failures.  It was certainly not a No-Fail recipe for me!  It tasted OK, but looked terrible.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for....except I baked it in 2 loaf pans (50 minutes).  I will probably use a little less lemon extract next time....a little too "lemony" for us.

This is fabulous!  I followed the recipe, and it needs no alterations.  I've also used the same additions for other flavors, and it is wonderful each time. I'm very particular with baked goods; this recipe receives high marks!

Made it yesterday following the recipe exactly and it was great.  Tried this AM and it was fantastic probably because the flavors had time to meld.  Much better than Starbuck's.  It would be nice to include a glaze recipe.  Can this be made in a 9X13 pan?  What would the bake time be in a 9X13?

this may be the best pound cake I've ever had the opportunity to make and devour LOL I did substitute sour cream for a mixture of milk and vinegar, and extra butter. It was hands down the most wonderful tasting pound cake ever! I love to cook and bake it is my passion. I use the pound cake in a trifle and it was outstanding I can't say enough about this recipe it should be five star all around if it's not somebody made a big opps

This is my go to pound cake.  I mix up the cake mix flavors and the flavor extracts to match.  This is a very versatile cake mix.  I use it as a base.  I add a little more sugar and flour to take the cake mix taste out.  Works well for me.  My family has no idea I use cake mix as a base for this cake.

This is by far the best pound cake recipe using a cake mix. I have used this recipe for years and have never been disappointed with it. I add a glaze after it is out of the oven by mixing lemon juice and powdered sugar and drizzle over the top. This is the cake my daughter requests every year for her birthday. Such a good recipe.

Great hit for the holiday.  Houseful of males ( all ages) couldn’t get enough.  The cake was dense but moist and just sweet enough to be a dessert without being overpowering.

I used butter yellow cake mix, used buttermilk instead of water and added an egg yolk. It was moist and more dense than just plain ol cake mix. 
 It has a distinct cake flavor. Maybe, I should have used butter flavoring in addition to vanilla?

I made this cake for my husband's relatives and they raved about this cake!  I didn't have sour cream and substituted milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice which I let sit for 5 min. before I added it to the recipe.  I made a Country Time Lemonade Glaze and finished off the cake with fresh fan sliced strawberries which were placed in the middle of the cake ( I filled the hole in the middle of the bundt cake )!

P.S. I was told by the folk don't change a thing when I make the cake again. The cake was perfect!!!!!

My husband loves Pound Cake.  I decided, at the last minute, to make him a Pound Cake for his Birthday.  I found this recipe.  He LOVED it!   I am a Cook not a Baker, but I was able to make this cake without fail!  Perfect title for this recipe!  Wonderful recipe!  Thank you for saving my Hubby's birthday.

I didn't have lemon juice so I used a lemon cake mix and a Tablespoon of vanilla with a pinch or two extra flour. I used a loaf pan and it was absolutely the easiest and tastiest I've ever made!!! Definitely going to be a holiday mininloaf food gift with coffee!

I made this cake with a DH Vanilla Mix. I added milk instead of water; replaced the lemon with almond extract and added a package of vanilla sugar. Since I do not have a bundt pan,  I used two loaf pans. I split the dough evenly; I added a couple of tablespoons of Nutella to about 1 cup of the mix and swirled it into the batter in one of the loaf pans. Now I have one "white" cake and one "marbled." I tried a little piece and it tastes very nice. I baked them for about 55 minutes at 340.

I love this cake have made it several times! Today I had a bunch of blueberries to use...I followed the recipe but added zest of one lemon and the juice. I sprinkled wondra flour over the frozen berries and folded them in..made butter crumbs 2/3 cup each flour and sugar and three quarters stick of butter mix till crumbled..I put two thirds on the cake Before baking  and after the cake is removed from pan sprinkle on remainder.out of this world. Berries do not sink..I wait till the next day before serving..but that is difficult!

First pound cake I have ever made.  It came out perfectly and was very tasty for a "cheater" cake.

I am in search of a great pound cake.  This is good, but still seems cake mix like and not dense enough. It is moist, but not what I expected.

Very easy and quick.. I didn't have any lemon extract so I used 3teaspoons of Lemon juice and a little less water. I sure can't wait to make another one using cake mixes...Thanks....

This is not your dense pound cake but a good quick alternative.  I made it for strawberry shortcake as my husband isn't a big fan of "shortcake".  It was tasty and moist enough to eat alone.  I'd make it again.

Delicious!!  Served with the Balsamic Strawberries from this site on top of the cake.  The combination was incredible, but the cake on it's own is dense,  moist and flavorable.  I only have a 9 1/2 inch bundt pan so left a little bit of batter out.  Took out of oven at exactly 60 minutes.  Everybody loved it.  My skinny 18 year old had five servings.  Finally had to stop him!

This cake was very tasty and had a wonderful soft moist texture but it was not  a pound cake.  It did not have the density, crumb or taste of traditional pound cake.  If you want pound cake this is not the recipe but if you want something lighter and softer with the look of pound cake this is excellent.  It could be the pound cake for people who don't like pound cake.

Delicious! The only change I made to the recipe was instead of using lemon extract I used almond, as others had suggested. Though I do not usually like box cake mix, I really liked this recipe. Tasted great warm out of the oven and my husband loved it!

I love making easy recipes.This cake is so easy and moist. I recommend making the cake a day before serving because it is so much better the next day. Thanks so much for bringing this recipe to my family.

I love recipes that start with a box mix - so easy to prepare.  Try adding the zest and juice of one lemon to this recipe and drizzle with a tart lemon glaze.  Heaven!

Easy to make cake and I will definitely try it again.  I made the mistake of leaving it in the oven too long and it overbaked.  This cake also didn't come out as dense as other pound cakes.  But, the recipe is worthy of experimentation.  In my book - this is a keeper.
