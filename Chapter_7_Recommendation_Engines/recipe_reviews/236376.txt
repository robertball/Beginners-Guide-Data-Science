Red Velvet lovers, this is your recipe. It's so easy and awesome. God bless you for sharing this.  I was *supposed* to save this for a V-day treat. My DH said 'but honey, i love you every day' so I made it for the family without the frosting mixed in and piped a frosting heart on top. Everyone had sparkles in their eyes.
