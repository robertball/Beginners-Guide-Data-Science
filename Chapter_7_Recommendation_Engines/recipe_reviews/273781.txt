7.13.19 You do get a nice tang from the buttermilk but for me the dressing ended up a bit dry. The recipe doesn t say to cool the potatoes mine were still pretty warm and I think they soaked up some of the dressing. If I make this again I d try 2 parts salad dressing and 1 part sour cream which I suppose would make it more like normal potato salad and would cool the potatoes before adding the dressing. Also pretty heavy on the bacon for us but both of these comments just may be personal taste. Honestly I forgot to add the cheddar cheese but I think that would be a really good addition. SharonLynnKinville thanks for sharing your recipe.
