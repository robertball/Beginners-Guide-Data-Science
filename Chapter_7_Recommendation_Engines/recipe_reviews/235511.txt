Very good. To get a "creamy" soup. I used chicken bouillon and all milk for the liquid in the soup. Did not have turkey, just used more ham. Did not have any peas on hand. Will make this again and hopefully have peas the next time.

This is such an easy soup to prepare and so delicious. Made it tonight when it was -5 degrees outside. This is a keeper. Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

I added leftover mashed potatoes after veggies were cooked. Also garlic to veggies. Addition of potatoes nicely thickened the soup, making a reux unnecessary and making this a bit healthier. Nice use of leftover Easter ham, thank you!

This soup was delicious. I made it for dinner tonight and was perfect for a very cold ,windy day. I did not include the turkey as I thought the ham was enough.I had to make some adjustments by using some ingredients  but in different form or substitute. I had no Asparagus  but had Asparagus broth in my freezer. (I keep a variety of broths in my freezer. They come in handy) So I substituted the cup of water for 1 1/2 cups of Asparagus broth. I used frozen peas instead of canned. I try to stay away from processed foods as much as possible. I did not have Red potatoes but had some beautiful Russet potatoes with nice skins so I kept skins on.  I really enjoyed the butternut squash in this soup. This will be a new soup to make on regular bases .

This soup was great! I made it for my daughter recovering from surgery. The whole family came by to see her and wish her well so I doubled the recipe there was plenty left for her family for the next day! I substituted corn in place of celery. Also omitted the turkey, had a bigger portion ham. Everyone loved it. This is a keeper!

Just delicious. My husband liked it. I didn't have Italian seasoning, so used oregano. I put the spices in while it cooked for the first 15 minutes. I think the asparagus added a lot to the flavor. Will make this again. A quick and flavor rich soup.

I made attempted this soup for the first time for my moms 50th surprise party and it was the hit of the party!!!!! I am not familiar with cooking whatsoever so having this recipe and the easy directions made it so easy...with that being said it never said anything about taking the bayleaves out after adding them so they stayed in the soup so that was a bummer because I had to pick out the leaves that were crumbled in there. So rookie mistake I know but I would definitely make this again. Loved it and I didn't change a thing!! For some reason it won't let me rate it but it's a 5+ in my book.

This was really pretty great! This was the first soup I've made from scratch (not counting jambalaya as a soup) and the whole family is impressed. I followed the directions exactly, as I tend to do for the first time through. The only thing I KNOW I'll change for next time is significantly cutting the onions. I'm not an onion person (in fact, I buy them pre-chopped!) but I know that for simmering/slow cooked recipes, they help. If you love onion, keep it as is! Also, my little girls said it was a bit spicy so I may use a bit less pepper next time I make it for the family.

This was outstanding!  We've cut out white and refined carbs from our diet for health reasons.  I really wanted a potato soup but couldn't use white potatoes.  This recipe was perfect, even my picky family declared it the best potato soup they'd ever had.

I did make 3 changes: 1- left out the corn (empty carbs) 2- I ran it through the blender when it was all done cooking until it was smooth and then added some more ham chunks at the end and 3- substituted 5tbsp of whole wheat flour in the rue
