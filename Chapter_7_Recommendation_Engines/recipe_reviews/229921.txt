Made for dinner. I didn't have puff pastry, so substituted fresh pizza dough.  Rolled into large rectangle, filled, and braided. Brushed top with rosemary garlic olive oil.  Substituted chicken Habanero sausage for apple chicken sausage and substituted chopped apple for grapes. Once all assembled, I let the pizza dough rise and puff up a bit. I actually forgot to add the cheese mixture, but tucked bits of it into the braid after it was assembled and that worked okay.  This was really good and I can't wait to make it again for company.  It has a great presentation. Would be easy to make up ahead of time, get everything cleaned up, then bake and serve.  Thanks for this great idea and wonderful combination of flavors

So many different flavors that all work really well together:  sweet potatoes, grapes, red peppers and blue cheese!  Two out of three of my children love this braid.

This was delicious. I left out the bell peppers and celery and added extra red onion and two handfuls of fresh spinach .  I spread the cheese mixture directly on the puff pastry for even distribution.

Pretty tasty! I don't care for blue cheese, so I swapped it out for feta and some shredded cheese I had in my fridge. Also, I couldn't find puff pastry sheets, so I used crescent dough sheets instead. I like the mix of foods and tastes used, but the combination of those with cream cheese and the cheese mixture I used seemed a little odd to me (could just be my changes to the cheese used). I thought I messed up the braid, but it still looked beautiful and made a lot of food!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was incredible. All the different tastes and textures? Yum Yum. Here comes the but - and it was probably my fault - the blue cheese mixture didn't coat or melt over the ingredients.
