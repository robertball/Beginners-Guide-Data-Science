Perfect for a snack. Make sure to use carob chips and not chocolate - it last longer and no melting issues!

Pretty good. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of carob. Very simple--good quick snack for long car rides. I plan on making this to pack in school lunches this next school year, too. I think next time I might use peanuts.

I made this to take camping along with a few other trail mixes in little baggies.  This one was the least eaten.  It's not as visually exciting as other mixes and the sunflower seeds fell to the bottom. I did use chocolate chips and did not have any problems with them melting.
