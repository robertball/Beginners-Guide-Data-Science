This makes enough sauce for 2-3 14" pizzas. Put the mixed sauce in a covered plastic container and use what you need, then refrigerate the rest for up to 2 weeks. Use as much or as little as you like under your toppings depending on your personal taste. Cindy in Pensacola said it had too much garlic, but she added twice as much as the recipe says. All opinions are appreciated, but please be fair and give a rating based on the "actual" recipe. Thank you to all who try my recipe. There are so many it can be hard to choose.

This had WAY too much garlic for us.  I should have known when I was adding it but my hubby couldn't even eat it, and I ate 2 pieces only.. I'd make it again only using 1 tsp of garlic, not 2 tblsp.

Just what I was looking for - a flavorful marinara with just tomato paste as a base!  This recipe is definitely on the spicy side, which I love!  We used this for a dipping sauce but I can't wait to try it on homemade pizza, it will be perfect!!!!  Great recipe!!!!

Made this awesome sauce yesterday & refrigerated overnight.  I made a pizza today and all I can say is WOW!!  This is great sauce.  I did cut back the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. because I use a very spicy sausage on my pizza.  I also reduced the garlic to 1 tsp.  & used regular salt.  This is my new favorite sauce.  My old one required cooking ... this is so much easier & even better tasting!  Thanks Tracy Ann for a great pizza sauce recipe!!

Easy to make and just the right amount of spice. Can't eat garlic so I eliminated the minced garlic and substituted garlic salt with sea salt. My husband and I both loved it.

Since the recipe did not state if it was dried minced garlic or fresh, I used dried minced since it was quickly available.This was entirely too much garlic. I had to add 4-15 oz cans tomato sauce and 4 additional teaspoons Italian seasoning to make it edible. I omitted the garlic salt and added 1 tsp. Salt  instead. I reduced the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp,  because we are not too fond of spicy foods.

Delicious.  I found a low carbohydrate pizza crust recipe and I was looking for a pizza sauce recipe without added sugar to make with it.  After reading the review about the garlic and looking at the amount of garlic in the recipe, I only used half of a tablespoon of garlic, and even then, it still tasted pretty strong.  Still, I will make this again and maybe use only half or one teaspoon of minced garlic.  I added the minced garlic last, and the garlic salt alone didn't taste like it was enough.
