Horrible! Sorry, my husband and I both thought it was awful. Too much rosemary and not enough of anything else.

It's quick and easy, but we made our rice seperate the 2nd time.  Didn't like the rice cooked the way the recipe said.  The chicken has a great flavor the whole family loved.

This is a nice dish, especially if you like rosemary.  Fairly simple to make & fast too.  I had to add a lot of salt, though... but that's my personal taste.  Thanks for sharing it.

My husband thought it was too bland. I used thicker chicken so took much longer to cook. The taste was just ok. I don't think I will cook again.

I didn't eat this myself but I was told that the chicken was very good, but the rice was pretty bad.  Won't make this again.

Too much rosemary and chicken was dry.  Would've been better to cook rice seperate.

Definitely a hit!  Next time I'll use more rice because there didn't seem to be enough when using the portions that the recipe called for.  You also might want to add some vegetables to the mix for a little variety.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I cut the chicken breast into cubes to make it easier to eat with the rice.  I looked sort of like a stew.  The recipe called for only one cup of rice...I think I will do two cups next time.

I am giving this five stars, though I changed it to my liking.  I cooked brown basmati rice on the side, then at the end I threw the rice in to simmer with the chicken, rosemary, etc.  I don't know why they even bother with the garlic because you can't taste it...maybe it just adds salty flavor.  Anyway, the dish is simple, excellent with a good rosemary taste, and it can be made with ingredients that you generally would have around the house!  We will make it again for sure.

This was quite yummy.  We love garlic and rosemary together.  I didn't have minute rice, so I used regular white and cooked it separately with the broth, garlic and rosemary, and then cooked the chicken alone in a skillet and served together with broccoli.  very good!

I had to change some of the ingredients up, but this was absolutely yummy! I had very large chicken breasts so I cut them in half. I used a 14 oz. can low sodium chicken broth and 1/3 cup of water. I didn't have the instant brown rice, so I used regular. It took almost an hour longer to cook but it was well worth the wait!

I liked how the chicken turned out - but there was WAY too much liquid to rice ratio. You need to add 2 cups of the uncooked rice.  I will try this again sometime with the 2 cups and hopefully will turn out better.

My family loves this recipe.  Instead of leaving the breast whole, I cut it up in small pieces and pile on top of the brown rice.  I will also add peas or mixed veggies to the rice and add a dinner roll.  Its yummy as written also.
