I only made one change and that was using regular milk instead of almond milk. Very good.

Didn't have quite enough vanilla yogurt, so I had to add some strawberry yogurt which certainly wasn't a problem.  This is tasty and, also, is a good source of both fiber and protein (much better than many smoothies).

I enjoyed it! I added more milk as I thought it was too thick. Added a bit of protein powder also. Very berry and tasty.

Thereâ€™s no reason to skip out on the nutritional benefits of dairy, and every reason to skip the imitation of nut juice.

Super easy and tasty smoothie.  I didn't use the vanilla extract, because my yogurt was honey flavored.  And love chia seeds, but didn't shop the right store for the ingredients.  I would make this again.

I added some Agave because it wasn't quite sweet enough. Frozen strawberries aren't always the most flavorful.

I had to change the yogurt to plain and the milk to whole milk, but it still turned out really good.  I just recommend maybe adding ice to it to help thicken it up and cool it down instead of a room temperature "juice."

I was looking for something healthy this morning and decided to make this. I needed a little added stevia and a little extra almond milk to get the consistency right for me.
