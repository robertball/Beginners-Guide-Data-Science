Very Easy and traditional Chinese Cake. . .you don't need to change a thing! For red bean paste, make your own: one 15oz. can of red beans (I used kidney beans) and 1/2 cup white sugar and vegie oil for frying bean mixture.  Puree one 15oz. can beans in food processor.  To pureed beans add 1/2 c. white sugar - transfer to a well oiled fry pan and fry the beans until they reach the  consistency of a thick paste. I used the full recipe of bean paste for this cake, delicious!

Great recipe, but a little different from what I'm used to. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and used half the oil. I also used an entire can of bean paste. Otherwise this is great!

This is a great Asian dessert.  I cut down to 1/2 c of sugar instead of 1 and 1 c of milk instead of 2.5 c. And used 1 can of sweetened red bean paste.  I've already made it twice. Also tried baking in cupcake pans (24 cupcakes). It does take a longer time to pour mixture into each individual cupcake pans. But I would still make it again w/ the cupcake pans because they'll bake faster (20 mins at 350 degrees) and there won't be any cutting involved. Additionally, these cupcakes are easier to reheat after wards (this is only good served warm). Enjoy! : )

Perfect! My husband has a dairy allergy so I used a can of coconut milk (and then 1/2c of almond milk b/c I didn't want to open a second can to make up the difference). I also used rice oil instead of canola. No other changes and came out perfect! I felt like I was back in Taiwan.

We love this recipe.  My wife is Chinese and she makes this for holidays and even birthdays for the kids.  We had lost the recipe and are so happy to have found it here.  Bean paste is a rather common ingredient in Chinese deserts.  Yes, bean paste is gooey.  Hence, calling it a paste.  Be careful to only use a half can of bean paste or it is overwhelming. My wife drops teaspoons of the paste about every inch or so into the cake batte; this allows for the taste of the bean paste without overwhelming the  sticky cake.

What an easy recipe.  I got pretty confused by reading all the reviews so I did reduce the sugar and oil by 1/2 and used soy milk.  I made my own red bean paste using Azuki beans (whew, what a process) it turned out delish.  I will make this again.

I made this for a potluck meal with Chinese University students and their host families... and it was a huge hit, especially among the students! - So much so that we came home from the party and made a second one. Thanks!

Next time, I wouldn't even add the bean paste! When I  had it, it was smushy and gooey.... Otherwise, just skip the bean paste and it tastes fine!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used Wangzhihe red bean paste and also I did not add sesame because I ran out them. It turned out so well! It has crispy skins and soft and sticky inner part! All my friends enjoyed it!

This was good! My family enjoyed it a lot.  The sauce had great flavor .  I would next time make extra sauce and set some of it aside for extra to use.

My family is Chinese and we make rice cakes all the time. We lost the recipe for it and were delighted to find one here. I put only half the amount of oil the in the recipe and they still tasted great.

We had this for dessert with our Chinese Chicken salad from this site.  Instead of oil, I did use 1 cup of butter! (but it was really good:) I also added a tsp of vanilla for the family's taste.

Very good, I used the whole can of red beans, which was over whelming.  (I should have listened to the actual recipe!) but my family gobbled it all up pretty quick.  Very tasty!
