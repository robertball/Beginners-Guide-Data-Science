I really want to thank you "The Butterfly" for this!!! I just finished making it!!! We love it so much! Most Squash soups want you to add cinnamon or sugars, it just does not taste good to me, and I almost gave up on thinking I would like Squash soup. I did do a couple things different because I did not have everything stated. I used 1 can Chicken Stock and then ½ a can of water. I doubled the garlic, as we love garlic. I thought it needed to be thicker so I cooked a large potato in the microwave, then cut it up & added it to the soup. That did the trick. Next time I will know to add it with the squash. Oh, I did add some fresh ground sea salt that hit the spot for us. I mashed everything with a potato masher. I did not add to the blender to make it smooth, as after tasting it we liked the texture of how it turned out. It was great as it was & I was not going to add the Nutmeg & Yogurt (I used Sour Cream as I hate Yogurt) but I decided to try a small amount in a bowl to see how it would taste. Well, needles to say but WOW!!! I did not think this could get any better but I was so wrong!!! It tied all the flavors together and it was so AWSOME!!! Again, THANK YOU!!! THIS IS 10 STARS FOR US!

This is a simple and tasty use of in-season veg. I used fresh corn cut off the cob, and a fresh squash from the farmer's market. I used fresh basil, as I had no dried. I also added some spices; cayenne, cumin, and a little nutmeg. I did not use a blender or mixer, but just let it simmer longer, then mushed up the squash, so it was still a little chunky. Before serving I threw in some beet greens, as I needed to use them up, a dollop of whole milk yogurt (Stoneyfield's "cream top" is so good!), and a dash of paprika and a basil leaf for presentation. Yum :)

I make this soup often and freeze servings for a low calorie, weight watchers friendly lunch. I pierce my squash and microwave it for 10 minutes. I can then simply scoop out the squash without peeling. I use Better than Bouillon brand vegetarian soup base. I only use two teaspoons for 3 cups of water. I purée the cooked squash and onions with my immersion blender before adding the corn.

I love this soup!  I add 2 sweet potatoes and use sour cream instead of yogurt.  I also just use chicken broth.  Soooo good.  It reminds me of Fall though, not Summer.

I made this soup without the corn and it still came out well. I did substitute cinnamon for nutmeg. also added one granny smith apple and pureed that along with the squash. Yum.

A little heavy on the pepper, but otherwise wonderful! I used fat free half and half instead of yogurt and cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and it turned out beautifully.

This was really good. Maybe a little too peppery for my taste but it was very good. Next time I make this I will definitely only add 1/2 the pepper required though.

I loved this recipe. I totally agree that it is more of a winter vs. a summer type soup. Although, my children hated this. I am pretty good at making things kid friendly and my kids aren't terribly picky anyway. It is more of a grown up taste. It was not kid approved. I will try again with variations.

My husband, who is a vegetarian loved this.  My butternut squash was a little pale so I added two sweet potatoes to the soup.  Came out delicious.

Love, love, love this soup. This recipe was easy to make vegan holistic. I did not use any oil or milk and it still came out great. My toddler loved it.

Delicious!  I spiced this up with a 1 1/2 tablespoons of Mae Ploy Red Curry Paste, after I pureed in a food processor I added once can of cream corn!

Very good. I added a carrot to add some sweetness as well. Used sweet white frozen corn. And almond milk. Very good though could likely leave out the basil.

I didn't have plain yogurt or fresh corn, so I used lite sour cream and canned corn.  It was surprisingly sweet.  I tried cutting some of the sweetness with some lime juice and a little curry. It makes a lot of very pretty soup.  But it was a tad sweet for my tastes.

Super yummy but this is a fall recipe. Butternut squash is in season in the fall,  so it's expensive during the summer season. We will make it again in the fall.

Excellent and easy.  I had everything in the kitchen including fresh corn.  My butternut squash was big, so I had to double the veg broth, and added the steamed corn after I had puréed the squash.  Will sprinkle a little cayenne pepper on the top when I serve.  My kids love this!
