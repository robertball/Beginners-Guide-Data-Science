Easy, fast, and we liked it. I sprinkled the chicken with Season All before cooking. I will fix this again for a quick weeknight meal.

When I make this for my family we lay the chicken on a bed of rice an some vegetables. Its like baking a side with the main course.

Love this recipe, but it took me almost twice as long.  The chicken was raw after 25 minutes; it took about 50 for me.  Great garnished with parsley.  I've seen other recipes that add a little chive and onion cream cheese if you want a richer sauce. (I although I think it tastes plenty rich without too.)

I think adding some french fried onions during the last 5 min would have made it AWSOME! However, my picky eaters (my 6yr old and 4 yr old) said it was "SUPER YUMMY" just the way the it was!

Next time I think I'll use cream of chicken and add some herbs.

This is definitely my go-to recipe for something quick and easy.  I like this recipe as it is.  Nothing over the top but a decent and hearty meal. To mix things up on occasion, I sometimes use Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup instead or will mix two tablespoons of poultry seasoning and/or garlic into the soup before pouring it over the chicken.

The chicken from my local supermarket was so full of water it diluted the sauce way too much. I suggest cooking the chicken alone first.Then pour off water/juices, add soup and continue cooking till done.
