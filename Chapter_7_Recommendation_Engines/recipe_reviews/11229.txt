good recipe, tastes just like the store bought.  I used crispix cereal and next time I'll use a 12 oz box instead of the 17.5 oz box to make it more chocolatey all over. With the bigger box, not all of the pieces were completely covered.

Just like I remember from Girl Scouts! The method that works best for me is to use the 16 oz box of chex, mix it in a BIG bowl, and shake in the powdered sugar 1/3 at a time in the cereal bag.

I wasn't sure if I should use this recipe or the one with only PB and chocolate chips as opposed to this one with butter, but I sure am glad I used this one! So are the kids! So delicious, and the hubby is taking some to work tonight. I will make this many, many more time.

Always a great dessert/snack, aka Sweet Minglers. It helps to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the saucepan after the ingredients have all melted together, just for flavor and also consistency of the choc/peanut butter/butter stuff.

Here is a tip from years of making puppy chow.... use a NEW clean garbage bag to mix the whole thing in. First, toss some powdered sugar in the bag, close it up and shake the heck out of it. This coats the sides which will make things stick less. Dump in the chocolately chex, add some powdered sugar, close the bag up (trapping air in it) and shake it again. Keep adding more powdered sugar until each piece stays separated and is the sweetness you want. Cleanup is a snap. Just toss the bag.

The flavor was good but I think the recipe calls for too much powdered sugar.  Everyone liked this so I will make it again, but I will cut down on the sugar.

Love this recipe for kids and adults!!  Very tasty....I served it in a new dog dish and the kids loved that. I did make and error and pick up the 12 oz box of cereal instead of the 17 1/2 oz box and found that I did not need the entire pound of powdered sugar....but might have needed it if I had the larger box of cereal. I used a store brand of Rice Chex and it tasted great. Didn't really need the name brand for this. Will definitely make this again. I can see it very popular at kid parties or to put in snack bags as treats for Halloween parties with a card stock tag shaped like a bone with "PUPPY CHOW" written on it.

Have never seen nor made recipe before this. Is is supposed to be really white? I reduced the icing sugar because it was really really sweet so mine turned out kinda greyish brown? Does it mean I need more icing sugar? I used margarine instead of butter and don't know if it makes a difference. They are delicious though, what ever color you get. The worst part about this recipe is that you cannot get Chex cereals in western Canada easily. I used Kellogg's crisp X. It worked great. Excuse me, I have to get back to my snack now....

Puppy chow is a staple in my home (my 4 year old autistic son struggles to get enough protein, so this is a nice way to sneak protein in!).  I love this recipe because things are "even".  Full stick of butter, full box (I also use a smaller 14oz box) of cereal, etc.  

I also agree you don't need a full pound of powedered sugar.  I make this every week or two, so I've got a system down:
melt the ingredients in the pan as stated
dump cereal in a big bowl
pour melted mixture over cereal and stir
sprinkle about 2 cups powdered sugar in a large bowl with a lid
pour the cereal mixture over the sugar, top with about 1 more cup sugar
cover bowl with lid and shake in various directions (hold the lid on!) to coat the cereal.  Add more sugar and repeat if needed.  

I keep this in a cookie jar for easy snacking.

Fantastic frozen. Next time I'll add a bit more peanut butter so that flavor stands out more.

I have never used butter when making puppy chow but boy was it good!  I used a smaller box of cereal (~12 oz.) and I thought it was the perfect amount for the chocolate I had.  Next time, I will use my hands to mix because the spoon crushed too many pieces.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and microwaved the butter, peanut butter and chocolate for 1 1/2 minutes (30 sec. intervals) and it was perfect.

I used a smaller size box of cereal because it's what I had, but I had to use a lot more powdered sugar.  It was yummy and easy though.

Can't go too wrong with this classic recipe, but I agree with others that there was way too much powdered sugar.  Less would be better.

YUM!!!  
I used semi sweet chips and I was glad I did!  I couldn't. Imagine how sweet it would be with a sweeter chocolate!

Just make sure to have someone on hand to take the bowl away from you, because it is hard to put down!  Will be making more for a party on the weekend!  My kid will LOVE this!

I never made or had anything like this before. My friend came over a few days ago with a bag of this puppy chow for me. She gave me the recipe but I decided to check it out on AllRecipe and this is the same exact recipe she used. It turned out fantastic! I used a box of Crispix instead of Chex. A full size box of Crispix is 12 ounces but that was more than enough cereal for this recipe.

So so good! A couple of changes/additions I make: use a 12 oz box, and add 1 tsp of vanilla to the melted mixture. I get a big big bowl and stir as I pour the melted mixture over the cereal. Once the cereal is coated, I take the bag that the cereal came in and add some powdered sugar and a few scoops of coated cereal and shake that bag! I repeat that a few times until the whole amount is done. Then pour into another big bowl and eat as much as I desire (and there's a lot!)

Great and easy to make dessert!  I had to use semi-sweet chocolate chips that did not contain any milk(by Ghiradelli) since we have milk allergies in the family, and I used Rice Chex cereal.  It was such a treat for the child with the allergy, since it is so hard to find chocolate desserts without milk in them!
Thanks for the recipe, Bonnie!

There are a lot of varations out there for this recipe, but this one is the best!  This gives you really coated, flavorful puppy chow. We think Jif creamy peanut butter works best too.  Enjoy!

Very good, but very rich.  A little too much so for my family.  I might make again, but use more cereal to "sauce" for a lighter coating.  (This is also great to make when camping!!)

Addictive.  I agree that the recipe calls for slightly too much powdered sugar, and slightly too much cereal, but those are easily managed as you bake.

This recipe is great and just how I remember as a child. I didn't need a lot, so I cut the recipe in half. I put the butter, chocolate and peanut butter in the microwave. One tip for measuring peanut butter is tp spray the measuring cup with Pam. This is a winning recipe.

This is the basic recipe but the proportions are a bit off.  I increased the PB to 1C and it is a good thing I did since the mixture was not enough to cover the cereal evenly (I can only imagine how much worse it would have been with a half cup less PB).  I used an 11.5oz box of cereal.  I used the full amount of butter but if I make it again I would decrease it by at least half as it was waaaaay too much and I had a hard time mixing all the butter into the chocolate and PB.

This recipe makes such a wonderful sweet snack!  The chocolate tasted great with the peanut butter.  I couldn't find a 17.5 oz. box, so I just used a 16 oz. generic box of corn Chex cereal.  It worked great!

Made this for a ladies retreat I was going on as a munchie during late night "chat" sessions. Boy, was it a hit! Nothing like seeing a bunch of women chomping down some chocolate goods and licking their fingers clean (nuns included! : ) VERY addictive, and the name is intriguing! Will make great Christmas gifts as a change of pace...

Great Recipe, but for all the people thinking it maybe a bit too much powdered sugar, I added instant hot chocolate mix to the powdered sugar (equal parts), mixed it together and used that as the coating.  YUMMY!!  I also thought caramel would be a good addition so I cooked at a boil 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar for three minutes and added it at the same time I added the cereal.  Mixed it all together and shook it in the bag with my sugar/instant hot chocolate mix and voila!!!  Enjoy!!

This is the recipe that I used.  The only thing I changed was that I used a 12 oz. box of cereal and chunky peanut butter.  SOOOO yummy!  Very chocolaty and full of flavor!

Please full view this I have a great story here!

I remember originally getting this recipe from my next door neighbor when I babysat for her.  I have also seen puppy chow done with icing and m and m's before.  I personally am not a big chocolate fan so I have done it with butterscotch chips instead!  I sold them for a girl scout bake sale one year and remember getting great feedback for the butterscotch too!  I know there are a bunch of different baking chips out there that I will also have to try.

You definitely have to wait for it to cool before covering in powdered sugar. My husband and I got in a hurry, and coated it while still warm, and it melt the powdered sugar, resulting in not white puppy chow. I used natural peanut butter, and I think it made the rice cereal too mushy. So I wouldn't recommend natural peanut butter. But it might have been that I bought cheap cereal. Will make again.

My favorite trick for coating the cereal with the powdered sugar is to put the chocolate/PB coated cereal in a clean brown paper bag then pour in 1/2 lb. of powdered sugar. Close the bag and shake until everything is evenly coated. Add more powdered sugar if necessary. I also add pretzel sticks, peanuts, cashews, and sometimes dried fruit in place of some of the cereal.

This was good but I think I overdid it on the powdered sugar b/c it had a funny aftertaste.  I do love sugar though so I'm sure I added more than I thought I did.  Also, a tip for those who have never made this kind of a thing...it is really messy, so be prepared...don't be like me and get powdered sugar everywhere b/c you're trying to mix it up in a bag that's way too small!

This has been a family favorite for years.  I do use half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chips and find that makes a much tastier mix.  Also, don't skimp on the powdered sugar or it will turn into a solid mass overnight. Thanks Bonnie for reminding me of a great simple recipe!

Excellent! I used the wheat version of the cereal instead, because that's what I had on hand. The end result tastes exactly like Peanut M&M's, even has the same crunch.  My four year old didn't like it, but my 10 year old couldn't get enough of it.

I will definitely make this again.

I am allergic to peanuts and my DH loves Puppy Chow.  Today, I made it with Crispix and cashew butter.   YUM! I will take the recommendation to use vanilla next time.  It was wonderful!

I've been making this for years, I actually start by putting the cereal right into the paper bag and add the chocolate mixture on top.  I also add nuts and raisins as well.  You have to shake it really well to get it all coated, then add the 10x sugar and shake it again, by the time you add the sugar, everything gets separated and it works great.  Easy peazy clean-up!  Great recipe to make with kids, no hot pans, no sharp utensils!

recipe was Ok. I used less cereal then recipe called for and that helped alot. It calls for way too much powdered sugar also, half the amount would have enough.

DELICIOUS and extremely EASY to make!  I used milk chocolate chips (just my personal preference), mixed it up in my biggest tupperware bowl, worked great. Taking it to work tomorrow for a treat day I'm betting not one bite comes home with me!! thank you for a great recipe!

Very messy to make but yummy.  I just wished there was a way to avoid the powdered sugar added sweetness.  I will make this again for another party.  Thank you for sharing.

I have made this a couple times before. It is good with peanut butter, but I think it is better with Nutella. The Nutella is very good with it if you like chocolate. So if you like chocolate, try the Nutella INSTEAD of the peanut butter.

Used a 12.6 oz box of Rice Chex and 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Cut everything else down to 3/4 of the original amount to balance with the Chex. It was delicious!

My final result was VERY tasty. I made a few changes after reading reviews. I used a 1 1/2 boxes of Rice Chex, added 1 tsp vanilla to the melted ingredients, and used only 12 oz powdered sugar.The result looked more like the "dog food" I was looking for.

I had a recipe for this years ago and was trying to find one like it, this sure was not it.  I did everything the same as the recipe but did use the slightly smaller box of cereal as suggested, because my store did not have the larger size.  It turned into one big clump of mess, not individual bite size pieces like my old recipe did.  To save it rather than throw it away i pressed it into a 9x9 cake pan and cut it into squares.

Wonderful! Whenever I serve it at parties I have to print a dozen of the recipe. My trick...pour the cereal into a large clean unscented tall kitchen trash bag. The mixing and shaking is much easier. Be sure not to get the chocolate too warm. I freeze mine so the chocolate that gets stuck to the sides on the bag fall away and adds to the cereal. A+ Bonnie! Keep 'em coming!

Very tasty and addictive (although messy to make - powdered sugar everywhere)!  One of my friends claims it tastes like a Butterfinger candy bar.

Boy did this recipe bring back memories. I thought it was a little dry- as all the cereal didn't get coated. I then realized that I only wrote down 1/2 cup of peanut butter. It definitely needs a full cup. The kids LOVED it. Great party snack!

A wonderful treat for the entire family, and a great treat bag to give out during the holidays!  I didn't have to use a whole lb of confect. sugar though, it was more like 1/2 to 3/4.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Just like I remember from my childhood! The only problem I encountered was one I created myself - I got a little impatient and used more powdered sugar than the recipie calls for. But it still tasted great. :)

Easy to make and just as easy to eat. A new family favorite. We didn't have a paper sack so we shook it in a 2 gal Ziploc bag. It turned out as pretty as a picture.

We have a friend that has made this for years.  My husband and oldest are going on a Boy Scout campout this weekend, and wanted to take a different snack. My husband suggested puppy chow, and looked up the recipes himself.  We chose this one, and it's great!  Of course, we can NEVER leave any recipe alone, so we added our own variation.  We used 1/2 semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips.  We added vanilla like other reviewers suggested, and it's awesome!  We hope it makes it till tomorrow night when they get to the campsite for cracker barrel!

This was easy to follow! I used the suggestions of not adding as much powdered sugar (used 3/4 of the 1 lb. bag) and it was just right. 
I also used crunchy pb (that's all I had) and it made the puppy chow seem like candy. The husband LOVED it!

I used a 14 oz. box of Corn Chex, but next time, I would decrease the amount of cereal to 12 oz. to ensure more coating for the individual pieces. I also always add vanilla extract to enhance the flavor. Overall, this is a great, easy dessert snack with a simple recipe. It's nice to have on hand during the holidays.

This recipe is amazing! I made it for the 4-H Dog Club for a cute snack, and everyone loved it. Make sure you melt everything slowly... (This was my first time melting peanut butter and I made the mistake of having the heat on too high, but I fixed it.)

Great recipe.  We added the powdered sugar a little at a time, so we didn't get too much.  Still trying to figure out a way to get the chocolate/peanut butter mix more evenly distributed...

Love this!  So fun to shake it in the paper bag.  You can easily make this gluten and dairy free by using earth balance spread and dairy free chocolate chips.  The rice chex are already gluten free!

I made this for a bake sale. Put about a cup worth in little cute baggies with ribbon. It was the first to run out.  I love this recipe. Best one I have used so far! You may not need all of the powdered sugar, but if not, no biggie. Better to be safe rather than have gray puppy chow ;) i just shake until its beautifully coated :)

I used crispex instead of chex. I used a 17oz box and I think it worked better than 2 12oz boxes.

Absolutely love this stuff! I use a combo of Crispix and Shreddies Cereal.  About 9 cups of cereal total.  Melt the chocolate, peanut butter and butter in the microwave until melted, check and stir every 30 seconds as chocolate can burn quickly.  2 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar was the perfect amount.

This recipe was excellent! My only complaint is that it would be nice to have a bit more peanut butter flavor, but I may have only noticed this because I had to add semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate. I also added vanilla like many others and used Soy-Free Earth Balance instead of butter. I didn't use all of the chocolate/butter mixture because I only had a 12 oz. bag of cereal, but eying the amount of both the mixture and powdered sugar worked out perfect for me.

Perfect, quick and easy.  I had doubts about the lb of powered sugar, but after weighing it out in segments (.25 lbs) and adding it gradually it turned out perfect with the entire lb.

This was excellent.  Made the recipe with a 14 oz box of Corn Chex and thought it was the perfect coating.  WARNING:  The powered sugar coating was messy and you need a big paper bag to do it easily and well.  I probably didn't use a whole pound of confectioners' sugar, I just played it by "sight".  Enjoy!

10 Stars! Fabulous!!! Easy! I added 1/2 cup more peanut butter. I made this for a daughter's  b-day party. It was a pet theme. I didn't have a large bag, so I placed the coated cereal on a cookie sheet and sprinkled on one cup of powdered sugar at a time. Then I mixed it with my hands. (A spoon was too hard.) Messy hands, but got the job done :)!

I made this recipe with the smaller size box of chex mix and it was perfect!  It tasted just as i imagined it!  Then i tried to make it again not having the recipe in front of me and i accidently used 1/2 cup of pb! needless to say it tasted like chocolate chip cookies more than anything!  Big mistake! Even my bf's mom who never eats sweets loved it and even took it to work! i felt so special!

Very delicious! Make sure you use a very large bag when coating with powered sugar. It was hard to get all pieces coated. I ended up splitting up the batch and coated 1/2 batch at a time. Much easier and less messy that way!

one word..... dangerous.  it was impossible to not eat too much of this stuff.  i think i successfully consumed half the batch all by myself over 2 days:).  i used semi sweet choco and my box of cereal was only 15oz.  the only thing i think i would try differently next time is to mix powdered sugar and some cocoa together so the coating wouldn't be quite so sweet.  i know that the powdered, sugary sweetness is the way it is suppose to be...... but i think i could probably eat more if it was toned down just a little:).

This was excellent.  Had a bad experience w/ making this before and think it was due to the recipe not calling for butter which ended up making it much easier to spread the mixture over the cereal.  Also, there wasn't an option of 17.5 oz size cereal so I used 13oz and kept the recipe as it's written and it was still perfect.  Thanks!

You gotta love Puppy chow...However I jut learned that if you use the biggest Ziplock bag at the bottom put part of the powered sugar and then add half cereal mix then layer it. It turns out more evened when your done shaking it.

My kids love this. It is so simple and I can send a little baggie in their lunch box to school or we can take it on a picnic at the park. I personally think it is very sweet but they love it! We happen to have the ingredients in the house.

This snack sure doesn't stick around very long!  I did cut back on some of the sugar.  I threw in some M&M's and it was a hit.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe that my family all enjoyed.  My husband who has recently returned from iraq said the guys over there would love it, but we wonder how long it is good for before we make it up and ship it out.  If anyone knows please let us know or post.

I thought this was awesome but I think I like my mother-in-laws better.  She uses some oil with the chocolate chips before she microwaves it.  Still an awesome recipe though!

Next time I will use the ceral aquares instead of the chex mix. When I made it it was so thick that the sugar didn't really stick to it. It is really sweet but this was the first time I made it so next time I will make less.

This is a fun snack for teens to make and eat.  We used a lot less confectioners sugar, however, probably only a cup. After one night in an airtight container, however, the puppy chow became sticky.  I'm not certain if it was the chips I used (ghirardelli) or the fact that I used less confectioners sugar.

This stuff is addicting!  I had made this quite regularly some years ago and kind of forgot about it until I ran across the recipe here.  Made it as a snack for a camping trip and was very well received, especially by the little ones.

This recipe is good, but for less fat content, I didn't add all the butter called for.  But I guess if you are counting fat grams and calories, puppy chow is probably not a good option anyway, but it sure is tasty.

For those of you who are 'nut crazy' such as I am, I add about a half a pound of whole pecans to this and reduce the cereal just a bit.

This is my go-to treat for my daughter's volleyball team. I started making it 10 years ago when she was a girl scout, then for her school volleyball team. Now I'm not allow to visit her at college without her team clamoring for it. Shaking in a large brown paper grocery sack is vital so the cereal doesn't get soft. Make sure the bag is completely closed when you shake (trust me on this). I have added whole peanuts and raisins to this also with good results.

I'd had this a couple of times at parties recently and wanted to make some for my family. I knew I could find the recipe on www.allrecipes.com! This was easy to make and the kids were pleased. I used semi-sweet chunks 'cause that's what I had, and just a couple of tablespoons of butter. Easy! Fun! Yummy! Makes tons!

This tasted great and just like I remembered as a kid.  Next time I will add a little more powdered sugar and shake the powdered sugar and cereal in a large bowl with a lid. I made a mess shaking it in a paper sack.

Puppy Chow is a Midwestern delicacy! There aren't many recipes online, and this one really hits home! The best part is that you can add as much chocolate/powdered sugar as you desire. This recipe is great because there isn't an exact amount to everything, you can adjust to how your tastes are.

I've made this several times now. Putting it in a large paper sack makes all of the difference! You can ask for them at the grocery store instead of plastic, and most will gladly give you a new one if you ask, at least here in the mid-west!

Very good. Followed ingredients list exactly except the powdered sugar. I scooped out 2 cups, stirred, then added more until I liked the look of it- maybe 2.5-3 cups total.

I never made or ate this before  but I needed a fast  sweet snack for a birthday party open house.   I made about a recipe and a half.   ! used half semi sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips  because that was on hand and I hoped it would help reduce the sweetness.   It tasted like I thought it would, still too sweet for me    I think it will be liked at the open house.

this (addicting stuff) never goes out of style.  Loved the fact that this made a big batch.  I ran out of creamy so had to add a bit of crunchy pb to make the 1 cup.  I also ran out of milk choc chips; had exactly 1 cup of them so I used 1 cup peanut butter chips.  This was so good.  Great for any time, and a great last minute snack or treat for a party.  synch to prepare.  Many possibilities with the variety of chips there are to switch it up a bit.  I had a large plastic  bag from bed,bath,& beyond that I used to shake it all up in.  worked perfect and didn't waste a perfectly good trash bag.

Great, took the recommendations of less b.sugar, used 1 box rice(12oz), and corn Chex, and threw in some M & M’s. My genius husband came up with the idea of shaking it the oven bags we bought for Thanksgiving! Worked out perfectly!

I only had crunchy peanut butter on hand, so that's what I used. Other than that, I followed instructions exactly and this was YUMMY! This disappeared quickly as my family just loved it! Thanks for the great recipe, Bonnie.

We all love it!  I took another cook's advice and used a trash bag to toss the cereal in. This helped keep it from breaking and it coated more evenly.

I thought it was quite easy to make.  I put chunky peanut butter into a large Dutch oven with the butter and "mint" choco chips.  Stirred it all together added the rice checks and folded them into the mixture.  The mint was very subtle and the chunky peanut butter add a little extra something.  Everyone loved it.

This is the classic recipe they made at my husband's school for a life skills classroom exercise.  I'm so glad to have found it again.  So yummy, and it's quick and easy to make.  Always turns out perfect.  I use semi-sweet chips because that's what I had on hand.  Delicious!

I made this as Christmas gifts to give out to my coworkers. I got rave reviews (and I've been munching on the leftovers... warning: you do not want this around if you're on a diet). I took a star away because I made extra sauce based on some of the reviews I read, and it was perfect. I used twice as much Chex and tripled the sauce. (So basically I increased the sauce by 50%.) I didn't believe it would use so much powdered sugar, but it did. Don't go into this thinking half a bag will be enough! I also recommend using a wider bowl- such as a salad bowl- instead of a regular mixing bowl with tall sides. The taller sides mean you have to dig deep to stir it, which will crush the Chex. Overall, great recipe!

Love Puppy Chow! This is a good recipe. I usually use Crispix instead of Chex because the middle of the cereal shell holds more of the good stuff (pb n choco mix). The butter loosens the pb n chocolate so it is easier to melt and distributes better throughout the cereal. Good stuff!

Kids love it - and so did Dad.  Get a brown paper grocery bag next time you go to the store and save it for when you make this.  It's by far the best way to shake up the puppy chow.

My family and I love Puppy Chow. I learned how to make it years ago from a friend and needed a refresher on the recipe. Definitely worth it! My family attacks this immediately and carries it to school to share with friends, who start making requests for it around Halloween. A Holiday staple in our house, it just wouldn't be the season without it!

These are sooooooo good.  I did not grow up with them.  My first taste was in college when my roommate's mom sent her a bag over the holidays.  Now that I am all grown up with my own children I decided to make it a tradition in our house.

Great recipe!  I use Golden Grahams cereal for a little sweeter taste.  Also, dump your cereal mix in a large paper bag and shake the powdered suger over it.  This mixes well and also absorbs some of the extra grease from the peanut butter.

Really good and kid friendly too! My 6 and 3 year old helped make this treat and had a ball. I could only find a 15.6 ounce box of the cereal. It still worked out well. Well make this often. Thanks!

Just what I was looking for.  Perfect for my husband's sack lunches and it made a lot!  I agree it is great from the freezer.

I loved the recipe and the great idea of coating the cereal by shaking it in a brown bag. The cereal coated excellent with this method and easy clean up. I bought Rice Chex in error but the recipe still worked great.

So easy to do and a great snack.  I made it during a holiday season and put it in decorative bags.  It was such a hit.
