I absolutely loved it and so did everyone else (10 people to be exact!) Okay so I fixed it up a little.  I did not use the lemon juice instead I put in more vanilla extract, I used 4 eggs instead of 7 and cinnamon grahams instead of plain.  Served with fresh strawberries on top.  This recipe was the best. I was totally in! I have never tasted such a great cheesecake in my life!  It is fluffy and light and tastes unbelievable.  Need I say more.  Don't look any farther this is the recipe for you. p.s. you should divide the recipe into 2 cakes as it is too large for one pan.

I decided to try something new from the usual recipe I use. I found this recipe and gave it a try and have to say that it is the BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!! I took other users advice and used a 10 inch pan and it was perfect for the amount. I also cooked it at 325 for about 1 hour and 15 min. It will still be wobbly when you take it out but it firms up with sitting and refridgeration. It came out perfect with no cracks and a really creamy texture. All my ingredients were room temp including the heavy cream and eggs which I think is really important. This is the recipe I will use from now on. It's the best!!

I'm giving this recipe four stars, because it's good. The directions were off a lot. First, there is way, way, way too much for a 9 inch pan.  I used a 11 inch pan, and it filled it perfectly.  The baking time was much too low, and it took a good 4 hours until the middle stopped wobbling, and it was the right temperature inside. I used a waterbath, but that shouldnt affect cooking time THAT much since I had the water hot before I put it into the bath.  

Overall, it had a good flavor. I added some lemon zest as I wanted it to have a strong lemon flavor, and blended the ingredients together until they were smooth.  The cheesecake turned out very nicely after I cooled overnight. Invented a topping for this that came out very nicely. 1 cup sour cream, 4 ounces cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup of sugar, blended together until smooth. Added to cheesecake after it was completely cooled off, and then let sit in fridge for another 8 hours. Was a great compliment to the cheesecake.

This was, by far the BEST CHEESECAKE I have ever had, nevermind that I have made. Even with the heavy-sounding ingredients, it was so light and fluffy. I used a 10 inch springform and it was coming over the top, (puffed up, didnt spill out) so I think a 9 inch would be way too small. I took it to a clients house for dinner and she had SECONDS. I put braised apricots on top (Cut them  in 1/2 and put unsalted butter and brown sugar on top -under the broiler for 5 minutes) and I was the hit of the night!! This will be the recipe I will use FOREVER! I think New Yokr style is a bad adjective though, NY style is much drier, this is quite moist.

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever eaten.  It takes a little bit of work, but it is worth it.  I ended up with enough mix to make 2 pies, which was great because we got to keep one for ourselves!  How greedy!

Made this at Christmas and it was so hectic I didn't get around to reviewing it until now! Terrific cheesecake recipe! My first "real" cheesecake and it came out delicious! I followed directions and it still cracked though. Some people said to try the "pan of water on the oven shelf just under the cheesecake" technique. Doesn't work. Next time I will try the actual "water bath" technique. Wasn't sure then how to do that- everyone assumes you know. For those who don't: Make your cheesecake in a springform pan. Wrap the outside of it in foil(to keep the water out). Get a larger cake pan or shallow casserole dish  (don't grease it). Put your wrapped springform pan into it. Carefully pour very warm water into the space between the two pans (a little over halfway). The idea is to have the middle and the outside of the cheesecake the same temp. If the outside is hotter, it will bake faster and shrink. This causes the cracks. I'll let you know if this works in practice as well as it's supposed to!

I made this cheesecake this past weekend and it really turned out great. I used
the water bath when I baked it. It was smooth and really good tasting, got a lot of comments on it.
I would make it again.

This is by FAR one of the best cheescase recipes I've found.  And she's not kidding about the longer you leave in the fridge.  Overnight is best.  YUMMY!!!!!  From all who've had it.  EXCELLENT cheesecake.

I've been making New York style cheesecake for 20 years and this is by far one of the best recipes I've used.  Nice and creamy. Baked as directed then left in the oven with the door closed and oven off for one hour. Did not crack on the top like many cheesecakes do. Made the day before so flavors could meld in fridge. Definitely a do again recipe!

Nice flavor. Way too much batter. I think I could have probably made 2 cheesecakes from the amount. I made 1 overflowing cheesecake and 18 minicheesecakes. The top totally cracked around all of the edges because I put too much batter in the pan.

Cheesecake is great. I read reviews before making and saw where a lot of people who rated this recipe, said there was to much batter, so I changed the servings (listed under 'ingredients'".  I changed sevings to 12 and it fit into the 9" pan very good. Will make it again for Christmas.  Thank you.

This is a very creamy cheesecake, less cheasy and more creamy. Very delicious and smooth. I covered it in chocolate and substitued brwn sugar for the white sugar in the crust.

I did not have a pan big enough to do a water bath, so I braved it without one.  Alas, my cheesecake cracked, but when the pieces were cut, who could tell?  It was delicious, and I received many compliments on it!

I made this cheesecake for our family get-together. One certainly was not enough.  It was The Best in Show!!!  My daughter-in-law had never had a "real" baked cheesecake and now I'm sure will never return to a box cheesecake.  Everyone raved about how it just melted on the tongue.  It's a recipe we will keep in our family generation after generation.  So incredibly easy to make also!  This recipe actually should receive a 10 Star rating...

this recipe turned out well. the cake was more smooth than fluffy, like satin.  not quite as sweet as I expected.  but very rich and creamy.  My family liked it very much even without the topping(which came from a can).  the recipe is easy to follow and easy to assemble. use the 10 inch or 11 inch pan if you have one, or else you will have to much for the 9 inch. I did not use the water bath method and mine came out fine.  I will make this again.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made. It turns out perfect every time. I followed the recipe exactly but did use a water bath. It does seem to be a slite bit wobbly in the middle, but firms up in the refrigerator. It may take a little time but is worth every minute.

The taste of this cake is incredible.  But the baking directions are way off.  I read many reviews and attempted to assimilate all into my plan; sad, fallen cracked cake.

This is the best recipe for cheesecake that I have ever made.  Everything about it was perfect and my family and guests all raved about it.  I did put a pan of hot water in the oven while baking it but otherwise I didn't change a thing. Thanks Michele for the fabulous recipe.

This is an AWESOME recipe. This was my first time ever making a cheesecake and it did get a little brown on the top. Will have to work on that next time. The filling was way too much for the springform pan. I used a 9 inch pan but couldn't use all of the filling. It tasted really good and I added some fresh strawberries and strawberry syrup to to the top before I served it and it was a hit.

I followed this recipe exactly, except using a 10 inch pan instead of a 9 inch pan. The texture was great, and would have been perfect if I had baked it less time. Mine got a little dark on top and drier because of that. I wonder if this was due to all my ingredients being absolute room temperature and not the least bit cold. (?) If I make this again, I'll shorten the cook time by 10-15 minutes. The taste was good, but I like my cheesecakes with just a little more citrus flavor. This recipe was easy to follow and certainly better than most I've tried.

Sinful, creamy, and delicious.  Too many ingredients for just a 9 inch springform though.  That was really the only problem I ran into.  Other than that everything was fine; even the cooking time.  Thanks for sharing this, Michele.

My friends and family loved this cheesecake, I topped it with a chocolate fudge, and it was so good, and I loved that I didn't have to use a water bath and it still turned out perfect.

I made this for the first time for my family.  They loved it!! I had to make a second one for a family member to take back home with them!!  I followed the directions exactly and it was awesome.  You are going to want to eat some right away, let it sit in the fridge for at least a  day or two,it gets even better.  definitely a keeper!!

This was by far, the best cheesecake that I have ever made. I will make this one over and over again. It is so light and fluffy, absolutely perfect.

I've made this several times and it always is a huge hit. It can stand alone without any toppings and still get wows from guests. I always bake it in a water bath to avoid the dreaded crack. It's so smooth and creamy good, you'll savor every bite!

First off,  way too much batter and even the time for baking it was off and I also found this too have way too many eggs which is why many needed to use water bathe in the oven along with it and too much sugar. I added all the ingredients but with these changes: 2 (9 inch) pie moldes, 4 eggs not 7, 1/2 cup sugar not 1-1/2whole cup, and baked it ONLY for 65 minutes and turned out PERFECTLY! Wasn't wiggly, or undone. Baked perfectly without the need to use a water bathe since the egg amount was lesser. If you use all 7 then you probably would need a water bathe to cook it in the middle. By fixing it up a bit, and following my gutt, mine's turned out great cooked completely and evenly which it didn't even crack!!! Loved it!

This cheesecake has so much flavor and it's the best recipe I've made. I've tried a lot of cheesecake recipes throughout the years yet this is my all time favorite.  I do use a waterbath to prevent cracking and I use a little less graham crackers for the crust but I use the ingredients suggested for the cheesecake.

I have used this recipe more times than  I can count and every time I get rave reviews!  The consistancy and taste are excellent!  For some reason there is always too much for my springform pan, but we don't mind, we put the extra in a mini springform and I get my own little sample! My friends and family are always requestig "my" cheesecake! Thank you!

Taste is great, but cracked big time!  I left in oven the stated times and conditions.  But the cracks are ginormous!  Have made cheesecake before and not had this happen.  Was disappointed.  For family it is okay, but to serve to others I'd be afraid to use this many ingredients again, just to see.

Since it was Christmas and we were expecting a variety of guests coming I didn't want to top the cake. Instead, I made a boysenberry topping by adding a little water to jam. I also had strawberry and chocolate available, let your imagination run wild!

The recipe was easy to follow and turned out great. I would cook it for less than the recommended time and check often. Don’t be fooled by the “wiggle “. It will firm up in the fridge.

My first attempt at cheesecake and it was delicious! My husband and kids loved it. I will be making it again with a few changes. After reading some of the reviews I split this batter into 1-8" and 1-9" round. This made two pretty good depth cheesecakes. Never having made cheesecake before and after doing some research, I've found that the reasons my cheesecake rose up and over the pan about 1/2" and was browned on top was over mixing and over baking. I going to try this recipe again on 325 for about 55 minutes I think and see how it turns out. Even over cooked and with cracks all through it, it was delicious!

This was the first cheesecake I ever made. After reading all the reviews, I decided to make changes to the recipe. I only used 6 eggs and I used lime instead of lemon juice. I had enough batter for a good size 10" cake and a mini cake. The cake really browned; so in the future I will cut back on the cooking time. My cake did crack but that was okay. I made a strawberry topping for it. The taste was great. I will make it again.

First time ever making a cheesecake.  Didn't use the warm bath on the first go round, so it looked awful but tasted wonderful...soooo I saved that one, went back to the store and made another.  Came out perfect with the bath water!  I'm super excited!

Sooo good!  I followed the directions exactly and the batter filled a 9" pie pan and a casserole dish (didn't have anything else on hand, lol).  It ended up cracking but still tastes amazing!  i was worried it'd be too fluffy with all the egg, but it firms up nicely after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Next time I might try waterbath and a springform (I used pyrex and stoneware).  I think I might cut out the sugar from the crust too next time because it's a little too sweet for me.

I made this cake last night and I have to say it was the easiest cheesecake I've ever made and right at the top of the list for the most delicious. I used a 9 inch spring form pan and I thought it was going to overflow once it started baking but instead it acted like a souffle then settled down after it was refrigerated. I highly recommend it!

I have made this recipe twice now.  I absolutely love it and so does the family.  I do not add the lemon juice and I bake it in a 10 inch or even 11 inch pan.  Followed the baking instructions and baked without a water bath.  The cheesecake turned out beautifully!  I also make a little extra crust because I like a thicker crust.  Thank you for this recipe.

Very good!  Mine did crack but I covered it with a strawberry topping anyway so it didn't matter.

I have been making this for five years and this will make hero out of anyone with a mixer. The only reason I Googled this was to reprint it, my copy has too many miles on it.

This made way too much for my 9" pan. The cheesecake ended up all over the bottom of my oven when it raised 3" over the top of the pan. The outside was burned and the middle was undercooked. It seems like the combination of ingredients is fine but the amounts are excessive (even the crust was way too much) and the baking portion of the recipe is not right. I am willing to retry with adjustment suggestions by other reviewers though.

Hello Ladies! 
I am a 23 yr old almost graduate that loves to cook but clearly has  a lot to learn when it comes to the kitchen. I absolutely love to cook and decided I would try out making a cheesecake. I used this recipe because of all of the great comments about how well it turned out (thank you everyone). I modified the recipe quite a bit. I made the crust, then added a layer of honey peanut butter before pouring the cheesecake in. I added 4 frozen bananas (thawed in the microwave) and cinnamon to the cheesecake batter. I did not use any lemon juice. I cooked it at 360 for 75 minutes with a water bath, then followed the rest of the directions with letting it sit for 30 minutes with the oven closed then open for 30 minutes. It is currently in the fridge and looks absolutely fantastic. Tomorrow morning I am going to smother it in melted Nutella then let it sit the rest of the day in the fridge before the party tomorrow. I was not completely sure what exactly a water bath was, so I just put a pan of water underneath in hopes that it would work and I think it did! I have no cracks in the cheesecake. I will let everyone know how it turned out! I have high hopes for it! Thank you for the recipe.

I used half the cream called for, a little more lemon juice, and all the eggs.  Consistency is not as dense as I would like.  It did all fit in my 9 inch pan but expanded past the top while baking, which created some weird cracking around the edges.  Flavor is very good.  Cook time was indeed too long, my crust is a little burnt, top is very brown. I would make this again.

This cheesecake is awesome. I add butter to the crust instead of margarine. Gives it a richer taste.
