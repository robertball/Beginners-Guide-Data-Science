My husband said it was the best gumbo he ever tasted in his life. I made it last Sunday and it took from 10:30am to 1 pm to have everything in the pot. I rated it 4 stars because I changed the spices so much to add more flavor. Here are comments and changes:
1. Used 5 skin on chicken thighs vs duck legs and took skin off after browning
2. Used 1.75 lbs andouille sausage because I did not use cray fish
3. Cooked roux in oblong cast iron pan so only took 20 min
4. I did not add 2 more TB of flour because we wanted soup bowls not plates
5. I used a lot more stock 2.5 32 oz boxes( for Roux I used his amount of stock and added extra in soup pot)
6. I used Chef John's thyme and cayenne but added a large sprinkle of garlic powder and 2T of Emerl's Bayou blast and file powder in the end
7. I strained off a lot more fat and used 2T in the rice instead of butter
8. Chopped green onion and parsley sprinkled on rice
9. Loved John's tips of using some fat from meat for roux and using pickled okra
10. Only make this when you have a day off and for friend's and family who appreciate gumbo

I made this last Sunday and making Chef John's American onion soup this Sunday

Made this recipe as stated except substituted langostinos for the crawfish meat. Loved the broth! Did not realize cooking the roux longer would bring out such a rich taste. Definitely an all day dish. Poor hubby only gets it once a year for his birthday!

This was fun to make and it took all day, which I love for my days off. The base flavor was outstanding but I did end up adding a lot of garlic powder, cayenne, white pepper, and onion powder to liven it up, not to mention some liberal dashes of tabasco, which I never use but HEY, its Cajun!

This was amazing! Because of living far away from Louisiana I had to make some substitutions. No ham hocks so I subbed a diced ham steak, no crawdads so  I subbed one of those small lobster tails. I had two ducks legs left over from Xmas dinner so I used those, and the rendered fat I had saved. I doubled the thyme, cayenne, added garlic, and put in a teas of Tony Chachere Creole seasoning. (We like spicy!) I also doubled the okra because we love it! Since I started this after work, it wasn't done until really late. Reheated for dinner the next night and it tasted even better! This was absolutely perfect and well worth the trouble! Thank You for a wonderful recipe!

I used duck and goose legs and wings from my last hunt as well as some elk sausage from the butcher, otherwise I was as true to the recipe as I could be. Absolutely amazing!

Another terrific meal from Chef John!  One thing, donâ€™t use a smoked ham hock as I did.  It made it too salty.  I was able to counter this by adding cut up potatoes - they absorb salt.  I need to make this again, and a lot of it - because my neighbors who got a taste are clamoring for more.  Look out ducks!  Here I come, so DUCK!

I didn't have a Ham hock so I browned bacon to get the fat for my  roux.  Also when I added the seafood I also added a little gumbo file

I left out the  shrimp as, to us,  they're lost in the flavors.  Change I made was I used a real smoked andouille (not a Polish sausage masquerading as andouille  - beware) and duck and cooked the andouille and vegetables in the roux.  We also used a heavy chicken stock instead of  water...we also used more garlic but that's us.

I'm betting that you can use other smoked pig parts or even smoked turkey necks instead of the hock if you can't find hocks.

If you want a less greasy gumbo I've toasted flour in my oven until it's the right nutty shade for the taste I want.  You have to adjust your cooking method or you may end up with gumbo and dumplings but for folks who don't want that extra oil, it works.  If the result's not thick enough for the diner's taste you can put a salt shaker of file on the table.
