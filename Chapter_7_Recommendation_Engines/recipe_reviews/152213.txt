I decided to kick these up just a notch by adding celery, onions and garlic to the saute.  Fantastic!!!  Had to ding it a star because it wouldn't have been as good without the additions.  And DO NOT skip toasted almonds!  Great mix of flavors and textures in this dish, try my suggested additions!  Forget the title, I'd eat these everyday!

Loved these green beans.  Easy to make.  I did roast the sliced almonds, as recommended by other reviewers.  The second time i made these:  even better!  Added fresh minced garlic to the saut√© as a personal preference.  Used regular mushrooms, as they were what I had.  Delicious.  Loved the flavors and the crunch.  Thank you.

Nice Vegetarian easy cooking.  For a dorm with only a microwave, steam the green beans in 2 minute intervals in a bag with the muchrooms etc. then add the butter and pepper stuff.

I steamed the beans for a couple of minutes before adding to the pan, but I shouldn't have. 
It was still great, but the beans were overcooked.
I added the onion as recommended and probably more mushrooms.  It was EXCELLENT!

I toasted the slivered almonds in a pan over very low heat.  They were excellent too.

A pretty basic green bean recipe but very good and easy.  Make sure you toast the almonds.  Bacon and some caramelized onions would be great in this also.

This dish was devoured at my work potluck.  Simple, but everyone loves it.  My only confusion is that there are no onions in the recipe, but there seems to be a lot in the picture of this dish.

Really good recipe. I doubled it for a family event; added 1 caramelized onion, should have used 2. Also added 2-3 cloves of minced garlic while cooking.  Added toasted almonds and diced, fried bacon as suggested by other reviewers. After I tasted it, I added grated Parmesan cheese over the top. That completed the tasty experience!

I'm a neophyte at cooking. This recipe was easy to follow and wonderful to eat. I added carrots to the mix and was not disappointed. thank you!
