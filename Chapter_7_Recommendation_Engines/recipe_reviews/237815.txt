This was yummy and pretty - perfect for a Sunday brunch with friends or family. One change that's needed is to increase the amount of milk/cream in the recipe (I recommend 1 cup). It was a bit too "eggy" and not quite the creamy quiche texture I prefer. The overall taste was a big hit!!

this was nice, light, and tasty.. i scaled this down to 1.5 servings (my math) since i was only making breakfast for myself.. i made more of a frittata out of the ingredients.. altering this to be low carb friendly i left out pie crust, flour, and tomato.. subbed garlic powder and frozen spinach that i thawed out (equal amounts to the artichoke) for the fresh.. i mixed everything together (except for the cheese), pan fried it in the same pan i cooked the bacon, and topped it with the cheese.. this could use a bit of S&P but that's easily remedied.. ty for the recipe.. this was much more fun than a standard bacon and eggs breakfast

I made it, and my friends and family loved it!  It was so good that I am preparing it again in larger quantities to serve to my co-workers as part of a Christmas Brunch before we leave to the holidays.
