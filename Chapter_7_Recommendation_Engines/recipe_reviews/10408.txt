These are very good - cruchy and a bit chewy too.  Next time I make them I think I'll double the maple extract just to make them a bit more mapley.

Tasty but they're hard to tell when they're done.  They're delicious warm and chewy out of the oven but if you bake them a little longer thinking they're not done like I did, they get too hard after cooling.  Still tasty but may need a cup of coffee to dunk them in.  Used pecans instead of walnuts-really nice.

Like Shortbread, only I didn't know if adding more butter would ruin them. In the end I only could use 80% of them because the rest stayed a powder. They got rock hard after an hour and were inedible. Too bad because the smell was great.

It didn't make a dough. Could not slice. It crumbled.
