I've made this recipe before, and it was fantastic. My mother in law made a variation of this same recipe. It was DELICIOUS! She added bacon (because my husband insists on meat at every meal), and it was a great touch. She also added sour cream, about a small container's worth.Excellent recipe. Thank you.

I've made this several times both at home and at my mothers&grandmothers house. gram hated it mom said it was ok but needed more potatoes(both very picky eaters) My children beg for more and want it all the time.Hubby and my self can't get enough ,the kids eat it all before we get a second bowl. Definitely a keeper.

My family of eight loves this tasty and economical soup, and we make it regularly. We sometimes add bacon bits to our individual bowls for extra flavor. (Note-- It's nearly impossible to make something that everyone in this family loves.) Thanks for the recipe!

I love this soup. I make it all the time. I have used ham from the holidays instead of baccon and it tuned out quite lovely. I also like to add carrots and leeks if I happen to plan ahead. I too blend only half of this soup, and I like to add just a dollip of sour cream when I'm blening.

this was a good soup, but i changed the recipe. i dident have green onions so i used half of a large yellow onion, then i didnt fry the onions in the pan with butter, i just cooked them in with the potaotoes, i cut back on the milk and i left a small portion of just bearley mashed poatotes, instead of blending them all, to make the soup have more texture. it was defaneetley watery, not as thick as i would like it thhough. but it would make an awesome base for differant homemade soups! :) also goes good with finger sandwitches!

This soup is so easy to make and it's delicious!  I made it for our "Cultural Diversity" potluck at work and this was the only dish that didn't have to be packed up for leftovers.

I agree with the poster who said only blend half. Works better when you have chunks of potato in the soup.

Wow - this was even better than I expected, although I did double the potatoes called for, to make sure it was thick enough for my liking.  I added more pepper too, but left everything else the same and LOVED IT.  Making more again (one week later) right now.  Suggest leaving some of the green parts of scallions aside to add at the very end.

My family and I absolutely love this soup! I always double the recipe, because it goes so fast. The only thing I do differently is that I only blend half of the soup, and leave the other half chunky. Its so good!

Outstanding! As others suggested, I only used half the potatoes in the blender. In fact, I added an extra potato so there would be more chunks. I cubed them more than sliced them. I, too, added bacon chunks. I used the bacon grease instead of butter to cook the veggies. Overall, about half or a little more  of the solid items went into the blender. It seemed a bit thin at first, but it thickened up nicely during the final cook. Be careful not to overcook the potatoes in the first cook, they should somewhat more firm than you would think because the chunks will continue to cook when re-heating with the blended liquid. The whole household loved it!

This was very easy to make and does not require a roux.  It does turn out thinner than a cream soup but it was delicious. I added extra celery and carrots. I will definitely make this again.

My family loves this dish.  It's on the menu every other week now.  We've made it by cooking bacon in the cast iron pot,then taking it out while cooking the rest.  We keep some of the fat and mix it with a little of the butter called for.  After the soup is blended, I re-add the bacon.  Hot sauce and shredded cheese are offered on the side.
