I adjusted this martini to use pumpkin spice liquor and skipped the step with the honey/graham crackers. (Didn't sound good to me at all.) I did dip the martini and glass in honey, only I dipped the honey coated glass in a mixture of pumpkin pie spice and sugar.
This is something you really need to shake up good with a lot of ice in your shaker. It's most definitely better ice cold.

Fabulous! I loved it! I am a martini lover. This goes well with the autumn. The honey & graham cracker are perfect for the rim.

I used skim milk to make this drink since the recipe doesn't specify. I think whole milk would make it better and make the drink creamier. I don't think of a martini being a sweet drink, but pumpkin pie certainly is. The drink itself isn't sweet, but the honey and graham crackers add that sweetness. I wasn't crazy about the first sip, but found that I liked this well enough as long as I had a little of the honey and graham cracker with each sip. I finished it quickly - maybe too quickly. ;)

This was only ok. The use of pumpkin pie spice just made the drink chalky.  I think maybe if the pie spice was mixed into the pumpkin puree that would work better. I am going to experiment with this and keep you posted!!

Made this and promptly poured it out. Way too much milk and not enough "pie" flavor. Had an excellent pumpkin pie martini at Tahoe Joe's in Roseville, CA recently and was trying to replicate it. This is not the replica.

I didn't like the graham cracker crumbs around the rim.  It interfered with the taste of the Martini drink.

I thought this was pretty tasty. I used pumpkin spice milk and toasted marshmallow vodka because I didn't have vanilla vodka on hand. I also didn't have any honey so I used agave nectar and graham cracker crumbs for the rim. I will be serving this to friends over the holidays!
