My family loved this recipe. The only changes I made was I used a dry zesty italian dressing and rubbed it on whole chicken breast and let it cook on low for 6 hours in the crock pot. The dry dressing increases the flavor!

This was just OK. We were not crazy about it. I think the dressing in it is a little weird. Good concept. I may try again an tweak the recipe.

It was tasty, and awesome for an "oops, I forgot to plan something ahead of time & need something easy" evening. I didn't get it started until around 4:45 and we were eating by 7.  My only criticism is that there's not a lot of flavor or zing. Next time around, we'll add a little onion, maybe some garlic & roasted red peppers to zip it up a bit.

This isn't a bad recipe  but it needs help. I added a lot of garlic, chives and used cream cheese with chives and added black pepper to it. It reminds me of a beef stroganoff with spaghetti and chicken. It was alright. It definitely needs some doctoring up.

I tried this and LOVED the chicken. It came out perfect in the slow cooker. The only change that I would change is the noodles. This would have been much better over a different type of noodle (maybe egg noodles) or even over rice. It is even good with just the chicken. I will be making this meal again.

I substituted lemon juice instead of white wine because I didn't have it plus I'm trying not to use any alcohol since I'm pregnant. I added salt, pepper, garlic, and some seasoning for chicken like some recommended in their comments. I also used 8 oz of Philadelphia cream cheese instead of the 4 and zesty Italian dressing instead of the kind they list (I actually didn't see that it had a specified kind until I was making it). I topped it with parmesan cheese and a side of a buttered baguette since all my kids love it. It was a hit! My 4 year old is very picky and he scarfed it down! Will definitely make this again!

I also added five cloves of chopped garlic, a chopped white onion, spinach leaves and skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Pour olive oil on sides and bottom of the crockpot bowl to prevent burning and sticking.  Romano or parmesan cheese can be added on top after serving.

I really wanted this to turn out better than it did.  It was not a hit.  However, an expert chef could probably do wonders with this.  I'm not sure the angel hair pasta is what should be used.  I'm thinking more of a thicker pasta.  My husband is very finicky and honest.  He ate it but did not care for it.  My daughter came back and ate leftovers and said it tasted better then than when it was made fresh.  My 16 yr old son liked it OK but got bored with the leftovers.  I personally liked it to the point I would have eaten much more but trying to maintain my weight.  Obviously, if something is good to me, it's not on my diet!  My dog loves it!!!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! And so does my boyfriend and his brother. I love making this for nights when I have to work late. The house smells divine when I come home. I used 4-5 chicken breasts instead of dark meat, and let cook for about 8-9 hours on low. Before I leave for work, I sautee chopped garlic and sliced onions, and then add the cream cheese (with chives), cream of mushroom soup, dressing mix, and 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I dump that over the chicken and add one sliced red bell pepper and a whole container of sliced portabellas. I serve over white rice instead of pasta but that's just because I love rice. ENJOY!! :)

I'm sure it' s really good, but I wasn't able to taste the delicious-smelling concoction: the chicken didn't cook properly. It was really pink inside. I'm going to try this again, but this time, i'm going to pre-cook the chicken!

It was ok, we ate it, but wouldn't make it again.  The kids ate it and didn't really complain but definitely didn't love it and the no one fought over the left overs.

Oh wow! So delicious! The only thing I changed after reading some reviews, I used dry Italian dressing and combined that with the bite size chicken breasts. Such a great flavor and so easy!

I followed the recipe, except I used chicken breast cubes instead of thighs. I added fresh sliced mushrooms before adding the sauce. Served it over Italian trio pasta, shells, penne & curls. It was like stroganoff with chicken, very tasty.

Again,  I have been making this for many years....a real favorite at this house !!
I have made a couple changes over the years;  I use (1) pkg. of dry Italian dressing mix,  (instead of Italian seasoning), and, I use a whole pkg. of Borsin with garlic cheese, (for the cream cheese).  Good both ways, but,  this grandma needs easy !!

I had marinated some thin chicken breasts in Italian dressing to BBQ them and then the weather prevented us from doing so.  I used the marinated breasts (along with the remaining dressing they were marinating in) in this recipe as is, but I added some plain Greek yogurt because I didn't have enough cream cheese on hand.  It came out great!  LOTS of flavor - it was a more unique chicken slow cooker dish than most and the family enjoyed it!
