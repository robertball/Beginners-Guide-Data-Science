My daughter is on a pasta\olive oil kick, so having that in mind, I decided to give this a try.  Well needless to say, she was a very happy girl.  I used broccoli as well as the asparagus (thinking she wouldn't care for asparagus) and grated carrots for the yellow pepper (but that was only to please her, I would have loved em') and all three of the kids liked this (well my 11 year old picked out the tomatoes)!  Thanks TOH!

Tastes great, quick and easy to prepare!  Next time I'll add the seasonings before the pasta because the cayenne pepper got caught in the spirals of some of the pasta.

This is a very good, flavorful recipe.  It takes a while to cut up all the veggies, but it's worth it!  I used prosciutto instead of ham & added extra parmesan, which really gave it a good flavor.  Also good as a cold pasta salad!

This is a great light meal and is easy to prepare (good for large groups)!  I used spinach since aspargus was out of season and it was great!  I can't wait to try it with asparagus.

THIS IS FANTASTIC! Easy and yummy, taste like something I order at Applebees. I used leftover ham from Easter dinner and it was so quick to make. I added onion and fresh garlic to the saute. Hubby went for seconds, and the kids ate it all up.

A delicious easy recipe that is indeed a meal in itself.  This dish lends itself nicely to experimentation.  I added some onion, and jalepeno pepper to the bell pepper and asparagus before sauteing.  I left out the ceyenne pepper and used orange and yellow tomatoes for more color.

I cooked this for my children and I. I accidentally put in too much cayenne pepper for their taste. A bit too spicey warm~ However, the next day we ate this cold~Wow! It was so delicious my kids ate right out of the fridge everyday when they got home from school. I will make this as a cold Pasta Salad from now on!

I couldn't find asparagus at the store so I used broccoli. I thought this was REALLY good.  Everyone else thought it was good but had a lot of vegatables.

I tried to cheat and use canned asparagus (out of season) and it was mushy.  Otherwise, good flavor and textures so I'll try again with fresh asparagus.

Great dish! The spices are perfect, flavorful but not overpowering.  I used frozen asparagus and penne pasta and it was easy and pretty and delicious.  You don't really even need the Parmesan, though it's good.  We LOVED this and will have it again soon.

I made this tonight for me and dear hubby. I have to say I was pleasently surprised how goooood it was. It was a light recipe, but very tasty.  THe only change I made was using 2 tbs of EVOO instead of one. The veggies and spices blended well. Husband loved it.

This dish was excellent!  I was afraid my husband wouldn't like it since he's not a big vegetable guy.  He also usually turns up his nose at anything "low-fat".  Not only did he like it, he said it is was one of his favorites!  I will make this one again and again.

My children 10, 12 did not like it at all.  Maybe just the needles, ham, asparagus and seasoning.  The bell peppers and parsley were awful.

I had to give this two stars because my husband and son would not eat it - mainly because it was too spicy with the cayenne pepper.  I ate it, but it was OK - nothing spectacular.  I would not make it again.
