Finally, a recipe for Hungarian goulash that IS Hungarian goulash. I see so many recipes that as good as they may be are NOT really goulash, This IS. 
Very easily adapted to your liking by adding more or less of something. But if you follow this exactly you will have authentic Hungarian Goulash

This is a similar recipe to a favorite dish that my sister in law makes.  I was recently given this recipe along with a pressure cooker.  The main difference was that we use stew beef and instead of 10 hours in a crock pot (I love them too!) we used  a pressure cooker at 15lbs for 30 minutes.  The beef was really really tender and soooo good.   


There is a rule though, since i inherited this recipe.  You have to drink a big ole' ugly glassfull of wine before you start.  then you have to have another while you cook and spill a little in the mix.

I love this over egg noodles.

Note: to avoid the flour lumps that one reviewer was complaining about, you have to mix water and flour and then pour that into the goulash.

I used ground beef instead of what the recipe calls for (its what I had on hand) and added the egg noodles into the crock pot when it had about 30 minutes left and added about another 1/2 cup of water.  It was fantastic!  There were NO leftovers!

This was very good, but I felt it needed some more flavor. I added fresh minced garlic, red pepper flakes, ground black pepper and fresh mushrooms. And, next time I will use half the salt and will brown the meat prior to putting in the slow cooker. Will make again and again with the additions. Thank You Rhonda!

My fiance's family is from Hungry.  He told me that as a child, his great aunt (now deceased) used to make authentic Hungarian goulash for the family.  The recipe was kind of a family secret that no one in the family was able to get from her prior to her passing.  I came across this recipe and figured that I would give it a shot!  

My very first time making it, he took the first bite and his eyes filled with tears at the fact that it was so close to what his late aunt used to make for him as a child!!  I have never in my life seen a full grown man become so emotional over food!!

Awesome recipe, highly recommend!!

This is a simple and average meal that has comfort food written all over it. I suggest using beef broth inplace of the water ~ adds more flavor, in my opinion.

This is a great recipe for a cold day.  I made a double batch of this for a big family dinner and everyone really loved it.  Be sure to get stew beef - the cheaper the meat the better it tastes after it has been cooking for a long time.  I usually serve this with egg noodles tossed with butter, garlic salt and fresh parsley and a side salad.  Almost everyone went for seconds - good thing I made a double batch!

This made a simple, tasty meal... would definately make it again.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes (pureed in blender first) and bumped up the paprika to 1-1/2 Tbsp since I only had the regular paprika.  I served over buttered egg noodles, with mixed veggies and cottage cheese on the side, and both hubby and 6-year-old son ate it up.  Next time I make this I will use the Hungarian paprika and add sour cream at the end of cooking like other reviews suggested.  Thanks for the great slow cooker recipe!!

Delicious, Rich and Easy! Made this for dinner last night.. got home late from work and it had cooked for 11 hours on low. The meat was so tender it just melted. The sweet / tangy gravy was delicious over egg noodles. Added a dollop of sour cream for appearance 
but didn't need it for flavour. I will definitely make this recipe again. Loved it!

I made this last night for my friends and it was a big hit!!  I ended up finding smoked paprika in the supermarket which i think made the dish. also added red pepper, carrot and mushroom like other review has suggested and served with a pot of sour cream and loaf of bread on the table. Brilliant!  Will definately make again.!

This goulash is very close in flavor to my favorite soup of all time- served at Helga's German Restaurant and Deli in Aurora, Colorado.  However, like Helga's, I added chopped carrots and celery. The carrots went in with 5 hours left, and the celery with 2 1/2 hours left (I think) so they wouldn't get soggy.  Next time: I'll omit the brown sugar.  It was a little too sweet.

This is a very good recipe that came out tasty and flavorful. I browned the meat in some oil before adding it to the crock pot. If you pat the meat dry with a paper towel and then dredge it in flour, it browns much better. In addition, browning the meat in that manner assists with creating gravy for the goulash. I did not have the sort of paprika called for, so I simply used regular paprika mixed with a tablespoon of chili powder and a generous pinch of cayenne. I also added garlic powder and used tomato sauce in place of ketchup. I doubled the sauce, which means that there was plenty to cover the meat and simmer it in. In addition, I added about a cup of finely chopped green bell pepper to the mix. Finally, I made a light brown roux from 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of butter and added that to the mixture during the last hour or so of cooking. I did not find the dish overly sweet, nor was it bitter or sour. It was tangy with just a bit of heat to it, courtesy of the cayenne. I'll make this again.

This was so tasty. I seasoned the beef cubes with salt, pepper, garlic powder, seared it with some olive oil then put in crockpot. I then added the onion into the skillet
cooked until tender added all the other sauce ingredients until mixed, placed sauce in crockpot  then cooked as instructed. I substituted beef broth for the water.  Very good flavor.

Great, simple recipients, but I thought it was on the sweet side.  Definitely will make again, but will omit the brown sugar and replace the ketchup with mixture of tomato paste and beef broth.

This was outstanding! Very easy and absolutely delicious. I did make a few small modifications - with both ketchup and worcestershire in there, I halved the salt and it was fine. Also used heaping teaspoons of all the spices. Delish delish delish.

This was a good recipe, I did make some changes though.  In place of the water, I used beef broth (canned variety) and in place of the flour and water mixture, I used a roux (an amount of butter melted over the stove with an equal amount of flour mixed in).  Otherwise, the only other thing was I couldn't find Hungarian paprika at my grocery, so I used regular.  It turned out very good over the spaetzle.

I use this recipe all the time!A very simple and tasty goulash.   I'm not a big fan of using salt, so the 1st time was too salty for me. 2nd time I didn't use any, which was fine - just needs about a teaspoon  I think. A very good dish served with rice, noodles or potatoes.  Try it!

I will be making this recipe again, next time more of it! I added sliced portobello mushrooms instead of onions (kids don't like them cooked) and organic beef broth instead of water. I tried some crockpot recipes before but they did not turn out well, so I did not know what to expect with this one - but it was soo good! I served it with pasta once, and the next day with mashed potatoes. I used stew beef.

Didn't have time to slow cook. Had on hand 2 lbs. groud beef, onion, and a zuccinni.  Cooked the zucinni with the onion in a little canola oil, and separately fried the ground beef.  Took all the dry ingredients, wisked in with the water, and made a "sauce" to simmer.  After draining 1/2 lb. (not a full pound) of cooked, hot noodles, I returned them to the empty pot and poured in the ground beef, onion and zucinni, and the sauce.  It was delicious!!

I made this with just a few subtle changes; tomato sauce in place of ketchup, 1 tsp of smoked paprika and 1 tsp regular paprika (couldn't find sweet) and beef broth in place of the water. It was great! My husband also liked it and he is a really picky eater and not always willing to try new things. Will be making it again.

This dish was easy, tasted very good, and was a nice change from our everyday fare. It was a tad too salty, so I'll reduce that a bit next time (could have been my measuring.) It even made tough stew meat tender and flavorful, much better than the regular beef, potatoes, and carrots stew I usually make. I will definitely make this dish again.

An excellent goulash for those who like slow cooker meals. The version I use most often is almost identical to this except I use tomato paste instead of ketchup, adjust the amount of water accordingly & use my pressure cooker (20 minutes) for a quick dinner. By the time the noodles are done it's supper!

My husband liked this more than I did, so we are splitting the difference rating-wise.  This didn't look very pretty, but it tasted fine, and the meat was fall-apart tender.  I followed the recipe exactly, but if I make this again, I am not sure I would use the ketchup... would probably go with some of the other reviews and use tomato sauce and/or diced tomatoes.  Garnished with sour cream, and in my opinion, this helped the taste of this dish.

This was one of the easiest slow  cooker recipes I've made. I followed the advice of someone who added their egg noodles the last half hour of cooking. That is also when I added the flour paste but I mixed it with milk instead of water. Cooked on high 4 hours and was very tender. I added mushrooms and used beef broth instead of water in the first use of it and left so left out the salt.

This was really good.  We used stew cubes because that was what we had, and I used beef broth instead of water.  Hubby and teen son gave it a thumbs up.  This was a nice meal to come home to after work on a chilly day.  While my water for noodles boiled, I mixed up my thickening agent for the sauce.  It was a very pretty rich red/brown sauce.  We ate this with a tossed garden salad, and french bread.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband told me to make sure I add a review and mark it 5 stars.  He loved it.  I made it for company and it was a big hit.  It was made exactly as written and served over buttered egg noodles.  Great recipe I'll be making many times.

This was delicious. I, too, floured (seasoned with S & P) the meat and browned in oil before putting in the crock pot and it thicken nicely on its own. However, I wasn't crazy about the texture of the meat, it seemed dried out.  I think my crock pot is on the hotter side. Next time I make this, and I will, I will try on top of the stove instead.

Made this for a dinner party and got favorable reviews on it.  We did all agree that something seemed missing out of it.  Still great taste but seems like it could use something more.  I used venison stew meat rather than beef.  I didn't have sweet paprika so I used regular which was fine since the recipe still had a sweet flavor due to the brown sugar.  I also added some garlic.  I think next time I'll add more garlic and try using a smoked paprika.

I made this for dinner last night. My family ate it, and even had seconds. I subbed tomato sauce for the ketchup, added a small can of diced tomatoes, and added sour cream before serving over egg noodles. Makes a nice filling winter meal.

This was so good. Great on a cold day.  You can do a lot with this recipe.  Next time I am going to add green pepper.  I added a lot extra seasoning.  It also works by cooking on high for 6 or 7 hours.

This is a total abomination, an absurd rendition of a Hungarian classic. Putting ketchup, worcestershire sauce and sugar in this is akin to using cat meat to make a hamburger, totally disgusting!

1/2 cup ketchup 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon brown sugar ??? This looks like real goulash but these would never go into the real meal. Save your taste buds and add garlic onions and get a different recipe.

Made this  in my pressure cooker! It cuts the time down to 10 mins of actual pressure cooking. So easy and tastes like it is slow cooked.  Only added a little Montreal Seasoning to the meat before browning and then 2 boullion cubes to the mixture to pour over the meat. We can make this once a week now!

This is always a hit at my house. Even in the middle of summer, in the heat when all I want is something cool, folks request this dish. I add a little more brown sugar than is called for, and I load it up with potatoes, carrots, and parsnips (very important!!!). Nothing better than assembling at night, plugging in when I wake up, and then enjoying the ridiculous aroma in the house - and of course a wonderful dinner!

This was awesome. I didn't use the hungarian sweet paprika and think that it is key to this dish. It was so tender and the gravy was thick. I wasn't sure how the flour mixture would work and it did!!

This is a very delicious but typical beef stew. Like others I browned the meat first. It was fine served over noodles, but I think it would be better over potatos. Also, traditional goulash usually has green peppers included, which I think would have improved the stew. The best part about this was the long cooking time and tomato softened the meat so that it was melt-in-the mouth tender.

I’m no professional chef, but I could not in good conscious use ketchup as an ingredient.   I used a no-salt added tomato juice with a bit of honey to taste instead.   I also used smoked sweet paprika which was outstanding in this dish.  I brined the meat overnight so I reduced the salt accordingly. Finally, instead of mixing the flour with water, I mixed it with equal parts of the liquid from the goulash.

Very good.....family enjoyed....I sauteed my onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic first. I dredged my beef cubes in flour, salt, and pepper. Added all ingredients to the crockpot and also added 1c. water and a packet of low sodium beef boullion to the pot. I didnt need to add additional flour and water. The flour on the beef was enough to thicken the broth. Served over buttered egg noodles. Yummy!

This came out quite nicely and my main "beef" was only with the beef and, as with so many reviews we see here, it was because I didn't use the recommended cut! I didn't recall "chuck roast" so the butcher recommended a leaner cut which came out a bit dry. I maybe missed the tomato-ness I recall from my youth with an Hungarian cook we employed but this was not far off and quite enjoyable. As one wrote in a Goulash review here, there is no one "right" way to make it. In the end, it boils down to personal taste. Nothing wrong with that! :)

Wow!  I did cut down on the liquid (using 1/2 cp of stock), and I browned the meat before I added it to the crock pot.  Even my picky 10 year old was impressed (he had 3rds!).

My husband and I really liked the taste and the ease of preparation. Wonderful flavor. We served this over Spatzle with a salad on the side. I will make this again.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! My husband is a huge fan of goulash, he orders it every time we are in a restaurant that serves it. He claims, (and I agree) this is better than the restaurant! the only change I made was using spicy paprika instead of sweet. Excellent!

I loved the way this came out, perfect for a cold autumn night! Definitely use the hot paprika. The only change I would make is to maybe add more liquid. It comes out really thick, and I like to add bits of refrigerated biscuit dough to make dumplings (put them in at the same time you add the flour/water mixture). They work better if they have some broth to "swim" in.

Followed the recipe, but cooked it in the instant pot (meat/stew setting) and had super tender and delicious goulash in under an hour. Will definitely make this again.

I thought it was perfect comfort food. I did take the advice of others and used beef broth  instead of water. Next time I think I will grinde up the onions  (so the kids can't see them) and mix the noodles with the meat in the slow cooker at the end.  I loved it.

This was so good. I made 2 changes but only for personal preference.  I added diced carrots with the onion and replaced the 1 cup of water with beef broth. Even without these changes this recipe would be 5 stars.
I served over buttered egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream.

First time I made it,  I had it in the slow cooker for 9 hours.  Meat was overdone, but still good.  

Second time, I used a well marbled pot roast and let it cook for 6 hours.  It turned out PERFECTLY!!!!!!   

I live this recipe.

While this is a different version than I'm used to eating, it is nonetheless very good!
I grew up eating my aunt's (and godmother) Hungarian Goulash.  Her version was made with ground beef and elbow macaroni. 
I made this version as directed but tripled the sauce ingredients, which worked out great. Using the slow cooker is a blessing!
Quite delicious and very easy to make!

My husband loved this and asked me to keep this recipe. I thought it was pretty kids, but the kids didn't much care for it. I did follow the directions, but when i got home from work it looked like very little liquid was left in the crockpot so I added some beef broth and made the sauce from that. I will likely make this again. It was super easy.

DE-LISH!!!  This was so good and easy!  The meat was tender and served with egg noodles it reminded me of the Goulash my mother used to make only better!  The best part is that it cooks in the slow cooker!  What more can you ask for?

I have a similar recipe and came across this one when I was looking for a slow cooker version.  I still used my measurements (an old family recipe) but wanted to let you know that this is a GREAT goulash!  It is delicious without adding any extras (tomato, mushrooms, carrots...)

Really great! I used regular paprika and it still tasted great. Very simple to make especially if you buy the beef already cubed. Served over egg noodles and it was a big hit!

This was pretty good...  would definitely skip either the brown sugar, or replace the ketchup with tomato sauce - as other reviewers said, it was a little too sweet.  I didn't have time to cube the beef and just threw the whole roast in the crockpot - shredded it at the end.  (Also, 1/4 cup of flour made this mixture REALLY thick.  Probably doesn't need that much.)  It's not gourmet, but fits the bill for a slow cooker recipe!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it many times and always get compliments. The best part is that it is so easy, and uses ingredients that you have on hand.  I follow the recipe to a "T" (except I add less salt and I use stewing beef) and always have lots of great sauce to serve over the egg noodles. Thanks for the recipe!

If you are looking for easy crock pot recipes this is it. I didn't even use a crock pot I just placed it in the oven with a lid on. At 200 degrees and it turned out wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  My husband loved it.  It was a little less tangy than I had hoped but still delicious.  It was better the second day as leftovers.  I served it over whole wheat, no yolk egg noodles tossed with butter.  This will definitely be returning to our dinner table!

This was easy to make, and very similar to what I was looking for.  I didn't use a slow cooker, instead I cooked it on low on the stove top for about 2 hours, stirring about every 15 minutes.  I also added garlic powder.  It turned out great!!

So-so, I added mushroom soup instead of all the water as someone else suggested.  It was an o.k. meal, but nothing I would try again.

this recipe has really nice flavour.  The only things I changed was that I didn't use ketchup but instead put in tomato sauce and I added mushroom soup instead of water.  Great taste!!

Delicious over egg noodles.  I'll try adding mushrooms next time.  I only cooked it for 8 hours, plus I'm at high altitude so things take longer to cook, and it still turned out great.  My mom said she always browns the meat when she makes goulash, but I didn't and I think I like it better not browned.

I actually made this in the past and loved the recipe and lost it. I'm so glad I found this again. Everyone I've ever made this for has really enjoyed it. Nothing better than this over rice on a cold winter's day!

SOOO Easy!! I just browned the beef in a little oil, then added remaining ingredients,& turned down on the stove. Great over noodles, rice, or mashed potatoes. I did use a can of diced tomatoes in place of some of the water.  My son likes to add Texas Pete to everything, so that's an option at the table.  Thank you for a great recipe!

GREAT recipe!  I added a lot of extra paprika to give it an extra kick.  The house smelled divine while it was cooking.  We also ate it over egg noodles.  My husband just kept saying, "mmmm".

This was easy and excellent.  We often visit a German restaurant in Queens, NY that makes a great goulash, and this is pretty close.  The one change that I made was using Hungarian hot paprika instead of sweet and that gave it quite a kick - too spicy for some in my family.  Next time I'll try half and half.  Use the authentic Hungarian paprika.  They sell it in the grocery stores and it does make a big difference.

wonderful!! I used hungarian hot paprika which added a nice heat to the dish. I think the people that are finding the dish bland are probably using regular paprika-it's worth finding the hungarian-try a gourmet type market it's where I found mine!

Very good! I added mushrooms for the last hour (I left them whole because nobody else in my family likes them and that way they could pick them out easily). My only complaint -- and this could be something I did wrong -- is that the flour made lumps in the sauce. But since I'd also put in big chunks of garlic, my family thought it was that. :)

Glad to see this recipe on this site.  I
have made this for years and my family
just loves it.  We serve it over egg
noodles.  I prepare it the evening before
and just turn th crock pot on before
I leave for work in the morning.

We loved the flavor! I had ground beef in the freezer, so that is what I used.  It wasn't pretty looking, but it did work.  I used 1 lb. Hamburger and cut the ingredients in half. I did not brown the meat, I just put everything in the slow cooker as directed.  For thickening the sauce  I used mashed potato flakes. I started with 1 Tb. And waited 5 minutes,  then stirred it well. I continued adding a little at a time until it reached the desired thickness. This is faster than the flour method,  in my opinion. I served it over pierogies.  We can't wait to try it with stew meat!

This will be my go too. It was really good. Doubled the recipe but did not add flour  and did not double the sugar or  salt. Still was really yummy. Threw it all in the slowcooker and used pork chops because that was what we had.

I wouldn't know authentic Hungarian Goulash from Sloppy Joe but this was pretty good.  I followed some reviews and used beef broth and added mushrooms.  I cooked it 7 hour on low and it was fine.  But the mushrooms were hard to find.  Next time I will put them in for the last two hours.  It needed something more to amp up the taste.  I will read more reviews and make some additions. I will also use stew meat instead of chuck roast.

I used beef stew meat and it turned out great.  Very easy to make and my husband and I had enough for two meals.  I will make this again.

Nice comfort food. A little bland for my family so I added a little garlic salt and soy sauce. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely fabulous!!! Only thing I varied from the recipe was I cooked it in my Instant Pot for 30 minutes and browned the meat with the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients (only because that seems to be what all Instant Pot recipes call for). Also couldn’t find Hungarian Paprika so just used regular. Definitely on my make again list!!

Tasted terrible to me. I kept going back and rereading the recipe to be sure I didn’t screw up. I didn’t it just didn’t taste good to me. Must be an acquired taste.

my family has been making this version for idk 3 generations.  I do believe it came out of an old Betty Crocker Recipe Book.   It is delicious and is always better the next day.  I also decided to change it up a bit and use ground beef instead of the cubed beef and use the stove top instead of the slow cooker, I call it "Poor Mans Goulash".  its equally delicious

It was ok, but we didn't love it.  I thought it had a strong ketchup taste.  My husband said it reminded him of sloppy joe.

I followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do! I had it over spaetzel. It was pretty close to how I remember my grandmothers, who was from ‘the old country. I’ll definitely make it again.

Like a few others suggested, I seasoned the beef with salt and pepper and lightly dredged it in flour.  I then browned the meat in batches.  I also used beef stock instead of water.
I was feeding a crowd so I made a quadruple batch spread between 2 crock pots.  Instead of cooking on low, I cooked on high and they were ready in 6 hours.  Everyone loved it!

This is a good, hearty dish.  Per other reviewers' suggestions, I increased the paprika (used Spanish paprika that I had) to 1 Tablespoon, and I left out the salt.  The ketchup has plenty of salt in it.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  The dish could have used a bit more seasoning, but if it is too seasoned, my kids won't eat it.  My kids ate this dish.  It had just a bit of sweetness to it that they liked.  I liked finding another good slow cooker recipe that uses beef chuck as I am getting tired of pot roasts.  I was able to assemble this dish quickly in the morning before heading off to work and came home to a house that smelled wonderful.  To make morning assembly even faster, cut your meat and onions, and prepare the sauce, the night before and leave them in the fridge until ready to mix together in the morning.

This is a first!  A recipe you can follow exactly, without having to make any changes, and it comes out fantastic?  Absolutely delicious and super-easy to make.  I will use this again and again, and I think I will put flat dumplings in next time.  You simply can't go wrong if you do what the recipe says to do.  Thanks Rhonda!!

I thought this was very good and flavorful. I didn't have  8 - 10  hours , so I cooked on high for 2 hours and on low for  4. It worked well, the meat fell apart and the vegetables were cooked. The only thing I did differently was to  add carrots and added beef broth instead of water. . This is a good  classic recipe.

Made it exactly to recipe, except for adding 2 beef bullion cubes for flavor. The gravy / sauce had an amazing flavor.
Used Kosher salt with no complaints. Served it over "bowties"
with a can of cream of mushroom / roasted garlic soup mixed in. A heavenly meal . . . ..

I did not make any changes and I would definitely make it again..
Delicious and so easy to make.
The gravy was fantastic over egg noodles, a meal in itself.  The meat was so tender it just fell apart.
I do think it only needed about 8 hours in the slow cooker.
Will DEFINITELY make it again...

We'll definitely be making this again! I made two changes because of personal preferences only. I left out the brown sugar and didn't miss it, and at the end, mixed 1.25 cups of water with the flour. We really like sauce on our pasta. Excellent dish!

The addition of tomato ketchup in my opinion made the recipe too sweet. I upped the amount of paprika and added stewed tomatoes. However I think the stewing beef should be drenched in flour and seared before adding it to the crockpot. Not at all the result I was looking for.

I try a lot of recipes from websites and such.  I seldom go back on and do a "rate and review" though.  Mostly because of time and not remembering where the recipe was found necessarily.  Anyway - this one warranted my returning to the sight and doin so.  This recipe is nothing short of AMAZING.  My husband and I really like this and I will DEFINITELY make this again.  It is a keeper!  I used some of the advice from other cooks as in: substituting beef broth/stock (no sodium) for the water; browned the roast cubes before putting in crock and added minced garlic and a bit of red pepper flake.  I'm sure its fine as written but always look at other's helpful (usually) hints.  I knew our tastebuds were inline with those hints I decided to incorporate.  Try this!  You will not be disappointed!

I took advice of many and used tomato paste.  I thought was OK..maybe too much paste but husband didn't like.

great recipe...wonderful flavor. I only used half of the brown sugar in the recipe and it was still too sweet for my liking. i will be leaving out sugar next time, increasing paprika a bit and cutting ketchup.in half likely subbing in some tomato sauce or puree.  I recommend this recipe for a chilly winter eve!

This was ok, but not one of my favorites.  The meat came out nice and tender and there was a decent gravy, but the flour mixture turned into lumps of flour throughout the gravy and I didn't really care for the sweet taste of this.  I don't know that I would make this again or if I did, I think I would skip the brown sugar and use corn starch instead of the flour.

Tasty and tender.  I did not have Hungarian paprika, so I substituted Penzi's Old World Spice (first ingredient was paprika).  The dish had a nice flavor to it.

I made this as per the recipe with the only change being I used beef stock instead of water. This was incredibly easy to make and tasted superb. My grown up kids are really fussy but there wasn't a single plate that had anything left. I served it with brown rice which absorbed the sauce. This is going to be a regular from now on. Thanks

This was very good however it is not totally like the Hungarians make it.  My sweet grandmother made the best. I just added sour cream , which is an important ingredient. I put it in the sauce.

This recipe for Hungarian Goulash was fantastic! 
After reading some suggestions, I did make a couple adjustments, I added beef broth instead of water. I also added fresh mushrooms, a couple cloves of garlic, (chopped)and just a bit of red pepper flakes. 
I served it with sweet and sour red cabbage and saute  spinach  
On the side. 
This meal was spectacular on a dark cold winter day.

This was one of the only times I've been able to slow cook something  for 10-12 hrs. It made the ordinary stew meat very tender. The recipe was very good and I didn't change a thing.

`Well worth the 10 hour cook time ! Changes made was I added  a carrot, celery and mushrooms seasoned the meat with salt and pepper then browned it in a skillet with olive oil placed the meat in the cooker then soften up the onion in the skillet and deglazed with a splash or red wine, added some red pepper flakes as well. I did use beef broth in place of the water. I used a well trimmed chuck roast cut into cubes. Served over homemade spaetzle with a dash of sour cream and a fresh baked loaf of artisan bread which soaked up the sauce quite well. Will do it again.

Very tasty. Next time I would add the flour/water mixture a bit at a time because I put it all in and it turned out very pasty and not like a sauce. I also found the flavor a bit vinegary but we all still enjoyed it very much and I will make it again. I've never had true Hungarian Goulash so I have nothing to compare it to.

This is a fantastic alternative to beef stew, and is well served over any type of pasta.  I used brown mustard instead of mustard powder, and I cooked it for 5 hrs on high, as I was making it for dinner that evening.  This recipe is fine EXACTLY as it is written.  Please try it that way, I assure you, it will not disappoint.

I never had a goulash dish before so I wanted to try this.  I made the recipe as is and found it to be  OK.  I liked the way the flour and water mixture made the sauce thicken at the end. The Worcestershire sauce flavor was more evident than I expected so if I make this again I will cut  back on that.  I did expect more of a meaty flavor but it wasn't there. Also the meat was just at the point of being dry tasting so I'll cut the cook time to 8 hrs to see if that works.

It was good. I made exactly what the recipe called for but just wasn't for me. Hubby said 3 stars, as well. Just too sweet, I think. We served it over buttered egg noodles.

This was very good and easy to make. I browned pork stew meat in flour and salt & pepper since my wife is Hindu.  I did add a pinch of ground ginger , a can of diced tomatoes a quarter cup of Merlot wine  and the kicker, 3 cubes of Dove dark chocolate. I served it with basmati rice and a dollop of sour cream on top. 

My family loved it! I'll be making this again.

Delicious enough ...but it most certainly should not be called  'Hungarian' Goulash, because it definitely is not that (not by a longshot).

This might taste good but I am Hungarian, born in Hungary.  and this is definitely NOT a Hungarian Gulash.  The only ingredients that is the same in a Hungarian Gulash is the  Hungarian paprika powder, the beef and onion.  I almost felt insulted by this recipe.
Here are the ingredients for the real Hungarian Gulash:
(I cook it still very often as my family loves it.)
700 grams of beef cubed - smaller is better, it cooks faster
1 largo onion - diced to small pieces
1 clove garlic chopped
2 tbls vegetable oil
1 tsp Hungarian sweet paprika powder
1/4 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp salt - you can modify the salt level during cooking.  Add more if you wish as per taste, however watch out for salt if you use VEGETA - see below.
3-4 bat leafs
1/2 tsp caraway seed
1 small to medium tomato diced; 
2 medium potato cubed
1 big carrot sliced 
1 medium parsley root sliced
2 stalk of celery or if you can buy the celery root (small)- that is original - slice it.  If you are using the root cut in 4 big pieces.  Not everybody likes to bite into it so this way it is easily can be removed before you serve the soup.  
THIS IS A SOUP!  Not a beef in paprika sauce.
1 tbls chopped parsley leafs - or 2 tsp dried ones
1.5 cup of beef broth  if you have but you can skip it if you soup has enough "body" without it.
1 tbls VEGETA - This a European dehydrated vegetable powder.  You can get it in any grocery stores in the European  food section.  
I also like to use "Piros Arany" - which only comes from Hungary

Due to an allergy, I omit the mustard otherwise I make this just as the recipe says, and server over no yolk dumpling noodles. Have done this for years, and it turns out great every time.

Suggest using tomato paste rather than ketchup, and add a T of caraway seeds for more authenticity

This is really good and is close to a base recipe of mine. When I'm making beef stew, I leave out brown sugar and mustard and add in red wine and veggies (potatoes and carrots) and some herbes de provence. When making stroganoff, I leave out brown sugar, mustard, wine and veggies and add in sour cream. and parsley. I really liked the spicy sweetness of this. I always use beef base rather than water and I do not bother with making a flour paste I just use gravy flour -- cuts out one step. I use whatever beef cubes are on sale and adjust cooking time. Thanks, this is a new taste for a basic dish I like to make. Great winter comfort food.

I'm not a big paprika fan, but I picked up some sweet smoked paprika just for this recipe.  I only used 1/2 the brown sugar because I don't want my main course to sweet, and chicken broth instead of water to retain full flavors.  It came out great!  The meat was (as my Pappy used to say) tender as a bride's heart, & all flavors came through deliciously!  Would I make it again?  Only if I were going to a theme dinner, or the company coming were Hungarian!

Next time I don't believe I have to slow cook as long. Kind of fell apart too much but flavor was excellent and very easy. Wide eggs noodles were good with it.

This was an excellent recipe.  A family favorite for sure.  I followed the instructions closely but because of time I made some adjustments.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then low for 4 hours.  When adding the flour, I added an extra cup of water to allow for more gravy.

Very good recipe, will make it again. I did make a few changes. I added some baby carrots and chunks of potato. This literally makes it a complete meal. I served mine with rice. I like to make this dish a day ahead of time and keep it in the fridge. The flavor intensifies

This goulash is the way I remember it.  I used a combination of chuck roast cubed and stew meat.  I used regular paprika.  We ate it over egg noodles.  It did turn out good.  I think I would reduce the salt by half.  I seem to be sensitive to salt.  The amount of brown sugar was perfect as it was not too sweet.  I didn't let it thicken long enough, though, and wish I had as the sauce was pretty runny.  I don't know that I will make it again.

My husband and I love trying new recipes from All Recipes - this is the first one we will never make again as it didn't taste like Goulash.  Perhaps if it were named something else....it was too acidic for Goulash.

I am on the fence about this one.  There was something in the sauce that I was not big on.  I'm not sure if it was the worcestershire or the new paprika I purchased.  The meat was super tender and it was easy to do, but I think I prefer the other goulash recipe from this site that was done on the stove top.  Thanks for sharing.

Meh. This was just "OK." Made this for dinner tonight. I DO like Rhonda's version better than Enviro2's (Hungarian Goulash II) though.... For one, I like the fact that Rhonda's version can be prepared in the slow cooker. I also like her sauce much better (Enviro2's is very tomatoey; Rhonda's is subtly sweet). My fiance liked this more than I did. He did find the meat to be a tad bland, but enjoyed the sauce quite a bit. My only suggestion for anyone giving this a try is to season your meat (to taste) with seasoned salt (or table salt) AND pepper and brown in a skillet BEFORE adding to the slow cooker. I would have, but am battling a terrible sinus infection and just didn't feel up to it. Served over egg noodles with warm caraway rye wheat bread, creamed spinach and Sauerkraut Salad (Joan Long Dixon - also on this site), this was a decent meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rhonda :)

This would have been good but it was so salty that I almost couldn't eat it! I will try making it again, because aside from the saltiness, it tasted pretty good. But next time, I'm omitting the salt and will probably add more sugar and use tomato sauce instead of ketchup. It wasn't very saucy and turned out a bit dry...

Lovely.  I only had regular paprika, so I used the full amount of paprika and added about 1/2 tsp. of chili powder.  Didn't change anything else, but did use Wondra flour instead of AP and really liked how it thickened up - something I've always struggled to achieve in the past.

I totally loved this recipe!  I am brand new to cooking dinners.  I even botched this up--by leaving it in the slow cooker too long--and it's not really botched at all!  I just added a little bit of water to the over thickened sauce, and it was all set and ready to go.  I'm so happy I found something even I can't mess up!!

Tasted great as is!  Not enough sauce-double that portion of the recipe.

It came out ok - Very sweet. Sweeter than I like my goulash. But also very easy.

So good!  I just finished the leftovers two days later and it was even better than when I first made it.  I did not change a thing, it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first time using my crockpot and I'm very happy to say it was a success. I didn't mess with the recipe (adding tons of other ingredients is, in essence, creating a new recipe!). Since I'm not a morning person, I chopped everything up and mixed everything the night before and threw everything in the pot in the morning, turned it on and ran out the door. As soon as I got home, the aroma hit me and my tummy growled. It was delicious as a sort-of stew (pre-flour mixture) but was even better thickened. I might  have to try using this as a base for stew and add some chopped tomatoes and see what happens. I can't wait to try more recipes (that don't just use canned soups!). Keep these recipes coming!!!

I loved this! I doubled it so I would have leftovers. Followed recipe exactly and the only thing I would change is the brown sugar. First day the goulash was a little sweet, all I did at the table was add a little worchestshire it!

Excellent.  Will add a tomato sauce instead of ketchup next time and probably mushrooms too.  Regardless, following the directions exactly made for a great authentic goulash.

I followed the suggestion to use seasoned flour (I added a little chipolte seasoning, salt, & pepper) to coat the beef before putting it in the crockpot.  I used all the ingredients in the recipe as stated except for I used 1 tsp dijon mustard and 1 tsp. chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that I added to the food processor when I chopped the onions, plus two dashes hot sauce. It gave the dish a mild "kick".  I also served with a dollop of sour cream on top and it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe--so easy and yummy!

My husband has been craving goulash, so I tried this recipe.  We brought it to a friend's house for dinner and we all loved it.  In fact, there weren't enough leftovers, so I'll make a double batch next time.

We didn't really care for this. There wasn't a nice balance of flavor, it was all tang with no real sweetness. I made some changes though, put in a little beef broth cause my slow cooker burns things if there isn't enough liquid. Also didn't put in the mustard, I just don't like mustard. So that might have skewed the results.

I have made this twice now according to the recipe and I don't think I will try it a third time. Both my husband and I found it overly sweet with a strange zing. It just doesn't compare to my mother's goulash, who unfortunately doesn't use a recipe and is slightly different every time!

This was not the best slow cooker recipe for the amount of work involved. (I cut steaks into pieces, seasoned and browned the meat, created a roux to thicken, etc). The meat was extra tender, but my boyfriend said (as other reviewers have) that the "sauce" was missing something. He suggested Sour Cream. (He's used to goulash with sour cream - although I did pick this one b/c it seemed the best rated HEALTHY recipe!)

I made this for some friends for dinner, and we all loved it.  I never make beef dishes, but I wanted to try something different, and this was delicious!  I served it over egg noodles with a salad on the side - delish!  I will definitely make again, but next time I might adjust the seasonings slightly more to my tastes i.e. more hot paprika!  thanks!

This was very good. I did brown the beef for just a second in a little bit of hot oil. Make sure you get Hungarian paprika, not plain paprika. I think that makes a difference! I served this over plain egg noodles. The only thing I would do differently next time is add about half the salt. It didn't taste salty (rather sweet) but after eating it I was so thirsty!

This was OK. It needed something more. I added a lot more paprika than they suggested, but it still was not what I thought of as goulash.

A wonderful base recipe- I made it with a 2lb round steak instead and added green pepper and garlic. I slow cooked it for 8-9 hrs. Then later added (after the thickening) a little frozen corn and peas. Serve w/ noodles and crusty hot bread. It was awesome!!!

Not great.  Will not make this again, as it didn't have any flavor.  The meat does turn out very tender, but that is all this recipe has going for it!

Thank you for a delicious "something different" meal.  I have just recently become a homemaker again and have been looking for recipes.  I made a double recipe for the two of us, Thank God.  I will be e-mailing this to my NYC daughter for her recipe collection.

I love this recipe!  It's almost the same thing that my Mom makes, except she uses stew beef, which I sometimes use instead, also.  I like to use the spicier paprika when I have it, but either way, it's a family favorite.

Made this recipe twice and love it. It is a 
definite keeper. Second time added diced potatoes,
everything came out very tender. Made a little
extra sauce because of the added potatoes, and it
came out perfect! Will try it with chicken next time. Thanks for this great recipe.

I've made this recipe several times now, and it always comes out great!  I add cubed potatoes and sliced carrots on top of the onions to make this a complete meal.  You need to make extra sauce to cover the vegetables though.  This is a great recipe for the crock pot.  It's also excellent with spaetzle!

Maybe it was because I couldn't find "Hungarian" paprika and just used the red dust you find at the supermarket, but my recipe turned out bland. The meat was very tender but the taste just was disappointing.

My family loved it!  Even my three year old ate a serving.  This is a great crockpot recipe and reminds me of the Hungarian goulash my mother made me as a child.  This one is a keeper!!

This recipe was delicious over egg noodles.  I used the Huingarian hot paprika instead of the sweet paprika and the dish had a little more kick to it.
