I'd give this 5 stars based on how mine turned out, but since I didn't follow the directions exactly, I'll tell you what I did do:
I used Butter Buds instead of butter, so they'd be fat free.  I used 3 Tbsp. honey instead of 2 tsp.  And I added 1/2 tsp. each vanilla and almond extracts.  Then I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour with the 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour.  I ended up with a sticky dough, so added more of each flour.  The cookies came out puffy and YUMMY!  Just enough sweet to satisfy my daughter, and I thougt they were great!  My daughter likes to roll and decorate cookies, but I don't want sweets too often, so these are a great compromise.  You could decorate them with colored peanut butter or Nutella.  For breakfast, my daughter dunked her name (we have letter cutters) in syrup and icing left over from some Dunkables.  We thought these were really fantastic!

Wonderful. I used an extra teaspoon of honey and they were still not sweet at all; great treat for my 5-year-old, and easy to work with. I used cold butter, and for buttermilk I used skim milk with a bit of lime juice. My pan was ungreased and I had no problem with the cookies sticking. Fun easy treat! Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy to make and tasted great (bland and not too sweet... which is what my family likes)!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 of butter stated in the recipe and other 1/2 used sweet apple sauce.  My son loved it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Made some modifications by using what I had on hand:  Turbinado sugar subbed for the honey. Plain yogurt subbed for the buttermilk. Olive oil subbed for the butter. Also ran some Craisins through the chopper and added them. The family seems to like them as evidenced by their quick disappearance!

Very easy to make and fun to do with the kids! My 6 year old did all the mixing and rolling while the 2 year old loved to help color and cut the dough. We used playdoh cutters to cut the dough. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to help with the flavor, and added about 1/4 cup more flour. They still didn't have all that much taste but the girls had fun making them. I also made them thicker. So I had the oven at 350 and cooked for about 8-10 min. otherwise the bottoms were burned and the top wasn't cooked. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made them following the exact directions and was pleased with the outcome.  They do have a hint of honey flavor- not too terribly bland!

Used coffee grinder to grind oats and it worked great.  Also used whole wheat flour and bumped the honey up to 2 Tbsp.  I am happy to find recipes with healthy and wholesome ingredients that are fun to make.  Thanks.

Although it was easy to make, I ended up throwing out the entire batch of cookies.  They were very bland and no one would eat them.

These crackers were a big hit with my daughter's kindergarten class!  I altered the recipe slightly by adding 3 tsp of honey instead of 2, and also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I made two batches and found the dough very easy to work with.  Each batch yielded approximately twenty crackers (mine were dinosaur shaped).  Note that these really taste like crackers -- they are not extremely sweet like cookies.   I will definitely be making these again.

I did not care for this recipe. They were very puffy, bready, and totally unlike any animal cracker I have ever encountered. Will not make again.

We made these today and loved them.  They taste like a soft, slightly sweeter wheat cracker.  I can see why some reviews were negative if people thought they were making a cookie, but this is not really a cookie, itâ€™s a cracker.

These came out really good. Do not expect them to be sweet or cookie like in any way. They are crackers, so they are pretty plain. I had to bake them for 10 minutes rather than 5 to get them crunchy.

My kids loved these. They aren't sweet, but taste nice and oaty. The dough's easy to work with and can be rolled and rerolled as much as necessary.

these  were easy, tasty and fun.  Not over sweet so it is a nice change up from my normal cookies.  The ultimate test is my 2 year old nephew.

The recipe was easy to follow and made a good basic dough for cutting shapes out of, but my daughter wouldn't eat the cookies. However, I think the recipe would be very easy to modify with spices (nutmeg or cinnamon), a bit more sugar or honey and vanilla.

-Changes I made: 3tsp Honey, 1/2cup all purpose flour, 1/4cup whole wheat flour.

-dough was very, very easy to work with.

-had a hearty oatmeal biscuit flavor, but worked very well with a little icing and sprinkles.

-When I found the recipe I was looking for something with a better nutritional value to replace a sugar cookie because I promised the kids we would make cookies with sprinkles.

- I look forward to playing with the recipe, maybe adding cinnamon, or ginger, vanilla, maybe even chocolate. Add just enough icing so sprinkles will stick and this is a great rainy day cookie making recipe without being over the top in sugar levels.

I think these were delicious! I actually used 3 teaspoons of honey because I like sugar! These were pretty easy to make and I have a lot more cutters now since I made these. They're terrific! I brought them to a soccer game and the kids ate them all really fast! I used little play-dough molds that were unused and little star cookie cutters and animal cookie cutters. Definitely making them again!

good, but not what I was expecting- more like a traditional wheat cracker in taste, which is actually what I've been looking for. My kids LOVED them. Only four stars because they were nothing like real animal crackers, though very good for what they are.

I made these according to the recipe, except that I was out of honey, so used maple syrup instead.  I like the taste and texture - sort of like the outside of a biscuit - but would like them a little sweeter.  Next time I will add a bit more sweetner; I think a bit of cinnamon would be a nice addition as well.  I'm taking some to my Dad this weekend, pretty sure he will love them!

Bland crackers (not a sweet cookie like store-bought animal crackers).  My 16 month old loves them!!!  I used part whole wheat flour and replaced half of the butter with applesauce.

I made these using whole wheat flour and I added a good deal of vanilla and about 1-2 tablespoons of Splenda, based on the other reviews. They turned out great. A bit chewier than I would have liked, but I think that is due to the whole wheat flour. Oh, I also added about 1/4t cinnamon. I'll deffinately make these again- they'd be great to make with kids!

Love this recipe, I use it all the time. It is very adaptable.  I've used different flours, oats, and added nuts and seeds for added nutrition.  The dough is always perfect. My children and students love it!

Great recipe!  Buttery and soft right out of the oven, I really don't know how they keep because my family ate them up.  We sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over them to sweeten.

I think the recipe is a good starter so my review is based on the recipe without my modifications. The recipe originally is okay, a little bland and doughy. I added more honey, vanilla extract and a little cinnamon. I also had to add more flour bc the dough was really wet. The cookies were not that crispy so the second tray, I lowered the temp to 350 and cooked for longer. They turned out a little more crispy but still a little doughy in the middle. Would try again and play with the proportions a little.

As a cracker, they were great. The dough is very user friendly and handled very nicely, even with a 3 yr old granddaughter. BUT, not sweet, at all. SO, next time, I will be adding some vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of sugar. Final note, WATCH your time! They brown very quickly! 5 minutes was plenty.

I did not give it 5 stats because I changed the recipe. 

I wanted to use up some baby cereal so I substituted.
1/2 cup grinder oats for 1/2 cup of oatmeal baby cereal
1 tbsp sugar instead of honey
1/4 yogurt (vanilla Walmart brand) instead of buttermilk

I grated the butter first to make the process easier. 
and added cinnamon

These are amazing! I added about a half-teaspoon vanilla extract with the buttermilk and honey, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. These are delicious! I'll be making these often. P.S. -- I got about five dozen crackers from this recipe. Also, I used the set of animal cracker cutters from King Arthur Flour's Baker's Catalogue: http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/animal-pop-out-cookie-cutters-set-of-4?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Shopping&utm_keyword=Animal+Pop+Out+Cookie+Cutters+-+Set+of+4&utm_term=1100001820781&utm_content=Product%20Type&kwid=bingproductads-adid^11602104435-device^c-plaid^1100001820781-sku^3709@ADL10BMC-adType^PLA

If I could give 3 and a half I would. I liked them well enough, but they reminded me a bit of dog treats. They were very dense, also the recipe endeded up making 78! That said, they were nothing like animal crackers.
Modifications: I used 2 TABLEspoons of honey, skim milk, and 3 extra tablespoons of flour to make to dough easier to work with.

What a neat recipe.  I just made them and can't wait for littlest great grandson to try them tomorrow.  He's not a sweet eater, preferring "animal crackers", so I'm hoping these are a hit with him.  I used the small cutter shown, not an animal shape, but the same size as the crackers and goldfish he loves.  If he likes them I'll take the suggestion of one of the other reviewers and look for some play dough molds in animal shapes.  Thinking of making some for myself for snacking, adding some parmesan cheese to the dough.  Thanks for posting.

After seeing the reviews I decided to add brown sugar (1/4 cup to doubled recipe) and nutmeg and vanilla, omitting honey. I cut round biscuits rather than shapes, and they baked up great, but sure enough, tasted like nothing. BUT thanks to some cream cheese icing I had, made them into AMAZING sandwich cookies! Would make them again with double the sugar and hopefully won't need icing. Three stars only because the recipe needs tweaking but is a good basic recipe.

I doubled this recipe, but quadrupled the honey amount, and it was still not sweet enough.  Next time I would increase the honey even more, but decrease the buttermilk/yogurt.

I've been trying to find a good animal cracker recipe for the past few months. This is the third one I've tried. It's the easiest dough to work with, but like other reviewers I have to say they are very bland. I doubled the honey, and added vanilla, cinnamon, and allspice and they still taste like flour. I did end up having to add about 1/8 cup flour because my dough was to sticky as well. I think I'll try again adding some more spices since I like for the dough came out, they just taste awful. Although my 2 year old doesn't seem to mind it.

These came out very bland and tasteless, would vanilla help? Consistency was fine. Wouldn't make again.

My son and I really enjoyed making these, but I must have done something wrong because my dough was way too wet and sticky.  I added more flour (alot) and that, of course, really affected the taste, my 2 year old ate them anyway, but I'd love to try again.  Perhaps using the Saco powdered buttermilk (mixed according to instructions) instead of the real thing was the problem? I love the recipe, I just want to get better results!
