4.9.18  Set my oven for 13 mins, and they were just a bit overdone, so next time, I’ll check at 12 minutes.  Could be my oven, but just watch your time.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and these little doughnuts baked up beautifully light with just the right balance of spices, perfect for a Sunday morning breakfast.  They taste very similar to Donut Muffins on this site.  Nice, thanks for sharing your recipe KitchenResolution.

Pretty much a disaster.  First, the recipe said fill the muffin tins.  DON'T do it.  maybe half full?  They rose just enough to turn into muffins.  and because they were muffins they were much harder to remove from the pan.  Which WAS generously greased.  Second.  The recipe makes no mention of whether or not to let them cool before starting the dipping process.  These are surprisingly fragile, they fell apart just getting them out of the pan, much less dipping in butter, etc.   tasted good, but I got maybe 8 successfully done.  Oh, and no mention of quantity....basically a half, ahem, recipe..

Great addition to my favorite dessert treats.  The recipe looked harder that it really is!   The only mistake I make was at the end...it dipped the entire doughnut puff in the butter and rolled the whole puff in the cinnamon/sugar coating making it to sweet.  My next batch will butter and coat only the top.  Otherwise, this is a keeper.

great recipe
had to put the butter on with a pastry brush and then sprinkle cinnamon mix on top
cooling time may be a factor - 4 mins plus?

I have tried two other donut recipes. Had to make changes to both. This one is the winner! No changes to ingredients. I did change the pan only. Ordered on Amazon a "donut hole" pan. A huge difference on how  this change made a difference. Bottoms cook perfectly . Rise to a perfect round shape.

DIdn't actually make this recipe but it looks a lot like what our family enjoys on special occasions but those are called "Aebelskivers."  You can find it on All Recipes here: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11037/aebleskiver/ 
and on wikipedia for its history, etc.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86bleskiver

I did change a few things. My husband is pre diabetic so I changed the sugars, I did not add the cinnamon & nutmeg to the batter, instead I added some vanilla extract,  &. Then just dipped in butter & rolled in cinnamon sugar mixture. I think they were very good.  The possibilities are limited by your imagination.

I have made these several times since I got the recipe.  These are  a winner for snack time instead of cookies at our shuffleboard games.  Too good for us to make any changes.  I do use a 2 Tablespoon cookie scoop that makes them all perfectly the same size.  Yield: 20

Very yummy! One thing I found missing in many recipes is to be sure and flour your pans after greasing them. My puffs stuck to the pan but still tasted great. I used very old nutmeg. Does it always have a strong taste?

excellent quick little donuts.. made mine in  mini tins..  so they are more like Tim-Bits..  very delicious and not deep fried  for everyone's benefit , might just  do a little less cook time..  next go. But my first off was very good  and should be a big hit with the Grand kids .

The muffins taste very good but they look like muffins, and not holes. I made it in a mini muffin pan and filled them rather full. I shall definitely make these again for company.

Delicious!! Next time though, I think I’ll sprinkle the sugar coating on top of the butter instead of rolling them. I feel like it makes them too dark and thick with that moisture. Maybe cut back on the nutmeg a bit? I love nutmeg but feel this was a bit overpowering for some of my family members.  I will def make these again!

These are easy to make and the grandkids love them (me too!). They even help make them so that makes them even better.

I think they turned out really well and are a nice addition to breakfast. But my brat kids said that they are interesting...... they are a tough crowd.

Tried for first time and liked them. Nothing unbelievable but something different to mix things up.

These were actually pretty good, did exactly as instructed but have to mix the dry ingredients together be4 adding the liquids.  And in half of them I added raisins which I had plumped with red wine. Easy and good.

Maybe it’s the nutmeg!!!!!May try again but omit that and double cinnamon.Spent $5.00 on the nutmeg won’t ever use that for anything.Guess our family doesn’t like it.

My 13 year old Daughter made it and it was delicious. It's not exactly like donuts but close enough
