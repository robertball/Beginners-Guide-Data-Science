I took these waffles to a luau we were having, and they were a hit!  I made a double batch which made quite a few waffles, and everyone snapped them up until they were gone.  After reading some of the other reviews, I made a few changed to the recipe: I only used half of the sour cream, and doubled the coconut milk.  This way they weren't sour at all and the coconut taste was great!  I also just used canned crushed pineapple and it worked just fine.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful change to your breakfast table.  I used canned pineapple and my 4 yr old didn't like the "crunchies", so I will puree the pineapple before adding to the batter.  I'd like a little more coconut flavor, so I'll add a bit of coconut extract.  Be sure to give these a try - YUM!!

These were not worth the trouble.  The sour cream made them too sour.  They were nice and crisp, but I had to use more topping to cover up the sour flavor.

My family loved this recipe! They were different and really delicious. We used canned pineapple and that worked just as well. I would definitely suggest trying these if you like the combonation of pineapple and coconut.

Good base waffle recipe. Made just as is and is great. Next time my daughter wants Strawberries instead of Pineapple, think that would taste great as well.

This is a fantastic waffle recipe!  Very flavorful and a nice change from the standard stuff.  Would be great for a tropical theme breakfast or brunch.  Try adding a handful of macadamia nuts to the grid before pouring in the batter.  Superb!

These waffles are deliciously different.  Just what I was looking for!  They were a hit at my family breakfast.  If you like pineapple and coconut, they are definately worth a try.  Thanks a bunch, Lynn!

I read the directions wrong and put pineapple juice instead of pineapple. They still came out good. The syrup is easy to make and tasted good.

After tasting this recipe, I've been reluctant to go back to plain waffles!  To keep the focus on the flavor of the coconut and pineapple, I prefer adding a few drops of agave nectar instead of maple syrup.  This is my weekend breakfast of choice!

Excellent flavor! It didn't even need syrup! Here's what I did though: omitted the coconut milk (stop, I know that's lame) but I wanted them lighter--so I used 1% milk. THen I sprinkled the batter with coconut (can stir in too). I used fresh pineapple... I had some extra so I sauteed it in 1T browned butter and 1T brown sugar...OMG that was amazing on top of these! The butter and sugar mixed perfectly with the juices from the pineapple to create just enough of a syrup. Wow--this was a great recipe! I didn't have any issue with "sour" tasting--was your sour cream expired?? Yum! This is a favorite!!

Four stars just because the coconut flavor was soo subtle that I almost couldn't taste it.  So I sprinkled shredded coconut on top and that did the trick.  Next time I will just add in 1/4 cup or so of shredded coconut to the batter.  They have potential and they did bring a different flavor to the breakfast table.

This recipe was disappointing. With all the fat in the ingredients, I was expecting a butt kicking, irresistable good waffle, and it was alright. Next time, I will go with Mom's Waffles, and cut the fat by just adding some crushed pineapple and coconut extract.

These were excellent. I didn't have any sour cream so instead I used plain yogurt. Also instead of coconut milk I used Pina Colada mix.

These were delicious, the whole family loved them. The coconut flavor was lost in the waffles, but served with flavorful toppings they were really tasty. I set out the waffles with a choice of sweetened coconut, pineapple sautéed with brown sugar, chopped macadamia nuts or coconut syrup for toppings. Everyone found something they liked and the waffles didn't last long. Thank you for the recipe.

Not too shabby!  The baking smell was delicious!  I would add some coconut to the mix next time to boost the flavor.  The down side to these is the fat!

This recipe was very interesting. I think if I were to make it again I would puree the tropical fruit medley that you get in the glass jars at the store and possible add just a bit more sugar or honey.

The flavor was Sooooo good.  Indescribable with maple syrup.
As usual, I made a bunch of changes.  Wheat flour, flax seed, random ingredients like that, loose measuring... So don't blame my comments on the recipe...   But it didn't smell great while baking, and the waffles weren't crispy from the belgian waffler.  Still, the flavor was so excellent that the waffles are irrestible.  Fresh or reheated.

I just got a waffle iron and this was the first recipe I tried with it. This is very good especially topped with sliced bananas, whipped cream, and a  drizzle or two of maple syrup. I will double this batch next time though because 4 waffles was not enough!

I tried to follow the recipe, but there were a few things I had to change. Used low fat cocoanut milk, but doubled the amount, drained a can of pineapple chunks and puréed them, halved the sour cream, added 1tsp of coconut extract, and changed out the butter for 2Tbl of canola oil. Still had plenty of fat to make them crisp, and the flavor was oh so wonderful! I combined the leftover coconut milk and pineapple juice with about 1/4c palm sugar, boiled that, and then added 2Tbl of cornstarch dissolved in about 1/4 c cold water, and brought it back to a boil to thicken. Thought it might be overkill, but it was amazing! Baby declared them "NumNum!" too! :-)

Very good waffles. Only change I made was swapped out the sour cream for vanilla yogurt as that's all I had on hand. A nice smooth tasting enjoyable treat. It did not taste coconutty or pineapplish. No one guessed those ingredients were in it. Will make again.

The recipe lacks actual coconut, so I sprinkled some on top of the waffles as they cooked, which was wonderful. I also made a pineapple/mango syrup with juice, brown sugar and a bit of cornstarch to pour on top, rather than maple syrup. Again, it was yummy!

Delicious. Very buttery and almost flaky for a waffle. Made 4 waffles in Belgian style waffle maker.  I appreciate the inspiration.  

Modifications:  
-Substituted oat flour for AP flour.
-Added 1 Tbsp of fresh ginger to pineapple and let sit for 5 minutes before adding fruit to recipe.  Must love ginger!
-Added a bit more milk (maybe 2-3 Tbsp) to thin out just a bit so would fill-in entire Belgian waffle iron.  
-Next time will reduce butter to 2T and add 2T coconut oil for flavor.

These were ok.  Not worth the effort.  And they barely made 4 servings.  More like a healthy 3.  For all of the ingredients, I expected more flavor.  There really wasn't any flavor.

I thought these were very good waffles - the only change I made was that I used light sour cream. This was a popular recipe with my husband, and it's a good brunch item for company. This recipe is a keeper.

These we good.  I used canned crushed pineapple.  I added 1 tsp of coconut extract,  I only had 1/2 cup sourcream so I added 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt to make a full cup.  My batter seemed a little thick (but not bad) so I added a little extra coconut milk.  We ate these topped with whipped cream and syrup, and sliced bananas on the side.  I like the other persons suggestion of adding chopped macadamia nuts to the batter, it woiuld probably be good.
