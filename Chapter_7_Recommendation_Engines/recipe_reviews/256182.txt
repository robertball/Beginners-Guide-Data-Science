Albeit the ingredients may seem like all other types of nut milk, this recipe has a twist in method that deserves your attention. My dates were fresh and plump, not dry at all. I considered skipping the soaking method but wanted to try the recipe properly. I am so happy I did. In an hour, the dates had broken down and this resulted in a smoother texture in the final milk. Excellent idea, great recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.
