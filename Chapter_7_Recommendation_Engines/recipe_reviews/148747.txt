I loved this!. I can only give it 4 stars because you'll need to tweak a little... Follow the directions in the recipe, but don't put the totellini in until time specified on the package. Mine said cook for 2 minutes. If you put in for the full 30 minutes as recipe states, you'll have over cooked pasta! I forgot to buy mushrooms so I had to leave them out, but I really want to try it again with them. This was my first time cooking with leeks and I really liked the flavor; I asked my produce guy and he suggested to only use the white part of them.. I also only used 1 Tablespoon of tobasco and it was just right for our liking! After about an hour the tortellini starts to soak up the liquid, so you may want to add an extra cup of broth. Hubby loved it and I did too! Will make again and again!..Thanks!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I tweaked the recipe a little but it was an excellent base.  Following another's post I used the spinach and feta sausage.  I used the 3 cheese tortellini but it came with spinach pasta.  I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth for a richer base.  I doubled the recipe because we have a big family and that made the recipe call over just over a 1/4 cup of hot sauce!!!  That would have killed us!!!  I used Tabasco and measured, added and tasted after each tablespoon and ended up with 2 1/2 tablespoons for the amount of liquid.  I added chopped baby spinach just before I served this and it was an excellent addition.  I served it with crusty bread and it was a fabulous meal.

All of that being said, as others have shared, I was skeptical at first that this would have any flavor at all.  But evidently, just the stock with the hot sauce and salt and pepper were enough.  I assume that the stock also picked up the flavor of the sausage and other veggies as it cooked as well.  Very good soup and hubby says I get a gold star for this one : )

I must admit, this recipe didn't sound like it would wow me, but boy was I wrong! There's something about the combination of sausage and tortellini in chicken broth with fresh cilantro and hot sauce - WOW! The flavors all mesh beautifully and develop into the most tasty, delicious soup I've had in a LONG time.  Definitely give this one a try - it's amazing how much flavor you get with minimal ingredients! Oh, also, I didn't have leeks on hand so I used a whole onion instead and it was fantastic.

I rated it a 3 the first time we made it because to me it tasted like hot dog soup. The second time at it I used a spinach and feta chicken sausage instead of a muchroom chicken sausage, Tapatillo hot sauce instead of Chalula,a spinach and parmesan torellini instead of 3 cheese, double mushrooms and only 1 tbsp of hot sauce. Now my husband and I love this recipe.

This really is a great recipe.  I used italian sausage instead of chicken sausage as my store was out of it.  I increased the mushrooms for a heartier soup and used twice as many tortellini (5 cheese!).  It was to die for.

We LOVED this - the spicy chicken sausage gave it a really good flavor. Only 4 stars because 30 minutes of simmering would be far too much for the tortellini so I put it in just for 8-10 minutes, according to package directions. Worked like a charm. Also, I had some leftover beef broth to use up, so I used 2 c. beef broth and 4 c. chicken broth. Our company liked it, too.

This is an AWESOME soup!! I think I ate 1/2 of the pot the second it was ready. I used kielbasa instead of the chicken sausage because I think with the mushroom and leek it would be a better blend of flavors, but Im sure its great either way.

Happen to have all the stuff at home that needed to be used...YUMMY! The only change was instead of sausage (not a fan, usually) I used chopped/diced chicken breast and cooked it with the leeks and mushrooms than added the broth..ect. Hope this helps, I was hesitate to try, but glad I did.

Go easy on the hot sauce!  I gave this four stars only because 3 tablespoons of hot sauce may ruin this for some.  I started with 1 tablespoon thinking I would add more as I went but one was enough!  Excellent taste, my husband liked this one a lot.  Also, as several people said, put the tortellini in only at the very end according to package directions or you'll end up with mush.  Excellent warm weather treat!

This was really satisfying, nest time I'll cut down on the hot sauce a bit. It was just a tad over powering

I did everything liked the recipe said except I used smoked turkey sausage in place of chicken sausage because I couldn't find any. It was amazing! and the smokiness of the turkey sausage added another dimension to the soup! Just be sure not to used any other sausages because they seemed to develop a funny texture...

I have made this 3 times.  It is a simple and flavorful recipe.  I have made double batches and froze extra for my college kids to enjoy later since they are always short time to cook.  Every time I make this I get asked for the recipe.

This was really great. I used spicy smoked sausage because I have a lot in the freezer, so I cut down a little on the hot sauce (used Louisiana Hot Sauce) and we loved it! Really nice on a cold evening! Thanks, Jane!

This was amazing. I'd never made soup before and this was so easy! I got plenty of compliments, but even without them I love this enough to make it again. Thank you! Ah, and my tortellini came out nicely, but it was the dried version. Maybe those with overdone pasta bought a pack of the refrigerated kind?

What a great an easy soup.  I used my dutch oven.  After cooking the leeks I removed them and browned the chicken apple sausage so I could deglaze the pot with the broth.  I used only 1tablespoon of tabasco and added the pasta towards the end as to not overcook.  Excellent!

We liked this soup except for one thing...way too spicy! I only added 1 tablespoon of tabasco and thought we better test it before adding more. 3 tablespoons and your lips would have been on fire! Be careful with adding the tabasco!

A very hearty winter night treat!  As others have stated, a lot of flavor from minimal ingredients.  Since I could not find a good sausage the day I was making, I used chopped breast and thigh meat cooked in the skillet after the leeks and mushrooms.  I served this with a rosemary bread and green salad.  Everyone loved it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but I had to tweak it because I didn't have tortellini or leeks...I used shallots and rice instead. Also didn't have hot sauce, used cayenne pepper instead...but it was delicious!

REALLY delicious and easy to make. I needed to use up exactly 2 leeks, so this was perfect. I was surprised to actually find spinach and feta chicken sausage at my local supermarket, so I used that in accordance with other reviewers' recommendations. After reading other reviews, I added the hot sauce to taste and ended up using 2 Tbsp. I didn't need to add any salt at all, but I did add some pepper. Can be served over rice or additional pasta for more heartiness, but this is fantastic as is!

This soup was exceptionally good.  The flavors were well-balanced and eating this soup produced moans and utterances of "so good" (even moreso on the second bowl)!  I made this with 2 Tbl Tabasco on the advice of others and the heat was subtle, though I think I will go full strength the next time I make this.  This is one of my best Allrecipes finds in some time.  Thank you, Jane!

The first time I make a recipe I follow it as presented. As presented I can only give this 3 stars. The chicken sausage was bland and the tortellini began falling apart after the second heating. This is a recipe that is worth playing around with and tweaking ingredients. But it is definitely a soup to be consumed the same day made. Leftovers are sub-par.

This is so simple and so delicious!! Thank you for sharing. The broth was amazingly complex. I used the whole three tbsp of hot sauce (louisiana) and found it to be perfect. My 16 month old daughter also loved it. I did boil the sausage paices in the soup, but maybe next time I will either boil them whole and then sliced them, or fry them first and then add them to the soup. They were a bit chewy, but I think the boiling method added another element to the broth. Try this soup! Its great!

I love simple recipes like this that you can tweak in so many ways. I used a tube of chicken sausage as my store didn't carry links and I just made meatballs, and it worked great.  I also added extra garlic, for a bit of kick. I used half stock and half broth which I think made it a little richer and a splash of white wine to finish the saute on the leeks and mushrooms, just a splash.  This is the sort of recipe that can be varied in so many directions, a nice base to start with, Bravo!

This would be way too spicy with all that hot sauce, but I used a little more than a tablespoon only and it was great. We sprinkled with parmesan and called it yum :)

This soup is very tasty but I only used 1 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce and I thought it had a punch to it.  Cannot believe people used so much in this dish.  Anyway, I used only 1 leek, spinach and feta chicken sausage and spinach and cheese tortellini.  Added a handful of shoestring carrots to give it some color.  Very easy to make.

I omitted the tortellini and cut back on the broth because I wanted to serve the mixture over angel hair pasta. I didn't like the idea of boiled sausages so I browned them, whole, in olive oil, then sliced them up. Flavor-wise, I thought it was missing something, but I'm not sure what. Not bad though. Thanks!

I thought this was really great. I used turkey italian sausage because I couldn't find chicken sausage at the store. My family really enjoyed it. Also was really simple to make.

I thought this soup was too thick - I added about a half a cup of water and the broth was still "gooey". Also, too many leeks. I would scale it back to one large leek. I also think that you need to add the tortellini only about 10-15 minutes before serving or else it becomes mushy and falls apart. Interesting flavors, though.

I have never made this soup the same twice.  I always seem to be missing one ingredient, but it always comes out fantastic.  One time I didn't have tortellini and used spiral pasta instead and another time I didn't have sausage and used chicken. Still turned out great!

I am not a huge soup fan, but my husband is, so I decided to give this a go.  We LOVED this soup -- my husband said it was exceptional!  This soup has a surprisingly Asian taste/feel to it despite the prevalence of Italian ingredients.  I used portobello mushrooms, and a gourmet chicken sausage (Saag's asiago fennel).  I also cut back on the Tabasco (I used 2T) and it was still plenty spicy.  My husband and I both love cilantro so I chopped up a couple tablespoons and threw it in for the last 5 minutes of simmering.

LOVE THIS SOUP!

Awesome.. light but still warm for those cool nights. I experimented with a few changes. I used Tuscan broth instead of regular chicken broth. This gave it a Meditteranean flavor. I also added a little bit of dried Marjoram. This is a great recipe from the start and also a great starter to add or change to your own taste. Congrats to the creator of this recipe.

Great and easy recipe! I added rotisserie chicken because we had it and a few extra veggies to nurse my sick husband back to health. It even was good the next day which I wasn't sure about. Will be cooking this again!

This was AMAZING. I grabbed this because I was looking for a recipe to get rid of my extra leeks. I thought it was going to be servable but nothing amazing. I took one bite and nearly swore with how delicious it was. One of the best meals I've made in months.

Personally my family likes spicy things so we used two tablespoons of sriracha hot sauce (which I guess is supposed to be hotter than tabasco). Cutting rounds out of raw sausage was difficult so they ended up like little meatballs more than anything else. I had to use apple flavoured chicken sausages because they were the only ones I could find at my grocery store. If you like hot food this is definitely very yummy.

LOVE this recipe. My only problem was that it was actually very light on the broth and I love broth. So I just added more chicken broth and it turned out great! I followed the other review's suggestion of adding the tortellini after 20 minutes to let it cook for it's recommended time of 10 minutes. I've made this a few times now and people keep asking for more.

I accidentally tried this with chorizo (a hard, spicy, Portuguese sausage) and it was AMAZING. I still added a tiny bit of hot sauce, but I'll definitely do that on purpose from now on.

Thank you Jane for the recipe. My husband who is not a huge fan of soup really enjoyed it very much. I would make it with either chicken or perhaps a different kind of sausage as we felt the meat tasted like hot dogs as another reviewer wrote. It was a great way of getting in leeks. We will try this again.

Great recipe.  I changed nothing except for the type of sausage (I used Aidells Italian), and I am usually not a shroom fan but they add an earthy flavor thats pretty good.

I made this soup after reading reviews, I used unsmoked chicken sausage which I cooked seperately then combined all ingredients, did
not have tortellini but used ditallini pasta instead and added baby 
spinach.  Only used 1 tsp hot pepper sauce, which was perfect for us.
Will make again, very tasty!

Fantastic soup...We rarely remake recipes because we like to keep trying new things, but this one makes frequent appearances.  I used chicken-apple sausage de-cased for a softer sausage, added fresh spinach at the end, and used ravioli instead of tortellini. Its tempting to eat it all up, but it just gets better and better by the day while in the fridge.

I tweeked it like the others, but this is a great soup.  Used alot of cilantro (probably a half cup chopped) because we love it.  Added some chopped toasted pine nuts.  Also only cooked the tortellini according to package.  Great soup!

Slightly browned the sausage,  sauteed the garlic with the leeks and mushrooms (Baby Bellas).  Halved the hot sauce and served.  Great flavor! We loved it.  Will make again.

Made this today and I tweaked the recipe just a bit.  I cut up 3 strips of bacon in 1 inch squares and sauteed that in olive oil.  Then I added the leeks and mushrooms.  Instead of the sausage I used 1lb of chicken breast that I browned in the pan used for the leeks and mushrooms.  I cut the amount of hot sauce in half so my children wouldn't notice the heat and then I added the chicken, leeks and mushrooms to the stock and tortellini.  For extra color I added about a cup and a half of fresh baby spinach (instead of parsley) that I just tore up by hand.  I served it with a small salad and crusty french bread.   My children even asked for seconds.

So good.  Don't be shy about adding the hot sauce.  You could easily add different flavored tortellini, but the delicate balance of this dish is what makes it so good!

My family & I are in the category of those who really loved this soup!  My changes were very minimal - less Tabasco as my husband doesn't do hot, more mushrooms as we love them, and a little more broth (combo of chicken & veggie).  The tortellini we had on hand had meat - it was wonderful.  My daughter asked me to leave this recipe to her in my will (!)  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Super! Great leftovers.  3 TBPS tabasco must have been an error in the directions.  2 tsp of tabasco added great flavor and not to much spice.  As others recommended toss in the tortellini at the end, 10 minutes of cook time will do.

This soup was easy and delicious! My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it. I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and and made a couple of my own changes: I browned the sausage first. I waited until the end to put the tortellini in, so it only cooked for about 4-5 minutes and didn't get all mushy. I used Baby Bella mushrooms. I added about 1/2 Tbs of celery leaves. I used 2 different flavored chicken sausages -  a Buffalo Wing and Garlic, as both hot sauce and garlic are in the recipe and so they definitely intensified those flavors.

Great start to a unique soup.  A little bland for my taste, so be sure to season to taste when you make it.  Will make again.

Delish!  My boys don't like mushrooms so instead I substituted already cooked carrots at the end.  Also cut the hot sauce back to 1 tablespoon, for my 2 year-old.  The sweetness of the chicken sausage with the little spice of the hot sauce made this!

My husband ate it up.  I did exclude the tortellini, substituted turkey sausage for chicken sausage, and used rooster sauce in place of the hot sauce.  Will make again!

That was some darn good soup. I used smoked sausage, I don't like chicken sausage. I also used chicken and cheese tortellini. This was my first time using a leek. It was so good it gave the soup so much flavor. I cooked acording to the recipie and everything turned out great. The tortellini was the perfect texture.

This was very easy and turned out great!  I made a couple of changes - 1 shallot instead of leeks and bratwurst (yes!) instead of chicken sausage (couldn't find any at the store).  I used more mushrooms than recommended and cooked them a bit longer, until golden, which really enhanced the broth.  As other reviewers have mentioned, add tabasco to your liking. Nice and simple and very tasty!

Loved this recipe and will certainly make again.  I veered slightly from the recipe with ingredients and cooking instructions, making it in one pot,  but the results were the same.  I used feta/spinach chicken sausage, which after slicing I added in with the simmering leeks and mushrooms, which I cooked in the soup pot.  When done, added rest of ingredients and continued on as directed.  I did substitute ground red pepper in leiu of the hot sauce.  Yummy!

Not sure on this one..we liked it, but thinking I could of changed something I did with it. I took other reviewers ideas about not cooking the tortelli so long, which i did. But wasnt that kean on the tortelli..maybe a meat filled tortelli, would of been better and leave out the sausage? I noticed someone else used spinach instead of leeks, this would make it taste even more like italian wedding soup? Has anyone else tried this? will make it again..but will try to change it a bit.. :0)

This was just ok.  Cooking the tortellini for 30 minutes was way too much cooking time.  It was no longer al dente.  I did scale back the garlic (hubby can't handle a lot of it) and put in what I thought was an adequate amount of hot sauce.  I used sweet italian chicken sausage.  I don't know -- it just didn't work for me.

This was a great recipe... like other reviewers, I was leery of how it would come out. And not to mention, I've never really made soup and my boyfriend isn't typically a fan of soup based meals... but we were both pleased with the results.  Soup did taste a bit like hot dogs, but it went well with all the other ingredients.  That little bit of spicy-ness was perfect!

I added white kidney beans which I think improved it.

We like spicy food and hot sauce but I used just 2 Tbsp and that was too much.

This soup was delicious. Only change I made was to cut back on the hot sauce from 3 tablespoons to 1. Also threw in some frozen spinach. Wonderful flavors.

I just made a couple of changes, but overall, my family and I  liked the soup, nice and hearty. I used bulk mild Italian sausage instead of cooked links, as I just like the look better. I used a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce instead of Tabasco which was a tad too hot, but I was able to tone down the broth a bit. Next time, I may use a combo of mild and hot Italian sausage and leave out the hot sauce all together. I doubled the mushrooms. I used a package of fresh  mushroom and cheese tortellini and put those in last and they stayed firm.

I followed the recipe but I didn't add the tortellini.  I also added a touch of salt and pepper to the saute of the fennel, mushroom, onion, leek, my leeks from the garden were small so I added 1/2 of a large vadalia onion diced.  I first added 1 lb of skinless boneless chicken thighs diced into bite size pieces  seasoned with montreal chicken seasoning and a touch of salt and pepper with evoo to stock pot and sauteed before adding the sliced Bilinski Fennel Spinach and Garlic to saute.  I then removed and sauteed the veg, I also added  1-1/2 medium zucchini quartered and sliced for more veg to the soup.  Then added the meat back in, then water, better than broth, 5 tsp roasted chicken bouillon and 1 tsp roast beef bouillon(I find a combo of beef and chicken makes a richer broth when i make soup), added garlic brought to boil,then down to rolling boil with cover on for 30min.  Chopped 1/2 bag fresh spinach and let cook on low for abt 5 min, shut off.  I cooked smoked mozzarella asiago ravioli separately and put one in bottom of bowl and ladled soup over the ravioli.  Sprinkled a blend of shredded aged asiago/parm on soup.  Break up the ravioli in your bowl for extra rich creaminess.  This soup base is so rich and savory on its own it reminds me of the depth of spectacular french onion soup broth.  You just want to keep on eating it!!

I do love this recipe. It's light and easy to do. A tip- I cook my tortellini separately and add it to individual bowls when I serve it. I even leave it separate when I store leftovers. It keeps the pasta from getting mushy.

So I loved this recipe. It's flavorful and introduced me to leeks. I did make a few changes though. First I used reduced sodium stock instead of broth, second I only used 1.5 tbsp of hot sauce since I'm not a huge fan of spicy food but wanted a little heat, last I added extra mushrooms and tortellini because I had them on hand and nothing else planned for them.

Love this recipe!  I tweaked it a little by waiting until the last 5 min to add chopped fresh spinach and the tortellini.   So much flavor for a clear broth soup!

I sautéed the mushrooms with the leeks in a little butter and olive oil, put in the garlic and turkey sausage to cook together. Then I added to the north to cook. I added the tortellini at the end for the last 5 minutes per the package and they turned out great. The reason I am giving 3 stars is the overwhelming hot sauce. I cut back to one tablespoon after the other reviews, but still way too hot. Definitely add the Tabasco a teaspoon at a time until it gets to the right el of spice for you.

I have made this a few times using different ingredients.  I don't like mushrooms so I left them out. I used Alfresco's sweet apple chicken sausage, cheese tortellini,  carrots and celery. Also made it w/o the tortellini.  The sweat apple chicken has a slight maple flavor and makes a wonderful flavor addition. This is a great starter recipe. Wait till the last 10 minutes before adding the tortellini.  Otherwise it will be mushy. My biggest advice...watch the hot sauce. First time I used 1 tbsp each of 2 different types of habanero sauces. 2nd time my guy did not hear me say 1 tbsp of each and we ended up with 4 tbsp of habanero sauce...which even for people that like heat like we do, was inedible. If you don't like heat, omit the hot sauce or use tsp vs tbsp.

I had no mushrooms, but would love to try it again with them. Very very good! I doubled the recipe but only added one tablespoon of tabasco, it was definitely enough. Very good recipe!

I will definitely make this again! I used turkey sausage instead of chicken and it was great. I would reduce the hot sauce to 2 tbsp of hot sauce. I have a very high spice threshold and I had some difficulties with this one.

This soup seemed like a really strange combination of ingredients. My husband asked me if I was using a recipe or just throwing everything in the fridge in it! This soup was really good, though!

I followed the recipe pretty closely with a few minor changes. I browned apple chicken sausage first, then sauteed the leeks, garlic, and mushrooms in the oil. I brought the chicken broth to a boil, added in the ingredients already cooked and the cheese tortellini. Simmered for 15 mins. My husband, who is super picky (snobby about his food), really enjoyed this recipe. Even my 5 yo was eating the mushrooms! Will def make it again!

My boyfriend and I both loved this dish.  I followed the recipe and added onions, garlic cloves, and used hot Italian sausage for extra kick.  It is definitely a new favorite for us!
