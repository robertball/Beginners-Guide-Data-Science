This is a delicious version of chilaquiles. They are so savory but not overly seasoned. I reduced the amount of garlic, though. I did not use two skillets. I just pushed the mixture to one side of the skillet and added the eggs on the other side, slowly mixing it all together. Thank you for the recipe.

I believe more than 5 eggs were needed or a little less tortilla chips wasn't creamy enough for me. But it was still very good all I did was cook some more eggs.
