Perfect and simple dry rub.  This is very easy to make and leads to tender, flavorful ribs.  I like that it is middle of the road in spiciness and doesn't have any odd flavors.

I absolutely love this rub! I put all ingredients except chilli pepper flakes which I regret it would have gave it a kick! If you like a well balanced rub try this not too sweet and not too spicy!

Delicious!!

Loved it. Just enough heat; everyone enjoyed these ribs!  Topped them off with a little BBQ sauce on the grill, they were good.

Enjoyed this rub - but didn't think it was spicy at all.  just a hint.  will definitely make again but will change the balance of brown sugar to spices.  definitely a keeper.  Used this on chicken breasts that I grilled.

Made it exact and smoked wings on my pellet grille. 3 hours and turned out fantastic. Sweet and spicy and a little kick every now and then from the red pepper flakes.

I love this rub. It has become a regular in our dinner rotation.  I omit the brown sugar and use it on chicken breasts.  I usually pound the breasts just a little to even out the thickness, then cook them in an iron skillet with a couple tablespoons of avocado oil.  My family and I love it!!

A decent beginner's rub. We cut down the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon and the black pepper to 1 teaspoon. We kinda like having the taste buds on our tongue and not flamed away.

I used this for my first time ever smoking anything. I used chicken legs and I thought it was great. I used some hickory wood chips with it. I put the leftover rub away for the next go round.

Spices was tasty, but I would have liked a little more tenderness and or moist.   Anyone have any suggestions to achieve this, please share.

This is so delicious. Sweet and spicy.  My husband loved this so much. I loved the flavor, but a little too spicy for me. It burned my lips, but I had to eat it anyway, because it tasted so good!

The flavor of this rub was nice on baked chicken, however I thought it was much too spicy for me and my family (and I usually like spicier foods).
