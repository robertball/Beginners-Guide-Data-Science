YUMMY!  Made this for Easter and everyone loved it, saying it was light, refreshing, and the perfect spring/summer dessert. My only complaint is that even adding almost 1 C of chopped strawberries (frozen, with just a touch of sugar to sweeten), there still weren't enough. There was too much filling for me to get the cover back on the pie crust, and that was without adding the berries to the top.  Next time I'll make my own graham crust in a 9x13 and use 1 1/2 C chopped strawberries, but will definitely make again!

I made my own crust in a 9" square pan. Saved just a dollop of the lite whipped topping, added 1 Tablespoon of powdered sugar to help stabilize it for a pretty topping after it was set. I precut the pie into sixteen pieces then added the strawberry slices to it. This was a great hit at church and each slice of pie had two pieces of strawberry on top. I, personally, don't particularly like strawberries, but this might have me rethinking that decision. I really like this pie.

Very quick and easy and tastes really good!! I didn't measure, but I think I added 1 1/2-2 cups of the chopped strawberries. It worked nicely, otherwise, I think there wouldn't be enough in the pie filling. I was surprised how much filling it did make. I used a bigger shell than the 6 oz, and it worked out perfectly. My boyfriend loved it.

This was delicious and so simple to make! The only thing I would change is add more chopped strawberries in the pie. There just wasn't enough. Also, a homemade graham cracker crust tastes better than a store bought one. I will definitely make this one again. :)

My wife of over 60 years, who is the baker in the family, did this recipe today. Gotta say, and I have been cooking since 1947, this is the BEST strawberry pie we have ever had. Got sorta tired of straight strawberries, and this dessert will be made again and again. Easy to follow, very easy to do! We only let it get cold for 3 houra, it will be better tomorrow!!  Cheers, old Dougirv in BC

This is such an EASY pie to make! My 2 year old daughter even helped! And the wait for it set is worth it. It is SO delicious! I'm definitely making this again and again!

Very easy recipe! I took two of these pies to a cookout at my husband's friends house and everyone liked them. My husband isn't a big fan of strawberries and he liked it too. I used store-bought strawberries that weren't all that sweet, so I sprinkled them with sugar and let them set until it melted in. Turned out really good. This is great for a cute & tasty dessert when you don't have a lot of time to cook.

This was a great end to a meal on a HOT summer day. So easy to make and everyone raved about how cool, creamy and refreshing it was. I used a reduced fat pie crust, sugar free Jello and light Cool Whip so it was easy to incorporate into the Weight Watchers plan.  Thank you for such a GREAT recipe!

Fantastic!  Made my own crust (see Graham Cracker Crust I - great!), followed advice and added nearly 2 cups of strawberries (frozen, thawed), and it was fantastic!  Second time I made it I used light jello, which I do not recommend - tasted more bitter and fake.

Very good! I think more strawberries within the pie and it would be even better!

We enjoyed this pie and it was very easy! Great for a hot day when you don't want to cook. I'd like to try it with different flavors of JELLO, and see if fat free cool whip would work.

OMG.  I made this for our Memorial Day party and added some changes.  I added Strawberry Chobani Yogurt to thicken it a little and poured the mix into a pre made Oreo Pie Crust.  I placed it in the freezer for about an hour and  topped it off by melting 2 cups of chocolate chips in the microwave and layered it on top of the pie, it hardens pretty quickly.  I then placed it back in the freezer overnight.  I garnished with cool whip and strawberries and blueberries.  This was such a HUGE HIT!  I highly Recommend it!!
