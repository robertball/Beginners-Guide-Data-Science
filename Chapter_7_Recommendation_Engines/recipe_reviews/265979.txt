Perfect as written! The shell gets so crispy but the inside is nice and fluffy. My husband said it was the best baked potato he has ever had. He even ate the entire peel which is unlike him. I  guess I know how I will be preparing baked potatoes from now on. 5 star recipe all the way! Thanks Bren!

It was exactly what I was hoping for!  I used bacon grease to rub over the potato skin, and cooked according to the directions.  The potatoes turned out great!

Wow, I never would've thought to do this, although I adore my air fryer!  Last night I rubbed a good-sized baker potato and a sweet potato with duck fat, then sprinkled with sea salt, and into the air fryer for 30 minutes at 390*, then turned them both over and another 30 minutes at 380*.  PERFECTION.  Fluffy inside, crusty skin, just the way I like it.  Thanks for this great idea!

20 to 30 mins at 390 degrees on air fryer, that's enough.

Always loved to order a really well done baked potato at a Steak House. The Air Fryer baked potato lives up to the Steak House version I love. I Gooped (my husband's term) up the potatoes with butter, sour cream and grated cheese, bacon bits and snipped chives.

I loved this recipe and only changed to olive oil instead of peanut, didn't have that on hand. The smell reminds me of the old way of wrapping the potato in foil and throwing in the grill with charcoal. The taste is great and I will never make a baked potato in the microwave ever again. I look forward to more air fryer recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out with a fluffy interior and crispy exterior.  The air fryer is perfect when you don't want to heat the whole oven.

Best baked potatoes ever! Super fluffy inside and crispy on the outside. I was a little concerned about not pricking the potato prior to cooking but did not need to be. They were perfect and did not explode!

I cook often in my air fryer but this was the first time "baking" potatoes in it! OMG they were delicious. I used bigger potatoes so cooked at 400 degrees for 75 minutes. The taste was so much better than baking in a regular oven. Even the skin was good.

The potato was just as good as from the oven without having to heat up the house for two potatoes!
