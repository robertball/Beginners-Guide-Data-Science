I made some changes, I also added a clove of garlic, chopped celery and helped the flavor along with chicken b. cubes.  added a bay leaf and chopped parsley.  Excellent.  I served it with grated Guyrere cheese and chopped green onion... Definitely excellent.  I omitted the potato flakes.

I had a perfect potato soup until I added the  potato flakes. Yes, they thickened the soup, but the resulting texture was horrible.

We are real "soup people" and this recipe will definately grace the table again!
I added some silced button mushrooms instead of the corn, and also about 1/2 cup of grated parmesan to give it a little extra zing. The whole family really enjoyed it. Thank You!

This has got to be the best potato soup I've ever had.  Even my granddaughter liked it and she hates everything.  Thick and full flavored, it won't let you down.

I have never liked potato soup, but I must say this variety is wonderful. My husband and I like to add a few different things to it sometimes, but it's great even if you leave it alone, although a little worcestershire sauce is good in it. We love to fix the Portuguese Fried Bread recipe that we found on this site. Nothing is better on a cold winter day.

My husband LOVED this soup.  I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches.  Even my kids liked it!  I did add just a dash of garlic for flavor.  It is a very hearty and fullfilling meal!

This just wasn't good at all. I think it would be better if you used real potatoes.

It is freezing here in Colorado and this sounded great. Had to cut the recipe in half due to lack of potatoes. It came out fabulous. Was short onion but strangely I had green onion and that worked well. Don't like corn in soup so omitted. Kids, picky teens, loved it. Thanks!

My husband, oldest daughter and I all enjoy this recipe.  We do not add the corn but the rest of the recipe is perfect for our taste.  This is the only potato soup I will make from now on.

Great soup recipe but I omitted the corn and potato flakes.  The soup thickens the next day and is even better than the first!

I thought the soup was really great, and then I added the potato flakes. Eh kind of killed the flavor. It was still good but it was better before I added it. My family really liked it I just couldn't get over the processed taste of the instant taters. Guess I'm not a fan of potato flakes. Didn't know that. I left out the corn because of personal preference.

This was quite bland.  I added garlic, but it definitely needs something more.

This is the best potato soup ever. My wife said it's the best she's had too. Better than my mom makes. It has a sweet taste I've never experienced in a soup before.

Very good...and to make it even quicker you can use 2 cans of sliced potatoes.  Next time a may try a little less potato flakes.  It was a hit with the family!

I don't care much for soups but even I like this one.  Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream and left out the potatoe flakes.  I didn't have any bacon but even without it the soup was heavenly.

It was great. Although I did decide to skip the potato flakes because I simply didn't have any. I also fried a third of the bacon for garnish, as well as add chives right before serving for the same reason. We used the corn and were not disappointed. Will definitely make again! :D

This is a great, filling soup! 
Instead of corn I used grated carrots and added my extra 'go to' seasonings that I use for everything. (Also, it helps to break down the potato flakes with a little warm milk before adding them to the soup.)
Served with homemade buttered rolls - perfect comfort food on a cold day!
