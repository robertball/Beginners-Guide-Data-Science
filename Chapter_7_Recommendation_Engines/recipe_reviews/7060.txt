I have been making these for many months and my 5 year old son loves them  - with a few changes.  I use the "sweet" white sorghum flour instead of the amaranth.  I use any kind of juice, add a banana and sometimes add chocolate chips for variety.  With just the sorghum flour change, these are very tasteful!  Thanks for the recipe.

These GF pancakes were easy to make & turned out really well!  I substituted corn starch for the arrowroot flour, and pineapple juice for the apple.  I also like the fact that they don't have added sugar!

This is a wonderful recipe and worth a try for those who are gluten intolerant. If you have problems with flatness i suggest beating 2 egg whites instead of using 1 egg white and yolk. This website has great info on how to beat egg white properly. Thank you for the recipe and please add more of them!

Another great alternative for those of us needing gluten free!  I tripled the recipe as it only makes 3 small pancakes.  Then, I put the others in ziplocks in the fridge for instant breakfast during the week.

Much to the dismay of my long suffering family I've tried many gluten free pancake recipes and store bought mixes...all of which have been disappointing.  This was the same.  The pancakes were flat and flavorless.  I do not reccomend using this recipe.

One of the better options. Based on my kitchen inventory, I used 1/4c+1t cornstarch in place of arrowroot and sorghum instead of amaranth. They are a little flat and best if eaten immediately. My 6 y.o. gave them two thumbs up.

This was perfect. We need to be wheat, dairy, egg, and soy free so I used one banana in place of the egg and used the sorghum flower like others suggested and added semi-sweet chocolate chips made by Enjoy Life which are allergen free. They were fluffy like regular pancakes so no one could tell the difference!

Really, really tasty! We have been using another GF pancake recipe, but ran out of the potato starch it called for. So we tried this recipe and the family LOVED them! We had to make a few substitutions for things we were out of, but turned out YUMMY! We used Sorghum flour instead of amaranth, cornstarch instead of arrowroot, and white grape juice for apple juice. We had to add 1 1/2 cups rice milk and 1/2 cup water, because it was too dry with just the juice. This is a keeper. THANKS for the flavorful recipe!

Tasted great but had a bit more of a chewy texture than I like in a pancake. I've had way fluffier gluten free pancakes so I wouldn't use this as my go to recipe but it's worth keeping in my collection

1/4 cup of juice and 1 egg left the batter thick enough to hold in my hand so I added milk to make it like pancake batter. Then it would never get solid as it cooked. I gave up on cooking it since it ended up very gelatinous.  Was I supposed to cook the pancakes with batter that was almost solid? Confused.

I donâ€™t normally care for amaranth flour, but I have some that needs used up. Thankfully, this recipe actually does an excellent job of blending flavors together to make a delicious amaranth pancake. I also replaced the egg with banana, and I added just a hint of ground cloves. I will definitely be making these again.
