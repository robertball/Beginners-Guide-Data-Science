I used apple sauce in place of about 1/2 of the butter  and added a bit of cinnamon.  Overall, I liked that this recipe required very few ingredients and the muffins tasted pretty good, even my picky 3 year old ate them.

Easy to make, very moist and tasty. Everyone guessed pumpkin and was surprised when I told them no. I roasted my butternut squash rather than steam it and I will add cinnamon to the mix next time. There will be a next time very soon considering the 20 muffins I made yesterday are gone already and I have a bumper crop of squash chilling in the root cellar waiting on me to figure out what besides soup to make of them.
