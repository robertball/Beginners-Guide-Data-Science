Wow--this was so good! I loved the salty vs. sweet combo, it was delicious. I followed the first reviewer's advice and cut the onions way down, but otherwise followed the recipe. Also took the suggestion of adding the pineapple juice to the broth. Edit: Oops, I forgot to get the kidney beans at the store and so I didn't get to use those in this recipe (posted pic), but next time I definately will remember! (: Thanks, Christain!

This is absolutely my new favorite chili recipe. I only made a few changes to suit our preferences. I halved the amount of meat (and used grnd turkey instead of beef), but left all the veggies at the full quantity except onions, of which I only used 2. I really cannot imagine, even if i had used 2lbs of meat, using 6 onions. Also, I didn't drain the pineapples, which were packed in juice. The light sweetness really helped to balance out the heat. I will make this again, for sure, and often.

I've never rated a recipe before officially serving it but I will give it 5 stars because hubby has been sneaking small bowls of it out of the crockpot all afternoon.  Fortunately there is enough left for dinner.  I had a little taste too and really like it.  I followed directions except reduced onions and omitted chili pepper and salt as I used pinto beans in chili sauce that is plenty spicy for us.  Finished it up in the crock pot because we like the onions and bell peppers pretty soft in our chili.  Also used crushed pineapple with the juice.  I think this is our new favorite chile.  Thanks.
UPDATE:  I've made this several times since I rated it the first time and we still love it.  Last night I maded it with no ground beef and it was still great.  I did double the amount of beans to take the place of the beef. Love it, love it, love it.

I made it with ground turkey and it was great! I really do like this chili! The one bad comment I have is...take the picture off the recipe...please! Everyone I have showed this too has commented on the pic negatively...I think it might turn people off from making it.

This recipie was a great started to what we added. Instead of chili powder, we used thai sweet red pepper sauce. We used the pinapple juice as mentioned before,added chopped eggplant and garlic. Then we served it over rice.

Loved it.  I cut this recipe in half and one large onion was ENOUGH.  I also  decided to take the previous reviewer's advice and add in the juice from the canned pineapple.  If I had served it immediately it would have been too watery, but I served it the next day and the texture was perfect.  This does make a spicy chili so the pineapple does take a bit of the edge off.  This is a keeper!  My guy loved it.

Thought this was very good. The only changes I made were using turkey burger instead of ground beef.

This just tasted like regular chili to me.  I could not taste the pineapple.  Maybe crushed pineapple would work better.  It did make a lot, as the recipe states.  I got more than 10 servings.

We have a large family and they all loved this recipe - some going back for third bowls.  I made it according to the recipe but followed one review's advice and used only 2 onions.

Very good recipe. 2nd's for everyone! I split the hamburger by half. The other half I used chili meat. Browned it with garlic powder. In place of chili powder I used "Fiesta" brand chili mix powder. It's made in San Antonio,Texas. 2 onions instead of 6 listed. For the slight zing with the sweetness I gave a heavy dash of "Tabasco"brand Habanero sauce. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I ended up finishing mine off in the slow cooker. I let it sit for a few hours and the pineapple really compliments the spice. I love this chili. Served with a nice King's Hawaiian dinner roll.

We love this recipe, we do add mushrooms as my husband and I love mushrooms. We also add a pack of Taco seasoning, chick peas, fresh garlic and fruit chutney. The pineapple in this recipe really adds so much flavour, almost like a sweet and sour combination.

I made this following the original recipe except that I used fire roasted tomatoes and a crockpot.  This meant that I had to brown the meat in a skillet before putting it in the pot to cook.

I made this last night for dinner. I made a few changes. I only used 2 onions. And since I accidently grabbed crushed oinaople instead of chunks, I used the crushed pineapple. I had hoped foe more of a oinaople taste which might happen with the chunks or tidbits. And I wanted the flavor a bit sweeter so I added a 1/4 cup brown sugar. I will make this again for sure!

Didn’t like this much. It was too bland. I added two jalapeños for spice and it did absolutely nothing for it. Needs more spice that’s for sure. It doesn’t even have to be spicy, just had absolutely no flavor. Too bland, too boring. Won’t be making it again.

I found this recipe and thought my wife would love it as she has a thing for pineapple.  I began making it, and realized I didn't follow the recipe the way they wanted.  So I browned the meat, added everything into a stock pot and immediately realized it was like a stew.  So I added two cans of tomato sauce, and a hatch chile  pepper.  The chili was good and we both thought it was unique and may try again, but for us not our best.

All we could taste was the pineapple.  Completely changed chili flavour.  Mix between sweet and sour and chili.

Aside from following other reviewer's advice and using two onions, I didn't change anything and it 's terrific.  Definitely a keeper for the cold rainy days.

I loved it. The only thing I will do different next time is add more chili powder, something to spice it up and use smaller crushed pineapple or something.

This was so good! Definitely a new favorite chili recipe. I adjusted it and just used 1.37lb ground beef and only 1 onion and 1 bell pepper but kept the beans, tomatoes and sauce the same.  I also used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple instead of pineapple chunks! So amazing! Love the salty/sweet combo! And adjusting it still made a huge crockpot full!
