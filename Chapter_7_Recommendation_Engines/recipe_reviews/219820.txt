This is my recipe and i would like to tell you what they changed. I had specific types of chocolate that really make the dish, and they generalized it. I use 60% cacao chips from Ghiradelli and Hersheys unsweetened cocoa powder. I also use real vanilla extract. not the cheap imitation kind, it makes a big difference. Sometimes i also like to mix in some brown sugar with the white. So please consider this when making the pudding. Thanks.

Yum-mm-mm...this is delicious.  A very simple but elegant finish to a meal.  I used Lindt 70% cocoa smooth dark chocolate and also added the optional cocoa powder, so one might say this is a dark chocolate overload.   I only had skim milk on hand, so I used 2-1/2 cups skim and 1/2 cup FF half-and-half.  Thanks Cheleypears, this is the best chocolate tapioca pudding I've ever had.

I used 1/2 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips instead of the chopped chocolate and also added the optional 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I tried it warm but it really was much better after it chilled.  Good but not as good as regular tapioca pudding in my opinion, even though I do like chocolate.

It has been a long time since I seen chocolate tapioca pudding. My wife says there is no such thing. Now I can prove her wrong, and make it so she can taste it for herself. Thanks.

I've been on a pudding kick lately, so this was next on my list of recipes to try. The flavor was 5 star,made exactly as written, with the optional cocoa powder and I added salt(always add salt to chocolate recipes! It really enhances the flavor!), but the ingredient proportions were way off for me. It was basically just chocolate pudding(a tasty one, I'll give it that), but there was not many tapioca "pearls" in it. Not what I thought it was going to be. This was my first time making quick-cooking tapioca, so maybe I'm just not used to that but when I try this recipe again, I'll either decrease the milk drastically or add at least a tablespoon or 2 more tapioca. Or I may just soak larger tapioca pearls then try this recipe. Thanks for the recipe! :) EDIT: I soaked 2 tablespoons of the quick-cooking tapioca in some water, heated it up, drained it well and added it to the pudding I made. It was much better! I still want to try this with some regular tapioca, I'm sure it would be beyond words!

I used skim milk and semi sweet chocolate chips.  I did not use any cocoa powder.  I blended sugar milk and egg in food processor.  I like tapioca pearls, so soaked 1/4 cup for 20 min or so and poured off excess water.  Came out perfect!

I may try it again with almond extract.

We enjoyed this pudding a lot.  A nice texture with the tapioca in it and plenty of chocolate flavour to tame even the worst "chocolate craving".  It's nice to make a pudding that doesn't come in a box!

I had never tried tapioca pudding and I liked it a lot. The consistency is like that of a chewy rice pudding, but creamier at the same time, if that makes any sense :) I added a bit more tapioca as another reviewer suggested and well, my pudding was rather thick. That was fine, and the flavor was wonderful. Next time I will add grated orange peel and orange flavoring as I believe that would make a wonderful pudding.

The best chocolate tapioca pudding I've ever had!!!! I used semi sweet chocolate chips because that's all I had in my pantry. If you're in the mood for chocolate this will definitely satisfy your craving and it was so easy!!!!

This was really good! Very chocolatey with the cocoa powder. We didn't end up with any left over to try it cold, so I will have to make a double batch next time. Thank you for the great recipe!

I found a 7 oz. box of large pearl tapioca in the cupboard yesterday and let it soak in 4 cups of water overnight. This morning I set out to find the best recipe and this is very good chocolate pudding! I used unsweetened/unflavored coconut milk to make it dairy-free, and a stevia blend in place of the sugar with good results. I'll be making this pudding again!

Perfect. I used Kirkland chocolate chips and ghiradelli cocoa. I did add a pinch of salt, because even desserts need it.

I have food intolerances, so I made a few substitutions. Used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, gluten free/dairy free dark chocolate chips, and Egg Beaters (yolk free) in place of a whole egg. Turned out divine. I've tried a half dozen recipes, but they all come out tasting like exactly what they are: a pudding substitute. This one actually tastes like the treat its supposed to be. So good! Will definitely be making this again!

I really enjoyed eating and baking the Tapioca pudding.  But when I was looking for the chocolate ingredient, the recipe was not very specific.  But overall, it was the best pudding I've EVER tasted!

Great recipe for when I am in the mood for some chocolate tapioca pudding, to switch it up from vanilla every once in a while. Very tasty. I wish I had seen the review from the original poster saying she uses specific chips and adds brown sugar for a portion of the white. I'll have to try that next time!

I made this recipe with the cocoa powder, soy milk, white chocolate, and slow-cooking tapioca. It turned out great! I just didn't add the majority of the ingredients until towards the end.
