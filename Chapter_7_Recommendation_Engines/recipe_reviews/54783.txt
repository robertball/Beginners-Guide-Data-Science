I really can't understand negative reviews on this recipe unless the directions were not followed. I found this to be an excellent recipe, and served it to two persons who are both excellent cooks. They loved it. This is the kind of recipe I come to allrecipes.com to find.

this is a great, imperceptible salad dressing, especially for salads that donâ€™t need much spicing up, but i would suggest using buttermilk instead of normal milk and adding some pepper. i would also replace the garlic salt with just normal garlic, or just use less garlic salt because of the dominant salty taste the garlic salt has. Instead of using water to make the dressing thinner, I would suggest just adding olive oil or more buttermilk to prevent the dressing having a bland taste. I also think putting the dressing in the fridge for 8 hours is not obligatory, though it probably tastes better if you do so. Tarragon would also go great with this salad dressing.

Too salty! Had to throw first batch out. Parm cheese is salty enough...do not add salt products. Add garlic powder or a clove of fresh instead of garlic salt.

I actually think this is one of the best salad dressings I have had in a long time and we ate it right away I did not let it set.  I also added parsley and pepper and I put a lot less lemon in.  I also added a dollop of sour cream.  Anyway it was yummy!  I will try this again and set it overnight not that this needs any improving at all!

I thought this was delicious. Right after I made it,it tasted just like creamy italian. After refrigerating for 12 hours it had a wonderfully unusual flavor...the lemon flavor came out alot more. My salad loving 21 month old daughter loved it too. It's hard to find good creamy salad dressings that don't have MSG...this one's a keeper.

This was ok but nothing spactacular. If you decide to make do not add garlic salt use real garlic or garlic powder instead. This was very salty. Maybe a little lemon would also be a good touch.

As suggested in the instructions, I substituted low-fat ingredients, including low-fat Parmesan cheese (not freshly grated though), 1% milk, and no-fat mayo.  In all fairness, let me be clear that my "2" rating is for the "low-fat" version.  The real McCoy may be wonderful, but the low-fat version is average, at best.  One reviewer said this tasted a bit like Caesar dressing.  I would agree with that.  I'm not an especially good fan of Caesar dressing either.  This recipe isn't horrible--just not one I would likely prepare again--unless I run out of other dressing, of course.

What a wonderful last minute dressing!  I had dinner all ready to go, my salad made, and I looked in the fridge and found no dressing I could eat on my new low-carb diet, lol.  I made this in about 1 min. and it was perfect.  Thank you!  I think I will begin using this recipe a lot more instead of buying pre-made dressing.

I've never been a salad fan, except for the occasional Ceasar salad.  But I've never been able to find a dressing that I liked enough to use at home.  Ceasar salads was something that I usually ate when I went out to eat.  But lately I've been eating nothing but salads with THIS dressing for about 3 days straight, every week!  I crave this dressing every week, and all these salads make me more, uhh, well, umm, you  know,..."regular". HA!  Thanks for sharing...

WONDERFUL!!!  Be sure to use FRESH parmesan.  I mixed a little horseradish mayonnaise in with the plain, which gave a a bit more zip. Great over a simple lettuce and tomato salad!!

I love home made salad dressings; they are quick, easy and taste so good!  So much better than store bought preservative-tasting dressings!  This was really flavorful.  I used garlic powder instead of salt because Parmesan cheese is so salty already.  Cut in half for just hubby and me.  Didn't have time to let it sit, but it was wonderful just the same!  Next time I will reduce the milk a bit, it was a little too runny for my preference.  But yum, yum, yum!  Thanks for sharing!

This was very easy to make and yummy.  I added some parsley and a little extra lemon juice and sugar.  Absolutely make sure you let this set up for a couple of hours or it will be very runny.

Now keep a jar in the fridge. I sometimes add sugar or pineapple juice to get the sweet freaks to eat salad. Good good stuff.

This is a great salad dressing.  It's not necessary to chill it before, though it is much better after it is chilled.  I add 1/2 cup sour cream and cut the milk down some because I like my dressing thicker.  I also add some black pepper and cilantro.  It's fantastic and very easy.

I've been using this recipe for a couple years now, and it's my family's favorite salad dressing.  I use key limes instead of lemon, and garlic instead of garlic salt.  Sometimes I substitute  dill for the garlic.  Cheaper and tastier than most bottled dressings.  For a dip, I substitute sour cream or plain yogurt for the milk.

I thought this was very good and my husband thought it was delicious. I used half&half instead of milk and just a squirt of light mayonnaise. I think it would be better with milk (or half&half) and sour cream. Thanks for a quick and easy dressing recipe!

This recipes was delicious and soooo easy.  Everyone has these ingredients on hand!  My fiance helped himself to 2 helpings of salad the other night, which NEVER happens, just because he wanted more dressing.  It tastes like a creamy parmesan caesar - yum!

I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT I used garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt.  It's a very good creamy dressing, comparable to what I've had as "Ceasar Dressing" in restaurants.  I'm keeping it!

I gave this 4 stars because i made a few changes... Used 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 light sour cream in place of the mayo.  I also cut back on the salt as the parmesan is pretty salty on it's own.. I also added some fresh cracked black pepper... Yummy!!!

Great! I wasn't expecting it to be any good, but have been craving a creamy dressing. Used fresh garlic instead of powder, and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, with a dash of olive oil and pepper for extra flavor. A little thin but very tasty, like a super super simple Ceaser dressing! I love that there are so many options for adjustment and experimentation. Have plans to try adding anchovies to make it more Ceaser-y, or maybe olives and feta for a greek style, and there are so many possibilities. A great, simple dressing by itself, or open to so many other ideas.

I made this not 5 minutes ago and it's amazing!  Used low fat mayo, 1% milk, half the amount of garlic powder instead of garlic salt, then added salt and pepper to taste.  The finishing touch was about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I agree with other reviewers who said it tastes similar to caesar dressing, which is my favorite.  We're having friends over for dinner tomorrow and I hope they like the dressing, too!

I did a half-batch and I went for the low-fat version of this dressing: I did half low-fat mayo and half regular mayo, and I used fat-free milk. I used the Kraft parmesan cheese (yeah, the cheap stuff you sprinkle on your spaghetti :) and I used bottled ReaLemon. I used garlic powder as advised by previous reviewers. I also added a few good shakes of pepper and a few shakes of salt (it needed SOME salt, although using garlic salt would have been too much). I added a little extra lemon juice, PLUS I added a little bit of worcestershire sauce. Not much, maybe 1/4 of a teaspon at most (probably less). I think it added to it nicely without overpowering the other ingredients. Next time, though, I won't use low-fat ingredients or pre-grated cheese. Thanks, BRIAMF, it's pretty yummy!

This was fairly tart made as written. I would recommend juicing half the amount of lemon and adding it to taste. As the size of a lemon can vary widely, the recipe might have been better served written with a volume amount rather than the vague "1.5 lemons". I also did not need to add any milk as it was quite runny to begin with. I suspected it would be quite salty with the garlic salt called for, so I went with a sodium free garlic herb seasoning blend instead which turned out to be a good call.

One of the best homemade salad dressings ever!  Tastes like a very mild Caesar and consists of ingredients that are readily on hand.  Will make this even if there is store-bought dressing in the fridge.

I cut the recipe way down and guesstimated amounts. I also took the unforgivable step of using the "green bottle" Parmesan (not enough of the real stuff), and this was still awesome. Thank you.

Love this dressing...we make it over and over.  Watch the garlic salt as the recipe seems to call for alot.  We use garlic powder and shake in a bit of salt to taste.

My God, this is good.  I was forlorn -- no salad dressing, no sour cream, no buttermilk.  But I did have mayo and lemons!  And fresh dill, which I added, and it tasted super delicious!  Thanks.

I enjoyed this as an alternative to th ones in the frig.  I loved it and the simplicity.  I scaled it down to four servings and only used a capful of lemon juice after reading other suggestions.  I will make it again.  I also only let it sit about an hour.  There was some left so I will try it for lunch again today.

This is the perfect salad dressing, I used it for basic salads and for ceasar's salad and my son told me that it was the best ceasar's salad he ate. To cut out calories I used low fat mayonaise, skimmed milk and didn't use parmesan cheese as I didn't have any on hand, but still it was great. Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe.

This salad dressing is good and easy! I put it on my parent's 43rd wedding anniversary salad, served with grilled shrimp, & artichoke pie. Because of this awesome meal, they will probably be married another 43 years... so you know, that's all I'm saying...

I made about half this recipe and put in sour cream instead of mayo...then realized I should have put in mayo. So I added the mayo and a little more milk. I also added some salt and pepper. It was delicious. Plus the opaque color covered up some of the really random ingredients in my "whatever's leftover in the fridge" salad - which included lettuce, tomato, corn, kidney beans, avocado, scallion, cheddar cheese and croutons. No complaints - even from the onion haters!

WOW! thank you so much for posting this recipe! late this evening i realized i had run out of the "usual" ingredients which are used for many of my salad dressings (even the "staples" like balsamic and olive o.) and really wanted a salad! put in a search on allrecipes and found yours. how wonderful this is! i used garlic powder (don't buy garlic salt) and replaced the milk with buttermilk.  great stuff and will also use it on a wrap for lunch. dinah

this is amazing. it tastes like the dressing they use to make prawn coctail at restaurants. i only refrigerated this for 3 hours (just in time for lunch) and made it exactly as stated. may use a little less lemon juice next time, but again, this was fab. thanks loads for sharing! now i need never buy italian/salad dressing again!

This turned out great! i took others' advice and added a clove of garlic, minced finely along with some ground black pepper and a few dried parsley flakes. it kinda reminded  me of the base for the ranch dressing i use i make of outback steakhouse's recipe on topsecretrecipes.com. also didn't have parm. used pecorino. didn't really remind me of caesar as someone else suggested; was very creamy & mild. def a keeper!

Fantastic! It tastes like a cross between caesar and ranch dressing. Like other comments, reduce the milk by half for a creamier dressing. Add some cilantro, pepper, and a splash of chile powder for an extra kick!

Unlike other reviewers I found this dressing to have little taste. I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt. To make it taste better I added the prepackaged fresh bacon bits and more mayo. It became a thicker consistency and started to taste like something. Probably wouldn't make again though.

I've been making this for years with the addition of about 2 Tbls of olive oil.  It is known as creamy ceasar dressing.  Anchovies are optional. Add your romaine and croutons and bingo, ceasar salad!   Yes, everyone loves this!

When made as is, I think the flavor is a bit strong and is overall too thick, it was hard to stir into my salad. Still, I feel it was a good start, and with a few modifications could be a great creamy Caesar dressing.

FANTASTIC!!!! Easy, quick, ingredients usually found anywhere at home - works perfectly to every kind of salad! --- Though, instead of garlic salt (I don't really love garlic) I used "herbs salt" ---- tried it with blue cheese and worked too! *****5 stars to the original*****

Loved it! Didn't have lemon juice so just squeezed lemon concentrate to taste, worked great. Don't make if you don't like garlic though.

This was fantastic!  Reminds me of the Creamy Parmesan dressing at one of our favorite restaurants!  Added garlic powder & fresh ground pepper...terrific!

I made this recipe exactly as written, with only one small change. I didn't have enough Parmesan, so used a mix of Parm and Pecarino Ramano cheeses. I have to agree with some of the previous reviewers that garlic salt makes the dressing a bit too salty (and I am a big salt lover). Next time I wouuld use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Otherwise, a very easy and tasty dressing.

I've been looking for a simple salad dressing and this is it. This may not be the most helpful review as I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but rather, made a small portion for a single serving. Just looking and finding that I had everything on hand was great, and this is a great base to experiment with adding or substituting other ingredients.

I loved this! I will never buy caesar dressing again. I just used the ingredients without really measuring and made an individual salad. I squeezed 1/2 lemon and used the zest, and used a splash of milk. I'll be making up a big batch and storing it. Great with romaine!

Made this for company twice.  Raves everytime.  Served it over a simple sald of lettuce, cucumber slices, red onion, and grape tomatoes.  Now, when I have company, everyone expects it.

I found this after I searched the fridge in vain trying to find our ranch dressing and then realized all the stores in our town were closed. (My husband wanted a salad at 10:00.) Anyway, I made this really quick (and I mean quick). I kind of tweaked the ingredients. I didn't use lemons or Parmesan. Instead, I made it with Miracle Whip, garlic powder, and milk. My husband loved it! He even said it was better than ranch! Word of advice though, this dressing is potent. A little covers a lot! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make again.

Yum!  Just made it but made a few alterations.  Cut back on 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup feta, fresh chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste.  Poured it right on Romain hearts with crumbled bacon and sliced hard boiled egg.  It was delicious!  I'm sure this could be tinkered to be a little less high cal...but a nice indulgence for the summer.

Great Recipe! Simple, quick, and made from ingredients you usually have in your fridge. I was looking for something similar to a Caesar Dressing, but did not find a simple recipe which was convincing enough. So I turned to this one, and it was exactly what I had been looking for. I followed the instructions and ingredients exactly, and it turned out just fine for my taste.  Maybe next time, I will try adding 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste, I think this might give the taste a little kick.

I was literally out of salad dressing, and in a pinch, found this recipe.  Did not refrigerate for the 8 hours, and used immediately.  Initially, I did not care for it and thought would not make again.  However, the next day, this dressing tasted much better.

I was out of ranch and any creamy style dressing... tried this instead. We loved it! My husband just kept raving about how great it was! We've had it for a week and it's still amazing! My borther loved it as well! Will definitely make again!

I found it wonderfull.  I only made halph b/c I read all reviews, but halph was all I needed cooking for two.  I added halph lemon and halph lime juice, I also added halph mayo and halph miracle whip.  I did add one tsp of garlic salt, and one garlic clove.  Dash of pepper.  It was not too salty.  I will definatly make it again.

Very good dressing, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and after reading the reviews I am glad I did, I figured it would be to salty. I added 1 teaspoon of salt.  I also used fat free milk because that is what we drink and what I had on hand. I let it sit all night and had it on my salad the next day, it was very good. The next time I will make a smaller batch because my husband does not like a ranch type salad dressing

Ease of recipe = FIVE stars!  Taste of recipe = FOUR stars!  I wish I could give this recipe a four and a half stars! Talk about life saver! Husband and I were making salads for dinner, only to find out we didn't have any dressing! DOH! This was easy, delicious, and satisfying! The lemon was great at cutting the richness that the mayo and parm added. Followed recipe to the letter EXCEPT used already grated parm from Costco. DELISH!

Excellent base for a creamy dressing.  You can add any kind of herbs/spice to this and make it your own.  I loved it.  I rarely buy dressing as it is, and I probably never will now that I have a recipe to work with.

Excellent Recipe - Used 1 tsp. Salt 1 tsp. Garlic Powder and added some dried chives and parsley.  This is the first salad dressing i've made that was actually pourable - my husband who is an oil and vinegar man tried it and now he uses it all the time.  Definitely a keeper and hit!! Thanks :-)

Put all the ingredients in b/4 you add the milk and add slowly until you get the desired consistency.  The original proportions ended up with a dressing is runnier than I prefer.  I didn't fresh lemons so used about some of that "lemon concentrate" we all have sitting in the fridge.  I also added onion powder and garlic salt for a bit of flavor.  I used it right away--what's the point of "out of dressing" salad dressing if you have to wait overnight :)  Otherwise, this is a great recipe!

Didn't have fresh lemons but used reconstituted lemon juice, used adobo instead of garlic salt, threw in some fresh chopped chives, used fresh cracked  black peppercorns worked great for my low carb diet. Is is delish!!

This is an easy recipe when looking for a creamy, yummy dressing!  I made a batch, ate it right away, and then stored it in the fridge overnight.  Today I added it to salad during lunch and the flavor was even richer.  This recipes gets 5 stars for being simple and delicious.

I have been making this dressings for a long time, in facts my kids like it better than any bottled stuff.  My version is:  1cup mayo, 1 freshly squeed lemon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 clove of pressed fresh garlic.  Mix well, chill while you prepare the rest of your meal.  Toss and serve.

I swear this is the base for ranch dressing, and I love me some ranch! I substituted the milk with buttermilk and used a couple of cloves of real garlic. I also seasoned with salt and pepper then added about 1/4c of sour cream. Turned out pretty much like ranch dressing from a restaurant. Can't get that deliciousness out of a bottle! Think I'll be making my ranch dressing from here on out instead of trying to find that restaurant style

Took this to a friend's BBQ with a fresh green salad mix and it got rave reviews.  They even kept the leftovers.  The only change was to use a pressed garlic clove instead of the garlic salt, and I added just a little freshly ground pepper.  The flavor blend deepened wonderfully even after sitting only 2 hours.  Delicious keeper!

This was the first homemade salad dressing I have made. It turned out very good. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I didn't have freshly grated cheese, so I used  the dry parmesan I had on hand. I added some ground pepper and it was good to go. thanks

I made this recipe the other day and it was great.  Reason: I didn't have garlic salt.  I used powdered garlic and then salted to taste.  I just made this recipe WITH garlic salt and it was way too salty and I had to through it out.  What a waste.  I had to give this one star if made per the recipe.

I used 1 whole lemon, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 1 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 cup light mayonnaise and 1/2 cup lowfat buttermilk. I also added a dash of pepper. I put it in a blender to combine the ingredients. This is basically for 8 servings @ 2 tablespoons per serving. 67 calories, 4 carbs, 5 grams fat, 3 protein per serving. Excellent combination of flavors. I like the "tang" that the lemon juice provides.

LOVE this dressing made from scratch and home-made is always better than store-bought anyway.  You can easily modify this to your taste or available ingredients by substituting lime for lemon juice (as someone suggested), Romano for Parm cheese, Miracle Whip for mayo, etc.  I would add a few grinds of black pepper and maybe some fresh or dried herbs to vary it.

All the ingredients of something tasty, but I think the flavor depends a lot on the type or brand of mayonnaise you use.

Wow this is really yummy! I used low fat buttermilk instead of milk, fresh garlic and low fat mayo because of a restricted diet I am on. Yummo!  I think next time I will only add 1/4 c. parm. cheese to cut back the fat a bit more. De-lish!

I thought this recipe was great - we didn't have fresh parmesan so I had to use pregrated and mix it with the dressing in a blender - next time I'll use freshly grated, I'm sure it will be even better.

This was pretty fast and easy.  But the best thing about this recipe was the flavour.  Amazing!  I used lemon juice in a bottle and garlic from a can, but it still turned out wonderful.  I can only imagine what the real thing would taste like.

Delicious and simple! I subbed lemon juice from a bottle for the juiced lemons (all about what you have on hand, right?) and did half garlic salt, half garlic powder to avoid the over saltiness people were warning of. LOVE this recipe and will be using it again and again! (And it is very easy to make it light/low cal/low fat!)

A bit too salty with Parmesan, mayonnaise and 2 ts of salt, had to doctor it far from original to get a  smooth blended flavor...  By the way, you had no time to thaw the yucky bottle salad dressing and invented a recipe that takes overnight to get ready...  absolutely puzzling!!!

Great recipe to use when you don't have time to run to the store to buy more dressing!!  I didn't follow the measurements exactly, and used a lot less milk. This is a good base recipe to change amounts to suit your own tastes.

I made this dressing this morning for my hubby and after lunch he called me saying his office mates asked him to make it again. my hubby likes it very much. I made changes to the original given ingredients - I doubled the volume of parmesan and milk, I dont have garlic salt to what I used 1 glove of fresh garlic and mashed it then I added pinch of salt and pepper to taste. then I added sliced boiled on and left over pork chops sliced it and  make it as topping then im not satisfied yet I slice few leaves of green onion and it came out fantastic!!! I will make this again. thanks for posting. I attached the photo too for you to see :)

I don't usually keep bottled salad dressing on hand, so I'm always glad to find a dressing that I can adjust to the amount I need. Didn't really measure as I was making this, but probably used more lemon juice and only added a very small amount of milk.  The other changes I made were to add some white sugar and freshly ground black pepper.

Great in a pinch!  I'm on a diet and used low fat ingredients, and it was still delicious... even my non-dieting boyfriend loved it.  I added a little pepper, and halved the mayo, using sour cream for the other half since I was low on mayo.  I don't know how it tastes using only mayo, but the way I did it was tasty!!!

very good. I used minced garlic (that comes in the little jars) instead of the garlic salt and I used lemon juice instead of fresh lemon. But worked great in a pinch. Will use again!

This is a great simple mayonnaise dressing for those times when you are out of dressing.  Overall it was a perfect base for what I needed last night.  I recommend adding the garlic & salt separately.  I also added vinegar, coarse black pepper, onion powder & cumin. I kept tasting my dressing until I got it right.

This was so easy to throw together and is so tasty that I will make it again. I used half garlic powder and half celery salt just to introduce a little salt. I also added pepper based on other reviews. The key is to use a good cheese.

Well since I was out of dressing the title grabbed me. This took literally a minute to stir up. I used bottled parmesan and bottled lemon juice, garlic and salt instead of garlic salt. It was a nice creamy dressing with a fresh taste to perk up a salad. Fresh lemon and zest would have made it better but considering how little I had to start with I was really pleased.

Hands down best dressing ever! I could use this on everything. It is so fresh. I made it as recipe dictated with the exception of the parmesan. I didn't have fresh, but still delicious.

This is a great starter recipe  to give you the feel for a basic salad dressing. You can build on it if you have an eye for sauces. I was out of salad dressing and had never made my own, but I'm a fairly competent saucier at home, so I modified the recipe thus (measurements are approximate): 2 tbsp mayo, 2 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp Worcestershire, 1 tbsp shredded cheddar/jack cheese, dollop of ketchup, 1 oz half-and-half,  bit of diced onion, 1 clove garlic finely chopped, some Jane's Mixed-Up Salt to taste, and a sprinkle of black pepper. These were all things I had on hand. I stirred the whole thing over low heat until the cheese melted, then set it in the fridge for 2 hours to let the flavors meld. In the end it felt like it could use a slight kick so I added the tiniest sprinkle of Creole seasoning. End result was FANTASTIC.

This is wonderful!! I did make a few changes as I usually do no offense!I finely chopped about 1/4 cup onion added about a 1/2 cup sour cream to cut the mayo taste an to we prefer our dressing a bit thicker. also added about 1/4 tsp of Italian seasoning. This dressing is Delicious as written you can really make it your own! Its a great base recipe!!

The garlic salt was a little overpowering so I would decrease it next time.

This was just ok in a pinch.  I thought it was too sour (too much lemon juice) and waaaay too salty.  Oh and it was also too thin and watery.  I probably won't make it again.  My daughter and I thought it tasted a lot like Caesar dressing and that wasn't the taste I was going for.  I was hoping it would be more like a creamy garlic dressing.

Just made this tonight and enjoyed it very much. I did make a few adjustments to suit my own tastes. I used the juice of just one lemon instead of one and a half. I used two teaspoons of minced garlic and one teaspoon of garlic powder. I added a few pinches of fresh ground pepper and a few dashes of cayenne pepper for a hint of heat. I didn't have the time to let it sit, but it was still very tasty. I stored the leftover and will use with another salad tomorrow.

I also sometimes use instead of the milk some red wine or balsamic vinegar.  Crush up a little dried oregano as well...great variations.  Good and tangy!

I don't like things too salty so I changed the garlic salt to 1 tsp and added a little garlic powder. It was great.  My wife had me separate some for her and add dill weed. Her's was great too.

For this recipe I used fresh garlic and parmesan from the spaghetti shaker. I just split everything in half for a smaller serving. On accident I forgot to add the milk, but it still turned out great and everyone loved it! I'll probably use this from now on because all the ingredients are simple and already in the fridge.

I was so skeptical when I read this, but had all the ingredients on hand so gave it a try. Fantastic! It is now my go-to recipe for salad dressing. I usually add whatever fresh herbs I have on hand (dill, parsley, cilantro, etc). Love this recipe.

Very good. I didn't add the milk (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) and it was still good.
