Very Good! The only change I made was to use standard breadcrumbs since that's what I had on hand. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the dipping sauce. A sweet meal so be sure to pair it with appropriate side dishes to balance. We had basmati rice and a cucumber & tomato salad.

Loved the idea but way too much coconut and the coating stayed soggy due to the yogurt--the kids scraped off all the coating.  Will make again but plan to decrease the coconut to 1/2 cup (3:1 panko to coconut ratio), coat the chicken in egg instead of yogurt, and add a bit of salt to the panko.  My husband and I liked the yogurt dipping sauce but the kids not so much--they could eat without or come up with another sweet/savory sauce.

This was soooooo delicious! I had stuffing on hand so I used the food processor to grind it up. I also added pineapple to the liquid mixture that you dredge the chicken through. I made two different chx recipes from the site at the same time. They were both good but this one got the thumbs up from my husband!

I really enjoyed this. I used 1 chicken breast and pounded it to about an inch thick dipped it in egg(per user review) and coated it in the panko coconut mixture. I used the baking method and it came out perfect! I didn't use the sauce however I have a sauce I use for coconut shrimp (I had those ingred. on hand) its just orange marmalade dijion mustard and honey. Thanks for the recipe!

Hubby loved this - I loved the chicken but not so much the sauce. I will admit to not measuring the amount of Panko and coconut....this is how I cook.... don't crowd the chicken - for the edges to get crispy they need some room. I served this with Apple Jicama coleslaw from this site and some grilled peppers and pineapple.

Wonderfully juicy and healthy!! I can't even begin to tell you how many coconut chicken recipes have tried and this one is by far my favorite! It's easy I have most of the ingredients around the kitchen and it can be pre-made and go into the fridge before putting it in the oven. A few slight changes- I added garlic powder ginger powder and chili powder to the yogurt mixture to give it a little kick. The yogurt keeps the chicken SO moist you actually think your chicken is undercooked because it's so juicy! I even used Gluten Free Panko crumbs and it still turned out crispy and amazing. I paired this with brown rice cooked in light coconut milk and stir fried green beans with fresh garlic and fresh ginger drizzled with honey. What an easy weeknight meal for me and the hubby. Thanks for the great recipe!

didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream in place of it. Let me say this is one of our new favorites! Both the kids and I LOVED this! It is easy to make and I will be making it again and again!!!

Great recipe very easy and quick. I made some of my chicken with the yogurt sauce as directed and some with a mixture of honey orange marmalade crushed pineapple the almond extract red pepper flakes and egg due to my husband's no dairy diet. I also used that mixture (minus the egg) for his dipping sauce. I also didn't follow the cooking directions. I cooked mine at 400 for about 9 minutes then flipped for another 9 to 12 minutes the coating came out toasty. My son loved the yogurt sauce but didn't really eat much of the chicken. I served this recipe with homemade sweet potato fries and fresh cut green beans.

I like the dipping sauce and how the yogurt made the chicken moist despite the time taken to bake them. However taste wise I think it is alright. Probably not something I will make again but I enjoyed trying this out though.

Made as written (scaled down for 2 people) and it was a hit with my husband. He used both "awesome" and "keeper". He esp loved the dip. That being said it should be noted that he has a very large sweet tooth so this may not be for everyone!

Delicious! The husband loved it as he is a coconut freak! Dipping sauce was really yummy. It's basically a different take on your basic breadcrumb fried chicken strips. Super easy and something with a different taste!

I followed the recipe exactly. The reviews looked good and so I expected to enjoy it. We just didn't like it. So many people who reviewed this recipe said it was sweet but we found it to be very bland. I definitely won't be making this one again.

I thought 3 cups was too much for this recipe. I used Greek yogurt and unseasoned panko it did taste bland and too soggy to eat. Won't be making again.

pretty easy and accurate.  I substituted crushed Rice Krispies for the panko due to the quarantine and I have celiacs so this helped make it 100 percent gluten free.
My family loved it!

I found the pineapple and marmalade a bit too sweet in this recipe - also it was very hard to make sure the chicken was properly cooked without the coconut burning and the coconut ended up becoming quite black and unattractive.
