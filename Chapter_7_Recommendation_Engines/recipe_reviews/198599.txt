An incredibly delicious way to jazz up the typical BLT. I followed the recipe to a T and it was superb.

I had a little bit of a hard time getting the batter to fry well on the bacon...but overall a tasty sandwich!

This was just incredible!  I made each sandwich by microwaving a tortilla, covered with very small sprinkling of shredded cheese, for about 30 seconds.  Then I spread a fine smear of the aioli over the melted cheese, topped it with romaine lettuce and slivered tomatoes and used about 2 pieces of the fried bacon (brought a tear to my husband's eye when he saw me frying it!!!) and rolled each one up.  PERFECT!
