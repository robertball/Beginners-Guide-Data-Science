This cake tastes wonderful and is really easy.  The instructions are written a little confusing, I think.  You need to mix the cake mix batter as written on the instruction box and then add the pudding.  It sounded to me like you add the yellow cake mix powder to the pudding.  I figured it out when the mass looked strange  :-)  Good cake!

I've made this cake many times.  I got the recipe from The Cake Mix Doctor, but my recipe does not use non-instant pudding.  Mine actually uses the instant pudding and it is always a moist delicious dessert.  This is more of a brownie than a cake.  I noticed one user made the cake according to the box and that is not correct.  For this recipe you must mix the dry cake mix with the pudding.  Strange, but it will come out yummy.

I made this exactly as the recipe states.  This was delicious.  It was even better after being refrigerated.

This is my 21-year-old son's enduring favorite. He requests it for almost any occasion...even tailgating for college football games! I too got the recipe originally from the Cake Doctor's cookbook, and the only changes I've made from this recipe are using instant vanilla pudding and adding whatever chips I have on hand - chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter...it's all good! Oh, and I use pecans most of the time.

This is a delicious sweet brownie-type dessert!  Anyone who can't make this one right did not follow the directions.  COOK the pudding on the stove and then add the box of cake mix.  I don't like walnuts so I used two different ingredients:  toffee pieces and crushed Frosted Flakes.  YUMMY!

This is a tasty cake.  I made a chocolate version.  I made it on a whim because I had the ingredients (or so I thought) but I was confused by the pudding.  I had a regular box of pudding (3.4 oz).  I didn't have a large box to check the size and I wasn't sure if the size was a typo or if it called for a large box.  Well now that I've checked the large box at the store, it calls for a LARGE BOX OF PUDDING!  It actually tastes great with the smaller box too.  It comes out a with at cake-like texture instead of a brownie-like texture and the chips and nuts sit on top instead of sinking in.  Next time I try it, I'll use the right size box of pudding.

I made this cake with only the exception of using white chocolate/chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips. It was a hit and the cake was eaten with in a day. I will make this again and again!

5 stars for ease, alone, but tastes yummy also!  The first time I made this, the chips didn't melt as much, but the 2nd time was the charm - I let pudding cool a little longer and it seemed to make all the difference with cake consistency and the melty topping.  This dessert is so very moist that it still tastes just as fresh days later.  It keeps very well, and I didn't refrigerate.

Simple to make, but I thought this was far too sugary and heavy.  Smells awesome.  Cake was so thick and sweet, but you really need to add in the pudding to make it thick enough to keep the chips and nuts from sinking.  If I were to make this again, I would probably use instant sugar-free pudding (that was let to sit for a couple minutes after beating to thicken) and I would try to get away with adding 3/4 of it to the cake mix.  I would definitely only use 1 cup butterscotch chips since this was the most sugary part.  Walnuts were great!  Probably won't make this one again though.  Sorry!

The recipe was really easy to make, but we were totally unhappy with the results.  The nuts didn't sink in, while the butterscotch chips sank all the way to the bottom and turned it into a thick gooey mess.  Next time I want something with butterscotch I'll stick to cookies.

I agree with others, this recipe works as long as you follow it. The batter seemed thick, but it turned out awesome.  Got rave reviews.  The only alteration I made was witholding the nuts and putting more chips on top.

Really good cake, super easy recipe. I used instant vanilla pudding so there isn't the need to let pudding cool before adding the cake mix. Be sure and chop your walnuts is using walnut halves and to cover the entire top with butterscotch and walnuts.

I just made this cake and I am wondering if the pan size is correct. If it is supposed to be a bar type cake, the addition of the pudding mix really fills the cake pan. I did not get the sinking effect at all?

I have made this recipe three times and now it is my favorite cake. It is so moist, chewy and rich. You'll love it! Be careful not to over bake though, or it will dry out.

This was surprisingly easy and very yummy. My sister in law melted a layer of sweet chocolate and then the chips.
So very moist.

i THOUGHT i had a yellow cake mix but didn't so i proceeded to make this with a homemade yellow cake recipe.  i don't know the amount of sugar used in a boxed mix but my recipe called for 21/2 cups sugar. will cut that down to 2 next time.  this was quite sweet, however, quite good.  i prefer the french vanilla pudding and yes, i used instant with no problems.

The directions are unclear, I followed directions cooked the pudding and put it into the cake mix like instructed then realized that was a mistake, put the butterscotch chips and walnuts on it anyway and crossed my fingers. It surprisingly turned out. Everyone said it was great however I didn't think the same. Maybe I will try again however I was not impressed.

You guys are gonna think I'm nuts. Made this with 5.1 oz of instant pudding. I made pudding according to instructions except I didn't chill it. Added dry cake mix. Realized I couldn't stir it enough so I put the batter into my mixer. Didn't feel like it had enough moisture so I added an egg. Then baked it for 50min at 350. I was using a thick stone dish so I think that added time. Toothpick inserted not that likely to come out dry since the inside has the consistency of pie kinda. Anyway the pecan and butterscotch I used were ideal. ALTHOUGH I ONLY USED 1 cup butterscotch. 2 would have been waaaay too sweet for me. Interesting recipe that I will defiantly make again!

Followed the directions exactly, and baked it for 35 minutes in my pampered chef 9x13 pan.  I did let the pudding cool for at least 25 minutes, as suggested in another review, and it was delicious!  Everyone loved it!  We renamed it Butternut Scotch Cake.  We will be making this again and again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a huge hit for me.  I left the nuts off half it for the non-nut lovers and it was still a big hit.  Was gone very fast.  Super easy to make.

I substituted pecans for walnuts since that is what I had in my pantry, and it worked great!  The consistency was like cakey brownies (not chewy).  Couldn't ask for an easier recipe!  Gotta come up with a more appealing name, though...
