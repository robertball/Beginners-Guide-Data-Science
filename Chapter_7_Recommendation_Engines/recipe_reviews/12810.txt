Muy delicioso!  Whenever we serve this, our friends ask for the recipe.  We modified it a bit by increasing the following;  16 ounces of cheese, 3 cans of crab meat, 1 1/2 lbs. of shrimp, and adding: 1/2 can green chiles, 1 small can chopped black olives.  We mix the 1/2 of the cheese along with the crab, shrimp, chiles and olives for the filling.  Wonderful tasting!!

I added bay scallops to the seafood & I did saute them all in olive oil w/ garlic & onions as suggested by many reviewers. I also added a tsp. of cumin to the seafood mix & loved the flavor it added...I think next time I might add another teaspoon. The green enchilada sauce MADE this recipe...I can't imagine it w/ red. After baking the second time, I topped the enchiladas off w/ a bit of mexican blend cheeses & stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to add visual appeal. Then I topped each enchilada w/ a tbp sized dollop of sour cream (they really don't need any more than that) & sprinkled them w/ fresh, chopped cilantro. These were really, really good but I think white corn tortillas would make a better wrap for them. They'd hold up better to cooking under the sauce. Served them w/ watermelon margaritas, a southwestern blend of mixed veggies (corn, black beans, onions, poblanos etc), chips & hot sauce & sopapillas for dessert. Fantastic dinner...thanks Lisa!

This was an excellent dish.  I used 8 oz. imitation crabmeat and 4 oz. baby shrimp.  I mixed in a little fat free sour cream, a diced tomato and some of the green onions as well as a jack/cheddar mexican cheese mix and it tasted wonderful.  One of the easiest dishes and it got rave reviews!!! I will make it again and again.  Thank you Lisa!

This was delicious.  Followed previous advice and chopped the shrimp and added cream cheese. I also used two cans of enchilada sauce. I put a small amount on the bottom of the pan which helped keep the enchiladas from sticking and I poured a spoonful over the crab/shrimp mixture before rolling. The results were wonderful.
 FYI: The mixture nicely filled ten flour tortillas, had I used all twelve they would not have fit in the suggested pan.

This was pretty good but not great.  I can of crabmeat is definitely not enough.  I hate to say it but I think using the fake crabmeat would work better because it is in large pieces.  I couldn't find green enchilada sauce and used red.  I also mixed in the green onions w/the shrimp, crab and cheese.  My fiance is not a seafood fan but I am.  He said this was a little below average.

these were so awesome!! I can't believe how good these tasted with such a simple recipe. The end result was a little mushy though, I think next time I'll add the enchilada sauce a little later, probably after baking the enchiladas for ten or fifteen minutes first and making the outsides a little crispy so that they wont soak in as much of the sauce. Other than that, these were great and I will definately make them again!

Very big hit!  Saute the shrimp with olive oil, garlic and onions first to give them more flavor, medium green enchilada sauce was a little mild, might use hot next time.

This was fantastic, and so easy to make.  The hardest part was finding the green chili sauce.  But it was well worth the hunt!  I added sauteed onion, garlic, chopped green and red peppers to the shrimp and crab mix.  I can't wait to make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I could not find the green enchilada sauce so had to use red but it was still delicious.

This was a good recipe.  I chopped the shrimp into small pieces (i didn't use as much as was called for), and I used extra crab.  I sauteed them in olive oil with a little seasoning, then mixed the crab and shrimp with a little cream cheese.  I also used white corn tortillas to eliminate the soggy issue others had by using the flour ones.  I layered the mixture on top of each tortilla and added the cheese, and rolled as per the directions.  I also poured a little sauce on the bottom of the dish, so they wouldn't stick.  I didn't want my enchiladas to be 'swimming' in the sauce, so I poured just enough to cover them.  Covered and baked them as per instructed.  With these changes, they came out superb!!  I will definetly make these again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I had a hard time finding the green enchilada sauce, but the results were worth the search.  Even my 5-year old picky daughter enjoyed this.  Will definitely make again.  I used the imitation crab and precooked shrimp and will do so again.

Success!!! Change ups, replaced canned crab with "sea legs", chopped the shrimp and added a can of diced green chilis.  Here we go... Mixed chopped sealegs, chopped shrimp, a few green onions(chopped), some of the cheese and 1/2 can of the chilis. Divide onto tortilas. Put into greased pan. Mix enchilada sauce, 1 C sour cream and remaining chilis and pour over. Bake covered 30 -40min. Remove foil, sprinkle remaining cheese on and bake another 15-25 min until cheese is nicely browned. Worked out great.

I have made this three times and have gotten rave reviews each time. I also have tweaked it each time, trying to get it close to the seafood norte enchiladas at a local restaurant. I used fake crab each time, along with the shrimp, plus I mixed a little green sauce in with the seafood, lite sour cream, green onion, and cheese. I don't care for spicy food, so I mixed alfredo sauce in with the sour cream to make it creamier. I know - I am cross-culturing foods, plus creating "heart attack on a plate", but what can I say? I covered the enchiladas with cheese and some extra alfredo sauce in the bottom of the pan for moisture while baking. I heated the rest of the green sauce on the stove and put it on the table so people could add to their own taste after serving. I also served with shredded lettuce on top. I like the idea of adding cooked rice to the seafood mixture & will try that the next time I make this recipe. It's a keeper!

These were pretty good. I added a bit of cream cheese, green chilies, and garlic to the filling which added a lot of flavor. The only problem I found with this recipe is that the green enchilada sauce seemed to overpower the delicate crab flavor. I might try this again but I'll add less of the green enchilada sauce and maybe add some half and half.

My whole family loved these!  I used our  left over king crab and Lg. shrimp, which I cut in fourths, so the seafood was as good as it can get.  I did add a 4 oz. can of green chiles to the seafood, and also added some sour cream to the green enchilada sauce.   I served with a cilantro/jalanpeno rice, delicious!

Excellent! I asdded green chilies to each tortilla and used green (medium) taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce on top. Black beans on the side and fresh crab helps too! This is a fine resteraunt quality meal.

Made it exactly as the recipes says the first time- not alot of taste. Second time, I increased crab meat to 12 oz., added a small can of green chilies, and 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Also used pepper jack cheese for more heat!

Delicious, and even better in leftovers!  I used two cans of sauce--one under the tortillas and one over--and mixed the scallions with the shrimp.  I also mixed in a (drained) can of RoTel, and sprinkled cheese lightly over the filling.

I also used the imitation crab meat and fresh shrimp.  When my husband first heard what was for dinner, he turned his nose up but once he tried them he loved them.  In fact, he stole some off of my plate.  Would make again.

Made these tonight for hubby and I. I used an imitation crab and shrimp mix, along with bigger shrimp that were frozen. I just sauteed those up in some olive oil before putting in the enchilada. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T regarding the ingredients, but I just didn't pay attention to the quantity of meat or cheese...I just added what seemed reasonable for each enchilada. Also, since so many people complained of them being soggy, I drastically reduced the amount of enchilada sauce that was used. Finally, I baked these in a Pyrex dish, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. They were perfect. Halfway through cooking I added some more cheese, scallions and a little cajun seasoning to the tops of them. We took them out and they were yummy. I also served this with sour cream, avocados and the Mexican Rice III recipe from this website. The only thing missing was a pitcher of sangria! Will definitely make again but will try canned crab as opposed to the imitation.

Liked this a lot.  I used a lime green enchilada sauce which was nice cause it added a slight citrus flavor that complimented the shrimp and crab.  I did add a bit more sauce to make sure it was not dry.  Clean and simple flavors.  Was a bit surprised that with few ingredients how good it was.  Thanks for the recipe.

Um, YUMMY!  Living in Alaska we were so excited to use our crab meat.  My boyfriend is fond of Tex-Mex and well, it was a hit!  We made it just as listed and it was good!  Would make again -- but leaving out the green enchilada sauce -- just wasn't our favorite!

Used a combo of fresh and canned crab; mixed up with 4 oz. of cream cheese (softened), sour cream and the onions.  Used pepper jack cheese, and served with additional sour cream.  My brother and brother-in-law were euphoric!  Lots of praise! My husband said they were kind of fishy, hence the 4 stars only.   Will try using all fresh crab next time.  Doubled the sauce and the cheese on top of the enchiladas as others suggested.  Thanks for sharing the recipe; will make again.

I used fresh crab and added some garlic powder, cream cheese, and green chilies to the enchilada mixture.  My family LOVED this recipe.  We think it turned out better then the ones we have had in the restraunt!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I also coated each tortilla with lite cream cheese. I only got 10 8" tortillas out of this recipe, but that was plenty for a dinner for four.  Very tasty! As another suggested, I cut the shrimp into pieces.

Excellent recipe!! I did alter it a little however, I omitted the crab, and used 24 ozs of shrimp then roughly diced them. I also used Colby-Monterey Jack Marbled cheese shredded. We will make this one a regular!

A word of warning: DON'T buy mole verde sauce instead of green enchilada sauce. My know-it-all fiance assured me it was the same thing but I cannot imagine that it is. The mole verde looked, smelled and tasted disgusting, so I had to leave it out of the recipe. The enchiladas were a little dry as a result, but they still tasted good. I would make them again but next time will NOT be taking a "certain someone's" advice!!

This was great (and so easy)! I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for two people. We order seafood enchiladas in Mexican Restaurants and this was one of the best we've ever had! Highly recommend

I followed recipe to the letter and while the taste was good, the texture kept me from being able to finish the meal.  I agree with an earlier post that the tortillas were way too soggy. May try again with corn.

These are the best enchiladas I've ever had.  I made it just as written except that I put tomatoes in with the enchiladas.

Simple and quick to make, always a hit with the family.  We do use imitation crab in place of the canned crab meat.

Soooo tasty, but I did make a few alterations...I have a teen son who has a spice fixation. I added a can of chopped green chilies, a little sour cream and the scallions to the shrimp and crab. I also used imitation crab. I had a hard time finding the green enchilada sauce, but after an afternoon of searching I did find it. I'm glad I did because it is light enough in flavor to not cover the flavors of the seafood, I definitely think the red version would have taken away from the dish. And, you do need to spread a little sauce on the bottom of the baking dish to keep the enchiladas from sticking.
This is getting added to my recipe rotation!! Very easy to make and so good!

I started with 2 tbs. butter and sauteed the shrimp and claw meat, then removed from heat and added the cheese.  I used pepper jack cheese...definitely needed the kick. For the sauce, I used a can of green ench. sauce, 1 c. fat free 1/2 & 1/2, 1/4c. fat free sour cream, and 2 tbs. butter.....this is AWSOME.  Next time I am going to add chopped lobster meat.

If you like suggestions, I made mine generously stuffed with 2-6oz cans crab, 1.5 lbs shrimp, 8 oz monterey jack, 4 oz jalepeno jack and 4 oz cream cheeses (mmmmm, cheese). It made 7-12inch enchilladas. They were....awesome.

This was quite good.  I incorporated suggestions from many of the other reviewers.  I sauted uncooked shrimp with a generous amount of garlic and a couple of leeks.  I added about a 1/4 cup of cream cheese and some pepper to the mixture.  I put a bit of the sauce in the pan first to prevent sticking (although it did still stick somewhat).  For the last 15 minutes of baking I also threw some shredded cheddar on top and then broiled for a minute or so at the end.  The biggest change was that I could only find red enchilada sauce and it was still good but I can see that the green sauce may be the key.  I also generously filled 6 large flour tortillas and it filled my 9X13 ceramic dish nicely.  I found that with the amount of crab in this recipe I got a nice crab flavour and didn't need more.  I also used the amount of sauce listed and it was fine...not too soggy.  Found I didn't need near the amounts of sour cream or green onions listed.  Thanks for the recipe and all the other suggestions too!

another way to make a similar dish:

mix a ratio of cooked, large-chopped shrimp and crab (real or fake, i used a pack of the surimi stuff) that you like. add a dollop of low-fat sour cream and a touch of half-n-half (again whatever fat level you like, it will work.) now saute onions, garlic, dash of cayenne powder, and FIRE-ROASTED TOMATILLOS (i used fresh, canned will work. these add a wonderful citrusy acidity that is PERFECT with the sweet and rich seafood. THE secret ingredient here) till soft, add this to the seafood. stir in some grated monterey jack or your favorite mexican melting cheese. have chopped fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice (cut a lime in half and twist a spoon in there like citrus juicer, or just squeeze with your hand.) add these to both the filling and sauce to taste.

okay, the filling is done. now take some corn tortillas and toast them in a hot dry pan, one by one, till fragrant and a little colored (you could skip the toasting, but it's worth it!)
mix a canned verde (green, it must be green! the flavor is different than red, and goes with the seafood and tomatillos) enchilada sauce with some sour cream and hot sauce to taste with a whisk.  pour some sauce in your baking dish. add layers of sauce/stuffed tortillas till you run out, ending with sauce and a sprinkle of cheese. bake 40+ minutes till you see bubbles and melted cheese throughout.  yum. (yeah, i'd post my own "creamy verde seafood enchilada" but i don't measure things, so it's a pain to

I added the following items to the original recipe: 1 can of crab meat, 2.25 oz of black olives, 2 cloves of garlic, 2 jalapenos, 1 more 8 oz bag of cheese, sour cream, cilantro and 1 avocado. I also used white corn tortillas and briefly sautéed each of them in a pat of butter so they don’t tear when you roll them. 

I mixed all of the following in a large mixing bowl:
-	2 (6 ounce) can crab meat, drained very well
-	1lb shrimp, shelled deveined and cut into thirds
-	2.25 oz can of black olives
-	3.5 oz can of green chilies
-	1 bunch of green onions, chopped
-	5 oz of the green enchilada sauce
-	2 full tbsp of sour cream
-	Dash of salt
-	2 garlic cloves, minced
-	2 jalapenos, seeded and minced
I put 2 teaspoons of the above mixture and a handful of cheese in each tortilla. (I ended up using 1 of the bags of cheese during this step)
I fit all this into a 14.75 x 10.5 pan (bigger than recommended) and was able to fit 10 enchiladas total. I then spread the remaining 15 oz of enchilada sauce and 2nd bag of cheese on top.

After cooking, I topped the cooked enchiladas off with finely chopped fresh cilantro and cold, diced avocado. I served with Mexican rice and black beans.

These were so delicious.  My husband loved them too.  I would, however, recommend covering for fist half of baking to avoid tortillas & cheese from getting too hard on top.

My husband, son and I liked this recipe very much.  I will definitely use this recipe again. I added leftover Indian Style basmati rice to the inside of the rolled tortilla. I used only shrimp, since that was what I had in the house.  I precooked the shrimp with onions, garlic & lemon juice.  I cut up the shrimps in medium chunks to help in the rolling up of the tortilla.  Being lactose intolerant I put mozzorella cheese on top of the tortillas, during the last 5 minutes of baking, so everyone knew which had the cheese and which didn't.

I thought these were delicious.... but I do have some criticisms: it was a bit too "fishy" smelling (could be the kind of shrimp I used) and definitely needs double the amount of crab.

I have made this recipe many times and love it because it doesn't have a million ingredients and it does not dirty up a ton of dishes. That being said, it is also really really good. i have made it using spinach and mushroom instead of seafood.  Also, buy a quality canned green sauce. I have had luck with La Victoria. Some brands a too salty.

These were so easy.  I used imitation crab instead of real crab.  I didn't measure the cheese, but used a lot of it.  I will make these again, but add more stuff to the filling.

It was very good. I could see how you would like to spruce it up. It is hard for me to eat seafood the following day so I would make sure I have a big crowd or make less.

I add some green chiles (hatch) in with the crab and shrimp but other then that use the recipe as is. It is terrific! One of my family's favorites!

This is simple and delicious to make. The only change I made is to use imitation crab instead of canned crab. I use the recipe for Tomatillo Salsa Verde on this site instead of green enchilada sauce.

Yum!  My husband and I both loved these.  The green enchilada sauce is really good with the seafood.  I had leftover meat because it did not all fit into the tortillas.  I was only able to fit 7-8 in the pan.  Very good, thanks for sharing!  Update: I used two cans of crab so the seafood mixture was more even.  I liked that better.  This time all the meat got used in eight full enchiladas, soft taco size.

My family loves this recipe!  It's easy to make & you can add your own touches too.  I often substitute the shrimp & crab for chicken, beef, beans, etc!  I like it because it's more of a main dish- rather than a casserole.  It makes a nice presentation & looks harder than it really is.  Family & friends will be impressed!

Followed HURRICANEJEDI's comments and they turned out great.  I could only fit 9 8" tortillas in the dish, but still had tons of leftovers.  Will probably make a 1/2 recipe next time since I made it for two people!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

These were good! Like other reviewers though, I could not find green enchilada sauce so I had to use red. I also used corn tortillas (like the taste better and much fewer calories). I used the artificial crab meat that you buy in the seafood dept.

Overall very good, but I will make again with the green sauce (I'll try an authentic mexican grocery store) and review again. I think these will make the regular rotation!

My family liked this alot.  I followed the directions exactly except I bought uncooked shrimp and had to cook them first...I sauteed them in butter and a little garlic to cook them.  I added 3 ounces of cream cheese to the seafood and then followed the recipe.  It was delicious.  Green enchilada sauce was hard to find but I think it was worth it because I think red would have been too strong with the seafood. Great recipe, will definitely make again.

These were great! I read the recommendations from other reviews and mixed cream cheese with Rotel (drained) and green chillies (drained) and added it in the tortillas.  Helped a ton with flavor.  Next time I think I will try corn tortillas.  The flour tortillas turned out very doughy. Served with Salad of Lettuce, Tomato, Corn (drained), black beans (drained) with Salsa as the dressing.

Excellent! I modified the recipe a bit, however, adding cream cheese and diced green chilies to the filling and topping with a creamy sauce made with cream of chicken, a bit of milk, sour cream, cheese, and salsa verde. Would also work well with shredded chicken!

These are wonderful!  I added cream cheese to the filling as suggested and reversed the ratio of shrimp to crab, using lump precooked frozen imitation crab meat, chopping it my processor and it was great!  Everyone raved.  So easy.  Will make again...

WOW!! I made a mistake and thought I was reviewing this enchilada recipe but it was one of the other seafood enchilada recipes.  This one is the one I made and eveyone went crazy over.  The green chili sauce made it great.

This was SO easy, especially if you buy pre-cooked shrimp. 
This also is low fat if you use low fat 
sour cream and low fat cheese. I served this
with Spanish rice and a garden salad and it was fantastic!

I made this for dinner last night and it really was not that good. I took some suggestions of other reviewers but it really just ended up as a mush with strange taste. We ended up just picking the shrimp out and eating them.

These were excellent but the enchilada sauce I bought was way too hot for me to eat. Hubby managed but I just couldn't so I had to brush it off. But the enchilada itself filled with seafood was delicious and I will be repeating these often regardless of the too-hot sauce.

Holy wowza!!! This was sooooo delsih! As long as you can get past the appearance (my enchiladas were no where NEAR as photogenic as Traci's Kitchen's photo...), you'll be in for a REAL treat. :) My hubs was on the fence, but he's not much of an enchilada fan anyways. I really think the quality of green sauce you use makes a HUGE difference here. I used slightly less than what was needed for halving this recipe - an 8 oz. pouch of Rick Bayless's green enchilada sauce (it's a little pricy but so worth it!). I used an entire can of lump crabmeat and am glad I did. I strongly suggest doubling the amount of crab if you make all twelve enchiladas. One final change I made was to smear a scant amount of sauce on the bottom of my baking dish and on each tortilla before rolling up. With the suggested garnishes (a must, IMHO), these were perfecto! Mexican rice and margaritas rounded out this insanely easy meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your fantastic recipe, ChristyJ! :-)

Husband called them better than restaurant. I followed the receipe, however, I added chopped spinach. I did saute onion, garlic, and the shrimp used cumin and chili powder then added hot mixture to the crab.

This was very easy to make.  I used imitation crab meat instead of the canned...I think it might be better with the canned.  The kids seemed to like it, they didn't complain which is a good sign from mine.  Could use some spices on the seafood, but other than that, it was a pretty good dish.  Will be making again!

I used imitation crab and small bay shrimp to keep costs down, and it was okay, but I'm sure real crab would have been better. The one thing I really didn't care for was that the flour tortillas got a bit soggy the first night, and much too soggy the second night. If I make again I'll keep the filling for the second night separate and just assemble and bake when we're ready to eat. Probably, though, I'll just try it again with large corn tortillas. I took some reviewers' advice and added cumin and cilantro, which I thought was a great addition.

Ok, I did change this up just a little to fit what I had on hand and to better fit our budget.... I used imitation crab meat because at $4.29 lb compared to $17.99 lb way better fit my budget. I also, used precooked mini shrimp meat but I also got about 5 large scallops and chopped them up because they were on sale at my husbands work.  I took other users advice and added a box of low-fat cream cheese to bind the seafood together. Also added, because I am always trying to sneak some veggies in, some diced red pepper, green onion and a 4 oz. can of green chiles, along with some of the grated cheese and a few spices (cumin, chile powder and cayenne, if I remember correctly).  I used corn tortillas because enchiladas just aren't enchiladas to me without them.  Toasted those, then dipped them in the green enchilada sauce to bring out their flavor and make them easier to roll.  Added filling and put them all in the dish.  Before adding the sauce, I decided to spread about a cup or so of sour cream over the enchiladas, then added the sauce, then the cheese. These were scrumptious, I wish I had the foresight to make a second dish! Will make these again VERY soon! Thank You for the recipe.

This was good and easy.  I sauteed the shrimp with a leek in olive oil.  I only had room and filling for 8 nice size enchiladas and I made 1/2 with corn tortillas and the other 1/2 with flour tortillas.  I preferred the flavor of the corn.  I also used salsa verde from Trader Joe's and it gave the dish a nice flavor.  I will make this again.

i made this with "Best Spanish Rice" on this site. It I did saute this garlic, onion, and vegetable oil. I added Ground Red Pepper, Paprika, and Chili Powder to the mixture, about a teaspoon of each. I made 6 Big enciliadas, but man were they soupy... the flavor was good but next time i will cut the sauce at least in half, maybe more. And ill use more cheese, 8oz wasnt enough for me. But its a good recipe and tasted good.

Absolutely fantastic!  Next time I think I'll use a mix of Mexican shredded cheeses instead of just Monterey Jack.

I did not care for this recipe. It has NO FLAVOR what so ever. I needs A LOT of tweeking that it would be much better to make up another recipe. The flour tortillas turn into mush. The green enchilada sauce needs more flavor. If you, like I , LOVE shrimp, don't waste them on this recipe. Instead try the Fish Tacos on this recipe but sub with shrimp, IT's delicioso!

WOW! these were sooo good! We loved this recipe and I'm actually making it again tonite! ;)  I added some chopped jalepenos for some kick and I read some of the reviews and added some Alfredo sauce.  It really  made it more creamier!  Also this time around I'm adding an extra can of crab and diced green chilis.  YUMO! can't wait to eat it again tonite! ********** Also - i used an extra can of green enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan so it wouldn't stick********  It's a great recipe to add whatever your pallate craves

This was a very good recipe. I scaled this down for 6 people. I added a small can diced green chiles inside the tortillas, added more cheese (full block for 6 tortillas),sauteed shrimp in garlic and butter first and added a whole bottle of green enchilada sauce (for 6 people, I was supposed to use 1/2 bottle). Thanks to those who added their suggestions in their reviews-it helped a lot!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed a lot of other reviews and sauteed the shrimp in olive oil with onion,  garlic,  red &  green peppers.  I also added black olives ,cream cheese and fresh chopped tomatoes.   My daughter who's a very picky eater loved them and had seconds.  I will definitely add this to my collection.  Thanks ChristyJ!!!

Gotta love when people say this is great but then proceed to say how they changed the recipe extensively like a few of these folks. Don't do that, we don't care about your variation. I stuck with the recipe and it was enjoyed by all.

I agree with another review.  It was good, but not terrific.  I was looking for something like the "Cancun seafood enchiladas" once serves at the Chi Chi's restaurants, and this was not it.  It's good, but maybe my expectations were to high from the restaurant experience.  I may experiment with this recipe as a base to try to duplicate that taste.

I used half the sauce and pepper jack cheese instead of plain Monterey. I only used .5 lb shrimp. These were too rich for me. Only two out of five of us liked these. Easy but $$$.

I have made this recipe 5 or 6 times now and I think I've perfected it.  I put tomato paste in the bottom of the dish.  I use 1 lb of shrimp (raw, chopped if large), 1 can of crab, 1 can of green chiles, about 4oz of sour cream, 2 cloves garlic and some shakes of fajita seasoning for the filling.  I use pepper jack in the tortilla and on top for a little additional kick.  I typically make these and beef ones at the same time so people have options.  They are great and love how they can be made in advance!

This turned out very yummy, but about a half hour after eating it, my husband started to have a reaction: he is sensitive to MSG and I didn't notice that the green enchilada sauce is FULL of it! So we like the flavor a lot, but will steer clear of the sauce next time. I will probably substitute some type of tomatillo salsa to preserve the flavor but avoid the MSG.

Wow! 2/3 of an ounce of cheese; 1/2 of an ounce of crab and 1 1/3 of an ounce of shrimp...very miserly with the ingredients.  I make this for 2 people and use 1 can of crabmeat (6oz), 4 oz of shrimp, 1 1/2 oz. of cheese. I also add 2 oz of chopped red onion and 2 oz. of chopped red bell pepper.  Much better!

Boring, the ingredients sounded good but there definitely was no "flair". I will be looking for a different variation of enchiladas with seafood.

These are so deliciously easy!  We had a Mexican feast for our Thanksgiving Dinner, and so far 4 different people have asked me for the recipe!  I never follow a recipe exactly, so I used cooked chicken instead of crab, and more cheese than the recipe called for.  I also pre-mixed the stuffing for the tortillas, because it seemed more efficient.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone for any meal!

Yummy!...  I sauted half an onion with some pablano chili and added it to the seafood cheese mix.  I didn't use the whole can of enchilada sauce, I put a little on the bottom of the baking dish, then sparingly covered each enchilada so they wouldn't get soggy!  Served with Spanish rice and veggies.  We skipped the sour cream and green onions!   Thanks!

Made lots of changes to what would have been a very bland recipe.  Sauteed 1 chopped onion, 4 minced garlic cloves, & several minced hot peppers; added 1/2 can Rotel. To shrimp/crab, added 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, cayenne, S&P, ground cumin, chili powder, Worcestershire sauce, 2 cups shredded cheese, dried parsley, 1/2 bunch chopped green onion, & onion mixture. Combined 1 small can green & 1 small can red enchilada sauce, plus hot sauce to taste. Spread enough sauce on bottom of pan to cover, pour remainder on top of rolled enchiladas, top with 1 cup shredded cheese.

My family loved it!! the only thing I will do differently the next time I make it is I will use less tortillas.I never roll the enchiladas separately but rather just lay it all out in one big casserole dish like a lasagna, it saves time and is less of a mess.  Thanks for the awesomely easy recipe!!

We used 1 can of crabmeat and mini shrimp. Added 4oz of cream cheese to the mixture and yummy. My son couldn't wait to eat it while he helped me assemble them. Smell so good. Just like at our favorite restraunt.

I have cooked this recipe three times and it is awesome every time.  I like to use the smaller tortillas instead of the 12" and I like a saucy burrito, so I use two cans of green sauce.  Other than that...perfect!  It is so quick and simple and at the last pot luck I went to everyone was talking about it!

I've made this a couple times now and I have one pointer- make sure you get quality crab meat! The first time I made this it came out fantastic, the next time way too crabby/fishy tasting. I tried once more making sure I used dungeness crab meat and it was excellent once again. YUM!

I made this recipe and was disappointed.  the recommended baking dish was to small for all the Enchiladas, there wasn't enough crab, and it could have been baked longer.

I made this the first time for some friends and family and it was the best enchiladas. I add more cheese and shrimp than it called for. It was so good that my husband heated 2 more up during the middle of the night.

To have fuller enchiladas, only use 8 tortillas.  Whole wheat tortillas work well.  The cream cheese and Rotella mix is a great addition.  I recommend three cans of green enchilada sauce.  I sauteed the cooked shrimp a fews minutes in butter and garlic.  I used frozen shrimp and fresh crabmeat.  I also recommend cooking about 55 minutes if you are using the extra ingredients.  Canned refried beans are an excellent side choice.

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't like the crab meat so I just used shrimp. Unlike most of the reviewers, I found the green sauce.  You can find it at wal-mart in the mexican section.  The recipe needs just a little more spice.  I will probably make this again.

I went with the fake crab otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Excellent taste, everyone here loved it. Served with refried beans on the side, wine coolers, chips and salsa.  Will make ona regular basis.

We used low carb tortillas and, instead of using 20 oz of enchilada sauce, we used 10 oz and added 10 oz of fat free sour cream to the enchilada sauce. It was wonderful! I hate peeling and deveining shrimp, but this recipe was worth it. Definitely a keeper.

Another great recipe!  I did NOT spend a lot of money on this--I took the leftover seafood from a restaurant trip (shrimp and scallops), used about 2/3 of a can of crabmeat, (this was for only two people, so I made only 3 enchiladas), and added in a tiny bit of leftover salmon that I didn't want to throw away (Salmon with Lemon and Dill by Mitch103--yummy, by the way) and it was all fantastic.  Bought the green sauce--forgot the green onions and did not have enough monterey jack, so I mixed the filling with onion powder and a little bit of green sauce, and mixed the cheese with cheddar, and it was great!   I am so indebted to all the great cooks on this site; the recipes and reviews have made me much braver in the kitchen!  Never before would I have attempted a recipe if I did not have ALL the ingredients in the right amounts--but so many of you improvise when you hsve to and it comes out well.  I was so surprised to find that with my improvising this still was great.  Thanks everyone!

Fabulous!  I was in the mood for seafood as I don't have it very often.  I went and got everything at the grocery store and it came to about $17.00.  The whole recipe was about 4 meals I found (ok we didn't have anything to go with it).  So the cost was about $3.50 per meal which for seafood wasn't bad at all!

So I made a few things different.  I got some hot peppers (can't remember which ones, but fresh).  I chopped them up and chopped up all the chives and put them in the mixing bowl.  Then I chopped the shrimp into 3rds and used imitation crab and cut that up so they were smaller pieces.  I added those to the mixing bowl.  Then I added all the sour cream and mixed it thoroughly and then added the cheese with a few herbs.  The idea was the cheese and sour cream would make a binding sauce while it cooked.  Then it made about 6 large enchiladas which were all that would fit in the dish!  The green enchilada sauce was poured over top and was absorbed while cooking making it nice and moist with a little cheese over top.

My fiance was thought it looked wierd and was surprised to find it was not beef.  But he liked it (7 out of 10, high rating for him).  Anyway I'm more of a seafood lover and it was a huge hit with me!  The perfect consistency inside, very creamy, and very rich!

This is a very easy recipe.  I feel that it needed a kick.  I would suggest using Pepper Jack cheese inside and regular M.Jack on the outside.  Or just use all of Pepper Jack.  It reminded me of the seafood enchiladas that I had in New Market, very good.  I would make this again.  It seems like a fun recipe to experiment with.  Thanks!!

This was good and EASY to put together.  I will make this again, but I also plan on experimenting a liitle.  Maybe try a creamier suace, add some spice, or even add more crab meat. I used a cheese blend instead of only Monterey, and only 12 oz of shrimp and it was plenty.

While I had great plans to saute the shrimp with garlic I ended up very short on time.  I only had time to spread cream cheese on the tortillas and fill them with the 3 ingredients called for in the recipe. I poured the enchilada sauce on top and put it in --talk about quick and easy.  I wasn't expecting too much BUT it was great!  My whole family loved it.  I can't wait to try it with the sauted seasoned shrimp!!

Outstanding! My husband and children raved and raved. I used 30 oz of grene chili enchilada sauce. I sauted the shrimp in garlic, olive oil and onions first as others have suggested. I also chopped the shrimp first in order to make the enchiladas more consistant.This recipe was amazing. Next time I think I will spray the baking dish with non-stick cooking spray first because I experience a bit of "stickage."

My husband and I really liked these a lot.  Very easy to make, and delicious.  I didn't know what green enchilada sauce was, so I bought Salsa Verde....they turned out awesome.  I read the other comments and I also added some cream cheese/chopped chives to the filling. I also didn't fill 12 tortillas, I just over stuffed 4 of them.  A keeper for sure!

I was really looking forward to making this but was very disappointed in the results.  There was too much shrimp and not near enough crab.  The overall taste was very disappointing.  I won't make it again.

I used smoked oysters with the crabmeat and shrimp.  Red enchilada sauce and then topped my cheese with real bacon bits and olives!  Delicious!!

I would give less than one star if I could.  A really expensive dish which was tasteless,  bland, runny, curdled and just plain horrible. Followed the recipe to the T but what a disappointment.  Looking back on others who had the same problem I don’t know how anyone could give this anything higher than a 2.  Keep looking if you want a decent recipe, this one doesn’t even come close to being edible.

Made this to fit where I live in the Pacific NW. I used shrimp meat rather than med shrimp and fresh crab that I caught and used more crab than 1 tiny can. I used my own green salsa I canned. Yum!

I live in Washington and would never use canned crab when fresh is available 15 minutes off the dock.  I made it with fresh Oregon Shrimp meat and this made for an awesome meal.

This is absolutely wonderful. My tortillas were soft taco size, and I got 11 perfectly filled enchiladas. I did have Kraft Mexican shredded cheese instead of the Jack, but I doubt that made a lot of difference. 
The only change I did make was to pour a bit of sauce in the pan first to prevent sticking, a little bit on top of the filling before rolling, and only poured enough on top to cover them. We do not like swimming enchiladas.

I followed the  suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the crab meat, otherwise made it as stated, and it was wonderful. They go together in no time but taste like you worked hard on them. I did use corn/flour combination tortillas, had never used them before and they were great. We made short work of them so will make these again and again.

My first enchiladas and they were great! I used smaller tortillas because I'm not feeding godzilla! I cooked the shrimp in olive oil and chopped garlic, adding fresh lemon juice at the end. I agree, one can of crab is not enough but I am fortunate enough to get fresh Dungeness crab (used one whole crab, about 8 oz.) Also used (hot) red sauce! Yummy!

I used corn tortillas that after I did this I found it should have been fried for a few secs before I rolled them up. To that end They fell completely apart & turned into more of a casserole. . However, they were still awesome! I wasn't expecting much flavor with so few ingredients but they worked. I did mix all the inside ingredients together first and then put them in the tortillas but I don't think it would matter either way.

This came out amazing!  I added sea scallops, green chilies and onions which I sauteed in butter and garlic.  I also used fresh cilantro instead of green onions.  I put pepper jack in the enchiladas and a mixture of chedder and pepper jack on the top.  I served it with rice and beans and WOW it was good.

Great, easy dish.  We used imitation crab meat instead of the real stuff and a Mexican cheese blend instead of the Jack cheese. We also added chopped jalapenos and the sour cream to the mixture.  Next time I might think add some green chilis, or maybe some diced tomatoes. Regardless, we really enjoyed this recipe!

This recipe was okay. I was expecting to be WOW'd and was let down. I did use the flour tortillas as the recipe called for, but in my traditional enchiladas I will ONLY use corn. My 17 yr old son did request that I make them again, and he usually hates white cream sauces so I was kind of shocked at that. My husband is not home yet, so the verdict is out yet for him. I will probably try them again, but this time use the corn tortillas. I pretty much made them as called for in the recipe, except I had cheddar Jack cheese, only 12 oz of shrimp in my pkg and I mixed 1/2 C sour cream with 1/2 C of the green enchilada sauce  and some of the shredded cheese, which was a combination of this recipe and the shrimp and crab enchilada recipe that was on the back of the package of shrimp I had purchased.  BTW...if you're looking for the green sauce go to the Mexican aisle of a larger store and look toward the bottom shelves...that's where I found mine. I will try to update with comments again once I try the corn tortillas.

Sounds good except for the salsa verde, seafood enchiladas are much better with a creamy tomitillo salsa... lets you taste the seafood.

These were awsome!  I used 1 pound of jumbo lump white crabmeat (pricey but worth it!) and shredded taco blend cheese to add spice.  I also used red chile enchilada sauce.  We loved this dish and I served it with Mexican Rice Pilaf and chips with fresh salsa.

OMG!  Wonderful seafood enchilada recipe.  I mixed the shrimp (which i sauteed first in a bit of olive oil w/some cayenne pepper and then chopped), crab (imitation...I like it better), cheese (reduced fat), sour cream (reduced fat), green onion and a can of green chilis together to make the "filling".  I used corn tortillas as I prefer them.  And I couldn't find green enchilada sauce, so I just went with canned red sauce.  Ok...so I barely followed the recipe :-)...but it was a great starting off point for a wonderful (and fairly light) dinner.

These were very good.  My husband suggested next time trying them with chicken instead of shrimp and crab.  I made a couple small changes.  I added about 3 tablespoons of sour cream and a small can of diced green chilies and mixed them together with the cheese, shrimp, and crab prior to putting it into the tortilla.  Otherwise everything else was the same.

Had crab and shrimp and looking for ideas..found this recipe. Unfortunately i didn't have any of the enchilada sauce, so i made some of my own with ingredients i had available. I used 2 cans cream of celery soup, 1 tbl garlic powder, 1/2 cup sour cream, cayenne pepper, 1 can diced green chiles and 1 can diced jalapenos warmed in a pan. I pured the mixture to remove any chunks of celery or peppers. Mixed 1/3 of the mixture with crab (used imitation) and shrimp, along with cheese. Placed this mixture into tortillas, placed in a pan and topped with remaining mixture mixed with a cup of half and half and cheese. It was awesome. My husband said it was one of his favorites! Thanks for the great idea!

Awesome Recipe.  I sauteed the shrimp with Garlic Olive Oil and onions.  Since I have a dislike of canned crab meat (a little too fishy sometimes) I used fresh dungenous crab.  Also to add a little extra flavor I added diced green chilies.  Spectacular!!!!

My guest enjoyed this meal. I love Allrecipes because of the tips from other reviewers. I took their advice & added a can of green chilis, as well as black olives. I also added extra cheese and the chopped green onions to the mixture. Thanks for all the recipes!!

This was just okay for us.  I followed others recommendations based on what our family likes and used imitation crab.  Sauted onions, garlic clove, and dash of cumin then added to the shrimp and crab before stuffing the tortillas.  Don't think I will make again.

These were just okay for me.  I did add a can of diced green chilis and I'm so glad I did as I felt this dish totally lacked in flavor.  All who ate these in my house added lots of hot sauce.  Don't think I will make these again.  Being from the beautiful Pacific NW I would never use any seafood out of a can, except for tuna for a tuna sandwich.  Use fresh crab if you can and you will not have the "fishy" problem.  If you are going to that expense tho I just think there are many better dishes to highlight the wonderful flavor of crab.

Pretty good!  I couldn't really taste the crabmeat - next time I will either add more or use imitation crabmeat instead.  But I'd make it again.

These were very good, but for some reason I didn't care for the crab.  Maybe it was because I used imitation?!  I think you need the real thing.

This was wonderful!  I did add 4 oz cream cheese to the crab and mixed it well, then added the shrimp.  (I also used 2 cans of crab.)  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Very filling and a little rich, but excellent!  I would serve theses to company.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!! So tasty I forgot to add the sour cream.  Only changes were I used only shrimp, instead of crab also, which I sauteed in cumin, olive oil, garlic, onion, chili pepper before stuffing the tortillas. I used the monteray jack inside and outside used a Mexican blend of cheese.

This was not at all what I was expecting considering the reviews were so high.  I followed directions exactly, but should have made some additions.  My son liked them, but my husband and I were not impressed. Definitely needs something to add some flavor. Probably won't make these again.

Yummy! My husband LOVES shrimp enchiladas and this recipe certainly made him happy. And...even my 3-yr old liked it. I didn't have green enchilada sauce, so I just used the red sauce mixed with the sourcream. I also added some sour cream, the green onions, some cilantro and a dash of garlic powder to the filling and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. It turned out GREAT!

I thought these were good... not as fabulous as I was expecting, which could have been due to the canned crab meat that I used (if I ever try this again, I'll use fresh). I also used corn tortillas for more authentic enchiladas (which I fried and coated with sauce before rolling).

Well I had planned on following directions exactly as written but when I got to the grocery store, they did not have green enchilada sauce.  I ended up substituting red.  I also decided to use more crab.  Family enjoyed a lot.  Thanks

This was very good.  I did make some changes to it, as follows: 
--used imitation lobster meat instead of the crab and shrimp
--used a low fat Mexican cheese blend in place of the Monterey Jack
--I added about 1/4 of a block of low fat cream cheese, cut up, into the filling
--I added about 1/2 t. of ground cumin to the filling mixture
--I added the Rotel tomatoes into the filling as others recommended.  
--For the sauce, I used a mixture of red enchilada sauce and about 1/2-3/4 C. of low fat sour cream, as green enchilada sauce was not available at my store. I poured a little of the sauce in the bottom of the pan before placing the enchiladas in the pan, then poured the rest of the sauce over the top. 
--I omitted the green onions, as I did not have them.

I will definitely make this again, as my husband loved it!  And the variations could be endless!

These were really good, I mixed some cream cheese in with the crabmeat & shrimp, & added some fresh garlic. Honestly, I think it would be better without these two additions! I will try again & follow recipe as stated. Overall, very good flavor!

The whole family loved this dish!  My only "tweak" was that I only had about 5 oz of Jack cheese.  So I added a package of cream cheese to the filling mixture.  Very tasty topped with sour cream!

I neither loved nor hated these.  They were just ok.  I added the 8 oz. of sour cream to the filling because I thought there was not enough substance to it.  I'm glad I did.  I ended up serving with more sour cream to top them with.  I filled 10 tortillas, but should have only done 5.  They were mostly tortilla, not a lot of filling.  I used salad shrimp, which worked out perfectly.  I sauteed the shrimp and crab in olive oil and garlic for a moment before filling the tortillas.

I cooked shrimp and imitation crab meat with butter,garlic,and scallions before putting them in tortillas. I used a four cheese mexican blend instead of just monterey jack. The enchilada sauce was red and I also topped them with cream of shrimp soup (mixde with milk). These would be good with any type of meat.

Really liked this recipe. Was great the next day for lunch at work too. I did add a little fat free cream cheese to the tortillas to try and make it creamier. I didnt use shrimp, just crab. Basically everything but the cheese was fat free or very low (1.5g or less). I couldnt find low or free monterey jack and wanted to stay with that. This is a great "base" recipe that will be fun to play with in the future, even with veggies as the filling.

I used imitation crab and lobster (I ran out of crab)but otherwise, followed the recipe except used pepper jack. Should have stuck to monterey. My preference, but that was what I had at he time. I thought it needed some cream sauce, but other than that it was excellent! Thanx Lisa.

Oh drool! I've had a version of this years ago made with crawfish tails, and Ro-Tel. This is a great recipe, and no left overs. Woo-Hoo!

I used the recipe as a foundation but sauteed the (uncooked in shell) shrimp w/ chunk lobster meat (from Costco...already had it in my freezer)w/ 3 cloves garlic, 3/4 c roasted corn (frozen from T Joes) and olive oil. I then peeled the shrimp and cut them up and broke up the lobster pieces. The lobster left about 1/3 c liquid, which I added to the sauce. I used a combination of (land of lakes)reduced fat mexican blend cheese and asiago/mozzarella/garlic blend cheese. I also added Cilantro to the sauce and garnished w/ it along w/ the green onions. Next time I would get the thinner tortillas and skip the sour cream.  The corn worked well though

I had high hopes for this one. The texture was very chunky. It had little taste. Not worth the money spent on making them. I wish I'd tried imitation crab meat first.

I wasn't overly thrilled with this recipe.  It didn't have a bad taste, but on the other hand, it really didn't taste great either.  In fact, it seemed that something was a bit off about it.  Initially, I used all the ingredients called for in the recipe, without any substitutions.  After tasting it, we did add some hot sauce of our own,  threw a fried egg on it and added a tad of sour cream.  That seemed to make it somewhat better, but it still was just so-so even with those add-ons.

This turned out OK - the baking method with the enchilada sauce was nice; the tortillas were slightly browned. I just thought the filling needed something - green chilis or some kind of spice to flavor it more. This recipe could easily be adapted to shredded cooked chicken, or some other filling of your choice.

This meal was quick and easy to make. I served it with grape tomatoes with scallions tossed with lemon, cilantro and some cayenne pepper and salt.  It was like eating at a restaurant.  I think that you need more than 20 ounces of 
green enchilada sauce.  It is definitely a do again meal!

My family really enjoyed this dish.  However, I only used one half the enchilada sauce (since I don't like soupy enchiladas), and it worked out perfectly.  Gave the tortillas a chance to crisp up a little.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was "OK" as written; cream cheese and green chiles in the filling would add a little interest.
I couldn't find green sauce, so used Old El Paso
enchilada sauce.  It was good, but nothing to get
excited about.

I made it with chicken and thought it was good.  Added chopped green chilis and, at the suggestion of others, some cream cheese (about 4 oz).  I'd make it again.

This was OK.  Didn't have enough flavor for my taste, despite the fact I used the same green enchilada sauce I use for traditional style enchiladas.  My husband loved them though.

I was not real impressed with this recipe.  It was not bad, but it's doubtful that I will make it again.  It seemed like it was missing something in the filling.

Yummy - tastes like restaurant Mexican food.  I plan on making this one again.
