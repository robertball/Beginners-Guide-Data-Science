I made this the first time with frozen concentrated pineapple juice. It was nasty. I gave it one more shot with Dole canned pineapple juice. It taste much better but a bit diluted. So use less water IMO. I think you can make your own grenadine so that might cut down on cost. I'll try that next time.

Excellent recipe but I left the sugar out and added more pineapple juice and a very little bit of Stevia.
