Oh ya, this is a keeper.  I used roasted butternut squash from my garden instead of the canned pumpkin.  This bread takes very little effort to put  together.  I made it the night before and baked it the next morning.  Easy, easy, easy.  The texture of the bread is perfect, the crust has a nice chew.  I thought it was one of the best breads I’ve made in some time.

What a nice bread this is.  Really crunchie, chewy crust,  airy interior.  Beautiful.  I could have probably let it rise longer after shaping it into a loaf but the loaf seemed to be spreading rather than rising and  I was afraid I would de-gas it when I scored the top.  No worries though the loaf really rose nicely in the oven.  Follow the baking directions - a friend of mine who made this decided that the baking time was too long and  took it out too soon - her bread was a little doughy in the center.  This would make excellent bread bowls for chili or stew.  I would expect to get 4 individual sized bread bowls from this recipe.  Thanks Chef John for another 'keeper' recipe.

Delightful artisan bread!  It's texture is spot on; chewy crust, substantial bite of the crumb and the consistancy of the dough was beautiful.  I only let the dough to rise for one hour, and then continued with the recipe.  It's great plain or toasted with cream cheese.  Thanks Chef John!

This bread is very easy to make and it is wonderful!  I made two batches at the same time.  Going to make it again today.  It's good for soups, stews and sandwiches.  Electric knife makes it easy to slice for sandwiches.

Delicious! Everyone at our dinner raved about it. I let it rise for 30+ hours (didn't have time to finish it the first night), but otherwise followed the recipe. It wasn't as pumpkiny as I expected, so next time I might use a whole cup. But otherwise, it was great. Thanks, Chef John! I'm glad I found you!

I followed the recipe/video and this bread is awesome!  The crust is the best; it's crunchy and chewy and the inside is moist and flavorful although there is no pumpkin flavor to it.

I love this recipe! This savory yeasted pumpkin bread is a nice change from the typical sweet bread. It’s moist, easy, and absolutely delicious! Give it a try!

Super easy to make!  I made four separate batches...that made 2 decent size loaves and 4 smaller loaves ,(so I can share with friends!!)
But none of them took as long to bake as the recipe said..about half the time......maybe because I used fully boiling water in the oven  I wasn't sure if it was baked inside so I used a thermometer...Google instructions say bread is cooked if it's between 190 and 200 degrees.  I will make this recipe again for sure!!

Simple bread to make.  It has a nice earthy flavor to it, just be careful to add only a small pinch of spices to it!

An absolutely wonderful recipe. The instructions are to the point and the bread came out wonderful. I let it rise for about 13hrs initially after sifting the flour in, and the second rise was at 2hrs. I divided the recipe into two loaves as the other one would be a gift. It was nice and chewy inside but crispy on the outside. It would be wonderful with some cheese or spread after being toasted. Thank you for uploading this keeper recipe!
