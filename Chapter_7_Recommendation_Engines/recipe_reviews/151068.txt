What a great find! I used the crock pot option, taking 7 hours on low. I was missing a few items, so took a chance and replaced merlot with cabernet, and basalmic with red wine vinegar. (In other words, any red wine and vinegar works.) I also added about an eighth a cup of brown sugar. Sorry for obliterating the recipe, but my family really liked it. It was a bit too sweet after a full serving for my 9 year old, so a full 5 stars to you (since I was the one who added the sugar). On top of garlic mashed potatoes, a winner! We will make it again.

It worked great--I skipped marinating it and just tossed all the ingredients into a slow cooker for 6 hours on high (or even 7). Delicious!

This was very good! I did it in the crock pot and we loved it. I'll be sad when the leftovers are gone!

We've been wanting to try a beef brisket for a long time. It was right around New Years and it didn't make sense to try a BBQ recipe so we tried this one. I'm not a vegetable eater, but the sauce made all the veggies taste great and my boyfriend and I were fighting over them. The second time we did it we added potatos! YUM!

Great new recipe...however I thought the balsamic came through a little too strong but my hubby, who hates vinegar of all types, loved it.  Very tender and sliced beautifully.  Will definitely make again, with a reduction in the balsamic.

My husband and I both loved it, and it was really easy to prepare (at least, the crockpot way...)  The meat just fell apart with a fork, and tasted really, really good.  Thanks!

We love this one. I usually get a really large brisket and cut it into one large and a smaller one that I turn into a corned beef brisket I use this recipe by  Ron Brobst    and leave out the cabbage because my family will only eat cabbage in slaw.  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/corned-beef-and-cabbage/detail.aspx
I make this recipe as is and only change the wine, to a Cabernet because I just don't care for Marlot.

This was good, though after 8 hours in the crock pot, not as tender as I would have hoped.  Maybe it works better to bake it as written but I just wasn't around for the maintenance!  A bit too much onion for me so I'll cut back next time. I'd probably also add more carrots.

This was pretty good but certainly not five stars. If I made it again, I probably wouldn't make it the same way.  I cooked it in the oven for four hours - used a 4 pound brisket but it did not come out fork tender. I used fresh rosemary, extra carrots and I added some liquid smoke, I also thickened the juices to make a gravy. The carrots were delicious but the meat a little too tough.

Very good.  I didn't have any celery, so I had to omit it.  I used a 2.5 lb brisket and halved the recipe.  I cooked it for a bit less time, due to the smaller size.  It was about 2 hrs 15 min until I added the carrots and then another 1.5 hours.  It turned out very tender and tasty.  The sauce was good on mashed potatoes.  My 4 year old son liked it.

Our first brisket.  Thank you for the delicious recipe.  I didn't have time to marinate, but will next time.  I thought browning would be a good idea, so I browned half of the brisket, but the step was unnecessary.  I added all the veggies at the beginning.  When the brisket was fork tender, I de-fatted the sauce, added the cooked veggies and blended it all together for a super yummy sauce.  I got the delicious sandwiches I was looking for, almost replicating our favorite deli's brisket sandwich.

I made this just as written except my brisket was only 2.5 pounds so if I was to make again with 5 pound brisket I would double the liquid.  It was amazing!  I was going to use left-overs for another recipe but we didn't have any.

This brisket is packed with flavor. I made it in the crock pot, layering all the veggies and spices on bottom, placing the brisket on top of them, pouring the marinade over it all, and cooked on high for seven hours. I used 2/3 cup sweet red wine, regular vinegar, and 6 oz. tomato paste since that's what I had, and it was fine. If you want something elegant, this isn't it, but for a good, hearty supper, this hits the spot.

This was good and we enjoyed it.  It is certainly easy to do and has a nice flavor to it without it being bbq.  I followed the recipe to a t except used a different red wine that I had opened.  The meat stayed moist and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing.

First time I ever cooked a brisket. It was delicious! It tasted a little sweet, it must have been because of the balsamic vinegar (from Modena, the best!). This recipe deserves 5 stars!  I used fresh spices and Cannonau wine (from Sardinia). I chose to cook it in the crock pot. When the meat was done, I removed it and thickened the sauce with a  couple tablespoons of flour and cook it for 10-15 min more.  I then poured the sauce on top of the meat and ate it with a a baguette fresh out of the oven! Awesome! Will definitely make it again.

I made this with fresh Rosemary. I would suggest using something to contain the Rosemary so that you don't end up with pieces in every bite. I also wouldn't use tomatoes next time. Other than that this recipe came out very well!!

This is a great recipe, be sure to follow cooking temperatures and time or your brisket will be tough.   I added some grean beans that needed to get eaten along with about  5  whole cloves of garlic just barely crushed to release the garlic flavor.  Much like a pot roast its easy to change the recipe around.  The key is proper time and temperature

Disappointing! I cooked the brisket in the crock pot, minus the carrots and celery.  The meat was dry and the sauce awful. Would not make it again. The meat was salvaged by making sandwiches with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Dumped the rest of the sauce!  It even smelled odd when cooking.

I have made this recipe many times and it is so easy and delicious. The brisket is tender and flavorful.  It is nice to make it on a Sunday when you can smell it cooking all afternoon.  I add potatoes and parsnips to the veggie mix.  I do not otherwise change the recipe and it is wonderful every time.  I did cook it in a roaster on a holiday once, it was really dry, I wouldn't recommend that.

This was beyond my abilities to describe how amazing it was. Marinated for 24 hours, it was more tender than any filet or ribeye. Gives a new life to what was always a fairly tough cut of beef. The unique blending of ingredients makes for a great tasting entree you'll make again and again!

The smell of rosemary and vinegar was overpowering while it was cooking. I tried this recipe because I wanted something that wasn't slathered with barbeque sauce. Ironically, I had to use barbeque sauce to tone the strong flavors down!

Made this recipe for a Seder today.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand, so substituted diced fire roasted tomatoes with garlic.  It was amazing!!!  We had so many compliments on it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a hit.  My brisket was only 2 lbs, so I omitted the wine and the beef stock.  We don't care for the dried herbs, so I didn't add them.  I used a quart of home canned tomatoes, and with the additional balsamic vinegar, that was plenty of liquid.  Left it in the crock pot for 8 hours, and the meat pulled free with the greatest of ease.  The broth was delicious.

Everyone loved it.  I did toss in a cup of red wine leftover from the night before.

Very tasty, and I'm not a fan of brisket. I doubled the ingredients for the broth, added extra onions and a can of tomatoes, celery and carrots.  The brisket was perfect and I intend to use the leftover broth as a base for soup today. I will make this again.

The marinade made the difference.  Next time I would reduce the liquid a bit.  As several other reviewers have stated, I used a different red wine and oregano instead of rosemary, since that is what was available in my pantry.  I also used chicken broth and cherry tomatoes with some ketchup in lieu of stewed tomatoes.  I would not have wanted much more tomato in the broth.

This was really great! I used diced tomatoes, Cabernet and chicken stock because that's what I had. I also added oregano with the dry spices. Made it in the crock pot for about 8 hours on low. Thanks so much! Will make this again! :)

For the most part I followed the recipe the tee except for the vegetables and beef stock. At 3 hours into the roasting time, I added the carrots and celery,  plus a half cup more of beef stock and 3 midium sized yukon gold potatoes (quartered making 12 pieces).  The roast was perfectly done at 5 hours cooking time and while the meat was resting,  the pan drippings in a separate small saucepan made a great sauce. I'm definitely going to do this recipe again it wasn't complicated at all and the results were awesome!

I've made this recipe. It was okay. I followed this recipe and for some reason mine came on a little too sweet. I wouldn't make this again. I'm just going to stick to pot roast.

This was my first time making beef brisket,  and I was most worried that brisket would be tough.  I was looking for a recipe that wasn't bbq but was flavorful and where the meat would be tender.  This did not disappoint.  The whole family really liked it.  I made it exactly as written ( I did trim as much fat as I could from the brisket before marinating and marinated overnight in the fridge).  It smelled heavenly while cooking.   I served it with mashed potatoes- yummy.

I doubled the recipe. If I tripled the recipe it would have been devoured as well. Easily the best Brisket ever. Making it for Thanksgiving along with a little bird cause you can't have enough of this Brisket

A great recipe for a winning brisket! This was so easy to make. Ended up marinating for 2 days - don't know that it was necessary, but that is what ended up happening. Only change I would make would be to add more veggies. It came out so tender. Think we will use the left overs in tacos. Yummy.

This recipe is a real crowd pleaser!  I have made it for three Christmas dinners to great applause, even for less carnivorous family and friends.   This year we are expecting a large crowd and the reviews are encouraging me to try it in the slow cooker.  Last year I used the leftovers to make a fantastic hash as well,

I found the marinade and sauce had too much of a tomato taste but this is after years of my mother making dried up brisket with too much tomato sauce.  I would tone down the balsamic and try adding some molasses or brown sugar as well.  Very tender and juicy.
