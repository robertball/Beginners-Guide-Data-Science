We enjoyed this! I used Icelandic haddock in place of the tilapia, and just kind of eye-balled the vegetable amounts in each packet. The only thing I would recommend, is pre-cooking the green beans a bit first. It took closer to 45 minutes for the haddock to be done (thicker than tilapia), and the green beans were still a little too crunchy to my liking. Overall, a really nice recipe though! Thanks for sharing!
