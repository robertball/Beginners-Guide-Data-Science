As written these did not work for me. Sorry. Everything was coming along nicely until the flip and then it all went South. My breading stayed on but once they were flipped, all of the crisp that I got on the bottom side turned to a wet mush. I'm confident if these were not flipped they would have turned out great. After all, you've got the spray on the bottom and the top of them. Just my two cents. This is a healthier alternative to frying but I recommend leaving them as is on the baking sheet and no flipping. Less effort on your part too. Win/win!

I turned out great. I used Panko bread crumbs it was all I had on hand (it makes it a lil crunchier) I added more parm but maybe will cut that out. I crave this sometimes and now I can make it. Thanks for the recipe

I had to cook them for twice the time, and they still didn't brown or crisp. Some of the sticks still weren't cooked through, and the flavor was lacking.

Loved the flavor! Like that you can change the flavor depending on your meal.
