I used this recipe to make a "standard" pan of brownies. However, I did make a couple of changes:

Substitute Demerara (Brown) Sugar for the white sugar.
Substitue 2 Cups of chopped walnuts for the Peanut Butter Chips.

I used a 9" Round Springform pan and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes. Toothpic in the center still shows a small amount of batter when done. If you bake until the toothpic comes out clean, they will be over-cooked.

This recipe is the closest to an old restaurant recipe I used to have, and is a favorite of mine.

Substituting the mini-mini 1 inch cups expands recipe volume;the smaller size is easier for kids to work with in the kitchen!  Cooking time for the mini mini cups is approximately 12.5 minutes
Batter is very sticky - I used a chopstick to guide the drops into the cups.
