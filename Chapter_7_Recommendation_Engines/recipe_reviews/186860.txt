I searched for a Dynamites recipe to surprise my husband, who is from Rhode Island.  When I found this one, it looked easy enough for an amateur like me to try.  It was - easy and fantastic!  Thanks!

Some things I wanted to mention: Firstly there is no salt in the recipe, so you'll probably need to add some if you use salt in your cooking. I do, but the older people in my family don't want it in there. Also, I say 6 servings, because you can't stop eating these things, they're so good. But really, it makes about 8 medium sized sandwiches (or 6 really big ones!)

I personally like celery in my dynamites so I add that, and season my hamburger with salt pepper and garlic powder. Other than that this is a great recipe. Made it several times, serve dynamites on a hoagie bun with a side of potato or pasta salad and chips. Good stuff

These were ok, but needed more seasoning to make them 5 star.  The kids liked them a lot but the adults thought they needed some more spice to them.  Not sure I will make them again since we have a sloppy jo recipe that we love and find more flavorful.

3 1 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/186860/dynamites/ ... Hadn't heard of Dynamites till now.  'Reminds me of sloppy joe's or "Manwhich" (but much better tasting).  I added a half t salt.  Upping the red pepper would've been fine.  It isn't spicy, just tastes good.  Should I have drained the meat?  I was feelin' reckless & the recipe didn't say I should.  Well, I did what I could with that orange oil.  I will drain next time or mostly drain.  Thanks for the recipe!  A couple days later, I pressed boy, 19, for a review & got at thumbs-up.  Fair enough.  ;D
