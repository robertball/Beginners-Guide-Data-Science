I rated this a 3 because the onion, garlic, and celery flavors mask the lovely corn flavor.  Added an extra tablespoon of instant flour, and it still "wept" a little.  Very good warmed up in the microwave the next day.  I will make it again without the seasonings and will add either a little more flour OR an extra egg to thicken it up just a tad more.

my husband loved this. That's rare for most dishes that have no meat!
i've already made this 3 times.
i used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and i used about 6T of flour.

Absolutely super, very easy, and a nice change from the usual corn casseroles.  I am going to experiment with adding diced green chilis next, and will be musing over a few other additions.

I add a can of well drained diced tomatoes and top it off with a good sprinkling of parmesean cheese...I use the tomatoes that have onion, garlic, basil etc....But, with or without the tomatoes, this is a really good recipe

This was so simple to make and it tastes excellent, especially considering how little effort and how simple the ingredients. The first time I made it, I didn't have creamed corn, so I used regular canned corn. Having read the reviews beforehand, I did use 2T of flour. It was firm enough, but still quite moist. This one is a keeper!

I thought this was a very easy way to make a simple side dish a little more interesting.  I did not add the celery salt, onion or garlic powders, because I really didn't feel it was needed.  I also cut the amount of butter in half to reduce calories.  This recipe will be added to my regular rotation.

This could be really good with a few changes.  I found it to be super runny, too peppery and a little salty.  Next go around I plan to use one can of corn instead of creamed corn and extra flour to thicken it up.  Half the pepper and a little less salt.  Hopefully, that will do the trick and make it look like the picture!

Excellent easy recipe. Hubby loves creamed corn..me..not so much..too runny. This made us both happy. Hubby loved it and so did I. I omitted the celery salt, onion powder, and garlic powder because I didn't them at the time. Am sure they would make it even better. I only had 1 can of creamed corn, so I halved the recipe. Just the right amount for 2 people. Used an extra large egg and about 2 tablespoons of flour. Was delish! Will make again. If you don't have the time or ingredients to make real baked corn, this is a great recipe.

Delicious!!!  I grew up on a recipe similar to this.  I actually cook this in the microwave for 5 minutes, stir and then cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.  This is a staple at holiday functions and preparing in the microwave can help with overcrowding in the oven.

OK, so it adds a few more calories, but I add bread crumbs to top off the dish and spray the top with a buttery Pam spray.  Sometimes you just can't make a dish toooo good.

This reminded me more of what I grew up calling corn pudding.  I liked the idea that is uses two cans of creamed corn, prep time is minimal, good for nights when I am pressed for time.  Easy to throw together and bake and it looks (and tastes) like you did so much more.  It fits perfectly into my Corian pie plate.  We sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese while it was hot out of the oven and cut it into pie shaped wedges after it cooled a bit.  There was none leftover!

Based on other reviews I used more flour.  I thought it had too much pepper, so would cut that back.

AMAZING! I made this with our Christmas dinner and it was really delicious. I doubled the recipe, and I used half creamed corn and half corn niblets. So yummy! Thanks for the great recipe :) And I doubled the flour based on other reviews

I liked the flavor of this recipe a lot.  I used one can of creamed corn and one can of regular corn as well as adding some diced jalapenos to go along with a mexican dish I was making.  Even with substituting one can of regular corn, I found the consistency to be a little loose in my opinion.  I think next time I would add some extra flour and increase the cooking time a bit.  This recipe is a keeper though.  Good idea.

Loved this recipe!  I left the butter out for a lower fat version and it was still beautiful.  Next time I may omit the sugar too as the corn is so naturally sweet.  It does make enough for 8 however we loved it so much we had huge servings and so more realistically served 4.

I made a few changes based on other's reviews. I used 1.5 cans of creamed corn and one can of (drained) whole corn kernels. Also used about 4 tablespoons of flour and 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch to try to prevent runny consistency described in other reviews. I also used heavy whipping cream rather than mild. Sprinkled in the spices noted in ingredients list but did not add nearly the quantity noted. I also added some chopped green onions for color and flavor. The one thing I would change is that I would have greased the bottom of the glass pan a little because the bottom did brown and get a little stuck. It was a big hit.

I added 5T flour after reading the reviews.  Omitted onion powder but added 1/2t of dried minced onion.  Used Half and Half - it was too rich. Next time I will add a bit more flour - maybe the full 6T - and regular milk.  Also I am going to add only 1T of butter, or maybe no butter.  A nice change of pace for a vegetable.

This was not my favourite - I found the texture to be similar to lumpy scrambled eggs - the flavour wasn't bad, but it just tasted like creamed corn with eggs.  I gave it two stars because my husband liked it.

Didn't have any flour, so used a sprinkle of instant mashed potatoes and it worked great!  Great recipe to jazz up simple creamed corn!

It was good.  A little dry and a little too wet.  Hard to explain but I think I made it in too deep of a pan.  I would try it again.

This was ok, but nothing to rave about - too much butter, and too many ingredients for it to have turned out just "ok".  I would make one of the corn casserole recipes from allrecipes instead of this one.

This has a good flavor but the consistency is kind of mushy.  I suppose that's what you would expect from a cream corn recipe.  I used only one can of cream corn and one can of regular corn to make it a little crunchier.  I also needed to add extra seasonings.

This turned out perfect, not too watery.  I substituted a can of whole kernal corn for on the cans of creamed and omitted all the spices except the onion powder.  Very tasty and a perfect side for ham.

Watery, and I added some scallions to bump up flavor.  I think this needs a white sauce. I could not make again as is. Sorry

This was the best creamed corn I've ever had..maybe because I normally don't like it! I added a can of diced tomatoes, 6 Tbs of flour and omitted the onion powder, and it turned out fabulous...something to take to potlucks, perhaps:)

Always looking for another creamed corn recipe. My husband (an Iowan) never met a creamed corn he didn't love. One year for Christmas our boys gave him a number 10 can of the stuff. Try finding a way to use all of that. I think I gave it to the homeless shelter.

This is a good recipe although I felt it needed a little something, perhaps nutmeg.  I will definitely make this again and add nutmeg, a little more flour and skip the sugar.

This was a nice change from the regular heated can of cream corn. It was a little on the sweet side for me. Next time I will cut back on the sugar.

This got really good. I followed people's advice, and added more flour and less spices. I also topped with parmesean cheese. The whole family likes it, and it's so easy to make.

A nice change from ordinary.  I had 2 cans of creamed corn sitting on the shelf, so I made this recipe to serve with ham.  It still had the consistency of regular creamed corn, but the flavor was very subtle and nice.  Thank you.

This is a great pantry recipe with multiple ways to switch up. I agree with other reviewers in that it would benefit from additional flour and perhaps an extra egg.  I'm not Southern so  the butter tastes excessive. I plan to experiment and spice it up with a can of green chiles or and possibly smoked paprika and a few shakes of red chilly pepper.  You really could go sweet, savory or spicy on this simple yet comforting  dish.

This was excellent for a baked corn dish that didn't call for corn muffin mix in the recipe, especially at a dinner where stuffing is already part of the meal. The only changes I made were blending 4oz. of softened cream cheese with the eggs, milk, and butter, and also adding one can of sweet corn (drained).

This was great. I don't like sweet, so left out the sugar. Living in NM, I added 1/2 cup of roasted green chile. Served with collard greens and roasted lemon chicken.

I loved it and will make it many times. I made mine in a deep souffle dish (pictured above) so I had to cook it longer. I did add 6T flour, 1/2 cup finely diced onions, 1/2 cup finely diced celery, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, and 1.5 T jalapenos.  The celery created more liquid so next time I will add an additional egg and maybe a little more flour.

My husband requested this because his family used to make it. I made as directed and thought it was okay. Not something I would make often, but my husband liked it.

Very, very good. Great side or main dish with a salad. I didn't have celery salt, but everything else was followed exactly. Next time, I'll add grated potatoes, maybe a bit of cheese, or bacon bits.

My kids and I hate cream corn. My husband likes it so I tried this recipe. We all loved it. My husband raved. My kids asked for more and I had two helpings. Will make this over and over again.

It is Thanksgiving morning and my Baked Creamed Corn is in the oven. It is there because my family insists upon it on holidays. As a vegetarian, I also make it other times for the protein portion of a regular meal.

This wasn't a horrible recipe but the texture of mine didn't turn out very well. It was very runny. It tasted pretty good but I wish I knew what I did wrong.

My family LOVED this recipe. I took it to a Father's Day meal as a last minute thought, and everyone ate it up. My teen who never, ever eats veggies or casseroles of any kind actually came back for seconds. I used the frozen tube-like package of creamed corn. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. Thanks for a quick, easy, great-tasting recipe!!

Rich and delicious. Definitely not something I'd want to eat everyday but it was a big hit with dinner guests. I added some French fried onions to it as well as sprinkling them on top.

It was ok. I add some 1/4 cup onion to it, but it was too much and overwhelmed the flavors.

Delicious! This recipe is especially friendly for cutting in half. I added quickly dry sauteed red bell pepper, jalapeno and frozen corn. Great not-too-sweet side dish.

I have made this recipe three times, and my family just devours it.  I cook ahead of time, and after it cools, I put it in the refrigerator.  When reheated the next day, it's like a thick, yummy corn chowder.  So easy!

Very good!  I did not have any celery salt so I left that out but it still had great flavor.  I did have to cook it for about an hour and 25 minutes though.  I did not read the reviews about adding extra flour so I will try that next time.

Yummy-great for potlucks, everyone seems to love it. Didn't use celery salt as I had none on hand but flavor was still good. I will make it again.

The flavor was good, but it seemed very uncooked. I even added 6 Tbs. flour like suggested, and baked for 1 hour til nice and browned on top, but it was too gooey for my taste. I might tweak it some more by adding 1/2 c. flour and some corn meal. Maybe less butter too.

If you have any way of getting fresh cream corn it is a lot better.  Fresh sliced tomatoes are very good with cream corn too!

Maybe I did something wrong but I let this cook for over an hour and it still didn't set right and it was very watery. We still ate it and while the taste isn't bad, the texture was not very nice. I'm sorry.

Nice blend of spices and a great flavor!  I like a bit more texture and, since sweetcorn is in season, I added leftover corn cut off the cob.  That was just the texture I was looking for.  I'll try it again in the fall with some frozen or canned whole kernal corn.  Thanks for a keeper.
