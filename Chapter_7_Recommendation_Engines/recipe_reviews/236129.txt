I really liked the flavors in this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and made brown rice on the side which cuts the spice down quite a bit. It was not too spicy once you added the rice and in fact, I might make it a little spicier next time.

This was a really easy and great tasting dish. My new hubby likes spicy foods, so I added a tad more pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. I chose to use ground chuck, but it turned out great! Definitely will make it again.

I made it as the recipe called for (without the heat for my toddler), but it was a little bland. So, I doubled the spices and added more salt and pepper, and it turned out pretty good. My husband and I added some red pepper paste on the side since we left out the cayenne and red pepper. It was just like a spring roll but without the roll...which my husband doesn't like and they take a lot of extra time, so this worked out perfectly! I couldn't fit it all in my skillet, so I did boil some of the cabbage in a different pot, then added it as it cooked down, but I ended up leaving some of the cabbage out. We'll make this recipe again with doubled spices. Thanks for a good cabbage recipe!

This is so good and using quinoa really makes a big pot. I used the slow cooker

This was good! Yes it was spicy but not too spicy. I too had over rice (white), which I think helped cut the spice. We love onion and garlic so I increased those and I think I'll add onion and garlic powder to the turkey next time and I'll add more salt. I was nervous also about there not being enough liquid to cook the cabbage so used 2/3 head of cabbage and covered it while it simmered. I'll definitely make it again.

Working on making this right now.  I can barely fit it in the skillet. I hope it turns out. There doesnt seem to be enough liquid to cook the cabbage.

Very good and easy to make! I didn't bother removing the turkey and just added the onions, garlic and everything else to it once it was browned. I didn't have tomato sauce so I blended another can of diced tomatoes and added that instead. Other commenters mentioned they served it over rice, so I added rice to the pan and cooked it with everything else. If you do that, just make sure to add more water or broth for the rice. Will make again!

Iâ€™m trying to cook light, and this dish does the trick! I followed the recipe and used a teaspoon of salt as well as lots of black pepper for our taste. The dish turned out delicious! It absolutely has a kick!

I did not make changes. My husband is supposed to be on a heart healthy/medditerean diet so I am experienting. He likes hot sauce so we added extra cayenne and he really liked it. Goes in my cookbook!

Love this soup!!!   I used rotelle tomatoes which have pepper in them - mild has just the right amount of kick for those that don't like spicy.

Loved this!  Filling, tasty, healthy and inexpensive, easy & not too many ingredients.  I do think the onion quantity is off - I used 1/2 onion, diced.  Also, the crushed red pepper quantity is pretty extreme, I would recommend cutting that to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.  Leftovers are great too.

It was Good and healthy!  I'll make it again.  I didn't measure the spices exactly, so mine was a little hot.  That's easy to adjust though.

I didn't like it.  I increased the onion to 1/2 a medium onion sliced and reduced the hot peppers to 3/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. I served it with rice.It wasn't too hot, it had no flavor. Heat does not equal flavor for me.
