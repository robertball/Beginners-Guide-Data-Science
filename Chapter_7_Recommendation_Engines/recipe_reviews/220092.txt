It was great.  My wife was not feeling well and I made this for her.  The leeks and ginger help clear her up.  I put rosemary in the soup and added salt not that much just a pinch.  Will make this on a cold winters day.

Really good and it works. I cheated and used egg noodles because that is what I was used to. I also added chicken broth instead of bouillon. I don't drink milk, so I added almond milk instead but it was delicious and it cured my cold. I also threw in a jalapeno because I like spicy and i was really trying to heal myself..

Back story- I got a cold from a coworker, but since I run an office, I don't have the "luxury" of taking a sick day. So I went on here to find a recipe that was easy and had healing properties (like ginger) and I made this soup while being really sick. Sneezing between cutting the celery.NEXT DAY I was feeling better,less rundown. It was amazing and I decided to make it again today because I feel the sniffles coming and it is freezing out.

No doubt about it, this was delicious.  I did have to make substitutions, but I don't think it strayed from the integrity of the recipe.  I didn't have bone-in chicken to make a quick stock, but I did have enough frozen turkey stock and two boneless chicken breasts to use in its place so I just added everything in steps 1-3 to my stock and let her simmer.  I don't think it would be all that different if you started from scratch with some canned stock, or even bouillon cubes because we devoured the soup on day one, and overnight, the noodles soaked up all of the soup broth.  For day two, I made some chicken bouillon broth and added it to the leftovers; it was still delicious nonetheless!  I didn't have any leek, so I substituted yellow onion.  It may not have been fancy, but is sufficed sure enough.  The addition of ginger had me skeptical, but it added a distinct but subtle flair that I cannot recommend more.  Stick it in there! Lastly, the homemade noodles were incomparable.  They really added the homemade touch and I would certainly take the time again especially if my intent was for a comforting meal or I was cooking for friends.  Well done Shasty!

Seriously Lovely! Two thumbs. The flavor is complex but nourishing. I love the ginger added. I made noodles for the first time. Fantastic! Super easy. Dense but good flavor... maybe i'll have to invest in the pasta attachment for my KitchenAid. Enjoy!! You can't go wrong with this one.

Fantastic!  I made the recipe as is, but next time will use a pasta maker so the noodles will be thinner.  Next time, I'll add more salt too.  Also, I'll try adding rosemary, which another reviewer reommended.  My 13-year old daughter ate 3 bowls of this!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

All I can say is WOW!  Like other reviewers, I was a bit hesitant about the ginger.  It really makes this soup pop.  I cheated on the noodles.  I used Reamer's frozen egg noodles. Everyone in my house is sick, including me, so it was one less step.  I'm  SURE that the home made noodles are even more fantastic in this soup!

I used a whole chicken and placed everything in crock pot added 2 bay leaves and some fresh parsley once chicken was cooked I took ginger and shredded chicken and placed back into crockpot I left celery and carrots in pot. 

Made noodles and used my kitchen aid mixer to cut flat noodles and placed in baggy in refer until dinner time.  

I didn't feel it was necessary to thicken with cornstartch because the flour from homemade noodles seemed to do the job.

Great for a rainy day!

LOVED this! To save time I used rotisserie chicken, purchased old-fashioned wide noodles and used 'Better than Boullion' chicken stock, so essentially skipped down to step 9 :). And rather than simmer in the broth, I sauteed the carrots, celery, onion and added garlic in olive oil til tender, then transferred to my big pot of stock. Pulling from another recipe, I added 1/2t rosemary, 1T fresh parsley, 1 bayleaf and 1/2t. marjoram.  I also saved the celery leaves and added them, chopped finely, with the noodles during the last 10 minutes of simmering.   The ginger is a WONDERFUL addition, though I pared it back to 2T (instead of 3T)...gives it such an old-fashioned taste. Will definitely be making this again!

This soup is very tasty, and was worth the 3 hours it took for me to make it because it made two hearty meals (I should add that I took a leisurely pace).  I thought the ginger added a wonderfully unique flavor to the soup, however 3 tablespoons was a bit overpowering for us so I'll only add 2 next time.  Flavorful broth is critical to chicken soup and this is that and more.  My husband LOVED the homemade noodles, even though I accidentally brought them to a boil and over cooked them.  They had a dumpling consistency, but were pretty darn yummy as is!  If you have the time, try making the homemade noodles.  It was fun.  They come out a bit thick when you don't have a special attachment, but they're good.  My next attempt-I will try to keep them on simmer so they're more tender.  I also don't think the soup  needed to be thickened at the end because of the flour in the dough.  Yum!

Really really good. I had a left over rotesserie  chicken carcus. I boiled this in 10 cups of water, 2 bay leaves, and some white onions  (in place of the leaks). After it had boiled for about an hour or so I took the chicken out and strained the remaining. I did the rest as stated in the recipe except that I used store bought egg noodles (about  3 cups of dry). It was delicious and my family scarfed it down. Will definitely make again. I will probably double the amount of vegetables that is called for in the receipe. Oh and I had to add extra salt. So good! Thanks for the receipe.

Everyone in my house loved this soup, even the 3 year old who cried when I told her I was making chicken noodle soup tonight, because she haaaaaaaaaaaates it. My 5 year old says he wants the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. I did use an onion instead of a leek, since my grocery store seemed to be out of leeks this morning. I will use a leek next time, but the onion seemed to do fine. I definitely agree with the other reviewer that says do NOT leave out the ginger! It was amazing, and oh the delicious smells coming out of my kitchen! I will make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Like a lot of other reviewers, I was hesitant to try this recipe because of the ginger, but trust me, the ginger is what makes this recipe special. Even though I felt that I had screwed up the noodles several times, they turned out to be pretty fool-proof. I did make one significant alteration to the original recipe -- I used three times as many bouillon cubes as the recipe called for because I found the broth to be a bit bland without it (this may have been because the bouillon cubes I had were pretty old). Aside from that, this recipe is pretty close to perfection.

All I can say is.....YUMMMMM! Such a warm and comforting soup! My kids each had two full bowls and could not stop raving about it (even my picky "I don't like chicken" child).

My son is a huge fan of chicken noodle soup so I made this for him. I loved the ginger and the whole family loved it. I really liked making my own noodles. Next time I might use my pasta cutter but rolling out worked well too. The only thing I would say is, it is fairly continuous work for 1 1/2 hours. Also, I make a lot of bread and I don't think the noodle dough needs to be kneaded for 5 minutes. I only did it for a minute or so to incorporate everything and they were great.

I had four bone-in chicken breast halves so I doubled this recipe. I was skeptical. I really didn't think the broth would develop a rich enough flavor with just the breasts on the bone. I was happily surprised it was rich and deep. This is great because our local supermarket has good sales on bone-ins. This soup nourishes body and soul. I added a turnip and two parsnips just because I had them on hand. This is a dish of delish!! Thanks for posting!

I’ve made this countless times and love it. First of all, the smell is amazing. I will say that I have never made my own noodles. Throwing in some home style noodles is much easier. Also, when you’re done with the broth, I like to hold onto that soft ginger and use it with additional fresh ginger or powder, same with the carrot. I can’t remember if the recipe calls for onions but every soup should have carrots/celery/onions in my opinion. I also add salt because I like it. I prefer to get the giant bone-in chicken breasts, usually 2 or 3 and leave the skin on for extra flavor when making the broth, then obviously discarding the skin with the bones later on.

I made it exactly as is, and in my opinion, the flavor of the ginger was a little too strong.  I will make again, but will definitely cut back on the amount of ginger.

This is my go-to recipe for chicken soup.  I used a whole chicken, and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I added some ground ginger to the pot when the chicken was boiling.  I used packaged noodles instead of making homemade ones. I also added some fresh parsley at the end. I've made this twice and it comes out delicious.  You can also boil the chicken, strain broth and cut the chicken up the day before, then assemble the soup the next day.

I really loved this soup, and I can attest to its ability to help you battle a cold (I felt better by the end of my first bowl). The only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars is that the ginger flavor was a bit too strong for me - I think using a bit less ginger would make it absolutely perfect.

Very yummy!! I did change things up a bit i made my own chicken stock and used my kitchen aid pasta machine and i did add some parsley,garlic and a bay leaf. The pasta was amazing and the ginger was not  over powering at all! I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. I agree with suggestions that others included in their recipes: Rosemary. Next round I may cheat and use different noodles - the ones i used form recipe didn't quite turn out how I wanted. Yummy recipe!

Delicious! Good flavour. Added onions in, and used store bought dried noodles (alphabets and macaroni!) to save effort. Added more veggies to make it more chunky, love love loved it :)
