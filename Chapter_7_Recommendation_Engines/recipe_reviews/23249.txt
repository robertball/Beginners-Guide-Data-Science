Great recipe. I saw a review say they would like to see more vegetables with it so this is what I did; I sliced green bell pepper and sweet onion really thin and sauteed them with some garlic in the vegetable oil first, then I added the pork chops and browned them. This added excellent flavor and the bell pepper and onion complemented the pineapple beautifully.

I increased the brown sugar to 2T and used Hoisin instead of chili sauce. The flavour was great although I did overestimate the strength of the Hoisin and only substituted 2T, next time I will increase to ½ C. I let 5 boneless pork loin chops simmer for more than a half hour to ensure tenderness. Just before serving I quickly sautéed ½ a red pepper and ½ a white onion, both chopped into bite sized chunks, and added it to the pork. I will also add a teaspoon more of cornstarch next time as I felt the sauce was a little too thin for the ¾C yield of reserved juice. It really was an eye pleaser and a deliciously sweet indulgence… k

We thought that these were pretty good.  I don't like cooked raisins so I used dried cranberries, as someone had suggested.  I also saw reviews to double the sauce.  I used a large can of pineapple, kept the chili sauce the same and it was just enough.  I Also used a green pepper diced and an onion diced.  I cooked them with the chops and added the sauce to them.  Overall a good tasting pork recipe.  Thanks!

My roommate and I tried this one night because we happened to have both pineapple and pork.  It was great!  We liked the sauce so much that we ate the extra straight off a spoon.  Its so different from most sauces!  --We used cayenne pepper and added some orange-pineapple juice to make up the difference in liquid level (no chile sauce in the cupboard, sadly) and it came out fine.  We followed others' advice and doubled the pineapple.  Note that the pinapple absorbed a lot of pepper and tasted quite spicy (we liked it!).

This stuff is good! The only changes I made were leaving out the raisins (DH doesn't care for them) and adding onion and green bell peppers. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. We just finished eating, and I'm fighting myself to keep from eating the one chop that was leftover! Served with my own baked rice (the sauce is delicious withi rice) and Southern Fried Cabbage from this site. This will be on my regular rotation. It's that good!

My husband's reaction to his first bite was "Mmmmmmmmm".  We both really loved this.  It is similar to sweet & sour pork.  I also love the raisins in this recipe.

I'm  not a lover of sweet food but this was very good and the rest of my family does like sweet on occasion - we must comprimise!!!!  They voted that this is a keeper and it was so easy to make.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a large can of pinapples and added 3/4 of the juice to the sauce mixture - next time I might use it all since I found that the sauce mixture was starting to stick to the bottom of the pan at the end of 15 minutes. Thanks for the recipe Chrstine.

Good enough to make again, but something isn't right. I'm going to play with it. Don't get me wrong, it's very good, but needs tweaking for our tastes. 

To the reviewer, Amanda. There is nothing hot in this recipe. I suspect you used hot sauce instead of chili sauce, which is made by Heinz and has ketchup and spinces in it, but is not at all hot. DO NOT USE HOT SAUCE IN THIS RECIPE IN PLACE OF CHILI SUACE! That must have been a burning meal.

Amazing!  I made this for our Easter dinner and it was incredible.  The only change I made was to substitute the dried cranberries for the raisins.  I served this with some sauteed green beans and wild rice.  Best Easter dinner I've ever head!  This has become my new go-to recipe when I have guests.  Thank you for this amazing and easy pork recipe!

It was ok, but I do think it was missing something.  Maybe the green peppers would have made a difference.

Good, quick and easy. Only change I would make would be to briefly remove the chops from the skillet until the cornstarch cooks in the sauce. (about 2 minutes - the sauce will lose the cloudy appearance). Then, add them back and finish as usual.

The family loved these chops and sauce - thank you for the recipe!  I doubled the sauce, but omitted the raisins. I think next time I'll use a splash of teriyaki or soy for just a little boost of flavor.

We really enjoyed this dish, Christine.
Used  3/4" boneless pork loin chops, so I ended up having to simmer my dish for about an hour and a half till all was tender.  To the sauce, I added 1/4 cup of orange juice, a splash of rice wine vinegar, a good dash of cayenne and a pinch of nutmeg. I  used crushed pineapple. I browned the chops in canola oil, and seasoned them well with granulated garlic and both Lawry's Seasoned Salt and Pepper.   Like others, I  added a diced bell pepper, 1/2 of a yellow onion and sauteed for awhile; then added 3 Tbsp. minced garlic from the jar and a bunch of sliced scallions. Used  golden raisins, and along with the cinnamon flavor, I think that's what really made this dish. I was pleasantly surprised by how well this went over  at our house. Served with brown rice and mixed veggies (carrots, mushrooms, baby corn, whole snow pea pods and broccoli).
Thank you so much for this recipe, as I will be adding it to my permanent file.

Good.  My husband does not typically like fruit on dinner-type foods, but he actually liked this pretty well.  I like others added some onion and green bell peppers and though it balanced the fruit out VERY well.  I did make sauce for 4 chops but then only made 2 chops so I should have backed off on the sauce a little.  The extra sauce made the rice I served with the pork a bit soupy.

My husband thought this was "good"... which usually means, "eh... I'll be alright if you don't make it again". I thought everything tasted good together EXCEPT the tomato-based chili sauce. My 1 year old ate it, the 4 year old took enough bites to be excused from the table for at least trying it. Not sure that I'll redo this one.

Awesome. I'm not crazy about pork chops but this was the best. My husband, parents and even my four year old daughter who doesn't like anything loved these. I think this is the best recipe I've made from this site in a long time. Definately a keeper.

This was pretty good. I cut pork steak into chunks and stir fried with garlic, soy sauce and onion. Then added the sauce, pineapple and raisins and let simmer for about 15 minutes. We had this over rice with honeyed peas on the side. Thanks!

This was good, but could use a little "kick", maybe some red pepper flakes. Best thing about this recipe is how quickly you can throw this together. I served it over rice, and it reminded us of sweet and sour pork.

This was excellent.  I thought the sauce might be to sweet but it wasn't at all.  I forwarded this to a friend who substituted chicken instead and she thought it was great too.

Actually 41/2 stars. I had leftover pineapple chunks, rice and thin cut pork chops. I like sweet and sour but didn't want to have to run out for a green pepper which I like for the flavor but pick out the pieces. I prefer to make a recipe as described first yet I thought I had "tomato based" chile sauce but didn't so used ketchup and it was just fine. The sauce thickens during the simmer. The cinnamon and raisins added enough of a kick like you would taste in a ham glaze. I will make this again with a side of broccoli. Thanks :)

Made this as described and it was yummy. Not quite five star, though... Next time I'll use better cut of meat than chops and I'm sure it will become five star worthy :-)

added onion & green pepper & added the raisins on top of it instead of cooking them like a garnish.  It was a hit.  Everyone enjoyed it.

This was good, it didn't amaze us but it has a nice blend of flavors.  I did have to make a couple changes because of what I had on hand (or didn't have).  I used craisins instead of raisins, and some rum for part of the chili sauce.  Also I added way too much pineapple since I realized the can was larger than called for after they were added.  It still came out fine and we'll make it again. I served it over coconut brown rice (rice made w/ coconut milk), great combo of sweet n spicy.

My family and friends loved this recipe!  I added 1 chopped green pepper and 1 cup of chopped mushrooms to make the recipe more filling.  I used golden raisins.  I doubled the amount of pinneaple.  I added more chili sauce (mild red enchilada sauce), pineapple juice, and brown sugar to compensate for the added ingredients.  Thin boneless pork chops worked well with this recipe.  I served the porkchops and Bahama- Mama mixture over steamed white rice.  I also sprinkled shredded coconut on top for an extra tropical flair.

My Dad and I really enjoyed these, my youngest brother didn't like the fruit, but he ate the porkchop with plain sauce. I seasoned my porkchops with garlic salt and pepper before browning them, and also threw some chili pepper flakes into the sauce for some added kick. I served these with orzo, but next time I'll serve them with brown rice.

I have made this twice and my husband and I LOVE it!  I cut up the pork before I brown it so that they are the same size as the pineapple chunks, works better over rice.  I have also cut up a pork tenderloin and used that.  I leave out the raisins, or else hubby wouldn't eat it...but other than that I make it to the tee and love ever bit of it!

First of all, I really loved this dish. But, I did make several adjustments. I added a large can of pineapple chunks with the juice. Added a bit of extra cornstarch because of the extra liquid (I'm glad I did). Added the same amount of chili sauce the recipe calls for. After mixing the sauce ingredients, tasted and found it to be a bit too "ketchupy" for my liking, so added about 3 tablespoons of mild salsa. Also added some green onions to the sauce. I used 5 VERY THIN pork chops and browned them without oil, just used a bit of water to deglaze the pan. Also added some green and yellow bell peppers while the chops were browning. After adding the sauce, simmered for about 20-25 mins. I wish I had taken a picture, because this is a very pretty dish! My husband ate it all!!! I will definitely experiment a bit more with this recipe and recommend it to anyone!

Just made this and it is really good. I skipped the raisins,and the rice, I used bow-tie pasta instead. I used a chili sauce called "Maggi" and it had nice  little kick to it. Next time I plan to use chicken and rice. really good,thanks

I'm wondering how any one could have liked it. We didn't even finish half our meal before making something else. I thought maybe it made it wrong and a friend of mine wanted to try it..hers tasted awful as well. Will not try again!

In quoting my family: "these were good"...that's it.  Not bad, but I was the only one who took seconds and I noticed that my roommate pushed it around on his plate several times before finishing it.  It was a touch to "sweet" side for us(but my daughter LOVED the pineapple).  I was able to use 6 small/thin chops (totaling 1 1/2 lbs of meat), omitted the raisins and per others suggestions, used a larger jar of pineapple...which may have attributed to the recipe's small failure. It is a nice dish but I'm not sure if I'll make this one again....maybe, but not sure. Thanks Christine just the same!

I am so pleased with this recipe! It's not easy to please everyone in my family, but this did it. I must say, I didn't have chile sauce on hand and used a sloppy joe-type sauce I had already and it turned out great. Even my picky 7 1/2 year old liked it!

I am not a fan of raisins but i was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the raisins in this dish, i cook sweet & sour pork quite often and it tastes a little like that.  I had my in-laws over for dinner and my father in-law is a VERY picky eater and he actually scraped his plate clean and i was waiting for him to lick the plate LOL Thank you for the great recipe and this one will go in the recipe book :-)

Loved this! I'm not a pork person!  I  took another suggestion to use enchalada sauce instead of the Chili sauce...Yum! I also added a red pepper and some garlic to the pork It was great, and will be a new go to for us!

If you don't have chili sauce, I found that using an equal blend of bbq sauce and ketchup with a bit of hot sauce will work nicely.

I LOVED this recipe! I didn't give it all the stars because I did make just a couple minor changes, only based on the fact that I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I used fresh pineapple and squeezed a few slices to get the juice I needed. I also made my own chili-type sauce using tomato sauce, chili powder, sugar, and pepper. I also didn't have cornstarch, but thought I would just leave it runny. However, my husband begged for it to be thickened, so I added a few tsps of flour and whisked it into the warm sauce - no lumps and it thickened perfectly. This was just wonderful. I loved the addition of the raisins and the cinnamon to the sauce -- added a new dimension. Really good!

Very, very nice change to regular pork chops - served up with white rice and corn niblets. Only change was to add diced red pepper, onion and minced garlic during simmer.

Didn't so much care for this recipe.  Not sure if it was too sweet or what it was.  Might try it again, just to see.  Because it sure sounds yummy, so maybe we didn't make it quite right.

The flavor isn't very developed. I liked it, but it left much to be desired. I had to add a LOT of things to make it taste less like pineapple-sugar sauce and more of an actual spiced fruit kinda glaze. I don't know - it just wasn't my thing.

I browned some diced onion before adding the pork chops. Also omitted the raisins as I dislike them. The sauce was absolutely delicious (the sweet/spicy is fabulous!), so I ended up doubling the quantity. I think this would work really well with chicken too. Thanks!

I make this all the time and everyone loves it!!!  I substitute Mediteranean Curry cous cous for the rice and it is delicous!  Also, for the hot sauce- try Stubb's Pork Marinade- it's the best!

Very good!  I had to make a slight change since I didn't have any pineapple. I used mandarin oranges instead, and added some extra rice wine vinegar.  Also used the chili sauce recipe from this site.  I doubled the sauce, as was suggested by other reviews, now I have enough pork and sauce left over to serve a second meal! That's always a good thing!

I made this recipe for dinner last night, and it was GREAT!  I am a chronic multi-tasker, so the only change I made was after following the recipe, I put the pork chops and sauce in a baking pan in the oven uncovered for 45 minutes rather than cooking in the skillet.  This allowed me to take care of other pressing things without worrying about burning dinner.  =)  

I will definitely make this recipe again, but I think I'll tone down the tartness next time.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I think the next time I make it, I will try marinating the chops for an hour or so In the sauce before I cook them to get them even more flavorful.  Definitley will make again.

This sooo yummy!  I sort of doubled the sauce as I always do with recipes like this, used a large can of pineapple and almost a whole bottle of chili sauce, upped all other ingredients proportionally. Good thing that I did, the sauce is fantastic!  And I am glad that I read some of the reviews, as I knew chili sauce only as the very spicy Asian variety.  Get the "Heinz" as mentioned by a previous reviewer, it's perfect for this recipe.  My husband not only had seconds but thirds, and I couldn't stop dipping my finger into the sauce before it ever hit the stove.  Oh, and the pork came out nice and juicy as well.  A perfect match!

Was well received - a nice quick meal. I added a handful of chopped onions and 1 chopped bell pepper because I needed to use them up. I also used a larger can of pineapple. Served with rice. I will probably make this again.

i was pleasantly suprise how delicious this is. My family loved it, even my four year old liked it, which is no easy feat. It is easy to prepare. I do suggest if using a thicker cut of meat to tenerizing it first, using a mallet or boiling the meat. I doulbed the brown sugar and pineapple. I was skeptical about the chili sauce but it really make the dish (don't leave it out.) I used golden raisin. I also kick it up and added cayenne pepper and crushed red  pepper. Te sauce is so good, that I saved the leftover to use as a barbeque sauce. Try this recipe using chicken, it's great!!!

After searching for something quick but new and different to do with pork chops - THIS IS AWESOME - I followed recipe with one exception - I cut back by half the cinnamon. I love to cook "Gourmet" on the weekends, but am always looking for quick but interesting things to do on weeknights. My husband and son agree it's definitely one of our new favorites!!

This recipe was so easy and so good. I plan to make it once a week with chicken or pork or maybe tofu. I added some shredded carrots and I plan to try additional vegetables to up the fiber content. Excellent! I skipped the sugar and didn't miss it.

These were great!  I substituted half of the chili sauce with Thai chili paste and Whew!  Were they ever hot!  Next time I'll use about 3 Tbsp.  Even though they were simple to make, they had a wonderful flavor that is worthy of a company meal.  Definately will make again!

I made this for my family of normally hearty eaters.  I liked them ok but the family hated this recipe and asked that I never make it again.  It was awfully sweet and the texture of the raisins was a little odd.  Im sorry to day but I will not be making this again.

This recipe was so easy, and such a hit! I served it over cous-cous with asparagus stalks. Everyone loved it.  It was a little hot, so next time I may not add so much hot sauce. Also, craisins (dried cranberries) make an excellent substitute for raisins.

Great recipe!  My wife, the cook, used Tabasco Sauce instead of chili sauce (thought there would be no difference)!  Too hot for her, but I loved the substitution.  It is now my favorite dinner with or without the substitution.

I thought this recipe was great!!!! I did add a little more sugar because I like sauces on the sweet side as well as bake it as opposed to cooking it.  Overall, it was exceptional and my family enjoyed it immensely.

These were pretty good, if not a bit bland.  I would kick it up some the next time.  But the chops were very moist, and the sauce was great with rice.

The pork was a little tough because you don't bake it, the flavor was good.  Plenty of sauce but would like a veggie in the mixture too with the pineapple. Will make the dish again but will add a few of my own touches.

This recipe was a wonderful blend of flavors.  My entire family loved them.  I doubled the recipe and froze the remainder to have another batch later.  They were great too!

Excellent! I tried this recipe together with the Cordon Bleu Chicken. Everyone
in the party liked it. And they keep on praising it even after dinner. They all want
to know how to make it.

Definately a keeper.  It was sooooo good.  I sent the recipe to my mom the next day and she made it for her husband.  They both sent a big thank you.  The only thing I will do different next time is double the sauce.  Wonderful!

I should have read the reviews before making this. It definitely needs onion and bell peppers. We ate it but don’t think I will make again. At least not without some doctoring.

Yes, I’d make it again.  I took others advice and sautéed red onion and red pepper beforehand and added it to the chili sauce and pineapple mixture.  I used a pork loin cut into chunks and served over rice.

I made this using Sriracha Hot chili sauce which I would not used again.  The Sriracha sauce is not as hot as a jalapeno but it does have a bite.  I might use tomato sauce with Sriracha sauce mixed in.  I could not taste the pineapple or the raisins.  The Sriracha sauce dominated the flavor.  My husband did like this but I don't think we will try this again unless we use a tomato sauce.

A good sweet and spicy dish...I used fresh pineapple and added a 1/3 cup of whole cranberry sauce to recipe. I had chili paste so I mixed a tablespoon with 2/3 cup of ketchup. I would make this again.

This was easy, and delicious! I had 20oz pineapple chunks in the house so that is what I used for 6 boneless pork chops and kept all the other ingredients the same - I just increased the simmer time to about 1/2 hour - it came out delicious. I did not use all of the juice from the can, about 3/4's of it - but did use all of the pineapples. This will become one of my go to recipes !

We loved it! I did add a frozen bag of peppers, Trader Joe's Melange a Trois and sliced Vidalia onions-I sauteed them in garlic & olive oil & then dropped in the chops. After all was cooked I added the sauce. On the side I made a box of Zatarains's Caribbean Rice mix-this rice has pineapple & coconut shavings. It paired perfectly.

Great recipe.  This is a great combo or sweet/sour/heat.  There is nothing in here that I didn't like.  Serve it on a bed of rice and its heavenly.

I'm not sure how to rate this recipe. When I made it, I thought it lacked something. It was pretty good but I probably would not make it again.  Then the next day I had the leftovers and they were WONDERFUL!!!  I did add peppers and onions, and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. For chili sauce, I used an oriental chili garlic sauce which added just enough kick to it (maybe that's what took a while to develop its flavor)

Tastes great, simple to prepare.  I, too, used Hoisin sauce in the recipe and it was great.

This was a good recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed the twist the marinade added to our pork chops. Next time I will use a little less chili paste as it made it a little too "tomatoey." Otherwise it was a easy way to jazz up our dinner.

Excellent meal! Although, I had to change it a bit because I didn't have the 'chili sauce'.  I used BBQ sauce instead.  Still tasted delicious, even my picky husband said it was excellent. I served it with scalloped potatoes and Cole Slaw (for a change from lettuce salad).  The best meal this week, thank you.

My boyfriend enjoyed this. I thought it was ok. I used crushed pineapple and a mix of salsa and asian chile sauce. Also added chopped onion and garlic. I'm sure it would taste better over rice. We only had pasta.

Do not do this recipe in a crock pot.... I thought it would be ok since I was in a rush but was going to be gone all day. The smell was amazing when I returned home but the chops were dry (even though they'd been in the juice all day) and I think the flavor was lacking something. Maybe some salt? I might try this the way it's written and change my rating but until then...

I didn't really care for the pork chops themselves.  They were pretty bland.  Now the sauce is a different story!!  I made more sauce than what the recipe called for, and I'm so glad I did.  I ate the sauce over rice and it was to die for!!  I was hesitant about adding raisins and almost left them out.  The raisins made the dish.  I def recomend this recipe even if you don't make the pork chops!!

Well this is one of the best pork dishes I've found on this site!  My 4 year old said it's the best meal I've ever made - very high praise from someone who can't remember one meal from another!  But I'll take it.  I made it exactly as written and served over rice.  Just great!

Made this -- and WOW! What spice! I should have known better -- I could only eat one chop here, while my boyfriend devoured the rest. Excellent flavor, but the heat! I just couldn't take it, but the boyfriend did. Won't make again, if just to save my poor mouth, but not because it's bad. It's just too hot!

My family thought this was just ok.  I used golden raisins.  My chops were very thick and I pre-cooked them at 350 for 30 minutes in the oven.  They were very tender but the flavor didn't cut it for us.  There seems to be confusion over the 'chili sauce'.  Chili sauce is tomato puree, vinegar and corn syrup.  I buy the Heinz brand from the condiment aisle.  Add a few tbsp to ground beef before making hamburgers.  Yummy.

Delicious, simple. I used the thick pork chops and loved it. The chili sauce ingredient was kind of a mystery so we're experimenting with different things. Going to make it again tonight using Thai chili sauce. Yum!

When I make porkchops, this is almost always the recipe I use.  The sweet and sour sauce is very flavourful.  I even eat the pineapple (I don't like hot pineapple), because it suits this recipe so well.

It was good but we were confused about what chili sauce means. We ended up using hot dog type chili sauce and it was very good, however, by reading the reviews some people may have used hot sause.

Absolutly wonderful!! The only changes I made was that I used less brown sugar and half the raisens. I also added frozen 3 pepper medley. Everyone raved! This is definately a company dish. Also, make sure to serve on top of rice!

Overall a great recipe. For some reason my pork chops got tough even though I quick seared them and simmered on low. Also, the chops didn't really absorb the flavor. I will definitely cook again but next time I will marinate the chops in pineapple juice overnight. I also added onion and a sweet red bell pepper (sauteed separately) which complimented the flavors nicely. The sauce and vegetables alone are great over the rice for any vegetarians out there!

My husband and kids loved this, and I only liked it.  Part of the problem, I think, is that I used a chili sauce that ended up tasting more like ketchup.  I have a chinese chili sauce, that's got some kick, which I will substitute next time.  It was just a little too sweet for me.  But my kids really enjoyed it, and it came out moist and tender

I followed this recipe as is, and it turned out PERFECT!  The sauce was so delicious, my husband literally sucked the bones on the chops dry!  We ate this about a week ago, and he's already begging me to make it again.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It really is a hit here at our house!

Okay recipie, nice to do something different with pork chops but this was a little too sweet for our tastes.  I think if I add more chili sauce it may be a little better.  I used 3/4 of a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple because I didn't want chunks in the sauce.  Kids liked it, and I might use this recipie again when I want to do something different with pork chops.

This recipe was easy and very delicious!  I doubled the sauce and put 1/2 of it in with the brown/wild rice I served as a side dish.  My husband is a very finnicky eater and he said he would eat it again - that's a miracle in and of itself!

I liked the fact that it was very easy to make.  The chops turned out a little too spicy for my taste even after i reduced the amount of chili sauce by 1/2, but if you're one that likes spicy food, this is a good recipe for you.  Definitely an eat again recipe.  I'll just ease up even more on the chili sauce next time...

This was great!  My husband and I really like pineapples so I used a 20 oz can rather than the 8 oz.  I just used half the juice for the sauce.  I used the remaining juice and added it to the water to cook instant rice.  Also, did not have chile sauce, so I used taco sauce instead.  Turned out wonderful.  Will make again.

I made it with Chile Bean Sauce found in the ethic foods.  This added a little bit of heat to it.  My husband loved it.  He says add it to the weekly rotation.  My kids ate the chops but not the sauce, to spicy.

This is the sorriest waste of pork chops I've ever seen.  If this is the taste of the Bahamas, I won't go there.
