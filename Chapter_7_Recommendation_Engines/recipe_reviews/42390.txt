Wow-ee! These are awesome! I made three small changes and used whole wheat white flour instead of AP flour, buttermilk instead of regular milk and....I know it sounds weird but bare with me......oatmeal instead of nuts. We're REALLY broke right now and one thing I seem to have an abundance of is oatmeal. I ran it through the blender before I used it. Even with the substitutions I made, these still were stellar. The instant pudding mix in these was just.....wow! This is now one of our favorite "muffin" recipes. I can't wait to try this recipe with the nuts when we're a little more flush. NOTE: YES, the batter/muffin had a "custardy" flavor/mouth feel. That's what happens when you add vanilla pudding mix to a baked good. We thought it was great but for those who don't like that in a muffin/baked good, you might want to steer clear.

These are probably the best muffins I've ever had.  However, they're not the best looking.   I'm going to work on the presentation part, as the brown sugar topping has a tendency to run off the top while baking if you fill the cups too full.    This is definitely a keeper.

YUM! Definitely use the cupcake liners.  Mine were hard to get out in one piece even though I sprayed my non-stick pan.

If you are hungry for custard coffee cakes, make these! They literally taste like custard because of the pudding, egg, and so much milk! They would be much tastier if the batter was more like a cake batter. I found the "cupcake" itself was heavy and thick even as uncooked batter. I wouldn't make these again. Nothing like what I thought!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the flavor is there but the bread pudding texture just wasn't for us.
