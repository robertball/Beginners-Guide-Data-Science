A Enjoyed this bread very much.  It had great flavor.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is add more apricots. And thats only because I prefer more fruit in my fruit breads.

I made this recipe to give it a face for the AllRecipes Allstars challenge.  Very easy to make.  I took it to work and everyone really liked it.  A couple of people said that it seemed a little flat.  May have to tweak a little next time.

I was not overly thrilled with this loaf.  My husband wasn't either.  It was a bit dry and seems to either be missing something or the existing ingredients don't meld together just right.  Unless you enjoy a very lightly sweetened fruit bread you might want to try it.  Otherwise I'm sure there are better choices.  My kids would not even touch this.

Good tasting bread, but I had to bake it for 1 hour before it was done. I find the recipe too sweet though, next time I will use half the sugar. Instead of 1/2 cup raisins, I used 1/4 cup  raisins and 1/4 cup tropical mix dried fruit.

One daughter doesn't like raisins and the other doesn't like dried apricots but they both liked this. I didn't chop the raisins but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly. One word of warning I sliced this whilst still warm and it crumbled but once cold it was fine. Thanks.

I made this to serve at a brunch as a not-too-sweet addition to the bread tray. Everyone liked it. I didn't get 1 TBSP of zest from my small orange so added a bit of natural orange extract to the batter to bump up the orange flavor. I used more apricots so also added an extra splash of o.juice. My loaf needed 50 minutes in the oven. As an alternative, next time I will increase the butter by 2-3 TBSP to keep it moist, maybe add some Cointreau to the dried fruit and o.j. mixture, possibly increase the sugar slightly to make it more of a cake rather than a loaf

It needs salt! And Baking powder or soda or whatever one helps things rise.  It was flat and hard.  I can see how it could be yummy, with the addition of a few things.
