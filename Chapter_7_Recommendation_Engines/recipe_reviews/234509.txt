The combination of chili powder and cinnamon gave the soup a lovely, subtle flavor, which really surprised me. I used ground almonds, and cooked them in the butter until they took on a little color. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely. The almonds work some kind of magic with the flavor and texture. A really nice soup.

Wow...I can't even comment on the taste yet, although it looks and smells delicious. I'm a cooking novice so following directions is crucial to a successful dish. Therefore, I followed this one to the T. Putting the soup in the blender, holding down the lid and hitting pulse, as directed, resulted in first degree burns on my face. I didn't mind cleaning soup from all over my kitchen as I was more concerned with the blisters on my face and ear. Luckily I had on long sleeves so the rest of me survived. I highly recommend NOT hitting pulse but rather just blend on low. I also let it cool for awhile before continuing.  I sure hope it tastes good!

This soup came out so delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe called and am making it again tomorrow. Everyone in my family loved it.

not the strongest flavor, I kept adding cheese to garnish which added nicely (Beecher's flagship). I thought the almonds were a nice touch, would probably add more next time! I didn't have carrots but used a few small potatoes instead. if you make soups like this a lot I'd definitely recommend an immersion blender, makes life WAY easier.
