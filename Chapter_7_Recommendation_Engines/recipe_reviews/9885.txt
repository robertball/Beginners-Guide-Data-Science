I love reviews!  I was looking for a cookie that I could use to make ice cream sandwiches and with a little tinkering, this fit the bill.  I doubled the sugar and added 1 tbsp instant coffee to the water before adding it to the dough.  Also instead of rolling into cylinders, I just rolled flat (after chilling) and cut out my circles (dough was maybe 1/4" rather than 1/2") and stuffed with ice cream!  Delicious!

maybe it was just me and my kids, but we thought these tasted like cocoa flavored flour. Not terrible, but needs some tinkering . . .

This cookie was easy to make and had a nice texture, but overall the taste was pretty bland.

Couldn't see using 4 eggs to make 1 cup of egg, so assumed typo and used 1 only.  Added vanilla and salt and more sugar, but still very little flavor.  Texture very cake-like.  Reminded me of fat-free diet cookie like Snackwells.

A little less sweet than I wanted, but made for a good ice cream sandwich.

These worked out perfectly for my use, which was a cheesecake crumb-crust.  I wasn't looking for anything too sweet, just something to create chocolate cookie crumbs-which it did!  I warned my kids not to eat them plain-which they did(much to their chagrin). Anyways...thanks!

cut it thinner use slightly more cocoa + tiny salt makes it taste less raw, its supposed to be bland though its a wafer cookie use it as a vehicle for something to highlight

I have to say I was really disappointed with this cookie. I also tried again increasing the sugar (double) and still - they tasted more like flour than chocolate. The texture was perfect and they looked really good but sadly the taste was just too disappointing. sorry
