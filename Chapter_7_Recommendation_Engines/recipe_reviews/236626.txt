Very good! These didn't get crispy and browned like regular roasted potatoes but that was fine with me. These had a really nice flavor. I did add some extra salt but that was per my own preference. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I used 6 small russet potatoes. I added about a tablespoon of garlic salt. I cooked for 30 mins then stirred.. Then cooked for 40 mins. If they still aren't ready turn oven off and let them sit in oven for 12 more mins.:)

Used coconut oil. Love sweet potatoes. Tasty but the onion and garlic burned. Perhaps it should be added 30 minutes in or sliced larger?

Easy and tasty! Substituted a little Tony Cachere's instead of salt and pepper for a little kick.
