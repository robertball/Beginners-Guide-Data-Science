OMG!! These were the best. I was totally skeptical about how these would turn out, but I soo wanted to enjoy them for National Margarita Day. And they did represent beautifully. They were super moist, they rose nicely. I had to sub the Tequila because no liquor store was open when I needed the right alcohol, nor did my store offer Agave Nectar or any sub that I was looking for. After several AR foodies helped me out, I went with Triple Sec and I couldn't tell any difference at all. The cupcakes tasted of a margarita and I was pretty please! So pleased that I made a 2nd batch of cupcakes using Cherry Flavored 7-Up soda and added 1-2 tsp of cherry extract. I think, those were more my favorite. Topped with light store brand frosting, with a coating of colored sugar around the rim of the cupcake paper, and inserted a straw for added affect. My only nit-pick was that I'm not a drinker and I had to purchase a $10 bucket of Margarita Mix for a small quantity to put in the recipe, however, I quickly made virgin margaritas for my kids and it ended up with everyone being happy happy and loving this recipe and wanting them to be made again over Cinco De Mayo. TY TY TY!!! What a good recipe.

I used  zest of 1 lime, and substitued 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 cup margarita mix (instead of all margarita mix) to get more lime flavor.  After baking I poked several small holes in the top of the cupcake and brushed on tequila; that way the tequila flavor did not bake away.  Topped it all with a lime tequilla frosting. Tricky working with liquor to get the perfect flavor.

Cupcakes were light and airy.. But no margarita flavor. I didn't think they had a special flavor, they were just really good cupcakes. I made a lemon/lime frosting, which helped. I was pretty disappointed

They were good but did not have enough taste. I also put some lime zest into the batter then after cooked some tequila on top of muffin when cooling. Then used lemon icing put some tequila and lime zest in icing. Did taste very good but not like a margarita

I put a little tequila mix in my homemade icing and my so-workers loved them. They were really cute!

At 17 minutes - started browning on top.  Texture was a little strange and did not taste like margarita and was bland.  Probably won't make again.

The cupcakes were lumpy and flat--and they did not taste like margaritas.

I really really wanted this to be the bomb...it fell short.  After tasting the batter before baking I was excited but after it bakes the cupcakes lose the margarita flavor.  Note to other bakers, melt the butter indeed not just soften.

Great flavor. Not sure that I added a good vanilla frosting. Probably should have done a lime or lemon frosting instead.
