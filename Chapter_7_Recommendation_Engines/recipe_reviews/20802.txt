Sorry, this is a poor preparation even for canned tuna. Also, to clear up some confusion, there's no such thing as a vegetarian who eats seafood, because vegetarians don't eat the meat of any animal. Pescatarians, however, do.

I didn't care for this recipe at all... if anything it only brought out the fishiness of the tuna.

This was okay - I ate it all, but it was just kind of an odd recipe; I wasn't entirely sure the contributor was serious about this. I made it exactly as written, except for the cooking time. I used two small (3 oz.) cans of chunk light tuna in water, and one medium-large yellow onion. After 5 minutes of cooking, the onion was hardly cooked, so I probably cooked it for another 5-10 minutes. The onions "cooked down" a little bit, but I still thought there was too much onion; a small onion would have been better. I served this on a bed of no-yolk egg noodles, which helped round it out; otherwise I wouldn't have known quite what to do with this. This was just weird, and I don't think I'll be making this again.

This recipe can turn out pretty good but ONLY IF YOU CHANGE THE METHOD OF COOKING. Skip the water/poaching method -- that's just weird. What you need to do is saute the onion in some butter until browned and soft. Then, add in the tuna. Doing this really improves the flavours and makes for a very good dish. (good for on top of noodles or rice, or even as a sandwich filling, as strange as that sounds...) I recommend a little extra blob of butter right before serving if you are going to put it on pasta. :-) And a little S&P helps too. The recipe, as written now though, is really not that great, but like I said, with these changes it turns out delicious.

"Hollybear" tuna may be considered as meat to *some* people, but many vegeterians eat seafood.
Like the creator of this recipe, and ME.

Holy hay... Love, love, love this dish!!  I am a nut for canned tuna anyway(actually I use the pouches now!) and I always have it on hand.  I used to just eat it plain with a little s&p, but this is way better!!  Plus, its so quick and easy to make.  It really is delicious!  I like to eat it as a main dish with some sauteed asparagus, and my fave, Kraft macaroni and cheese!  (yep from the blue box!)  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this to be very bland. I will let this cool down and make a tuna sandwich with added flavors.
