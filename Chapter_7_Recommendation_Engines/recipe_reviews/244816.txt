This main truly was spectacular! Beautifully colored, incredibly tender and absolutely delicious.  As this was the first time cooking from this recipe, I did follow instructions/timing exactly and did use  fresh herbs.  To ensure I could follow the timing and not let the tenderloin tent to long, I did prep for the sauce hours prior to making the sauce.  I chopped the herbs (placed in sealed container) and placed the remaining sauce ingredients on the counter for easy access (cream exempt). 
Just prior to searing the tenderloin, I added 1 tablespoon of butter to the oil for additional flavor.  The tenderloin seared longer than suggested in order to pull freely from the bottom of the pan.  I was concerned the extra time would create a 'crust' on the tenderloin yet it did not.  When removed from the oven, the tenderloin looked under cooked yet a thermometer confirmed temp around 120 and after tenting for time it took to make the herb sauce, the tenderloin was a perfect MR from outside edge to middle.  I doubled the sauce only because we are sauce people and when plating the tenderloin, placed sauce both on the plate under the tenderloin and on top of the tenderloin.  Would not change anything about this recipe.  As a note, if you do not own a cast iron skillet, it may be time to invest in one.  Cast iron cooking does increase the flavor and end result of food.
Bon Appetit!

Excellent way for preparing steak! I made New York steaks using this recipe and they were to die-for delicious! I subbed 2 Tablespoons whole Lactose-free milk with 1/2 teaspoon corn starch in place of the heavy cream. So very good. We especially love the pan sauce! YUMMMMMMMY!!!!!

I was a nervous nelly, having little previous luck with top stove or oven roasted beef tenderloins. With this recipe and the use of a large iron skillet and an iron dutch oven, my six expensive little beauties were PERFECTLY MEDIUM RARE after a two minute sear in BUTTER and oil (butter added), followed by a flip and immediately oven roasting for 11 minutes at 425 degrees. Delish. No spatter, no smoking oven, no sound. Perfect.

This was outstanding! The flavor of the pan sauce was so nice and rich! I wanted to drink it like a bowl of soup! I used club steaks instead of the tenderloin because it was on sale. This was very easy. Truly a delicious steak dinner that me and my hubby enjoyed.

Perfect method and just the right amount of flavor in the sauce to not take away from the natural flavors of the tenderloin. It was fabulous! We served it with sauteed mushrooms and garlic and loaded cauliflower (also from this site). This is an elegant meal, at a fraction of the cost of what you would pay at a restaurant. We'll be making this one again!

These might be the best steaks I've ever made.  Might have to give up on my grill and do my steaks this way all the time.  The cream sauce is really good as well, but I may pass on that sometimes in favor of more traditional steak sauce.

Our tenderloins were not that thick so oven time was a lot shorter. Came out perfect. The sauce is unbelievably good.

This was delicious.  Only had dried herbs, but still worked well.  I kept it in the oven for eight minutes so it would be a little more done, since I don't like rare meat and it came out perfectly, just slightly pink and VERY juicy!

This recipe was divine. I only changed one thing which was what another reviewer suggested - add some butter to the pan for the searing process. Also, I made this wth beef tenderloin not yet cut into individual servings so it did take longer to cook. I think I will cut them first next time. Served it for Christmas dinner and EVERYONE loved the sauce.

My family has renamed this "Filet Mignon with Awesome Sauce" . Very impressive recipe that even a novice can pull off. I was brave enough to try for Christmas dinner, and even my Dad, who proclaimed before trying that he really just likes the flavor of a good steak unaltered, really loved this recipe.

I did add mushrooms to this dish for my husband. I also added  2 Table spoons of Cornstarch to the sauce right after it was finished, because it was not thick.  We both loved how it tasted. I also liked how I could use the sauce to keep the meat warm while my other dishes were finishing up.

this recipe is great.  I did make a few alterations only because I wanted to use up some leftovers from a previous dinner.  I cut up the beef into big chunks and cooked them to my desired temp in the skillet.  I set them aside and made the sauce  adding diced mushrooms, green onions and the herbs and spices.  the sauce was a little runny so I added a tad of cornstarch and it turned out perfectly.  will be making it again.

I only had chicken stock . It worked perfectly. No chives so I used a handful chopped spring onion tops. This could become a Friday night special.

Fantastic recipe! I had never made beef tenderloin like this so was nervous, but it turned out perfect. The sauce was amazing. I did add butter to the oil when seering and it worked great. Definitely a keeper.

Just finished eating supper. My wife loved the steaks, and so did I. I've made many stove top steaks but never the stove top to the oven steak. I certainly will do it more often now. I even used the Red Copper deep fryer pan I purchased a year ago. I was leery of using it, as I did not believe it was oven proof. It worked great! I set the temp at 450. Thanx for the recipe!

I made the steak, but not the sauce. Sear worked well, no sticking, and it needed one add’l minute in the oven

Loved it! The steak came out perfectly. I need to give the pan sauce another go as it was my first attempt and it came out too runny. Overall fantastic, will definitely make it again.

First of all, this recipe is superb regardless of the fact that many injuries were sustained during the process. I mistaken the beef tenderloin for my own tenderloin(if you know what I mean;);p;))#relateable. They were similar in shape, size, and texture so my mistake was very acceptable to my standards. I quickly called 911 and they sent me to a hospital. They diagnosed me with a massive . Thanks buddy :p

Delicious. Kind of over cooked the steaks because it took me longer than i expected to make sauce. Next time I will have all ingredients pre measured

I only had beef broth and not stock.  Only thing I would change is to a low sodium stock or broth, and perhaps less salt patted on the steaks before searing.  Otherwise it was awesome and out steaks were BEAUTIFUL.

This is a great recipe; followed the directions to a T & it came out perfect.  I did sub beef consomme for the beef broth - a little richer - & let it reduce a little longer.  Made it twice now & perfect each time!

Best steak I've ever had! Only made a few little adjusment- had to use Dijon instead of brown mustard, whole milk and a sprinkling of flour to thicken instead of heavy cream, and dry seasonings instead of fresh. So great.

This was wonderful.  The only reason I subtracted a star is because of the pan sauce - I really thought there was far too much worcestershire sauce in it.  Also, for me it took much longer than five minutes for it to reduce.  I love the recipe for the meat preparation, it's perfect as it.  The sauce is good but not great.  Overall, will definitely make again.

Excellent!!! Steak was melt in your mouth and pan sauce very flavour. Only finished in the oven for 5 minutes as I wanted it rare.
