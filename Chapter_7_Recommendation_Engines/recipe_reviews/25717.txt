This Borscht is pretty good, but it could use some modifications. As the other reviewers suggested, a few tablespoons of dill is necessary to make this authentic. Also, I substituted tomato puree for the tomato juice to thicken the soup and give it a little heartier flavor. I'd also suggest adding more salt and pepper, to taste. This should be served with a dollop of sour cream, plain yogurt, or kefir. If you want to reduce the fat content, let the borscht cool and skim the fat off the top - the beef shanks do add a good amount of grease.

Great Borsch! I was trying to find a recipe that is similar to my Grandma's Polish Borsch and this one sounded close. 

Im giving this 4 stars because, like other reviewers said, it needs that fresh dill to give it the right taste. I added about 3 tablespoons. 

I also used much more cabbage and beets than was supposed to. an entire small head of cabbage and 6 large beets. 

I also think this recipe would be better if using short ribs instead of beef schank, but everyone in my family enjoyed this. Tumbs up - im not an experienced cook yet and it was not too difficult to make.

Two spoons up! Chopped everything with a knife, and it took just a little bit of time. Add about 1 tablespoonful of dill weed for a really nice flavor.While the soup was simmering, I made some French bread. Oh, what a good meal. This soup tastes even better the next day.Highly recommend this recipe!!!!

A tablespoon of dill put this into the "awesome" category.

I had never eaten borscht before.  However, my curiosity was piqued by some friends who recently visited Russia and raved about the borscht.  So I looked up several recipes and this one seemed the most appealing.  All I can say is WOW!!!  This soup is incredible!!  It's rich yet it is really low in fat (I refrigerated the broth overnight and skimmed off the fat) and high in fiber.  The color is gorgeous.  It fits in perfectly with the way I eat.  I used my Cuisinart to shred the veggies so it was really a snap.  This is now one of my favorites.

While this is certainly a good borscht, it's not the best I've ever had.  I prefer a thicker broth.  This one was very watery.  I also prefer a stronger tomato base.  A hefty amount of tomato paste and diced tomatoes rather than the tomato juice might help.

The main thing that saved this from being 3 stars in my book is the beef, which I find to be essential.  The vegetarian borscht recipes I've tried taste like dirt.

It will be a while before I experiment with this recipe again since it is fairly time consuming (even with a food processor).  The ingredients also aren't items I typcally keep stocked in the house, which makes it a little more costly than some other meals I enjoy.

I loved this soup!!! I am an amateur cook and I was able to make it without difficulty.  It is a lot of work but worth it.  I am freezing the extras for a cold winter night when I am too tired to cook!

When I told my financee that I was going to make him borscht, he told me that I can't make it properly.  I followed this recipe with a few changes:  I added dill, and used only half a can of tomato juice, but used tomato paste as well.  I also added some potatoes since he loves them.  I also had to add a bit more water.  He loved it and asked me to make it again the next week.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this! I used a chuck roast and a few pork chops with bone in, since the stores I visited did not have a bone in beef shank roast, and it worked well! I will definitely make this again! What a great fall dish!

My mother and my grandmothers have served us borscht all my life. I remember it with big chunks of tender beef with sour cream stirred in. A large plate of wareneki, also with sour cream and fried onions and crackles or real bacon bits. It's amazing I'm not overweight!

Excellent recipe. Very similar to borscht I've had in Russia and the Baltics. Does take a bit of time, but well worth it. I also added dill.

I used all of suggestions about adding dill and sour cream. I also add extra dill and tomato paste. For extra zip I added horse radish. I love this dish and it's chocked full of vitamins.

I changed it a bit, I could only get the off cuts of beef from the supermarket. So I boiled them for an hour and a half, then added the beetroot.

I had to add extra salt and pepper.  Next time I'll skip the cabbage, tasted too much like regular cabbage soup, not so much like what I remember in Russia.  Still a good Borscht.
