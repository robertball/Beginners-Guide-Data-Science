Very good! I have to admit that I cheated...I do not own a mortar and pestle, so I had to improvise by using my chopper, which, of course, worked out great. My lemon was super juicy, so I would do 1/2 the lemon next time, taste it and then add from there, as needed. This IS super versatile! So far, I've used this as a dipping sauce for veggies and pita bread(YUM!) and as a spread on my turkey sandwich. I could totally see using this on grilled chicken or even roasted corn on the cob. I also like that this didn't make a ton, so it was the perfect amount for us. I will be making this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Thought it was really good....substituting 1/2 basil for half of the parsley.  Perfect!

I liked this pesto. It definitely goes with any grilled or seared protein. The nutty flavor combined with the regular parsley was an interesting and exotic flavor. I did not have Italian parsley at the moment, still it came out great. I will definitely make it again to give any meat, chicken or fish a restaurant quality flavor!
