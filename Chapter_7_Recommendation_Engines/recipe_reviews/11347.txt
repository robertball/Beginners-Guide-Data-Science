I have made this twice now, the first time I made it according to Michelle's recipe and found it to be good, but it did not bake completely in the middle (even after baking close to an hour- edges were burning and middle was not set) and the bread rose up over the sides of the pan... so I made it again with some changes and it was excellent- here are my changes:
2 eggs instead of just 1 and baked it in a greased 9 x 13 pan for around 30 min- more manageable size "square" (not so high rising" and middle baked up completely.)

This recipe has some mysteries. One egg is listed in ingredients but in instruction it says eggs (plural) I used 1 and it was crumbly so maybe 2? Also this is a cookie recipe?  It calls for a 8 inch sq. pan and baking time took 50 minutes instead of thirty. Maybe it was supposed to be a 9x 13 pan for cookie squares and not cake squares. Probably will not make again. Flavor is okay but needs whipped cream or frosting of some kind.

This was such a hit with my family!  I had to substitute some things due to food allergies (used olive oil instead of butter, rice flour, sunflower seeds instead of walnuts).  I also used 2 eggs and it made it just like a cake.  I'm planning on making it for my son's birthday cake (since he's the one with all the food allergies).  I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks and for different people- everyone raves about it and it's pretty healthy too!

I am not a fan of this recipe.  It is missing something and it took more like an hour to cook.  I would suggest using a 13X9 pan to cook it.

These are dense cookie bars.  My house smells great when I bake them.  I made the following changes:  I used oil instead of butter, brown sugar instead of regular, replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour, used no eggs, no vanilla, no nuts, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and baking powder instead of baking soda.  I baked them at 350 in a 9x13in pan for about 45 minutes.

I read the reviews before I made this, so from the start I added an extra egg and baked for 30 mins. It turned out GREAT! I couldnt keep my daughter out of it before it even cooled! Thank you for the recipe and the tips!

This recipe is AMAZING! My daughter printed out the recipe and has made it about 7 times. The cake is moist, fluffy, and really good without raisins or walnuts and with chunky applesauce. YUM!

These turned out very tasty! The texture is more like a light quickbread or a cake than a bar, but the flavor is excellent. I doubled the recipe, and actually ended up baking part of it in a 9x13 glass pan and part of it in a 9" glass pie plate (each for about 35 minutes I think, I timed until 30 and then just tested a few times until it was done).  I also substitued 4 mashed ripe bananas fir the eggs (other reviews had said to use 2 eggs, so I used 4 bananas when doubling the recipe) and this gave a SUPER banana flavor, which I like, but you could also taste the cinnamon, applesauce and the raisins.  SUPER MOIST AND YUMMY!

Thank you for the easy recipe.  I baked this recipe yesterday.  It was very easy to prepare, and easy to bake.  Nice in smell, good texture, and smooth texture not dry at all.  I like the idea of baking it with the apple sauce … just perfect.  My housband who is Danish loved it and said that it reminded him of similar cake his mom used to make.  I loved it as well despite my low carb diet; I couldn’t help but take 2 piece…. I will bake it again.  Enjoy ! ! !

As others said, the pan size is out of whack given the volume of batter. Needs at least a 9x9 inch pan or larger. It's a useful recipe when I have a lot of applesauce on hand. Easy to prepare but it does need a topping (ice cream, whipped cream or glaze).

Nice CAKE!  I don't see how they can be cookies unless you spread the batter thin on a baking sheet.  Anyway, I baked this using 2 eggs instead of 1, in a 13" round skillet, since I don't have baking pans of any kind.  Turned out great.  I was expecting it to be more like a cake anyway, so it was good.  Thanks for an easy delicious recipe.

I made this recipe with the suggested changes i.e. 2 eggs and 9X13 pan...it taste like a bran muffin...not the flavor I was looking for.  I would not recommend this for a sweet treat.

The recipe was excellent and easy to make. However, it says to bake for 30 minutes. It took 42 minutes for mine to bake.

I used fresh blueberries, instead of raisins; two eggs instead of one; pumpkin spice, instead of cinnamon; pecans, instead of walnuts, and dusted heavily with powdered sugar. REALLY good!

I made 34 servings to go in a sheetcake pan.  It was too much.  I ended up with 12 cookies in muffin pans too.

I definitely would use a 9x13 pan.  Also would add another cup of raisins, as I like more raisins than the suggested. Overall, good!

Took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 eggs, and a 9x13 pan. Absolutely good advice that is! I had no raisins or nuts on hand and didn't feel like running to the store, so left them out... Added double the cinnamon, and a dash of ground cloves... We all LOVED it.  Very MOIST and flavorful.  Excellent light cake texture really. Simple ingredients and easy to make, ready in only 30-minutes, will most definitely make again! (Yes, already have requests from the rest of the household to please keep making this regularly).

My husband made a comment, "I don't think I ever had applesauce cake".  After it was done, I got the thumbs up from him.  I did as others suggested and added an additional egg and I baked in a glass dish that was bigger than 9x9 and smaller than 9x13.  In 30 minutes it was perfectly cooked. I dusted it with powdered sugar and it is plenty sweet for us.  I used unsweetened canned apple sauce.

Very easy and pretty good although it took almost an hour to bake. 
 I like it better with just half the sugar. I also liked replacing the 2 cups of flour with 1/2 c flour and 1-1/2 c oatmeal.   I also baked my version for 1 hour at 350 F.

I followed the reviewer that used 2 eggs and baked it in a 9x13 dish.  I used my own home-made applesauce, which is a bit on the "chunky" side.  The cake was very moist, but not as flavorful as I would like.  Maybe more cinnamon?  A bit of orange or lemon zest?  Would be good with some cream cheese frosting!

This was excellent!  I used 1/4 cup more flour and put in 13x9" pan for 30 minutes.  Then I topped it with a buttermilk glaze.  I am going to make it again very soon.

Yummy!  If you follow the directions, you should have no problem.  I did omit the raisins (not a fan) and added a little more appelsauce which then you have to adjust the cooking time which was about 10 extra minutes.  The mix was nice and creamy and poured nicely into the pan.  I also used chunky applesauce which we prefer.  Thanks Michelle
