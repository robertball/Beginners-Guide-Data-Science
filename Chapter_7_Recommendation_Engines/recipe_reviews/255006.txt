Good taste, easy to make light dessert. I didn't do the powdered sugar because all I could think of was how good this would be warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. A little sticky to remove from the pan.

Easy to make and it turned out fabulous. Have no idea why some people couldnâ€™t get it done in the middle.

I made this exactly as directed.  The edges were ok and tasted good but the center was under done and gooey.  I baked it an extra 10 minutes...no better so threw the whole thing out.  Waste of time and money.
