I've made a this recipe several times but I really combined it with another one we like.  My two kids don't agree on very many dishes (one doesn't like chicken the other doesn't like beef dishes) but this one, they both like.

We started adding a package of dry italian dressing mix to the seasoning for the chicken.  For all of you who wrote that this recipe is bland, try that.  

And, by family preference we don't use cream of mushroom soup (my daughter can taste/smell that ingredient from a mile away).  We use a can of cream of celery or just 2 cans of cream of chicken.  

Also, we've used fat free soup and fat free sour cream too.  It doesn't seem to affect this recipe's taste to use fat free (that lets me add bacon to another recipe later :-}).  

Love it.

Loved this EASY EASY recipe! Who would have thought??? I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and during the last hour of cooking, added a bag of frozen chopped broccoli and 1/2 cup fresh, sliced mushrooms. I forgot to add the sour cream but we didn't notice it.  I may try it next time just to see how it tastes. Served with rice and the meal was complete! This is a great "end of a busy day" meal.  Thanks Leslye!!

This recipe is AWESOME. I took the chicken breasts out of the slow cooker about an hour before we were going to eat. I then added minute rice to the sauce and put the chicken back in, covered and let it cook for an hour. The rice turned out fantastic. Even my 3 year old LOVES it!

Wonderful and extremely easy!  I added a package of frozen stir fry vegetables and an 8 oz can of mushrooms during the last hour of cooking.  Also, I only cooked this for 4 hours on high.  I wanted a lot of sauce and my chicken breast pieces were pretty large, so I used 2 cans of celery soup, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of the cheese soup.  I tasted it before I added the sour cream (light) and it tasted great, but even better after I added it.  I also added some crushed red pepper to give it a zing.  I served this over rice.  After adding the extra ingredients, it needed more salt, so I added a bit more.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was easy and cheesy!  HEHE! I did add one can cream of chicken soup, and two cans of cream of cheddar soup to make sure it was a great cheesy flavor. I boiled up some spiral pastas and tossed them in just before serving and the kids thought it was a great macaroni and cheese. Good easy dish. I cooked mine for 6 hours and that was perfect.

I liked the ease of this one. Slow cookers are great tools for working moms. I definately reccommend using the breast called for as I used bone-in thighs and breasts that I had on hand. While tasty, the meat of course fell off the bone and the bone/blood juices discolored the cheese sauce making it appear unappetizing. Definately use boneless breasts! Also, I actually forgot to mix in the sour cream at the end and didn't realize it till the next day! Never missed it! Great taste. Wonderful over rice or noodles. Has alot of potential for adding personal favorites - like broccoli, mushrooms, peas etc! Easy for a novice cook too!

This was very good.  I could not find cheddar cheese soup so I added 4 oz. low fat Velveeta; also used low fat/low sodium soups and sour cream; added 1/4 c. white wine.  Will make again.

You couldn't ask for an easier crockpot recipe than this.  The chicken breasts were so tender, you didn't even need a knife.  I took the advice of other reviews and added one large bag of frozen broccoli and lots of sliced mushrooms.  Next time, I'll add sliced carrots as well.  Definitely add veggies for more flavor - - I think it would have been quite bland with just the ingredients written.

This recipe was so easy, and tasty. I add broccoli cheese soup in place of the mushroom and cheese soup to add more falavor and cut down on the salt. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic, pepper,  greek, and put minced onion in with the soup mixture. Served over brown rice. Came out wonderful and even my picky husband went back for more. Will make again for sure. Thanks

This recipe was really good and super easy. I used only 4 chicken breasts since I am cooking for two and wanted a bit leftover. The first day I served it with noodles and steamed veggies. Two days later, I shredded it up and made enchiladas. I just stuffed the chicken in corn tortillas, added two cans of enchilada sauce, topped with shredded cheddar cheese and baked for 20 minutes. Thank you for sharing!

This is just awesome and so easy! I made a few changes and used some ideas from other reviewers. I used 2 lbs. of b/s chicken tenders. 1 can of mushroom soup and 2 cans of cheese soup and I added a pack of dry Italian dressing mix to the soups. This cooked all day while I was at work. My boyfriend added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and a can of mushrooms when he got home from work and right before I got home he added the sour cream. The house smelled sooo good! We had this over rice. I added the leftover rice to the chicken and I think tonight I will chop up the chicken a bit and thin it a bit with milk and eat it like soup with some fresh baked pita chips. This is a keeper!

This was a fun and easy little recipe. I used cream of cheddar & chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, and cream of cheddar soup to make it that much cheesier. I also added shredded cheddar cheese. To give it a little kick, I stired in mild salsa (I would usually use spicy, but since my son is only 2, I didn't want to make it too spicy!) I also added green & red bell peppers and onion to it. I think a jalapeno would be good too, but again, I didn't want to make it too spicy for my son.  The salsa and bell peppers gave it a Mexican/spicy flavor which would be perfect for enchiladas as one person suggested or even just to put in hard or soft tacos. I just served ours over rice and my son LOVED it and so did I. I actually forgot the sour cream, so I'm not sure how much better that makes it-will try it next time. The nice thing about this recipe is you could take it in different directions with what you add to it and what you serve it with. I may add some crumbled bacon to it next time. Thanks for the idea!

I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 of cheddar soup.  I added more garlic and did add broccoli about 30 minutes before done.  I also only used 1/2 container of sour cream. Chicken was so tender and very good.  Would make again but try 2 cans of the cheese soup vs 1.  Served over brown rice.  Very good and hubby enjoyed.

I really liked this recipe.  Like everyone else, I did use some variations.  I used chicken breast tenderloins (I brined them in water w/3 tbsp of salt & 2 tbsp of sugar for an hour in the fridge), 1 can of reduced fat, low sodium cream of chicken, 1 can of brocolli cheese, a can of cheese soup & fat free sour cream.  I seasoned with 2 fresh garlic cloves, pepper, greek & chicken seasoning salt.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 6 1/2 hours, added brocolli florets in the last hour & servered it over brown rice which I cooked in chicken broth.  I would definitely make this recipe again.  Maybe next time I'll use noodles instead of rice & add different veggies.  Thanks for posting.

A new family favorite! even my 5 year old loved it... and so easy, especially for a full time working mom like myself. so creamy, and tasty! I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of whole pieces of chicken breast, and they were so tender and juicy! A MUST try!

Like others i changed the recipe a bit. I used 4 chicken breasts, 2 cans of a mixture cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, 1can chedder cheese soup, 1 can fiesta nacho, 2 cans of mushrooms around the last hour i added 1 bag broccoli and 1 bag CA veggie mix after i shredded the chicken. ( If you use frozen remember the sauce won't be as cheesy tasting or thick still good though!) I cooked up a bag of egg noodles and added that at the end. I have made it without the noodle and it was very filling. Make sure to season the meat before cooking.

I made one variation on this recipe by using one large can of Cream of Mushroom and one small can of Cheese Soup.  It was ok.  Definitely not worth 5 stars and honestly, anything that uses canned soup as 3/4 of it's recipe can't really get 5 stars.. IMO.  Yes it was easy but you could tell.

This was delicious! I did customize it a little. In addition to the soups already called for, I added another can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery (I have a larger crock pot)....and used fiesta cheese soup instead to add a little flavor. Also, I finely minced about 1/3 of a Vidalia onion and 1 clove of garlic and added that in, along with a sprinkle of garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to taste. I put half the mixture in the crock pot, poked holes in the b/s chicken breasts and placed them in, and poured the rest on top. I did 8 hours...6.5 on low, 1.5 on high at the end. About 5 hours in I added a couple handfuls of frozen broccoli florets, frozen peas, and fiesta shredded cheese, mixed it all up and let it finish. Served with creamy chicken flavored Rice Sides, and ate the remaining mixture as a chicken/cheese/broccoli soup the next day. My husband, who is pretty picky, said it was the best chicken he had ever had... didn't even need a knife. Very good...Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely fabulous! My picky picky husband loved it too. It was SO EASY, no hassle- perfect meal for a busy day. I took the advice and added a can of nacho cheese in place of the cream of mushroom, and it added lot of  flavor! I also added a bag of frozen broccoli at one hour remaining and it was a perfect blend of veggies and chicken . This will definitely be added to our meal rotation.

This is easily one of the top two recipes I have ever tried on AllRecipes.  It took less than 20 minutes to prepare - cost me about $10 to make, and was simply delicious!

I had it in the crock pot for right at 6 hours, and teh chicken was so tender it was falling apart.  The flavor of the sauce was very good and perfect served over rice.  I will definately make this again!

This is an excellent dish! I really liked it today because I didn't have any time to put into preparation. I used frozen chicken breasts, and I actually only used 3 instead of 6. I cooked it on high , and it was done when I got home 3 1/2 hours later. When I added the sour cream at the end, I also added about 1 cup shredded "Italian Blend" cheese to thicken it a little (since I had less chicken). We ate this with plain rice, and it was just delicious. Thank you for sharing!

One of our favorite go-to meals!  I have probably made this 3-4 times in the last 3 months and I am notorious for altering recipes, but this one I leave alone.  We like the mild yet cheesy flavor of the sauce. 

When it's time to add the sour cream, I remove the chicken and shred it and add that with the sour cream back to the crock pot.  We serve over long grain wild rice and that adds enough flavors to make delicious.

I made this last weekend and my husband loved it! I took the advice of others here and added veg- peas and sliced mushrooms- during the last hour. I also used the cream of mushroom and roasted garlic for some added garlic punch. 

This recipe is super versatile. Next time I'll be adding more veg. I'll probably also decrease the cooking time (from 6.5 hours) because my chicken tenderloins were actually a bit dry! This may have to do with the fact that I used tenderloins which are smaller and a bigger crockpot, so the mixture was pretty shallow.

This tastes just like one of my favorite dishes from a Mexican restaurant. It was also very easy to make. Next time I might try shredding the chicken into a tortilla.

This was very simple and absolutely delicious.  I did make a few changes, but nothing major.  We don't use mushrooms or mushroom products due to our picky eater and our grocery store was out of cheese soup, so I used 2 cans of broccoli cheese soup and one can of cream of chicken.  I also added half a bag of frozen veggies to the mix about 2 hours before it was done.  6 chicken breasts are a little too much for my family, but I added an extra breast or two and then shredded the left over chicken in the cheese sauce.  Then I added a package of taco seasoning and put it in the fridge and we had chicken tacos the next day.  They were almost better than the original dish!!  I love multipurpose dishes!!  This is going in my recipe box!

Could only give it three stars, felt it was way too salty.  Will make again, but using the low sodium soups, if possible.

I thought it was decent but not lip smacking or anything.  My boys liked it and they tend to be less adventurous in their foods than me.  I seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning.  I also added sage to the soups to give it some savory.  I added a bag of frozen broccoli during the last hour like many reviewers suggested.  Served over rice.

I've made this dish a second time and I have to say - it's not that great. I tried to fix up the chicken so it tasted better than it did the first time by grilling it and cutting it then adding it to the sauce with rice, but it still didn't turn out so great. This is my last time making this dish. Now I have to figure out what to do with my extra cans of soup.

This was delicious, I steamed some broccoli, chopped it up and put it in with the chicken 1/2 hour before it was done.  I served it all over rice.  My husband LOVED it.  I would totally make it again.

This is a great recipe.  The chicken came out very juicy and tender and full of flavor.  Just a little bit salty.  I forgot the sour cream, but it didn't matter.  My husband still went back for seconds...would have went back for thirds but I didn't make enough.  It was just that good!!!! Will definately be making this one again soon.

We did not really like this meal. All of the soups made it very rich but not a lot of flavor. As others indicated, be prepared to pair it with rice or pasta.  I threw a chopped onion in when I put it on in the morning and I probably should have added another one because it least that added some texture and flavor. If I ever make it again I will make more adjustments like adding the brocoli others reccomended, adding 2 onions, and maybe even removing one of the soups all together.  Not a hit at my house at all. As a matter of fact, my husband didn't finish his and he ALWAYS goes back for seconds.

Good, but not overly flavorful.  Made leftovers into enchiladas with extra shredded cheese and green chile and that was much more tasty.

I made this recipe as it was written and from the others reviews, I chose to add the frozen cut broccoli an hour before serving. Serve over lightly buttered noodles and it was delicious! This family of 6 loved it!

The family really liked this. I served it over tortellini and they gobbled it up.  Even the picky one. I put the boneless, skinless, chicken breasts in frozen. Used fat free soup on two of the soups. I sprinkled Italian dressing mix on top of the chicken like so many have suggested. I think that really made the difference.  I used  1/2 teaspoon *California Garlic Salt* instead of salt and the garlic powder. I HAVE to give it 5 stars because it was sooooo easy to fix and my family loved it.  *I love California Garlic Salt. A friend suggested it to me and now I am never without it in my kitchen. Look for it in the spice aisle. I use it in my salsa and in every recipe that calls for garlic salt.

If I could give this recipe six stars, I would! It is soooo easy to make and tastes great. Everyone I have ever fed it to loves it and wants more (and the recipe). The "soup sauce" is warm, creamy and good tasting". I used two cans of cream of chicken soup, 2 cans of Cheddar soup and a bit more sour cream. The chicken is always moist, tender and tasty. Served over a bed of rice, it's the perfect feel good, cold day, easy made comfort food!

Reminds me of stroganoaf.  Could use some more flavor but still very good.  I did make some changes due to trying to loose weight and I thought that I would pass it on.  I did forget the 8 oz fat free sour cream, will try it next time.

*24 oz boneless skinless chicken breast (cut up / all fat removed)
*pepper & garlic powder to taste/omit salt as there is plenty of salt in the canned soup
*1- 10.75 oz can condensed cream of chicken soup (used Healthy Choice 98% fat free/30% less sodium)
*1- 10.75 oz can condensed cream of mushroom soup (used Healthy Choice 98% fat free/30% less sodium)
*1- 11.0 oz can condensed cream of Cheddar Cheese Soup

I had this in the crock pot for 5 hours (it cooked through without burning-I did stir a few times during those 5 hours)
I added the following:
*1- 12 bag rotelle pasta (cooked seperate) mixed together when done
*2- 16 oz bags frozen broccoli (cooked seperate) mixed toegether when done

This is even better if you sub the cream of mushroom soup for an extra can of cheese soup, and season the chicken with a packet of taco seasoning instead of the garlic, salt and pepper. Then when it's done in the crockpot, take the chicken out, shred it, and mix it back in along with the sour cream. Put the chicken and sauce into large burrito-sized tortillas, sprinkle cheddar cheese and enchilada sauce on top, and heat in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes (just enough to melt the cheese and warm everything through). It is DELICIOUS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I found that serving the chicken over noodles wasn't the best idea for us....like another reviewer I think I will use mashed potatoes as a side dish.  The only thing I found was that it was a bit salty....but I will definately make this again.

This recipe was so good and easy...it made me look like a good cook (it's pretty hard to mess this one up)!!  I threw some green peppers and mushrooms in there...but next time I will sauté them and put them in towards the end.

Pretty good.  I didn't add any extra salt being that the soup has enough in it on its own.  Also, I mistakenly skipped adding the sour cream at the end and it tasted great without it!

Delicious! I took some others advice and added the dry Italian dressing in as a seasoning for the chicken and added broccoli one hour before I was ready to serve. Very flavorful and easy to make.

My husband said this was amazing!! i thought it was very good as well and extremely easy...i couldn't find the cheese soup so i used campbells fiesta nacho cheese from the can and it worked great. i think this also helped solve the "bland" problem many people ran into. i followed others advice & added some crushed red pepper flakes as well. a dash or two of tony's seasoning and it turned out great. i cooked about 1 1/2 hrs on high and 3 hrs on low. my husband despises sour cream so i left it out and we didn't even miss it. i also added some fresh mushrooms since my husband likes them. i served it over small shell pasta with crossaint rolls. :) and even better i made more than this recipe called for and i used the left overs the next day to make chicken enchiladas and they were excellent and quick.

Take a ho-hum dish and make it special by adding flavor and and some kick. Simply replace the Cheddar cheese soup with a can of Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup. What a difference!

I seasoned the chicken with Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt, Papmered Chef rosemary seasoning, pepper and garlic powder.  I used 2 cans cream of chicken (little one doesn't like mushrooms) and 1 can cheddar cheese soup.  Forgot all about the sour cream.  Served over rice. DELICIOUS!

I read many of the reviews, and decided to try this recipe as-is.  I have to say that it was an appropriate dish for kids maybe 10 and under, but not for me and my boyfriend.  It was bland and boring.  I will not be making this one again.

Was very bland if made as is.  HOW TO MAKE IT FIVE STARS:  Add a packet of Italian Seasoning Mix when you mix in the cream soups.  The soups I used were cheddar cheese, mushroom, and chicken.  A half hour before serving time, I stirred in the sour cream PLUS A CUP OF SHREDDED CHEDDAR.  And some frozen broccoli, peas, and carrots.  Served over creamy mashed potatoes. The chicken was tasty and tender and I agreed when hubby said "Mmm, this is really good!"

This recipe is great exactly the way it is written, and has so much room for variation I can make it several times a month and we don't get bored. My favorite way to serve this is to add frozen broccoli to the sauce after cooking, let it cook on high for an extra hour without the chicken, and serve the chicken under the broccoli sauce with rice. Subbing an extra cheese soup for the mushroom is another great option, serving with pasta and sometimes even more cheese soup on top. I usually don't use the mushroom opting for cream of celery instead, but often it's whatever canned cream soups I want to use up first and I've enjoyed it every time. The chicken breast is pull-apart tender even if you throw them in frozen. I always add the sour cream because it tempers the salty soup taste of the sauce and makes it much more smooth and creamy. I don't think it's bland, but then I am able to appreciate a dish without adding half my spice cabinet so some of you may need to amp it up. Thanks so much to the submitter for sharing :)

So easy!  I used one can each of cream of chicken, cream of celery and cheddar.  I threw a packet of dry Italian dressing mix into the soup mixture.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  After I cooked it on low for 8 hours, I shredded the chicken, added  the sour cream and stirred in a whole bag of cooked egg noodles.  Yum!

5 Huge Stars!!! Especially after reading some of the comments about the seasoning. First of all, I only used 2 chicken breasts since we're not big meat eaters. I used 1 can of cream of chicken, and 2 cans of cheddar. I doubled the garlic powder, and added a whole package of fat free Italian dressing seasoning. I had the chicken thawed and just threw it all into the crockpot! Some people noted that the cooking time was too long, but mine came out perfect at around 8 hours. Plenty of sauce to serve on top (probably because I only used 2 breasts), and as others noted I served it over spaghetti noodles. Everyone loved it, and my daughter asked if we could have it every night!!! Thanks to everyone for your tips on making this one of the easiest and flavorful recipes.

This was quite good.  I changed a couple of things to suit my husband's taste (I'm a vegetarian).  First of all I used cream of celery instead of mushroom (hubby doesn't like cream of mushroom).  I also used cream of chicken with herbs instead of plain chicken.  I also marinated the chicken until I was ready to use it (a few days) in a dry rub consisting of paprika, onion and garlic powders, salt and pepper.  And I added those spices to the soup mix as well, including some fresh dried basil.  Served it over homemade buttery mashed potatoes.  Husband loved it.

Great recipe!  I also substituted broccoli cheese soup for the cream of mushroom and left out the sour cream.  My husband raved over this, and he's a picky eater!

Recently made this for company and it was a bit hit.  Substituted Cream of Chicken Dijon for the plain Cream of Chicken and it added a little more flavor.  Also added frozen broccoli florets for the last 1 1/2 hours.  Served with mashed potatoes this time and preferred them over rice or noodles.

We liked this.  The sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it was going to be.  I served it with pasta which was fine, but I think next time I will try it with mashed potatoes.  It was a very quick and easy recipe.  I didn't bother rinsing and patting the chicken dry.  I would try this again.

Added green onions, mushrooms and an extra can of mushroom soup towards the end for more gravy.  Served on egg noodles and made it for 5 and had at least one large serving left.  Everyone loved it, but next time I might add the fiesta nacho soup to add a bit more zing.

Very good! Passed the taste test with all my kids, even the picky eaters. Oops, I forgot to add the sour cream too. Didn't spoil the rave review from the family. I added cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom. I added soups, frozen chicken breasts, sprinkled with seasonings and I let it cook on low 11hrs. Chicken was very moist. We will definately have it again.

Pretty good and easy. I made it with chicken thighs and left it for 8 hours, chicken was practically disintegrating it was really good. Served over pasta and steamed broccoli. I didn't add the sour cream (forgot) and it didn't seem to negatively effect it.

This meal is GREAT. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out FANTASTIC. Since I now live alone, I only add the sour cream to the bowl that I'm eating. I did add some egg noodles to my meal (per another comment on here) but I didn't change the recipe at all. With or without the egg noodles, the meal turned out GREAT.

Yeah, probably a 4-star recipe.  It wasn't the BEST meal I've ever had, but it was good and fast for a busy day.  I'll probably make it again.  I made rice and noodles to see which one we liked better.  I liked the noodles, my husband liked the rice.  :)

My husband loved this. I changed it a little based on what I had in the pantry: 2 cans cream of chicken, 2 cans cream of cheddar cheese soup, and the rest of the ingredients listed. I  forgot to add the sour cream but like everyone else said, it didn't even need it. Wonderful! It cooked all 12 hours while I was at work and was perfect.

I thought this was delicious! My husband really liked it, too, neither of us considered it bland like some of the reviews mentioned. I usually shy away from recipes using canned soups since the nutritional content really isn't the best, but this is a GREAT recipe for the days I don't have much time to cook. Prep took less than 5 minutes using frozen chicken breasts. I will definitely make again!

Mixed reviews at our home, but I think the "likes" out numbered the "dislikes" by one.  This was easy to make and tasty so I personally give it a thumbs up

This was a very easy, great-tasting recipe. To prevent being bland I just added my normal spices (chopped garlic, S&P, oregano, cilantro). A great flavor over a bed of egg noodles.

A very quick and easy dump in the crockpot recipe - my favorite kind!  It doesn't get 5 stars only because it's not high on the best things I've ever eaten list, but it's a great recipe!

Love it, I only switched the cream of mushroom with cream of celery since my husband hates cream of mushrooms. Came out perfectly! Do season the chicken well, rub in your salt, pepper and whatever other dry herbs and spices you like for a flavorfull dish!

Pretty good and fairly easy.  However, next time I will add fresh cloves of garlic for added flavor.  It isn't a bland dish, there's just something missing...

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the original was much too bland. After reading the reviews, I decided to start off doing this recipe by adding half a packet of Italian dressing mix. Unfortunately, I shouldn't have added any extra salt because the Italian seasoning. To fix the sauce's saltiness, I added sour cream until it tasted just right. I also added a little less than 2 tablespoons of "oh so garlic" which is a mix of spices you can find at your grocery store. Tip* Even if you're making only two chicken breasts, still use the same amount of creamed soups so that the chicken can be fully covered. Now, I don't like mushrooms but did use the cream of mushroom just for variety (I didn't taste mushrooms at all). I served this atop of fried rice (Which the sauce added wonderful flavor to). If you have left overs, grab some tortillas, shred the chicken, add some black beans, shredded cheese and you have burritos!

This was soo delicious! I made it in the crockpot using 8 chicken tenders and mixed the end result with rice and it was so fantastic! My picky 2yr old son ate every bite and I've been eating the leftovers for 2 days now. My only tip is that it is better on rice than noodles because of how thin the sauce is at the end. Mix the pre cooked rice into the crockpot after the sour cream and let it sit for 10 minutes. PERFECT! 5 stars!

Oh my!  So so good!  Here's how to make this a 5 star recipe: 1) season chicken with the recommended garlic, some garlic red pepper, and a bit of cayenne pepper. 2) add a package of Italian dressing mix to the soups. 3) substitute 12oz Mexican velveeta cheese for the cheese soup. 4) add some frozen broccoli for the last hour of cooking

This was surprisingly good!  Was looking for a super simple dinner for the family because I was not motivated to cook up a big meal! This fit the bill, and then some! Like other reviewers, subbed different soups because it's all I had on hand: 1 can each crm of chicken, crm of mush, and crm of celery.  To take a tip from another reviewer, added one packet of Italian flavored dry soup mix (Lipton brand).  Dropped 4 frozen boneless chicken breasts in and let slow cook on low for about 8 hrs.  Served over rice one night, and had with wide egg noodles for leftovers for lunch the next day.

My family rates this 5 stars based on these modifications: Added 1/2 packet Good Seasonings dry salad dressing mix and eliminated mushroom soup. I added a little Velveeta w/the soups, and in the last 30 minutes added frozen cut up broccoli. Served over rice. Super easy and very yummy!

This was good.  My kids ate it up and loved it.  I've always cooked this in the oven but I like it better in the slow cooker.  The last 15 minutes I added minute rice and let that cook with everything - turned out wonderful. Only complaint is the sour cream was a bit over powering, so next time I will use 1/2 the sour cream or not use it at all (I dont think this dish NEEDS it). The chicken was so tender it fell apart in the rice and soup mixture, wonderful.  I also added a chicken spice to the chicken before adding it to the slow cooker.  I also added some celery salt.  **To those who think it's too runny - add minute rice to the slow cooker the last 15 minutes.  I just pour until I think it looks good and give it a good stir, replace the lid and let it cook, then add sour cream (if you want it) and it's done.

I made this "as is" and thought it was great.  A lot of sauce, but I took the leftover chicken, chopped it up, added frozed veggies to the sauce and chicken and made a 9" pot pie with it.  FABULOUS!!

I used this as a base for enchilaldas as someone suggested. After the chicken, cream of mushroom soup, cream of chicken soup and chedder cheese soup cooked for about 4 hours in the crock pot, I shreaded the chicken and put it back in the crock pot with some green chilis, garlic powder and onion powder for another couple hours. Then rolled them up in flour tortillas and topped them with some mexican cheese. For the sauce, I combined chedder cheese soup, cream of chicken soup and sour cream. It turned out pretty good. Next time I will thin out the enchilada sauce with a little milk, it was a little too thick.

This was a quick, easy, delicious recipe. I used Chedder Cheese Soup as I could not find the Cream of Chedder Cheese Soup. It turned out delicious. I also, used chicken tenderloins. I placed them in the crock-pot frozen and cooked on high for about 4 hours. Turned out tender, NOT over cooked like some other reviewers had mentioned. Overall, a great recipe that I will use again and again.

Great recipe!  I used the low-sodium soups and the sauce still came out really nice. I served it with mashed potatoes and garlic roasted asparagus and my hubby gave the meal a 9.75 out of 10!!

I tried this and it wasn't great-very bland. It's a good starting point for dinner, but if you don't "dress it up" (as we say in the south), you will be disappointed.

I made this recipe for a Girl Guide pot luck yesterday.  A huge hit!  Being in Canada, the only soup I could find was in 10oz cans, so I used four cans, two cheddar, two chicken (I hate mushrooms).  The same as many other reviewers I found it very salty and so placed pieces of peeled sliced potatoe on top for an hour to draw out the saltiness.  Next time I'll use reduced sodium soups.  I also cooked penne pasta until it was al dente and mixed it into the slow cooker 30 minutes before serving. I cut the chicken up into pieces and froze it. With the frozen chicken I cooked it for 11 hrs in the slow cooker. Being at work for 8hrs it was difficult to work out having the slow cooker on for 6-8hrs.

This is the best chicken I have had in a long time!  I thought the cream of mushroom soup would taste kinda weird with the other ingredients but it didn't.  I forgot to add the sour cream but it was excellent anyways!!

This was easy to make and would be okay when you know you dont have alot of time (for cooking or dinner) but I really wasnt that impressed with the flavor and probably will not waiste good chicken breasts on it again. The flavor was not awful...just nothing special

I USED TWO CANS OF THE CHEESE SOUP AND ONE CAN OF CHICKEN. I DON'T LIKE MUSHROOMS.  BUT, THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT AND MY KIDS AND HUSBAND LOVED IT.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SALTY AT ALL.  WILL MAKE AGAIN.
THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE

Very yummy and easy!  The house smelled great and supper was ready when I got home from work.  I was late starting this, so I used chicken tenders (pre packaged chicken breast strips) instead of breasts and cooked them on medium for 5 hours.  I also threw in one potato, cubed.  It was probably done in 4 hours, but still very tender as i let it cook longer.  Did not have cheddar soup on hand, but substituted a can of broc-cheese soup in its place.  To add to the cheesiness, I added 4-5 slices of lite velveeta at the end.  Did not use the sour cream as the recipe suggested, but it was GREAT without it.  Husband asked for leftovers the next two nights!!  Served with stuffing and carrots.

My wife is the world's pickiest eater and she loved this recipe.  We used cream of onion instead of cream of mushroom; it gave it a nice onion flavor.  Adding a little milk to the condensed soups makes them easier to mix and pour over the chicken.

I tried this with 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 1 can celery, 1/2 can cheddar cheese, and 1 can cream of mushroom. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, oregano, and cajun seasoning, and added fresh onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Then seasoned the whole thing with garlic powder and red pepper flakes. Put it on low at 8:30 am and came back in the afternoon to a soupy mess, so I added another cream of chicken. Toward the last hour I added some more onion and put ziti noodles in to thicken the mixture. Added a couple dollops of sour cream right before dinner. Tasted pretty darn good at the end, but I think without adding your own stuff the taste would be a little bland. I might make this again.

After reading quite a few reviews,I did make a couple of changes to fit my tastes. I only used 2 chicken breasts since it's just me and my husband. I did 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of cheddar and skipped the mushroom. I added 1 packet of Italian Dressing seasoning, garlic powder, and a few other herbs. I didn't add additional salt and I think that was the right decision for me. I put it on low for 9 hours while I went to work. My chicken wasn't all the way thawed when I put it in but it turned out so tender, not over cooked at all. Once I got home, I boiled some brown rice, cooked some frozen broccoli, and then threw it all together. The tender chicken just shredded while stirring it all together. A couple bites in, my husband said it was salty, which I agreed. Lightbulb went off, oh yeah, sour cream! I do think that helped cut the salt taste. Overall, I think this recipe is fine. Nothing that wowed me, nothing that was gross, just fine.

This recipe has potential, and I might try it again with some variations. I cooked it for 8 hours on low while I was at work and the chicken is DRY : (  I used the 3 soups suggested in the recipe, next time I will add i more can of cream of cheddar and will add more spices.

It's ridiculous that my family should rave about a bunch of canned soup.. but whatever works right? I did up the Cream of Chicken to 2 cans to make it saucier. Served over PA dutch noodles. Yummo!

All but the non-pasta eater in my family loved this one.  I used chicken breasts straight from the freezer,  threw salt and pepper on top, and then dumped the soup on that.  Left it all day and never stirred it until I added the sour cream at the end.  It was soooo easy and delicious.  Might try adding broccoli next time for added color.

This is a great, simple recipe for days when you are too busy for a complicated meal! I use 2 cans of Cheddar Cheese Soup and 1 of Cream of Chicken and serve over brown rice. I keep experimenting to find a way to add just a touch more flavor, but it's good just the way it is.

This was so good! I added broccoli and a can of mushrooms the last hour and it was a full meal in itself. Very tasty and super easy!

Any recipe that has all 4 kids wanting seconds definitely gets 5 stars! I added 1 pkg. Italian dressing mix and put all over bow tie pasta (cooked seperately). The pasta was ok, but I think egg noodles will be a bit better next time I make it.

I don't normally write reviews, but this was so delicious I had to share how much I loved it.  Absolutely easy to make and delicious!  Like others I added frozen broccoli near the end.  I served it over wild rice and that definitely enhanced the flavor.

Thanks for posting this recipe!  I made it as is and ate it with roasted potatoes.  I plan to take the suggestion of enchilada's with the leftover meat.

This was a nice warm and comforting dinner to come home to after a hard day of work.  I added a packet of dry Italian salad dressing mix and sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also cut the chicken into cubes and served over egg noodles with a side salad.  I would have to say that even with the addition of the dressing mix, it was still lacking that "wow" factor.  I also think it had one too many cans of soup in it.  I don't think I will make this again, but it was nice to try.

Super easy to make and the chicken was very fall apart tender but it was just lacking something for us. The kids weren't crazy about it and my husband I just found it lacking. May try repeating with different variations.

If you want to add additional flavor try fiesta cheese or other "spicy" cheese soup.  This works well without too much "kick".

I added a second can of chedder soup and a package of dried onion soup. Really gave it the flavor I was looking for. If not for that, it probably would be a bit bland for my liking. Overall, great recipe once tweaked. Will make again.

WOW!!  I really don't understand the negative reviews.  I followed pretty much to the "T" BUT instead of the salt, pepper and garlic, I added a packet of onion soup mix.  I also doubled the recipe so I can freeze half for a quick dinner in the next week or two.  It came out WONDERFUL!!! The family loved it and will definitely be a repeat dinner at this house hold.  Wasn't bland or boring in the least.  Served it over rice.....YUMMY!!!!  Chicken was fall apart tender and juicy.

Not recommended. this recipe reminds me of something that was plopped in a casserole dish in 1950. Bland and boring and visually unappealing.

What comfort food--the chicken was so tender! I followed this recipe as directed. While I did enjoy the results, I agree that the recipe was a bit bland. Next time, I will add more garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper. To call this recipe "cheesy chicken" is a bit of a misnomer. Creamy chicken would be a better descriptor, as the cheese flavor of the soup was lost among the cream of mushroom, cream of chicken and sour cream.

Yum! I don't have a very big crockpot so I baked it in the oven. It was very good. For those who say it's bland, perhaps those people didn't add enough seasoning. We like a lot of flavor and this was cheesy and flavorful. I did add some chopped green onions. I also sprinkled about a cup of shredded cheese on top of it toward the end of baking, just long enough for it to melt. I am going to have to invest in a large crockpot. The men in the family loved this! Thank you!

This dish is very easy. The first time I made it I forgot the sour cream so it was too salty. The next time is was perfect. For those who said it was bland I added a half a can of fiesta nacho cheese soup in place of the cream of mushroom and spike seasoning on the dry rub for the chicken. I served over rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is so simple but so good.  My family ate it up!  I didn't use the sour cream and still ended up with lots of extra gravy which I saved in the refrigerator and served over mashed potatoes a few nights later.  The chicken does need to be seasoned really well, but it comes out very, very tender.  Maybe the reviewer  whose chicken wasn't done put the chicken on top.  (I poured the soup over it.)    I didn't add vegetables, but served this over rice with a green salad and corn on the cob.  A perfect meal!

I subbed an extra can of cheese for the mushroom soup, and used only three large frozen breasts.  My boyfriend and I loved it for dinner that night (though it was hard to resist eating it early, it smelled SO amazing), and I nuked the last breast for my lunch the next day.  It was still good, but best fresh, I think.

In my rub, I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  I think the addition of paprika helped to offset the cheese flavor, without adding a big bite to the chicken.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I think next time I may leave the sour cream out and may add a little more spices for some zip. But all in all it was pretty good. I served it over rice and put broccoli in with the soup mixture for some veggies.
Thanks for the recipe.

It was good, the chicken was very juicy and tender. My family liked it as well. I served it on a bed of rice which turned out well cause the cans of soup made a yummy creamy sauce that I used to drizzle on to the chicken and rice. Will make it again!

This was super easy to make, but I did not like it.  Flavor was blah - I would not make this again.  My adult guests didn't comment (which means they didn't like it) but the kids ate it all up without any complaints.

Amazingly good. Served it with rice.My wife does not like boneless skinless chicken at all because no matter how it's cooked it dries out. So moist and tender she loved it. I used frozen bonelss skinless breast and they came out perfect.

This was delicious and so easy! I used only 4 chicken breasts but all of the soup. We had the sauce on egg noodles. Yum! Next time I will add extra mushrooms and serve with grated cheese on top. I had too much sauce with 4 chicken breasts.  Maybe leave out the cream of chicken soup.

Very tasty but there was a huge amount of sauce compared to the amount of chicken in the recipe.  Next time, I'll add more chicken breasts.

This was a GREAT recipe find!!  It was nice having baked chicken without having to turn the oven on.  The chicken was very juicy & tender.  I added a package of frozen broccoli the last hour of cooking and served the chicken over brown rice.  It was yummy, fast to put together, and easy cleanup...a must for any busy mom (or dad)!!

Served over pasta,it's fabulous!  We tried it over rice first and thought it was OK, but I was thrilled when I used left-over pasta in a fit of laziness!

Delicious, even though I forgot the sour cream.  Used frozen chicken breasts & cooked 6 hours, but it was done in about 4 so I turned the crock pot to warm.  Served with mashed potatoes & peas.

This was a good recipe, but not great.  Easy and cheesy, as advertised.  But, it was fairly plain.  I made it exactly according to the directions and I think I'll need to jazz it up a bit if I make it again.

I didn't have any chicken breasts so I decided to use chicken thighs. I put it on in the morning before I went to work and it was delicious for supper. Thanks fro this easy..easy  recipe.I also forgot to add the sour cream and it tasted excellent without. Next time I will remember to add the sour cream though.

This is a great recipe : ) The cook time for me was only 3 1/2 hours (on low). The chicken was thoroughly done, and really tender.  I added Paprika and Poultry Seasoning in addition to the salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  It had a great flavor that went well with Spanish rice!!  Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband is not one to praise food, so when he says to my 4 year old son, "Try the chicken, it's really good!" - I have to give the recipe 5 stars.  I don't usually like chicken breasts because they tend to be dry and even tough sometimes, depending on the chicken.  But these turned out very tender.  And the combination of soups and sour cream made a really nice gravy for mashed potatoes.

My son and boyfriend LOVED this dish. I served it over rice and put lots of garlic on the chicken (I love garlic).  My son tends to be kind of picky, so if he was going back for seconds then I know it was good!  :)

This was EXTREMELY tender chicken! For the small amount of effort, this was definitely a 5 star recipe!  The only things I did differently was to add extra cheese after cooking.  Also, rather than stirring the sour cream in, I added it on top of each helping.  Great recipe!:-)

Campbells makes a new Southwest Style Pepper Jack Soup.  I used this in place of the Cheddar Cheese soup - it gave it just the right amount of zing and still remained kid-friendly.  VERY EASY!

Very good recipe. I am on Weight Watchers so I did change the recipe a little. I used 2 cans of 98% fat free broccoli cheese soup instead of the mushroom soup and cheese soup.  I also used fat free cream of chicken soup and lite sour cream. I also added frozen broccoli in the last thirty minutes of cooking.

I wish there were a 6 star category because this one would definately fit!! I have never fixed anything before that my family has loved more. I followed the recipe exactly and it was sooooo yummy. My children actually wanted thirds of it. That has never happened in my house before. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I had to change this recipe just a bit!  I did 2 chicken breasts with one cream of chicken, one cheddar.  It was done in 2 1/2 hours, and then I added 1/2 cup salsa, 1/2 can black beans.  I served it over lime tostitos.  YUM!  Try this for a fun variation!

I wanted to add my praise along with everyone else.  As promised it was very tasty (my husband loved it), and very easy.  I also added an extra can of mushroom soup to get more gravy (and we got LOTS!!!).  I used low-fat soups and no-fat sour cream and it couldn't have been better!  I plan to use it for two nights -- one over egg noodles and leftovers over mashed potatoes.  Thanks!!

Blech.. This was not very good, The chicken came out really mushy and sticky, and it looked awful. I had to make my husband chili to go with the rice I made to eat with this. I always try to convince myself that I like chicken cooked in a crockpot. Well, I've learned my lesson.

It doesn't get much easier than this!
I added a can of sliced potatoes and a can of sliced carrots towards the end and served this over rice.  This is a keeper in my recipe box!  If you like a lot of flavor you might want to add some minced garlic.

Like a lot of people, I forgot to add the sour cream, but never missed it!  Didn't have time to use the slow cooker.  Seared the chicken breasts in a cast iron skillet, and then baked them in the oven.  Tasted wonderful!  Will make again.

YYYUUUUMMMMYYY!  I added a can of mushrooms.  Didn't have cheddar cheese soup, so I added 4 slices of american cheese torn into little pieces and it melted right in added with the sour cream.  I just love this over rice.  My hubby usually doesn't care for chicken, but he likes this one.

I liked the overall taste of this recipe but
I added a little parsley for color before
presenting it to the family.  It makes alot.
I made both rice and noodles and my family
thinks it is better over noodles!

Nothing could be easier or more delicious. Start it in the morning and it will be ready when you get home. Moist, creamy chicken. Great with egg noodles.

4 stars because this is an easy and tasty dinner, and for me a good base.  However, I changed just about everything. First no rinsing chicken as advised by food experts.   And only organic items.  I used a bit of olive oil and mixed in fresh ground pepper and dried garlic flakes and rubbed it into the chicken.   I used organic and reduced sodium Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup, and cut the chicken breasts into chunks. Used light sour cream and only 1/2 of suggested amount.  Instead of cheese soup, I shredded cheese using either Colby or cheddar or chipolte/cheddar when the chicken was almost done. It was then placed over garlic and herb Papperdelle noodles. Excellent!

Followed the recipe exactly but found the flavours to be a little bland. The chicken was moist and delicious but again didn't hold much flavour.

Im NOT a cook...I burn water. lol but this was super easy to make. I used chicken thighs and added garlic, bell pepper, and onion. I cooked it on high for about 6 hours. The chicken was super tender and all together nice and rich and cheesy. I also added some extra graded cheese (cheddar). The whole family loved it. It would be nice to have added potatoes. I served it over pasta and the kids ages 2 and 5 ate it all up!

This is the BEST chicken I have ever tasted!  I made some changes that I read in other recipes: Added Italian dressing mix to the soup mixture, and added frozen broccoli and cheddar cheese.  I made it with heart healthy soups (2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of cheddar because we don't like mushrooms) and it is probably the healthiest thing that the whole family - from grandma to my 15 month old - immensely enjoys!  Will DEFINITELY make this again in the future

This was so easy! I used dry onion dip mix with garlic salt and pepper to season the chicken. Then poured one can of cream or celery, chicken, and cheddar soup. Cooked for about 8 hours and served over whole wheat egg noodles. It was delicious!

It was ok..edible but very boring, bland. Changing the seasoning and soups would make this a 4-5 star dinner but that would make it a different recipe all together. so THIS one just gets two

Guess I'm in the minority because I didn't like this at all. I followed some suggestions and added a packet of dry italian dressing, a jar of mushrooms and a pack of frozen broccoli so it wouldn't be bland-tasting and guess what? My husband and I both thought it was still very bland. It would have tasted the same if I had just put chicken in the crock pot with a can of soup, and saved me paying for a couple cans of soup and sour cream. The chicken was moist and tender, and overall it was "fine", but to me that's not good enough and I won't be making it again.

Super easy, and tastes great. Did a side of cheesy noodles and brocolli with it, but think next time I'll do egg noodles with it, as it reminds me of Chicken Ala King. I am reserving the sauce/gravy to use for boiled red potatoes tomorrow.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  The chicken was very bland! I added mushrooms to the crockpot about an hour before it was done, which I recommend, but the dish wasn't really cheesy.  If I ever make this dish again I would take the advice of other reviewers and add Italian seasoning and some other vegetables like broccoli.  If you want it to have a cheesy taste I would probably add another can of cheddar cheese soup.  The chicken was very tender though.  Definitely did not need a knife, just needs a lot more seasoning/flavoring.

Made recipe as listed.  Served over whole wheat egg noodles (which we all typically like and use all the time in strognoff).  Huband complained it was bland. My daughter ate about 3 bites of chicken and went to eat plain noodles.  I thought it was ok. Nothing great... kinda salty and I used reduced sodium soup.  Will not make it again.

It was EASY & Delicious!  Like everyone else, I seem to have trouble sticking to a recipe as written, but all I changed w/ this one is I seasoned the meat with Dry Italian Dressing mix (as another member suggested) & it was great!  Everyone liked it - even my picky 6 yo daughter & my 3 yo son!  I served it over egg noodles & added broccoli as a side.  The sauce was plentiful & was great w/ the broccoli too!

I also added a little chicken broth to thin the sauce out, I added some mrs. dash seasoning and I added frozen peaches and cream corn an hour prior to serving. I served with brown rice and everyone loved it.

This is super easy and super delicious!! My whole family loved it! In place of the garlic I used a packet of dry Italian dressing mix. I also added a can of cream of celery to the soup mixture. I forgot the sour cream, but it doesn't need it. When I got home from work I made 2 cups of minute rice on the stove, and a bag of brocolli in the microwave. I added both of them to the crock pot and slightly shredded the chicken with 2 forks, which gave the chicken even more flavor. I will make this often!! Left overs for lunch the next day at work where fabulous!! Everyone was asking what smelled soooo good!!

The chicken gets so soft and tender that it fell apart on the fork. This recipe is terribly simple, I feel almost as if I'm cheating by making it.  I did make a few changes. I added cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom (picky eaters here!). I also added 2 cups of fresh broccoli half an hour before it was completed - any longer and I fear that the broccoli would have become so tenderized that it would be very much a part of the sauce.  I knew the sauce would probably require some sort of seasoning, so I used sage, oregano, basil and thyme, which gave the sauce a nice savory flavor. How much? To taste!  I served this over warm herb buttered egg noodles.  Lastly, like many other reviewers, I completely forgot to add the sour cream. Next time I'd really like to try it, so don't let me forget!

Very good, and very easy!  Lots of flavor, and very creamy.  Served over fetuccini.  Used left overs for enchiladas.  Excellent!  Thank you!

So versatile, so simple - comfort food the entire family can enjoy. I reduced servings to 4 to coincide with the 4 breast halves I had on hand, and omitted the mushroom soup because of DH's aversion to mushrooms. Used reduced-fat versions of chicken soup and sour cream. After adding the sour cream, I removed the chicken and cut it into bite-size pieces (with a fork), then stirred back into the sauce. Served over angel hair, really enjoyed it. Can't wait to try other suggestions, such as using broccoli cheese soup and stirring minute rice directly into the sauce to cook!

This was really good. I added quite a lot of seasoning though and a little bit (like a quarter cup) of  chicken broth because it was a little to thick for me. I also added broccoli the last hour of cooking and then ate the left overs as soup the next day. I will defiantly be making it again. Just don't be afraid to add spices because it is very bland on its own.

This is Amazing - easy throw the fozen breast in the cockpot sprinkly the pepper and garlic power add the soups when you get home put on a pot of rice - 30 minutes later - dinner is served (even if you forget the sour cream) Kids love it Grandkids love it and its easy - the cheddar cheese soup is a MUST but you can use cream of celery, chedder cheese and brocolli cream of chicken and or cream of mushroom - tweak it to your families taste - had been making a version of this for 27 years before they had cheddar cheese soup and just added handfuls of cheese in the middle of baking or microwavings - this is easier in the slow cooker

This was a huge hit with both me and my husband! I followed a few of the other recommendations and used dry Italian dressing mix instead of just plain garlic powder, and it was perfectly seasoned. I also used the 98% fat free cream of mushroom and cream of chicken as well as light sour cream, so the worst thing is probably the cheese soup. I served it with brown rice, and spooned some of the sauce on the rice and it was absolutely wonderful!   This will definitely be in my repertoire for a good hearty meal; I'm looking forward to trying some of the other suggestions including using the broccoli soup and fresh or frozen broccoli.

This was great and so quick and easy!  I accidentally added the sour cream in the beginning, but it didn't seem to do any harm (I'll try it the right way next time).  I also couldn't find cream of cheddar soup, so I added an extra cream of mushroom and we just added shredded cheese as we plated it up.  It was huge hit with both of my kids (even the one who normally won't eat chicken) and my husband loved it, and asked me to put it in my "permanent" recipe file!  We'll be eating this one alot this winter!

Big hit with the whole fam - and that is saying something!  I started with frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  6 hrs on low was perfect.  I also substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of celery and added a package of Dry Italian Salad Dressing.  Served on a bed of rice with a Caesar salad on the side.

This is our favorite family recipe!  It pleases everyone from my husband to my 10 month old daughter - the chicken is so tender it falls apart!  I add a bag of frozen mixed veggies about an hour before serving to sneak in some veggies.  So easy and so great!

My family didn't really like this one so much...  It was really salty, probably because of all the canned soup.  We try not to use very much salt when we cook at home but it was very, very easy, and since I've been going back to school I try to find easy recipes to save time.

Very simple ingredients that create a fantastic flavor...doesn't taste like the typical soup in a can type of meal. I added a variety of spices(garlic, cracked pepper and salt) to chicken and cooked for a about 4 1/2 hours in slow cooker- chicken was so flavorful and tender!

Overall, it was rather bland. We used half cream of chicken and half chedder cheese soup - I think next time I would use all cheese soup for more flavor. I added rice to the cooker for the last hour of cooking, and forgot to add the sour cream. The rice came out quite tasty, and the chicken was tender, but I can't put my finger on what it needs to make it something special . . .

This was a really good recipe.  I made it for my mom's bday with 3 chicken breasts.  It was one of the easiest dinners I've ever made and my mom can't stop saying how much she loved it.  I made this again and added velvetta at the end and served it over eggnoodles.  I also added in a little adobo and cumin.  It was really good.

My husband and 2 toddler boys enjoyed this meal.  I followed the recipe and after tasting wasn't wowed by it so I made a few adjustments.  I added the ingedients I would when making a cheese sauce - a few handfuls of extra sharp cheddar cheese, a few dashes of hot sauce, 1-2 tablespoons worcestershire, and a few dashes of paprika.  I didn't have the sour cream so I used 4 oz of cream cheese and it gave it a rich and creamy flavor.  The sauce was so think I added a few splashes of chicken stock. The chicken was so tender I couldn't cut it into bit sizes so shredded it and served all of it over rice and served it with fresh green beans.  All in all I think it turned out well for such an easy meal.

Delicious!!  I didn't have the Cheddar soup so I subbed with some Velveeta. Chicken was tasty and moist. I even started off with frozen breasts. Cooked perfectly in 8 hours. Served over egg noodles. I find it really unfair if you don't like creamed soups, then don't make it and give it a bad rating. This is a really easy, tasty, moist chicken dish.

I was pretty disappointed about this dish because it was really bland. There wasn't much flavor to it, it wasn't even very cheesy. I made a box of elbow macarroni and poured the chicken and sauce mixture on top. It was decent, but nothing great. If I make this again I will definitely use more spices and perhaps put chunks of cheese into the slow cooker to bake with it.

I was skeptical about this one, but it is actually very tasty.  I made it according to the recipe.  It has a "comfort food" appeal. I rated it five stars for being super easy to fix and for making the kids and hubby happy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed this recipes around a little. I used low fat brocolli and cheese soup instead of the other soups. I also steamed some brocolli and added it to the pot. Was great!

i wouldn't say this recipe was a HOME RUN, but it was at least a solid triple!! i doubled it for a set of 20-something brothers, and it turned out great. i only cooked it on low for about five hours (for the double batch), and the chicken was so moist and tender that it literally shredded off my fork. the chicken itself was DELICIOUS!!! the sauce... could use a little spicing up. i don't know for sure what it needs, but it needs something. we added some shredded cheese and hot sauce to ours and  served it over white rice and it was PERFECT. i will definitely make this recipe again- adding a thing or two next time to try to increase the flavor.

Pretty good!  I was afraid it was going to be bland so I drizzled olive oil on the chicken and seasoned with a mesquite poultry rub. I did use all three soups but I didn't have any sour cream. I seasoned the soup mixture with garlic pepper and threw in frozen brocolli in the last hour of cooking. Boyfriend gave it 5 1/2 stars.  I served it over white rice.  I thought it could have been cheesier but it wasn't bad at all.  I think as originally written though, it would have been on the bland side. Next time I might try that Velveeta idea instead of the cheese soup. I'll still leave the sour cream out.  I don't think it will really do anything special to the recipe.  Very easy very good. highly recommend.

This was really good. I sprinkled salt, pepper and Mrs. Dash original seasoning blend on the chicken breasts.  I used all the soups suggested but also added some velveeta and 1/2 C. of white cooking wine. Served over thin spaghetti. YUM!

This is a good recipe. I gave it to a coworker and she makes it all the time now. We like ours best served with egg noodles, we have tried it with yellow rice.

I couldn't handle this as a meal. I brought it to a potluck, and people thought it was a dip. They liked it as a dip..... As a meal though it was too much. To much condensed soup.

I adjusted this recipe a bit and my family loved it. I added frozen green beans and I only used 2 cans of soup - cream of chicken and Cheddar, and omitted the sour cream.  20 minutes before serving I added instant brown rice. Now it's a one dish meal. This is a keeper.

This was yummy!  We really liked it and plan to cook again!  I used Velveeta instead of cheese soup. I personally think the cheese soup is too bland.

This is a quick and easy recipe that I've made several times. I like to throw in fresh or frozen broccoli and usually serve it over rice.  I also usually add some salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.  Yum!

This review is for the recipe as written. it wasn't anything special, it wasn't very cheesy, and the leftovers went uneaten. I think next time I'll use the Velveeta, the packet of Italian Dressing mix, broccoli and mushrooms. I'll let y'all know how that goes.

What a great find just in time for comfort food season! I used Healthy Choice versions of the soups, and used 2 Cream of Chickens because I didn't have Cream of Mushroom. A must is to add a packet of Zesty Italian dressing....it was perfect to come home to after cooking all day while we were at work! Definitely one of my favorites!

very good.  I added a small can of diced green chilies and it tasted good!  made it more of a mexican dinner, i put salsa on the table to be served with it.  Great flavor....almost too salty! We served it over brown rice.

I love this recipe! Sometimes I use cream of potato instead of cream of mushroom. I always omit the sour cream. Possibly my favorite chicken dish.

This was soo good!!! I made it once and loved it, but thought it might make a really good soup.  I added some chopped celery, some frozen homestyle noodles, and diced up the cooked chicken.  After it simmered all day in the crock pot, it made a great meal for a cold March evening!

This was very easy and tasty.  A kid favorite!  I had rice in the rice cooker from the night before and I also made some egg noodles.  I tried both and they were equally as good.  Will make this again soon.

We loved this recipe.  The chicken is so tender, and sauce is so good.  Next time, I will just make up some noodles and serve the chicken and sauce on top.  Will definitely add this to my recipe collection!!!

This was a good chicken recipe...not great, but good.  I made it from frozen breasts this morning before church and cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours.  When we got home the house smelled great and dinner was ready.  I did not think there was enough flavor in the chicken, maybe b/c I used all of the "healthier" soups and sour cream.  Next time I will jazz it up with some wine and some more seasonings.  But I will do it again.  Served it over brown rice wich was perfect to soak up the yummy sauce.

This tasted like food you would find in a senior citizens home. The only reason I have a 2 is because the chicken was very tender. The taste was pretty bland and ick. My husband likes just about anything but had a hard time eating this. I followed the recipe. Maybe if I had made adjustments as others...it would have been better....but when you make all those changes..isn't it a whole new recipe? I think yes..and you should rate a recipe on the actual recipe because this one's high-star-count is very misleading.

I really liked this recipe and did not find the chicken to be dry at all, like some other reviewers.  I used chicken tenderloins rather than chicken breasts.  I didn't have a full 8 oz. container of sour cream, so I used what I had and decided to put a 1/4 cup of burgundy in it.  My family liked it, especially my kids who are quite picky!  Will make again.  So easy and good.

So easy and yummy!  We loved it.  Used cream of celery instead of mushroom soup because I don't care for the flavor of cream of mushroom.  Also used spicy nacho cheese soup and added a can of green chiles as some others suggested.  Served over rice.  Will defintely be adding this to our meal rotation.

Not sure how this recipe got placed into the Allrecipes cookbook.  The chicken was very dry.  Luckily, there was enough sauce to help it get down my throat.  My family was not impressed.  The sauce gets a 5 star rating but the results of the chicken (dry and very bland) gets a zero.  I'm being kind and giving this recipe 3 stars.  I will not be making this again.

i gave it a 4 because of 2 factors averaged together - this recipe gets a 5 for how easy and convenient it is to make, but a 3 for taste.  if you don't have a lot of time, throw in the ingredients and you are done (i also added frozen cut broccoli oen hour before it was ready).  however, if you are expecting to take that first bite and say, "mmmmmmmmm," then you have to dress this up quite a bit.  my family's reaction was... "it's not bad." i served it over egg noodles as many others suggested.  I think kids will like it (note the recipe does say "cheesy" however its just creamy - maybe add another can of cheese soup or throw in cubes of cheese) amd kids will probably love it. for us, we weren't a fan - and it was voted that i don't make it again.

This was a little too salty, probably from all the soups.  Other than that, we enjoyed it served over mashed potatoes.  I would make again but would use low sodium soup and maybe add broccoli like others suggested.

Unbelieveably simple.  I had boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I seasoned the chicken, put in crockpot and added the rest of the ingredients.  I added noodles instead of rice and chopped, frozen broccolli a few minutes before serving.  The chicken was very tender and fell apart. It turned into a Chicken stew or Chiken ala King.  I was concerned about the lack of taste but was surprised it was so tasty.  I will definately do again, but not too often.  Too many calories and sodium.

Super duper! I diced an onion and added that. I didn't have a can of cheese soup so I cut about 1/4 lb. of cheese into cubes and mixed it in with the soups. I also mistakenly added the sour cream with the soups (oops! but it turned out fine). Throw in about a 1/2 tsp. of paprika and a bit of cayenne pepper. Add some frozen peas in the last hour. DELICIOUS.

My kids liked the recipe, but my husband and I were not as impressed. It didn't taste chessy at all, just creamy.  I think I would have gotten the same results by adding sour cream to chicken helper.

I thought this was very tasty!  I forgot to add the sour cream, but didn't think that it needed it.  I added cooked broccoli right before serving.  Served it over white rice, and it was excellent.  Also, I used reduced fat cream of chicken, and red. fat cream of mushroom soup.  Will make again!

I had this for my first time the other night.  It was quick and easy with no hassles.  To me it seemed more like a base to add whatever else you may want.  I ended up putting Potatos, Peas, carrots and some other odds and ends.

This was pretty good.  The aroma is wonderful.  I added a bag of frozen broccoli an hour before serving like others did.  I recommend serving this over rice just because the sauce is great.

This was pretty good and very easy. I ended up throwing in a bag of frozen broccoli and turning the left over sauce into broccoli and cheese soup. It was a hit as well.

I was looking for something quick to throw together so I didn't have to stress about dinner. This was it! I made a few changes though. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of nacho cheese soup. After cooking these all day I decided to make it a soup meal. I shredded the chicken and then I added frozen corn and took a box of rice-a-roni spanish rice (seaasoning packet as well). I also added a bit of water after the rice started cooking up. Next time I will add the rice sooner. We ate this over biscuits. YUM!

I had great expectations for this one.  I typically like dishes with cream of mushroom or chicken but this one basically tasted like soup poured over chicken.  It wasn't horrible but I will probably not make again.

Not bad, but definitely not as cheesy as I was hoping for. I couldn't seem to find Cream of Cheddar Cheese soup, so I used the condensed Cheddar Cheese soup instead. I'll make this again because it was very easy!

5 stars no doubt! The only thing I did differently was added some green chile, potatoes and a little shredded cheddar to make the sauce thicker and cheesier. It was ohhh so delicious, tasted like green chile chicken enchiladas but without the trouble of making. Thanks Leslye, we enjoyed and will again!

Very good!  Like others, I omitted the mushroom soup (I don't like mushrooms) and added another can of cream of chicken.  I also added some chopped potatoes, and some rotini noodles.  I was cramped for time, so I boiled the chicken beforehand in a pot; cooked the potatoes mostly through; and the pasta I pre-cooked as well.  I added all of it into the crockpot and it went together very well!  Next time I make this, I will get it ready in the morning and throw it all in there, as opposed to cooking it all seperately and mixing it.  VERY Yummy!  Good Job!

Yummy chicken! I followed the recipe as directed and found the chicken was done after 4-5 hours, max. The sauce was good, I added a little more sour cream than called for. Those that found the sauce bland should take note of the "salt and pepper to taste" in the recipe. It was not a real cheesy sauce, however. If you are looking for something really cheesy, this isn't it.

This was excellent. I made a few changes though. I used cream of mushroom w/ garlic soup instead of regular cream of mushroom soup. Instead of sprinkling with salt, pepper and garlic powder, I put garlic powder and fresh ground pepper in a bowl and dredged the chix breasts w/ the mixture. Definately could taste the garlic w/ my alterations. This will be made again:)

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I served it over rice and the sauce was very good.  The chicken was a little "bland" as some others mentioned, so I will try some extra seasonings on the chicken before putting it in the crock next time.  Overall, it was good and very easy to make.

This was overall good... but I doctored it a lot. The main thing I *didn't* like about it was the chicken was fairly dry, even though it was cooked in a crockpot. The overall flavor is good, this is how I changed it: I added garlic powder, minced garlic, garlic salt, salt, pepper, minced onions, paprika, poultry seasoning and a tad seasoning salt. When I stirred in the sour cream at the end I also added 3 cups of stir fry vegetables, the large bag that you buy frozen with broccoli, snap peas, bell peppers (small pieces) and mushrooms. The vegetables definitely added some flavor. I like the combination of the three soups, but the chicken was definitely a little dry, maybe it should be cooked a bit less.

I threw this in the slow cooker this morning.  Smelled great all day.  I made the recipe exactly with the exception of some extra garlic.  I also coated the chicken in Italian Seasoning before throwing it in the pot.  Easy as pumpkin pie and delicious.  Good combo!

This was a great recipe. I used the nacho cheese soup. The chicken was very tender. It did make alot of sauce. Will use it over rice for another side dish. Thanks for this easy recipe. Will try other soup mixtures as well.

Very easy, very flavorful. Great for the working Mom! I cut the chicken up in smaller bite size pieces and added some frozen veggies to cook in the last hour to give it a little more "stew" like texture.

Although my husband and I loved this recipe I'm only rating it a 3 because I modified the recipe to suit our taste. I only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup with a can of milk since 3 cans of soup were too much for two people. I added 1 can of mushrooms, 1/2 envelope of onion soup mix, 1 cup mixed vegetables, and the sour cream. before i put the chicken in the crock pot, I sprinkled each piece with garlic powder. I served this over white rice. I'll definitley will be making this again, but next time to avoid  any uneccasary calories, I'll omit the sour cream alltogether.

We really liked this. I could only find Broccoli Cheese soup, and that was nice. I tasted the soups mixed together, and added garlic powder, I didn't put it on the chicken. Then I added a couple of sprinkles of cayenne pepper, a dash of cajun seasoning, and a small squirt of yellow mustard. The peppery seasonings help balance the saltiness of the soups. The chicken was fabulous, served it with broccoli & cauliflower combo, and steamed white rice. My whole family enjoyed it, and I will be making it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was just the jumping off point I needed for making dinner tonight. Following the advice of other reviewers, I added brown minute rice and half a bag of baby broccoli florets. I also added about 1.5 cups of milk and skipped the sour cream all together. No extra salt for me and I used the healthier choice soups. Oh and I left out the mushroom soup--sounded like there would be too much sauce with it & I was aiming for the Cheesy part of this recipe. Bought some low fat cheddar to sprinkle on top. Yum!

My family loves this recipe. I put the chicken breasts in frozen in the morning and it's very moist when it's done.  I use 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the cream of mushroom because my family does not like mushrooms.  I also add some dried onion for a little extra flavor. It's a hit everytime!

I've tried this recipe a few different ways so far. The Rice always turns out Excellent no matter what. The problem I have is the chicken always seems to be bland. Its still good, but not something to go "wow that was good" about. I would make again for those days when I dont feel like Cooking.

Very Good.  Used low sodium soup and served with egg noodles.  The next day served leftovers and put sauce on baked potatoes.  Added mushrooms and brocolli to recipe. The recipe makes A LOT of sauce.  Also, I forgot to add the sour cream and could not tell anything was missing.

Since my kids hate mushrooms, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also used some pre-packaged, pre-washed frozen chicken breasts that I didn't have to thaw first.  I was out of the cheddar cheese soup, so I used shredded cheese instead.  About 1/2 hour before it was ready, I put in the sour cream as well as some some cream cheese for a richer flavor.  My kids devoured it, and want me to make it again.  This recipe was so easy to throw together, but I think the next time I make it I'll use the cheese soup.  Thanks, Leslye!

This was pretty good...I have to agree with the other reviewers that it's pretty salty...but otherwise quite tasty...I also added frozen broccoli in the last 30 minutes.

Just as the name states, this is EASY. It turned out very good as well. I used one can Cream of Chicken, one can Broccoli Cheese Soup, one can Cheddar Cheese soup. It was very soupy, but I only used 3 chicken breasts. Overall it was excellent, and I will make again.

Chicken came out very tender, but there wasn't as much flavor as I expected. If I try it again, I'll add more seasonings to it.

This was pretty good. The 2nd time I made it, I added just a little bit of cajon season to each chicken breast and some tarragon leaves and it was really good with more flavor.

Good and easy to make.  My chicken turned out a little dry so we had to add more sauce, but that could just be the brand of chicken I used.  It was very tender.  I forgot to add garlic powder but it tasted fine without it.

This was so easy and tasty too!  I would give it 5 stars my husband thought 4 stars.  He didn't like the addition of the sour cream--I did.  I also substituted cream of onion soup instead of using cream of mushroom.  I happened to have that instead.  Came out great--will make this again.

Ok, I know that a lot of people said they forgot to add in the sour cream, so I thought about it most of the time, but in the end, guess what??? I bought extra sour cream this week, because I couldn't remember if I had it in the house and I did, so now I have a whole bunch!! *lol*
Wonderful recipe, very easy, very delicious my family loved it!! Will definetely do it again, and will try to remember to add the sour cream and will also try adding some brocoli to it, which I think will be very nice!! Thanks!

This recipe was ok.  My family enjoyed well enough, but I found it a tad bland.  I added sliced mushrooms and left out the sour cream. It was very easy, but I don't know that I'd make it again.

This was easy and delicious. I felt like I cheated because it litterally took 5 minutes to make. I just dropped in my frozen chicken breast, mixed up the soup and VOILA! Dinner was done when I came home! Thanks a bunch!

Pretty good stuff!  The only thing different that I did was to add a 4oz can of chopped green chilies.  Very yummy and very easy.  I even snacked on it with tortilla chips but served it on rice for the meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is just about as easy as it can get. This was my first use of a crock pot and the chicken was so moist and tender. Taste is wonderful. I served it over rice. It made enough for leftovers, but they were gone the next day! I would add some carrots and celery next time for a more complete meal. Excellent and so easy! Thank you!!

Although I forgot to put in the sour cream, this recipe was still killer.  My picky six year old just ate it up!!!  I made some broccoli and some rice to go with it, mixed them all together and it turned out great.  I didn't have to add to it at all!  Definitely a hit.

The chicken was tender and the recipe was very easy... but my husband and I found it a little bland.  I think next time I'll add onions, and maybe peas (as other reviewers have suggested) or even broccoli.  I'll keep this recipe and try it again!

This was very easy to prepare.  I would add mushrooms at the end next time.
It was very good served over rice.  Sour cream - I served it separately so that 
my kids and could put less on.  It wasn't as cheesy as I expected.  Good for 
picky eaters -though! Definite kid approval.

IT'S A HIT!!  It isn't very pretty looking but the taste is FABULOUS!! We had it over egg noodles with some fresh sliced mushrooms thrown in and it was great, although I did omit the sour cream, my husband doesn't like it in ANYTHING, and added two cubes of chicken bouillon. I think this would make a great potluck dish it makes A LOT and is REALLY cheap to make :)

Served it with cheese biscuits.  It was great.  The sauce it makes is great.  The only problem was that I had more sauce than chicken.  Next time I'll add more chicken.  Everyone loved it.

This was delicious.  I only had 4 breasts so I decided to cut them into small chunks so it would go farther.  Well, my husband thought it was soup and ate it in a bowl.  However you decide to eat it, it's yummy!

This turned out delicious! I made a few adjustments to suit my family size and taste. I used only 3 chicken breasts, only 2 cans of soup(cheddar and cream of chicken w/mushrooms). I also added some sliced onions. Next time, I think I'll try sliced mushrooms as well. I love the versatility and flavor of this meal!!

I just enjoyed the heck out of this recipe.  My husband liked alot it but the kids decided they wanted to something else to eat without even trying it first!  But not to worry, they will see this one on the dinner table again!

This is super easy, It's not really quick considering you cook it in the crockpot but putting it together is super fast. It is so yummy too! The kids loved it. We have it over rice with a little green salad on the side..YUM!!

My 4 year old who is afraid to try new things helped herself to seconds and then thirds of this recipe!
 I threw in some frozen mixed veggies about 30 mins before it was done, and she even ate those too!
I didn't add the sour cream and it tasted great. Definitely will be making this recipe again.

My husband and I both liked this. I couldn’t find cream of cheddar so I used 2 cans cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken, a little extra garlic powder and added 2 cans of sliced mushrooms-undrained. I also added probably a half cup of Parmesan cheese to substitute for the cream of cheddar.

used Cream of Onion instead of Cream of Chicken, and used 4 breasts instead of six (total was still over 3 pounds of meat, though). Kids didn't like it, hubby found it average, I wasn't in love.

This was so easy to make.  The chicken was fork tender.  The only thing I added was I increased the garlic powder a little, added an extra can of each soup to get more sauce, which gave us a lot, and sprinkled parsley in.  If I make it again, I will add vegetables.  We are going to  use the leftovers for a pot pie and add frozen veggies to it.

Used Healthy Choice Campbell soups and added a packet of Italian dressing to soup mixture. Sautéed chopped onion, celery, carrots and green pepper and added with the low fat sour cream and cooked wide egg noodles. Easy and delicious. A go to meal in the future.

Really shouldn't rate due to the numerous changes I made!  Used thin cut chicken breast marinated in a brine overnight.  Added salt, pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, lemon pepper, curry powder and a squirt of lemon juice into soups.  Added 2-3 cups frozen  chopped broccoli.  Added 1 cup cheddar cheese at the end.  yummy!

We made this as a easy weekend dinner. Followed the recipe pretty close. We shredded the chicken and I added a little water to the condensed soups. We realized that with the shredded chicken, this could make a great dip..just add some hot sauce or  cayenne pepper. Our girls loved it, so we will be making it again.

Couldn't get cheddar cheese soup in Thailand so used a vegetable soup and shredded cheese instead. Turned out ok.

Thank you Leslye for this recipe. It turned out very good. Made a few minor changes. I used two cans of Cream of Chicken soup. Did not use the Cream of Mushroom soup as my daughter and grandson do not like mushrooms. During the last hour of cooking I added a pound of Broccoli to the mixture. Served the cheesy chicken over cooked noodles. Will try it again with peas instead of broccoli.

My son has Celiac, and it is quite difficult to find GF cream of sauces except online. We keep a large stock of cream of chicken, which I figure I can also use where it says cream of mushroom. I can add fresh mushrooms. But could I use regular cheddar cheese in instead of cream of cheddar? My other 3 boys are NOT a fan of velveeta. Email me please! Rebekahe@cox.net . Thank you!!!

I ready that you can add "dumplings" to this dish and that you could use canned biscuits, cut up into pieces and dropped in the cooker about half an hour before dinner.  The biscuits puff up and are delicious with the gravy.  I use garlic powder but also add a generous sprinkle of sage and parsley and a bit of thyme.   Has a great flavor.

Due to a mushroom allergy, I made this with two cans of cream of chicken soup. On top of that, I replaced the garlic powder with 4 cloves of fresh garlic, and my family loved it. It has quickly become a staple in our home.

I absolutely love how easy it was!  The reason it didn't get 5 stars was that I thought it lacked a little something.  I will make it again but haven't decided how to amp it up a little, maybe more cheese, or something else.

An easy recipe to make, my son tasted it and his first words were "Oh this is so good Mom. You have to make it again." That's all I needed to hear. 

Additionally, the recipe says 6-8 hours on low setting.  I used thawed chicken breasts and cooked it for 6 hours and the chicken was tender and done, so 8 hours might only be necessary if cooking from hard frozen.

I wanted my chicken cut up, so after a few hours in the crockpot, I ended up shredding it. The dish lacked flavor, no matter how much cheese I put in it.  I added some spices and it ended up tasting just like chicken noodle soup, although far more unhealthy than what I usually make since there were so many canned soups in it.

Bland and honestly gross.  I couldn't even finish a few bites.  We ended up throwing a lot of this away (something I HATE).

My family doesn't like  mushrooms, so used cream of chicken , cheddar cheese  and fiesta cheese soups. Delicious!!! Served on Farealle pasta. Will definitely make again!! I also started with frozen chicken breasts, rinsed, set in bottom of sprayed crock. Cooked on high 2 hours, then turned down to 6 hours till time to eat. Very good with a little kick!!

It lives up to its name.  I will make it again.  In fact, I think you could easily add more chicken breasts as there is a LOT of sauce.  The chicken is very tender and though it is shown with noodles which would be tasty, I served it on mashed potatoes and that was good, also.

Cheese taste was barely there.Had I followed listed times it would have been soup.
I'd throw in some sharp cheddar to make title fit.

I've made this many times. The only thing I've done to alter the recipe is to add half a bag of frozen peas and carrots to the crockpot about 20 minutes before serving.  Adds a bit of color. Absolutely love this recipe!

This was a great easy recipe.  I did make some changes like other people did.  I added cauliflower and broccoli about 45 mins before the chicken was done.  I sprinkled cheese across the top at the end. Shredded the chicken them served over a bed of rice.  The family loved it! =)

I added 1 teaspoon of italiano seasoning and a teaspoon of rosemary to the chicken (sprinkled on top of the chicken with the salt and pepper). I also added 3 giant dollops of creme cheese to the sauce mixture. The sauce does thicken once you add the sour creme and let it stand for a few minutes.  Turned out amazing! This is a great base recipe to start out with and then adding your own spin to it!

I made the mistake of using chicken legs rather than chicken breasts. Too much blood mixes with the soupy mixture and changes the color. Next time I will decrease the mushroom soup a bit and substitute more cheddar cheese soup.  I did not add broccoli. It was very tasty and definitely will make again!

A little salty and directions are not clear if I should mix the cream soup with milk so I omitted the milk.  Added cream of potato  and broccoli instead of mushrooms.  Tastes good otherwise and would make again.

Honestly this is close to a similar recipe that is a staple crockpot dinner in our house. I've cooked with Cream of 'Whatevers' for years... but the Cheddar Cheese Soup is a nice touch. Will use double the cheese next time, as the 'cheese' taste was very subtle and hard to taste. I also agree that mixing ingredients in a mixing bowl and then putting it in the crockpot seems to work better, for anything I do in the crockpot. I did add some minced garlic in the soups, as well as putting some garlic powder on the chicken with seasoned salt & pepper, and it was not overpowering and blended very well with the soup mix. I also made a mistake and added the sour cream in the beginning (distracted by kids) but it worked out great as it had time to cook and marry with the soups. Turned out terrific, and will make this again, but with more cheese to see how much better this could be :)

I shredded chicken at the end of cooking and used to make enchiladas as another reviewer suggested and everyone enjoyed them.   Had so much left over so I made some rice, threw in the leftover chicken and some velveta chunks and baked and that was an even bigger hit!

It's simple enough but with all the soups in it it was just too salty for me. I even used all of the healty low sodium on the soups and still too salty. And I didn't put the seasoning in it. I'll remove this one from the box and look for another one to cook for the kiddo and me.

The recipe was fantastic, but I made a few small modifications based on some reviews and experience.  I followed the advice of 'wannabechef' and added a packet of dry italian dressing mix to the soup blend, and I also added a teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder directly to the chicken.  I also used a 2.5 lb bag of chicken tenderloins instead of breasts.  My kids loved it and went back for seconds!

Awesome! And easy quick recipe my entire family enjoyed including my picky 7yr old eater! I followed the recipe to a T and just and added some sprinkled McCormick dry Italian seasoning to the chicken to give it a bit more seasoning and served it over some fluffy egg noodles. YUM

While the chicken itself turned out to be cooked perfectly, we didn't care for the taste or the amount of sauce. We served it over rice. It would have probably tasted better without the cheese soup.

This was a really warm and yummy cheap meal!!!!! My husband and i really enjoyed! The only thing I changed was I cooked two HUGE frozen chicken breasts under the soup mixture on High for 3 hours and then shredded the chicken. Then before serving dumped about a cup of the sour cream and some cooked egg noodles in the crockpot.

Super easy to make and very delicious! Nice serving size and the perfect leftovers. I would add another can of cheddar instead of chicken along with some shredded cheddar before serving if you want it cheesy!

This recipe was super easy, I would have rated five stars but I think the cooking time was way off. I cut the chicken breasts in half like the recipe stated and they were falling apart in lees than 5 hours on low. I didn't find it to salty at all, maybe in Canada the soups don't have such high levels of salt? I also added rice to the slow cooker for about 10 minutes at the end and it came out wonderful. I personally only ate the chicken and not the rice(yay for diets) but my room-mate, her son, and my husband all loved the cheesy chicken rice and went back for seconds. If there wasn't a small child eating I probably would have added some cayenne pepper but other than that it was still yummy and good on a cold winter night!

My family loves this recipe. I've made it so often, I don't even have to look at the recipe. I usually add an extra can of cream of chicken soup, so it's extra saucy and some frozen vegetables about an hour before serving. Sometimes I'll add some shredded cheese with the sour cream at the end.

I tried the few recommended changes such as the Italian flavor packet, used 1can cream if celery, 1 can cream of mushroom and the can of cheese soup. Sorry to say I'd never make it again. It was to salty for one, and I didn't even add salt.

This was my first slow cooker recipe, so I can attest to its easiness! Cooked for 6 hours, then added some frozen broccoli and cooked for another 30 minutes or so. Didn't add sour cream. Served on spiral pasta.

I love this recipe. I made stove top stuffing and poured the sauce over that and the chicken and my kids loved it. This recipe is easy to fix and good for potluck dinners. I will be improving on it as my family's taste changes.

This recipe was great. My husband isn't a big fan of sour cream, but he didn't even seem to notice it was blended in. He really liked it and so did I. I bought some perogies and poured the soups and chicken over them for a nice filling meal.

My whole family loves this recipe, and it is super versatile and forgiving.  We tend to use whatever we have around and have really loved all the variations.  Our favorite so far is using the above recipe and adding snow peas, mushrooms and grilled loose corn (frozen from Trader Joes).  Tonight I am trying it with the progresso 3 cheese soup starter and a can of cream of mushroom.  We have put it over noodles, rice and even roasted potatoes.  All awesome.

I followed some of the other people's reviews and added the cream of chicken and extra cheddar base, and it was great! My brother's have already asked me when I can make it again. I think I'll add some fresh bell pepper in next time! We will definitely make it again!

Wow!  My 3 year olds went nuts for this.   I had to substitute since I didn't have cheese soup or cream of chicken.  Instead, I used cottage cheese, a chicken bouillion cube and a little french onion dip.  My kids are eating the chicken (shredded) by the bowlful!

I made this for the first time and it turned out great. Super easy and the 3 picky boys ate it even though they claim not to like chicken.  The husband who rarely likes what I make said it was very tasty! Only change I made was to use frozen unbreaded chicken strips and added the dry italian dressing packet like another reviewer suggested. Added lots of flavor and made it easier to serve.  I too forgot the sour cream but will add it next time to make it creamier. Very good over rice with corn on the side.

Yummy!  I didn't have time to use the slow cooker so I used italian seasoning for the chicken and browned it, then added all the soups with some milk and let it cook for an hour on low in a pan.  In the end I topped with fresh cheddar cheese and chives.  So easy and our picky eaters loved it.

This is a great recipe.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms at the very end, and replaced the cream of mushroom with cream of celery.  I also cooked rotini pasta and added at the end, mixing all together.  My family was very pleased.

i think it would be better if it had meatballs instead of chicken. the chicken was a little dry, but the noodles and sauce were really great.

Good enough to eat, but not to repeat.  Followed the recipe to a tee.  It was definitely easy, but it had a bit of a sour and/or chemically taste.  We suspect the cheddar cheese soup.  I am not "anti-canned soup" and have used the other two soups many times, nor did I put in too much sour cream, so I think that must be it.  Might try to tinker with it, but I already have a good Chicken a la King recipe and it's basically the same.

My boyfriend and I really loved this recipe!! I only used 2 cans of cheese soup and sour cream. It was sooo good over white rice! Slow cooker chicken tastes the best to me.

This was really tasty and I couldn't believe how tender the chicken was.  I only gave it three stars because it was way too salty.  Next time I would season up the chicken really well and use low sodium soup.

This was okay. We added some mixed veggies and served over rice for a complete meal. I found it to taste very processed.  I'm thinking of reworking it with fresh ingredients as to remove that processed taste. I doubt I will make it again as it is written.  The chicken did turn out very tender, though.

Wonderful!  My family said it was as good as a meal at Olive Garden.  I served it with "mouth watering stuffed mushrooms" from this site, pasta, and a salad.

this recipe was ok. the first few bites i liked but after i got half way through i started to not like the tenderness of the chicken. it was a little too tender for my liking. i added a half packet of italian seasonings and i am glad i did because i think it would have been too bland without it. i am not sure i would make this again following the recipe. next time i will shred all the chicken up before eating. great as leftovers though.

This was just ok. It wasn't overly cheesy....actually I could barely taste the cheese flavor. I used about 6 thinner chicken breasts and it cooked for about 4 hours...and they turned out very dry. There was a ton of sauce....I am glad that my family loves pasta with any kind of sauce over it. ((Otherwise it would have been a huge waste!!)) I had enough sauce to make angel hair with dinner and then I boiled another 16 oz bag of rotini, mixed it in the sauce and will use it for lunches tomorrow. All in all is was ok but nothing spectactular. Thanks anyway....

This was excellent! My husband and teen ager loved it.

I used about 8 ind. frozen chicken breasts and seasoned them pretty heavily with the salt, pepper and garlic. I added some seasoned salt too. For the soups I used; cream of celery, cream of chicken and cheddar. I also tossed in a handful of shredded sharp cheddar. Served over egg noodles tossed with butter, salt and pepper.
This is definitely going to be a standard in our house from now on. Thanks for such an affordable, easy and delicious recipe!

Okay, I made some changes... but it is now a family favorite! I left out the garlic and the sour cream. And, I used Fiesta Nacho Soup instead of the mushroom. It gave it a wonderful cheesy flavor. My kids loved it!!

My very fussy children loved this!  My daughter who doesn't even like chicken ate 2 helpings of this.  The only change I made was to do this in a 9x13 pan in the oven at 350 for an hour. There was a lot of sauce with this so next time I will make rice or noodles to go with.  I did make biscuits that went nicely with it. I will for sure make this again.   Very simple.

Eh... good enough to eat but what else is to be expected. I did not like the chicken so tender that it feel apart. The sauce was just ok and the family put this over noodles and thought that was the best part of dinner. Not interested in making this again but appreciate the recipe post.

Easy, throw it in the crock pot in the morning and come home to dinner ready. I used Turkey breasts since DH won't eat chicken. Turned out well. If I make again I will try adding pasta at the end. Thats would use more of the cheese sauce that I had left over.

Very quick and easy recipe.  We enjoyed it, but it wasn't cheesy by any stretch of the imagination.  This is definitely a do-again recipe, but next time I will make variations to it such as replacing one can of soup with mixed vegetables and shredded cheese.

I knew better...I did.  I tried it anyway out of sheer laziness.  My family was slightly horrified and grumbled all through dinner.  I don't know if it was the "fake cheese" taste of the cheddar soup, or what.  This is bland beyond description.  It was barely salvageable.  There were so many things that I added to the finished dish that I can't even begin to list them all.  I knew better...cream of mushroom---ok, plus cream of chicken---pushing it, add in fake cheese in a can---disaster.

This was certainly easy to make, but cheesy? Our household loves cheese, so we expect something to truly be cheesy if it says it in the title. I was sick the night this was made, so I had my husband make it.  He would have made it exactly as written. Had I seen the ingredients, I would have known it wouldn't be cheesy, but oh well.  :)  It was good, but a little bland. Thanks, anyhow!

This is okay, not something I would likely make again. I didn't care for the way the chicken breasts tasted after cooking the crock pot, although it was very tender. Also I found the sauce the be pretty bland. I tried adding the italian dressing mix as others recommended, but it still didn't improve the flavor much, just made it really salty. However my husband & kids enjoyed it. I think it's a good family pleaser, especially for picky eaters.

I used the nacho fiesta Cheddar soup by Campbells. It gave it a nice spice. Also due to time contstraints I only cooked in the crock pot for 4 hours. Then put mashed potatoes into a casserole dish and topped with the chicken and "soups". I put it in a 350 oven for about 40 minutes and it was absolutely delicious.

My 5 year old daughter is Miss Picky and she loved it!!! The only thing I did different is I decided at one point to not add the onion soup mix. You can also add veggies(ex. broccoli) and change the soup to add a little variation. Thank you!!!

I don't like it. The cream of mushroom soup is probably what really made me not like it, as I've never been a fan. However, my boyfriend likes it and that's why I gave it even two stars. If you plan to make this, I suggest you take the "easy" out of the title, and make your own base sauce with butter, flour, chicken broth, milk, cheese, spices, even veggies and then slow cook the chicken with it. Add the sour cream at the end and I'm sure it would taste much more "real" and home cooked. I already know it would be way better. Just understand that if you're accustomed to the flavor of home cooked, organic... "real" food, this is definately not the dish for you.

This was a hit with my family. I did make a few adjustments...I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup and I used more garlic than it called for...with only 3 chicken breasts. I will make this again!

Too much salt from all the creamed/cheese soups.  Plus, the chicken was extremely dry which I think happens because of the cheese soup.

I don't like this, just a personal preference i'm not a fan of canned cheese. However it gets a 5 because it's super easy and my family can't get enough. They love it!

This was alright. I think the cooking time is TOO long. Even tossing the chicken in flour/spices/etc. didn't help, it came out flavorless- but it has to do with being in the cooker too long. Maybe 4 hours MAX. I used 1/2C Velvetta instead of cream of mushroom soup. It was very cheesy and creamy. Might try this one again.

This is a very good recipe! The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly and my chicken overcooked in the crockpot and was very dry.  o, I do cut the time pretty much in half when I cook this recipe otherwise the chicken gets way to dry. But this recipe is very good. We serve it over egg noodles and I make some delicious bread to go with it.. very good dish!

My husband LOVED this.  I just thought it was OK.  I did like how easy it was to prepare.  I only used one cn of Cream of Chicken soup and one can of Cheddar Cheese soup, and I did add 8 oz of Velveeta to the mix to make it even cheesier, we're a bunch of cheese addicts.  Served over rice.

I found this recipe to be bland and a little bit boring. It definitely needs ore seasoning and less soup. The chicken was drowning in the sauce, and I couldn't taste the cheesse flavor at all. My husband thought it tasted like canned chicken noodle soup. My family ate this without complaint, but I suspect they won't eat the leftovers. If I make this again (not any time soon) I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion and use cubed Velveeta instead of the Cheddar soup, less liquid, and more spices.

i guess i'd give this a full 5 stars for ease of preparation.. but if you're looking for something with tons of flavor, this really isn't it. we really like it over rice when we know we'll be busy the rest of the day.. just stick it in the slow cooker and forget about it! i add a can of diced green chiles to the soup mixture.. gives it a little extra spice. i might play around with some herbs and stuff next time i make it.

I made this a few weeks ago for my family, and we thought it was just ok.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and also added some garlic salt, cajun spice and minced garlic, and it still just didn't do it for me.  The recipe title is a little deceiving, I wouldn't call this recipe "cheesy" at all.  I served it over brown rice, and my kids ate it, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

This was easy, yes.  As for flavor, it was lacking.  It definitely needs more to it.  Maybe some green ortega chilies.  I think it is a good base to start with.

I work overnights. So, I am always looking for new recipes to make in the slow cooker so that I can just throw it in crock pot when I get home in the morning, go to bed, and when I wake up, it's dinner. However, this recipe did not work for me. I set the slow cooker to low and went to bed, when I woke up 5 hours later, the chicken was not even cooked. The soup was simmering but it wasn't cooking the chicken. And I have a fairly new crock pot. But, I did try this recipe again, except I mixed the soups and the chicken and put them in the oven to cook. The chicken cooked and it was good served over brown rice.

This was awesome.  I changed only a couple things.  I added an extra can of Cheese soup because my family LOVES cheese.  And they also love mushrooms so i diced up a package of mushrooms to slow cook with the chicken.  
Served it with mixed vegetables and garlic red mashed potatos.

This is not cookbook-worthy to me.  It was edible and easy, but not flavorful to me.  Perhaps I eat too much cheese, but the taste didn't qualify as "cheesy".

This was delicious, amazingly fast and easy!  I read a lot of the reviews though and some thought it was bland, so I added a few more spices to the soup mixture (bon appetite, italian seasoning, seasoned salt, pepper and tabasco).  I, like many others also forgot the sour cream, but I did add the brocolli into it as well.  I served over fettucine noodles with garlic bread.  Delicious!!

This recipe was ok. Me and the kids ate it. My husband didn't care for it.  I think the chicken was too bland or something.  Maybe the chicken breasts needed seasoned better.  I probably won't make this again.

Because I'm only cooking for two, I used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6: there was lots of the soup mixture to go around and it tasted great. Like another response, I forgot to add the sour cream, but we didn't miss it. This recipe was extremely easy!

I think this recipe is okay.  I read the below reviews and changed the following - fresh garlic, added broccoli and added Italian seasoning to the chicken.  My hubby liked it - 2 of my 3 kids did not.  I thought it was okay.  It was nice that most of the dinner was ready when I got home.  I have leftovers - hopefully, they might improve. I would make this again if I was leaving for the day and needed something easy - I would probably reduce it from 4 servings to 2.

We loved this!  I didn't change a thing, except I accidentally added the sour cream at the beginning. It turned out perfect anyway.  It was very moist and so tastey.  I served it over rice.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  I served it over potato and cheddar pierogies and w/ a side salad.  The kids loved it.  It didn't look that great when I was mixing the soups together, but it came together nice.  I was pleased.  This one goes into my "make again" recipe collection.

One of my favorites because it is SO easy and has a nice flavor.  Great over rice or noodles - I usually do noodles since my two year old loves them.  Easy to complement with steamed vegetables.  Great meal you don't have to stress over.  Thanks!

I have made this a couple times now and it is pretty good.  The first time we just ate it as is and the second I served it over rice.  It definitely needs to be served over rice or pasta.  I will continue to make it as it is very easy to make and that is always a plus for a working mom.

Very good, creamy chicken recipe.  I used one can cream of chicken, one can cream of mushroom, and can one broccoli cheese, one container sour cream, one package frozen broccoli, 4 large chicken breasts, garlic powder, salt/pepper - cooked in less than 4 hours.  Served over egg noodles.  Chicken was VERY tender and juicy - YUM!

Very creamy and yummy dish! I used Paula Deen's house seasoning to flavor the chicken before putting it in the cooker. It turned out great and a wonderful kid pleaser. We served ours over white rice with yeast rolls and green beans...Thank you!

Although I jazzed up the recipe as per other reviews with seasonings, rotel tomatoes, garlic, etc; I still thought it tasted "canned".  My husband took one bite and got up and made a grilled cheese sandwich; my son took pity on me and ate it (small portion) and passed on leftovers the next day.

This was an awesome comfort food recipe.  I made it last night and had leftovers that my  1 year old and myself had today.  I even forgot the sour cream at the end and it was still great. Thanks for a very tasty recipe.

This was really good, but the title is misleading, it's really not "cheesy" at all.  Just very creamy......with all them soups! LOL  But the dish itself is very tasty.

The gravy was good, but it wasn't cheesy. The meat was really overcooked, almost to the point that it was separating from itself - and I only cooked it for 5hours on low. It was grainy or something...we didn't like it.

This was easy and very good.  I changed the recipe a bit as I was only cooking for 2 people.  I used 3 thin chicken breasts (cubed), 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can cream of mushroom AND chicken soup (didn't even know they made that).  I found I only had to cook it for about 4 1/2 hrs on low.  Served over rice it was excellent.

I loved this recipe even though I omitted the sour cream (an oversite really) and I used condensed cream of nacho cheese instead of cheddar cheese--the peppers in the nacho cheese gave it a nice flavor!  I will CERTAINLY make this again!

This was good, but not great.  I used 3 chicken breasts, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cheddar cheese soup.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I skipped it.  I didn't mix in sour cream because I thought it tased fine wihtout it.

My family and I love this recipe.  We use a slotted spoon to scoop out the chicken and then serve the "gravy" over mashed potatoes.  So good and so easy.  Definitely a keeper.

Followed this one to the letter. I thought that it was at least a four, my lovely wife did not agree and thought it was a two. She said she tasted a burnt taste. I did not but as agreed, I post what WE think. Seriously, I will try again.

This was pretty godo and easy to make. A little more flavor would have been nice. We had it with steamed white rice and salad. This dish reheats well and the sauce is great with rice. Will make again!

Good recipe.  I didn't use cream of mushroom and made it with nacho cheese soup.  I added some tomatoes and it had a nice flavor.  Nice and easy, will definitely will make again.

This was good and very, very easy.  I'd compare it to a one pot casserole type of dish that you bake in the over for an hour.  Not a five star but still good...and like I said, easy goes a long way.

Chicken was very moist but agree it is a little bland, could use a kick but not sure what. Also, next time I may substitute cream of celery for cream of mushroom.

Really yummy and easy.  I omit the sour cream, and use two cans of cream of chicken with herbs soup and 1 can of the cheddar.  I definitely add the garlic powder and pepper, and it always turns out perfect.  I got creative once after it was cooked, and mixed it with rice, sprinkled it with crushed potato chips and shredded cheddar, and broiled it to brown the chips.  Delicious!

I liked this, although it made a bit too much sauce in my opinion. It tasted great over rice. Next time I'll cut up the chicken beforehand and serve it á la king style. I also used the pepper jack soup instead of the plain cheese.

I actually didn't care for this recipe that much, but my husband LOVED it! He doesn't ever eat much and the first night he had two helpings, which is huge for him. He ate the rest as leftovers and almost right away wanted to make it again. The second time we added some mustard and since we had less chicken, there were only two cans of soup. It was pretty good the second time.

WOW!!! I halved the recipe and used 1 can of chick. soup and half a can of cheese (plain cheddar), no mushroom. This was SO GOOD! I didn't find it to be bland at all, but I can see where the peper/jack soup would give it a nice kick. As another review said, the "gravy" was incredible on mashed potatoes. I could make this every week and not get tired of it!

Overall a great recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe 'as is' is kinda bland. I will definitely make it again and will use the Pepperjack cheese soup as others have suggested. The chicken itself was very tender and fell apart. Great slow cooker recipe!

The taste was delicious, especially on a cold day it warms you up. I made the recipe almost exactly, I used broccoli cheese soup instead of cheese (couldn't find any!), and it came out great.  I do think that if I were making it for adults I would spice it up a bit but it was good "as is" also.

This is a good, easy recipe. I omitted the cream of mushroom soup because 3 cans of soup would just be way too much sauce. I also just used a few tablespoons of sour cream. It is good without it, too.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! It is fantastic, I would only change one thing...consider using lower sodium soups. I have never made it adding the sour cream and we still love it this way. I usually serve it over minute rice or mashed potatoes. It is fall apart incredible. The chicken always comes out so tender and juicy. This is a family favorite. I wish I could give it ten stars for easy and tasty! I have made it for many and no one has been disappointed yet!

Very easy to make.  The chicken was incredibly tender.  My family loved it.  I just think it could have used something more.  To me it was just a tad bland. I'd give it more like 4 1/2 stars.  I just wanted a little bit of kick or something.  But it was good and fast and everyone - including my 3 and 5 year olds - loved it.  We cooked it with rice and used the cheese to that, too.

Tasted good.  I used cream of cheese, cream of chicken, and broccoli cheese soups.  Chicken shredded and fell apart in the crock pot and got so tender.  Weird thing was, it tasted exactly like tuna casserole, though, which is much cheaper.

This was very good. I was afraid there wouldn't be that much flavor so I threw in a couple dashes of onion powder and a couple of mustard powder. It was very moist and very good. Thanks!

Good with egg noodles, made tons of sauce though and luckily I had put in about 8 or 9 breasts and then put what was left in the freezer for later.

yummy and easy!  I made a few changes, I added, minced garlic and red pepper flakes for flavor.  Instead of mushroom soup i used cream of broccoli.  In the last 30 min I added fresh broccoli and 1/2 brick of cream cheese. (the cream cheese never completely melted, which didn't look appetizing)  My husband didn't care for this but i loved it.

This dish was extremely easy to prepare.  We found that there is plenty of sauce, so we will probably make 2 more chicken breasts with this next time.  We also found that, when served over white rice, it was a bit bland.  We will be adjusting the recipe by adding more seasoning!

Very easy.  I used frozen chicken breasts, and didn't even bother to defrost them first.  Cooked on high for 6 hours; meat was very tender but a bit waterlogged - next time I will cook on high for 4 hours.  I added 1TBSP of thyme, some crushed red pepper, and no salt (was just right without).  In the last hour I added sliced mushrooms.  I might try adding a few slices of raw lemon next time.  This is a good base recipe, and I'll definitely use it again with further variations.

I used cream of broccoli in place of the mushroom soup.  My toddler LOVED this - he ate 2 bowlfuls.  We ate it over bowtie pasta.  It's a good recipe for a busy day.

Wonderful recipe!  Alittle on the soupy side which is good when served over rice or noodles!  I did make some modifications, I used cream of broccoli instead of mushroom and I added potatoes and onion in the beginning.  An hour before it was done I threw in a bag of frozen veggies and then the sour cream and it turned out scrumptious!!  Will definitely make this one again!

Good recipe made great by all the other reviewers comments.   I used the low sodium soups as previous reviewers had suggested and it turned out very well.  The chicken needed a little something though, maybe lemon pepper.  All in all a good meal that left me some extra for lunch today.

My family and I lovve this recipe! I have added and subtracted things here and there and made my own versions. I have used Nacho Cheese Soup instead of Cheddar to add some zip to it. I have also taken out the chicken, and instead put broccoli, potatoes, and other yummy veggies in. My 20 month old loves this recipe though!:)

I didn't like this as much as the group I cooked it for (a little too creamy for my taste) but they LOVED it and scarfed it down in under 20 minutes. I added mushrooms as others had, I also added potatoes. This is a really easy recipie that is great for groups and can work with most things you already have in your cabinets. Thanks for sharing such an easy crowd pleasing recipie!

This recipie was just okay.  I was expecting more of a cheese flavor, so I was disappointed.  It is very easy, but I probably won't make it again.

This was good!  I didn't really follow the directions though.  The recipe calls for 6 chicken breasts and I bought chicken tenders because they are cheaper.  When I came home for lunch I noticed that there was a lot of sauce so I just added 4 sliced potatoes.  When I got home it was ready.  About 30 minutes before serving I put about 1 1/2 cups chopped frozen brocolli in it.  It turned out really good.  It was actually more of a soup.  I reminded me of O'Charleys potato soup (but with chicken).  Next time I will try to leave it alone and serve it over rice like the recipe suggests.  I will definately make it again this way too.

This was good but probably will not make it again. Certainly very easy to make which is a major plus. Added broccoli during the last two hours which helped kick it up some.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Being in a house with two working parents, we need quick, delicious meals that arent' always frozen.  This recipe has it all, great taste and easy to make.  My youngest ate 3 bowls.

Wonderful!  Thank you for posting it, Leslye.  The only thing I did "wrong" was not having any cream of Cheddar soup, I subbed an envelope of cheese sauce mixed with some skim milk and my sauce was a tad thin.  Also, I omitted the sour cream just because it tasted so good already.  Next time I will try to remember to add some broccoli too.  All in all, really delicious and DH loved it over egg noodles (runny sauce and all LOL)!

My husband is getting tired of chicken, but he loved this! He said this one is a keeper! My daughter who is very picky ate it without complaining.  The chicken was so tender cooking it all day in the crockpot.

This was a very good recipe.  Made it for my boyfriend over the weekend and he loved it.  I didn't want to cook it for 8 hours so I browned the chicken a little bit (about 1/2 way done) before adding it to the crock pot.  I also added a can of mushrooms and some cubed red potatoes.  Next time I will do without the garlic I think.  I LOVE garlic, but it just didn't seem to mesh well with this recipe.  This is perfect comfort food though.  Yummy!

This was definitely quick (in the initial preperation) and easy. I like the idea of dumping everything into the slow cooker and then coming home to a cooked meal. But the flavor of this is only so-so. It tastes very much like "canned soup sauce." It's also very salty, so try to find the low-sodium soups if you can. My family ate it willingly, but didn't rave about it or even say that they liked it. I probably won't be making this again anytime soon.

I just throw the rice in the slow cooker with the chicken (and substitute another can of cheddar soup for the mushrooms due to an allergy), add a can of milk and a half can of water, and the entire thing is cooked and ready after a day in the slow cooker.

After spending time outside on a cold October day this was a real pleasure to have waiting for us.  Used one extra can of soup in order to have a lot of sauce and added a half bag of frozen green peas during the last hour.  Delicious!

Great Recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  It was too easy and wondered just how good it could really be and to my surprise, it was delicious and the chicken just melts in your mouth.  I used 6 boneless chicken breasts and only 1 can of each, not two like some have used.  There was PLENTY of sauce...Only difference I did was add 1/4 cup white wine and some parsley and thyme for a little extra flavor.  VERRY GOOD recipe, whole family enjoyed it (that includes 3 young picky children!)

Very tender chicken1  I used less chicken and then had more sauce to pour over egg noodles, very yummy.

This is the first recipe I have tried from this site that my husband LOVES!!  I doubled the soup like I had read and it turned out fabulous.  The chicken was a little dry, but then I did the full 8 hours.

We love this dish.  I added peas at the end and served over noodles.  Chicken is "fall apart" tender.

This was really good.  I doubled the soups and sour cream like others had suggested and it made just the right amount of sauce.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not much of a chicken guy.

I cooked the basic recipe for my wife and I and we both loved it.  I like the idea of using
low sodium soups and will try some of the suggested variations.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a quick and easy dinner.  I served it over rice and loved it!  Even my kids loved it! May consider adding another can of cream of chicken for more "sauce" on the rice.

This was extremely easy.  I was very surprised at how tender the chicken was and full of flavor.  My husband does not care for chicken much, but he liked this.

I changed the recipe to include low fat/low sodium soups and fat free sour cream.  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Next time I might add a small amount of onion to make up for the flavor lost using low fat ingredients.  I served it over noodles....absolutely delicious!

I gave this dish 5 stars even for quickness because it takes no time to combine the soups and throw in prepackaged (frozen individual)(bone and skinless) chicken breasts.  Pre-Made this for a party and everyone loved it including all the grandchildren.  (most likely tastes better after keeping in fridge for a day or so).  I sauted mushrooms till golden brown and placed them with some microwaved frozen peas on top for color.  For a large gathering I think you could add more chicken breasts and remove and chop the chicken into bite size peices for a bouffet style dinner so there is no cutting. I omitted the sour cream. Super..Thank you

I still can't believe how easy this was to make!  And DH licked the pot clean.  This was a huge hit at our house.  Thank you for sharing the recipe, Leslye.

All I can say is YUM!!!  My husband loved it and my brother can't quit talking about it.  Served over rice, it is a really hearty meal.  Also, you can make it healthier by using reduced fat sour cream and soups!

I used Cheddar cheese instead and I 
shouldn't of.  My sauce was real watered
down and not creamy, next time I would
add flour to the cream.  I wasn't to 
crazy about it, but my husband loved it.
