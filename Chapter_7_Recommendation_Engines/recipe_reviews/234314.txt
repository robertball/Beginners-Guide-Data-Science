what a fun way to use up leftover candy from Halloween. Easy instructions to follow. However, after I mixed every thing, poured onto a my waxed paper lined pans, you couldn't see the candy or nuts. I added an additional cup of candy corn and peanuts to help reflect I had added them to begin with. We will make again following the holidays. Thank you.

So delicious!  Really quick and easy to put together, too.  I used two bags of plain microwave popcorn and it worked perfectly.  Put in a little extra candy because the bags came to a cup or two more than the recipe called for.  Now I'm guarding it from the cat because he keeps trying to steal it as it dries.  I guess he likes it, too!

This was VERY delicious! I would definitely do this again. I used two bags of candy corn and more Reeseâ€™s pieces than it called for and I highly recommend doing that. ????
