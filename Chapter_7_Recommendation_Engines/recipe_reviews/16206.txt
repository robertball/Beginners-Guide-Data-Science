i modified this recipe after reading the reviews.  i used one box of matzo, crumbled.  i added one lb sliced and sauteed mushrooms and two diced onions, also sauteed in butter (can use margerine).  I added one "box" of chicken broth heated(since others said the taste was disappointing).  i let this cool and added 3 beaten eggs (to hold it together). i added about 1 teaspoon of thyme and salt and pepper (to taste) i baked this covered in a greased 9x13 inch pyrex casserole at 325 (COVERED) for one hour.  there was one very small square left after the seder!

I sauteed garlic with the onions and mushrooms and drained most of the liquid out before adding to the farfel. I also added 2 beaten eggs to the mixture before baking. The kugel was delicious!!!

Very simple to put together, but in the end it was a very simple taste.  Adding some more spices and seasonings will certainly liven this dish up.

This is very delicious.  It needs a lot of salt and pepper.  Taste it before you bake it.  I added two beaten eggs as someone had suggested.  I think it is needed to hold it together.  Made it in an 8 x 8 pan and baked it for 40 minutes.

This was was not only delicious for our seder but would make a great stuffing for turkey or chicken.

I prepared this dish for our community passover celebration for 116 people.  I added more pepper and garlic than called for.  It was served plain or with chicken gravy.   There were many good raves and requests for the recipe.  excellant recipe.

I was totally disappointed with this recipe.  Too much dilland it didn't stay together after baking...The gravy from the brisket made it tolerable however I wouldn't make this again.

I made this recipe into a pilaf instead of a kugel. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms and some garlic on the stove top, add the softened matzo farfel, added about 1/4 cup of water with chicken soup seasoning, salt and pepper, once the pilaf cooked a bit I added freshly chopped basil and parsley and one beaten egg to the mixture to make some pieces stick together but not to make the whole mixture too dense like a baked kugel. It was really good!

The recipe needs quite a few alterations. I added eggs and chicken broth as suggested , mine turned out very thin as it didnt state what size pan to put it in.

I was terribly disappointed with this recipe even though it sounded good.  It was very WET (it shouldnt have been-you didnt say to put it thru a colander and press out as much water as possible,which i did and still it was very WET and not very tasty!! These recipes should be tested- a big disappointment...

I honestly just used this recipe as a guide.. I took mushroom sage olive oil and two tablespoons butter substitute and sauteed mushrooms onions garlic and celery. I poured water mixed with chicken bouillon over the farfel and let it sit. I added three eggs and it's in the oven right now. Between the chicken flavoring in the farfel and what i tasted as I sauteed the onions I know this is going to be delicious and will be a perfect complement to the pineapple kugel and brisket that I made, both of which are already sweet.
