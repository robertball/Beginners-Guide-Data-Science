I was torn between a four or a five for this recipe. I opted to give it a four because I felt that several important factors were missing from the recipe as written. The taco seasoning should be held until the end to add the nice football color. If you look at the photo that I submitted, you will see the pasty color under the sprinkled taco areas on my "ball." I was afraid to sprinkle too much on top of it because of other reviewers who complained of the taco seasoning's over-powering taste. This would have been much more presentable had I used the taco seasoning to color the ball instead of mixing it in with the cheese. Also, the taste was SO much better the following day after spending some quality time in the fridge. I will make this again, but I will make it at least a day ahead of time and I will sprinkle the taco seasoning on at the end to give it a nice "football" color. The color of it as written is terrible, but my hopes are high for a better next time. Thanks.

This was delicious!! I ended up having to make 2 over the weekend. The only thing I did different was added more green onions since my friends and I are all lovers of them. I had to give this recipe out 3 different times. It was simple because I had all ingredients on hand. I will be making this cheese ball over and over again!

I followed the recipe exactly and agree that the taco seasoning was overpowering. The second time, I cut the seasoning from 6 tsp to 4 tsp and used a heaping cup of cheddar. I also added more Worcestershire sauce because my first football was albino! It was much better the second time, and I got compliments for presentation at a work potluck.

The football shape was ideal for super bowl.  I didn't use the taco seasning but maybe next time I will try it.  Instead of using nuts to cover the ball I crumbled bacon so it would be a "pigskin cheese ball."

Very simple to make and the shape of a football was a terrific idea. My husband and I both love spicey foods, so the amount of taco seasoning was fine for us.   I added my own touches, however.  I prefer Colby/Monterey Jack cheese to cheddar.  Then I rolled the ball in bacon bits for a bit more flavor.  Finally, I placed it on a bed of parsley to give it a football field look.  Turned out great!  I will definitely use this again.

Good taste and good idea.  I am not the best at making a ball of cheese look like a football I have found.  I attempte the crumbles bacon for the outer layer but that was going to take a TON of bacon and I didn't have much on hand.  I tried leaving the taco seasoning on the outside, but if you plan to wrap the ball up and tote it anywhere, the seasoning either sinks into the cheese or gets stuck on the plastic wrap and you have a really strange colored football.  My advice: bring the taco seasoning with you and sprinkle it on once you get to yur destination.  The cheese slices for laces turned out well.  Despite the appearance of MY football, half of it was gone by the end of the game so that earns it 4 stars.  Had all of it been eaten like most appetizers I bring, it would have recieved 5.

this was totally my error.  The taco spice is to color the football only.  Sorry for any lackluster cheese balls because of my flaky directions!

This was a fun addition to our tailgate the other day.  Next time, though, I will not use so much taco seasoning and will add more cheddar cheese.  It was very good, though, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

this tastes sooo good! i'm about to bring it to a superbowl party and i'm very excited. however, i wouldn't mix in too much taco seasoning, but save it for last: just shape your mix into the football, and then put taco seasoning all over it for color.

I love the idea, but it was a little too heavy on the taco seasoning for my tastes, and not enough shredded cheese. I think this would be good for a Mexican themed tailgate though!

I made this for the second time today and thought I should review it. I did not use the taco seasoning and added an extra tbsp of Worcestershire sauce. I had been looking for a recipe that was moldable and this was perfect! I would post the pic, but I made mine in a naughty shape for an adult party I had been attending... It was perfect and had rave reviews... we are on adult party #2 with this group of friends and it is back by popular demand! Thanks for the great recipe! Perfect to experiment with!

Great recipe! I made it for a Vikings football party and it was the first appetizer to go. I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight and it tasted great the next day. I covered my football in bacon bits to make it a more realistic "football" color and used white american cheese for the laces. This will be made again next year for our football party!

AMAZING!!! I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was perfect! I added a lot of extra cheddar cheese and only used 4tsp of taco seasoning. I also toasted and crushed some walnuts and added them to the top and sides of the football. Can't wait to make this again!

I made this cheeseball for our SuperBowl party because I too thought a football shaped cheeseball would add some fun.  I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the taco seasonings to 4 tsp and I rolled it in pecans.  I rolled it in pecans because it did not have the color I was looking for, but the pecans added some nice crunch to the cheese spread.  As far as taste, I thought it was good, but not exceptional.  I will probably take the shaping idea of the football and use a different cheeseball recipe next time.

I just made this for our superbowl party because I liked the idea of a football cheeseball.  I find that the taste of the worcestshire sauce overpowers it.  I like spicy food so the taco seasoning doesn't bother me.  Maybe after it sits in the fridge for a while the flavors will bind together more.  If there is any difference I will review again.

I loved this. It was fun to make and quick and easy.  Next time I’ll shape the football on my platter. Easier.  It looks nice with parsley to cover the bottom.  I used spinach.

This was good and fun to do.  I would probably do the same presentation next time, but think I can find a more flavorful cheeseball recipe.

This is yummy with the amazing change I made. Cook bacon, crumble up and put it on top and sides. No taco seasoning needed. Bacon makes everything better.

I added some taco seasoning to the mix and then pressed the rest onto the shaped football. For color. Think I wld add more sauce too.
