Great recipe to perk up regular 'ol tuna salad! If you like horseradish, then you'll like this recipe. I used Hellman's light mayo and regular horseradish vs. cream style - you can adjust the amount to your tastes. I  used pickle relish vs. chopping a dill pickle. I also added some finely chopped celery and a bit of salt and pepper. I put this on toasted whole grain bread along with the Swiss cheese, tomato slices, and some crisp lettuce leaves. Overall, very good with a nice "kick"!

I LOVED this! Only thing is, I can't stand Swiss cheese unless it's melted, so I made this into a tuna melt, and omitted the lettuce.  I just eyballed everything, so I'm pretty sure I probably used a tablespoon less mayo (just made it to our personal preferences) and probably more pickles.  I added chopped red onion to the tuna salad instead of slices - again, since this was in tuna-melt form!  Really delicious!  Best tuna melt I've ever had!

I love horseradish so I'd be happy to give this one a try. Sounds like a unique spin for an otherwise ordinary sandwich!

I used a lowfat mayonnaise, garlic dills and I added one large chopped celery rib. I did add at least double the amount of pickles. This is one of the best tuna sandwiches I've had in a long time. I don't know why I haven't thought of using horseradish in tuna salad before.

Wow can't believe I've never thought about adding horseradish to my tuna sandwich. I used regular horseradish and maybe a bit more than called for, just added in mayo until it reached the consistency we like. We wrapped ours in a tortilla with all the toppings. Thanks for the great idea funktional.

Great recipe. I ate on crackers so I can't review the sandwich. I added Cajun seasoning and lemon juice and garlic powder. I used lots of prepared horseradish and ate some bites with hot sauce! Yum!

Liked the taste of the horseradish mixed into the tuna. I was quite generous with the horseradish, pickle & onion. Added a little chopped celery for crunch. Loved the cheese - I don't usually add cheese to a tuna sandwich. We didn't think it was spicy, just tasty - don't let the name scare you off.

The horseradish gives it a nice kick. The mayo can be cut waaaay back. I doubled the pickle and next time will add more horseradish.

I made this recipe and served as an appetizer along with other higher calorie food. Use a large cracker, next a thin slice of cucumber, then the tuna salad and top with a couple of capers.  Tasty, low calorie and high protein.  Yum!!
