I have to admit that I was thinking this might not be such a hot recipe...Boy was I wrong!  The bread changes into a glazed donut and the filling becomes warm, sweet and so so good!  The only thing I changed was that I sprinkled the peaches with nutmeg and cinnamon.  I also increased the peach count to 6.  Great and a keeper for sure!

This was terrific!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I didnt' have enough peaches so topped it up with some strawberries. Oh My -So good!  The only thing is that we found that it didn't make 12 servings - more like 6 decent portions.

This dessert was amazing!  I used a large can of sliced Clingstone peaches (drained).  Because canned peaches are sweeter I reduced the sugar by approximately 1/4 cup.  Overall, this dessert was easy to make and tasted great!
