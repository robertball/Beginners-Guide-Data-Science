This is a very good, easy one-dish meal. To simplify the prep, I sauteed the shallots and the scallops together, and then I added the vinaigrette to the pan. I also added salt and pepper after everything was tossed together. I might add a bit more mustard to the vinaigrette. This is a definite keeper.

This recipe is quick and easy.  The watercress salad is amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was delicious.  The next time I make it, however, I will increase the amount of mustard to give the scallops more flavor.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  This is a keeper.

Corn would have been great but by the time I realized mine had gone bad it was too late. I used tomatoes instead. Watercress is also $4 a bunch here so I used half watercress and half spring mix to help even out the cost. This is a great recipe and the only thing I would change is to use more mustard as others have suggested. I used bay scallops because they are more affordable right now but sea scallops would be excellent too. Keeper!
