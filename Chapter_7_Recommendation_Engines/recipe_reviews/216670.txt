This recipe is so different - I just had to try it. The shrimp was a great addition to an old standby. I also added cumin and bacon, and cooked the potatoes in bacon grease - YUM!

Not as good as I expected it to be.  Was edible, and not bad, but for all the prep time and cook time involved I thought it would be better.  Won't make this again.  Also, recipe was bland, and that is coming from someone who does not eat much salt.

This recipe was okay. It was certainly hearty, but having seen the reviews, I followed the recipe to the letter, yet added cumin, basil, salt, pepper, and coriander powder as well, and I have to say it was still verging on bland. Don't think that for the work involved to deliciousness ratio, I would make it again.
