Quick tips - I omitted powdered milk, no biggie - Used all whole wheat flour (no all-purpose), still great - Blended quick oats to a flour-like texture and that worked perfectly - Rather than mashing banana, I just threw the egg, milk, banana and vanilla in the blender, mixed it all up and added it to the flour mixture, worked great.  I have never been a whole wheat fan, but as I'm getting older and realize how important nutrition really can be, expecially with diabetes in the family, I am trying to just make better choices  when possible and using less white flour and sugar is one of the big ones.  This was my first whole wheat baking experience and I have to say they were not only much better than I thought they would be, they were FANTASTIC!  I will be makng these often.   Next time I may add flax seeds and/or protein power to add a little extra umph...probably won't even be able to tell

I thought these were awesome! I made a half-recipe since I was just cooking for my boyfriend and myself and it yielded 8 pancakes, 1/4 cup of batter each. To make them more healthy I used (for 3 servings) one egg white instead of the egg, 1.5 Tbsp applesauce instead of the oil, and skim milk. As others mentioned I added cinnamon and used a very ripe banana for mashing. With my substitutions the caloric content is about 195 calories per pancake and only 1g of fat, not bad! Thanks for the great recipe! I will be making these again!

I made these according to recipe, only adding a little nutmeg and cinnamon and using lowfat buttermilk instead of plain milk. With most pancake recipes that use oatmeal, I let the batter sit on the counter for a bit before making the pancakes. My kids gobbled these up and asked for seconds! I didn't eat any myself, but they sure enjoyed them. I served them with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which is also from this site. There were a few leftover, so I froze them in freezer bags in two portions for my kids so all I have to do is heat them in the toaster the next morning. A+ recipe.

I was 1/2 asleep this am when I made these - and missed the whole grinding the oats step - yikes! Decided to forge ahead and make them anyhow - and WOW! They are so delicious! If you can mess up as much as I did and they still come out great - now that's a recipe!!! LOL! I didn't feel like dragging out the  milk powder so skipped that..

Great recipe! The only changes I made here was to use quick cooking oats (didn't place in the blender), I added 2 bananas instead of 1,  I also omitted the sugar and it was just perfect. I think that 1/4 cup of sugar would have been too sweet for our taste. Thanks for the recipe!

A very good pancake. I recommend using less sugar and more banana. I liked it best with an additional egg, some flax, and chopped strawberries in the mix. It has a subtle oatty flavor, which I really enjoyed.

YUM! These were delish and healthy! I added an extra banana and about a tsp of cinnamon, and am glad I did. I think they may have been a little bland without this.  I didn't have any of the dried milk powder on hand, so I didn't add that, and didn't miss it at all either. Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out really well. I used three ripe bananas, used less milk (less than a cup), and they were moist and yummy. I also added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 nutmeg.

These pancakes are FANTASTIC!  My almost-one-year-old and I just gobbled them up for breakfast.  What a terrific way to incorporate some additional nutrition into her (our) favorite breakfast. Thank you for posting this recipe- we will be sure to use it repeatedly.

These were good.  You could probably cut down on the sugar if your bananas are really ripe.  I omitted the dry milk and it was just fine.

Fantastic! My husband said these were the best pancakes he's ever had. I actually agree, and I usually don't like banana pancakes - they usually seem too mushy, but not these. I did make a few changes. I halved the recipe and still used a whole banana, used just an egg white and skim milk, added a couple shakes of cinnamon, and ground the oatmeal in the coffee grinder. Don't worry about the dry milk powder, I didn't have it and didn't miss it. I do highly recommend adding a tablespoon of vinegar to your milk and letting it sour for a few minutes. This is a way of making your own buttermilk, and it makes the pancakes fluffier. These will become a family tradition!

I've had this recipe in my box for a long time and I finally got around to making it.  I'm so glad I did because these are fantastic.  For a whole grain pancake, they have the perfect texture.  Healthy, but light and fluffy.  The only change I made was adding 2 tsp. cinnamon.  Soooo good!  I also figured out that this would be the perfect base for a healthy pumpkin pancake recipe.  I created a custom version, replacing the banana with 1/2 cup pumpkin puree and adding 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  So, soooo good!

These were delicious in my opinion. I did thin the batter a little more after letting them sit for 5 minutes with some milk. I subbed applesauce for oil, 2 bananas and no sugar. They were plenty sweet enough. I added 2 TBSP flax, cinnamon and some chopped walnuts. Yummy. Also, ended up with TONS of pancakes about 15 out of this batch and that was with one really giant one. Very healthy and good! Will make again.

I followed this almost to the letter, with the exception of souring my milk first. I thought that buttermilk would make it better. It was delish! I didn't expect the banana flavor to come through like it did with one banana, but it was a great surprise! Next time I will just beef the recipe up, by adding wheat germ and flax seed, but that is just a preference. Anyway, fantastic!!!

Even more wonderful with  BLUEBERRIES in them. Either mix the berries in or drop them on the uncooked side before flipping pancakes over. - - - 

Also, I freeze the leftovers (individually on a tray, then separate indivdual portions with wax paper and keep in a freezer bag). I pop them frozen in the toaster. Lovely quick breakfast.

The kids just helped me make these on a Saturday morning. They were delicious! I'll be freezing the leftovers for them for a breakfast treat during the week.  The only changes were- 1oz (2 TB) of agave nectar in place of the brown sugar, and some flax seed meal in place of some of the all-purpose flour. (I filled my scoop to about 2/3 cup with the flour and filled the remainder with the flax.) I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg. They would have been good with a second banana but I used my last one in this recipe.

Loved this one.  Added chopped pecans and a bit of cinnamon for good health, poured maple syrup over and my day was a little brighter.

Wonderful!  The kids loved them... especially with their requested chocolate chips.  What I liked was that I didn't feel so bad adding the choc chips because of the healthy recipe.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so I ground extra oats and increased the white flour (50/50) to make up for the 1 c. of whole wheat flour.  Thanks for posting!  I'm adding this to my permanent file.

Excellent recipe! I've been making this for a few months now and they are great with bananas or applesauce. My changes: I always add in the cinnamon. I use at least two bananas instead of one; one just doesn't give it enough banana flavor for my tastes. I usually swap the dry milk out for 1/4 to 1/2 cup buttermilk powder and then switch the milk out for water.   

I often make extra batches of the dry ingredients in ziptop bags and stash them in the freezer. Label the outside with the liquid ingredients and their measures. Then it's as easy for me or my hb to make these as a store-bought mix.

Amazing! We love these at our house. We have them at least once a week. My son whose allergic to milk (amongst other things) uses rice milk instead of reg. milk. It still tastes wonderful! I feel good about serving these to my kids, they're healthier than the alternative! Thanks for sharing:)

This is a fabulous base recipe -- good as written, but also good to sub and add other ingredients to.  Today I subed in the apple sauce for the oil, omitted the milk powder (as I didn't have any on hand), added ground flax and wheat germ, and also subbed in honey (a bit less than the 1/4 c) for the sugar.  Topped with fresh strawberries.  The whole family loved them.  I'm excited to try different variations on this recipe in the future.

I really enjoy making these pancakes for my 1 yr old son.  I use all whole wheat flour and omit the brown sugar and dry milk powder.  I usually make a double recipe of the dry ingredients so that I always have some pancake mix on hand for the weekends.  When I make the pancakes, I add 2 bananas and some honey to make up for the missing sugar and use 1 egg white instead of a whole egg.  I also omit the vegetable oil.  This makes for a very healthy meal to serve my son.  I also gave some of the mix to my father who is borderline diabetic so that he can have a healthier version of his favorite breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was okay. The main photo looks fantastic. Mine did rise up, because of the amount of baking powder, but the browning was definitely not as perfect looking or the shape. However, my real issue is I thought they were sort of doughy in the inside almost sort of still wet despite being done. That was not what I expected. Also, something about the banana taste I did not love. I have tried plain and wheat pancakes from the site, but these were just not my favorite. I believe a ripe, or very ripe banana, is not right for this recipe. The banana flavor is dominant and it needs a very fresh one unlike most baked recipes with banana. I gave it 4 stars, because they are fairly healthy, and I am also sure none will go to waste. They seem like they can be re-heated like most pancakes. They may even dry out a little by the next day. I made 1/2 recipe and got 5 med-large pancakes.

This was really great. I added chocolate chips to the tops of the pancakes while they were cooking. This will be a regular for us. I like the rolled oats idea, would like to incorprate this into other recipes. Thanks :)

This was delicious. My kids said that these were very moist and fluffy like restaurant pancakes. I used only whole wheat flour, none of the white and I added 2 teaspoons flax seed meal. I subbed applesauce for the banana.  I didn't add any sugar, because my kids always douse them with pancake syrup. I used half milk and half water, and omitted the dry milk. I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to help the baking soda. And I tripled the batch so that i could freeze some for us to eat later on in the week. I will definitely make again.

WOW....these were amazingly delicious!  I omitted the milk powder and used 2 ripe bananas and they were still fabulous!  My kids couldn't get enough of them!  Thanks for a great pancake recipe!

My family prefers this pancake over one with chocolate chips---so you know it's good! I didn't blend the oats, used them as is. Added some cinnamon just for the flavor. The pancake is pretty dense but super moist. Substituted same measurement of applesauce for vegetable oil. Be sure to use a very ripe banana. Used the 6 serving recipe and it made about ten 1/3c pancakes. Very delicious. Definitely a keeper--thanks!

These are good.  I made a double batch, which was a mistake, because you can only eat 2 of these -- they are pretty dense.

Great healthy pancake recipe!!! I changed it up a bit though using all whole wheat, skim milk, and no powdered milk. I also substituted honey instead of the sugar and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, ill prob add a bit more cinnamon next time!! Delicious and healthy I added almond butter on top of my pancake instead of butter or syrup!

Awesome pancakes!!!  We all loved these and will definitely be one of our weekly pancake recipes in this house.  This will be one of those recipes that I deliberately let bananas go brown to make.

I made these for my 11 month old and he loved them! I loved them too! they taste great. I did eveything like the recipe said ... except instead of blending my oatmeal , I just used my son's single grain baby oatmeal cereal. It was perfect....and it helped me gET RID OF THAT STUFF.... WE HAVE AN overabundance of it.

These were delicious & cooked up beautifully! I halved the recipe since it's just my husband & me eating. My husband hates bananas, so I made his with walnuts. Then I added a whole banana to the rest of the batter. My blender is broken so I used Oat Bran instead of Oatmeal. I don't use white flour so I subbed it with a mix of Wheat Bran, Wheat Germ & ground Flax. Hubbie is a diabetic so I just used a bit of Splenda. Absolutely delish, thanks for the recipe.

Went exactly by the recipes (well, I had 2 overripe bananas so I threw them both in). Very good. I've tried a lot of wheat or oat pancake recipes and they are usually a miserable failure, so I was pleasantly surprised by these. The only trouble -- the kids (1 and 3) weren't into them. My 3-year-old was in tears. The 1-year-old just didn't eat as much as usual. So I don't know if I'll make them again or not, but this is definitely the best so far.

Sundays are pancake day here. I rotate the kinds I make... These have become my kids favorite, they ask for these specifically a lot, so they are made quite frequently. :D I always double the recipe, and freeze the leftovers in baggies with 2 per bag, for quick breakfasts through the week. I leave out the milk powder and add extra banana... cook up half, then add mini chocolate chips to the other half. Thank you for posting the recipe :D

Turned out really well. I used quick cooking oats and didn't bother pre-grinding. I skipped the powdered milk, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I cut the sugar in half and added 1/2 extra mashed banana. My 18 month olds loved them!

The kids liked these.  11yo said the taste and texture were good, but they needed a lot of syrup to keep from being dry.  The toddler ate 3 big pancakes, but he's like a goat - he'll eat pretty much everything, lol.

Excellent!  Made as written except for leaving out powdered milk.  Great idea to put oatmeal in blender.  Turned out better than other recipes I have tried with oatmeal in the batter.  Also, great suggestion from reviewer to use blender for the banana and wet ingredients!  Might as well wince it's already out and it makes it quick and easy.  Great recipe!

I swear these are the best pancakes I've ever eaten! I used two bananas, omitted the sugar, and skipped the blender stage for the quick-cooking oats I used.

I used 2 medium small bananas instead of 1 2T applesauce instead of oil add 1.5T cinnamon next time I'll add more used buttermilk instead of mill and add chocolate chips. The batter made 17 pancakes 1/4 cup of batter per and besides the first one I burned they where good but a little chewy and not very fluffy

These are excellent and so healthy. If only my 2-year-old did not insist on "dipping sauce" (syrup) I would make these for him every day. I usually use more than one banana. If your bananas are ripe, you will probably not want to use the full amount of sugar. Don't skip it altogether, though, because it does affect how crispy the pancakes turn out. Today I didn't have an egg to put in, so I made a "flaxseed egg" using 1 tbsp. ground flax, 3 tbsp liquid. It worked fine. Oh, and I never seem to have milk powder in the house, so I always skip that.

I've made this recipe many times and love it. my 6yo son likes it too. I use agave nectar instead of brown sugar (reducing the liquid slightly) and water instead of milk (since it has the powdered milk already). I love to add choc chips and pecans. YUM! My best friend is vegan, and it adapts well (omit the egg and powdered milk, add a tablespoon of ground flax seed and use almond or soymilk for the liquid). It is a great base recipe!

These were great. a few changes.... I found older bananas gave it more moisture and a sweeter flavor. I also used applesauce in place of veggie oil. I used whole wheat flour and replaced one cup of milk with eggnog for a holiday remake... YUMMY!!

Good, hearty pancakes! I used whole milk and pastry flower for the all-purpose, something I would always recommend when making whole wheat pancakes. Great frozen and thawed for a quick breakfast, too.

Really yummy, I just doubled the vanilla extract and I suggest to use a large ripe banana if you want the taste to come out more. Also as mentioned before you can add 2 tsp of cinnamon.

These were very moist and fragrant pancakes.  I didn't use evaporated milk, I switched cow's milk for soy milk, I replaced the all-purpose flour with whole wheat (and substituted some of that with quinoa flour), AND I omitted the oil, using 2 tablespoons of homemade applesauce instead.  I cooked them in coconut oil.  My batter was quite thick so I found I had to form fairly small patties to have them cook thoroughly over med-high heat.  Used the leftover batter the next day.  Fast and easy breakfast option!  Thank you :)

Pretty tasty! I used apple sauce instead of oil, two bananas instead of one, and added some walnuts and cinnamon for good measure. They're very substantial pancakes.   I omitted the dry milk powder and didn't blend the oats, but was still satisfied by the yum of these pancakes.

I didn't have regular oats so I used three packages of instant oatmeal (Cinnamon Roll flavor) and it worked out well. They had good texture but are probably a little too healthy tasting for my family and very filling so. Don't know if I will make them again.

These are delicious! My three year old requested pancakes for his birthday dinner, so we whipped up a batch of these. I omitted the dry milk and subbed apple sauce for the vegetable oil. Topped with a berry compote, it was a big hit. Everyone cleaned their plates!

My preschooler is a picky eater, and he not only loves to put these pancakes together, he loves eating them.  I have tried other whole-grain pancake recipes but this is the one my 3 year old asks for again and again!  In terms of the recipe, I followed the directions to the T, minus the dry milk powder and adding 2T of freshly ground flaxseed.  We usually make a 1/2 recipe and save the leftovers for a mid-afternoon snack.   Thanks amom2boys!

So glad to see a good recipe for a healthy pancake that will give my kiddos energy for the day. Great texture that definately fills you up. My kids love them. MAde more than I expected: I got about 14 2-3 inch pancakes and 5 5-6 inch pancakes. Going to freeze the big ones for breakfast on a school day so I can toss them in the toaster.  Only gave 4 stars because I think I'd like more banana flavour, so next time I might add 2 bananas and they weren't my favorite with just maple syrup, BUT I really loved them with jam spread on top! My daughter says she's stuffed!!

A nice, hardy pancake. My little boy gobbled them up. We made ours in a frying pan, since we don't have a griddle, and medium-high ended up being too hot. They turned out best when prepared on medium heat or slightly below.

this is excellent...especially for being healthy.  I did use all WW flour in place of the AP, increased the vanilla to 2 tsp, added cinnamon to taste and doubled the bananas.  this will be my new "go-to" recipe from now on.  LOVE these!

Holy Cow- these are AWESOME!! My new favorite pancake! I used didnt use the dry milk, used all whole wheat flour and added cinnamon and used 2 smallish bananas instead of one. These came out tasting like a banana bread pancake. We didnt even use syrup! FANTASTIC!

Very good! I used applesauce instead of oil, no dry milk, no brown sugar, double the banana, himalayan salt, about 4 tablespoons of egg whites instead of a wholeegg, and added some soy protein powder to give it a more balanced meal. Served with sugar free rhubarb sauce on top and it was a hit with my husband!

These were great. Every other whole grain pancake I've tried is really flat and bland....not this one! I started off thinking that I would be substituting applesauce for the banana since we were out but upon taking the applesauce out of the fridge I noticed it was growing mold.....EWWW! In looking for something else to use I decided on pumpkin puree and it was a fantastic choice. So much so that I'm not sure we will be trying it with the bananas anytime soon.

Great recipe (with the addition of a tsp of cinnamon). I didn't have any dry milk powder, but it didn't matter.  They turned out really good.  This recipe made about 18 small pancakes.  I froze 12 of them in hopes of toasting them later this week.  Thanks for a healthier pancake option with basic ingredients.

Yummy recipe!  I would add another banana and/or maybe some other fruit (blueberries?) next time.  I had some trouble with keeping the right temperature on the stove, but that was just my lack of experience in making pancakes.  I made the whole batch, even though I was home alone.  I froze the leftovers, and can now have a pancake whenever I want!

Hearty and tasty.  I used 4/5 cup of oat flour instead of rolled oats (3/4 cup plus a tiny bit extra) and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top of the pancakes after pouring the batter on the griddle.  I'm still pleasantly full over two hours later.

Fabulous! I made a batch today so my family can eat them for breakfast this week. I used 2 very ripe bananas and left out the sugar as recommended by another review. I could smell the sweetness as they were cooking.

Very good, and great texture. A coffee grinder was perfect for grinding the oats. Followed the recipe except for substituting buttermilk for milk (then compensating by halving the b. powder and doubling the soda).

I've made this a lot, and it's delicious. This last time I replaced 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup banana, and it was even better. I freeze my bananas when they get mushy, then defrost in the fridge for recipes like this, so I think mine are a little wetter and mushier, which makes for even better pancakes!

My daughter just declared this, "the best pancakes I've ever had!" I have tried and failed many times to please her with homemade pancakes of every variation. The only thing I didn't add was powdered milk.I didn't have brown sugar, so I used 2 tablespoons of raw organic sugar which was perfect sweetness for us. I'm trying these again with applesauce and extra cinnamon instead of banana, probably add in some diced or shredded apple for texture.~~~Update, excellent with unsweetened applesauce and grated apples and cinnamon!!

Made this just as directed, the only exception being that my bananas were frozen (freeze overripe bananas in their skins, then thaw under warm water until the skin slips off.  Then I thaw completely in microwave and mash), and really small so I used 2.  These were not overly banana flavored, just a hint of delish sweetness, with the nutty wheat and oats.  Also used coconut oil in place of bad omega-6 veggie oil.  They cook up wonderfully and were perfect just as written!!

These pancakes are great!  My 10 yr old loved them as did my husband.  I didn't have dry milk so I just left it out, not sure what its for but they were great without it.  I think a half a cup of pecans or walnuts would be very good in them and will add them next time. Thanks!

I tried these and they were very yummy.  I used all whole wheat flour, no A/P, so they were VERY thick!  Not the worst thing; they sucked up the syrup well!  However I now know the rule of thumb to use 3/4c whole wheat flour in place of 1cup a/p flour.  I didn't use milk powder (didn't miss it) and I used quick cook oats (no grinding was required).  
Generally, you can't go wrong with pancakes.  I would make these again with the right proportions of ww flour.  Overall, delish!

Fantastic!  I wanted a recipe for pancakes that my girls could eat with syrup and I wouldn't feel horrible about all the sugar along with all the carbs of normal pancakes.  I followed some of the suggested substitutions (egg white vs egg and applesauce vs veg oil and no milk powder because I had none) to make it even more healthy hoping for okay pancakes.  But what I got were simply delicious healthy pancakes.  Phenom, amom2boys, you got it right here.  My girls can have syrup with these and they aren't sugarizing themselves.  Thank YOU!

Yummy! I haven't eaten this many pancakes since I was a child :-)

I used quick oats, no blending, soy milk and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. Oh, and I doubled the recipe, which wasn't needed. Original recipe makes a LOT!!

Outstanding!  My new go-to for pancakes.  Healthier and more filling = fewer pancakes needed.  The added cinnamon and nutmeg suggested by others really added subtle flavor.

These were okay. They tasted very bananany, which I love and were healthy which was great. I just couldn't get them all the way cooked through without burning and had to microwave the two I tried. All that was fine because I made them strictly to freeze and eventually toast for quick breakfasts.

I did make a couple of changes. I added cinnamon and nutmeg, without even looking at the other reviews that suggested adding them. And I switched the two flour amounts, which could be the reason for my cooking problem. 

And I got 15 pancakes, instead of 12.

My 11yo son found this recipe and made them for breakfast this morning.  They were great and everyone loved them.  I wasn't overseeing, but I know they must be easy enough that an 11yo can't mess up!

Deeeelicious!  I did have to omit the dry milk powder since I didn't have any, but added 2 tbsp of flax seed meal.  We loved these and next time, I'll add some mini chocolate chips to mimic my kid's favorite Eggo waffle flavor.  These are better and more wholesome!  Thanks!

My kids LOVE these! Omitted the milk powder and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Added a splash of milk to the batter to thin it out a bit. We divide into freezer portions for busy weekday mornings before preschool, etc. They thaw/heat easily and extremely quickly in the microwave on 50% power

TRY THESE!  Super hearty, filling, and taste and smell amazing (esp. w/ blueberries).  These are a great way to sneak nutrition into pancakes. They freeze well (layered w/ parchment paper), and I've even used them in place of a sandwich in my kids' lunches (2 pancakes w/ honey in between).  Since I have the blender out, I add in whole flax seeds with the rolled oats and blend, and I measure out double the dry ingredients & store 1/2 as a mix for next time. Omitted dry milk powder & have used 1 Tbsp. applesauce in place of 1 Tbsp. oil w/ no noticeable difference.

These seemed like they'd be really dense at first, but after I bit into one, I found them to be light and fluffy, but filling too!  Super yummy.

A great alternative to banana bread for those spotty bananas.  Excellent recipe.  threw in some extra banana and added flax meal just for fun--turned out super moist and yummy!

These are fantastic!  I omitted the milk powder (simply becuase I didn't have any on hand) and substituted applesauce for the oil and they were wonderful.  My kids (who hate anything wheat) devoured them and actually raved about them!

Just made these this morning!  Awesome!  My teenage daughter loved them!  Changes I made were: all whole wheat flour; cinnamon added; flax meal added; no dry milk powder; walnut oil; did not grind the oatmeal; used 2 bananas.  They were yummy!  This recipe is so very easy and I threw all the ingredients in my kitchen-aid blender and mixed them all up together.  Perfection!  I will make these again!

My kids love these!  I used white whole wheat flour instead of regular whole wheat, non-fat milk and didn't use the protein powder.  And to add a little extra nutrition I added roasted almonds to the end of the batter just for me!!

Followed the advice of changing milk to buttermilk, reducing the sugar, and blending the wet ingredients.  Tasted wonderful!  Some of our favorite pancake toppings are Nutella or peanut butter with maple syrup.  Both of these go well with the banana flavor!

I didnt blend the oatmeal, only because i'm lazy and didnt want to drag out the blender. But they still did turn out really good. Very hearty. Also i did not add the sugar into the mix, but did sprinkle a bit of cinnamon sugar onto each pancake as they cooked. they turned out just sweet enough for us :)

Although I added the oats before reading they were to be blended, these were very yummy pancakes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe except at the end, I added some chopped pecans to the batter and fried another chopped banana in butter and put on top.  Very Good and we served them to Dad for Father's day!

Wow!! These are excellent. They are fluffy and soft and honestly, a thousand times better than I expected. I served with fresh diced strawberries :) Also, for anyone on weight watchers, I got 20 small pancakes out of the written recipe (did not sub apple sauce) and they are worth 2 points each.  I ate 4 and WW counted it as 7.5 points.

When a pancake has enough flavor on it's own that you don't 'need' to add the extra's, you know it's a winner. Like this one! This recipe is perfect as written. Thanks for sharing it.

Excellent, hearty, tasty, healthy pancakes!  I used the original recipe quantities and it made 24 good sized pancakes.  I used quick oats in place of the rolled oats and chopped them with a hand chopper.  I also made the applesauce version substituting 1/2 c. of applesauce and 1 1/2 t. cinnamon in place of the banana.  I topped mine with Apple Butter while my husband enjoyed his with Blueberry syrup.  I appreciated the much higher nutritional value of this pancake over the typical pancake recipe.

Was a bit skeptical to begin with, but these turned out absolutely fantastic! My new favourite pancake recipe for sure. I skipped the powdered milk because I didn't have any handy and added just a FEW chocolate chips to some at the end, but to be honest, wished I hadn't, they were better without!

Wonderful. My two year old gobbled them up. I refrigerated what was left and ate them the next day, cold. I didn't have dry milk powder, so I omitted that. I used 2 bananas, and added pumpkin pie spice to the mixture. SO good!!

These were very good!  I couldn't eat them because of the whole "can't have gluten thing", but I had a tiny bite to figure out if I could feed it to my picky Hubby.  He loved them!

Best Pancakes and healthy too!  Added an extra banana.  Didn't have the dried milk, so skipped that out of necessity.    Really Really good.

Excellent!  These are now my favorite pancakes.  My husband and toddlers also love them.  We like to add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.  I also like them with chopped walnuts, but neither my husband or kids do.  These are such a hearty pancake, I don't need to make anything to go along with them.  One recipe of these by themselves feeds my family.  Thanks for the wonderful, delicious recipe.  Oh yeah, the blender works great for grinding the oatmeal!

Yummy recipe as written!  My bananas were little so I did use two, and I have real farm eggs that are huge (jumbo + size) but kept all else the same and they tasted great with just a little butter on them.  DH loved them =-)  DD (18) said they were OK because she just likes "plain" pancakes.  I think next time I may put some chopped pecans in them to increase the nutty flavor of the whole wheat and oatmeal and to add a nice counter texture to the mushy banana pieces.  Great nutrition and great taste--yummo!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I'm rating this on behalf of my granddaughters--they both loved these.  I liked everything about them except the banana (a major part of the taste).  What I found most appealing about these is the plumpness/texture.  I think next time I'll just leave out the banana when I make them just for us.

This is an incredible recipe that I have been using for a few years now. I don't bother with the powdered milk, otherwise I make it exactly as written. This recipe works great with other seasonal add-ins like apple sauce and cinnamon, chopped strawberries or blueberries, or even shredded zucchini and cinnamon for a zucchini bread pancake! If you are new to making pancakes, stir the batter until just mixed, let stand for 5-10 minutes, and DO NOT STIR again, that will result in a tough pancake.

My kids and I loved this recipe.  I have transitioned us to whole wheat and organic household and this was perfect.  I changed out the two diff flour combo and used whole wheat pastry flour, used organic unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil, and omitted milk powder, and used organic almond milk instead of reg milk.  I will be using this over and over again.  Thanks!!

I made this this morning and it came out great! I didn't use the milk powder, didn't have any. I used more wheat flour than white flour. I blended everything in the food processor. It came out delicious! I am going to freeze the rest and take it to work for breakfast.

My family enjoyed these and commented on how filling they were. Half a receipe served four adults. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg for additional flavor, but will add vanilla yogurt in place of some of the milk next time.

Great recipe! I modified it for the season and subbed pumpkin for the banana (about 3/4 cup) and added 1tsp of pumpkin spices. I also soaked the oats after I blended them because I only had old fashioned and I was worried they would be chewy. 
My kids love those!

I've been searching for a "go to" whole wheat pancake recipe, and I found what I was looking for with this recipe.  I did cut the recipe in half.  I also considered leaving out the oil, but then decided to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, since your body needs healthy oil every day anyway.  With the whole wheat flour, oatmeal egg and banana, this makes a healthy well balanced meal that is very satisfying.  A keeper for sure.

I was never a pancake fan until my husband made me these. I request them every weekend and we make extra for quick breakfasts before work. we do not use powdered milk or grind the oats, just leave them whole! great texture. we add blueberries, raspberries and chocolate chips! we add cinnamon and use coconut milk instead of cows milk. thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Yummy.  I had to add a little extra milk so the pancakes weren't so dense.  The teenages in the house liked them.  We will have extras to heat up during the week.

I made half a recipe, measured the pancake batter by 1/4 cup, and came out with 9 of them. I followed the recipe exactly and found them a little dense, which I expected due to the whole wheat flour. Still good though, especially topped with strawberries and bananas. I felt that I had made a healthy breakfast since I used whole wheat flour, skim milk, and fruit but had not sacrificed on flavor.

Tried these pancakes this morning, and they were okay.   Good, but I wouldn't say great and probably will not make again.  They cook up very thick, almost bread-like in texture.  After making a couple, I decided to add an additional banana and another tablespoon of oil, as it just seemed they were drier than I like.  I prefer a moister pancake, so depending on your taste, you may like the texture of these.  The taste was good, much like banana bread.  Overall, the texture was not great and sucked up syrup and therefore, I can only give this recipe 3 stars.

Great taste and texture.  Substituted 2 tbsp oil with 2 tbsp apple sauce and used all whole wheat flour.  Also added extra banana as per other suggestions and did not add powered milk.  Definitely a redo.

Delicious! We made these yesterday morning and thought they were great (though, we are very used to healthy and whole wheat pancakes). I ignored the dry milk powder altogether & just used everything else. Topped them with peanut butter and honey, yum!

These pancakes were fantastic!  I made the cinnamon applesauce version, as we are not big banana flavor fans here, and they were so moist and delicious!  Even my husband, who never likes pancakes, gobbled them up.  I made exactly to recipe and they were perfect.  Very light and fluffy and healthy :)

Yummy! Adjusted a thing or 2 to suit my weight loss needs.  I used only whole wheat flour and added a dash of cinnamon.  After everything was mixed, the batter seemed really thick, so I added a bit (less than 1/8 C) more milk.  Taste tested one topped with a thin spread of mixed berry cream cheese and it was wonderful.  Will be a great grab and go healthy breakfast.

These are seriously good pancakes!  I did make a few alterations that I felt worth mentioning.  I had two squishy bananas, so I added both. I did not add the milk powder like others have indicated.  I added two eggs because our farm eggs are small.  The main change was that I only added one cup of milk.  I think the batter would be way too thin. With my changes, the batter was exactly as I liked it.  They cooked wonderfully.  The taste was great and banana-y. I topped mine with strawberry syrup that I made.  It was sublime.  This recipe is a keeper.

Yum, yum and yum.  These are a delicious and wholesome breakfast.  A few additions I made:  using buttermilk for half of the milk and adding 2 tbls. of ground flax seed. Top with blueberries and fresh maple syrup.  You will not be disappointed.

Great recipe!  My pancakes came out very tasty.  I must admit, I didn't add a banana b/c I didn't have one, but I really wanted whole wheat pancakes for breakfast and this recipe (and the reviews) looked like a winner.  Also, based on other reviews, I didn't add the dry milk powder (didn't have any), but I did add nutmeg and cinnamon.  So yum! My husband and I ate 2 each and froze the other 4.  We took them to work for breakfast and just popped them in the toaster at work to reheat them. Everyone in my office said they smelled awesome! They tasted just as good as the first time.  We will definitely remake this recipe and maybe play around w/adding other fruit.  (And I'm going to try no all-purpose flour, too...some day.) Thank you!

Wonderful recipe. Made a nice batter and filling, slightly nutty and crunchy pancakes. I added a little wheat germ as well, but that was my only change. Served with real maple syrup and sliced bananas. Will definitely keep this one on file. Thank you for sharing!!

This is a great, healthy recipe!  I substituted oil for applesauce and 1/4 cup of the white flour for flaxseed. Delicious! My 2 year old who can be hard to please gobbled them up and asked for more.

Very, very good. I added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and they were delicious!   I threw everything into the blender (first the oatmeal to grind it) and mixed it that way.

These are always devoured when I make them.  I substitute Almond Milk for the 2 cups liquid milk due to a dairy allergy in the family.  Totally awesome pancakes!

These pancakes are freakin amazing! I was making pancakes to freeze, 5 of these never made it. Best banana pancakes I've ever had. Omitted the milk powder. And used vanilla soy milk. Also didn't realize that I was out of rolled oats so I used instant whole wheat oats but it didn't seem to have any ill effect. Will definitely make these again and again.

Excellent special Sunday pancakes! I omitted the powdered milk, substituted Greek yogurt for the vegetable oil and they were a huge hit! Our 11 year old ate 6 of them!

I love the subtle oat flavor and you can't go wrong with banana flavor pancakes. These were filling, taste really good and I ate mine without syrup because I enjoyed the flavor and subtle sweetness so much....a plus if you're watching your waistline. Oh and I used regular milk! These can be tweaked easily as well....throw in any fruit you like.

Tastes like banana bread in pancake form! Soo delicious! Listening to others' suggestions, I omitted the dry milk powder.  I also doubled the amount of banana and added flax seed. Such a great recipe. Will definitely make again.

You can skip the milk powder and it does not change the recipe. These are DELICIOUS! Add frozen blueberries or mini chocolate chips for a real treat.

These are wonderful!  Mixing the wet ingredients in the blender made it a pretty quick and painless process, too.  I accidentally added too much banana because I spaced that I was halving the recipe for a sec, but the extra fruity flavor was actually great.

To quote the well known foodie Stewie Griffin, "Click click, bloody pancakes!"

I made this recipe with applesauce and cinnamon instead of the banana.  I replaced 1/4 cup of the white flour with flax meal and omitted the oil altogether.  The pancakes came out great--both my husband and my toddler were impressed.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Wasn't overly fond of the banana. Seems like a good base recipe. I was going to leave out the banana but was worried it wouldn't be moist enough.

These pancakes are amazing!  My hubby doesn't usually go for the "whole wheat' option but he LOVED these!  I used 2 bananas in the mix which made it more moist. I also used only whole wheat flour which was a risk but well worth it.  Will make again and again!!

I use this recipe over and over.  It is fantastic!  Also, you can do the recipe with all wheat flour (no white)and it is great too (just add 1-2 extra tsp of baking powder to help them rise better).

Thank you for an awesome pancake recipe! Our Saturday morning pancake breakfast just got a serious facelift! I used only whole wheat flour instead of a little all purpose (everything else the same) and they were so awesome. Hearty and delicious. Great texture. Paired this with fresh strawberry sauce (look up blueberry sauce recipe here..it's super simple)

AMAZING. LOVE THESE! And my kids (2 & 4) did, too! I did add a little sprinkle of chocolate chips to the batter for fun :) But, they did not even eat them with syrup! I also put in an extra banana as mine were small. Will make these again anyday!!!

Great recipe—thanks for sharing! I made a few modifications only because I didn't have a few of the ingredients, but still turned out great! I substituted a single-serving container of organic, no sugar-added apple sauce for the banana, folded in a cup of blueberries, and didn't have all purpose flour on hand, so just used the ground oatmeal and whole wheat flour. Also used rice milk, instead of "regular." Both my husband and I loved these and will definitely make them again!

I made this recipe today with a few modifications: added added 1/4 cup ground flax, about 1 TB applesauce, some cinnamon, nutmeg as well as 2 scoops protein powder and a big handful of frozen blueberries. I blended all the liquid ingredients in the blender and then mixed them into the dry.  Came out great - my family loved them.  Thank you!!

Wow, these pancakes were very good--my family loved them.  I adjusted the recipe just a little...I used 3/4 cup quick oats--which I didn't put in the blender, 1/4 cup ground flaxseed, 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour, 2 Tbs white sugar, did not use dry milk and used olive oil intsead of vegetable--basically still the same recipe, with a few healthy twists.  I will definitely make these again : )

I started making my own pancake mix a few months ago, and this is a great recipe.  The only adjustments I made was to use instant oats (skipped the blender), egg beaters (cut the fat/cholesterol) and I used skim milk.  I also added 1 tablespoon of wheat germ.  All in all a great recipe, with a few tweaks for the weight conscious.

These were yummy.  I didn't have powdered milk.   I used a scoop of vanilla-flavored protetin powder from GNC instead so that it gave the kids some protein.  It was perfect.  I can see why you blend the oats.  I used 2 bananas, too, but mine were barely ripe.  I will use more brown ones next time, or just add banana flavoring.  That's what I do to smoothies.  I can imagine these are great with choc. chips or Nutella!  This recipe is a keeper!

This is my new favorite pancake recipe. I love being able to feed my family pancakes and not feel bad about it. Even though I burned several (I suggest using med-low heat), they were still moist and delicious.

My 3 yr old and I really love these.  We added a touch more brown sugar and vanilla and also doubled the bananas.  Also replaced the oil with applesauce.  Super yummy and healthy!  Oh, forgot that we also added 2 tbsp ground flax seed for extra protein and couldn't even taste it. :)

These were great!  I only made 1/2 the recipe because there are only 2 of us.  I did not have dry milk powder so did not use any but they were still fine.  Will definitely make again, probably with less brown sugar because the banana alone seemed to make them sweet enough.

tasteless, can't taste banana or vanilla, texture is ok but not our favorite. I like the idea of using whole wheat flour but pancakes  need much more flavor, use 2 bananas instead of 1,

Followed the recipe except for blending the oatmeal...  I just used 2 packages of instant oatmeal, and it turned out really yummy.  Soft and fluffy.  I threw in some chocolate chips and it was super good.

These are excellent. I make them all the time. I use mainly all whole wheat flour and just a little white. Still tastes great. No need to blend up the oatmeal, you don't even notice it's in there. I never make with dry milk, since I never have any. And I only use about half the amount of brown sugar it calls for, and they don't miss it. I make them at night sometimes for dessert, so I add a few chocolate chips, healthier than ice cream or cookies and the kids love them!

These are excellent pancakes! I will never buy store bought mix again. I made a few changes just to make them a bit healthier and they turned out fantastic.  I used all whole wheat flour and substituted applesauce for the oil.  I also didn't add the dry milk (not sure what benefit this has). Next time I will try cutting down the brown sugar and adding in a bit of Wheat Germ.

Very good pancakes!  I only made a couple of changes to the recipe.  I had oat flour on hand so used that instead of processing oatmeal.  I omitted the banana and added blueberries.  Yum!

Left out the milk powder, added cinnamon, chopped the oats on a cutting board, and used peanut oil instead of veggie oil.  These were good and I will be making them again.

ehh i honestly don't like these pancakes..they were kinda fluffy but not as much as i would have liked. also, the banana and other flavors was very lacking. i think that there should be an exact measurment for the amount of banana cuase banana sizes vary a lot

Yummy! Much better than regular pancakes! These have great flavor and are super filling. I used applesauce instead of bananas, and my husband and I thouroughly enjoyed! We had a few left over so I froze them. Will try heating them up in the toaster. Thanks!

What an easy peasy, and healthy recipe!  I halved it, and it yielded 12 medium-sized pancakes (4 of which burned, but that was my fault).  I didn't have dry milk powder, so I left it out, and I also left out the sugar because I like using honey on them later. :)  Even though I halved the recipe, I used the full banana and vanilla extract.  Also added cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves to the dry ingredients.  I started off making them in a cast iron pan, but woooo boy, that cooks them much too quickly on the outside, leaving the inside slightly undercooked.  So I'd suggest using a regular non-stick pan and drop a tiny bit of oil in there, smear it around with a paper towel... and do that for each batch.  They cook pretty quickly, by the way.  I ate mine the unconventional way, with almond butter, chopped walnuts, and a drizzle of honey (maple would also be great, of course)!  Next time, I'll add some ground flax seed, too!  I bet you can also add fresh berries to the batter.. yum yum.

Yummy!!  I mixed up the dry ingredients the night before.  Made for an excellent, quick & easy breakfast. I didn't have dry milk powder so omitted it, and they still came out great.  I used a combination of vanilla almond milk, orange juice, and 1% milk for the 2 cups total of liquid.  Added blueberries to the pancakes on the griddle, and served with blackberry sauce.  (I had berries to use up...)  Will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks for sharing it!

These were very super good! Just what I wanted! We defrosted some blueberries and sliced strawberries added one extra banana and bam! They were AMAZING! Tip when using frozen berries drain the juice into a seprate bowl add some syrup and you have berry syrup to use...

Wonderful recipe.  I love the fact that I'm sending my kids off to school with this  in their system and not junk cereal.  I use the sugar free Log Cabin syrup and they don't get that sugar high, then low that leads to them lacking concentration.  Very, very good.

These were really good!  Great for me because I need low sodium.  I cut the salt in half and they were still very tasty.  Had a little batter left over (they were very hearty!) and it was still good the next day.  We'll do these again.

I made these just as the recipes calls, only left out the brown sugar and added one banana.  Delicious, moist, perfect!  I put them in the freezer and take a couple each morning and pop them in the toaster.  Crispy and delicious like when they were fresh!

Awesome and very versatile! My whole wheat flour tends to be very dry, so I either add more liquid or cut it down a bit. Added a little pumpkin pie spice and my toddler ate it in a flash!

My family gobbled them up and asked for more!  I made them with applesauce instead of banana.  I also used milled flax seed instead of the oil to make them even more healthy.  The kids already want to know when we can have pancakes again.

This is okay; the flavor is a bit bland, even after adding another tsp of vanilla extract.

I started to make this recipe, scaled to 9 servings and realized I had a few issues.  First, I couldn't split an egg in 1/2 so I ended up using 2 eggs.  Also, I ran out of oats and wheat flour.  I tried to accomplish the same goal by using some ground flax in place of the lacking oats and some wheat germ/ white flour in place of the missing wheat flour.  OMG...these were sooo good.  Very delicious banana flavor.  Cooked nicely.  I couldn't have asked for a better recipe.  We tried them with maple syrup and a syrup made from 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup butter, and cinnamon.  While our family was divided, more of us preferred the honey syrup on this one.  Yummmmm.

The best oatmeal pancakes I've ever had! I used all whole wheat flour and substituted the oil for applesauce. They were moist and fluffy.

I blended all in my blender... left out the milk powder, but added some ground flax seed.  Banana pancakes always seem heavy/dense to me, but other than that they were great.

I made these panckes for my breakfast this morning. they were pretty good. I followed the other reviews and I added 2 bananas and just 2 TBS of brown sugar  (I think I`ll use honey the next time). I did`t have milk powder so I did`t add any , I think the milk powder will make them more fluffy specially after using two bananas (two bananas tend to make them more heavy). I did`t grind the oats , and I added a pinch of cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate chips. thank U for the recipe.

My family and I love these pancakes. They are a Sunday morning tradition. I add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon in addition to all the other ingredients. I also grind the oats into flour in our bullet.

These were fantastic.  Everyone from my health-food phobic husband to my won't eat anything two year old gobbled these up.  I did throw a handful of mini chocolate chips in (but the would be great w/o it).  I didn't have powdered milk - so I omitted it.  I also added cinnamon as others suggested.  New Weekend tradition

I love these pancakes! I didn't bother to blend the oatmeal, but I like the texture of  whole oats. I skipped the oil and just used applesauce, didn't miss it at all. We love ours with strawberries, or blueberries, or both. I have used all whole wheat flour with it with good results, a little bit heavier but still good. I have let the batter sit overnight in the fridge and it cooks up so fluffy in the morning. They don't even need syrup they are so yummy, yogurt on top is tasty though.

These are great! They're rather dense unlike your normal pancake, but delicious not the less. I left out the milk powder and added blueberries.

This is an excellent recipe.  They are filling and healthy and my kids liked them too.  Just like the previous review - the possibilities are endless!  They don't have a whole-wheat texture if you're trying to sneak a healthy item by the kids and the oatmeal adds a great texture to them.  Try this recipe!!

Wonderfully tasty!  I didn't follow the recipe 100%, but they were still wonderful.  I didn't blend the oats (on account of not having a blender), cooked them in a stove-top skillet, turned down the heat (on account of slightly burning the first 3), added a second banana, and added two squares chocolate almond bark. All-in-all, a delicious breakfast.

This is a healthified pancake, with the emulsified oatmeal and whole wheat flour.  I used buttermilk powder in place of regular powdered milk and added cinnamon and nutmeg for extra spice.  I'll be using this recipe with and without the mashed banana.

Never had pancakes come out so perfect! I added 2 Tbsp lemon juice to sour my milk so increased baking soda by another 1/2 tsp. Used applesauce instead of banana (didn’t have). Very good! Thank you.

Very good!! Only made small changes. Used all whole wheat flour and no all-purpose, 2 bananas instead of 1, and subbed applesauce for the oil. They rose up very well and were delish with a sweetness to them that didn't require syrup (although we still used some anyway!).  Definitely a new family favorite!

I added oatmeal with wet Ingredients in blender, then mixed with dry ingredients.  Added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Delicious!!

These were great!  I omitted the milk powder and threw everything else in the blender. Added a little cinnamon and chocolate chips. Next time I think I'll try skipping  the AP flour and add blueberries :-)

Definitely keeping this recipe!  The only change I made was to substitute the refined flour with whole wheat pastry flour and added some cinnamon.  Added blueberries to half the recipe and found that the pancakes with blueberries were better.  Pancakes do tend to be thick but pressing down to flatten helps.  Will make this recipe again - and will try bananas!

these were awesome for me and my kid
and easy to reheat leftovers in toaster. 
did not have powdered milk- np, and no banana so used applesauce. 
tasty!
oh, and first time i used my blender to grind something. so easy to do the oats!

Wonderful! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1% milk,  substituted coconut oil because I don't like cooking with vegetable oil, and I also used Truvia to replace the sugar because I limit my kids sugar intake. Once done I topped them off with the fruit I had around the house. Pineapples, apples, peaches, cactus fruit, bananas and frozen blueberries. AMAZING! This is a keeper!

We loved this. I did change the recipe a bit but not much. I just didn't grind the oatmeal. I soaked it in the milk for 5 min. Or more wile I was preparing the other thins. I didn't use powdered milk (didn't have any). I added a second well ripened banana, and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and used all whole wheat. Otherwise everything was the same. They turned out great.

I made this recipe as written, except for substituting 3tbs of butter for the 2tbs of oil (we cook with cast iron and it can be a little sticky). Served with apple sauce and maple syrup, light, yet filling and with a nice texture to each bite. It was an instant family hit - fabulous!

I used leftover cooked oatmeal, no milk powder, unsweetened almond milk, 1 tbs.coconut sugar(which next time I won't put any sugar) still plenty sweet.  Especially if you like your pancakes with maple syrup on top.  Delicious!  My favourite.

I made it according to the recipe.  These are heavy which is good if you want the family to fill up fast and not have to stand at the griddle for the whole morning.  I will probably make them again because they are easy and I usually have all of the ingredients.  I probably won't serve them to guests though.

the kids loved it. I added extra milk because the kids are under 3 and it is easier for them to eat slightly flatter pancakes. I topped with Nutella and tiny banana slices and they gobbled it up!
I used fresh ground flour which gave a hint of a nutty flavor that complemented the oats well

Yum! A lot of ingredients it seemed at first. But when I started to add them, it was all pretty much what I had in the pantry and took no time to whip up a batch. My family wanted to eat again next morning. Thank you for your post!

These are delicious! I used vanilla protein powder instead of the dry milk, just under 1/4c of brown sugar, and soy milk instead of cow milk. Plus, 90% organic ingredients. Because I was short on time, I mixed all the wet ingredients in the Vitamix  first, then added the dry ingredients. Perfectly delicious topped with grade B maple syrup and chopped pecans or walnuts!

The recipe is fantastic! Like others, I opted to omit the powdered milk, but that was solely because it was a spur of the moment recipe and I do not normally stock that particular ingredient.

Flip flopped the flour amounts, halved the sugar, subbed applesauce for oil, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 nutmeg. Put egg, banana, vanilla, applesauce in blender. Used regular oats put thru the blender.

I'm also opting for more healthy ingredients these days so I omitted the powdered milk, instead I used 1 cup of whole fat coconut milk and I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Instead of brown sugar I used 2 Tablespoons of maple syrup. I didn't grind the oats but put them in with the coconut milk and let it set for about ten minutes then added the other wet ingredients including the mashed banana. While that was resting I mixed up the dry ingredients. I used white whole wheat flour for the flours. While they were cooking I sprinkled  some frozen Maine wild blueberries on top of the batter and pushed them down in just a bit. The batter was a little too dense so I added some unsweetened whole cashew milk just enough to thin it out a bit. The result was so scrumptious! I will definitely be making these again!

I was looking for a healthy recipe to use my ripe bananas that wasn't banana bread (already made that) and this looked like a great way to go. I prepared the dry and the wet and went to get the bananas to mash and they were gone! Husband must have thrown them away because they were too ripe! ugh, plan B, put 1 cup of cinnamon applesauce in them.  They were delicious.

These were really tasty pancakes. I don't know if I should really leave a review since I did tweak it a little. I left out salt and sugar to make it baby-friendly, used buttermilk instead of milk, added flax meal, substituted whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, used walnut oil instead of vegetable, added some spices, added walnuts, and left out dry milk powder.
Nonetheless, the result was tasty and had a great texture.

Great recipe. I added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also made some with nuts and chocolate chips - super yummy. I had oatmeal flour on hand, so that saved me a step. I skipped the dry milk.

So good. I put the oats in the food processor and ran it for a few minutes then I dumped the rest of the items in and let my food processor do the work. They were really good very picky hubby even liked them. Oh I used Almond Milk also.

I really enjoyed these. I was already tweaking a pancake recipe I had. Then I can across this recipe I was thrilled because short of a few difference it was just like my "tweaked" version, but completed.

I appreciate this recipe since it's not all all purpose flour ... ick!

I liked them as they were but did not love them ... for my household, I needed more bananas, no sugar and I hate veggie oil. They did cook up nice and fluffy though but many were left over.

The tweaks I made to this recipe were as follows:

*I used virgin coconut oil instead of veggie.
*I used 3 bananas (yes, I love nana pancakes lol) instead of 1.
*I did not use any sugar, instead I used 30 drops of liquid stevia.
*Since the milk powder is only there as a source of protein, I substituted almond flour instead.
*Also you could use coconut or almond milk for these and it works great and make them dairy free!

Next time I will replace the APF with a combo of sorghum/millet and see how they come out.

None of these were left over and also no syrup was needed for them although my hubby always puts syrup on his pancakes and he did with these also ... but it was not "needed" Enjoy everyone!!

Thank you so much for this recipe, it saved me a lot of time.

These are AMAZING! I made a few changes: didn't process the oatmeal, I like to taste the whole grain. Also I used 100% whole wheat flour, not all purpose. Added 3 tbsp of chia seeds and replaced the milk for almond milk. Simply delicious!

So I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out because I didn't have wheat flour. But I wanted to have banana oatmeal pancakes for breakfast. I used 1 3/4 cup all purpose flour and my husband proclaimed these to be the best pancakes I ever made. I will have to get some wheat flour to make them next time according to the directions

These were delicious! I did 1 cup whole wheat and 3/4 cup white whole wheat with 1/4 cup applesauce and omitted the banana and dry milk. They were huge and fluffy with a great flavor!

This is delicious and healthy. I don't add the powdered milk ( because I don't have any) or oil. I add walnuts and a handful of chocolate chips. Yummy!

These are by far my favorite pancakes I have ever ate! I have added or substituted (I always sub the bleached flour for whole wheat) many things experimenting with new flavors and it has never let me down. They are exceptionally fluffy and taste amazing. Not only do I love them, so does my family, and even my anti-whole wheat nephews.

Followed the recipe (except the milk powder and grinding the oats completely down). The pancakes tasted good, but they were really huge and kind of heavy. For this recipe to make twelve pancakes, those pancakes must be pretty big. I might make these again and just halve the recipe, or I'll stick to my previous recipe which my husband and I can actually finish over breakfast.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!  Family loved 'em, and as an added bonus - healthier than standard p'cakes.  These were by far the best pancakes I have ever had/made (even better than buttermilk pancakes).  Would highly recommend.  Did not have powdered milk.  Dash of cinnamon was great too!

This is an excellent healthy pancake.  You do have to spread out the batter thin to make sure it cooks through, but they are great.  It's one of the only healthy things my kids happily eat.  One time, I forgot to grind the oats and found that I liked the little bit of chewiness that it added, and I liked not having to wash my blender!  And, they taste just as good substituting some of the white flour for even more whole wheat.  Thanks so much for sharing your awesome recipe.

Fantastic! I wanted to make Fluffy Pancakes but with a healthier kick so I just added 1/4 cup of organic vinegar to the milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes or so. I did everything else the same but added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and some cinnamon to the mix. With the last four pancakes I added fresh organic blueberries and they were fantastic!

This if my first time writing a review.  The recipe appeared healthier than most so I decided to give them a try.  One reviewer stated they did not taste very "bananaee", so I decided to change up the recipe to suit my taste.  I mashed my one banana, beat in the one egg and halved all the other ingredients and added a few shakes of cinnamon.  I used quick cooking oatmeal but did not use a blender.  I didn't have dry milk, so omitted.  After letting them sit for 5-10 minutes they were just right to put on the griddle.  They were soooo good with a little maple syrup.  Thanks amom2boys for submitting.

My family really like these.  The only changes I made was to use quick cooking oats and didn't blend them up and I used a banana and a half.  I don't keep milk powder on hand either so I omitted it.  They brown pretty quickly because of the banana so watch them close.  Very yummy!

These are okay ... not a lot of banana flavor at all.  Used quick oats instead; our blender is broken so I couldn't blend them, but letting the batter sit for 5 minutes and then putting on the griddle took care of them I think b/c they are so thin.  Even added a little cinnamon, but to no avail.  We'll look for a more banana-y recipe for next time.

It is obvious these don't need any substitutions.  However, I made a few. I made the whole thing in my Ninja blender which made it so easy.  I omitted the powdered milk because we don't use it.  I used coconut milk as we are trying to reduce our dairy consumption.  I used two bananas.   And they were awesome...declared better than normal pancakes.  This one is definitely going into my go-to file for regular use.

Just made these this morning.  It worked well to blend the flours and the oatmeal in a blender and to blend the wet ingredients separately, then stir them together.  Our whole family really enjoyed them!

After reading the other reviews I added an extra banana (I had 2 very ripe bananas) and omitted the brown sugar, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I was surprised at how fluffy these turned out.  I can't wait to try with apple or pumpkin as other reviewers suggested.

This is a great recipe! I was really happy with the way the pancakes turned out. The only thing that was a little frustrating was the cooking time- I couldn't seem to get it quite right. Might have needed to thin the batter or change the temperature of the stove.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as it is, except...
1. I halved it (and it made 6 pancakes [I used about 3 spoonfuls of batter to make each cake. The last one was a bit larger, though]--just as the recipe said it would. I ate 3 and was full)
2. I left out the dry milk powder
3. I used a food processor instead of a blender for the oats.
4. I threw in a whole banana although the recipe called for 1/2 a banana (since I halved it)--definitely a good choice!
5. I added a bit of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the batter.
Loved these. Very tasty. In the future I will double the amount of banana again and add cinnamon and nutmeg since that worked so well this time around.

SO DELICIOUS and insanely sweet! They taste better than regular pancakes. Syrup was almost unnecessary.
   We (college students) halved the recipe, but even for 2 people that was a mound of pancakes. I'd say half the recipe would feed 3-4 provided you also served it with some fruit or another side. 
  We used all whole wheat, half the amount of brown sugar, double the amount of banana, light vanilla soy milk, and left out the dry milk powder.   Next time I'll probably leave out the brown sugar and experiment subbing applesauce for the oil. This would definitely be fantastic with some walnuts as well.

Minus the milk powder, I made this the first time as directed.  Very good recipe...everyone loved them.  The next time I substituted about 6 oz. canned pumpkin for the banana and added about 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  Another winner!!  Will also try with applesauce and chopped apple.

Great recipe. Usually, when I try a recipe for the first time I like to follow the recipe closely. Then, if,I like it well enough I make it again ... and maybe make some changes if I believe I can tailor it more to my personal taste preferences or make it more healthy. For this recipe I had some leftover cooked oatmeal ... about two cups worth. I only had whole wheat flour and used almond milk. I also passed on the dry milk powder. I addition, I added some cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. Great recipe as is or with my changes. Thank you!!!!!

I have made pancakes for a long time just using bisquick, but my husband never really liked them so I went on the hunt for a new recipe. These were great, and healthy too. The oatmeal makes them so fluffy. I usually slice the banana instead of mashing them sow e really get the taste of the banana. But it's also a great way to sneak in some fruit if you have a picky eater, and they are very moist.

These are AMAZING! Though I would deffinantly add twice as much banana as called for next time. The banana makes it sweet enough you do not even need syrup. yumm!

These were super yummy!  I just changed a couple things: I added 1/4cup ground flax seed, about 2tblspoons cinnamon, and more vanilla. I also used 2 bananas, coconut oil instead of veggie oil, and I ended up adding probably another cup or so of milk and water to thin them out since they were pretty thick, but that's probably because of the other stuff I added.  But turned out to be probably my favorite pancakes I've ever made.  But I topped them with whipped cream and strawberries so that's hard to beat in general =)

These are awesome! I never  blend the oats, and really see no need to, they are very small to begin with and you won't notice. I always use 2 or 3 bananas as well. We love these things at my houst! Thanks!

The perfect pancake!  My son says they taste like cookies, they freeze well, and are super filling while being pretty healthy - and for the people that don't love weat flour or oatmeal, neither one is overpowering.  I found that cooking them slowly at a lower temp. than usual worked best and made them rise up super fat - I had the electric griddle set at about 275.  Yummy!  Thanks!

fantastic recipe!  these yield a sweet pancake with delicious banana flavor.  the wheat flour adds nice texture.  I skipped the dry milk powder as I didn't have any, and would certainly make these again.

I really enjoyed these pancakes; however, next time I make them I am going to leave out the bananas and slice them on top instead. The only change I made was I subbed unsweetened apple sauce for the oil. Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to make these again!

Okay, I'll be the meany. I love making my family whole wheat pancakes, but the banana in here was unappealing to me. My kids GOBBLED them up, so we compromised and gave it 3 stars. LOVE the healthy oats AND whole wheat flour, that's why we gave this a try.

These were good, and I love how healthy they are. My only little complaint is that they were a tad dry, I had to use a LOT of syrup on them. I would NOT add more banana like others said, I think that would make the banana taste overwhelming. Next time I will try adding some mango or strawberry.

My husband said " yum, these taste like banana bread" and my daughter gobbled them up (with a few added chocolate chips in hers).  I followed the recipe exactly and added 1/2 cup of homemade applesauce, cinnamon and nutmeg.  These were delicious and so healthy.

Yum yum yum. I made these today for a Football game brunch. They were a hit with the kids and parents alike. I did not have any whole wheat flour, so I used all unbleached flour and rolled oats. I also did not have any milk powder. Would be good to make the dry stuff ahead of time. So delish!

Excellent!  I didn't have whole wheat flour on hand, so I used 1 cup white flour, 1/3 cup ground flax seed, and 1/2 cup wheat bran.  I also used instant rolled oats.  Sweetened with Splenda.

Delicious!!!  I added a tablespoon of flax seed and omitted the milk powder.  Also used two super ripe bananas instead of one.  I may try it with the sugar next time, since it was sweet.  But these were just my preferences.  It was a fantastic healthy twist on one of my favorite breakfast foods!

We don't blend the rolled oats, it adds texture to the pancakes. It tastes great without the oil too. This recipe is a KEEPER! Super healthy and can be incorporated into dieting.

Probably the best home-made pancakes I've every had, by far.  I did just a spoonful of brown sugar instead of the 1/4 cup.  I used two bananas instead of one (if you love bananas like I do, highly recommended).  I also used apple sauce instead of oil.

Yummy! I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used 1/2-cup buckwheat flour and the rest regular all purpose. Added an extra banana and used a smidge less sugar. Blended all the wet ingredients in the blender (too lazy to smoosh bananas by hand this morning). The whole family loved them; tasted like banana bread (only fried in butter) ... YUM!!!
