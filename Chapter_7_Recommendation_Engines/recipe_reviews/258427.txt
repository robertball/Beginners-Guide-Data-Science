These were excellent! I forgot the avocado in the picture but I made as written and wouldn't change a thing. I have made a lot of fresh salsa but there was something about this one that really impressed me. 5 stars all the way!

Absolutely delicious! The salsa was a bit spicy for my 5-year-old and 2-year-old but otherwise we loved it. My husband said, “This is a keeper.”

No subbing on this lovely recipe. I’m 63 and this is the best recipe that I have ever used. I have followed hundreds of recipes. I rarely cook  from a recipe more than once. Too many recipes, too little time. This one is the exception.   I’m,thinking monthly. I won’t change anything except I will try with different proteins. Fish,chicken,pork,etc.   ThankYou times 1000
