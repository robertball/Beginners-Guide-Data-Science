Made this with trout my husband caught up in AR couple of weeks ago.  It was good.  A little boring for me but still easy and came out very flaky and tender. My husband thought it was good too.

I’ve made this recipe a number of times with a couple of substitutions for ingredients. Instead of bell pepper I use fresh sliced jalapeño peppers, and I’ll also slice lemon to put inside the cavity,  wrap them in aluminum foil and put them directly on the coals.

I have cooked trout this way for years. However I use stuffing mix (stovetop our similar) to fill the fish. Works easily with campfire our on grill. I also place thin sliced butter between foul and fish inn each side. The fish skin will peel right off with the foil when you open it and leaves a moist, flavorful trout with it's own side dish. Perfect when camping and fresh caught trout.
