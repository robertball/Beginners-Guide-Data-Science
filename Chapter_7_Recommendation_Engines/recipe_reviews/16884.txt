After reading the reviews, I used this recipe as a jumping off point and made the following changes: Used 2lbs of ground sirloin, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cheddar cheese soup, a full bag of tater tots, and a can of french style green beans. I browned the beef with the onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon greek seasoning. I then mixed the soups and 1 cup of milk into the meat after it was browned and drained. I layered the greenbeans on the bottom of a 9X13 casserole dish, spooned the meat mixture over it, then sprinkled 2 cups of shredded cheddar over that, then topped with the tots, which I patted down into the cheese. sprinkled the whole thing with some fresh ground pepper, and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. 
For those other reviewers who complained about blandness, well I think it's common sense to season your meat while cooking, and hey, be adventurous and use this recipe as a starting point, tweak it with different soups, cheeses, spices...My family and I really enjoyed this dish, and while I did make changes, I think this recipe deserves 5 stars for a great basic recipe, and inspiration. I am looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, I am betting that like most casseroles like this, it'll taste even better tomorrow! :)

This is one of my family's favorite recipes. I do layer it a bit different, as we like the potaotes crispy. I pour the soup mixture over the ground beef, then add half the cheese, top with the potatoes, then sprinkle with a bit more cheeese, resulting in a crispier topping. Good comfort food.

This recipe is pretty good, I've made it 2 times.  I recommend mixing the soup and milk into the meat and leaving the cheese and tater tots on top.  I also used a whole bag of tater tots.  The tots came out nice and crunchy which is what i wanted.

I have made this recipe several times, but I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I had to improvise.  I used 1# ground beef, 1 chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper, and worcestchire sauce.  I cooked that over med-high heat and after it was cooked I added 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can of milk and mixed it all together.  I then poured that into a greased dish and topped it with cheddar and colby cheese.  Following that, I topped it with tater tots. ( there are also new mashed potato tots from Ore-Ida that are AWESOME!)  I baked that for about half an hour then put it on broil for about five more min.  Then topped it with more shredded cheese.  My husband loved it....with ketchup of course.  I have to say I have made this many ways...I find it best with corn mixed in....and a nice fresh salad on the side...this is one of those meals that you have to balance out..in order to relieve some of the guilt of eating it!  But man is it good..it is great mexican style too, with peppers and onions mixed into the beef and taco seasoning. Campbell's makes a great fiesta cheese soup that mixes well with this too.  It is one of those meals that you can do almost anything too.  It is hard to screw it up. ENJOY!!!

I'd give this recipe 4 stars 'as is' and 5 stars with a few adjustments.  I put canned green beans and/or corn in the bottom of the pan, layer ground beef seasoned with a little garlic over that, then pour the soup mixture over, sprinkle shredded cheese and top with tatortots.  Great comfort food!

I love this recipe.  Every time I make this, my kids go back for seconds and even thirds!  That automatically makes it a keeper in my book.  I've tried it two ways, I've poured the soup over the tots and I've also poured the soup over the meat and put the tots on afterward.  I actually like it better with the soup over the tots because they come out creamy and it mixes together more like a casserole this way.  We also always use ground turkey rather than beef.  Yum!!

I was surprised at how good this tasted.  My husband liked it to.  I used low fat/low sodium soup (omitted the milk since soup was not condensed); used low fat cheddar and soy cheddar and low fat ground beef.  Very good flavor.  My husband and I ate the whole thing!

I thought this was yummy but I must add that I did use the recippe as a guide only. I used a tube of orig. Jimmy Dean sausage instead of hamburger and then topped it off with french fried onion rings (like for greenbean casserole). Then I put the mushroom sauce and then the tatertots. I topped it off with cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking and it was great! It wasn't dry and it wasn't bland at all. I'll definitely try this recipe again. It seems the variations are endless.

This is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I don't layer the dish though.  I cook the ground beef and onion, and when browned, mix in the cream of mushroom soup, milk, a can of drained corn, and the 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  I then put it in a 2qt casserole dish and top with the tater tots and another 1/2 cup of cheese and bake for about 55 minutes.  We've tried this with different types of cheese, but always go back to a mild cheddar.  Sharp cheddar is very good, but probably not the most kid-friendly taste and Co-jack seems to leave it with a slightly bitter taste.

I have made this one for years. It may not be gourmet but it is good! My family loves it! I layer a little differently: add some green beans, which barley cover the meat layer, cheese, tater tots and then the "sauce" overall. Minced garlic can also be added while browning the meat. This is always enjoyed, esspecially on cold winter nights!!

This was a great recipe!!!  It was so easy to make and even my 14 month old loved it!  I did add a little garlic just because we love it, and I followed the suggestion in previous reviews; I mixed the soup and milk into the ground beef instead of pouring it over - the tots were very crispy this way!

So easy, quick, and tasty! My husband just went back for thirds! 
I did a couple things differently after reading the reviews...
1. I browned the beef with the onion, 1/2 cup fresh mushrooms, and 1 tsp minced garlic. 
2. While it was browning, I lightly sprinkled it with onion powder, ceyenne pepper, onion powder, salt, and pepper. 
3. Once the meat was finished, I added the can of condensed mushroom soup, 1 cup of cheese, and 1/2 cup milk right into the skillet and mixed together. 
4. Put a can of green beans in the bottom of the dish and spooned the meat mixture onto the top.
5. I put the tater tots on top of the mixture and sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese on top. 
6. I sprinkled the top lightly with seasoned salt before serving.

YUMMMM!!!

I sauteed chopped  onion/celery/carrots in butter and olive oil,then added the soft veggies to the meat as it cooked. I also added Mrs Dash.  I couldn't stop eating it while making it! It smelled great, too. I burned my tongue on the hot meat mix! It was worth it. I forgot to add garlic,which I love.  I hate the debate over make recipe as is or change. I approach cooking and these recipes by what I have on hand, and timing. Never feel bad about customizing, and more power to you if you can make it exactly as written.

Very tasty. Husband loves it a lot. Something I do to make it a five star recipe...I bake the tater tots according to package first, so that they do not become soggy when cooking. Also, I substitute nonfat sour cream for the milk to make a richer, creamier flavor.

Good as is. Better when you mix in the soup and milk with the beef and onion. I also added half a bag of frozen mixed veggies and 3/4 cup of the cheese to the meat mixture. Layered that in a 13x9. Placed tots on top. Baked for 30 min. Took the casserole out, placed remaining cheese on top and added crumbled bacon. Baked another 10 min. Success!

I made this as the recipe stated, but my husband and I both found it quite bland.  Perhaps I will add more vegetables, or maybe some garlic....

I have been trying to find more frugal recipes and this one fit the "bill" so I figured I would try it.  I have never heard of tator tot casserole before and was a bit skeptical of it.  My husband decided before I even started cooking that he wouldn't eat it.  I said to him, "How bad can it be?"    Well, I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the meat while it was browning, and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I then mixed half the soup with the meat and then poured the rest over the tator tots.  I baked it for about 45 minutes since my cheese wasn't melting in the middle.  (I think I may have used more than I needed)  My husband decided to "try it" and I swore my boys would like it.  What's not to like?  It's basically a cheeseburger and tator tots all mixed together!  Not the prettiest looking dinner, btw.  Here's the verdict... My husband had three helpings, my 1-1/2 year old had 2 helpings, I had about 1-1/2 helpings, and my oldest son who is 4....well I don't think he liked the way it looked.  It took him a while to finish his dinner but he really is picky.  My husband and I were both shocked over how good this was.  We both agreed we will definitely be having this again.  Hopefully next time Mikey (my 4 yr old) will enjoy it a little more.  Thank you for sharing!!

I too placed the tater tots on top so they'd be nice and crispy.  I also used cream of chicken soup and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture.  I also added some garlic and worcestershire sauce to the beef to give it more flavor.  We ate it with ketchup; my kids said it tasted like cheeseburger and fries casserole.  Not gourmet, but a good weeknight family supper when served with a green salad.

Simple, tasty, easy to prepare.  I like to add some french cut green beans in between the layer of meat and tater tots.  Fed 4 people with second helpings.     N.B. Make sure you have thawed the "taters" before baking.

This is one of my favorite recipes from my childhood in a foster home. I got to help make this dish as written here and still remember it to this day. As simple and tasty as you want as a child. Enjoy.

My friend gave me this recipe about 10 years ago  and I made it often when my kids were little. Tastes great with ketchup on it. I use ground turkey now and the healthy request cream of mushroom. Leftovers taste even better the next day!

This was super easy and we really enjoyed it!  I added a can of Mexican style corn and layered it differently.  After draining the beef/onions I stirred in the soup, milk and corn.  Put that in the casserole dish topped with a layer of tator tots then topped with cheese last.  The tots stayed very crispy that way.  This had wonderful flavor and I will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe a few times, I give it a 4 star as written, but I made a few changes as others have suggested and it deserves 5 stars. I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and some seasoning to my meat mixture and topped the tator tots with some seasoning salt. YUM! Thanks

This was so amazing!  At the suggestion of others I did make some changes (that gave this otherwise 4 star recipe 5 stars).  I seasoned my meat with garlic powder, extra onion powder salt and pepper then I put the cream of mushroom on top of the meat, topped that with half the cheese, then put the tater tots on the top with extra cheese.  Came out WONDERFUL!  This will become a staple in my house!

Added a can of corn to the ground beef after it was cooked, otherwise stuck to the recipe. Kids loved it! Very easy, and all the ingredients are items we just happen to have on hand. Will make it again.

Very tasty and easy recipe. I had almost 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef to use up and I added some sour cream and beef base along with the milk and cream soup.  I added the cheese at the last 5 minutes of baking to not over brown it, this was a great dinner.  A bit on the salty side, but thats my fault.  I forgot that tater tots are already salted and I added extra from the beef base.  I will be making this for my family again and again.  Thanks

Great recipe! I was looking for a tater tot casserole recipe like my mother's, and this is pretty close! (Mom's will always be the best comfort food - sorry!) I used 2 cups of cheese and the whole bag of tater tots. It definitely needed the whole bag of tater tots! Will definitely make again!

Just had these for dinner and they are EXCELLENT and SUPER EASY!  Everyone kept on raving about how wonderful it was!  I lined the botton of the pan with frozen green beans and mixed the soup and milk with the meat mixture.  I also added finely minced garlic for added flavor.  Made AND ate these in less than an hour!  Tastes great with hot sauce!  This definitely doesn't make 6 servings, more like 4.  Will make again.  Thank you!

Only changes made were to mix ground beef/onion mixture and soup/milk mixture and then spread it on the bottom of the pan.  Then I sprinkled a little cheese, then did the layer of tater tots, and sprinkled a little more cheese. Tater tots came out crispy and yummy.  

I always make this in a 9x13 casserole rather than the square 2 qt casserole.  It still comes out great.  Kids love it too.

Next time I will try adding a layer of green beans on the bottom as others have suggested, just to get that veggie in!

I can not believe people give this slop a 5 star rating. I should have went with my gut feeling that my family would not like this. My 8 year old, 6 and 3 year said yuck when they tasted this. There are so many good recipes out there, it is a shame you people eat this processed garbage.

This is surprisingly delicious.  I followed some suggestions from other people and layered the meat, added beans, soup and then finally the tots.  I then cooked it for about 30 minutes and added the cheese and cooked for 10 minutes more.  With a nice side salad it was a great meal.   It goes without saying that garlic and other seasonings to your meat are also welcome additions.  Great recipe and thank you!

I tweaked a good starter recipe. I added 1/2 cup each of cream cheese and sour cream to the soup & milk portion.  Then, after draining and patting down the meat compote to reduce te grease content, I spiced the heck out of it!! Cracked pepper, garlic, onion powder, Tony C's, blackened seasonings...YEAH BABY !!!
   The spiciness of the meat contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the cream cheese.  This is awesome comfort food!!

Not something you'd serve company but great for a weeknight dinner, especially if you have kids.  It's almost Hamburger Helper-ish without all the preservatives. I'd make this again.

This was good, comforting, man-food--my husband loved it. I thought it was surprisingly tasty. I added half a red bell pepper and 8 oz of American cheese. I just mixed everything together, put the tots on the bottom of the baking pan, and poured the beef/soup/cheese mixture on top. An extra sprinkle of cheese and buttered bread crumbs made a nice crust. I served this with Buttery Cooked Carrots and Michelle's Famous Washed Cranberry Sauce, from this site.

I made a few changes.. but all the credit goes to the base of this recipe. It is flexible with so many things you can do to it.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, corn and colby cheese.  I mixed some tater tots in and put the rest on top.  No milk; extra soup and mixed everything together.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a simple recipe to make.  It was alot like what my mom used to make.  I made a little change, which my family loved.  Instead of mushroom soup, I used cream of chedder cheese soup and mixed it in with the meat.

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe and everyone loved it so much, we didn't have ANY leftovers! I did what some others said and put the potatoes on the top so they could be more crunchy. I also added broccoli, parmesan cheese, and bacon to it and it was amazing! My favorite casserole so far!

This is a great recipe, and gets better with additions. I mixed the soup into the meat like previously suggested, adding a can of cheese soup.  To make it a full meal I put frozen broccoli florets on the bottom of the pan.  I topped the broccoli & meat mixture with shredded cheese, tots, and more cheese. (Didnt mix the tots and soup so it'd be crunchy)  Yumm!

EASY & VERY GOOD!!!! I cooked the onion first then I added the hamburger. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, celery salt & garlic powder.Drained the meat. Mixed the soup and milk poured it over the hamburger and mixed that all together.Stired in a small can of corn Placed the meat mixture in a 2 qt bowl sprinkled with some cheese. Placed the tater tots on top sprinkled with more cheese.I know I will be making this again....this is a keeper. I thnk next time I will double the recipe & use a 13x9 pan so I can fit in more tater tots.

Yummy.  I think the secret is to bake the tater tots in the oven first/before you assemble the casserole (per the directions on the package) while you cook the onion and ground beef.  Mix the meat with the soup and milk (I added dried parsley and garlic powder at this point).  Layer the baked tater tots, the meat/soup mixture, and top with cheese.  Bake at 350 for about 25 minutes.

Like others I have also prepared this dish in the past but a different recipe. I made the following changes that many readers will find was identical to other subscribers, and some that were not.  When browning the ground beef with the onion, I also added finely chopped garlic, and some seasonings ( Emeril Lagasse Essance : you can find this recipe online and you will find that those herbs and spices that are in the essance are ones that you will used quite often in your own kiichen. They also sell this premade in stores, but I prefer to make my own because I feel I have more control over just how much sodium to add and it's cheaper to make a larger batch then one small jar ). I combined the soup and milk into a measuring cup with a few drops of hot sauce for added flavor, then added to the ground beef once browned. 1 can of whole kernal corn and shredded sharp cheddar cheese was stirred into the mixture, then placed into the baking dish. I topped evenly with the frozen tater tots and the rest of cheese then baked for over 45 min in a 375 degree oven .. served with side salad .. was delicious will make again

This recipe would have been a lot better had I realized I added 2x the tater tots before I baked it!  With too many tots it was too dry.  My fault, that's why I gave it 4 stars, because had I made it correctly it would have been fine.

Used cream of potato soup (instead of cream of mushroom) because that's what I had on hand and still turned out good.

This was very, very good! Delicious! I took the advice of others and did the dish in layers; added cheddar cheese soup; added green pepper and minced onion and garlic. This will definitely be a keeper in my dinner line-up.

This was very good. I followed another's suggestion with the layers - cook meat with onion with generous sprinklings of black pepper and seasoned salt (I added green pepper and minced garlic also), then add soup and milk to cooked mixture. Put that in bottom of casserole dish, top with 1/2 cheddar, top that with tater tots, sprinkle with seasoned salt, and then sprinkle remaining cheddar on top.

Made this for my husband, it was one of his childhood favorites. I havenever even heard of it before, so I really appreciate you putting it on here. It's great for one of those, "we have nothing to eat and I don't feel like going to the store" nights, but I just felt so unhealthy after eating it, it will be a while before I make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did as another reviewer suggested and mixed the cream of mushroom soup, along with a can of cheddar cheese soup, into the ground beef and layered cheese on top of that, then added the tots and more cheddar on top.  It was much better than I expected and I will be making this again.

This was very good! I used dried minced onion, about 3 T worth and sharp cheddar cheese on top. About 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp coarse grind pepper. Not anything fancy and you won't impress anyone with this, but this is sure tasty and a good hot meal without any fuss. We'll have this again. Thanks!

I gathered info from other reviewers and came up with a recipe that was great! The whole family loved it, here it is: 1-Brown meat with minced garlic and dried minced onion. 2-Layer bottom of dish with tater tots (spray w/pam 1st). 3-Mix meat with soup, milk and almost a whole GOLDEN lipton onion soup mix packet. 4-Pour meat mixture over tots. 5-Top w/cheese, cover w/foil and bake at 350 for 35mins. 6-Remove foil, turn up to 400 degrees and bake for about 7 more mins. It turned out wonderfully! I served it with rolls and a large garden salad to try to make up for the high fat and caloric intake from the casserole. Husband and kids were all very happy! Enjoy!

I made a few changes to this recipe, but only to make it more "Lickety Split".  Instead of chopped onion I used one pkg of Dry Onion Soup Mix (only use 1/2 package if using 1 lb beef). I added this after browning the beef in my Tupperware steamer in the Microwave.  I made sure the dry soup mix was well blended and the dry onions were moist. Omited the salt and pepper.   This was for 2 lbs of beef, since I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 for 60min.  I also used a cheese blend since that is what I buy from Costco the Cheddar, Monterey, Jack mix.  My father was over and raved about how good it was.  We had the left overs today for lunches.  It was seasoned well thanks to the onion soup mix.  I would recommend this change for those who like convienence.

I made this for the second time tonight, at my boyfriend's request. I did mine as Mare did... layer of green beans, meat/soup mixture, cheese, then tator tots. Baked for 30 minutes, topped with cheese, and broiled for 3-4 minutes to crisp the tots up. I added a clove of garlic and plenty of pepper to the meat when I was browning it. Very good. My boyfriend had 3 helpings :)

Easy & inexpensive to make but not very exciting. We used 1.5lbs ground turkey instead of beef but followed the recipe exactly besides that. Will make again but only on occasion.

Ive been making this for years and it always is a hit. Our modifications are to layer the beef mixture on the bottom, add a layer of canned green beans, drained, then the cheese and topped with the tatortots. It takes about 45 min in the oven and is done when the tator tots are browned and the mixture is bubbly. It helps the tator tots be more crisp and the cheese mixes good with the meat mixture. (I had to sneak in a veggie for my picky eaters.)

Very good family dish. I used my handy chopper to finely chop some carrots, and added them to the beef and onion mixture before cooking. Also, I followed the other reviewers advice and put the soup mix on before the tater tots. I added the cheese during the last ten minutes. Very good!

Super good Super easy! Everyone loved it. I put a can of drained green beans on the bottom. I then mixed my cooked hamburger & onion mixture with the soup & added garlic powder . Spread that over the beans. Put 1/2 the cheddar cheese over the soup mixture. Then layered on the tater tots. Added the remaining cheese (plus a little) to the top during the last 10 min or so of cooking.

This is great for a quick meal. I added green beans to the bottom of the pan, then added the meat mixture which I added the soup and milk to as suggested. I topped it off with thawed frozen hash browns and added the cheese the last 10 minutes of baking. I have a family of 6 and everyone enjoys this dish.

This was great!  I added about 1/2 cup of onions, 1 tbs of minced garlic, steak seasoning and instead of 1/2 cup of water I used milk.  It had GREAT flavor!!!  Also, I lined the dish with the tater tots and poured the mixture over the top not sure you could call it the same recipie but it worked for me!

My family has been eating this for years now. We love it, except I make mine a little bit different. I add taco seasoning to the meat and onions. I put the tator tots on the very bottom of a greased baking dish and sprinkle salt them. Then I mix the cream of mushroom soup with the taco meat and spread on top of the tator tots. (Except I don't add any milk or nothing to the soup. It takes away the flavor of the soup) Then I put sliced mushrooms on top of the meat mixture and cover with sharp cheddar cheese. Bake until tots are done about 30 mins. Very delicious!

Just as good as I remembered.  Bf said definetly make this again.  I suggest trying it with the soup on top of the tots because it runs down into them to make it so tasty, otherwise you may as well make the parts individually.  I used twice the cheese called for because we love cheese.  p.s. the top of the tots still gets nice and crunchy.

excellent!  I mixed the mushroom soup and milk to the meat instead of topping the tots.  Try adding some taco seasoning to the meat mix and tossing the tots in taco seasoning as well.  I did not have cheese so I brushed a little butter on tots so they were extra crispy.  Yumm

My family had 2 words for this....ewww yucky.  It was very bland. Even my 2 yr old who eats anything would not touch it after the first bite.  I did take some advice from the other reviews, but it did not help this recipe at all.  Definetly not a keeper.

This was so easy and full of flavor.  My other half wasn't sure about it when I said I was using tater tots - but - boy, did he sure change his mind.   He ate two helpings that night and took what was left for his lunch the next day.

AWESOME RECIPE.  I made this for a group last night and everyone raved (and took seconds).  I added a layer of corn over the meat and it was delicious.  Also threw in chopped green pepper, garlic and onion powder into the meat mixture. Nobody could believe that this recipe was made with tater tots.  My husband called this one a "real keeper".

The original recipe appeared on an Ore-Ida Tater Tot box over 40 years ago. It called for 1 lb. of ground beef and a can of  undiluted Cream of Celery soup topped with the tater tots. Brown the beef , place in a baking dish, spread  the soup on top and add the tater tots. Bake at 400 for 45 min. I've made it for years and only add some chopped onion to the beef, and changed the soup to Golden Mushroom for more flavor.  You can easily increase the amount of beef...still tastes delicious and it's EASY  .

This is a solid base recipe. There are a few things I do to make it my own. I sauté the beef and onions together along with red pepper flake, garlic (or garlic powder), salt and pepper. Then I add a few "glugs" of Worcestershire sauce. This makes a huge difference. I then add whatever veg I have that is on its way out- I've used kale, carrots, peas, zucchini- I also mix the soup and milk together and pour it into the pan with the beef mixture and stir before putting it into the pan. Since I like my potatoes crispy, I layer the cheese on top of the meat mixture, then lastly layer with tots. I'll usually sprinkle just a little bit of cheese on the very top because I love those crispy cheese pieces. Overall, great recipe- just don't be afraid to make it suit your tastes!

Very good easy go to recipe that everyone loves. My kiddos pig out on this. It's not healthy or gourmet but it's super easy and pure comfort food. I did the recipe as written. I double it and serve it with biscuits and a side vegetable to fill up hungry teenagers.

This was a great recipe for a night when you don't want to go to alot of bother! I really enjoyed it. A few changes I made was some extra seasoning in the beef, along with the onions I used salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. In the soup mixture I used a little bit less milk and replaced it with a nice dollop of sour cream which I think really added to the dish!! Also I put the cream mixture over the beef, then half the cheese, the taters, then the rest of the cheese.

This recipe is a big hit with my family. And great if you dont't have a lot of time for meal prep. Leftovers heat up very well too. I can send them with my daughter to school for lunch!  Will definitally be making this again soon!

I made this the other night. my boyfriend is a very picky eater and does not like a lot of foods I do. So I didn't tell him what all was in it (he hates mushrooms) and he loved it!!!

This was good with the following adjustments,  ground turkey instead of ground beef, 1/4tsp of thyme, celery seed seasoning, garlic powder, 2handfuls of mozzarella shredded cheese and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. Great dish will use this recipe often. Thanks:-)

I always rate the recipe on the way it is presented as opposed to my changes. That being said, this is one of both me and my wife's favorite comfort foods just the way it is. The only addendum I will make is that if the tots are frozen, either thaw them out or add 10 minutes to your bake time if they are not thawed. Other than that, love it!

So easy!  I made it because I had all the ingredients in the house.  I added a layer of frozen mixed vegetables and my family thought it tasted a lot like Shepherds Pie.  In fact my daughter said I should always make this instead.

I made the recipe as is, but added 1 tsp. minced garlic, 1 cup chopped celery and 1 cup chopped orange and yellow bell peppers with the onions.  We love casseroles and this one is on the top 10 list!

Just made this last night and I think I could use some help.  After reading some other reviews I went with two cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup mixed in with the meat and found it way to soggy to hold the tater tots.  What I came out with after 40 minutes in the oven was soggy, yet tasty slop.  Girlfriend thought the tater tots might have been uncooked as well.  Any suggestions?

This was a little bland as written. I added garlic to the meat and added some green beans in. I also put the cheese under the tots so they'd stay crispy. I still feel like this needed more kick. Next time I'd season the beef a lot more. I'll make this again with some additional modifications.

For some reason, all I could think about today was a Tater Tot casserole. Haven't made one in about 20 years!! Used this recipe plus the reviews as my base.  As many others did, I used the entire bag of Tater Tots. Also, to the ground beef mixture, instead of milk, I subbed sour cream. Gave it a great taste! Also added a can of creamed corn and 1/2 of the Tater Tots and mixed all of that really well. Poured that in the casserole dish then put about a cup of cheese and then the rest of the TT's. Baked about 35 minutes, and then added the rest of the chees for the last 5-8 minutes or so.  It was SO good.  When my husb walked in he asked what smelled so good and then kind of yelled and chuckled when he saw it! We both said it had been way too many years since we had this great dish!!

I made some adjustments with this - onion soup mix instead of just an onion, pkg. of frozen veggies, and cream of chicken (I don't like mushrooms). My kids don't care for it, but that doesn't bother me! Hubby and I love it. I think he would eat it every day if I made it that often.

Pure comfort food!  I did my arranging a bit differently like other suggested.  Put the soup/cheese/milk/ground beef mixture on the bottom (added corn) and then put the tots over that.  Baked for about 40 minutes, sprinkled more cheese over it and put it in for another couple minutes.  This way the tots stay nice and crispy!

I'm from MN and we love this dish.  I guess it is all about your family's preference.  We like to taste the mushroom soup, so I made it as is, however I did add a tablespoon of chopped garlic to the meat and onion.  Wonderful on a cold winters day like today (12 degrees F).  Thank you Chuck!

This is the first thing Ive tried from allrecipes that was high rated but not for me.  It could entirely be my fault though.  I believe I used to much ground beef and not enough cream of mushroom.  I also did what most the reviewers suggested by putting the tater tots on top instead of mixed in because my hubby likes it crunchy.  He loved it he said it was "comfort food" and I did like it the next day after it sat overnight in the fridge and was reheated.  Next time I am going to try it with the cheddar soup as a lot of other reviews I read.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh my goodness. This is FAB! I did make a few changes after reading many other reviews. I also added a can of cheese soup and doubled the milk. After seasoning the meat, I added in the 2 cans of soup and the milk to the skillet. I let the soup heat up and mix well into the meat. I then poured into the baking dish, topped with a little cheese, and then put an entire bag of the tater tots on top. After about 35 minutes, I broiled the tater tots to get them crunchy. I then added the rest of the cheese, put back in on bake for 10 minutes and DONE. Absolutely DELICIOUS!

I went with the other cooks suggestions. I used dried onion flakes and garlic powder to season the meat and mixed in the soup/milk to the meat so it doesn't taste dry. Placed the tater tots on top the meat. Cooked it for 15 minutes and then added the cheese on top and cooked it for another 15 minutes. It tasted good but it was lacking something, not sure what. But everyone liked it. I may try using Cheddar cheese soup vs. cream of mushroom next time to see if it gives it more flavor.

I doubled this recipe, used a 9x13 casserole and baked for about 55 minutes.  Very good!  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is for the fact that it is high in calories and sodium as written.  Several adjustments could be made to make healthier if you desire.  I wonder how ground turkey would taste in this?

This was something different that was enjoyed by all at our house. I tweaked it based on all the reviews. Added frozen mided veggies to the ground beef and onions, combined mushroom and cheddar cheese soup and added to beef & veggie mixture. Pressed into a 9X13 casserole dish, shredded cheese, added tater tots, seasoned, added more shredded cheese and threw it in the oven. A keeper recipe for sure!

We love this. My kids even ate it. Used almost a whole bag of tater tots and only mixed the soup with the meat-didn't pour over the tater tots because I imagined they would get soggy.

Did make a few changes. Skipped the milk and just mixed soup with onion/hamburger mix. Layered french cut green beans on bottom of casserole, hamburger mix, tots and cheese. Baked uncovered for 40 mins. Very good with changes.

This has been a family favorite for years.  The only change I make is to add in some frozen veggies, usually carrots, peas and corn.  This is a great throw together meal any night!

I made this as it was stated but it was missing something to me. I love tater tot casserole but haven't had it for years so maybe I was just thinking it was something it wasnt but it seemed very bland. I added some garlic powder after trying it but it still seemed lacking. Oh well.

This is such a fast and easy recipe that is delicious! For my very picky family this wins them over every time I make it. I didn't use a whole onion and added garlic. I would put a little bit of salt when cooking the beef and then season it after everything is done. I used a local season salt that added the perfect touch to it.

Rated it a 5 because there was nothing I could say negative about this recipe. I did use ground turkey and sweet onions. So delicious! It was even a big hit with my picky eaters. Think I will make it with mixed veggies next time to make it a little healthier.

I love this recipe with the following modifications:

After browning the ground beef and onion, add a packet of onion soup mix to the beef and onions.

I'm not fond of the layered approach, so I mix an entire package of tater tots with the beef and onions, a can of mixed vegetables, and a can each of condensed cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup (no added milk or water.)

Pour this mixture into a large casserole dish and top with shredded sharp Cheddar cheese and Durkee French-fried Onions.

Also tastes great with ground turkey or chicken!

Doubled the recipe for a large group.  Very high fat.  wish it had a little more seasoning without having to add more salt since it already had a ton of sodium.  Overall- most people liked it, especially the guys.

This is definitely a family favorite at our house!!  Additionally, when I took a job working in a college cafeteria, I suggested that we try the recipe, and I was amazed that we absolutely were not able to keep up with the line of college students that wanted it.  If you're campers out there, like our family, we've also made this in a dutch oven over the camp fire and it was just as delicious.

I used cream of celery soup, corn, onions and tater tots made with onions. This was delish! It tastes like a de-constructed shepherd's pie with a little bit of crunch thrown in!

Yummy, was a hit with the family.  I did what others suggested using a can of cheddar cheese soup along with the mushroom soup, adding a whole soup can of milk and added garlic & onion powder & dried no salt herb mixture and parsley flakes to soup mix (to give it a little more flavor).  I covered the casserole with foil for 30 minutes an uncovered it and cooked it for 20-25 minutes more (the center was still cold after only 30 minutes).  Will make again :)

This is nearly the same as my sisters recipe, however after browning the meat and onions with 4oz of cream cheese, grab your glass baking dish and layer un cooked tots first then a layer of meat mixture, sprinkle some cheese-repeat same until filled to top-cover cook until tots are golden brown!

like others, i made a few changes to this recipe. i browned my ground beef with the onion, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. then i mixed the milk and a whole can of cream of mushroom soup with the meat.  i put this mixture in the bottom of my casserole dish. i used a whole bag and baked my tater tots fully before putting them on top of the meat mixture. then i put about two cups of shredded cheddar cheese on top of that, and sprinkled pepper, onion and garlic powder on top of that. this casserole is a crowd pleaser for sure.

I've been making this casserole for years & had to tweak it because it was too bland.   I season my ground beef with Lipton dry onion soup mix, along with garlic powder & freshly ground black pepper.  After the meat is browned & drained, I omit salt, then add the dry onion soup mix, garlic, & pepper into it & mix well while meat is still hot. The seasonings really stand out if seasoned after the meat is cooked.   To this I also add a small can of white corn,a small can of mushrooms drained, then I add the soups.   I use 1 can of roasted garlic mushroom, & 1 can of cream of broccoli, to almost 1 can of milk.  I sprinkle this with sharp cheddar & monterey jack cheeses, top with tater tots, & sprinkle tots with a little more garlic powder & pepper, & a dash paprika for color. It doesnt last more than 1 day in my house. lol!

I followed the recipe except I did use the Lipton onion soup mix. It was good but not at all bubbly or soupy like I thought it would be.I will make it again,but next time I might add more milk.

I make this all the time, and it is delicious! I always add corn to the beef. I defrost it in the microwave first, or even better bring it up to heat in a skillet with a little butter and seasoning salt, yum! I mix the corn and the cooked beef together with the cream of mushroom mixture. Put this in the bottom of a 9x13, and top this with the tater tots. This way, the tater tots stay crispy.

This was worth trying. I too mixed the milk,soup and beef together with an addition to a handful of cheese. Put some peas on the bottem and the rest of the cheese the last 10 mins. I also put some bacon bits on half of this and it went real well together. I ended up putting it on all of it. This is one of those recipes that you can play with and is even better the next day.

Quick, easy and kid friendly. Used ground buffalo, lowfat low sodium soup and used an ovenproof skillet.  Once the meat was browned, I added the rest of the ingredients and popped the pan in the oven.  Next time I will add some veggies.  Thanks!

I wanted to use our tater tots in a casserole rather than just plain.  This was still pretty plain.  There's got to be some other way of jazzing a tater tot casserole up.

Easy and liked by all 6 who ate it!
I used 2 lbs of meat, 2 cans of soup, one chopped spanish onion, 1 cup of milk, the whole 32 ounce bag of tater tots, and 3 cups shredded cheese. It fit just right in a 13x9 pan. I mixed 1/2 of the soup mixture with the meat and poured the other 1/2 over the tater tots and topped it with the cheese. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This recipe, minus the onions has been a family favorite for years!  We call it Grandma's Casserole since we tasted it for the first time when my Grandma Dolly made it.  Here is a tip though... once you have the soup and milk mixed, mix a 1/2 cup of soup with the ground beef.  It works almost like a glue so that when you serve it you're not leaving some of the meat in the baking dish.  Ok, now I think I might have to make this for dinner!  LOL

My boyfriend and I were pretty disappointed with this recipe, especially after reading all of the reviews. It was bland and we thought the tater tots were a weird texture.

GREAT RECIPE!!! The whole family enjoyed this one!!!  I used cream of chicken instead of the cram of mush. I think next time I am going to subsitute half of the cream of chicken with sour cream. I also slpit my cream of chicken and milk mixture and put half over the beef mixtire, added cheese then tots and the remaining mixture and cheese. Turned out GREAT!!!!

Wasn't crazy about this recipe.  It was easy, cheap, and tasted okay but I wouldn't make again.  It was fairly bland and definitely missing something.

I have never had a Tater Tot Casserole, and then I tried this one. I took a friends advised to use Cream of Celery instead of Mushroom. I combined the soup and milk and poured it over the meat mixture in casserole dish. I then added french cut greens beans and topped it w/ tater tots. I allowed it to cook and the last 15 minutes, I added cheese! It was so yummy!

Easy, tasty recipe.  I followed some others' advice and mixed the soup with the meat mixture, and I cooked it for a little while longer.  I also added one package of the beef OXO powder for extra flavor.  I thawed the tater tots and then put them on top of the meat, adding the cheese for the last five minutes of baking.  Family enjoyed it; reminded me a little of Shepherd's Pie.

Use your common sense here. This is a pretty straightforward recipe. If you like tater tots, ground beef, onions, cheese and mushroom soup you'll love this recipe, if you don't, give it a miss. My husband and I, both raised on the casseroles and convenience foods of the 60's and 70's, scarfed it down -- hot, cheesy, oniony, beefy with the vaguely weird frozen potato taste mixed in for nostalgia.  My own pre-teen children, raised on things like pesto, fresh mushrooms and homemade balsamic vinegar dressing (as opposed to the flourescent "French" of my youth) were completely unimpressed.

Either I was really hungry or this recipe was awesome, either way I ate half of the dish! (and I'm not a big woman).  My boyfriend loved it, too, and encouraged me to make it again. My 4 year old only ate the tater tots and cheese but no meat. I also like my tater tots crispy so I put them on the very top and added more cheddar at the end.

A family favorite! I added a little bit of garlic powder to the ground beef along with salt and pepper. I also added a big spoonful of sour cream to the mixture just because that's the way my mother used to make it. I also put ground beef in my casserole dish first, then added the mixture over the ground beef. I topped it off with the tater tots and cheese on top just to give it a crispy topping! Quick and easy casserole that everyone enjoys and it was one of my childhood favorites!

I enjoyed this. 

Tablespoon sour cream to soup mixture, season meat well, fresh onion and garlic to meat, line bottom with can of corn drained. Layer corn, meat, cheese, soup mixture, tator tots, more cheese. Cook 40 minutes. Broil briefly.

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years, with minor differences.  First I use chopped celery and onion and sauté them together.  Second I put the tator tots in first and third I have found that I like cream of chicken the best although mushroom and celery soup are both good.  This is a family favorite.

I tried it how it was written and was good.  But for years I have made mine with 2 cans french cut green beans, 2 small cans of mushrooms, 2 cans condensed cream of mushroom soup, some milk to loosen it up,  2 lbs hamburger, mixed all together and seasoned with salt/pepper and sometimes garlic powder, tater tots on top and some extra tots shoved down into the mixture.  I have never done cheese before but it was a different taste, might keep that into the way I make it.  But the chopped up onions that part I will keep in the way I usually make it.  Oh and sometimes I use one can of whole kernel corn and one can of french cut beans. I totally agree that this is a basic recipe and that you can go many ways with it.  It is a meal that if you have hamburger and tots you can add almost any veggie and condensed soup and make a great easy meal for a family.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the order in which I layered it prior to baking it.  I prefer the tater tots crispy, so I followed the recommendation of another reviewer.  I poured the soup over the beef mixture, sprinkled with half of the cheese, then the tater tots, and finally the rest of the cheese.  It was wonderful!  I would definitely make it again!  It was flavourful and simple to make.

I love this recipe! The only thing I change when I cook this is I mix the beef and soup mixture, place that on the bottom of the pan, layer the cheese on, then add tater tots in an orderly grid pattern. After I start to see the soup bubble up around the tots (about 30 minutes), I turn the broiler on to give the tots a good crunch. I crave this ALL the time!! 

P.s. make sure to season the beef while cooking (I use seasoned salt, garlic powder, and pepper)

I add a bit of salt and pepper to the top then bake...;)

I have been making this for years. I brown 2 lbs of ground beef in a cast iron skillet and drain. Then in the same skillet I add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, a can of spicy rotell tomatoes, salt and pepper to taste. Then I like to add shredded cheese to the top, then I add the tater tots on top.I put it in the oven at 350 and cook for 45 minutes till the tater tots are brown.

We LOVED this casserole. I followed earlier suggestion of adding sausage for more flavor. I did half sausage. Also thought I'd enjoy tatertots more crispy as well and did suggestion of soup mix over meat, then cheddar cheese over that and some sprinkled on top of tots. Tatertots were perfection. I topped with salt, pepper and a very light layer of chili powder. I will be making this again and again. My kids will love it when they come home next.

This recipe was fantastic, but I decided to change it up a bit. I added half an onion instead of a whole and added about a 1 and a half cups of French's fried onions as well to give the recipe a bit of a crisp. Also, instead of adding the soup on top of of the tater tots, I added it to the beef on the bottom to keep the top cheesy and cripsy-- it turned out great. To give it a bit more flavour, I also added some chili powder and garlic to the beef.

This was very good. Even my son who doesn't like hamburger ate it. I poured the soup mixture over the burger (added a 1/3 of a bag of primavera frozen vegis to it I had) put tater tots on top and covered with cheese. Also added real bacon sprinkled across the top. The bacon made it extra yummy! Cooked a little longer to get the tots crispy. Will be making again! Also going to take basics and make a breakfast casserole!!

This was fast, easy, and cheap! My kids loved it and said it reminded them of one of one of those helper boxed meals. We will make this again.

Stuck to the original recipe except for adding extra cheese on top, baked it to 45-50 minutes and also used Seasoned salt along with the pepper. My husband who is an extremely picky eater absolutely loves this and my 10 month old daughter ate through her piece so fast she kept squawking at me for more. Easy to make, not bland at all.

Real good comfort food.  Prepared as written except for the addition of two cloves of garlic browned with onion and beef.   Will make again.

I made this without the onion or salt and subbed cream of celery instead of mushroom because I don't like mushrooms. This was awesome!  I'm definitely making this again and again and sharing with my loved ones.  

Something I just thought about trying is to make it for breakfast using sausage instead of hamburger and gravy instead of cream of mushroom/celery and serving with eggs.

My guys really love this and it couldn't be easier. I do use more soup and tots than called for though. I also add garlic powder and tony's to the meat mixture and a little Worcestershire to the soup to punch up the flavor.

Made it more like a cottage (shepherds pie) and one of my friends said they liked it better because of the crunch of the tots vs. mashed potatoes!!
Here's my modifications:
- Put soup in meat after I cooked it (per reciepe with onions)
- Added seasoning/spices (thyme, sage, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce) to meat
- Added cheese on top of meat then put green beans and corn
- Covered with tots then sprinkled just a little cheese on top

Made this with a few tweaks. Seasoned beef with onion, garlic, paprika, A1 (used 2lbs of beef).  Layered it as follows: beef, soup mix, 1 layer munster cheese, tater tots, cheddar cheese on top. We like the top crunchy.  My whole family loved it! Even my picky eater loved it!

This is my absolute go to recipe when I have teenagers around.  I added a layer of shredded chedder in between the burger and the tots.  I have also added bacon bits to the cheese layers for a change.  So easy and you can prepare in advance so no fuss when the house is bustling with activity!

This is a favorite of my kids, 15 & 13. I like to add a layer of frozen green beans or mixed veggies, or even thinly sliced zucchini & yellow squash for some vitamins. I also prefer to make AR's "Cream Soup Base" instead of using canned, chemical-laden products. Thanks for the recipe; I make this as one of my freezer meals, so it just needs to thaw and bake.

I highly encourage those who have never tried tater tot casserole, and are trying to appease a picky palate at home, to modify this recipe according to the most helpful review on here. My children loved this version; the tater tots were crispy with a comforting and delicious meat mixture using the greek seasoning.

We liked this.  I added 1/2 a pkg of dried onion soup mix to the meat.  I did as others suggested and mixed the meat, soup, milk, onion soup mix and onion together and layered on the bottom of a 9 x 13" casserole dish.  I put half the shredded cheese on top.  Neatly layered the tater tots on top and baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  I added the rest of the shredded cheese on top of the tater tots and baked an additional 10 minutes.  I skipped adding any additional salt, as the dish was salty enough.

I combined this recipe with another recipe in one of the church cookbook that I have. Basically, the only change to this recipe of the two was that I stirred in a bag of frozen, mixed vegetables with the meat and soup. I also eliminated the cheddar cheese over the top of the tots. This was just like Mom and Grandma used to make and my husband and son also loved it! What a great comfort food for a chilly, fall day!

Delicious with a few changes....used 2 lbs of extra lean ground chicken, added garlic, 2 cans of cream o soup, added some sour cream, a can of corn drained, and I also added some shredded yellow squash that I had frozen from the summer as an added extra veg. Family inhaled this. Made in advance, refrigerated and baked later in the day. Thanks!

We didn't have some of the ingredients (including the tator tots!) but we wanted to give it a go anyway.  We started by baking a bag of waffles fries at 450 for 20 minutes.  Then we browned the beef with onion, garlic, salt and pepper.  We prepared a blend of: 1 can cream of mushroom soup, about a cup of medium heat queso cheese sauce and about 1/4 cup milk.  We added that to the ground beef, as well as a can of mexi-corn.  We put the meat mix in a 9x13 pan and topped with lightly salted, baked, waffle fries.  We baked it for 5 minutes (it was already hot), topped the fries with a bunch of shredded cheddar and baked for another 5 minutes.  It turned out really good.  I think the queso sauce adds the just the right amount of kick!  Sorry for butchering your original recipe, Charlie, but we appreciate the great idea.  The kids especially loved it!

Can't really eat this if you're on a diet, but it's a great go-to recipe for feeding kids! How can you go wrong with ground beef, tater tots and cheese? And, it's ready in a snap. A guest made this for us once, and I thought I'd give it a try, too. I see a number of ways to spiff it up, but it has a great base.

This is delicious, warm, and filling. A must have for a cold day. My family loves it, even the picky eaters. I often mix in a package of frozen veggies.

This was not very good.  It wasn't unedible but not very appetizing at the same time.  I seasoned the heck out if it (and the meat) and it was still bland.  Overall concept was good but end product not so much.

Made it with a can of corn, a chopped yellow sweet pepper, a cup of peas and a small can of mushrooms (drained both the corn and mushrooms).  Also added a can of condensed tomato soup to the meat mixture so it wouldn't be dry.  Success!

I was amazed at how good this is! I've made other tater tot casseroles that have not been well-received by my family. This one got a thumbs-up from everyone! The only thing I did differently was add a splash of soy sauce for "umami." This one's a keeper!

changes I made to make this according to my taste/texture preferences: I added a lot of minced garlic to the meat mixture as it was cooking, as well as a few dashes of oregano and dried minced onion. Next time I will add a can of french style green beans to the meat mixture, I think that would be good. I just mixed the milk and soup in with the meat mixture and put it in the bottom of the pan, put a layer of cheese, then the tots. (I found using the circular taters to be more pleasing) and then another final layer of cheese. It was done in 40 minutes.

This was good comfort food.  Mixed everything together and put a whole bag of tat or tot on top - they got nice and crispy that way.  Served with a fresh salad or green beans and this is a fast weeknight dinner.

I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and taco seasoning while the meat was browning. I also layered it different. Meat, soup mix, cheese, tater tots and more cheese. This way the tater tots were crispy.

This is a great recipe my whole family loves. However, to make it even better & healthier, add about 1 1/2 c unthawed frozen broccoli over the meat & cream of mushroom soup mixture. Adds healthy factor & tastes great!!!

I normally make tater tot casserole in the crock pot but i didn't have the time so I went looking for a faster recipe and found this. I just made it tonight and the whole family loved it - from my 3 year old to my husband! It was easy to make and delicious. Next time I may use more beef to make it a little heartier, but otherwise it was great!

This is a quick meal for a busy familly and it is awesome. I have found over the course of making it upteen times, that I have added garlic powder, salt and pepper. Kroger has a something called tater rounds (like Burger Kings morning tator tot) and those work better for our family. LOVE IT!!

Loved this recipe. I browned turkey sausage and added the soup and milk right into it. Next in the dish I then added my tater tots on top of that. Next on went the cheese. I bake it for the full 40 minutes and it was just perfect. Even my picky husband liked it. I will make this again.

This dish was recommended to me by a friend, so I looked it up.  I made it very similarly to the recipe above except that I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I layered it on the bottom and sprinkled the seasonings then covered it with the cream of mushroom and milk mixture.  I put a very thin layer of cheese over that and then a layer of the frozen tator tots and completely covered with the rest of the cheese.  I baked it for about 35 minutes uncovered.  Then I covered it with tin foil and carried it to a potluck.  I didn't get a chance to taste it because everyone else gobbled it up so quickly, so I am giving it five stars based on their rave reviews.  The next time I make it I am going to use ground beef, and hopefully this time I will get at least a bite.

I really loved how quick and easy this dish was to prepare! I browned the ground beef with the onion first, and then I added the cream of mushroom soup and milk directly into the meat mixture rather than pouring it on top of the tater tots. That way, the tots stayed crispy and didn't get mushy on me. I also added 1 cup of frozen corn to the meat mixture. It turned out great and I definitely plan on making it again.

Wonderful when made per directions!  Most of my family mixed their green beans into it so I might add green beans to the recipe the next time I make it.

I thought it was good but not fantastic. I took other peoples suggestions and added Lipton onion soup & I think that was a little too much for me. I made it again but this time used cheddar cheese soup instead of  cream of  mushroom. I liked it better.

My secret for adding flavor to this is, a Pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the can soup.  It really makes a difference in the taste, not so dull.  Also, I use 2 cans of soup so it's not dry.

This is a recipe my family has been using for about 5 years or so. One thing I like to do is add some veggies. When I'm putting it together, I put the meat on the bottom of the casserole dish, then cream of mushroom soup, then I use a small bag of Freshlike mixed veggies, the on with carrots, beans, peas and corn. Then I add a layer of shredded cheese and then put the tater tots in a row. Its a great way to get some veggie in your diet.

Yummy, Easy, Fast, Versatile...what more do you need to earn 5 stars.  My 4 kids love this! Don't forget to add your favorite seasonings to the meat.  I use cream of chicken with great results.

Wow, for something so simply and easy to make, this was amazing! Like some other reviews suggested, I added the soup mix and the cheese over the ground beef and then placed the tots on top. It came out great and my husband loved it! I will be making this again. Thank you!

I first made this recipe when it was made on Fox * News (Cleveland), by News Anchor Traci McCool's mom.   I loved it then, and I love it now! I am actually making it tonight for dinner. I use hashbrowns in lieu of the tater tots; it makes easier layering in my opinion. In lieu of beef, I use turkey.  Another thing I do to help with the flavor of the meat is...(and this is very important to me)...season your meat AFTER it's done cooking and you have drained it unless you plan on dumping the entire skillet of meat (grease and all) into your dish.. If you season meat during the cooking process you pour off the seasoning when you drain the grease.  I serve this with texas garlic toast. Hey, if you're gonna splurge on this calorie infested dish, you might as well make it worth it!   This is not a dish that I make often. I have made it twice since 2007, when it first aired.  I hope that my review has helped you decide whether-or-not to make it, eat it, or steer clear of it.  God Bless.

I fixed this last night, it was wonderful.  The only thing I did different was I added a pack of Lipton onion soup mix to the meat.  Also I layered it meat, soup and milk mix, cheese, tots, and then more cheese.  This made the tots crunchy.  Again this was wonderful even my 3 year old enjoyed it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I make this backwards than what the recipe reads or opposite of a shepherd's pie.  I bake the tots while I am browning the beef so they end up on the bottom of the pan.  I usually add Cavender's seasoning to the beef.  After the burger is cooked and no longer pink, add the soup directly to the meat and pour over tots and top with cheese.  Then, just pop it back in the oven.  Jalapenos are a nice addition for some heat and extra flavor.

I thought it was fantastic. For some odd reason, however, my husband did not. Maybe because I tossed in half a cup of frozen mixed veggies with the beef. Oh well. Definitely reccommend it, though.

WOW!  This was an excellent last minute throw together meal!  I used an onion from the garden and the lipton onion soup mix and it turned out GREAT!  I also served green beans and corn on the side.  I agree with the others this is a kid and husband friendly meal. I will definitely make this again and again!

Good comfort food & so easy to whip up.  I used cream of chicken soup, because that's what I had on hand.  Browned ground beef with onion, then added soup & milk to the skillet to combine.  Threw in a couple handfuls of frozen corn and spread that in the baking dish and topped with the tots.  Baked 40 minutes, then sprinkled cheese on top of tots and broiled for a minute or so.  Goooood!

I made this a couple of times.  It came out best - totally awsome - with cheddar cheese soup instead of the cream soup.  I layered it just like the directions said.  No left-overs left.

I followed the recipe the first time I made it, but it was a little too bland. Second time around I mixed Lawry's meatfloaf seasoning and 1/2 cup of water in with the beef and onions, (omitted salt & pepper), and used colby/montery jack and cheddar cheese. Delicious! Uber comfort food - my roommate has the eating habits of a 5 yr old and even he liked it :)

I used Velveeta instead of reg cheddar since that's how my grandma made it way back! I subbed 1 tsp onion powder for onion, 1 tsp garlic powder, added one can drained french cut green beans, and used a bag of veggie crumbles instead of meat. Yummy! Not a vegetarian, but in casseroles, it can't be beat! I highly recommend this recipe, it's a big time comfort food. Oh yeah, and the tater tots went on the very top.

We love this recipe! I don't used canned creamed soups, so I just make my own white sauce with a couple tbsp. of butter and flour, and 1 cup of milk (or 1/2 c. milk + 1/2 c. chicken broth). The husband loves this one!

Excellent!  I sauteed the onion with mushrooms then browned the ground beef with them.  I mixed cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups and two cans of French cut green beans, omitting the milk and topping that with the cheese.  I oven-baked double the amount of tater tots until they were crispy and then put them on top of everything because I like them extra crispy, not soggy.

My boyfriend isn't very fond of cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken soup instead. It still came out good and was a quick and easy fix for dinner!

This has always been my favorite.  When I make it, I too think that it's bland.  The last time I added one can of chopped green chilies. WOW what a added flavor and not to much.

i used cream of chicken soup and put a little corn in it.  I put the soup and cheese mixture in the middle as well.  It was all gone by the end of dinner everyone liked it.

My kids ate this without stopping!  My son kept telling me how good it was.  Everyone gave this recipe a thumbs up.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken and golden mushroom mixed.  It was great!

This dish may have taken me off of the "worlds worst cooks" list.  My 11 yr old daughter refused it because of the onions, but my husband raved about how good it was and finished off the entire dish.  It was so easy and full of flavor.  I will definately add it to my "approved" list of regulars.

Not bad at all.  Easy recipe (as they all basically are) and very good. I can't always serve my husband the gourmet meal, so this was a nice change :) I did everything as-is and it turned out wonderful! Only thing I will do next time is bake for one hour as the tots were still a little chilly...

Great recipe, and easily made vegetarian! I used Boca soy crumbles in place of the beef, and lower fat mushroom soup. I also followed some others' suggestions and combined the soup, "beef" and onions in the skillet and made them the base layer.  And my meat-loving boyfriend absolutely loves it!

This was good.  It was similar to a Hamburger Helper meal.  I added some Worchestershire sauce, garlic powder and seasoned salt to the meat for more flavor.  Husband loved the leftovers, so that was a plus.

I had never heard of Tater Tot Casserole until my boyfriend requested it for his birthday dinner.  So I looked it up online and found this recipe.  It turned out great but I made some adjustments to make it a little healthier and added some more flavors.  I used lean ground beef and sauted the beef with a sm sweet onion and 2 to 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic; i added a few shakes of worchester sauce, and chopped up a few jalopeno slices to add a little kick.  Then added a whole back of frozen mixed vegetables that included corn, beans, peas and carrots.  I used 98% FF Healthy request campbells cream of mushroom soup and only added about 1/4 cup milk.  Salt and pepper to taste and a pinch of cayenne. I put in meat mixture then a lite sprinkling of 2% sharp cheddar and then layered the tater tots on top.  I baked it for 30-40 minutes then broiled it on hi for 8-10 to make the tots crispy.  I got rave reviews and surprised myself with how good it was.

As another Norwegian from MN I agree that this recipe is a great starting point. I browned the ground beef and added a package of dry onion soup mix for seasoning, some frozen mixed vegetables, cream of mushroom soup and milk, and mixed it all together. I layered the tots on top, and poured a mixture of cream of chicken soup and milk over those, and topped with cheese. When I make it again I'll use the whole bag of tater tots rather than half. My 7 year-old son devoured it!

I made this the other night for my husband and soon to be 5 yr old boy, and it was wonderful.  I did add about
1 teaspoon and some worchestershire sauce to the ground beef as it was cooking, and when mixing the soup and milk, I added 1/2 cup sour cream and used cheddar and montery jack shredded cheeses, and baked until the tiny tator tots were crispy.  It turned out sooo good, everyone enjoyed it, my son and husband like it with ketchup on top (as typical with men)!!!  Will make this again.  Thanks!!

Love it.  Added Garlic and worchester sauce and put more Tots on top to get crunchy.  Added 5 minutes @ 450 to crisp tots.  Tastes like Cheeseburger and fries casserole. kids loved it.

I really liked this one.  I added worcestershire and minced garlic to the meat and added a small can of sliced mushrooms to the soup.  Like others, I put meat on the bottom, followed by the soup, cheese and tater tots on top.  They turned out nice and crispy.  Served with green beans and biscuits.

Mmm. Inexpensive and easy comfort food that you can easily adjust with different cheeses and veggies to a variety of tastes. I did sub cream of potato for the mushroom because we don't like mushrooms, and baked in a 13X9 pan instead of the casserole. I also mixed the soup into the meat and sprinkled cheese over that before the tots, which yielded a creamy meat layer below the crispy potatoes (which we doubled to cover the larger surface). Thanks for sharing.

I changed the ingredients but it was very good.  I used chicken tenders that I diced and lightly breaded and then pan fried first and added some canned diced green chiles. I mixed together a can of nacho cheese soup and chicken verde soup instead of the mushroom. I think I omitted the milk.  I mixed the chicken in with the soup mixture and put half under the tater tots and half on top.  It was good and I will make it again. I think it was actually even better reheated. I plan on making the recipe version this week. SO this recipe gave me two new dinners for my family.****Now I have made it according to the recipe and I make it quite often.  My family really likes it and I think I like it even better, reheated the next day.  I use about 2 cans of soup though. I also add a little garlic, S&P to the soup mixture and salt the tatertots. I know that is a lot of salt. :(  I also add a little corn from time to time.

This was excellent; much better than we thought it would be.  Even my picky 3-year old gobbled it down.  I substituted Cr. of Potato for Cr. of Mushroom and added fresh green beans (slightly cooked) and a little soy sauce.  I put the cheese under the tater tots so the tots would be crispy.  Quick and easy too.  What more can you ask for when you have a busy family life.

I was not a huge fan but my son & husband really enjoyed it. I did as was suggested...poured the soup mix over the ground beef with half of the cheese and then put the tots on top...I added the other half of the cheese about 10 minutes before it was finished. I will probaby make this again but I wil probably have toast that night!

I was pretty skeptical about how this recipe would turn out. I added greenbeans with the soup mix and poured over meat mixture and my family was very pleased with the outcome. My husband said he would like to have it again.

This was delicious but I could only give it four stars because I had to make several changes.  First, I browned the beef first then added about 1/4 packet of taco seasoning, a can of diced tomatoes,added this to the baking dish,and poured the soup mixture over the beef instead of over the tater tots.  Meanwhile, I partially cooked the tater tots in the oven before adding them to the casserole.  I also baked this covered then added the cheese at the last few minutes and continued to bake uncovered until the cheese melted.  With a little extra work this came out very good and the tots were nice and crispy.

I added a can of corn, extra can of the mushroom soup, and used 1/2lb of ground beef, and 1/2 pound italian sausage. Was very good. Freezes well too.

Kids didn't care for this one.  Hubbie did though! Lots of meat, not much sauce. Needs grean beans or something else.  Pretty plain.

I gave this four stars because I think overall that's as good as tater tot casserole can be.  I've tried many recipes over the years, but this one was the best so far.  My kids enjoyed it and that's the true test.  Very picky eaters.  I made it exactly as written except I substituted french fries for the tater tots just because that's what I had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll make this again.

I love this recipe. I first tried this dish in my college cafeteria.  I have made it twice for my family and it almost always has no leftovers.  I have an impulse to eat this whenever it is served in the cafeteria.

Ok, I gave this a 3 because my family liked it, I didn't.  I followed the advice of others and mixed the meat with the soup mixture and added some corn to that.  Put the tater tots on top and didn't put the cheese on til the last few minutes.  To me it just had a weird taste.  I don't know what it was exactly.  I'll probably make this again since my family liked it, but I will have to play around with it a bit and see if I can muster more than 3 stars out of it in my book.

Tater Tot hot dish is my favorite food ever, I prefer mine with corn and a bit of Tobasco sauce. I also eat mine with ketchup. It is the best with a lot of corn and I always use two cans of cream of mushroom soup, that way it doesn't get too dry. Also, I usually don't put cheese on the top, the last time I did it got really dry and hard, so I would recommend putting the cheese on a couple of minutes before the baking is done. I also mix the beef, soup and corn all together and then top with tater tots.

This quickly became my 6 year old's favorite dish.  I added a can of green beans and I must say, it's pretty darn good.  I would recommend this dish to those who have a growing family.

This is an excellent meal for homes with children. I make this on days when the kids have to be at sports in the evening. Its in the oven and done early and the kids always clean their plates. Its a bit greasy, & my husband and I add hot sauce for our tastes, but add a nice salad of baby greens and all is well :) Great recipe :)

I thought this was good, quick and easy to prepare. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and baked the tator tots, according to the pkg directions, before adding them to the casserole.. I didn't make any other changes. The mushroom soup seems to soften the inside layer of the casserole - the cheese, soup, meat and tator tots fused together and created a nice soft consistency (but not gooey) and flavor, while the tots on top stayed nice and crispy.

I made two of these casseroles for a man I work with who has 6 kids, and his wife was in the hospital for emergency surgery.  I figured he could use all the help he could get!  I made one exactly as written, and one I added green beans.  Turns out, my friend told me his kids preferred the one with the green beans.  Go figure!!  A very kid-friendly recipe!

I combined the soup mixture with the ground beef instead of putting it over the tater tots. It helps keep the tots crispy.:) And I put the cheese on top 10 minutes before it was done, just enough time to melt. You need to cook it 40 minutes. I took mine out after 30 and the tots weren't as hot as I'd have liked. Very good for something different.
4-1-05 Just made this again, and this time I poured the soup over the tots like the recipe suggests. I like it better with crispier tots, so next time I will do like last time and take everyone's advice! Oh, I did add a can of green beans. That added a lot to the dish. Pretty good!

This was a quick and easy recipe, and tasted great! I took some prior advice and mixed the browned meat, soup, and milk together then lined the tater tots on top and topped that with the cheese. It turned out wonderful! My son asked to take the left over in his lunch the next day.

I made this last night for my son and husband. My husband and I thought it was good, but nothing too exciting. My son did not like it at all. 

I found the dish to be very bland, sort of plain. I do not think I would make this again, as we like more spicier, tangier, and tastier dishes. 

Also, I do not think the high fat content is worth it for the bland taste in exchange.

Overall I would rate this dish a C.

Good and easy to make. I made it a little different like some other people suggested. I mixed the soup and milk into the cooked hamburger and onion mixture, then I put the tater tots on top and sprinkled the tater tots with cheese. Very good!

First off: anyone interested in this recipe, do give it a shot regardless of my comments.  My boyfriend and I found this inedible!  I could not even finish the serving I spooned out for myself; and he (always a 3-4 serving guy) ate his serving and the rest went out.  In all fairness to Charlie, I think the problem may have been the tater tots themselves.  I bought them the same day I made the recipe but they may have been the 'funky' taste culprit.  Someday I may try this again since it sounded like something I'd love.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  Husband loved it... kids loved..and I loved it.  The next morning the leftovers were made into a great breakfast burrito.  Another hit!  Thank you Charlie for this new recipe that will probably be cooked weekly from now on!  Oh..and did I mention how easy it was.

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I took the advice of another review and added the soup to the meat mixture then layered cheese and topped with the tots.  I like the crispy tots and so did my boyfriend.  Also added some canned green chilies and a little minced garlic to the meatfor a little extra flavor.

Will make for next pot luck gathering.

I love this recipe!  I do layer it differently though, I mix the soup mixture with the ground beef, sprinkle the cheese over that and then add the layer of tator tots, I like them crispy.

Love this recipe! I used Campbell cheese instead of cream of mushroom Soup and added a couple of spoons of Greek yogurt. Mixed everything together. Topped with tater tots and cheese. Delicious!

This was yummy!  I had no cream of mushroom soup so used cream of chicken instead. also  when cooking the ground beef I had added epicure spices- herb and onion and garlic herb and when i layered the tater tots i also added those 2 spices also. I would make this again and if I do will add mix veggies to it.

I used ground turkey, half an onion and 2 tablespoons of garlic. Added corn and homemade hot sauce as well. I used half a stick of butter to keep the turkey from drying out. I will use 1/4 next time to see how it comes out. Other seasoning was added for more flavor.

It's a good concept but fairly bland.  I made it again and completely revamped it to add flavor and make it healthier. I used broccoli tots vs tater tots. Used ground turkey vs beef. Added riced cauliflower to meet for more veg. Added garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper. And a hearty amt of italian seasoning. Turned out great.

I made this a one pan dish by using my cast-iron skillet. I sautéed the beef and onion. Then I added the premixed milk and soup to the beef and mixed it all together. Next, I added a can of drained green beans on top followed by 2 cups of cheese. I topped it with hash browns. I baked it at 400° for 40 minutes.

I added thawed frozen veggies and the tater tots I used had a seasoning on them already. I also cooked the meat in a cast iron pan. That way, after I drained the grease off, I was able to pop the whole thing in the oven and have one less dish to clean.

My parents enjoyed it. It was super easy to make and clean up

I have to admit not having high hopes for this recipe but it turned out really well!  The only changes I made were no salt, I added a bit of chipotle pepper powder to the ground beef and onion while frying, and put the milk/mushroom soup mix on top of the beef. Was nice and easy to make.

This is the one we make every time. Easy, and tastes great! We used ground turkey instead of ground beef, only because we switched years ago to eat less red meat.

Yes, my husband wants it again.  I only used one-half pound of ground beef as there are only two of us.  Even then  it made two meals.

This was a family favourite as the kids were growing up and now it’s a favourite of the grandkids. Because we prefer it I’ve made a couple changes. First one kid won’t eat anything with onions so I skip them but if he’s not there I add onions with the cooking beef. I also don’t dilute the mushroom soup and I layer it all with tater tots on the bottom and end it with tater tots on the top.  This makes the tater tots nice and. Risoy on the top. Try this recipe and your kids will thank you.

Good old-fashioned midwestern comfort food. It's not fancy, and you can go a million different ways personalizing it, but it's pretty great as written too.

I cooked the ground beef with salt, pepper, granulated garlic and Italian seasoning. Then, I added the chopped onion and cooked them until tender. To that, I added half of a can of Del Monte whole kernel corn, drained. I blended cream of celery soup and 3/4 cup of milk in a saucepan and poured it over the meat mixture in an 8x8 casserole. Next, I added 4 handfuls of Mexican cheese blend, put the tots on next, and added a thin layer of shredded cheese. I topped it with 1/2 tsp. of smoked sweets paprika. 35 minutes at 350, then 20 minutes at 300.Good luck and happy eating

Ok, I used the recipe as a starting point.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I used cheese soup, instead of the soup called for.  I put asparagus in the dish, with the ground turkey and onion on top of it.  I mixed in salsa with the milk and soup.  and I used two cups of shredded mexican cheese blend and a whole bag of Tater Crowns, instead of Tater Tots.  But it was good and I would make it again

I did make a few changes.  I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef  and added a little Worcestershire sauce.  I also added in a can of french cut green beans and a can of mushrooms so that I could stretch this into a 9x13 pan, so there would be leftovers for dinner.  Added the cheese at the end and put it back in to melt.

I made this dish exactly as specified in the original recipe. I thought it had all the ingredients for a great dish, but I was mildly disappointed with the final results. It was simply missing "something", and was rather bland. In the future I will use this recipe as a base, and modify it once I decide how to give it some pizazz.

family loved it! I tried a few of the suggestions about seasoning the meat, adding vegetables and not putting anything on top of the tater tots so they stay crispy. My family can be picky sometimes to I try to keep with what I think they would like, which is why I also added frenchers onions in-between several levels. I think this is a great recipe even without changes as it gives you options to play with.

I seasoned the meat while it was cooking instead of afterwards and used onion tater tots instead of plain tots.  Turned out great!

I have been looking for the original tater tot recipe for quite some time. I only changed as follows: added Worcestershire sauce to taste and mixed the cheese in with the meat mixture. I think this made the “tots” turn out crispier. Thank you for the recipe. Will definitely make again soon!

I doubled this recipe and added garlic when browning the meat.  I used two Amy's semi-condensed soup at 14.3 oz and did not add milk.  I also used seasoned Tater Tots.  It was a hit.  I don't usually serve casseroles for family dinner but this was for a family lunch and even the hard to please diners loved it.  
Next time, I might take the advice of others and mix the soup with the meat and put the tater tots on top.

As far as casserole dishes go, this is pretty typical fare.  Nothing surprising or exciting, but if you need to get dinner on the table fast and you have these ingredients.  It'll fill the bill.  I liked it, but wouldn't recommend it for a special dinner event.

This is a good recipe. After reading some reviews I developed my plan. I sautéed my onion with some finely chopped carrots and celery, then browned my ground beef (about 1 and1/3 lb) along with the vegetables; seasoning that beef with salt, and garlic pepper and a tiny dash of cayenne. I had about 1/2 cup sour cream in the fridge and added that to the soup mixture and mixed it with the ground beef mixture; then threw in some frozen green peas and at least a cup of the cheddar.  I let the tater tots thaw after I added them to the top, then sprinkled another 1/2 cup of the cheese over all, before baking. This was gobbled up by adults and little kids. We all agreed that the tots were probably best in the crispy state. So basically shepherds pie with tots instead of mash. Again, the pan was clea

Made this because I needed something fairly quick & easy & comforting as the weather turns cooler at night (& not chicken!).  After reading other reviews first, I made similar changes to meat while browning it, adding worchestire, minced garlic, garlic powder, pepper, etc for added flavor. I started having second thoughts about this recipe while placing items in the baking dish.  My family turned their noses up on it as well based on the appearance. It is basic.  It is not even middle of the road acceptable. Squeeze ketchup on it, take a bite & close your eyes & sure you think you're eating a cheese burger & fries but honestly, next time I'll choose to put the energy into firing up the grill for actual cheese burgers (without the mega sodium canned soup!!!).

Made this exactly as written except that I doubled the recipe, which increased the cooking time. We loved this as is, and think that it's delicious without any modifications, it's also a great base recipe so you can tweak it to your own tastes. Next time we want to add a few chopped green chilies to spice it up a bit, mix the soup with the ground beef so it doesn't fall apart when serving. Thanks for a new regular in our comfort food rotation!

This is a very delicious recipe! I decided to make this recipe as it seemed easy and quick to make for a jewelry party I had. Everyone was asking what it was as they expressed how good it was. I did substitute ground beef to ground turkey and seasoned a little more than suggested and I switched out the cream of mushroom for cream of celery.
This was a hit!!!

Turned out very good! I too added the soup to the meat (pork sausage) and also I embedded the  tater tots into the mixture somewhat. Also placed under the broiler for a couple minutes to crisp up the top to a golden brown! Very good. You could also add some veggies to get some nutrition into the kids!

The only thing I will change next time is to fry the tater tots before adding because they were soggy and also maybe pour the soup over the meat mixture and not the tater tots...but the flavor was great, just the texture was a little disappointing

It is very good but I would use less than  the whole package of tater tots as they didn't cook all the way through in  40 min.  Possibly turn oven up to 375 or cook 45 min.

Gluten free option:  I made this gluten free by using Ore-Ida gluten free tater tots and Pacific (or Imagine brand) gluten free cream of mushroom soup mix found at Whole Foods.  I mixed ground turkey and a roll of Jimmy Dean original sausage, which is gluten free and  I substituted some garlic salt and onion powder for chopped onions, and mixed soup with cooked meat to layer.  I put cheese on top of meet pushing the tater tots into the cheese and then sprinkled some cheese on top of  Tatar tots.  It was a hit with my husband and 11 year old daughter, although my 8 year old son doesn't care for anything mixed together:-/.

Made as written.  I'll say this, if you need something filling in your gullet, this is the dish for that.  If you want something with texture and flavor, this might not be the one for you.  Glad I tried it, but, won't make again.

I don't wish to criticize but how could one not add some spices or herbs to the meat?  I did before I tried it and it came out superb.  A very good recipe but you need some oomph, like garlic, cumin, ground coriander.  Just gives it a kick.

I have been making this for twenty years.  Make sure you mix the cream of ____ (whichever you use, I don't like mushrooms) with the hamburger, then put the cheese layer, then the tater tots.  I actually use the smaller crowns, as they get crisper then the regular tots.

Made it with 'broccoli' tots that were leftover from a previous meal.   Mixed the soup into the meat and most of the cheese.  Crisped up nicely that way.  Great way to use 2nd day tot leftovers.  Probably leftover regular veg too.

This was really an awful dish.  I can't believe that  250 of years of American cookery we have evolved to the Tater Tot Bake!
I only tried it because I had never had a "tater tot" in my 76 years and thought I might be missing something.  This  pseudo
potato is bad enough with out turning it into glop!

This recipe is great with a box of Jiffy cornbread at the bottom of the dish, then pile on the toppings and cook as directed. after it is done put sour cream, and salsa on top, it is wonderful

No mushroom soup used cream of celery, no milk used heavy cream. It was a big hit and told I could make anytime!

This was a good base recipe for the final product that emerged out of the oven. added 1 1/2 cups frozen peas and carrots. i seasoned the beef with salt and pepper and garlic powder.  i also added hot sauce to the soup mixture. instead of  a fresh onion, i used 1/2 a large can of crispy fried onions and i sprinkled them over top of the potato layer.   This was a yummy, fast and easy Dish for a cold day.

I wish people wouldn't write  reviews on recipes if they've made modifications. That being said, I've made this for many many years AS IS and it's delicious. An easy weeknight supper for a family, easily doubled or tripled for a group. Warm comfort food.

One of the main changes I made was to use taco seasoning on the ground beef, I also added some cayenne for a little extra kick but I doubt everyone wants that. Next time I will definitely add the soup mixture UNDER the tater tots. Whole family loved it though

I added a little Season All to the beef and onion. And I did half mild cheddar, half sharp cheddar for a little stronger cheesy flavor. Love this recipe!

i took this as a starting point as i heard this particular recipe was a little bland, i used a 50/50 mix of beef and sausage, i seasoned the beef/sausage with chives, garlic, rosemary, salt and black pepper, and rubbed sage. Then i also made a sauce out of cream of chicken + 1 stick of butter + sour cream + cup of water and i poured the sauce over the tater tots. it turned out better than i expected. this recipe is a great as a starting point, as all recipes on the internet should be treated as.

I used ground vennison. I fry the onions first, then add water before they get too brown, (about a half of a cup) and add venison and 1 or 2 cubes of beef bullion to take down wild taste. Usually I add 1 tsp of minced garlic to help do the same, however did not use garlic in this recipe.  I was however confused as to how much tater tots, as it states 1/2 package (32 ounces) . My package is 24 ounces. I used 24 ounces and cooked in a 9x9 glass pan. turned it down just a smidge due to the glass pan. It turned out great.

I made it during the Christmas holidays as something quick and easy to throw together.  I had never made it with cheese before.  I did layer the cheese as suggested for a crispier topping.   My son and grandsons licked the casserole clean it was that good.

Great starter recipe. Read the reviews and made as follows: 1 lb ground beef, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 c milk, 1 can cut green beans, 32 oz. bag of tater tots, half an onion diced, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 Tbsp Greek seasoning and 2 cups shredded cheese. I browned the beef with the onion, garlic and Greek seasoning, drained and returned to pan. Mixed in soup, milk and green beans. Spread mixture in a 9x13 pan, sprinkled shredded cheese over the top, then layered the tator tots on top. Baked in .350° oven for 40 minutes. Husband and kids loved this! "Best tator tot recipe ever"

Exactly what I was looking for. Similar to what my Mom and Mother-in-law make. I like to use the cream of mushroom and chicken soup. I also added a little hot sauce and Worchestershire (watch the salt if you do that). Also, I add the soup, etc, to the skillet with the beef and ground onions, then pour it in the casserole and top with the tots and cheese. I cooked it at 375, for altitude reasons and to get the tots a little more crispy. Great comfort food!

I used Lawrys seasoning salt on my meat. I can't have onions but the seasoning spices I can. GIves it a little flavor. We like ours with the mini tator tots. I love how easy this is to throw together and make.

I put into a smaller pan, I think it was an 8x8. Like other reviewers have mentioned: I browned the meat w/ the onions, mixed the soup and 1/2 cup of milk into the meat mixture. I added the pepper and some garlic salt to the meat, and a smidge of cut up red peppers. I put 1 can of green beans on the bottom of the pan, cooked a couple strips of bacon, chopped them and added them to the meat mixture. Put the meat mixture on top of the green beans, added cheese on top of that, then added the tator tots on top of the cheese to keep them crispy. Overal, I loved the simpleness of this recipe. I will definately male this again. Thanks for sharing :)

I chose this recipe as I needed to use up some tater tots and some hamburgers that I was going to make.  The burgers were made up of ground beef, pork and Italian sausage.  I seasoned the soup with garlic powder and hot sauce.  I divided the casserole into 2 smaller dishes as it is just DH and myself.  This dish made up fast and simple ...perfect for those busy days ahead.  Kudos on a good recipe

My family loved it...even my very picky 12 year old ate his entire portion.  I did as others suggested and added the soup and milk to the ground beef mixture.  I also added some seasoning to the beef per my taste (some onion and garlic powder).

We actually really enjoyed this. The current pic does not do the dish justice. I'm pregnant so it's hard for me to get on board with trying new things. The cream of mushroom didn't sound appealing to the baby. End result was delicious though! Only thing we'd change is double the tater tots.

My picky kids and husband love this dish.  I usually add in frozen corn and green beans that I sautée some and today I also sautéed in some kale.  I also use a soup that happens not to be condensed, so no additional milk needed.  There is also a tip I'd like to share: while you're cooking the ground chicken / turkey (that's what I use, organic three packs for $14.99 at Costco - can't beat the price), cook the tater tots according to the package directions, this way they're crispier and will not be as soggy in the casserole.  Enjoy!!!

added garlic powder to chop meat and onions then did as others poured soup and milk mixture over chop meat then layered tater tots and cheese on top. My family loved and ate the whole thing no left overs from these picky eaters:)

I made a few changes as others suggested.  I sprayed bottom of pan, added buttermilk biscuits, flattened really well.  Cooked the onions first, then added ground beef and seasonings we like (salt, pepper, garlic, worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper (just a dash) and parsley.  I mixed a can of cheese soup with milk and added it to the beef mixture and poured it all over the biscuits.  I then added a little grated cheese, put a layer of tater tots on top of all that and then ended with a little more grated cheese.  I like the tater tots crunchy on top.  It was fabulous and could be made without the biscuits I'm sure.  Son had seconds.  That's when you know it's good.

Great  budget- friendly, busy weeknight recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!!!! I did make a few adjustments. Instead of milk I use 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of cheddar cheese soup. I also layer the bottom of the casserole dish with tater tots and cooked them until they were soft enough to smash to create a single layer of tater tots. The I added the beef, spread the soup mixture on top, then the cheese and then added another layer of tater tots. I also use 2 pounds of ground beef, but that was just because I have several people I was cooking for.

Great recipe! I baked my tater tots in the oven 20 minutes and then added them to the casserole.  This  was to insure the tots were done and crisp.

I let the tater tots thaw out in the bottom of the  baking pan while I fried the burger and onion on the stove.  So my tots were on the bottom with the meat the next layer. I also stirred 1 cup of the cheese into the milk and mushroom soup mixture reserving 1/2 cup for sprinkling on top. This was a very good casserole and we will be making it often.

Great base, but I change it up a LOT.
I used a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, didn't use any milk, added rosemary and a splash of Worcestershire sauce and some balsamic vinegar to the meat and onions while finishing in the skillet (after draining fat)  before putting in the 9 x 13 pan. Added a can of corn, too. Layered cheese onto the mixture, then pushed the tator tots into the cheese as someone suggested and put the rest of the cheese on the tator tots. Best version I've made so far.

Excellent, easy, basic casserole.  The family loved it.  I mixed the soup mixture into pan with cooked ground beef, onions and garlic powder that I had also added a small can green chiles. Added frozen peas before pouring all into casserole dish.  Sprinkled cheese over top then added tater tots with a light sprinkle of cheese over all.  Everyone agreed that this recipe is a keeper.

New favorite! I made a few small changes. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of celery instead and added a can of mushrooms. I also added some cooked corn for some added veggies. I put the tater tots on after the soup so they were more on the crunchy side when done.

My other half likes things spicy and this made it a hit for him :). So, I made a few changes to spice it : I used Cayenne pepper, Chili pepper, salt, and black pepper (to taste) after the ground beef (2lbs versus 1) was browned. I also cooked in some diced jalapeños with the onions. I think next time I either need to use another can of cream of mushroom or perhaps a can of cheddar cheese soup. Super easy as a new mom to pull off!

I put the tater tots on the top. That was the only change I made to this recipe. The tots didn't turn out that crispy. Next time I make it I'll cook the tots separately.

I used Velveeta instead of cheese. I put cheese on the hamburger & on top. I wish I would have put the soup on the hamburger not on the tator tots. It was good, just kind of mushy.

I made this for the first time and loved it. 
I did a couple of things different.
I made it with Ground Italian Sausage and mixed the soup mixture into the meat before putting the meat into the casserole dish.
Another reason I loved it is that it is easy to make and does not have a lot items going into it.
I love recipes that have 5 times or less and quick to make.

So easy to make and so good that my kids always ask for seconds.  I do substitute the mushroom soup for cream of chicken because I think it gives it a better flavor. All in all I love this and make it several times in the winter.

As suggested by others, poured soup mixture over meat, then added cheese, then tots. Good basic, easy dinner!

My husband and I really love this dish. This is something quick and easy when you don't feel like going overboard. The only thing I changed was instead of half a bag of tater tots I used a whole bag. They came out of the oven crunchy and delicious. I usually freeze the leftovers so we have some for later.

I made this slightly different than the recipe said. the thought of soup over the top of tater tots just didn't appeal to me, so I mixed up the meat and soup, layered it with cheese, then put the tots over the top. Smells fantastic while it's cooking and tastes perfect for what I was craving today. I will definitely make this again. So easy!

Great, but needed some help. We added veggies (in this case, green beans), as we'd done with similar recipes. It makes a world of difference.

This is a family weekday favorite that is easy to put together. The only thing I have changed after making it quite a few times is to adjust your soup to how soupy you want it. It needs a little extra liquid because of bake time but the recipe is a little too much. Also I have found that cooking the tater tots ahead makes them nice and crispy and I realize that is a preference.

Very easy to make!  My kids love it.  I add corn to the bottom of the dish, then the meat (which I substitute onion powder for actual onions), then top with the soup/milk mixture. I then top with the tots. This way they get a little crispier.  Gonna make it tonight again actually!

At first I was worried that there wasn't enough meat or sauce to cover the amount of Tator tots for the recipe but it came out super delicious and really filling. Everyone enjoyed it and you get stuffed. The only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is it was " amazingly" tasteful. Very All america. Good recipe.

Beware: This recipe is ADDICTING! This is such a great recipe, definitely a favorite of mine and my daughter's. I've made it many times and I prefer to add garlic and onions to the beef when browing. I usually add corn and/or broccoli to the beef as well. I like to add a bit more milk to the sauce to make it easier to cover the whole pan. 

I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

After a few tweaks (I added 4 cups of fresh, chopped spinach, 3 cups of broccoli florets, red pepper flakes, thyme, paprika and oregano to the meat mixture) and put half the soup/milk mixture over the meat, then cheese, then tater tots and the rest of the soup and cheese to get a more crispy tot, my family really enjoyed this. It was hot and hearty on a snowy night. We liked it enough with the tweaks that I'll make it again for a quick, easy meal, but for us, it wasn't love.

So this was much better than I though it would be, I'm happy to say. I did add extra items, carrots, peas and corn all frozen but all I did the same.  I am so surprised that my hubby and daughter liked it.  Guess I better keep it on the monthly menu.

This was great. As with many others, I added the soup to the meat and mix together. And I used garlic salt and regular black pepper. Was wonderful. My kids asked for seconds.

Excellent! The only change that I made was to add two cloves of chopped garlic along with the red onion while browning the beef. Because, it's...garlic. Rave reviews at home.

Very good. I added corn to the mix and it was just like Shepard's Pie!  As others suggested , I put the tots on top so they were crunchy.

For more flavor, try using a can of Campbell's beef gravy in place of the soup; use no milk but add a tablespoon each of ketchup and Worcestershire.  Mix that with the browned beef and sautéed onions in the skillet before transferring to a 9x9 pan.  Sprinkle with grated medium sharp cheese, then cover with tater tots (about 1/2 of the bag will do it).  Cook at 425 for 25 minutes or so.  Yum.  Great for breakfast or dinner

You can use any flavor of soup you like with this.  I use Chunky baked potato and bacon.  It does add more potato but my husband likes that flavor the best in this.  I brown the meat with seasoning first and then add soup after draining the fat to heat everything at the same time, put the mixture into a 9 x 13 casserole and add a layer of shredded colby-jack then top with a single layer of tater tots and dot with more cheese.  The tater tots turn out crispy this way. Yummy!!

I prepared this using the ingredients as listed, except I mixed the cooked beef/onion mixture with the soup, layering the tots on top and adding a layer of shredded cheese. Even while preparing this, I knew this recipe was a flop. It just reminded me of dog food. My husband said it was edible, but he'll eat anything. He didn't go for seconds like he normally would so I know he didn't enjoy it. One bite and I gave my plate to the dogs. This is one of those rare recipes with high reviews that have let me down tremendously.

I love quick and yummy recipes. I buttered the glass pan before spreading the meat. Then I sprinkled some cheese, added a full bag of frozen tater tots, poured the sauce, and finished with more cheese. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely a family delight!

I used to make something similar to this using a cream of chicken and hash brown potatoes (the diced kind).  This is pretty good too with the cream of mushroom (and I don't like mushrooms).  Only thing different is that I also tosssed in a can of corn on top of the ground beef.  They have all sorts of creamed soups out there with herbs and garlic, might try one of those next time.

I personally add more beef (1.5 lbs), as we like a hearty meal.  I also add a can of corn (drained) over the beef layer.  I always put this recipe in a 9x13 pan, and it allows for amble leftovers.

I also like to layer it this way, as I feel it cooks better:
-Beef 
-Corn
-Almost all of the Shredded Cheese
-Tator Tots
-Soup Mixture over Tator Tots (we like them softer, not crispy)
-Rest of Shredded Cheese

I also gave just some minor adjustments.  I put a tablespoon of onion soup mix in with my ground beef.  I also added about 1/2 cup of corn and 1/2 cup of peas.  My BF thought it was a definite keeper.  I was a little reluctant to try considering I HATE mushroom soup.  But, surprising I ate every bite and will make again for sure.

It was easy and Yummy...I changed it up a little because my family will not eat any thing mushroom.  I used cheddar cheese condensed soup and nott as much milk. I also added bacon bits on the very top.

Epic failure! The boys (7, 10, 12 and 16) love the breakfast tater tot casserole and I thought they would love this; however, this was bland, plain and boring. They repeatedly requested I not make this again. It needs something more... good base recipe maybe.

This is a great recipe for an "after work" quick meal.  My family loves it an it takes just minutes to get into the oven.  Flavor is good and we add a can of drained green beans to it as well to put in some veggies!

Classic! Fast and easy to make.  The kids love it and there are rarely any leftovers.  I don't pour the soup over the whole thing; I add the soup to the ground beef and that's the bottom layer.  Then I add cheese, and finally the tots.

I love this recipe....as a starter. I cook about a pound and a half of hamburger with minced garlic, minced onion, salt & pepper. Once the hamburger is cooked, I add TWO cans of cream of mushroom soup, and 1/2 cup of milk. I pour the meat & soup mixture over the green beans, add cheese, then tator tots, throw some salt & pepper on top, and bake! Quick, easy meal!

One of my son's favorite meals.  Like others, I added frozed vegetbables (green beans or mixed).  I also put the cheese over the meat mixture before the tater tots on top.

My family and I just liked it, but I think its because I changed it up a little.  I used creamed corn as the base and I think I wouldnt do that again.  I used Johnsonville sausage instead of hamburg and used cheddar cheese soup instead of mushroom just because I dont like mushroom.  I did go back for seconds, so I gave it 5 stars because I thought if it was made it without the creamed corn it would be awesome.

Really super delish once I made some tweaks cause my boyfriend has to have lots of flavor to dishes and was afraid it would be too bland for him. I made the following adjustments and the dish was a total knock out!


-Cooked ground turkey with taco seasoning, garlic powder, onions, peppers.

-Combined in large bowl cooked ground turkey, 1 can chipotle corn, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can fiesta nacho cheese soup

-Put mixture in greased pan, layer with cheese until completely covered, layer with tater tots, then sprinkle more cheese on top

-Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and broiled the last 3-5 minutes to crisp tater tots

YUM! No need to doctor this baby up! (I usually feel the need to do this) It's hard to believe that a dish could be so basic and easy could be so delish! I used to make tator tot casserole quite a bit out of high school but haven't made it in years. Today, I was looking up recipes to make ahead and freeze and I ran across this one. I was hesitant about pouring the cream of mushroom over my tots, as I have always mixed it with the burger and place the tots on top to get crispy. Well, there is NO need for crispy in this recipe! I like this way so much better!! Will make this again and again! Thanks a bunch!

I use the ENTIRE 32 oz bag of tots (minus maybe 6-8 pcs ) for one 9x13 pan. I place them side by side in rows. My boys want every square inch covered in tots. I can't blame them - who doesn't LOVE tater tots? All but one boy tops this with ketchup. YUM!

This just didn't do it for me. A lot of cheese, but it didn't have a lot of flavor, maybe if you added more spices?

My hunny liked it but I felt it was missing something. I made exactly as stated the first time. I think I will mess with it and see if I can make it something we both love. I will say that as stated above I felt my 9' x 13' pan was too big to make it in but I lack a smaller oven safe dish at this point.

This turned out really tasty.  In my version though: 1) browned meat, remove from pan, drain fat; 2) sauteed onions then beef to onions; add few tablespoons of wirschester, plus salt / pepper 3) while that is cooking, cook the cream of mushroom over medium heat, add 1/2 cup of milk.... then follow rest recipe

I did exactly as an earlier reviewer suggested posted below but instead of green beans I used creme of corn, used more garlic and I did no know what greek seasoning is....also added 1 tsp of Worchester sauce...here is her review that I followed with the above substitions...It came out beautiful and everyone at the potluck loved it...
 Used 2lbs of ground sirloin, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cheddar cheese soup, a full bag of tater tots, and a can of french style green beans. I browned the beef with the onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon greek seasoning. I then mixed the soups and 1 cup of milk into the meat after it was browned and drained. I layered the greenbeans on the bottom of a 9X13 casserole dish, spooned the meat mixture over it, then sprinkled 2 cups of shredded cheddar over that, then topped with the tots, which I patted down into the cheese. sprinkled the whole thing with some fresh ground pepper, and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. For those other reviewers who complained about blandness, well I think it's common sense to season your meat while cooking, and hey, be adventurous and use this recipe as a starting point, tweak it with different soups, cheeses, spices...

I thought this recipe was good.  I only made 2 changes.  I used minced onion, and I added a veggie mix of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.  I think it's a great base recipe and something I'll definitely be making again.

You know I enjoyed this.... But I changed it a little to fit my taste buds..
First- I cooked and sliced up Beer Bratwarst.
Then I lined the bottom of the pan.
Second- I used 1 cup milk with Cream of Chicken soup.. (I dislike mushroom soup) I also added a little garlic powder and some seasoned salt.
Added to the top of my tator tots and cheddar cheese. With some fresh ground pepper. Bake for 1 hour at 400. I enjoyed it

I changed a lot but it turned out fantastic!!!!  I used organic beef, and instead of a can of soup which I didn't have in my cupboard, I used 1 3/4 cups of milk and 1/2 cup sour cream and a package of onion soup mix, I added 1/2 cup frozen corn and instead of potato tots i used red and white mini potatoes and parboiled them first and the cheese topping was Tex Mex.  Oh my gosh - I am eating it now and it is sooooo good!

Even my picky husband found it delicious and said we should make this again. Only giving 4 stars because it doesn't look appetizing at all, so you have to go on faith that it'll taste good once you put it in your mouth.

I used slightly more tater tots than the recipe calls for, and I added the sauce over the meat and did not pour it over the tots so they those would stay crunchy.

I added about 2 tsp of minced garlic to the onions and before i browned the meat i added a packet of lipton onion soup mix. I also put the tator tots on top of the cheese and mixed the meat and the milk/soup mix together (in the casserole dish. I thought that it was a little too salty, but my husband said that it was perfect.
We didn't even need ketchup

Not too impressive. Felt like I was eating a school cafeteria lunch. I tried a lot of the suggestions and mixed the soup with the meat. I used ground turkey and seasoned it well. Also, threw in some frozen green beans to add some variation. Wasn't horrible, but wasn't something I would likely make again.

I give this recipe a solid 4 stars.  Its definitely a down and dirty meal and not a fancy one but we liked it.  I did like most reviews said and mixed the soup and milk in with the chop meat.  I also added corn as well and seasoned the ground beef with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I didnt use the whole bag of tater tots.  I cooked it for 30 min and the tots were brown but some of them in the middle werent  completely cooked, so I will cook it longer next time.  My 11 year old cleaned his plate and went back for more so I will make it again.

As is this is very very bland and boring.  You have to add vegtables and additional seasoning.  My husband thought eating spoonfuls of ground beef was gross.  I will not be making this again.

I had never had tater tot bake or casserole and loved this!!  SUPER easy, fast and cheap to make - my three favorite things!   I, like others, mixed the soup mixture in with the veggies and ground beef, then layered the tater tots on top.  

I also made mine with a can of drained corn and half a can of green beans.  My four year old went nuts over it!

Happy cooking!

Very good! Once finished cooking, broil for a few minutes to crisp the tots and melt the cheese. Also, added onion soup mix to the hamburger to add some extra flavor.

I have been making this for many years and my family never gets sick of it.  I make mine just a tad different.  I brown the hamburger, drain then add the soup/milk mixture (you can use non/ low fat cream of mushroom soup ) to the hamburger right in the skillet.  I stir around until it is really creamy and warm.  I pour that over the tator tots evenly and cover and cook.  After about an hour I uncover and add the cheese and cook an additional 15 mins or so until it is bubbly.  Some of the soup/milk mixture absorbs into the tots and it is sooooo good!  The tots will still get a little crispy on the bottom of your pan, but if you like them all crispy don't make it this way.  This is one that never gets old!

i've always loved this recipe however I do use cream of celery soup rather than mushroom. 

As other suggested, I always mix in the soup with the beef and onion. This time around I also layered in green beans because why dirty another pan :)

I have to say I have never made A tater tot casserole. My husbands coworker brought some in for lunch and my husband said i want to have that for dinner. It was a huge hit the kids and husband loved it. I did as others suggested i mixed the meat and soup mix together. I added a can of drained corn. My 13 year old wants to try using sausage and green beans next time. thanks for sharing

Quick and easy recipe.  Used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom (mushrooms gross me out) and it was good and hearty.  Will definitely make again.

Going exactly by the recipe, I'd give this zero stars, sorry.  Had I added enough tater tots to completely cover the top of the casserole, I might give it one star.  (Allrecipes won't let me post this rating without at least one star)  If I'd known the outcome prior to making it, I'd have had a can of soup with some crackers instead.

wish I would have read the modifications prior in the reviews.  Did not seem like the right ratios of hamburger and the soup at all.  I would have put the one can of soup in with the hamburger prior putting the mix into the dish and putting something else like the cheese soup over it and then a little of the shredded cheese.  The time was also off for me.  I baked it for 40 minutes and it was still mushy.  I will try this again as it is simple, just adjust how it is made and make seasoning adjustments.  I did use a little oil with the hamburger, a little seasoned salt and pepper to the hamburger.  Will try some greek seasoning as in previous comments next time.
IN MODIFICATION TO PREV REVIEW:
After doctoring it up a bit with my own spices, this tured out quite well.  READ REVIEWS FIRST TO GET IDEAS.  This recipe is basically a starting point to do with what you want and pretty much not much more than that.  But I did write down what I did to MY version to keep in my recipe file.  Thank you for the basic idea here and add what you will!

This was pretty good when done with modifications (see reviews by other users). I mixed the soups in with the meat, did a layer of meat, then did a layer of portobello mushrooms. Threw a lil cheese on, another layer of meat, cheese, then the tots on top. The tots came out crispy but there was something about the taste of the tots that just didn't vibe. This could be a brand issue, not sure. I'm going to investigate other potato topping options but overall, a good casserole.

My husband, my 18-month-old son and I all loved this recipe. Will definitely be making it again. As some previous posters have suggested, I added a package of Lipton onion soup mix along to the cream of mushroom soup and milk. I also put a little garlic in with the beef/onion. If you're adding the onion soup mix, it does make it a little saltier. I might suggest using the reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup to help with that.

Very good!!  I did make a couple of changes (I know I hate changes..) anyway I added a Tablespoon minced garlic, an 1/8 cup sour cream to the soup mixture and I mixed the soup mixture with the ground beef and onion.  I put this mix on the bottom, cheese and then tater tots.  I baked for about 30 minutes and then added more cheese to the top and bake 10 min more.  I then broiled the top to give it a little crunch.  Hubby loved it.

Awesome dish!! Very Simple and quick to prepare. I was even surprised that my son, who is a very picky eater Absolutely LOVED it. And what makes this dish even better is that not only is Good_Eats but also is very budget friendly.

The only thing I changed to this recipe to make it more hometown yummy is I cooked in some Velveeta into the meat. Might be over cheesy for some but I'm a guy and it made it super awesome!!

Made this recipe last night and it was the ultimate comfort food on a cold night! I used cream of chicken instead of the milk and reduced the mount of cheese to 3/4 cup. I also substituted dried minced onions for the chopped onions since I was in a hurry. So yummy, I had enough leftovers for lunch today!

This is great comfort food!  I usually use 1 1/2 1bs. of ground beef and double the sauce (sometimes I leave a little bit of it out though).  I play around with the type of soup too...my favorite is Cream of Chicken w/Mushroom.  Slap the cheese on top, bake and dig in!

I just made this casserole and cannot be happier I tried it. It was fast, and easy and is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the only exception being I seasoned my meat while it cooked, with salt, pepper and minced garlic. I was looking for a healthy version, so I used low-fat ground beef (90/10), low fat/sodium soup, and fat-free tator-tots.  It was delicious, and my husband at three plates!

This was a good basic recipe.  I seasoned the meat with a package of dry onion soup mix.  I used cream of potato soup per preference.  I added the soup to the beef mixture and put that in the dish first.  Then I added a layer of cheddar cheese and put the tator tots on top.

I mixed my cream of mushroom soup, milk, onions, and corn in with my drained ground beef to heat it all through before baking. I followed reviewer's advice and put most of my cheese UNDER the Tater Tots. I also baked at 400 degrees for 300 minutes to create crispy tots.   We'll make this again for sure!

Very delicious! Even got rave reviews from my picky hubby! I took the advice of another reviewer and added garlic powder to the ground beef. Then I layered green beans, ground beef, soup mixture, cheese, and then tater tots. Served with homemade buns. Mm mm good! I also have made this recipe adding 2/3 cup corn instead of green beans.

I know this dish isn't gourmet, but it sure is good!  This is comfort food to me.  My mother-in-law has been making this casserole for years.  When I first tried it, I wasn't sure I would like it, since I don't like tater tots.  But I love this dish!  We layer ours slightly differently, but the ingredients are the same.  The beef and soup go on the bottom, then the cheese, then the tater tots on top, where they get all nice and browned.

this was a really great dish! I added garlic and worcestire sauce while browning the meat. I also mixed canned corn into the meat and also listened to others recommendations of pouring the soup into the meat. Although I did pour a little bit ontop of some of the tots to try it. It was great either way. I also used cream (more than asked for) because I only had vanilla soy. it was super yummy. I will definitly make this again, my 2.5 year old loved this. next time i will add green onions into the cheese for some color and a little more taste.

My husband and I really liked the recipe, my children were not at all impressed, they thought the tater tots were a bit soft, even after I placed them back in the oven.  I will make it again, but will probably layer it next time.   Thanks for sharing.

I made this and it was great! The only thing I added was some garlic in the meat when cooking. I should mention I used the tater tots frozen and I cooked it according to the recipe and they were not done. I turned my oven up to 400 and cooked an extra 15 minutes. Came out beautiful. My husband loved it! That says a lot becuase one of his favorite meals is Shepherd's pie. This will be a staple in our house. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding corn. The family loved it. Kids asked for seconds. My husband asked next time to add green beans too so I will try it.

Very good! Made this for my bf and I tonight. My bf didn't like it, But that's no surprise... He is 'picky' about cream of mushroom soup - sometimes he likes it, sometimes he doesn't (oh well!). As many others did, I made a few adjustments to add a bit of pizzaz and to streamline preparation. Here's what I did: a) microwaved my meat instead of frying it on the stovetop (simply place your beef in a covered casserole dish; microwave on HIGH for 5 min., then drain, return to dish and microwave on high for another 3-4 min.), b) added a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to my meat (i.e. 1/2 during the first 5 min. of cooking and the rest after the meat was drained) and eliminated the chopped onion alltogether, c) in the SAME dish that I cooked my meat in, I added my pre-mixed can of Campbell's cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic soup/milk and 1/2 c. of the shredded cheese (mild cheddar) called for and d) topped with tater tots and remaining cheese, baked for 35 minutes then broiled for anotehr 2-3 min. to crisp the top. Served with dinner rolls, this was a very filling and quick meal. I don't think this casserole needs anything else added to it (i.e. veggies), but you certainly can if you want to. Definitely simple, easy and economical kiddo fare! Thanks for sharing :)

OK, I did change it up a bit but the DH and I loved it even more than the kids! lol..  I changed the soup to condesed tomato.  I added 3/4 can of water and one beef buillon cube, some garlic powder, Worcestersire sauce, cayenne,  green beans and corn to the recipe.  Put a layer of tater tots on the bottom of the baking dish then the meat/veggie mixture over it and ended with tater tots.  I baked at 425 until my taters were done about 30 min. then covered with the cheese and baked another 5 min.  Next time I'm going to try to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch only because the bottom Tots were a bit on the mushy side..  Very good though!...

I avoided this dish for so long because it just seemed weird to me... Well, I'm trying to shop less so had to work with ingredients I had on hand, and ended up making this dish. I was happily surprised! I used shallots instead of onion, and mixed the soup (fat free) into the beef. Served with corn & peas. The leftovers tasted yummy too. I'm glad to say this will be made again!

I made this for dinner tonight for the first time. My husband is a big Tater Tot fan, and I can just imagine how kids would love this! I did as some reviewers suggested and put a (drained) can of green beans under the layer of beef. I also mixed the beef with the soup/milk mixture, and put the Tater Tots on top. I baked it for about 25 minutes, and then changed it to Broil and topped the dish with cheese. It was great! Definitely very different, but very fun. I bet it will be great tomorrow as well.

Family loved this!!!  As everyone else did, I added the soup to the ground beef.  I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken, I also used Tex Mex cheese instead of cheddar. Scrumptious!

My family thought this was just so-so.  Too much cheese, and it just needs something  more.  We added some canned green beans and it seemed to help, but something was still missing.

My family and I think this is great.  I did change the recipe a bit to fit my taste some.  I added corn to the bottom a few times and a few times I didnt not its good either way.  I sautaed the onions with some garlic before adding it with my beef.  Then added some more seasoning.  I also used potatoe coins and hash browns a few times just for a diffrent style.  I also mix my soup with my hamburger to get crunchier tots!  Its easy to have fun with and my kids love to help make it!  (sorry for any spelling errors!)

Quick and easy comfort food.  Okay as is, might try again with cheddar cheese soup, as suggested, possibly add diced tomatoes to the ground beef, and add a layer of veggies.

This was good considering how simple it was.  I did as other reviewers suggested, I added a layer of green beans on the bottom of the dish.  Turned out great.  It is not real often where you can have a one course meal.  :)

This was pretty good.  I added chopped garlic to the beef and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup.  Like others, I layered most of the cheese under the tots (I used Ore Ida Crispy Crowns) and sprinkled more on top.  Next time I'll leave the top cheeseless until about 10 minutes before it's done so the tots are crispy.  Great change of pace for ground beef -- thanks for the post!

I think this is a great recipe when you want to fix something fast and filling. I used almost 2 pounds of ground beef, which I browned up with some onion, salt and pepper to taste. To that I added about 3/4 pound of frozen green beans, 2 cans of mushroom soup, and 1/2 can of milk. Poured that mixture into a 13X9" glass pan, topped with some grated cheddar cheese, then arranged 3/4 or so of a 32oz bag tater tots on top. Baked for 40 min or so at 350 degrees. Yum!

I've been making this dish for a couple of years now and find it to be simple, tasty, and satisfying.  I took the suggestion of others and mixed the soup/milk in with the meat, added a layer of mixed frozen vegetables, and topped with tater tots and cheese.  Very much like a poor man's shepherd's pie.

I've made a few times, always turns out great.  I use the whole bag of tater tots, I mix half the tots into the soup mixture then pour them on top of the beef, then sprinkle the on rest of the tots.  This way you have both gooey and crispy tater tots.  I've also found that it works out better to add the cheese on top in the last ten minutes, so it doesn't burn.

DELICIOUS! So super easy. I did as suggested by others and mixed the soup/mix combo into the meat mixture instead of pouring it over top. Makes a HUGE difference. This is definitely something that will become a staple in our monthly menu.

My mom made this all the time when I was a kid, so I was glad to find it on here so I could share it with my boyfriend. As we try to eat healthy I used ground white meat turkey, used cream of chicken soup since he doesn't like mushroom, and spiced it up with some crushed red peppers, black pepper and garlic. It was alright, I might play with it a while since it was so FAST--by the time the oven was preheated, I literally had the meat cooked and everything ready to go in the oven, love that!

I used cream of celery, instead of the cream of mushroom and mexican blend of shredded cheese, but it still came out great!! I will definitely be making this dish again!

Very good!  I accidentally forgot the onion in the hamburger, and it still turned out yummy! I took others advice & mixed the milk, soup & 1/2 c cheese into the meat still in the skillet, then xferred it to the casserole dish. I also added frozen corn to the meat mixture & that was pretty tasty. After I topped it with tater tots, I generously sprinkled Lowrys seasoned salt.  Turned out Fab!

Oh my gosh, I HATED this. I thought it was way too salty. Maybe it was b/c I seasoned the meat with Adobo before puttin gin the onion mix. Next time, I'll leave out the onion mix, no way am I parting with my Adobo. I gave this three stars because even though my husband said it was so so, and I hated it, my kids LOVED IT!! Even my two yr. old! Go figure. Anyway, I definitely think I can work with this. I think I may try this with Grouper and red wine sauce, yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe alot. I grew up on it. Whenever my mother was too busy to cook dinner. This is what she made. However she would layer hamburger,a frozen bag of mixed vegetables,(carrot,green beens,corn) cream of chicken soup,tator tots.make sure you salt and pepper. I loved it then,and my family loves it now.

Yummy but the ground beef needed to be seasoned some more.  I added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  I used a whole bag of tator tots.  And I covered it in cheese.  Then I drizzled each serving with ketchup.  Yum!

I wasn't extremely impressed.  The flavor was bland.  I even tried to give it some kick with onion soup mix.  It is a good idea, and a quick recipe, just not for my taste buds again.

I made it with 2 lbs. meat.  I think any less than that would have been overpowered by the tater tots.  With the 2 lb. meat is was fabulous.  This recipe fed my family of 5 for 2 whole meals!  That doesn't happen very often.  Might try some variations like bacon swiss burger bake.  Hmmmm.

I agree with other reviewers that this is a "man meal".  I made it to use up some leftover hamburger and a bag of tater tots that had been in my freezer forever.  My husband had two huge portions.  I thought it was ok, but not something I would rush to make again.  It was very quick and easy though, so thanks!

This recipe was a big hit with my family! We all had seconds, which is rare, and my husband was crazy about it. 
The only thing I changed was instead of the milk I just used sour cream (we were out of milk) and it came out just fine.

Reading the reviews I had high hopes...but in all honesty I really just didn't care for it...it just wasn't anything fabulous at all..may as well just cook Hamburger Helper for dinner, that's sort of what it tasted like.

My kids love this recipe. The only thing I change is the order in which you put the inredients.
Meat first then just a little bit of onions for flavor, soup, tator tots  and then shredded cheese. Awesome because the tator tots get crispy not soggy. Sometimes we don't even put the cheese on just sprinkle with johnnys dock on top of tator tots.

What a great comfort food meal to make on a damp rainy day!  I added a can of sliced mushrooms along with reduced fat cream of mushroom soup, and low fat cheese.

Yummy ! Made this last night. My BF loved it. I added a little garlic powder to the meat/onion mix. Also, added 1 bad frozen mixed veggies (partially cooked) on top of meat. I used Sharp Cheddar Cheese. Will definitely make again. It's a great all-in-one meal.

I loved this dish!!! Very easy to make and it doesn't take long at all. I was reading other reviews on what changes other people made. I did season the meat with salt and pepper. I didn't use an onion and used garlic powder instead. It gave the meat a good taste that came out in the meal. Next time I might use cream of chicken or cream of celery like other users. The mushroom soup was great though. Thanks for sharing the recipe can't wait to try the left overs =)

not what I thought it was going to taste like.  I had a neighbor make something similar for me after I had a baby but this wasn't quite it.  Maybe I'll just ask her for the recipe. :)

This dish was so tasty! I was really looking forward to some good fattening winter comfort food and this fit the bill! I didn't have an onion so I sprinkled the ground beef with garlic powder. Very good and so easy, thanks for sharing.

I liked it...was hoping my 5 picky kids would like it. 2 didn't, 2 did, and I think the last was on the fence about it. I have the worst time trying to get something all likes :( Anyhoo, I did add about a tsp or so of cumin & coriander, about a tbs of garlic, pinch of salt, and a good few shakes of pepper to season my meat. I also used different cheeses...cheddar, jack, mozz, and a little bit of asiago. I will make again, but prb will be all for me I guess. It'll depend tho, on if it makes good leftovers. Thanks for the recipe!

It was really good the first time around but became really greasy when reheated. I will add veggies next time for a healthier meal.

Good kid friendly meal.  I double the soup as we like our casseroles a little on the creamy side.

This was a good basic quick meal.  I enjoyed it for its simplicity and comfort food level.  However, i think next time i may take a mexican twist and substitute a can of nacho cheese soup and add some rotel.

Being a purebread Norwegian from MN - I have been eating this "hot dish" since I was littlle!  I love it!  And so does my family.  I always add a can of corn and black olives and sometimes a can of mushrooms.  I add the cheese on top at the end and broil it until it the cheese bubbles.

I'm not sure what I thought I was getting, but this recipe didn't live up to all the rave reviews.  Though it wasn't bad, it actually looked and tasted like something one of my children would make on thier first try to make dinner for the family.  Nothing special, just okay.

Okay, this recipe is similar to one I had my 11yr. old daughter try as her 1st attempt with cooking a main dish  (very easy).  Instead, the ground beef mixture is spread evenly over the bottom (usually seasoned with garlic powder & Worcestershire sauce).  Next add either cream of tomato or cream of chicken soup; spread evenly over the top.  Next you layer on about 1 1/2cups of your choice of shredded cheeses (usually a blend works best).  Finish by topping the casserole with the tater tots -- they get crispier & browned this way.  Enjoy the time in the kitchen with your kids!!!

I made this recipe for some friends and it went over really well.  I'm one of those picky eaters so I didn't add the veggies (they belong on the side, not in the dish!)  I poured the soup (cream of chicken) and milk mixture over the meat and added the chicken late as others have suggested and it worked really well.  Of course I had to add a little Tony Chachere's (cajun seasoning) to meat.  That gave it a really great taste.  Next time I think I'll add a little oregeno and try it Italian.

This was really good- my hubby said it tasted like his favorite hamburger from his favorite restaurant.  I used cream of mushroom with garlic, added a can of mixed vegetables, a couple of Tbsp Ketchup.  Mixed it with the ground beef, and topped with potatoes O'brien that I had pan-fried first(hubby doesn't like tator tots)

This was one of the first things I made for my new beau & let me just say that it made one helluva impression! He has a voracious appetite & likes anything I make, but he absolutely raved over this casserole. I scaled it down a bit (very easy to adjust) & I used up partial bags of frozen green beans & corn. And of course, I added mushrooms. Next time I won't cover the tater tots with the sauce as many of you recommended. Thank you for the great recipe & thank you for scoring me some major points with my beau!

Maybe I did something wrong with this recipe, but it seemed rather thin and soupy to me.  The flavor was ok.  Maybe i will try it again with less soup and milk.

The kids ate it, which is an accomplishment in itself, but I thought it could have used more flavor.  If I make it again I'll add more spices.

My family loved this! I had read other reviews about seasoning the beef, so I also used a little garlic powder, worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper. VERY easy to make and reminded me of a shepards pie. I served with a veggie and some salad.. it was a great dinner!

This was really good and my kids loved it (teenagers).  Not too healthy which is why I gave it only 4 stars, but sometimes I have got to give in to their typical American tastes!  Real easy to make.  I ran the ground beef under hot water to eliminate the excess fat which doesn't affect the taste, and I used low sodium soup and lowfat cheddar.  Will make again.  Thanks

Until today, Tater Tot Casserole was NOT EVER considered an option, in my house!  The first time I tasted my sister-in-law served the casserole, the potatoes were still limp and partially frozen! I still have reservations, but it tasted better. I'll try it again, to trry to acquire the taste.

Pretty easy to make and tasted good.
Not a big fan of hamburger so I cut that amount in 1/2.

This was just okay.  As my husband said, "It is not a meal I need to have"

I mixed the beef, soup and milk together.  I also added some cheese to that mixture (which was a good thing!)  Do not think I will make again.

I have to say this dish was just OK.  I mixed the ground beef, soup and milk together to give the beef some moisture.  I added french style green beans on top of the ground beef mixture.  I added the tator tots on top, and I had to bake it for 50 minutes, because the tator tots were still cold when I took it out of the oven.

This seemed bland as I was making it, and it was in the one I followed the recipe for.  I made a mexican variation that was excellent.  Definately mix the soup with the meat and them put tator tots on or it gets really soggy! I used cream chicken soup because of a mushroom allery.  I think it might be good with cut up chicken?? may try that! easy easy easy and cheap too!

Not like this recipe needs another review, but I loved it.  I thought I was going to be able to say "That's soup, not sauce" but mixed together with the liberal garlic powder and Mrs. Dash I cook with, I had no idea.

Napoleon - gimme some of your tots!

really good.  Also tried with taco seasoning instead of soup, that was good too.  Also try, cream of broccoli soup and nacho cheese soup.  This is a good way to get the kids to eat something good for them.

Yummy! Reminds me of the type of meals I had as a child. Kind of bland though. I did add some frozen mixed veggies along with the tater tots to make it a bit more "wholesome"!!

I thought this recipe was quite yummy. I mixed the meat with the milk and soup, layered that on the bottom and added green beans on top of that. I used frozen tater tops on the top without sauce so they would remain crispy. I used low-fat cheese on the top for the last 15 minutes. It came out pretty good and I'd make it again.

I Love this recipe!!!! I don't use any onions in it at all and I sometimes add a can of ranch style bean. I also put a lot of chesse if you like chesse then what i do is after putting the tots in the pan then put a layer of chesse then put the meat over it and then put another layer of chesse on top. I don't do it every time but is it so good. Oh and i also sometimes change out the ground beef for turkey meat it taste just as good and sometimes better.

I wasn't particularly thrilled with this recipe; I thought the taste was rather bland and could definitely be spiced up a bit.  It's a good quick meal for when you're in a hurry, though!

I have made this recipe before-very similar but not the same.
I made it with golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I did sautee the onions and beef together but split the soup between the meat/onion layer and the tot layer so that some of the tots had the soup flavor.  We also used extra cheese in ours...but used monterry/chedder mixed.  Great group meal and leftovers.

good recipe.  I used frozen french fries instead of the tater tots.  I followed others advice and mixed the soup with the meat mixture. This also tasted great as a leftover.  My kids liked it and I will be making it again someday.

I'm just not a big fan of this casserole. My husband liked it though. Next time, I would not add green beans, but I would keep the can of corn. Overall, it was okay for a last minute meal when the family is hungry.

This recipe was not a big hit with my family.  I think we would have preferred it if the ground beef was in a tomato base, like with stuffed peppers or cabbage.

This recipe was excellent! I really liked how the ground beef tasted with the mushroom soup. I also followed y'all recomendation to not mix the soup with the tater tots, and of course they remained crunchy and good.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I took the advice and put the milk/soup mixture in with the beef, and added the cheese 10minutes before it was done.  I also added a little garlic to give a little exta flavor.  Good!

What can I say...you would think kids would like this recipe, but not mine.  They said they prefer Hamburger Helper! (Yuk!)  Well my husband and I liked it just fine.  We will make it again for just the two of us another time.

This was okay - I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and used more tater tots than it called for.  My family didn't care for it.

Well - how can you go wrong with this.  Though my picky eaters still didn't eat it - one complained about the onions...oh what is a mom to do!  One thing I did do was to broil at the end for a bit - made it a big more crunchy on top. Also put some green onion on top - which looked pretty and tasted good too. (by the way - I think Oreida is the only way to go for tater tots.)

My husband and kids liked this and my kids are picky eaters.  I added a little fresh cilantro and garlic based on other reviewers that said this was bland.  I served it with garlic toast and corn.

I like this recipe BUT to make it tastier, I make it a little differently than written.  I coat the beef in the soup mixture to keep it from being so dry.  I also prefer to use celery soup instead of mushroom because it gives it a better taste.  Prep and clean-up of the casserole dish after the fact are very quick and easy.

I'd go a little easier on the onion (or use a small one). I ended up using half an onion instead, and it turned out great.

Very good recipe.  We served this tonight to 15 seniors where I live.  Was enjoyed by all.  We have a Thur. night Cook 'N Eat meal where we bring ingredients for different casseroles. We prepare it and eat it.  It makes a fun time for seniors to visit & eat a good meal.

I made this for my grandsons and myself, we did not like it at all. The seven year old wouldn't eat it. I ate some and the nine year old said it wasn't too awful and ate some anyway. He hates to hurt my feelings. Well I tried it and I will try anything once. I thought the Tater Tot idea would appeal to them.

My two year old son and my husband both loved this!  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I had to sub with a jar of mushrooms and a can of cream of chicken soup.  Next time I am going to try mixing the soup and milk in with the meat and I won't put the cheese on until it is almost done cooking.

I made this for a party as a joke since it's a very midwestern recipe (i.e. tater tots and a hot dish) and that's where I am orignally from.  It got a very good response.  It's not my favorite but everyone got a kick out of it and enjoyed the dish.

Pretty good casserole and easy to prepare.  I added green pepper, onion, garlic, pepper and some seasoned salt to suit my family's tastes. I liked it well enough to have it again, but it is not something I would get a craving for.

Very kid friendly and easy to make! My toddler really loved it and ate it all up! DH didn't care for it too much as he thought it was a bit greasy for his liking but I thought it was pretty good and it was quick to make which makes it a good recipe to me!!! A friend of mine suggested to put french cut greenbeans in it as well and I'll try that the next time! Thanks so much Charlie!

Great simple recipe.  I followed the advice and mixed in the soup with the meat mixture.  I used a small can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I added minced garlic to the meat.  Also, when the meat was browned I added a couple of dashes of worcestershire and a couple of tablespoons of A1 steak sauce.  It was even better reheated for lunch the next day!

My family loved this.  My daughter, who dislikes anything with potatoes, even said "Hey, this is not bad."  My two sons also gave it a thumbs up, and my husband ate what was left the next day for lunch.  I am making it again tonight, I had to come back and reprint the recipe.  I misplaced the orginal.  :)

I thought this was a great dish.  My husband loved it.  My 4 yr old wouldn't touch it because of it's appearance.  My 12 yr old ate it up. I will make this again.  It was quick and easy to prepare.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very quick and easy to make, the kids like it pretty well.  No left overs. Tasted good.  Can use french fries in place of tater tots.  It's a good meal but not something to RAVE about.

Even my picky husband had seconds, and my 18 month old is still eating leftovers for breakfast this morning. This was delicious, I will make it again. I might add a little more beef, though, next time.

My husband only took a little bit, he didn't think he would like it.  But we both really liked this recipe.  My 7 year old daughter didn't.  I added to the ground meat to give it a little more flavor.  Overall, I will make it agian.

This was really good and easy to make, but the tater tots didn't cook thoroughly.  I will definitely make it again, but next time I might double the mushroom soup/milk layer to make sure the taters are completely coated.

This recipe was fantastic!  My kids loved it, and even my picky husband, who would have never tried it had I mentioned there were tator tots in it, loved it.  We've made it twice now, and the second time I doubled it - turned out great!  Thanks Charlie!

Very good.  I seasoned the meat quite a bit and didn't put quite as much cheese.  It was one of those dinners where you keep nibbling....Thanks.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  I had it in the past, and misplaced it when I moved.  Luckily, I found it here.  My daughter and boyfriend both love this one!  And it is so easy to prepare, makes time for doing the more enjoyable things in life =)

Good meal.  We have made it a few times since copying the recipe a few months ago.  It's not the BEST meal that I have ever had, but it's a nice meal when you're looking for something comforting.

This is pretty good.  It is not a fancy meal, but a good "stick to the ribs" type meal.  My daughter loved it, and my husband said, "I'm almost embarrased to say that I enjoyed a casserole with tater tots in it."  Easy to make and good to use those ingredients hanging around in the freezer and cupboard.

I printed this recipe off several months ago and have made it frequently since then- my husband and I love it!  Cream of onion soup also works well if you're out of mushroom- I discovered that just this week!  I also like to add chopped red and green peppers and onions when I have them in the house.  A great recipe!

I make this recipe for my husband at least twice a month because he loves it. I use sliced velveeta instead of shredded cheese, though. It is an easy recipe and tastes good reheated since my husband often takes it for lunch. Thanks for the great recipe!

Awful tasting.  I tried this recipe, and nobody in my family would touch it.  One smell and they went running for the frig to find an alternate meal.  Beef combined with cream of mushroom soup is the killer, it's almost inedible, has a bad aftertaste and the addition of tater tots makes matters worse.  If you'd like to try this recipe, I'd suggest a VERY small quantity so you don't waste eight bucks.  If it's appealing to ya, then fix a whole pan's worth.  I tried cream of cheese soup which was a bit better, but tater tots, mushroom cream and beef just don't mix, sorry.

I loved this dish and so did my fiancee who is a very picky eater. The only thing I changed the second time I cooked it is to add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and more cheese, then it turned out GREAT.

I think that it is pretty good, but I think that the next time I make it, I will put another layer of cheese in there somewhere.  Other than that, it is pretty tasty.

I think my expectations for this dish were a little too high. After reading the reviews I expected to love this.. It was okay, (I didn't dislike it) but it's not as good as the rave reviews made it out to be.

My husband, on the other hand, LOVED it. It's a very easy and inexpensive recipe to make.. I'll probably make it again on busy nights when I don't have a lot of time or energy.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I used Cream of Brocolli soup instead added a little minced garlic with the onion and some all purpose seasoning mix and some worchesire sauce.  THen I threw in some peas.  My family loved.  My husband even had a third helping.

My picky children loved this recipe.  I did cut down on the cheese content and I used extra lean ground beef.   I assembled dish the night before and that gave the potatoes time to thaw. I had Ore-Ida frozen"home-style" potatoes  on hand instead of Tater tots, and it came out very well, with potatos browning nicely on top of dish.   Thanks for this recipe.  I didn't grow up eating Tater Tot Hot dish in Texas, but I think it is a classic kid recipe. Sue Alice

Not as great as I thought the reviews made it sound but is still something I would make again.  My husband really liked it but my two sons didn't like it.  I added corn between the meat mixture and the tots and added the tots on top like recommended since we also like them crisy.  Good for something different to make and is super easy!!! :)

I used hashbrowns because I didn't have tater tots and added a dash of granulated garlic. My 3 year old loved it so much she asked for seconds.

This is a great recipe. You can put in mixed veggies or green beans after you brown the hamburger. My kid's don't like "chunks" of onion so I added onion powder instead!

This was a quick and easy recipe. When I make it again I will add fresh mushrooms. I also put the potatoes on top of the mixture rather than top it with the soup. My husband says this is a keeper.

Very good. I modified it a bit, and added the soup mixture over the meat instead of on top of tots(I like them crispy), and added the cheese to the top of the casserole the last five minutes of baking time. It turned out great!

My family LOVED this recipe!!!  So quick and easy. Very very tasty!! I have 4 children and a husband who loves meat and potatoes, and this is a sure way to satisfy all of them!!
