Great! I'm a little confused as to why the basil and arugula combo is called a 'sauce' in the title, since it's not at all saucy - but the flavor is perfect. Very clean and crisp. I added a little more lemon because I'm a lemon nut. Even my semi-picky 15yo loved this one (said "Good fish, Mom" more than once - which is a lot coming from him). Thank you, thank you!

I was just cooking for myself, so I used one .41-lb steak (about an inch thick) and halved everything else.  Instead of arugula, I had a spinach-arugula mixture and chopped that up.  Threw all of the "sauce" ingredients, including the chopped greens, into a little saucepan on the lowest setting while the fish cooked to meld them together a bit better and allow the flavors to open up.  I only flipped it once in the 15 minutes, as I would with a beef steak.  The result was fantastic.  I would do it exactly the same next time.

Too bland for my taste. The dominant flavor was the crushed garlic, which overwhelmed all the other ingredients.

Yes, as  a couple of other reviews commented, not sure why this is called sauce and not salad?!  I followed Katie Sue's suggestion and mixed the dressing in a small saucepan then added the greens and let it warm up and wilt a bit..on a hot summer day would just serve as a salad. I also served it on the side, as swordfish has such a lovely mild flavour I didn't want to "smother " it.  Enjoyed, will make again
