Good flavor, very simple but not enough sauce for serving with pasta.  We used boneless chicken breast cut in smaller portions, added fresh mushrooms , salt, pepper and left out the onions then simmered about 20-25 minutes until chicken was done and & sauce was thickening up.  We would do this again and double the sauce and perhaps toss in some asparagus.

Both my husband and I loved this dish. The only thing I did differently was to use my own cream of mushroom soup  and I baked  the dish covered at 350 for 45 mins and let it sit for 15 mins. instead of simmering this made for less reduction of the sauce.
