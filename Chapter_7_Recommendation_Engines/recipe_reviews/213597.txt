This is now a Holiday tradition in our family. You can top it with various things. My Canadian friend introduced us to this baked with a spoonful of dark brown sugar, chopped pecans and finished off with pure Maple syrup she brings me from Canada. Bubbly and oh so good!

Simple, elegant, and very tasty! I believe the nicer brie rounds will melt at 200, but the cheaper varieties need a higher heat.

Easy and yummy as promised.  I had to raise the oven temperature after 12 minutes at 200 not soft enough.  At 300 for an extra 3 minutes it was perfect. I tried two different bries--one the traditional french double creme and one a French triple creme!  The latter melted a bit too much but the former was perfect wtih the higher heat.   Tried it for a progressive dinner group and all raved.

Make this once for an appetizer at our Christmas family dinner and now I've had to bring it every year! Love it. I do add a couple Tbs of brown sugar on top and a few pats of butter. Served with various crackers.

Delicious....for a more intense maple experience bypass the light syrup and use Number 1 Medium....slightly darker but a lot more flavor. This is true of most uses of Maple Syrup....for some reason people think lighter is better and that is not always the case! And for baking do no be afraid to use dark grades.

I first tested a small wedge and did it in the microwave and I liked it very much but I tried making the rest of the brie in the oven and it turned out probably overdone.( chewy and stringy).....? Got to try it again.

Was liked by the family, but had to increase the heat and longer time for th be Brie to become softer/melted.  Found that two cups of maple syrup would be too sweet, but overall good.  Was inspired when my husband and I had it as an entree at the restaurant.  Some things are better homemade.

This is a simple yet delicious appetizer.  I made them in individual dishes so I estimated the amount of walnuts and maple syrup to top for each.  Also, I used Grade B maple syrup (personal preference) because it has a deeper, buttery flavor.

I made this without the walnuts and it was never-make-it-to-the-table delicious! My husband and I just shamefully stood over it dipping and dipping our French bread until we couldn't eat any more... it's very rich (in the best of ways).

This recipe is tasty and easy to make.  It works best in a dish that fits the brie well, though - with an awkwardly shaped dish, it comes out looking a little odd.

Excellent! Served it with warm crusty bread last time we had guests for dinner. It was a huge hit. Also had to raise the heat a bit and cook a few minutes longer.
