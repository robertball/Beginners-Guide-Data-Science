There is only two of us so I scaled way down and I also made a few changes so it is a little hard to rate this recipe. The one negative thing I am going to say is that 2 pounds of cheese is overkill if you are at all concerned about your calorie and sodium intake. With that being said, use your own leftover homemade chili as I did and you will be reducing some of that sodium. I used venison instead of beef in my chili so made mine a little leaner too. I did like the addition of olives. This is something I have never had in a frito pie. Tasty but I recommend keeping your portions small.

Made this last night before the hockey game. It was SUPER easy and delicious. I used 2 cans of Hormel chili and as much cheese as I wanted. One suggestion - season up the chili before you add it if you like a little kick. The chili was just a bit bland for me. Will know next time.

I have a version of this in the oven right now. I had made some chili a couple of days ago and had almost a quart left over so I thought this sounded good. I only had white corn chips but I used them, the black olives and cheese. I couldn't imagine using 2 pounds of cheese so I had an 8oz. package. It looks and smells awesome. Thank you for the recipe.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I've not followed it exactly but next time I will try your version.

I've been making this for years before it was a thing. Lol. Only difference is I don't add water. The chili and oil from the cheese is just the right amount of moisture, for me and the kids anyway.

I made this last week and my family loved it.  They keep asking me to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent receipt - definitely a keeper.  I had some shredded chicken and fresh corn which I added.  I halved the recipe and used almost 8 pz. of cheese.
