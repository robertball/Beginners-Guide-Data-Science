As a nice treat for myself, I had a couple of mixed apples to use and felt this recipe was fitting. I scaled the recipe down to make a 2 serving recipe to share with 2 of my children that would enjoy this as well as me. It was prefect. At 1st, I was not liking the mayo taste but that was before I chilled it in the frig for an hour. After chilling for the amount of time, the mayo flavor disappeared and a hint of cinnamon lingered as well as the flavor of the apples. I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, all with a side of bacon.

I omitted the cinammon and changed the dressing to 1/3 Hellman's mayo, 1/3 softened cream cheese, and 1/3 sour cream whipped altogether with just a small amount of Trevia (hubby is diabetic), plus added some canned pineapple bits.  No matter how much of this I make, there is never enough for left-overs!

I loved how this turned out.  I don't care for the mayo in other recipes, but the addition of the whipping cream was perfect! It tones down the mayo taste and the cinnamon adds just a hint of flavor, but doesn't overpower anything.  Nice.  Thank you for the recipe!

Loved this! Have tried several different recipes for Waldorf Salad and none measured up as this one. I used 3 different kinds of apples. Granny Smith, Gala & Red Delicious, unpeeled.  I also added a Red Pear, Red Grapes, few Marshmallows, Walnuts in place of Pecans. The Whipped Cream added so much to the Dressing! This is going to be a favorite of mine. Thanks for the recipe!

There was way too much dressing for the amount of fruit in this recipe and it was a flop at the function I brought it too. It tasted mostly like mayo. Would not recommend this recipe :(

There was way too much dressing in my opinion for the amount of apples. But my whipping cream didn't want to get firm so that may have been an issue.  It was just ok I thought.

I love the flavor of the dressing with the cinnamon but the ratio of dressing to apples is off, way too much dressing. Easy fix, I just added another apple and it was perfect.

This is amazing. Super decadent, but worth it. 
I didn't have grapes, but I had everything else and cantaloupe -- it was actually a fabulous substitution. I also used pecans (rather than more traditional walnuts) because of my husband's allergies. 
A must-have for picnic lunches!

I like this recipe for it's simplicity and refreshing flavours. The whipped cream makes it yummy. Next time I will skip the cinnamon & replace the mayonnaise with something lighter, maybe creme fraiche or light yogurt. I might also replace the lemon juice with pineapple. And I know it won't be Elise's Waldorf Salad.

A really good go-to Waldorf Salad.  I substituted the mayo with plain yogurt, decreased the whip cream. Also replaced the  sugar with Splenda & Honey. Definitely refrigerate 2 hours prior to serving.  The cinnamon was a hit.

I substituted honey instead of white sugar and added arugula to the mixture. Can also add some mixed spring greens if desired. Makes the recipe even healthier.

This is the first waldorf salad I've made.  I followed the recipe as given.  I used a little over 3/4's of the dressing and thought it was more than enough.  I added another apple, rib of celery and 1/2cup of low sugar craisins for color.  Overall I loved the salad. The dressing is creamy
