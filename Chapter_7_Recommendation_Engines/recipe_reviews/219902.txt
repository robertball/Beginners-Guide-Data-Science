i used like a ton of mayonnaise and it was still really soupy. I then added some corn starch which significantly helped the consistency.

The flavor was good but the consistency was awful. I used a full cup of mayonnaise and let it set in the fridge for 12 hours and it was still too "soupy" and there certainly was not enough for 6 servings. I would try it again with 1 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 tablespoon of water instead of 1 teaspoon.

I was looking for a dip to have on hand for snacking on raw veggies, this one fits the bill.  Extremely simple and fast to make.  Consistency was a bit weird after first mixing, but evens out after some time in the fridge. Lacks the rich creaminess of a dip with sour cream, but good nonetheless.
