Not bad. My husband loves it. I do not have buttermilk available where I live and substituted plain yogurt. It came out really moist. The cinnamon is too strong a flavor and takes away from the chocolatey goodness.

This is a GREAT tasting cake...however the cloves and cinnamon make it more like a spice cake.  The chocolate is virtually undetectable.  Not what you want if you're looking for a TRUE devils food cake.  Otherwise YUMM!!

The first time I made this, I forgot to put in the eggs.  Oops.  It made a huge mess in my oven and was a crumbly mess in the pan . . .although the crumbs were tasty.  I tried this again today and yep, you need the eggs.  ;)  Much better with them!  I did halve the spices and it does taste like devil's food to me.  I originally was going to make the frosting but after the debacle with the eggs I gave up, so I can't speak to that, but this is an easy from scratch devil's food cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions to a T and it took an hour to bake.  I would also suggest using half of the cin and cloves, the spices were to overpowering to be devilsfood cake


.  Otherwise, tasty.

This is a very good cake. It's very rich. I loved the icing and found putting it on hot to soak into the cake a plus for this recipe. I baked it in a bundt pan and actually served it in a deep dish pie plate to let the icing puddle in the middle and edges. I would have rated it a 5 if the cloves were less pronounced in the recipe. I plan to eliminate the cloves and cut the cinnamon in half next time I make it. My husband loves chocolate cake but I didn't get a single "yum" from him. I'm sure it was the cloves.
