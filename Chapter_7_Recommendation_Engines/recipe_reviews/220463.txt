I really enjoyed this for dinner and am so glad I gave it a try! Sicne it was not specified, I chose to use braeburn apples which I love for cooking. I did make a few minor changes. I had some carrots that were shredded and needed to be used, so I added them to the onion/apple sautee. Also, I used turkey italian sausage intead of traditional, because I prefer it. Since turkey has less fat, I needed to augment the droppings with a bit of chicken broth to get a gravy. I will definitely make this again!

This was really tasty!  I used chicken broth instead of water in the gravy, since we didn't have beef broth.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Next time, I think I'll go up to 1 1/2 or 2lbs of sausage, just because my family really likes meaty dishes.  Also, since everything is already cooked, and it doesn't really need to bake other than for browning the potatoes, I'll probably broil it in the oven, for about 5 minutes.  Very yummy dish, and definitely a keeper!

My guys really loved this one! I didn't use the apple because I didn't have any on hand, but will add it next time. I did saute some diced red pepper with the onions, and made the gravy with chicken broth because I didn't have any beef broth. But next time I make this I will be more prepared and make sure I have those items on hand. However... my guys were very happy (husband is Irish, lol) and were excited about taking the left overs for lunch the next day, so a 5 star recipe this is!! Thank you for this one, NikkHoff!

Made this using venison mild sausage.  I HATE venison, but trying to oblige the men in the house. Followed the recipe as written except made my mashed potatoes to my liking.  Excellent recipe! The men loved it, and I was just impressed with the sweet & savory combo.  Could hardly tell it was venison.

This is tasty :).   I did make a few tweaks....added peas and carrots, cooked  just about equal parts ground beef and sausage (beef being a little more) and for the gravy mix...used 1 cup Guinness with 1 cup water vs. the Stock.   As for the base of recipe, I especially liked how the onion and apple flavour complimented the sausage in the dish.  This was fantastic!  Hubbie loved it too.  This recipe is awesome - thank you :)

Followed exactly with the exception of topping.  I used sweet potato mash dusted with nutmeg.  Also beef stock in the gravy.  Subbed basil for oreganoâ€¦.not exactly "exactly" huh?  Love this dish! Thanks so much-

I really liked this recipe! I make beef shepherds pie often, so it was a really nice change of pace with the sausage and apples. It was very moist and had a wonderful flavor. I will be making this one again for sure.

This dish was excellent!  It was easy to prepare, and a crown pleaser.  I used chicken broth instead if the water, and used the instant garlic mashed potatoes.

LOVE this recipe! I was nervous about the apples/onion combo, but I'm so glad I decided to try it. The apples give the whole dish just a little bit of sweetness - its perfect. Very easy to make, and just as delicious as leftovers.
