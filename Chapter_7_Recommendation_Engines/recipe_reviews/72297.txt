This was a good recipe which I used to base my final dish on.  Stuffing chicken thighs is quite difficult, so I pounded the meat first to make thinner and easier to stuff.  I also added to the crab mixture, pine nuts, currants bacon and used wholmeal bread crumbs instead.  From a similar dish I had made before I combined 1 cup of sourcream with 1/2 tablespoon of paprika and poured over the chicken.  I baked in the oven uncovered for 40 minutes.  It was great.

I tried this recipe and as far as taste goes I would make it again.  I made a few changes and left my suggestions here to anyone to use.  The amount of bread cubes is too much for 6 chicken thighs unless they are very lage thighs.  Also the next time I think it would work better to use boneless/skinless breasts as it hard to contain the mixture in the thigh meat

The thighs I used were too small to hold in all the stuffing.  However, the stuffing was very tasty.  My family loved it.  I will definitely make this again, but I think I will use turkey or chicken cutlets.

An absolutely delicious meal. I took advice from another and punded the chicken and made it easier to roll. I added mushrooms but didn't add the sherry. Put in oven 175C for 50 min and served with rice mixed with bacon, peas, onion, soya sauce and some vegeta. HOne yr old loved it and husband loved it more. Thankyou for this one.

This was really  yummy.  We cooked them on our little charcoal grill; it was really hot when we put them on so they cooked in less time than called for.  I had 5 thighs, and I basically halved the stuffing, and it barely fit in; unless your chicken thighs are really large, you may want to make a bit less stuffing, esp since you don't want to waste any of that crab meat!

The flavor was good but I had a hard time cooking the chicken all of the way with out it becoming dry.  I did like the stuffing but did not add the crabmeat.  May have this again but not for along time.

I thought that this was just OK.  Nothing special.  I do think that it would be made significantly better with fresh crab instead of that from a can.  A note on the recipe - it call for garlic but doesn't mention when to use it.  I put it in toward the end of sweating the onion and celery.    Might try this again with fresh crab meat.

Used only 2 slices of light oatmeal bread. Next time will add some mushrooms to the stuffing. Definitely will make again.

WOW!!!  This is by far the best recipe!!  We did simplify it to make it quick and easy... I used prepared chicken stove top stuffing mixed with imitation crab and spooned it into the chicken thighs once pounded them.  Wrapped each one with one piece of uncooked bacon and cooked to perfection on the grill.  We served this over sauteed spinach and egg noodles.  Even taking shortcuts, you cannot go wrong with this recipe!

My boyfriend made this exactly as written in the oven. I made sugar snap peas with corn and curry rice for sides. Delicious! This chicken would go with almost anything.

I never use garlic salt.  I'd replace it with Garlic Powder.  Know what would make this PERFECT?  If you used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and wrapped them in bacon!  So I used stuffing mix instead of the bread and chicken broth instead of Sherry.  I used more broth, though, because stuffing mix is much dryer than the bread this recipe calls for.  I pounded my boneless, skinless thighs a bit and stuffed them with my stuffing and wrapped them in bacon and grilled them.  THAT was 5 star!

I used Becel light and skim milk and I baked it in the oven at 400F for 40 minutes and I used red wine instead of sherry (because I didn't have any!) it was really good!

I made them  because I had all the ingredients. I did pound out the chickens so there was room to add stuffing and roll them. I did add a splash of lemon pepper instead of just pepper. They needed a bit more "altitude time" so I left them in the high oven for 12 minutes and then 40 at the lower 350 temp. They were luscious, not dry at all. The stuffing was perfect. Now I  just might make it for guests. Thanks to all the helpful comments. Love it.
