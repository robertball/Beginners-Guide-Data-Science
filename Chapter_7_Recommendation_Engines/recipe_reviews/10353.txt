Excellent!  One of the best cookie recipies I've tried!  I did however use 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, as I think the more brown sugar you use, the more delicious the cookie!  I cooked them for a bit longer too, about 10-12 mins, as I like cookies crunchy7 on the outside and soft in the middle.

These are easily the best cookies I have ever tasted.  Try them 5 minutes out of the oven they are heavenly.  Also they are very good for a few days afterward not going stale.  However be sure to make 4 or 5 times what the recipe recommends as your friends and family will eat 4 or 5 at a time.

This recipe never fails to produce batch after batch of soft chewy cookies. I usually take them out a bit earlier to prevent burning. BTW, my siblings and parents can finish these cookies in less than one day! Thank you very much Rachel.

Very chewy, soft and moist whilst keeping a lovely shape.  Just be careful to keep an eye so they don't brown too much.

Definately tastey cookies.  I had to cook mine for 8 minutes, and they still turned out very soft and chewy (just the way I like them).  I suggest using 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 2, but that's purely personal choice.
Make sure you let them cool for at least 10 minutes before trying to remove them from your cookie sheet.
I will absolutely be using this recipe again!

Very tasty cookies!  They're a smidge dry, so I think I'm going to add some pecans or almonds to the recipe next time I make them.  But they taste fantastic dipped in coffee.

First off, these were not very good. Second, if you like non chexy chocolate chip cookies, you might want to do half the chocolate chips.

I found these cookies to be too sweet with far too many choc chips. 1 cup maybe 1 and 1/2 would have been better.  Definitely won't make them again.

I will confess upfront that I dropped much larger cookies than the tsp size dictated by the recipie and I used dark brown sugar.  Otherwise, I followed it to the letter. I did not care for these cookies.

I tried the recipe, cookies came out really yummy. I made small changes like 2 1/4 cup flour, only 1 egg and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate morsel and rest of the recipe is same. Baked for 11 minutes.          Chocolate Chip Cookies II  Your Rating: (more stars = better)   12345

The best chocolate chip recipe I've ever used! This come out soft and delicious! I bake them for 9 minutes, then let them set for about 5 before removing from the trays. They're great right out of the oven! Fun recipe to try different variations with as well - I've tried half chocolate chips, and half white chocolate chips, or peanut butter chips, or even Reese's Pieces, and they always come out great.

The Cookie That Saved Valentines Day!
I decided to make my hubby's favorite cookie for Vday.  The first batch (another recipe here) was just awful, but edible.  Not Vday quality or up to my standards, so these are for the neighborhood kids.  This batch however. . . . so perfect!  The only thing that didn't work as planned was the baking time.  Each round of cookies that went in the oven (even on dark pans) needed longer cooking times.  However for somebody who easily burns cookies (like myself!) this was a great 'oops'.  Thanks so much for this recipe and for saving my day;)

Okay!  Talk about not following directions... I used the 1 cup brown sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar ratio someone else suggested, but I made the butter too hot, so the chocolate chips melted even as I was pouring them in.  Not to be undone, I simply added chopped pecans to the mix, and stuck my first batch in the oven, only to realize I had forgotten the eggs!  I whipped up the eggs and added only part of it to what was left of the batter, and, lo and behold?  The best chocolate pecan cookies I have ever eaten!  Five stars, and I think I'll mess up on purpose next time I make these!  Perfect texture, perfect cookie!

I made these cookies and I found something was missing. I'm sure it was something I did but I can't figure out quite what. They were chewy and crumbly, so the texture was nice but the flavor just lacked. Good cookie, but not amazing.

Very moist and chewy, they are puffy, not flat (if you like flat crispy cookies this is not the recipe to use). The batter is not too sweet, the sweetness comes from the chips. I made the recipe exactly as is and will make them again. Thanks!

I love this recipe, I like to use different kinds of chips (my family loves butterscotch chips with white chocolate chips) and add walnuts to it!

I've replaced my own recipe with this one.

Mmmm, YUM! I loved this recipe! The cookies turned out nice, soft, and full (they didn't deflate and get flat). I Used mini semi-sweet chips in mine and they turned out fantastic. Thanks!!

I have made these a few times because they are simple. As a mom of a newborn, I suggest these to anyone who has limited time in the kitchen.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies that I personally have ever had.  The cookie itself has more of a shortbread texture, which I thought was really unique.  Most choc.chip cookies are pretty much all the same, but these were really different and really good!!  I thought they turned out better on a dark sheet pan and I had to cook them longer than the recipe said.

Really good recipe.. I made a few variations because we like flat-crunchy on the outside-gooey on the inside.. use 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, only use yolk or one of the eggs, and add 1 3/4 cups butter ..baked at 350 for aout 12-15 mins depending on the size of the cookies... golden brown = done.

Tasty, but they seemed to have a bit of a flat taste to me.  Then I realized that they have no salt in them, which probably accounts for it.  Next time, I'll add some salt.

I had to double the number of baking minutes, and I used shortening instead of butter. It tasted great! Other than my little tweaks, the recipe was awesome. The cookies came off the sheet easily and I would definitely recommend it to others!

This recipe is very good. I noticed before making them, however, that there was no salt! I added 1/2 tsp salt and baked them for 10-12 minutes and they turned out awesome! If it had salt originally i'd have given the recipe 5 stars. Very easy and delicious. Makes a whole lot of cookies!

There is a giant mistake in the baking times! Nothing will cook in 5 minutes! Try 11-13 min instead. Otherwise, an unremarkable cookie-needs salt also.

The flavor was a little off from a traditional choc. chip cookie, and the dough seemed thin, and after I got them out of the oven, they had spread quite a bit and were almost stuck to the pan. Over all an easy cookie to make, but I'll keep looking for the right one for me.

The good thing about this recipe: it guarantees that your chocolate chip cookies will not go flat in the oven. The end result looks much like the photograph; the cookies are pretty small and very puffy.  Unfortunately, I am so used to bad chocolate chip cookie recipes that I automatically added some extra flour into the mix, but I ended up regretting my decision; I don’t think the recipe was at fault for the fact that my batch came out really stiff and dry. I halved this recipe but it only made about 15 cookies. I also substituted walnuts for 1/4 of the chocolate chips, but I think the cookies would’ve been much better without them.

I made these cookies to take to a friend's house that had just had a baby. They received rave reviews and my friend wanted the recipe!  After reading the reviews, I changed the recipe to be 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar to make a gooey center.  I also put 3/4 cup choc chips and 3/4 butterscotch chips.  Great recipe!!

What a delicious cookie!  A great hit with my 5 yr old son :-)  Took the advice of others and only added 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  More than enough.  Other than that it is a wonderful cookie.  Will make again!  Thanks for sharing.

This cookies recipe, while not bad, isn't one I would make again. They seemed to be missing something and then I realized no salt was listed in the ingredients. This is completely personal but I feel having that hint of saltiness makes cookies taste so much better. Really, the truest test is what my family thinks and no one came back for a second cookie. Very rare in this household!

Made these for my son's playgroup and sadly only made one batch. They were devoured, and mainly from the mom's! I did manage to hide one away and ate it the next day, it was still yummy, not stale. Today we're trying M@M's!!

These cookies are very easy (I didn't even need a mixer to make them, just a spoon) and they stay nice and soft.  I didn't need 2 full cups of chips, though, and they took longer to bake than 5-7 minutes in my gas oven.  They're not too sweet.
I was a little worried to add the hot melted butter to the egg/sugar mixture for fear that the eggs would cook, so I let the butter cool for a few minutes after it melted.
Overall, a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Pretty good recipe, but i think next time I will use a little less baking soda, and will put them in for more time. I took them out at the suggested time and they were still not done, I had to double the time.

These cookies were absolutely delightful! Excellent flavour, I added a dash of cinnamon (but that's just me, great texture - soft in the middle and crisp edges. No need to buy cookie dough at the supermarket anymore.This recipie is a keeper!

I thought I rated these long ago I guess I was wrong. This has become my go-to chocolate chip recipe. Good as is or even with the butter creamed instead of melted. Only thing I do is chill the dough for a while before baking but I do that with most cookies.

This recipe is not bad. I made them tbsp size and they ended up being over 48 in total. I think next time I will use a tiny bit more flour. I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts I like this recipe with nuts better than without them...will make them again and see the outcome...they are crunchy on the outside and chewy inside...

LOVED this recipe! I have been looking for a great chocolate chip cookie recipe and I have found it! I did make some changes though... Lowered the temperature to 350 and added half TSP of baking powder so they could rise a little more, I also chilled the dough for 4 hours . Still isn't much of a change so I recommend this recipe :). I had to cut my three year old off after 3 cookies

I'm not sure why, but my batch turned out runny. I microwaved the butter on low to melt it, but I think these would have turned out better with just softened butter rather than melted. The flavor's good, the texture's just off.

What a great cookie!  They stayed nice and chewy even after a couple days.  I froze half the batter and they were just as good a couple weeks later.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe, my four year old son and I followed to the T and it came out so soft and ooey gooey.  A great cookie to make with kids, because it's hard to mess up being very straight forward and the results are so outrageously good!
