Complete decadence! My store did not have almond bark or confectioner's coating so I got white baking chips and followed the melting directions on the package (it calls for adding shortening to the chips when you melt them). My macadamia nuts were dry roasted and lightly salted. I didn't measure the orange zest, just used all from one whole orange. I've eaten three of these clusters and I don't want to stop!

These are definitely 5 stars.  My husband loved them and he is picky about sweet things.  I used the white chocolate chips in a 2 cup pyrex and microwaved them on 10% (lowest power) in 10-15 second bursts until they were melted.  Next time I will put the pyrex cup in warm water as I add the zest and nuts to keep the chocolate creamy.

These are so tasty and easy, what a nice addition to the holiday trays!  I really enjoyed them, and like you, I had to keep making more batches to take wherever I went.

These are so tasty!  One thing that no one mentioned is that the white chocolate will seize when you add the orange zest.  It has water in it, which seizes it.  At first I thought I did something wrong since no one mentioned this.  It worked out fine, as I just sort of used my hands to mold little candies instead of dropping them.  I drizzled them with dark chocolate for a nice presentation.  I made these for a party and they dissappeared.  I couldn't stop eating them myself.

To good. I don't want to share. I had some Almond Bark that I couldn't figure out what it was before so this recipe was helpful! lol. 
I think Cashews would work, too. (I didn't use any orange peel, though).

These are fabulous! I made them several years ago, then lost the recipe.  There wasn't much to them, so I improvised amounts and they came out the same. Make a lot of them, because they will go quickly!

These are just freaking easy and delicious.  Make a lot of them, as they disappear quickly.
