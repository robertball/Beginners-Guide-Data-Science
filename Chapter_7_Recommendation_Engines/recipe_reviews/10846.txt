Like shortbread cookies, butter cookies are made without baking powder or baking soda.  They are supposed to be a crunchy, buttery cookie.  Perhaps that is the reason for the previous reviewers problems with the recipe.

I think the submitter forgot to list the baking powder in the recipe. Anyhow, I caught the ommission and added a 1/2 tsp of baking powder (had to guess). After I baked the cookies (I upped the temp to 325), the pecan halves fell out. I haven't completely given up on this recipe, though. Next time I will crush the pecans and mix them into the dough. I will probably use 1/4 less flour, too.

I too did not have praline liqueur so I substituted Amereto and substituted almonds for the pecans.  These cookies are fabulous.  I will be making a triple batch next time because a double batch went so fast I could not store any.  Thank you for a new favorite  :)

I made these with leftover egg yolks and used amaretto liquer and almonds instead.  This adapted well to high altitude with minimal adjustments. Served with a Pinot Grigio and it paired wonderfully!

I had to improvise a little, but I still found these to be delicious.  Not having praline liqueur, I used peach schnapps.  I also noticed that the amount of baking powder was not listed, so I referred to a spritz recipe and used 1 tsp. I would caution about making the balls too big and crowding the cookie sheet.  Pressing the pecans in a bit kept them from falling out. Bake 20-22 minutes at 300 degrees.
