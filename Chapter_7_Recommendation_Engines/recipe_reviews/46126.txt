This is the best pasta I've ever made.  Better than most I've had at fancy restaurants.  One important thing that made it  good is that I used whole shrimp with heads and cooked them without peeling them.  This way, the roe in the head adds a really nice flavor, 10 times better than peeled shrimp.  I also only used about 2tbsp of butter instead half a cup.  Make sure you use the ripest tomato you can find and use the wine that you will drink with dinner instead of cheap table wine.  In my househould we rarely make the same recipe twice, but my husband has already asked me to make this again soon.

EXCELLENT! Would rate it a ten if I could! We used large frozen shrimp, organic spinach fettucine, and fresh tomatoes as well as the other ingredients as they were listed. Very quick to prepare. Reading the recipe I thought there might not be enough sauce, but there was plenty of nice (very rich) creamy cheese sauce. I was a little concerned about igniting the brandy since I have never done this before, but it was very safe and easy to do and I wouldn't want anyone to pass on this recipe because of this step. This dish tasted like something you would pay a lot for in a fine restaurant. Wonderful!! Thank you for the delicious and easy dish!

I will serve this easy and elegant dish again for dinner guests.  I combined scallops with the shrimp and also added fresh parsley.

This recipe is quick, and easy to prepare. It's also nice that it's made up of items that normally have in my kitchen. I did make a few adjustments. Didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used sun-dried tomatoes, with good results. Also had 1-1/2 #'s of shrimp so I increased the wine, and butter for more sauce. Served over linguine, but would imagine that it would taste great on it's own with sourdough bread to dip into the sauce.

Excellent pasta dish!  The combination of flavors are great.  We liked that it was a light sauce rather than a heavy cream laden sauce for a change.  I've made this many times.  Some changes I've made are using bowtie pasta.  The shape holds the sauce and mixes with the shrimp better.  Also I've mixed shrimp and scallops and it is equally great.

The iron chef himself would be impressed!  The delicant flavor of the shrimp with the hint of brandy is the perfect entree to impress others without slaving for hours in the kitchen.  It seems like some people are having problems with the shrimp preparation.  Just have it done ahead of time at the market!  This is definetly one of the best recipes of all time.

This was fantastic!  We used Thin Spaghetti instead of Fettucini. I served it at a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Easy, fun and dee-lish!
For the leftovers I had some asiago cheese in the fridge, so I added a few sprinkles.  Yum!
(one reviewer gave this a low rating because of "the time it took to de-vein the shrimp"...don't worry, you can buy them de-veined)

One thing that I love about recipes like this is that they are so infinitely customizable.  I love this recipe.  Usually when I make it, I have a few simple changes - I leave out the alcohol and I add some fresh lemon juice and about a teaspoon of capers at the end (the capers give the pasta a nice bit of saltiness).  Great recipe!

Made exactly as written and this is excellent.  Be sure to prep everything before you start cooking.  Also let the brandy evaporate a little before you light it or you will have huge flames shooting out of the pan!

Following the advice of previous submitters, (i.e. using de-veined "lazy" prawns, allowing the sauce to reduce before combining with the pasta) this dish turned out spectacularly for me.  I shall definitely make this one again!

This was a great recipe.  I also used frozen uncooked shrimp from Market Day and this saved a lot of time.  I made this for a dinner party and served it w/angel hair pasta that I pre-cooked.  It was a hit.

Thanks!

nice recipe but if you cook shrimp for 7 min total they are way overcooked and tough. I put the shrimp in for the last 2 min maximum for tender shrimp

I was looking for a quick shrimp/pasta dish.  This was easy and delicious.  It could easily be doubled for a large crowd.  Serve with crusty bread and dipping oil and salad.  Meal complete.

This is really good. I did everything as written only I used parmesan/romano cheese. DONT leave out the basil, soo good and accompanies the tomato flavor. You can taste the brandy and wine but it isnt overpowering. Might use 1.5 tsp salt instead of 2 thought because i thought it was a little much, but hardly noticable, still yummy! Thanks!!

It was decent.  I still overcooked the shrimp though.  Maybe igniting the shrimp right after I put it into the skillet instead of after I cooked it briefly on one side and flipped them.  I cut this recipe down to 3 servings and there was still way too much pasta so I would suggest cutting the amount of pasta at least in half unless you want to eat a plate of nothing but pasta.  I did not have fresh tomatoes so I added a drained can of diced tomatoes.

This dish is fantastic!  Perfect when you want to make a "fancy" dinner for guests. Some Bread, wine, vinaigrette salad and it's better than any restaurant meal.

OMG this was good.

A couple of things, the grocery store near my house didn't have fresh basil, so I was stuck with using 1/8 cup dried.

And, I accidentally (habit) crushed the garlic. And, one more thing, the box of fettucine I had was 1/2 way gone (of course I didn't realize this til it was too late) so I ended up with sauce laden pasta and shrimp. But man was it good. Try it, you'll like it.

Excellent, and even better the next day! It is a little too liquidy, but it tastes so good it doesn't matter. Also, my flambe barely flamed (I was having trouble getting the lighter to work), and it still was incredibly good, so I'm not sure the flambe is necessary.

Very, very good recipe.  Make this for guests and have all the ingredients prepped so they can watch.  The flaming of the brandy will make you look like a pro.  You must use fresh ingredients for restaurant quality ie. Shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and basil.  I was able to pick them right out of my garden other than the shrimp.  Next time I will add one or a combination of spinach, zucchini, sundried tomatoes, peppers.  Very versatile recipe.

This is a high end restaurant recipe!! Very, very good! My husband does not like tomatoes so I used fresh mushrooms instead. I put the garlic, salt, pepper, mushrooms in while sauteing the shrimp. I wanted the flavors to blend. Quick and fabulous!

Letting the sauce sit for a little will allow it to thicken sufficiently. Followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out beautifully.

And to echo another reviewer, don't be intimidated by the lighting of the brandy... it was much less fiery and difficult than I'd imagined.

A great recipe even though I didn't have all ingredients on. I excluded the shrimp and onions, used grape tomatoes, added a pinch of sugar, and it was delicious!

A simple but delicious recipe.  I added only 2 tbsps. of butter at the end as someone suggested, and it seemed to be enough.  Will be making again soon.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe and my 10 year old thought it was pretty cool seeing the pan on fire from the lit brandy too!!!  I will definately make this one again.  It was SO easy but I do agree with another reviewer-chop all ingredients ahead of time.  This recipe cooks fast-the longest wait is for the noodles to cook!  Thank you so much for submitting this!

This recipe was outstanding!!  I served it for some dinner guests who raved about it!  It is simple to make and does not take long to cook at all.  Personally, I added some flour to thicken the sauce.  TRY THIS RECIPE and BON APETITE!!

This recipe is awesome.  I did "tweak" it a bit.  I sauteed the green onion and garlic ahead of time with 4 slices of bacon in 1 T of Extra virgin olive oil.  When I was ready to cook, I cooked the shrimp in the other tablespoon of olive oil and then added the onion/garlic/bacon mixture, then the brandy and flamed it all together.  I also used sun dried tomatoes (not the ones in oil, I didn't have them on hand) that had been re-hydrated for 30 min in really not, but not boiling water, and then drained, and squeezed dry.  I prepared the rest of the recipe as called for in the directions.  My husband said it was good enough to serve to "company".

This was very good! After reading some reviews, it seemed like the shrimp needed less cook time. I sauteed the onion & garlic in the oil for a few min. then added the shrimp & brandy. Used sun-dried tomatoes. Turned out great!

Could have used less butter...  Probably half less.  Added 1/4 t. to 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper.  YUMMY!!!  Served with Barilla Plus pasta...

My date & I made this last night.  Incredible!!!  Have everything prepped before you start cooking.  I used whole wheat pasta & only 8 oz.  A can of tomatoes (1/2 drained - I saved the juice in case I wanted to add more). The two changes I would make is to remove the shrimp after the brandy has cooked off & return to the pan at the end.  I also would add the Parmesan to the finished plates, not while cooking. And 1/2 cup butter would have been overkill.  2 Tbs. is plenty.  Will definitely make again.

This meal was excellent, as one of the users said, like something you would have in a fancy restaurant. I didn't change any of the ingredients, however I did use frozen shrimp, already peeled. And igniting the brandy was fun. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love shrimp and I love pasta.  But you should never cook shrimp for more than two minutes tops.  This recipe yields tough shrimp.  I'll try this again, but I'll try to figure a way to dramatically cut the cooking time for the shrimp, while still imparting the garlic, brandy and onion flavors (maybe combining the cooked shrimp with the cooked tomatoes.)

I highly recommend this dish for a quick and delicious meal... ps- goes great with a little galrlic bread on the side ;)

I had to use frozen shrimp, 1/8 cup dried basil, and only used 1/4 cup butter but it was amazing.  I'll definately keep and use this recipe again.  Oh, I forgot to add the parmesan cheese until we were eating.  I liked it better without, some of my family liked it better with, so I suggest waiting and letting individuals add their own.

Very good, quick, and easy! I used sundried tomatoes and frozen shrimp. Everyone liked it and agreed the sundried tomatoes were a good choice. The only complaint was that they wanted more shrimp! This cooks very fast, have everything chopped & ready to throw in the pan!

So easy and delicious.  It really is just like a restaurant would prepare for you and charge you an arm and a leg.  I will definitely make this for company.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this recipe.  I didn't change a thing and it was perfect.

I want to like this recipe but I just can't. It was missing something so I was left unsatisfied after I ate it. My husband seemed to like it.  I had to remove the shrimp after they were cooked because I didn't want them to get tough.  I added the cooked shrimp back into the skillet after the wine and butter were added. Used 1/2 box noodles and 1/3 cup butter but kept everything else the same.

Really enjoyed this.  Like other reviewers, I thought the cooking time on the shrimp was a bit long so next time I'll take it out after the brandy step and add it back in towards the end.  I didn't do the whole stick of butter, just half.

This is a very good recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sauce was not enough for the amount of pasta called for,in my opinion. Next time I will increase liquid amounts and see if I get a little better result. I just came back from the grocery store with a new supply of shrimp,so we'll try it again! :)

This was not bad, but not great.  Made only minor changes to the recipe based upon product availability (no fresh-used canned tomatoes, 1/2 shrimp/1/2 scallops, 1/4 less butter), so I think I got a pretty true taste of this, and it's just too bland.  First thing Hubby said was it needed Essence, though S&P helped enough.  MAYBE I'll try again but will add some kick -- maybe spice, chopped yellow onion or red pepper, dash of lemon juice.

This was pretty good. i felt it needed a little bit more spice so i added a dash of red pepper flakes to it, but i didn't really notice them so maybe if i make this again ill add more. however my fiance wasn't impressed at all, he said it was good but i had better recipes so not to keep it.

I had some shrimp I wanted to use so I made sure I had everything called for to make this dish. The kitchen smelled wonderful while I was cooking and the meal was absolutely 1st class. I have been watching what I eat (trying to keep trim) but I blew it big time with this. My hubby and I ate the whole thing. (I know...) I didn't change a thing and will be not changing a thing in the future when we enjoy it again. Thanks Steve.

Sooo good! And fairly easy. I was a little confused because I thought the Brandy was going to "burn" while I cooked for 2 minutes, but it flamed and quickly died out. Love it, will definitely be making this again!

Yum! I put the shrimp (26/30 ct) in for just a few seconds before adding the onions and garlic; they cooked perfectly without that extra time. Didn't get much flame when I lit the brandy but I cut the recipe in half so maybe there just wasn't enough to flare up. Cut the butter in half and that was still plenty; will try reducing further next time. Just ate the leftovers for lunch, can't wait to make this again! So easy. As mentioned in another review, make sure all your prep work is done before you start because this goes really fast.

This recipe is so simple, yet truly delicious. I had a bottle of very dry rose wine already opened, so used that instead of the white wine. I would have given it 5 stars except that I found the shrimp a little tough; next tme I would probably give them a shorter cooking time.

We made this recipe on a whim tonight.  Craving shrimp.  Kids weren't home, so could indulge in wine in the dish.  This one met the requirements, with only a quick trip to the store.  Followed another reviewer's advice and used canned petite diced tomatoes, drained.  Made the sauce a little more runny, but we had crusty bread to soak it up.  Good recipe, but next time we'll make it with half the pepper.  Also, our store was out of green onions (!?), so we used a shallot.  Tasted great. Our favorite is the champagne shrimp, but we didn't have champagne and it's Sunday - no liquor sales here.  This recipe will be a good stand in.

Taste was good, but the cooking time seems to be a bit too long, so the shrimp were a little overdone, according to my family. Thanks!

Excellent! The only thing I did was reduce the butter to 2  tablespoons. It was very tasty. I payed close attention to the shrimp to keep from over cooking it.  We will do this one for guests. The cheese at the end gave it great consistency.

This was excellent! I was looking for a recipe using shrimp and basil as I had some of both that needed to be used up.  I had never "caught my food on fire" while preparing before, so it was fun when I lit the brandy on fire. :)  I was a little skeptical when I was ready to serve it as the sauce seemed so thin.  No worries - it was perfect and stuck to my pasta just fine.  My husband really loved it - he made many comments, all positive.  I used garlic parsley noodles and I believe that added some additional great flavor to this meal.  I will be making this again and probably for company!

This was pretty good, but left me wondering: was the flambé really necessary?  There was one shrimp that was slightly more brown when the fire died down, but otherwise I didn't notice a difference.  That said, it was pretty tasty and maybe a little bland.  Not sure if I'd make it again without some modifications, but I'm pretty proud of myself for flambéing for the first time without burning the house down.

OMG You have to try this recipe- It is AWESOME! We used a seafood mixture, cherry tomatoes and added asparagus to it . Cut the butter in half, thought it was going to be to juicy and over powered with basil, but WOW, could not believe how everything blended.

This was my first time lighting a meal on fire (on purpose). I made this exactly to recipe and it was easy and delicious. I didn't have brandy, so I bought an "airplane" bottle from the liquor store--only $1.50.

An OK meal. I didn't get any flavor off the brandy, not sure if its for show or actually supposed to give it some pizazz - I went with a recommendation from the liquor store so I thought it would work out all right. I tried to substitute a zero cal butter replacement to get a little leaner, but i think it didn't help the flavor any. I will stick with real butter if I make it again!

Very good.  Followed directions exactly.  The only thing I would do differently next time is have everything sliced, diced, chopped & ready to go because it was not easy trying to do it when the cooking time is not that long for this dish and you really do not want to overcook shrimp.  My eldest son enjoyed igniting the brandy (with my supervision)because it was just like how they do it at a Greek restaurant that we go to.  Thanks Steve

This was delicious.  It does take a bit of time to peel and devein 31-40 shrimp, but it was well worth it.  My only other gripe was that the brandy didn't light up when I put a flame to it, although I didn't have a match (I was using a lighter).  I took a full star off because it took so long to peel and devein the shrip... otherwise it would have been a 5-star meal.  The rest of the prep work is EASY!!  We will definitely have this again.

I found this recipe watery, underdone (veggies) with the shrimp overcooked. If I were to prepare it again I think I would saute the onions and garlic in butter until translucent. Add the wine and tomatoes and reduce. The sauce (IMO) needs to be thicker. In a separate fry pan,w/ the olive oil cook the shrimp until just pink then flame with the brandy.

Made this recipe the other night and it was amazing.  I cook a lot and needed to try something new, this will be made many more times.  I made it with Sea Scallops instead and I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes for some heat.  Truly delish!!!

Ladies, if you want your husband to cook, here is the recipe- what man doesn't like to play with fire? My husband loves making this. We usually sprinkle the Parmesan on top of individual servings. This seems  to work better for leftovers, as the Parmesan texture seems odd when reheated.

I have made this for several events, and am asked for the recipe every single time.  I follow the recipe exactly, but usually double it because so many people are typically invited to dinner.  They all love to see me ignite the shrimp after adding the brandy.  Thank you for providing this great crowd pleaser recipe!

Good flavor but, sauce was WAY too thin. The brandy also added very little flavor for the trouble it was to ignite.

Pretty good, but I thought the shrimp were a bit over cooked, so I sauted them with the onions and garlic seperately, then added them to the rest of the sauce with two minutes to go there.  I also thought a quarter cup of butter and Basil was far too much.  I halved those.  Other wise great taste!

A spectacular pasta that's full of flavor! Since the shrimp we buy in our area is always frozen, I drain the water out before adding the brandy.

Good dish. Make sure to quickly saute shrimp and remove. Add back in with the fresh basil and Parmesan. Otherwise you will have tough shrimp.

This is the firt time I felt it necessary to rate a recipe.  This was absolutely fantastic.  It tasted like something I would order at a restaurant!!  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect.  I chose large shrimp so they were easy to prepare.  I've never cooked with Brandy and was a bit hesitant to "ignite" it, however it was a very manageable flame.  I will definately make this again especially when I entertain.

Fantastic recipe. Found myself glancing suspiciously at my fellow diners to see if any of them looked likely to go for the leftovers in the pan! HOWEVER are you sure salt (2 tsp) and pepper (1tsp) amounts are correct? I only used half the salt as looked WAY too much when I eyeballed it. I DID use 1tsp pepper and it was slightly too much - I'll half both amounts in future.

I am not a pasta person and have been cooking for over 40 years and this had to be the best pasta dish I have ever tasted.  Did the recipe exact and did not change 1 thing. Can't wait to make it again and again and again. If you have more recipes Steve....post them.

Okay- I made this tonight for the first time. Followed the recipe exactly but used sun dried tomatoes soaked in olive oil and some of the white wine. Better than most restaurants by far. Every age group present loved it, even my husband who doesn't eat much pasta and usually refuses shrimp. 
Get the good dry wine, fresh Parmesan, fresh basil, and medium to large deveined shrimp as suggested. You will NOT regret it! And have everything ready when you start. There is not much time from starting the pasta to finished dish.

This recipe was awesome.... everyone loved it.  I tripled it so I had to play around with some of the measurements.  The only thing I changed was to add some sour cream at the end to thicken it up.  Excellent....

Superb recipe! I have had shrimp pasta at some of the best restaurants in Atlanta and this rivals any one of them for taste and presentation.
If you make this just as written, you will NOT be disappointed, but me, being me, I just have to tweek recipes to make them 'mine'.
So I often add things like sauted, sliced onions and bell peppers, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, etc.

I really liked this one though I had to doctor it up a bit due to lack of ingredients.  Instead of green onions, I sliced up 1/2 a brown onion (browned that prior to the shrimp) and I also used a can of diced tomatoes as opposed to fresh.  Good one.

Prepared this using frozen, deveined and peeled shrimp as a timesaver. Liked the flavor though I added more brandy. If I make it again, I would reduce the amount of oil and serve immediately. I had to reheat because my husband wasn't home yet and tasted like it lost something in the process. We all had to add additional cheese and black pepper as we ate.

Outstanding!!!  For those that thought the sauce was too thin; add a handful of semolina flour to the pasta water while boiling. That's a chef's trick that is used in high end establishments.  Reserve a 1/3 to 1/2 cup of this water and add to the saute process.  I would also add the shrimp when you add the tomatoes.  Cooking shrimp 7 total mins. is borderline for getting mushy shrimp.

The flavor is terrific!  Only gave 4 stars, though, because I only used half the amount of pasta, added an extra 1/4 cup of white wine and had just enough sauce.  With a whole pound of pasta, it would seem to be a little dry.

Thanks for a "keeper" recipe!  Dee-lish

Update: made this again tonight and I'd order this in a restaurant, definitely.  So good!

My husband thought this was delicious. The only changes I made was to cut the amount of green onions in half, and double the shrimp! We will definitely be making it many more times. Thank you for the recipe.

I'm not a fan of onion so I cut the amount of green onion to three.  I would also eliminate the salt - made the dish a little too salty for my taste.  Once I had everything ready it went really smoothly and tasted great.  I did take the shrimp out after cooking and then added them back in with the wine and butter so they wouldn't overcook.

Gourmet!  Made this last night and it was so simple!  My husband usually doesn't say much about my cooking except when it's something he does not like.  This dish , however, was a hit!  I made exactly as the recipe called for except I too added scallops as another review suggested. Super and will make again.  If you're looking for something different than the usual summer cuisine, try it!  I will make again!!

I liked this a lot. I did use linguini instead of fettucini because I think it would have been too doughy. I did not use the whole amount of butter and NO CHEESE. I don't care for it with seafood of any kind. All in all, a keeper.

Yummy.  The only change was using a mix of 3 cheeses instead of just Parmesan.

One of our favorite indulgences and it's so fun to light it on fire for everyone to see. I use more of everything except noodles and salt. We like it saucy around here.

This recipe has fabulous flavor. It doesn't LOOK like it when you see the ingredient list, but it's truly good. I adjusted some of the ingredient amounts after reading reviews, but still used every ingredient without substitution; so it's still 5 stars. These are the changes I made and WILL make next time I prepare this. 1) reduce the pasta to 8 ounces. The pasta to shrimp ratio is lopsided otherwise.  2) reduce the olive oil to 2 tbsp, which is plenty.  3) increase to THREE tomatoes  4) reduce butter to 2 tbsp  5) double the Parmesan cheese.  If you don't reduce the amount of olive oil and butter, you end up with this dish swimming in liquid. I like my pasta dishes not so wet, so the Parmesan can stick better. The Parmesan amount being doubled is just our preference - we like lots.

Amazing!  I was very impressed!  I will say I added a fresh chopped red pepper and mushrooms as I had them on hand.  I also used congnac as I didn't have brandy.

DELICIOUS!! I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit :)  I was really nervous to add the brandy to my shrimp and light in on fire.  I was picturing a huge flame.  When I did it however, the smallest blue flame danced around my pan and then it was done. I was so surprised! Served with garlic bread.  I also bought shrimp that was pre cooked and already peeled and deveined.  This took a lot of the guess work out for me! Love it!!!!

This was one of my boyfriend's favorite meals.  He even had the leftovers cold the next day, and said it was just as good, if not better that way.  He wants me to make it as a cold pasta salad for his camp-out with his buddies.  I added scallops and cut the butter by half, but otherwise made is according to the recipe. It was easy and quick.

I make a variation of this with a can of black olives (drained & sliced), more tomatoes (3 c total), more green onions (2 c total), clam juice (2 bottles), and another stick of butter... I think the clam juice really brings the flavors together!  :)
