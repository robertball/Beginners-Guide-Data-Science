This was delicious, and easy to make!  Unfortunately, I didn't have lemon peel, and although I added an extra two tablespoons of lemon juice, it was not quite as lemony as I would have liked...it had just a very mild lemon flavor.  I will use the peel next time.  However, it was still delicious, and my boyfriend loved it.  It was simple and tasty and I definitely be making it again.

I made these bars exactly as written-using the amounts of lemon listed.  I thought they were pretty good, but I could hardly taste the lemon flavor.  My family was mixed on the end result-some liked them and some did not.  One thing that surprised me was how little chocolate crust there was on the bottom.  You definately need to like cream cheese if you make these bars!

I found this recipe this morning while looking for something sweet to satisfy my pregnancy craving. I was going to be the first to review this recipe but Kim C. beat me to it. Her reveiw came in just as I had put it in the oven the second time and I wish I had seen it 2 seconds earlier. I also did not have lemon peel and only added the 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Next time I make this dish, I will add more lemon and hopefully have the lemon peel. I think the lemon peel would have been perfect. Realy, all it needed was a bit more lemon. It was definatly what I needed to satisfy my craving this morning. And my husband took it to work with him and shared it and everyone loved it.

This is a great, simple recipe with some modifications.  I always have a box of True Lemon and True Orange crystallized lemon and orange on hand ( all natural, no chemicals ).  I found this to be a perfect substitution for lemon peel.  I have personally always preferred orange and chocolate combination over lemon, so instead of lemon peel and lemon juice, I used orange juice concentrate and 5 packets of the True Orange ( of course orange peel can be used ).  I did not like the looks of the cake on top of the cream part, so instead I melted some choc chips.  2 oz of choc chips with 1 tablespoon triple sec liquer ( going with the whole choc orange theme ) in the microwave is perfect.  Microwave times will vary.  Drizzle over top of bars.

delicious and easy. the lemon zest does indeed make them plenty lemony. my issue was that my building had a fire alarm when they were halfway cooked, so the baking was interrupted and the texture wasn't as firm as it should've been. i'm hoping next time they'll be perfect! thanks for the recipe.
