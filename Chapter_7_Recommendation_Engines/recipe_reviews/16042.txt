This is an good recipe, but I thought it could use some additions.  I used a whole can of coconut milk rather than half and added sesame oil, fresh ginger, jalapeno pepper, fresh lime juice and cilantro, which turned good into extraordinary!!  Also, I did not put it in the oven. I browned the chicken really well (I used thighs and breasts)and then removed it from skillet to saute the vegetables. I added the chicken back with the vegetables and coconut milk and finished cooking it on top of the stove. I think I would cut the chicken in bite sized pieces the next time.  Serve over rice. Yummy!!

This dish is very tasty however, I would do some things differently next time.  Instead of adding 7 oz of coconut milk, I will use a full can to create more sauce.  Secondly, I didn't think it was necessary to bake it for 45 min., 10 min. was enough.  This dish taste great over a bed of rice.

This was a great change-up to our regular chicken dinners!  I had wanted to use something with coconut milk!  I also read the other reviews, and changed just a bit -- I sauted minced garlic in canola oil before adding the chicken to the pan - I also used red and orange peppers (out of green!) so this was great color! I also added crushed pineapple to the mix (when adding the coconut milk) and it was a great compliment to the coconut!  After the chicken and sauce cooked in the oven, I added sliced almonds to the top of the dish - they browned as the mixture cooked, and it was a great added touch! I also used Lawry's seasoning salt on the chicken as it cooked - it seemed to need a little salt for our taste!  Overall - a really great change of pace!  I served it over jasmine rice (sticky rice as the  kids call it!) Forgot to mention - we only used about  1/4 cup chopped onion - and the pineapple I added, was about 1/2 can crushed pineapple. No pepper flakes for this crew!

I made the  Caribbean coconut chicken this weekend  for 6 people and while
the sauce was really terrific the chicken breasts didn't absorb the sauce and were dry and tasteless.
 I think it should be prepared with chicken cutlets or legs instead of breasts or
certainly really pound the breasts thin first.

When cooking with coconut milk, you have to keep in mind that the longer it cooks, it will loose flavor and become greasy.  So I used to coconut milk as I would when preparing a Thai curry...use half to start and add the last half at right before its done.  That being said, the recipe was still a little bit bland for me.  Based on other suggestions, I ended up adding some lime juice and cilantro to punch it up a little.  That made the flavors a but more complex, but I was still hoping for something more.

My husband and I both really liked this and my house smelled wonderful! I made a lot of changes based on a lot of the other reviews. I marinated put black and red pepper,and garlic powder on each chicken breast then covered with 1 can of lite coconut milk for several hours.(next time I would cut the chicken up first instead of leaving the breast whole) browned the chicken then cut up into pieces- in another skillet I sauted green chiles and finely chopped ginger along with the onions and peppers.Then added brocolli and baby corn. once the chicken was browned I added the saute from the other skillet and added another can of lite coconut milk and about 1/2 c. pineapple juice.Added chopped cilantro and more red pepper (we like our food spicy!) let everything simmer for about 20 minutes.added cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit served over jasmine rice and topped with sliced almonds- it was a perfect sweet and spicy combination!

This has to be one of my very favourite recipes from this website.  I did take the advice of other reviewer's and used the whole can of coconut milk and after i transferred the chicken and peppers into the 9x13 i kept the sauce in the pan and thickened it slightly with some corn starch. I also rubbed the chicken with some roasted garlic and salt and pepper prior to browning the meat. The flavours were delicious and my company raved about it.  I will definately serve this again.

I cooked this for my hunny on V-day.  I def. didn't let it bake for 45min.  It was in the oven for about 25-30min and that was almost too long.  This was a great recipe for an exotic flavor.

This recipe was a little bland for my taste.  I added a few items to spruce it up.  I like the caribbean flare so I added some brown sugar, ginger, cilantro, pineapple, coconut, sliced almonds and some marachino cherries.  I also added some brocolli to it.  I didn't put it in the oven, I did it all stove top in a skillet.  I put it on brown rice.....EXCELLENT!!

First off, let me say I feel really bad about writing this.  However, I feel that this is what these reviews are intended for.  I found this recipe terrible!!  That’s really saying a lot for me.  My husband calls me “unusually unpicky”, meaning that I like practically everything I eat.  It was overly “peppery” and the coconut milk could not even be tasted.  My 8 year old asked if we were having enchiladas for dinner….that’s how overpowering the peppers were.  I will never make this again.

Delicious!  My husband who grew up in Hawaii raved.  I gave it 4 stars because it was not a hit with the kids and they ended up leaving it on their plates.  I also would watch the timing very carefully.  45 minutes was way too long.  My chicken was just right after 30 minutes...I could have even gone 25 and been fine.  Perhaps I fried it too long but in any case - be careful to check it often!

Good recipe.  Be sure to get the correct thing when buying coconut milk.  I bought Cream of Coconut near the coctail mixes.  It was thick, but way too sweet, overwhelming.  Will try it again with the right ingredient.  Served it with a Caribbean rice mix from the grocery.

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes! I made it a bit different last time though, and wanted to share. I marinated the chicken breast for a few hours (longer is better) in some coconut milk, olive oil, salt and cayenne. I made the sauce on the stovetop, using the entire can of coconut milk and extra red pepper flakes. Instead of baking everything in the oven, I grilled the chicken and then put the sauce over it.... and served it with some plain couscous. YUM!! My son, who does NOT like peppers, even loves this dish. I'm making it again tonite :)

I just finished making/eating this for the first time, and it is SO GOOD!!  Easy too.  I left out the red pepper because I didn't have any, but other than that didn't & wouldn't change a thing.  Made the Asian Coconut Rice found on this website to go with.  Thanks to Tia for sharing, and to her godmother for creating!

This tastes wonderful! The only thing that surprised me is that I expected the sauce to be thick. For me, it was runny. I garnished the chicken with a few spinkles of shredded coconut. We'll definitely have this again!

This was a hit.  My modifications are: use the whole can of coconut milk, only use one onion and one red bell pepper. I cook the chicken to just about done, remove, and then sautee the pepper onion and garlic in the chicken juices. I then cut up the chicken, and then add it back to the skillet with the coconut milk. Only bake in the oven for 10-15 min. I do this all in one big iron skillet so that I don't have to transfer to a casserole dish. Yummy yummy to my tummy. (serve over rice with salad.)

Not too coconut-y, just mellow and good.  Instead of adding the garlic I sprinkled the chicken liberally with Jerk seasoning before browning and then added more to the sauce.  I baked the chicken 15 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered, and when I checked it with a thermometer found that it was done a little sooner than the recipe instructs.

I took another reviewer's tip of adding a touch of brown sugar.  It made all the difference!  I cut my chicken into chunks and marinated a couple of hours in 1/2 can coconust milk.  I then cooked the chicken in the coconut milk and added the rest of the coconut milk when I added the veggies.  I simmered on the stovetop instead of baking in the oven.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because as is - it was just right for the kids.  Then when I served my bowl I added a little curry powder and the chili peppers.  On my second serving I added curry powder, chili peppers and 2tsp of peanut butter.  Then it tasted just like Massaman Curry!  I will definately be making this again and again!

Well, I took advice from others and tweaked the recipe a bit.  I cubed the chicken then marinated it in Lite Coconut Milk (I may try thr real stuff next time!), garlic, red pepper flakes, basil, salt, pepper & a dash of Asian hot sauce(in many grocery stores International Aisles)  Then an hour before cooking I squeezed some lime and added a tablespoon of crushed Pineapple.  Then I sauteed the onions and chicken, added Red Peppers & Mushrooms along with the remainder of coconut milk, a little more pineapple & a dash more of hot sauce(because I like it hot) then simmered on the stove till cooked.  Put it atop jasmine rice and topped with toasted almonds.  Husband liked it....said it was a nice "lite" dish. I, of, course, had to add MORE hot sauce and salt for some more flavor!  Pretty good though, will try again!

I fixed this for Mother's Day and was very dissapointed.  It was extremely watery and the onions completely overpowered the coconut milk.  I did let the chicken set in coconut milk for about 8hrs, but it still had little flavor.  I will not be making this again.  I only rated it 3 because my brother, who never goes back for seconds, got an extra helping, but he was the only one.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  I added toasted coconut before serving. I also used 6 pieces chicken breasts and there was plenty of sauce. Great over rice!!

I love this recipe! I add a whole can of coconut milk instead of half because the sauce is so amazing. I also season the chicken with some fresh ground pepper while it's cooking and then use cayenne pepper at the end to spice it up since I don't have red pepper flakes. This recipe is awesome, thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a great starting off point.  I didn't brown the chicken first instead I baked it at 300 degrees F for an hour . Like others said I thought it needed something so I added some curry powder and cumin and 2 minced garlic cloves.  I also didn't have red or green pepper so I left them out. I served it over jasmine rice and it was a very tasty weekday meal.

I have used this site for years but have never written a review before. I decided to do so now because this recipe was great and unfortunately received so much bad rap. I followed some advice from some previous reviewers and here's what I came up with to make a killer recipe: I sauteed one green bell pepper, 1/2 yellow onion, garlic and one tsp ginger until tender. Then I added an entire can of coconut milk and two cans of cooked chicken breast - drained, cubed (ghetto, I know but that's all I had on hand and was in too much of a hurry to thaw some chicken). While all was simmering I added about two tbsp of chopped cilantro and 1/4 cup of toasted coconut. Then added two tbsp of lime juice. Simmer about 5 minutes total and then mix in four chopped maraschino cherries and top with some toasted almond slivers. YUM! Only four stars because it's very white on a plate and looks boring!

I'm not a coconut fan, but something about this recipe looked really good. And for all intents and purposes, it was. I read about 30 reviews before I decided to make this, so I didn't make it exactly as written. I sauteed the garlic first, and added in a teaspoon of minced ginger. I cubed the chicken, cooked it in the garlic/ginger, added salt and pepper for additional flavor, then set it aside. I added one diced habenaro to the peppers and onions, and sauteed those as indicated. I added the juice of one lime with the veggies. From there, I added 14 oz of coconut milk and the chicken to the veggies. I simmered the dish on medium low for 20 minutes instead of baking. Right before serving, I thickened the sauce, and served it over rice. My wife, who is pregnant and extremely picky about flavors right now, loved it. I thought it needed a little more heat, and I had to add salt, which I expected since I didn't want to overpower my wife's taste buds. Overall, very tasty for a coconut dish. Add shredded coconut for a more robust flavor since coconut milk is very mild. This goes into the recipe book, but it's not a "make it every week" dish.

My husband and I thought this turned out...eh..."okay". We were really hoping of something with a coconut taste, but didn't taste it at all. Instead the dish was overwhelmed with the onion and peppers. I would suggest too that you add some cornstarch to thicken the "sauce", if that is something you like. It was more like a soup than anything else. And it was alot less Coconut Chicken and alot more Pepper Chicken. 
It was more time intensive that I usually do and because I didn't enjoy it all that much I won't be making it again.

Very yummy. Instead of green I used yellow pepper. Sometimes I find that green pepper can be a little sharp, and I wanted a smoother almost sweet flavour here. That's what I got. Very nice dish :)

I cut the chicken into strips and marinated it in coconut water that I got from a fresh coconut I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, during the last 20 mins of baking, I sprinkled freshly grated coconut and pineapple chuncks on top of the chicken.

Very yummy and "light".  Husband rated a 4 and said is a keeper.  I rate dish a 5 and will definitely fix again.  Surprising how the ingredients actually compliment each other!  Thanks, Nannie

I made "as is", except cooked on the stovetop instead of in the oven.  The flavors of the sauce were complex and interesting; however, the chicken seemed somewhat tasteless.  Since I like more intense flavors, I would make again using some more spices while browning the chicken.  Overall, an interesting and good dish!

I made this for dinner tonight and hubby and I both agree this is wonderful! I did make a couple of slight changes however.  I did not put this in the oven as I didn't see the benefit in doing so.  I cooked the chicken until nearly done then removed it from the pan. Next I sauteed the vegetables and garlic (used minced as I did not have any roasted) adding the chicken back in when the vegetables were translucent.  Last step was to add the entire can of coconut milk and seasonings then let simmer for 15 minutes.  I served this over jasmine rice and garnished with some sweetened flaked coconut.  The combination of the sweet and spicy was heaven.  I will definately make this dish again!

Very good!  We enjoyed this, although bf took a dim view of the veggies I used (I used a veggie mix that has peppers in it, but he's not always fond of peppers).  I have a Costco sized bag of breaded chicken breasts that I'm trying to use up, so instead of using skinless boneless chicken, I used those (close enough--only difference is they are already seasoned and breaded).  Since I used the breaded chicken, I didn't put it in the skillet at all, but cooked the veggies a bit in the skillet with the coconut milk and some flour to thicken, then poured the mixture over the chicken.  I added the remainder of the can after it baked for 45 minutes, turned off the oven and let it sit for another 15 minutes.  When I served this, I added some unsweetened coconut on top for garnish.  I love this!  The coconut milk is wonderful with the chicken and vegetables, and adding flour made it thick enough in the end for a slightly thick sauce.  I served over green rice, and it made the rice better. The veggies did get a tad too browned for my liking, so I might cover the dish next time.   Thanks for the recipe!

I did exactly what the recipe said with one modification. I just added some sliced mushrooms with the onions. The outcome was very good. I passed it on with friends and they loved it too.

The overall dish was good, but I couldn't get the sauce where I liked it. It was a little too bland. Maybe that was because I used light coconut milk.

The hot pepper added a nice flavour. The chicken got a little dry, so next time I would cook for slightly less time. I added a little extra coconut milk and served it over brown rice.

My boyfriend loved this and went back for  fourths. I cooked the chicken in pieces 1st and then added the red & green bell pepper and the onion. Then I added the coconut milk, salt, pepper, sugar, garlic, red pepper flakes and a little bit of cayenne pepper. Right before I poured it in the baking dish, I added crushed pineapple. It turned out very tasty and rather spicy too. I think I used too many red pepper flakes or too much cayenne pepper. Great dish, thanks for the recipe.

I was hoping this would have been better. I was really excited for coconut chicken but this wasn't that great. It wasn't horrible which is why I gave it a 3 but it was very watery and the coconut flavor was bland. Since chicken is so expensive I am going to chop the leftover chicken up and make a chicken salad or something.

What a great surprise! This was very tasty and I'm positive I'll be cooking this up again. There were a few tips that would have made this even better had I taken the time to read the other reviews.

This was delicious! My family says I can make this every week! I did have to improvise little. I was cooking something else in the oven at 350 degrees but for only 25-30 min so I added a bit of cornstarch mixed with water to the mixture while it was cooking on the stove to thicken it up a bit and then baked it with the other. Sprinkled it with toasted coconut and toasted pecans just before serving. YUM! I am thinking of some way to add some pineapple to it next time. That coconut flavor seems to want it. But it doesn't need it, it was wonderful. And easy. I will make this again.

did it all in my cast iron skillet start to finish but used lite coconut milk. It was pretty flavorful and I let it slow bake on 250 for a couple of hours for softer chicken.

2nd time we made this, wont be making it again, chopped the chicken and cooked it on the stove with yellow bell peppers and also let it marinate for 6hrs. Served over rice. If it wasnt for the yellow bell pepper it would have been really bland.

YUM! 
This meal was so different and so good! I added drained pineapple chunks and also made some toasted coconut that i sprinkled over before serving! This is a keeper recipe..just something different when you're not feeling like cooking anything 'typical'. Thanks for passing it along!

I really liked this, but I think I would marinate the chicken before cooking it to add more flavor and add more coconut milk. I did add a little pineapple juice to it and really liked it better than without.

This recipe is delicous!  Based on other reviews I made a few changes myself.  I cut the chicken in cubes first. Before I browned the chicken, I marinated it with basil leaves, onion & garlic powder.  I also used a whole can of coconut milk and more red chili flakes.  Before I put it in the oven I added more basil leaves for extra tasted.  We had it over a bed of white rice.  My husband and I really enjoyed it!  I'll definitely make it again!  THANKS!

Very unique flavor.  I loved it, but my husband doesn't like green peppers so he didn't care for it.  I will try it again eliminating the green peppers so he can enjoy it too.  I sprinkled toasted coconut over at time of serving.  Delicious!

Our family gave this mixed reviews. Grandad and one kid loved this, myself and one kid hated this. The only way I can describe it is to say, it tasted the way coco-butter / suntan lotion smells. Maybe I just don't like that much coconut milk, however I do love coconut.

This is really good, especially for a low sodium dish.  I have made it a couple times now, but it is better if you add a can of pineapple to it and some grated fresh ginger.

This was really good, but I made LOTS of changes.  I fried cut up chicken breasts (3 large) in oil and about 2 tsp garlic, minced.  I added fresh ground pepper and salt.  I added red and green chopped peppers, chopped red onion, and 1/16th tsp of cayenne pepper.  I cooked for about 2 minutes, added cinnamon, ginger, red pepper flakes, and all-spice.  Stirred and added half a can of coconut milk.  I let it cook for about 3-5 minutes, added the rest of the can of coconut milk, and lime juice.  If I had cilantro, I would have stirred that in too.  I ate it plain, but on rice or quinoa would be good.  I added a tablespoon of guacamole on top for garnish.  Yummy.  One of those throw-together recipes where you can really make it to your liking, which is nice!

Doubled the coconut milk and the flavor was good, but I thought that it needed alot of salt or it was too bland.  I added lime juice and fresh cilantro as well.  It still seemed to need a little something.  Will make again with some more variations and see if I can get it to 5 stars.

I pretty much followed the recipe except I didn't bake it in the oven, just cooked it on the stovestop. Next time I might add a basil leave or something for more flavoring because it seemed a bit bland. It was better the next day though!

This recipe was just OK for me..I grilled the chicken on the BBQ first and then poured the sauce over top.  The sauce just didn't seem to give a whole lot of flavor..but it smelled EXCELLENT..thats whey I'm giving three stars.

This is a little bland, but good. I use yellow and red peppers which makes the sauce an attractive orange. I also usually cut the breasts into thirds before cooking them.

This was terrific.  Reminds me exactly of a yellow curry dish from a thai restaurant.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I marinated the chicken in coconut milk for a few hours before cooking.  Next time I make it I will cut the chicken up into smaller pieces so they will be more flavorful.  I will also add some pineapple.  Excellent recipe, and a very welcome change.

I found this recipe to taste just a little bland even though there were peppers and coconut. It seemed to cook down the coconut flavor so that it was almost non-exsisting. My family didn't really like it.

I love it. Have to hear what my hubby says after work. I pretty much did what this other reviewer posted. I cut the chicken into pieces and marinated it in the cocunut cream along with, ginger, pepper,cummin,garlic for a day or so. I then followed the recepie and browned the chicken tossing it with the veggies and baked it on a tray for 20 min or so... absolutely delicious...
Oh, when browning the chicken, I added pineapple juice with chunks of pineapple.

A great dish to prepare for people who arent use to having different chicken. Only make sure that yo dont let the chicken sit in the oven over the time suggested cause the coconut juice will dry up..but still the best. Takes just like Churrascos Coconut Chicken

This is a very colorful dish, especially after adding fresh pineapple, cilantro, and lime juice.  I liked it pretty well, and will make it again, but I think I'll thicken the sauce, and either add jerk seasoning, as suggested by another reviewer, or 1/2 c or so of spicy peanut sauce (like would be used on a chicken satay).  Thanks, Tia.

Great recipe!!  The chicken was so moist and juicy.  The coconut milk helped to balance out the flavors so that the red pepper didn't overwhelm it.

I have been dying to make a dish with coconut milk, and I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed with the outcome of this one.  I guess I had high expectations after reading the reviews.  I expected more of an exotic flavor, and this was just kind of ordinary.  However, the chicken did turn out very tender and juicy.   I didn't even need a knife to cut it!  It tasted great....just not what I had in mind.

This is delicious.  I had 6 chicken breasts so I used a full can of coconut milk and increased the other ingredients slightly.  The only changes I made were to cut the breasts in half lengthwise and I baked them at 350 degrees for slightly under an hour.  I'll make this often as I think the recipe could be made with a lot of interesting variations.  Thanks, Tia.

This was wonderful!  I would follow the recipe exactly as it says here.  We have been making this twice a month for over a year and my husband and I absolutely love it!  It is our favorite dish.  Try adding more red pepper flakes if you like, and I always buy the expensive coconut milk (the kind you make pina coladas with) as the cheaper kind doesn't taste very good.

This recipe has the basics down, but is a bit bland for my family's tastes.  I modified it by adding some Penzey's Jerk Seasoning to the coconut milk, and it came out tasting delicious.  I served it with fried plantains, fruit salad and rice, and it made for an exotic slice of summer flavor in the middle of a drab winter.

The coconut milk makes for a unique taste but nothing that's overpowering.  Pretty easy to make.

This was really good. I doubled the sauce as recommended and was very glad I did. I also cut my chicken in chunks and sauted it. I ran out of time and didn't even bake it. We had it over jasmine rice and then passed toasted coconut and almond slices. Its a keeper!

Great in theory, not so great in practice.  Was I supposed to cut up the chicken breasts?  I think it may have turned out better that way.  Even with keeping it in the oven less time as suggested by other reviewers, the dish took longer to prepare than I expected with just ok results.  Could have more to do with my cooking skills than the actual recipe though...

My husband and guests loved it although I found it to be a little bland.  I used a whole can of coconut milk, and it really needed it.  I also ended up serving the left over pan juices on the side and that helped.  I would make it again.

This was really yummy!  I used PAM non-stick spray to brown the chicken and added a bit more of the red pepper flakes to increase the heat.  I also used light coconut milk, which worked wonderfully.  My boyfriend loved it too, thanks for the delicious recipe!!

Instead of the crushed red pepper I included about 2 teaspoons of fresh grated ginger and 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro.  It gave it a wonderful fresh flavor.  I also don't understand why this recipe suggests baking it for 45 minutes. I just stirred it all together on the stove top and let it cook down a bit before serving and it was great!  I served it over rice and my husband loved it.  He went back for seconds.  Not sure if kids would like the tropical flavors but I thought it was a wonderful new way to use chicken.  This one is definitely getting made again and again.
