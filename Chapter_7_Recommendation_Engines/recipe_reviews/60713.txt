This was good, but...
2 tablespoons of chipotle powder is WAY too much. At least for me, and I like spicy food. On top of that, I deviated from the recipe and only put in 1 1/2 T to start, and it was still WAY too spicy. Maybe it was the chipotle powder I used. Who knows? That said, in the future I'd start with maybe 1/2 tablespoon and let it sit overnight in the fridge, and then up by 1/8 teaspoon prior to serving, if you feel you absolutely have to. Also - I should've simply used a canned chipotle - mashed up well - and mixed with the other ingredients. I would've saved the $5.99 I spent for the overpriced chipotle powder in the spice aisle of the local Mega Mart. Canned chipotles are a lot cheaper, maybe $1.50/can. A tasty, interesting dip if you don't let too much heat kill the flavors. I can also see this being used a sauce for tacos; chicken, fish, etc. :)

My boyfriend really, really loves this dip. I have made this a few times and I always use canned chipotles in adobe sauce rather than chipotle powder. It's great with chips and veggies.

I was looking for a chipotle dip for sweet potato fries like I've had in restaurants, and this was just like it.I just omitted the lime juice and used tobassco chipotle sauce in place of powder(as powder was very pricey)and it was perfect!

Love the chipotle-lime combination.  I actually used 1 tbsp Chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce and it worked well.  Great veggie dip!

This was great and has some heat to it. So if you don't like it too spicy, I would cut down on the pepper powder or add gradually.

This was a great base combo of flavors. Due to some people w/ adversions to sour cream and mayo (how can you not like sour cream or mayo?) I substituted lowfat plain yogurt (placed in small strainer line w/ double layer of cheesecloth in fridge for couple hours to drain/thicken slightly), fresh lime juice and zest and a mashed canned chipotle in adobo w/ a lil' extra sauce, instead of the powder. It was a hit with all and lowfat!

Good but very not wow.  Didn't like the mayo-ish flavor in with this.

This recipes what great on waffles fries.  I got a little adventurous as I was making it and added a dash of paprika and about 5 shakes of chili powder.  Gave it a little extra kick.  It was an awesome change from ranch or ketchup on fries!  Definitely a keeper

I usually enjoy spicy things, but I felt that the chipotle powder in this was too much.  Also, there seemed to be something missing from it. The mayonnaise and sour cream mixture was so rich that I felt as if it needed something added to it.

This was so tasty! We served it with tortilla chips and veggies. I think it would be great to mix with refried beans, cheese, avocado, etc. as a layered dip. I used Chipotle hot sauce, but only used 1 tsp. and it had a great flavor.

Definitely too much chipotle pepper powder in this recipe! I love spicy food and based on other reviews, I only used 1 tbs of chipotle powder and it was still quite spicy. 1/2 tbs probably would have been enough. Other than that, it's a good dip.

Great dip with a real southwest kick!  You can definitely adjust the amount of chili powder to suit your taste.  Fantastic dip with veggies!

Great dip and super simple to make!  Definitely cut back the chipotle powder to a half a tablespoon.  Otherwise a very good dip.  Amazing with sweet potato fries or even on burgers!

I scaled this down to make just one cup and left everything the same until I realized I didn't have any chipotle powder so I used the adobo sauce from a can of chipotle peppers and some smoked paprika.  Love at first bite!

This stuff was amazing. I added honey to this recipe and it sent it over the top to 5 stars. Mixed it with a taco salad, but it's so versatile it could go with anything. On tacos, burritos, salad, or layered bean dip. I will definitely make it again. Thx!!!
