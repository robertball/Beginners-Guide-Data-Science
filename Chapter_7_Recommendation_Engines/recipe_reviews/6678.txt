As with the starter, I was prepared to give my first low star review but it gets 5 stars with an OMG attached to it!!!  This bread is amazing. I made just as directed, no changes what so ever. Yeah it takes awhile to make but this is how good bread is made.  It is the first time in YEARS I have made bread without the machine and I am so glad I took the plunge!!  It's not super sour but I have family members that are really into sour so it is perfect for this household. I have NEVER made bread without yeast, even bread made with a starter and was expecting a flat, dense loaf. What I got was a beautiful, light, fluffy and extremely flavorful bread that the family is already asking me to make more of.  Thank goodness this makes 2 loaves cause the first one was demolished 5 minutes after taking it out of the oven.  Try it, it is amazing and like I said...it may take awhile to make but all good things are worth waiting for. Use Beckys potato starter with this, you won't be sorry!!!

I would like to know what I did wrong.  After leaving all night I had to add flour to be able to knead.  Then the dough never raised again.  I had to throw it away.  Any suggestions??

Most people say that this kind of bread takes soooo long to make, but actually it takes no longer than other bread, you just have to spread your activities out over 2 days instead of a solid half an hour.  No matter what, it is worth it!  I used to make this bread, then I got wimpy and started using the bread machine, but now I'm back, because there is no substitute for this bread!  The only suggestions I would make is to let your bread rise both times in a very warm place, and I omit the sifting of the flour (but that's a personal thing I guess).  Your bread will get rave reviews, especially if they can smell it when it's baking and taste it hot out of the oven!!!!

I have made many a loaves of bread, and have tried several from my starter (not from the same person).  This recipe worked up fine.  It is sweeter than I like, not sour at all and honestly quite bland, but makes a great loaf of white sandwich bread from your starter.  I was concerned since it browned awfully fast and tapped hollow at 30 min, so I took it out tested it and and it really needed more time.  Reluctantly, I put it back in for the rest of the time and thankfully it gets very brown but not an overly thick crust.  I am making this again tonight, but will cut the sugar, even more and substitute 3 cups whole wheat.  Tip to those new to bread making, just use a knife to divide into 2 loaves and it is very important to give it a warm place to rise overnight.  The yeast needs that.  Also I let my starter sit out and get to room temperature all day then make the dough at night.  Good Luck!

If you follow the directions, this bread turns out beautifully.  The second time I made it, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, which made it just about perfect.

Please ignore the reviews by people who failed to follow the recipe (ie, using Herman starter), or those reviewers who are unhappy with their starter.  If you use a good, proven starter, you will love this bread.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This bread turned out WONDERFUL! I admit I was actually a little bit nervous about how it would turn out. I didn't have bread flour, so I simply used allpurpose flour. I also didn't have corn oil, and used vegetable oil instead. It was so light and fluffy and moist. I will say, however, that your bread is only as good as your starter. I used the starter by the same cook, Becky Richardson, that has potato flakes rather than flour. It was WELL worth the wait for this bread! Wonderful for sandwiches as well as toast in the morning. Keep it in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic, or in a plastic zipper bag, and it will keep longer. It doesn't have preservatives, so the shelf life isn't all that long. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!

I had the same problem as a previous reviewer: after rising initially, the dough needed lots of flour (was like a batter) and did not rise a second time.

Thanks Becky! Yes it is easy and even the most novice of novice can make a wonderful loaf of bread from it. I used this recipe for years and finally neglected it unto the point of death. I have actually been asked to make rolls from this starter for our Senior Citizens' Banquets. I was given another start of it and will be using it again. I have made cinnamon rolls, whole wheat bread by substituting 1-2 cups of Hodgson's Mill Whole Wheat flour for the bread flour, and calazone loaves using ham, cheese, sweet green peppers and onions.  It is so versitile and delicious. Most of all it is easy!

I am absolutely ecstatic! I thought I would never be able to make real bread (after some disastrous inedible tree branches in the past from other recipes) until I baked this one today! It's delicious, flavorful, and it's real bread! (Yes, I'm excited!) I will make this from now on. No more using my bread machine as a crutch. This was easy. I can't wait to experiment with different loaf shapes. I used olive oil instead of corn oil, and I started in the morning, let it rise all day, then did the second kneading that night, and let it rise overnight and baked it in the morning. It might sound silly, but the confidence this recipe gave me could be life changing! I am thrilled!

It is definitely important to let this rise overnight, it makes a lot of bread so you might want to half the recipe.

I used this recipe with the "Herman" sourdough starter and it was wonderful. I've given this bread away and everyone wants the recipe. I tried making the san francisco bread with the herman sourdough and it was good, but actually a little too sweet this recipe was perfect

Tasted the raw dough & it seemed awful sweet, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly to get something that would be a bit better.  I noticed that someone suggested giving the bread a warm place to rise overnight, which will only result in overproofing.  Warmth speeds the yeast's activity, accelerating fermentation.  Warm proofing should only be used when you want to bake the bread after proofing for only an hour or so.  For the best flavour, you want to allow for a slow, long fermentation process, so it is actually ideal to proof the bread overnight (or even a little longer, if possible) in the refrigerator.  As long as the temperature is above freezing, the yeast will keep eating, but they will eat slower, allowing for a greater buildup of the byproducts of fermentation, which gives good bread its flavour.

The recipe I use with the Potato Flake starter fed with 3/4 cup sugar, 3 heaping T. potato flakes, and 1 cup warm water uses the same as this except 2 tsp. salt, 1/4 cup sugar, & 1/3 cup oil.  I use canola oil.  For 100% whole wheat bread, use 1 1/2 cups starter and 1 cup warm water for the 6 cups whole wheat flour. Omit the sugar in the bread recipe for less sweet dough.  Add vinegar to make it more sour.  Sometimes I use 1 small pkg. Jell-o Island Pineapple dry mix instead of the sugar to make a "Hawaiian" Bread dough for loaves, buns, or cinnamon rolls.   Vary flavor using different oils.  Olive oil and Italian seasoning makes Italian bread flavor.  You can use the dough after first rising to make thin crust pizza.  Punch it down, roll thin, place on sprayed pan, and par-bake on preheated pizza stone.  Top & bake at once or freeze then top & bake later.  For thick crust, let rise to desired size; top; bake on preheated pizza stone.   Since the dough sits for 12 hour periods of time during rising, I don't use perishable products in it like eggs, milk, or fresh foods.  I use dried mixes, herbs & spices, dried fruits, etc. that impart their flavors.  I use Pyrex glass loaf pans and bake @ 350°.  My loaves (3 per batch) bake in 28 minutes.    It freezes well, but lasts a long time on the counter.  I don't knead the dough but 20-25 times after mixing.  Each portion has 8 - 12 hours between.  Feed, 8-12 hrs sit; Mix, 8-12 hrs sit; Shape, 8-12 hrs sit; Bake. Enjoy!

I've been using this recipe for awhile now & it's excellent.  I use Becky's "Sourdough Starter I", all purpose flour and canola oil.  I mix everything but the flour in a large bowl with a wooden spoon (adding the last cup of flour gradually -you may need a little more or less) and then I mix it a couple of minutes by hand until it is a nice consistency.  I leave mine slightly sticky.  I've gotten lazy & I never do the 10 minute knead anymore.  I just deflate it & shape it a little to fit my pan & it comes out great!  For the 2nd rise, I always leave the bread in the oven, uncovered so that I don't deflate it taking the cover off.  I used to only make yeast bread so when I first made this, I was unaware of the very LONG RISE TIME.  Plan on anywhere from 5-7 hours for your second rise.  I bake it 40 minutes & it's always perfect.  This bread does NOT have the typical sour sourdough flavor so if that's what you're looking for, this is not for you.  It is delicious though but expect a hint of sweetness.  We love it toasted and buttered!  Even my picky husband loves the flavor!  Thank you Becky!

This has been a family favorite for YEARS in my household.  I never have a problem with rising and here's a secret:  I bought a heater for seedlings at a nursery.  It lies very flat and is intended to mimic the warm soil of spring, to give the seedlings a head start.  I use it to raise my bread and starters, because my house tends to be drafty sometimes.  Works great!  Another type of heater that works great is the kind meant to stick to the bottom of a terrarium, for reptiles.  You can use either heater to make a little "proofing box" for your breads and starters.  (My oven doesn’t have a pilot light; if it did, that would be the perfect proofing box.)

Here’s my favorite recipe for this bread:
Pepper-cheese bread:  When combining ingredients for bread add about 1-2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper.  Let rise 12 hours then add 2 cups grated cheese.  Knead cheese in well, divide into two loaves for second rising and proceed as for plain bread.

Love this recipe!  The rise overnight needs to be about 12+ hours...and the second rise time is very long also 4+ hours depending on how warm your kitchen is.  This bread is definately worth the wait...and other than a few minutes of mixing and 10 minutes of kneading - the rest of the time length of this recipe is waiting.  I even left my house to run errands while the bread was doing it's second rise.  Love this recipe & so does the family!  Only modification I made was cut the amount of sugar in half :)

I read the reviews on this bread before attempting to make it.  I followed the recipe, except I substituted 2 cups of white whole wheat flour for 2 cups of the bread flour.  I kneaded the dough for about 5 minutes in the mixer before letting it rise for the first time.  Then I let it sit in the oven with the oven light on for warmth overnight.  The dough was a little sticky but not unmanageable.  I probably kneaded another 1/4 to 1/3 cup of flour in before dividing the dough.  I put them into 9x5 pans and they rose very well.  This bread slices well and has a nice crumb.  It is a little on the sweet side, so I think the next time I make it, I will cut back on the sugar some.  We've made BLTS, grilled cheeses, and more with this bread.  It's very good.

I am a newbie to breadmaking- I have made about a dozen loaves of a simple Amish white bread found elsewhere on this site, with good results, learning from each loaf. As an example of what I've learned, I moved from disposable aluminum foil pans to glass, and now to cast iron (cast iron being a fascination of mine). I've been wanting to try a sourdough for a year and finally got the guts to try making my own starter two weeks ago. Having a healthy sponge, I needed a recipe- didn't realize that till I had already started getting everthing out of my cabinets to make bread Saturday morning. I downloaded the allrecipes Android app and looked up a basic sourdough bread- landing here. 
It's now Sunday morning and I've just taken the bread out of the oven. It is AMAZING!! A touch of sourness to it, definitely a different smell as it cooked, but definitely a very yummy smell. One thing to note for you new bakers- don't do like I did, start at 2pm then have to stay up till 3am because the dough's rising faster than you expected (but don't expect it to rise at all quickly, either). I ended up sectioning the dough into pans at 3am, and then left them to rise while I slept- ended up with excess dough on the counter. That turned out fine, though- olive oil on a piece of aluminum foil and in the oven it went, giving me something to munch on while I waited for the bread to cool. I now have two beautiful loaves of artisan bread on a plate, and have to fight off the family to not dig in!

This was delicious bread, but not the San Fransisco type some are looking for.  This makes a really great sweet bread for many different uses.  I am an avid bread baker and love the way this turns out.  Wonderful texture and flavor.  I use it to make cinnamon rolls, french toast and cinnamon raisin bread.  It is definitely worth the wait time for this bread!  Make sure you use the sourdough starter submitted by this same lady (Becky Richardson)!!  I also cut down the oil to 1/4 C because 1/2 is really a lot for a bread recipe!

I love the recipe when it comes out right but I've only had that happen oncein the past 9 months. It seems to be very sticky. Any help out there? Do I need to add more flour?

A friend gave me a loaf, then she gave me the starter.....I was nervous but it turned out just like hers. Her recipe is the same as this BUT only
1/3 c. of sugar. This is a very sweet dough ! Excellect flavor,great to work with and keeps well
in plastic bag in or out of the freezer.  I have also rolled the dough (after the 1st rise) into a round pizza pan......   after the 2nd rise, 5hr. or so later....I baked my pizza crust  350  till lt. brown 20 -25 min.  Allow to cool and spread pizza sauce ( found the recipe here!)cheese & toppings ......Bake 400 till browned .....note 
I always use parchment paper under my doughs for easy removal & clean up....My family "LOVED" the pizza....Next I'll make cinn rolls....All I know is you have to follow the directions fully.

I used Sourdough Starter I by Becky Richardson to make this bread. It overflowed the bowl it was in while rising the first time overnight, but thankfully, I had set the bowl on a cookie sheet. The next morning, I scooped up the overflow and incorporated it into the mixture and kneaded it. I wore gloves while I kneaded the bread, and yes, it was sticky, but I didn't add any extra flour to the mixture other than what was on the board underneath. I kept wondering the entire time if it would turn out, or if all this time and energy were for nothing. It took quite a while for the second rise in the loaf pans, but I finally decided to bake it, and it turned out great. I don't care for a really sour bread, so this one is perfect for me. So glad I have more starter in the frig waiting to be fed and made into more bread!

I had only tried making my own starter a week ago with just wheat flour and water (following internet instructions) and didn't think it would work but it did.  Then after a week I wanted to make bread and found this recipe.  I've made bread with my starter and this recipe three times now.  All times were successful - this recipe makes lovely bread. The crumb looks just like grocery bread - so professional looking!

The only thing I would suggest to newbies is that the six cups bread flour is approximate.  The instructions aren't terribly clear but you're to add flour and mix until a dough forms easily.  You shouldn't be adding lots of flour after the first rise.  
If your starter is strong (doubles easily in 6-10 hours) then you should not have problem with it rising when it comes to this recipe.
I had a very strong sourdough taste because I let my bread rise 12 hours the first rise it "ate" up the 1/2 cup sugar and I ended up with sourdough bread and it was not too sweet at all.

Btw, the suggestion of starting this recipe at night is a good one.  It gives the dough time to rise while you sleep.  I start it about 7 or 9pm at night.

This is an amazing bread. I highly suggest using Becky's sourdough starter that uses potato flakes to make this bread with. I have made plain bread, rolls, and cinnamon bread with it. I personally use the bread rising setting on my dehydrator and do a 4 hour rise the first time and a 2 hour rise the second time. I am currently making bread sticks with it. I have not let it rise overnight (too cold in my house) Oh Yummy!!!

I received a sourdough starter from my father and tried a recipe that he had given me. That "batch"  never really rose and came out very heavy. I had to try again so I found this recipe. It rose very well over night but in the morning I only had one official bread pan in metal and one square casserole dish so I used those.  At a friend's suggestion I turned on my oven to 175 and when it reached that temp turned it off and put the loaves in to rise while I went to work. When I came home one had risen beautifully and the other had not. The one in the metal pan was flat and "sad looking". I went ahead and baked the risen one and transferred the other to another glass "meatloaf" pan. I left it on top of the stove while cooking dinner and it rose beautifully too! I baked the other and they both came out great! In light of this, I recommend not using metal to bake in; there was no other difference between the two. I believe this could have been SEWON's problem. I'm thrilled to announce I've successfully made my first bread and can't wait to make more!

This is a good basic recipe, but the two times, I've made it, I've also altered it - hence the three star review.  Both times I've made it, I've increased the salt to two teaspoons and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  This last time I also chopped up a hand full of herbs (basil, oregano, savory, parsley, thyme and chives) in a small food processor and drizzled 1/2 cup olive oil over the herbs as they chopped.  This mixture was substituted for the 1/2 cup corn oil.  The herbed bread turned out delish! Also, I will say that I've been using a very young starter and am looking forward to it aging a bit, and providing more tang.

I've been making this bread for almost a year now and it's truly the easiest and best tasting I've made.I use my own starter almost a year old an usually half this recipe because we like the bread fresh..Everyone that's tried it loves it ,it makes a big loaf .I usually stir mine together at night and leave to rise till the next morning.In the morning I knead  it and place in 4 x 8 greased pan and let it rise again.This rising usually only takes about2 hours and it's over the top of the pan.Love this bread thanks for such a good recipe.Mine usually bakes for 35 min.when I cool it I slather on butter for a soft crust.Thanks Becky!

I used the simple sourdough starter you start with yeast and let sit out several days.  I hadn't been feeding it regularly so I thought I killed it.  I made a dough with the recipe after feeding the starter the day before and let the dough sit overnight.  It had just about doubled but I wasn't ready to bake it just yet so I stored it in the fridge.  After a day in the fridge I pulled it out in the morning to warm it up.  When I got home from work I kneded it for about 10min and then divided it up half for pizza and half for breadsticks.  After forming I let rest/rise for 20-30 min.  Both the sticks and pizza turned out.  (the pizza took a bit longer and next time I'll increase the temp to 375-400.). The sourdough flavor was subtle but present none the less.  The bread was dense and had a good crust.  Next time I'm putting kosher salt on the sticks before I bake them.

I, like a handful of other reviewers, must have done something terribly wrong. My dough did not rise enough to double, and ultimately ended up as a dense, heavy, small loaf. Very disappointing.  I tried this recipe due to the reviews raving about what a light loaf of bread this made.

I used my own starter for this which is just a basic flour and water one. It turned out so good! I made it with 4 cups white flour and 2 of whole wheat flour and that made a nice texture. I also did 1 loaf of bread and then made 12 rolls with the other half of the dough. I rolled the tops of them in poppy seeds and cooked them in a 9x13 dish for 30 minutes. They are even yummier than the bread. I can't wait to use this recipe again.   A note to those who are having problems with the dough rising, it's not the recipe, it's your starter. Try feeding it for two days before baking your bread. Mine is a hearty starter and my dough rose very quickly.

I was so excited to try this recipe because it is a true sourdough recipe and does not require yeast. I am so happy that this turned out well.  I was very nervous because this was my first bread from a homemade starter and while it did take a long time to rise, it was worth the wait.  It took about 20 hours for the first rise and then about three for the second.  My dough was very sticky as well - too sticky to knead - so I added a small amout of flour just so I could handle it and it turned out fine.  Not to dense as I was worried it would be.  Good sourdough is a true test of patience!

Wow.  This bread is exactly like the kind I grew up on.  HEAT is the key.  I found the NEATEST place to let it rise - on top of my computer's CPU!!  By keeping it warm, it was ready to bake in no time!

This is the first time I have ever made sourdough bread, and this bread is wonderful. I did feed as others had suggested with 3/4 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of potato flakes & 1 cup of warm water. I let rise overnight and it did wonderful, however, when I started to knead, the dough was very sticky. I kept putting flour on my surface until I finished kneading, and added oil to my hands before I separated into two sections. I had read previously where some had added flour and it didn't rise for them a second time.  After being concerned I put my dough in the pans and set on top of my stove with the oven on.  The dough doubled in size and baked up beautifully. This recipe is a keeper.

I think I accidentally used too much sugar when I made this, so it was overly sweet. Even with that error, this bread is really great. The texture and crust are perfect. I had to wait 24 hours for the first rise, but I was in no hurry. A great recipe!

I didn't make any changes. The only changes I did that after over night rise I shape dough and coat slightly with olive  oil my Dutch oven and place the dough inside where it will need to rise again. After second rise I preheat  oven to 450 F and place  bread into the oven (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400 F. Bake for 20 minutes then remove the lid, bread will be pale and shiny. Continue to bake (uncovered) for an additional 40 minutes or until deep, golden brown. Keep in mind that all ovens are different; you might have to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures.
This bread come out very good !!! I really like this recipe

This was AWESOME!  A great bread and a fairly simple recipe.  Just a fyi, I got the best results when I waited to use my sour dough starter after I feed it and waited until it had risen to its highest peak and was all foamy and bubbly.  It made my bread so much lighter and you could really feel the difference in the dough.

Very good although not very sour. This is my first attempt at baking this recipe and I too used all of the  ingredients as written including Becky's starter.  I halved the recipe in case I messed up   (and I did!) I didn't want to waste any King Arthur bread flour. Well I accidentally used the full amount of starter for 2 loaves (I forgot to halve that!) so I had to cut the water but I think I ended up using almost a quarter cup more water than the recipe called for so I just added a bit more flour. I figured I'd press on and see how things turned out.   The dough rose perfectly overnight (12 hours in all) then I kneaded the dough all 10 mins by hand in the morning which I almost never do since I typically let my Kitchenaid do the kneading.  I have to say the second rise did not have the height that I expected albeit it did double (I like my loaves more of a round free form on a baking sheet).  In the end it turned out great!  I will be keeping this as a base recipe for more creative additions like olives, cheese and herbs.  

One question...why do the main kneading before the second rise and not before the first??  Since the dough is cold in the morning it would seem to be easier to knead before it is put in the refridge. Most other doughs I believe are kneaded mainly before the first rise then are punched down and let to rise a second time.  In any case this turned out wonderful despite my mistake. My previous attempts at sour dough were not so good.  Thanks for sharing!

Simply fabulous!  I used the starter by the same cook, Becky Richardson, that has potato flakes rather than flour, let my dough rise over night, kneaded for 10 minutes and formed two loaves.  I had to let the loaves rise for two hours in order for them to double in size, then baked them.  At 350 degrees, my loaves browned a little faster than I would have liked.  Next time I will set my oven to 300 degrees.  This bread was awesome and I have never made sourdough bread before.  This will become a staple for my family, everyone loved it.

This bread is amazing!!! This is my first attempt to make homemade bread. My Mom made a bread similar to this when I was a little girl. I called her up to let her know how great it is. Now my children will get to enjoy something I grew up with too. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

turned out nice.  I used my own starter but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It did rise quite well overnight and the 2nd rise only took about 3 hours, baked up lovely and deliscious.  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this recipe and my husband and I are probably going to finish the first loaf today. We are trying to resist, but it is really hard! I'm not a big sourdough fan, but my husband is. I only liked sourdough that I made years ago when someone gave me a starter. I used Esthers recipe for starter and this is near the top of the list as the best bread I have ever made! Thanks Becky!

I have a similar recipe that uses the same starter as Becky contributed. No change in the bread recipe except mine calls for 1/3 cup of sugar. I rarely have bread flour handy though so I use all purpose flour and add 1 teaspoon of gluten for each cup of flour (6 teaspoons).

This is the best bread I've ever made and even eaten!  Yes, it does take time to let rise both times, but it's well worth it!  Mix the dough in the morning, let it rise while I'm at work.  Take it out and do the kneading, then divide it and put it in the loaf pans.  Let it rise again overnight, and bake in the morning!   It really is wonderful!

I may be back to edit this review...everything seemed to be going well, it rose nicely overnight and I had high hopes but after shaping into loaves it didn't really rise much if at all. Maybe it needed more time but after two hours I expected to see some signs. I'll try again and hopefully have better luck!

The first two times I made this bread it was delicious.  From the third time on, it takes far too long to rise and will not get done in the middle.  I have fed and handled the starter per the starter recipe and have followed the bread recipe exactly.  I had high hope of making more creative breads with the starter but it's too much trouble to have disappointing results.

Very easy to make, and it turned out wonderful! I cut the recipe in half and made it as cloverleaf rolls, and it only took about 12 minutes in the oven. Really good recipe.

This bread recipe was great!  I thought the sugar and oil was going to be too much, so I used 1/3 cup of each instead.  I let it rise a long time ... all morning and into the afternoon.  Great texture. Made the best toast.

This was a great smooth dough when I kneaded it but it baked flat. I can't figure out what else to do. I made a proof box out of my oven and let it rise in there. Beware, it is really sticky, but it works out as you knead it. I may try this again.

Tried this recipe out as my first sourdough with a starter that I started. It came out great.I made one loave & four small buns. My husband ended up taking a bun to work for lunch. I didn't have any bread flour so I used 4 cups of whole wheat flour & 2 cups of allpurpose flour. I also wasn't sure how long to let the loaves rise so I let it go for about 2 hrs I could've put them in the oven earlier, but it's winter time. I did agree with someone else about it being sweet but with the whole wheat I would only cut it down to about 1/3 cup sugar.

This is a great recipe.  I also discovered something cool quite by accident!  I left the sugar out until it was time to punch.  So I kneaded it in and my loaves rose faster then they normally would.  I think this bread could use a little more salt, but it was still yummy.  The texture is really fantastic and I dig the clear directions.  Good stuff!

Of course after I had this all mixed and rising I read all of the reviews. 6 cups of flour was entirely too much for my kind of starter. My starter is much more thick than the author's, and thus created a less liquid mix to begin adding flour. I will in the future only use 5 cups. Having said that, even after 45 minutes in the oven, the bread did not brown quickly, and though it did rise well for both risings, both loaves weighed a ton. The results were that my husband proclaimed it to be the best crust he'd ever eaten. So we traded, I gave him the crust and he gave me the unfortunately mushy center. The crust was, indeed good, very sweet and so close to the flavor I was looking for, but the center was very heavy and dense. So, as you are making this, consider the type of starter you have and adjust your flour accordingly. I will try again...this is a learning process and if at first you don't succeed, try again. Right?

Ok, this is my second review of this bread the first time I had made alterations due to how long this bread took.  So this time I made the recipe exactly how it says in the recipe but I let mine rise on top of our pellet stove.  This cut the initial rising time to 4 hours.  This is a wonderful recipe and has that sour dough taste as long as you have a strong starter.  Thank you for sharing!

The consistency was perfect, but it was a little sweeter than I needed.  The recipe is easy to half, and the second time I used less sugar than recommended and it came out perfectly.  It also works with white spelt flour.

The bread was wonderful.  Probably because my starter had a pretty thin consistency (like pancake batter) I needed to use 7 1/2 cups of flour to create the appropriate dough texture.  I started the bread in the morning and then let it rise six hours.  I did not knead the dough after dividing it, rather I just shaped the loaves and let them rise until double.  The crust was thin and crisp and texture of the bread was soft and lovely.  I will definitely make this again.

OMG!!! This is the best bread, I did use her sourdough starter.  This is the first time I have ever made bread.  I did use Whole wheat flour and veg oil thats what I had on hand. Would like to know if anyone has doubled the starter and recipe, if it turned out okay.  Would like to make more than two loaves at a time.  I love it.....

This is a very good recipe.  Like others, my bread rose the second time just not enough.  I let it rise for about 1 hour but it still didn't quite double.  I thought the dough was great to work with and the loaves turned out beautiful.  Not as sour as I'd prefer but maybe it was the starter too.  I still would recommend it though.

I have been looking for this recipe since I lost my starter a few years ago. My sister-in-law had given me this recipe and some starter and I made it for years then the starter went bad because I forgot it for too long. You do have to feed it or it dies. This is a great bread and my family and everyone I give a loaf to loves it. It is easy but you do have to follow the directions exactly. I had no problem in the top being too brown like some say. You do have to adjust your oven sometimes as some ovens are not set correctly. Thanks Becky for putting this bread and the starter on Allrecipes. Lora

This recipe worked perfectly. The bread turned out to be flavorful, but not really sour. I'm not a big fan of true sourdough, so that was a plus. My starter has been working for a couple of years and is maintained at room temperature. I noted that several reviewers had problems with rise. The first rise was an overnight rise (14 hours). Then I kneaded the bread until it was a nice firm dough and let it rise again for about six hours. It baked nicely. The crust was very dark before the bread was baked through; it took some patience and the full 40 minutes to be done.

Very very good! Definitely worth the time put in to it.  I used starter from the same member.  My first time making sourdough.  Loved it - followed everything perfectly and it came out perfectly.  I was a little scared because people said it was sweet and that is not what I wanted...its not? So it was delicious can't wait to see how long I can keep the starter going! :)

I make this bread almost every week. It's great, the only change I make is 1/4 cup of sugar rather than 1/2.

I loved this recipe and I loved the sourdough starter that it is made with by the same author. It was a great bread. I doubled the whole thing and made half with added pepperoni to make some awesome pepperoni bread! WOW!

This one is a keeper.

The bread is great but I just don't know what I am doing wrong, the top gets brown but the middle is not done all the way. I have made this twice and had the same problem. How long should I let it rise the 2nd time? I just don't know, maybe I don't let it raise long enough the 2nd day. Please someone help me because I really want it to turn out because I am trying so hard.

If you love sourdough bread, then you should love this recipe.  Use the starter submitted by the same lady.  The bread rises beautifully, makes the kitchen smell wonderful, and is delicious.  I've shared it with others and get nothing but high praise.  Thank you, Becky Richarson!!

I used the Sourdough Starter by Becky for this also.  I was sooo happy to find this recipe/starter again because I had misplaced it.  The only thing different I did was to omit the salt.  I have 6 loaves rising right now for Christmas presents!

So, this is a tasty recipe, but it tastes NOTHING like sourdough bread. It's more like loaves of Hawaiian dinner rolls. The quest for a good sourdough continues...

Wow!  We have a very new starter (about 4 weeks) which just started doubling after every feeding so we wanted to try some sourdough bread.  This is the first recipe we tried and WOW!  I am amazed at how good it is.  We wanted to start with something that could be used for toast or sandwich bread and this is perfect!  I was even more surprised when my kids couldn't stop eating it. They love it!  

If I had one adjustment, I would reduce the sugar just a tad. I brushed the top with butter when it came out of the oven to soften the crust a bit, but really that isn't even necessary.  I also used olive oil since I have it on hand. It is just perfect, exactly what we were looking for!  This is the first time in my life I've made any kind of bread so I am so pleased it turned out so well.

My family loved this bread!  I used 1/3 cup sugar and subbed olive oil for the corn oil.  The dough was very sticky after proofing the first time but I did not add flour.  I simply "kneaded" it in my Kitchenaid stand mixer and shaped it in the oiled pans.  It turned out great!  Thank you!

Five Yums Up! Best bread recipe I've tried so far. I substituted brown sugar for white. The second rising took as long as the first. Tastes more like regular bread than like sourdough.

Followed the recipe exactly with a good sourdough start and turned out delicious! Took quite a while to double the second time of raising but now I'll know for next time :). Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I made this bread with a different starter. I haven't made bread for years (and that was just with a bread machine and mixes) but wanted to give it a try. I tried a different recipe first because I didn't want to wait a day. Big mistake. It did not turn out well. This recipe turned out wonderfully. It was a little sweeter but with a wonderful sourdough flavor. The texture is amazing and the crust is simply to die for. I used canola oil instead of corn oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. Second rise took about 2.5 hours. I put it in the oven with just the light on for warmth for the second rise. For the first, it sat on the stove overnight. It required more patience than I usually have but it is well worth it!

My first batch, I used my starter purchased from King Artur Flour and blended half AP flour with WW flour. It turned out really well, but it was very crumbly. I'm working on my second batch today. And it is 100% WW flour. The weather here is very humid, so hopefully this batch will be as good as the first. I will submit photos after baking.

Hi, this is the second time I bake this bread in less than a week. It's wonderful! I did not even need to knead this dough. I applied the no knead principal and found it worked perfectly.  Tomorrow morning I will make into cinnamon bread (to please hubby), and bake when I return from work. Thank you for a very superior recipe.

this is a great recipe, I didn't change anything except, the oil, I used canola ( it's what I use) and I didn't knead the dough I just dumped it out on my board and worked it a few times let is rest, and shaped it as best I could as it's a wet dough and I didn't want to work new flour into it. My family loved it and it was supper easy!! Thank you so much for a great recipe!!

I used sourdough starter by Esther Nelson also on this site. I let the dough rise with the light on in my oven for 13 hours on the first rise and 5 hours on the second rise. Baked at 300 for 30 minutes as my circa 1961 oven runs a little hot. I was a little nervous as I had never made sourdough bread before, but this recipe turned out 2 fantastic loaves! Had a subtle sour taste, not too sweet as other reviewers had mentioned. Can't wait to make this recipe again as I think spending a short amount of time making bread over several days is easier to manage with young kids than spending a larger amount of time in one day.

Perfect every single time. I have made loaves, dinner rolls, and cinnamon rolls with this, so far. The only difference in ingredients is that I use olive oil. It's what I usually have on hand. But I plan to try out the corn oil! Also, I've halved the sugar before & used pineapple juice for the other part. Either way it's always delicious! I've tried a lot of sourdough recipes but this one is my favorite. Give it a try---it's amazing.

I like how the consistency if this bread turned out. Very fluffy on the inside and a firm crust in the outside. Both things that are required for a good sourdough loaf. However this isn't a sourdough. It is a white bread that uses a starter. My sourdough starter is very very sour and has been in my family for 60+ years (and my grandmother started while working at Boudin bakery in San Francisco) making delicious sourdough, so I know it wasn't a bad starter. It just doesn't make for a very sour loaf. That being said I was looking for a recipe that didn't take 3 days like my grandmother's and this one will do just fine. I might tweak it a bit to make it more sour but other than that it makes for a great bread. For anyone not using bread flour I highly recommend replacing two tbls of flour with baking soda so that you get a proper rise.

Love this bread!!

I first made it exactly as written and it is perfect that way  but all cooks "mess" with a recipe  sometimes.

I make it twice a week, so easy and my friends and neighbors love me.
I do use melted butter instead of corn oil and rarely knead it after just a bit before the first rise. Works both ways. I even did a taste test at work to see if there was a difference taste wise. came out even. Just a preference so if you feel lazy don't knead it see what you think. I use Becky's starter I do add three TBSP of sugar and three of potato flakes to feed it. Don't know if it is a big deal, just goofed up one day and it seemed to work better. Might just be in my head or my native yeast.

Oh yes once in awhile I add gluten to the bread flour. 2 TBSP for the two loaves. A bit more protein and texture.

Since I work and am single and can eat when I want I set the started out all night after I feed it and mix the bread in the am to rise. When I get home I make the loaves and let rise about an hour and bake 45 minutes in my oven. Works out great for me.

This bread will last for at least 12 days on the counter in a bag. Never has molded. If it lasted longer might be able to tell how long before it spoils, but I eat it! Toast it for a great flavor later on in the week. Wow the french bread it makes is a killer!!

FYI not sour like San Francisco bread just really good.

Thanks Becky!!!

I made my first 2 loaves using this recipe and the corresponding starter (potato flakes). I followed the recipe precisely. The dough actually never became a kneadable dough, more like a batter. I put the batter into my bread machine and simply set it to knead 10 minutes, then poured the contents into 2 loaf pans and baked. The result was a decent loaf of bread - dense, sweetishly sour. The next time, I will add more flour for a kneadable dough and see what happens.

Bread is wonderful. Holds up well, lasted more than a week in a plastic storage container. Fabulous as oven baked French Toast with orange flavoring, orange zest and dried cherries. I'm currently attempting to freeze 2 unbaked loaves, I'll edit when I find out if it worked well.

You wouldn't believe how amazing my house smells right now!  I tried a sampling and this bread tastes amazing.  I followed the recipe as written and didn't change a thing, other than the fact that there was no way I could let the dough rise overnight on the countertop.  After about 4 hours it was to the top of the bowl I had it in and it spent the night in the refrigerator.  I must have a very lively starter! The next day when I got home from work I kneaded it for maybe 5 minutes and made one loaf and 12 small rolls.  They turned out a little lumpier than some of the other pictures posted (maybe because I didn't knead it the full 1 minutes) but the flavor is fantastic!

wasted alot of flour to learn that my starter didn't have the yeast to work.  Maybe try this again later after my starter has matured.

OMG! This was my first try at making bread and this recipe came out wonderful.. Only difference was that I had starter from Amish Friendship Bread which uses sugar and milk so the bread came out sweeter than I imagine the recipe intends.  It was still very tasty, especially buttered with a spicy dish of New Orleans style barbequed shrimp. If I make it again using Friendship bread starter I'll just cut back on the sugar in the dough.

This recipe is excellent (munching a piece right now)!  I had a little issue with rise, but this is due to the fact that I have relatively young starter.  My dough took 2 days to rise (so don't give up hope if it takes a while).  Also, the bread is only lightly sour.  Again, this is because I have a young starter.  But the flavor is lovely.  Thanks for posting!  : )

Great recipe.  I wasn't worried that with only the started the bread wouldn't rise.  Sure enough it took the full overnight period to rise the first time and about 6 hours to rise the second time but it was amazing!  Like others I would advise cutting back on the sugar and maybe a dash more salt.    I made two loafs and would advise bread rounds instead of the the loaf.  The round seemed to rise better, backed more evenly and had a better texture.  It did only need to bake for about 25 minutes, so be careful.  I will absolutely make this recipe again with my slight alterations.

This was my first attempt at sourdough & it worked great!  I followed to a "t" using the same starter (also by Becky).  I wasn't sure about just placing the dough in the bread pan - I thought it should be rolled & shaped, so that's what I did.  I actually baked them on a flat stone & made long loaves.  My family could not get enough of this bread - I continued making it every 5 days all winter long!  Thanks!

I followed this recipe, but made rolls instead of a loaf.  I formed the dough into little balls, slightly larger than a golf ball, dropped them in cupcake style baking cups, and baked them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  They are incredible. My starter is super tangy, and the combination of tangy and sweet is addictive.

My whole family found this bread way too sweet.  Because you are using just your starter it is a good way to find out if your starter is good or not.  If I made it again, I might put in 1 tbsp. of sugar.

Yay, it worked! I used this same contributor's sourdough starter and I am so happy it worked! I prefer this sourdough to the flour starter, because it doesn't get quite as sour or crusty. This bread makes THE BEST GRILLED CHEESE EVER.

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe. I followed your directions exactly and came up with two beautiful loaves of bread. The bread is absolutely delicious. I need look no further. I can not imagine improving upon this one. I did, of course, use your sourdough starter, on this site as well. Perfect combination! My husband and I both love to cook and bake and we thought this recipe was truly outstanding, simplicity and all you can ask for. You truly deserve every star that comes your way. Once again, we thank you for sharing...

I have made sourdough bread for many years. However, I let my starter go too long without feeding it. I used Becky's starter recipe, and my dough is rising at this very minute. I can't wait to bake it in the morning. I give it to family and friends, and they enjoy it too. Thanks for sharing Becky. I'm back in business now!!

I made this recipe years ago using the potato flake starter and it was soft, slightly tangy/slightly sweet sourdough bread.  I made it again yesterday into today using King Arthur Flour sourdough starter and it was so aggresively sour my dog won't eat it!  If you are making this bread for the first time, use her starter recipe, too.  Even the "wicked bad" loaf rose well and had great texture.  This is a keeper recipe as long as your sourdough isn't an agressive breed :-) If you have a more agressive starter, edit the recipe to include 1 packet of yeast, and cut the rising time to 90 minutes instead of overnight.

This recipe quadrupled over night. Note to self, buy bigger loaf pans. It overflowed the baking pans. I only have a small loaf pan. It makes a lot of bread and Im gonna need bigger pans cause I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've used this recipe for several years now, and it has never failed me. (I looked it up because mine got misplaced)  If you have never used it, you should know that you have to add more flour sometimes to get the right consistency.  I think the humidity of your house has a lot to do with that.  Also, sometimes the starter has to be revamped with a little yeast if it has been in the fridge for awhile.

I have been making this bread weekly now for about four months.  It is outstanding and so easy.  If it is cold it will take longer to rise...I sometimes turn the oven on to low, then after it heats up turn it off...then put bread in to rise
excellent...have used this recipe to make canzones as well...very tasty

This turned out great.  I left mine in the bowl for about 18 hours (I think I could have used it sooner, but I wanted to let it go overnight).  My sourdough starter has sugar in it, so I completely eliminated the sugar from the recipe.  I only added less than 1/4 cup flour when kneading this morning.  If your sourdough starter is not the consistency of yogurt or sour cream, you will need more flour.  Your dough should not be super sticky.  If you sift the flour, do so AFTER measuring out 6 cups.  I didn't sift my flour because most flours are already presifted (check your bag).  Very easy and well worth the wait.

I experienced the same thing as a couple others. The dough didn't rise after kneading. I thought the taste was great, but it was dense and slightly undercooked in the middle. I would give my own loaf 3 stars, but I have to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt. I'll try a couple other recipes before I come back to this.

My dough did not rise much at all. I baked it anyway, and it did come out edible, but the bread was way too dense. No idea why this dough is such a poor riser. I was thinking it may be the high oil content.

Two loaves of beautiful bread.  I was sure thankful for my Kitchenaid's dough hook though.  Maybe I'm not quite ready for my bread-making badge, but I thought it was a lot of very stiff dough after the first rising.  In the end, the results were great.

Turned out to be a great bread!!  I never had a problem with it rising the 2nd time but it was a little sticky during the kneading process.  I just incorporated flour slowly through kneading in.

We made this with whole wheat flour and it made wonderful bread. Though it was not 'sour' at all it had a great flavor.  We are still looking for a 'sour' sourdough.

This is okay, I guess, but much too sweet for sourdough.  The crust isn't chewy either like San Francisco sourdough. I'll keep looking for a better recipe

This bread is absolutely wonderful.  My husband counts the minutes till it is done baking and eats slice after slice of hot delicious bread.  My 6 year old asks me each morning if it is time to feed the starter yet.  I just reprinted the recipe for my mother-in-law who loved it too!  I feed it every three days and have also made it with 2 cups of wheat flour substituted.  Everyone likes that too.  I sometimes have to add a little more flour to make a workable dough.  It ALWAYS rises...my husband calls it "nuclear bread" because it rises up and out of the bread pans.  It does rise better if it is warm so I sit it on the stove with the stove hood light on.  That seems to work great.

I've used this basic potato flake sourdough recipe for a few years now and it's wonderful.  For a variation I substitute 1 cup of oatmeal for a cup of the flour and use 1/2 cup of pancake syrup instead of the sugar.

I would agree with the other comments about it being sweet.  Mine also came out quite dark in colour, but we did enjoy it.  It was very easy to make.  Making it again and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup.

This is a dense loaf recipe [makes 2 loaves].  I am making French toast with it.  I shared a loaf with my friend and she says it's yummy toasted,  with butter and jelly!  I am looking for a more airy recipe.

Yes, I did make changes as usual! I used what I had on hand... I first made a whole wheat starter from Chef John's recipe here.  Then used organic cane sugar instead of bleached white; grapeseed oil (had just enough left) instead of corn oil; and a multigrain bread flour (Roger's brand) for this recipe.  It rose beautifully overnight!  I don't normally MAKE bread :), but this recipe was easy compared to Chef John's Simple Sourdough recipe! :)  I only had 1 pan, so I braided the other half.  Only problem... I forgot about it, and left it in 10 minutes longer than necessary!  So I will definitely be making it again :).

This is a great recipe.  I've been searching for a sourdough recipe that doesn't require yeast due to a sensitivity and this turned out great.  The crust is chewy and the bread is of good texture.  I did cut the oil in half and used avocado oil.  Will be making again!  Thanks Becky!!

Don’t expect an “artisanal” type of loaf from this recipe: It’s good, but more closely resembles sour dough white bread.

This recipe makes wonderful loaves for sandwiches.  I haven't bought bread from the store in years!  My sourdough starter is made from potato flakes and sugar so the bread is extra soft from the potato.

I made the starter from Sourdough Bread Starter I and subsequently made my first loaf using this recipe.  The bread was sweeter than I expected. But that's in no way a bad thing.  The bread was absolute heaven on Earth.  

I've done some reading and the reason it may have turned out a little sweet is possibly due to the rise time.  The first rise was about 10 hours, and the second rise was only about 4.  My research leads me to believe if I let it rise longer, the "taste will be more rich".  I'm not sure if that means it would be less sweet or not.  

The second time I made bread (from the same initial starter), it turned out less sweet.  I let it rise a little longer, but the dough started to overlap the edge of the loaf pan.  

If anyone can shed a little light on this, I would appreciate it.

It took about five hours to rise in the pan and I would reduce the baking temperature a little (in my oven) to get a little drier loaf before the crust forms. Pretty good flavor; I’ll try this one again.

I've made this a few times with a rye starter I started about a year ago, I've tried a few different sourdough bread recipes and this is by far the best. Only change I made is using olive oil instead of corn oil. This recipe made a great bread bowl for a dip I made for the Superbowl.

I am new to sourdough. I had an all rye starter that I fed with white flour a day ago. It must be a great starter because I found I had to punch down the dough after about 6 hours and put it into bread pans for the second rising which I will leave overnight. I have high hopes this will turn out a success. i plan to put a pan of water in the oven to give it a bit of chewy crust. Amazing what sourdough will do without the addition of extra yeast. I think the quality of the starter is what makes the difference.

I revised the recipe by adding the flour gradually to the starter mixture and  beating with my Kitchenaid mixer to  build up the gluten. After the flour was worked in I left it to rise. This is a great simple recipe that really fits the bill for me. I'll create an addendum to this post if it doesn't work out as successfully as I expect it will.

This is a beautiful loaf of bread, slices up so easily, great for sandwiches! The whole family will love it! The recipe is great as is, but I prefer to substitute a couple cups of the flour with Whole Wheat Flour, and half of the sugar with with Blue Agave.

I use this recipe as the basis for all the variations of sourdough bread that I've tried.  The proportions are easy to memorize, especially when doubled, and is excellent even when scanting the salt.  The texture and taste is actually better on the second day or after.  Keep the dough a bit moist for the best results. I used a completely natural rye starter that I've kept going for over three months.

the bread was wonderful. Made 3 small loaves. I gave 2 loaves to friends.  They both said the bread was heavenly!  I used the recipe as written.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this twice now. The first time I left it too long for the second rise and it kind of flattened. This time I put it in early and THEY LOOK GREAT! Waiting for them to cool, but if for some reason they don't taste amazing like they did last time, I'll change the review. I love this bread and so does my boyfriend(my "secret" recipe). Thanks Becky!

I made this bread twice, with a healthy starter, and both times my bread was very dense.  Not sure why as I gave plenty of time for the rises.  I had better luck with another recipe from this site.

I LOVE this recipe.  My loaves are a bit dense but the flavor is superb.  I never have any left.  I use canola oil instead of corn.  I make this a couple times a month and have passed this recipe to a few friends.

One recipe made A LOT of bread. 2 gigantic loaves that could easily have been 4 regular loaves. But it's super fluffy, and a tad on the bland side (although my starter is only 2.5 weeks old to be honest). This browns fast, so I put foil on top when it reached my desired shade, and the crust is naturally soft

Delicious. Light fluffy bread. So easy. I reduce salt to 1 teaspoon, use dark olive oil and raw sugar to add flavor. I start with the potato starter, this makes a lighter bread.

This was my first attempt at using my sourdough starter. It worked beautifully. I will agree with Ganguet that  it was bland and a bit sweeter than I wanted. But honestly it was not bad, and it has given me confidence to evaluate other recipes and continue to bake sourdough goods.
Attempt 2 Rise not good overnight Gave another 10 hrs in warm spots Less sugar 3/4 cup of combo oat bran, wheat germ, soy flour

Beautiful loaves of bread!! I will definitely make this again but cut sugar to 1/4 cup. It's a little too sweet but has a wonderful texture. This was my first attempt at baking bread in the oven. I'm wondering if anyone has tried it in a bread machine.

This sourdough has a great taste. I ran into the same problem as some regarding the dough not rising. So, the 2nd time around, I kneaded the dough for 10 mins first before setting aside to let rise. After kneading the dough, I split it in half and placed in oiled loaf pans and let rise overnight.  It turned out great!

Excellent.  This is the real deal and perhaps one of the FEW real sourdoughs on this site.  Making sourdough with cultured yeast defeats purpose of sourdough. Nicely done.

This recipe turned out really well!  I did not have a problem kneading it after it rose. I added and extra cup of starter and it was a bit sweet.  MAybe a little less sugar next time. That being said, every started is going to be a bit different. Over all, a very successful baking experience.  I should note, I am NOT and experience bread baker and found this recipe pretty easy to follow.

The starter is great (use Becky's) and follow the recipe. Easy to make and tastes great. At first the bread is very spongy and doesn't taste much like sour dough (it's a very sticky dough too). But it improves emencely as the starter is fed and ages. My guys really like it, give it a try! Thanks Becky! :)

Okay,my bread did not rise and came out very dense .I admit,I added flour when I was kneading it in the final phase to deal with the stickiness.Back to the drawing board.

Didn't work for me.  I used a starter recommended on another page consisting of 1c milk, 1c sugar, 1 c flour---stired daily for 5 days and same ingredients added again and process repeated.  On day 10 I tried this sourdough.  I read many comments by other readers first and tried to follow the "fool proof" suggestions.  Mine came out flat and very sugary.  I only used 1/4c sugar knowing my starter had plenty of sugar in it.  I did not add yeast---as many said I did not need to.  I had a dough that was like a kneadable dough at first but then it got wetter and wetter. I probably added at least 1/2 cup if not 1 cup as I went as it was all sticking to me and the board as I kneaded.  I finally put it in the pans and it almost looked like banana bread in it before cooking.  Just very wet.  I followed suggestions saying not to add more flour, that it needed to be wet looking. Nuttin. Never rose. I think I'm back to buying yummy sr dough from the store.  It was worth a try but a little disheartening.

My dough rose wonderfully overnight and was the most delicous sourdough bread I have ever tasted.  I was so pleased to find out that I could actually make something so wonderful.  I want to make it for my elderly dad.  He would be so proud that i caught wild yeast and then made this bread!

I think I had a bit of a weak starter, but the bread still came out fine. It browned awfully quickly, so I think I took it out a tad too early, but it was still okay.  Even though I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, it was still a bit too sweet for my taste, but then again I have spoilt German taste buds when it comes to bread. ;)  Overall, this is a nice and easy recipe which is suitable for sourdough newbies like me.

This bread was so easy to make! I followed the directions exactly to make two big fluffy loaves with a delicious crust. It was a little sweeter than I prefer, but everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing this. I look forward to making it again.

I was dissappointed with the results of this bread...the bread baked up beautifully, but it has very little taste.  I didn't have any problems with it rising (but it did take a LONG time to rise).  I may try again with a little more mature starter and add more salt to the dough.

for those that had trouble- do NOT add flour.  The dough is sticky, as it should be.  if it's not rising, also check if your kitchen is too cold.  i am fond of this recipe, as its a true sourdough, no added yeast.  turns out excellent.

Mine didn't rise at all.  Not the first time and not the second time. I really think that you need to add yeast, especially with a mature starter.

I do not have the recipe for the starter, I would love to try this if someone could get me started. I am new to bread making. OK this will be my first. The reviews I think will help me a lot.

The end result was a heck of a surprise. During the making process, I was sure that this was going to be a total failure, but I followed the recipe and WHAM, I ended up with some GREAT bread.  Thanks Becky

This is an excellent easy sourdough bread which is wonderful hot out of the oven but even better the next day toasted. Using a potato based starter does take a bit of time - I take my starter out, feed it, wait 8-10 hours, make the bread, let rise 8-10 hours, make loaves and 2nd rise but it's worth it. If your starter is slow, add a bit of yeast to jump start it. But time is what gives this bread such wonderful flavor.

I used Becky's starter. Followed the directions for the starter and the bread to the letter. The dough never rose and was a giant hockey puck.  I'm very disappointed. I tried it 2 times.

This bread turns out Great...but I do not think it is worth the trouble. Just make beer bread instead and save a week worth of trouble, and also you dont have to worry about accidentially giving yourself food poisioning.

This is just like the bread I used to make years and years ago.  It is SO GOOD!  I cannot make it fast enough for my family.  I have not had any trouble at all with the dough being too thin.  It is a bit sticky but I never have to work in more than 1/4 cup of flour when it's kneading time.

I love to make and bake bread.  This is the very first time I have ever made a sourdough that used no added yeast at all.  This bread was absolutely the best bread I have ever made.  The crust was tender, I don't like hard crust and the bread itself was tender with just a wonderful hint of sour.  Wonderful!!!!  Going back for another piece.  I will make this again and again and share it with others too.  
Thank you for this simple recipe!!!

Was ok. Didn't turn out very "sourdoughy" for me. I used Becky's sourdough starter I with it. I might try again just because everyone else had such good luck.

I used the submitter's sourdough starter with this recipe.  The bread turned out looking very nice, but I thought it was almost flavorless.  It wasn't sourdough-tangy nor was it yeasty tasting...just different; not sure how to describe it.  Thanks for letting me try your recipe, Becky.

WOW!
Even my 83-year-old mother says this is some of the best bread she's ever had, and she doesn't give out praise easily ;)
My 4-year-old helps knead and begs for more bread. The flavor and texture are just right. I used the "Sourdough Starter I" from the same member.

Not sure if I should rate this or the starter.  I am sorta disappointed in this recipe.  It rose just fine, but... It took 5 days to make the started and the bread turned out BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  Like NO flavor.  Nothing.  Maybe it will get more flavorful as time goes on. I would recommend trying another starter.

This bread really did not turn out for me.  I folled the directions but it just did not come together.  The bread had a very hard time rising even over night.  As a result it was very dense and heavy.  It did have a good flavor but the texture just wasn't worth it.

This bread turned out great! I used the starter by the same person. It rose so much the first time I thought I should have used a bigger bowl! ;) The only change I made was reducing the sugar to 1/4 C. Bread had good flavor, slight sour taste, not sweet like some others have noted. Not as sour as I like it, but the other two in the house don't like a strong sourdough, so it's ok. I will definitely make this again.

I used the 30-year-old sourdough starter that my aunt gave me for xmas. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour. The sourdough taste was good, but like the prior reviewer noted, the crust isn't chewy like a SF sourdough. I was a little disappointed. All in all though, the bread tastes very good.
