So if your lucky enough to be able to find hibiscus flowers in your area, then this Sangria is a must try.  Not overly sweet, but the floral spiced factor is  unmistakable, decidedly different, and extremely refreshing on a hot afternoon

A very refreshing drink. A bit sweet, but still quite good. I added a splash of sparkling water and liked it even more. The cinnamon and cardamom were a beautiful touch. Thank you for the recipe.
