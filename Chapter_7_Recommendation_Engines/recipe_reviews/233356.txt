Soooo moist!  I had never cooked in a bag before and was most pleasantly surprised at how good this turkey was.  Mine was almost 15 pounds so I added a little additional celery and onion.  Thanks for the recipe.

My turkey was a bit light (around 9 lb) and I did leave it in a bit long (200 deg); it was not falling-off-the-bones soft. Flavor was okay. Hoping to make good sandwiches out of it.

AMAZING way to cook turkey.  I have used Reynolds Oven Bags for years.  Recipe is perfect.  I place the turkey in the bag breast-side-down.  This way the juices stay in the white meat.  If you haven't tried oven bags - you definitely should.  No getting up early or basting.  The turkey stays moist and cooks very quickly.
