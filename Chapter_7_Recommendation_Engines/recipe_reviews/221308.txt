I squirted my lime wedge into my drink, then just tossed the wedge into my drink. Very good. I loved the tartness of this drink.

You can't go wrong w/a classic!  I prefer to use Ocean Spray's Diet Sparkling Cranberry for some bubbles.  I rarely have limes, so I tend to forgo the garnish.  This makes a great weekend breakfast drink (especially if you don't live in Seattle and can't drink Manny's for breakfast...).

I love this with a splash of "Fresca". Very refreshing summer drink.

This one is awesome.  I moistened my glass with a lime wedge and then rimmed it with pink sugar.  (See my picture) Added in some fresh cranberries and it was like heaven!  Definitely making this one again!

Wonderful and especially nice with vanilla vodka.
