Since most of the reviews for this pie crust are so positive you will be tempted, as I was, to use this recipe. Before you do, however, I urge you to pay careful attention to not only the one or two star reviews, but also to any reviews that indicate they made changes, or who comment that there was too much shortening in the recipe. They are all right on! My experience was the same...too much fat makes a dough that is too greasy, fragile and difficult to work with. I can't even comment on how it baked as I didn't get that far. I was so disappointed in the dough itself that I just pitched it and made it again using my old recipe. I didn't trust the dough enough to gamble with what the finished product would  be. If you make the necessary changes to  make this pie crust work then you really aren't using this recipe anyway!

This is a great recipe because the measurements are very accurate.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening instead of all shortening and mixed them together and put it in the fridge. I also put my food processor bowl in the fridge.  After they were good and chilled, I put the flour in the food processor and added the shortening and pulsed it till it looked coarse and then I added ice cold water to it a little at a time as I pulsed it until it formed a ball.  It came out EXCELLENT in taste and texture! My hubby is a pastry chef and gave it thumbs up! Oh and I put a little less salt in it because my butter had salt.  If you use the unsalted butter put the full tsp of salt in it as the recipe indicates.

EASY WAY: To roll this out easily and perfectly center the dough between two pieces of plastic wrap, then roll it out.  When you are finished rolling it out take off the top piece of plastic wrap, put a pie pan upside down over the dough, then turn the whole thing (pie pan, dough, bottom plastic wrap) upside down.  Lastly, press the dough into place in the pie pan and remove the second piece of plastic wrap.

I have baked more than 20 pies over the past year, and consistently get rave reviews about the crust.   Of course, I use this recipe, but I add an extra trick.  Chill EVERYTHING before beginning.  I put the bowl and pastry cutter in the refrigerator, and I keep 1 ice cube in the water to keep it cold.   It keeps the shortening from blending too much with the flour, leaving you with little pockets of shortening that result in extra flakes.

I am a seasoned pie crust maker, our usual crust recipe is 3/2/1  Flour/crisco/cold water in that order. It has worked out pretty good for me, but I always have to work in so much flour. Many of my friends have tried that recipe, and think it is ruined, and toss it. They are daunted by the gooey appearance of the dough. This recipe changes the ratio just a little bit, and the crust is perfect. I skip the chilling, I just let it rest on the counter for 30 min. before I use it. I never plan well enough in advance to put things in the fridge. I avoid recpes that tell me to do that, usually. It is now my favorite crust recipe. I am entering a pie in a contest next weekend, I think it will win. Thanks for the great crust recipe. (the pie did not win the contest, but the crust got rave reviews, and I was asked for it many times.)

Very good pie crust.  I didn't have the 4 hours to let the dough chill, so I added an egg and made the the water ice water and it was great!

I have tried different kinds of pie crusts in my life, looking for the very best one. I was sceptical about this one, because it sounded wayyy too simple, and I had tried one that used the exact same ingredients before,but different ratios, and didn't turn out so good. So I thought, I'd try it and see if it would make a difference. And did it make a difference! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening. It came out so flaky and fluffy and delicious! Even my mom (who can be pretty critical sometimes), said that it was the perfect crust! I was shocked! It really is the best ever pie crust! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I just love this crust and so does everyone else who has tried it!  I have used it for pies and chicken pot pie.  It's easy to roll out.  I have to add a little extra flour usually just to get it smooth, but it bakes up perfect and flaky.  Also, if you need the crust NOW, just stick it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes.  Works just the same.

This is the perfect pie crust.Over the years I have tried other recipes that cut down on the shortening but haven't been this light and flaky. Also, the less you handle it the flakier it is. I used about 5 Tbsp. of water and that was enough--but make sure it is ice cold. Sometimes the best recipes are so basic.

Can a recipe increase your self esteem??? When it earns you the rave reveiws this pie crust will, it certainly does! I have never even attempted to make homemade crust, after hearing all sorts of horror stories, and knowing I am NOT the best baker in the world. I doubled this crust for a chicken pot pie, and was surprised that the recipe yeilded plenty enough pastry to line AND top a 13x9" pyrex pan. I used butter flavored shortening and added parmesan cheese, granulated garlic powder, ground black pepper and a TOUCH of seasoning salt. I folded in parsley flakes for color. Otherwise, I followed all ingredients to the letter. This crust was even flakier than premium frozen brands, even though I had to roll it out on more flour and probably handled it over-much. I also layered it between Saran wrap, as another reveiwer suggested, to roll out the crust evenly. I am not sure why the dough was sticky, but it probably was 100% my fault for not allowing enough chilling time. Despite my truely clumsy efforts this was a sturdy, flaky, and beautiful crust!  Next time I am going to experiment with cookie cutters, to create 3-D shapes on the top crust. Hint: This is NOT a sweet crust, so keep that in mind when you are not preparing savory pies...and proper chilling is a MUST!

Would not recommend this at all!  Way too much shortening! And really not easy to work with, even after refrigerating.  It ruined my holiday pies!  Sorry - I wish it would have been awesome.

I re-joined allrecipes to write a review of this crust...  I don't know why everyone gives it so many stars.  I lost my regular recipe and decided to try this one and it was terrible.  Way too greasy to work with, even after refrigerating for hours.  It kept tearing when I tried to move it no matter what I did with it.  I finally just pressed it out in the bottom of the pie pan, threw the extra away, and found a different recipe for the top crust which worked better.  Way way too much shortening to be workable, and adding extra flour while rolling it out didn't help.  I will never use this recipe again.  It nearly ruined what I was trying to make.

I know I am in the minority here but I would say this was the worst pie crust I have ever made. The dough was very difficult to work with and I ended up patching and patting it into the pie plate. I won't be making this again.

I made this pie crust, and it was terrible!!!!  So I made the recipe again thinking that I had made an error the first time around but no.  TOO much shortening for two cups of flour.  I felt like we were eating a ball of lard.  It really ruined my rhubarb pie.  Then I checked some other pie crust recipes and none called for 1 cup of shortening to 2 cups of flour - just toooo much shortening.

Terrible.  I had a hard time working with the dough, kept falling apart.  After baking, the crust was so moist, it stuck to fingers and crumbled completely. There also was a grainy texture.  Basic Flaky Pie Crust is way better!!!

This recipe nearly ruined our Thanksgiving dessert!  It was awful!  There is way too much shortening.  It made a ball of dough even before I had added any water.  It tasted terrible and I couldn't roll it out.  I finally gave up and drove to the nearest store that I could find that was open on Thanksgiving day and bought a Pillsbury crust.  I am an experienced baker and have made plenty of crusts from scratch in my life so I have no doubt that it was the result of a bad recipe.  Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a pie crust recipe!

Greasy, tasteless, hard to work with. It was flaky though. I have started to question recipes where people give it 5 stars and then change the ingredients. I like to read the changes people have made over time but at least give the original recipe the rating it deserves.

Obviously so many people with high praise can't be wrong. My experience was not so great. I found the dough very hard to work with, and ended up having to do a fair bit of patching and grafting to the bottom and top crusts. The end result was flaky, but to the point of being biscuit-y. I've made a very basic crust many times (flour, salt, butter, sugar, apple cider vinegar, ice water), with great success. This crust was flakier than the crust I usually make, but I'd have to find a way to make the dough easier to work with and that comes out with more than just being really flaky as its strong point. Definitely recognize that it could be me, but I think the recipe's ratio of shortening to flour might be a little high.

I have been baking pies for 20 years.  I don't know what went wrong, but this was the worst pie crust I ever made.  When it's browned and cooked, it sticks to your fingers, like it's raw. It won't set.  Just a mess!  Doesn't taste very good either.  I prefer a pie crust with mostly real butter and a bit of shortening, much better flavor and texture. I am sticking with my recipe next time.

I guess you can't give a recipe a 0 rating.  Terribly greasy and will not set up.  The recipe is no easier than other crust recipes.  I will NEVER use it again.

Yes, it was light and flaky.  But it was a nightmare to roll out and get into the pie tin.  It was way too sticky and ripping constantly.  I didn't even use all of the water it called for and added tons of flour in the rolling process.  I did manage to roll it and get it into the tins with the help of parchment paper.  But it was way too troublesome and took an hour to roll, just to end up with a basically flaky but tasteless crust.

This recipe does not get 5 stars from me because it needs several modifcations to get it right. For example, you should NOT use all the water they indicate in the recipe. I started out by using the 1/2 cup water suggested and the dough came out super liquid-had to do it all over again (by the way, the small print indicating "use less water if needed" does not help, because most of us do not see such small notations to begin with.  The actual recipe should be changed to reflect this). I also recommend not being shy about the amount of flour used to manage the dough. After 3 tries, I finally got it right-so I suggest reading through all the reviews first before tackling this recipe!

I chilled everything and let the dough balls sit in the fridge for about 6 hours. I rolled it between sheets of plastic wrap (which worked ok but I hate doing that.) I peeled and poked and prodded and nudged and could NOT get it on my pie properly. EDIT: In going back through my reviews I decided my previous review was rude and have edited it to reflect a less rude tone. 7/27/10

I knew better than to use 1 cup shortening for 2 cups flour the flour to lard ratio is all wrong. I didn't want an oil crust for a fresh fruit pie.

Do not refrigerate this over night! What a mistake!! I was making it ahead of time but the next day it tore when trying to roll it out.. It was awful!  And this recipe does not make enough for two pies. We were able to put both halfs of the dough together and make one crust. The crust came out a little thick, but luckily, it worked.
Taste was good - prep was horrible.

The crust was way too soft and didn't turn out at all.  I think it needs 1/4c to 1/2c more flour

I do not know how this recipe got 5 stars. The only reason I even gave it 1 star was for flavor. It called for way too much water, which caused it to shrink so that I had no sides to my pie. Also, it was moist, not flaky.

This is the worst recipe I have EVER tried!  Although I followed the recipe exactly and chilled the dough 4 hours, I couldn't roll it out.  The dough kept sticking the the rolling pin and breaking apart.  I had to throw the mess out.

So I tried this Christmas morning, and while it rests in the refrig, some helpful tips for the bakers that will follow.  Its tempting to do this recipe by the book when you see all the rave reviews its gotten, but if you do, you'll find yourself sharing the opinion of the poor woman(man?) who reviewed just before me.  Do yourself a favor, sub half the shortinging for butter, if your butter is salted use less salt (i used roughly 3/4's a teaspoon) and MUCH less water.  I mixed mine with cold butter, so I had to do it by hand (dont you think it tastes better when you put in the effort and really feel the dough?  I do!) and it reached balling consistancy WITHOUT water.  It was pretty thick, so i put in a few small splashes of water (about a teaspoon, perhaps a bit more depending on your mix) and worked that in by hand as well.  I plan on letting it sit for about three hours or so, maybe a little more.  ((Edit!!!!  Still a good recipe, but yah, the gooy appearance of the dough with all that water really threw me off, put in the half cup, if you dont when you go to roll it out it breaks all over the place, i had a heck of a time with mine, i ended up having to free form instead, as i was pressed for time.  It still came out beautifully though.))

I have a terrible time trying to roll out this crust. It rips apart when I try to put it into the pie pan. I can only use it for pies that only have a bottom crust because I have to piece it together by hand and press it into the pan. My husband loves the flakiness of it though.

Alright, ive made this recipe at least 15 times in the past month (preparing for a 4th of July baking contest -- I won!) after trying various ratios of these ingredients the perfect combination I found is to keep everything the same EXCEPT leave out 1 tbsp of shortening (use butter flavored shortening) and as others have suggested chill everything, bowl, spoons, pastry fork, etc. 
Using the full amt of shortening makes this dough too fragile to work with, and leaving out two tbsp makes it gross like grocery store crust, but leaving out just that one tbsp makes this crust flaky and delicious and easy to work with -- I even perfected a latice top!

I would NEVER make this pie crust again. Took me nearly half an hour to try to roll it out but the dough just keeps on breaking apart. I ran out of patience at the end and just roughly pushed the dough up the sides of my pie pan. It tasted just okay.

I must have done something horridly wrong with this recipe. All I got was goo. I tried it in the food processor, after just two pulses and no water added it was goo. I tried it by hand and it came out goo. I did not add the full amount of water. The second try I added much more flour and finally was able to get it rolled out, it would not come free of either wax paper or plastic wrap. I just pieced it together the best I could. I rechecked the amounts for flour and shortening thinking I had read something wrong but that wasn't the case. Shortening was chilled and I used ice water. I'm giving the recipe three stars, I'm sure it's a fine recipe. I just wish I could figure out what I did wrong with it.

This was a great recipie! And was the first time I had made homemade pie crust. The only changes I made were using 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening instead of 1 cup of shortening. I put the dough in the fridge overnight before using it.

I was really disappointed in this crust. I tried to pre-bake this crust for just a few minutes to make it a bit more flaky after pie was done and it COLLAPSED half way down the side of the pie plate - too much butter!  Furthermore, I don't think this crust needed too be refridgerated for 4 hours.  It made the dough hard as a rock - again too much butter - and very hard to work with.  I don't think I'd use this recipe again.

I'm not giving it one star only because it's still in the oven and I'm not able to taste it yet. I have never made a crust from scratch and I just may have not have the "magic touch". I let it chill for 4 hours and I could not get it to roll out. It stayed sticky even after sprinkling the flour and I could barely get it into the dish. I hope it tastes good, but I may have to stick to Mrs. Smith's Ready Made Deep Dish.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but my crust did not turn out.  I followed the instructions exactly, but I didn't have enough crust to do two pies and it kind of fell apart when I baked it.  I may go back to Pillsbury! LOL

I used this recipe to make a turkey pot pie after Thanksgiving.  The crust was very doughy and fell apart easily.  It could have been my fault.  I may have overwork it a little. It was very sticky.  I tried adding more flour and it seemed to soak it all up. Overall, I was not too impressed.

As others have stated, the dough was not easy to work with.  I managed to get the top crust on the pie pretty well, so it looked O.K. (the bottom one was a mess).   Seems like a lot of water for a pie crust to me, so next time, I'll use less and see what happens.  On the positive side, it was very tender, flaky, and delicious for a fruit pie.

Does the job, but ended up very flaky and wasn't able to retain any shapes. (I had cut out leaves and wiped them in egg wash). Application of eggwash basically made it all fall apart in the oven.

I'm sorry but this was not the best pie crust I have tasted. I was really optimistic because of all of the other good reviews, but it was a little disappointing. First of all, there wasn't enough pie crust to make 2 pies (maybe is works if you use very small pie tins). Secondly it was way too salty. If I made this again I would take out the salt and double the recipe.

I've baked pies for a number of years, and thought I would try a slightly different recipe.  But, mine did not work out well --- too sticky, and really not enough for a good 2-crust pie.  Sorry, I think I'll go back to my old recipe.

an excellent dough that assumes everyone has extensive knowledge of working with kinds of dough!  some hints that my help:  use ice water and add it 1 tablespoon at a time.  you will probably not need the entire 1/2 cup.  add enough till you have a manageable (not sticky or gloppy) dough.  i wrapped my 2 rounds of dough in plastic and froze for only 1 hour, then rolled out between waxed paper dusting each side of the dough with flour.  roll to appropriate size then freeze for 3-5 minutes, then carefully unmold the dough - dough side down, into pie plate, then carefully peel off the remaining wax paper sheet.  fill the crust, and follow the same directions as for bottom crust.  seal edges by crimping with the tines of a fork - trim dough edges, and prickn top crust with fork to create escape for steam.  bake as directed on a foil lined cookie sheet for easy handling.  a very butter dough and perfect with grandma opel's apple pie.

Um, tasty yet greasy crust and it did NOT cook well at all. I even pre-baked the crust for 15 minutes but it remained doughy through 1.5 hours of baking my quiche. I did not want to ruin the whole thing so I suffered with an under baked crust. If you aren't planning on baking your pie for 4 hours or so then pre-bake it well first. Bottom line: I will not be using this recipe again and I'll stick to the recipe on the Crisco box.

Yes the crust is light but more suitable for egg tart type of pie. I was doing Chicken pie so the crust turn out to be alittle disappointing. Further more the crust is really very cracky when you roll out.Its almost impossible to roll out a smooth piece even with a roller. I dont think I will use this for the next pie making.

It's got almost all the right ingrediants but the essence of real pie crust making is missing unfortunately. The results of this pie crust will be very variable depending on the weather (hot or cold).

It was runny and greasy - I had to add an extra 1 1/2 cups flour and I only used 1/4 cup water. In the end it couldn't be rolled and had to be pressed into the pie plate like a child would do. I will continue to use my mother's old recipe - I just thought I would try something quick since I was already using a recipe from this website.

I had a real problem with this recipe.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt it had way too much shortening.  I had an unworkable ball of dough before I added any water!   For my second try at some crusts,  I used my mixer, and added shortening until I had something between cornmeal and peas.  Then I added water to make a rollable dough.     Seems the secret is in the amount of shortening.  More makes flakier dough, but is harder to work.  Less shortening and more water, and the recipe starts to look like one for crackers!   I guess that with more experience and better technique, one can work with the high-shortening crust.  I'm not there.

I followed all directions and most suggestions.  I don't know what I did wrong, but this came out hard as a rock.  I don't own a food processor, so I just kneaded the dough by hand, which was very tiring heh.  I'll give it one more try since it's such a highly-rated recipe.

This is a GO TO pie crust! Excellent and flaky as promised...I read previous reviews and made some modifications too! Used Crisco flavored butter about 3/4 c, 1/2 tsp salt and 6tbs of ice cold water (added in 2tbs increments) Refrigerated for 1/2 an hour and it was ready to use! I rolled it out in between 2 sheets of waxed paper which made it so easy to handle and actually used powdered sugar to roll it out since I was making a black berry pie. Like I said my go to crust from now on! Excellent in every way!

this pie crust truely is the best pie crust ever!!!!! My husband LOVES it. So much in fact I have made 3 peach pies, a strawberry rhubarb pie AND a chicken pot pie with it in ONE WEEK!!!! i recommend mixing it all and throwing it in the freezer for 30 or 45 minutes and them rolling it out. i roll it out on floured wax paper that way I can flip the wax paper over and position it on the pie pan before removing it. bakes up great and taste so wonderful!!!

First time making pie crust! Made a few changes and it came out delicious: instead of 1 cup shortening-1/2C butter, 4 tbsp shortening, 1 tsp sugar and 2 tsp vinegar. It came out flaky and tender. Also, I brushed it with some egg/milk mixture before baking.

This is almost identical to the ONLY pie crust recipe i'll use. I HIGHLY SUGGEST using ICE WATER and COLD SHORTENING for this however. I keep my shortening in the fridge. Also add the water by tablespoons or you may end up with a dough that's too wet. VERY AWESOME PIE CRUST! I use slightly less shortening for my crust though. Delicate but VERY LIGHT AND FLAKEY! I also suggest rolling out the dough onto wax paper for easy transferring =)

I'll be the 1st to admit I'm not the best pie baker and I've always had issues with my crust but this was the worst recipe I've ever tried.  It was very unstable, when blind baking it lost all of it's shape and slid into a heap in my pie plate.  I followed the recipe exactly so I don't know what happened, but I won't be using this recipe again.  So I continue my search for the perfect pie crust recipe.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now with exceptional results.  One thing I've noticed from some of the reviews is that many people aren't letting it chill for the minimum 4 hrs or preferably overnight.  I've found that this step is crucial for being able to easily roll the crust.  Also, I don't exactly understand why, but if you use it right away, it does have a stronger shortening flavor.  When you let it sit overnight that flavor completely goes away.  Another key is not overworking the mixture.  Less really is more.  If you are getting tired working the mix by hand, you are working it way too hard.  When you cut in the shortening, add it in small chunks so it should only need a couple of stirs.  The other comments made about working with cold ingredients and tools are key as well.

This is the best pie crust I've ever made.  However, this really is a recipe for experienced bakers, as it requires a "feel" for the dough, patience and know-how to roll it out, and consideration of the type of filling which may affect the texture and flakiness of the crust.  Do NOT add all of the 1/2 c. of water if it starts getting too soggy, stop when it forms a ball (JUST like the recipe says!) Do NOT use butter unless you warm up the dough awhile before rolling out, or (DUH) it will crack.  If a food processor is used, use a light tough, as it will quickly form a ball even before water is added, and the result will be very sticky.  When rolling out, use a floured pastry cloth, and be generous with your flour (to a point).  After you roll from center to edge all four ways (just once!), use a pastry scraper to loosen the underside to the pastry circle to make it easier to flip over. Repeat this gentle rolling - and don't be afraid to pinch the edges back if they crack, you won't over handle it - until large enough to transfer to a pie plate.  This recipe IS enough for a two-crust pie, it's just that folks aren't able to roll each ball out large enough to fit.  In a nut shell (or pie shell), don't be afraid to make adjustments.  Cut back on the water if it's already too moist. Add some sugar if it's too blaa.  Try a different method of rolling out your dough.  I think this the flakiest crust I've ever tried and if it's bland, you have a blank canvas to add your personal mag

Pie crusts have ALWAYS been hard for me, especially the rolling out.  After many attempts with this recipe I found that two things helped most:
1) regrigerate the dough before rolling as directed, but NOT IN BALLS.  Use flattened balls or pancake shaped to refrigerate and the edges will crack less when rolling even if cold.
2) Roll out on floured plastic wrap, and don't be stingy with the flour.  At first I didn't want to "overflour" the crust, but it was impossible to roll out the dough without what I thought was a lot of flour (probably 3/4 cup for the top and bottom).  Even with a lot of flour it still turned out delicious and was CERTAINLY easier to manage, so flour away!

I don't really like this recipe... 1 C of shortening is a ridiculous amount.. I ended up just doing 1/2 c unsalted butter and 1/4 c shortening. It was so sticky even still. Had to only do about 1/8-1/4 c water.. Any more and it would have been soupy. Had to add more flour then.. Didn't bake it yet, but will update if necessary.. It's mediocre...

I have made this twice now and both times I had a perfect, flaky pie crust. Watching the video that all recipes provided on how to make a pie crust also helped. Put EVERYTHING in the freezer before using it-important tip!!

I made this precisely as written and unfortunately found it to be nearly impossible to work with. The crust would rip and tear at the slightest movement, making a lattice top nearly impossible. The taste was only 'ok'. I will need to keep looking.

This is a great pie crust recipe! I used lard instead of shortening and did what other reviewers suggested: (1) Making sure cold lard and ice-cold water were used; (2) Chilled the dough before rolling. The result was a super flaky crust! Definitely a keeper! Update: In my second attempt at this recipe, I added apple cider vinegar to the dough, one tsp as part of the liquid called for for every one cup of flour. The crust turned out to be more tender! Everyone raved about it. Will do this whenever I make pie crusts from now on.

Easiest crust I have ever made!  It freezes wonderfully and always comes out flakey.  My Grandmother was a professional pie maker back in her day (no exageration!) and my Dad said that this was the closest thing he has tasted since Gramma's pie crust!  HUGE compliment.  Thanks for the easy recipe. I will use it always!

I use this recipe every time I make a pie, and it turns out perfect every time.  The trick is to only mix the dough until it is just forming together - you should still see chunks of shortening.  I chill mine for at least four hours in plastic wrap, then I roll it out cold.  If you let it get warm before or while you are rolling it out, the shortening will start to assiilate into the dough, and your crust will be tough instead of flaky.

I am a avid cook and I have made a lot of pie crusts, some hard some simple. This by far is the best pie crust I have ever made and eaten. It goes to show some times a simple basic recipe is all you need. I only made two changes in this recipe( a first for me) the first is I used 1/2 cup of shortening and a 1/2 cup of cold butter and ice cold water and I only let it sit in the frig for a hour. I hope you will find success with it.

I've used this recipe for a few things: apple pie, apple rum tarts (I just used a mini-muffin pan and made tiny pies), and cherry pie pockets (just cut a cirlce, fill with cherry pie filling, fold in half and seal). The only changes I made was to use margarine instead of shortening (because I like a saltier crust with sweet fillings) and a lot less water, just enough to bring everything together. Also, I have a great tip to prevent overworking the dough: after mixing everything, roll it into a cylinder shape and chill, then slice off 1/4" slices and lay then in the pie pan. Smoosh the edges together to close the gaps. This works really well if you don't have a rolling pin or counter space for rolling out dough, and keeps you from handling it too much.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me not for taste, but rather simplicity and ease of use. It's also amazingly easy to remember. Scaled down (one pie crust) it's 1:1/2:1/4, 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup shortening, 1/4 cup water. I found that you only end up needing 1/4 cup water. Then of course the 1/4 tsp salt. The "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" tastes marginally better, but I'm a bigger fan of quick and easy. Besides, the focus in a recipe for me isn't the crust. The trick is to add the water little by little while mixing, and stop when your dough clumps together. Too much water will lead to a clumpy mess. Refrigeration isn't necessary. Also, cutting in the shortening with a pastry mixer is much easier. A pastry mixer is much like a potato masher, only it has 4-6 wires that cut through the shortening. With a back and forth motion, you end up with small granules quickly. I found one for $1 in a dollar store. Well worth the investment. This pie crust recipe works very well with pies or tarts (I had fantastic results with the English Butter Tarts recipe on this website).

Ive never had much luck with pie crust. 
This recipe is terrific! 
Even though I think I over-worked the dough after it was chilled, it still turned out light and flakey! Great taste too!
I will definetly use this recipe again!
Thanks for sharing Jean!
One thing I did that may save future users: Dont add all the water at once. 
It is a bit to much. 
I had to add more flour to make the ball. 
But again, even though I screwed up a few places it still turned out great!

I did not care for this recipe.  If you want to give it a try (and I wish I hadn't), here are some suggestions:  
First, decrease the salt by half or more.  It is virtually inedible as is!  
Second, do not use the liquid called for...only a few tablespoons are needed to make a (greasy) ball of dough that holds together.  
Third, if you refrigerate (and you should) then shape it into a disc, not a ball, or it will crack so badly when you roll it out, that it will take alot of time to patch.  (It is easy to patch).

This dough is not easy to work; it tears and crumbles easily.  Sadly, it is actually worse to bake with than to roll.    For pre-baked crusts, it is not sturdy enough to keep it's shape as it bakes and will slump back into the pie plate, like a pair of old socks that have lost their elastic.  Even browned, the crust retains this odd, soft texture and though flaky, it has an unpleasant "raw" feeling in your mouth.  If used as a crust for a baking pie, the rim will have the same soft, slouchy character and the bottom and sides will not set well enough to hold together when you serve the pie.  Also, forget crimping or twisting or any other decorative touches to your edges, as they will disappear as the heat breaks the dough down into a near liquid mass as it cooks.  
I bake several pies a week and like to try new pastry recipes from time to time and I was looking forward to making "the best pie crust ever".   The search continues.

I am an accomplished pie maker with excellent crust making skills.  Here is my suggestions, #1 use 1 1/3rd c Butter Crisco, #2 use WAY less water, #3 let it rest in the refridgerator for at least 1 hour before rolling out, #4 use powdered sugar instead of flour for rolling out the crust (Be Generous with the P. Sugar)

Though i agree this can be a difficult dough to work with, but the key is to keep flour on your hands when forming the dough or any other surface.  Also, the water should be ice cold.  I use the dough immediately, it doesn't have to be refrigerated. I've used this recipe for years and never have a problem, just remember this doughcan be rolled, but it's more of a press and shape recipe.  (and i don't add salt)

I did not care for this recipe. 1 cup of shortening -- REALLY?! This came out like cookie dough -- refrigerated it and everything. Couldn't use the rolling pin and didn't use the crust. Ruined my Christmas dessert. Don't use this recipe!

Something went horribly wrong, either in the recipe or my preparing of it, but I'll never use it again. Seemed like WAY too much shortening because it was unusable.

I followed the recipe exactly and the crust was extremely difficult to work with.  It was far too soft once rolled out even after refrigeration.  I rolled the crust in a pastry mat and placed it back in the refrigerator so it would harden up but all it did was rip and crack.  I've definitely used better recipes.

Delicious. It was a little too fatty for me (which is saying something), so I'm going to try cutting back next time. Considering that this is my first pie crust ever, I think it went wonderfully!

I tried all kinds of crust recipes before a friend gave me this one years ago.  None of the others that I tried had enough shortening or water and were impossible to roll out and have a good result. My mother gave up trying to make pies because of this.    Try this recipe, you will have good results just as it is written.  It is bland, that is what you want for a pie, the filling should be the star.  You can try putting it in the frig. after mixing it, but I have always had better results mixing, rolling, and putting it in the pan.  You can put it in the frig for a while after it is in the pan.    I have a pastry cloth that works very well for keeping the crust from sticking. I've had mine for years, I suppose they still make them, and they would be easy to make yourself.    If you don't have a pastry cloth or wooden counter to roll it out on I would use wax paper, I think it works better than plastic wrap.  Sprinkle some water on you counter and put the wax paper on that, the water keeps it from slipping.

This is a great recipe. Comes out perfect every time. I had to find a new recipe because I moved from a high altitude.  During the past year I've made at least 25 pies with this.  I chill everything,use ice water and definitely do not overwork the dough. Awesome recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  I used 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 shortening.  I also used a couple of TBLSP of sugar, but that is just a personal preferance.  As other reviewers have pointed out, everything (including shortening) should be chilled.  Use ice water, only pour in what is necessary for the proper consistency.  The dough should be soft but not tacky.  Don't overwork the dough!  I chill mine in the fridge for an hour before rolling out.  I roll out between two sheets of parchment paper. I then put the dough back into the fridge for about 10 minutes before shaping into the pie plate.  I have 2 Secrets For Pie Crust Success to share.  I use Wondra Flour (yes the kind you use for gravy -- you must sift it into the measuring cup first).  You can use pastry flour as well but it is not as readily available to the home baker.  Also, I always bake my crust on the bottom of the oven for the first 20 minutes of baking to guarantee I never have a soggy crust!  (Got that tip from the Pie & Pastry Bible!)

The instructions on this were excellent - the crust was easy to make and was flaky.  BUT, it had no flavor.  Since I used it with a pie, it needed sugar.  My husband went so far as to say it was bitter, but it was just blaaa...

I opted for a healthier version of this pie crust by using unsalted butter instead of shortening, which has lots of trans fat in it, and it turned out great! Still very flaky and tastes great! This is such a fool-proof recipe that you can't possibly mess it up, like mine got frozen while in the fridge because the fridge was so cold, and I just microwaved it for 15 seconds and it was good to go again.

I made an apple pie with this crust 3 times. The first time I only used it as a top crust. Everytime after that, I doubled up the recipe so I could have enough for both a bottom and a top crust. The last two times I baked a pie with this crust, tey turned out delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This crust is best for savoury pies -- like a chicken pot pie or a pumpkin pie (use a sweeter one for apple pies). I substituted the shortening with butter and it turned out okay -- if a little soggy during cooking. It's a nice, flaky crust.

I just don't know how to feel about this crust. Been trying for weeks to find the right pie crust for Grandma Ople's apple pie, which is outrageously good. I've mastered the pie filling, making my own apple sauce to stir into the caramel. I've mastered the lattice construction, no small feat for one as coordination-challenged as myself. Not happy with the various crusts I've tried. Like others stated, this one is flaky and light. Just not sure about the taste and borders on greasy, and I took suggestions and used half butter and half shortening. It still tastes of full shortening. No one in the family complained, but I knew what I was looking for and didn't quite get at. I will keep it, as it did accomplish the flakiness I couldn't get with the others I've tried. I'll try it with full butter next time or keep reading reviews for tips to perfect. Better than average.
*Update: it's been some months and I happened to try this crust again, with half butter half crisco baking sticks, just like before.  The only thing I did different was used it on an apple berry pie from this site as well. I don't know what happened, maybe because it's dead of winter now, I don't know, but this crust was perfect! I've done it 4 times now for two pies, top and bottom crust. I don't know what to say, but I retract my previous concerns because this is the crust I've been looking for! I did a whole top crust this time, instead of lattice. Maybe that helped. My apologies for mediocre review before!

This is fairly accurate to my family's tried and true, pie crust. If you work the crisco into the flour with a fork until it looks like peas, before adding the water a spoonful at a time, it shouldn't be too greasy.

Ok, so i read the good and the bad reviews and decided to give it a chance... big mistake! I use to have a recipe for pie crust buy i lost it so i think why not? it's look easy and with good reviews. I put everything on the freezer first (i always do that when making pie crust) and did it step by step. It was just to difficult to work with because a cup of shortener is too much!!! I will never ever try this recipe again and i really can't recommend it to anyone, sorry.

I used to buy the roll out pillsbury crusts before I found this recipe. I haven't bought pie crust since. This pie crust is perfect every time. I use butter flavored Crisco and I add 1 T. of powdered sugar if I'm using the crust for a dessert. It sound like a lot of shortening, and it will feel sticky before you chill it. If you forget to make it in advance, putting it in the freezer for 15 min. works fine. Thank you for this recipe. I've been baking for 40 years and will never use another recipe.

I have been making some  good pies for years now.  I usually used the crust recipe from my 1976 Better Homes New Cook Book.  The last couple pies I made I used this recipe and the difference in taste was incredible.  I will not use another recipe again!

I have been making my own pie crusts for several years. I can pretty much do it myself, but I like to pull up a recipe to keep myself organized. I want to urge anybody who is making a pie crust to rethink this recipe. There is FAR too much shortening, which makes the resulting dough too greasy and difficult to work with. I recommend finding a recipe that calls for the appropriate one-third shortening to flour ratio instead. I have been an all-recipes member for years, and this is my first one star review.

I've never been a good pie crust maker, but this one is easy and turns out perfect every time. UNLESS you, like me, decide to be lazy one day and make it with a stand mixer. Then it turns out greasy and with a horrible flavor. I think maybe that's what happened with the few low ratings this recipe has received. But I've made this recipe many, many times by hand mixing it and it's always wonderful.

1/2 as much lard as flour, 1/2 as much water as lard and a t. of salt! THIS is the recipe handed down thru my family from my great grandmother.....Just funny finding it on here...BEST! Flaky, melt in your mouth, flavorful.

I used this recipe and it was great. A good tip to keep in mind: is to use everything COLD! Even the knife to half the dough with. I put an ice in the water to keep it chill and I only used half butter & half shortening. I actually didn't have enough of the shortening but it still came out great. Also, keep in mind not to work on it too much since it will toughen the dough. When rolling the dough I put it between platic wraps to keep from sticking. You can also put flour but the plastic wraps worked wonders for me.

I made this exactly as written.  I added the water with my KitchenAid.  I didn't even take the time to chill it, and it was wonderful.  Those people that didn't have it turn out right didn't do it right!  ;)  Hubby even liked it, and that is worth 5 stars in itself!

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at pie crust.  The recipe is fast, simple and just about fool proof.  It baked up very nicely ~ flaky & tender.  I've rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because in dividing it in half as it says, my crust seemed to be very thin by the time I rolled it out for my pan.  Next time, I think I'll make 50% more dough before dividing it in half and see if that's enough for a more substantial crust.

Please notice reviews don't have any suggestions like most do.  This is a really bad pie crust.  I was in a jamb christmas eve and went looking for recipe. I have almost the whole pie in the fridge.  Still looking for alternatives, might try adding tbs or so of sugar.  My complaints were it was powdery and tasteless. If in a jamb like me, I think it would have been ok to eat if made really thin and let pie juice/filling set in and flavor some.  Do not make thick!

Too much shortening. I saw someone else's post and didn't believe them. I still made the crust and it was okay to handle after refrigerating overnight. It ended up tasting a little too chewy.

Here's a tip for lattice crusts: chill the dough in the fridge for a few hours, then roll it out, cut your strips and build your lattice on a sheet of wax paper. Put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. When you take it out, just center the crust on top of the pie and peel off the wax paper.

I found using a TBS of white vinegar  makes it even easier to roll and does not effect the flavor.  Also for those that have problems with working the dough, not all flours are the same so you may need more.  one said they used butter.  Butter has a different temperature to turn solid than shortening.  I find butter works better at a warmer temperature in dough.

This pie crust is perfect.  I use butter because I hate the taste of crisco.  I have NO problems with this dough being sticky or harder than other crust dough to deal with.  You do have to make sure you refrigerate it or it is soft and sticky (as with all pie crust).

I made the crust by the recipe, except that I used 50/50 butter blend which was the closest thing to "butter" that we had. It turned out perfect; a tiny bit tough to handle (chilled for 1 hour) but the flavor and flakiness were just right for us. This really made my pie.

This was my second time making this recipe, and I think it turned out really well.  I used half shortening, and half butter, and the crust came out really flaky and buttery.  The first time I used all butter, and I think it came out tasty, but not flaky enough.  This was a good balance, but next time, I'll try to follow the recipe exactly to see what happens.  Still trying to perfect my technique, but I'm getting there!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely use it again!!

This is the best pie crust I have ever made.  I use half C. butter half C. shortening. It is delicious!! Very easy to make.  I roll it out slowly, between 2 pieces of wax paper with a little flour sprinkled on paper and top of dough, it does not stick this way, and it is very easy to place in pie dish and on top of pie!  Thank you.

Pretty darn good.  I read some of the reviews that only gave this crust one star.  They said it was hard to work with, but the solution is flour and patience my friend.  That is the trick to great, flaky pie crust.  Just take time rolling it out, and sprinkle a little flour on the dough if it starts sticking to the rolling pin or ripping.  Make sure you sprinkle the working surface with flour too.  It says refrigerate for 4 hours, but I just usually stick it in the freezer for a half an hour.  Well, good luck.  ***Oh, and I kind of think that all the Crisco isn't so healthy, but hey, we all deserve to indulge once in a while.

I have finally found a pie crust that my fussy husband likes.  I do 1/2 c shortening and 1/2 c salted butter instead of the full cup of shortening.  I do this for the coloring it adds to the crust.  A tip I have used for years is place the shortening/butter in a 1 cup glass measuring cup and place in the freezer for 1 hr.  I will get everything else ready in the meantime.  I take a glass of ice cubes and place water in.  Right when I am ready for the water I pour it out into the glass measuring cup I used for the shortening.  Nice and cold.  I am able to mix, roll and bake in a matter of 10-15 mins.  I totally by-pass the whole chilling in the refrigerator.  This also it the easiest crust to work with.  Thanks for sharing what has become a keepsake recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exact, except I used butter instead of shortening cause that is all I had, and I ended up using 1 cup of water instead of half of a cup, but it still turned out great even though I wasn't really sure because I didn't have a pastry cutter so I had to do the best I could without melting the butter with a wisk to cut it up into small pieces, that probably weren't small enough.  But the crust was super flaky and tasted good, my first pie crust EVER that turned out so good.  I used it in a Turkey Pot Pie.  I would love to make the crust again but maybe using less fat...but I don't know if it would turn out as good.  Other then that, great recipe, even for beginners like me :)

I have always heard how hard pie crust is to make but with this recipe it was so easy and turned out wonderful! I used butter instead of shortening because it's what I had, and it was great!

Truly the best ever.  Do follow the "conventional wisdom" of pie crust making (cold ingredients, etc.)  This is my go-to pie crust, thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a good pie crust recipe that tastes great. However, I suggest that you let it chill over night and roll it out while it is still cold and between 2 pieces of wax paper. If you do this, it's easy to form it into a pie pan and put a top crust on it.

Very Good recipe, very flaky and buttery. Used half shortnening and half butter, needed to make a pie tonight so I didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge overnight, I just put it in the freezer until it got firm but not hard.  Will use this for every pie from now on!

This was really an easy and yummy pie crust, it came out really good. After making the doug i`ve placed it in a bag in the freezer for about an hour instead of 4 hours in fridge. Super nice. Will make again!

I nailed it!!!!!!  This was my very first time ever making a pie crust and I am soooo proud of myself.  I couldn't ask for a better pie crust.  I took the reviewers advice and used 1/2c. butter and 1/2c. shortening instead of 1c. shortening, and chilled everything.  I chilled the bowl, pastry blender, shortening, and butter and added 1Tbs. ice water at a time.  I didn't change the amount of salt and mixed with a fork instead of my hands to keep less heat from the dough.  I was nervous because my boyfriend is a pie lover, but he gave me thumbs up on the crust.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I can't wait to tackle my next pie, apple.

I tried this pie crust yesterday..It was amazing I followed others and put my bowl in the freezer and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shorting also putting them in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes, I put my water in the freezer too, and cut the salt by 1/2. I was in a rush so I seperated the finished product and put it in the freezer for 30 mins and it rolled out the best pie crust I have ever made and so easy to work with. It was flaky and the taste was out of this world. THANKS for a great recipe.

This is actually a really good base crust. I put a little twist into it though, if I'm making quiche for example I add a little bit of powder garlic, oregano and parmesan cheese to the crust or if I'm making apple pie I add a little bit of cinnamon, for key lime pie I add a little bit of sugar, maybe a little bit of grated coconut. It great! ;)

The best pie crust as of yet!! I bake quite a bit and have been doing it my whole life. I gotta say...pie crust is not an easy task, one wrong move and it's over. This was fantastick, I scooped the flour out of the bag instead of spooning it in. This gives you just a touch of more flour then the spooning method used for cakes where you need it to remain light. I also noticed that it called for a T. or so of too much water. Every flour is different start with 1/3 C. and go spoon by spoon after that till it holds. DO NOT KNEAD!!!! It came out super flakey and light. By far the best I've ever made. Only thing was it took a while to brown, more then most other pie crusts.

This recipe is great! The crust is so soft and flaky and losen and it's very easy to work with. I just found out that 1 tsp of salt was a little too much. I've reduced it to 1/2 tsp and it turned out to be perfect. After all, this is the best and simplest recipe for pie crust. Try it, and you will never use another recipe for pie crust again!

My grandma has repeatedly tried to teach her pie crust recipe but it does not involve measurements.  This recipe tastes just like it and takes some of the anxiety out of making it.  I always make 1.5-2 times the recipe for pies with lattice (my favorite) or covered crusts and roll it out a little thicker to avoid the heartache of ripping the crust during assembly.  When your pie has about 5-10 minutes to go, brush the top crust with milk or an egg wash and sprinkle white sugar on top for a nice touch.

I have always been afraid to make a pie from scratch because everyone tells me how difficult it is to get them to turn out.  I made this twice in a row and it was wonderful.  I made two for thanksgiving and I didn't bring either one home!!  I did find the dough a little difficult to work with the time I left it in the fridge overnight. I warmed it in the microwave for 35 seconds and it was much easier... I do reccomend only cooling it for the 4 hours.  GREAT recipe, thanks!

An excellent pie crust recipe.  I would like to note that the 4 hour refrigeration (or the 10 minutes in the freezer) simulp zerves to make the dough less sticky and easier to roll out and use.

This pie crust came out great!  I did modify the recipe a little though:  flour and salt the same, 1/2 cup crisco, 1/2 cup butter (very cold), 1/4 cup ice water + 1 tablespoon cider vinegar + 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 cup sugar. I used a food processor and handled the dough as little as possible.  It came out awesome - tender, flaky and buttery!  I made an apple pie so i also did an egg wash (egg yolk brushed on upper crust) and sprinkled w sugar - it came out beautiful!

After decades of trying all kinds of pie crust recipes and never getting it "right", this one is my keeper forever.  When you first prepare it, it comes out horribly sticky and you'll be thinking, "Yuk".  I thought I must have added way too much water, but I didn’t.  No need to change the recipe.  Just measure carefully and refrigerate.  Thoroughly chilling the dough is imperative.  I especially enjoyed the elasticity when rolling it out.  It didn’t dry up on me, and I had no cracks to repair.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you!

This is the easiest and best pie crust I've ever made. I follow the recipe exactly unless I'm rushed. for fruit pies I add a few tablespoons of sugar. turns out beautiful every time. fattening yes, most pie crusts are.

I made this recipe for the first time today and followed it exactly as written, except that I only rested the dough for about 30 minutes in the fridge. Leaving it the full time will only make easier to roll, although I had no problem rolling it after only 30 minutes. One negative reviewer believed that there is too much shortening, but I don't agree. It's pretty standard in crust recipes and it wasn't hard to handle at all. I would suggest if you are a novice pie maker you need to use some tips to help you, such as chilling the fat first (I didn't do thatbut it never hurts) but I do typically place the cut-in flour/fat mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes or so BEFORE adding the water, while I work on the filling. I always put ice cubes in the water and chill it very cold, and then sprinkle it on a bit at the time, because it will not always take as much as the recipe calls for and it may take more a little more sometimes. I never touch the dough until it can pretty much be formed into a ball with your spoon or spatula you mixed it with. The less you touch it the more tender it will be.

I agree with the other 1 star reviewer-- this dough recipe was too shortening dense!  I could not roll it out without cracks and splits.  It fell apart when I tried to put it in the pie tin, and it felt greasy.

This was a gooey, gloppy...mess.  I thought it sounded like a lot of water but I was in a hurry and followed the recipe exactly.  Then had to add about 50% more flour to make it workable.  It has the consistency of dumplings, not pie crust.

I did not care for this recipe. Way too much shortening and salt.  Even my regular pie crust doesn't have that much water in it. I was disappointed.

I followed advice of other reviewers to make sure "everything" is chilled first & substituted shortening for butter which I cut up and put into freezer.  Dough was easy to make and very tastey & flakey when used for my beef pot pie that I baked tonight.  fyi: i also followed reviewer's advice to roll out dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap.. this worked perfectly! -thank you!  **** UPDATE: just made this again, and did not chill anything.  However, here are the changes I made: sifted the flour & used only 3/4 cup shortening; after 4 hrs dough rolled out perfectly w/o use of plastic wrap. I posted a photo this time. (after cooking the crust was perfectly flaky, not greasy at all). Thanks again for this recipe Jean!!

The flavor of this pie crust was admittedly good. However, it is really hard to work with. Having tried a lot of different crusts, I can honestly say that this was the worst I've made. It had way too much shortening and it didn't hold up at all. Even after I refrigerated it, it was greasy and difficult to work with. If I attempt it again, I'll make sure I open all the kitchen widows and start with chilled shortening.

Perfect crust every time. It is so easy! I rolled it out between plastic wrap and even cut strips for the lattice with kitchen sheers while the dough was between the wrap. So fast, so easy. Great after having been frozen, as well.

This really IS the BEST EVER Pie Crust..I followed the recipe exactly as written...I used my food processor (no I didn't prechill the food processor) and put all the ingredients the recipe calls for in it...yes I had to use my spatula to scoop up the dough (it was extremely soft).....I wrapped it in two bundles and refrigerated it for about an hour...I then put waxed paper on the table and unwrapped one of the bundles...I added more flour to the pile of dough (maybe 3/4 of a cup worth)...in anycase..the dough rolled out beautifully and it was so easy. IF you need to add more flour don't hesitate...it WILL WORK OUT... I am a 69 year old cook and I have always had problems making pie dough...till now that is...THIS IS GOING TO BE MY RECIPE from now on whenever I decide to make a pie...THANK YOU so much Jean for sharing this recipe...as I said earlier, this really is the BEST EVER pie crust...making this pie dough makes pie baking really really easy...(smells so good when it's baking as well)

The crust was really good tasting. Unlike other crusts, it wasn't so dry that you had to use a bunch of techqniques to get it in a pan... I simply picked it up and dropped it in. I'd definetly recommend this to anyone for any pie. It isn't too sweet or salty. It is perfect and if I were you, I'd use it too.

This is a great pie crust recipe, that being said i dont agree with the 1/2 cup of water called for in this recipe i used probably a 1/4 of a cup water maybe a little more  and made sure it was cold.  I also dont blend the flour salt and shortening until smooth it should still have a semi dry texture when the water is added.  
 Refrigerated , rolled between sheets of parchment paper and then refrigerated again. This gave me a super flaky pie crust

I don't even know what to say about this recipe. The reviews are so conflicting, I wanted to believe that it was 4 1/2 stars, but like the first commenter, its just horrible. I couldn't even roll it out. I'm an accomplished baker (not too many pies though), i've never had this much of a problem with a crust before. I followed the directions to a T! I wonder if it has anything to do with humidity? I just can't figure out how anyone could get this recipe to work, it was just a wet mess for me.

This is the exact recipe my mother-in-law uses and she ALWAYS gets asked to make the pies for any functions.  There is not too much fat at all in the recipe.  Give this a recipe a chance.  I firmly believe that pie crusts take practice, perfect crusts do not happen overnight.

I love this pie crust. It's super easy and the taste is plain and simple. If you don't have saran wrap you can place the dough in a small plastic container while you leave it in the fridge to cool. The recipe says wait 4 hours but I usually only have time to wait 1 hour and I've successfully made quite a few pies with it, so 1 hour seems to be okay.  Don't forget the water! I did and added it after all the other ingredients were mixed and it came out kind of iffy.. haha. I was only able to add half of the amount of water it required and it was difficult rolling it out. I was out of Crisco so I went with it. I was careful and it was successful but definitely don't forget the water!

I was never pleased with my pie crust until I tried this one. Flakiest crust I ever made. I rolled them out between plastic wrap, then wrapped and froze them for the holidays. They did tear easily when I was putting them into the pan but that isn't a problem with a one-crust pie. And considering the consistent flakiness of this crust I'd say it's a decent trade-off.

Just baked my first ever pie with this amazing crust! I did everything exactly as suggested in the recipe and it was perfect - I used Crisco for the shortening and it worked out really well. And I used cold water from my fridge, adding about a tablespoon at a time, it turned out perfectly. It's really just so flaky and delicious! I'll use this recipe for my future recipes to come, thank you so much for sharing! :-)

I've made this recipe many times. Instead of using all shortning, I use 3 tbsp of shortning and 3 tbsp butter. Gives the crust a nice buttery taste. The crust taste homemade and I like that. I have used this recipe for sweet pies and also chicken pot pie. Best recipe I've come across yet.

I used this recipe twice, with HUGE success, then lost it and used the Crisco recipe which calls for more flour and less water.  BIG MISTAKE.  If you make this recipe EXACTLY as written, REFRIGERATE--there is none better.  Save this recipe, follow exactly, and you will wonder why you ever used pre-made crust or another recipe.

This crust is way better then the one I've been using for the past 20 years! I think it's the extra shortening. It was light, flaky and perfect with my homemade pumpkin pie!

This recipe has a good guide for the amount of ingredients to use. As others have suggested, I used 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter. However, as many pie recipes recommend it is good to freeze the shortening (or butter) before use and use very cold water (I suggest using ice water and adding with a spoon slowly). If you have never made pie before it is useful to watch videos on how to make pie crust because this will really help you understand what to do..... But my crust came out delicious and yummy!!

This is a good, basic pie crust recipe. I first used it ten years ago when I first started making pie, thinking that I would switch to another, more complicated recipe once I got the basics down. I've since worked for a short time as a baker and tried more complicated pastry recipes, but for home-baking, this is my go-to pie crust recipe. Make sure your shortening is not too warm, and your water is cold, and you should be good to go.

I loved this recipe as it was so easy.  I am not a baker so I wanted it short, fast and simple.  The first time I made it, I was making a vegetable pie and it came out perfect.  The next time I was making a more savory pie and I split the shortening in half and the other half was with unsalted butter and it came out yummy.  You can't go wrong with this winner.

This pie crust is very forgiving.  I consider myself an expert chef, who had never done a pie crust right. I made this, and even though I over processed it (too much water,too), it was great. The dough was a bit sticky due to the above, so I rolled it out between layers of wax paper that I had floured.

I used cold butter instead of shortening, and I ran the cube through the cheese grater so it would mix better.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the crust.  It was fantastic!!  Oh, I also only let it chill for 2 hours.

I've always had my issues with homemade pie crust but this was very easy. I used a 1/2 cup of butter flavor crisco and a 1/4 cup of butter. (That's all I had) It still turned out wonderful. I also found I did not need all of the water. Mine came together with just 1/4 cup.

Made this crust to use with Grandma Ople's Apple pie recipe. Thank you for taking the "scary" out of pie crust from scratch. I used half shortening/half butter...doubled the recipe and it could not have been easier and OMG flaky and delicious!! This rivals my Mom's pie crust...always the flakiest most delicious crust...stand aside Mom! ;-)

I think this was the easiest and best crust I have ever made. I only had it in the fridge for 4 or so hours and it rolled out perfectly. Excellent!

Absolutely delicious!!! The flavor is just perfect. I made this one time before, and today I made it again. But this time, I used about a 1/4 cup of shortening and 3/4 cup of unsalted butter. But that was only because I didn't have enough shortening. But I think I will do it like that from now on, because it just tastes so delicious. I think the butter helps a lot. I had a hard time rolling last time, so this time I followed someone else's tip here and placed plastic wrap on the table, then I floured it. This made rolling out the dough a snap.

First pie crust I've ever made!  I used spelt flour instead of wheat and it was still one of the yummiest crusts I've ever had!

I have used this recipe 3 times now and it has always turned out great. I used butter all three times instead of shortening and I put the dough in the freezer for 20 minutes since I never plan ahead. This worked really well. The crust is always tasty and flaky.

I seem to be in the minority with a 3 rating but this crust just tastes too much like shortening. It does have good points, flaky, light, etc. but the taste is not there.   I have been a master pie baker for years and won many awards so will go back to using my normal lard, vinegar, egg recipe.   Sorry again for the negative rating - guess we all have our preferences.   P.S. I feel this is a good crust for a novice baker because it is difficult to go wrong when everything is chilled.   I only like a pie crust that is paper thin and it does not work with this recipe.

This recipe is awesome!Very flaky, I didn't have time to chill it for 4 hours so I flattened the dough as much as I could in a large baggie, and froze it for about 30 minutes and it worked perfectly.

This was my first attempt at making crust and it came out pretty well.  I used all butter instead of shortening.  The flavor was good but I think if I was to make it again with butter I would probably only use about 3/4 cup.

I always automatically double the recipe 'cause it's easier to trim off what I don't want than it is to stretch and pray. 

(I add about a tablespoon of lemon zest to the flour before I do anything. No one knows where that taste comes from, but it makes you want to slap your mama for never telling you it was going to be this good.)

This makes a nice pastry crust but I added spices to the dry mixture. Depending on what pie I am making depends on the spice. I use cinnimon for apple and nutmeg for pumpkin. Gives the crust a nice flavor.

This recipe was a life saver at Thanksgiving! My sister was in charge of making the pie crusts, and she swore that she remembered how Grandama used to make them. Good thing I had printed this recipe off months earlier. It saved us from having to go buy a box of pie crusts. I think this recipe was even better than grandma's and turned out so light and fluffy. Thanks so much for sharing!!

No doubt, the best pie crust recipe. I just added 1 stick of butter flavored Crisco instead of regular like one review said to do. The best!!!

This recipe was ok. For some reason my pie crust didn't need all the shortening. I probably only used 3/4 of it. I chilled everything including the forks and I let the dough chill in the fridge for about 6 hours. When I was rolling it the crust seemed a little too moist still and I did have some problems with it tearing and falling apart. It did taste great though and baked up very nice. Much nicer than I expected considering it kept breaking. I might try this again with even a little less water. It could have been because it is so humid here though. Thanks!

I have never, ever been able to make pie crust from scratch. With your recipe I was successful. I used it for the min chess pies on this site and didn't have time to refrigerate, so I fput the two halves in freezer for 30 minutes and voila!! perfect pie crust. thank you!!

This was the first time I'd ever made pie crust, and it came out really well.  I froze the 2nd crust because I only needed one at the time, but I just used the 2nd crust for another pie and it froze really well, and it was still very easy to work with.

I have tried and tasted other recipes for pie crust and this one is always the best.  I know butter tastes wonderful in crusts, but is doesn't present the flakeness that Crisco does.  To me eggs in the recipe only make the crust leathery.  I know shortening isn't the best thing for your health, but once in a while, I believe it is ok.

Like other reviewers this was my first attempt at pie crust. Besides some problems stemming from my lack of a rolling pin, this turned out fabulously. It actually tastes quite nice (I don't really like pie crust) and is basically idiot-proof. I would follow the suggestion of chilling all tools before beginning, it made everything easier.

Everyone was right about this recipe.  It is very easy to make.  I chilled everything and used both butter and shortning.  I only used 1/4 cup of very cold water--After a couple of hours I rolled it easily in plastic wrap.

Even though I know shortening is supposed to give a better crust, I just couldn't bring myself to use it.  I even had it on the spoon and put it back in the container and used butter.  I also used half whole-wheat pastry flour; don't do that! :-)  I wasn't even going to review this because of my changes, but thought I would so someone else doesn't have to learn by trial!  Thanks, Jean!

I can comfirm that this recipe is 
very good.  I have been using this 
same recipe for years now.  It was 
given to me by a lady that did all 
the baking at my school, I'm 67  so you can see how long ago that has been. I would say try this recipe you will love it.

A classic. Funny, 3 weeks ago I had my 81 year old grandmother come over to teach me her pie crust recipe.  Hers have always come out fantastic.  This is just how she makes a crust, except that she turns on the kitchen faucet to a very fast drip and adds the water just a tiny bit at a time so as to not get the dough overly wet.

My sister and I are both chefs who have been looking for a good, flaky pie crust recipe for a long time.  This one exceeded our expectations.  The ingredient amounts were spot on and the consistency of the dough was perfect.  I've already added this one to my collection!

excellent crust recipe! I halved it, refrigerate overnight. Rolled it out and baked it for 5 min before filling. It came out crispy and lovely!

I love pie with a thick flaky crust and this recipe delivers! I used all of it in one pumkin pie thinking that I was going to regret it when it came out of the oven with an uncooked crust, but it turned out perfectly. I can't believe how easy yet tasty this crust is. I'm going to be making a lot more pies!!!

I have been making homemade pies for over 20 years. I have always used the tenderflake recipe which is very similar to this one, with the same ingredients but different proportions. I decided to try this one, based on all the rave reviews. Boy am I glad I tried it. It is sooooooo delicious and flaky, but also......it is VERY easy to work with, no holes or tears to patch, and also, can be very successfully made in the food processor (and not all crusts can!). I also re-rolled the left overs and they were also good, sometimes pastry is too tender to handle a second rolling and still be tender and flaky, this one can. I will use this recipe from now on. I would give it 10 stars, if possible. I used 1/3 cup ice cold water and froze the shortening in cubes because I was in a hurry and didnt have time to chill the dough, it worked great. Texture was perfect with 1/3 cup water.  Awesome!! Thanks!!

This was such an easy pie crust, and it turned out beautiful with my apple pie! I tried making it a 2nd time and needed to cook the crust before adding the filling but it didn't turn out so well. I recommend you don't bake the crust before putting your filling in. It works a lot better! Thanks for sharing Jean!

Very easy to work with, and came out very tender and flaky. I put a little bit of vinegar in with the cool water but made no other changes. I got lots of compliments on the crust.

Although the dough was a little sticky & tricky to work with - it was fine after a little refrigeration and a dusting of flour.  I used this to make an apple pie - which turned out pretty good. Thanks for the overall easy recipe.

I found when making pie crust, when adding the water I make little pockets in the flour/shortening and then I take a fork and just slightly mix it together and then I let it rest for a few minutes to jell before I clump it together and roll out. It seems to work pretty good for me.

This is DEFINATELY the best pie crust I've ever made... of course, it was also my first.  But that doesn't matter, it was flakey and delicious.  I must agree with some of the other reviewers, about half the water called for was perfect.

I've been making my own crust for years now, and this is the best crust recipe.  Add a bit of lemon juice (as mentioned in your web page) to the water so the dough doesn't turn tough.

I followed this recipe to a T - it's very good - good for a savoury (bacon and egg) pie, as well as a sweet one (Treacle Tart).  I doubled the recipe and froze the shells.  Used two this morning and they're great.  My husband even commented on how good the pastry was.  I'll be using this recipe again.  Thanks Jean Haseloh.

Definitely a bit hard to work with, hence the 4 stars, but I found it worth it in the end.  I'm not known for good crusts, so when this came out really good.... Well you can imagine my pleasure... Note: If you use salted butter or whatever, don't add the salt, or cut way back.... way... lol. My bad.

This was great! I did half/half butter and shortening, froze them both and then grated it, so much easier to combine, easy to handle and turned out very nice and flaky! Will be my new go-to piecrust for both sweet and savioury pies. Left out the salt, since I used salted butter.

Just finished making this recipe twice. I was baking 2 pies and some reviews were not so favorable so I decided to try one recipe first. I usually buy the frozen versions but now I'm retired and felt I really should have time to make my own crust. This recipe is perfect. I changed it by using 1/2 cup Crisco and 1/2 cup butter. Followed the hints and chilled everything first. I mixed as little as possible and only refrigerated one hour. It rolled out perfectly and the amount is exactly right for a 2-crust pie. Will definitely use this recipe from now on.

Was my mistake using Pastry Flour?  I was only able to use 2 tablespoons of water, and that was too much! It is now in the fridge, but my hopes are not high.  Must have been the pastry flour or too much shortening. It was a ball even before putting in the 2 T of water. Followed the recipe exactly and used chilled ingredients.

Just made this crust and it fell on the floor letting me see that the bottom of the "crust" was not a crust at all. More like a crumb crust rather than a flaky shell. Luckily, I've made a second pie with my own crust recipe and hopefully, the crust will stand up. This was WAY too much Crisco.

I made this last minute because I had extra pie filling.  Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the time to let the dough refrigerate overnight.  I chilled mine for about 30 minutes and it came out perfect!  It probably would've been even better if I chilled it longer.

I made this recipe with my Junior Girl Scouts at camp. They made the most delicious apple pie in a jar. This crust was easy for these very beginner cooks to make. Following basic pie dough directions of adding water a little at a time and not overworking the dough this crust came out flaky and tasty.  These ten year olds achieved what many cooks have difficulty with, making the perfect pie crust.

I also used it with my cooking club with women that have never made a pie. They got the same excellent results.

This recipe is a keeper and certainly going into the Troop cookbook!!

I have made dozens of pies and pie crusts over the years and I have NEVER had the problems that I experienced working with this dough.  I followed directions exactly and what I experienced was the most fragile dough I have ever worked with tearing and breaking apart as I was trying to lay the bottom crust in the pan.   When it came to the lattice top.....Argh!!!!  

It is presently baking so I can't comment on the taste however I have already vowed to myself to never try this recipe again.  I will revert back to the standard directions found on the packaging of the Crisco shortening.   I have never had problems with that and it has always turned out flaky, delicious, and MUCH easier to work with.   Additionally you can roll it out immediately as you don't have to refrigerate it for 4 hours.

Absolutely easy and great. I have always steered clear of making my crusts. Saw this simple one and thought I'll give it a try. I've made more than 10 of these and they never disappoint. I do use less salt.

This is fairly close to my Grandmother's recipe, which I have use all of my life.  The difference being, 3/4 cup of shortening to 2 cups of flour.  Much less greasy.  We like a thin crust, so this is perfect for a double crust.  Those who thought it too greasy, try it with 1/4 cup less shortening.  It really is the best crust.

I have not found a better dough recipe! Every time I use this to make pie, it's raved about. Also used this to make biscuits for bbq cups.

Loving the food processor idea, thanks! never touched my pastry cutter & less mess! I cut the recipe in half for use in bottom of a crisp, and used butter not shortening, and my mom's addage: add water 1 tablespoon at a time, you won't need it all!

This is a very handy recipe.  I'll have to add more water in next time I use it -- the dough ball was a bit rough and therefore harder to flatten and roll out with my pin.  But it still made a very nice crust for my pie filling!  Thank you!

Thank you Jean! This is an awesome recipe! I compbined your Pie Crust with APPLE PIE by Grandma Ople and it was outstanding!
I did make a few minor changes to the receipe...I put the shortening in the freezer for  1 hour then cut it in cubes then cut it in to the flour with a pastry cutter. I also found that when i refrigerated the dough it was not as good as when I used it immediately...I have used your recipe about 6 times now. One last thing...I beat a whole egg and brush it on the crust for a picture perfect crust.

I made the mistake of using salted butter the first time I made this because I didn't have time to make a run to the grocery store. As a result, the crust was a little too salty for my taste but perfect in texture all the same. 

I used butter instead of shortening which works quite well. Cutting the butter into small cubes and popping it in the freezer for a few minutes really helps if you don't have a pastry cutter (I used two knives instead to cut the fat into the flour mixture).

Two things you must make sure of when making this crust if you use butter: that everything stays cold (even the water I used had ice chips in it) and that you do not overwork the dough. Both these tips ensure the flaky texture one loves so much about pie is the end result.

The crust tastes good, but because there is so much shortening in it, it melts down the sides of the pie dish leaving part of the sides without any crust.

I revolt against measuring the ingredients for anything because most baking/cooking really isn't an exact science. Identical measurements can work one day and not the next. It's not you or the recipe's fault. That said, thank you so much for the tips about chilling. I have avoided using so much fat (any kind) in a pie crust since the last greasy attempt, but my crusts are never flaky. Hardened fat is exactly what I needed. You are awesome.

I used Crisco stick (butter flavor). I dusted wax paper (and the top of the dough) with flour before rolling it out. I also used a silicone roller from Pampered Chef and it worked like a dream. My crust was flaky, delicious, and very easy to handle!

I have been baking a lot of pies lately, and have been working on further perfecting my crusts. Using this recipe as a base, I've made the best so far, so tender and flaky. The dough is a little tough to work with, but that's absolutely necessary for a flaky crust. I did make some modifications. I used 1/2 cup chilled shortening and 1/3 cup chilled butter. Used enough ice water to achieve the right "crust" consistency. I keep the dough in the fridge while preparing the filling, and roll it out right before needed. I usually brush the crust with egg white and bake for 3-5 minutes before filling.

I confess I have never made pie crust before. But I make scones, so I understand not overworking the dough, etc. I thought I would try this crust. It seems similar to the one my mother made when I was a kid. I thought it was a lot of shortening, but I used it.  I used self-rising flour, so I left out the salt.  I did add about 1/4 cup more flour as I worked in the shortening, and I used ice water, only adding as much as it took to hold it all together, which was nearly 1/2 cup. I chilled it 15 min in freezer, then 15 in fridge. The first half was sticky and a little hard to handle. The second half, that extra five minutes in the fridge made it very easy.  I made apple pie filling, which would have been excellent with different apples (Jonamac doesn't have enough flavor and the texture is mushy). Bottom line: the crust was the best part of my pie.  I had good luck with this recipe. Thanks!

This was a wonderful, easy pie crust recipe!! To switch it up though I used 1 and 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat. I used 3/4 cup margarine since I didn't have shortening, no salt and 1/3 cup cold water. Awesommmmmmme.

Probably didnt need the full amount of water - I read this note after I had mixed it all in (and it seemed too wet).  Added just a bit more flour and it worked, but next time will watch the water amount.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this wonderful pie crust recipe!  Most recipes I find are bland and dry, they crack and are a pain to work with, but not this one!  Very flaky, flavorful and easy to work with! I now have a new found confidence about making pastries!

This recipe seems to be pretty good.  The first attempt was bad, real wet and doughy.  Tossed that and started over.  Still had trouble and had to add a fair amount of flour for rolling purposes.  Finally managed to make the crust and continued the baking of the pie, hoping for a good pie as it was for Christmas.  Wa-la---  the pie came our wonderful and the crust worked out excellent.  Very flaky and held together nicely.  Cut beautiful also.  Was very pround as I am not good at pies.  So I will use this recipe.  Note:  I live in Florida and not sure if the humidity helped in my problem. I used VERY LITTLE water and added VERY SLOWLY.   This recipe will be a keeper and I will need to practice more  :-).

I made this both exactly as written and with the advice to substitute 1/2 of the shortening with 1/2 a cup of butter. It was MUCH better with the butter.  It was cooked in a stone pie plate and it was perfectly cooked in about 40 minutes. Great easy recipe!

Excellent pie crust, it was very flaky and light. I sprinkled apple pie spice into the dough for the apple pie and topped with sprinkles of sugar. It was a hit.....Great job Jean!

I LOVE this recipe. I haven't bought store bought pie crusts since trying this one. Perfect every time. Mixes up perfectly.  Rolls out like a dream.  Really flaky.  No-one leaves even a smidge of crust on their dessert plates.  The only time I had problem was when I used margarine or butter instead of shortening...or when I cheated and tried to roll out the dough after only two hours.  You need to chill this dough for at least the four hours recommended.  I use butter-flavored shortening.

Yes, this recipe takes some patience to get to the end result, but if you follow through, the crust is the flakiest I've ever baked. And(!!!) you can make it with gluten free flour and it is still really good. I suggest you try it (and maybe add some cinnamon or vanilla to the dough for some flavor), make sure you let it sit over night in the fridge for extra flakiness, and take your time when rolling it out. You won't be disappointed.

This is great pie crust. When doing the shortening, I took the tip of another reviewer by putting plastic wrap in the measuring cup and then putting a rubber band around the measuring cup and THEN putting the shortening in it. Works really well!

I personally think that this pie crust needs more water..when i do it with 1/2 cup of water its too dry making it almost imposible to mix, so i add a bit more of water until the consistency is just about right.

This recipe is amazing! I was a bit nervous at first about how much shortening was in it but it turned out really well. I've never had a crust that was so nice and flaky! I used a milk wash to make it look nice and golden, but other than that I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I'm so glad I found this. My old pie crust recipe is officially in the trash!!!

I've used this recipie 4 times in the last 2 months for various events, and each time, I got complimented on the crust. I don't understand how this recipie could get a rating any lower than a 4, because I haven't tasted any pie crust that matches it's texture, flavor, and color. Everyone that I've had try this pie crust has loved it. 
I also love how simple it is! But to make it just a smidge better, I would also recomend that instead of chilling it for 4 hours, use very cold water and chill the bowl in the freezer before combining everything. Then chill the dough for about 20 minutes while the oven is pre-heating. This works if you're in a hurry. Otherwise, chilling for 4 hours works just fine.

As stated before this does become a sticky mess but the end result is the perfect pie crust. I combined all of my ingredients in a stand at about room temperature then put it in the fridge and worked with it chilled.

I used this recipe for my first-ever homemade pie crust on Thanksgiving.  It turned out quite well using equal parts frozen butter & shortening along with very cold ice water.  I blended everything in my food processor & ended up using less water than called for, then refrigerated overnight.  Although the dough looked rather dry, it was very difficult to roll (very sticky) until I took the advice of a previous reviewer & rolled between two sheets of plastic wrap - then it was "easy as pie"!!  I did taste the shortening, so next time I'm using all butter.  The dough was extremely flaky & tender.  It was minimally handled, just like when making biscuits, and that was key!  Thank you for the easy, good recipe.

I love this pie crust recipe. It’s so simple; I won't buy premade crust again.

I always use half butter, half shortening. When I use this recipe for chicken pot pie, I use 1.5 cups all purpose flour and .5 cups wheat flour. The wheat flour gives it a heartier flavor that works really well for Chicken Pot Pie without and just using a half a cup doesn’t mess up the glucose levels, etc.  Very yummy.

This was terrific and so easy! And I found it very easy to work with on a well floured surface. As long as you chill the dough for the time reccomended, it is super easy to roll out and tasted wonderful when done! Rave reviews all around!

To be honest, this was a little hard for me to work with, although to be fair it was a pretty warm day when I made it.  I made the dough and put it in the refrigerator and got back to it after about an hour.  It rolled out pretty nicely, and I normally do not have a problem taking a crust off of my well floured work surface, but this one would not come up in one piece.  I swore this would be the last time I used this recipe  UNTIL.... I ate it!  WOW, this crust was so good I wanted just a bowlful of crust (the pie was good too, but this crust tasted fantastic!) I think next time if I roll out my crust on parchment paper or wax paper or a silpat or something, it might work better for me, I won't give up on it though, it was just too good!

This was awesome. I used Earth Balance shortening (which has a much better flavor than Crisco), and bread flour (which I didn't think would work but it did). I didn't refrigerate the dough at all. We used it to make pot pies (with tops), and they all came out flaky and buttery and wonderful. Ours (with the tops) were cooked at 400º for about 17 minutes. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Made it with a Chicken Pot Pie recipe from this site and it came out excellent.  It's supposed to yield 2 pie crusts but I just made 1 thicker one and it was still quite good and I think went really well with the recipe since it was a little more moist.  I brushed it with egg white - didn't know if that made a difference.  I think I'd rather brush it with egg yolk next time.  Great recipe!  A keeper!

I needed the crust baked before adding the filling, so I baked it with some wax paper topped with some uncooked beans to weight it down. Came out great!

Very, very good. The key really is to keep everything very cold (shortening in the freezer for 30 mins before making it, and ice water), and also, to handle it as little as possible.

Very easy, I just put it in the freezer for 1/2 an hour before rolling out. I also was alomst out of shortening so I just used about 1/3 of a cup of shortening and subbed margarine in for the rest. I used the crust for a chicken pie and it was so good.

My husband wanted an apple pie for his birthday and I was nervous because I'm a cake person. I've made pies a couple of times before and the crusts were not flaky at all. I read a bunch of reviews and ended up using 1/2 butter, chilling everything (forks, bowl, flour etc) and using ice water. It turned out awesome!  I was so proud of my pie! I didn't have 4 hours to chill so I put it in the freezer for 45 min.
11/27/07 I've made this since without chilling anything (still used ice water)and using all shortening and I think it turned out just as good, but easier to work with. This a great recipe.

Once I used Smart Balance shortening instead of the usual shortening, and that is the only time I ever had a problem with the crust not being pliable, rather falling apart, and I couldn't even get the crust to stick together enough to make a nice lattice top for the apple pie. As long as you stick to the original ingredients and don't try using a "healthier" alternative to shortening, you will get a phenomenal crust with this recipe.

Wonderful pie crust! I only use this crust for anything I do. Every year I many the crust and seperate the top and bottom and wrap them in plastic wrap and place them in the freezer for about a week.  I do use butter flavor crisco and it makes a wonderful butter flavor crust for my peach pies.

Thanks so much!

This was my first time ever making a homemade pie.  I was told to buy a crust, but instead decided to look on the website to find a recipe for crust.  This one turned out perfect!  I baked two crusts for strawberry pies at 325 degrees for about a half an hour.  I really just watched them closely until the edges began to brown just slightly.  Excellent recipe:)

this is the BEST!!!  Just made it for the 2nd time and really is so good.  I love the taste of it and it's easy to use.  I had gotten so frustrated on homemade crust, and a few times bought store bought, which I don't really like...gave this one a shot and won't do store ones anymore!

This pie crust was fantastic! Easy to make and tasted delicious! This was the first time I've ever made my own pie crust and didn't roll the crust thin enough - now I know better! Thank you for a terrific recipe that will be used for all of my future pies!

I have tried many pie crusts and THIS ONE is by far the BEST!! I usually don't even eat the crusts on pies because i've never really liked 'em. I have now tossed out any others I have and replaced with this Pie Crust recipe.  Very flakey and tastes great.

I am a beginner baker.  I have tried other recipes for pie crust and they turned out so so.  I decided to just buy pie crust. That is until I found this recipe.  My pie turn out picture perfect, and the crust was easy to roll out.  (I chilled it first) The taste was amazing.  I will look no futher, this recipe is the one I will use from now on.  A+

This recipe is great!  It was my 1st time making pie crust, and it turned out perfect!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, ice water and everything was COLD when I mixed it.  I had no problems and it turned out flaky, golden and yummy!

This was my first attempt at making pie crust.  Where we live you can't buy pie crusts, so Thanksgiving last year called for me to bite the bullet and make one.  Using a butter knife, my hand was killing me by the time I felt that I had the shortening sufficiently "cut in," and so I wasn't thrilled about finishing up the recipe.  I did, though, and it was delicious!  My ex-pat friends were asking me where I found pie crust at the store!  It was beautiful and flaky and oh so tasty.  If I get one of those pastry cutter things, it will end my pie crust buying days when we're back in the States for sure.  But it is a lot of work to make.

IT IS!!! It is so nice to be new at something and come across "the perfect" pie crust recipe. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe with all of us who just want to do things right. Try this with Strawberry Pie II (on this website) and you won't believe the combination. I also use this for pot pies and use half butter and half shorting in that case and they turn out just as yummy.

Easy to make.  Good taste and texture.  Made with butter-flavored Crisco.  (Do not substitute shortening with butter!  I followed another reviewer's advice and did this the first time since that's what I had on hand.  It's not as easy to work, and therefore the crust isn't as fluffy).  Thanks for sharing.

Pie crust has always intimidated me... but I decided to try this one and was very happy with the results.  Despite requiring a bit of planning because of the refrigeration step, this is the best pie crust I have ever had!

I used this crust for Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings which turned out great.  I only used 1/4 cup of the water and the pastry held together very well.  It was very light and melt in your mouth in this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.  I didn't have time to refrigerate and I rolled it out between 2 sheets of saran.

Love it!  So easy to make and delicious in all recipes requiring store bought pie crust!  Used it with pie and quiche!
Thanks!!  I used half the dough without refridgerating it and it turned out fine!  So if you're in a hurry skip the chilling part and use it!  The other half of the dough I chilled and they both turned out the same!

Whew! Pie crust is hard to roll out and put in a pan! (my first time with my own pie crust) But overall, this crust turned out fantastic.  I even made it sort of thick and had to patch holes after I tried to place it in the pan. I did not overwork it at all, which I know will take the flakeyness out of the crust. Also I used butter flavored shortning instead of the regular kind.  I will use this recipe every time I make a pie.

Wow....this is a flaky crust.  Made a lemon meringue pie yesterday morning and today the bottom crust is still really flaky.  I added a pinch more salt and substituted about a quarter stick cold butter in place of some of the shortening.  I think it would have been a little bland otherwise. I also put ice cubes in a 1 cup meausuring cup and filled with water, let sit and took the 1/2 cup water from there (in my experience, crusts tend to be flakier if water and fat are cold).   It was easy to work with, too. I'll keep this one.

This was very easy to prepare.  I did leave my pastry in the fridge overnite thinking it would be easier to roll out but that wasnt the case for me.  Im not the worlds best pastry cook so maybe its just me as I had trouble rolling it out and fitting it into the pie pan, kept breaking apart so after a couple of attempts I got it in there.  I think next time I would only use 2/3 cup of shortening as it was very rich but all in all I would make pie crust again.

This is an excellant recipe....My Mom has been using this same recipe for YEARS and my Dad says there's no crust like it.......ONE DIFFERANCE though...use only 2/3 cup shortening...it will make it a lot lighter....and the secret is to not mess with the dough as much as possible or it will be tough....Great Crust Recipe !!!!!

This is my mother's exact recipe.  It is the only one I will ever use.  For extra flaky crust, use ice cold water and chill dought in the fridge until cold.

Thanks. This was nice. I made sure to use ice cold water to ensure flakiness.

A friend's mother gave me this no fail recipe about 7 years ago.  It's the only pie crust I've used ever since.  It comes out perfect even on the first try.

I think this may be the best pie crust I've ever tasted.
I used it to make a blueberry pie, and it turned out flaky and perfect.  It got a lot of compliments from my family too! :D
I was a bit nervous since I rarely make pies, but I'm glad I used this recipe, 'cause it's really easy.
The only thing I changed was I used margarine instead of shortening, for a more salty taste.
Thanks for posting this great recipe! :)

This was the crust recipe I've been looking for. Perfect for pot pie, and I even changed a coffee cake recipe that my family loves to use this instead- Perfect! It is a little difficult to work with, very sticky, but I rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper. The finished product is well worth the extra effort. It comes out nice and flaky, thanks!

The crust tasted amazing, very flaky and very yummy. My only complaint was that even after refrigerating the dough for 5 hours, it was still very difficult for me to roll out.

I think if you roll it between two sheets of plastic wrap, this problem could be avoided.

But overall, it was easy to make and delicious. I will definitely use this again.

Tasted great.  I did have problems when rolling it out it sticking to the counter. I just rolled it out on waxed paper then pealed the paper off when i put it in the pie pan.

Magnificent!  Makes a generous crust for two pies.  The dough surprised me a little - it looked like pie dough usually does even before I added the water.  I was afraid it would be watery, but it rolled out so nicely.  Thanks!  My pumpkin pies are baking right now, and the crusts look perfect.

I have used this recipe probably 10 times and have just forgotten to rate. I love this easy recipe and when I am looking for a tastier crust I just use butter instead of shortening or half shortening and half butter. I do not recomend letting it sit for 4 hours if you use butter, it is to hard to roll. Overall a good tasting and easy to do crust

It was my first time to make pie crust, and it was so easy! My family loves it! Used it 5 times already to make apple pies.  It has perfect flakiness.  I chilled the shortening and water before using.  Thank you!

This was my first ever pie crust, and it turned out beautifully. Even my in-laws approved! I refrigerated the shortening and water before beginning, and kept the dough as cold as possible until baking.

I've never been very good at making pie crusts, so I switched to store bought some time back.  However, I didn't feel like going to the store, so I tried this recipe.  Boy, am I glad I did!  After making a pumpkin pie with it, my husband complemented the crust!  That's never happened before!  I did cut back a little on the water.  At first, it seemed too sticky, but after it chilled it was great!  No more store bought for me.  I think this one will even give my husband's grandmother, the family's only "successful" pie crust maker, a run for her money!

I had never been successful at making good pie crust, but this recipe turned out GREAT!  I had to add a little bit more flour than the recipe said, and also reduced the water to 1/3 cup as others had suggested.  The crust turned out flaky and delicious.....finally I can make pie crust that turns out right!  I didn't even have to refrigerate it....just put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes and it was EASY to roll....no kidding!

This was my first time ever making my own pie crust and I must say I was very happy with the results and it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. I do not like shortening so I used two sticks of unsalted cold butter cut into cubes instead. I also used my food processor with the dough blade attachment I added the flour and salt and then cut in the cubed cold butter till a crumbled texture formed. Then I added 1 tbls at a time of ice water in total I used 5 tablespoons. I then formed dough into two balls wrapped them in plastic wrap and flattened them slightly and put in the refridge for about 30 minutes. I coated the dough in flour as well as the surface and I rolled out 2 pie crusts. Make sure you have extra flour close by when working with the dough this is what makes it not stick also I rolled dough and flipped it over a few times to coat with more flour. I highly recomend this crust it is very easy to work with. I will never use store bought shells ever again.

Excellent crust! I used it for individual strawberry pies and it was perfect. I used COLD water and chilled the shortening for about 30 minutes. I'll surely be using this recipe again and again.

Thank you for a wonderful pie crust recipe! I have tried other crust recipes in the past with little success, but this was very simple and easy to work with.  My husband said it was just like a chicken pot pie crust(he loves pot pie). It turned out golden brown and flaky with very little effort on my part.  I will use this recipe again and again!

This is simply the best crust I've ever made.  It was easy, flaky, and delicious. I used it to make a chicken pot pie and it was SO easy that my 3 year old helped and it did not become tough.  I will never buy frozen pie crust again.

Let me start by saying I can't stand making pie crust, but we have a ton of apples and I don't like the taste of the store-made  crusts.  I hit up All Recipes to see what I could find and I decided to try this recipe.  This recipe is *so easy* to make and it came out perfectly.  I chilled the dough for only 45 min or so, 10 min in the freezer.  This is my go-to recipe for pie crust from now on!  Thanks!!

I have always had trouble with homemade pie crusts, but have never found a frozen crust that matched the flaky crust of my grandmothers pies.  No matter what I do, its always either too dry or too sticky.  This recipe was easy and a typical shortening-based crust.  Overall, simple to make, but also simple to make wrong.  I used another reviewers suggestion and rolled out the dough between two pieces of saran wrap,  which helped rolling it out even though it was really sticky.  On the second try I found it worked even better by sprinkling the saran wrap with flour on both sides first.  The taste was good and the crust was very flaky.  So even though I still find it a pain, it was everything a flaky crust should be.

I've been using this recipe for over 30 years and have never had a problem - I can't imagine a low rating especially if you didn't even bother to finish and taste it or you didn't follow the instructions.  It has a lot of shortening in it so the refrigeration is important.  If you don't know how to make a pie crust try watching one of the videos on here, it's important to know the tricks such as adding water 1 tablespoon at a time until you hit the right consistency and know what the right consistency is.  This is an excellent almost foolproof recipe for great pie crust.

Absolutely the best pie crust.  I don't make any changes except I roll it and put it in a pie tin before chilling it.  I find cold dough is too hard to work with, and people still rave about the crust regardless.

Very flaky. I thought it was easy to work with, it wasn't 'greasy' at all. My shell shrunk after I baked it, but I think because the crust is so fluffy and flaky, the holes I had pricked with a fork before baking closed back up for the most part.  I have bookmarked this recipe!

Tried to make a pie crust my very first time and it was SOOOO GOOD! 
I was afraid that it wasn't going to turn out "5 stars", but it did. It was flaky, it was crunchy like everyone else said.
I am very pleased with this recipe.

( You don't even need blender)

My son (4) wanted to do a shortening crust, so I pulled this recipe.  I usually do Butter Flaky from this site with great results, and I thought, "Rave reviews? How hard can this be? Why not!" I thought it looked like the gal in the video was having a hard time, and as it turned out, I did too--it tore, I could barely get it to the pie pan, I had to press it into place, the top was a mess.  It tasted okay, but barely held the pie together because it was so crumbly.  Note that most of the rave reviewers subbed BUTTER!!  This is not a keeper.  I'll be looking for a new shortening crust recipe.

This one is amazingly flaky and tender.  What you have to know is that good pastries and pie crusts require some practice and experience, there is no foolproof recipe for a beginner if you don't know what you are looking for texture-wise.  Improper measuring of the flour can ruin any pie crust, as can dousing with the recommended amount of water instead of using a bit at a time until the dough balls together.  Practice, practice!  I found that I needed a touch more flour in my crumb than called for (as I spooned right from the bag) and I eyeballed the water.  I discovered I was a bit low on shortening and subbed fresh salted butter for about a 1/3 of the cup required.  I used seasalt instead of table salt.  This created more than enough dough for me to do a full thick top and bottom crust for my blackberry pie without a drop of seepage.  I did not wait and refrigerate it which made it a bit soft and floppy but the slightly sticky dough seamed perfectly when pinched together which I have never had great luck with before.  It rolled easily into a round without tearing and browned lightly.  The verdict?  The most buttery, flaky crust I have ever tasted.  My husband and kids, who usually do not eat the edge of the crust devoured every bite and my husband raved that it was the best crust he'd ever tasted.  The flavor was right- on, not too salty nor sweet.  I would use this for a savory pie as well.  This one will be my go-to crust from now on!

I made the recipe exactly as listed but doubled it for a Turkey pot pie, it was beyond excellent my husband and kids loved it-they are very picky eaters and my youngest will normally not ever eat the crust of any type of pastry crust. To make it a more savory crust I did add 2 tsp of oregano and 1tsp of garlic powder while blending all the ingredients together. I also used butter flavor Crisco instead of plain and mixed everything together on low speed w/the flat beater wand in my kitchen aid mixer (about 1-2 mins). I did flour my surface when rolling out the dough and it turned out perfect-definitely one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.

have gotten rave reviews everytime I make this crust. sometimes I add a teaspoon of sugar (if a fruit pie)and have added herbs for savory pies. also have done half shortening/half lard for that old fashioned taste (my husband's favorite).

I am using this recipe with a lot of success for my apple pies, for pumpkin pies, even strudels and turn overs...it's fantastic, easy to work with, final product is awesomely flaky. I love simplicity and awesomeness of the final product. Just one important note... the best it's the same day. But because it's so easy to get it ready, it's not a problem to bake a fresh pie the same day you plan to serve it.

I tried to salvage this recipe but even with my efforts it was bland, TOO flaky, and almost impossible to work with. I like my crust to have some bite to it. Some density! I like to taste the crust! It needs butter instead of shortening, and far more water than was called for.

This recipe was amazing, so flaky, yummy and it made enough to have extra dough for turnovers. I only made one small substitution, used butter instead of shortening and ice cold water. don't miss this it's really good...I would also reduce the salt a touch.

I have tried all sorts of crust recipes and this one by far takes the cake.  The dough would roll out but all it did was bust up.  I ended up just pressing it into the bottom of the pan.  I was so disappointed especially after all the rave reviews.  It was for a cherry pie using my dad's first picking of cherries off his cherry tree.  :(  I went ahead and used it because I didn't have time to make another recipe since I had already waited on this one to chill etc and have to work tomorrow.  All I can say is it better taste better than it rolls. :(

I tried this recipe and I have to agree with naples34102, the dough in the original recipe comes out with too much fat in it. So I had to add a substantial amount of flour to make it work, which in turn is a different recipe, so in conclusion - this recipe does not work as stated and as such I have to give it a 1.

I have made this several times. I add tiny cubes of butter at the very end. I've had so many compliments on this crust. People that throw their crust away, eat my crust. They say it's the best crust they've ever had! I must agree, it's fantastic!!! This crust reminds me of what my Mom use to make! Since she passed before I got the recipe, I know she'd love this crust as I do! She'd be very proud of how good this is! Thanks so much.

This is the second time I use this crust, and somehow this time it is much better than the first. :) I must have done something wrong the last time but it was great then too. Pre-baking must have actually made a big difference. I prebaked at 375 for 10 minutes. Anyway I made a pumpkin pie this time, and as amazing as the filling was I can honestly say what took that pie over the top was this crust. It was flaky and delicious and I'll probably use it forever.

Excellent pie crust and I love the idea of refrigerated for overnight.  I've been baking for 35 years and this is the best crust I've made.  Thanks Jean for the great recipe and the directions.

I used COLD butter flavored Crisco and added 1 teaspoon sugar. I only had need for 2 teaspoons of ICE WATER. I'm stressing COLD and ICE because I think it's important to note that working with cold ingredients gives the best results! Also, I only refrigerated the dough for 1 hour and it turned our perfect and delicious!

Really easy pie recipe, I am wheat and dairy free, so I used the same amounts of everything using spelt flour instead of wheat, and about 1/2 and 1/2 coconut oil and butter substitute instead of shortening. It was easy and it turned out wonderfully!  Thank you!

This is a great, simple recipe. It turns out well every time and I bake alot. I've found that it works well for me if I mix in the water using my fingers. Thanks for the recipe!

I almost didn't try this recipe because of the last review written.  I am glad I did.  My pie was a hit and the crust turned out phenomenal.  I strongly suggest you try this recipe and use the plastic wrap as suggested in one of the reviews to role out the crust and transfer to pie dish.  I didn't make any alterations or changes to the recipe; I used the recipe as it is listed in this website.

I have not tried this recipe but it is almost exactly like the one I do use. The big thing I noticed is the shortening. Lard is by far the best and I always substitute some of that for butter, gives a richer flakier crust. Also ice water is important, and use surgical gloves when I handle pastry.

I have used a recipe close to this for years. 2 C flour, 2/3 C shortening. 1/2 or 3/4 tsp. salt and 4 to 6 T. cold water. I cut ingredients for health reasons and this still works well.

I've been using this recipe for years, it has never failed me. I have changed from using regular shortening to butter-flavored, even better.  I've even mixed this up in the food processor and on the counter top with a pastry knife, even more flakey.  I get many requests for this recipe!

My family loves when I use this pie crust recipes. Sometime I have trouble with it forming well and not breaking apart. I believe that is due to the amount of water I add.

I've always had some difficulty when making pie crusts.  The instructions for this one are what helped me turn a corner.  I'd never refrigerated my dough before, and it made it so much easier to work with - making me not overwork the dough, like it says.  My result was a nice, light, perfectly flaky crust.  Thanks for the advice!

I have been using this pie crust for years. You have to be very careful not to add the water too fast or you will get mush. A tablespoon of iced water at a time! I also add a TBS of sugar and refrigerate for 20 min or so prior to rolling. It is a great crust once you know how to work with it.

Almost as good as my Grams.....she made pies every Sunday.  I used only 1/4 cup ice water which helps the dough firm up a bit, didn't bother to refrigerate. Fabulous

SO EASY and worked great. I used this recipe for my first homemade pie ever and it was fantastic! My husband swore I wouldn't be able to make a great crust on my first attempt and he was shocked at how flakey and perfect it turned out!

This crust was perfect for a fresh peach double-crust pie.  It is a slight variation from the Crisco classic crust, but an improvement, in my opinion.  As always use a flour brand with consistent gluten content and add water according to the humidity and flour.  Differences in reviews can be based on measuring flour, gluten, humidiity.

Used margarine and add water a little at a time until dough ball forms. Made simpler with my Cuisinart food processor with the plastic dough blade. Brushed with egg wash for better appearance.

The only thing I did different was use butter flavor shortening (because that's all I had). It turned out perfect. Everyone loved it. Very flaky.

I really liked this recipe.  It is very simple and it did come out very flaky.  I used coconut oil instead of shortening.  It is on the greasy side, so next time I plan to adjust the coconut oil down.  If you use coconut oil, DO NOT refrigerate the dough.  It will get as hard as a rock and will be next to impossible to work.  Just go ahead use it after the ingredients are mixed together.  I think this is a very workable recipe that can very easily be adjusted to meet personal tastes.

Perfect for all sorts of pies. Pie crust is not as easy as it sounds though - if you are a novice then I recommend reading the All Recipes pie crust article. I chill everything beforehand, all the ingredients and the tools (bowl, spoon, blender) and also always use a crust shield or tin foil around the edges while baking the pie.

Easy for a beginner like me!  Just keep things cold.  The salty/savoriness of the crust is great with apple and chocolate chess pies so far!

I just took my Perfect Pumpkin pie out of the oven. I could't wat for it to cool, just to taste the crust because it is the very first pie crust I made. (I usually buy Pillsbury alreadey made crusts.)  I had to rate this with 5 stars, it is wonderful!  I won't be buying expensive crusts anymore when I can make homemade so easily.  Thank you for sharing this!

This was great.  First time I made pastry that turned out well.  My 10 year old now feels she can make pastry.

This is the best pie crust I have ever made. I have used it for dessert pies as well as potpies and it always turns out great!

Great, simple recipe. My first pie crust. So glad I read reviews though: you MUST roll this out between sheets of plastic wrap! It is so sticky, I can't imagine trying it without the plastic wrap. I made it exactly as called for by the recipe, otherwise. Great, flaky traditional crust.

I come from a long line of old fashion cooks and came across your recipe. It is truly the best I have ever tasted and came out like a blue winning ribbon. Thank you so very much for sharing this best of the best pie crust! Over the 5 star in my book.

So delicious! This was the first crust I've made and it was very easy - not at all like I had imagined. My mom kept telling me to "just get the frozen kind - it'll save time." There's no way that I would ever by that now. Thanks!

I was hesitant to try something as ambitious as a pie crust (I love baking but I'm just starting out) but when I came across this recipe it seemed simple enough, and it was. I had a great time making it and the result was wonderful. Thanks for submitting it! I'm sure I'll make use of it many times in the future.

I used butter instead of shortening for this crust, and it worked out beautifully. I did notice, however, that with so much butter, it dripped while cooking. If your crust comes out past the edge of your pan at all, it may drip butter onto your oven, which is a big pain. I recommend lining a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and putting it on a lower rack under your pie to catch the mess.

Regardless, this is a great crust that got rave reviews from everyone I served it to.

Very easy to work with. For Thanksgiving I compared this recipe, Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site and Better Homes and Garden's basic crust. They were all easy to work with but the Basic Flaky Pie crust had a better flavor.

I refrigerated the materials previously, added in water 1 T. at a time and froze it for a couple days before using. It froze very nicely and was very easy to roll out and use.

GREAT pie crust recipe, I recently used it for Thanksgiving apple pie and although the pie recipe was awful, the crust was fabulous! A staple recipe for anyone who's baking a pie.

This was a good crust.  However, after it comes out of the refrigerator you need to knead it a few times in order to roll out a perfect dough.

I love, love, love this recipe.  It makes the lightest flaky crust.  It's the best crust recipe I have ever tried. My husband has always thought store bought crusts were better than homemade.  That is, until I made a pie with this crust.  I had looked for a recipe because I wanted my three year old boy to get the entire experience of making a pie, so that he could say he made the crust too.

Very, very, very good!!

I used this recipe for fruit pies & although I had some trouble with the first rolling, I just put the dough in the freezer for a bit and it helped with the rolling. 
Very flaky & not at all tasting like shortening.

I loved this recipe! I searched forever for a recipe for pie crust I could use to make pot pies. I couldn't believe how perfect this came out! I swapped the shortening for butter since it was all I had and the crust came out flakey and with a buttery crip taste. It was so easy to make and this was probably the easiest dough to roll out I've ever encountered. 5 stars for sure!

This was very good. I used butter instead of shortening. I chilled in the freezer for 20 mins. Dough was a tad sticky, but not bad. The only thing I will do different next time is to add a tbsp or two of sugar for a sweet pie. Will use again, can't wait for the holidays!

This is an easy, good crust. It can be made for sweet pies by adding 2 tbsp sugar to recipe. I made it for both a shepards pie and for an apple pie. Not the best crust I have had but it is the best I have made so far. I will keep this recipe on hand but will also keep looking for the prize-winner! Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. It's simple and I like that it doesn't have vinegar. I've gotten good reviews from everyone I've served it to. I've used it for a pumpkin pie as well as several chicken pot pies (Chicken Pot Pie IX). It's a keeper. I've followed the advice of other reviewers, and I refrigerate everything (bowl included) and make the dough a day in advance.

My old family pie crust recipe is almost exactly the same as this.  It is excellent!
I am definitely going to try the chilling method.  And the plastic wrap method one of the reviewers suggested.

This was the recipe that my Mother taught me, and I have taught my daughter-in-law.  Perfect everytime!  I use Butter-Flavored Crisco rather than plain as it gives a nice flaky crust with a rich taste.

Yum! This pie crust is so flaky and flavorful. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as others suggested. Definitely put everything in the fridge before starting. I still have problems rolling the dough out, but I figure it doesn't matter how "perfect" the pie looks when it tastes so good. Use "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" from this website as a filling and you won't be disappointed.

This is possibly the best crust I have ever had! It comes out so light and flaky it's basically the pie crust equivilant of a cressant, I love it!
 I find that freezing the shorning for at least four hours minimises greasiness and creates a dough much easier to work with. Also, one trick I've found to minimise mess is to pour the flour and salt into a ziplock bag, shake to blend, and mix the shortning in the bag. But even without that the recipe is awesome!

Wonderful, easy to remember and easy to use pie crust recipe!  I was scared away from making pies as I'd been told that crusts are impossible, but this wonderful recipe (with the minor change of using 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter) turned out perfect the first time and has been perfect every time since. Thank you!

This is the only pie recipe I have ever used.  It is not only easy, but it is hard to mess up. I have had this recipe for over 20 years, and no matter what I make, pie, pizza crust or whatever calls for a great crust, I use this recipe. It is the best and easiest pie crust ever.

This was my first time making a made-from-scratch pie, and this was so easy!!!!  I highly recommend using the saran wrap when rolling the crust out.  If I can do this, anyone can!!! I got a lot of compliments on the crust, thanks so much for sharing!!!

i made this crust after being thoroughly disappointed with the crust from the grocery store. i live in switzerland and after having had the ready-made crusts in the US it was not the same taste or consistency i had hoped for. that said this recipe is pretty good. i used half&half-butter and shortening. i think i will try 3/4 butter and 1/4 shortening next time. it just didn't have the buttery flavor i was looking for. i used it for ham and cheese quiche.

This was honestly the best pastry i have ever tasted on a pie. I made it with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie from this site (also delicious!). The crust turned out perfectly golden and perfectly flaky. I used my processor as the shortening was quite hard, and this helped to mix it to the right consistency. This will be a staple in my cooking now, i plan to use it next for a savoury pie. Thanks!

This IS the best ever pie crust!  I used butter flavored shortening.  For the water, I filled the 1/2 cup up, but then only put in a little over 1/3.  I also let it stay in the fridge overnight.  The flavor complimented my apricot pie nicely.  I think mostly due to my inexperience, I had issues keeping it from ripping but it was easy overall. p.s. Don't miss the footnote that says, "If necessary, use a little less water than called for in recipe."

I did make a few modifications, I used half lard and half unsalted butter and just added the smallest amount of salt.  But this recipe came out absolutely perfect!  I'm very impressed.  For my first run at a pie crust, it came out very good.

This is by far the best crust I have made (but granted, I am not that great at it :). I used it for an apple pie using the "Vermont Apple Pie" recipe from this site for the filling, and it was a huge hit. My only change was to use 1-7/8 cup shortening and 1/8 cup butter (that's what I had). Thanks for the recipe, I'll use it over and over again!

Fab!  I used my food processor and the advice of another and put the shortening and food processor bowl in the freezer for a few minutes.  Used ice water too.  The dough seemed sticky, even after 3 hours in the fridge(was convinced I'd goofed).  I used the dough for tarts.  Divided into 12 sections and rolled each out individually, rolled out beautifully, despite my scepticism.  I can't believe that I can make such a beautiful, flaky pastry crust.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will continue to use this from now on :)

Maybe it is the hot humid weather at our home that is making this dough kind of sticky. I rolled the dough between 2 sheets of cling wrap, but transferring it onto the pie dish was still a problem. It fell apart in places, so my pie was 'patchworky'. Taste was good though, so I will try making this again. Thank you for posting.

I used this recipe for the first time when I was living in Japan. My friends, students and fellow teachers just loved it! I substitute in some butter for a portion of the shortening, though, to add some buttery flavor to the crust.

Wow! This is the absolute best crust I have ever made! My husband has never been one to eat the edge of the crust, but when he was done with his slice of pie, he realized that he had eaten all of it! Definitely will be using this recipe again!!

Wow!  Quick, easy, very flaky and tasty - what more would you want in a pie crust?  Just what I was looking for - thanks for sharing!
I wanted to edit my review to add the following:  I used this crust (and it worked great) for apple pies and for chicken pies.  I didn't like it as much when it needed to be prebaked before adding filling (as in cream pies). It was too tough when prebaked. Still a really great pie crust when filled before baking though.

i used this for an apple pie, and i think i probably liked it more than the pie itself. sometimes i bake the crust by itself and then spread some preserves that i heat up on the stove for a sweet little snack.

This is the first pie crust I've made in a long time because I've been dissapointed in the past.  This crust was awesome!!  My whole family thought it was great.  One thing I did differently was that I used butter flavored shortening because I didn't have any regular shortening.  It was really good with a beautiful color, flaky and delicious.  It will now be the crust I use for any pie I make from now on.

Changed the way I feel about making pie crust.  One reviewer suggested rolling it between plastic wrap, which I did, and it made all the difference.  No muss, no fuss!  Nice flaky crust with good flavor.

SO EASY AND SO GOOD!!  I made apple dumplings (Grandma's old fashioned from this site) and used this as the crust.  The best part of the apple dumplings in my opinion. Can't wait to use this for pie.

This was easy and yummy.  i rolled out the dough between wax paper, then draped the dough over the rolling pin to move it to my dish.  This was my first time making crust and it was worth it.

An easy and great recipe.  I doubled this recipe to make "Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings" (recipe is on this site).  Everyone loved them!  The only change that I would recommend is to cut back on the water especially if you've doubled the batch to make two crusts.  Happy Baking!

Excellent pie crust!  Kids kept saying it smells like french fries and for once they actaully ate a pot pie!  I did add a dash of vinegar and kept everything very cold.  Only refridgerated the dough for 1/2 hour.

I used this recipe to make pie crust from scratch for the first time. Was by far the best pie crust we've ever had. Very handy being able to make ahead. I usually have a batch made in the fridge now for everything from pie to quiche. Thanks for sharing.

OMG! The one and only time I have ever made a pie crust was in home economics about 13 years ago. I had never attempted it because, yes, I got a C on my pie crust project back in the day. This is SO EASY and delicious! I paired it up with Chicken Pot Pie III recipe also found on allrecipes.com. I doubled the dough recipe and was enough for 6 individual pies (with tops)  MMMMM! 

p.s. I also used butter flavoured crisco

I've never made a pie crust for fear of it never coming out right...and the convenience of buying one already made of course. I felt bold and tried this recipe. I didn't chill it for 4 hours though, I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes like one reviewer did. I made a sweet potato pie and my crust turned out AWESOME! I can't wait to start making other stuff like Chicken Pot Pie!

Well it worked out alright.  It shrank down the sides of the pie plate when I blind baked it.   I used my food processor to mix the dough and only needed about 1/4 cup of water.  I'm glad I didn't blindly pour in half a cup.  It was still pretty sticky when I pulled it out of the processor, but with a little flour I was able to handle it.  I didn't have time to let it chill for 4 hours, but I did put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes or so.  It cooled it back down again. 
Anyway, not a bad crust!  Thanks!

Some of the best things are so simple! I wish I found this recipe a long time ago, no need to look for another or to adjust in any way. Minimal ingredients, very easy to make and rolls out nicely. Very flaky and tasty! I can't imagine anyone messing up this recipe.

Perfect!  I had never made crust, but always opted for the store bought kind, trying to aviod ruining a pie.  This recipe could not be any easier, or better tasting.  I will never look for a different crust recipe...  (or by a crust) again!

It just got better... I used butter flavor Crisco this time!

This was a very good tasting pie crust and extremely tender.  So tender, in fact, that it all slumped to the bottom of my pie pan after 2 minutes in the oven.  I just used another like pie pan to 'squash' it back into place and baked it sandwiched like this.  Turned out real good (just not so pretty)but next time I won't use nonstick pans for this recipe!!!

This is truly a wonderful pie crust. I've used it to make a homemade chicken pot pie and it is great, even warmed up the next day. I've baked the left over crust with some cinnamon and sugar on it and I couldn't stop eating it. Just wonderful!

This was pretty good except that I chilled it over night since I thought it'd be easier to make the crust the night before to save time and it came out crumbly.  Since this was the first pie crust I've made I didn't know this was because it had dried out (even in the plastic wrap it was stored in).  So if your crust is too crumbly, ignore the note and add a little more water.

My first pie crust!  It was a glowing success, however, made only enough for one crust which worked out fine as I had a frozen pre made one that needed using.  But the quantity might have been user error on my part.  The crust was flaky and flavorful, thanks Jean. I will double when I make again.

This was very flakey & tender. I used only 1/4 cup water, if that. (It was a dry, wintry day, too.) I rolled it out between 2 sheets of plastic. Next time I would use some butter, or maybe butter flavoured shortening, for flavour. I used it for a turkey pot pie. I will make it again, absolutely.

Wow! I never would have thought that the very first pie crust I ever attempted would actually turn out! Used it for both the pumpkin pies (Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie) I made, and they turned out beautifully!

Good taste, great consistancy, and super easy to make! Why would anyone ever buy a premade crust with a recipe like this available?

THANKS!!!

I doubled the recipe and the crusts turned out wonderful. I was a little concerned at first because they were so sticky when I wrapped them to chill them(overnight) the next morning when I rolled them out they were perfect.Thanks for such an easy recipe.

I used this for 2 recipes, I doubled this recipe and made Chicken Pot Pie with 2 crusts and used one for Apple Crisp and they both came out phenomenally. I will use no other recipe and I plan on using it again tomorrow for Beef Pot Pie...... My husband asked if the pot pie came from a restaurant!!

Fantastic pastry. I used 1/2 cup of low-fat butter for extra richness. Also, I added the water a little at a time, and didn't need the whole 1/2 cup. Like other reviewers, I wrapped the dough in seran, and popped it in the freezer for 20 mins. Perfect! Thanks, Jean!

I am a first time crust maker and this was very easy to make and work with. Turned out great (flaky and tasty) for apple pie. I did use less water as suggested by others who left reviews. I also rolled out on wax paper which makes it very easy to transfer to the pie plate. Thanks so much!!

I've made many pie crusts with this recipe, and they have turned out perfect each time!! I don't even bother chilling the dough, I just dust it well with flour while I'm rolling it out to prevent it from sticking.

I really had my doubts while making this pie crust, but to my surprise it turned out wonderful!Lots of flavor and very flakey. My Son who doesn't like the crust usually told me it was the best he ever had! Thanks for sharing this yummy and simple recipe!!!
I continue to make this simple and easy pie crust! Everyone raves about it and i'm continually asked for the recipe! Thanks so much for a perfect pastry dough ... never again will i buy frozen. Lee :)

This is so easy, and has become the staple for every recipe requiring a pie crust.  I highly recommend it.  There are dangers, though, in adding too little or too much shortening.  I have accidentally done both, producing a crust too dry or too oily to cook respectively.  Just avoid this mistake, and the crust is heaven!

yummy crust, very easy and simple that u can beat it with a spoon no need for a bread maker. I have done it twice already once doubled and once added some vinegar it was just great. When adding water make sure its cold. If u refregirate the dough the better it gets!

This was the first time that I have made an apple pie (which is what I used it for) so I really don't have much to compare it too.  For me, the crust was sooo simple to make, but a little hard to work with.  I had to use butter flavored shortening, because that is all that I had on hand.  To me, I think it could have used a little more salt (I may have not added the whole amount = my fault) but I brought it over to my Mom's house and it was devoured, in fact I didn't get to try it with the filling.  Very flaky.  I will use this again.  Thanks Jean!

This pie crust was good and easy, although I've made better (basic pie crust on this site).  I used this to make quiche and it turned out pretty well.

I'm no pastry chef and hate making pie crust, I usually buy it, but this was flaky, easy, and really, better then store bought! I froze the leftovers and my husband made a great cobbler from it

This is a lovely, flaky crust.  It still fell apart when I folded it up to put it in the pie pan, but that seems to happen to me no matter what pie crust recipe I try...I think I'm jinxed.

My normally oblivious husband actually said wow this crust is great. I did not refrigerate in between and I used no where near as much water as it called for, but it was still nice and flaky! Thanks!

It was all I could do not to eat the whole crust off the top of the pie! I didn't have time to let it chill for four hours so I put the ball of dough in the freezer for one hour and it still turned out great! My children and my hubby loved it also. Thanks!

I have always been complemented on my pie crusts but find myself relearning everything now that I've moved to 5000 feet above sea level.  This recipe was great!  I used chilled shortening and only chilled the dough for 1/2 hour but it turned out flaky and delicious.

I love this recipe! It was so easy and so flaky and tasty. My kids which have been known to be picky and leave the crust on the plate after eating pie, ate this one up like nothing and wanted more! Just use common sense when making this recipe. If it's too sticky, add more flour. I agree that the amount of water called for is a bit much, but overall it turns out to be absolutely fabulous when you use the tips on the site!

This is the same pie crust my grandmother and my mother use.  I've tried many others, and this is simply the easiest and the best.  With this crust recipe the old adage, "easy as pie" really does fit!

This was the first time I ever made a homemade crust, and everyone raved! It was delicious, flaky and withstood handling.  I didn't need all of the water, so I only used 1/4 cup.  What a great recipe!

Best pie crust I have ever made. The only change, and it's because I like the buttery flavor, was to use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Followed recipe besides that. 
The crust was so flakey.  My daughter said it with the residue of my pecan pie tasted like baklava.
Def have this one saved for future use!

I used old fashioned lard and it really came out just like what your grandmother used to make. The key to the recipe is to make sure your lard/shortening/butter is hard (not too hard) so that it can be broken into the pieces described. Follow the measurements as they are spot on and you will have the best crust at your next gathering.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  The dough was easy to work with when I took it out of the refrigerator.  Made a wonderful tasting and flaky crust.  I do use Crisco butter flavored shortening, which makes it taste more buttery.

I didnt realize I needed to chill the recipe for 4 hours so I stuck it in the freezer for about 15-20 mins and it was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and had no issues. The dough rolled perfectly and did not crack or fall apart.

This is the exact recipe my Mom used many years ago.
She wou;d make several at a time and freeze them, wrap them well in plastic wrap before a holiday or busy time. When she wanted some  she would let them defrost on the counter and as soon as they were ready, finish the pie and bake them.  Every woman who tasted her pies asked for the dough recipe.( She never left them too long in the freezer. ) 
We loved her pies !!

Awesome recipe!!

Loved it the first time 4 years ago.  After that, tried to change the fats and see what would happen....1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter seems to me the best for our tastes.  Otherwise, everything is spot on - keep making it over and over.  A pie crust should be loaded with fat, that's what gives you the buttery lovely flaky quality.  Another key - don't over mix or over process!  Just to incorporate.  The heat from your the friction of hands/rollers as you work to roll out your crust will keep mixing - it should be a 'shaggy dough' or a rough dough having incorporated at least 3/4 of the flour, that you turn out onto a surface to work with.  The additional flour will work in as you gently work roll/ shape the crust.  Don't overwork your dough/crust!  Just work until you can shape it, roll it and move on with the glorious pie making of all types!

I don’t have much experience making pie crust. When I have made it in the past, it wasn’t great. This recipe was easy to follow and the crust was excellent. I made a lemon meringue pie, and everyone loved it. I’ll definitely use it again.

Best, flaky crust I’ve ever had, Nd my husband loved and complimented it. Wow! However!!! It was hard to work with. Kept falling apart. Seemed like it was going to be a tough crust. I was unhappy when I put it in the oven. Threw out the recipe. When we tasted it, boy were we surprised. Had to go search for the recipe. It’s a keeper, even if it gives me trouble!!

Foolproof!  I am not a good baker, but this pie crust makes it seem as if I am.  The sis the flakiest crust and does not crack at all.  It works so well, that you won't risk overworking it cause it rolls out like dream.  Definitely chill the shortening, it really adds to the flakiness.   I use it for pies, and for chicken pot pie and steak pie as well.

wow the best recipe ever for pie crust, quick, easy and delicious.    I have been making pies since I was in High school.    Always hated making crust, still do.     Tried this one today with a chicken pot pie, even the bottom crust was perfect without pre baking THANK YOU.
First recipe from here that I can use without changes

This recipe is the best! I had not attempted a from scratch pie crust in many years, and was nerv ous that I wouldn't be able to make a good crust. My mother was a great pie baker and a tough act to follow.  But by following this recipe (including the "chill time" for the shortening and dough), I was able to produce a crust every bit as good as Mom's (don't tell her). This will be my go to recipe going forward.

I made the recipe as written chilling the shortening and water as shown in the video.  Used a pastry cutter and didn't overwork it.  It worked very well and was flaky.  I will use this simple quick recipe again for fruit pies.  I used it for a meat pie this time but think that it will suit a sweet pie better.

I made as directed, using my food processor instead of a pastry blender. I needed less water than called for, only used about 6 tablespoons.
This came together really well!

Made this pie crust for the first time. Followed the instructions exactly and made a Rustic Peach Pie. The pie filling was great, but the crust wasn’t. I used grated frozen butter, added it to the flour and salt, then mixed it with enough ice water to make a ball, flattened it and then wrapped in plastic and put back into the fridge. We had to cut the crust with a knife to eat it. It was very chewy. When I took the pie out of the oven, it looked as if it was sitting in a pool of grease! Probably too much butter in the crust. Won’t try this recipe again. Maybe I should go back to the Crisco pie crust recipe that’s on the box, but I’ve read some interesting things about Crisco and maybe I won’t go back to it. I’ve never tried Tenderflake though! ????

Please read all the reviews before trying this recipe. I read them all and still tried it. I will NEVER use it again.  All the negative reviews I read were correct regarding (greasy texture, difficult to work with, too sticky, doesn't roll out).  I chilled it, that didn't help, I put it between plastic wrap while rolling and then didn't help.  I even pieced some of it together and baked it to see how it would taste.  I'll have to admit after all this, it tasted flaky but it was impossible to work and roll so it looked decent.  Trust me--get another recipe and save yourself some frustration.  I will not use it again or recommend it. I used the ingredients as listed.

This dough was just too wet. It falls apart and sticks to the rolling pin while rolling and shrinks a lot once it's baked. It's also not very pretty and just looks greasy. It's edible, but that's about it.

This crust was very good! I followed the recipe exactly as directed, but I chilled the water and shortening for about an hour before I made my dough. I doubled the recipe, and it made about 1.5 times what I needed. I rolled my crust out a bit too thick at about 1/8" (I made a cherry pie), so next time I think a much thinner crust would be much tastier for a fruit pie. My crust turned out flaky, just the right amount of moist, and was quite simple to make. I also followed the tip of another reviewer and rolled my dough out between two pieces of plastic wrap, which worked wonderfully.

Totally agree with the other negative reviews. Way too much shortening to flour ratio. Without even adding any water it resembled a soft cookie dough. Ended up adding close to an additional 3/4 cup of flour to even make it resemble a pie dough. Won't be making it again.

4 stars only because  if you are new to pie crust making you must read the reviews for the tips that make this pie crust  successful.  You MUST refrigerate or freeze the shortening, the pastry cutter, and add ice cubes to the water and strain to the correct amount.  If you do those things this is a 5 star recipe.  I wanted a bit of a buttery flavor so I substituted 1/2 C cold butter for 1/2 the shortening. I am a baker but I specialize in cakes. This was my first attempt at pie crust and it came out great.  I used it for apple dumplings.  It was easy to work with, held together beautifully was tender and flaky.  Follow the the tips and you too will be a pie or dumpling maker..thanks for the recipe and thank you to all reviewers who covered the tips..Will be using again!!

Make sure to pop it in the fridge while you make the filling to keep the fats cold. If you leave it on the counter it will become greasy (obviously). I rolled it onto a floured surface and it was great. Beware that this makes enough for a crust and top. Or one really thick crust. Will make again.

Half fat to flour is the perfect ratio that I have been using for over 50 years.  My only difference is I use lard not shortening because I prefer the taste in the pastry.

Made recipe as written.  Came out too crisco-e.  Added 1/2 cup more of flour and omitted water.   Great basic pie crust recipe.  5 stars when you add 1/2 cup flour/Zero water :)

This was the first pie crust I have ever attempted. I chose it for its ease and was greatly impressed with the results. I followed the other reviews that said use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup shortening. Super flaky and buttery crust. It was absolutely wonderful. If you are a beginner I would highly suggest chilling it as suggested as it made the dough super easy work. For anyone who is wondering, this recipe will make enough dough. For a top and bottom crust. I was curious about that as no one else had said it yet. I will definitely be using this as make pie crust on all my pies in the future. Cheers!

Instead of using all shortening, I used 1/2 shortening and the other 1/2 butter.  Worked really well.

Very good pie crust and super easy. Very flakey! I didn't refrigerate it for the full 4 hours, only about an hour in the fridge, and it still rolled out good and tasted great. I used this crust on my Turkey Pot Pie, and was a perfect size for a double crust recipe. Still had a little left over. :)

Turns out perfect every time , very simple recipe  to follow , I find it easiest to just make the crust a batch at a time then I don't need to split it when I roll it out , very flakey , everyone ask for the recipe , I bake pies for the vets home in Minneapolis and every one is asking for the crust recipe !

This has become the only pie crust I use. It's flaky and everyone who eats it tells me it's the best they've ever tasted. Keep everything cold, that's the key.  And, pay attention to the water amount. I find I use less than called for usually. I've sped up the process by putting the dough in the freezer when I've been pressed for time. I don't understand the negative reviews as this recipe has not failed me and I've made over 30 pies with it.

This is my go to pie crust recipe. You have to follow the directions precisely, and it creates a sturdy flaky crust that does not get soggy in the middle like some of the other recipes I've tried before. This pie crust stands up to almost any thing I put in it from Apple pie to chicken pot pie. I don't change anything, just follow as directed!

This crust was very hard to work with. I ended up rolling it on cling wrap to get it to transfer to my pie pan. It was tasteless and extremely crumbly, although visually very flaky.

I cut this in half for 1 pie. The less you mix it, the flakier the crust. Mix it with a fork just until it's all moist.

I've tried many pie crust recipes, and this is the one I will use over any others.  It's very simple and easily modified while remaining deliciously flaky.  Depending on the pie I'm making, I'll add garlic powder or grated orange peel or vanilla extract in with the water.  It's wonderful, and I'm extremely loyal to this recipe.  The only constant substitution I make is that I always use unsalted butter instead of shortening.

A pastry cutter for pie crust really makes all the difference.  A mixer doesn't get the job done correctly.  You also have to make sure that you don't go too crazy with blending pie crust, and allow time in the fridge for the flour to settle down.

I have also made this crust and left it in the fridge for several days before using it - it was still great to use.

I read, as I always do a lot of the reviews, good and bad. Decided that the good won out and tried this recipe. I did double the recipe as I was making a double pie crust pie. I made it in a food processor, and did 50/50 shortening and butter. I literally had to pick the butter out, way too much fat, kept rereading the recipe to see if I had read the ingredient list wrong. After removing the butter I did actually complete the pastry and it came out ok. But have no idea how to recreate.

After listening to the pros and cons of this recipe I followed it exactly. No cold water or chilling utensils or shortening. It came out perfect. The only problem I have is that I like to do lattice top and this was not stiff enough to cut the strips for lattice.

I use this crust ALL the time and I am always complimented on it. My friends and family know me as the resident pie-maker. 

I follow the recipe exactly, except recently I tried substituting half the shortening for butter with good results. 

I make sure to use cold water and "play" with the dough as little as possible. 

Sometimes I will add a dash of nutmeg or allspice when I add the flour to the bowl. 

As for rolling out, I am very generous flouring my surface, and flour the dough every time I flip it over between rolling.

A great crust.  Be sure to chill the shortening and water in advance and roll the dough out between wax paper or plastic wrap.  Increase the recipe by 25% to get two full crusts.

Wow! It had been a while since I made a crust and my husband said tonight that it was almost better than the peach filling, :-) I haven't read all the reviews, but if there is any there that are not raving about this, they did something wrong. Beautifully golden and the bottom crust was as crispy as the top. Awesome flaky texture!

Made the recommended changes to half butter half shortening, reduced salt slightly, added much less water due to high humidity. Remember to keep chill, and if during the process things get soggy, chuck it back into the fridge for a while. 
I think I've found the crust recipe I'm looking for!

I'm eating blueberry turnovers I made from using this recipe as the crust.  I rolled it out thin and it started to break apart (the cause was not enough flour on the table and top of the dough).

Since I'm not a professional pie baker, I don't know how to handle soft doughs so I used a wide pancake flipper to shove extra flour under the dough and move the finished products to the sheet pans.  The turnovers are GREAT and have a slight cinnamon taste every few bites and reminds me of my aunt's pie crusts.  Maybe next time I may add cinnamon and sugar to the mix to get a slightly better tasting dough for the application.

This recipe gets five stars from me.

Very good crust for a shortening based crust. Not sure how it could go so wrong for other people who have tried it. I had to add a tad more water for it to come together. My pie recipe called for 10 minutes at 425 and 40-50 minutes at 375. Was very flaky and deeee-llish!

So, this was my first time baking, almost ever. (I made some cookies a few days ago, and that's it, in my entire life, aside from home ec class). But since I had the time, ingredients, and cooking space (as well as a couple cans of pie filling just laying around), I decided to give this recipe a try. I followed the directions exactly as the recipe calls for and the crust came out perfect! Flaky, golden, and delicious! Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious, flaky crust! Just keep in mind you may not need to use all the water, you just need enough that the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl when you're mixing. I used the whole amount the first time, and it was impossible to work with. Second time I added the water slowly and it was perfect!

I guess the negative reviews are by people who didn't follow directions. I followed these directions, except I didn't chill my dough as long. I only chilled for 30 mins. I'm lazy. Also, I didn't use a fancy pastry cutter (I used a fork), and I didn't chill my utensils, bowls, crisco, or anything else. For those who feel like the dough was too wet...notice the recipe says to use less water if you need to! I added a little water at a time until I had the right consistency. Guess what? The crust came out PERFECTLY! It made a beautiful, flaky, golden crust for my buttermilk pie.  Idk how the other people screwed it up.

Great recipe, the measurements worked almost perfect for me, I just used a bit less water. This was the first home-made crust I had ever made, I didn't expect it to turn out well after hearing so about so many bad experiences that my family and friends have had with making crust from scratch, but I found this very simple and tasty! And I took others' suggestion to chill everything before using.

After a careful reading of the reviews, I decided to give this recipe a try. I ended up using about 2/3 of the egg/liquid mixture (hence 4 stars) and put it in my freezer for an hour rather than the overnight chilling. 
I always roll out my crusts between to layers of plastic wrap - in this case it appears to have been more necessary than others.
The result was a beautiful crust, tender and flaky, though I expect I'll not use this recipe as often as others as I'm concerned about the amount of fat in the recipe.

I used this recipe to make pie crust cookies and they are delicious. I just substituted half butter and half crisco for a better buttery flavor. Roll out, spread with butter, sprinkle lots of sugar, sprinkle some cinnamon, cut into squares and bake. Yum!!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and the crust came out beautifully.  It is a bit sticky when it comes out of the fridge, just flour your surface liberally.  Very flaky and delicious.

Good base recipe - I use it for my meal pies (meat, chicken, pork...) with a few alterations.  I added equal amounts sugar to salt - I also multiply by 50% for a top bottom crust - for a bottom only i just leave alone - also use 50/50 on the shortening to unsalted butter.  You need to let sit in fridge - makes it a lot easier to work with.

My hubby loves my pie crust even better then the high end bakery. This crust is always flakey and never fails. I make this resipyjust how it is wrote no changing it. Sometimes I think of adding a little sugar but never have. Why change something when it isi perfect as it it. :)

I've been using this recipe for a few years now, and I love it!  I tried other pie crusts before this, and found out that pie crust is not easy to make--AT ALL!  Until this one.  It's easy and works for anything, from desserts to savory dishes.  I use it most often on pot pies.  Thanks you for the recipe.

This is the recipe used by my mother and grandmother before her.  I have been baking pies for 40 years and have never used anything but this wonderful recipe.  Use no other shortening other than Crisco.  It is always flaky and very easy to handle.  I get nothing but compliments on the pastry whenever I serve pies.  Also, Fresh Lobster, one cup of shortening IS the proper ratio for two cups of flour in this particular recipe.  This is what gives the result of a very flaky pastry.  The only thing I would stress is to chill your bowl, pastry cutter, rolling pin, etc. in the freezer before using and store your Crisco in the fridge to keep it ready to use.  Excellent recipe!!

A very good recipe for crust but if you don't have the time, just pick one up at the store.   This recipe isn't much different in taste than the store bought.

I have NO IDEA what people are talking about when they said this dough was sticky. When refrigerated for two hours and when you use flour on your work surface and flour the rolling pin, there is no need for wax paper, plastic wrap, etc. Its just fine! Only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening. This recipe was great when it was being baked with the pie filling (ie apple pie), however when it was baked on its own to serve as a crust for my chocolate creme pie, it was difficult to bake properly.

Exceptional! This is the first pastry I have been able to make and have it turn out well. For a sweet pie, I add 1 tsp of sugar, for a savoury pie I just leave it as it is. I have also made this recipe and used the pastry immediately without refrigerating and it still turned out well. Thank you!

I made this crust with the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe.  So good!  I made it with (all organic ingredients) half white flour and half wheat flour, and all unsalted organic butter. I did add a little sea salt to the mixture. I cooled everything before I mixed the ingredient together (this is important).  I then only cooled the mixture for about 1 hour before I spread it out. this was definitely enough time. I brushed the inside and outside lightly with egg whites.. I then started the pre-heat of the oven and put the pie crust in until the temp reached about 300 degrees. I think this make the crust too tough and will not cook it before I pour the pot pie mixture in the shell next time I make it.

I use 1cup of butter flavor shortening, it really gives the crust a nice buttery, crisp taste. Thanks so much for the recipe I get great reviews and the pies I make!!

This recipe was the perfect complement to the pies I baked this Thanksgiving.  I needed very little water in the recipe, but I also used expeller pressed palm oil in lieu of traditional shortening.  I tried half butter/ half shortening as well and it turned out equally tasty.  I would recommend either one.

First time making a crust from scratch and it came out great.  I put my dough in the freezer and it rolled out fine.  Did not use all of the water - as suggested.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

This is undoubtedly the best and easiest pie crust recipe ever!  All the others I have tried seemed to require much more flour.  I was afraid that this recipe would turn out to be "greasy" tasting, but it is light, flaky and tender.  A winner!

I haven't been able to make a decent pie crust in my life...that is until now!!! I thought for sure that this would be another failing pie crust recipe, but it turned out so beautiful and was flavorful and flaky. Used recipe just as stated and followed others suggestions of rolling out on plastic and parchment. Now if I could just figure out how to get the edges pretty...

I used half margarine, and half shortening, and it was wonderful. The only margarine I had was frozen, so I just cut it up into tablespoon sized chunks and threw it in the food processor. Worked like a charm, and made it even flakier. I also put in a tsp. of sugar. Awesome recipe.

Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. Very easy. I make a lot of crust and thought to try something new...it wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome either. Maybe next time I will try it with all shortening.

Wow, this pie crust is AMAZING! People began just picking at the crust of my chicken pot pie last night! I chilled everything, mixing bowls, knives, forks, everything! I also used half butter and half shortening, but I still used the 1 teaspoon of salt. YUM!

Super easy recipe, basic no frills just what I like.  Also I did not have too much of a shortening flavor like several other posters mentioned.  I did have a little trouble with rolling it out. Unfortunately I did not have any wax paper to aid in that but overall will definetly use again.

This was my best looking crust ever!  My pie was beautiful!  Did exactly as written although it did end up being to wet so I added a few tablespoons of flour to compensate.  The reason I gave it four stars was it didn't seem quite sweet enough for my taste.  Will probably add a tablespoon of sugar to the flour next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent base recipe.  I made my first peach pie the other day and it was so good I am making another today.  I used 3/4 cup butter flavored shortening 1/4 cup lard.  Yes I said lard.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar.  Nice recipe

I made four crusts with this - two for a lattice crust peach pie, one for a chocolate pie and one for a sweet potatoe curry pie - and they were perfect.  As another reviewer stated, chill everything before starting.  Let ice melt into the water and put the shortening in the freezer for about half an hour before starting.  Very easy and works for desserts and savory dishes equally well!

This pie crust was very good.  My husband, who normally does not eat pie crust, said it tasted great.  It was very easy to make, and it made enough for two pies.  Overall, this was a great recipe!

On the first try the crust started to fall appart in the oven, but I got it right the second time around.  Will definately use again.

Perfect pie crust. Easy to make, just the consistency I like. I don't think I'll ever use another recipe again. Thanks.

Love this crust and really have used it exclusively lately but I change 2 things:  1) I use half butter half shortening and 2) I do add a little sugar, several TBSPs but that's just personal preference

Chilled shortening and water before beginning. Found that I needed more like 7-8 tbsp. of cold water. Came out flaky - used with Apple Pie recipe.

Thanks for the recipe. I needed a quick pie crust to make for my pumpkin pies and this was great. Liked that it didn't need to be in the fridge for any amount of time. Pies tasted great.

First time: The crust browned nicely and was flakey just the way I wanted it for a quiche.

Second time: For a pie, I did 1/2 Crisco, 1/2 butter.  Perhaps my Crisco was old, but I didn't appreciate its taste.

Third time: For a pie, I did 100% butter, added some salt. I also did 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 unbleached all purpose because I had it around.  Next time I will add some sugar and cinnamon to the crust for pies and use 1/4 whole wheat and 3/4 UAP flour.

Excellent!  I only had 15 minutes to chill the dough, and it still turned out wonderfully flakey.  I used ice water.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've tried several recipes to try and duplicate the prized pie crust my mother always made and this one is a keeper. I added a half teaspoon of sugar and used lard rather than shortening simply because it's 'old school'...the reviews were rave from both friends and family!

Growing up I always hated pie crusts.  I used to just eat the filling and leave the crust.  Yesterday I made an apple pie with this crust.  The filling was okay, but for the first time ever, I downed the crust and wanted another piece of pie, just so I could have more crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh and just so everyone knows, I made this recipe and BARELY had enough for three pies, thinking the whole time I was only making two, so if you use dough sparingly, then a double recipe can easily make three pies!

This turned out better than I expected but I forgot to reduce a bit of the water so I ended up having to add some more flour. This recipe was fast and easy and I most definitely will use this recipe again.

I used this crust for a cherry pie. I had some trouble with it being too sticky (even with less water), but rolling between wax paper helped a little. I brushed it with a beaten egg and it was beautiful. I will definitely make again.

This was the first successful pie crust I've ever made!  I received so many compliments...no one knew it was my first time!  I only made one adjustment, I added a few tablespoons of ice cold water after cutting in the shortening.  I kept the dough balls in the fridge overnight and rolled it out the next day.  Perfect!

This is very easy to make. It's my first time baking (any dessert) and I used this pie crust recipe for the Perfect Pumpkin Pie recipe, also on this site. It turned out great. Thanks.

I used chilled butter flavor Crisco and I used a little less icy water than what was called for and it was very, very soft to roll out.  Almost couldn't pick it up off rolling it.  Was very flaky, but a little too greasy.  Next time I will use 3/4 cup chilled real butter instead and use water one tablespoon at a time.

First time ever making pie crust and it turned out PERFECT!!  I used half butter, half Crisco since I ran out of Crisco, but it still turned out great!!  I will definitely be using this from now on instead of buying the frozen kind!!  Thanks so much!!

I love this pie crust recipe,because it is easy to make and comes out with shinning stars.I put the divided doughs in the freezer for 20 minutes instead of the overnight or 4 hours,as directed.It was very easy to roll out,at the sametime it was a dream to work with.

I think this is the first homemade pie crust I have ever made; they have always intimidated me!  But this one is so easy and so delicious, that this is the only pie crust recipe I will ever need.  Perfect and flaky!  Also, I didn't get around to making the pie right away and the dough sat in the fridge for a few days, but the crust still came out fine.

This is so easy and so good. I had never made pie crust before and it turned out perfect. Used it to make the applesauce custard pie from this site and added a tiny bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the crust for a bit of zing to it and it turned out incredibly great. Will definately be using this in the future to make pies with. Thanks for sharing this simple but great recipe.

This truly is the best pie crust I've tasted. On my first try it turned out delicious and flaky. The recipe was right on with the measurements and very easy to follow. I'll be keeping this recipe for future pies! :)

This crust was amazing!  I've never made pie crust before, and this turned out wonderfully.  I used it for both sweet (blueberry) and savory (chicken pot pie) dishes.  The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter.

I used this recipe to make two small (8") apple pies.  I had enough dough for the top and bottom of both.  The crust came out perfect! Everyone was asking for the recipe.  This is my favorite type of recipe: fast, easy and delicious.

This crust came out really well!  Very flaky and it holds together really well.  Mak sure to cover the edges with foil near the end of baking.  And chill well before rolling it out and use a generous amount of flour to prevent tears.

Perfect! I made it with butter-flavored shortening, which really made the rich taste stand out. I also like the fact that this makes a little bit more than a pie tin needs, so you can press it thick to get a nice thick crust.

Definitely the best I've ever made.  I usually buy pastry since I do such a poor job when making from scratch but this turned out beautifully.

This is the first pie crust recipe I've tried that I like!  I've made it three times, and it's been great every time.  I did use half butter half shortening, and it's still pretty flaky.

Since my last pie was a disaster, I was afraid of making pie dough. However, this recipe changed the way I think about pie crust! It is so easy, flaky and delicious!

my husband is the biggest critic there is, he can cook better than me, but i do the baking and he's not a fan of pies. but he is in love with this crust. the only things i changed was that i didn't put it in the frig and i used wheat flour instead of white. turned out great. thank you... jody in queen creek az.

Great recipe! I used the full 1/2 cup water and it wasn't too much. It does harden after refrigerating. I used this crust with 2 recipes from this site - harvest pumpkin tarts and crispy rhubarb pie. It was fantastic with both.

Great crust, rolls neatly. I have found after wrapping it in clear wrap you can freeze it for 20 min and then use it immediately. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great pie crust and I did have to add a little more flour because of how much water it called for...so next time I will just add less water, but it was soooo easy and good!

This crust was pretty good. I usually don't like crust and I ate it all up. The dough was kind of weird though when I went to put it in the pie crust. I think it needs just a little less water than what I used. It tasted good though.

This is the best pie crust I've ever tasted. The title doesn't lie. It is so flaky and so easy to roll out. Thanks!

Nice tasting crust.  Unfortunately I don't have much experience making pies, so I think that's why mine turned out so crumbly.  I'll try again, though!

This is a good solid pastry that is flaky but doesn't crumble when you cut it.  I was very happy with it...thankyou Jean.

This recipe was great.  I was looking for an easy, tasty pie crust for my banana cream pie, and this one worked out well.  I am an amateur baker, and this was not a problem for me.  It was great!

This is the most fabulous piecrust recipe I have ever made.  I made it for a very good friend of mine for Thanksgiving Day dinner. She told me that this was better then her very dear friend's piecrust.  This is really a compliment because this lady bakes all the time and she is a wonderful cook.  Anyone can make this piecrust and not fail.  It is so flaky you just will not believe that you actually made it yourself.  I couldn't believe I had made it.  I just cannot say enough about it.  Try it, you will like it.
