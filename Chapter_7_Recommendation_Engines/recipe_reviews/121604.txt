Very good.  I added taco seasoning because I found the bean mixture a little bland.  Or maybe the salsa I used was just bland.  Or maybe I'm just bland. Who knows.

Nice and easy! I've been making quesadillas for years and it never occurred to me to bake them (slow learner!). I threw the beans and salsa in the food processor and added some seasoning to them. I found that baking the quesadillas at 400 for 15 minutes gave them the crispiness I was looking for. Thanks!

These were great! I halved the recipe (which I shouldn't have). If you warm the beans a bit, they are very easy to mash. I added the salsa to taste, plus added chili powder. To make these crispier, bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. They were a hit with everyone in the family.

Very good and EXTREMELY easy and FAST to put together! I didn't mash the beans (prefer them whole), added the salsa (medium-hot) to them and also added half a packet of Sazon Goya for a hit of flavour. Followed other's advise about baking at 400F to crisp them up. Fabulous! Thanks for the recipe!

added cumin and chili powder to the beans, used a frozen onion/bell pepper blend, finished it off with lime juice, and popped it in the toaster oven for 10 minutes at 350. serve with salsa.  the filling makes great leftovers for a quick and easy meal throughout the week.  great vegetarian alternative.

These were pretty good.  I used refried black beans instead of mashing up canned ones and eye-balled everything instead of measuring.  I also added chopped tomato and sprinkled on a few broken up tortilla chips.  My only complaint is that the tortillas stayed rather soft. Good snack/appetizer.

Easy, cheap, and fast!  I used spinach & roasted garlic tortillas, and added taco seasoning to the black beans and salsa, as another reviewer suggested.  I also used low-fat sour cream and cheese.  Very satisfying!  Thanks for the recipe!  This is definitely a keeper.

I added corn and olives to my black bean mixture, it was simple and delicious! I made a bunch for a little get together we were having, served it with guac and sour cream- and they were the first thing gone!

This is a good, easy recipe. We all enjoyed it- used sour cream as a dip and pineapple salsa.  Very kid-friendly as well as adult friendly. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This recipe is great. I sometimes use 1 can black beans and 1 can spicy refried beans or whatever refried beans I have, also makes a great topping for a layered nachos

This simple and easy meal really works for us. My husband likes just the plain bean and cheese - while I adore to pile spinach leaves and salsa and sour cream on mine (and eat less carbs than him! :). I only had a bag of Italian four cheese and some sharp cheddar, but it worked fine. Onions and garlic really do add depth to the wonderful black bean flavor. Yum! Thank you for sharing.

Great quick lunch or dinner - I used cheddar because I had some to use up anyway, and used multi-grain tortillas.

Very delicious.  I left some of the black beans whole to vary the texture.  To "glue" the quesadillas together, I put some cheese on the bottom tortilla, then the bean mixture, and then some more cheese.  The two layers of cheese melt in the oven and make everything hold together.

So delicious!!!  I made these as an appetizer for a Mexican meal and everyone loved them.  Easy to put together ahead of time which is great.  The beans and salsa are wonderful if you just pulse them in a food processor until mixed but still chunky and I added fajita seasoning since I was using taco seasoning in the rest of the meal.  If you let them sit a minute after cooking on a cutting board and then cut - they will not smoosh out of the tortilla as much!!

Bean coulds use more spices, like others suggested, and it was really messy! I was short on cheese so there might not have been enough to hold it together. Tasty on flax whole grain tortilla!

I made these for a quick dinner a few nights ago. I added shredded chicken, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, and onion powder. I made the quesadillas on the griddle, rather than in the oven. The perfect meal for a busy night. Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and fast too! Less than thirty minutes from start to tummy. I scaled this down to 1 serving but it still made 2 quesadillas. When I cut these a lot of filling oozed out the sides and when eating more of the same, so I am glad I didn't try to overstuff them as the recipe called for. I used Julio's brand salsa (a Texas product) and four cheddar cheese blend that was on hand. I will definitely fix this again it was so delicious!

These are fantastic at the end of a long day. I added some low sodium taco seasoning and some thinly sliced sweet onion - scallions work well too. I served with a side of guacamole. If you're counting calories, plain Greek yogurt works well instead of sour cream. If I have fresh cilantro, I put a bit on top. Yum!

Great recipe!  I have made this several time and have used several variation.  I do suggest adding seasoning to the beans and use less salsa.  I also don't mash or mix the beans--the cheese holds it all together pretty well.  Bon appetit!

This is a great quick dish.  Made using sundried tomato quesadilla shell, cheddar cheese, whole kernel corn and a mix of black and pinto beans!  Baked for 9 min at 400. great for a college kid as all ingredients are cheap!

I love recipes such as this -- quick, inexpensive and filling.  Since half of the salsa 'topping' is already added to the smashed beans, I stirred in the sour cream then seasoned with some pepper and cumin... maybe threw in a few sliced green onions for good measure.  I only made one quesadilla, so I crisped it in a pan on the stove --  the idea of baking multiple at once is great, tho.

A new favorite to add to the quick and easy week night dinner list!  Followed the recipe as is, but used a blender to mash the beans and salsa.  I will definitely make this again.

These were easy to make but I was a little short on cheese so I think next time they will even be better...I am going to add the black olivese and chilies like the inventor suggested next time..because I think that will really balance it out...quick to make and pretty filling

I didn't have salsa so I got creative with a tomato, green pepper, a little red onion, green onion and seasoned the beans with 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, about 3/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp chili powder. Could even use more seasoning. Baked at 400* for just under ten minutes for crunchy ww tortillas. Lots of room for adjustments here!

These were really delicious...I didn't use AS much salsa, but I some...and this is just delicious. I served this with some Spanish (yellow) rice and the Taco Chip Chicken recipe...a really awesome combo!

This was excellent. I could have spread the bean mixture out to at least 2 to 3 more quesadillas, 5 servings, is a bit thick. But it was wonderful, I also could have eaten the mixture with chips and said the heck with putting it between soft tortillas. I did add 2 tsp of cayenne pepper to it as well because my salsa was mild. I also didn't bake mine, i did it right on a flat top cast iron griddle....yummy. I'm make again, and my kids loved them with the baja sauce I made with it from here as well. Thanks.

I didn't have plain sour cream so I used French/onion dip.  Didn't turn out too badly.  Also, I like my tortillas on the softish side so this recipe was fine for that.  At various times, I mix up the ingredients as I love garlic, onion and mushroom combinations dotted around with the other stuff.

Awesome and easy recipe.  I left the beans fairly chunky and used a homemade smoky hot salsa.  Baking was super easy, supper was in less than 20 minutes.

My supermarket sells black beans plain or with seasonings.  I brought one can plain and one with the seasonings, used the rest of the ingredients as written and baked for 15 minutes in a 450 degree oven.  We loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Awesome!  I used a previous review and added 8 oz cream cheese, taco seasoning and green chilies to the beans and omitted the salsa.  I put it all in my crock pot to on hot to warm up.  My kids LOVED this.  My oldest daughter asked my to warm up the beans mixture for her lunch!

This is a great recipe - I did make a couple of miniscule changes though...I used the fat free refried beans recipe from this site with a couple of tweaks(as listed in my comment) and just layered with store bought salsa and cheddar cheese and served with sour cream...it is a fabulous, healthy and super fast dinner or lunch! Thank you so much for posting!

This is great! I made it for our super bowl party tonight and everyone loved it. I put the black beans in the food processor with a little bit of cumin and red pepper. Then I mixed in a whole jar of salsa to give it a little more flavor. Be careful to not put too much of the black bean mix in the quesadilla or they will get a little messy when you go to cut them. Great, EASY and quick recipe!

These were fast, easy and excellent.  I add onions and garlic to almost everything, so I sauteed them, then added the beans to warm them before mashing.  I also added some diced tomatoes and cumin in addition to the other ingredients stated..  They were delicious.  Will definitely make these again, as I almost always have all the ingredients on hand. Served with Mexican Rice from this site and a salad.  Made a great, fast meal that my husband and vegetarian son loved!  Thanks for a great recipe!

To the filling, I added chopped yellow onions, a couple of dashes of Sunflower Market's "Sweet Heat (hot) Sauce" and for the Salsa, I used Walmart's "White Corn and Black Bean Salsa."  I only made 2 Quesadillas so I had to GUESS at the amount to fill onto the tortillas.  Yep, I used too much and it oozed out during cooking.  I could not cut them in wedges so we used a fork and knife.  The flavor was still there!!  I am looking forward to another lunch!!

I loved these!  I added about 4oz of softened cream cheese into the bean/salsa mixture as well.  It makes quite a bit so my husband and I enjoyed these for a couple days.  The kids won't eat just beans, but I think if I did theirs with shredded chicken and maybe less of the bean mixture next time they would love these too.

These are really easy and filling.  I use Rotel instead of salsa in the bean mixture, and we use the salsa to dip the wedges in. The filling can be a little bland though (even with using hot Rotel). The salsa dip helps in that regard.

I made this for the kids' lunch today,
using the !OLE! Party Salsa to dip. It went over well with my two boys, who don't really mind if their food is bland.
They like pretty much anything in a tortilla or covered with cheese.

Excellent! We make this recipe a lot!  My 1-yr-old loves them!  We generally use extra-sharp cheddar cheese, and have found that they're even tastier using corn toritllas!

Surprisingly good for how simple this is! As others suggested, I added a little bit of taco seasoning to the black bean mixture. I also mixed corn into some of the mixture and made a few quesadillas with the corn, which made it even better. I ate them with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole on the side. Tasty.

If I could add a half a star more I would.  The only thing I do different is I add a package of taco seasoning to the bean mixture.  I'm sure that isn't great for the sodium content, but it adds a ton of flavor.  Also, I use wheat tortillas and light sour cream.  I make these at least once a week.

Got thumbs up from everyone! This is really good, I think what salsa you use will make a difference. I made my own that is similar to D's Salsa on this site. A+

i just popped these in. I used a smaller version, choosing to eye ball my ingredients, which were chopped onions, minced garlic, garlic salt, and a dab of garlic power. Mashed half a can of black beans with reduced cheese, and put on two soft tortillas and baked...thanks so much for the quick and easy recipe which I plan to use again. It was nice NOT to fry something...

Definitely add your own seasoning. I added some leftover taco seasoning, adobo and cayenne pepper. Very good vegetarian dish.

I love this recipe for using up extra black beans I have. I don't worry about using as many as called for, I just use whatever I have (usually just half a can). I've made this twice now and it is a huge hit with everyone who's had some. I puree my beans with the salsa for quickness, and also add a few chicken strips marinated in a baja citrus seasoning- delish!

These were fantastic! I think I added some spices to the bean mixture (I think chili powder; I don't remember what else). I cooked them in a skillet with a little cooking spray rather than in the oven (about 8 minutes per side), but I'm sure it would be fine either way. These were great to bring for lunch at work; they reheated very well in the microwave. As suggested I brought some salsa and sour cream to have on the side. Delicious!

Excellent!  Super easy & super fast.  I cut this recipe in 1/2 and mixed the chese in with the salsa & beans.  A little hot sauce helped with the "blandness". One quesadilla for tonight, one for lunch tomorrow!

This has been a standby for us for years.  I made these last night and because we were short on time, we even just nuked the quesadillas in the microwave.  You loose the crispness you get from cooking in the oven, but it's super fast!
