Not bad, but definitely needs something added.  I added extra cheese to the leftover dish and it made a huge difference (needed salt, I guess).  I also increased the cooking temp to 350 and cooked for half the time...much better.  Be sure to add a few extra tablespoons of liquid though...so that it doesn't dry out.

I was looking for a rice dish I could eat as a substitute for a main dish. I found it very bland (despite using plenty of cheddar) and took far too long. I kept wondering if there was something missing form the recipe as submitted. Sorry to say I wouldn't make it again.

This smelled so good cooking!  It needed a ton of salt, after it was already baked.  Also, the very top of the casserole was slightly hard-crunchy, from not being covered.  I would suggest covering it with foil 1/2 way through baking.  I think it needs more cheese too.  It wasn't quite as moist as I woul have liked.  If you make this and fine tune it, you'll probably really love it!

Even with extra salt very bland, way too much parsley. Not a keeper! Thanks though.

This was a lot work for little pay off.  It was extremely bland, and I even doubled the cheese.

Too much onion for our tastes, but not a bad flavor.  Could use some creative additions to liven it up some.

You need to add a cup of chopped green peppers to this to add more taste.  Also, some cilantro is good too.

OK...not as flavorful as I thought it would be. It would be better if chicken broth were substituted for the water maybe. Nice for kids though--cheesy and eggy!

I used some rice that I had already cooked with spices (garlic salt, onion powder, curry powder, cloves) and broth to make this. Absolutely fantastic. My roommate now will not stop calling me Chef Boyardee.

I thought this recipe was great.  I would not call it bland; mild, yes; but not bland.  If you want more of a kick add garlic, more onions, jalapeños, or something.  For lower fat content, I used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar.  I also used egg whites instead of whole eggs.  I skipped the parsley; not a fan. It’s rice with a twist.  Good job.

okay, it wasn't horrible, but I really did not care for it.  It was rather flavorless.  I added salt and that helped a little, but I won't make this one again.

Very good! It is bland, as rice USUALLY IS!!!!!!! but when you have a spicy or saucy main dish you usually want a bland side dish!

I liked the consistancy of this dish as well as the subtle flavor. Be sure to use fresh parsly. What's not great about this recipe is the long cook time. Maybe the oven temp could be raised.

This recipe was terrible. No flavor. Even plain rice is better. Before we cooked it we added black pepper, white pepper and salt since there was none in the recipe it's self. It was dry. On our plates we added a lot more salt and pepper plus butter and more cheese. In my opinion.. total waste of ingredients and time. Sorry.

I read all of the reviews and made some adjustments. I added a box of au gratin rice to give it some extra seasoning and added a bit more cheese, salt and garlic powder. It was a big hit at home.

This was a great way to spice up rice as a side item. The amount of parsley and cheese is great and both my husband and I loved it! The recipe doesn't say to add salt but all dishes need salt so obviously this would be no different. Add salt to taste and you've got a winner.

Extremely bland, however, my 5 year old LOVED it- probably because it was bland. But maybe better for younger tastebuds!
