WooHoooo, I get first dibs on reviewing a recipe!  This was an amazingly easy & delicious recipe.  I added extra carrots & onion and only used 2 thighs but it was a fabulous meal for two.  I threw the bones, leftover meat & veggies with the juices in a pan later to cook up some freezable broth as well!  The only thing I will change next time is to cut open the cooking bag about 45 min in to allow the skin to crisp up a little.  Otherwise, it was a Winner!  Thanks, MJ!!

Great recipe!  Hubby wanted turkey for Father's Day, I bought two turkey thighs and this fit the bill nicely :) 
I have cooked for many years and have to admit this was my first time using an oven bag. 

Turkey was wonderfully juicy and flavorful.    As suggested by another reviewer, I opened the bag and switched the broil on for the last few minutes to crisp up the skin.   

Thanks :)

I didn't have a cooking bag, so just used foil....opened the top the last few minutes so it could brown.  Did have to increase cook time though.  Put a few garlic slivers under the skin with olive oil.  Husband scarfed it down, delicious, and easy.  Comfort food without guilt!  Yummy

I love this recipe for turkey thighs. I've made it several times first in oven bags and now in a Dutch Oven. It turns out great every time! The turkey is always tender juicy and full of flavor. The veggies and the juices from the turkey are always delicious as well. It's an easy recipe too. All you need is time. It takes just over an hour from start to finish. I usually cook it with two thighs but keep the same amount of veggies. Delish!

I used butter. Two thighs. Ridiculous sweet potato. Salt-and-pepper. It was excellent. Love love the Reynolds cooking bags. Use them all the time

This was good. I wish I'd used more seasoning on the turkey but the recipe was nice and simple. I made the gravy as described by blending the juices and some of the veggies together. Will definitely make again.

Similar to other reviewer only used 2 thighs and increased the carrots. It smelled like Thanksgiving in my kitchen. There was a lot of meat for 2 but we are every bite because it was so delicious. Teamed with asparagus and pur√©ed potatoes and carrots. Will definitely make this again. Lot of flavor for a quick prep.

Loved the recipe. Both my husband and I found that the turkey was tender and juicy. We are both on a diet so I will prepare more celery and carrots instead of potatoes with the turkey. Nat

This dish took way longer than 20 minutes to prep. An hour cooking resulted in still hard veggies and still raw turkey. Had to finish it off under broiler then in microwave. The veggies were nearly swimming in grease from the thighs. Family waited a long time for mediocre unsatisfying dinner. Disappointed!

Works like a charm, but being one of those who doesn't follow directions strictly, I made some MINOR tweeks.  One, used "Wonder Roast Seasoning"( you know the stuff on those rotisserie chickens) I bought from one of our Fareways.  Two, added 2 tsp of orange zest to softened butter for under/over the skin.  And finally three, I brined the thighs overnight as I do all poultry.  Also, to solve the veggie doness dilemna, I put them in my steamer basket for 10 minutes and the into bag.   I am a THIGH person so turkey/chicken thighs are the only parts I eat.

I really enjoyed this and will do it again. I "wrapped" it all by foiling the 9x13 and covering it in foil and I didn't use season all. I also doubled the vegies and so I think the flour needed to be increased more than I did. This is a great dinner.

I added more veggies and adjusted the seasoning. And I made foil pockets for each serving. Good flavor. I'll make this again.

Simple recipe that really worked using only two chicken thighs and keeping the rest of the recipe the same. I didn't season the turkey enough. I baked for one hour and meat temp was 165 at that point but then opened bag for an additional fifteen minutes. Thankfully didn't taste overdone. Hubby liked it.

I didn't have any oven bags so I used a covered roasting pan.  Roasted an hour and 15 min then top off for 20 more to brown.  (thighs were partially frozen so I added the extra time)
I also used fresh sage and dried .  Absolutely delicious and succulent as you described.
