I love this cake! We have made it with cinnamon, with 1/2 the cinnamon and without cinnamon. Hubby likes no cinnamon, I like it with 1/2 the cinnamon. 
This is a great rich, moist, chocolate cake.

This is a very good, easy recipe.  May I strongly recommend that you use butter and not margarine.  Also, for the frosting, you don't need to measure the 3/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk. Just go ahead and use the rest of the can.  I'd like to try it again without the cinnamon.

I lost this recipe years ago and was THRILLED to find it here.  One of my all time favorites.  It is just awsome on the 2nd day- but never lasts that long.  (I always cut myself a piece for the next day and hide it.)  People just don't know what they're missing eating this up the 1st day!

I thought this cake was awesome, i'm 15 and wanted to make a "congratulations" cake for my brother, and this was perfect! I also added the chocolate chips, but inside the cake.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I liked this cake, my partner loved it, he can't stop eating it!  The only slight niggle with it I have is the cinnamon. I absolutely love cinnamon but am not keen on it in this recipe.  I made the cake as given but next time I will omit the cinnamon and add some grated orange zest to the cake mixture before baking and some orange juice to the icing. One other thing,  rather than greasing the cake tin, I lined it with baking parchment to ensure the cake came out cleanly.

This is a wonderful chocolate cake recipe. All the ingredients are staples that you probably already have. It's super fast and easy - comes together quickly, it bakes in no time (18 mins for me) and you frost it while it's still warm. You can whip it up while you're making dinner and it's ready to eat for dessert. Plus it's delicious. The icing is a great recipe in itself, it would be a perfect chocolate donut icing. I made the recipe as written except I added a little Khalua and reduced the cinnamon by half. You could probably adjust the flavoring any way you like and get a tasty result every time. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I also left out the walnuts.  Thank you for the recipe.

I love this cake.  I pretty much hate any homemade cake, they are always dry or lack flavor.  It smells divine with the cinnamon.  I was really unsure if it would turn out with the batter being so runny.  I almost added more flour, but decided to just go with the recipe and thrilled I did!   Boyfriend was craving something sweet and I had nothing in the house, so looked up some recipes.  I've never had this type of icing but loved it.  Not sure what I did, but the powdered sugar didn't want to stir in smoothly, little lumpy, but still great!

Yum!! I used 1 stick of regular butter and 1 stick of 50/50 Smart Balance... I omitted the nuts on the frosting, too. Didn't have a jelly roll pan so baked cake in a 9 x 13 and it took about 25-30 minutes instead. We LOVED this cake -- the cinnamon in it was just the right touch, and the cake was moist and delicious. We served it with french vanilla ice cream. This was my husband's 40th birthday cake, and he said he'd happily turn 40 again  next year if it means more of this cake!

This really does taste like Mexican Hot Chocolate in cake form because of the cinnamon. It is not a chocolate-chocolatey cake but the frosting makes up for it. The cake got denser the longer it sat and since the frosting is more like glaze, my fiance' likens it to cake doughnuts. I agree with him!

Just made this cake for my daughters birthday.  It was a moist cake, but just wasn't what I was looking for.  The cinnamon made it taste more like a cinnamon cake, than a chocolate cake.  I was hoping for a richer, more chocolatey cake(We love our chocolate!).  The picture makes it look very rich, but my cake was not nearly as dark looking.  I thought the icing was okay, but again not what I was looking for.  All in all it was easy to make.  If your looking for a deep, rich chocolate cake though, this isn't it.

I brought this to our friend's house on NYE and their 14 year old son took one bite and said, "this is the best chocolate cake I ever had!"  I only used 1/2 tsp cinammon since some of the reviewers didn't like the taste.  I used double the cocoa in the cake and also sprinkled chocolate chips on just before baking.  Had to double the frosting recipe and was glad I did - the original amount didn't cover enough.  This is my new signature cake that I will be bringing to all of my future events.  Easy and disappears in seconds!!!

I made this cake for my daughters birthday and it was a big hit.  My Mom is a wonderful cook and gave me rave reviews!  I did cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also used butter instead of margarine.

This is the best cake ever!  I didn't have the brown sugar so I used just regular granulated white sugar and I left out the nuts. (we don't eat nuts)  I think I will use the chocolate cake recipe from now on.  The icing is the best ever!  It is sticky, but I used cooking spray and it came out fine.

This recipe helped me make the moistest chocolate cake I've made this year. Modifications: 1/2 cup butter instead of a whole cup, a touch more cinnamon, 1 cup almond milk instead of water, 30min at 350F in a bunt pan.  I wonder how it would taste with an additional splash of coffee extract...mmmm....delicious, no doubt!

Excellent. I made some variations on the frosting. I browned the butter, and instead of using confectioners sugar I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and brought it to a boil after mixing in the sugar. My guests couldn't get enough of them.

Made this with only a couple minor changes.  First, I used cold brewed coffee in place of the water, and secondly, I used chopped Pecans in place of the walnuts in the frosting. Oh, I guess I made another sub of butter for the margarine. as that was what I had on hand, and only a couple shakes of cinnamon.  Is a very good cake that is not overly sweet, and quick to throw together.

Excellent recipe. I made one small cake for my daughter's friend's bday today, and the rest of the batter was made into cupcakes which turned out great. I half filled the cupcake liners, baked for 12mins, they rose beautifully.

For me this cake was ok as it looked more like a brownie than a cake. I also just think that I don't like coco mix and will use chocolate chips instead.

I made this for my 3 year old and I never bake anything. It came out great!! I didn't bake it long enough b/c I did it in a round pan that was 9 inches and the center sunk in and I was afraid it would be underdone. . . but everbody loved it. It was very dense and moist. I was confused about the amount of condensed milk b/c the top says it uses a whole can. It didn't taste sweet enough to me with 1/3 can so I put in more and it was great. I also added a 1/4 tsp of maple extract and it was yummy. Not a typical choc cake taste, but a little bit spiced (but not too much or believe me my son wouldn't have eaten one bite).

Delicious moist cake. Read reviews about how it is not a sweet cake and agree. I like the cinnamon, adds a unique taste. Frosting didn't make enough to my liking. Would make again!

I loved this cake--moist, tasty.  I don't like using sweetened condensed milk, so might have to figure out a replacement next time. I lessened the brown sugar (I always lessen the sweetener in sweets).  I am a spice cake fiend--just about everything I bake has one or more spices, so I loved the addition of cinnamon (which also helps regulate blood sugar so is good with sweets!) but my chocolate-loving father said "that's not chocolate cake, that's a spice cake"--so be forewarned this is not a decadently rich chocolatey cake.  I love it, though!

I made this into cupcakes- baked 12 of them for 15 minutes and they came out superb. Great flavor to the cupcake and sticky moist. Icing was a nice surprise too! My hubby loves them, and he doesn't usually like chocolate cake!  I didn't use cinnamon, i'll give it a try next time.

This is a moist and delicious cake. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, but let's face it, we're still indulging here.  I didn't have walnuts on hand, but pecans worked well instead.

I made this cake for my Mom's birthday.  She really loved it, as did everyone else.  One review said that it was better the second day, but I disagreed.  It was still good the second day, but the frosting started to soak through the cake, and the cake itself got a bit "soggy".  But the overall flavor was very good.

I used this recipe for my daughter's halloween party. I was surprised how moist and by the flavor. I have used recipes before with cinnamon and didn't care for the flavor. This recipe is awesome!

I did this for my golf club luncheon.  It was great, however I also added chocolate chips while the cake was cooling and when the frosting ws done and applied, I sprinkled the cake with toasted coconut.  Really delicious.

This recipe was delicious and rich!  Thanks for sharing!  I had to change one thing and that was only because my sons' schools are "nut free".  I put coconut in the icing instead of nuts, and it still came out wonderful!!  Thanks again!

My husband says I'm being too picky but I was disappointed by this recipe.  It was good but not worth making again.  The frosting is more like a chocolate walnut glaze and I found the cinnamon overpowered the chocolate flavor in the cake.  Good texture though and very easy to make.

This cake is fantastic.  Very moist and I like the texture of the icing. I added half the cinnamon it called for and still found it overpowering, but I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon. Thanks for sharing your recipe!
