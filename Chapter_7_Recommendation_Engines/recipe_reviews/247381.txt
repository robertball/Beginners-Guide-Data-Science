I'm a believer!! These are so easy and fun to make. I didn't have any cream of tartar, so I used 1/2 tsp (total) lemon juice. The outcome was the most subtle hint of rose and a bit of a lemon aftertaste. I think these are a perfect amount of sweetness. I baked for two hours, then left them in until cooled. They came out light and crispy. They crumble easily but you can bite into them without them disintegrating. What a great recipe. Next time, I'm adding chocolate or dipping them in white chocolate... Thank you for sharing.

I never thought it would work, but it did! I could only whip it to a medium peak, but that was good enough to do the job. 

The rose flavor balances beautifully with the lemon giving it a taste i am sure french royalty would have loved!

 I added some pink food colouring to the mixer (paste form), and that makes them even more lovely!    

5/5. So dam impressed!
