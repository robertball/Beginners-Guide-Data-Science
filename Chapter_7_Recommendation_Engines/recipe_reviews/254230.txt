it is tasty,  but came out rather runny.  needs a bit more kick as well. I might try adding another chipotle pepper and reduce the reserve juice next time

This is much better than store brands. I made one alteration.  I spilled the reserve bean liquid so I used 1/4 cup of chicken broth instead.

This turned out tasty. It was a little bit runnier than what I am used to so next time I will drain a bit of the juice off the peas. The flavor was spot on though!
