I followed b.d. weld's advise and made a dip rather than piping them.  I do not care for olives and thought of omitting them, but I didn't.  If I make it again I will leave them out. Other than that, they were good.

Addictive! Shame on me for not piping this on the pretzels but after looking at the ingredients I wanted this as a dip. I may have gone overboard with the jalapenos but in my cookbook that's a good thing. I adjusted the recipe for 4 oz. of cream cheese, next time I'll make it to cover the entire 8 oz. of cream cheese. Piped or not this is a keeper.

These were easy to throw together and tasted delicious.  My advice is to triple the recipe to use the entire block of cream cheese, as the original recipe only makes about a (small) fist-sized amount of topping.  I didn't feel like wasting a pastry bag, so I used a ziploc bag (and did have some trouble "piping").  If I make this again, I'd serve it in a bowl with allow guests to add as much or little as they like to their pretzel crisps.  I left the olives out per personal preference.  THANK YOU, for the recipe!

I didn't pipe it, but made as a dip for crackers, delicious! I did keep the onion and olives chunky, and added a little bit of garlic powder and hickory smoked salt.  I used shredded co-jack because that's what I had on hand; but next time would like to try it with cheddar.  This hit the spot... thanks!

The only thing that I changed was I mixed all the ingredients together and served it as a dip. It tasted fantastic! Would be a great filling for bacon wrapped jalapenos. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I didn't do a fine chop wanted to see and have a little crunch from the veggies. Great recipe!
