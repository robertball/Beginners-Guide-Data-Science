I made this recipe exactly as written, and we loved it! I used the high setting on my crockpot, and ran just slightly over 5 hours.All the ingredients were already in my frig and pantry, including  part of a ham, and all that was required was opening a few cans and cutting up potatoes and ham. The recipe would easily accommodate additional veggies, but the soup turned out delicious as written. The cream cheese added just the right amount of creaminess, without turning it into a thick gloppy soup. It was easy to prepare and satisfying on our cold, snowy day. I'm about to have some for breakfast!
