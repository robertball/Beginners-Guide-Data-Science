Curiosity got me with this recipe because of the fact that there is no salt or vanilla, but I love cream!  These are delicious even without frosting--as you see them in my photo.  They kept their shape pretty well and were very easy to handle.  I rolled them between two sheets of parchment and had no problem at all with them being too sticky.  Start with half the amount of sugar and add as necessary.  I got 20 cookies from half a recipe, and the cooking time of 10 minutes was perfect.  They are flaky and light and have a very subtle taste!  My granddaughters will definitely want them frosted, and that will leave you with many options!  Thanks for the recipe, Cindy.

I made these and was very disappointed! They were extremely bland with no real flavor and the overall texture was to cakey even though I did roll the dough to the 1/4" as instructed. The only thing I did like was how easy they were to make. I may consider making them again and adding almond or vanilla extract to see if I can improve the flavor.

This is a very basic recipe with basic, classic ingredients. The cookies were delicious. The best way to describe them is like small bites of homemade pie crust. I did not ice mine, but I did dip them in a larger-crystal sugar (Sugar in the Raw) before baking them. If you use quality ingredients you should love these. They are not for those who prefer a sweeter tasting cookie.

recipe was easy enough, but these cookies have zero flavor.

I changed this up a bit, partly because I wasn't paying attention, oops!  My intentional changes were that I put the 1/2 cup sugar directly into the batter & I didn't feel like rolling so made these as drop cookies.  My accidental change (which turned out perfectly to my preferences!) was that I baked these for 8 minutes at 350.  These are a very mild flavored cookie, reminiscent of pie crust and we loved them. Next time I will add both vanilla & salt.

The cookies were very bland even with the sugar coating. I suppose that's good since there wasn't much sugar in the recipe.  There are several better recipes to choose from.

Soft and not too sweet. I added lemon baking emulsion and these cookies melted in my mouth.
