This recipe was excellent.  I agree with another reviewer, you do need a lot more oil, don't be afraid to use a lot, it really helps in softening the tortillas.  I made a very small batch, and cooked it in an 8 x 8 pan, all crammed together, next time I think that I will use a cookie sheet, that has not been greased, since the tortillas have been dipped in oil you really don't need it.  Doing this I am hoping that I will get them crispy all around, perhaps I will even turn them and bake them for a couple of extra minutes.  Anyway the taste was great, and I will make again!!!  I boiled my chicken breasts on the stove until just done and then shredded with forks, seemed to work just fine.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Great, great Recipe with a few modifications-
First off, do not use cheddar cheese-it adds a funky taste.  I would recommend a nacho cheese blend.  Second, you will need a lot more oil than what is suggested for.  I ended up using about a tablespoon for every 2 tortillas.  When using the corn tortillas, you need them as pliable as possible which requires the oil.

My extremely picky son loves these! I made a bunch and froze them, then pulled them out and straight into the oven and they do very well. I used alot more oil than what the recipe said also.

These are wonderful and taste much better than the store bought ones, although it did take quite some prep time.  I added in chopped green onions, garlic/onion powder, blk pepper and diced jalepenos (for a kick), left out the white cheese since I didn't have any on hand.  Served these with hot sauce, they were gone in minutes!

This recipe is always a HUGE hit at my house.  To cook the chicken breasts I put a tablespoon of salsa or picante sauce on each breast and broil them for 8 minutes on each side.  They come out so moist and tasty.  I also use Goya's Con Azafran seasoning in place of the ground cumin.

This is a simple and fantastic recipe. I grilled the chicken and tortillas instead of frying in oil.

These were easy to assemble.  I added some additional seasonings and one finely diced jalapeno to give it some "punch" -- there were no leftovers.  I'm not sure I'd make them again though.

Yum! My husband & I really enjoyed these!!! To speed prep even further, I purchased a rotisserie chicken. I used all of it, so I upped the salsa to a 16 oz. jar (Santa Barbara brand roasted pepper chile). I didn't measure the cheese  (monterey-jack) or meat mixture - I eyeballed it, (just be sure you don't fill your tortillas too full....). I also skipped the frying in oil step. All I did was lightly spray ea. tortilla w/ Pam and heat both sides (5 sec. MAX) in a hot skillet. I then blotted my tortillas to soak up any excess grease (too much oil = sogginess) and proceeded to fill ea. one. I placed all 12 flautas (that's how many tortillas were in the pkg. I purchased) on a cookie sheet & lightly sprayed w/ cooking spray one last time b4 placing in the oven to crisp up. It took dbl. the amt. of time called for to crisp to my liking, but the wait was well worth it! Oh, and I placed my oven rack near the top for the final 20 min. of baking & I think this helped a LOT. Since I have so much meat mixture left, I'm going to freeze it for another batch.  Served over a shredded lettuce / chopped tomato salad w/ Mexican rice, refried beans & Mike's hard margaritas on the side. To replicate Chevy's flautas (which I LOVE!), I poured melted queso & pineapple chipotle salsa over mine and a bit of jalapeno jelly on the side. My husband spooned salsa over his. Thanks for sharing, Arlene. I'm not even going to try HeidiS's chicken taquitos because your flautas were THAT good! :-)

I've used this recipe as a basis for other types of flautas before, but tonight was the first time I tried the recipe as written. The verdict? Tasty, but needs a lot more spices, for our personal taste. Next time I'll add diced jalapenos and sliced green onions to the chicken mixture. Thanks for the recipe, I've made taco meat flautas, buffalo chicken flautas, all kinds of flautas now :) P.S. For those watching their fat intake, you can spritz the tortillas with cooking spray & warm them in the oven. If you do this, you need to spray them again after you roll them & before baking (to get that crispy golden brown outside) otherwise they dry right out!

Awesome recipe.   I had this same recipe several years ago but lost it.  thanks so much for the recipe.  I also use hot picante and it still doesn't make them too hot.

I've been making these for 20 years now and everyoe who's ever had them begs me to make them more often. I call them chicken taquitos since technically a flautas is made with a flour tortilla. My suggestion is to bake them on a wire cooling rack placed on a baking sheet otherwise you get very soggy bottoms. I also lower the temp a little so the ends aren't burned before the middle is crispy.

Here is a tip for softening your tortillas without frying in oil.  I heat up my griddle and I lay a tortilla on it for a few seconds until it is warm and pliable.  I then remove it and fill with filling.

Made these tonight; they were a huge hit with the entire family! I discovered a good workaround for softening the corn tortillas that uses MUCH less oil. I sprayed both sides of the first tortilla with canola oil cooking spray, and laid it on a paper towel. Then I just sprayed one side of the remaining tortillas (I halved the recipe), stacking as I went. After I added the last one, I inverted the whole stack and heated each tortilla for about 10 seconds per side. This technique added just enough oil to allow them to crisp up perfectly in the oven, too. I then followed the directions as written, using only cheddar cheese (what I had on hand). I baked them for 15 minutes, then increase the heat to 425 and baked for another five -- crispy and slightly brown on the outside; moist and chewy on the inside. Served with a little guacamole and light sour cream. Perfect!

This recipe is a great starting point for yummy flautas. I marinated the chicken in a mixture of lime juice, red chile powder, garlic and olive oil. Then grilled it. I also used two 16 oz. bottles of picante sauce, doubled the cumin amount and added 2 chopped jalapenos for spice.  Rather than mixing the chicken directly with the picante sauce mixture, I just dabbed the picante sauce onto the tortilla and chicken by itself. I think this gave it more flavour and made it juicier.  I also didn't use cheddar cheese... just shredded jack.  And served them with jalapeno jelly.

This recipe is great as is and everyone should try it. The other night I wanted chicken flautas, but didn't have any salsa or oil. Instead of going to the store I did what any cook would, improvised. I mixed my shredded chicken with spicy taco seasoning and finely chopped sautéed onions. I heated my tortillas in the microwave wrapped in a damp paper towel and then sprayed them with cooking spray before baking. I use Monetary Jack cheese. They were awesome!

Flautas are a favorite of mine and these were excellent! Next time I'll be sure and have some guacamole to serve with them. With refried beans and salsa, plus a green salad, we had a great dinner.

i substitued ground beef for the chicken. i added onions and green bell peppers to the mixture and browned it. i used corn tortilias, i really think that's the key. flour seems doughy after re-heating, not bad just not as good. i used mexican cheese to add to the mixture while we were dry heating the tortilias. wife rolled up the mixture and we then pored mild rotel tomatos and green peppers,more mexican cheese over the top. baked it at 350 for 20 17 minutes. we served it with fresh lettuce and ripe tomatos on top with some sour cream. we made 8...wonderful! we also served 1-pot pinto beans with them ( that recipe is on this site) very good recipes, highly recommended!

I think people look at recipes and take them at face value. When in reality any recipe is just a template. Its just something you can follow but change to your preference. With that being said i love this recipe. I make a homemade salsa to top the flautas with. Also i use bone in chicken breast that I simmer in chipotle peppers, onion, green bell peppers, garlic, tomatoes and chicken broth. There are so many variations you can try with the filling. love this recipe.

I am putting together a Tex-Mex dinner for Christmas Eve and wanted to try out this recipe to see how it would fare. First, the amount of oil does need to be increased so take the advice other members gave. Second, the chicken mixture is soo simple to mix and tastes great...easily adjusted for spicier tastes. Third, I allowed them to cool about 10min and cut them in halves and they maintained their shape beautifully. We are going to serve them stacked this way with dips for our guests. A perfect recipe for hostesses short on time!

I was amazed at this recipe. I love flautas but have been afraid to try it on my own because of all the deep frying involved (I'm trying to stay as healthy as possible). I took the advice of a previous reviewer who gave great advice. I sprayed my skillet with nonstick canola spray, then sprayed both sides of the corn tortilla w/ more canola spray. I cooked them for about 10 sec on each side to warm & soften them for rolling. I patted the tortillas w/ a towel to collect any extra grease but there really wasn't any. I filled the 10 tortillas up (I used red fat monterary jack cheese) & baked them for 20 min. Came out great & without the unhealthy frying! Thanks so much for sharing.

These were great!  My husband & I both enjoyed these!  I scaled the recipe back & used double the picante sauce by accident as I was pouring from the bottle.  I made for 8 & only boiled 1 chicken breast & a another very small piece.  PLENTY of meat!  It made up like 11 little flautas.  We just picked up & ate, nothing on top & they were delicious!  This ones a keeper!

Usually I substitute the chicken with ground beef since it is my husbands favorite. I, personally, love the chicken. We also double it and freeze some to take them out in small portions and reheat them in the toaster oven for an easy snack or meal.

This was a great recipe, I did change a couple things because it is what I had in the house.  I used chile verde sauce instead of picante.  I sauted some onion with the chicken. But the best thing is I sprayed the tortilla's with pam on both sides and it worked GREAT!  I try not to use to much oil when ever I can help it.  Anyway great recipe!!

Instead of frying the tortillas, I microwaved them first.  A Mexican friend of mine told me to do that.  Other than that, I made no changes.  Very good!  Even the kids enjoyed.

This dish is quick and easy and it tastes great!  My husband I used Louis Rich pre-cooked shredded chicken to make it even faster and it tasted wonderful.  I am planning on making it for company (and not telling them how it easy it was!)

I know I'm going against most of the reviews but we really did not care too much for this recipe.  It was o.k. at best.  I probably won't make this again.

These were great!  They took some work but
were worth it.  I especially like how crispy they were even though they weren't deep fried.

Very good!  I make these often.  :)  I think they taste just like in an authentic Mexican restaurant. :) But they are way cheaper and better when you do it yourself.  Quite simple to make too!

I made mine using leftover shredded pork roast - they were excellent!  My husband loves flautas and at first was very skeptical of baking them rather than frying.  He gave it 5 stars and told me I can make this again anytime.

These are absolutely amazing! The filling was just fantastic. Here is what I did aside from the basic recipe: I roasted the chicken breasts in the oven brushed with a little bit of olive oil and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and taco seasoning. To shred meat, I put the still hot chicken into my stand mixer and used the paddle attachment (so easy and quick!). To the shredded chicken mixture I also added diced green onion and some diced jalapenos which I had presoaked in ice water to draw out some of the heat. I also omitted cheddar cheese...nothing beats plain old Monterrey Jack on Mexican food! I used quite a bit more oil to soften the tortillas then the recipe calls for. I baked the flautas at 350 for about 30 minutes and they were perfectly crisp! I served with Mexican style rice, refried beans, and guacomole salad, just like at my fav Mexican restaurant and let me tell you what...everyone in my family LOVED it! I'll definitely put this in the regular dinner rotation! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I thought these were excellent. I used taco seasoning instead of cumin and flour tortillas as that is all I had. I didnt put the salsa inside but just used it to dip in after.

Amazing!! I changed the recipe to make 20 and did exactly what I was told. Then I had guacamole, sour cream, salsa, shredded lettuce, refried beans and the rest of the cheese in bowls that the family could scoop on their plate and dip their flautas in! They tasted just like the ones from the Mexican restaurant we go to!

This may be a good recipe, however, flautas are made with flour tortillas. Taquitos are made with corn tortillas. Just so everyone is clear, these are not "authentic". Still good though.

Very good, very easy. I used white corn tortillas and let them fry in the oil maybe 10 seconds each. They were still flexible enough to wrap but got very crispy in the oven. I finished them under the broiler for a minute to really crisp up. My family LOVED this.

I usually don't like to rate recipes if I have any sort of major alteration, but I had to make an exception this time.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn (and didn't fry in oil before).  This were suprisingly good.  I was looking for something easy when I found this recipe, and thought I would try it out even though I was sceptical.  I will definately make these again.  Very easy, fast, and takes very few ingredients.  It's a keeper!

These are sooo good... I ate 3 of them in minutes!  I boiled my chicken and shredded it.  Then added a can of enchilada sauce, sour cream, green onions, and a cup of cheddar cheese to the mix. Had to restrain myself from eating more!

Many reviewers said they used more oil, but I dont use any.  It sounds weird, but all you have to do is heat up your dry pan and heat the tortillas for a 15 seconds or so on each side, and they get plenty soft.  I also used low fat cheese and they were tasty and healthy!

I've been making these for YEARS but would only have given this recipe 3 stars if made exactly as the recipe states. So, I finally decided to try some modifications to see if I could make a pretty good dish even better and NOW I'd give this recipe 5 stars!

First off I seasoned the chicken with some chipotle seasoning then I cooked it in a pan with a little oil and water until done. It made the chicken sooo moist and added some great flavor.

Then I put it in the bowl with a little more chipotle seasoning, some onion powder, some cumin and a little garlic. I also added a little sour cream and then the salsa and cheese. I used a Mexican cheese blend that had no cheddar in it - just Monterey Jack cheese and some Mexican cheeses. It was soooo yummy and the chipotle seasoning did not make it to spicy at all; just gave it a little bite!

This totally bumped this recipe from a 3 star recipe to a 5 star recipe. I will definitely make this again with my modifications! Even my kids, who will complain about the slightest hint of spicy in any recipe, love this and wolf them down! Delicious!

Fantastic!  I would make my shells more crispy next time and follow the directions and use a cookie sheet.  I would also add a few more spices because we like spicy food.

I made this and it was exceptional! The KEY to the recipe is to make your own salsa! It tastes ten times better! Also I just the mexican "cojita" crumbly cheese.

Very good!  I used the meat from a rotisserie chicken and mixed with the picante per the recipe.  I also added some cilantro - I didn't have any fresh, but around here we can get little cilantro cubes (next to bullion cubes in the grocery).  I also added a dab (1/2 tsp?) per flauta of cream cheese with chives, along with monterrey jack cheese!  Outstanding!  The only reason I didn't go five stars is because the kids didn't like the toughness of the corn tortillas, but they were much more moist than flautas I've seen in a restaurant.

These were easy to make and enough for an extra dish for freezer but they were just okay. Don't think I'd make them again.

This was great. I poached the breasts in chicken broth flavored with some oregano, onions and carrots for about 15-20 minutes first. While that's going on, you have time to shred the cheese and fry the tortillas. Instead of jack, I used the white cheese from Mexican markets, I think it's called Queso Fresco. I wish I would have rolled the tortillas up tighter because a few did open up at the sides. I would make these again any day, as the whole family loved them. Yum!

This recipe was so yummy.  Everyone from my husband to my 2 year old neice loved them.  Instead of dipping the tortillas in hot oil, I sprayed a hot griddle with PAM and then put the tortillas on and sprayed the other side with PAM.  After about 20-30 sec(depending on how hot it is) I flip and then in 15 sec they are done.  I put them in my torilla/pancake warmer and they stay nice and soft until I need to fill them. Also after I roll them I give them another spray of PAM and they come out perfectly crisp.

Had a very good flavor, and even my picky kids loved them! However to be honest i do have a problem with this recipe. Everyone knows that if you use a corn tortilla it is a taquito, and if you use a flower tortilla it is a Flauta.  :)

I had so hoped this would be outstanding. Not at all.  I was grateful that I had two of my local grocer's dressings to make it taste like more than chicken wrapped in corn tortillas.  I think instead of salsa I'll use the dressings from the grocer instead.

I made this with soft taco size flour tortillas instead. I also made the process of making them much easier by putting some oil on a tortilla, then rubbing another tortilla on top to spread the oil around both tortillas. I did this with all the tortillas instead of heating the oil and dipping them in as the recipe stated. It was easier and less messy! They turned out perfect!!! Made about 2 dozen.

Very good! I also added 1/4 tsp. of mesquite seasoning since I'm not a big fan of cumin, that helped balance out the flavor. They are very flavorful but not overly hot (so if you like hot, serve with extra salsa for dipping!) The kids loved them, and that makes any recipe a winner in my book.

We altered this recipe to suit our tastes and it came out very good, tastes very similar to the flautas I always order at the local Mexican place.  We used flour tortillas, our preference over corn. Instead of frying the tortillas in oil first we heated in the microwave just to soften, wrapped chicken mixture up, then sprayed each flauta all over with cooking spray, this made the tortillas nice and crispy when baked!

I used more Monterey jack, skipped the cheddar cheese altogether.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion about using nonstick spray and heating 5 sec on each side.  I had to cook longer than suggested, and even then the bottoms of the flautas were soft (used a cookie sheet).  Next time I may try turning them over 1/2 way thru.  Served with guacamole and  sour cream.  Entire family, including kids, ate them.

Had to change the recipe quiet a bit... added jalepenos for kick. Warmed the tortilla before rolling THEN fried them. Baked for about ten minutes and were gone in the same amount of time!

When you order flautas in a restaurant in my area they are always made with Flour tortillias. Taquitos are made with corn. But anyway, whatever these are, they are very good. I made them with Guacamole

I tried this recipe for the first time a couple of years ago--now I make it for a dish to pass at many get togethers. It has become my daughter's and my signature dish to pass. I have had it requested many times and it doesn't get much easier than this! The only change I have made is using a mexican cheese blend from the grocery store.  Other than that, the recipe is perfect!! It definitely helps to have 2 people making this recipe-one to cook the tortilla and one to fill it.

I made the mistake of trying not to fry the tortillas beforehand.  I warmed them up in the microwave before filling and rolling them up.  A lot of the tortillas cracked even before cooking.  I brushed the tops with canola oil, then flipped halfway through baking time and brushed the other side.  Even though the presentation was off, the flavor was great, and my Bunco party really enjoyed them.  But they are a lot of work, especially if you actually follow the recipe, like I should have done.  Also, they didn't reheat well at all.

Use flour tortillas instead of corn and lightly brush the rolled flauta with oil.  Bake 15 or so minutes and flip to the other side.  Delicous and much lower in fat than deep frying like I used to do.  This is a family favorite.

This is a kid-approved recipe at my house. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and softened the tortillas in the microwave and sprayed with cooking oil to cut down fat/calories. I had purchased flour tortillas by mistake but they were fine - will try corn next time. I used the "10-minute zesty salsa" recipe from this site and made it extra spicy and poured it over the shredded chicken a few hrs in advance. I added extra cumin and mixed in 2 oz cream cheese to the chicken mixture when preparing to fill the tortillas as per previous reviewers. The chicken mixture was so good leftovers were eaten alone.

Used this recipe as a guide...cooked a chicken breast with ~2-3oz cream cheese, ~1/4c salsa, ~1/8t cumin, ~6drops lime juice then shredded.  Put into 9 microwaved corn tortillas with the cheeses listed.  Rolled, sprayed with cooking oil spray & baked about 25min.  Served with rice & corn & dipped in sour cream & catalina (kids).  Quite tasty; can't say I followed the recipe exactly...much tastier than something like a taquito that you'd buy from the store.

This was pretty good, though I did deviate from the recipe a bit based on personal tastes.  I halved the recipe and stuffed it in 12 tortillas (so they were a little more filled than called for).  I didn't have picante sauce so I used Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper salsa, which worked wonderfully.  I understand how people could find it dry with picante sauce since the sauce doesn't have as much liquid.  I boiled my chicken ahead of time, shredded it, and had it sit in the salsa for a few hours.  I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin (love it!), 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, and about 1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper to the mix to spice it up.  To make it easier, I just microwaved the tortillas until soft, wrapped it up, and then sprayed oil onto the rolls before baking.  Crisped up nicely.  Served with sour cream, but would love to try it with some other sauce.  As for flavor, I think that you need to use a very good tasting sauce/salsa for the filling because that can make it poor.  Once summer comes around I'm going to get a batch from the farmer's markets and use that since it should make it taste far better than those preservative filled salsas at the store.

Delicious! I did use half picante sauce/half salsa, and more than called for. I imagine this would have been super dry with the original amount because I only used 2 chicken breasts and it wasn't enough. Added garlic  to the chicken mixture. I did not fry my tortillas, instead I heated them in a dry skillet until pliable. I then sprayed the flautas with a little cooking spray before sticking in the oven. They were super crispy and delicious. Topped with fat-free plain yogurt, avocado, cilantro, salsa, and corn. YUM! Thanks :)

So yummy! I had never had these before but I'm a huge fan of anything with cheese and tortillas! I used shredded rotisserie chicken, used my own salsa instead of picante sauce (so easy to make and SO worth it) and didn't have any monterey jack so I just stuck with the cheddar. It took me a minute to get a routine to put them together but once I got going, they went together pretty painlessly. Oh, and I used about 1/2 cup oil in the pan to dip the tortillas in completely. Definitely making these again soon.

These were really good! I cooked my chicken in the crock pot with a jar of HOT salsa, low for 5 hours, shred then 1 hour more. I took the tip of putting my corn tortillas in a damp paper towel in the microwave for 30 seconds. I did 3 tortillas at a time. I put a lot more than 1 Tbs per chicken per tortilla simply to cut on the servings of tortillas per person...less calories :) I used fat free cheddar and we dipped them in fat free sour cream. I used a baking sheet sprayed with Pam and I also used Pam on the flautas...no oil. They were crispy, spicy and tasty. Will definitely make again, thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Even my picky daughter ate them. we stuffed with more than a tablespoon of chickes so we only yielded about 18, but I thinkg they were better more filled - less like a taquito. Brought left overs for today!

This is the only recipe that I have ever made were all three of my kids eat them up until they can't eat anymore.  Then they eat any left overs the next day.  These NEVER go to waste.  The first time I made them I fried them in olive oil.  Now, to make the assembly quicker, I warm the tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds.  They are great!  Wish I could give it more stars!

I had flautas at a Mexican restaurant and wanted to recreate them at home for my family.  I must admit I only used this recipe as guide.  I rubbed my chicken breasts in chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper, broiled them, then shredded them.  I didn't have picante sauce, so I made some salsa verde.  Also, at the restaurant they were served with a jalapeno jelly and I tried to recreate that too.  It came out wonderful, and my family loved it.  Thanks

I will definitely make these again.  However, they didn't get a five star from me because I had to add a considerable amount of seasoning to the shredded chicken before I could wrap them (luckily, I tasted it before I began wrapping!).  I used half flour tortillas and half corn just to see if we liked one more than the other.  We prefered the corn tortillas.  Also, instead of putting in the filling and then the cheese and trying to get it all to roll up in the tortillas, I added the shredded cheese to my chicken so that I only had one thing to wrap up.  It was much easier and probably less messy this way.  It definitely takes a little more garlic, cumin, and onion powder to get the taste right though.

For the work that was involved, they just weren't worth it to me. I made them for a party & they looked horrible. The corn tortillas were pliable when I worked with them, but busted open when they baked. They are ok if you are keeping them at home, but terrible on presentation for a group.

These were great!  My family loved them.  I did, however, use flour tortillas, as suggested by others, and I needed more oil than what was called for.  Otherwise, I kept everything else the same. I will make these again, for sure!

Whether it be taquito, flauta, taco or burrito, I do know what these things are...Delicious! I ended up using flour tortillas that did go a little doughy on me when they were fried, but the mixture inside definitely makes up for it. The cumin was omitted as neither my boyfriend or I am fond of it, but they still tasted just as great. These are best served with homemade salsa and guacamole, and I accompanied them with a black bean and rice mixture.

I liked these.  Since the portions were so large (because of the amount of filling it made) they were more like chimichangas....which is what I wanted them to be.  They turned out very nice and crispy. I served with sour cream, guac. and some lettuce.  Thanks for the post.

Yum!  I make a pork taquito that is similar to this, but it has to be fried.  Baking these made them taste as good as fried, but was a lot less messy!  I also froze about half of them because the recipe made so many.  Just take them out of the freezer as you need them, put them on a baking sheet, and heat up in the oven.  Great for quick dinner or big snack.

I made 8 flautas with 2 chicken breasts, 4 oz. salsa, and about half the cheese.  I kept a skillet at medium heat, put the corn tortilla in the skillet sprayed both sides with canola oil (you could probably use Pam, but I purchase spray canola oil at Whole foods) and warmed for 10 seconds on each side, just enough to warm and soften for rolling.  Then I filled with chicken and cheese right on the cookie sheet and rolled.  They baked for just under 20 minutes.  Next time I might try resting the tortillas on paper towels to absorb some of the oil, but really they did not have much oil.  Both my husband and I loved them and I will definitely make them again.

Shredded chicken is remarkable easy to make. One thing I've done a couple of times (and enjoyed) is to use feta cheese in the recipe. It adds a totally different taste. Anyways. This recipe is great, you can throw the flautas in the oven, start watching your favorite episode of Law and Order and eat the flautas during the last 15 minuts of the show. Enjoy!

This recipe turned out fabulous.  I made these flautas for a birthday party, and they dissapeared quickly.  Although their were alot of steps, I thought they were relatively easy and my son helped me out (he's 9).  Like another reviewer mentioned, they were not as spicy as I would have liked, so next time (there will definitly be a next time) I will use a hotter sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were enjoyed by my whole family!  I've made flautas the hard way before (frying them) and this was a delight compared to that!  They turned out yummy, though I think I'd like them to be a bit spicier next time -- maybe use hotter hot sauce?

Wonderful recipe. My wife is not a huge fan of Mexican dishes (I could have Mexican food everyday) but loved this recipe, it has now become one of our favorite meals. Try adding onions, peppers and/or mushrooms for a nice variation. Topped with sour cream is a plus!

Awesome! I added 2oz of cream cheese to chicken filling.  I baked a boneless skinless breast with salsa on top, diced onions, and diced green pepper in oven 350 for 30 min to make chicken shred.

I dont use picante ,but salt,pepper. My family loves these! They eat them with sour cream instead of the salsa. 
I make corn to go with them!

Good recipe, but I added a few things to the chicken to spice it up a little. I added some lime juice, onion powder and garlic powder. Also just used regular salsa instead of Picante sauce. Overall a keeper!

Made a few modifications for our preferences.  To cook the chicken, we made a dry rub of salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne & chili powder.  Sauteed it & shredded.  Used homemade salsa instead of jarred picante.  We also added 3 diced fresh jalapenos to the mix.  We used shredded taco blend cheese & put in only about 6 ounces total to the mix & used about 2 more ounces on top of the wrapped flautas.  We tried rolling as directed, but found it difficult.  So we switched to stuffing & rolling the shells before we fried them.  That seemed to work much better.  We had a few different choices for topings: sour cream, guacamole & our favorite was hot pepper jelly (also from this website).  Overall, it's a great starter recipe, great to build on & make your own.

These are a regular in our house. We make a family assembly line and make up a bunch of these. They freeze great after being cooked, and reheat well. We've found the "thin" yellow corn tortillas are easiest to work with, and you do need way more than a Tblsp. of oil to prepare them.

I did think this was very tasty that is why I had to give it so many stars, but the preparation was difficult even though I used leftover chicken that I seasoned for his recipe ahead of time.  I don't see myself putting in the effort to make this again.

I thought this recipe was really good. I decided to do the chicken and corn chili recipe from this site for the filling. Then I drained the chicken and shredded it and added 3/4 a can of enchilada sauce to add some zest and mixed it well. I followed the rest of the recipe like it says and it was a big hit! I will make this again!

I love this recipe. We have made them over and over, they taste great everytime! We don't grease the cookie sheet and I always make sure there is extra cheese for the top. We eat them with rice and a green salad. Yum!

Very good. We just microwaved the tortillas for a few seconds to soften them up, instead of frying them at all, and it tased great (and saved on fat/calorie content).

Very tasty, went perfect with Mexican Rice III. I gave a 4 because after baking the flautas for 20 min. they were still soft, not crispy at all. They looked like enchiladas so I turned the broiler on high and cooked both sides of the flautas until crisp and golden. That made them sturdy enough to dip in salsa or pour queso on top. Also, don't sprinkle extra cheese on top before baking! That will make them more soggy.

Yummy!  I did use more oil to fry the tortillas and pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar. I used a black bean and corn salsa to add more taste and texture to the flautas.  Serve it with the tortilla soup from allrecipes for a great dinner!

Love this recipe! I like to saute green bell peppers, onions, and even mushrooms when I'm in the mood to the mixture. Really spices it up! I add a little more picante sauce to the mixture. I also make mine a little fuller and smother with homemade queso before serving ( fork necessary ). Rice or mexican potatoes go well with this entree. These are a hit at the dinner table!!

Took a bit more time for mine to get properly crispy, maybe because I REALLY blotted the oil off? but totally worth the wait.  I mixed the cheese and chicken instead of sprinkling cheese on and this caused the cheese to ooze out the ends  and made them stick to the pan so I won't be doing that again. Will just keep cheese towards the middle so it melts towards the ends but not out.

These shouldnt be called Flautas. Flautas are made with flour tortillas. Taquitos are made with corn tortillas. I wanted Flautas so I used flour tortillas instead of corn and fried the flour tortillas in hot oil for 4 sec per side. Then followed recipe as writen except I added red enchilada sauce to each flauta(poured about 2 tbs sauce over chicken mixture on each flauta and then topped w/ cheese and then rolled them up and then baked). Recipe as writen is only a 3 star recipe. Recipe my way is 5 stars (absolutely delicious). sorry arlene):

These were very good and easy to make.  I boiled the chicken and shredded it the night before which made prep. the next day even quicker.  I followed the recipe as stated.  It was very good, just maybe could use a little more cheese, which I will add next time.

These took a little more work and time but turned out terrificly! It's only my husband and I so I don't know what I was thinking making the full recipe, but I'm glad I did. They were all gone in 3 days!!!
Since we like hot stuff, I added 3 diced jalepenos, one onion and taco seasoning. This was truly delicious!

These were so good!!! However....I left out the picante and cumin. I sauteed the chicken with garlic, salt and pepper in a wok. I then diced it up, put it in the corn tortillas with cheese, rolled and baked. These were so darn good! I think they were more authentic without the salsa added - I love Mexican food and have never had them with salsa actually in them. I served salsa, queso and sour cream for dipping. Everyone raved. I'm not sure how I would have rated these with the salsa in them, but they were certainly great without and the salsa served on the side. I also left them in the oven after the 25 minutes with the door ajar just to get them a little more crisped up. YUM!

These turned out very good!  I love the simple recipe and so few ingredients.  I followed the recipe as written but did use more oil as some others suggested.  The change I made was that I used half the recipe with chicken and half with roast beef.  I loved the roast beef while my family likes the chicken better.  I didn't grease the cookie sheet because there was already enough from warming the tortillas. No problem with splitting after cooking as one reviewer said.  I think because I placed them so that they touched and supported the next one.  Served them with salsa and sour cream.  My 3 teenage boys and husband really liked them! I will make these again and again.  Thanks!

This turned out good for my family. The contents ended up a little dry, I added lots of salsa, cheese and sour cream to the served dish but it may have drowned out some of the flavor of the dish. I did like the ease and the amount it made though. Very nice

My husband loved these, and I've now made them twice in atwo weeks. I used flour tortillas, and also used more cumin, since he likes that flavor. I did have to replenish the oil in the pan used to warm the tortillas, otherwise followed the recipe and it was very successful. I am a vegetarian, so used a black bean mixture in a few, and we both dipped in guacamole to eat. Yum!

I made this as taquitos and flautas.  I prefer them with flour tortillas.  I took them to a party and got rave reviews.  I added bell pepper, onions and hot sauce.  Thanks for a good recipe!

These were wonderful, just what we were looking for, the only change I made was to use my husband's homemade salsa instead of the picante sauce.  Served with spanish rice and extra condiments, guacamole, sour cream and more salsa.  GREAT

Tasted like typical mexican food, everyone enjoyed. Simple and quick enough to make... easy enough where me (14 years old) can make it without problems. Adding a cream sauce over top would have been better... bit dry.

We really liked the taste of these Flautas and since it uses a jar of picante, I could choose the amount of 'heat'.  My husband doesn't cook, but with this recipe he was able to get in the kitchen with me and help prepare the meal.  We were one mean assembly team!  Would have been a challenge by myself.  We served with sour cream, some additional picante sauce, and cucumber/tomato salad.

This is such a yummy mexican treat!  I quartered the recipe and made 10 flautas for my husband and I and it was still too much to eat.  I figured a serving size should be about 3 flautas.  This will be a fun recipe to use when we have company over!  Thanks!

These took FOREVER to put together and were NOT worth it in my opintion. The flavor was lacking BIG TIME and they are a little dry. I don't know how you fry 36 corn tortillas in 1 TBSP of oil because the first few I put in there soaked all the oil up. I had to keep adding more. Anyway, I made half of these w/out the picante sauce thinking my kids would eat them, but they won't touch them. I have a ton of these still sitting in my fridge that will go to waste.

Very simple recipe. I only had ground turkey on hand so I just scrambled it up and added the rest of the ingredients just as the recipe states. Since there are so many reviews and impossible to read them all, I apologize if this suggestion for preparing the tortillas is a duplicate. I used to soften corn totillas by cooking them in oil for a few seconds for other Mexican dishes, but it always seemed so unhealthy and handling the tortillas after being in hot oil was excruciating. Finally a coworker told me to place a small cup of water in the back of the microwave oven, then place about 5-6 tortillas on a plate between wet paper towels and microwave for about 40 seconds. Careful, they will be hot from the steam but at least not greasy. They come out nice and steamed to perfection and can be used to make so many different Mexican dishes where the tortillas need to be rolled like in enchiladas or bent like soft taco shells for a recipe like fish tacos. So the pan of oil is one reason I gave it 4 stars. I also ended up pouring some tomato sauce mixed with salsa over the top with a little of the leftover cheese because my husband thought they looked dry before even tasting them. The family loved them. I'd say this recipe will be a keeper when in the mood for a quick mexican dish.

I want to give 5 stars but since I made a change I really can't.  But they were soooooo good.  Couldn't get enough of them!  I added a little spoonful of sour cream to the mixture as others said it can be a little dry.  I also used a Mexican cheese blend, a little salt and a couple shakes of garlic salt to the mixture.  I found some tortillas that were a corn/flour blend and I don't think they needed the oil to soften..they ended up being very oily, so I will try cutting that out.  Served with fresh guacamole and salsa.  Flavor was amazing!!!

This was good and simple to make. I used this as a base, therefore the only reason I didn't use five stars. I compiled my flautas into suggestions of others.

I used canned chicken due to time constraints, then added chili powder, green chilis, garlic powder. 

My only mistake was in originally frying the corn tortilla's, but once I got the hang of it there was a system in place. Now, I'm munching on my yummy chicken flautas. Thank you for sharing!

Is was a good recipe but needed more. I slow cooked the chicken with stock, cumin, and chili powder. I agree you need more oil than the recipe says. It also needed longer in the oven to be crispy. I used the picante sauce but it needed something creamy too--queso fresco, sour cream, avocado dressing--something because corn tortillas are on the dry side.

These are great! My family (including my 5-year-old) absolutely loved them. I boiled then shredded the chicken with a fork. I added a bit of garlic salt for flavor when I mixed it with the salsa. You will definitely need more oil than indicated. Served them with some guacamole, sour cream, Mexican rice and a green salad. This is a wonderful recipe.

turned out yummy.  I slow cooked the chicken in a crock pot with some taco seasoning so I omitted the cumin from the actual recipe.  i did not use more oil that the recipe called for as I wanted to keep these as healthy as I could and the tortillas still wrapped up nicely however once baked they were more on the chewy side rather than crisp.  not bad but them being crispier would have been better.  I felt like this recipe was intended for them to be deep fried.  will make again but think I will use flour tortilla which I know are not authentic for this recipe but that I think may work better in the oven.

These are delicious! I can't believe I waited this long to finally make them! I used flour tortillas because that's what I usually have on hand. I charred them over the open flame and then filled them. I used a mexican blend cheese.

These were very tasty! However, my chicken mixture only made about 20 flautas and I believe the recipe said it would make 32. I may have made my flautas a little larger though. Also, the flautas are great with guacamole!

This was a big hit with the kids tonight for dinner. They remind me of taquitos. Next time I will do everything up to baking them, then freeze them.
Great for our Taco Tuesday. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these with corn and flour tortillas. I did fry the corn tortillas in more oil for a few seconds to soften them.  I sprayed cooking oil on the flour tortillas.  I used canned chicken breast and added Rotel and some cumin and garlic to the chicken mixture.  I put the chicken in the tortillas and topped with cheese and rolled them up.  I placed them on a cookie sheet  and baked about 20 min.  They were crispy and delicious.  The flour tortilla ones were good but I liked the corn tortilla better.  These were easy to make and I like putting them all on the cookie sheet and baking them all at once instead of frying them in batches.  Next time, I am going to try taco sauce and top with Cheez Wiz and try to broil them.

Use enough oil to sufficiently coat the tortillas, Add less salsa and add a small can of chopped green chilis, 8oz. softened cream cheese, garlic and onion powder, a little cayenne, and about 3-4 T of mix in each tortilla and mmmmm. I guess that's almost different recipe huh?

This was really good but very labor intensive. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot with a little picante sauce, a can of chopped green chilies and a diced onion. That way, when I shredded it, it was already seasoned. I followed the remaining directions, including the 8oz additional picante and the cumin. It was really good but, since I really prefer anything with flour tortillas to corn, I probably won't make these again.

These are really good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because everytime I have made them they crack while baking. Otherwise great!

I got a little lazy with this recipe, using the same ingredients, but tweaking the addition of the ingredients. I did make the tortillas from scratch.We mixed the cheese, cumin, chicken, salsa & wrapped them in the tortillas. I sprinkled cheese on top, then baked. We loved it!

I am sure that alot of people can do fine with the intructions given but my BF is mexican and when I started making these he looked at me like an idiot. So he showed me how they do it: Put the tortillas in the microwave for a minute to soften them. Then put the chicken mixture in there. He said not to put cheese but I did because EVERYTHING is better with cheese! Right? So then you just roll them up like a rug and fry them in the hot oil until browned and crisp. I am still giving this recipe 3 stars because the taste of the chicken mixture was good. BTW - I  used taco seasoning instead of Cumin (I didn't have any). The way I did it was MUCH easier, not so rushed and my picky family loved them.

Easy to make, I used left over turkey meat from Thanksgiving instead of chicken.  I also used salsa, since I've never seen an authentic Mexican "Picante Sauce".  A good friend of mine lived in Mexico for a couple of years, he said they pan fry the chicken, shred it and add salsa.  Of course he also said they fry the Flautas instead of baking them...  I may just try this out next time as well.

We thought this was good, but could have used a bit more kick. Next time I'll have to add a little something extra. They were pretty good though. Turn over in oven after about 20 min. to get some more crispiness on the bottom side.

Very tasty. I followed the advice of another cook and roasted the chicken with some picante sauce, 8 minutes per side.  I then shredded it and tossed it with picante, cumin, and onion. I used pre-shredded taco cheese.  Delicious.

I made this the other night and it was really good. my whole family liked it.  I had made pork carnitas and made these with the left overs.  I did mine a little different..I heated my corn tortillas in a non stick pan with no oil until hot and soft.  I just put the carnita meat and some cheesed and rolled.  Once rolled I brushed olive oil on each one and placed on cookies sheet sprayed with Pam and baked.  They were really good and crunchy...NOT greasy or bad for you.  I will for sure make this again

Rather better then I was expecting, was only able to do half a batch. They didn't ever crisp in the oven so ended up with more like enchaladas then flautas but was still very good. My son had 5 and thats saying something seeing as he is 3 years old and very picky. Was kinda hard to do the totillas in oil I see why its stated should have help with it. If you make the full recipe make sure you have prob about double the cheese or else you won't have enough.

These are made very much like enchiladas but the lack of sauce on top made them bake to a delicious crunchiness. I'll make these again but with a bit more cumin.

For those who are health conscious (and who shouldn't be) instead of dipping in oil place tortillas on damp paper tpwel, place in micro on high for 10 sec's. For a softer tortilla top, LIGHTLY brush with canola (a healthier oil) and proceed as directed in recipe

This recipe is definitely a good base to start for flautas and a great way to use up left over chicken.  I did make some alterations to it though due to not having picante sauce or cumin at the time.  I happened to have fresh homamde salsa on hand and used chipotle taco seasoning.  Since I was using  left over chicken, it was thigh meat instead of breast meat.  They were wonderful!!!  The meat was very tender and had a great taste.  I will be making these again!

It may be a regional difference, but I live in South Texas where Tex-Mex originated, and I have eaten flautas here and in Mexico.  No cheese is used.  And in addition to the sour cream, guacamole is served.  It is nice to dip the flauta in sour cream, then in guacamole each time one takes a bit.  At least you didn't call for flour tortillas as do so many who post Mexican food recipes at the site.  Flour tortillas are anathema to "cocina autentica."

Enjoyed them. You will need more oil though. I added some ground pepper and chili powder to mixture for a bit of spice and they turned out great :)

I was looking for something different when I came across this recipe. Such simple ingredients, I thought I'd give it a try. Wow!! These were wonderful! My husband took a couple for lunch the next day and said it's the best lunch he's ever had a work! Thanks for such a great recipe!

These were really good, I baked the chicken with salsa spread on top, as another reviewer had recommended, YUM! Oh and added extra cheese on top. My 1yr old and 3yr old also loved them. Thanks!

Thank you for showing me the technique of making these flautas.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and white chiahuaha cheese.  I think green tomatillo sauce would have been a great variation.

This is a good way to cut some of the fat from traditional flautas, which are deep fried. They still are just as delicious!

These are so good!!  Boiled chicken, then fine diced and mixed with salsa and cheese before filling tortillas.  Also doubled the amount of salsa and left out cumin and it had plenty of flavor!  Topped with sour cream and they are heavenly!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I agree with the another reviewer to broil the chicken in sauce with some taco seasoning before shredding. My husband started this before I got home and just boiled and shredded the chicken breasts so they were a bit plain. Newman's own mild salsa helped cope with that. I also recommend sprinkling the rolled tortilla's with so onion salt. All 3 of my kids loved these. I cut the recipe in half for 5 people and served with yellow rice, mexican corn and re-fried beans. Update: used the filling from Angela's Awesome Enchiladas and this recipe will rock!

YUMMALICIOUS!!!! These are great and super easy to make. I made a few changes to mine, I seasoned the chicken (thighs) with a little taco seasoning and I broiled them in enchilada sauce. I doubled the salsa as well... With some spanish rice and black beans you have a great meal!!!!

Excellent base recipe. I modified the chicken by making it in the crock pot in chicken taco soup (got the recipe from here, it's the best) which gave the chicken some nice flavor. We also brushed the tortillas with olive oil rather than soaking them with oil in a frying pan. I'll be serving these at a party, and I'm sure my friends will scarf them up!

I used canned chicken and taco seasoning instead of spices. Goes great with brown rice and huevos rancheros! This is a great method for getting the tortillas perfectly crispy. Love it!

This recipe was a hit! I used monterey jack cheese and manchego mexican cheese. Cheddar just didnt sound good. I also only used the chicken, mild salsa and some chili lime seasoniong for the mix. They were gone in minutes. Thanks for the post! It was a great start!

I think, as written, this would have been pretty bland, so I spiced it up a bit. First, I boiled the chicken breasts in water seasoned with Adobo, garlic, and Chipotle powders. I added a finely-diced jalapeno to the chicken mixture, and I used a combination of queso fresco and a Mexican four cheese blend. I found the tortillas difficult to roll up - they tended to crack really easily. This turned out ok, but it was rather a lot of work.

I reduced the number of servings to 8 and added 2 oz. of sour cream to increase the moisture content.  I also used about 6 oz. of salsa.  I topped them with three stripes of taco sauce and another 1/2 c. of each cheese before baking.  They were really yummy!

this recipe is great. I have cooked it several times. after I boil the chicken and shred it I mix togather in a bowl some sour cream, cheese, hot sauce, and spices. I add the chicken and mix it all togather and then roll into the corn tortialls. you need a lot more oil then the recipe calls for as others have noted.

This is a great base recipe for any type of flauta. You could easily switch out the chicken for pork, beef or even potato. Made these for a dinner party with friends and there were absolutely no leftovers! Serve with salsa, sour cream, guacamole; just about any Mexican dip would be great!

I rarely use corn tortillas, so I was afraid my kids wouldn't like these..but even my daughter who doesn't like flour ones loved this!  I thought the chicken mix could have used a little salt, but other than that we all loved it.  It wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be, and didn't take very long.  For recipes that call for cooked chicken, I use bone-in breasts that have been boiled on the stove in chicken stock..then shred it.  Serve with rice and beans, lettuce, salsa and quacamole, and you'll feel like you're dining at your favorite Mexican Ristorante!

These were really good. I remember thinking, as I was shredding the chicken breasts, 'these BETTER be good!' The prep is a bit tedious, not bad, but not a  throw together dinner, either. I did start to put this together early in the day, like 2pm. I did all of the prep, put these together and put them on the cookie sheet, put them in the fridge until supper time. These were great, my 9 year old daughter LOVES Mexican food and she raved about them. I broiled my chicken breasts with the picante sauce on them for about 8 min. per side, they were super juicy. I will make this again, just not too often, it is a bit of a production. They do taste very much like something you would order at a restaurant.

These were absolutely wonderful. The flavours mix well together, though I did add a little sweet and spicy sauce that I had around the house, and the crunch was terrific. They were very filling, and everyone loved them. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.

I made these yesterday for my husband's "requested" birthday dinner. He wanted me to make something similar to what we have at a local mexican restaurant. These were delicious! However, I did make a few modifications. I cooked the chicken with the picante sauce (a whole bottle) in my crock pot on low all day. I made these up and fried them (because we like them crispy) in 3/4 inch of veg. oil. Then I made a cheese sauce (consisting of 3/4 lb.cubed american cheese, and 1 jalapeno finely diced and 1/2 cup of milk, melted together until smooth). I poured the cheese sauce over the flautas after they were fried. IT was SO GOOD. Just like our local restaurant!!

This recipe turned out great! Tweaked it a little only because it's what I had on hand. I had some chicken breasts marinating in a garlic/lime/olive oil/cumin mix, so I threw them on the BBQ. I mixed up the chopped chicken, 1 can of black beans, 12 ounces of fresh pico de gallo, the cumin, some red chili powder and the shredded cheese and filled flour tortillas then baked as directed. Followed some other reviewers advice, skipped the oil dipping part and sprayed the tortillas with canola oil. I had some extra filling left over, so I scooped it up with tortilla chips. SO GOOD!!

These are so easy to make! I cooked my chicken in the crock pot and it was so easy to shred. I did think it could use a little extra kick, but my husband doesn't like things too spicy and he thought they were perfect.

WOW! I've never been very good at making Mexican food but this recipe is incredibly easy and delicious. The tortillas come out perfectly crunchy--this really tastes like it came straight out of the kitchen of an authentic mexican restaurant. Even my friend from Panama loved this

I couldn't get a handle on these and they turned into fried burrito-chiladas.

YUM!  I used chicken thighs because we prefer the flavor and moistness they add compared to chicken breast.  To cook the thighs I used 1 onion and 1 tomato(quartered), 4 cloves of garlic crushed, covered the thighs with water and then added about 1/4 cup of knorr chicken broth powder and then simmered 2 hours until the chicken fell apart.  I also made my salsa from scratch just because I prefer the flavor over jarred salsa.  They came out delicious and are even great reheated.  My husband devoured them!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband and I really liked these.  I didn't make nearly as many as called for and used more filling for a heartier flauta.  I also used flour tortillias instead of corn.  We really enjoyed these dipped in a little sour cream!  Will definitely make again.

This was easier to make than taquitos, although very similar when cooked. I will probably try this again with flour tortillas. Very flavorful, but I agree with some of the other reviews, a bit dry. My hubby liked them. Also, my daughter is a vegetarian, and I made her some with veggie "chicken strips". She loved it!

This was a good idea. I mixed refried beans with the chicken, cheese and picante sauce to make the filling heartier for my husband's taste.  I also used a cookie sheet to bake the flautas on and they did come out nice and crispy.

I'm very stingy with my stars, but my husband and I both thought these were really good!  Honestly, the biggest reason I didn't rate it higher is because mine did not turn out crispy like a flauta, they were more like enchiladas.  And I made them twice - trying to roll tighter with the second batch.  Still good and SUPER easy, but just not what we expected as flautas.  I served mine with homemade guacamole on top and that added great color and an added zest of flavor!  We will definitely make it again because it's a fast, easy meal for weeknights!

Was okay.. try simmering the chicken in broth with the spices.. then slightly thickening some of the sauce mixed with the shredded chicken for moisture.  I deep fried in Canola oil.. no cheese.. with sour cream and guacamole on the side.

This was good - I always like Mexican food - but they just didn't taste like flautas.  They were in between a taco and an enchilada.  You just can't get that crispy quality without deep-frying, which I don't do at home!

This is definitely an A+ recipe. My entire family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. After a series of bad luck I was excited at how well this recipe turned out. It was easy to prepare and had a wonderful flavor. I took another reviewers suggestion and broiled the chicken breasts in the oven first. I also used more oil than the recipe indicated. You won't go wrong with this recipe.

Delicious!! As others say, it takes a lot more oil. I used a food processor to shred the chicken and loved finer texture.

I've made this twice in one week since my husband and I enjoyed it so much!  I made the following changes the second time: I added a little more cumin along with chili powder, paprika, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper.  I also used flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  Instead of softening them up by lightly frying them, I put about a tablespoon of olive oil on a plate and put one side of each tortilla on the plate before filling it and rolling it into the pan.  Once they were all on the pan, I baked them uncovered at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, then flipped them and baked them for an additional 5 minutes until both sides were brown and melted some cheese on top at the end.  Served with guacamole and refried beans - delicious!  I made half the recipe and it made 11 flautas.

My picky kids loved these! they are so easy to make. I did have help from the hubs frying the tortillas while I was stuffing them. So use plenty of oil because they soak it up. I used a 16 oz jar of picante sauce. I sprinkled the monterey  jack cheese inside the flautas. Then sprinkled the white Mexican cheese over them. I sprinkled cilantro on top too. They crisped up nicely! And only took 15 minutes.  My kids are begging me to make them again!

I make these frequently, and use canned chicken when I'm in a time crunch. Making extras means I can freeze some. Also a really popular option when I take food to a family with littles - plus a full batch means I can make a meal for their family and mine all at once!

Loved these! I boiled 4 chicken breasts for about 20 to 25 minutes and then shredded them with a knife and fork. I placed the cut up chicken pieces in a large bowl and seasoned them with the ground cumin, Goya Adobo, and the picante sauce. I then placed the chicken mixture in each tortilla and the cheese on top and rolled them tightly. These were fabulous and all my roommates devoured them. The prep time was a little long so on a busy night, I'll probably use pre-cooked chicken but these were easy and fun to make.

These were exactly how I remember my mother making them. Except hers were drier. The picante sauce solved that problem. I used green taco sauce.

You can also microwave the corn tortillas to make them pliable,  then stuff them with the chicken mixture, then roll them into a flaunts and then fry them in oil. Then put them in a casserole dish and in the oven.

This came out so good! I didn't have picante sauce so I used fresh salsa with red onions and tomatoes and green onions. I'm feeding it to a kid so I don't want to make it too spicy. The flavor of the chicken is great! Will make this again!

This sounds more like taquitos since the only Flautas I have had was a flour base shell.

Great recipe, perfect way to use barbeque grilled chicken cooked the night before, and yes, soften the tortillas in plenty of oil and turn once while baking, this allows for even crispiness. Happy Cinco de Mayo !

I rated this 4 stars as written because we like a little more cumin and salsa (instead of picante sauce) when we make this. Also, for an even faster meal, I roll the tortilla, secure with a toothpick, lightly brush either side with olive oil and fry both sides. I skip the oven entirely. It isn't quite as crispy this way but it is a little healthier and faster!

These were really good. I like to make these when I have left over shredded chicken or shredded beef. I put a little salsa and maybe some cream cheese and ta da. You should be sure to have a hardy side dish though because there isn't much stuffing in each one. Really they would make a great appetizer

I've made this a few times now and some batches are better than others. I try to keep a extra salsa jar on hand because sometimes the mix can turn out a little dry. Freezes well for a quick meal during the week.

EXCELLENT appetizers!  Can be prepared night before, which makes them all the better cause all of the seasoning has blended nicely.  I did try frying the shells first, but my shells were soft enough, didn't need it.  So, majority of mine were simply assembled, baked and eaten!!

My family and I loved this, my only recommendations are heat the oven to 400 deg it makes them a lot crispier. Then just like everyone else, more oil.

Yum! I more oil than the recipe calls  for. I used white mexican cheeses, not monterey/cheddar. I do wish I hadn't put the cheese on top because it just dried out. Very crispy and delicious!

So good! We really liked this one....even though they didnt look so "pretty" after baking (the shells kind of cracked open)...the flavors were great.  I cooked my chix breast in the crockpot on high for about 3 to 4 hours earlier in the day seasoned with cumin, oregano and garlic powder...I also added about 1/4c. of smooth taco sauce.  The chicken was so easy to shred after cooking in the crockpot.  I used salsa instead of the picante sauce as I could find none in my store....dont think I have ever seen it actually. Anyway....they were crispy, cheesey, yummy flavored chicken flautas that we added more salsa and sour cream to at the end. Served with black beans and rice.  My 11 yr old and 3 yr old scarfed it up. Thanks!

Super easy to make and wonderful!!  I used a whole rotissare chicken instead of just breasts.  Used medium picante and added just a couple shakes of red pepper flakes because the picante just wasnt quite hot enough for our taste.  Otherwise, made as written and loved it.  Had company over for dinner and they really enjoyed too!! Will make again for sure!

Really good and easy to freeze. I added green onion to the chicken mixture and used nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese. Combined that all together and stuffed in the tortillas. Easy to freeze!

I tried these the other night without any modifications and they were not only easy, but they were delicious. The only change I might make next time is to use fewer tortillas and put more filling in each but other than that it was a winner in my household and I will definitely use it again.

This dish was a huge hit with the family. If your concerned about the oil try substituting the mix in a flour tortilla and bake. Serves well with Spanish rice.

ADD black beans, green onions to your chicken - fry corn tortillas in 1/2 inch oil, then fill and wrap and bake.  top with parmesan and shredded colby jack cheese b4 put in over ---- serve with sour cream and guacamole --- we used leftover chicken from the night before and this made a cookie sheet full  -- very good

Great recipe it does make things go more smoothly if you have someone helping you. I made these with a friend and she did the tortillas in oil and i stuffed them with the chicken mixture. They came out great and we hardly had any leftovers. I will definitly be making these again

These turned out great. Everyone loved them and I will make them again and again. I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with some cumin, chili powder and some salsa and it was perfect. I am going to experiment with beef next time just to see how they turn out.

Very good. I will be making this again.  I will try a different cheese next time and spicier salsa.  I made my own salsa for this with finely diced onion and jalapeno and canned diced tomatoes, salt and cilantro. I served it with rice and beans so all the mild flavors could definitely take more of the spicy peppers.  I might try using pepper jack cheese as well as more jalapenos in the sauce.  Thanks Arlene. Very good recipe.

These were really good.  We used what I think was generic Cheez Whiz (the jar said cheddar cheese on it) and actually my husband used the whole 16oz can by accident.  We also chopped up a whole jalepeno and mixed it in with the cheese mixture. I didn't even bother measuring the oil after reading the other reviews. We had enough extra cheese to coat the top of the flautas and they were really good.

very good!  Loved it the second time around.  I did make my own dipping sauce which just add to its greatness.  Sauce was simply half a jar of jalapeno jelly and 3-4 tbs. honey warmed up in a sauce pan.  What a kepper!

These turned out to be amazing!  I put jalepenos in the chicken mixture and used more picante than called for.  I also bought some Queso Fresco (the kind that is often used in quesadillas) and used that instead of Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. My husband only orders flautas at Mexican restaurants and I think he preferred these!  Served with beans, guacamole, and sour cream.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I added diced jalepenos as recommeded by others. I used a package of shredded 4 cheese mexican cheese. I also had to use 1 tablespoon of oil for every two tortillas.

Absolutely delish and the family LOVED!  I only used three chicken breasts and I boiled and shredded them.  I also used white corn tortillas and probably had to use a tablespoon of vegetable oil every fifth tortilla that I softened.  My daughter who does not care for chicken ate three of them!  Thank you for sharing!

The flavor was great!  I used salsa instead of picante sauce and also added sliced black olives.  Do not follow the advice to just put tortillas in the microwave.  They need some kind of liquid to soften - mine cracked open in the oven.  Delicious flavor though!

Very good. I eyeballed everything and just added picante sauce, mexican blend of cheese to chicken pieces. Put in whole wheat wraps and brushed with olive oil. Put in oven at 425 and we wolfed them down.

I combined this recipe with the slow cooker carnitas recipe on this website. first i roasted a pork shoulder in a slow cooker for about 8 hour, following the seasoning suggested in the slow cooker carnitas recipe. after about 8 hours as i pulled it out it was falling apart and smelled delicious. i easily pulled it apart and put it on a baking sheet and cooked it at 400 for 10 minutes. after i pulled it out i followed this recipe, and they came out amazing! I only had cheddar cheese and it worked just fine. I served these with a side of sour cream and every was very happy! however i made so many, i had to freeze half of them! but it will be a quick easy meal another night!

Easy and Perfect just the way it is.  It will be as bland or spicy as the picante sauce you use and the freshness of your cumin.  I grind it as needed. If you want to drop the cheddar and go with white cheese, consider one of the Mexican melting cheeses or cheese sauces.  Very simple.  If you warm the tortillas and/or use extra thin ones, they are more pliable and the amount of oil listed is plenty.

Pretty tasty.  I lessened the number of tortillas by adding more of the chicken mixture to each.  That way I didn't feel like I was eating ten tortillas. Next time I may throw some enchilada sauce on top.  Yum-O.

Excellent! The whole family loved these. We also used some ground chuck and made beef flautas, using the same seasoning. They were time consuming to make, but well worth the time and effort. We served them with salsa verde and sour cream.

I altered this quite a bit. I cut the chicken breast into smaller pieces and then fried them in a little oil with cumin and lemon-pepper seasoning. I fried the tortillas like this recipe suggested. I added homemade salsa  and mexican blend cheese. Yummy with sour cream and more salsa. Easy to make too!

These are so yummy! Used rotisserie chicken, garlic salsa instead of picante, shredded mexican cheese blend, but made them just as the recipe says, and so good! Would five stars if I didn't change things slightly. Quick too! Serve with homemade guacamole and I've always got a hit in my house :)

basic purist recipe, the one i'd recommend.  cumin is absolutely key for flavor.  i do without cheese, and rather top with shredded cabbage, tomato, guacamole, and a mexican liquidy cheese whose name i forget...sourcream  is a fine substitute.

I used flour tortillas and added black beans to the flautas. They were delicious! Baked for 25 minutes...might take longer if they are flour vs. corn? I didn't fry them either, I just sprayed them with pam and put them in the oven. Fantastic :)

You DON'T need a lot of oil.  I lightly sprayed each tortilla (both sides) with some oil spray (I used grapeseed oil since it is healthier), and cooked it over medium high heat in a small skillet.  It worked great because each tortilla cooked perfectly in the amount of time it takes to assemble a fluata and spray a new tortilla, so it was like an assembly line.  Tasted great too.  Next time I might add a little more salsa, but that is probably because I had larger chicken breasts.  I think I made mine bigger because I only made about 29 instead of 36.  Also, I think the brand of tortilla you buy might make a difference.  The brand that I have found (in my area) that is thinnest and does the best is Pepitos.

These flautas turned out pretty good... a healthier approach to frying them.  I did a cumin and peppers for a kick and served them with spanish rice.

Pretty Good. I wanted them crunchier so I left in the oven a little longer.

The flavor was good, but the consistency of the flauta "shell" was not what I'm used to.  I suppose that is because they are baked?

This is a great recipe.  I use Pam and spray both sides of the tortillas (about 8 at a time) and put them in the microwave for about a minute, then flip the stack and 30 or 45 more seconds.  Works great!

Excellent recipe! I cooked the chicken in sazon seasoning to give it a little more flavor (other than that i followed the directions to the T) and it tasted sooo good. A+!

Slightly disappointed, as I expected more from such a highly rated recipe. Filling slightly dry and added chipolte chilies in adobe sauce to spice up and more cumin. Tortillas  did soak up a lot of oil, but not too bad. Rolling them up was a fun group effort. However, in the oven, tortillas became tough. Had to pour salsa over top to soften up. Probably will turn this into a enchilada recipe.

This was an easy recipe, but they were very bland.  Others were right that you do need much more oil to soften the tortillas.  If I make this again I will definitely use more spices on the chicken and possibly even grill the chicken to get more flavor.

These were very easy to make, but did not taste like any chicken flautas I've ever had in a restaurant. I did use more oil for softening the tortillas, but that was the only variation I tried. 

I think I will forego that step and deep fry them after assembly. I also will add fresh avocado and sour cream like the authentic mexican restaurant does to give it the final touches we enjoy.

Thanks for the good start!

I'm not usually a fan of breast meat, but this recipe really keeps the chicken nice and moist.  We seared the chicken with about 2 TBSP butter, which probably helped a bit!

Pretty good.  I followed recipe and added some garlic and onion powder to chicken mixture.  I also added cayenne pepper to the adult ones for a little more spice.  I didn't fry tortillas because we have a local tortilla shop and get fresh ones so they were very pliable and didn't tear when rolling up.  My 9 year old even helped.  Easy and quick. Thanks, will make again!

This wasn't family favorite for us. Everyone ate them at dinner, but I'm sure the leftovers won't be touched. I thought they were too dry. Maybe I didn't put enough cheese in or something. I won't be making these again.  Next time I'll try something with sauce, like enchiladas.

Big hit at my house! I made them twice and will be making again. I made these with wheat flour tortillas and baked them as others suggested. I may try the corn tortillas, but I usually have wheat (flour) tortillas on hand. The second time I made them with leftover rotisserie chicken...Good use for the leftovers! P.S. I don't think they need to be baked for the full cooking time.

Really great recipe! I will make again. As other reviewers said, it takes much more than 1 Tbsp of oil to soften up those tortillas. I used olive oil, but I highly suggest using an oil with a higher smoke point, such as canola or peanut. Used a mixture of Monterey-Jack, cheddar, & mozzarella cheeses and it was delicious. Served with Mexican rice & refried beans.

YUMMY! We ate them up. They were so good my husband and I both had leftovers for lunch today. The only thing I did different was that I needed more oil to soften the tortillas. I served them with Mexican Rice III another great recipe on Allrecipes, sour cream and home made quacamole. Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I had been getting this dish at our favorite Mexican restaurant but now that I can make them at home we are both thrilled, especially me because I'm not the greatest cook. They taste so yummy!

I thought it was amazing. It tasted like a burrito though. I added corn, salsa, and sour cream to the inside mixture. Then I put some sour cream and guacamole on top and it was amazing. Really filling too.

These were good, just a little difficult to make.  I think I'd try them again with a few modifications.

I made these for my dad and brothers a while ago, but simply forgot to review them. They were eaten, but nobody was too keen on them.

Absolutely wonderful!  Quite a lot of work, but well worth the effort.  I even froze half the batch for later.  Wonderful with fresh guacamole!

Very good flauta recipe.  Much easier than my normal recipe.  I serve these with chipotle sauce (sour cream, mayo and chipotle in adobo) and jalapeno jelly.  Yummy!

This is good with ground turkey, too, as well as with leftover pulled turkey breast from Thanksgiving. Serve with sour cream.

I made these for dinner and my children loved them. I make alot of mexican foods but never tried flautas. My husband also really enjoyed them. What i did was cut, season ,and fried the chicken in butter. I than shredded the chicken and added Herdez green salsa and the cumin. I did the rest as said but used cheddar cheese cuz its all i had. I served with sour cream. WE REALLY ENJOYED EVERY BITE!!!!!!!!

My boyfriend loved these almost as much as i did. He also had to help me roll them... i get a little clumsy! I added a little extra cheese and served them with 1 part sour cream mixed with 1 part ortega taco sauce. They were great.

Last night I started to make this recipe and improvised, ending up with something completely different. It could no longer even be called a faluta, but I loved it!  Thanks for posting the faluta recipe!  I intend to make it soon, "as written".  I can "read" the recipe and know that I will like it.
