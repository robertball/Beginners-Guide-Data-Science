Good stuff! I did not use cranberry juice, I used organic apple juice and I used a half-teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I served this over pumpkin-spiced french toast. The kids loved this! I would like to try this with a quarter cup plus two tablespoons buttermilk or evaporated milk and see if I don't get a cream-type of syrup.

We didn't like this and actually ended up tossing it. I think it was the cranberry juice cocktail, which made it quite tangy when we were hoping for subtle sweetness and spice. I would love to try it again with apple juice though, I think that would make it much better.

Usually I just have butter on my pancakes. I'm not a big syrup fan but I'm a huge pumpkin fan so I had to try this with my pumpkin pancakes. I used 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and allspice. Yes, it was more spice than called for but that's how I like it. I will make this again especially when company comes for the hoildays.

I took another reviewer's advice and omitted the cranberry juice and just added some more maple syrup and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Great recipe!

Yummers! I wouldn't really call this a syrup but it is rockin' on pumpkin pancakes. I had to change it based on what I had on hand. I didn't have maple syrup so I used Butter Pecan, no cranberry juice so I used spiced apple cider. Also added about a tsp of vanilla, and about 2T butter. Warmed this up on the stove before serving. So very good! Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe and made as follows:

1/4 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup pumpkin puree
1/4 tsp each cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice
2 tbsps milk
1 tbsp icing sugar
splash of vanilla

I warmed the syrup in the microwave for 30 seconds to make it more pourable, my sons enjoyed it but I don't think it would be something we would have often. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #Pumpkinfest

Delicious :) I made this to top a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving. Substituted cranberry juice for slightly diluted pomegranate juice (some reviews said it was too tart, and that was all I had anyway!), I used apple syrup instead of maple and added more pumpkin purée than the recipe called for. My pumpkin purée was home made and perhaps on the bland side from boiling the pumpkin.

Used this over pumpkin pancakes for Christmas breakfast. It was just ok. I preferred applesauce and yogurt . . .
