Made this for our party last night...huge hit...everyone loved it! Cool gross factor (served it with a small ice cream scoop) but tasted yummy...should have made two of them. Only thing I changed, I put 1 cup of schnapps and 1/2 cup peach flavored vodka for alittle bit more punch.

This was a huge win at my adult halloween party! Creepy and cool. I walked around the party with the brain on a silver platter and served slices to my party-goers. It wasn't sticky or slimy so you could use your fingers. Unlike a lot of jello shots, this actually tasted great.

The finishing result was awesome, the brain was sturdy and looked really good! And it tasted good too, I used peach jello and it tasted like peaches and cream with the evaporated milk. I would like to play around with this recipe and try out new and gory things in the future!

We substituted strawberry jello instead of peach, and used a full pint of peach schnapps.  It was fully gelled in approximately 5 hours, and tasted fantastic!

This recipe is excellent as is, however to make it really realistic I added drops of red and blue color to the main mix until it looked gray. I not only painted it (using a q-tip) with the food color mixture afterward, but also drizzled grenadine on top to look like blood. Served on a cutting board with a small cleaver. Unfortunately it was barely touched, since it looked *too* real. The few people who dared said it was delicious though. I also made a "pig aorta" in a shot glass using the same method - grossed out a lot of folks on social media! (see in photos above) You could use this recipe for all kinds of different molds - I'm thinking severed fingers.

Worked like a charm!  I made a non-alcoholic version of this, substituting water for the alcohol.  We used it for a school haunted house - kids thought this was awesome!  Set up really well and looked gross on the table.

I made this brain for my work Halloween party and it was a big hit! It looked just real enough, wiggled the right amount and tasted great! I used orange Jello and food colored it to the grossest color possible. Simple recipe with a big presentation impact!

Used vodka instead of schnapps.  Only criticism is that it's almost too real looking!

I like big brains and I cannot lie!  This turned out perfectly.  Since it was for an office event, I subbed peach nectar for the schnapps and it had a wonderful peaches and cream flavor.

I will definitely only use this recipe for "brains" in the future. If the situation allows, I will use the alcohol instead of the nectar.

I changed mine up just a bit. I used a cup of peach vodka, instead of the peach schnapps. I also added mostly blue food coloring with a few drops of red to get the grayish look. I did not have a paint brush, so I used a Q-tip. I think it came out pretty good for my first attempt.

This was definitely the hit for our adult party!  I substituted the peach schnapps with fireball whiskey for a cinnamon taste and I substituted the peach jello with cherry jello. The perfect spooky treat at your next Halloween party, “Brain on fire!”

I made several changes:  1) used whipped cream vodka in place of schnapps, 2) used a 5 oz can of evap. milk, juice from a small container of peach chunks, and topped up to 1 1/2 cups with half and half, and 3) added the peach chunks to the gelatin.  
I had so much fun making this that I wouldn't really care if it didn't taste that good, but it does!  A LOT of sugar, but that goes with the holiday!

Big hit but makes a LOT of jello shooter. Worth making even though it wasn't finished. Make sure you have lots of plastic shooter glasses to spoon it into. I tinted the peach jello with a couple drops of blue food colouring to tone the peach colour down. Don't use too much blue in the tint mix when painting the finishing touches on.
