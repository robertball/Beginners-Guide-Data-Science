This was my first from-scratch cake ever and boy was it a huge success!! My husband's first comment was that it was the best cake he'd ever eaten! It was gobbled up so quickly and everyone was ooo-ing and aah-ing the entire time. I followed the recipe exactly except I topped the cake with Heath toffee bits instead of peanuts. I also put heath bits in between two of the 4 layers. The cake was very moist and the peanut butter icing just went perfectly with it. It was absolutely divine!!!

i'm giving this 5 stars because it's the best homemade cake i have made. it's very very moist.the changes i made was i used cake flour instead of all purpose used coffee instead of water and unsweetened cocoa powder instead of unsweetened chocolate because that's what i had on hand. as far as the frosting i halfed the recipe but doubled the peanut butter because i like the strong peanut butter flavor. i will make this recipe again.

I made this for a friend/co-worker's birthday; it was very good, and I do quite a bit of baking. The cake was very moist and flavourful. I don't have any 9" pans so I used three 8" pans instead and didn't cut the cakes in half (so mine was only a 3-layer cake). I just cooked the cakes for a bit less time. The only thing I would do differently is add less milk to the icing; I think 1/4 cup is too much and I had to add a whole bunch of extra confectioner's sugar to compensate. So the icing was really, really sweet. I would start off with less milk and see if you need more as you mix the icing. I also had a lot of extra icing (probably more than a cup) but that is likely due to the extra sugar I had to add plus one less layer to my cake. Some people didn't like the peanuts and others suggested adding peanuts between the layers....I guess you can't win in that department!! Very yummy cake; lots of compliments!!

I made this cake for some co-workers and they just loved it. You can't go wrong with this cake and the frosting is to die for. I added a chocolate glaze over the peanut butter frosting what more could you ask for. Thanks for the great recipe Iola.

I made this a bithday cake for someone who liked reeses cups. And everybody loved it, I did not put the peanuts on because all I could smell was the peanut butter. And they all said it was decadent. Highly recommended

Absolutely addictive!  I love this recipe, in the cake I replaced 1/4c of flour with cocoa and like some others suggested I used cold coffee instead of water.  For the frosting I only used about 1t of milk and 2c of powdered sugar, and I have to say I liked it so much I left some in the bowl and just ate it with a spoon!  I also put chocolate ganache over the frosting - very decadent.

This was excellent.  The only thing I changed is used part coffee and part water.  Instead of peanuts I used chopped up peanut butter cups.  It wasn't to chocolatly which was a nice change.  I made this for Easter and it was gone in minutes.  Defintely a keeper!

I gave this 4 stars only because I had to cut the sugar down to 3 cups. I learnt the hard way and wasted a whole batch ... but in the end it was a HUGE hit!

Yummy!  The icing was fantastic!  I could eat if by itself.  The cake was light and moist.  A very nice combination.

I made this today for my husband's birthday party. He and all our guests loved the cake! I replaced the water with strong brewed coffee, giving the cake an even richer flavor. I made a two layer cake, rather than a 4 layer. I didn't top with peanuts...due to personal taste. This is the perfect cake for those chocolate and peanut butter lovers! I'll definitely be making this cake again. Thanks for sharing!

This cake is fabulous... I have made it a few times and have found it works best for me to double the chocolate, subtract a tablespoon of butter, cut sugar down to 1 1/2 cups... and use cold strong coffee in place of water. :D 
The frosting is heavenly, but I tend to use half butter and half shortening, and a bit less milk. I am raising peanut butter addicts, so I have made the frosting at least twice as many times as the cake. :D Thank you for posting the recipe. :D

Four stars for the cake - it is certainly moist and fluffy although not quite chocolate-y enough for my taste; but five stars for the frosting! I made it for my sis-in-law's birthday. The entire family loved it and there were requests for the recipe.

Changes I made - I cut down the sugar in the cake by 1/4 cup. As for the frosting, I creamed the butter and peanut butter together first and slowly added the icing sugar till I got the sweetness that I wanted. It certainly did not need the amount of sugar stated. I also found that I did not need to add any milk at all - the frosting would have been way too runny.

The cake wasn't that chocolatey as written so I had to add more chocolate. That resulted in an overly filling cake so nobody got to take seconds. The peanut butter icing was pretty good, I used a bit more PB and a bit less margarine. Less sugar and milk as well.

WOW!  I must say that this was one of the easiest cakes to make. I followed the recipe with NO changes and it turned out perfect.  The icing is one of the fluffies I have ever tasted.  Thanks!

Made my own chocolate cupcakes but the peanut butter frosting was amazing.  Amount was enough to cover 24 cupcakes with a decent size swirl.

Very yummy easy to make cake.  Very rich with all the butter but my husband is a huge fan of chocolate & peanut butter desserts, so thank you for your recipe.  Now his mom isn't the only one who can make him a choc/pb cake :)

I really liked this recipe. The only thing that I would like is a cake that tasted more chocolatey. I would try to use a different cake next time I made this but I loved the frosting. I ended up putting more peanut butter than it call for in the cake but very good.

This cake is very tasty and super easy my five year old son enjoyed helping make this cake as well as eating the leftover batter.  One thing I did not add smashed peanuts but added freshly shaved chocolate.

WOW! So good.  Followed the recipe except baked in 9 x 13 inch pan baked 33 minutes. Cut the frosting in 1/2.  Also used extra crunchy PB in the frosting!  Would love to give this 10 stars if I could!

Other than the way my finished product looked, it was delicious!!! I think with a little more practice, my cakes will be prettier.

I made this for my sons birthday.  Everyone loved it.  It was the first time I split cake layers and I was nervous about that.  I googled for some hints on line and it was easy.  I went too light on icing between the layers because I was afraid of running out, but there was plenty.  Next time I will know.  That was my only complaint, but it was my fault. I also used coffee in place of the water.  I topped the cake with chopped up small peanut butter cups.  We will definitely make this cake again.

This cake is AMAZING!! I would give it 5 stars with the adjustments I made but I only gave it 4 because it would've been way too sweet w/o the adjustments.  I used an extra 1/2 oz of the bakers chocolate and left out half of the water because it was getting soupy.  For the frosting I used chunky peanut butter and didn't add peanuts and left the milk out or it would've been way too watery.  I also only used 1 1/2 c. confectioners sugar and it was plenty sweet.  With the adjustments it was a DELICIOUS, moist, flavorful cake and I will definitely make it again, thank you for the awesome recipe! :)

YUMMY DELICIOUS.  I have found my from-scratch chocolate cake recipe!  Most other recipes I tried were too dry.  This is wonderful & moist & flavorful.  My hubby is from PA, so chocolate cake w/ PB frosting is a standard for him.  He said this was the best he's ever had!  I followed the instructions EXCEPT I only had 1/2 C of sour cream instead of a full 1 C, so I used 1/2 C of sour cream & 1/2 C of plain non-fat yogurt.  I also used just 2 C of flour & 1/4 C of unsweetened cocoa powder.  I omitted the peanuts because of my hubby's preference for no nuts.  THIS IS A KEEPER RECIPE!

Kind of dry the first day, but much better and more moist by day two.

MMM what a wonderful cake. The cake and icing complimented each other perfectly. I followed the recipe as is and the cake came out moist and chocolaty while the icing was surprisingly not as sweet as it looks, with a peanut butter taste which reminds me of the middle of a Reese's cup somewhat. Yummy! I did opt to leave out the finely chopped nuts as garnish cause I knew I wouldn't enjoy it like that. I also made this into a three layer cake, dividing batter evenly among my pans. I found that I did not need to add any milk to get a spreadable consistency on my frosting as well. Thanks for the recipe, it was delightful.

Great recipe! Mine turned out with a slight coffee flavor, but everyone loved it. Extremely moist and goes great with vanilla ice cream.
