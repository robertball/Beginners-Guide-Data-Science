I am a big fan of truffle fries and have made them many times but this one didn't work for me. I think the problem was in the red potatoes. They started to burn and never would crisp up once the truffle oil was added. I actually made this recipe twice. The first time I wrote it as written and when that didn't work, I tried soaking the potatoes in cold water and rinsing instead of the microwave step but that didn't work either. The one thing I did like was the cilantro instead of the usual parsley.
