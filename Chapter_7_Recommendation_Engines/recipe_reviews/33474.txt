This dip was a big hit. My husband took it to work and THEY DEVOURED IT! It was gone before it got cold. First of all, the recipe says to "spread" the ingredients into the baking dish. VERY IMPORTANT: Mix them well in a bowl first, then spread them into the baking dish. This is not a layered dish. It will not look "presentable" if there are chunks of ingredients all over the place. I used real roasted garlic. It isn't really a big step, and it does make a difference. You won't have difficulty peeling the soft garlic if you pound on the clove with the side of a wide knife. It comes right out. I also followed other suggestions and used a whole package of cream cheese. I used Bertolli alfredo sauce & it doesn't have a metallic flavor like other store bought sauces can have. Next time I make it, I'll keep it warm in my electric crock pot (If it lasts that long).

Edited to add: 
I made little filo dough cups in a mini muffin tin. I filled them with this dip that I heated in the microwave. I topped them with shredded asiago & romano cheese and melted it in the oven for about 4 min. I topped them with chopped tomatoes & they were a real HIT!
For the filo dough cups:
Layer 3 sheets of filo dough with cooking spray between each layer. Cut into, 18 squares. Put each square into mini muffin tins and bake for 5-7 min at 350.

I've been making this recipe for several years, it's great! I use garlic powder (1 tsp) and usually leave out the artichokes and just use spinach. I use a 15 oz jar of alfredo sauce, 2 cups of mozzerella, about 1/2 cup Parmesan, and an entire 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese. I don't layer the ingredients, just stir everything together, pour in a casserole and bake till bubbly. I serve it with slices of hot, crunchy garlic toast. Fantastic!

This is absoultely DELICIOUS.  I serve it with pita triangles.  I've made it about 6 times since I got the recipe a few months ago, and each time my guests all agree that it's better than what you get in the restaurants.  I go ahead and use the whole cream cheese package just to make it easier.  I also mix up all the cheeses to make it easier to put in the pan, and I heat the cream cheese a bit in the microwave to soften and make it easier to mix.  Yummm!!!!

This was absolutely phenomenal!  My guests never left the buffet table.....  I usually use a Garlic Alfredo sauce for extra flavor.  For a little kick, try adding a tsp of hot sauce to the mix prior to baking it.  It's wonderful!

EXCELLENT DIP!!!  I tried an artichoke spinach dip recipe once before and my husband told me that I should never touch an artichoke again :).   I tried this recipe and his eyes literally lit up!  This recipe was so easy to make, that I couldn't believe it.  I used store bought garlic that was already chopped and also added a little extra salt.  (I eliminated the need to bake garlic first and just mixed the garlic in with all the other ingredients).  It truly tasted like an Applebee's dip....or even better.  My entire prep. time was approx. 5 minutes.  The suggested cook time was absolutely perfect.  My husband asked me to make this recipe for the next food day at his job!!!!  This is truly a 5 star recipe.

AWESOME IS AN UNDERSTATMENT!!!!!!!!!!
I have made this many times and after a few modifications Ive found perfect recipe. FRESH GARLIC is a must dont use minced this is what makes it so flavorful the extra time is worth it. I use the entire package of cream cheese and an entire bottle of Alfredo 15 oz. Mix everything very well to get the best blend. Finding the right cooking time was tricky I cook about 15 minutes longer but pull out and check often to find your favorite consistency. I actually like this recipe better the second day its SUPER YUMMY best recipe I have ever gotten online.

I made this for a SuperBowl party.  Due to the other reviews, I used slightly less spinach and artichokes.  Be sure to use Alfredo sauce from the refridgerated section.  I think some people are using the jarred kind which has a different taste and consistancy (at least to me).  It came out wonderful, and went quickly.  No leftovers at all!

This is a great recipe and is very similar to a good one I have in my recipe box.  I made this dip last FRI for the family and we all loved it and felt like we are eating out at home.  The only change I made in the recipe is to skip roasted garlic part and use whole jar 16oz of CLASSICOâ€™s Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and I mixed all the ingredients in a casserole dish before I put it in the oven.  To turn this recipe into a gourmet dish, you can add one pound of small shrimp.   Very good recipe and very easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I kept this in a crock pot for a buffet and added whole milk a few times to maintain texture. No leftovers.

Oh, this was great! I made it for christmas eve appetizers and my husband and I practically ate the whole thing in one sitting.
The only thing I would change is I would not get the marinated artickoes again. They were too salty and I would also chop them up. I didn't care too much for the big chunks of artickokes.
I also took some of the others advice and mixed all the cheeses and the sauce together and used the whole thing of cream chesse. I also added some pepper and garlic to the cheese mixture. Then I put mozzerella on top. For the cheese mixture I used an italian mix of cheese. 
Also, next time I make it I will mix everything together. I like it that way. 
thanks for a great recipe

I've made this recipe twice.  With and without artichokes. -- better with them.  I used 2 tsp prepackaged chopped garlic and 1 to 1&1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of roasting fresh garlic cloves, and added black pepper. (Don't add salt, it's salty enough without)  I mixed everything together instead of layering.  Be sure to use fresh parmesan, not the powdery kind, and add extra in the mixture with extra mozz. cheese!! mmmm... cheese...  Per other reviews, I was scared to use jarred sauce, but couldn't find canned. Used Ragu's jarred alfredo sauce anyway (10 oz = 1&1/4 cup), and it was perfect.  Serve with chips, and great as leftovers too!

HELPFUL TIPS WHEN SERVING TO GUESTS: I make this so much but each time end up having to re-read the changes I made b/c they COMPLETELY make a difference.  The biggest thing I've learned from making this so many times is... to invest in one of those warmers/small crockpot and letting this sit in here for guests.  It's so heavenly warm ...completely ick cold (but perfect if warmed up again).  Use the entire 8 oz cream cheese, never use Kraft Alfredo (for ANY recipe... not matter of taste..it just completely stinks and is watery) ...use the entire 15 oz alfredo if that's how much your jar is, and definitely up the mozz to 1.5 Cups.  Someone recommended 2 Cups and each time... it's too cheesy to my guests.  Don't get scared off by those who say you have to do the garlic step.  Do it ...don't. ....don't even add garlic... it will still taste fantastic!!!  I've done it the long way, the kind in a jar, and the powder.  All taste good. This is just the go-to when I have guests because they can't stop talking about it.  This is to DIE FOR!!

Not a big fan of this recipe. The taste of the Alfredo sauce really took over the taste of this dish. If you do decided to make this I would recommend less Alfredo sauce, use the entire brick of cream cheese and add some Asiago cheese.

Update: I just made this again for a Halloween get together and it is still fabulous and I never have leftovers.

I made this for a New Year's party and it was a hit!!!  I was a little worried after reading the reviews that the alfredo might be too prominent so I made a few adjustments.  I made a double batch and used a 16oz jar of alfredo, 1/4c fat free plain yogurt, 1/4c low fat mayo, 1/4c more of mozzarella and 1/4c more of parmesian. I also just used minced roasted garlic. I didn't read the directions properly and I mixed everything together - which is the way to go.  I then cooked it on low in my slow cooker so it could be kept warm all night.  It tasted better than any restaurant dip I have ever had AND it passed my picky husband test - he raved about it.  I will definately make this recipe again!

This is excellent!  I made a few changes that make it a bit tastier and more simple.  I use Bertolli Garlic Alfredo sauce (jarred), whipped garlic & herb cream cheese, 1 Tablespoon minced garlic (jarred), 1/2 cup mozzerela cheese, 1 cup italian blend cheese, and 1/2 cup colby. I also chop the artichokes and add a little garlic powder and salt. I also mix all the ingredients in a bowl and top with a little shredded italian blend for presentation. This is not exactly a healthy choice, but a good "once-in-a-while" indulgence! I never have to worry about bringing home leftovers when I take it to a party--always a hit!

Holy moly!  This is the best spinach dip I have eaten or made.  I used 8 oz cream cheese, and a jar of alfredo, which was more than 10 oz, and 1 t garlic powder.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave, mixed all in a bowl, moved to shallow dish and baked for 25 min.  OMG is all I can say.

This is fantastic!!!  I brought this to a party last night and with all the different foods that were there, everyone was in line for this stuff!  Many people commented on how it was MUCH better than restaurant style dip.  I added a whole package of cream cheese and instead of 1 cup of mozarella cheese, I added 2 cups total.  What a cheesey delight!  I cut up some french baguette bread for the dip and that really made it great!  I will be using this over and over again!

Made this for company when I knew we'd need a lot of snacks around.  Was trying to make something nice for my friends who aren't as "adventuresome" as me.  Even though the ingredient list is unassuming, the flavor is incredible!  Be sure to roast your garlic ahead.  Friends will keep asking you for your recipe.

Updated 1/27/11:  I still make this all the time, but I've made it even easier because I don't bake it anymore.  I just mix all the ingredients in a casserole dish and microwave it until it's hot.  Everything melts together quickly and it tastes just like it's been in the oven, but takes a fraction of the time.  Original Review 3/19/02:  This dip was incredible and was so unbelievably easy!  I made this for a bridal shower and everyone wanted the recipe.  The bride's aunt wanted to take the leftovers home with her but I was selfish and kept them for myself.:)  I used fresh spinach that I steamed and finely chopped.  I just layered everything in the pan the night before, covered in plastic wrap and stored in the fridge until I needed to cook it.  I popped it in the oven and added about 15 minutes to the cook time (because it was cold) and it came out perfectly!  We served it in a hollowed out bread bowl and it was great!  The only change I will make in the future is to add more garlic (but we like garlic in my family).  I will be making more of this for myself!  Thanks for the great recipe, Terra!

Absolutely delicious dip recipe and very easy to make (hardest part is baking and peeling the garlic and there's really not much to that).   Made exactly as the recipe called and wouldn't change a thing.  It was delicious - probably better than what I've had in restaurants.    It did take longer than 30 minutes to get "bubbly" - closer to 40 maybe 45 minutes in the oven.   Took out and transferred to a crock pot on warm for people to snack on throughout the day at Easter.   Very important to remove excess water from the spinach and artichokes before cooking.  Will definitely make again.

Changes I made - which were very few.  I did not bake this.  I instead put it in my crockpot.  Used Bertolli alfredo pasta sauce.  Used a generic brand of frozen chopped spinach. Dont use marinated artichokes.  Drained and rinsed the artichokes very well (chopping them with a slap/chop type thing).  Used the Costco/Kirkland minced garlic, about 2 TBS.  Used a generic 2cup package cheese blend, mozzerella/parmesan.  Used the whole 8oz package of cream cheese.  I mixed everything together the night before in the crock and let it sit in the fridge until this morning.  High for 1hr, switching down to low for another 3hrs.  Giving it a good stir every 30 minutes or so.  Brought it in for a surprise baby shower and everyone raved about it! And I'm going home with a clean crockpot!  :)

What a wonderful dip! I doubled the cream cheese and mozzarella, and used a 15oz. jar of Bertolli Alfredo Sauce with Portabello Mushrooms. Really outstanding flavor... we served it with breadsticks and garlic pita chips. When those were gone, my husband was eating it with a spoon. This one's a real keeper. We'll be making it again on Christmas Eve. Thanks, TERRAD!

Although not a HUGE fan of spinach and artichoke dip, my husband is, so I made this for him.  I used the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce recipe from this site instead of buying it.  The whole thing turned out FABULOUS!  He swears it is the best dip he has ever had!  I really liked it too!  He loved the fact that it didn't have a layer of oily fat on the top like so many places serve - and he believes it is because I used the alfredo sauce instead of mayo.  I don't know about that, all I know is that it is a hit and I wouldn't change a THING!

This dip was superb!  It hit the spot with my out of town guest last week.  I did stir my ingredients instead of layering them.  And served the dip in a hollowed out Sour Dough Loaf with Blue Corn Chips.  This one is a winner.  Thanks for sharing.

I just love this recipie.  I used to go to Applebee's and order their artichoke and spinach dip and this is by far better.  Not only is this dip simple to make but it is affordable.  Now I make it all the time.  It's a favorite at get togethers and I think my husband would like to live off of it.  Many thanks for posting this great recipie and if your reading this review to decide if you want to try it or not, take it from me, try it you won't be dissapointed.

I was looking for a good Artichoke and Spinach Dip recipe for a BBQ I'm going to tomorrow. I decided to do a "test batch" and I'm ashamed to say that my husband and I devoured the entire thing :/ It's SOOOO good!!!! The Alfredo sauce is really what puts the kick in this. I didn't have time to roast the garlic, so I just put about a tablespoons of jarred garlic I had in my 'fridge. This recipe seems like it can be pretty versatile.

This was SO good warm from the oven. We used a fat free cream cheese and a light version of the alfredo sauce, and the difference wasn't noticeable at all. We put tortilla chips in a dish and warmed them in the oven, too ... will DEFINITELY make this again! This really is restaurant quality!

Made this dip for my sister's baby shower yesterday and it was very good. I used half the spinach called for which was plenty and Trader Joe's Alfredo. I will try it with Bertoli Alfredo next time as several other reviewers stated good results with that. The dip had a great texture and consistency. UPDATE: I have made this recipe twice more since my first review and have gotten rave reviews from my guests both times. I now use the Roasted Garlic Bertoli Alfredo. I roast 5 garlic cloves drizzled with olive oil in my oven on 350 for 30 minutes, than mince those and add them to the mixture. To prepare I blend all my cheeses first. I lightly pulse the artichoke w/ 8 to 10 marinated sun dried tomatoes in the Food Processor taking care to get small chunks, not a paste. I stir the artichoke and cheese mixtures together and add about 2 handfuls of torn, fresh baby spinach omitting the frozen spinach all together. I stir to incorporate the spinach well and spoon it into a prepared, glass 8x8 dish. I add additional shredded Parm. to the top and bake as directed. One last note: I personally don't like the look of the oils floating to the top when I pull the dip from the oven. I blot with paper towel to remove most of the excess oil and stir the dip into a serving bowl garnishing it with a bit more shredded parm making it picture perfect.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  I made this for my family to nibble on before we opened our gifts at Christmas and it was devoured.  There wasn't much nibbling...just a bunch of gulping! Even my picky husband who is not fond of "creamy/cheesy" dishes enjoyed this. I was amazed at how easy & delicious this was.  By accident I used the full 8 oz of cream cheese and it was perfect. Definitely recommend this one.  Thanks TerraD.

We used the food processor to chop the spinach and artichokes; then we folded that mixture into the sauce, cheeses, etc. We only used a few tablespoons of the parmesan because the sauce was already quite rich. We served it warm with toasted sourdough bread, cut into small triangles. It was delicious!

Made exactly as written and did not care for it. It was all spinach. I also did not care for the roasted garlic taste with the spinach. I notice now that most of the reviewers who "loved it" added the full jar of sauce and the whole 8 oz. of cream cheese. And did not roast the garlic. I will try this again with those ideas because my family likes spinach dip. I will also add more mozzarella. Sorry :(

This dip was very good. I added the whole block of cream cheese (what are you gonnna do with that other half?) :-) I also added onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper because I put those spices in basically everything I make! Update 01/11/08: Add a little chicken broth to the mix to make this more spreadable. Also add a splash of both hot sauce and lemon juice Yum! Many of my guests claimed this was actually better than restaurant style dip!!

Followed to the T first time, but do agree...the flavor of the jarred Alfredo sauce came through =-(

Last week, made same recipe IN A HURRY with What I had avail:
Defrosted 9-10 oz chopped spinach in a 8X8 Pyrex-squeezed liquid out.
Added only 3/4 of Classico-Roasted Garlic Alfredo, 'only' 2/3 of a cup of Jarred marinated artichoke hearts(Very strong but buttery when chopped)2 tb of it's marinade, 3-6tb milk, pinch or 2 of pepper flakes and Marjoram (MAJOR TASTE IMPROVEMENT!) 8oz reduced fat cream cheese cubed, 1/3C parmegiano-regiano cheese, 2/3C mozzarella and 1/3C colby for color. Microwaved it at -50% Power -covered, stirring every 2 min until creamy and bubbly .
WONDERFUL!!!

Loved it!!  I followed some of the others suggestions...I used the Classico garlic alfredo sauce, and I used an entire brick of cream cheese.  I cooked the entire thing in the crockpot on low for a few hours, and just kept stirring it occasionaly.  Then I set it on keep warm, and the entire family was helping themselves throughout the day!  Definitely turns out better than some restaurants!!

This recipe was fantastic! My guests loved it and asked for the recipes. The things that I did different were to add the whole block of cream cheese, added tsp. garlic powder instead of roasting garlic, added tsp. of hot sauce(I had cholula) and I mixed all ingedients together instead of layering them. Topped with parmesan cheese and browned top at the end. Served with sliced french baguette bread. Excellent.

I give the ingredients a four star rating because the alfredo sauce is AWESOME in this dip! However, instead of garlic cloves I use garlic powder and just combine all ingredients and pop into the microwave. Talk about EASY!!! Also, instead of mozerella chese we use colby monterey jack shredded cheese...I think it gives it a better flavor and Ive tried it both ways. Everyone who tried this dip couldnt get enough!

This is a really good dish - but soooooo rich.  I made it basically per the instructions but think I would mix everything together to start with rather than trying to layer.  Ended up mixing it all together after it was cooked since dipping to get all the ingredients involved dipping all the way to the bottom of the dish with many broken chips as the result.  Mix it all and you can dip just the top - and get more than just cheese.

This turned out wonderfully, but I did make some adjustments...I used three jars of marinated artichokes (about 18oz I think) and the whole package of cream cheese. Also, I only used half of the spinach, and not quite all the alfredo sauce. I brolied it a few minutes on high at the end to make the top nice and pretty. I added some chopped tomatoes to the top for garnish. Served with tortilla chips. It got rave reviews.

Wonderful recipe! Glad it was included in recipes featured from NC from the newsletter. Being from NC, it made me proud. The only difference that I did to this recipe was to use the entire block of cream cheese rather than half. Other than that, wonderful. Served with baked Pita chips for a pot luck, and people went nuts! Definitely a keeper. I also used just artichoke hearts cleaned of choke and internal leaves(not with any of the leaves still attached like some of the canned varieties that still has the "choke"). Thanks for submitting this recipe to AllRecipes!

With the modifications, I absolutely love this recipe! This is a great base without the sour cream mayo that many recipes recommend. Since Thanksgiving, I've made this recipe 3 times--yes, it's that good. Tips that I would give: use fresh (baby) spinach if available, definitely roast the garlic (doesnt take that long).. I tend to put the garlic in the oven, heat up the alfredo sauce ( Classico 4 cheese, I think I'm going to try the roasted red pepper next time), drain rinse and chop the artichokes and finely chop the spinach, my secrets for this recipe are to add salt, pepper, and for kicks I add jalapeno chiles and Indian red chili powder (paprika works as well).. while the alfredo sauce is heating (I think mine is 15 oz and I use all of it, it reduces in quantity upon heating), I put the chopped spinach, artichokes, take out the garlic and add that it in there, and add the chopped picked jalapeno slices  and add most of the mozzarella and parmesan (i added pepperjack in there today as well, it was quite good), and add the cream cheese, then finally add the hot sauce which melts and molds everything together, making it easy to mix. I spread this on the pan and add the remaining cheese.. the jalapenos do make a huge difference and heating the alfredo is key for a spreadable mixture!

I didn't give it 4 stars, which would indicate a good recipe if not great, because I had to tweak it so much. It might have been my own fault as I read other reviews about using Classico roasted garlic Alfredo as opposed to regular Alfredo, and I thought "yum! that sounds good!". However after it was made, and I put a spoonful in the microwave to taste test it, the dip was pretty darn flavorless. Yes, it was garlic-y but there was a lot of flavor missing to make it right to serve at a party, and it was EXTREMELY thick. So I threw in another 1/3 cup of parmesan - which I grated fresh hoping it would give it a kick. Threw a dab in the microwave, tried it again, still a no go. So I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tbsp whipping cream to "loosen" up the dip. Heated it, tried it - still not quite there. Finally I threw in close to a whole cup of Sharp Cheddar cheese and a dash more cayenne pepper. Tried it, it was decent finally so I quit. It's OK. Not good or great like I thought it would be from the tons of reviews. Next time I'll use plain Alfredo, probably Ragu, and plain ol' garlic just like the original recipe calls for. If its better (which I hope it is) I'll come back a change my review.

I've made this a few times now and it is always a hit.  I used Trader Joe's alfredo sauce and it tasted fine.  I also used the whole package of cream cheese for ease and minced garlic from a jar.  It makes a lot, so be ready for a party! I also use my stick blender to blend the artichokes (just a couple of pulses) so I don't have big chunks of it.

Better than the Restaurant!!
I followed the suggestions using a full jar of Bertolli sauce, 2 cups of italian cheese, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and a full brick of room temperature creme cheese.  I also pulsed the artichoke hearts in my food processor before mixing everything together.  I mixed all but 1/2 cup of the italian cheese into the mixture and baked for 30 min. then spinkled the remaining 1/2 over the top and baked for an additional 5 min. on speed bake to melt the cheese on top.  Turned out awesome!!

YUMMY! Instead of the cloves of garlic, I too used a jar of CLASSICO Roasted Garlic Alfredo Sauce. I also used Parmesean/Romano grated cheese (because that's what I had in the fridge). Lastly, I used a 13 x 9 in. baking dish and after the 30 minutes of baking, stirred the mixture and continued to cook 10 minutes longer. Raves from everyone, and my 3 year old is still eating reheated leftovers!!

I thought this recipe was horrible.  I made it for work and everyone liked it but me.  Will not make this again.

This recipie was delicious!  I have tried several spinach artichoke dips and have never been satisfied until this one.  The alfredo sauce is the key- all the other recipies I've tried call for mayo (which makes the dip too tangy).  I highly recommend this recipie!!

This is gooey, stringy and delicious. I used baked garlic, the entire 8 oz. block cream cheese, the 15 oz. jar Bertolli mushroom Alfredo sauce, 1 1/2 cups Sargento Mozzarella/Provolone, 1/2 c. Sargento shredded Parmesan. I added Tabasco and nutmeg. Left it overnight to develop the flavors. Baked it in a small Crockpot 1 hour on high 2 hours on low. Served with toasted baguette slices. 

I could see adding sauteed wild mushrooms or more artichoke hearts. This would also be good as stuffing for mushroom caps topped with buttered bread or panko crumbs or crispy fried shallots or onion rings.

I use a whole pkg of cream cheese, and just use canned crushed garlic for ease (fresh roasted is better). It's delicious! Just serve with tortilla chips.

I made this exactly as listed except for powdered garlic instead of fresh roasted. It was excellent. I do think other reviewers were right to add a bit more cream cheese and mozzarella which I will be doing next time.

This gets rave reviews every time I make it!  I have "tweaked" it though (as I always do) I use Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce and Pepper Jack cheese instead of the Mozza....adds a really great kick!  Excellent recipe, thanks!  :)

I strongly recommend reading several reviews to see how people changed the recipe. 

Changes I made: I did not roast the garlic, I used a bag of Italian blend cheese, I used the whole block of cream cheese, I only used half of the alfredo sauce.

I threw everything in my baby crockpot on high and stirred frequently. I was making it for an office party so I started it when I got to the office and it was ready by the time of our luncheon. Everyone loved it and I went home with an empty crockpot!

This dip couldn't be any easier and more impressive.  I am asked to bring this to parties occasionally and it's always a huge hit.  You just throw it all together, bake it, and voila!  Everyone is impressed by it, and the entire pan is usually gone by the end of the party, if not well before!  Nothing about this recipe needs to be changed.  Follow it exactly, and you will be the hit of the party!

I made this just as the recipe asked for, except that I put a whole cream cheese (8 oz) in there. I thought the Alfredo sauce was overwhelming. If I were to make this again, I would definitely put less Alfredo sauce in it, add more shredded cheese and maybe more cream cheese. 
The way the recipe is now, I wouldn't make it again.

I don't think this is restaurant style.  Nothing like what I've had at restaurants.  I really don't understand the rave reviews.  It wasn't terrible, just not the restaurant style that I was hoping for.

It went over well at parties I took it to, but I thought it was expensive to make, and next time I'm hungry for it I'll probably try buying it at the store in the frozen section or premade from Costco.  I didn't think it was as good as the appetizers I've bought at restaurants.  But if you do want to make it yourself, shop around for the artichokes and then it won't be as pricey.

This is so so good. I wanted to eat it by the spoonful. I made it for a potluck party last night and out of all the food there, everyone kept commenting this dip was the best item!  I just used minced garlic and mixed it in with all the other ingredients. I also used the whole bar of cream cheese as others suggested. These are the only two changes I made. This one's a keeper!

I made the recipe as written and it was very good.  I thought it was missing something, though and so I added some fresh squeezed lemon juice and WOW!  It really brightened up the artichokes and gave the dip so much more depth of flavor.  Try it!  Trust me!

My family loved this recipe!!!  After reading other reviews, I used a jor of Classico roasted garlic alredo suace and did not add any other garlic.  It turned out perfect and was better warmed over the next day.  This recipe is a keeper for me!!!

A hit at the party.  You really have to use the REFRIGERATED Alfreodo sauce.  I even chose the "light"version.  And use 2 cups of mozzorella to get that 6 inches-string-effect. Make sure the artichoke is in "water".  Some brined artichoke brands are too salty and it will ruin this recipe.  Some commented on using half of the spinach.  I don't think so. And use the whole block (8 oz) of cream cheese.

When I first saw this recipe, I had a doubt about the Alfredo sauce but wanted to try something different so went with it.

What I did different:
Peeled and chop the garlic then roasted in in the oven with a little olive oil.
After I had assembled the dish, I found it a bit dry so added Â½ block cream cheese.
I also added a handful of chopped smoked almonds to give it a bit of a crunch. 
Seasonings â€“ black pepper and Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning.

DÃ©licieux!!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I took two dips to a 4th of July party. The first is a queso style dip I am always asked to bring to parties. I had never made the Artichoke & Spinach Dip before and was going purely on the wonderful ratings. This dip was gone in a flash and outshined the usual favorite!. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

We LOVE this recipe. I'm known for it, and my family and friends always make sure I bring it to every event, party, cookout, any excuse to get more! I
ve had to give out the recipe countless times, I've never gotten a complaint, not even from my artichoke hating hubby. I always use Bertolli's Garlic Alfredo Sauce, and the whole 8oz package of cream cheese. You don't have to use roasted garlic, minced does just us well! Make sure it's well mixed before you bake it or you'll get pockets of cheese!

Be sure to use HALF of an 8 oz. pkg of cream cheese it makes the world of difference!  Also after mine was baked I popped it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to enhance the presentation!

The best recipe I have found for this dip so far...I halfed the recipe because I was making it for two and it was more than enough.  We had the rest the next day.  I also stuffed some leftover raw mushrooms with the dip and baked them until the mushrooms were tender and juicy.  Delicious! I added more cheese and mixed in a bowl prior to spooning into greased baking dish.  I think it makes more sense to blend all the flavors together so they can get happy rather than layering it.  The key is the alfredo sauce. I used Roasted Garlic Classico.  A real winner!

Excellent recipe! Thanks so much!  Instead of roasting my own garlic, I have found "roasted garlic alfredo" sauce at the supermarket and used that instead.  It truly is similar to what you can find at various restaurants!  I've made this twice in the past week for different gatherings and it's been a huge hit!!

I've made this recipe about 5 times I'd say and will make it again for a party this Saturday.  Everyone absolutely loves this dip every time I make it.  Family, friends and co-workers have all raved about it.  Make sure to use the parmesean from the deli because this melts unlike the powdery cheese in the canister you get in the spaghetti isle.  I also make it in a pyrex bowl because that's the only thing I have that has a lid and it works wonderfully.  People have actually started requesting I make this for parties!  Use a little more alfredo for easier dipping.  Classico is the brand I use.  :^)

I made this recipe according to the directions but took others advice and used chopped garlic from a jar instead of roasting it. I used the whole package of cream cheese, and also used 2 cups of mozzarella and almost 1 cup of parmesan. At first I used less parm but it was a little bland and I thought the additional parmesan would add a little salt. I also added atleast a tablespoon of fresh ground pepper. To be honest, it was really good but it needed a little more flavor/kick. I think next time I will play around with reducing the alfredo sauce (it made it a little TOO creamy) and maybe adding a jalapeno or even cayenne. I thought the amount of spinach and artichoke was just right. Thanks for the recipe and all the tips!

I've brought this to work twice and it has been devoured both times.  This time, I doubled it and it STILL was gone before Noon!  I use roasted garlic alfredo which gives it the right amount of garlic flavor for my taste, so I nix the cloves.  I use the whole block of cream cheese, blend everything together and add a handfull of extra mozzarella before baking.  If I'm taking it somewhere, I transfer to a crock pot and keep it on low.  I serve with toasted mini bread chips that you can buy bagged. It's VERY creamy and the flavor is fantastic.

the first time i made this I also used a whole cream cheese instead of a half (by mistake) - and I think I liked it better - though, it took longer to bake.  Stirring it before putting it into the oven is a must (especially with the extra cream cheese).  I cut tortillas into small pizza-style slices and fried them into chips to go with it.  Very good recipe.

This recipe is great as is but don't be afraid to try variations. A really good one is to add 1/4 cup minced onion, 1 lb chopped cooked shrimp and havarti cheese instead of the mozzarella.  Very tasty.

Very rich and high in calories but very good.  (My spouse and I ate so much that we both had stomachaches, so pace yourself!)

I don't think it makes that huge of a batch.  The two of us ate it and had leftovers, but I would probably double it for a party.  

I think this would be better with fresh spinach, and maybe 15 oz. rather than 10 oz. of spinach. I like the fresh-tasting spinach dip from the Cheesecake Factory, so that's what I;m going for.

Outstanding...As good if not better than dishes found in a restaraunt. I followed the recipe layering the ingredients in the order stated. After the cooking time in the recipe, I uncovered the dish and mixed it up completely with a spoon. I then returned it to the oven, uncovered for an additional 15 minutes. The result was a slightly crusty top with a nice creamy interior. Perfect!!!

Excellent!! Many compliments and everyone wants the recipe!! However, use the full 8 oz of cream cheese and stir when you remove it from the oven.  Also, There is really no need to roast the garlic.  It worked out great when I just added the garlic raw and cooked it with the rest of the ingredients.  Bravo!!

This turned out as good as most restaurant versions of this dip.  I did like others suggested and chopped the spinach and artichokes in a food processor-which is good so you don't end up with huge pieces of spinach or artichokes in the dip.  The store only had marinated artichokes, so the artichoke flavor was a little stronger, but I like artichokes so that was alright with me.  Next time I am going to add some extra cheese on top and broil it after baking it to get the top nice and golden.

This recipe is the best spinach artichoke dip I have ever had.  I add a little more of each of the cheeses to make it cheesier and when I take it to parties, everyone raves!!

This is the best - even better than the restaurants!
We personally do not care for the bitterness of artichokes so we doubled the spinach and omitted the artichokes - it was great!

Guess I'm the "Lone Ranger" on this one...heehee....anyway, I did not care for this dip at all.  I had high hopes bc of all the GREAT reviews.....I did not like it with the jarred Alfredo Sauce......I don't like Alfredo Sauce from a jar....anyway, I DID like Florentine Artichoke Dip recipe on this very website MUCH better--should've stuck with THAT one......

This is a very good recipe! It's quick, easy, creamy, and absolutely fabulous! I didn't have any garlic cloves so I used pre-minced garlic, about a tablespoon. I also added a pinch of salt. A great recipie to take to a party!!!!

Yum!  I used the entire 8 oz of cream cheese, marinated artichokes and 1/2 jar of Bertolli creamy alfredo sauce.  Don't be afraid to use all 4 cloves of garlic.  That zip is needed.  Once the dip was heated through, I removed the lid & broiled for a couple of minutes.  Gave it a nice brown bubbly top.  Rather expensive to make, so save it to treat yourself or the people you really like.

This was very good.  Everyone loved it and it went really fast at the party I brought it to.  I think 30 min. is too long for the garlic, 15-20 min. should be fine.  I would also recommend mixing the cheeses and the alfredo sauce together before adding it to the garlic, spinach, and artichoke.  I added the cream cheese last, and it was difficult to get it mixed in really well with the rest of the ingredients.

Very good.  I did use the whole block of cream cheese, and added a bit of crushed red pepper; we like our food spicy.  Only used 1/2 the package of spinach, and it was even almost too much.  Overall, very yummy!  Served with sliced French baguette.

A friend (who claims to not know how to cook) made this and OMG, it is so good!!  First and only spinach artichoke dip I've had outside a restaurant that tastes as good. Definitely better on day 2.
She didn't change anything.  I'm pretty picky, I see several 5 star reviews, I make the recipe and am often disappointed.  This one is a hit. Adults loved it and I saw kids scraping the bottom of the bowl.

This makes a ton of dip! Filled a 2 Quart baking dish nicely. That being said the flavor was just okay. We normally love artichoke & spinach dip, but we ended up throwing most of this in the trash. It could use more flavor so play with it.

This was ok, but I apparently had higher expectations.  I don't really like the Alfredo sauce in it.  I think it needs more actual cheese instead.

This recipe is so easy and always turns out great. I've never made this with the artichoke hearts, but I'm sure it would be great with them. I use a 15-16 oz. jar of alfredo sauce, a whole package of cream cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella, and 1/2 cup of parmesan. It usually doesn't need the full 30 minutes to be melted and bubbly. Delicious!

I have made this dozens of times, but only recently took it to the next level.  I usually add a bit of olive oil and then blend everything in my blender before putting it in the glass baking dish.  This last time... wait for it... I added cooked, crisped bacon.  Mind blown.

Very good and I will definitely make again with a couple of additions.   I added about 1/4 cup of onion, 8 or 9 drops of Tabasco sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of Sriracha sauce.    I really don't think the roasting of the garlic is a necessary step and could as easily be done by mincing the garlic and adding to the rest of the mixture and baking.   I also used the full 8oz block of cream cheese.  We served with beer bread and I had about 50/50 comments about those who preferred beer bread with it and those that preferred chips.

I followed the instructions exactly and the dip turned out great! Creamy and cheesy (definitely not healthy if that's what you're looking for!). I garnished with fresh chopped tomatoes and crushed red peppers. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be making this again but that's only because it's ridiculously impractical (and expensive) to make dips at home when you're living on your own.

I loved this stuff!  Just like the kind at the restuarant.  I added a few extra garlic cloves and extra cheese.  I threw everything into the crock pot and turned it to low, was ready in a few hours.  Everyone at the New Years party loved it!  Thanks

It looks like it would be very good, but we all found it rather bland.  It smelled wonderful while it was in the oven, but that was it.  Somehow it needs to be jazzed up.

For quite a few years now I have used this recipe to make dip for parties at home and away. It has never been anything but a fantastic success. I've been asked for the recipe nearly every time I take the dip to an event. We even used it for our wedding reception. I throw everything in a crock pot, heat it up, and voila!

This is amazing and will become my go-to appetizer for when company comes over.  So easy to put together and using ingredients that are easy to keep on hand.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and used the whole package of cream cheese, softened slightly in the microwave; and blended all the ingredients together before adding to my baking dish.  I topped it with a sprinkle of 3-cheese blend in the last 10 minutes of baking time. Soooooo good.  It disappeared very quickly and was the hit of the party!

Rinsed the artichokes and saved the mozzarella for last.  Wow!  Everyone LOVED this!  Making it again on Sunday for the game.
Thanks for the great recipe.

To die for! To completely drain the spinach, I place it between two plates and squeeze. Works like a charm. I buy the quartered artichoke hearts to save time on chopping and actually mash them with a spoon while mixing all of the ingredients together (a must). Perfect quick, easy, and delicious recipe. Scoop it into a hollowed out bread bowl for a nice presentation.

I had such high hopes for this recipe and was pretty disappointed when I actually ate it. It tasted like I was eating glorified alfredo sauce. SO salty too! Probably won't ever make this again.

so flippin good!!  this is a very close replica to applebee's spinach dip, which has long been a favorite of mine.  i omitted the artichiokes because i don't like them, but was true to the originial recipe as otherwise written. i brought it to a church group tonight and the plate was licked clean - i'd say it's definitely not 12 servings, at least not 12 decent sized ones.  everyone really raved over it though, although some mentioned the missing artichokes :)

This was good.  I feel it could have used just a little more flavor.  Next time, I will add a little chopped Onion and a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  Other than that, very good dish for parties or large gatherings.  Thanks again.

I really enjoyed this one!  I had an appetizer party last week and although this one did not get gobbles up, I think it was only because I had WAY too much food on the go!!!  We ate the leftovers the next day and even re-heated, it was great!  The only changes I made was that I omitted the roasted garlic and used roasted garlic alfredo sauce instead.  I also mixed all the ingredients together, did not layer it.

This was okay.  I made as it was written, tasted, then doctored, so think I can give it a fair review.  It was too bland. I added the other 1/2 of the cream cheese package as other reviewers suggested and some sour cream that I thought would give it a little zing.  Took it to a Super Bowl party where someone else brought a different spinach/artichoke dip, so of course I compared them...and sorry to say, I liked her's better.  Probably going to ask her for her recipe.  Won't make this one again.

I made this for a get together full of teenage girls. THEY LOVED IT! I put it in a crock pot and kept it on the "warm" setting until it was time to serve. I followed the directions exactly EXCEPT for roasting my own garlic. I didn't have time (i have roasted my own garlic before) so I used a 16oz. jar of CLASSICOâ€™s Roasted Garlic Alfredo and I couldn't tell the difference. The girls were scraping the inside of the crock pot.

Terrific dip!  I made for a get together with friends and it was eaten up quickly by everybody!  I made two batches - one as written and a second with the addition of roasted pasillo peppers (because I had some!).  People who like a little spice went nuts for that version, others who didn't care for spice were so happy with the original.

Tastes EXACTLY like Applebees! Very good, creamier than my usual recipe. Roasting the garlic was nice, but not necessary. Next time I'll just chop it up and toss it in. I also recommend uncovering for the last 10 minutes so the top gets golden brown, but thats just my preference.

Absolutally perfect!!!  I always start by following the recipe how it is written before I experiment and add to make it taste right, but I was amazed with how perfectly wonderful this turned out. I softened the creamcheese in the microwave,  and added all the rest of the ingredients and mixed it all together. I didn't have to chop anything, as I mixed it all together it pretty much seperated into little pieces. I heated about a 1/4 cup in the microwave to test the taste and I ended up eating it with a spoon, it was just so good... but I did not roast the garlic because I used the minced in a jar..

I do not see how you can go wrong with this one, the only thing I did different was to roast my own garlic, used jar alfado sauce and a little hot sauce because I like a little kick to it. Mixed it all together, came out great for me.

I took this to a family gathering on Father's Day and everyone raved about this dip!! I didn't mince the garlic enough and someone bit into a piece that was a little strong.  It wasn't exactly like Applebee's, but it was still wonderful!!! Thank you!!

I made this dip for my Aunt's birthday party. The only thing I did differently was substitute garlic powder for the 4 cloves.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  They were all surprised about the jar of alfredo- they would have never guessed that was in there.  So easy to make, and delicious, too! I will be trading out my old recipe for this one.

OMG...I've made this recipe twice ((1) baby shower and (2) over xmas).  Both times this was a great hit.  A lot of my relatives over xmas were skeptical b/c they're so used to having restaurant dip.  Let me tell you...people were going back for seconds, thirds & FOURTHS!  I cooked this in my crockpot and couldn't keep this stuff in the pot.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone in a matter of hours!  A+++ recipe!!!  This is a keeper!

You have to, have to, have to roast the garlic like the recipe calls for.  Roasted garlic has a significantly different flavor than raw garlic & it contributes greatly to the end product!  I used about 7 cloves of garlic, a whole 16oz jar alfredo-sauce, a little extra spinach & the whole pkg of cream cheese.  I baked it covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered & baked another 10, then broiled about 3 minutes on low to lightly brown the top.  Very good with tortilla chips or wheat thins!

AMAZING!! I made this for my brother's housewarming party, and it was devoured in minutes!! My aunt, 40 years older than me, even asked ME for the recipe!!!  Changes: I followed two previous recommendations: i used an entire package of cream cheese and i also MIXED the ingredients prior to spreading into the pan.  A+ will definately make again!!

I had to laugh when I stumbled across this recipe and it's rave reviews.  This is basically the same recipe Applebees uses for their Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  I worked at one and watch the cooks prep this all the time.  Of course it is awesome, everyday hundreds of people order it from us all across the USA.   Ironically I was looking for a "fancier" dip recipe but apparently (from the the reviews) this is the way to go.  So if you like the Spinach & Artichoke dip from Applebees then this is definitely the recipe for you!

This recipe was Perfect! EXACTLY what I have been looking for!   I used a cheesy Ragu alfredo sauce, Roasted Garlic and Parmesan flavored. There was a very nice presence of garlic in the sauce, so I only used 1 clove of garlic instead of 4. Also, I read some reviews and took the suggestion to use the whole package of cream cheese instead of half. I also sprinkled some additional parm and mozarella cheeses on top before sticking it in the oven. It was EXQUISITE! It was Very moist and creamy, yet not too runny. It works Perfectly with Tollhouse crackers.  One suggestion that I was going to do (but forgot to) was add a bit of dill weed.   Between all 7 people who ate it (including myself) it was gone in a flash. I am not looking elsewhere for a recipe for spinach and artichoke dip. This is the one I am standing by! It was EXACTLY what I have been looking for.

BEST EVER. I thought I might be copping out by adding alfredo, but it was just so dang tasty. 

I used Bertolli's Roasted Garlic Alfredo from the jar. I've also used minced garlic instead of roasted garlic a few times, just to save time, and it didn't make too much of a difference. Sometimes I don't have shredded parmesan and leave it out.. I don't notice a difference.

I've also made this recipe in my fondue pot, using minced garlic instead and it's just as good, if not better!

One time I used the whole bag of Mozz though.. big mistake. Stick to the recipe and you'll be delighted!

And if you have extra time, mix the garlic, spinach and artichokes in a container and let them meld together overnight. I did this for Thankgiving and the dip was even more amazing.

I've made this several times and everyone LOVES it. A few people have even said that they HATED spinach and artichoke dip before this one! :)

This is WONDERFUL!  I made this for some out of town guests and was a bit concerned because one of them is a gourmet cook.  She thought it was AWESOME!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese and an 8 oz pkg of shredded mozzarella.  I mixed everything together and then spread it in the 8 x 8 baking dish.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for a delicious easy to make recipe!

YUM!  YUM!  YUM!  I made this last night and it was the BEST that I've ever had!  I did not layer it, but just went ahead and mixed it all together before spreading it into the serving dish and baking it.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave before mixing it in to make it easier.  This was absolutely wonderful!

I'm one of those people who has to bring food to a party, and this looked interesting,  so after reading the reviews, blah blah blah, this is what I did: I used the whole 8oz block of cream cheese, which I creamed with a heaping tablespoonful of chopped garlic(in place of the roasted), and squeezed the spinach dry by wrapping in clean paper towel and twisting gently. The artichokes seemed to have some tough pieces as I was chopping them, so I threw those pieces out. I mixed everything together in a bowl with a pinch of cayenne pepper and a tsp of granulated garlic (you can't have enough) and refrigerated it overnight, dumped everything in a small crock pot and turned it on high for an hour before the office party. It  scored rave reviews. We mounded it on sturdy crackers or bagel chips. Some people just ate it with a spoon! I will be making this many more times. Oh by the way, the Boss loved it! Added note: I recommend using Bertolli Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce. I made this on 12/20/2018 and used a 6.5 oz jar of Gioia brand marinated artichokes, drained and chopped, and I believe it was even better tasting!

This is so delicious!!!  Whenever I'm expecting company, this is one of the recipes I go to every time.  I serve it with pita chips, which I make by brushing a mixture of EVOO, garlic, onion powder, and black pepper on pita bread, before slicing it into wedges and baking it in the oven until crisp.  I made it several times without the artichokes, and it still was a hit.

I been using this recipes for years. It's always a hit! I made a few changes over the years. I use Green Giant frozen creamed spinach instead of regular spinach.  A whole jar of Alfredo sauce, 7 blend Italian cheese instead of mozzarella and just a lil lemon zest. Turns out perfect everytime!!!!!

I never follow recipes I always add a little something something. For this I followed recipe, then added a bag of mixed white cheeses (asiago, provolone, etc.) I believe Sargento makes it. Then I add seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder. I also use a whole package of cream cheese and whole container of Classico 4 cheese alfredo. First I take the artichoke and spinach and mince them in a food processor. When they become small enough to liking I dump them in a bowl. I pour in ingredients by the halves while taste testing to check what it needs more of. Once mixed to your liking then I throw it in a crock pot and walk away. (depending on how soon you need it crank that bad boy up. But if you make it early and don't need it asap let it simmer on low until ready. This will make the dip even better!). Overall I absolutely love the recipe but like all recipes you need to fine tune it to your tastes.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added entire block of cream cheese and the full jar of alfredo sauce (Great Value brand).  Really good, but I think I will use Bertolli Roasted Garlic next time as other reviewers suggested for a little more flavor.

I absolutely loved this..I didn't roast the garlic and it still tasted great. I've already made it twice and will be making it a few more times. Thanks for sharing

I made this dip for a Halloween party on 10/26/13 and then AGAIN for a wedding shower I hosted on 10/27/13 (the 26th was a dry run to see if it was any good!).  There was about a cup left when the parties were over - just enough for me for later! I had read the good (and bad) reviews and prepared myself for anything - but by the rave reviews on the spot, their plates being thrown away empty, and the small amount leftover, I'd say it was a hit!

I did adjust the ingredients in the manner:
-Used a grocery store prepared minced roasted garlic (about 2-2.5 tsp = 4 cloves of garlic) 
-Used Bertolli's Garlic Alfredo sauce
-Used entire package of cream cheese
-Used 1/2 c of parmesan cheese

I adjusted the prep directions in this manner:
-I didn't have to prep the garlic, so that saved a TON of time.
-I mixed all ingredients in a bowl WELL - the cream cheese, if not soft will not mix well and will lack flavor, it needs to be mixed together to get all the flavors in love!
-I cooked it till bubbly (about 20 min) and then dumped it into a crock pot on warm (or low) for long-time serving.

If you have leftovers, I recommend reheating with a little bit of milk (it probably condensed down some in the crock pot) and then you can top with cheese for yummy seconds!

I will make this again for work potlucks, my friends love Spin-art Dips! :)

YUM!!!! I can't give this enough stars! I'm a huge fan of a certain casual restaurant chain's spinach and artichoke dip but I hated getting it because it's so expensive. I came across this recipe and I wasn't sure about the alfredo sauce but thought I'd give it a shot. I made a double batch and used Newman's Own and Bertolli Roasted Garlic flavored Alfredo sauce in the jar. I also added a container of the philadelpia garlic cooking cream along with regular cream cheese as well. I did this so I didn't have to mess with roasting garlic but I'd still have the flavor. 

This stuff was so good I seriously gave myself a horrid stomachache because I could not stop devouring it. I did have to add a little bit of spices to it to give it a bit more flavor, I also added a smidge of sour cream too. Don't get me wrong it was good with out any additions, I just wanted it to have a little more kick. I can't remember what spices I used exactly but I just read over other recipes and incorporated a mixture of what they used. 

I took this with me to a family gathering and everyone loved it. It makes a lot though and I definitely did not need a double batch that's for sure. I will make this again for sure in the future. Right now I can't even bear to look at if since I ate so much of the darn stuff.

Creamy, garlicky, and delicious! I followed the recipe, except I used roasted garlic alfredo sauce (unrefrigerated) instead of 4 cloves garlic to save time. Also, I mixed all ingredients in a bowl, then poured into a baking dish so everything was evenly blended. It baked up all gooey and bubbly, and everyone at my Super Bowl party loved it. Serve with Triscuits for some nice salt flavor to balance the creaminess! 

Note: thaw the spinach WAY in advance of making the dip. I tried to rush the process by rinsing under hot water in a strainer, and then leaving it to soak in a bowl of hot water, and though it effectively thawed the spinach, it did create a huge mess in my sink and on my hands. If you let it thaw overnight or for a few hours ahead of time, you'll save yourself a headache during prep.

This was excellent! Made it for book club, and it was a hit. The only thing I did differently was that I didn't roast the garlic ahead of time... I used my garlic press and put it directly into the mixture. Will make again!

Wow! I read A LOT of the reviews on this before making. I think the recipe as is works out great. The only change I make is using from scratch alfredo sauce, and I use the whole package of cream cheese. I make this for a lot of family and church gatherings. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! I wish I could give this recipe more stars! It was delicious and better than any I have had anywhere else. I did use 8 oz of cream cheese and a whole jar of Bertolli 4 cheese alfredo sauce but kept everything else the same. I will definitely make this recipe again and again. Thanks!!

LOVE THIS dip!  (Would give it 4.5 if I could)   I have made it about 3-4 times for potlucks.  My only addition is a large dollup of sour cream to balance the alfredo sauce taste (which can come out a bit chalky).  I add a little more cheese at my husband's request.  I am constantly being asked how to make this dish and love giving it away to friends (though I never take too much credit - I am not afraid to say I got it on All Recipes, my secret weapon in the kitchen!!)

This is amazing. I made it the day after Thanksgiving for a family get together and everyone loved it. I have since had to bring it to Christmas and New Year's Eve with them! The alfredo makes it. Think it would be awesome topped with asiago cheese. Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this last night as an appetizer for my boyfriend and I. Delicious!  I love Applebee's Spinach and Artichoke Dip and this is just as good, if not better.  Like most other reviewer, I used the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese.  If you are a calorie counter, I'm sure buying 1/3 fat or light cream cheese would not affect the taste at all.  The only other things I did different was gave it three splashes of Frank's Hot Sauce and one splash of lemon juice on the spinach.  Warmed the cream cheese a bit, mixed all the cheeses together and then mixed in the spinach and artichokes.  Added some course ground black pepper before baking.  Oh, and I used a tablespoon of butter and sauteed about 2 tsp of minced garlic until browned and it turned out just fine, so personally I don't think roasting whole cloves for 20 minutes is necessary at all.  Delish! Thanks for an excellent recipe!

I wasn't really thrilled with this recipe. I followed the recipe as written also. I wanted to love it, but something was really off to us. First, I didn't like the flavor of the purchased alfredo sauce in this at all. Second, to me it was like a thicker version of creamed spinach. I was surprised being it has so many high ratings, maybe it's just me. I didn't think this was anything like a restaurant, at least what I have had. Thanks for sharing though.

This is a great recipe! I altered it just a lil for a double batch and added sour cream(needed some zing)...2 boxes frozen chopped spinach, 1 16 oz jar alfredo sauce (4 cheese), 2/3 C grated parm, 2 C mozz., 2 cans artichoke hearts, 4 tsp minced fresh garlic, tsp salt (to taste) and 1/2 C sour cream. Save a lil of the cheese to sprinkle on top before baking. Serve with Tortilla chips. IT WAS A HUGE HIT!!!

LOVE this!  I have cheated and thrown in chopped garlic and it's still good.  It is always a hit!

Never fails, EVERY time I make this for a gathering, someone asks for the recipe...usually I have to send it out to multiple people. It is so quick and easy. I never roast my garlic. I just use a tablespoon or so of minced garlic I always have in the fridge. I have made it the other way and you wouldn't know the difference.

This was a simple recipe to follow, and the end result tasted great! Not exactly like what I've had in restaurants, but it still tasted great. I had always gotten spinach & artichoke dip at restaurants, but never thought to make it myself. Also, about 10 minutes before I took it out of the oven, I sprinkled a handful of mozzarella cheese on top to melt, it turned out great! Served it with tortilla chips. I would also suggest mixing the ingredients around very well before baking, as I found a few pockets of cheese once it was done baking, which wasn't a big deal and could be remedied by stirring it up again once it was out of the oven.

I have made this at least a dozen times and I love it. You do not have to use the Italian mix, you can use just parm. cheese but it should be fresh. I use almost the entire jar of alfredo to keep it from being too thick. Also, I use a 16oz frozen bag of spinach and throw the frozen artichokes in the food processor first. Mix all the ingredients together and use the entire cream cheese package. Use Bertoli or Trader Joe's alfredo sauce, not Ragu. The roasted garlic is not mandatory, I just use fresh minced garlic. It always turns out great and everyone inhales it. Good with tortilla chips, garlic toast, carrots- anything to dip!

This recipe made me a star at my in-laws' party.  Everyone raved and wanted the recipe.  I used pre-chopped garlic and baked it for a few minutes.  I would like to use the roasted garlic, but I just didn't have the time - maybe next time I make this... there will be many next times!

This was a very simple recipe - the most timely portion was roasting the garlic, but it's truly worth the time.  Excellent tasting dip and is restaurant-quality.  This is a great recipe to add to a party or holiday menu.

Great recipe!!! I took the dip to a party at a friend's house and actually had other guests there seeking me out to compliment me. 

I made a couple of changes to the recipe. One was to use freshly chopped baby spinach instead of frozen spinach. The other was to dice up some roasted red peppers and add them, along with some scallions. These two additions, along with the fresh spinach, enhanced the flavor of the final product.

This recipe is so good.  It is even better on day 2.  I did roast my garlic and used 8 oz of cream cheese.  I just can't stop eating it.  I am so glad I will no longer have to purchase at restaurants.  Thanks so much.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I came REALLY close to my favorite restaurant's recipe. I did however make my own alfredo sauce from scratch and let my ingredients cook on low as I added them. Seasoning is key to keep the spinach from over powering this delectable, delightful dish. I also added crabmeat. This came out great for a first-timer. 
THANKS

I made this for our open house. I added some garlic cloves, fresh ground pepper and some basil and a dash of lemon juice. I marinated my artichoke hearts in a touch of olive oil and garlic and basil. I also added about 1/2c sour cream and blended my cheese into the dip. Yummy!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I searched the web for a recipe like this since I went to Macaroni Grill and had their Spinach Shrimp Artichoke dip.  I like others who posted before mixed all the ingredients together.  I also used the whole portion of cream cheese (I used an 8oz tub of whipped cream cheese), and used a whole 15oz jar of Bertolli Alfredo sauce.  I buy my fresh garlic weekly and grind it a bit in the food processor with a little bit of olive oil so I always have it on hand for cooking, so I couldn't roast my garlic in the oven.  Instead I took about 1 1/2 Tbsp of the chopped garlic and sauteed it on the stove in a teaspoon of olive oil until it just lightly browned.  This worked out perfectly and saved me about 20-30 minutes.  I also added about half a cup of cooked salad shrimp to the recipe since that is the dip I was looking for.  I served it with a loaf of baguette bread sliced up.  Last night was my first time making this dish, and it is already a family favorite.  This recipe definately rocks.

I made this and it was execellent! But here is a great idea for the leftovers (if there is any!) Make spinach and artichoke quesadillas! A place I used to work made these and I stole the idea for at home. Just make the dip like normal and spread it on a tortilla that has been buttered and cook it for a few mins on the stove, they are execellent, especially with Japs, bacon or chicken. Great for leftover dip.

I've made this recipe many times and I've never once had someone not ask me for the recipe. However, I do use bottled (marinated in oil) artichoke hearts instead of canned as I think they have more taste. An excellent and very easy to make dip!

This was AWESOME!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Tastes VERY much like the restaurant one I wanted to duplicate.  I did not use the refrigerated 10 ounce alfredo.  I used a 14 oz jar of alfredo, I used regular minced garlic right out of the jar, and I added a little extra parmesan, as I thought it needed more to get the flavor how I wanted it.  I dumped all the ingredients in a bowl, mixed them together and put it in a crock pot. This is definitely a KEEPER!  Thanks!

Update (the next day): we had leftovers of this dip the day after I made it, and it was very good! The flavors had a chance to blend. If I make it again, I might make it the day before and heat it up the day of serving. Here is the original review: Although the texture was creamy, I prefer more tang in an artichoke dip. The flavor was OK, but I will try another recipe next time.

Absolutely fantanstic! I served this with pita chips for a baby shower, and everyone raved about it! I used more of both parm. and motz. cheeses and the entire 8 oz. block of cream cheese. 
I used Bertolli Garlic Alfredo Sauce so I didn't add the garlic cloves.

The dip is wonderful, I have made it several times and every time I get rave reviews from others.  The dip taste just like the dip you when eating out.  I'm not a fan of mayo so when I found this recipe I knew I had to try it.  A+++++ :)

This disappeared very quickly when I served it and was a big hit.  I roasted and used more garlic than what it called for and was generous with the cheese quantities.  I also made sure I mixed the ingredients well and DID NOT layer it as the recipe suggested.  It makes a large portion but since it went so quickly, I will likely double it next time I make is for a get together.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I agree that it is an awful lot of work for 4 cloves of garlic so I just minced my garlic and added it to the mixture.  This was so creamy and smooth - love it!

This dip was fantastic and very easy to prepare. I served it a party and everyone was asking me for the recipe. I kept the recipe the same for the most part, but since I'm in Mexico, I had to use ingredients that are locally available. Instead of mozzarella cheese, I used Manchego cheese and I couldn't find plain alfredo sauce, so I used a sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce that was available, instead.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to put the spinach and artichokes into a food processor first so that the dip has a smoother texture.  Great dip, thanks for sharing it with us.

I have been serving this one for years.  I use this general recipe with a few revisions. I add 1 small jar marinated, chopped artichoke hearts, 1 teaspoon onion powder and use Monterey jack instead of Mozzerella cheese).  I also save the juice from the marinated artichoke hearts just in case the dip needs thinning.  I also serve it with vegetable "dippers"... I use a zig-zag slicer to cut a large carrot and zucchini into "coins" for a pretty, lower carb dipping option.  I served it while catering last week and got more business from it!  Tons of rave reviews!  (I have to be fair: 4 stars for this recipe, 5 stars for my version)

This is a tasty dip.  I've made it with the garlic roasted and also raw and it's good either way.  I found that roasting individual cloves of garlic the way it's described here can result in overdone "crunchy" garlic.   Better to roast an entire bulb of garlic (double wrapped in foil with a bit of olive oil) and have extra to spread on bread.   Finally, I sprinkle some extra cheese on top of it and bake for another few minutes - it's more attractive that way.

Great recipe!  I made this for a New Years Party and it was a big hit!!  I used a whole package of cream cheese instead of half (by mistake) and it was really creamy.  I also used minced garlic - I didn't roast it I just used it out of the jar and it was perfect.  30 min was not enough in the oven, I baked it for about 40 and then put it on broil for about 4 min to brown the top, also stirred it before browning the top. Very easy to make and very good! This recipe is a keeper!!

I make this dip whenever we have a party. The only thing I do differently is I use a jar of sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce. I bake the dip in the oven and then scoop it into a small crockpot and keep on warm throughout the party. It's great served w/ Triscuits & Wheat Thins. I'm always asked for this recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday party in August.  Since then, I have been to 11 family or friend get-to-gether's and I was told to not come unless I had the dip.  Usually it is gone within the first 30 min.  It is wonderful!

I thought this was pretty good. I did have a bit of a hard time squeezing the soft garlic out of the middle. I ended up just breaking the cloves in small pieces and adding them to the dip. I also used a blender, which made it easier. Of course this recipe doesnt compare to TGI Fridays and Applebees spinach artichoke dip, but overall it was pretty good.

YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS RECIPE!  I used all low fat cheeses and alfredo sauce without impacting the flavour in any way.  You're going to want to use the lower fat ingredients because you won't be able to stop eating this.  As one family member exclaimed upon returning to the buffet table: "Please someone get me away from this dip.  It's so good I can't help myself!"  Enjoy.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!!!  It all started with a bet with my boyfriend...a bet that I, a notorious dining-out/take-out queen, couldn't whip up anything edible in the kitchen.  I had him over for dinner last night and this blew his pants off!!!  He didn't even mind that I overcooked the chicken (whoops)...his focus was on the dip.  After finishing the entire bag of tortilla chips, he simply spread the dip on top of the chicken.  Of course, he doesn't believe that I made this from scratch (he thinks I ordered it) - so I have to make it AGAIN tonight while he is there!  

Thank you, TerraD, for posting this recipe.  And thank you to everyone who responded.  I took your advice and used the entire block of cream cheese, NON-MARINATED artichokes, added extra garlic (roasted and canned), and extra parmesan cheese.  I cooked covered in the oven for 30 mins, stirred, and then broiled for 10 minutes.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!  I can't wait to show this recipe off even more!  (Plus, he now has to buy me this necklace that I've wanted!)

This dip is delicious!!!  Here are the changes I made:  Used garlic in a jar, 2 cups of mozz. cheese, 1 cup parm. cheese, and 16oz jar classics roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  Kept the amount of spinach and artichokes the same.  I cooked it for 35 minutes covered, then for 5 minutes uncovered.  WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!

I liked the recipe. But I think next time I will substitute the cream cheese for sour cream, and I will use Monterey Jack Cheese for more flavor. Thanks for the recipe. Still searching for Cheddar's Restaurant--Sante Fe Spinach Dip...

Fantastic recipe TerraD! Everyone gobbled this up including all the kids! I made my own Alfredo sauce as the jarred is a bit too salty and I added a little spice just to jazz it up a bit. Thank you!

I wanted so much to like this recipe.  But unfortunately, it just wasn't anything like the really good artichoke & spinach recipes I've enjoyed at restaurants (especially Houston's). It just did not taste "homemade."  I think the alfredo sauce (I used the refrigerated kind) gave it an odd, pre-packaged, too creamy texture.

Everyone I have made this for LOVED this recipe. My husband, kids, inlaws, friends. My brother in law was eating it by the spoonful, he liked it so much. I use homemade alfredo, adding some more, otherwise it's a bit too thick. Also cut back some of the garlic. A GREAT recipe, especially if the thought of mayonnaise makes you wretch.

This is the best Spinach Artichoke dip I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  I find that if you are using a 9x9 pan, you need to cook it a little longer than 30 minutes.

20-30 mins was too much time in the oven for the garlic to roast...next time will finely chop the garlic.  The dip was great and even better the next day when reheated.  I served w/ nacho chips, but next time will serve it in a bread bowl with chips and breadsticks also.  Will definitely make again:)

I didn't bother to cook the garlic, instead I just added garlic powder which saved some time and effort. Everyone that tried it loved it, even those who said they hated spinach and artichokes! You should definitely make this if you want to be the most popular at a pot-luck!

I made this last night and it turned out great.  I loved it.  So creamy.  I wasn't thinking when making it and baked 4 garlic heads...not cloves but before scaring away any vampires I realized what I was doing and made it with 4 garlic cloves.  It turned out great and I hoarded it to myself.  I didn't want to share it was so good.  Next batch I will share.  ;-)

I made this for the first time when my Pastor and his wife came for dinner. We all loved it and they ended up taking the left-overs home with them...and asked me to make it for a church dinner on Sunday. I used the 16 oz jar of alfredo sauce with sun dried tomatos and the whole 8 oz of cream cheese then mixed it all together before baking. It came out wonderful!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe. Super easy. I used garlic seasoning instead of garlic & whole block of cream cheese. I also added pepper & paprika. I will make again! I also used Classico four cheese blend Alfredo. Update - my family loved it and they are already requesting that I make this again. I can't say anything other than awesome! Best recipe for quick and easy spinach & artichoke dip.

I used the whole bar of cream cheese. I also sauteed the garlic in olive oil before adding. It was creamy and just as good, or better, than any spinach dip I've tasted at restaurants. I used Bertolli Alfredo sauce. This recipe makes a lot of dip. Thanks for the recipe!

This really needs time to cool and set up. Straight out of the oven I found it to be slightly on the watery side. This is also rather salty, so I think this would be much better with a homemade or all-natural type brand of alfredo sauce. I made this for Super Bowl and I am certain no one will complain.

Haven't met anyone who doesn't LOVE this!
But I make my own Alfredo and just put the other ingredients into the sauce and then pop it into the oven. It's amazing!

I always get compliments on this dip. It's my go-to recipe. A few friends said it tastes like restaurant-quality dip - surprise! :)

Made this for our annual holiday party and it was a big hit. I will now add it to my menu every year. I cooked it in a small crock pot for it to stay warm as guests arrived. To the crock pot, I added Bertoli Roasted Garlic Alfredo (as another reviewer suggested) along with the mozzarella, Parmesan and cream cheeses (I used the entire 8oz of cream cheese). I finely chopped the spinach and artichokes. I then added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of garlic powder. My crock pot only as one setting so I started it one hour before the party and served with Stacys Simple Naked pita chips.

First time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  It was ok but I didn't really like the flavor the alfredo sauce (Bertolli) added.  Second time I made it I substituted heavy cream for the alfredo sauce and added a couple pinches of salt and my family devoured it, added benefit is that cream is better for you than jarred sauce.

It's a good start, but I had to add more cheese, a splash of hot sauce and onion powder to give it taste.

I thought it needed salt badly but maybe it's because I toasted French bread instead of using salted chips. Used the whole block,of cream cheese because what are you going to do with 1/2 a block of cream cheese?

I have been searching for the ultimate artichoke-spinach dip for years. This dip is good, and my guests thoroughly enjoyed it, but I felt it needed just a little more tastr. All the "right" ingredients are there and I used a high quality Alfredo sauce, but I think the addition of some garlic salt (along with the fresh garlic) would have brought out the flavors more. Thanks for the submission.

I have made this one many times. To make it healthier, I use reduced fat cream cheese, only 6 oz Alfredo sauce, and 50% more artichoke. My boyfriend said this made him feel guilty to eat or it felt too heavy with the original recipe, but with my changes it feels just right (he loves artichoke). I also shred blocks of both cheeses by hand and steam the spinach (not frozen spinach).

Amazing recipe!! Tastes even better than Applebee's.  Decided to make it for just me and the family tonight and it was a huge success!!! I can't wait to bring this to a family gathering! I substituted the garlic cloves for minced garlic and used the entire package of cream cheese.  Great recipe! Thank you for sharing!

This was a super easy recipe to make and tasted wonderful. I did make the adjustment someone suggested, I used a full brick of cream cheese and only half the jar of alfredo sauce.

Very good! Added a touch of basil. Consider adding little pieces of bacon to the top before baking. Serve with chicken & crackers to make this a side dish for a meal. YUM!

This a a good recipe, the Alfredo sauce really adds a lot of flavor and smooths out the dish, but I found that replacing sharp cheddar for the mozzarella, results in a better tasting dish and easier to scoop with chips or crackers.

One of the best Spinach dips I have ever made. I did use the refrigerated Alfredo sauce, a whole package of cream cheese and 2 cups of mozzarella. I roasted garlic but didn't have enough so I added some minched garlic and won't do that again only because I didn't like the pop it gives when eating but this is a keeper and I have already had co-workers asking me to print it up for them so they can also make it. Went into my recipe box! Yum!

AMAZING!!

This dish always gets rave reviews. I can't adequately convey how good it is. The only shortcut I take is to use minced garlic (not roasted) and use 8oz cream cheese instead of 4oz. Five stars!

I made this for a party last weekend and it was pretty darn good! I found it maybe just a little too rich and creamy, possibly because i didn't have quite enough spinach as called for. I'll make it again some time when i have a whole package of spinach on hand. Also I'll try it with a different brand of Alfredo sauce. But definitely will make it again.

I used the refrigerated Alfredo sauce and add extra shredded cheese. It made it very cheesy but it was very good. I will definitely make again. I put in a crock pot to cook and to keep it warm during the football game. I let it cook on low for 1 1/2 hours first.

Definitely use the full amount of alfredo sauce and the 8 oz of cream cheese. I added some vegetable seasoning (Knorr) that really gave it good flavor. This is better than what you get in restaurants!

I've tried a couple of dozen spinach artichoke dips over the last few years; and this is the one closet to a restaurants here that I love.  .It's important to roast the garlic.  I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese and added a little kick with some Tabasco sauce. The first time I left the artichokes to big and people picked them out.  Second time made sure they were chopped fine and it was perfect.  I also made my own Alfredo why ruin it with store bought junk...Â½ cup (1 stick) butter, 1 Â½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, 1 cup (8 oz) heavy cream (or more), Â¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, Â¼- Â½ tsp garlic powder, opt. Â¼- Â½ tsp ground black pepper, opt. Yummy  Serve with corn chips and a good bread. I made a triple batch and I also had to thin it out a few times during the party with more cream in the warmer to keep it the creamy texture I wanted. Don't layer just mix it all together...

I've made this recipe several times and it's perfect!  Tastes just like the restaurant's.  One time I forgot to put in the mozzarella cheese and it was still quite good but as a rule I would use it.

I thought this was a bit tasteless.  It is missing a tangy ingredient and I am not sure what it is.  I will update rating when I figure it out.

Wow! This dish is amazing! This is the best artichoke and spinach dip I've ever had! A few tips and alterations: roast an entire head of garlic (I know, but it's good) by cutting the top off, putting it on foil, pouring a little olive oil on, sealing it and baking it in the oven for about an hour on 200 degrees. After it's cooled, squeeze out the roasted garlic cloves and add that to the ingredients. Use two packages of spinach, two cans of artichoke hearts, two containers of Bertolli Alfredo sauce, add Romano cheese, and use the full 8 ounces of cream cheese. Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl, and then transfer the mixture to a baking dish. PERFECTION!

This is THEEEEE most amazing, restaurant-accurate cheese dip I have ever tasted!!! It always gets rave reviews when I bring it to parties, and I always bring home a spotlessly clean dish!! Absolutely delicious, no modifications required (except when I add all the ingredients to the baking dish, I mix them around a little instead of having them layered).

This is my go-to dip for parties and get togethers.  I've used the regular alfredo sauce in the past, but I like the garlic alfredo sauce the best.  Yesterday I made this in the slow cooker, and it turned out really well.  Cooked it on low for 3 hours, and turned the slow cooker to warm during the party, and it stayed hot for the next 4 hours.  Depending on how much time I have, I think I will be making it in the slow cooker from now on!

I used 12oz artichokes hearts (chopped), 8oz low fat cream cheese, a whole head of roasted garlic, and the rest of the ingredient as specified. Turned out amazing! Mine never got bubbly, but it was on the top rack above the Thanksgiving turkey. Still got all golden and gooey on the inside. My friends dubbed me the Queen of Dips. Obviously I will be making this many more times.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, not so much for me.  I made this for a gathering of friends.  They are all fans of spinach dip.  They LOVED it.  I used a reduced fat cream cheese and experimented with a roasted pepper cheese sauce.  It was good and had lots of flavor.  I served with melba toast and restaurant style tortilla chips.

This turned out really well.  The one thing I will change next time is to leave out the artichoke hearts.  I love artichoke hearts but they didn't really add much to this dip and they can be somewhat expensive.  All in all it was pretty yummy!

This recipe is amazing!! I use a little more mozzerella cheese to make it extra cheesy and use light cream cheese and light alfredo sauce. Everytime I make this people rave about it! Make sure to use real garlic and not powder.

This dip is really good but not the best i've ever had. Next time i'm going to use more of each of the cheeses (as another reviewer does) and see how that tastes.

YUM! I omit the cloves of garlic and instead use the Ragu Roasted Garlic Parmesan alfredo sauce. This recipe is very simple, and tastes amazing! I took my first batch to a party, and it was gone within 2 hours.

This is one of our favorites. I have also made it with chopped fresh spinach which I just blended in and baked without wilting. That worked very good. The last time I made this I used a shredded Italian blend for the full amount of cheese and some liked it better saying it was "better than the usual saltiness".

More Please! This recipe was the bomb! I made it Sunday for the Giants Game and the crowd actually moved their chairs closer to cocktail table for easy access to the dip.  After a while, one guest got up and said, "I have to walk away, walk away!" Try this recipe, it's a crowd pleaser. I had no troubles making it...at all.

Used Paul Newman's garlic Alfaredo sauce and it enhanced the garlic flavor.  Also used 8 oz of cream cheese and some half and half to thin the mixture.  I spread the garlic on the bottom of the baking dish, but mixed all the remaining ingredients together and spread on top of garlic.  Took to a NY open house and it was well received.

Just tried this for New Year's Eve.  I didn't have fresh garlic so I followed the recommendation from a previous review and used garlic powder-probably would be better with fresh but still tasted great.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Definitely a keeper.

Okay...only had a taster prior to the guests arriving and "oh my" is all I can say..I added extra garlic, but everything else was prepared as written...this is a new favorite!  Next time I'm going to kick it up a bit with some minced jalapeno :-)

I love garlic, but be careful with the garlic in this recipe. It is very pungent. I had to make a second batch and leave out the garlic completely the 2nd one. Then combine the two to tone down the garlic. If I would've had the ingredients to add a 3rd batch (without garlic), I would've. It was that intense of a flavor. Other than that, I loved it!

This one does taste like applebees!!! YAY. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using garlic powder for the roasted garlic, to save myself time. I also used Classico roasted garlic afredo sauce, and only 1 cup mozzarella. Soooo good!!!!

One of my go-to's when entertaining!  The only thing I do differently is add the whole package of cream cheese as others have suggested.

This dip is so, so so, so yummy! I have tried to tweak it by adding an entire package of cream cheese and less Alfredo sauce, but I like it "as is" best, maybe with one extra clove of garlic only because I love garlic. But I suggest you try the recipe verbatim at first because it really is delicious. It's become "my thing" and is known as my "famous artichoke dip" around our house!

I followed this recipe exactly except I did double the cream cheese per other reviewers' suggestions.  While it was good, it was not the exact consistency or taste I was looking for.  I think it was the alfredo sauce.

We LOVE this dip.  WE as in my family and cowokers for myself anf my spouse and the kids at school.  I roast  the garlic and a handful of shallots al drizzled in olive oil. I give them a whirl i processor before adding.  I also use refrigerated Bertolli because it has a better flavor.   I added  3 Tbs chopped water chestnuts andI use 2 c. moz cheese and 8oz cream cheese.  I leave the rest as is.  I mix it all together then spread it in a pan to bake/toast, serve it in a bread bowl and top with French's fried onions for aesthetics.  I t is dreamy delicious good and I have tried NUMEROUS recipes for this dip.  We like tortilla chips and pita chips wihit the most!

This was a really good recipe. I'm a seasoning junkie, so I felt that it could use more seasonings to add more flavor. I used the whole jar of Bertolli Alfredo sauce and also added some cajun seasoning, garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlin & some onion powder. I definitely plan to make this again maybe trying a richer alfredo sauce and/or garlic and herb cream cheese. Great recipe though!

This is a great recipe but I wouldn't exactly call it restaurant quality. It seemed to lack something and I can't quite put my finger on what it is yet. It was still a hit none the less and I will continue to make this recipe and adjust it to my own taste until it "feels" right. It could be as simple as using higher quality ingredients. Just a note to those of you using a crockpot, use a cooking spray before pouring in your ingredients. Also, I had to put my crockpot on high for about maybe an hour before the consistency was just right. When I first tried it (20 min. into heating) it was stringy instead of creamy. I was worried I had done something wrong and it wouldn't turn out for the party I needed to bring it to. So make sure you give yourself just a little time before serving this. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight for a group of friends.  Followed the recipe exactly except for I used minced garlic from a jar instead of roasting it (was short on time).  Decided to serve it in a bread bowl and it was a HUGE hit!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  Can't wait to make it for another gathering!

I didn't have time to roast it so I just did 2 cloves of fresh garlic. Other than that I followed the recipe. I thought it looked too dry when I mixed it, but it is very cheesy. I served it with baguette slices and tortilla chips. Next time I might try adding some red pepper flakes for some heat.

This was very good however it was a little too rich for my liking, i suggest cutting back on the Alfredo sauce and then using the entire thing of cream cheese, i did this the second time and it came out much better!

I tried other Artichoke and Spinach recipes, but none of them have ever turned out as creamy and Yummy as this one.  I made this during deer hunting this winter for a bunch of men.  They devoured it and I even had one of them ask me for the recipe!  I followed another suggestion using a whole package of cream cheese and Bertolli alfredo sauce.  YUM YUM!

4-1/2 stars!  Followed the recipe to a "T" except for added a bit of shredded mozz. cheese on top before baking.  It was very good.  Served with "Perfect Pita Chips" recipe from AR.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe - reminds me of the dip I get with my 2 for $20 meal :-) i used a whole block of cream cheese and a 15 oz jar of Alfredo. also, I baked this for 30 min covered and then 45 min more uncovered to brown it up! diced tomatoes compliment this VERY well.

This was awesome.  I served it for a ladies luncheon and everyone wanted the recipe!  I added a 1/2 cup more mozzarella cheese.  Next time I will try adding garlic powder instead of having to roast garlic.  Great dip!  A must try!

This is good, but a bit salty for my taste. Everyone else seemed to enjoy it. Next time I will make my own alfredo sauce instead of the salty store bought kind.

Alfredo is the right way to make the sauce.  I thought there was too much spinach in the original recipe.  I'd halve the spinach and keep everything else the same.

Amazing! Made this for New Year's and it went so fast!! My boyfriend didn't want to try it because he doesn't like artichokes, but I made him try it and he loved it! 
I like this recipe because most recipes call for mayonnaise, which I think is gross.. This recipe is perfect.  Although I did add the whole 8 oz. of cream cheese, instead of half.  Love it!

My dip is a little watery, but I think that's because all of my calculations were off. :/ I sent someone else to get the ingredients and my measurements were off as a result. I was low on spinach so I think that was the culprit. Other than that, the flavor was great! I think next time I'll roast more garlic, 4 gloves just didn't seem enough for my taste.

***The day after the party I had some dip left, so I took some chilled crescent rolls and put the remaining dip inside. They were excellent! Just roll them up and back them and 375 for about 25-20 minutes.

This was the first time I ever made this type of dip. It was simple and easy, and it turned out really good even though I am a beginner, showing that it really is easy.
I would definatly make this again. Both my parents enjoyed it along with me and they say they would love to eat it again.

Great recipe!!! I did cut back on the garlic and made a few other changes. I used 1 tsp of minced garlic, 1c of Italian cheese blend, 1/2c of mozzarella cheese, and 1/4c of mayo along with the other ingredients listed. LOVED IT!

This was good but next time ill use the whole cream cheese container and ill look for fresh artichokes. I used the can version and it was still good but it could be better plus I was leery to use garlic ( I put a little of the jar version in) and I think it would have been the added touch. I served it with cracker

This dip is by far the BEST spiniach dip I've ever had! For holidays/parties I usually get stuck making a cold version with sour cream and mayo, but this year I wanted something different. The alfredo sauce really scared me and I actually saved this but kept looking. Boy am I glad I came back to this one! Everyone devoured it, saying it was the best they've ever had! I did use a full pack of cream cheese according to reviews and also not so much artichoke (preference), and Im a garlic lover so I used 6-7 cloves. Layering? Um I just mushed it all up :) & if you dont have time to roast the garlic, like my second time around, don't worry it still tastes delicious! All in all dont be afraid to try this unique recipe! You won't be sorry!!

I make this for all special occasions, Instead of the garlic cloves I use garlic alfredo sauce and fat free cream cheese. I also serve this on top of grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes for a full meal.

The addition of Alfredo wasn't a hit - prefer the regular cheese version.  Perhaps it was the type of Alfredo we used.

I didn't like this recipe at all. I really thought it would have that stringy/cheesy texture like the restaurants but it was really greasy and smelled that way. Very heavy, no one liked it. Sorry... The picture looks so much better than when it is actually made.

I liked this recipe. I did change some things according to other reviews, I used the 15oz jar of alfredo sauce, bertolli and i used 1/2 cup of parm cheese. Also I used the whole 8oz pack of cream cheese. I mixed all the ingrediants together before adding them to my pan. My husband didnt like it at all he said way to much artichoke. Next time I will use 1/2 the can of artichoke and rinse it really well before hand.Also I will try to chop up the artichoke a little better. It also needs some salt and pepper to taste.All and all I liked it, tasted sort of like cheddars. Oh and I also added some tomatoes to my bowl of dip to  make it extra good. Im going to make it again for Christmas with my few adjustments. Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious and just as good as in the restaurants. This is probably self-explanatory, I used the equivalent of roasted garlic in the jarred garlic and it was a little strong. If using garlic in a jar, try it with just 3 cloves worth. Great recipe.

I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe, except I mixed all of the ingredients together before putting it in the oven. It tasted pretty bland to me because of the jarred alfredo sauce. The next time, I prepared one package of the McCormick garlic alfredo sauce. It became the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had. I would recommend either using the McCormick package or making your own alfredo sauce. Definitely make sure to mix everything together before you bake it.

I just made this dish tonight and WOW--it was a hit. In fact I already had a request to bring it to the next party. I took a small shortcut by purchasing roasted garlic from the antipasto bar at my local grocery store. I doubled the garlic because they seemed less potent. I also used the full 8oz of cream cheese per other reviews advice. It was perfect and I'm glad to have this in my back pocket for future events.

Only gave this 4 stars as without tweaking it would have been a cheesy mess. I used 3 pkgs spinach dip and 1 whole pkg of cream cheese. Also used more garlic and roasted the garlic first. Got raves from everyone at work and when I told one person how I made it she said hers probably didn't come out as good because it didn't have enough spinach. I'm pretty sure the alfredo sauce I used was also a 15oz jar and it was Bertolli brand from reading some other reviews. I've already made this several times and it is totally awesome.

My boyfriend loves spinach and artichoke dip from restaurants - especially Olive Garden. After he tried this recipe, he said it was better than Olive Garden's!  I made a couple of changes... I used the whole jar of alfredo pasta sauce (Bertolli) and 1.5 cups of mozzarella cheese. I also used garlic powder to make it faster/easier.

I made this for a family gathering.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I followed the suggestions of some reviewers & used refrigerated alfredo sauce, 1/2 cup parmesan and the entire 8-0z. package of cream cheese.  I drained the spinach & pressed out the remaining liquid.  The flavor was good but not as pronounced as I would have preferred so I'll reduce the cream cheese to the original amount next time.  I added 3 Tbs. milk since the mixture seemed too thick.  I'll leave the extra spinach liquid when I make it again.

I really expected a "wow" recipe after reading many of the positive reviews.  Sorry to say, this dip was mostly bland and expensive to make.  I love a good artichoke and spinach dip, but my easy-to-please guests barely touched this one.

Everyone I have made this dip for has absolutely LOVED it!!! I make it for my family about once a month, sometimes more. I mix in garlic powder in with all the other ingredients instead of baking it before hand. I also us the 4 cheese sauce found in the spaghetti isle instead of the alfredo. I also use about 2 cups of mozzarella and about a cup of the parmesan. IWe use the tortilla scoops for easy dipping. It turns out into the best dip ever!!!

I've made this about 8 times in 3 months.  It's great and everyone who's ever tried it wants me to make it every time they come to visit.  I'm quite sick of it now in a good way of course. I also use spinach and artichoke cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese, and one time I used the chive cream cheese but it wasn't as good that time.  I'm sure it's just as great with regular though.

I used the entire 15 oz jar of Bertoli Roasted Garlic Alfredo and some extra cheese. I also added finely chopped red pepper, which looked pretty as well as tasting good! I didn't have any fresh garlic in the house so I used garlic powder and that worked out great. Really tasty dip!

Fantastic!  I didn't roast the garlic...used minced instead to cut down on the time.  Heated the frozen chopped spinach in the microwave for about 5 minutes then drained rather than waiting on it to thaw.  Garnished w/ red pepper.  Served w/ Wheat Thin rosemary seasoned crackers.  Will definitely make this again.

I used the whole package of cream cheese (after reading other reviews) and left out the parmesan cheese (I didn't have any). And the garlic I sauteed instead of putting it in the oven. Everyone ate it up. It was so yummy!! Definately going to make this again!

I literally signed up for this site just so I could review this recipe.  It is awesome!!  I followed the recipe quantities exactly.  I added some salt and pepper to taste and heated it up on the stove and then put it in a crock pot.    I think some people thought it was bland because they didn't add salt and pepper which the recipe doesn't call for, but i'm sure helps :).    I made a double batch for a party and it was gone in 2hrs.  Tastes just like restaurant style.

I made this recipe today for my friend's baby shower.  It was a hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe after gobbling up all of the spinach dip.  I made it with a whole bar of cream cheese, bartolli Alfredo sauce, and I roasted the garlic.  Someone that made this before me, wrote that they did that and the spinach dip was amazing. This recipe was very easy to make, and it is a definite keeper.

I made this for a cookout and everyone really liked it.  I too thought it was too bland when I tasted it before I baked it so I did add salt and some fresh cracked pepper.  Also I used a whole head of roasted garlic instead of just a couple of cloves.

I agree with previous reviews that this dip was way too bland.  The next day, my husband and I pulled it out of the fridge, zapped in the microwave, stirred in a bit of onion and garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and it was a million times better.  I think if I had used an alfredo sauce that had garlic flavor already or marinated artichoke hearts it would have helped, but honestly, it needed the salt more than anything.  My husband agreed that it lacked something to be desired.  So with a little doctoring, it's pretty good.  But definitely not the best I've ever had.  I would suggest adding about a 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and at least a 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powder before baking.  I also added a little pimento on top before baking and it added a little color and flavor.

I made this recipe for a dinner @ work.  It was wonderful! I added a small amount of olive oil & I didn't really go by the recipe for the amounts of cheese - I just added to taste.  Also, since I wanted the dip to stay warm for awhile, I made it in a crock pot & kept it on low for the majority of the dinner.  It was amazing! Will definatly make again.

My favorite thing to eat is spinach & artichoke dip and this recipe is one of my favorites to use!  The only thing I do differently is I used minced garlic instead of roasting the whole cloves.  Try it with Pita chips, that's my favortie! :)

Really great recipe - the only thing I suggest is making it the day ahead, bake then refrigerate and then reheating before serving.  The flavors meld so much more after a day of sitting.

I was trying to come up with a good spinach artichoke dip that I could make ahead and reheat for my daughters graduation party. After reviewing other comments and recipes, this is what I came up with. I added 8 slices of bacon (per my daughters request), a whole brick of cream cheese and a whole jar of alfredo. I think using the whole jar of alfredo is the key to reheating it and having it remain creamy.  I think I gained about 2 lbs testing it!! So easy and so good.

This really  is good.  I  could only find slightly larger cans of artichokes and pasta sauce so  I   increased the  garlic and cheese a bit too to compensate. But  otherwise remained the same. Easy and good. My toddler even  liked  it!

Crock Pot Question:  Just so you know, I did make this the 2nd time in a crock pot and it is just as tasty!  I too put in roasted minced garlic I bought in a jar in a grocery store and a little bit of seasoning salt, fresh ground pepper, a few dashes of cayenne pepper and liquid smoke to add more flavor.  The only negative thing about making it in a crock pot is you don't have the crunchy top the oven does, but who cares when the first people to devour it eats all that anyways. =)

Delicious!! I used store bought garlic(4tsp) and the whole pkg. cream cheese.  I mixed all ingredients together rather than spreading them.  Next time I am going to add water chestnuts.  Restaurant quality for sure!!

The first time I made this, I didn't find it creamy enough like the ones a restaurants... so I added a heck of a lot more alfredo sauce (homemade) and it turned out AMAZING the second time!! Oh, and more garlic. :)

Tasty - a big hit at our holiday potluck! I baked in the oven, then the following morning I put it in a small crockpot. It disappeared in the first 15 minutes of our potluck...would probably do a double-batch for a potluck... Served with purchased pita chips.

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone devoured it! Since I had some picky eaters coming, I skipped out on the roasted garlic and used a sauce mix for garlic alfredo sauce instead. I also doubled the recipe by simply doubling the amount of spinach and cream cheese. I was afraid it might need more cheese or additional alfredo, but it ended up just  fine! It was a big hit! I made it in the oven and served it in a mini crock pot that was made for keeping hot dips warm. I left the rest in the oven (with the oven off) and refilled throughout the night. I was surprised how popular it was. I served it with toasted French bread and tortilla chips as well. Even the picky eaters said it was their absolute favorite! Can't wait to make again!

This was very good...just like the restaurants.  Only suggestion is to use a little less garlic.

I brought this to work for a treat.  I usually like spinach/artichoke dip, but this recipe just didn't cut it.  My co-workers said it was OK, but I ended up throwing most of it out at the end of the day.  I won't be making this again.

This was actually better than a lot of restaurants. Made it for a poker night and it disappeared pretty fast! 
It was a little thicker than I would normally like, but still absolutely delicious. Maybe next time I will toss in a little sour cream just for a creamier consistency.

This is the best artichoke/spinach dip I have ever had and it is very easy to make!!  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering.  I used a jar of alfredo sauce instead of the refrigerated sauce.  It turns out great every time.  EXCELLENT!!

What a yummy dip! I have used this recipe for multiple parties and it always goes over well. I like to add some chopped bacon pieces into the dip and a little extra cheese.

Everyone loved this recipe. I did add an extra package of spinach because a full can of artichokes looked like alot and I used a whole jar (16oz.) of alfredo sauce. It does make alot and that's fine with us.

This recipe is very good, I followed it pretty much to a "t" (didn't drain the spinach and am glad b/c it provided enough liquid that this was scoopable and spreadable) and received many compliments and comments such as "this is better than what we find in restaurants"... so it does live up to it's name. I, however, felt it was lacking that special something... perhaps onion? Red pepper flakes? It wasn't as zippy as I like. I used Bertollini (sp?) alfredo sauce, roasted the garlic even though I don't think that's necessary, and sprinkled a little extra mozz on top--also unnecessary. Overall a real crowd pleaser.

OMG...WOW this was amazing.  My whole family loved it.  I have a picky 22 month old and she was just eating the dip with no chips.  I used garlic alfredo sauce and probably a little extra mozzarella...but its better than the restaurants.

This is a great recipe.  I only added a few things that our local restaurant has in theirs.  A can of chopped waterchestnuts and I put 1/4 cup buffalo sauce. We like ours with a bit of a kick.  Goes fast at parties and a great carry in with chips.

Always a hit - the only change I make is to mix all the ingredients together instead of layering it.  That's just too much of a bother for something that adds so little an impact.

I took leftovers of this to a party and my friends thought it was  much better than they had tasted in restaurants. They all requested the recipe and wanted me to make it again. I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen pre-packaged. It took a little extra chopping but I think it was well worth it.

This dip is totally AWESOME!!  I have made it a few times now, and it is always a HIT!!  I too used the bertolli's alfredo sauce, and nuked the cream cheese in the microwave for easier mixing. Will definitely continue to make!

I am a huge fan of creamy spinach dip and this recipe definitely delivered!  I cut the spinach amount in half.  Used 16 oz of Alfredo sauce, 1 1/2 cups Mozzarella, and a whole package of cream cheese. I had to put it in a 9x13 pan but it is still great heated up as leftovers.  Also garnish with fresh chopped tomatoes right before serving...YUMMY!

Good but I agree with with others that the flavor of the alfrdo comes through too much.  However, I used a jarred alfredo and I have never really cared for them.  I thought the other flavors would make it better.  I would make this again but either make my own alfredo or use the kind in the refridgerated section of the market that I like to begin with.

For those complaints regarding flavor, use flavored cream cheese; either the garlic and onion flavored cream cheese or the vegetable-garden flavored cream cheese.  I always substitute one of those and I also use the whole container of cream cheese. I will also substitute and use "light" products to try and help the calorie count! I also serve it with vegetables (carrots, celery, red, yellow or orange pepper strips, brocolli.) No other complaints, it is a richer appetizer, but non one complains!   I LOVE the ease of it, and the ability to pre make and put in fridge or freezer.

I have been trying to find an artichoke and spinach dip that tasted similar to what I've tasted at a local restaurant.  FINALLY, I have found it!  I was blown away by this one - it is amazing and quite easy!  I will definitely be using this recipe often!

I thought this was great.  I added water chestnuts and roasted red bell peppers to add some crunch and color. Next time I think I will add some bacon per another suggestion - maybe add a tiny bit more flavor. But all in all wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!!

I thought this was real good. We used fresh spinach instead of frozen and one can of Rotel mild. I used the pasta sauce with garlic so I omitted the fresh garlic. I also used the food processor to blend everything. We served it with pita flavored chips and bagel chips.

this recipe was oustanding! I was  little thrown by the 10oz of alfredo sauce but it was good. I felt it was a little runny at first but as it cooled it thickened. Next time I think I would use a little less of the sauce, a little more parm cheese and maybe a little fontina would be good. I have a friend that puts sauteed red onions in her dip and I really like that too.
But this recipe was great as is-I couldn't stop eating it!

We loved it!! I did make some changes, 1st was 1 whole stick of cream cheese, 2nd 14 oz of spinach (Frozen) and 3rd 
2 lbs. of crab meat. IT was so good. I'm glad we did the crab meat. We had it in the crock pot for 12 hours and it stayed very good. Like other recipes food can get hard and crispy NOT this one. We can't wait to make it again.....

I thought this recipe was delicious!  I'm incredibly picky and I really liked it.  I used a full jar of alfredo sauce and less artichokes than it called for and it turned out to be SO good!  My boyfriend brought it for a pot luck at work and they ate it all immediately!  Great recipe!!!!

I have made a few Artichoke/Spinach dips in the past, but this is my favorite. Like others, I always use the whole 8 ounces of cream cheese and I don't bother roasting the garlic. I had an amazing cook beg for the recipe which is always a good sign.

I was looking for a recipe that could match what I found in our favorite restaurant, this did it!  I use half of a can of quartered artichoke hearts (chopped after taking them out), and pre minced garlic.

Excellent recipe! It did have more flavor than the applebees version...I'd say it's just cheesier. I doubled the recipe except the garlic and I used jarred minced garlic to save on time. I also left out the parmesan and used Bortelli's Garlic and parmesan alfredo...it was great and the re-heated leftovers are wonderful!

Great recipe!  So easy and delicious!  Since it was my first time making this, I mixed it all in a bowl and microwaved it, just to check the flavor before I baked it, and I realized that it's delicious microwaved!  I took everyone's advice and added the whole block of cream cheese.  Also, I used Bertolli Roasted Garlic Alfredo (the whole jar) PLUS 4-5 cloves roasted, mashed garlic, 1 C Mozzarella, 1 C parmesan, 1 1/4 Cups Cabot sharp white cheddar (the cheddar really sharpened it up; it was a little flat before), 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp black pepper.  I also microwaved the frozen spinach first, then squeezed out all the extra water.  The only other thing that was different was that I thinned the dip with milk, maybe 2 - 3 cups.  It was too stretchy and goopy without it.  Then again, I added a lot of extra cheese!

This is my favorite spin dip recipe!  I tend to just throw amounts together now, but its so easy and turns out perfectly every time!  The alfredo sauce is a must for giving it that creamy consistency that can stand up to a chip!  Thanks for sharing!

This is really good and so easy. I like to serve it with baguette bread that I brush with olive oil and garlic, sprinkle with parmesan cheese and lightly toast in the oven.

AMAZING recipe.

I made this for a family get together and it was a hit. Everyone LOVED it!  I thought it was easy to prepare and did as others suggested by using the whole block of cream cheese.  The last 5 minutes of baking, I topped it with finely shredded mozarella and parmesean chs, but it would have been delicious the way the recipe called.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.

I used a whole jar of alfredo sauce and the entire block of cream cheese.  I also used the entire bag of mozz. cheese. It turned out great. It was gobbled up! I will definitely use this again.

I loved this recipe, it was so easy and delicious!  My boyfriend and I don't like artichokes, so we put in extra spinach.  We used light alfredo sauce, light cream cheese, and italian blend cheese . We ate it with store bought pita chips, they were ok, next time we'll eat it with pieces of fried tortillas. I can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely wonderful.  I too used the whole package of cream cheese and most of the bottle of alfredo.  I added a little more spinach, and chopped the artichokes in a food processor for a smoother texture. This dip is a huge hit!!  Use a 9x9 pan to heat the dip quicker and more evenly.

Very delicious, and easy to make. I would however add salt (to taste) to the recipe unless you are serving with heavily salted chips or crackers.

Delicious, everyone loves it.  I usually double the cream cheese and use only half a jar of alfredo. and sometimes i double the spinach too.

Really good recipe! I used 2 cans of artichokes instead of one. I also used a whole 15oz jar of alfredo sauce and entire 8oz block of cream cheese.  I increased the roasted garlic to 8 cloves. Instead of using a food processor(didn't feel like cleaning all the parts), I microwaved the alfredo sauce and cream cheese and stirred them until smooth then added the cheeses and at the end added the artichokes and spinach. Thanks a lot for posting this.

I made this dip using the suggestions given (used the whole pkg of cream cheese, and extra mozzarella and parmesan) but I think that took away from the dip.  It was bland and seemed to lack something.  If i try it again, I will go strictly by the recipe.

Wow!  This is better than any restaraunt I've been to!  I did make a few changes per previous reviews .... I used 2 cups mozz. cheese, 1/2 cup fresh parm. cheese, and the whole package of cream cheese.  Cheese, cheese and more cheese!!!  Don't hesitate to make the full recipe, trust me it will get eaten.  There were 6 of us and not a drop left.  Yummy!  This is my new favorite thing to take to parties.  Thanks soooo much for sharing!

We really enjoyed this. It tasted better than restaurant dip. I put my spinach, roasted garlic, and artichokes in the food processor because I don't like the chunks. It gives it a great texture. I mix everything in my stand mixer to eliminate cream cheesy clumps. I also followed the advice of some other reviewers and used all of the cream cheese and Alfredo sauce. I use Garlic Alfredo to give it a little extra flavor. (Since my original review, I've gotten lazy. I don't roast the garlic anymore and notice no difference.)    I make this pretty often. I have taken it to several parties and gotten tons of compliments on it. It usually doesn't last more than 10 minutes!   I had to update: I have had at least 6 people ask for this recipe. It's such a huge hit! People request this ALL the time. I've taken to doubling the recipe because I know one batch just isn't enough!

This dip is even better than any I have had in any restaurant. I don't even order it when eating out any more because I know it will not measure up to what I can make at home. I use the entire bar of cream cheese, italian blend cheese rather than just mozzarella and when in a time crunch I just add minced garlic rather than roasting the garlic. I do the like the roasted garlic flavor better but when in a time crunch the minced works great. I also heat the cream cheese a little to make it blend better. My favorite way to serve it is with tortilla chips or on crunchy baguette pieces

This was pretty good.  We reduced the amount of Alfredo sauce by a little bit, and used the full amount of cream cheese.  We also added some cheese to the top about 5 minutes before it was done cooking.  It was very yummy!

This was very good & tasted like it came from a restaurant. I used 4 t minced garlic instead of doing the whole roasting cloves of garlic thing, used creamed spinache & the whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese. I bought the Bertolli brand of alfredo sauce. I mixed everything together in a bowl before putting it in the baking dish. I served it with bread cubes, baby carrots & tortilla chips. Thanks.

I've made this recipe twice now and it has completely disappeared both times. The only change I made was that I mixed in 1/2 tsp. garlic powder instead of roasting garlic. That and I didn't read the directions correctly and mixed everything together in a bowl before baking instead of layering. I served it in a bread bowl and even the bowl got eaten!

Very successful, and well liked.  I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit.  I took the advice of other reviewers and lessened the amount of alfredo sauce, and increased the amount of mozzerella cheese and cream cheese.  It was delicous.  This is a keeper, as I know that I will make it over and over again.  Did I mention that its easy to make?

This artichoke and spinach dip is wonderful!  Everyone said it was the best homemade dip they had ever had. I would definately recommend this recipe.

Excellant dip!!! I made one mistake by following other reviewers recommendations to add a little cheddar and the cheddar taste overpowered the other cheeses (I didn't add that much either, just a few slivers). I would advise against adding cheddar and its perfect! I used Ragu Garlic Alfredo which was perfect. I cooked mine in a mini-crock for dips and also added a little milk after cooking to make it creamier.

Use the whole package of cream cheese and add some extra mozzarella on top.  And I always increase the garlic. Buy higher-quality artichokes because it can really make a difference.  Serve with pita triangles and/or bagel chips.

Brought it to a potluck and everyone loved it. Extremely easy - we added a bit more cheese and alfredo. Great with tortilla chips or slices of italian bread.

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner and it dissappeared so fast I only got one little scoop of it!  It was super easy & everyone was raving.  I too used the whole block of cream cheese, regular (not roasted) minced garlic (from the jar), and mixed it all up instead of layering.  I did use real, freshly grated parmesean and you could definetly taste it (in a good way!).  Will definetly be making this again - next time I may use an italian blend of grated cheese instead of just mozzarella.

I made this last night to take to a dinner with several other couples. Everyone really enjoyed it!  Like others recommended, I used the entire 8oz of Neufchatel cheese, 2 cups of part-skim mozzarella, and jarred roasted minced garlic. Very fast and YUMMY!!!! This is my new reciple for Spin Dip!!!

I have tried a few artichoke dips and this is the BEST one I've had.  Most call for mayo and this one uses the alfredo sauce which I love.  It freezes very well so I always have one on hand for unexpected company.

this sauce is delicious! though you don't want to leave it in the oven too long, cause it will get too thick.

This is easy and very yummy! I read a majority of the reviews and made the following recommended adjustments: roasted the garlic (used 5 cloves instead of 4), used a garlic flavored alfredo sauce, as well as the entire package of cream cheese, added 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 1 cup colby, jack, and monterey cheese mix and then used a hand mixer to mix it all together before baking. It was a big hit at the party (got a lot of requests for the recipe) but my husband thought it was almost too garlic-ey (and he likes garlic!) but that may have been because my sister-in-law served garlic pita chips with the dip. I didn't think the garlic was overwhelming but next time I may just use 4 cloves of garlic and try a regular alfredo mix. Overall I was very happy with the way it turned out and will definitely make it again (it makes quite a bit, by the way).

Fabulous recipe!!!  I also used the whole package of cream cheese & it turned out perfect!  I mixed everything together (I used the powder looking parmesan cheese in the mix & sprinkled shredded parmesan on top) & then broiled it for a few minutes at the end. We had a UFC fight night get together & all the guys would not leave the spot where it was! Served with fresh toasted baquette bread.  Yummmmmm!!!

Very good.  The only thing I did different was used the already diced garlic and that took away.  I'm sure real roasted garlic makes it wonderful.  Also, watch the brand of alfredo sauce.  That makes a huge difference also.  Thank you again for the recipe.

I came across the printed version of this recipe and realized that this is where I got it.  I made this as an appetizer for my wedding guests 4 years ago.  Although it was very good, I didn't care for the flavor of the alfredo.  I used DiGiorno from the refrigerated section.  The alfredo flavor was a bit too much for me but others raved over it.  I served it with toasted bagel chips and garlic flavor pita chips.  A great party recipe but I would try another brand of alfredo sauce if I made it again.

Ok, I'm not sure what went wrong but mine came out pretty bad. I halved the recipe. I used minced garlic, chopped spinach, artichoke hearts, alfredo sauce, shredded cheese (a mixture of white cheeses), parmesan and cream cheese. I had to bake it a little longer than what the recipe called for. Just wasn't good.

This was absolutely wonderful. My family gave this 5 stars. This is a recipe that I will definitely be making again. The only thing different I did was use the whole pkg of cream cheese, add a little cayenne pepper, and crumbled some bacon on top. Delicious on some fresh parmesan french bread! Thanks for sharing.

My friends request this at every party we attend now.  I make it with 10oz. of Alfredo (one entire regular size jar) which makes it extra creamy.  I also stir it half way through cooking because the center doesn't heat rapidly.

WOW!!! I made this several times over the past few weeks. SOME TWEEKS: definitely the roasted garlic flavored alfredo (much easier). Layer and broil for a minute (for presentation) or don't (not as pretty). Bread is best to dip. Thanks! Improve your social life...you'll be a welcome guest anywhere with this recipe!

This was a really good recipe.I made this for a  Christmas Eve party at our house. I read the feedback and also mixed everything together before I baked it. Also, I used a whole jar of Ragu Alfredo sauce,and the whole package of cream cheese.Also, I used 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese with adding some on top before baking.I didn't have cloves of garlic so I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, it worked out great.  Thanks for sharing

This was soooo tasty!! Everyone loves it!!  I used fresh spinich instead of frozen, and marinated artichokes.  Also used Neufatchel Cheese instead of cream cheese.  Amazing.  Only problem, was that I had a little fight with the pood processor, and 6 stitches later I still want some more of the dip;-)

Made this for a party and put it in a crockpot to keep it warm after baking. I mixed everything together instead of layering. It was a hit! Everyone loved it with tortilla chips.

This was absolutely delicious.  Like other reviews suggested, I used extra parm and mozzarella.  I also substituted a whole container of whipped garlic & herb cream cheese, and I added a tsp. of garlic salt.  It was wonderful right out of the oven as well as the next day!

I used 6oz goat cheese, instead of the 8oz cream cheese since that is what we prefer, and it was heavenly.  Since there was two eating instead of 12, I put it into three smaller baking dishes and froze two for later use.  They thawed and baked up really well.  Update: I made it with 8oz cream cheese for a pot luck where I knew goat cheese wouldn't go over, it was a huge hit

Delish! Added a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper and several twists of fresh ground pepper...VERY GOOD! Also, don't attempt to use canned spinach. There is a HUGE difference, as I learned recently.

I have made this recipe several times and every time its gone in no time. Guests always rave about it. I see that some complain that the dip is "runny". Make sure to always spin the spinich until its almost dry.I have also wraped the dip (before cooking) in puff pastry and it was delicious (if you do this be sure to brush pastri with egg yoke on outside befroe cooking) Very good thank you for sharing.

This is the bomb!  Everyone whom I have served it to has asked for the recipe. Make sure to SQUEEZE the water out of the spinach. The baked garlic & alfredo are the keys!  Thanks!

I served this dip at a cocktail party and my friends just raved about it.  I also included some sun-dried tomatoes to add color and a different flavor; it just made it better!  I served it with Triscuits but rye bread is great too.

I have tried 3-4 diffenrent recipes. This is THE ONE!  Roasted garlic is a must and alfredo makes it creamy like restaurant style. I could eat the whole bowl myself!! Use either marinated or plain Artichokes both yummy.

I loved this recipe! It's definitely going to become a regular at our house. This was so much better than the restaurant versions I've tried! (Hint: I used the garlic/parmesean flavored alfredo sauce. Also, I made it in the microwave, and it turned out just fine.)

Actually pretty good....the only complaint that we had was that it was a little bit thin.  Next time I will have to find a way to make the sauce a bit thicker.  Thanks for posting.

I thought that this dip was delicious. Other spinch dip recipes that I have tried called for sour cream, which gave the dip a too tangy taste. The alfedo was wonderful. I used half the alfredo and all the cream cheese I also added seasoned salt, pepper, and 16 ounces of imitation crab meat. It was fabulous. We ate it for dinner!

This was a very easy to make, quick and delicioius recipe! I accidentally bought marinated artichokes, so I only used 1/2 the amount of artichokes required in the recipe.  It still turned out great and I received a lot of compliments on my dip.  Will definitely make again!

I used the creamy garlic alfredo sauce and used the full 16 oz jar rather then the 10 oz called for in the recipe.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts (drained) since that was all the store happened to have at the time.  It turned out wonderful!  Great with veggies, garlic breadsticks or tortilla chips!

It was pretty much like the restaurants make it.I made my own Alfredo and added onion, salt(it needs quite a bit I found) and pepper, garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes. I think I would add more pepper flakes the next time (1 tsp or so). I also used provolone and some Kraft Parmesean instead of real parmesean and mozza and it came out really creamy and yummy.

This recipe wasn't quite what i was looking for - i'd actually wanted something a bit soupier, that you could dip into, rather than scoop up. So initially i was disappointed. But this recipe was so good - after the first, second, and third days - that by day 4, i wanted to go back out and buy ingredients to make another batch! The only thing i did differently is substitute garlic powder for the whole cloves.

This dip is the best!  I've made it for at least 4 parties and everyone loves it.  I've found that I can substitute both minced garlic or garlic powder for the roasted garlic, and it tastes the same.  I also use locatelli romano in place of the parmesan.  Delicious!

This was really nice. I had to make the alfredo sauce from scratch as I can't find it anywhere here in England. I served it with deep fried artichoke hearts (dipped drained canned artichokes in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs before deep frying them) and they were gone quickly. Served it with french bread later. Definitely a keeper.

simply wonderful. Remember to drain the spinach and soften the cream cheese. I found that it wasn't really neccesary to use all of the spinach. If you don't like chunky, use a blender to puree the artichokes.

This was wonderful.  I also used 8 oz of cream cheese and 16 oz of Alfredo Sauce.  Quests devoured this and asked for the recipe.  Very easy, make sure the cream cheese is softened, the water well squeezed out of the spinach and you can just mix all ingredients together. I made it the day before - and baked for 50 minutes - Delicious!!!!

Had this dish once at a restaurant and fell in love with it. Decided to make it with my friends one night and it turned out perfect! We couldn't find artichoke so we left it out but it still tasted really good. If us college students can do it, I bet you can too.

Great recipe. Easier than some others I have tried, and although it takes awhile to roast the garlic, it's well worth the added flavor. I forgot the parmesan cheese, and it was still terrific, and was gone pretty quickly. i served it with tortilla chips for a housewarming party.

This recipe is fantastic! It has a great base to make changes based on individual preferences.  I  used homemade alfredo sauce (heavy cream, butter, romano and parmesan with chicken buillon for flavor) along with adding sliced water chestnuts instead of artichoke's.  I also used three cheeses; romano, parmesan, and mozzerella. Thanks for the great recipe!  My family (all italian) loves it!

This was okay, it was too bland, it did not remind me of restaurant style artichoke/spinach dip.

I have made this recipe twice and the second time I added a lot more garlic and used less spinach.  I also used marinated artichokes the second time and it added a nice flavor.  It was the first thing to go at a potluck but I think I may add the entire block of cream cheese next time to soften the alfredo taste.  Great recipe and highly recommended!

I'm THRILLED to have found this recipe.  The dip is exactly like the best restaurant spinach & artichoke dip!  I used the whole 8 oz. of cream cheese and 16 oz of Five Brothers Alfredo Sauce.  Refrigerate leftovers (if there are any)right in the baking dish then spread on a plate and microwave when you're ready to indulge. I used Tostitos Scoops tortilla chips ... yummy! It's better than ordering it in a restaurant because you can pig in the whole serving by yourself. :-)

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  My husband went back to get some more and there was hardly any left.  I also made it for my work potluck and it was gone in less than ten minutes.  It is so flavorful with the alfredo sauce, cream cheese and the other cheeses.  Yummy!

Fantastic!! I added a little extra mozz & parmesan, and a couple extra garlic cloves. I also used the entire block of Cream Cheese.  I didn't use refrigerated alfredo sauce, but opted for the whole jar of Classico Alfredo with Sun Dried Tomatoes.  Everyone loved it -- served it with toasted Italian bread.  A definite keeper!!!

As I do with most recipes I modified this one a little... I used 16 oz of alfredo sauce, 2 cups mozzarella, the entire block of cream cheese, and 5 cloves of garlic. It came out WONDERFULLY! However, it was a tad bland. But my boyfriend thought that it was wonderful, and I'm used to the REALLY strong dips so it might have been just right, just not for me ;) Next time I make it I will add more garlic and more parmesan... they both seem to spice it up a bit. Overall, this dip was great, and definitely a favorite of my family's.

This is the first time I used all recipies and I think I picked the best one in the bunch!  This was by far the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever made. The alfredo sauce is the key!

I made this for a party, and it was a huge hit!  Very good!  Very easy!  Very quick!  Very similar to the restaurant... subtle differences, but enough to say that one is not better then the other, but close enough to be happy that you've got the recipe (finally)!!!

This is my go to recipe. I cook the garlic differently because cooking it in a baking pan dries it out a bit. 
Take the skins off the garlic and cut the ends. Wrap them in a foil ball and cook until mushy. Then I make a paste and place it in the dip. 
Roasted garlic is a must in this recipe!
-Use the whole thing of cream cheese 
-use Bertolli Alfredo sauce 
-dump everything in the crock pot instead of baking because itâ€™s just so much easier!

I've made and shared this recipe many, many times.  It is so wonderful.  If you're making this for a party, do yourself a favor and double the recipe, everyone will go crazy for this! As other reviewers have said, mix all ingredients before placing in the oven.  My worst problem is finding the right crackers or breads to serve it on!  I would never be with this recipe!

Made this for a gathering of friends. Someone else brought another spinach dip. No contest! This recipe won hands down, even the person who made the other spinach dip said this recipe was so much better. I followed the suggestion to use refrigerated Alfredo sauce and the whole pkg of cream cheese. It was outstanding.

Family and friends enjoyed this dished. I double the recipe and added 1/3 of half and half.  It made the dish creamer.  This is a keeper.  This is better than the restaurants.

This was hands down the BEST recipe I have ever made! Although i did use all of these ingredients i did not follow the measurements that they give. I feel like if i used more Alfredo sauce it would ruin it so i changed it up & it tasted just like the restaurants! Could not stop eating it. Everyone loved it!! I only used about half (or a cup) of regular Alfredo and just chopped my garlic up. I also used all of the 8oz cream cheese. I also added a little bit of garlic powder, some salt & pepper. It turned out so creamy & delicious. Iâ€™m making more tomorrow. All the other recipes for spinach dip are so different than this one & they tasted not so good. This one is the best!! Going to make it forever now. Yummm! So glad I found this recipe.

The alfredo sauce overpowered the dip. I enjoy other artichoke dip recipes more, found on this site.

Made it for New Year's eve gathering.  Basically followed the recipe but I did follow some suggestions.  I used Alfredo sauce in a jar and added the full 15 oz, added 4 cloves of fresh chopped garlic 1/2 cup of Parmesan, and the full 8 oz of cream cheese.  I mixed everything in the Kitchen Aid (first cream cheese and Alfredo sauce) then the cheeses, and then the spinach) and then stirred in the artichokes by hand last.  It was creamy and very yummy.  Everyone loved it.
I gave it 5 stars but I did make some changes...

I love how it turned out. Super cvedzy and great taste. This was my first time making this friends and family enjoyed my dish too.the changes I made were a little garlic powder and minced garlic instead of cloves. I also used the entire 10 oz jar of Alfredo sauce. I used the entire bag of Sargent mozzarella shredded cheese. My Parmesan cheese was garlic rosemary by kraft. They have assorted mixes with Parmesan. Turned out great.blasting with flavor.

I love spinach/artichoke dip. I am only giving it 4 stars though as the Alfredo sauce seemed to be a bit overpowering in this sauce. I think next time I will cut the sauce just a bit and maybe add some more mozzarella to the mixture as suggested by some of the others reviews. The recipe is easy to make and will definitely try this again.

Didn't change a thing. Absolutely delicious. I haven't been baking it though. I have been mixing everything together and putting it in a crock pot. Make it the night before and put it in the fridge and warm it up in the crock pot. Always a hit. I don't know how many times I've given this recipe out!!

I used chopped garlic in the jar, reduced fat cream cheese, Newman's own Alfredo sauce, part skim mozzarella, and an 8.5 oz. can of artichoke hearts. All other ingredients as written.  The guests at the party ate the entire pan & several asked for the recipe. A big hit! Thanks!

This is awesome! I skipped the garlic part and just used minced garlic, mixed everything together in a baking dish. I also used extra mozzarella. I used a cup in the mixture and then put about a cup on top! YUM! Thanks!

This was such a delicious dip!! Better than at any restaurant. My husband devoured it!! I added a full cube of cream cheese instead of half. Cut the spinach into smaller pieces and broiled at the end of 35 minutes to give it that golden brown look. Definitely a keeper!!

I made this and felt it was not as good as I (or my husband) had hoped. I am not a fan of using the frozen spinach or canned artichoke hearts. This needs to be made from fresh ingredients; that's what I'll do when I try it again.

Perfect made it for company and everybody LOVED it! Young and old. I'll make this dip a standard...no need in my opinion to make any changes other than maybe a little more roasted garlic because we love it.

BEST. EVER. I used garlic powder, and it was still perfect. This is my go to for any party, and I always get crazy compliments. PS - slather the leftovers (if there are any) between two pieces of sourdough bread the next day...grill it up, and you'll have the best sandwich you could ever imagine!

I rarely take the time to post a review. Even though the other reviews clearly show how awesome this recipe is, I had to post about the fact that this was approved by my mother in law who is very particular about spinach artichoke dip. Super easy to make and went over really well. This one is a serious keeper.

Not a big fan of Alfredo sauce in this dip, so I used a good one sparingly (Buitoni).  I made a large batch, so I also added a cup of sour cream, a cup of mayonnaise, 2 bags of frozen spinach, 1 tsp. of kosher salt and more parmesan.  I SautÃ©ed the spinach first with a little bit of olive oil and minced garlic before adding the other ingredients and baking.  It was a hit. Thanks.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! The only changes I made were, It omitted the artichokes (only because I couldn't find any) and I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese. I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. IT STILL WAS AWESOME! I WILL HAVE TO SHARE THIS BECAUSE IT MAKES ALOT!

This recipe was easy to make and it tasted good. I gave it four stars because I think the first step could be skipped by sauteing the garlic instead in order to control the texture better. Also, it was a little runny and it tasted like it could use a stronger flavor.

Pretty good recipe but felt there was too much spinach. I ended up going back and adding the rest of the cream cheese and Alfredo sauce. Tasted much better after that!

Best Spinach Artichoke Dip out there! Serve with blue corn tortilla chips & a tablespoon of sour cream on top when it's warm. This is a family favorite for holiday parties!

This recipe is great!  If I'm going to a party, this is the dip I'm always asked to bring.  Thanks for giving me a signature dish! :)  I use Bertolli Garlic Alfredo sauce in a jar and serve with tortilla chips.

I Made this recipe last night for a Halloween Party for 30 Drunk comrades. It was Devoured and Raved about all Last night. Will Definitely do this again. I followed a few tips as previously posted. I use Roasted Garlic Alfredo from Bertolli. I used a whole pack of cream Cheese. I also Burnt the Garlic I was roasting (=C) so I used a Teaspoon of Garlic Powder. Last, I Mixed it all up really well instead of Layering it. This is now a Official Party Must.

This spinach dip is absolutely phenomenal. I have made it several times for ladies night or just movie night with myself. I prepare it just the way is says or I leave out the artichokes. Either way it is delicious.

Tried to roast my garlic but for some reason it got burned, so I used a tsp of garlic powder as I saw suggested by another review. Bertoli Alfredo sauce is my fav to use if I have to use a jarred sauce. Also used the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese. Transferred it to a crockpot and kept it on low heat. This dip was a HUGE HIT! They couldn't get enough! So glad I bought double the ingredients so I can make this on football Sunday!

This was sooooo good! I accidentally added frozen chopped broccoli instead on spinach. Ooops, but it didn't really deter from the flavor, it just seemed to add to it. Broccoli & spinach are polar opposites as vegetables goes, but nevertheless it came out great!

This recipe was fantastic. I used roasted garlic alfredo sauce, but since we love garlic flavor, it wasn't overkill. Indeed, the recipe is every bit as good as what you might find in a good restaurant. You'll like the way it tastes; I guarantee it.

Only used half of the Alfredo sauce as one reviewer suggested, used chopped fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Cooked it in a pan on the stove top. It was the best Spinach Artichoke dip I've made so far!

Excellent dip!! Made it for a recent casual dinner....I served it with tortilla chips but, some of the folks even used it as a side dish to the pork roast that I made (also from this site). Really good.....a bit time intensive on the prep, but well worth it.

Made this last year around the holidays and it was amazing. We used garlic alfredo sauce and it came out great. Next time we plan to use jalepeno alfedo sauce for an added kick.

I have been making this recipe for the last three years, since I first found it here. Friends demand it for football games, parties and potlucks and I have never made it for less then 50 servings. To simplfy things just a bit for myself I skip the roasted garlic step and just use Garlic Alfredo sauce and a half teaspoon of garlic powder. Always a huge hit. As an added bonus, if there are leftovers I stuff some of the cold dip into boneless chicken breasts and bake for about 20 minutes at 350. Super yummy.

Took this to a neighborhood get together and it was devoured. Everyone loved and requested I make it more often. I used a 15 oz jar of alfredo and the chunk of cream cheese I had was only 3 oz. I don't know what people are talking about with the bad taste or texture from using alfredo sauce that's not refrigerated. I used ragu alfredo I pulled from my pantry. I didn't have fresh garlic so I added a couple of tablespoons of minced from a jar and about 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I eyeballed the parmesan and added a good bit extra to the top before baking.

This recipe was great!! It did taste just like the restaurant version.  My usual recipe ends up greasy from all the cheese, but this was nice and creamy and not greasy at all.  It was very rich, but perfect for a party where it can be shared by many.  I used Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo, and only roasted 2 cloves of garlic. I also used the whole block of cream cheese, and eyeballed cheeses, prob used a little more than called for.  So good! You have to try it!

I make this all the time for parties and frequently get requests for the recipe.  My daughter's cheer team always requests this for their gatherings and it is super easy for even her to throw together.  I usually up the cheese to 1 1/4 Mozz and 1/2 Parmesean.  I also cheat a bit and usually put all ingredients in a crock-pot and let it cook all come together.  It also keeps the recipe warm and melty for the entire party.

I didn't have the ingredients to try this recipe as it is listed, but I did use a full package cream cheese, about 3/4 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream, artichokes, garlic, seasonings, and a can of crab and it was AWESOME.  I deep fried some soft taco shells in bite size chunks and it was a gimungous hit with everyone :-)

I cannot believe how good this tastes!! Seriously tastes JUST like it's from a 5 star restaurant! My brother-in-law said it was the best dip he has ever had! I have made this twice now and the first time I made the mistake of using fresh artichoke. SO NOT worth the mess plus it is actually much much more expensive than using a jar or can of artichoke hearts- like the recipe calls for ;) I also diced up roma tomatoes on top like the picture shows. Probably THE BEST recipe I have found from allrecipes.com

I liked it the first time I made it but something was nagging at me.  The second time I made it my son asked why the dip tasted like alfredo sauce.  He was right... the alfredo is just too overpowering and it keeps it from tasting homemade, it tastes like something you dumped from a can or jar.

Fantastic, tastes better than any other one I have had. Everyone loves this. You can use canned spinach, and garlic powder to make things a little easier. Everyone asks me for the recipe.

Awesome dip.  Such great flavors and the perfect texture.  I kept mine warm in the crockpot and it was perfect.  I stuck to the recipe and I wouldn't change anything, except I mixed everything before baking.  Some have suggested in adding 2 cups of mozzarella.  I think it would be too cheesy and mess with the texture.  If anything, I would add some diced tomato on top for some additional color.  I served it with chips and a sliced baguette.  Excellent.

I've tried to find the perfect Artichoke Spinach recipe and can't say that this was it. It was an interesting blend of flavors and super easy to put together; however, I didn't particularly love it and a lot was leftover after a family get-together. I think maybe adding some crunch with bamboo shoots might help.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exact and it was really good.. my family loved it. I don't add the artichoke because my family isn't a fan of them and I use Bertolli Pasta Sauce, it tastes great. The second time I made it, I actually completely forgot to put the cream cheese in.. and no one (even myself) noticed. It was still really good, it disappeared so fast!

This is amazing! I went without the Artichokes all together. 4 cloves of garlic was a little too much. Next time I make this I am going to use 2 or 3. Awesome! Thanks for sharing.

8 oz Philadelphia cream cheese 
1.5 cups mozzarella cheese
1 tsp garlic powder
1 Tbsp Adobe all purpose seasoning
10oz Frozen spinach, thawed and drained

Mix, in that order within a large bowl while oven is preheating. Pour into 9x9 baking pan and cook until edges are bubbly. Stir and top with extra cheese and freshly diced tomatoes as desired for presentation. 

***Steam fresh spinach makes this recipe MUCH easier. Just microwave for half the time labeled on the bag and drain.

This was good but not the restaurant-style I was looking for. I was looking for something a little "meltier" - Just noted from reviews I shoul have used Alfredo sauce from the refridgerated section.  That may have made the difference.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

This recipe never lets me down.  It's fantastic.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of just a half.  Amazing.  I took it to a company party and this recipe is a fool proof way to impress guests.

CREAMY CHEESY YUMMY GOODNESS.  This was amazing.  I took it to a pot luck at work and there was none left.  It even tasts good reheated in the microwave.  I used the roasted garlic alfrado and since I love garlic I added even more in powdered and fresh form.  I also used the 1/3 fat cream cheese.  Like many others I mixed everything together in a mixing bowel and the put it in a cassarole dish.   I will definatly make this again.

It was really really good! I followed everyone's suggestions of adding the whole box of cream cheese and the Bertolli sauce. I used the really thin tortilla chips--yummy!

I was really disappointed, as I usually agree with well-reviewed recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted like alfredo sauce with spinach in it.  You couldn't taste the cream cheese at all. If you are expecting alfredo, you might like it - but it's not a great flavor for dip.  We ended up tossing it.

The Alfredo sauce along with everything else made it way too salty.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Wow! Excellent recipe. I didn't have a jar of alfredo sauce so I made my own. I added 1 pint of heavy whipping cream, 3/4 cup parmesan cheese, 1 stick butter and 1/2 pkg cream cheese. Amazing.

I made this for Thanksgiving as an appetizer and it was gone really fast. I recommend this recipe 100%. My husband even said it was way better than the restaraunt artichoke spinach dips. I did add a little bit of onion powder, salt and pepper. I completely forget to buy parmesan cheese, so it wasn't added but i'm sure it would've been just as tasty with it in the dip. I already have requests to make it at Christmas. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Not sure what I'm missing, as I picked this recipe based in its high ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated (have not read reviews) and it was SO bland. All we could taste is alfredo sauce and cream cheese.

This is amazing! I added the hot sauce - several dashs.  And I used parmesan, asiago, romano blend.  I also used the Bertolli garlic alfredo sauce and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic instead of the cloves.  I doubled the recipe - it made alot but my husband has been eating it by the spoonfuls.  It won't last long.  Thanks for the great recipe!

i wanted to try a new recipe and this one had so many good reviews but I was pretty disappointed.  I used half the spinach suggested, 2c of mozzarella, 1/2c of parmesan, 8oz of cream cheese, a 15oz jar of roasted garlic alfredo and a whole can of artichoke hearts.  I didn't add any salt but it was extremely salty maybe because of the store bought alfredo sauce. It wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be even though I heated all of the ingredients together before baking so that it would be evenly distributed.  Although this is much easier to make than my other SA recipe, I'd have to make more adjustments to this one before it can be up to par with my other recipe.

Have only received compliments when making this dish.  I mix all the ingredients together, not layering, and use fresh spinach (sauted & drained).  My favorite way of making this dish is taking tortilla wraps, cutting them in small squares, spray a mini muffin tray with olive oil and form the tortilla squares in the muffin tray.  Fill with the spinach artichoke dip and bake for approx 5-10 min.  I put on broil the last couple of minutes.

I made this for a girl's night with friends and we loved it with tortilla chips!  It made a lot so my fiance and mom helped me finish it off the next day.  Tastes a lot like chain restaurants' version.  It will be my go to artichoke/spinach dip recipe.

I'm a garlic addict so I added 4 large elephant garlic bulbs of garlic chopped finely. I also added some real lump crab meat (WARNING! CRAB MEAT: A TINY BIT GOES A VERY LONG WAY!) and additional cream cheese Also, the bake time on this dip is WAY off. Go higher and longer, until fully bubbling! Other than that, I followed this recipe to a tee. Seriously people, this recipe was to die for! Folks, this is one of those recipes you'll steal and tell your guests, "Yeah, one night I got bored and created it myself." This tasted FAR better than Papaduex (the chain restaurant) recipe! By the way, I only had some Ragu Alfredo Sauce on hand and it still turned out great! I can only imagine how wonderful this recipe would be with a higher end Alfredo sauce!

OMG DELICIOUS!!! The only thing I did differently was use the whole package of cream cheese and i think my jar of alfredo may have been larger than 10 oz. Either way this tastes exactly like what you would order at one of the chain restaurants. So good. This didnt even last a day in my house!

I have made this many times for parties and everyone asks for me to make it again. I love garlic so I roast a whole head of it by cutting off the top, putting it in foil and drizzling olive oil on it. I will eat it for lunch the next day (if there are leftovers!)

Well, I have never tasted anything so angelic and devilish at the same time.  This recipe is awesome!  I didn't have to tweak it at all.  This is exactly what you want to fix for a yummy appetizer for a crowd.  It's definitely a go to recipe now!

This was the first time I made the  recipe and  it was   wonderful just like restaurant style.  I read the reviews before I made this and I noticed people saying it wasnt thick enough in some cases or it didnt have the right consistency.  So to make  it blend very well I used a food processor... I  chopped   frozen chopped spinach 16oz,  and canned artichokes ( not marinated ones) in the processor first then I   hit the mix  button until I saw it was mixed well then I added the   whipped cream  cheese 8oz in there as well and mixed that up.  While  I was doing this I  did  bake 1 whole bulk of garlic in the oven... and did as  directed  on the  recipe,  squeezed all that garlic out there.   
 When I was  done with  the processor i threw all the  ingredients  in the a large mixing  bowl, then added the regular alfredo ( used trader joes) ,   mixed it up then  added the  garlic mixed that up then  for  cheeses I used   1/3 parm/romano  (50/50 blend) as that was what i had on hand,  and 1 1/2 cup of mozzarella...   and mixed  it up together. It was thick by the time I mixed everything together. I poured it in 8x8 baking dish.   Baked  it for   30 minutes and it was amazing!  I got most of my ingredients from trader joes...  It was delicious, thick and cheesy!!!

This was the best Artichoke & Spinach Dip I have had in a long time.  I only used about 1/2 box spinach, & I used a 15oz jar of Classico Alfredo Sauce with Roasted Garlic.  I added about 1/2 C. more mozzarella and it was a big hit!  I will make this again for sure!

This is awesome!  I really don't change any of the ingredients...just the amounts.  I always make a big pan (13x9) and double the garlic, cream cheese, and spinach.  Then I triple the artichokes, alfredo sauce, mozzarella, and parm.  I also add black pepper.  I mix everything together in a bowl and then spread into the dish.  And, I just chop the garlic without baking it first.

This is my favorite spinach & artichoke dip recipe.  I love the creaminess!  I used Bertolli garlic flavored alfredo sauce and served with pita chips.

After reading all the reviews I was expecting the perfect dip. It did not have much of a flavor...it is missing a spice and I have not figured out what that is yet. Good base but is lacking. I did cook it exactly like it said to do including roasting the garlic.

Like others, even though I would like to, I can't give full stars because I changed the recipe slightly. But WOW! this dip was fantastic!. I used one reviewer's suggestion and used garlic powder (1 tablespoon) instead of cloves of garlic. We didn't have the time to roast the cloves. I also used a cup and a half of a Mozza-cheddar shredded cheese combo instead of just mozzarella.  We cut up some store bought naan for dipping. We had it for a midnight snack on New Years Eve. I think I will be making this again and again. And yes, it tastes EXACTLY like the fabulous dip they serve at Casey's restaurants in Ontario, Canada. YUMMYY!!!!

Everyone gobbled this one up even though this wasn't my fave.  I used light cream cheese, extra cloves of roasted garlic and a 19 oz jar of Newman's Alfredo sauce and the family loved it.  Will make it again for gatherings.

I wanted to take a photo to put on the site when this was done, but it was eaten way too fast. I was afraid I had made too much as I used the original recipe amounts, but for the 14 people at the party, it was all gone, and I think only half of them ate the dip. lol. I used frozen creamed spinach and that worked out fine. I did this really quickly and didn't get to melt the cream cheese, which I will do next time. And i used whole 8 oz package. perfect and i will do this again!

I loved this recipe! My boyfriend inhales it! I went my own way with it too, as I used canned spinach (took 2 teaspoons out), and skipped the first step. I added all the ingredients into the dish, used 2 teaspoons minced garlic and mixed that in as well, covered and baked for 23 minutes, then removed cover added a light layer of cheese on top and baked for another 10-12 minutes! Love it!

This dip is fabulous! I've made it several times for parties and always have people ask for the recipe. I use about 1 tsp minced garlic instead of the cloves to save time and it's a perfect substitute.

You would not believe how easy this recipe is and how many compliements you'll get for it.  I've made it a handful of times and love it as-is, but also love it with a few roasted garlic cloves.  Not at all healthy, but sooooo delicious.

I recently made this for my friends baby shower and am happy to say it was a complete hit! I ended up making it a double batch and actually made it 3 days ahead of time (without cooking it), so I could just throw it in the oven. The only thing I did change was that I added a smidge more garlic. Everybody raved about how amazing it was and they all wanted the recipe. Unfortunately, even though I made a double batch, it was the first to go and I didn't get to bring home any leftovers. I am looking forward to our next get together so I can make this again. Thank you!!

LOVED IT!  Taste like what you order.  Only problem was too salty with corn chips.  I think I'll use low sodium products the next time.

I have used this recipe for the last 5 years- all my friends think I am a gourmet chef- for real. I love, love,love this one. The only tip I would have is add garlic salt- makes it enhance the flavors of the cheese. Great one for sure.

This is delicious! My husband and I had been looking for a great spinach artichoke dip and this definitely fits the bill. We made a few changes to suit our tastes: we used about 6 oz (3/4 package) cream cheese, a little extra mozzarella, and a dash of cayenne pepper. We also used minced garlic straight from the jar for convenience. We just mixed everything together in a bowl, spread it in a dish, and baked. I would suggest stirring it after 30 min of baking to get the cream cheese well distributed (ours was kinda clumped together at first), then popping it back in for a few minutes. So yummy with tortilla chips!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I mixed all of the indgrediants prior to baking. I think this dip is lacking flavor and calls for too much spinach. I'm not sure I'll make this again.

This was amazing!  It was okay right out of the oven, but if you let it sit overnight, the flavors mellow/meld and you end up with a dip that rivals Applebee's.  I'm used to paying $10 for a small bit of this at Applebee's.  Now I pay the same $10 and get 8X as much as I would buy at a restaraunt.  If you like spinach and artichoke dip, make this recipe.  You won't be sorry.

This recipe is awesome! Especially if you make your own alfredo sauce from the 'Really Creamy Fettuccine Alfredo' recipe found on allrecipes.  I reccomend just putting all the ingredients in a bowl and mixing, rather than trying to place them evenly in a 8x8.

I always get nervous when trying new recipes, but I had a craving for this kind of dip and decided to give this one a chance based on the high rating. I absolutely loved it, along with every single person who tried it. Everyone kept coming back for more. One of my guests honestly said "it's like a little taste of heaven". This is a great recipe that I will be making again! The garlic is a tad strong, but when I commented that I might cut back on it next time, my sister said "Don't change a thing, it's too good how it is!!" I did use the whole 8 oz package of cream cheese, and I'm really glad I did. Delicious!!

I made the Hot Artichoke & Spinach Dip first from this website and the cream cheese was overwhelming.  So I tried this one and it's SO MUCH better.  I wanted the dip to be close/equal to restaurant quality because we always order it when we eat out and this version is very close.  I used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.  I've made this twice already and the 2nd time, I doubled the recipe for a family party.  Who would have thought the secret ingredient is a jar of Alfredo sauce!!  I used Bertolli the first time and Paul Neuman the second time.  Used garlic powder instead of real garlic to speed things up.  I added salt and pepper after it came out of the oven because I didn't know how salty the cheeses would be after they've melted.  I will be making this again and again.  I served it with tortilla chips and homemade garlic bread.  It's very good with bread.  Warning:  It's highly addictive!

This is really better then restaurant spinach dip.  I followed other suggestions and added a full 8oz bar of cream cheese.  It was perfect.

Luscious Spinach Artichoke Dip from this site is much better.  This one is restaurant style, which to me is usually bland.

This was really good, it tasted like something you would get in a restaurant... only more fresh and better all around.  I cooked it for the majority of the time recommended, then took it out, poured it in a bread bowl, and put it back in for a few minutes.  Delicious!

This was good.  I made the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" and used a full stick of cream cheese.  I also cut back the spinach by 1/3 (personal preference).

I think the alfredo sauce and the roasted garlic really make this dish. This was the first time I roasted garlic and I'm sure glad I did.  I sprinkled a layer of cheese on top at for the last 5 minutes of baking. Yummy!

LOVED IT! I used a extra mozzarella and parmesan cheese and next time I think I will use the whole 8oz. block of cream cheese. I mixed everything together because it seemed to make more sense, and baked it until bubbly. This was wonderful and I would highly recommend it! I can't wait to make this for my next get-together. Thanks for sharing. :)

Delish! Just the recipe I was looking for... I made as written, and after cooking in the oven, I moved it into a very small crockpot to keep warm as it sat on our buffet for an all-afternoon get together.

Made this for Thanksgiving this past holiday season.  It turned out really good - just as yummy as in any restaurant and super easy.  I used canned minced garlic, the whole 8 ounces of cream cheese and instead of layering, I pre-mixed everything and added a layer of parmesan cheese & mozzarella on top before I baked it.

I burned my tongue on the first bite, because it smelled so wonderful, I couldn't resist! I also just mixed everything together, and I even added some crab, because I really wanted a crab dip. I can't wait to try this without the crab, because I like the face that there is no mayo in it. This was yummy!!

Very yummy! Even my children liked it :) I mixed all the ingredients in a large bowl and transfered it to a loaf pan for heating. It can even go straight to the fridge after mixing and smaller portions can be dipped out and microwaved.

I've made this twice in the last few weeks and its gotten luke warm reception both times.  It's very bland tasting and the spinach may be too overpowering.  I won't make again.

This is the best Artichoke & Spinach Dip I have ever had!  I think this recipe blows the restaurant recipes out of the water.  I made this for a party at work and everyone that tried it asked for the recipe and raved on how good it was.  I will be making this for our New years eve party!!!

Very delicious and easy to make.  My Mother who said she doesn't like artichokes and my picky Nephews all loved this dip.  I used a whole package of cream cheese and an entire jar of the Classico Roasted Garlic alfredo sauce and it came out perfectly.

This recipie is ok. I added about a cup more mozzarella, 1/2 cup of parmesean, 4 more oz of cream cheese 5 more oz of alfredo sauce. The dip was a little over powering with spinach flavor before. Afterwards, it was more creamy.

So quick and easy to make. I brought this to a potluck dinner as an appy with some slices of crusty bread, bread sticks and pita triangles and I was surprised that everyone (7 people) devoured it to the last bit. I only used half of the cream cheese and felt that it was rich and creamy enough. As for the alfredo I used a roasted garlic and parmesan alfredo, and it combined very well. I added 5 cloves of freshly roasted garlic too.

We are self- titled spinach artichoke dip critics.. we have sampled dips of variuos restaurant... this was our first time making one. I put 2 cups of mozzerella instead of 1 cup which turned out a little too filling, as well as an extra ten minutes in the oven.  the dip was good but i will try it with either fresh spinach or a better brand next time. It's fast easy and will definately feed more than 2 people...

This was a dang good recipe! Just like the restaurant. I used home-made alfredo sauce as the base. We used the home made fococcia bread to dip with. Tasty!

I used 8 oz of cream cheese like other reviewers recommended.  Best served hot and definitely not as amazing once it cooled off.  Next time I'll make it in two different rounds to make sure it is fresh for the entire party.

All this tasted of was the container of Alfredo sauce. If that's what your looking for, great. But I wanted that creamy restaurant style, which this was nothing like. Will continue my search for a good Dip recipe.

Omigod! This recipe was fantastic and just as good as my favorite Applebee's dip! I made it for my baby shower because I was craving it! I uped the cream cheese as suggested in other reviews as I love cream cheese. The only thing I didn't have was the shredded parmesean. I didn't realize it had to be fresh parm until I read a review and I was planning on using the powdered form you put on spaghetti. Anyhow, it was a huge hit at my shower! I doubled the batch not knowing it makes a lot and was worried it would go to waste, but boy was I wrong. Everyone raved and couldn't stop eating it, nor could I! I will definitely be making this again and again!

I made this the first nite of a week long vacay with my uber sweetness Tay. HE LOVED IT! I used a whole package of cream cheese as to what other were saying. I also used the BIG can of 6-8 count of artichokes, and took the time to seperate them. It was so so so so good! I used Ragu' Roasteed Garlic Alfredo sauce, and it was seriously so wonderful! Since it was just the two of us, this was a huge amonut to make, but it reheated so well!!! Just a few minutes in the nuker and it was perfect! I served with tortilla chips, but next time I wann try to make an omelette with this as the filling...hmmmm?

It does not get any better than this! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception. I used other reviewers suggestions and used the entire thing of cream cheese and added extra alfredo sauce. I wanted to turn this into a dinner so I made pizza with it, so incredible! I used a premade pizza crust baked it for a couple of minutes, topped with the cooked artichoke spinach dip, some baby shrimp and extra mozz and parmesan cheese baked until the cheese was melted and garnished with some green onion. Sure not the healthiest recipe in the world but so delicious. Can't wait to make this again!

SO good!  Very reminiscent of a certain restaurant... I substituted the roasted garlic for jarred chopped garlic because I didn't want to take the extra time (I was hungry!).  It was still very good but I think with the roasted garlic, it would be perfection!  I also used about half the can of artichokes because I'm not a huge fan.  Chopping them up very small is the way to go.

Sorry but I guess I just didn't like this.  All the ingredients are great and I even used a good quality Alfredo sauce but somehow I always feel like the alfredo in a jar tastes fake and like cardboard. The other indredients did not cover that up for me. If you don't like the alfredo in the jar I would not try this. Thanks anyway!

This dip is delicious!  I've made it several times and haven't found any big significance between using chopped garlic from the jar or roasting your own.  I also used a whole block of cream cheese instead of half a block.  You'll never have leftovers if you make this!  I like to serve it with whole grain sourdough bread.

I made this recipe this weekend, and WOW it was delicious! Even my todler loved it! I think the key is the alfredo sauce. I used fresh chopped garlic instead of roasting it. Also, I noticed that the picture has fresh chopped tomatoes on the top but the recipe didn't include them. Any time I order this dip from a restaraunt, it always has the tomatoes on top so I added them right after taking it out of the oven. Super Yummy!

This was exceptional.  Followed recipe, used 3/4 of the 8 oz size of cream cheese--perfect.  Added a touch of hot sauce.  Didnt layer it in the 8x8 pan; mixed all the ingred together--then put into a casserole dish.  This is the one!

I never write reviews because I always alter recipes to suit my taste. However, I did not alter this recipe and it was fabulous. Restaurant quality! The first time I made it was for a party and numerous people asked for the recipe. The second time I made it was for my in-laws and they gobbled it up and requested the recipe. It is so yummy!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I've served it to thus far. I especially like that it doesn't use mayo. I used fresh spinach and didn't roast the garlic. I just sauteed about 1 and 1/4 bags of fresh spinach with fresh sliced garlic then proceeded with recipe. I use sun-dried-tomato alfredo. Love it!

It was so easy to make. I whipped a batch up for a family party and impressed everyone- I of course had to admit it was amazingly simple. I was doing Christmas gifts on the cheap last year, but didn't want to do cookies for everyone (I didn't have enough time plus wanted to be more creative). So i made a batch of this for several people on my list- Made the entire thing on the stove top and instead of putting it in the oven, i put it in airtight ziploc containers, and refrigerated them. I gave them with heating instructions (added 10 minutes to the cooking time to make up for the fact that it was cold when going into the oven) and a bag of chips. I've made this so many times that I don't even need the recipe. It's ingrained in my mind.

I made this because it seemed "easy" with all the pre-made ingredients, but I was not happy with the consistency or the flavor. Generally I only cook from scratch but I thought my guests would enjoy an appetizer they recognized.  It does very much resemble "restaurant style" but perhaps I would prefer a different restaurant.  I had about 15 people to serve, and it was barely half eaten.  It was way to thick to "dip".  Even my junk-food-loving husband didn't finish it.

I accidentally grabbed the can of Hearts of Palm instead of the Artichoke Hearts at the grocery store!! But I used them anyways and they worked just as well and were 60 cents cheaper at Price Chopper! I also used 1 tbsp of garlic powder and used 8 oz of cream cheese. It came out very good!!

This was fantastic.  I did not have enough time to roast the garlic, so I just added about one tablespoon of garlic powder.  I also used light alfredo, reduced fat cream cheese (8 ounces) and skim milk mozzarella, just to help lighten the load a little.  It was creamy and so, so flavorful.  Served with baked tortilla chips, it was a perfect dip for company.  I can't wait to make it again!

This dip is very good, althought I thought it could use some salt.  I used a full 8oz of cream cheese and the refrigerated LIGHT alfredo sauce.  I served it with white and blue corn tortilla chips...YUMMY!!!

Came out great and enjoyed by all.  Two days later reheated in microwave and was just as good. Not sure where to find Alfredo sauce in the "refrigerated pasta section" but I used Bertolli's in the jar and it tasted fine. Used all 15 ounces and added a little extra mozzarella cheese.

This recipe is so good, I finally registered here just to write a review. I've always laughed at reviews that say "this is the best recipe ever, and here's how I changed it..." but now it's my turn! Instead of roasting 4 cloves of garlic, I used minced garlic from a jar, equal to 4 cloves, without roasting. Instead of frozen spinach, I used chopped fresh spinach. (Note: Alfredo sauce from the refrigerated pasta section, not the pasta aisle.) Instead of layering, I mixed everything except the Parmesan cheese together in a bowl, then poured into the dish and topped with the Parmesan cheese. If you take this to a party, you WILL get asked for the recipe.

I have never made spinach artichoke dip before, and this was super easy! It was absolutely wonderful.  I took it to a progressive dinner party, and was asked for the recipe from several people! The most important one was from one who was a chef in the army.  Her and her husband raved about it the whole time!  Will definitely make this again. Also I used the Ragu Alfredo sauce from the pasta isle, and it turned out just fine.

This was delicious!  I actually used a 15 oz. jar of alrfredo sauce, but otherwise stayed faithful to the recipe as presented.  It really did taste like the dip that you order in a restaurant.

This recipe has to be one of the best spinach dips I've ever had, made in a restaurant or not.  It's even better the next day when it is reheated because all the flavors get a chance to meld together.

I have made this recipe several times, and this dip is always a HUGE hit!  It's great for parties and holidays.  I substitute ingredients for low-fat versions when possible.  Also, I've found that if I use FRESH spinach, it tastes much better.    The only downside- now no restaurant dip can compare...I much prefer to make this one!

Great dip! You may want to run it in the food processor for a few pulses before baking--to make sure everything's chopped and blended.

I tried this recipe last night with my guests and it was big hit. I served it with White Corn Tortilla Chips and I also placed a small amount of chopped pico de gallo on top. I will definitely use a little less spinach next time though. Highly Recommend!

This was very good.  I made my own alfredo sauce, from a recipe on this site called 'Easy Alfredo Sauce"  I think the fresh sauce helped the dish quite a bit.

This dip is fabulous.  Although I did make a few alterations.  Instead of using 4 cloves of garlic I just add in minced garlic that you buy in a glass jar approx. 2 tablespoons or however much you prefer more or less.  I bought the roasted garlic Alfredo Style Pasta Sauce by Ragu (I believe).  As well I added Salt and Pepper and a dash of garlic powder.  I mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering it.  Then I topped off with extra mozzarella and parmesan cheese. This is a great party dish for entertaining.

This dip was good, but my husband and I both thought it was *missing something.* Next time I will try adding more parmesan, and maybe a sharper cheese. Asiago, maybe?

I thought this dip was excellent.  I tried it with corn chips, crackers, and ridged potato chips and liked it best with the crackers.  I believe the sauce brand I used was Bertolli.

This was good and definetly easy, however kind of in my opinion. Next time I would double (to the or triple) the garlic and possibly add some tapatia or some other hot sauce.

A 5 star from my friends who devoured this dip, 1 star from me.  Make sure you're ok with the flavor of your alfredo sauce; the sauce absolutely dominated the flavor of the dip.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This is great.  My kids love Applebee's veggie pizza(they no longer have it on the menu here) so I took a tortilla and added some of this dip and topped it off with a little mozerella cheese and it was even better than applebees.  Thanks for the recipe. Next I'm going to make a stromboli with it and add mushrooms and onions.

My family absolutley loved this recipe!! I made it a week ago and since then I've made it twice. And I never had left overs. The only thing I did change was the how many artichokes. I only put in about 8 oz. and it was still great!

WOW!!!! I made this dip tonight and it's a keeper. I tastes just like the Spinach & Artichoke Dip that I've ordered from many restaurants! As other reviewers suggested I used the entire package of cream cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and 1/2 - 1 cup the of parmesan cheese. Instead of roasting garlic I minced 5 cloves of fresh garlic and sautÃ©ed them in butter/olive oil along with 1/2 onion. I had to bake the dip for about 45 min - 1 hour. Everthing else I kept the same. Perfect! 03/30/2009: I've made this recipe 3 times already and can't get enough! I can sit in front of the TV and eat the entire bowl before even realizing it (I know sad huh). I absolutley LOVE it. My best friend said it tastes better than the restaurants.

Amazing Recipe! I did follow the advice of a few other reviewers though. I'm always been requested to make this once a week since I first made it!

This has become my signature dip-- I'm always asked to make it for parties! I use one full 8 oz. block of cream cheese, and instead of adding extra roasted garlic, I use most of a jar of Classico Roasted Garlic alfredo sauce. Make sure to mix all the ingredients together in a bowl before pressing it into a baking dish-- it incorporates the ingredients much better!

I make this for every get-together we have! The only thing I do different is leave out the garlic (I think its better without it) and add just a little more cheese! It is a big hit at every event I have. I even made it for my own baby shower!!

Wow!  It really is like the restaurant kind without paying $9 for the whole dish.  The best I have had so far by far.  You won't be disappointed.  I even made my own alfredo sauce instead of using aq canned variety.  I always use Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce on here.  You will love it too!

I did not like the flavor that the alfredo sauce gave this recipe. I tried it again cutting the alfredo, adding more cream cheese, extra parm and some mayo, with a splash of white wine.  I also like to add some chopped water chestnuts. I cut the garlic down to 2 cloves and served on a garlic toasted baguette. This was much better in my opinion.

This dip is an enormous hit every time I make it. The most resounding sentiment among the crowd? "This is the best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had". It is creamy and deliciously cheesy, mixing several different types of cheeses together perfectly. The roasted garlic adds a nice depth of flavor as well.

I have made this twice now and it was a hit both times. The only thing I changed was the amount of cheese and alfredo sauce. I threw the whole jar in and added more cheese. It was great and gone fast!

This has to be some of the best spinach dip I've ever had! I did make some few adjustments, however. Instead of buying frozen spinach, I bought fresh and chopped it myself and also I noticed there were tomatoes in the picture, so I bought a couple of roma tomatoes, chopped them, and added them myself. This is definitely a recipie I'll be using again. Our family likes to serve it on Italian bread. Yummy!

Super delicious recipe! Better than any I have had in a restaurant. I used Classico four cheese alfredo sauce and used the entire 16 ounce jar. I also added 1/2 cup more of mozzarella and the entire bar of cream cheese.

I have made the florentine artichoke dip from this site a few times, and thought it was pretty good, but this recipe tastes AMAZING!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I mixed all ingredients together and then spooned it into an 8x8 Pyrex dish.  I put some extra grated parmesan on top (I used the refrigerated kind, not the kind found in the pasta aisle), and baked it for about 40 minutes until the top was browned.  This is my new spinach artichoke dip recipe!

LOVED this. The one thing I could not believe though is it says to roast your garlic, but then to add a jarred alfredo sauce. Hmmm... Do this w/homemade sauce and YUM. Recipe for sauce found on AR is Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce .

Perfect recipe. If I am in a hurry, I add 1 tbsp minced jar garlic instead of roasting the garlic, but roasting gives a richer flavor. This dish gets rave reviews every time I make it!

This Artichoke & Spinach Dip recipe is so good it puts some food chains Artichoke & Spinach Dip recipes to shame. Before I roasted the clove of garlic I seasoning the clove with Williams-Sonomaâ€™s Parmesan Olive Oil, freshly ground black, and Rosemary. After the clove of garlic were roasted and had cooled. I added all the ingredients in the recipe plus some additional ingredients such as garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, sea salt and finely minced onion. I served this recipe with pretzel chips for my motherâ€™s birthday this dip only lasted for least 1 hour.

Delicious! Brought to a holiday party and it was the hit of the party!  Going to another party 3 days later, and am requested to make it again! I added extra mozzarella and parmesean, and used the whole 8oz pack of cream cheese, as other reviewers.  Added a layer of mozzarella and parmesean on top and broiled to give a nice crust on top.  Used Bertolli's 15 oz alfredo sauce- turned out great!

This dip is fabulous!  I make this for every get-together I have and it's always gone.  The recipe doesn't call for it, but I add a little salt and pepper just to give it some extra flavor.  This one is a hit.

This was the best we've ever had and my daughter and I are big fans of the Applebees version.  We did get a little carried away with the roasted garlic. We ended up pretty much doubling the amount, but it was great - not too garlicky, just enough.  I do think cooking it uncovered for the last 15 minutes would brown it just a little more. This is already in our "engraved in stone - don't mess with it" family cook book!

This is my absolute favorite recipe for artichoke and spinach dip.  It is by far the closest you can get to what the resturants serve, well it's even better than some restaurants!  My only advice do not leave out the parm.  I did once and could tell it was missing something.  This will be a hit at any party or football gathering!

This is really an amazing dip.  I have made it twice.  This first time really just to "test" it out before a party.  With the first batch I did not change a thing.  It made a huge batch, too big for my family of three so I used the left over dip to make a chicken and spinach with artichoke lasagna ...yum!  The second time I took it to a Christmas party and EVERYONE raved about it, even people that don't like green vegetables.  Needless to say it was one of the first things to disappear.  I took the advice and did use "Bertolli" alfredo sauce and garlic paste.  Also the second batch I added a little garlic salt.  It will be made over and over in my kitchen!

I liked the idea of this recipe because I could use the alfredo sauce in my pantry I was never going to eat, and because it didn't use mayonnaise! I added two extra cloves of garlic, and it was very good.

This was AWESOME!  I made it for a Thanksgiving recipe with some of the recommended tweaks. 

I used preminced garlic to save on time, and it worked great.  I used a whole (15 oz) can of roasted garlic alfredo sauce.  I also upped the mozz cheese to 2 cups and the parm to 1/2 cup and used the whole 8 oz thing of cream cheese, (1/3 fat).

I used a bigger pan (13x9) and blended all the ingredents together with a mixer before placing in the pan.  It took closer to 45 minutes to bake at 350.  I would up the temp to 375 next time.

My own special tweak...
I sliced up a loaf of bagguette bread and mixed together margerine spread with about 1 tbs of minced garlic and 1/2 tbs itlian dressing.  I spread the butter mix on the bread and topped it with some parmeson, and sprinkled oregano and basil on top.  I toasted in the oven til browned and served with the dip.

This was delicious!  I was scared of the jarred alfredo sauce, since that's something I never eat, but it was amazing.  Love it with pita chips!

By far better than the old recipe I used to use. I skipped the garlic altogether because the Alfredo Sauce (roasted garlic flavor) has it already - which made this even quicker to make. Also, I used a 16 oz bag frozen spinach, a low fat cream cheese, and a little more Parm.  We served it for Thanksgiving, and everyone was eating it as a side dish!  Great recipe.

Wonderful. I love using the Alfredo sauce instead of the mayo/sour cream combo. I skipped the roasted garlic step (I'm sure it enriches the dip, but I was short on time and I'm not a huge garlic fan). Also, I used a frozen creamed spinach. Added a pinch of nutmeg and a generous twist of fresh black pepper. Big hit, will make again.

I used double the Mozzarella cheese and a bit more Parm.  I've made this MANY times and everyone LOVES it.  My boyfriends says it's better than any you'll get in a restaurant.

This recipe was a huge hit at a dinner party.  Everyone stood around the counter eating it!  I did a few things different...I mixed everything together rather than layering.  Also, I minced the garlic and sautÃ©ed it in olive oil.  I then added a large scoop of sour cream.  I served this dip with bruschetta and tortilla chips.  I will definitely be using this one again!

I made this recipe and several other dips for a party.  The spinach artichoke dip was a hit!  It was so easy to make (and needed no alterations), I made it again a few days later for the guys' football party.  No one touched the other food!

I made this for a cocktail party. I made a few other nibbles as well, but this recipe was the star of the show! It was gone within an hour. I made this in a slow cooker set on low for two hours, then on warm. I also add a 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper for a little extra spice. On request,  I'll be taking this to a Halloween party next week. Delicious!

We loved this dip! After reading the reviews i roasted the garlic and made sure the dip was very thoroughly mixed before putting it in the oven. Served this in a toasted bread bowl, and on another occasion with tortilla chips for dipping.

AMAZING. Just like the dip we had in the restaurant, only without having to go out to get it.

To cut down on fat, I used fat free cream cheese and the "healthy" version of Ragu's alfredo sauce. I've never bothered to roast garlic before, but I decided to do it for this recipe, and I think it was well worth it. It's great.

I'm having a little bit tonight, and have portioned the rest out into tupperware containers to freeze and serve whenever I want it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is out of this world...and so easy!  I have made it twice so far and the second time I had to give some of it away just so my boyfriend and I did not eat the whole thing!  Based on suggestions, I used a whole block of cream cheese and it turned out great. My only suggestion would be adding a little salt and pepper to kick it up a bit.  Overall, it was a winner!

This was exactly what I wanted.  I did as other reviewers and didn't bother to roast the garlic.  I just put the cloves with the canned artichokes in the food processor and pulsed them together.  I cooked mine for the 30 minutes, but I also broiled the dish before serving to make it nice and brown.  I served it with a french bagette that I sliced into rounds (I could have used two though)

Very disappointing. I layered it like the recipe said, and it was an unattractive mess.

YUM!!! Made this for a party tonight and the dip was a total success. Changes: I mixed all ingredients together before baking, as advised by previous reviewers, and added whole pkge. of cream cheese instead of half. It was wonderful. Served with tortilla chips, carrots, and celery. Thanks!

This was soooo Great that I am going to make another batch tonight!!  I made it for the 1st time last night for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it!  I did make a couple of changes:  I did not add the can of artichokes, I used 2cups Moz. cheese, I used the whole package of cream cheese, I added about 4 drops of tabasco, and added some pepper.  If there were more than 5 stars, I would give it to this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Everyone who tried it loved it and asked for more.

I didn't change much from the original recipe other than using marinated artichokes, marinated mushrooms, and a tad bit more crushed garlic.  Otherwise, perfect as is.

This recipe was fantastic and was indeed very much like something you'd get at a restaurant. However my boyfriend seemed to think that it was a bit too much spinach. I'd make this recipe again but next time with a tad less spinach.

Every time I make this I get rave reviews.  I made the mistake of taking to poker night, now I have to make a batch every week.  It's a good thing that it's so easy.  Even people who don't like spinach or artichokes have been caught licking the dish clean.

I was pretty disappointed with this.  It might have been a 5 for texture and a 1 for flavor, so I rated it a 3 overall.  I made it as stated except for adding the whole package of cream cheese.  When I reheated the leftovers, I stirred in a bit of Emeril's Essence and that helped immensely.  Previously it didn't even have a flavor -- it just tasted like creaminess if that makes any sense.  I eat this dip at many different restaurants and it didn't taste anything like what I've ordered.  I'll continue to work with this recipe though because I love that it doesn't have any mayo.  Lots of potential here, but definitely not anything to rave about as is.

the alfredo sauce as a base was a great idea!  however, the cream cheese?  just too much.  it makes it very thick and heavy, and this is even when I used a little less than the recipe called for.  Next time, I would cut the cream cheese to less than half, and maybe up the amount of alfredo and parmesan just a tiny bit.  Other than that, it was really good.

Better than regular spinach dip, which has been a favorite for many years.  I like that it's warm, really good for the winter months - a Christmas Holiday treat

Fantastic! I've made this twice already and will make again. Just make sure the melt the cream cheese in the microwave a bit before mixing (I didn't do that the first time and there were chunks of cheese in the dip even after baking-but it still tasted great and was all gone ten minutes after I put it on the table!)

This was very, very good and very easy to make. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not the best I ever had. However, everyone loved it, including me, and we ate all of it quick! If you're looking for a good recipe I would definitely recommend trying this one out.

i thought that this recipe made a very clumpy/stringy dip verses the creamy ones that i have had before. i also felt that the flavor was a little overwhelming, probably because of the alfredo sauce.

I made this for New Year's and it was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly.  Guess it's just a matter of personal taste.  My guests tried it, but were not that impressed. Most thought it was rather heavy (perhaps the cream cheese was too much?)

I made this for a Christmas gathering with my in-laws.  I was a little nervous about what this combination of ingredients would taste like but the risk was definitely worth taking!  Made recipe just as written,using fresh roasted garlic, and the entire block of cream cheese (which was 8 oz. as called for in recipe).  I was getting compliments all evening.  Gotta love a recipe that's easy to throw together AHEAD OF TIME and just thrown in the oven before guests arrive allowing you to do other things.  Definitely a keeper.

This stuff is SO good.  I went ahead and just used the entire 8 oz block of cream cheese, and an entire 15 oz jar of alfredo sauce.  I upped the mozzarella and parmesan accordingly, and I added about a half teaspoon of dried basil.  The recipe makes enough to completely fill an 8 x 8 baking dish.  People LOVE this stuff.  My mother-in-law wouldn't stop complimenting my dip, saying how much better it is than the restaurant's.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  I've tried the other recipe on this site that's just as popular, but uses mayo instead of alfredo sauce, and this one is MUCH better.

This wasn't as good as I had hoped and definitely not as good as what I've had in restaurants. The Alfredo seemed to make the dip slightly grainy in texture and just seemed "off". I think we would prefer one of the mayonnaise based recipes for this dish. The roasted garlic was a good idea though.

Delicious, everybody always asks for the recipe, I've made this several times, but I add about 1/2 cup of mayo to it.

This was very good. The spinach was a bit overpowering in my option. Next time I will reduce to half the spinach. (I'm not big on spinach) but I did like this recipe.

After all the great reviews, I decided to make it for my hubby's football snack.  It was disappointing because it was tasteless and wasn't restaurant quality.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was just okay.  I followed the advice of others and used a whole brick of cream cheese, 16 oz of garlic alfredo sauce, and a little extra cheese.  I think I will try another recipe next time.

Like some other members, I use minced garlic since it's a bit easier. If you are a garlic nut, like I am, the garlic "juice" give s nice kick, too. 

I recommend combining the ingredients in a blender/food processor before pouring in a baking dish.

This is a new Thanksgiving tradition with my family as a dip for the football games!

I made this for a potluck, and it was the first thing gone!  It is ridiculously wonderful!  I used the whole package of cream cheese, like others did.  Also, I just used minced garlic, and I topped it off with a layer of the shredded mozzarella.  That makes it extra delicious.  I will make this often.  It is the best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had. . . that includes the ones at restaurants.

JUST LIKE THE RESTRAUNTS!!!  BUT SO MUCH CHEAPER!!!  I put a whole cup of parmasian chease and used the whole bag of spinich along with the garlic roasted alfredo sauce and it was PERFECT!!  Also, instead of using the whole garlic and roasting it, i just put in 4 tsp. of chopped garlic into the mix and cooked it up!  Was perfect with pita bread slices!

This one is a winner. I made it for a party for 5 people, and the whole thing was gone! I processed the artichokes with the cream cheese, and followed the rest as written.

I enjoyed making this dip.  I used part of this dip to make some stuffed mushrooms.  I took the rest of the dip and served it in a plain bread bowl that went well with the dip itself.  This style of serving is highly recommended for parties.  Easy to make if prepare correctly.

I initially was hesitant about making this because of the alfredo sauce (seemed odd to me) but this turned out great!  My family loved it!  I made it for a party and put it in the crock pot to keep it warm.  Will definitely make again during the holiday season!

Fantastic!  This was the texture I was looking for.  I used roasted garlic flavored alfredo and 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of the roasted garlic.

I served this at my housewarming and everybody loved. I did use the whole 8oz packages of cream cheese. Also for the Alfredo sauce I recommend Bertolli's. Which I also used a whole 15oz jar. Very good recipe.

Like another reviewer, I used the entire block of cream cheese and the whole bottle of alfredo sauce, just so I wouldn't have any left over.  Everyone at my party raved about the flavor and how cheesy it was- definitely a hit.  My guests seemed to prefer eating it with those toasted bagel chips instead of the tortilla chips

Definitely just like in the restaurants!
Family loved it.  I use more spinach, use the entire block of cream cheese and also the entire bottle of alfredo. This recipe is very forgiving.  Roast the garlic and yes mix it all in a bowl.  I am on my 4th time making it since finding this recipe a couple of months ago.

This dip was awesome!  Even better than some of the restaurants.  I actually put all the ingredients into a crockpot and set on low for a couple of hours.  So easy and everyone loved it.  I'm now asked to bring the dip wherever we go.  Thanks for a GREAT dip!

Wasn't that good.  I added extra Alfredo since it seemed a little chunky but it was still a little dry.  Won't be making this recipe again.

I first made this dip and printed this recipe back in 2000 when I joined.  It is absolutely delicious.  I also use Bertolli alfredo and the whole package of cream cheese.  For all of those non artichoke and spinach people - don't be surprised if you love this dip.  I just don't tell the kids what's in it.

Yuuummmmmmm!  I blended all the ingredients, except the spinach, in the blender to get a good consistency of flavor.  Add the spinach into the blender but remember the longer you blend the smaller chuncks of spinach you'll have.  This is one of my all time favorites!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I served it at a recent family function and all of my aunts asked me for the recipe.  I made a few minor changes, though.  I used minced garlic instead of roasting garlic, and I ALWAYS use the Bertolli Alfredo sauce.  I hope your family loves it as much as mine!

I made this for the super bowl and it was a hit. Personally I found it a little salty. I would like to try it with a better alfredo sause ( I think i used rago). But overall, easy and a crowd pleaser

This dip turned out GREAT! Me and my friend were like the more the better, so we ended up putting 14oz of spinach, 2 cups of mozzarella, and a full 8oz of cream cheese, and it turned out amazing! We didn't have to bake the garlic though. We just peeled and crushed it with our nut crusher. We will definatly be using this recipe again! Thanks alot for the recipe.

This was a very easy and tasty dip.  After it was mixed together, I put it my small slow cooker and let it heat all day.  Even my husband, who is not a fan of articokes and spinach tried it and he said it was very good.

This is an absolute HIT when I take this to parties and cook outs.  A friend of mine has me mix up a batch for his bday every year!  Sometimes, I add roasted garlic and/or sundried tomatoes if I want to give it a little "more" of something.  It is also easy to make a lot of at once and then freeze individual pans to cook up later.

This was so easy to make and I didn't have much left over; I can't tell you how many people wanted the recipe!
One thing:  Instead of using an actual garlic clove, I just used minced garlic and it tasted the same...

I made this one time for my boyfriend and I and it was AMAZING.  However, I made it again this past weekend for a superbowl party and it was just ok.  I think it had to do with the alfredo sauce I used.  I used a cheaper brand and the overall dish just wasn't as good.  I think I should have added more garlic too.

Will try again, but with a really good quality sauce.

I think this is the best spinach artichoke recipe I've tried.  The alfredo sauce adds just the right amount of moisture and flavor (not as dry as others I've tried).  I love cheese, so I added some Montery Jack as well.

I followed the other viewer suggestions and added the whole brick of cream cheese and only half the jar of alfredo sauce. I think next time I would go ahead and add the whole jar because it was a little thick but still very good.

I can honestly say I don't think this recipe needs any tweaking - perfect as is!! I will be making this for the 3rd time this Christmas season, and just like all other reviewers say, its gobbled up with many compliments!

I bought a chafing pot at Christmas Tree Shop (for you fellow New Englanders) for $6.99, and its perfect because I just light the tealights about ten minutes after its been sitting out, and it keeps it warm for the night! 

Cheers for one of the easiest, best party recipes EVER!!

I've tasted a lot of spinach artichoke dips.  Most are a little simpler with fewer ingredients than this.  But this one is worth the little bit extra!  I like to increase the mozzerella to about 1 1/2 cups, and the cream cheese to the full 8oz.  The roasted garlic is a wonderful subtle taste! LOVE IT!

we were very impressed with this recipe.  i even added the whole 8oz of cream cheese before I realized I was only supposed to add half.  So to compensate, I added a little extra alfredo.  I added a little more of the mozzerella and parmesan too.  I put the dip in individual ramekins for my guests and served with a basket of sliced french baguettes.  I also topped each ramekin with some mozzerella before baking and sprinkled them with some paprika for garnish right before serving.

This was absolutely heavenly! It was so good, i wanted to eat some with my coffee this morning! The only things i did different was cut the amount of alfredo sauce used ( i like it more chunky) & i added 2 more cloves of garlic, just because i love garlic. I also used freshly grated mozzarella & parmesean. It was quick & clean up was a breeze! A definite keeper!

I've made this twice now and both times it's been gobbled up.  The first time, I made it as written, but I made it again for a Thanksgiving appetizer without the artichokes and putting in 2 packets of spinach and a whole cream cheese.  I mixed everything in the magic bullet, spread it out to bake and voila, a fantastic dip.  Creamy and cheesy!  I usually make homemade tortilla and pita chips to go alongside.

Awesome dip!  I am not a fan of mayo and I loved that this dip does not use it.  I followed others advice and used a whole package of cream cheese.  I also added cheddar cheese and was very generous with it and with the mozarella.  Finally, I used a Parmesan-Alfredo sauce instead of adding parmesan cheese.  Oh, I also used all low-fat or no-fat ingredients and it tasted wonderful!  I put all the ingredients in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer, bake for about 45 minutes, and then serve in a sweet hawaiin bread bowl- yum!

I, too, used the whole package of cream cheese.  I also went ahead and added the entirety of the 16-oz jar of alfredo sauce, and the whole 8-ounce package of shredded mozzarella (it was more than a cup).  I used raw garlic minced fine, and I added a few minced-up green onions and some canned nopalitos, drained and rinsed.  The resulting dip is so rich and creamy and good.  I like the bite of raw garlic, but I will not use as much next time; maybe just two cloves.

Just finished making and eating this - it's fabulous!  I used the whole block of cream cheese and garlic powder instead of fresh.  I also used low fat alfredo sauce because that is all I had.  It is every bit as good, if not better, than any restaurant dip I have ever tried!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is better than any other recipe I have tried! TRULY restaurant quality...maybe even better! I used jarred alfredo sauce, marinated hearts, the entire block of cream cheese, 6 cloves of garlic, and fresh parmesan cheese. Instead of just mozzerella, I used an Italian blend of cheese.For extra zing I put in about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. My husband and I can make a meal of this! THANKS SO MUCH!!!

This is a great recipe! My friends rave over it and beg me to make it at least once every few weeks.  I like to use roasted red pepper cream cheese, and add in crushed red pepper flakes, chopped red onion, and chopped chili peppers. It's easiest if you just throw all the ingredients into a blender and have at it.  I serve it with fried pita wedges.

i made this dip using mostly fat free ingredients (everything but the alfredo and parmesan) for my memorial day get-together and it was a huge hit. Several people even said it was the best they've ever had. No one could even tell it was mostly fat free... i will most definitely stick to this recipe!

I started off by saute-ing about half of a big red onion with lots of butter. (I know, so bad!) and some white wine. I then added the spinach and atrichoke hearts to that and continued to haet through. I addded my cream cheese and let it melt in. I didn't have any alfredo sauce, so I used a combination of Sour Cream (full fat to get the rich creamyness, though I'm sure low fat would still have tasted great) and some good Mayo. Finally I added the motzza and let that melt in, followed by the garlic. I put it in a casserole dish, and sprinkled with the Parm Cheese. Because I was taking it to a dinner party the next night, I covered it with saran wrap, and refridurated.  I decided to heat it through slowley in the oven before serving. I I just the oven to 325 and baked for about 25-30 mins. Great! :)

I thought it was bland.  The alfredo sauce I purchased (Classico) might have been the reason I didn't care for it.  Perhaps a better sauce might do the trick. Need to experiment more.

Absolutely delicious!!! I didn't have time to roast the garlic so I just added a few crushed cloves into the mix and baked it all together. It turned out wonderful. Will definately be making this again!

I found this recipe ok.  Seems to be missing something, but can't put my finger on what it is.  Will make it again, but not "the best" I've had.

Made this again for a dinner party & followed the previous advice & added more cheese & the whole log of cream cheese & it turned out better.

This was very good.  I was unsure of how it would turn out and was tempted to change the recipe but didn't and it was the first dip gone at the super bowl lunch we had at work. I had several ask for the recipe!!  Will definately make again.

This was good. I read a lot of the reviews and agree with those who feel that the alfredo taste is rather strong, for me it didnt make the dish bad but I will probably try another reipe without using the alfredo.  I bought the roasted garlic (already minced) which was super easy.  One comment is that once the dip gets cold it is VERY hard/rubbery so you must either keep it hot with a buffet tray or eat it fast.

This is amazing.  It tastes like a restaurant made it, but much much better than the frozen ones.  I bought roasted garlic flavored alfredo sauce so I didn't have to take the time to roast the garlic. I also put a little raw garlic in because I love it.  I already bought ingredients to make it again.

This was good, not great. I agree w/ another reviewer who said the main flavor is of the alfredo sauce. Everyone seemed to enjoy it but to me it seemed to be missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.

I have made this dish 3 times in the last 3 weeks. It taste wonderful, just like in a restaurant. I use a full jar of alfredo sauce (not refrigerated)to make it creamier.
Update: It has been years since I first made this recipe. I have lost count of the number of times I have made it. Reciently I have started putting in the microwave for 5-7 min to heat it up and then finishing it in the oven for 5-10 min. Delicious and FAST!

This was the biggest hit at my Thanksgiving Dinner. I served it w/ toasted french bread and it was gone in minutes! I did go for a lower fat version by adding a low-cal. romano cheese sause, rather than alfredo, but it tasted just as great.

Followed this recipe as written (though did use reduced fat cream cheese and made sure to stir the ingredients before dumping them in a pan) and it turned out wonderful.  Guests loved it.  Goes very well with pita chips as scoopers.  Will make again when I need to bring a dip to a party.  Thanks for recipe.

I made this dip for my family and my boyfriends work. Everyone who tried it said it was great. I loved it also. Very easy to make and very restaurant quality. A must have!

good, not the best, but very good.  we had a hard time making it look presentable with the cream cheese on top--so we just mixed it all together after it was heated and ready to go.  Still tasted great and it blended the flavors  together well.  Enjoy and thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great.  It tastes just like the one from the restaruant that you can also buy in the frozen section now. Our family loved it and so did my co-workers when I took it to work for a brunch.

I love this dip. I use as much cheese as I like, but I cut down to 1/2 a jar of alfredo sauce. I also add a little bit of salt even though the chips I serve it with are salty. It is so great-trust the reviews on this one!

Great!  This definitely makes ALOT of dip, but all of it was devoured by 5 hungry people within 20 minutes.  The funny thing is, I actually forgot to put the cream cheese in!  I didn't realize until after the dip was all gone.  I couldn't tell the difference!  I can't imagine how good it will be when I make it with the cream cheese (or leave it out to cut back on some calories you won't miss).  Save time and use the Roasted Garlic Alfredo Sauce.

This has been a hit every time I've made it. I went with these modifications, use whole package of cream cheese, jarred roasted garlic alfredo sauce(omitting the complicated garlic step), and I used jarred marinated artichoke hearts. DELICIOUS!!! The dish is licked clean every time! Thanks!

Made this as a Christmas dinner appetizer and people were definitely into it while it was still hot!  Not quite as good reheated (as a leftover) so I'd suggest only making as much as you know/think you'll need.

Woo Hoo! Was this GREAT! I "doctored" it up a little, I used 1/2 fresh and 1/2 frozen spinach. I also used Roasted garlic Alfredo sauce. I also added fresh cracked pepper. This was a hit at a party, and I was hunted down by a guest of a guest for the recipe! Tasty!!

This is an amazing recipe that I get requests for every time I'm invited to a potluck.  I also blend everything together, rather than layering.  That would be the only recommended change.  Excellent!

Maybe I'm not doing it right, but it doesn't taste like what I'm used to using this recipe.  Had to add way more spinach and top with lots of cheese.  I'll keep tweaking, but I think I'm going to try a different recipe.

This was great and a big hit at my husband's office party.  I "tripled" the recipe as follows:  32oz frozen spinach, 16oz cream cheese, 32oz roasted garlic alfredo sauce, 5 tsp roasted garlic (from a jar), 4 cups mozzarella cheese, 7oz Kraft shredded parmesan/romano/asiago, 6oz real bacon bits, 3 (14oz) cans artichokes, and 1/2 cup milk to thin.  I stirred it all together and put in the crockpot on high for about 2 hours then turned to low.  Stir it occasionally and serve with tortilla chips.  This almost filled a 12 quart crockpot.  He didn't bring any home and had several requests for the recipe.  Will use this again and again.  Thanks!

This is much, much better than I've had in any restaurant or from a store. Those are just blah and this has great flavor. I like to broil it at the end for a nice crust on top!

Simply outstanding! I have been looking for a true "restaurant style" spinach and artichoke dip for ages, and this beats them all hands down. You can lighten it up a bit successfully by using the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, part-skim mozzerella, and artichoke hearts packed in water instead of oil. Just make sure you add maybe 2 tsp. to 1 tblsp. italian seasoning or maybe 1 tsp. Mrs. Dash to make up for some of the flavor lost when you reduce fat. But it's still good, I promise!

As Chandler would say: "OH,MY,GOD"  This recipe is great!!!  I looked and looked at all the recipes for this dip and decided on this one (because of the reviews).  My husband and I just finished it as a late night snack.  (Okay, we didn't finish ALL of it, but close!)  Anyway, here are my changes: Use fresh spinach (one bunch-cooked, then drained), mix everything together instead of layering, then after it's done cooking, sprinkle fresh parmesean cheese on top and put in the broiler for 10 additional minutes.  Beautiful browned cheese on top comes out, and the whole dip is excellent!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!

I have made this dish several times and even altered the amounts of alfredo, cream cheese, etc. due to the "what's available" factor.  You cannot go wrong! After it bakes, I usually broil it for a minute or two to give it that "restaraunt quality" look. I serve it with a mix of toasted and untoasted bagette slices (for textural variety) and serve the whole thing on a huge wooden cutting board.  It is always the first dish to disappear and the most frequently requested hors d'ouvre.

made it again this weekend using roasted garlic flavored alfredo...even better and cut the prep time!

This dip has no flavor.  I brought it to a party and only a few people ate it, and those that took it didn't even finish what was on their plate!  It needs some Lawry's seasoning salt or perhaps fresh garlic instead of roasted garlic.  I would never make this again.

Excellent recipe. It doesn't have time to cool before it's gone. I added sun-dried tomatoes and chose sundried tomato alfredo sauce to give it a little colour. Also, substituted Asiago for half of the mozzarella cheese.

This was really good.  I left out the artichoke because last time I made this dip (a different recipe), they didnâ€™t seem to have much taste.  Still came out good, served with wheat crackers.  Next time I want to try it with toasted French bread.

This was the BEST dip I've ever served.  Usually I alter the recipe a little, but I put it together as directed.  It was great!  My kids wanted to eat it as the main couse!  You have to try it -- you'll love it!  Wish I could rate it with 10 stars!

Absolutely the BEST spinach dip I have ever made!  It's a hit at every party, and everyone keeps asking for it.  I usually double the recipe, otherwise it won't be enough to satisfy the crowd! Another note is that I don't roast the garlic, I just add a few teaspoons of garlic powder. If I could give it more stars, I would have!

Very, very good. Please don't think less of me for this, but sometimes I serve this in a cake pan with corn chips and fresh crusty bread cubes...for dinner! My husband loves it, and it's so quick.  Herb and garlic cream cheese is fantastic in this. Beware of marinated artichoke hearts; they add a strong vinegary taste. This recipe is good even if you leave out the artichokes altogether.

This dip was pretty good.  Make sure that you like the flavor of the alfredo sauce that you use, it comes through a lot in the dip.

Ultra-tasty, and quite easy to make.  I prefer a fuller garlic flavor, so I used more.  I have found that the dip freezes very well.

This recipe tastes a lot like restaurant-style spinach and artichoke dip.  Very easy to make too.  I made this dip for our Super Bowl party and everyone loved it!

This is the best restaurant style spinach and artchoke dip ever.  I have tried other recipes and always have problems, many are too dry.  This is a very easy and excellent recipe.  A great hit at parties or just for the family.

This is absolutely foolproof.  I have always had variations on this dip come out dry.  I cook it in a heavy nonstick round cake pan and it makes a nice show when served on a big platter.  I add tons of garlic.  That's about all I changed.  I keep the Alfredo sauce in the pantry to make sure that I have the ingredients on hand.  My one variation, though, is to chop artichoke bottoms, because I don't like the stringiness of hearts.  I just cube them and they are perfect

This is so good! At first I thought 4 cloves of garlic would be too much, but it was just right. This is definitely better than the dip I've had in most restaurants.

This is better than any restaurant spinach artichoke dip I have ever had!  It deserves its five star rating.  The roasted garlic is what makes it special.  I served it with tortilla chips and my guests gobbled it up.

Very good recipe, I served on a buffet table to guests and I was one of the last people to get any food so it room temp when I tried it, was very good but wished it would have been cremier when I ate it.  Next time I will try it hot out of the oven.  I served it with hearty wheat crackers.  This is not low calorie appetizer and perhaps shouldn't be served with a a lot of other items because it isn't something that "stays out" on a serving table well.  Overall very good and I will try again.

I loved the garlic in this but was a bit disappointed. I mixed ingredients together and then sprinkled with parmesan instead of layering like listed, I wanted to be able to taste the garlic through out and blend the cheeses. I baked for 30 min and it wasn't cooked, so took cover off and baked 10-15 min more. It was tasty but more thick and chunkier than what I like. I even used a little less spinach than stated. I love spinach and artichokes but I prefer a different recipe I have. Don't get me wrong, it was very tasty but just not creamy or saucy enough for us. Thanks TerraD!

Have served this at a couple of parties already and it was a huge hit both times!  I used a little extra alfredo sauce and reduced the cream cheese to make it more easy to dip.

This was ok.  I'm not a fan of alfredo sauce and it was a bit overwhelming, even when using a smaller amount.  Make sure to defrost the spinach completely, or the cook time takes much longer!  The cheeses were a good combination, although I added more mozzarella and would have used less cream cheese had I known the outcome.

This dip was excellent.  I think it could use a little less spinach and artichokes, but it was great the way it is too.  The alfredo gieves it a wonderful creamy texture!  Thanks!

I made this dip for a party I had recently and everyone wanted the recipe. It was a huge hit! The garlic took a long time but it was worth it in the end. I will keep this one around! 
I added feta cheese to mine but that is just b/c I love cheese :)

Very good recipe.  I took one reviewers suggestion and used less spinach, also less artichokes and half a block of cream cheese.  
EVERYONE raved about it, even people who don't like artichokes and spinach.  I will make this again.  Thanks

Not at all like the one at Ruby Tuesday's.  It was okay if you really like artichokes.  I wasn't crazy about it.

I did not enjoy this recipe.  It did not taste anything like the type I've had at a restaurant.  All I could taste was the alfredo sauce.

Very easy. Very tasty. Makes a ton of dip and freezes really well. The second time I made it I added some salsa but I liked it much better without. This will be a staple for holidays and parties.

I was expecting this recipe to taste like a dip I had at a nice Italian Restaurant. It wasn't quite the same but it was still pretty good. I also only made half the recipe. That may have had some kind of effect on it. I'll have to make the whole recipe for a party.

This recipe was wonderful!  I took it to a traditional African-American potluck.  I received an overwhelming response.  It was a big change from the soul food dishes that I normally prepare.  I made a few changes, I used the whole 8 oz of cream cheese, I used 16 oz of Alfredo Sauce, every thing else I kept the same.  I served it with restaurant style tortilla chips.  It was delicious.

I brought this dip to an office holiday party and everyone absolutley loved it!!!!  It was a HUGE hit.  I tweaked the recipe just a bit...  I doubled the amount of cream cheese, parmesan cheese, and alfredo sauce.  I also used an italian blend of shredded cheese instead of just mozzarella and doubled the amount of that as well.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.

I've been looking for a spinach artichoke dip that was comparible to some restaurant styles for awhile. This one is BETTER! I used 8 oz. cream cheese instead and it was even creamier.

This recipe is the best!  Even my 10 month old niece could not get enough of it.  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday party and it was gone in a flash.  Only thing I would recommend is to uncover during the last ten minutes of cooking to give the top a nice golden color.

This is a good dip.My entire family loves to get this when we eat out,but now I can make it at home. It had a little too much spinach in my opinion, so next time I think I will cut down on that.

Great recipe! I Followed recipe as directed but switched cheese amounts, more Parmesan & less mozzarella, and also added about 1/3 c sour cream. The pretzel crisps were really good with the dip.  This will be my go to for a spinach & artichoke dip. Thanks for sharing Terran!

This was incredibly easy, even when I couldn't get garlic to roast.  I popped this in a crock pot for work with Ragu alfredo sauce and people still raved about the dip (I might get unsalted tortilla chips, though, to help lower the amount of salt).  This is a must-try if you want something easy to bring to a pitch-in.

I followed the exact recipe and it came out so delicious! My boyfriend who is incredibly picky loved it also. I love cheese, so I sprinkled some more mozzarella cheese towards the end and left it for an additional 5-7 minutes. Made some homemade tortilla chips and all I can say is this is going to be my next new appetizer I bring to all my gatherings.

I love this recipe. I have used it so many times. I think that the refrigerated Alfredo is key! I tried it once with the regular Alfredo that comes in a jar because it was the only thing my local super market carried and I won't do that again, even if it means taking an extra trip to another store. I've also done this in a Crock-Pot for Thanksgiving potlucks, just throw it all in, mix it up, and set it on high until it heats through - I usually give it about 2 hours, but I usually double or triple the recipe :)

Made homemade alfredo sauce and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Yum! I didn't bother with roasting the garlic, but I'm sure it would be delicious also!

It was very good but I would add a little garlic next time just to boost the flavor.

At first, I did not mix it, so it was very concentrated. But once I did it was very satisfying.

Big hit at a party I brought it to.  I did use a whole package of cream cheese and a whole jar of Alfredo.  I also added more mozzarella.

I really wanted to like this but unfortunately it missed the mark. I brought this to a party and it was practically untouched at the end of the night. I saw people throwing away what they did take. I was excited to try this with the alfredo sauce but it left a strange taste, and the dip was pretty much bland otherwise. I followed the recipe exactly, except added a full block of cream cheese per the recommendation of many other users and I eyeballed the amount of spinach because I had a much larger bag than 10 oz. Next time I'd replace the alfredo with the standard sour cream/mayo or greek yogurt mixture and increase the roasted garlic to 5-6 cloves.

Thought this would be really great having read the reviews, but it was a real disappointment. Definitely not restaurant worthy. Followed the recipe exactly. Tasted like Alfredo sauce with spinach.

Going to try this weekend...agree that could the amount of seasoning in the alfredo and then also adding the asiago and romano as well (sounds deliciously rich) be possibly too overpowering?  How about trying it with a reduced cream of onion soup and cheeses?  Would also like to try this tossed with grilled chicken and angel hair pasta or even the same on pizza crust.  Sounds like you could do a lot with this....

I'm so happy to find this recipe, it was delish! I have made versions of this recipe before and this recipe is by far the best. I love the addition of alfredo sauce.  I used a10oz tub from the refrigerated section and it was perfect.  Next time I will roast the garlic but due to time, I just used fresh raw garlic & it was fine and still tasty.  I also added some cayenne pepper & few drops of hot sauce & also added additional mozzarella cheese blend.  I too mixed it all up together and did not layer it & used entire block of cream cheese, per many of the other reviews. I also (per reviews) did not bake & put in my mini crock pot ~ PERFECT!

I made it exactly as written.  We did not like it at all.   It is not like any restaurant spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had.  It was too salty.   My husband and I had a few bites.  I'll never bother with this again.

this ended up tasting amazing. the only thing I changed was: whole 8 ounces of cream cheese, salt to taste, and I used prego Alfredo sauce because I already had it. I literally wouldn't change anything else about this.

This was good. I wanted to serve in a mini-slow cooker, so I heated all ingredients on the stove and then transferred to the crock. I added salt, garlic powder, garlic salt, and about 1tbsp lemon juice until it tasted the way I wanted. I prefer a fresher-tasting dip, but this was rich and was restaurant-style as promised.

I'm not a big fan of artichokes,  but my husband is, so I made it for him for the first time last summer,  and we both loved it. Only thing that I changed is using fresh spinach, instead of frozen.  It just takes a little longer to chop, but it's definitely worth it.  I'm making it for the third time right now. The smell of garlic roasting in the oven is also a plus. Will for sure make again!

This was excellent!  I used all light ingredients to keep the stats down and it still tasted great.  I never even got to have any at the party I brought it to because it was gone before I went up to get my food.  That's usually a pretty good sign that everyone liked it.  As a note, I cooked on stovetop and then put it in a crock pot to keep warm during the party.

I have only one problem with this recipe, I can't stop eating it.  I do agree however that half the alfredo and 8oz cream cheese is better.

This dip was fantastic and fairly easy to make. I added a small can of green chiles to add a hint of spice and I used the whole brick of cream cheese instead of half. It was so creamy and perfect with pita chips. It even still tastes great reheated in the microwave.

I will definitely make this appetizer again, my entire family loved it.  Changes I made.....I used already crushed garlic, and I used marinated (jar) artichoke hearts, I cut them up smaller, and I added some of the tangy amazing artichoke marinade to the mix, I definitely used a little more spinach, cheeses, and the entire block of cream cheese...it was amazing.  A huge family hit

I agree with MUIRZ1. I would rather leave out the alfredo sauce and use cream and asiago cheeses. Publix makes an excellent cold spinach and artichoke dip with the cream cheese and asiago!

It was OK, but certainly not memorable in a good way.  It was simply too bland.  The second day, I added Mrs. Dash and some more Parmesan cheese and it seemed to help a bit.  I will make it again, but follow others' advice and not use Alfredo sauce from a jar (even thou it was quite expensive).  I may even cut down on the amount of sauce.

Instead of a dip, I make this hot, toss it with fettucini noodles and top it with sliced grilled chicken and make "Spinich Artichoke Pasta with Chicken"    It is the best of two worlds.  You don't need a special occasion to make the dip, you can make it into a quick dinner anytime!!!  My husband's favorite!

I agree with Muirzi, the Alfredo sauce is very overpowering and it should be cut back and her suggestion about using the whole brick of cream cheese.  My first thought on this dip was the amount of calories this would generate if you really liked it and ate quite a bit of it.  Is the 153 for like a tablespoon .  My preference is to fine chop the spinach and artichoke hearts so that you're not biting into big chunks.  Good stuff.

This recipe was a success at home. I used slightly more Alfredo sauce, and less artichoke hearts just for personal preference, and it was delicious! I can't wait to make this for a party.

Made this for Superbowl and it was an instant hit.. Will definitely be making this for my family more often. Used cojita cheese (Mexican parmesan cheese) instead bc that's what I had on hand already.  I also choose four cheese alfredo sauce instead of reglar alfredo bc of other reviews stating that it overpowered the dish.. overall, five stars!!

Not bad, but lacking in flavor. Taste too much like Alfredo sauce. I'll use this recipe as a base to follow for the next time I make it.....but with double the garlic and more seasonings....missing something,  but I'm not sure what...

The alfredo sauce in this recipe gave me the idea to use it as a topping option for my potato bar.  I followed the recipe and just doubled everything.  The roasted garlic really pushes this over the top.

It was really good, but rated four stars because I did follow others suggestions. Added another half a block of cream cheese and used creamed spinach, was so good I didn't really eat anything else for Christmas dinner. I made it again tonight without the creamed spinach and I did feel like it was pretty thick with cheese.

So good! Definitely roast the garlic and smudge on bottom of the dish. The most important thing I've noticed is that it's important to use a large enough dish. When I've poured into a cuter smaller dish, it never tastes as good. Allowing the dip to remain shallow in an 8x8 or larger dish ((ideally 11x7 or 13x9) ensures the roasted garlic flavor is distributed and the dish bubbles timely.I've actually halved the recipe before as well and that's great.

I have made this do several times now.  I usually make a double batch because one just isn't enough!  It's super yummy and support easy!  I use fresh spinach so I don't have to squeeze the water out, but that's the only change I've made.

I live in Texas and all my ingredients were the HEB store brand.  I used the jar alfredo sauce (light version) and fat free cream cheese.  IT WAS A BIG HIT AT WORK,  It was basically all gone by the time our 12 hour shift ended.  The first time I made it I didnt buy the mozz cheese, I just grabbed the italian blend with asiago and parm.  It was still good. I just made it again for tonight at work using mozz cheese!  This will be the only spin dip recipe I will ever use!!!! I see that some people said to use the refrigerated sauce, and i will try that next time.  Even though I dont think the dip tasted weird with the HEB alfredo sauce.

It is ok, others liked it more than I did. I read alot of the reviews and comments and made some adjustments - used entire brick of cream cheese, slightly increased mozzarella, used Classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce and cut out the real garlic. Overall it wasn't good or bad. I felt the alfredo sauce was very overpowering and it was all I could taste, if I make this again I would definitely not use the same sauce, maybe half a jar regular alfredo. To be completely honest I found a different recipe and threw this one away :(

On the bright side it is very easy to make and has a lot of room for making adjustments to suit your taste.

Wow! This was amazing, I made the mistake of adding the cream cheese last, so it didn't break down very well! I also sprinkled some extra mozzarella on top before baking it. Cheesey delicious goodness!

Turned out great! I only gave 4 of 5 because the garlic roasting did not turn out the best. I will for sure make thus again. I did not get much because it was eaten so quickly.

I took this dip to a going away party and walked away with a name and phone number written on the aluminum foil - I kid you not. 

Needless to say, this recipe is a real crowd-pleaser. I even forgot the artichokes one time and everyone still gobbled it up.

I have been making this recipe for the past 6+ years always a favorite. I always use the whole block of cream cheese. Sometimes I use granulated garlic, no one has ever complained.  I mix it in the food processor or by hand, never layer it.  cook it in the mini crock pot or oven always perfect.

Ive been searching for years for a restaurant quality spinach artichoke dip and this is it! I think the roasting of the garlic is key. Only change I made was I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl before putting in baking dish. Absolutely delicious!

We have been wading through spin dip recipes trying to find one that replicates our favorite at a local restaurant and this one does it.  Just as a matter of preference, I left out the roasted garlic (it's hard on my stomach) and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Delicious! Thanks you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I always bring this to gatherings or parties, it is always requested and it is always gone!  I use minced garlic because I am lazy, and much more than the recipe calls for.  I also use a whole package of cream cheese and some extra mozzarella too.

taste was ok...i took the suggestion of another reviewer and used the entire cream cheese.  Which was good, but too much mozarella.   Was gooey instead of creamy.  Too gooey.  not a fan.   Will go back to my old recipe with sour cream and mayo.

Bland, not very tasty at all.  I used fresh minced garlic, didn't bother with the roasting step, but I don't think that would have made a difference.    Used the whole package of cream cheese.  A waste of good ingredients and costly too.   Will not make again

I've made this recipe dozens of times, sometimes following the recipe exactly, and sometimes tweaking, like adding crab.  This is my family's favorite.  I've been asked to make it for all kinds of functions.  I always double the batch, and there's almost never any left over.  I very highly recommend this recipe.  Now if I could just figure out how to remove the calories....*sigh*

I made this for a winter party. My guests seemed to love the dip and many asked for the recipe. This warm appetizer was more popular than the cold dips I made. 

I changed the recipe by adding more artichoke, which made the dip too thick. I used Alfredo sauce to thin the dip instead of milk so that the flavor would not be too diluted.

I've made this a few times now, without the artichoke and it is always the first to go. I've made it for a Thanksgiving and Christmas appetizer and for the boyfriend's Super Bowl party. 
Every time, it has always been the first dish to disappear. It goes great with regular tortilla chip and cheddar and sour cream chips.

Here's what I liked about this: it is healthier than most other spinach artichoke dips I've made in that it didn't call for mayo. The Alfredo sauce was a nice change and was not something I would have ever thought to use. What I changed about it: I used a whole package of cream cheese and I used two jars of Alfredo just because only one jar didn't look wet and loose enough to serve with tortilla chips (just personal preference). After taking it out of the oven, I put pico de gallo over the top of it to add another layer of flavor. The end result was amazing! You can also use fat free Alfredo sauce to cut a bit of calories.

I made this for our Super Bowl party yesterday, and it was a huge HIT.  I used the 10 ounce refrigerated Alfred sauce, used the entire 8 oz of cream cheese, and 1 1/2 cups Mozzarella.  Oh, and I used 6 closed of garlic.  I had to bake the garlic the entire 30 minutes. I made it ahead of time and refrigerated it, took it out about 15 minutes before putting it in the oven, and baked it for about 45 minutes.  We will definitely be making this again.  Served with tortilla chips/crackers.

Amazing! Hard not to eat all of it lol. Have made several times for gatherings. I served with blue tortilla chips, have also served with sourdough bread ripped up and pita chips. You can add sliced olives too. I use reduced fat cream cheese and a four cheese Alfredo sauce from Classico.

The first time I made this I used other reviewers suggestions and used garlic alfredo sauce to make things easier.  It turned out good, but the garlic and spinach was really strong. The second time  made it I used 1/4 less spinach, 1/4 more artichokes and I used 1/2 jar of regular alfredo sauce and 1/2 jar of garlic alfredo sauce. That solved everything and everyone LOVED it! I will definitely be making this over and over again! Oh and definitely follow the other reviewers suggestion and use the whole brick of cream cheese, it's sooooo good!

This I delicious and always a huge hit wherever I take it. It's good with tortilla or pita chips but it 100% absolutely pairs best with lavash. A friend's family had a store bought bag of lavash at the same party I took this to and it was a match made in heaven. 

I roast the garlic as others recommended. I also add more cheese, just for fun.

I made this recipe almost as written (I added more cheese) and I was not impressed. Made it for a potluck and was almost embarrassed to say u I made it. It was bland and runny. Will it make it again.  I wonder how it got such a high rating!

One of my favorite dips, This is an easy way to have it quick, fast and simple. Only thing I would change is adding a bit more garlic. This stuff is awesome!

I loved this.   Only thing I did , was use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese  and added 1 TBS of sour cream,
I used a soft Italian mix shred of cheese, ( all of I find at the time)  Ragu regular Alfredo sauce, and mine didn't take over the taste.   Everything else was exactly what the recipe said to do.  Also don't do this in the micro wave, do it in the oven like they recommend, I had to do mine a bit longer than 30 minutes.
I  sliced sour dough bread, ( one of those smaller ones) lightly buttered it then toasted it and served it with this dip
I sent some to the neighbor, and they asked me for the recipe

Wonderful, i made this for a pitch in at work, just warmed it in my mini crock, so delicious everyone loved it.  I did use the marinated artichokes and it still was tasty, i just rinsed the marinade off before chopping. Yum!!

This is delicious. I have made this a few times already and it never disappoints. I don't add the whole jar of Alfredo sauce, I use about a third and I add garlic salt, a tablespoon of sour cream and I use the whole package of cream cheese. I mix everything together after it's done in the oven and serve with fresh salted tortilla chips. Huge hit!

Love this and so easy. Be sure to drain the spinach very well. I usually pick up a container of Alfredo sauce from Olive Garden. Or if you are looking to save time, Bertolli Alfredo is a pretty good off the shelf option.

Very flavorful!  I used full 8 oz full fat cream cheese and 3/4 jar alfredo sauce.  I mixed all ingredients before baking in oven.  Next time, I will leave out Alfredo sauce & make my own with milk, sr cream, parmesan, & spices then heat in microwave. I would have given it a 5 - star rating, but I still think Connor's Steak House cream spinach is better.

I made this over the weekend for my boyfriend and he loved it!
i used Bertolli garlic Alfredo sauce and a whole brick of cream cheese.  this recipe can def be tweaked but is great as is! thanks
i served this with store brand ritz crackers and lime tortilla chips, he said he liked it better with the crackers as the chips were too salty. however, he ended up dipping his hot wings in it, so there's a thought LOL

i have made this several times now.  I have been told that it's better than what you get at restaurants.  

I was putting the whole 8 oz of cream cheese in because I misread the recipe, but other than that I only made minor variations for my own taste, like less garlic.  

Most importantly, I made my own  fresh alfredo sauce (heavy cream, butter, parm, garlic).  This made the biggest impact.

Very good recipe. I was disappointed in the flavor because my head of garlic was foo dry and did not roast well. I used a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes and the cheeses were still not melded well. I will make it again but will use a crock pot for a longer time ar a low temperature. Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe EXACTLY as written ... I was tempted to use the whole cream cheese packet but did not. Absolutely delicious. Everyone raved!! I think I may use more artichoke next time - just as a personal preference bc I love a chunkier artichoke dip.

Not impressed with this recipe. It was bland and the texture with all the artichokes and spinach was really chewy. More like a veggie dish than a dip. Made the mistake of making a double batch on the first time for a Christmas party.

Just wanted to say that I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I was asked it to make it for Christmas as well. I think I used 6 garlic cloves and added a bit more cheese, but otherwise made it exactly as written. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is so delicious I don't know how you couldn't give it 5 stars!!! You get so much as compared to what you receive in restaurants.  I baked mine in a large glass baking dish and it was a huge hit! Great for parties, bbqs, etc.  I have also tried it with shredded swiss cheese and I think I prefer it that way, although it is still fantastic with mozz cheese as well.  Thank you for sharing :)

I loved this recipe. Skipped the whole garlic process. I had some fresh spinach, so I smothered it in bacon and garlic. Drained the excess water from the spinach and artichoke hearts, added all other ingredients waiting until everything was mixed before adding the Alfredo sauce. I didn't add the whole jar, just enough to get the consistency I wanted. Turned out great!

Creamy and delicious! My roasted garlic didn't turn out, so I used 1 tsp. garlic powder instead. I spread the dip on small Boboli crusts and it was amazing. Definitely try this easy yummy dip!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 2 tsp of minced garlic, the jar of alfrado sauce was 15oz, and mix everything together. I'm not sure why you would spread the layers in.

This was very good!  I read another review and used a 15 oz of Garlic Alfredo sauce and left out the additional garlic.  It was a tad runny, so I'd recommend the 10oz of Garlic Alfredo sauce.  The size that is noted in the recipe.  It was great otherwise!!  I even put sliced tomatoes on top like the picture.

Dip was simply amazing... I used low fat cream cheese, and low fat alfredo sauce. I mixed in grated parmesean and romano cheese w/ some mozzerella. We just put this mixture in the crock pot on high for 1.5 hour.. it was ready just in time for our party.. We served it with whole grain tortilla chips, wheat crackers, & wheat thins.

This dip is not for me.  I made no changes to this recipe.  I used Alfredo sauce from a jar.  Jar alfredo sauce is not for me.  I may give this recipe one more shot ONLY if I make my own alfredo sauce from scratch.  Otherwise, I will not make this one again.

This recipe taste's just like the stuff you get at resturants! i added a little extra garlic and i cheated and just used "roasted garlic" alfredo sauce. Instead of Roasting the garlic in the oven.

Absolutely delicious, next time I make this I will add the whole container of cream cheese.  You must be a spinach lover or it may be too much for you.

Wow, this is soooo good.  I think the alfredo sauce makes it.  I made homemade alfredo sauce instead of the jarred, maybe that's what did it.  I don't know but this is delish.

I used the whole block of cream cheese, the whole jar of sauce, and only 6.4 oz. of marinated artichokes (all the store had). I was asked for the recipe. I think next time, I will add a few drops of hot sauce to give it a little kick. Thanks for the recipe! :o)

This was amazing, we made a batch for a Christmas party and loved it so much we made another batch for another party the next day! I don't think anyone can go wrong with this recipe, this has become one of our entertaining staples :)

We made the following substitutions/variations:

We served this with plain tortilla chips
We used fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach
We used minced garlic (bottled) instead of garlic cloves
For the second batch, we tried it with half as much artichoke hearts
We used creamy Alfredo sauce for the first batch and three-cheese Alfredo sauce for the second one.

This was really spectacular!  The biggest tip I can give if making this is use an alfredo sauce that you really like.  Alfredo sauce makes up a huge part of this dip so obviously if you don't like jarred sauce, don't use jarred sauce! I mixed everything together in a bowl and threw it in the crockpot for New Years Eve.  Low for 3 hours to heat through and then put on warm.  Everyone loved this!

This recipe was very good- however it wasn't as mind-blowing as I thought it would be.  I was really hoping for a restaraunt replica spinach dip- and while it was good, "something" was missing.  I am not quite sure what it was, but the final product was a little lacking in flavor.  I followed the recipe to a T, so maybe next time I will take some other reviewers suggestions on how to kick it up a notch.

I did not like the taste of this at all. Maybe I shouldn't have cheaped out and bought walmart alfredo sauce (Hey, it was near the holidays when I made this) but I feel like it shouldn't have been that bad. I will never-ever, ever make this again.

I hate store bought alfredo sauce.  I decided to give it a try using
 15 oz.Ragu garlic roasted parmesan alfredo sauce (entire jar) and used 1 8 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I used 1 cup mozz and 1/2 cup Italian 6 blend, 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan.  I didn't have garlic cloves so I used 1 tsp garlic powder instead.   Sprinkled a little more parmesan and Italian blend cheese on top and baked it till lightly golden.  Awesome!!!  Did not taste like store bought sauce with these modifications.  Always tastes better the next day.  
My new go to recipe.  It's for a potluck and I am saving some for home.  Ha!

After realizing how much it made, I thought there was no way that my boyfriend and I could possibly finish it all. But after we were done watching the movie it was nearly demolished! I love this recipe. Due to my garlic addiction I doubled the garlic, adding raw as well.

This is the first time I ever had Artichoke Spinach dip. I felt that it was missing something in the flavor department, but since first time maybe I just had higher expectations of this dip.

Delicious!! I used a little less spinach and had trouble finding refrigerated alfredo sauce so I used classico and it tasted great! Not overpowering.  I had to run some errands so I threw it in the smaller crockpot and came back an hour or two later and it was perfect! Thank you for sharing!

This was quite good, especially if you're a big fan of a very rich dip. I think that if I make this next time, I will add some sun-dried tomatoes to bring some more depth of flavour to the Alfredo-heavy taste of this dish. If you're a little off by measurements, it would probably be good to lean towards more artichokes/spinach and less of the other ingredients.

This dip was not very good. Do not try it unless you LOVE alfredo sauce. It tastes nothing like cheese and spinach dips at restaurants.

I've made many Spinach & Artichoke dips over the years...this one delivers!  I can only agree with the other reviews.  It really does taste like the dip you would get in the restaurants.

They key ingredient for this recipe is garlic! I dont used the Alfredo pasta sauce. Instead, I use 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayo and I use 8 oz of cream cheese. I add a little bit of salt, pepper and basil.

This is the BEST!!! Just like the dip that I have had in finer restaurants! My guests raved over it, I substituted minced garlic for the actual garlic. Read the minced garlic label for the conversion to cloves

OMG.......my daughter and I just made this.  No more friday's for us lmao.  Followed suggestions and used entire jar of garlic alfredo and entire 8oz cream cheese.  We added minced garlic and i will say garlic is a tad bit over powering but maybe i will use regular alfredo next time. Maybe not.........because it was still sooooooooooo good.

I loved this dip.  I think it made an awful lot though and I had 6 guests who couldn't even finish it.  Next time I will just reduct the amount, but it was delicious!

A great appetizer to make!!  The only change I made was on the suggestion of others to put the full 8 oz. of cream cheese in.  I put it in a small crockpot to keep warm & it went quickly.  Very good flavor!!!

So I get asked for this dish every single time I contribute to any event.  It simply is ALWAYS the dish that gets eaten, I have never had left overs with this dish. I often mix it up the night before, refrigerate it and bake it about 40 minutes before its time to attend the event.  I use 8 oz of cream cheese that I warm in the microwave to make it mix easier. And then when I'm done mixing I taste taste taste!!! And taste again!  Tasting before baking makes all the difference!!

Fabulous! For Thanksgiving this year my mother-in-law asked me to DOUBLE the recipe because it always goes so quickly with just the eight of us. Fresh spinach is always a great sub when it's in season-- if not frozen spinach works well. Love it!

This is a great tasting dip...the only thing I would do differently is add chopped red onions and make sure to really rinse the artichoke hearts...but really creamy and good flavour!

Made it for a pre game snack, we ate it for snack, entree, and dessert. It was delicious. I made my own alfredo sauce cause I'm picky. Not a big fan of jar stuff. I also added  water chestnuts, bc momma loves them. All the men loved it.

Stellar recipe, definite keeper and 'go to' for potlucks. Used the jarred alfredo sauce with garlic, used 1/2 c. parm. cheese, used 8 oz. cream cheese then added (to my taste lemon juice, about 3 T.) ALSO, and don't tell me how bad butter is please, add a whole stick of REAL butter. I did mine in a mini crockpot and it was so dang good! Add the butter :) Diet later ~

I love this dish, I make it at every party I throw.  I usually don't bake it, I just throw it on the stove until it's all melted and then throw it in my crock pot on warm, it stays warm and soft all night.  I always make a double batch because I want leftovers!  Definitely a winner :)

I absolutely loved this. I was in a pinch and used chopped jarred garlic so I'm sure the roasted garlic will make it amazing! This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!! My husband said it tastes even better than the restaurants, and requested this be put in the normal dinner rotation. :)
I used a 15 oz jar of garlic alfredo, a teaspoon of jarred chopped garlic, the full package of cream cheese, and put in a little less spinach and artichoke. So yummy!

This dip is fantastic.  So rich and yummy.  I have made several times and am always asked for the recipe.  Every couple of months I get demands from work to bring this in again.    I did use the large bottle of Alfredo sauce and entire package of cream cheese as others had suggested.  Excellent!

Awesome! Made this for a party, and all of the guests said it tasted better than the ones in the restaurant. I actually used a 'light' alfredo sauce and 'light' cream cheese instead of the normal stuff and couldn't tell the difference. This is a keeper!

I have made this a couple of times and people can't get enough. The dip is delicious. People are asking me to make it for all kinds of occasions now. I serve it with a mild white corn chip so that it doesn't overpower the taste of the dip. Delish!

FANTASTIC!! We always make this as an appetizer if we have guests over and they are drooling when it's all gone! I think the key ingredient is homemade alfredo sauce -- super easy and from this site! I make the dip a day ahead and then pop in the oven before everyone arrives -- delicious!

This is my go-to spin dip recipe. Everyone raves and I'm lucky if I even get to taste it before it's gone! I've made it several times. Sometimes I leave out the artichokes (hubby doesn't them) and double the spinach. Still yummy!

The only change I made was I used the full 8oz of cream cheese, like others suggested.  I'm glad I did because the alfredo sauce might have been a little too much for me.  Easy and great recipe.

this recipe was better than some of the restaurants that I frequent.(Especialy Applebees)
 I loved the idea of baking the garlic (of course, I threw in a few extra cloves) - My family and friends beg me to make this when we get together!

I served this twice in the past month and both met rave reviews.  Simply delicious!  Once you see how easy it is to make-and also the smiles- you'll make it again and again.  I also had some fresh basil and mixed it in.  Yum.

I added a little bit extra mozzarella on top and put it in the broiler to brown it. I then brought it to a party and it was all gone in an hour! It does taste like the one at Applebee's!

I have made this numerous times now and now it has become "my dish" when I'me going somewhere they ask me to bring this. In fact at work they planned a party just so I would bring it.

This recipe is incredible... I love it... I used several different modifications from the reviews (but it didn't need a lot of tweaking)... I also used the minced garlic from the jar in a small pan with a drop of olive oil for roasting... so simple... I LOVE this recipe...

This recipe is great on its own.  Do other things to enhance it, but the kids loved this dip.  And the wife and I thought it was as good as the one we order at the restaurant.  Yum!

I made this as an appetizer for my Mom's birthday dinner.  It was a huge hit.  After reading some of the reviews, I used the whole block of cream cheese, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My husband and I ate on it over the next couple days (it didn't last long) and it got better with each day.  Am planning on making this again soon for a get-together with some friends.

I made this recipe as written except I used more garlic (we are a garlic-loving family) and mixed everything together for uniform consistency before baking.  It was just OK.  The use of alfredo sauce sounded interesting but it wasn't cheesy enough for our family's tastes.  This recipe was worth the try, but not something I'll be making again.  I'm not a beginner cook, but no expert either so I'm not sure how to tweak this recipe to turn it into a 5-star.  I'll stick to our cheesy version.  Thank you for sharing.

I did exactly as the recipe said and it turned out really well.  The only thing I would change would be to put some parm. on the top so the top gets a little more cruncy.  This will def. be my go to recipe!

I have made this twice now and both times it has been BIG hits! It is so easy and so delicious. I took the advice of others and used the classico roasted garlic alfredo sauce as well as the whole 8oz package of cream cheese. It was amazing! I have had so many people ask for the recipe. I am not the best cook yet and was so pleased at the ease and prep time of this recipe. Thanks!

I've made this about 6 times. The first time I made it I had never cooked with garlic cloves, so it didn't turn out as good as the next 5 times I made it. So the 2nd time and everytime after, I used minced garlic (in the jar, name brand was spice world) I addded the equivlent of 6 garlic cloves... I don't think you can add too much garlic! I also used 2 full 8 oz packages of cream cheese and Buitoni alfredo sauce (from winn-dixie or publix) I actually used Olive Garden alfredo sauce once and it was amazing.... But everytime I have made it (even the 1st when it wasn't AS good) It was absolutely phenomenal. I made it for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it, a lot of people took some home too and called me that night and the next day saying how delicious it was!

This dip was a hit at our Thanksgiving get-together! I did make my own alfredo sauce, added basil and coarse ground pepper. Served with fresh veggies & crackers. Next time, I plan to serve with fresh bagel bites. Thanks for sharing!

Really liked this.  I prefer to have it with fresh baked french bread, but also served with Tostitos cups and folks liked that as well.  Did like others and used all of the cream cheese (8oz) and all of the Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce by Classico. Only thing I did different was add a few sprinkles of pepper and instead of roasting garlic per instructions added a few squirts of garlic paste.

This recipe is delicious! I made it exactly like the recipe said and it turned out perfect. Tastes just like restaurant dip. I took it to a party and it was a huge hit. I should have made a double batch cause it was gone FAST!

This was an awesome recipe. The only thing I changed because I did not have fresh garlic cloves I used chopped garlic that I had in the fridge.

I used minced garlic that I had on hand.. I know, I know, I cheated but this still turned out fantastic!  My niece said it was better than the same kind of dip they ordered at a restaurant before.  I think it is very important that you mix all the ingredients together before you put them in the dish to bake!  I added an extra cup of mozzarella and topped it with some shredded parmesan I had on hand.  After it baked in the oven for 30 minutes I put the oven on broil and let the top of it brown just a little.  There wasn't a bite left at the end of the night!  We will be making this for every get together from now on because it is so easy & turns out so great like you spent hours putting it together!

I make this for every gathering and everyone asks me for the recipe. I never have time to pre-roast the garlic so I just mix it in with other ingredients. I also cook it for about 10 more min. than called for. So good!

This is such a delicious dip and perfect for parties. I brought this to a party and it was gone within an hour. Everyone was raving about it and asking me to make more! I used a whole jar of ragu roasted garlic parmesan alfredo and it turned out great. The perfect consistency. Will definitely be making this again and doubling the recipe.

LOVE this recipe.  I too do a whole package of cream cheese, but when I triple it I do 2 packages not three.  Also, I use frozen spinach, but I thaw it, squeeze out extra water, and then chop it.  I use the minced garlic from a jar, and always add in more than I need, and a little garlic powder too.  Also, I always go overboard on the cheese :) Maybe I'm just from Wisconsin, but I add always more cheese. I also have done it with roasted garlic alfredo sauce, and the four cheese alfredo sauce. It is famous amongst my family now, and it's what I bring to holidays!

If I could give it a higher review I would. Every girls night I'm required to bring this dip or they won't let me come. Like others, I put the whole package of cream cheese in it. It keeps perfectly in the crockpot on low.

Great stuff. I grew spinach in our garden this year and put twice as much as the recipe called for and it is just fantastic! I'll never buy this again since I can make something better at home. Thanks!

5 stars because everyone raved over it, and the preparation was so simple! I served with tortilla chips and followed the instructions, except added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the top at the end.

Served this at a party and it was a big hit.  Like others, I used a whole brick of cream cheese rather than half.  I used Classico Alfredo Sauce but would like to try Bertolli to see if that makes a difference in the taste.  The Classico seemed a bit mild so I added more parmesan cheese to the dip.  I mixed all of the ingredients together, rather than layering as the recipe says.  I made the dip the night before and kept in the fridge.  I cooked a little bit longer than 30 minutes since the dip was cold.  Served with pita chips and wheat thins.  This one is a keeper!

WOW, so good.  Here's a good tip - put the parmesan on top instead of mixing it.  It makes a nice golden brown crust on top.  Serve on some french bread with olive oil spread on top and toasted in the oven.

Excellent! I only did two things different: instead of roasting the garlic beforehand, I minced it and just combined with the other ingredients. Also, I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used the entire package of cream cheese. My husband and I loved this recipe, and would've polished off the whole dish if only we had bigger stomachs. ;)

I've made this dip about 20 times already. It is the absolut best ever!! Everyone raves how good it is, and i'm always giving out the receipe. I just used whatever cheese I have on hand and it turns out perfect every time. My husband refuses to eat artichoke & spinish dip at any restaurant because none will ever beat this receipe!!!

I love spinach artichoke dip and I would always order this as an appetizer at restaurants.  Not anymore.  Now I can make it cheaper and better at home, thanks to this recipe.  The made two changes to this recipe.  I combine the ingredients together rathan than layer them and I do not roast the garlic, I just mince and throw it in.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dip is awesome! I modified it by adding some pesto to give it a kick! Also, the artichokes we buy are usually marinated which also add extra flavor! Other than that, this is awesome!

absolutely delicious. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe, but i used the entire 8-oz container of cream cheese. I also chopped and mixed all the ingredients thoroughly before i baked it. I served it with 9-grain and seed bread, whole wheat baked crackers, and Triscuits. I even faced my fears and used fresh cloves or garlic instead of minced or powdered. I'm so glad i made the extra effort! the result was perfect-- much better than any restaurant dip.

GREAT RECIPE!!!  I bring this to all party's and bring a recipe already printed out because everybody always wants it.  This recipes is easy and taste great.  I always use fresh garlic and the roast it I have tried it without roasting and you do not get a good flavor from the garlic so make sure you roast it first.  Another thing is only use BERTOLLI Alfredo sauce.  Add your other ingredients and you can't mess this one up.  ENJOY!!!!

This dip is great!  Every time I make it, it has gotten lots of compliments.  I like to add a little extra garlic though.

FANTASTIC. I am the kind of person who orders the spinach artichoke dip at a restaurant as a main course lol. This recipe was great!!! The best homemade version every (def. the best of the restaurant versions ever too). Delicious. All of my neighbors loved it too.. next time I'm making a double batch and we're not sharing :) Thanks for the recipe.

Like other reviewers I used the whole brick of cream cheese.  I chopped the the spinach and artichoke hearts then threw everything in my mixer real quick before i put it in the baking dish.  It was real easy and quick to make and it got rave reviews!  Thanks!

Very, very good!  It came out exactly as I expected and tasted delicious.  I was afraid the alfredo sauce would affect the flavor, but it blended in completely.

I made this only to discover my spinach was out of date! So I didn't use any and it was still great! I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.

Made this for a teacher luncheon.  It was gone in an instant.  When they ran out of stuff to spread it on, they ate it with a spoon.  It was a HIT!   It was a little on the pricey side.  I used the refrigerated alfredo sauce, and I doubled everything except the artichoke hearts.  Thanks for the recipe.

Was a big hit at the party and was quite easy to make. I used a jarred roasted garlic, mixed Italian cheeses and added diced tomatoes to the top after it cooked for color and texture. I gave it only 4 starts because I felt something was missing as it didn't have a huge flavor punch. Would make again but maybe add some hot pepper flakes or something.

I increased the garlic, decreased the Alfredo sauce since I don't like it as much.  Nevertheless, the ingredients in this recipe go very well together.

I love this recipe. Have made it many times now and it is still fantastic. The only change I make is using fresh spinach instead of frozen, but that is simply personal preference.

I love this.  It was exactly the kind I was looking for: creamy, full of taste and not overwhelming.  The only thing I did different was that I did not use artichokes.  I might later.  Also,  I read that someone said you need to have the alfredo from the refrigerated section.  I didn't have that.  I had 2 jars of alfredo that I hadn't used yet so I grabbed one of those  and it worked great. I don't think it would be that big of a difference as long as you like the alfredo that you buy.  I served this with tortilla chips and it's definitely a great appettizer or even a great snack.  This one is going to be made again and again in this house, ty terrad!

Great recipe.  I found the cream cheese taste to be a bit much so I added extra alfredo sauce and fresh grated parmesan cheese to balance it out.  This didn't last long.

This dip was awesome. I made this for Super Bowl Sunday..and everyone loved it! Super easy to make and super yummy. I think I may add Feta Cheese next time to this dip to give it a little extra something. But all in all, this was great!

I'm updating my review from 2010 (it is now 2020).  This recipe is a household, friend, co-worker, you name it, FAVORITE!! 

I am always asked to make this dip for people.  I make it for almost every family get together (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super Bowl, etc.). It is extremely easy to put together and tastes great. I've had lots of other spinach dips, none come close to this one.

This dip turned out excellent.  We felt it was as good if not better than our favorite restaurant dip.  I did as some others have and used a full 8oz block of cream cheese.  I dialed down the artichokes to 4oz, used a 1tsp of minced garlic instead of cloves, 2 cups of Sargento 6 cheese italian blend shredded, and a full jar of Ragu roasted garlic parmesan sauce.  I just thawed the spinach and tossed everything into a 2qt crock pot.  ~45 min later it was ready.  It was perfect!  Thankyou so much!

I thought this was a great recipe as did all my guests. However I would consider broiling a fort cheddar cheese on top, right at the end, as well as adding sundried tomoatos.

This recipe was a big hit with my family at Christmas.  I used an 8 oz bar of cream cheese and Bertolli alfredo sauce.  I very much enjoyed it but cannot decide if I favor it over another florentine artichoke dip on this site.

It didn't taste like artichokes--- it just tasted like chunky/stringy alfredo sauce.  Will not be doing it again.  I like alfredo sauce.  But, as artichoke dip- not good.

I realized after making this that I'm not a huge artichoke fan (I'd prefer the spinach by itself), but this was a hit at the New Years Eve party.  I toasted french bread with olive oil and garlic powder to spead this dip on.  I also added a lot more cheese.  I covered this until it started to bubble, the took the foil off so the cheese on top could melt.

This turned out to be very tasty! I used the whole jar of pasta sauce to make it a bit creamier and it was a total hit. Honestly, almost all of the partygoers migrated around the dip and stayed there until it was totally devoured. Try it!

This is EXCELLENT. I loved it. Used the whole bad of spinach. Newman's Own alfredo sauce and chopped up the artichoke's really small. The flavor was melded beautifully when I mixed it and let it sit overnight in the fridge before baking. Some sprinkled mozzerella cheese on top is a must. My husband, who hates anything that has cream cheese in it, and hates artichokes even enjoyed some it this.

This was okay. I made a few adjustments- no real garlic so I used minced garlic.  I would have liked more flavor, maybe more sauce, less spinach.

I thought this was a little bland and the consistency was not thick or creamy enough.  I'll try one of the other recipes that calls for sour cream or mayonnaise next time.

Recipe was fantastic! It came out absolutely amazing and it was delicious. I did make a couple of changes. I added a half squeezed fresh lemon, lump crab, garlic salt and garlic pepper to taste. I made this with some homemade garlic bread and it was to die for. I am keeping this recipe for a work pot luck or superbowl party. A definite crowd pleaser.

A crowd pleaser.  I made it on the stove top and later placed it in a slow cooker to keep it warm.  Great with tortilla chips and Club crackers.

Great Recipe!  I made this for our Christmas luncheon at work and I used a four cheese alfreado sauce.  I also doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough for everyone.  It was a hit.  Very yummy and very easy to make.

Followed directions and suggestions using a refrigerated alfredo sauce and doubling the cream cheese and mozzarella cheese.  It was good, but it wasn't the amazing restaurant quality some of the other reviews led me to believe it would be.  I brought it to a potluck and half was still left at the end.  I also had to increase the cooking time to about 45 minutes before cheeses were "melted and bubbly" but that may just be from the doubling.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a whole 8 oz pkg of cream cheese instead of 1/2.  I also heated it through in a 1.5 qrt crock pot - easy way to keep it warm through a holiday party.  Guests loved it!

Very good dip. Used full 8 oz package of cream cheese and might add more mozzarella next time, but will definitely make again!

Perhaps it was the fact that I didn't roast the garlic... just tasted like it was missing something.

Not exactly what I expected.  I guess it was a little bland.  I may try a little spice with it next time.  I am not even a spicey loving person, but it just lacked something in my opinion. Great base though, thanks!

Absolutely THE BEST! Everyone loves it and is surprised when they find out the "secret ingredient" is bottled alfredo sauce. It's always a hit. Just as good, if not better (and much cheaper) than the restaurants version.

This was pretty good def. better than the cream cheese only based recipes I've tried but a little on the bland side for us. The blandness could have been somewhat due to the brand of alfredo sauce I bought, I don't usually use alfredo so I wasn't sure which would be a good one to use. I also added some diced chilies and some chopped jalapenos to add some flavor and it was pretty good but still not quite what I'm looking for.

This recipe is excellent!  I doubled it for a party and it called for 2 packages of spinach but I only used one.  2 would have been too much spinach.  Excellent flavor and texture.

I have made this several times now, using a few variations.  Basically now I just throw in whatever ingredients I have that are similar to what is called for in this recipe - I always include the alfredo sauce, spinach, and mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I add artichokes only if I have them, and I usually use sour cream instead of cream cheese, simply because I always have it on hand. Regardless of what I add/don't add - this is always delicious! It is literally fool-proof, and is amazing with tortilla chips.

I made this for my baby shower with about 40people--I doubled it to serve 25 and had plenty (it was away from the other food since I was keeping it warm on the stove)   EVERYONE raved about it though, they thought it was from tastfully simple! I used 3 packages of spinach, 1 can of artichokes, 2 1/2 packages of cream cheese and 1 jar of Alfredo, plenty of garlic, salt and pepper   Im so glad we have left overs its so good! I served it with sliced baguette and Hawaiian sweet bread.

This is the best recipe of this dip that I have made!  Other versions haven't had enough flavor.  Even my friend who doesn't like artichokes OR spinach liked it!  I did add a little extra cream cheese, per other peoples reviews.

I made this recipe and just combined all the ingredients as others suggested.  It was the best I've ever made and the entire thing was gone in minutes!  I simpy sauteed the garlic in a pan on the stove top for 5 minutes, since I was pressed for time, and it softened it up just enough.  It was the perfect consitency.  Great recipe and so easy!

This is very tasty!  My family love it.  I made some for Super Bowl 09 and it has been a request ever since.  I made it with baked tortilla chips. I added more spinach and extra garlic, it is awesome.  A definite keeper in for my family.

A fabulous, 5-star recipe.  I did mine in an electric skillet, because I didn't want to turn on my oven and it was still superb!  The dip was still good lukewarm (better of course piping hot, but still great)!  This is definitely a recipe worth trying.  I guarantee it'll become a favorite.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  It was actually on the expensive side to make and it wasn't as good as I was hoping.  I followed the advice of others and added 8 ounces of cream cheese.  I think that detracted from the recipe because my dip tasted quite bland.  I also didn't roast the garlic and just added jared minced garlic.  If you're making it for the first time I would stick to the recipe and then make changes after you try it as written.  I doctored it w/o trying the original recipe and I think I would have been better off following it to the letter.  The presentation was nice, the taste was bland.

This recipe is great and extremely easy!  I made a lighter version with fat free cream cheese, Ragu's light alfredo sauce, and reduced calorie parmesan cheese.  I threw everything in a crock pot and cooked until warm.  It was a hit!  I was asked for the recipe by several girlfriends.

This is the 2nd time I have made this dip and yesterday it was a hit at a party.  I followed the other reviews and used the entire 8 oz of cream cheese. Update 11/27/16: Still making this dip and there's never a bite left! In fact, I've contemplated doubling the recipe for Thanksgiving.

Awesome recipe!  I did what others suggested with the whole jar of alfredo sauce and whole package of cream cheese.  I also used more spinach.  But it made so much, and I only made it for my husband and I, as I had a "craving" being pregnant.  I shared it with my friends/neighbors and they LOVED it!  They said it was the best Spinach and Artichoke dip they had ever had.  And they ate it 2 days after I made it.  :)    Great recipe!

Great recipes! Things I used: 15oz jar of brotolli garlic alfredo sauce, 10oz chopped spinach, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 8oz cream cheese, and a sprinkle of garlic salt.Mixed everything together in a bowl,then put into dish and bake for 30 minutes.I did not use articokes can't stand them. Really do not think the taste would have be better with them. The result was great!. After taking out of the oven wait 15 minutes before eating, this gives it take to cool and thicken. I served with orginal tortilla chips. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this for a party...HUGE HIT!!  I was pretty impressed with the way it turned out and everyone that ate it raved about it.  The only thing about the recipe that I didn't do was the whole "roasted garlic" bit as I decided to save some time and used minced garlic instead. However, I don't recommend it, it was a little too much garlic for me, and I LOVE garlic so that says a lot.  The next time I make it, I will omit the garlic all together because I feel the Alfredo sauce has enough garlic in it and if I feel like it needs more, I'll use garlic powder as another reviewer did.  Also, I was a little confused as to how much cream cheese was needed for this recipe; I understood half a container of an 8oz package so that's what I used and after it was finished, I felt like I could have used the whole container and it would have been just fine.  Either way, garlicky or not...the folks at the party ate it up!!!  KUDO'S TO THE CHEF WHO CREATED THIS RECIPE!!

This was great!! I this made for a movie night and we ate it with tortilla chips.  We had left overs and I ended up mixing a little of it in with some more sauteed spinach to make a sort of creamed spinach (also great!)

I thought this was alright but not as good as other dips I have tried. I thought it was a little too cream cheese -y. Anyway, it was pretty good anyway thank you!

Very yummy, but needed more garlic flavor for my liking. After I tasted it I added some garlic/rosemary grinder to it.  Next time I might try with minced raw garlic.  Also the dip needed a little acidity to cut the richness.  I will try a little lemon juice next time.  As is though it is still a pretty delecious dip.

So good and cheesy and yummy.  My family devours this when I make it.  I've made it about 6 times now, and it's one of those recipes you really can't mess up.  I like to mix all the ingredients together instead of layering them.  I reserve some mozzarella cheese to sprinkle over the top, and I add some chopped tomatoes on top as well.  This will be gone in fifteen minutes!

I didn't roast the garlic.  Instead I just cut it up and put it into the recipe along with garlic powder and salt.  I also cooked it on 400 degrees for about an hour.  I mixed all ingredients together instead of layering them.

I made this tonight for my daughters sleep over the girls loved it. The only things I did different was use 8 oz of cream cheese and more mozzarella than it called for we are cheese lovers, I also added some garlic salt,pepper and a little onion powder.I used roasted garlic parmesan alfredo sauce.I think it is just as good as one of our favorite restaurants.

This is really good.  We made it once about a month ago for a small get-together and since then we've had several requests to make it and bring to other get-togethers.  Must be good to have people specifically call and request that you bring it.

This is an excellent recipe.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella and it was perfect.  Next time I may add more garlic cloves.

Pretty darn good. Not the very best I've eaten (I think Mimi's still takes the gold medal), but probably the best home made effort I've tasted. I added some extra garlic (probably doubled) and mozzarella cheese (an extra cup or so), but nothing that would really change the recipe too much.

Absolutely fantastic.  I use the alfredo sauce with fire roasted red peppers and it gives it a nice little zip on the flavor.  Excellent recipe.

i was craving something that came close to applebee's spinach and artichoke dip, and came across this recipe.  i only used 4 oz of cream cheese, and used a jar of bertolli's garlic alfredo sauce (so i could omitt the roasted garlic). i also squeezed the spinach between my hands over the sink so the spinach was just moist, not wet, that might be why people complained of it being too soupy.  my husband and i thought it was even better than applebee's!

I loved this recipe because it does not require mayo (which I loathe).  I mixed all of the ingredients in a food processor before putting in the baking dish.  Next time, I will be adding a little jalopenio because I like spicy dips, but this was delicious and very easy.

What I did different: fresh crushed garlic and I made it in a slow cooker. The garlic and salt content was very stong at first, but after an hour in the slow cooker it was perfect! Melty, cheesy goodness; yum!

Delicious! I might add a touch more garlic next time but my friends went nuts over this. I served it in a hollowed out loaf of King's Hawaiian bread (used the insides for bread pudding and french toast- yum!) and it looked really pretty. This was great with flour tortilla chips.

This is a great dip! I have people over every thursday and made this last week for the first time. It was finished and I wished I had leftovers. This week I'm making double and maybe even triple!! The only thing I changed was to use extra garlic because I love garlic.

This turned out awesome!  I made it for a family party, and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  (I should have made a double batch!)  One tip: the recipe calls for 10 oz of alfredo sauce, but the store only carried 15 oz jars, so I almost out in too much.  If I hadn't noticed, the dip would have been ruined.  I have to say, this is the best spinach dip I have ever had.  I served it with veggies, tortilla chips, and pita bread.  Highly recommended!

Followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a whole 8oz container of cream cheese. For the alfredo sauce i used Classicos four cheese alfredo in the glass container. Just used about 3/4 of the jar. This was THE BEST spinach dip Ive had in a while. Def. comparable to restaurants maybe even better! Easy to make all my guests loved it on St Pattys day... Used it for the GREEN (spinach).... no left overs!!!!

Excellent dip! I wanted to add some zing to it so I replaced some of the cheese with a half cup of pepper jack. I think next time I'll do a full cup of pepper jack.  Yummy!

I used thawed frozen artichoke hearts because the only canned ones I found had spices and herbs in them. I loved this recipe-hubby and I made it for a movie night and ate it with french bread. It is a hundred times better than the pre-made or frozen kind and very easy to put together. Thanks for submitting!

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it got rave reviews!  The only modifications I made was to add a little extra shredded cheese and I also increased the cream cheese by 1/2. I kept it warm in the crock pot.  My father-in-law said it was the best he'd ever had!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This one is a Keeper! It was just as good if not better than the one's I had tried in the restaurants. The Alfredo-style pasta sauce make the dish.  Next time I make it, I think I will have to double the recipe because it went fast in this house.

This was pretty good, but next time I make it, I will add some seasoning. I added about 6-7 cloves of roasted garlic and I wish I added more. I love garlic, though, but it is good for you! I think some onion and maybe some cayenne pepper might be good, but I wanted to try the recipe as is first.

Easy and yummy! I cooked mine in a skillet instead of baking it because I was taking it to a party so I transferred it to a small-crockpot-type thing to keep dips and such warm. I also didn't roast the garlic, because I like a more strong garlic flavor, though it would be good roasted too! I just sauteed the garlic cloves and added the frozen spinach, which I covered and allowed to steam. Then I mixed in the other ingredients, the whole jar of alfredo sauce and the whole block of cream cheese. Added freshly ground black pepper and a bit of hot sauce to taste.

This recipe was pretty much amazing! We used it to make mushroom caps and it blew me away! We made it with the extra cream cheese as other reviewers did. For the mushroom caps we pressed a teaspoon into a mushroom cap, and topped each one with a cooked shrimp. We placed all the filled caps into a baking dish, and then poured herb butter over every cap with a little into the dish itself. Top with liberal amounts of shredded mozzarella cheese, and bake at 400 for 7 minutes. It was a really rich dish, but very yummy!

This dip is awesome! It really does taste like that you order as an appetizer from the restaraunt.  This dip doesn't stay around long at all!!

This dip is awesome. Every time I make this dip, it is gone within minutes. When I make it, I use 3/4 jar of the alfredo sauce, a whole block of cream cheese, about 1 1/2 cups of mozz. cheese, and then follow the recipe. It is VERY GOOD!

This recipe was really good!  Like others, I used the whole package of cream cheese, which I thought worked well.  I mixed everything together before baking, and mixed it all again when I served it, which helped improve the texture.  I used a combination of garlic powder and minced garlic, as I didn't have time for fresh garlic, and it turned out well.  I thought it was much, much better the second or third day, which is all the dip lasted.

I made this for a Super Bowl party and the entire dish was gone by the end of the night! I added a touch of nutmeg to round out the flavors, and it was delicious! Everyone said how great it tasted! I will definitely make it again.

I have made this several times for parties and every time, it's gone.  I have made it with and without the roasted garlic (I forgot to buy some) and prefer it much more with the garlic.

This is a 4.5 star recipe.  .  I mix together all the ingredients in a bowl but reserve 1/2 c. of mozzarrella cheese to sprinkle on top along with some extra parmesan.  I bake for 30 min, then I put it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the cheeses.  I serve this with sourdough bread.  Yummy.

This was absolutely amazing! I have never heard so many "oohs" and "ahhs" from my friends.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated with only 1 change (added the full container of cream cheese like other reviewers recommended) and this turned out to be the best dip I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend this recipe for any get-togethers or parties because it makes a large enough batch but it is such an eazy recipe that any one can make it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe! This is definitely one to share with all who love to cook!

Do not use Classico alfredo sauce! It made the whole dip unappetizing. Other then that mistake, the recipe turned out pretty good

Tastes just like it came from a restaurant, just as it suggests. Made a ton of dip, and was very tasty. Next time I don't think I'll use marinated artichoke hearts.

I used a little more garlic, but still a great recipe! We order this all the time at restraunts. I am so happy to have a recipe for it at home, the few other ones I tried turned into miserable waste of ingredients, so this one was a definate positive!.

I mix everything into a smaller crock pot and then heat it up in the microwave for about 7 min until the cheese is melted.  Turns out just as good and takes less time.  YUMM!

Very tasty! I lightened it up a bit by doubling the spinach and using low-fat cheese, cream cheese, and alfredo sauce, and I added 1 lb. silken tofu to the mix before I put it in the oven.  You couldn't even tell it was there, and it was so filling that I ate maybe 1/16th of it. I also doubled the garlic... Roasting it really does make a big difference!

Pretty good.  I doubled it, however next time I will double it but only use 1 can of artichoke hearts.  I love artichokes but they are overwhelming in this for my family.  We all really love them so that was quite a surprise! I also added 1C chopped Monterrey Jack cheese.

Was a hit at a baby shower that I co-hosted for about 30 people and had no left-overs.  I doubled all the ingredients, mixed everything up, refrigerated overnight and cooked on high for 2 hours in crockpot the next day.  Omitted roasted garlic and used Bertolli Alfredo Sauce w/ Garlic and maybe 1/2 tsp of garlic/black pepper salt.  Did not thaw and drain frozen spinach either and texture still turned out fine.  Giving this recipe 4.5 stars for ease of prep and flavor.  Don't know yet if this is the "the best" recipe for this type of dip so did not give 5.  However, will definitely make again.

The best at home "Spin Dip" I have made so far.  I think next time I will use even more Alfredo, as my cousin who works at Applebee's said that is their secret.  This is a good start to that end though.

This was very good. I gave it four stars because I added some onion & sprinkled garlic salt on top. It was missing *something* though, so I need to try it again & see if I can give it some kick. It was definitely restaurant quality, though!

This dip turned out amazingly delicious! for our personal taste though, I added a couple teaspoons of Rooster Sauce (Chilli Sauce) just to give it a little kick.

I made this dip for a Christmas party and it was delicious. I did use the whole package of cream cheese and a 15oz can of alfredo sauce. I also chopped the garlic and just mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients and baked all together instead of baking first. I will definately be making this again! Thanks

Good dip!  I followed the other suggestions, used Bertoli refridgerated sauce, a whole package of cream cheese and cut down the amount of spinach.  It was very creamy and tasted great!  I think the garlic is a must.

I made this for a Christmas party. There wasn't even a drop left! I used 8 oz. low fat cream cheese and I don't think anyone could tell. I also added an extra clove of garlic. Everyone raved about it and loved it! Served with homemade pita chips from this site. Excellent!

I took this dip with some tortilla chips to a potluck surprise birthday (didnt bake it until i got there) and NO ONE could get enough! Everyone asked for the recipe and said it tastes just like, if not better, than the ones from restaurants! I was weary about the alfredo sauce but that must be the secret used in restaurants because it was PERFECT! Definately not a figure-friendly recipe, but if its just once in a while, its worth it!

I made this last Christmas for my family; my girls are picky and they both said I could make this again next year. My oldest daughter even said that she wanted the recipe to make for her friends. I did use a package of Knorr Alfredo mix and made that according to pkg directions instead of the jar alfredo.  I did also put this in a small crock pot to keep warm. 
I will make this again.

This was a fantastic recipe by itself, but my fiance and I are onion lovers.  We halved the cream cheese and subbed in sour cream, and added half a medium red onion to the mix.  I also added a little paprika to the mixture as well as paprika and cheese on top.

This turned out excellent with a few changes. I used 2 pkgs of spinach, no artichokes, 1 tsp of minced garlic instead of cloves.  I also used 16 oz of Alfredo sauce instead of 10 oz. I creamed everything together and then put in the dish to bake.  With the changes I made it turned out better than some of the restaurants we've ordered it in.

Fantastic.  It's exactly what you want in a spinach dip.  My husband and a friend's comment when they first tried it said "this is restaurant good!!".  I laughed and told them the name of the recipe.  I didn't add the parmesean cheese... instead I added "Kraft"  Italian shredded cheese, 4 cheese in place of the mozza cheese and just topped it up 1/3 of a cup.  Very good!

I ABSOLUTLEY loved this recipe, i have been looking for a good spinich articoke dip!  The only thing i changed was added an entire package of the cream cheese, added a little more garlic (just because i LOVE garlic) and a little more parmisan and mozza. great recipe!

DELICIOUS! The only change I made was to increase the cream cheese to a full package. Thank you!

I just made this recipe for a retirement party, so had to make enough to serve 50 people. I used the calculator to reconfigure the ingredients, and even in such a large batch (2-9x13 baking dishes!) The dip was perfect. I did add about a half a teaspoon of garlic salt for kick, and garnished it with finely diced tomatoes. A for sure hit at any occasion!

We love getting this appetizer at restaurants and finally found a recipe that is as good, or better than at our favorite restaurant!  I made this for my son's first birthday and it was the first thing gone! Everyone kept coming back for more!

Absolutley Delicious...the only adjustments I made were: cutting the cream cheese to 4 oz and adding 1 heaping TBSP of mayo. All the flavors blend very well together and just as you suggested...it tasted exact to the big restaurant chains I've eaten it at.

really good and super easy to make. I did not roast the garlic though; however, I did use garlic flavored alfredo sauce and it tasted great.

This is fantastic! As previously commented, I would advise using a less spinach than the recipe calls for--otherwise, it is a delicious dish.

This was amazing. I didn't have time to roast the garlic so I just minced it and added it to everything else, and that was just fine. I made the dip the night before and baked right before I needed it.

I made this dip for a party and doubled the recipe.  It was a hit and everyone loved it.  I thought it tasted just like the dip you find in some of the restaurants I've been to.  I made mine in the slow cooker and it tasted great!  The only thing I changed was that I added the whole block of cream cheese.

This was very yummy. Silly me, I forgot to chop the spinach! This made it hard to eat so try to remember to cut the spinach before mixing it in. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 fresh spinach (10oz bag) and half frozen and 2 cans of artichokes. I also added a few tablespoons of plain yogurt, some black pepper and a few drops of Tabasco sauce. Be careful not to add any salt because it is very salty as is. Doubling the recipe made way too much, I'd stick to how it is unless you have a huge party. I garnished it with fresh diced tomatoes and lemon wedges and served it with some french bread slices and wheat thins. It was a hit!

This was absolutely the best I have ever had. I used the Bertolli garlic alfredo sauce in the jar, and it was wonderful. It makes a lot, so it is great to take to a potluck. I cut up and toasted some pitas with olive oil for dipping, and it was fantastic. A huge hit at a neighborhood get together. Easy and delicious!!

This is the BEST dip ever. The only thing I do different is I use all of the Cream cheese. Also make sure you get Bertoli Alfredo sauce. All my family and friends love this recipe. I make it for every event usually a double batch and there is never any left.  ~YUMMY~

This was a little bland. I used the garlic alfredo sauce, which i regret.  it didn't have a great flavor to begin with.  i also added extra garlic, which i thought would make it pop - but eh.  it needed salt.  i also added a touch of nutmeg, which did give it a nice hint of flavor.  this was good, but next time ill use a high end alfredo sauce and add some additional salt.  presentation was good.

I cut down on time by using pre-roasted garlic from the jar.  Sometimes I just use regular jarred garlic, and it's still good and ready in less time.

This is the best Spinach & artichoke dip I've ever had. Everyone loves it! It really does taste like what you get at a restaurant.  I usually put it in a crock pot and add a whole jar of alfredo sauce so it doesn't dry out.

I might be a little late, but if you haven't tried this recipe yet then it's a must! It is so easy, and I have yet to make it where it doesn't disappear right away. I usually  make it without the artichokes and I have tried a million crackers and pieces of bread to go with it. Fabulous!

This recipe is great! Didn't measure out ingredients exactly and it came out great.  I used more garlic, but didn't have time to roast it. I'm sure roasting the garlic would be a good addition. I took the advice of other reviews and bought the garlic alfredo sauce. Will definitely make again!

This recipe came out awesome! I took someone else's advice in one of the other reviews and skipped the roasted garlic step and used the garlic alfredo sauce from Classico instead. It came out perfect. I served it at a party both with tortilla chips and in a bread bowl and both were loved by all!

I am trying to find a better recipe than this one, and I am coming up short.  Add a little more garlic if you wish and it will be even better!  Oh, and be sure to roast the garlic first.  It makes a difference!

This was the first time I had ever tried making a warm spinach dip and I must say that I was impressed! I did change a few things. I used roasted garlic parm. cheese sauce, as that was the closest I found at the local grocery store! I also took some shortcuts like using about 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, approx. 1 1/2 cups of "Italian mixture"(moz.,parm.,& provolone) cheese, and a little mild cheddar.  The primary reason for using the "mixed" cheese was price.  It was cheaper to buy the bag that buy the cheeses separate.  I will make this again, it was wonderful!!!

This has got to be the best find evr on the site. I made this for a family gathering on Sunday. I served this with pitas that I sliced into triangles and coated with an olive oil spray and sprinkles a litle garlic powder on that. Then I toasted them in the oven for about 10 minutes. Totally tastey. Not a morsel was left. Thank you so much for this wonderful addition to my recipe collection.

I'm asked for this recipe every time I make it for a party!  It is the first on the table to go.  I serve it with sliced baguette bread brushed with butter, toasted in my broiler.  I add more Parmesan cheese  and garlic than the recipe calls for and I chop the artichokes into smaller chunks...I throw everything together, stir and throw it in an Earthen casserole crock, and serve in the same dish. BEAUTIFUL

I cater small events for friends and family and am always looking for great new crowd pleasers. This is defintely the way to go. I was a little concerned using jarred alfredo sauce but the dip turned out wonderfully! It truly tasted like the great dip you get in restaurants only better. I got so many compliments on this recipe which I served with sea salt bagel chips. I also used marinated artichoke hearts because I was making such a large batch and that's what Sam's had available. YUMMY!!

I followed the recipe exactly except for one minor change: I used the entire 8-ounce package of cream cheese.  The dip turned out beautifully.  According to my family, it tastes better than the one in restaurants!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

A delicious dip that I will definitely make again.  It was a bit thicker, less creamy than "restaurant-style" dips.  The combination of ingredients was yummy.  We served this dip with tortilla chips.

I made this exactly as it is printed with no alterations.  I gave it 3 stars because while it was good, it seemed to be missing something for flavor it just did not have zing!  It was very creamy, and cheesy. But seemed a bit bland.  I will be searching online for other recipes to see what spices are used and maybe try it again with some spices for more flavor.  Most dips I have had when dining out seem to have something that is a distinctive flavor making it just seem awesome.  Do take into consideration that my DH and me seem to like things a little spicy.

I have prepared this incredibly easy to make dip several times and get the same response every time, "The BEST spinach and artichoke dip I have ever had!" The Alfredo sauce is what does it. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!

I thought this was excellent.  I'm sure it's just as good if you do as the recipes suggests... but in our case I did 3 garlic cloves instead of 4... I think next time I'll go w/ all 4.
And I also used half a package of chopped spinach, and it was plenty.  But that all depends on your preference.Thank you for sharing this recipe, will definitely be using it again!

This recipe is the best!!  I have made it several times for family get togethers & I never have any left!  Everyone always says it is the best spinach dip they have had!  The only thing I didn't put in was the artichokes, since we don't care for them.  I did mix all the ingredients together before putting in the casserole dish and baking.  We usually serve this with tortilla chips & king's hawaiian bread...YUMMY!

This is one of the easiest and best tasting dips to make. I combined everything in a slow cooker - stir occasionnly - added a few drops of hot sauce (Texas Pete here in the south works great!) and not one drop of the dip was left. Make this dip you will be the talk of your party!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I wish I could give this ten stars! It is without a doubt THE best recipe I have gotten from this website. I made it for a St. Pattys Party and it was gone so fast and nearly every woman in the room was asking for the recipe! I hate mayo, so this was such a nice substitution!! I followed the recipe to a "t" and it was amazing! I cannot say enough great things about it. Thanks SO SO much for sharing it!!

Oh my goodness! The search for a great Artichoke and Spinach Dip stops here...this was so good! I added more garlic and sprinkled parm cheese on top and served with a french baguette. Had it for dinner two nights in a row...the best!

Easy, Quick, and sooo tasty! I've made this numerous times & is a big hit. 

I've made it different ways, depending on who its for and what is on hand. I've omitted the artichoke before - and once I even omitted the artichoke AND the spinach for a really picky eater! Thanks for the recipe.. I'll probably never search for another spinach dip again!

WONDERFUL!!!!  This was one of the best Spinach and Artichoke recipes.  I loved the alfredo sauce & cream cheese ingredients over the usual mayo/sour cream.  I didn't have a problem with it being runny.  You need to make sure you drain the spinach REALLY well!  SOOO GOOD!!!

This turned out tasting great.  However, the next day (if you have leftovers), it turns out being runny.  My recommendation is that you bring it to a party where there's going to be a decent sized crowd instead of just making it for a group of 8, like I did. Stupid!  I had way too much left over, which surprised me.  Oh well, I still enjoyed it the next day-the runniness of the dip didn't stop me!

Huge hit at a Superbowl Party.  I give it five stars because I didn't even get to try it...it was gone by the time I went back!  I used extra roasted garlic and a whole package of cream cheese.

This was fabulous and so creamy. I don't like artichokes so I left them out. I used a whole jar of alfredo sauce and used a italian cheese blend. I took it to a Christmas gathering and it was gone within minutes.

Well, what can I say that the other 1,015 have not?  I love this recipe and make it for Super Bowl and the guys fantasy football draft party (and other various occasions).  I do not roast the garlic, simply use my garlic press.  I use jar alfredo sauce, whatever is on sale. Sometimes I add green chile's for a kick.  One of the best homemade dips I've ever had!

I was indeed a little bland.  I used garlic and parmesean alfredo sauce. I think next time I will add some pepper flakes and sea salt.  This is a very good recipe, but it is indeed missing something flavor wise.  Everyone loved it and went fast during my Super Bowl gathering.

This recipe is amazing!  The dip turned out perfectly and was very easy to make.  The only part that was time-consuming was peeling the garlic from the skins.  I would definately make this again.

Changes I made: used a whole 8 ounce container of spreadable cream cheese- made it easy to mix everything and was probably lighter, used almost double the mozza and parm- made a huge difference in flavor I think. I also used a few splashes of Frank's Red Hot to give it a little flavor. Then served it with bagette slices. I will definitely be making this again! Just about drooled from thinking about it.

Got RAVE reviews from my friends - this is definitely my new recipe for spinach artichoke dip! I really think using alfredo sauce and cream cheese instead of mayo (which is called for in SO many of these recipes) gave the dip its "restaurant style" flavor. I basically followed the recipe, but I did not use roasted garlic - just two cloves of fresh minced garlic. I mixed all the ingredients together and spread in a pie plate to bake. Also, I used monterey jack cheese instead of mozzarella, and I ended up using about 1 1/2 cups (1/2 stirred into the dip, and 1/2 sprinkled on top). It was truly outstanding.

Great stuff only I used the whole jar of alfredo and a whole cream cheese.  I also added extras of garlic and I added a few drops of hot sauce.  All of my friends devoured this.  I served it w/ Tostinos flour chips.

I took this one to a party and got rave reviews.  Personally, I didn't really like it...I should of used fresh spinach, and I found it quite rich, but clearly it was only my taste buds, as everyone else loved it.

This recipe was 'ok'. My husband and oldest son really enjoyed it but I though it was lacking in flavor. Can't quite pinpoint it.. The alfredo really made it a nice texture though.. Might modify and try again..

Fantastic. Quick and Easy. A perfect appetizer to pull out of your pocket at the last minute since all the ingrediants are staples to have in the kitchen (at least my kitchen).  Make it all the time. I made it a few weeks ago for my son's school funtion and the next day he had about a dozen requests for the recipes in his school "out box" (from the other moms... of course).

Appearance and texture were excellent but the actual flavor fell flat.  Plus I not care for jarred alfredo sauces  and I felt I could still taste that a bit.  I will probably try making it again with a homemade alfredo.  If that doesn't improve the taste, I would not make this again.

Really good! I'm wondering if it might be a tad better by adding some hot sauce just to give it a little zip? It seems to be missing something.....

This was good, but I think it needed maybe a little more flavor.  I took it to a party and one person said, it tasted just like at a restaurant.

I had high hope for this recipe after reading the reviews. I was actually quite disappointed in this recipe. It contained a lot of flavorful ingredients, yet in the end, the flavor fell flat. I can't justify the high cost of a dish that is just ok.

Absolutely delish! made this dip as an appetiser for my xmas eve dinner and it was a major hit. everyone asked for the recipe.
I didn't make any changes to the recipe but i do think there are several changes i will make next time i make this.
When using larger cloves of garlic, bake a little longer to make it easier to squeeze from skins. Leave baking dish uncovered for the last 10minutes of baking to get a nice color on top =)

This dip was great and easy to throw together in my crock pot.  I did use fresh garlic and also added monteray jack cheese.    I followed the rest of directions and it turned out great.

This is the best spinach dip that I've tried. I made two changes: I doubled the cream cheese, and I used refrigerated chopped garlic (rather than roasting the fresh).  No one could stop eating it! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My roommate and I have been looking for a spinach dip like the one you eat in a restaraunt,to no avail! That is until now!!! I found the recipe and made it for a new years eve party tonight. We decided to taste test it. That was the worst thing we could have done. We ate the whole thing I am embarassed to say, lol!!! I am making more for the party, but I decided to make a triple batch!!! I, like most, used a whole  brick of cream cheese and a whole jar of Bertolli alfredo cream sauce. The only thing I did differently was in the last 5 minutes of baking I added a 1/2 cup of mozzerella and parmesan cheese (mixed). I then put it back in the oven and let the cheeses get golden brown to add a nice crust on top! Delicious!  THANK YOU!!!!

This recipe was SOOOO much easier than the other recipes I have tried from this site - and WAY better.  There are fewer ingredients to deal with.  I also used Bertolli and it was so good.  When you roast the garlic, put it in a small dish with a couple of drops of olive oil and place the garlic on it...it makes it easy to peel.  I am absolutely addicted to this recipe.  Now I look for excuses to make it!

This recipe is great. I always wanted to find a recipe that tasted like Applebee's. It was very easy to prepare and not very costly to make. I will be adding this to my recipe book. I also recommend using Paco Medium Salsa as a side dip.

This recipe is fantastic! The only thing I changed was that I used 8oz of cream cheese. For the alfredo sauce I used Bertolli which was a suggestion from an earlier review.

This recipe deserves TEN stars! I can't believe how much this recipe resembles that of a local famous chain... it's amazing! My kids loved it - easy way to get them to eat spinach!  Very tasty, and very easy to create.  It made a TON, but I'll definately be making again!

I used this recipe the other day when I was expecting a lot of company. I didn`t make any changes to this recipe for lack of time.
I thought this dip was really bland. It turned out very soupy and tasted to much of artichoke.  No one else seemed to notice though.

I have made this recipe for the past 2 Thanksgivings and it's gone before all the guests arrive!  It's so easy to make, and you can use any kind of bread or cracker to dip. I use the Italian Shredded cheese instead of just the mozzarella and I skip the parmesan cheese and garlic cloves. I add some garlic salt in place of the cloves, though.

Ok I'm not a huge spinach dip fan but I was creating this for my family since they love it.  I made it and decided to sample it and it is good even for me :)
Thanks for a great recipe.  I know my husband will love it as will his family.

This is AWESOME!  It's been requested at every family get-together since the first time I made it over a year ago.
I use an Italian blend cheese instead of plain mozzarella and it's great!

This is absolutely delicious! I always add garlic and mushrooms and comes out superb. I use extra cheese as well and sprinkle cheese on top of the mix before baking. Easy to make and superior to restaurants, IMO

I've been making this dip for years now.  It has become my signature holiday/party dish.  It is a no-fail choice that can be made ahead and baked just before serving.  It is best served with pita chips.  (We like Stacy's brand)  You can also serve it with toasted french bread for a special touch.

This recipe is great! Everyone in my family loves it! But, you don't need to pre-bake the garlic or mix it in a separate bowl. I just cut it up and put it into the glass baking dish I'll be cooking it in. And I do the same with all of the other ingredients. And it works wonders! Just be sure to mix as you go! It's so easy!!

I have tried many versions of the spinach and artichoke dip and this one is hands down the best we've tried. I do tend to add a bit more cheese and garlic and I always double the recipe. Serve with seasoned pita chips or breadsticks, my kids love this dip.

I've been making this dip for about 3 years now, and it never fails to WOW!  It is by far the most flavorful spinach dip I have ever tried.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I also use the whole block of cream cheese.  I am always asked for the recipe, even by my picky family members, which is saying a lot because they all think they are gourmet chefs!

Though I'm certain the original recipe is delicious, I'm a somewhat-poor college student and my nearest grocery is a cheap off-brand pimping store. So, I followed some of the instructions that others have done: I used garlic alfredo sauce instead of regular alfredo + roasted garlic; The full block of cream cheese; About 3 cups of mozzarella; 4 medium-to-large artichoke hearts straight from a can; and frozen spinach, melted in a microwave and strained. After combining the ingredients I decided it was a little too salty for my taste so I added extra extra cheese. It came out wonderfully! Gooey and firm and delicious, great for dipping.

This recipe is awesome. I make it all the time because my coworkers beg me to. I also use a whole block of cream cheese, roasted garlic alfredo sauce, and a couple of tablespoons of minced garlic(I love garlic). It is so delicious!

This was absolutely delicious.  This dish is very forgiving because I just pretty much threw in all the different cheeses I had on hand, but then again it's hard to go wrong with cheese!

My favorite Spinach Artichoke dip by far.  To make it even yummier, I use Sun-dried Tomato Alfredo Sauce to give it a little bit of tomato zing.  It's a great addition to an already wonderful dip!

I love this recipe and have made it so many times, always to rave reviews.  I do use a whole package of cream cheese and probably slightly less spinach and artichoke than called for.  I serve with warm sourdough bread and it is the hit of any gathering!

This was so good, and easy too! As suggested, I mixed it in a bowl before baking it. It seems to be a forgiving recipe because I used a whole package of cream cheese, a whole jar of alfredo sauce, about two cups of mozzarella, and maybe a half cup of feta on a whim, and it was fantastic. I thought the feta added a lot of flavor. I also used garlic out of a jar and it was fine. I served it with toasted French bread slices.

I made this for a get together at my husband's uncle's house it was a hit.  I was kind of skeptical since they are more into Hispanic flavor foods but it was a hit when a group of people who are into "American" food showed up.  I used the whole 8 oz. of cream cheese and it was very creamy.

This was wonderful.  I also used the entire 8 oz. package of cream cheese and instead of roasting the garlic in the oven, just used fresh minced garlic.  This is really good with fresh french bread.

I made this last night and it was a big hit. So yummy! The only changes I really made were adding the whole package of cream cheese after I read another reviewer doing it and I recommend it. I used Classico creamy alfredo and I put everything in the food processor and pulsed it until it was creamy. I would make this dish again.

YUMMY!  I followed the advice of others and I added more cheese and alfredo sauce.  I also placed it all in the blender and then placed it in a crockpot until it was all melty and smooth.  This was definitely a favorite of my guests!

EXCELLENT!  Made this with my mom, she added a bit more alfredo sauce, parmesean cheese, and smashed up the minced garlic to a fine paste.  Used an electric hand mixer to beat small cubes of cream cheese with the sauce and garlic before adding in the spinach.  Came out SOO good!

Very good dip, although I think it was a little on the thick side.  I may have cooked it a little too long.

I'm giving this one 4 stars b/c all of my guests ate this up quick, but I still have yet to find a spinach artichoke dip that tastes like the ones I've had in restaurants.  I'd probably make it again and maybe tweak it a bit.

If you want rave reviews from your guests - make this dip! Used fresh garlic and put it thru the garlic press and the Light Ragu Alfredo sauce with the light cream cheese. Threw everything in a mini crock pot and served with some bagel chips. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was a hit!  I followed others' advice and used roasted garlic alfredo sauce rather than roasting garlic myself.  My family loved it!  After baking, I transferred the dip to a mini-crock pot and served with bagel chips.  A definite keeper.  Thanks!

This recipe was a huge hit in my house.  My family has had a similar dip at a local restaurant and this is so much better.  I plan on making this over and over again and thank the person who sent it in.

YUM!!! We always have this for an appetizer when we go out to eat, so I decided to try and make it at home. It was a hit, we both loved it. The only change I made was putting the artichokes in the food processor for a creamier dip, I served it with a garlic flat bread recipe also from this site and it was a perfect match, can't wait to make this dish for company.

I made this for my book club meeting and everyone loved it.  I mixed everything together before baking and also put most of the cheese on top rather than mixing it all in.

This dip was OK. I thought that the alfredo flavour was too prominent, and the cheeses did not come through as much. My guests liked it though. I kept it hot in my stoneware fondue pot over a low flame.

After trying several recipes for this dip, I finally found this one.  It was the best so far, and I am happy to say my search is over!  The only change I mad was leaving out the garlic, as my hubby doesn't like it.  Thank you so much for this winner! I will be making this again, and again, and again!!!

I did not think this recipe was good.  I think there was too much spinach and I did not love the alfredo taste.  Definitely have had better in restaurants.  Following the advice of others, I used a full 8oz cream cheese, garlic alfredo sauce (skipping the roasted garlic), and added cheese on top to the end.  I would not make this again...I had a more than half of the dish left by the end of the night.

Excellent recipe.  I'll discard the other artichoke and spinach dip recipes I have and just use this one.

I have made this recipe over and over again, and it gets raves every time!  I increase the garlic and throw in the whole brick of cream cheese, and it never disappoints!  Thanks for posting this.

This was ok, but it was kind of runny. If I make it again, I'll double the cream cheese and half the alfredo sauce. Other than that, it was tasty, but I like my spinach artichoke dip on the thick and hearty side. Tasted great on torn-up pieces of Italian bread though.

THIS IS THE BEST! I'm really picky about my spinach and artichoke dips and this recipe tastes EXACTLY like it does at my favorite restaurants. It's sooo easy to make, you pretty much just measure everything, pour all ingredients in a pan, stir and bake. I made this as an appetizer with restaurant style tortilla chips! My dad doesn't like artichokes so I re-made it without it and it is still fabulous!

Way to thick! I had to add some milk beacuse we could not even dip the chips in it or they would break off. Maybe I did something wrong, But everyone seemed to like it once we had that fixed.

This is my first time making this and it is fantastic!  I took it to a party and people loved it!  It's always fun when you are standing there and people comment on how good something is that you made!  I HIGHLY recommend it!  I'm going to another party now and am going to make another batch.  I kept mine in a mini crockpot.

Tip for the Holidays:
- After you bake it, move to a crockpot. Keeps it warm. I made this for Thanksgiving and they snacked all day while it stayed warm. Reduce the Artichoke Hearts(can) and add more mozzarella cheese to the recipe, too!

So delicious, even my picky son loved it.  I put the spinach, artichokes, garlic and Alfredo sauce in the blender to make it a little finer and it made a big difference in spreadability.  We can't wait to make it again.  This dip isn't just for parties.

I make this recipe for family get togethers.  This year I made it for our Thanksgiving pot luck to serve as an appetizer with blue corn tortilla chips.  The whole thing was gone in about 10 minutes!  Not kidding at all!

Edited orignally review 11/8/2006 :  I have now made this dish once or twice a month since my original review.  My new changes are to basically double the recipe, use marinated artichokes, minced jarred garlic, way more cheese and bacon bits.  This is no the dish requested at every potluck.  Very good'

This recipe is so good. I made 24 servings for a party and thought I would have it left over for days, but at the end of the night it was all gone. Everyone kept coming up to me throughout the night telling me how great it was! I love that this recipe doesn't call for mayo like most, the Alfredo sauce is what makes it special.

This spinach artichoke dip is delicious! I made a few changes as others suggested..I added the whole block of cream cheese instead of half, and I also did not bother to roast my garlic, I just minced it. The dip was very garlicky, which could be because I didn't roast it first, so maybe I will add 3 cloves instead of 4 next time. I tried a recipe for spinach artichoke dip that did not require baking and wanted to try one that needed to be baked and I picked the right one! This was very easy and sooo good! I will make this again and again!

I thought this was fantastic, one of the best recipes for this type of dip.  I went a little heavy on all 3 cheeses and served in a sourdough bread bowl.  Sure to be a hit at parties or anywhere else!  Highly recommended!

I've never seen a vegetable be devoured so quickly! If this is what it takes for my husband to eat vegetables, I'll make it often! It's delicious! I'd add more stars to the rating if I could.

This is fantastic!! I've made it a few times.  I brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it and wanted to know how to make it. I mixed everything together instead of layering. Roasted garlic makes a difference to me. Will totally recommend to all!!

Just made this recipe last night when we had company over.  It got rave reviews!  The dip was very thick and cheesy - loved the flavor.  Will definitely make again.

This was a great dip!  I mixed everything together instead of layering.  I also roasted the garlic- the whole head, not just 4 cloves.  Next time, I think I will skip the roasting, but I will stick with doubling the garlic; I'll just use minced.

I'm not a fan of artichokes, but this dish was sooo good! It was very easy to make, and my husband loved it. I served it with homemade corn chips off of this site. Will definetely make this one again! Thanks for sharing!

If I could give this more stars, I would.  This is the best recipe I've gotten from this site.  I serve it with warm homemade french bread (had to find a reason to use my breadmaker) and the dish always gets scraped clean.

This was good! I had some at a restaurant not so long ago and was hoping to find a recipe for it here... ended up finding more than one recipe but this one is the first I've tried. My husband and I give it a 4 when compared to the restaurant's version.

Restaurant style is an understatement. This is sooooo much better than any restaurant. I made this exactly the way it says in the recipe and everybody went crazy. My sister in law is obsessed with this recipe, I had to give it to her. I will make this recipe over and over again. Never again will I buy store made dip. Yummy!!!

Taste Fabulous!  I followed the recipe to the TEE!  I added a 1/4 cup of Monterey Jack Cheese with Jalapeno Peppers (shredded) for an extra kick!  My co-workers loved it and waiting for me to make round II.

Loved this!  I did leave out the artichoke because I didn't have any.  I also added some chopped cooked bacon.  Will add more of that next time...YUMMY!!!  Also, next time I will probably make my own alfredo sauce instead of using the jarred kind.  Awesome base recipe.

This recipe is awsome.  I made it for a small party and it was the fist thing gone.  Everyone raved at how good it was.  I roasted the galic with a little olive oil and wrapped in aluminum foil till tender and  I used 8oz. of cream cheese.  I will definatly make again!!! Thanks for the great recipe

I'm sorry, TGI Friday's is way better than this.  The jarred alfredo sauce makes it taste generic to me.  I brought to my families camp and people seemed to like it.

The best!  I prepared it early in the day for an evening celebration and it was fine. Added a little onion powder, Monterey Jack along with the Mozzerella as suggested and it was perfect! Served with toasted bagel chips - yummy! Thanks for this one!

This was delicious! It really does taste like restaurant style dip. Instead of using a can of alfredo sauce, I only had a package mix so I made it up and it worked perfectl in the dip. I will make it again and again!

Amazing! I made this dip for my friend who owns a restaurant here in Texas, and he was amazed. The alfredo and Cream cheese, really make this a rich dip.

The BEST spinach artichoke dip EVER!  People can't believe this is homemade and say it's so much better than the restaurant recipes.  It's great hot or cold.  Go ahead and use the full 8 oz. of cream cheese.  I like to keep this my secret recipe!

My guests couldn't stop talking about this!!  I actually cooked this in a crockpot and left it that way for serving.  I accompanied it with slices of french bread.  I put in extra artichokes and extra cheese too.  Based off other reviews, I used a mixture of parmesan, mozzerella, and monterey jack cheeses.  I also used a combination of Ragu Parmesan Light Alfredo sauce and Ragu Parmesan Mozerella sauce.  This was so delicious, and the perfect consistency (not too creamy, not too runny).

I made this last night to take to work today.  I have never had this before to compare it to anything, but my boss ate quite a bit of it.  They seemed to enjoy it. Some wouldn't try it because of the spinach.  I myself tried it and thought it was just o.k.  But the recipe was very easy, especially with the garlic alfredo sauce. I didn't roast the garlic.  Try the recipe, I just didn't know what to expect or what to compare it to. Thanks for the recipe.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe, cause I LOVE spinach and artichoke dip. It felt like it was missing something, as most of my guest also relayed. It was a good recipe, but not great.

Great recipe.  I used a variation of this recipe for Christmas and everyone raved about it.  The only changes I made are I used "Roasted Garlic Parmesan" sauce in place of the Alfredo, because of this, I only sprinkled a in little garlic powder  and omitted the garlic cloves.  I did not put any cheese (other than the cream cheese) into the mix (this helps the consistancy stay smooth and creamy even as the dish cools).  I did however sprinkle with Parmesan.  Also, my husband would not share the oven so I popped it into the microwave for a few minutes, till the top was bubbly, and everyone still loved it.

This recipe is amazing, everyone loves it!  I've made it with and without the roasted garlic, definitely better with.  I also bake it and transfer it into a crock pot to keep it warm.  Some time I want to try making it in the crock pot and not baking it at all.

Wonderful and simple recipe.  I have tried it with both the refrigerated and jarred alfredo sauces, both were good.  When I used the jarred sauce I at least doubled the amount of roasted garlic... yummy.  I can't believe people are skipping the roasted garlic!  It is simple and really makes the dish.

Awesome! So easy and good. My friend pays me to make her a batch once a month! The only mods that I do are always extra cheese & alfredo. For garnish and color I add some chopped tomatoes on top.
Thank you for shareing .Cheers!

By far the best warm dip I've ever tried. I've made it with spinich and without spinich using only artichoke...either way...it's a super hit and I've made it several times for just sitting around watching a movie at home or going to family gatherings...it's always devoured quickly!! PSSST! Make a second batch for yourself after because you will likely have none to take home from a social gathering. YUMMM!

AMAZING, I have made this dip several times now and everytime i mkae it, it disapears as fast as i put it out. I absoutly love this recipie so easy and fast. The only thing i changed was i added sum sundried tomatoes to the mix and used a whole thing of cream cheese as suggested.

This was an excellent recipe. By far the best I've had. I made it for a potluck today and it went over very well. Everyone wants the recipe. Next time I might try adding a little red pepper. Thanks so much for sharing.

I liked this recipe. I was suprised at how well it turned out. I did use garlic alfredo instead of using roasted garlic and it was great. This did make a lot of dip so if you have a small gathering i would cut it in half.

This is very good.  I add a little bite with some cayenne pepper. And I also use a sundried tomato alfredo sauce and extra cheese (cojack.)

It was very delicious!  It was missing something I couldn't figure out.  I used the roasted Alfredo sauce and I had to stir it in the middle of cooking so everything melted together.  After I tasted it I put in some garlic salt (to taste), it was perfect.  Thank you for the great recipe.  It will be used time and again.

Wonderful and easy!  I made this dip for an intimate corporate party I helped cater and it was VERY well received.  I will definitely continue to use this recipe b/c I love how the alfredo keeps it from thickening. I used another reviewer's idea of using a roasted garlic alfredo sauce (I used bertolli) in order to skip the garlic step and it made the whole thing SO easy - just throw it all in the pan and bake.

I brought this to a work function. Everyone loved it, but I thought it was heavy and had a weird tinny taste that pre-made alfredo sauce has. I will make again for work, but not for other company.

This was probably the best spinach and artichoke dip I have ever eaten and I've probably tried at least 6. It was perfect!! Just time it so that you serve it at least half an hour after guests arrive. It doesn't cool nicely, but what type of cheese does? Awesome!! Five Stars!

My family loved this. This will be a new staple. I did use a whole thing of cream cheese and sprinkled more shredded cheese on top as previous reviewers said. It made twice as much as we could eat. I used jar sauce and it was still great. I just stuck everything in the food processor to blend and chop it up. Next time I will wait to top with cheese  until the cooking is almost done.

Great recipe, easy to make and something that everyone will enjoy, even those who hate veggies. I used alfredo from a jar and it worked. I also just used the type of cheese I had on hand, romano and parmesan. I just wish that I would of realized the serving size before cooking this, because now I have A LOT of leftovers and I dont think I'll be able to resist it.

This recipe has a good overall flavor, but it was a bit thick; the fresh tortilla chips I served it with kept breaking.  I recommend using a tad more alfredo sauce and less spinach.

I made this for New Year's and with 50 people present, less than 1/4 of this dip was consumed.  Next year I'll make my standard artichoke dip.

I really enjoyed this.  I made if for Christmas and my guests said it was ok, I had alot leftover for myself!  I made this again for NYE and I got the same reviews.  I kept it in a split crock pot, on the other side was the Buffalo Chicken Dip from this site and that had no leftovers.  I would make this again for myself - my friends didn't rave about it too much.

A friend of mine gave me this recipe a few years ago, and I have used it ever since!  This recipe receives rave reviews every time I make it.  In fact, it is requested at every potluck or party that I attend.  It is something that you will enjoy time and time again.  The only alteratioin that I make is to use a little extra alfredo sauce.

This was a hit at my christmas party! I was summoned to make it again for new year's!  for those of you with a thin consistency...what i did was squeeze the artichoke hearts and spinach by hand to get out as much liquid as possible.  it was great!!!

This dip is absolutely wonderful. I made it as a trial to see if I wanted to make it for New Year's Eve. I made it in a crock pot instead of baking it. First, I was eating it before it was "done" but more importantly, Second, not only did my husband and I eat it up but my four children also devoured it. I will definitely make this again and again.

I wish I could rate this 6 stars!  It tastes just like Applebee's spinach artichoke dip!  You don't have to use refrigerated alfredo sauce though...I use a whole jar of the alfredo pasta sauce found in the spaghetti sauce section of the grocery store.  My family LOVES this recipe!

Nearly 300 reviewers can't be wrong! This is a great one. I choose it because I'm not a big fan of sour cream or mayo (found in many spinach/artichoke dips). The alfredo sauce was a yummy, and easy, alternative! Thanks!

This spinach dip was sooo good. I omitted the artichokes and added lump crabmeat. I also used 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 4 oz. and 16 oz. of jar alfredo sauce. I can't wait to make it for the holidays.

Five stars from my husband.  He said it was the best dip he has ever had.  I thought it was really good too, though probably a 4 for me, since I liked the one at the restaurants I have tried just a little better.  Very rich.

I thought this was great! Trust the reviews. I add as much cheese as I want and salt and not quite the whole jar of alfredo sauce. I haven't been able to try any others because this is so good. I'm scared to change. Try it!

Great recipe.  I used jar garlic instead of cloves.  Hate to say it but put too much.  My son told me to leave the garlic out completely next time.  Other than my mistake on this recipe it was great.  Will make it again!

This recipe is great!! It was a big hit at a get together. I did make a few changes, I used a five cheese blend instead of mozz.- which gave it a "sharper" flavor, more garlic and I also added more alfredo sauce because I like it a bit creamier than the original recipe. I do think that the alfredo is the key ingredient which gives it that great flavor compared to many other typical S/A dips.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was pretty good. I brought it into work in my mini crock pot with toast points and tortilla chips. It was all gone by the end of the day.

This is a great recipe!  I did mix everything together instead of layering and it came out wonderful.  It is very easy and is good to take to a party with a bag of tortilla chips.  I highly recommend it!

I made this as an appetizer the other night. People got so full on the dip that no one was hungry for dinner. It was easy to make and just as good, if not better, than any spinach and artichoke dip I've had at any restaurant.

I wasn't a big fan of this dip. I think there was too much alfredo; it took away from the spinach & artichoke. But it did have a very nice, creamy texture, and it was eaten all up at the party, so I will probably make it again with less sauce.

This was certainly easy.  I tasted it before baking and thought it needed something so I added a chopped jalapeno.  I wasn't overly impressed, but I must admit, it did get scarfed up by my guests.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  This was so yummy!  It was super easy to make, and turned out so good.  I used the suggestion to bake it covered for 30 minutes layered, stir it, and then bake it for 10-15 minutes more uncovered.  The end result was termed "better than Macaroni Grill's."  Be sure, though, that the spinach is as dry as possible, so the dip isn't mushy.

This was so good I wish I hadn't found the recipe. Now I will want to make it a lot and it isn't exactly healthy. I loved that there were a lot of artichokes in it (restaurants always skimp on them). We ate it with blue corn chips and some jalapeno cheddar bread. Not very difficult, I used minced garlic fromthe jar and heated it a little and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I'll hang on to this one.

My fiance made this dish for our Valentine's Day party. It could be improved. I would bake it uncovered so the cheese would be brown instead of being mushing. And keep the artichoke cut into quarters, instead of chopping up, to preserve the artichoke flavor in the dip. Overall, it is not too bad.

We love spinach artichoke dips. It's a tradition we have to order it if its on the menu. This was just like one from our favorite restaurant. It turned out fantastic. I cut the recipe in half and I didn't even measure the ingredients precisely. I tried adding a can of crabmeat, but it didn't give it any special taste. It's good just the way it is. YUM! Thanks for sharing.

Just finished eating this appetizer at a well known restaurant last week with my son.  He loved it so much, he asked me if I could duplicate it.  I saw this recipe and tried it. Of course I fiddled with it a bit and added a bit more garlic and salt, but served it to a group of adult friends this past week with toasted pita bread and blue tortillas chips.  Wonderful!!! This is the Real McCoy and you will love it.

As everyone says, this one is a DEFINATELY keeper - I got many requests for recipes as well as requests to make it again for future functions. One thing to note, however, is that it's probably best served warm/hot... as the dip cools, it gets thicker and stiffer (I'm guessing it's because of the cream cheese in it..?) and not very "dip-friendly" as chips break off when trying to eat this cold.

Very good!  I used a bit of garlic salt in addition to the cloves, as well as pepper to spice it up more.  Great on Sourdough bread!  Will make again!

This is a terrific recipe, BUT for people who like a little more flavor I ALWAYS use the MARINATED artichoke hearts, make the dish INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!  (I use the marinated for ANY recipe that calls for artichoke hearts)

This was kind of bland.  I had made another spinach dip from this site, and did not care for the texture, this one the texture was good but was bland, maybe if you added a red pepper it might spice it up a little.

This is delicious!  Everyone at my party loved it. I like the alfredo sauce and cream cheese for a change instead of mayo and sour cream that most recipes use.

With so many reviews I wasn't going to rate this, but just had to since it is SO good!  I thought it made too much for just 4 adults but we ate it down in no time! Very wonderful and bubbly! I did have to cook mine a bit longer to get that really hot bubbly finish, but that may just be my oven. This was great... the garlic is so wonderful and I added a bit extra. Also, I didn't add quite as much spinach to make it more "kid-friendly". Thanks for the recipe!

I served this at a party.  It was great.  We served it with Garlic Pita chips and it goes well together.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.  
One 16-yr-old said she liked it with the sourdough bread better.  Good thing we served both.

Good recipe.  This was a hit at a recent party.  This was a different twist to the usual artichoke dip, the alfredo sauce really gives this a nice creamy texture and a smooth taste.  However, I did have to use more cream cheese than the recipe called for, mine seemed to be somewhat runny after adding the sauce.  I will also scale back just a little on the garlic next time- four cloves was just a bit too much.  Thanks for the recipe TerraD!

Great recipe! I used homemade Alfredo sauce and also added a bit more garlic and parmesan than the recipe calls for and it was wonderful! I served it with toasted french bread slices and it was all gone! Thanks Terra

Everyone loved it.  I agree that a little less spinach would be OK for most people.  There's so much cheese, even the kids ate the spinach!

I LOVE S&A dip and decided to try this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly as is...The end result for us was awful-the alfredo sauce was so overpowering and tasted so fatty that I couldn't stomach it.  DH is a fan of alfredo dip and he said it was too much.  We will try a few more S&A dip recipes on this site not using the alfredo sauce.

This got rave reviews at a recent party--some said it was the best spinach & artichoke dip they had tried. I also used the entire box of cream cheese and mixed everything before I baked it. I had to add about 10 minutes to the baking time, because I made it ahead of time and refrigerated it.

We love ordering this out and decided to try and make it for a party.  After having made this a few times, I'm incredibly impressed by how easy and popular this recipe is.  It is the first thing to disappear every time we take it, which we do often! (Added 2/18/04: If you want to make a slightly heathier version, use the "Heart-Healthy Fettuccini Alfredo" recipe available on Oprah.com.  It's made with beans and is very good by itself and in this dish makes little perceptable taste change.)

Delicious. Very creamy and tasty. I used the refrigerated Alfredo Sauce as called for. We went through two bags of tortilla chips finishing it off.

I didn't care for this recipe. I am a big fan of artichoke/spinich dip. I think the alfredo sauce I chose didn't help matters, it was garlic flavored, perhaps too much garlic... I didn't think that was possible. Regardless, the flavor just wasn't quite right...

Personally, I only thought this was OK.  It was good, but it wasn't the best I've had.

I just made this tonight, and it came out wonderful! I used a 16oz jar of Classico Roasted Garlic alfredo sauce, the whole 8oz block of cream cheeze, 2 cups of mozzarella, and a can of black olives, sliced. When it came out of the oven it was VERY creamy, so I let it sit and then had the most wonderful texture.

This was a HUGE hit for Thanksgiving appetizers - I would definitely make it again.  And it was the first time I ever roasted my own garlic!

I took this to my friend's Christmas party. EVERYone asked for the recipe. The 'spinach dip connoissuers', as they dubbed themselves, could not believe how good this was. They said I had to give it a 5.

I made this dip w/ the idea it would be good, but it was great. My husband has raved about it and he usually just makes a comment or two about a new recipe. I took it to a small party and was asked twice for the recipe. This is a keeper.
