Great snack mix!  I also found it a bit sweet the first time I made it, so the next time I used salted nuts (pecans, cashews and almonds) and also added some pretzels.  It was a big hit with my family!

Absolutely addictive!  Made this for our company party and had several requests for the recipe.  This recipe is change friendly as far as type of nuts and that sort of thing.  BE SURE to stir every few minutes after you take it out of the oven to keep it from sticking in one big glob.

Great!  Hard to stop eating once you start.  Everyone that I gave this to has requested the recipe.
I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with Pam before mixing everything.  Made clean-up VERY easy.

This is very good.  I don't see how some can say that it is too sweet.  I did add extras though, maybe that's why it doesn't seem too sweet.  I made 1 and 1/2 batches of the caramel mixture and added 1tbsp vanilla extract to it.  I used 1c almonds, 1c cashews, 1/2c chopped pecans, about 12oz corn Chex, and 8oz of tiny twist pretzels.  It tastes perfect, not to sweet or not sweet enough.  I bought the biggest disposable roasting pan I could find.  I think this is a must.  It makes it pretty easy to stir every 15 minutes while it's in the oven.

Fabulous and simply - Trish, I have used your recipe at least 20 times and it is always a BIG hit. I add dried cranberries right after taking it out of the oven; the tart/softness is a great contrast to the crunchy/crispness. (Great road trip food) Thank You, Thank You!

This was sooo good.  It was hard to stop eating it once I started.  With the pecans in this, it sort of tasted like pecan pie...which I love.  I used cinnamon crispix cereal rather than the crispies and added some old fashioned oats.  I used all peanuts rather than almonds and added a splash of vanilla extrat.  I would have loved to have made this exactly as the recipe is written, but didn't have all of the right ingredients.  This is definitely a re-do.  Thanks Trish.

This caramel snack mix was excellent! I only wish I had made twice as much of the coating mixture to completely cover all the cereal mixture!

You got a winning recipe! A "numero uno" in my book...I can't wait to prepare it again.
One question...or two for you. How do you package
it for gift giving and how long does it last?
Provided that my kids do not find it first...if
you have the answer please share it! Thanks a bunch for your Trish Caramel Snack Mix.

Great recipe!  I made this exactly as stated in the recipe, using Chex Multigrain cereal, almonds and pecans.  I left the nuts whole, and toasted them in the oven first.  I saw several 'bad' reviews, and I believe most of them complained about stickiness of the finished product.  These same reviewers stated that they 'had' to increase the cook time for the coating in the microwave to get it to the hard crack stage.  That's their mistake right there!  Like the recipe says, you just put it in the microwave until the butter melts!  Stir it and pour it over your cereal mixture.  I couldn't find my roaster so I used 2-9x13 cake pans, then dumped it on sheets of quick release foil and spread it out.  It took almost no time to cool and didn't have to be stirred.  Next time I'm going to try adding some cinnamon and vanilla as others suggested.  Great recipe, Trish!

I made this for a trial run as it sounded good for Christmas.  I did not change the recipe.  I never do the first time I make something.  I live at 5500 feet above sea level so it took about three minutes for my butter to melt in the microwave and that did not include the time it took for me to stir it!!  I buttered my hands after adding the hot butter/brown sugar/corn syrup mixture so I could mix it together and be careful and not break up the cereal.  After reading all of the other comments on the cereal clumping up after coming out of the oven, I put it on cookie sheets covered with silpat sheets (could use parchment paper) and I did not even have to touch them at all.  I did have a problem with my better half...I could not keep him OUT of the mix as it cooled.  He loves it!!  I am diabetic so I can not eat it.  But if he loves it, that is fine with me!!

Very east to make and excellent tasting. Next time I will use pecan halves instead of chopped pecans, the chopped ones were to small.  I will try with other nuts also.  Very Good!!

The kids dug it, so did I.  I was 3 cups short on the cereal, so I used Cinnamon Life for the rest, it added a little extra flavor so I think that I will use it next time as well.  Thanks Trish!

Since everyone else who has tried this seems to love it, I obviously did something wrong. Maybe I baked it too long because it was hard like candy. Or maybe we just prefer the original snack mix. Sorry!

Love this snack mix and make it every year about this time.  Package it and give most of it away, but always keep some for myself too!
I use organic multi-grain cereal, increase the quantity of both pecans and almonds (and chop the almonds)to about 3 cups total.  When I take it out of the oven I dump it onto parchment paper and spread it out and let it cool for about 3 hours.  No problems with stickiness or a big lump of mix and I don't have to keep stirring either!

wow!! doubled the recipe, which made a massive amount. Instead of the almonds I used peanuts and pecans. I didn't have enough light corn syrup, and used half dark, half light. I also used chex & cinnamon life cereal, and it was awesome, people kept asking for the recipe. Thank you!!! :)

We loved this!! Even though my husband prefers the traditional chex snack mix, I took a chance on something different.  We have had our hands in it all day and it is almost gone.  Even the kids can't stop eating it.  This recipe will be at the top of my food gift recipes.  I used Cinnamon Cripix which added a wonderful hint of cinnamon.  I also threw in salted peanuts, pecan halves, and waffle shaped pretzels.  It was all wonderful.  I even made this on a rainy humid day in Texas and it still came out crunchy.  We don't like recipes that stick to our teeth.  For Christmas next year, I plan on adding red and green M&Ms after it cools to give it some color as well as chocolate to go with this wonderful toffee snack before placing it in glass holiday jars.  Thank you for sharing!

Super yummy and easy! I made a half batch and the only changes I made were to add about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the butter/sugar mixture after it came out of the microwave. And I substituted about a cup of the cereal for a cup of pretzels. Next time I would add more nuts!! Think it needs a few more. I used unsalted mixed nuts, but next time I will use salted. I think the salty-sweet combo would be awesome. For those in Canada, 12 oz of the Crispix is the 350g box. (or 12 cups).

Oh...my...Gosh!  This is by far the best variation of Chex mix our family has ever tasted. The toffee-like coating is perfect.  You can use any selection of nuts (we liked a combination of rice chex, corn chex, peanuts, pecans & sliced almonds and pretzed sticks).  I made my first batch to give away to co-workers, but half the gallon bag was gone the next morning by my much-addicted, snack-munching family.  Thank you, Trish!

This was very good snack mix.  I used 3 cups of mixed nuts instead of almonds and pecans.  The taste was very good but it needed salt for my taste.  I spinkled salt on the mix when I was stirring the mix cooling down. This gave it a nice sweet and salty taste.

You cannot get the hardened caramel out of the pan....even soaking it.   I got side tracked and didn't mix the mess as it was cooling...never again!

Halfway through the baking I knew this recipe needed a kick in the pants. I needed to microwave the glaze (it really isn't caramel) for 3 and a half minutes and I have a newish microwave. After tasting it halfway, I added two handsful of pretzels and it brought the mix from a zero to a two  star recipe. I also baked it an extra 15 minutes to crisp it up more. My old recipe calls for two cups of pretzel goldfish, two teaspoons of cinnamon and to bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes while baking and stirring constantly until it cooled down to prevent clumping.  Cool completly and store in ziplock baggies.  For greater success I suggest baking the nuts, pretzels, cereal for 15 minutes before you add the glaze mixture and then continue baking and stirring for one hour and 15 minutes longer. I give it two stars and Hubby gives it one.  Won't make it again. Sorry. UPDATE We bumped this back down to a one-star due to the gumminess it took on overnight.  UPDATE2 Day 3 and this was a colossal hard clump of inedible ingredients.. so, 'nuts' to this recipe - downgraded to No Stars... Sorry...

I just made this, it is almost cool enough to eat, but I tasted it anyway.  It is great.  Much easier than I thought it would be.

I was concerned about 'clean up' after the cooking, so I lined my tray with aluminum foil.  I wish I hadn't it tore and I got a few bits in my mix and leaked into the tray anyway.  If 'clean up' is a concern, forget about it, some really hot water and it is gone.

I eliminated the cereal as hubby and I are big nut fans.  Oh my goodness, I will make this again and will try some of the variations.

I've made this every christmas for the past 4 years, and it's so addicting! The only change I made was to use a large can of deluxe mixed nuts in place of the pecans and almonds. A few lessons learned:
- Use the biggest roasting pan you can find, otherwise the cereal spills out while stirring.
- Use a large silicone spatula to stir - it stirs easily, helps get all of the caramel off of the sides, and is gentle on the cereal so you don't break as much.
- *** THE MOST IMPORTANT (and time consuming) PART: Stir while cooling. At first, stir at least once every 5 minutes. Once it feels like the caramel is not quite as sticky, you can stir every 10 minutes. If you wait 10 minutes at first, they'll stick together and you end up breaking the cereal. I usually keep stirring constantly for the first 5 - 10 minutes. Again, use the silicone spatula. It's a lot of stirring, but it makes a huge difference. Once it has completely cooled, I store in an airtight container.  YUM!!!

I made this snack mix to take along on our spring break trip.  I doubled the recipe and the whole canister was gone before we crossed the Florida state line.  This is a wonderful recipe and would make a good hostess or teacher gift.

This was a great tasting recipe. It is very easy. I just set my timer every 15 min. for an hour to stir the ingredients. It was nice to have one that you didn't have to cook the syrup first. It is not sticky when finished. Just store in air tight container.

This is a good recipe! I added some mixed nuts, only because I saw that others had.  It was just yummy, and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing, Trish!

My whole family loved this - as did our guests.  I have had 2 friends call since I served this at a gathering - asking for the recipe.  I used Cinnamon Crispix for the cereal- it gave it great flavor! I even made my husband a big batch to keep at the office for snacking.  It will probably become a regular at our house.

I brought this to work today and it disappeared!  I substituted cashews for almonds.  As suggested, I added cinnamon and also a little nutmeg into the sugar before heating.  I also added 30 seconds to microwave time to get the sugar temp up a bit - have to watch carefully so it doesn't bubble up too much.  Came out nice and crunchy.  Great fall flavor snack!

I made this as a teacher gift for my son's preschool teachers.  It came out pretty good.  The cereal is a little chewy, but how could anything coated in sugar be bad!  I added a couple shakes of cayanne pepper.  You cannot taste the pepper, but it adds a nice surprise of heat.  I cooled mine on cookie sheets so I didn't have to stir so often.

I didn't have a roasting pan, so I put it in 2 large cake pans. I used honey roasted chex (generic brand), which has rice & corn cereal in it. I made exactly as written and at one hour it was slightly burnt. I wish I would have taken it out at 45 minutes.   Still disappeared fast, even though I warned people it was burnt!

I have made this MANY times over....my family loves, and my kids friends request it all the time.  I use slivered almonds and add mini pretzels.  The key is to set your timer for every 15 minutes and be sure to stir (even when it's cooling.) Keep in an air tight continer IF there are any leftovers.  Great recipe...thanks Trish!

YUMMY!!!To the brown sugar mix after the butter had melted I added a teaspoon on cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla- I used Honey Nut Chex for the cereal added popped popcorn in place of the nuts (my kids won't eat them) and after the mix had cooled I added M&M's for color and peanut butter chips as well-TASTY!!!! =)

This is a great mix...I have tried using less nuts (not a fan) and adding different cereals as well as pretzel twists.  It has always turned out great, no matter what I added, as long as I keep the total amount of dry ingredients about the same.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

A scrumptious and HIGHLY contagious snack.  This is great to eat by itself or on top of ice cream.  Very simple to make and stores well in a ziplock bag or airtight container.

This is a really good if you're looking for a SWEET snack mix, not caramel.  If you're looking for a "caramel" party mix, use the Caramel Corn Snack Mix recipe (appetizers).  Also, do not double the syrup for this recipe here, it is sufficient for the amount of cereal listed.  I doubled the recipe for the syrup and it was way too much, baking time had to be doubled and a lot of the cereal was stuck to the pan because the excess syrup hardened.

This was an OK snack recipe.  I was disappointed with the outcome.  My family thought it was OK, not something to rave about though.  Will probably not make it again.  I even added the salted peanuts as suggested in some of the reviews.  It seems to be lacking something.

I was looking for something to make for a Christmas snack gift and this worked perfectly. It is extremely quick and easy, but everyone loves it and many have requested the recipe! I made a batch with macadamia nuts and another with cashews and they were great, too.

Really good and easy. I used about 2/3 of the sugar mix on the cereal and it was fine. The cereal and nuts were well coated and it made the mix less likely to clump. Spread out on parchment paper to cool.

I just finished making this mix, and it turned out perfect.  I did make a few alterations.  I used 2/3 c + 1 Tbsp. sugar, left out some of the nuts.  I made part of it without nuts as I am not supposed to eat nuts.  It was good but not quite what I expected.  Next time I will use a recipe that has condensed milk in it to make it more of a caramel flavor instead of a toffee flavor.  My husband likes it, so that is good.

This is wonderful. If you have a craving for something sweet but crunchy, this is it. Very addictive. Will be making on a regular basis. I used pecan halves instead of chopped pecans. Might even try some salted pretzels in with it next time.

This was great but you have to warn your quest about the sticky fingers. It was kind of weird for everyone sticky their fingers in the same bowl so I would definately divide it up into portion bowls for people to grab.

Funny thing...it was better the following day. Will make it the night before for the next batch.

I make this so much people started calling it Margie's Snack Mix. I prefer sliced almonds and I add a bag of dried cranberries while cooling. I think the tartness of the cranberry goes well with the sweetness of the snack mix and it looks nice packaged up as Christmas gifts.

So good!!  I used Crispex & mixed nuts from The Dollar Tree.  When I took it out of the oven I stirred it for about 10 minutes in front of a fan-nothing stuck together-It was NOT like peanut brittle-it was perfect!  Thanks so much!

Great stuff!!  I made this for a New Year's Eve snack, and had to slap hands to let it cool properly.  Like some others, I added pretzels and used a can of mixed nuts (what I had on hand).  I already bought more to make another batch.

Very good snack mix. I used mixed nuts. I also lined my pan with foil, so it was an easy cleanup. The recipe makes plenty of caramel to coat all of the mix. Just remember to stir,stir,stir!
Thanks for the great recipe!

I had good success with this recipe. I did boil the caramel mixture for 2 min. on the stove rather than using the microwave, then followed the recipe directions. Clean up need not be difficult.Just put some hot water in your roast pan and boil it on the stove for a couple of minutes, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon. The pan comes clean easily. Any caramel coated treat will take on moisture if left in an open dish too long(even commercial ones).Thhis treat should be stored in a covered , airtight container.

This actually tastes better the next day.  I did two recipes: one with corn Chex, pretzels and pecans, and one batch with just air popped popcorn, using white sugar instead of brown.  Both tasted fantastic.  I think this caramel mixture and procedure would be good on just about anything.  Be careful, though.  It's addicting.

This stuff is really good!  I used almonds and cashews and cooked butter mixture on stove.  Mixed ingredients, melted butter, then boiled for 2 minutes.  It is very crunchy, almost toffee like, but very good!

good stuff, and you could add all kinds of things to make it your own. but be warned -- this makes a lot, so be sure your roasting pan can handle it!

I made this for a New Year's party and everyone loved it!  I used peanuts (cheaper!)but want to make it again using pecans and almonds.  I also used the Cinnamon Crispix cereal like several others recommended.  Will definitely make this again!

This is so easy and taste great!  I will make again but will make some changes next time.  I used slivered almonds and chopped pecans.  Next time I will use whole.  They kind of fall to the bottom of the mix.  Also I will add some salted peanuts to add a little more salty to the mix.  I used crispix but I'm sure corn and rice chex would be great too.

Add my relatives to those who just loved this.  I passed on the recipe to 3 new fans.  I used Crispix and added 1 cup pretzels.  Also, for cooling, divide into 2 pans for easier stirring and faster cool down.

A good recipe not meant for doubling (unless, I suppose, you're quite skilled at handling a bubbling sugar brew.)  I didn't enjoy the flavor much...but others who tasted it found it tasty (if not a bit too candy-crunchy).

This was very easy to make, and sooo delicious.  I used peanuts instead of walnuts, but kept the amounts the same.  I'm sure I will become a Christmas tradition! Thanks Trish!

I made this for the first time last year and what a winner.  Everyone will want the recipe.  I have already made four batches so far this year to put in containers as gifts.  I leave the pecans whole and they are yummy.

A real hit with my husband and kids--I liked it also, but not as much as they did!  Since I'm a pecan lover--next time I think I'll add double the amount called for in the recipe.  I think the name is a little misleading.  I think the taste is more similar to a maple flavor rather than caramel.  A nice muchie alternative to the traditional savory cereal snack mix.

This is a definite keeper!  My children love this snack.  I used 2 c. total of pecans, almonds, and cashews(salted)and crispix cereal. It was yummy!  I will certainly use this to take to get-togethers.  It's a nice change from the usual chex mix.

This is a very good tasting snack.  Yes, it does get quite crunchy, so if you're not into that, then don't bother...  It reminds me of brittle.  I used 2 c of salted mixed nuts.  I made a batch and packaged it into small clear snack bags to give out on Halloween at work.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is delicious!!  After reading some other reviews, I decided to use Costco salted mixed nuts and Crispix (sp?) cereal.  I think the salted nuts probably add greatly to the flavor.  I will be making this again often.

Fabulous and simply - just what I needed for some last minute gifts.  Packaged in pretty containers it was a BIG hit and so easy to do this busy time of year.  To give it that holiday flair I added dried cranberries right after taking it out of the oven.  The tart/softness were such a good contrast to the crunchy/crispness that I think it will be a permanent addition - even after the holidays.  (Great road trip food) Thank You, Thank You!

I made this for the first time in early October for a party snack.  Everyoe loved it and I have since made it 5 or 6 times.  What a great holiday treat!  I plan on making this and giving as gifts to neighbors, co-workers and such.  I added a cup of cashews to make it extra yummy.  This is definitely a keeper in my collection.  Thanks for sharing it, Trish.

This was amazingly easy and very, very good! I used chopped pecans, cashews and pretzel sticks. (Next time, will use pecan halves.) Added 2 caps full of vanilla extract and about 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon to the mixture after the butter melted. Will add one full teaspoon of cinnamon next time because I could not taste it. When it came out of the oven, I placed the pan on the counter, under the ceiling fan and stirred constantly for the first 10 minutes of cooling  time. It is a day later and what looked like a MASSIVE amount of mix has been reduced to about one cup. Guess I'd better make more.

I have this exact recipe but it is made from start to finish in the microwave. Mine says to cook the butter,syrup,and brown sugar for 2 min. in the microwave and stir. Then cook 2 min. more. Put the cereal into a large microwavable bowl and pour syrup mixture over to coat,stirring gently. Microwave an additional 4 min. stirring every minute. Pour on parchment paper to cool and break apart. I add peanuts,pretzels and choc. covered candies when cool. Love this recipe!

A very good recipe! I added 1 tsp cinnamon, but otherwise followed directions exactly, stirring as directed, and was very happy with the results.  It was a crowd-pleaser at a Thanksgiving dinner yesterday, and I'm about to make it again for my family, who won't have to share this batch!

I always add unsalted, dry-roasted peanuts to this mix and bake it in a huge turkey roasting pan. When I lay it out for cooling, I use parchment paper, and spread it out as far as possible in a thin layer so I don't end up with huge clumps. Then I put about a cup & a half in sandwich sized ziploc bags for storage, or for giving out. My family absolutely LOVES this recipe. It is the best Chex Mix recipe we have ever tried, far superior to any other.

This is the easiest and most diversified recipe for fast gifts or parties.. have just made my 4th batch... you can use anything, I like to add pretzels..this last time it was chex cereal, small pretzels, (all I had},  & added raisins...looks delish..
no microwave but easy to melt on top of stove... one thing I figured out early on, you must stir as directed both in the oven & once out..
everyone I gave this to, loved it!!  thanks

Just finished making the traditional Chex Mix when I saw this recipe.  I used the remainder of all three cereals to make this and it is wonderful!  Will do it again the same way.

This mix is awesomely delicious. I haven't taken it yet to it's destination but I hope I don't make myself sick eating it before I get it there! I needed to double the recipe. When I got it all mixed with the cereal and nuts it seemed like it was still awfully gooey so I added more dry ingredients and still had plenty to cover the mix. I used 14 oz of corn chex, 17 oz cinnamon crunch, about 3/4 lb pretzel twists, 2 c. pecans and 1 1/2 c whole almonds. Once I'd baked it I turned it out onto rimmed cookie sheets so that it would be in a single layer and then tossed it as it cooled with two spatulas, like tossing a salad. It cooled nicely and didn't glob up. I suspect if you use the ratio with more sugar/butter mix to the dry ingredients it would have more of a tendency to stick together and be more candy-like. However, mine turned out plenty caramel-ly! It's a little labor intensive since you have to turn it every 15 minutes then toss while cooling and I made a sticky mess of several pans and utensils, but it's worth it! Definitely a keeper and I can see how, if you take this to a group, you'll be commanded to keep bringing it!

Great recipe!  I added cinnamon as another reviewer suggested.  Very easy and no problems with clumping together.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for my brother in law's drive across American, and it is soooooo good. I hope some actually gets to him :(. I did find it a little sweet as others mentioned, but no sure how to alleviate it and not sure I want to. Had to stir it about twice after pulling it out, every 15 minutes (it was pretty clumpy on the second stir) and then it was dry.  Don't worry about coating it all before it goes into the oven - the caramel liquifies in the oven, so on the first and second stir, everything will get coated evenly.  This would be the perfect thing to make for Christmas food gifts - it is so easy and it makes a ton at a time.  Might try the cinnamon Life next time - that sounds like the perfect addition.

This is very good. It's very crunchy which I like. I failed to stir it as it was cooling so I had to break it up a bit, but that was my fault so I give it 5 stars. I used peanuts instead of almonds because my husband doesn't like them.

I need to add another 5 stars!! THE PROS: Delicious, very easy and economical to make, and since the main ingredient is healthy cereal, not quite as bad for you as most snack foods (eaten in moderation, of course). THE CON: This stuff is so addictive, it's hard to stop eating it. The recipe makes a LOT, but after a day, you'll be asking, "Where'd it all go?" Tastes kind of like Honey Bunches of Oats cereal and a little like pecan pie (as another reviewer stated). Someone said theirs came out sticky, but mine wasn't sticky at all. I cooled it on a large silicone mat. It cooled very quickly and broke up nicely. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I wasn't crazy about this for some reason, but others liked it at the party I went to, so giving 4 stars.  I followed the recipe except put in 2 cups mixed (salted) nuts, in place of the other 2 cups of nuts.  Very easy to make.  I used a disposable roasting pan from Walmart (around $2.50), and saved on any hassle of cleanup.  Also spread out on parchment paper after cooking so it didn't stick together.

This was good- I added pretzels and used mixed nuts, and wheat chex instead of corn or rice.  In the future I would follow the recipe more closely.  My husband loved it and ate half of it in one day.  I gave four instead of five because I thought that the overall flavor was not very exciting- just sweet.  I did add some course salt as I was stirring to cool it down- I would definitely do that next time, too.

i don't like caramel and things sticking to my teeth. the corn syrup glaze on this mix was not desirable to me or others who ate it and agreed with me. this is more like a brittle than chex mix.

Great for gifts - hard to stop eating. I followed other suggestions and baked it in 2- 9x13 pans. After baking I spread the mixtures onto 2 cookie sheets. Spread them out to avoid clumping (alittle clumping is ok).

MMMM! So YUMMY! I made these for packaging up and giving as holiday treats. I have made several batches, and it really is a hit! I've used mixed nuts instead of just almonds and pecans. This turns out so yummy and addictive! Everyone loves it!

This was pretty good. I felt like it needed another flavor in there though. Maybe cinnamon would be good? I might try it next time with cinnamon Life mixed in or something like that. I used a can of salted mixed nuts and it worked out well. You definitely have to stir it like crazy when it is cooling or it will harden into a big brittle blob. I put mine in a tupperware container straight out of the oven and shook it every few minutes until it was cool. Nothing stuck together! It's definitely not a peanut brittle, but a snack mix.

I think it is IMOPORTANT to note that this is like a PEANUT BRITTLE! I had no idea that "crunchy" meant this hard. I made a double batch to send to my son @ camp - then to my dismay, it's brittle! He has braces, can't eat it... It was good if you like brittle (which I do not). So 3 stars?

I made this for a bridge group gathering, and all the women loved it.  They keep asking me to bring it again.  I don't care for pecans, so I used almonds and peanuts, but really- any nut would do.  Delicious and easy!

OMG this is good, its still in the oven and each time I give it a stir I have another taste test you know quality assurance is so important. Hopefully there will be some left by the time it comes out of the oven. thanks for a great recipe. I have foolishly tried similar recipes and none of them have measured up. I have used the caramel from this recipe but only used a mixture of nuts, it was magnificent. I will stick with this recipe as nothing remotely compares to the excellant results at the end. Once again thanks for a real winner...............chris

A little sticky.  I probably should have let it dry out on waxed paper.  Even though I stirred it frequently, pieces still stuck together in globs.  Tasted good, though.

This recipe was a hit! I added about a cup and a half of roasted salted peanuts and roasted salted almonds instead of the pecans. Very delicious. I thought the glaze would not be enough, but was just the right amount. If you would like to add additional sweetness you could add more glaze...or even substitue honey for the corn syrup. Very wonderful. New family favorite! :)

I've made this a few times and everyone asks me for the recipe. The only modifications I make are adding scant 1/8 tsp of each Cayenne pepper and garlic powder to it.

Really good! I made this for a friend's birthday and it received very high marks from everyone. It's sweet and crunchy, not sticky like some other cereal mixes I've made. I followed the recipe exactly, except added a few handfuls of mini-pretzels. Will make again for sure!

I love these snacks that use breakfast cereal as a main ingredient...I don't mind feeding it to my 2 yr old...
This Caramel Snack Mix is really good. I used rice chexs, chopped pecans and chopped almonds that I roasted...perfect mid morning or afternoon snack.

I didn't have any almonds on hand so I added cashews. I left the pecans whole and added about 1 1/2 cups.  It was great.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this again.  Thanks Trish

I made a couple changes to the recipe by using pretzels in place of about 3 cups of Chex and peanuts to replace the other nuts. I enjoyed the flavor of the end product, but the texture was a little too sticky for me. I had to microwave the caramel mix for longer, but don't think it ever reached the hardball stage, which would cause a less sticky result. I will make this again, but cook the caramel mixture on the stovetop.

Yum! This is great.  It is sweet, crunchy, totally addicting.  I used pretzels in place of some of the cereal (about four ounces).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Make sure to spray the roasting pan and stir regularly, especially as it cools.

Very easy and very good!!!  I used two cups of the chopped pecans instead of just the one, as two cup bags were all my grocery store had.  I would suggest using slivered almonds in this recipe as opposed to whole almonds.  The recipe didn't specify which, but I think the slivered would be better.  Thanks for sharing a recipe my whole family enjoyed!  We really couldn't keep our hands out of the bowl!

I didn't think that there was anything special to this.  It seemed like something was missing, and I would have liked to have more nuts in it.  If you decided to make this, be sure to use the deep roasting pan so that the caramel won't burn.  I doubled the batch, but only had one pan, so I put the other on a cookie sheet, which ended up being a burnt mess.  The batch in the roasting pan turned out fine, though.  I don't think I'll make this again.

This is so easy and very good.  I was surprised by the previous reviews that thought it was too crunchy.  I thought the crunch was perfect.  I made this for Christmas and it was funny to watch peoples reaction when they expected traditional chex mix.  After the initial surprise, everyone loved it.

This was very easy and tastes great. I was afraid it would be sticky but after it cooled it was crispy and crunchy and terrific.  I only shared it with one person so far...but of course she asked for the recipe.  I'm going to try cutting out the almonds next time and adding cashews.

I will definitely make this again and again!  Both times I have made this, I have changed it up slightly but it is still amazing! The first time I followed the recipe exactly but added a few pinches of sea salt to the caramel mixture and it was so good. The second time I made it I cut back on the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, added a few pinches of sea salt to the Carmel mixture. I also added a few handfuls of pretzel sticks and about a cup of peanuts to the cereal mixture and had more than enough of the caramel mix to coat it all. The most important key to this recipe is the constant stirring as it cools to avoid sticking together and stickiness after it cools. My new favorite go to snack mix, my family and friends love it too!

wow, easy to see why this is so addictive!  The versatility of this simple recipe is amazing, as the possibilities are endless.  I used half corn chex, and half peanut butter chex.  all peanuts, some leftover dried cranberries, and mini pretzels.  Out of habit, I did the syrup on the stove in a sauce pan, and did add 1/2 tsp salt and some vanilla to the syrup.  After it came out of the oven, I poured it onto a large cookie sheet to cool.  I didn't have to break up much at all.  It is buttery, toffee goodness that would make a great party mix, or to give away as gifts.  The problem comes with being able to stop eating it!  such a great recipe that allows you to be creative, and the ratio of syrup to cereal/nuts is spot on.  thanks so much.  sure to be a crowd-pleaser, and will make again and again.

I made a couple of slight changes. I made a double batch and used 1/4 plain cheerios  with 3/4 Crispex. I used the pecans but left out the almonds. Everything else was as directed. I made it for a church worker meeting. Everyone kept helping themselves to more and more...and more (I had plenty)! My pastor called me the next day asking if I could make another batch just for him.?? It was the perfect mid-afternoon pick-me-up snack.

This was an easy dish to make and very tasty. If you are counting calories, DO NOT MAKE THIS!. It is almost impossible to resist, so you just keep eating and eating. Perfect combo of salty sweet. Definite cheat  on your calorie count for the day.

I will definitely make again. I made the mistake of making half again the amount of caramel sauce the first time. It was gooey, sticky and way too sweet. The next time, I stuck to the original amounts.  I also added vanilla and cinnamon, as others suggested, and swapped out half the cereal for pretzels. It was delicious!

All I can say is Amazing!  I used 2 cups of mixed nuts since I didn't have the individual types and didn't quite have the full amount of Chex, but it turned out great.  It definitely sticks in your teeth, but helps with any sweet tooth.  I was considering adding some Honey Nut Cheerios since I didn't have enough Chex and kind of wish I would have because I think it would have been really good that way too.

I use LIFE cereal, salted almonds and pecans pieces  which makes this treat totally addictive! Be sure to stir the mixture in the oven every 15 minutes  during baking and most critical is to stir it frequently once you take it out of the oven. If you don't stir it repeatedly after you have baked it for an hour, you will get hardened lumps. By stirring the mixture while it's still warm it will be coated evenly and will be lump free.  This recipe is so addictive that my friends and family have dubbed it candy crack. ??

Very good as is, but I did make one change that people seemed to like even better -- cut the pecans in half and added peanuts.  It disappeared even faster than usual!

Compared to other recipes, this one seems to be missing baking soda.  I added 1/2 tsp after the rest of the mixture came to a boil.  Followed everything else exactly. Came out hard.

I think I'll throw in some cashews next time. Very easy and very good! I got bored stirring often while it cooled, so I put it in a bowl with a lid and shook it a few times...turned out great!

I have made this several years for Christmas gifts. And I always double. Everyone loves it and wants recipe! Yes, it is addicting and sweet it surprises everyone that eats it because they are expecting something that taste more like original chex mix flavor! Love, love, love,  this stuff. Just wish I could come of with a sugar free recipe more healthy! And yes don't forget to stir! I usually transfer it into my Tupperware bowls and stir it to keep from sticking together! It cools faster that way too! Easy as long as you don't forget about it!

So easy and a big hit with everyone! I've made it twice now with great success and little cleanup. I lined two half sheet pans with foil and sprayed them with butter flavored non-stick spray.  I added a handful of pretzel snaps and used pecan halves.

Melt the butter, sugar and syrup in the microwave until the butter is melted and the sugar is dissolved. Stir it well. This took more than 2 minutes in my microwave, it took about 4. This is not a cooking stage, the mixture will caramelize from its time in the oven. Stir every 15 minutes with a silicone spatula, gently stirring and turning the cereal and nuts so they all get some coating. 

After the hour, I poured it all out on my kitchen counter which I lined with parchment paper. Here I stirred until cool, again gently. After a few minutes you can put your hands into it and spread it out/stir some more.

After it's completely cool, put it in an air tight container. Looks pretty in cellophane gift bags with a pretty ribbon. 

Thanks for the recipe, this is a keeper!

We love this sweet mix any time of the year. We skip the nuts and throw in a couple more cups of cereal. And we've tried using Chex, but Crispex is just MADE for this recipe, it works perfect. The stirring at the end is crucial so it won't be in a blob. It's a great sweet to have at the holidays that's not a cookie or fudge.

Wow.  This is one awesome recipe!  I made some to give away as Christmas treats and Better Half was SO upset that I didn't save any for us.  He promptly went out and bought the ingredients for our own batch.  It's that good.  It turned out perfectly, but I did have to work very hard to get it out of the baking pan after it cooled.  I think I should've kept stirring it until it was cool enough to take out.  I'll be reading the other reviews to see how others avoided that problem.  Thanks for this super recipe!

Great recipe! I had no trouble with clumping, etc. I added a handful of roasted almonds and pecans just because we like a lot of nuts.  It is good to drizzle around as much as possible before putting it in the oven.  Next time, I might add some cinnamon and cayenne just to add a little kick! Great recipe Trish!!

FANTASTIC! I use any kinds of cereal I have on hand, dry roasted peanuts, stick pretzels and add M&Ms in as well. Pain in the butt if the mixture doesn't get stirred enough while cooling but is absolutely delicious!

This was AMAZING. I have tried many different recipes from this site and I am always impressed. This was no different. I kept the sauce the same but used rice cereal, party peanuts and pretzels. So diverse. I have a family of 7 and needed a snack for my little ones to take to school. They were all eating it as soon as it colled off. I will definately be using this for teacher gifts at Christmas.

I always brown my butter, and used way more cereal..like almost 3/4 of a box each of rice, corn and wheat and used a can of gourmet nuts..no peanuts and also added cheerio type cereal for some interest...FAB!sweet enough but not as sweet It seemed like a lot of caramel when I started tossin it... Happy fourth of July...my first review and this is a keeper!

I made this for a small get together and everyone ate it up, even the neighbor who came by. This is a great mix but it is a little sweet, I suggest use a little less sugar than what the recipe says. We also chopped the almonds instead of leaving them whole, and it was still pretty good. I also stirred every ten minutes instead of every 15, and it was more efficient and less clumpy.

This disappeared at a party we hosted - I got more than a few comments on how delicious it was.  I did a trial run before the party to test the recipe and we ate all of it!  The only change I made was I bought mixed nuts and added pretzels.  Pretzels are my favorite thing in this so it would have been missing something without them.  The only reason for the 4 stars opposed to 5.

This recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS! I made it for a group of Bunco women, and they couldn't stop eating it. I would highly recommend this recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

Loved this!! Tired of paying close to 5 dollars a bag for a sweet crunchy snack? This is perfect and so simple. Makes quite a bit too! Thanks for sharing it.

I really liked the flavor but it seemed to have a lot more chex pieces than nuts (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) so I will definitely add more nuts the next time I make it.  I think it would be great with other types of nuts and also with pretzels, as others have suggested.

I found this recipe very easy to make.  I added pretzels and cashews to make it less sweet. I probably won't make it again.

I really enjoyed this.  One thing I did notice was that the cereal started to get very dark and some pieces started to burn.  My oven doesn't usually run hot, so I kept a close eye on the pan.  I stirred every 10 minutes once I noticed the cereal getting so dark.  And then I ended up taking the pan out 20 minutes early.  I kept stirring every 10 minutes once it was cooling.  It was nice and crunchy and sweet.  I just picked out the burnt pieces.  I would definitely make it again.

Definitely a keeper!  I increased the mixture by another half of everything - just to make sure everything was nicely coated.  I can't stop eating it!

Very very good.  I recently took this to our family's 4th of July picnic.  I had a few people ask for the recipe.  I made some minor alterations to change to my liking.

1.  I doubled the syrup for 2 reasons:  First, I bought a bigger box of Chex cereal and I added pretzles.  Second, I want everything throughly coated.  (It definitely was!)

2.  I also added cinnamon and a splash of vanilla like some other posters have said.  It really added to it.

3.  I used mixed nuts and chopped them with my chopper first.

I will be making this to take on our vacation.  I will be doubling the cereal and adding pretzle sticks (I used the regular pretzles this time).  I will also probably try just almonds and peanuts for my vacation batch.  

ALSO:  KEEP stirring about every 5 minutes while cooling!

This is delicious.  I did not notice it said to use "chopped" pecans and I used pecan halves.  I think it turned out great.  The pecan halves were very good with the coating.

Great recipe!  Always a crowd pleaser.  Even better when you add a bag of the chocolate/caramel swirl chips to make it a bit chocolatey.  Just melt it right in with the rest of the ingredients.  You must continue to stir this about every 15 minutes after it comes out of the oven to prevent it from forming into a large clump (for about 1 hour)

Wonderful recipe - perfect for giving at Christmastime.  We made the recipe exactly as stated (with the single addition of 2 teas. vanilla) and it came out PERFECTLY.  We used a giant disposable roasting pan and it held the entire giant batch with room for plenty of stirring.  The pieces came out beautifully, each piece coated thinly with glossy, crispy caramel.  I think the key is stirring in the oven every 15 minutes without fail, and plenty of stirring as the mix cools.  We made this yesterday afternoon and today it is still crispy and delicious - even here in rainy Seattle.  This one is going in my favorite recipes collection - Thanks!

This mix is so good and sooo easy! I served it last week at my cookie swap party and everyone wanted the recipe. I am making another batch right now for the holidays, I am going to add some m&m's after it comes out of the oven just to see if that extra kick makes it even better.

This is a great recipe. I just made up a batch for my kids to take to the movies tomorrow. They are going to love it.  I just have to stop eating it now.  I think I'll make up another batch for my husband.  I used popcorn, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and raisins.

Look out Lucky Charms because THESE are magically delicious! Yum! I added a 2 tsp of vanilla for a more carmel flavor and as others said, make sure to stif while cooling!

This recipe is very simple.  Almost to simple.  It is missing something to give it that wow effect.  I will probably try a different recipe next time.

A huge hit!  We just used honey chex, pecans, and then added chocolate chips when it cooled! Great!

This recipe is a keeper. We add holiday M&M's--love the extra sweet and salty flavor.  Even my husband, who is not a big fan of "sweet treats" requests this during holidays and gatherings.

This is the best snack mix.  Everyone who's tried it loves it.  Watch-- it is very addictive.  I often substitute corn and rice "Chex" cereal and peanuts.  Mini pretzels are a delicious addition.  Must try.

Not bad but not nearly as good as Sweet Party Mix from this site.  I think the dark corn syrup in the other recipe gives it a richer flavor.

This was really yummy! We mixed rice chex, mini alphabet pretzels, and salted peanuts together. Next time I think I'll try the pecans and almonds too. It was great the way we made it, but I love pecans and almonds. Thanks for the great recipe.

I take this mix to nearly every event I attend and send it with my husband to work during the holidays and it is always a huge hit! Easy and quick to make...I vary the type of nuts that I use depending on what's on sale ;) The last time I made this I threw in a bag of microwave kettle corn and it was fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe Trish!

Was very good and pretty easy. Mixing it was difficult at times because it was so sticky but definetly made up for it in the end with the taste.

Delicious & addictive! Nice and sweet and crisp, and not to mention easy! I made a batch for a party, and had to make another since the first one mysteriously vanished beforehand. (The second time I used walnuts and peanuts instead of the pecans, and it was good, but the pecans were better.) Thanks!

No surprise here!  This recipe was different and excellent.  Makes a lot, too.  Easy, easy, just make sure to stir within 5 or 10 minutes of taking out of the oven.  Added a bag of mini m&m's for color and CHOCOLATE!

This was a great recipe!! I took it to our lake cabin with my husbands family they loved it. I added a tsp. of cinnamon and vanilla and M&M's as metioned by others. It really added a little something to it. I will use this again soon.

This is so yummy! I made this to take to a Super Bowl party but I think I'm gonna have to make another batch cuz it's not gonna make it out of my house! I used cashews in place of pecans- but I think pecans would have been better. Very delicious!

This was so crunchy and so yummy!  I had leftover rice and corn chex from the holidays and used them plus almonds and peanuts.  It was absolutely wonderful.  So buttery, almost like peanut brittle.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the favorite dish from our holiday party out of about 25 items.  We have made it several times already.  Love it!

Great gift for the holidays.  I used pecan halves and whole almonds; I also added cashews.

This was great but I will use less corn syrup next time.  It was a bit too sweet.  After it cooled, I added M&M's and raisins.  IT was pretty good!

You know, if I could give this a higher rating I would!!!! I never know what to bring to our office party. I stumbled across this recipe and decided to make it. It was the hit of our party. Every single person in my department (16) asked me for the recipe. I decided to make it for daycare teachers gifts and family gifts as well. What a great recipe, VERY ADDICTING!!!!!! Love it!
THANK YOU TRISH!

I never really eat what I bring to a party, but when I brought this to a home decorating party last week, I couldn't eat anything else.  It's so buttery, crunchy good.

I am sitting here writing this review as I lick my fingers...this stuff is amazing and addictive!  I have made caramel snack stuff before and it always turned into an awful mess (like caramel corn) and burned in the oven.  This was SO easy and I can't believe how good it is.  I'm trying to keep myself away from it because it's supposed to be for a halloween party tomorrow night.  Thank you for this recipe.  YUM!

This recipe was a hit on Christmas.  Everyone wants a copy of it.  They all loved it, even my 95 year old grandmother couldn't get enough of it! I also made a couple batches and wrapped it in individual celophane decorated holiday bags and passed it out at work.  Great recipe!

This was a huge hit at my office party.  I work for Kellogg's, so I used Crispix mix; since I made a double batch, all of my co-workers insisted that I leave the leftovers at the office so they could snarf on it for 2-3 days AFTER the party!  Rave reviews!  This recipe is a keeper!
