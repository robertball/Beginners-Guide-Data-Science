I loved this recipe!  I did mine in the crock-pot and it turn out wonderful!  I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup (healthy request), 1 packet of beef onion soup mix, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup water and fresh button mushrooms. I put everything together and popped it in the crockpot for 8 hours, and the meat was falling apart.  Also I cooked the noodles aldente and then threw them in the crockpot for the last 10 or so minutes.  The noodles soaked up the sauce and it was wonderful!  Loved this recipe!!!!

This has made its way into the weekly rotation in my house, but I did make a few changes. I use stew beef and season it with onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. I brown it in olive oil before it goes in the oven. For the sauce, I use a can of cream of mushroom mixed with an equal amount of milk, an envelope of beefy onion, and a package of brown gravy mix. The milk gives me twice as much sauce, and the gravy mix thickens it up. It also seems to dilute the salt, because I haven't had any issues with it being too salty.

This recipe is delicious and is great as is. 

However, this time I decided to do things somewhat differently. I love garlic and onions, so I added one tablespoon diced garlic and a small onion, chopped. I make the cream of mushroom soup using 1/2 can of milk, then add the onion soup mix and a little more water than called for. I also add about a tablespoon of concentrated beef broth. I added the onions, garlic, and mushrooms to the mixture and than poured over the meat.

I have plenty of sauce to mix in with the noodles this way. Just a suggestion for those of you who said you didn't have enough gravy at the end.

This is a long time favorite of my family. We usually add more meat, and use 1/2 cup of red wine in place of the cup of water.  Better when cooked at a lower temp for a long period of time (preheat oven to 375 and then turn down to 250 and cook for several hours).  Perfect slow cooker recipe - can be left on low all day long!  Try serving over rice, rather than the noodles.

This recipe is THE BOMB!!! Not only did my husband love it, but my sister's husband loved it as well.  I took the advice to use fresh mushrooms sauted in butter & garlic, browned the meat, then threw everything into the crock pot to simmer for about 5 hours.  The meat was SO tender & flavorful...I could eat this stuff forever!!

This ia a Great recipe. It is so simple. I cut up Round steak (extra). I  simmered the Round steak with chopped up onions. I added extra cream of mushroom soup (2 cans) because the last time I made it I ended up covering it half way through cooking. Also it made more to go with the 16oz bag of noodles I cooked. I used a can of milk instead of water and added sliced fresh mushrooms rather then canned. Served it with biscuits. My husband Loved it. YUMMY !!! Next time I make it it will be half the onion soup mix (Onion soup mix is very salty)
Thank you for sharing .

This was a good hearty meal.  Rather than using canned mushrooms that taste like a can I cut up about 6oz of fresh.  Instead of an entire packet of Onion soup mix I used all the onions and half the seasoning...that would have been a little salty.  I browned the beef tips with a little butter and the soup mix in my pressure cooker, then added the remaining ingredients, put the lid on and cooked for 30 min.  The beef couldn't have been more tender, and my husband loved it.  I'd rather not heat the house with the oven...if ya know what I mean, plus this was quicker, and probably more tender.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy recipe.

I hate to rate this after the changes I made, but I have been looking for a decent beef tips and noodles recipe for so long now and am elated to have finally found it.  So even though this recipe was a starting point for me, it deserves credit.  I took lots of suggestions from others too.  Browned stew meat (bite-size pieces), seasoned with pepper, onion and garlic powder.  I doubled the recipe, so used 1 can of cr of mush and 1 can of golden mush.  2 cups of beef stock for the water, 1/2 packet of the soup mix plus some real onion (to avoid being too salty).  Added maybe a tsp of Kitchen Bouquet, couple splashes of Worsey, 1/4 tsp dried mustard.  Deglazed skillet with beef stock.  All into crock pot for 4 hours.  In the last hour, added the mushrooms and 2-3 pinches of basil (remember to crush between fingers while adding).  At the end, 2T cornstarch in a bit of cold beef stock to thicken gravy (leave lid off, 30 mins).  Total cook time in crock on High, 4.5 hours.  Made 3/4 bag (about 12 oz) of egg noodles and ran a little short, so use a whole 16oz bag for a double batch.  Overall, it was perfect!  My guys ate this stuff up!  Thanks for the recipe and to everyone for all of the added tips.

This recipe was really good.  My husband and I made it tonight and he found it a bit salty.  We added a bit of sour cream and mixed it in....that helped cut the salt and  added some savory richness to the dish.  We will definitely make this again!

This was a wonderful recipe!  We added 1 celery stalk chopped into the mixture and since I have never been a fan of egg noodles nor beef strognaff, we served over brown rice, which is a very nice taste.  Needless to say, I am going to have to double the recipe next time as my family devoured the meal.  Since I have made this a couple times already, some nice side dishes to this, which are also found on this site include Baked Vegetables or Honey Roasted Red Potatoes. Thank you for a great mix-and-go recipe Julie!

Excellent! I read a dozen or so reviews and noted the changes I thought I'd like.
I used: 2 Cans Mushroom soup, 1 TBSP Concentrated Beef Broth, 1 Can milk vs water, 1 Chopped onion, 1 tsp chopped garlic, 1 tsp hot paprika, and 8 oz chopped fresh mushrooms and cooked it all on low in my crock pot for 5 hours. My finicky wife loved it over egg noodles as did I. More than enough gravy / sauce for 4. I'm looking forward to leftovers!!!
DO THIS RECIPE !!!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT !!

I make this all the time, both when I lived alone and now with my fiance.  I like it in the slow cooker with cubed stew meat and omitting the mushrooms (he hates them).  By using the stew meat, I leave it in the slow cooker for about 9-10 hours and it is just falling-apart good.

This dish was easy and tasty but too salty for me personally.  I know it's the soup mix that was the culprit but didn't see any other option on the store shelf. Will probably make again with more beef.  Hubby doesn't do mushrooms so I'll keep those out next time too.

This was a quick meal that I could just throw in the crockpot at the beginning of the day with meat I found in the back of my freezer and a can of soup I found in the back of my pantry. I used one "family pack" of stew meat, Healthy Request mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, garlic and onions that I sauteed in a little butter and olive oil and instead of water, I used a cup of lemon lime soda (I learned this YEARS ago for really tender "steak tips"). I did also add a little fresh ground pepper. I didn't serve this over egg noodles, I served this over whipped potatoes with steamed veggies. This was a good "we're broke", work-with-what-you-got dinner.

i gave this 4 stars because i did changed some things. i used 2lbs of sirloin steak (seasoned with fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder) cut into cubes, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, i package of onion soup mix, 2 beef bouillon cubes, half soup can of milk, half can of water, parsley, minced garlic, 2 tsps kitchen bouquet, big splash of worchestire sauce, 1/2 c. chopped onion and 1 lb fresh mushrooms. i browned the steak cubes in a little butter and olive oil and added the chopped onion and garlic the last few minutes. i put everything except the mushrooms into the crockpot on low. about an hour before serving i put in the mushrooms and turned it on high. the last 10 minutes i sprinkled some wondra flour into the crockpot since the mushrooms gave off extra liquid. this came out so good! served it over rice with crusty french bread and a green salad. i fed 6 people with this and they all raved about it! everyone had second helpings. this recipe could be changed up so many ways to suit anyone's taste. thanks julie for a great base recipe..so glad i came across yours!

Good flavor and very easy. However - I think I will rub - the soup mex on the beef strips first and let it sit a half day or so, beef need more umphf for my taste. Hubby loved it and so did my oldest kid, my youngest like the egg noodles with butter and salt best. Now she has a sophisticated palate! Ha ha. She's 5!

Ok, my fiance gave this a 10! He loved it and wants it once a week. Here's what I did:
I did follow the heating instructions (400 deg) but I think next time I will do it at 375 deg for 45-50 min. 

I bought sirloin tip steak thin and cut it in squares and strips. 

I used fresh baby portabello mushrooms - sliced.
I used one can of mushroom soup and one package of beef onion soup mix.
I put one cup of whole milk and 1 cup of water. 
1 teaspoon of beef seasoned cooking base (Glory Food Brand)
Mixed everything together and cooked for 50 min.
WOW! He's having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

**Next time, he wants me to put in long strips of onion.
Thanks for sharing. It's a winner.

Flavor is good.  I love how easy this is to make.  Sauce isn't quite a full "8" servings though.  We had 4, and that was about it.   WOuld also be better with fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Needs a little something else too, not quite sure what though.  Will play with this again, however., :)

My variation of this recipe includes skipping the onion soup mix and using chopped onion and lots of garlic. I also used fresh chopped mushrooms. I added a 1/4 cup of cooking wine as well for a nice depth to the flavor. I doubled the recipe and we ate half for dinner and the other half goes into the freezer for after the baby gets here. This freezes nicely, just thaw and warm in the microwave for fast dinner!

OMG this is too good!  skip the water and use a can of french onion soup instead. also I seared the beef tips before mixing them with with the sauce.I also simmered everything on the stove rather than using the oven because its 95 degrees out. This recipe is super easy and definitely worth a try, you wont be sorry! :)

I tried this recipe last night---it turned out wonderful!!  I sauted fresh mushrooms with garlic and some butter and then browned the sirloin a little in the mushrooms, I then put it all together in the oven.  The meat was so tender and had a great taste.  My husband Loved it. Definetely a keeper.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 soup can of milk, 1 can of water (instead of 1 cup), an envelope of brown gravy mix, and one chopped onion to the mixture. I served it over buttered egg noodles with parsley & my husband loved it. This is a keeper.

I made this with a large, very thick round steak, cut into cubes.  I dredged the meat Wondra flour and browned them very well.  Removed the meat from the dutch oven, then sauteed some chopped onions and garlic until soft.  Added 2 cans of Campbells Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup (less salt),  1 can of carmelized onion soup, 1 cup of 2 % milk, 1/2 cup water, 1 Tbl. beef base and about 1 Tbl dried thyme and some freshly ground black pepper.  I added the meat back and put into a 300 ºF. oven for 5 hours, until the meat was almost falling apart tender.  (I stirred it once at about the 3 hour mark.)   Served over buttered egg noodles. DELICIOUS! It made a very large amount, so I froze about 1/2 of it to be eaten on a later date.

I'm perplexed by all the "surprised" cooks re the saltiness. COM soup AND Lipton Onion Soup Mix tasting too salty. I bet many of us already knew it would be salty as written. However, I found a nearly Na? free version of COM by Healthy Choice. There, fixed the salt issue. Other than that, I really like this recipe. Yum says the expert cook.

I "tweaked" the recipe a little.  Browned the tips w/ fresh garlic and onions, only used 1/2 the pack of soup mix and used beef broth instead of water.  Cooked in the crockpot on low for 8 hours - delicious.  Family loved it.

This was really, really good. I took a few suggestions and did it this way...I used 1 Can Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic, equal amount of milk, 1 package Beefy Onion Soup Mix, and 1 package of Beef Gravy..WOW! Not salty and it made an awesome gravy!!!

Really good recipe, but as written you're not going to be happy with the outcome. #1 9x13 pan is way too big--I used a 8" diameter casserole and it was perfect. #2 Cover it or else it will be dry shoe leather by the time the hour cooking time is up. #3 Add 1/2-1 cup of sour cream to the mix before baking--makes a delicious addition to the sauce. Served ours over mashed potatoes because they were ready to go bad--tasted quite good. Next time I'll try it over the egg noodles.

This was really good.  I omoted the mushrooms because we don't really care for them. I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Threw it all in the crock pot, kids even loved it. Will be added to the rotation...Yum!!

This is a favorite in our house now; I've made it many times over the last couple of years. I do like to make it in the slow cooker, especially if I'm using a lesser cut of beef (usually a chuck roast that I've cut up). I do use beef broth instead of water and always add plenty more mushrooms. Also really good served over mashed potatoes instead of the egg noodles. Yum :)

This was really good! I did change a couple things as other reviewers had recommended. I opted to use soy milk instead of the water, used fresh mushrooms, I added 2 tbs of sour cream, and I seasoned the meat with some pepper and garlic powder. I baked it in an 8x8 pan at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours covered. The meat was really tender and it was delicious. I served it over the egg noodles. I will be making this again for sure!!

I made this for a luncheon at churhc and served 50 people so I had to customize the receipe. I did not use the onion soup mix or water. I just used beef broth with the soup tips and mushrooms. I also use a slow cooker and cook the meat in the broth for about 5 hours on high then added the soup and lowered the temp. and cooked another hour. You also need to braise the meat before putting it the cooker. Everyone loved this!!!!

This was a very good dinner.  I made a few changes due to what was in my pantry.  I used cream of chicken soup (no mushroom) and plain onion soup mix.  I didn't add any mushrooms, my husband hates them.  It turned out just fine.  I served this over egg noodles with rolls and it was a hit.  Lots of leftovers. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was hesitant to make this because my family isn't a cream of anything fan and this one didn't disappoint. It was beef stew. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was pretty bad. We ate it...it was a meal...but that's about all I can say. It wasn't even good beef stew. I won't be making it again.

I've been making this recipe for many years.  Mine is called "no peek casserole"  Same ingredients as above.  However, you place the ingredients in a covered casserole for 3 hours at 300 degrees.  The meat is melt in your mouth tender.

Well, I must say this is an okay starter recipe, but definitely not a 5-star as is. I had to add more soup to have enough sauce. I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned and thought that was a dramatic improvement. I also added some garlic powder for seasoning. The beef was still quite tough after an hour of baking. The whole thing had a bit of a Hamburger Helper feel to me. I appreciate the easiness of the recipe, but I was looking for something more.

It was just "OK". My children really liked it, but I thought it was rather bland. I gave it 4 stars because my children enjoyed it and asked that I make it again, otherwise I would have given it a solid 3 stars.

I have made this for years in the crockpot using stew meat, and adding the liquid from the mushrooms as well as 1/2 cup red wine. Right before serving I stir in 1/2 cup light sour cream to make a stroganoff. The kids LUV LUV it.

This is a favorite with my family, although I make quite a few changes.  I cook it in the crockpot which makes the meat tender and delicious.  I also make the following revisions:  Chop up an onion and cook it with olive oil and garlic.  Use stew meat and brown it before putting it in the crockpot.  Substitute milk for water and cut the soup mix in half (I found it to be a little salty when I used the entire amount).  I usually double the recipe because it makes great leftovers.

i prefer to make our meals from scratch but needed something quick & thought this one fit the bill because of the many favorable reviews. i followed this recipe as written with the exception of using fresh mushrooms. the end result was a bland & overly salty gravy. even the tender beef chunks & egg noodles couldn't save this recipe. my mouth burned from the saltiness for a 1/2 hour after we ate dinner. sorry julie, this dish is something i can't recommend to others.

Made this in the crockpot instead of the oven, used an extra can of cream of mushroom, plain onion soup mix (not beefy onion), 2 can of mushrooms, and added garlic and onion powders.  It was really good, filling, and comfort-foody.  Will definitely make again and again and again.......

YUM!  What can I say?  I was looking for something quick and easy, but not something that tastes quick and easy.  Cutting up the beef was the most tedious part, and everything else was thrown together.  My husband insists this is a weekly meal.  My two girls had seconds.  My son, a picky eater who only eats PB&J and hot dogs, wouldn't try it, but everyone else loved it.  This isn't the traditional beef tips and gravy, but it's a keeper!  I also used garlic and herb soup/dip mix instead of beef onion, because it's what I had on hand, and I added a little beef base and minced garlic.  Loved it!

Very good, I followed the directions exactly the first time.  I would strongly suggest doubling everything but the noodles.  There wasn't enough sauce or meat  for the amount if noodles. The flavor was spot on!

Great recipe! I used a large box of fresh mushrooms. Probably four times what the recipe called for. I also used two cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and a cup of milk. I had some sauce left over so I served it with spaghetti, Great.

Excellent and easy recipe! Tasted much better than the preserved ones that you find in the supermarket.  Substituted a cup of beef broth instead of soup mix and water.  Added some minced garlic as well.  I will try fresh, sauteed mushrooms next time.  Will use again!

Oh this was the tastiest beef tips and noodles or stroganoff I have EVER had.  Of course, I did change the recipe a bit and it really worked for us.

I used:
2 cups of water
2 packets of onion soup with beef mix
1 C. sour cream
1 can cream of mushroom soup
1/2 t. pepper
1 package fresh sliced button mushrooms
1 pound sirloin

I followed the rest of the directions pretty much to the letter except I covered the dish and cooked it on 350 for an hour and a half.  It was saucy and rich.  I will def. be making this again!

Delicious! I made it twice, once as written and then the second time I tried it with golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushrooms. Maybe next I will double the beef and use one can of each. Very good recipe!

Easy dinner.  If I need to extend cook time because of my schedule I have done 350 for 2 1/2 hours and it worked perfectly.  Don't like leaving the house with the oven at 400.

I made this last night for my husband and he "absolutely loved it!"  He even went back for seconds.  I did take suggestions from a few of you...I browned the meat in grape oil and added some diced onions to the meat.  I also used 2 cans of cream of mushrooms..1 can condensed milk and 1 can of water.  I also took someones advice and added 1 pkg, of brown gray mix for thickening and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  A lot of you were saying it was salty...maybe by adding all of the extras it took away the saltiness, it was mmmmmm, mmmmmm good and I will definitely be making again.  So easy to prepare and so delicious!  Oh, oven...slow cooker...stove top (this is the way I prepared) it must all work. I simmered on low until I was ready to serve...meat was tender and sauce was excellent.  Even had enough for left overs!!!

I followed the other reviews and cooked this in a crockpot. I used two pounds of beef and there was PLENTY of beef. I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk, 1 can of water, 1 packet of the soup mix, and braised the beef in some oil and sauted the mushrooms in some garlic and butter. I also added some fresh garlic to the crockpot. NO salt is needed as this has plenty of salt from the soup. Cooked on low about 5 hrs. I cooked the noodles el dente and added them to the crockpot the last 10 minutes. This was very good and even better the next day reheated. Nice recipe. Thank You.

I'm only giving this a 4 star rating as writen but with the changes suggested by a ton of reviewers it's an easy 5 star!! First thing I did was use a slow cooker becuase it was easier for me. Next I used angus beef eye of round steaks ( 2 1/2 lbs) and cut them into cubes. I also upped the soup to 2 cans and 1 can (not cup) of milk in place of the water.  I did use the whole envelope of onion soup mix but I also added a few rings of and fresh onion (to cut down on saltyness) I also about a hour before it was done cooking I added a envelope of brown gravy mix I wanted to use mushroom gravy but didn't have any on hand. I served it over egg noodle or rice and a biscut on the side. I will make this again

Wow! We loved it. Served on wide noodles. Like "Sara Ann", I made it in the crock pot. I used a bit less water and milk than she did, and canned (not fresh) mushrooms; and regular Campbells cream of mushroom soup. Next time, I'll use two cans; three was too much. I added carmelized onion strips, and 2 tsp chopped garlic. My top sirloin steak ($2.99/lb.) was 1.82 lbs., and the 3 cans of soup made almost too much "gravy." (Glad I cut down on the other liquids.) But it was delish! For me, four hours in the crockpot (on LOW) was optimum. My husband wants this in our dinner rotation every few weeks. Yum!

I made this last night. Very good!I did add all the ingredients plus about 1 cup of red cooking wine. I think I did some minced garlic as well. I added some corn starch to thicken it up as well.

This is an excellant recipe. Husband wanted to know if there was enough left for another meal.  I used a chuck roast, a can of cream of mushroom soup & a can of milk, 1 envelope beefy onion soup mix & 1 envelope of brown gravy mix.  Forgot the mushrooms.  Will add the next time.  I cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours.  Will be making it again soon. I'll have to try it in the oven also.

This became a great recipe with just a few slight changes at the suggestion of previous reviews.  I used 1 can of milk instead of the water, I also sauteed a bag of fresh mushrooms with about 1 1/2 TBLS of butter and 1 clove of minced garlic before browning the meat and then threw the mushrooms, browned meat, can of mush soup and milk in the crockpot and cooked it on low for 5 hrs.  Meat was very tender and had a great flavor.  Served over rice and with corn bread!  Will make again!

I have made this recipe three times now. The first time I followed the recipe as written and it was good, but not exactly what I wanted.  The second I tweaked it a bit and it was better, the last time I hit the jackpot.  I had a 2 pound bottom round steak, I browned it in 2 Tbl spoons of EVOO, dropped it in the crock pot with a can of condensed golden mushroom with garlic soup, a packet of Lipton dried onion soup, a small diced red onion, a diced green bell pepper and a 4 oz pkg of fresh mushroom caps.  I let this cook for about 10 hours on low.  By the time I got home from work the roast shredded easily with a fork.  I served it over egg noodles.  This was the taste I remember my Mom making hundreds of times.  I changed enough it’s almost a different recipe but the family raved.  With the tweaks it gets 5 stars in our house.

This was a really great recipe. We don't like mushrooms at all, so I used freshly grilled onions instead, and replaced the cream of mushroom soup w/ cream of celery. It was still delicous, and was so easy to prepare.  My only warning to those considering making this recipe is that before you put it in the oven, it looks so gross!!  The soups (both mix and condensed) are clumpy and look completely unappetizing. I almost considering scrapping the recipe right then and there. But after it cooks for an hour, this turns out to be a wonderful, thick gravy.  Will make again.

Great idea for beef tips! Did mine a bit differently... coated the tips in light dusting of flour, salt and pepper then browned them in canola oil for a few minutes to get a crusty outside. Put them in the casserole dish. Added 4T butter to the pot and sauteed a whole diced onion, fresh mushrooms and crushed garlic, along with some thyme. Added the rest of the flour used for dusting, browned a bit, then added 2c water and the soup. Added the gravy mixture to the casserole dish, baked for an hour and served over egg noodles. Excellent supper!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I have made it three times. I make it in the crockpot after browning the beef tips. I usually put a large spoonful of sour cream on top of mine! I love that it is so easy to make. I'm putting this dish on this weeks menu right now! One of my fave's!

Excellent, tender, and great flavor!  My husband and I both loved this dish.  Very easy, too!  I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned and the heart healthy cream of mushroom soup.  Outstanding!

I followed the recipe but cooked it in the crockpot. I put the mixture  in another pot once finished and cooked the noodles in that. It was awesome. Will fix this again.

Just add sour cream and this is your basic beef stroganoff.  It's good though.

I made this today and it was so good! My only complaint is that it didn't make that much sauce, but I think I can remedy that by only using half of the noodles next time.

This was a really easy meal to make.  I will make it again.  The 3 star rating was for the meat, which was blah.  I added wine, garlic and onion to the sauce.  Next time I will season the beef and buy premium meat instead of choice beef.

Used cream of chicken in place of cream of mushroom, as dh won't eat mushrooms.  Used 1/2 can cream and 1/2 can water and, of course, left out the mushrooms -would have used fresh anyway.  Used lean stew meat (already cut up).  Served over a baked potato.  Nice, easy, tummy warming meal.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe has a solid foundation but I think it could be improved.  I followed all the directions except I used fresh mushrooms (I hate the canned ones) and I cooked it in a crock pot instead.  I feel the amount of sauce was perfect but needed a little more flavor and could be a little more creamy.  I think next time I make it I will use milk instead of water.  So it has more flavor I will add garlic and paprika or mustard powder might work too.  Using those improvements I will make it again.  This would be great with rice too.

I used beef stew meat and lots of fresh mushrooms and threw everything in the slow cooker. It was soooo good. The bites of meat were so tender that they fell apart. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious, easy recipe that my family loved. I modified it slightly by chopping up half a small onion and browning it in butter and then brown the sirloin pieces with the onion before putting it in the oven. I also used a can full of milk (non-fat) instead of the water and added about half a cup of pinot noir. It was amazing. My husband and boys (7yrs & 3yrs) gobbled it up. I served it over buttered egg noodles and had plenty of sauce/gravy. Thanks for the great recipe. I will make this again!

The flavor was very good and my husband raved about it however, I thought the sirloin beef became tough and dry in the oven for an hour as recipe stated.

Yummy... I used leftover roast (roast was tough).  Cooked lower and longer (400 for 30 minutes then 300 for 3 hours), and did add the leftover gravy for more sauce.  Will definately try as authored as well using feedback from reviewers, I just needed to revitalize leftovers this week.

I didn't think 1 hour was long enough to cook the sirloin tips. Mine came out  tough. Also, I added beef broth and black pepper which helped the flavor.

I made this recipe earlier this week. I gave it a rating of 3 stars because I didn't get the right cut of beef. I tried to go with the cheaper option and use stew beef. I know...that was dumb. The meat was very tough of course. We'll be making this recipe again and I hope to give it a better rating when I use the right cut of beef. :-)

Made exactly as stated. It was pretty good but it was a bit salty and there was not enough sauce to cover all the noodles.  Also I think one hour at that temperature was too long.  I pulled my dish out at 45 min and the meat was very done.

If made as recipe directs, you have far toooo many noodles!  If cooking in a 9x13 I would at least double the sauce or it would be OK to cook in a smaller pan and not dry so much around the edges.
Husband adds sour cream and then thought it was good with still using only 1/2 the noodles called for.

I followed what the other reviewers did - using milk versus water.  Agree that there is not enough sauce for the amount of noodles.  Either double the sauce or halve the noodles, depending on how many servings you need.  Everybody loved it and it was very easy to make.  Only downfall was that meat was on the tough side.  May try crock pot next time to see if that makes a difference.  Otherwise, great recipe.

I added 2 cans of the almost fat-free cream of mushroom soup and used tons of fresh mushrooms that I browned ahead of time. After I finished browning them I added a splash of sherry... YUM! My kids gobbled this up like there was no tomorrow. My 18-yr-old son actually had 3 helpings. I used the crock-pot and cooked on low for like 6 hours or a tad more. We served over egg noodles and stored the extras in the fridge which were great two days later. Enjoy!

I used stew beef, mixed up the sauce and marinated the meat overnight. It was so tender and flavorful. I also served it over mashed potatoes for a twist. My husband had to text my brother and brag on me.

Great recipe with adjustments! I omitted the onion soup and instead sauteed a full onion and two cloves of garlic in olive oil until tender. I added fresh mushrooms to the onions and garlic and cooked until moisture was absorbed.  Then added a glass of red wine.  I also added 2 tspns of chicken bouillon.  I seasoned steak with Montreal steak seasoning and browned the meat.  I added all in baking dish and baked on 425 for 30 minutes the 350 for another 15. Turned out absolutely amazing! Served over mashed potatoes

This was REALLY good, although I'll have to admit that I tweaked things a bit.    I started off by browning the meat in a little oil, garlic powder, minced onion and black pepper. I used plain onion soup mix instead of the beef and onion, a soup can plus maybe another 1/4 cup of milk instead of the water,  about 1/4 cup of beef stock and some left over sangria(!) to taste.  I used an 8x8 glass baking dish instead of the 9x13 and checked on it after about 40 minutes to see how the gravy was doing.  Iit looked a bit thin,  so I whisked two tablespoons of flour into about 1/4 c of hot water, poured it into my dish and it thickened right up.  Yummy!  Will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this dish.  I do agree that the sauce should be doubled. There was plenty for the meat, but if you enjoy more sauce with your noodles, double it.

This was fantastic! I was not prepared for it to be so good. I made some changes because I needed more servings, First I used 1 and a half lbs of meat, 2 cans of soup and one envelope of the Liptons. I then added a tsp of bullion granules and a few good shots of Worcestershire Sauce (my secret weapon for Pot Roast too!) Finally, I added only a half cup of water because I knew I would be baking this dish covered with foil and I did not want it to dry out. I, like another reviewer, was concerned that I was using "beef  for stir fry and saute", but it turned out perfect. Last, I cooked the dish for an hour and a half and then finally, turned off the oven with the dish still in there for one hour. My grandfather was a incredible cook and passed that tip down to me. These were small changes but led to great results.

I love beef tips and noodles! This has been a family favorite for a long time and the only change I make is that I omit the 1 cup of water and add about 1/2 cup of red cooking wine instead. If your sauce is too thick you can gradually add a little water in by the tablespoon. The wine gives the sauce a much better flavor.

Wow! My hubby hates mushrooms AND onions but he said this was better than MY beef tips recipe, LOL. A keeper for sure. Oh, he said it tasted "home made" like momma used to make. Delish!! EDIT - I am making this ONCE again. The past couple of times I halved the water and cooked it in the crock pot. Low for 6 hours, awesome everytime!!

So yummy, so easy. I recommend using fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones, and making this in the Crock Pot to achieve a better taste. Try adding in a couple pinches of garlic powder for something different.

I am a single mother and made this for my daughter (the picky eater) and I last night. She refused to eat the steak, but absolutely loved the rest of the dish. It will go into heavy rotation now at our house. We unbelievably finished it all. Per my daughter's suggestion I will sub the steak for meatballs, which I think will taste equally well. I did use 3/4 of the package of beef w/ onion soupl as others had suggested and it was perfect! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I thought this was just okay. I feel that 400 degrees for one hour is way to long. I therefore cooked it at 350 for 1 hour and to me that was to long. The meat was tough and I just wasn't satisfied. If I were to make this again I would cook it for no more than 45 min. at 350 degrees.

Absolutely too salty. Tastless, bland meat.

This was a very quick and easy recipe to make! However, I made it before reading the other reviews.  I somewhat followed the receipe, however I added a few slices of onion and two cloves of crushed garlic.  I also seasoned the meat with Adobo seasoning and pepper.  I also covered mine with foil, I think this prevented the meat and gravy from drying out.  I also added extra 1/2 cup of water.
I have to admit that it was a bit too salty, however the next time I make this I will use only half of the Lipton's soup mix, which should solve the problem.  I would also like to try milk instead of water.  Other than that, this was a great recipe that will definitely be used again!! Thank you!

This recipe came out way too salty.  We could hardly eat it.  When I read other rviews, I was not concerned because we have many favorite recipes made with cream of mushroom and onion soup.  The problem is most of the liquid evaporated leaving all the salt in the meat.  Using crock pot or covering as others have suggested may help.

Should've trusted my instincts on this one -- another overrated, salty, soup mix entree that I am disappointed with. Some will love this but not us. Even though I tried to doctor it up, it was still bland. Will not be making again.

Flavor combo is great!  But, yes, cut the salt.  I tried it first with half the onion soup as suggested, but still too salty.  The second time, I just purchased low sodium onion soup as well as cream of mushroom soup.  I also used fresh mushrooms rather than canned (salt is in canned).  That did it!  Yummy!  The full package of onion soup added a lot.  Once we weren't overwhelmed by salt, we could enjoy the flavor!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The beefy onion soup mix and the mushroom soup balance each other out really nicely.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Next time I'll use a little less water so that the sauce will be a bit thicker.  I can't wait to make this again!  It's not a dish for serving to company, but guaranteed to be a family favorite!

This is almost the exact way that I make pot roast, but instead of water, I use beef broth (and I didn't add veges).  Reguardless, I threw this all in the crockpot and let it brew.  After a few hours, I added an extra can of beef broth, the egg noodles & some fresh diced mushrooms (vs. the jarred) and let it brew a little longer (until my husband, came home from his trip).  Everyone enjoyed it, thanks Julie.

This is a very good quick recipe. I added to it by 1 cup of beer reduced in 1/2 and 1/2 a cup of water. I did not have beef onion so I used beef mushroom and 1/4 cup green onion . It worked very well . Thanx.

This was excellent.  I will definitely make this again.  I used 1.5 lbs of sirloin for this receipe and used a little meat tenderizer just to make sure the beef would be tender.  It was.  After it was done baking, I used a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  I only prepared 8 oz. of the noodles but still had more than we needed.

I will definitely be making this again!!  Very easy and very tasty.  Some other recipes call for stew beef, but don't give in--follow this recipe and use sirloin, it is worth it.  Like some others, I modifed and made this in my slow-cooker.  Really, really simple!  However, I think you can use less water when making it this way.

This had a good flavor and was quick and easy to put together,  but I did substitute deer meat for the beef. While it would have been delicious, I didn't remember to reduce the cooking time,  so my meat was very dry. Will probably make again,  but with a little less oven time.

Also a long time favorite in my home.  No matter how you prepare this dish, it's hearty, filling and delicious. I cook it on stove top instead of in the oven.  I use fresh onions and small mushrooms.  I prefer broad noodles to rice, but have used both according to my taste at the time.  Just before serving, a dollop of sour cream tops it off sprinkled with a bit of fresh green (parsley, cilantro, chive or whatever you like).  Hard rolls and a colorful salad are perfect sides.  If serving family, a veggie dish or two stretches without seeming like a last minute add on.  This is an easy dish that looks elegant and like you spent ages on it.

We enjoyed this recipe, thank you.

I followed another reviewers advice & first seared the steak tips in olive oil & garlic, prior to adding them to the soup mixture & baking everything. We would have liked more sauce though, therefore next time I will increase to two cans of mushroom soup & another can-full of 1% milk.

We served it over broad no yolks whole grain egg noodles, with fresh steamed broccoli on the side, and fresh baguette to dip into the sauce. 

I'll definitely make this meal again. Besides being fast & easy, it's delicious!

I'm on a gluten free diet and I was able to adapt this very easily.  I browned the meat in seasoned flour before baking and used beef broth instead of water.  Gluten free cream of mushroom soup comes in 12 ounce boxes, so the gravy was pretty thick.  Next time I'll increase the amount of broth to loosen the gravy.

The verdict was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  It was just like I remember having when I was younger.  It was even better the next day.  This recipe will now become a regular feature in my menu planning.

Mmmmm. Reviewed everyone's take. I doubled the sirloin; floured and heat in olive oil until brown. I sprinkled with garlic powder and white pepper, then tossed in crock pot on high. Then in the same pan, I sautéed minced onions in butter, scraping the beef yumminess left in the pan.  When translucent I added a container of sliced mushrooms.  No wine or would have added a cup. Tossed in crock pot.  Then added 3 cans of cream of mushroom (one was low sodium) and a package of beefy onion soup mix. Sprinkled with thyme and white pepper. Added a can of milk and a can of water. Cooked on high for 3 hours, which was plenty of time for succulently soft beef. Poured over egg noodles. Served with oven-toasted garlic bread.  Did I say Mmmmmm?

Outstanding dish!! Halved the water and used a red wine for some umph, otherwise followed recipe to a T! I will be using this again very soon, my only complaint was that there wasn't enough gravy, so next time I will double the soups,and the liquid. Cant wait for leftovers!!!

I have been making a recipe very similar to this for many years and my kids LOVE it.  My family doesn't like mushrooms, so I don't add the can of mushrooms.  (They don't fuss about the mushroom soup anymore, but when they were younger I would blend the soup to get rid of the chunks.)  I usually fill the soup can about 3/4 full of milk instead of using water, and sometimes throw in a chunk of butter just to round everything out.  Also, I always make this in the crockpot instead of baking.  That way I can use a cheaper cut of beef and it's ready to eat when I walk in the door from work.  (I cook it about 8 hours on low using chuck instead of sirloin.)

The flavor was good, but the steak was a little overdone for my taste.  The sauce might work well in a slow cooker for roast.

Couldn't have been easier and the result was delicious. I used the canned french onion soup and some beef bouillon instead of the dry packet simply because I had them here, and it worked out to be the perfect balance of flavor for my family.

Love this! Very easy to make and very filling. I left out the mushrooms as I am not a big fan of them (still used cream of mushroom soup but the mushrooms are so small they're not even noticeable). I found this to be especially great on a busy night with a toddler and a husband.

Love this!  So simple, fast, and easy to make! I have an 11 yo daughter, who is a very picky eater and doesn't normally eat beef, loved it too!  Only thing I would do different is double up on the sauce.

I skip the soup mix and use herbed beef gravy mix. For the water, I don't drain the mushrooms! We love mushrooms so the extra flavor is great. I also use about a cup of milk in addition to the water so it's extra saucy.

Not fabulous, but ok for an easy quick dinner.  I liked it more than my son (who is not a picky eater by any means).  Substituted beefy mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom and added fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Recipe definitely does NOT feed 8 servings and I used more than  1 lb of beef. I think I used 1.4 lbs.  More like 4-5 servings.  Depending on the cut of meat, cook longer than an hour to make sure it comes out tender - I went about 1 1/2 hours, maybe a bit longer. It also helps the liquid reduce for a more saucy consistency.  Finally, it was a little salty - didn't add any extra salt other than the canned soup and beef/onion soup mix. Perhaps reducing the liquid that much intensified the salt flavor.  All in all - about 7 out of 10.

Cooked exactly the way the recipe called for an my meat came out super tough and was very salty.
No real beef taste, just salt. Will not make again.

VERY GOOD recipe. Goes together very quickly, leave a whole lot of left overs for lunches and dinners. It's a new favorite. We made it just the way it's written and I'll be making it again tonight.

This was great!! If your looking for something Quick, easy and delicious to make, this is it!  Although I will admit it took me 3 times to get it right! I felt that the temp was too high and it dried up almost burning.  Second time I added more sauce and while cooking it overflowed.  THIRD time I put it all in the crock pot and it was perfect!  I put 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1 1/2 cans of milk.   Great Recipe!!

This recipe was so delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made it in the crock pot on high for 4 hours and boiled the noodles separately.  I used onion soup mix because did not have the mix with beef and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. I used two cartons of them.  The gravy was on the thin side which was fine by me and  the flavor was great.
My boyfriend enjoyed it very much,too.  This recipe is a keeper. Constance

Easy to make and delicious. I used recipe and added based on other reviewers suggestions. Used 1/2 sirloin and 1/2 stew meat seasoned with pepper, sauteed with garlic and  butter along with 1 onion. Used 2 cans cream of mushroom, approx 1/2 cup of sour cream, a little beef broth, whole package of beefy onion soup mix, a little mustard, a couple of dashes of Lea and Perrins. Placed beef with 1 package fresh sliced mushrooms in baking dish, covered with sauce, sprinkled with parsley flakes and baked (covered) for about 90 minutes at 325 degrees. The meat was tender and the sauce was delicious. Will definitely make again and again. Perfect fall weeknight dinner.

Quick, easy and nicely filling. I modified it a little using 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine. Also added a generous cup of frozen peas for color and added nutrition.

Always delicious. I use the crock pot and normally  fill the bottom with 1/3 to 1/2 cup of Dry or medium-dry sherry . It's a nice enhancement.

Good, simple recipe. Very easy to make and alter according to your personal taste. I use beef broth instead of water, add a big spoonful of sour cream, I use a fresh chopped onion instead of the soup packet. I also add minced garlic and an extra can of cream of mushroom. It is one of my husbands favorite meals.

Made it as is. The taste was good but I only gave 3 stars for a couple of technical reasons. First off, the noodles are way too much for the amount of meat & sauce. I only cooked about 70% of the 16 oz package and had way too many noodles. Second, the sauce almost entirely evaporated and cooked down to nothing. Not sure what the solution is here. Maybe a smaller pan that can be covered? (13x9 seemed too big. Sauce was shallow going in.) Maybe doubling the sauce or the water? Maybe cooking at a lower temperature? I'll try it again, but it will need some modification to work. What I made barely fed my family of four, unless they wanted a ton of noodles.

This is a very good recipe that can be made with much less fat if you use Kansas City Steak AHA sirloin tips and Campbell's 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup. I seasoned with garlic salt and marinated the sirloin tips with some worcestire sauce before baking them(keeps the meat from being too tough) with a TBSP EV olive oil in a frying pan on top of stove.After sirloin browned then added soup mix,cream of mushroom and cut up onions and peas. Cover and let simmer for 5 min.Delicious!!

This was decent. I agree with others that the addition of some sour cream would give it something it lacks as is. Certainly a great jumping off point for some personal experimentation.

I made this tonight for my husband and me.  I did make a few changes, but basically followed the recipe.  I doubled the sauce per suggestions from previous reviewers...I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup (I used the lower sodium kind), almost, but not quite, a can of lower sodium beef broth to replace the water, and I added a big dollop of lite sour cream after it came out of the oven.  Everything else was the same except I did use ribeye instead of sirloin just because I like it better.  We loved it!  With the lower sodium soup and broth, and with the onion soup mix being diluted by twice of the other ingredients called for, it wasn't too salty at all.  I'll be adding this to my rotation.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great guide for a recipe! It reminded me of a creamier boeuf bourguignon. I added red wine and used beef broth instead of water though. Also added a sweet onion and used fresh mushrooms. Stewing beef worked just as well when cooked longer. I loved it on the noodles though! YUM! Family was very pleased!

Definitely not the recipe to cook for low calorie living. I thought this would be a good idea until it reduced down so much that a serving is barely 1/2 of a cup!  I tried a piece though and it seemed to be pretty tasty, too bad it's so high in calorie.

We liked this dish. Prior to baking, I browned my meat and poured the meat and juices into the casserole dish. I then used 1/2 a pack of brown gravy mix and 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix. The taste was really good but a little too salty and my family likes salt. I would say to add a little more water or cut down on the onion soup mix to try and reduce the saltiness.

Delish!!!  I went by other reviews and used fresh mushrooms, 1 can of heathy request cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, packet of brown gravy and milk and water.  I threw it all in a crock pot on high for 5hrs.  This was fabulous and I also went by another review that said to add the noodles to the crockpot about 1hr before cooking was done.  I only ended up using about 1/2 of a bag of noodles and then added some extra water that the noodles soaked up.  I will definitally make this again.

I LOVED this but my husband and son didn't care for it much.  I don't really understand why because they love Jennie's Heavenly Slow Cooker Chicken.  I thought this was fairly similar in style.  Oh well.  I would certainly make it again if they didn't throw such a fit about it.  Cooked in the slow cooker and the meat was fabulously tender.  I was going to put fresh mushrooms in it and then forgot.  Still great w/o them.  Served over egg noodles and a side of peas.

This dish is fantastic! I browned the beef tips 1st. then combined everything in a casserole dish to put in the oven for about 30 mins. I made homemade redskinned mashed potatoes. Served the beef tips over the potatoes with a caesar salad. It was a huge hit!

Very tasty. It was a little on the salty side even though I added a little sour cream. Very good though. Will make again. Thanks

I made this following some of the suggestions. I used 3 cans low fat mushroom soup, 1 cup fat free milk and 1 cup water. It was excellent. Oh, I also did it in the crock pot. Wonderfully easy and soooo good. I was out of noodles so used mashed potatoes.
Thanks for the great recipe.

I was disappointed in how this turned out. I've been looking for a good Beef Tips recipe, and this wasn't it. Cooking it for 1 hour on 400 was too long and/or too hot. I'll keep looking.....

Not bad.  I used beef broth instead of water and didn't use mushrooms.  Served over egg noodles but I think it would be better with rice next time.

Nice, easy recipe!  It's good as is, but even better with a little garlic, 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix, and 1/2c milk to replace some of the water.  I cook it in my slow cooker for 6 hours on low.  It's good over noodles or rice.

This was easy and yummy. I had 2+ lbs of meat so I doubled the cream of mushroom soup, but only 1 pkg soup mix (didn't have beef with onion so just used lipton onion soup mix). Also added a cup or so of milk. Used fresh mushrooms, about 8 ounces. Cooked it in the crockpot, and served over rice. It was delicious. The leftovers I put in a container in the freezer, it will be nice to pull out on a busy day. Next time I'm going to make an even bigger batch, and put several meals worth in the freezer.

If your looking for something to knock your socks off this is not it BUT if your looking for something easy without much prep and still tasty this is it.  I highly recommend cooking this in the crock pot. I used a flat iron steak I had and it still came out very tender. I prepped it the night before threw it in the crockpot the next morning before work. If your feeding 4 I would probably double the sauce. As written there are way to many noodles left over.

used the crock pot. I floured my cubed sirloin steak and browned it with onion before adding it to the crock pot. In the crock pot I had 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and two cans of water and 1 beef bouillon cube. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and it thickened perfectly!

This was the first time I've ever made this, it was wonderful!  The only problem was the cook time.  I know everyone's oven is slightly different.  There wasn't as much gravy as we'd like but once we stired it around the noodles it was enough.  Next time I might double the gravy ing.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe! I did change a few things. I added about 4 ounces of fresh mushrooms, about half an onion. I also cooked it in the slow cooker for about 5 hours instead of baking (just for my own preference). Everything blended so well, and the meat was amazingly tender. My family loved it!!

I really like this recipe, but I don't think anyone should plan on it being perfect right out of the gate.  I read through many pages of the reviews to see what tips people had.  I really liked the way it turned out, but like many recipes I try for the first time there are things I would do differently next time.  I doubled the recipe because everyone in my house likes sauce, but I substituted a can of beef broth for the onion soup mix.  I did brown the meat first since I only had a few hours for cooking and added in onions.  I made it in the crock pot since so many people said the meat dried out in the oven.  I didn't take into account though that the sauce wouldn't thicken up as much this way so next time I would definitely have a thickening agent on hand.  I think people's complaints about it being salty must be related to the onion soup mix because I didn't find it salty at all.  I actually ended up throwing salt and garlic in it half way through when I realized it was under seasoned.  I did add the sour cream toward the end but it didn't blend very well, so next time I will try a tip I read about pulling out some of the sauce and whisk the sour cream into that until its smooth and then add it back in.  The nice thing about using the egg noodles is that they stay nice for leftovers even outside the sauce.  Great recipe and will be fun to play with and modify for my family's taste.

I love this meal - reminds me of one my mom made when I was a kid.  I did think it was a little salty so I'll try sour cream next time.. and fresh mushrooms, as I think they just taste better.  The recipe says it serves 8, but it was enough for me and my husband with maybe one serving left over.  So you may want to double the recipe if you're making it for a bigger group.  Also, I pulled it out of the oven after 45 minutes and it was definitely done.. so an hour would have been way too long in my oven.

My family is very picky. This recipe was great, and the meat came out so tender. I did tweak the recipe a little. I omitted the mushrooms and onion packet. I used beef tips, mixed it with a little garlic salt, and meat tenderizer. Then I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of water, a 1/2 cup of sour cream and added pepper. Then I cut up 1/2 of an onion and added. I cooked in my crock pot on high for 6hrs. When I had 20 mins. remaining I used a little cornstarch with water mixed together and added to the mix, and it made a great gravy texture. Instead of noodles we ate it with rice. My family is very picky, so when I saw my husband and my 3 yr old eat it and want more, I knew it was a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dinner using a sirloin from a regular grocery store and everything as it suggests except 2 cans of mushrooms, milk instead of water, and 3 TBS sour cream just because I wanted to use it up. I think the proportion of meat is somewhat low and the extra mushrooms were good for adding more substance. I think 16 oz of egg noodles goes a long way so if you are eating it with other dishes, you may not need so many. I'm sure this would be better with fresh mushrooms. Also, cooking in the oven as suggested did not make very tender meat, but I don't know if I just bought the wrong cut, or what. Next time I'll cover it. It was very tasty.

Loved it! I too used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, a soup can full of milk and added about a teaspoon beef boullion granules. That made the perfect amount of gravy.  Also, I sauteed onion and portabello mushroom in olive oil and butter, then poured about 1/4 cup red wine to deglaze the pan.  Then I added the soups/water mixture. My store didn't have sirloin tips so I used "beef for stir fry" which I won't use again.   I will use stew meat or better yet, leftover roast meat.

Made with a 3 lb roast, cubed and doubled the can soup (not onion soup mix) for the 'gravy'. Dinner was ready in less than an hour and oh, so tender! Our new favorite.

Good and Easy.  I used fat free mushroom soup and it was still very good.

Great base recipe.  I followed exactly, except I used fresh mushrooms that I satueed in a bit of butter with chopped onions and garlic.  I served over rice instead of noodles.  The final product was very yummy.  This is defintely a recipe I will make again.

This is so so easy and just wonderful!  I made this last night after reading some of the reviews and tips from others - I took advice from a few of them and added milk and doubled the recipe because I wanted lots of sauce.  It is wonderful!  Will make this forever.

I used a cut of steak for this and it turned out great. Full of flavor too. The sauce is very creamy, but there wasn't very much of it. It was pretty dry by the time the cooking time was up. Maybe I should have covered it? We liked this a lot and I will use this recipe again. Thanks, it's a keeper!

This was really good. After reading the reviews, I used milk instead of water. Then I also added 1 can of milk as well a 1/4 c of red wine (doing this will keep the sauce from being too salty, as most reviewers commented on). I also added some cornstarch to help all that extra liquid thicken! Instead of baking it, I put it in a saucepan and simmered for about 10 minutes. I sauteed the beef in olive oil and garlic and added it to the sauce to simmer for another 10 minutes. When the noodles were done, I drained them and returned them to the same pot and poured the sauce and beef over top and mixed it all up and let it sit for the noodles to soak. Turned out really great, had plenty of flavor. Even better, I have leftovers!

This is a easy, minimal preparation recipe, and tastes good.  I wouldn't make it to entertain, but it certainly is good for two of us.  I used only half an onion mix packet (no beef onion) and beef broth instead of water.  I think I would add some milk next time because it was still a little bit saltier than our usual tastes.  After 40 minutes of cooking, I put a sheet of puff pastry on top and made this into a "beef pot pie".  I also added frozen peas and carrots and half an onion, and used fresh sliced mushrooms.

This was an easy recipe that my family liked.  I skipped the mushrooms (kids don't like "big" mushrooms) and added 1 cup of sour cream.  The meat came out a little over-cooked so next time I'll cook at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes.

omg! this was so tasty. I live in a small town and wasn't able to find steak tips, so I substituted stir fry meat (go figure they had that and not steak tips). It came out perfect and everyone, even my five year old loved it. :) great with bread!

Very easy recipe that was delish! I tweaked a little, added 1/2 cup of milk, 2 cans of cream of mushroom (low sodium) and cooked for about 5 hours in my slow cooker. Served over noodles with homemade bread. Great hearty meal.

Delicious! The only changes I made were that I used regular dry onion soup mix, as I didn't have beefy onion on hand. Also, I did mine in the slow cooker and used "stew meat" cubes rather than sirloin. (much more economical) Served over egg noodles with store bought dinner rolls - this takes just minutes to prepare after a long day at work! Thanks!

Wonderful and very enjoyable recipe.  I made recipe as suggested except instead of using 1/2 cup water I filled my cream of mushroom can with milk.  I also placed the mixute in a skillet over medium heat with a cover for 1-2 hours.

This was a very good recipe. I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can of milk with a wire whisk on the stove then added 1/2 cup of concentrated beef bullion and a little over 1/2 cup of water then the beef and onion soup mix. I also bought a thick sirloin steak and cut it up into 2 in pieces then put it in a bowl with two minced garlic, garlic salt, salt, and pepper and let it sit for an hour before putting it in the baking dish. After sticking the meat in the baking dish I poured the soup mixture over it and added some fresh mushrooms then put it in the oven to cook. This was simply delicious and will be added to the regular rotation of meals at our house! Thanks so much!

Love this recipe, have made several variations - I always use fresh mushrooms either button or baby bella, and have used different soups including Golden mushroom and cream of mushromm garlic herb All turn out delicious! I also like to serve with mashed potatoes on occasion.

YUM!  I cooked mine in the crock pot for about 6 hours on low heat.  With about 30 minutes remaining I added some half-cooked egg noodles to the crock pot.  The noodles soaked up the sauce, no need to thicken with corn starch.  My son loved it!

For as easy as this is... it is great.  No extra seasoning necessary.  The meat I used however was kind of tough.  I couldn't find sirloin tips so I used super trim stew meat... wasn't very tender.

This recipe was excellent.  I doubled the sauce as someone suggested.  Instead of using 1 cup of water, when I doubled it I used 1 cup water and 1 cup milk.  Also used 2 pkgs of the beef onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms, and chopped onion. I think if I was making a single batch I would use milk instead of water. We had enough that the 2 of us were able to eat it for 3 days, just changed out the side dishes with it.  Biscuits are a must.  This is a definate "do again".

This was exactly what I was looking for and it was delicious. Instead of beef tips though I used a beef roast that I had thrown in the crock pot that morning before I went to work. When I got home from work I coarsely shredded the beef and set it aside. Then I cooked and drained my noodles (used Kluski dumpling noodles)and put them back into the pot. Then I mixed all the other ingredients together in the same pot with the noodles, adding the shredded beef. I stirred to mix well and let it simmer on the stove for about 20 minutes. Overall it was quick, easy and delicious. My family loved it. Thanks so much for the great recipe. I will make it often.

Good quick dinner, did this in crockpot.  Added extra spices, I think it may have been bland without the garlic, black pepper, and I added some parsley for color.

A good recipe overall, however, I found it to be too salty.  I made a few changes the second time I made it...
2 cans of mushrooms
low sodium cream of mushroom soup
half a package of the soup mix
8 oz. of noodles

This was good and easy to make.  I used 1 tsp. beef base and half a package of onion soup mix instead of the beef soup mix.  I also used low fat cream of mushroom soup and it was fine.  It goes well with peas and dinner rolls.

Delicious! Be careful not to cook it too long or the meat will dry out. Tastes just like what you would get at a diner!

Followed the directions exactly except for the noodles, we subbed mashed potatoes and this dish was absolutely perfect.  Good meal for dinner and for lunch the next day! Thanks!

Having read many other reviews on this recipe, I added less onion soup mix, no added salt, and added red wine and more water to thin the gravy.  I had to add sour cream to the finished dish to try and cut the saltiness.  The flavour was uncomplicated and bland, except for the salt.  It was OK, but I'll not use this recipe again.

This recipe is really easy, fast and tasty. I used two pounds of beef tips because I purchased them for another recipe.  It worked great.  One could also add an onion cut up in large chunks and perhaps some red wine.  Great addition, thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe. Put in 2 cans of mushroom soup and a can of water along with everything else. The sauce was to thin, so next time I will cut down on the liquds for a thicker sauce. Will also try browning the meat first. Husband had 2 helpings, thats always a good sign to me. Thanks for the recipe. Tonight was the 2nd time making this dish and I have to say it was a 10+. Cooked it this time in a slow cooker on low for about 8 hours, what a difference it made.Try it this way and just see how good it is.Mouth watering. Thanks Elaine

I loved this recipe. Instead of baking the meat, I fryed it and then let it simmer in the onion soup, beef boullion and cream of mushroom soup, i did still bake it, but for only 20 minutes. Being a mother of 3, this cut down on time. I loved it and so did the husband and kids, if you can believe that! Thanks!

The flavour was there - but way too salty.  I guess adding another can of mushroom soup or maybe halving the beefy onion mix would help next time. Mmm...

This was a bit salty for my taste, but considering the ingredients, not surprising. The meat came out very tender, and this is so easy to prepare. I would make it again, however, I don't know how anyone gets 8 servings as stated in the recipe, unless they are very light eaters. Four servings seems more realistic with only one pound of meat and 1 can of soup.

Very yummy Julie.  I used beef stew meat and like to serve this with green peas and egg noodles.  This is great with freshly ground black pepper sprinkled over each serving.  My 1 year old enjoys this too.  Thanks for sharing.

My only suggestion is to double the soup, mushrooms, and water.  Not bad, but as written I don't see how 1 can of soup can possibly be enough for a package of noodles.  I will be making this again.

This was a great dish! I had a little hesistation when I first started cooking this meal. I wasn't sure whether or not the beef tips should have been pre-cooked. It was not in the recipe. But once I realized the beef would cook in the broth I was right on. My recomendation: mix the soups and water separately...I had a little issue with soup(beef onion mix) granules.
Thanks!

Yummy as comfort food..I didn't want to turn the oven on, so I saute'd the beef in a little butter, added the soup mix with 1 c water, and let that simmer for about 20 min. Then added the soup, and let simmer another 20 min. At the very end, I added the sour cream and served over mashed potatoes...thanks! it was great!

This is a great recipe! Although I embellished on it a tad. 

I used a can of 10.75 oz cream of mushroom and a 10.75 oz can of beef onion soup, both by Campbells. 

I also marinated the beef pieces in London Pub steak sauce, chopped onions, and thyme for 45 mins or so. Then I threw the marinade, onions and beef in the soup mix. 

At the end, I added in 2 tablespoonfuls of Kitchen Bouquet to darken the sauce and add a bit of savoury flavour. 

I truly recommend this recipe to you, either as it is, or even as a starter for you to add in whatever ingredients suit your fancy. =)

Very easy to prepare and delicious as well.  However, I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I added 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic.  This will be an addition to my recipe box.

I don't care much for mushrooms, so I omitted the canned mushrooms and only used half of the cream of mushroom soup mix. My boyfriend and I both thought it was delicious, but our 2 year old daughter only ate the noodles.

I made this with beef for stew instead of beef tips and it turned out fantastic.  It's the only meal I can recall in a long time that my husband has actually liked so well that he told me!  It will definitely become a regular meal in our home.

So easy and delicious!  Definitely adding to my favorites. The video shows wine, the recipe called for water - I went with the water and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

Making it now. As is. I wish these people would stop editing recipes and telling how great it is. Enter it as your own recipe. This practice, while rampant, is disrespectful to the original poster.

I am only giving this recipe four stars because I deviated from the original recipe (which I don't like to do) but the flavor was definitely five stars.  I decided to put mine in the crockpot and added a cup of milk.  I only used half of the onion soup mix and added flour toward the end to thicken up the sauce.

Like some other users, I also used my crockpot, which worked just fine. Dumping the cooked noodles in the crock pot at the end also worked well. The sauce flavor is quite good, but boy do I regret not searing my tips in a frying pan first to lock in some flavor--they melted in my mouth, but pretty bland. Also, if I make it again, I will double or even triple the mushroom quantity. The mushrooms were VERY tasty (if you like mushrooms), but too scarce--I only got one every 4th bite or so. Good basic recipe, but I'll probably try something new the next time I crave this meal.

This is the second time I've made it.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, but I've found that it was waaayy too salty.  The second time, I followed the following recommendations: brown the beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper; replace the water with milk; add a packet of brown gravy mix. This yielded the perfect mixture that balanced out the salt in the recipe. I'll have to double the sauce mixture next time, though.

This recipe has become a staple. Warning: using bullion cubes makes it VERY salty. I used regular ole elk steak, not an especially tender cut, and this turns out tender and great every time. Thanks for sharing!!!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family!  I tweaked a few things - I used low-sodium cream of mushroom soup to counterbalance the sodium in the soup packet, and I used 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms (LOVE mushrooms!) in place of canned.  I thought the gravy was a bit too thin (Hubs had grabbed ready-to-serve soup), so right before I cooked my rice, I added a  tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in water.

This is an excellent recipe. I doubled all the gravy ingredients using Cream of Mushroom with Garlic soup. I had closer to 2 lbs. of beef also. By doubling, I was able to simply combine the 12 oz. of cooked noodles with the beef tips and it was a perfect ratio. The family enjoyed this as well, which means it will be added to my meal rotation.

This is a quick and easy favorite. You can use sirloin or stew meat,I usually use whatever is on sale. The dry soup mix makes it a bit salty so I add a bit of cream or half & half which helps cut down on the saltiness and also gives it a nice creamy sauce and great taste!

We really liked this but cooking for a full hour at 400 degrees is too long/hot as the sirloin became quite dry. Next time I'll cook it at a lower temperature or for less time.

This is a great recipe.  I made it with stew meat, in the crock pot and I doubled the recipe.  I omitted the mushrooms, cause my children do not like them.  I used one can of Cream of Mushroom and one can of Golden Mushroom and two packages of the Beef and Onion soup mix.  I also added two little tubs of the Knorr Beef Homestyle Stock.  Cooked on high in the crockpot for 7 hours and it was perfect.  I cooked my noodles at the end added them to the crockpot to cook for a just a little longer.  There were leftovers, but not after the second night! Huge hit in my house, kids loved it!

I did not have time for the oven, so I cooked the whole thing on the stove in a 12 inch skillet. Worked beautifully except the meat was probably not as tenderr.

Made to spec, one exception - I combined the ingredients in the morning, mixed completely and then put back in the fridge for the day so I could just come home and toss it in the oven.  I really liked it, and had leftovers today for lunch and I liked it even more.  This will be a regular in my rotation.  Thank you!

Simple, easy recipe. Alterations: I didn't add mushrooms, crushed the onion soup mix first, browned the meat beforehand (added the juice to the gravy, minus the fat) with a little canola oil, and then i added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 milk instead of 1 cup water. It was pretty good. We ate everything on our plates - which rarely happens in this household, but alas, wasn't as good as my mom's.

My husband really loved this and I liked it as well but it is salty.  I'm not dinging the recipe for it because I knew it would be...the reason for 4 stars is because I changed things up quite a bit.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of stew meat, added a can of beef consomme, a 1/2 a pound of fresh mushrooms quartered instead of canned, a clove or 2 of garlic, about 3/4 of an onion sliced and some red wine for deglazing.  I used one can of milk instead of water and 8 ounces of egg noodles.  I browned the meat in some oil in a cast iron pan, removed it and then lightly sauteed the mushrooms and onions, adding the garlic at the end.  Deglazed with the wine - added the meat back in and the rest of the ingredients (sans egg noodles).  I cooked in my pan for about 2 hours on 375.  Next time I will try 1/2 the soup mix to try and cut back some of the salt use only the recommend pound of meat and I will cook it at 350 for a couple hours.

The meat ended up being a little tough, and not enough sauce for  quantity of noodles. Next time  I will try doubling the meat and sauce, and cooking it on low in the slow cooker. The flavor is delicious though!

Turned out pretty good!  Used a can of cream of onion soup instead of the water but didn't change anything else. Some red wine probably would have added good flavor but I didn't have any on hand. Had plenty of gravy. May use a little more meat next time. Slow cooked all afternoon on Low, stirred it up a few times to ensure even cooking. This recipe is a keeper.

I have been making a similar version of this recipe for many years. I've used sirloin, london broil and even chuck steak. I do like to use a lot of mushrooms. I also use a buillion cube instead of the onion soup and use diced onion.

I really like the flavor of this recipe. Another tried and true easy way to make this is to use stew meat, 1 can each of condensed cream of mushroom, cream of celery, cream of chicken and liquid canned French Onion soup. You don't have to brown the meat. Just pour soup on top of meat, stir cover and bake. I never 
add water.

Everyone loved this recipe. Even the picky kids in the family. I used venison rather than beef just because I had some to eat up and it is leaner. I also used whole wheat noodles. Made for a much healthier meal.

Yes I did it in the crock pot using red wine vs the water. Made it for Christmas dinner ( just 3 of us) made a favorite corn  bread as a go along.  Spooned over buttered noodles it was terrific. This will be a favorite go to dinner. A real winner.

This is a tasty dish. I did sauté onions with the beef to brown the meat before baking. Adding 1/2 c wine gives it a great flavor, too. This is quick to assemble and smells great while cooking. Once it is in the oven, you can adjust the temperature to allow baking for as long as you need. You can start it baking at 375* and turn it down to 300* ; let it cook for 2 hours, if you need the time.

Good, but with a couple of changes, great! PLEASE use Golden Mushroom soup instead -- it makes all the difference -- along with fresh mushrooms sauteed with garlic and onions. If you want to enhance just a bit more, try a little sherry and catsup. It's a good basic recipe though.

This is a great cheap meal, when the only thing in the freezer is ground meat (beef or venison), I substitute that for the beef tips.

Love this one. I used fresh sauteed mushrooms as I had them on hand and skipped the salty onion soup (blood pressure). I subbed in dried onion and a low salt bouillion.

I wasn't a huge fan of this. The gravy tasted really good (I added garlic) but I felt like the meat would have been a lot better cooked in a skillet.

This recipe is great for a week night. I make with a few changes. I use stew meat and season it. Also I double all the ingredients for the sauce. That way there is enough to go around. Also, I really watch the cooking time. If you cook it to long the meat will be very chewy. One hour is way to long for me.

This was pretty good but a little salty.  If I make it again, I'd definitely try to cut down on some of the salt.  I also couldn't get it to thicken up like I'd liked it to.  I ended up using quite a bit of cornstarch, which I think gave it a strange consistency.  It still tasted good but looked funny.  I'll have to try it again to see if I did something wrong the first time.  Still tasted great though!

My family loved this recipe, I however substituted the water for milk and put in the crockpot for 6 hours. I also took out half of the powdered mix from the onion soup mix so it would not be to salty, I also used 3 cans of mushroom soup.

Nice, simple comfort food recipe. Like other reviewers, I found the recipe a little too salty. The second time I made it, I substituted the soup mix with 1 package of Clubhouse sodium reduced brown gravy and 1/2  tsp of onion powder. My family gobbled it up.

I haven't been this excited about a new recipe in awhile - we absolutely loved it! Yes this is salty, but the gravy is so good and easy. My cubed rump roast was wonderfully tender baking this way. I'm really excited about using this recipe for potlucks or parties. Thanks so much for sharing!

I did not care for this recipe. not sure what i did wrong. browned stew meat in oil with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. used a can of organic cream of mushroom soup, then filled the can with milk and added that. skipped the water. used onion and mushroom soup mix. Didn't care for the flavor and gravy was soupy, despite adding cornstarch in an effort to thicken it

I made this in a crock pot with the half cup of red wine (like in the video), and added pepper and garlic.  Towards the end, I added noodles from Grandma's Noodles II recipe on this site.  This was a very good meal!

This was just OK but it was too bland and tasted like a Hamburger Helper thing. It needs additional seasonings but I am not sure which ones.

Loved how easy and tasty this is. I doubled the recipe but I didn't double the onion soup mix. Plus, I added 1 1/2 cups of milk and several dashes of Worschshirer sauce. I browned the meat and threw it all in the slow cooker.

I use a couple pounds of round steak, no mushrooms and  a couple of cans of cream of mushroom soup.  After I take it out of the oven or crockpot I add at least 8 ounces of sour cream. Delicious.

A friend of mine gave me this exact recipe and my family loves it every time! You can add a bit more water or milk if you need more gravy. I did about 2 cups of water and it was still good (and a little less salty).  I also tried this recipe with other types of meat like pot roast (with carrots, celery and mushrooms) or chicken thighs.  It always works out!

What a great recipe!  Very tasty and the meat melts in your mouth.  Only thing I did different is I used beef broth instead of water as suggested by other reviews.

its better to add a small can of cream of mushroom along w/ the large can, as for the water i used the one large can and the small can and filled them w/ water once to be sure I got all the cream of mushroom soup out. I also precooked the meat in oil and flour and when it was brown all around then I put it into a slow cooker w/ the soup and water and onion soup mix. I omitted the mushrooms. You can use it w/ any pasta or mashed potatoes or rice or whatever. this is the only way I fix cubed steak or deer cubed steak its so good, and it falls apart w/ a spoon. I cook it in a slow cooker for 4 hrs or more on low or high it doesnt matter buts so good this way and so much easier.

This was great! I didnt have the Lipton soup mix so I subbed a packet of brown gravy mix. The meat wasnt chewy and the flavor was great. Again, no noodles so I used mashed potatoes but the star was the meat and gravy. Awesome recipe!

I used tri-tip, No Yolks egg noodles, 2 cans of canned mushroom soup, fresh cremini mushrooms, 2 cans of milk instead of water, a whole package of brown gravy, 1 clove of grated garlic and 1/4 cup of Merlot. Salt is not needed at all here. Black pepper yes. Cooking in slow cooker for hours is not necessary either. 1 hour on middle rack in the oven and everything comes out perfect. Very tender beef and devine sauce. A sprinkle of fresh parsley over the top for garnish would be great too. Serve with dinner rolls. Excellent.

This has got to be one of my favorite dishes and the main reason I signed up for allrecipes.com 
I use frozen beef cubed and throw it into the crock pot on low for the day with the rest of the ingredients. I make the noodles when I get home. It is amazing! As a midwest favorite, mashed potatoes are served as well!

Really enjoyed this meal- as did my boyfriend! The good thing is that you can add whatever seasoning you want that caters to your specific taste. I added some gravy mix, chopped garlic, and extra water for more sauce. I feel like the smaller the steak tips are the better.  Serve it over egg noodles with a side of veggies and dinner rolls and this is the perfect hearty meal.

This recipe is amazing! My favorite meal is beef stroganoff, but I wanted to make a healthier meal, so I tried this. I added about a half cup of milk, a tablespoon of garlic, and one 0.35 oz packet of Swanson concentrated beef broth. This meal was to die for and it was so easy!

This was okay, personally I just do not like the onion soup mix.  I had a 1/2 pack and only used that much but could still taste it.  Will try to find a sub next time for it or just leave it out.

I made this for dinner, it sounded very good, & simple to make. It was aweful .I read the reviews & saw other's said it was salty. The gravy was very thick. But thought I would give it a try,  I did give 1 star since it was simple to cook.

Super comfort food.  My hubby loved it.  I used fresh mushrooms just because I had them and needed to use them.  I put this in the crock pot instead of the oven.  Turned out great.

Adults in the family liked it.  Kids not so much.  I think the flavors were too strong for them.  Probably won't make it again without significant changes.

It was a little salty and the sauce seemed to evaporate in the oven.  I think it's probably because I didn't add the mushrooms because we don't really care for them.  But my husband really liked it!  I think I will only add half the soup mix next time and maybe a bit more water.  Either that or cook it in my crock pot.  All in all the flavor was good and it was a very easy recipe!

An easy, one-dish meal perfect for weeknights.  Maybe next time I will throw in some more veggies.  It did make my house stink to high heaven for about 24 hours (very onion-y).

Here are the changes I made: I used pork tenderloin not chicken.  I used milk not water.  I increased the mushrooms too.  I had 1/2 can of 10 3/4 oz tomato puree left and I mix it in.  I baked the dish at 300 degrees for 2.5 hours.  30 minutes before I took it out, I added some peas.

Has become a weekly meal in our house.  I make just a couple changes.  First, I brown the meat.  I use 3 cans of soup, 1 cup water and 1 cup milk, beef onion soup mix and 2 packages of brown gravy mix,  I then bake it in the oven.

Followed advice to brown tips in onion (added green peppers for add'l veggie) and ended up saving about 15-20 minutes as got idea to combine ingredients in pan after tips were browned, used onion-mushroom dry soup (had on hand) and 1/4 c beef broth combined with water, added few twists of garlic pepper mill and simmered about 15 minutes. Hubby raved "very tender and flavorful".
Great basis!

LOVED THIS! It takes awhile to cook but well worth it. Crock Pots are my sworn enemy so this oven version made me SO HAPPY!! I made it even healthier by using "No Yolks" noodles, which basically has no fat!

I made this as stated and it was ok, but not something I would make again as it.  The canned mushrooms are salty, would have done frest this time if I had them.  Even with that change I think it is a little bland.

Tasted like tuna casserole, but with beef. Very salty, but little depth of flavor.  I will not be making this again.

This was awesome! Made a few changes as other reviews dictated. Used golden mushroom soup, cream of mushroom soup, beef broth in place of water.

I make this fairly often and the wife and kids love it. The only thing I do different is cook the meat at a lower temp for a little longer to get the beef a little more tender.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to make it without the mushrooms because my boyfriend won't eat them but it was soo yummy and I'm sure it's even better with them.  Kiddo loved it too!  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because boyfriend wasn't a fan.  Psshhh what does he know though.  :-)

FABULOUS! I did tweak it abit to my cooking style. I dredged the meat in pan searing flour and then browned it butter, garlic and onion. I then threw it into the crockpot with the soup mixes, a can of milk, a can of water and another 1/2 cup of water to dilute the saltiness of the soup mixes. Added some freshly sliced mushrooms and walked away. My husband and son made sure there weren't any leftovers.  Will definately be making this again! Thank you for the fabulously easy recipe!!

I had to cut the recipe down to 2 servings so my cook time was shorter and I browned the beef in butter before putting it in the oven but it still turned out great! Will be making again!

I made the beef tips for my husband and a few friends and it was a total hit! The only change I made to it was that I seasoned the beef with a little salt, pepper, and garlic. It was delicious!

OMG This is such a good recipe. Me and hubbs ate so much that our tummies hurt. Next time we make it we are going to put carrots, potatoes and peas. Make it like beef stew. We had it over eggs noodles. It was really good.

I've made this dish several times and served it different ways.  It was delicious however I did doubled the gravy mixture (used only 1 can cream of mushroom soup).  I've served it over noodles, mashed potatoes and top it off with cooked baby carrots on top of it~almost like mini pot roast.  Yummy!

The flavor was good but the meat was pretty chewy.  Next time, I think I will take someone's suggestion of cooking it in the crockpot.

Excellent Meal! I used 1 can of beef broth in place of the water & 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Before serving I cooked egg noodles and added them to the beef mixture. This was so easy & excellent.  It was a huge hit with my picky family. Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy and very tasty.  I only had onion soup mix, I didnt even think about adding this beef broth stuff you mix with water.  I also think I had more than a pound of steak, it might have been 2 pounds but I didn't increase the other ingredients and it was still just fine.  I also used fresh mushrooms that I needed to use up.  I cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours.  It was great with the noodles and would have been really good over mashed tators also.  Thanks for sharing.

First off, I've ALWAYS been afraid to make anything from cream of mushroom soup because I HATE mushrooms, but I decided to give this a try.  WOW!!!  So good, does not taste like shrooms at all!!  I made the recipe x's 4, used stewing beef cubes seasoned with garlic and onion pwd, salt, pepper and worchestershire sauce.  Used 3 pks of the pwd only from the onion soup mix and 1 packet dry brown gravy mix.  I also used beef stock instead of water.  Tossed everything in the crockpot for 6-8 hours and served with mashed potatoes! The gravy is soooo good.  Tweaked the seasoning as it cooked.  Fabu!!  Thanks Julie!!

Love this recipe! I cook it in the slow cooker on low all day.  I also use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of one.  I use Lipton Soup Beefy Onion Mix.  When I get to the last hour of cooking I add 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I love serving this over mashed potatoes!

The flavor was awesome, but the beef I used wasn't tender enough for my liking after just an hour of cooking it.  If I make it again, it will definitely be in the crock pot for tender meat.

Very good with some adjustments.  Used a siroin tip steak, browned in iron skillet, fresh mushrooms and onion, and put in slow cooker with sauce of two cream of mushroom soups and beef onion soup mix.  At the very end, I stirred in cooked whole wheat wide noodles.  So delicious that I hid the leftovers for myself!

I tried something different with this recipe...I did like so many others make simple adjustments. Used a pound and a half of stew meat, I added about a half cup merlot, no water...substituted it with half cup milk...seared the beef first and used 2 cans of soup along with the onion soup mix. I baked it for an hour and fifteen, then spread mashed potatoes on top and baked again until the potatoes were slightly browned.It was fantastic!

I thought this was great!  It did seem a little thick, so I added some sour cream and milk about 1/2 cup to milk & and 2 tablespoons sour cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Meat was not as tender as I would have liked. Gravy was delious. Maybe I will try to in crock-pot to create a more tender meat. I used a sirloin cut. Update: used sirloin again but took adivce of fellow cooks & uused some milk & started @ 375 for 20 mins then drop temp to 250 for a couple hours. Delish will make again & again!

I was using up the left over pot roast in this meal.  It was AWESOME!  And very fast!  We used "Reames" frozen egg noodles.  I mixed together the sauce (mushrooms cooked separately due to picky eaters here), heated it to a slight boil, added the left over diced pot roast until heated through.  Then we just mixed the noodles, sauce and beef together and served.  QUICK! EASY!! & TASTY!!!  Liptons and Campbells combos are normally awesome like this!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  We will keep this one permanently.

Good and Easy!  First time I followed directions exactly and it was decent but needed tweaking.  Last night added 1/2 carmelized onion, extra mushrooms, and used 3/4 milk, 1/4 sour cream instead of water - fantastic!  One note: this fed 2 adults with a serving leftover for lunch - if I was making for 4 I'd have to double the recipe.

I found this recipe over a year ago and every time I make it, I love it. Don't know why I don't make it more often. Simple to make and very tasty. I found it works better in the oven instead of a crock pot. The gravy was more creamy the first day. Crock pot method was better the second day as leftovers.

This was very good!  My family really enjoyed.  You will definately need 1.5 lbs of meat.  I used extra lean stew meat.  Plus, I cooked for 15 minutes longer.  Using the reduced fat soup and wheat noodles makes this dish a little healthier.  I also used fresh mushroom instead of canned.

I really loved this recipe.  I'm sure it was fantastic as it stood but I wanted to put a spin on it. 1 1/2 cans of the mush. soup.  1/4 cup white wine.  2-3 cans of water.  1 TBS oyster sauce.  Pinch of garlic powder.  Can of Shitake mushrooms.  1 large red bell pepper sliced.  Served over rice (my boys used noodles).  AWESOME FLAVOR!

Made this in the crock pot and it almost didn't make it to the table for all the "sampling". Took another reviewers' suggestion and substituted red wine for the water (always looking for a recipe I can slip wine into)and it turned out delish! Thanks so much for this one, Julie.

My wife and I often order sirloin tips and spaetzle at a German restaurant in northern Minnesota. This is very similar if you serve it over frozen noodles.(we break them up before putting them in the water) We've also learned that we can use leftover roast beef and just heat everything up in a sauce pan on top of the stove. It's perfect for a quick and delicious weekday supper.

Great recipe!  I browned the meat first, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly except for using fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  It was amazing.  Even my picky eaters loved it.  I must say that it was twice as good the following day.  Certainly a keeper.

Wow!  Even without the wine, this is awesome.  I used trimmings from a roast and made it in a crock pot.  It was even better the next day.  I might add pearl onions.

Pretty good. I didn't saute the beef, just baked it with the rest of the dish for an hour and it came out fine. It was a little salty for my tastes, however, so next time I will get low sodium soup and use less of the beef/onion mix.

Very delicious. My only complaint is that it came out too runny, but I'm not currently remembering what I did, and my notes are not with me. So helpful, I know! Will update later if I can. But it's almost a moot point, because it was still very, very good.

This was delicious and easy! From others suggestions, I used milk instead of water to make the soup mixture. It was so good and made wonderful leftovers!

I was happy to find and try this recipe, I only modified it by adding 1 more can cr. mush soup and 1 C. milk and using my slow cooker instead of oven for a quick weeknight dinner. My husband really liked it, and my 2 yr old ate his whole serving and none ended up on the floor...good sign! This will be in my regular dinner rotation... I love the idea that it worked out so well with my crockpot.

This Recipe was quite tasty and so easy, though next time I'll use less beefy onion mix b/c the entire pack made it far too salty.

Works great in the pressure cooker also!!  I added 1 cup of beef stock to the recipe to give it a bit more liquid for pressure cooking.  I brought up to high heat to get it rocking gently then turned down to medium high and cooked for 18 mins.  Removed from heat and let the pressure come down naturally.  Great flavor!!  Thank you!!

Loved this recipe. Super easy and super tasty. This will become a staple in our house. Only recommendation would be to use low-sodium soup if possible. It was bit salty.

This was outstanding!! My husband loved it as i did to. I didnt use as much of the egg noodles as the recipe called for,good thing because the noodles really suck up the gravy. I had to add a little extra milk to loosen it back up. But overall excellent!!THANKS

I am giving this 5 stars because my kids and hubby scarfed it up and requested it be added to the dinner rotation.  I knew that as written this would be a tad too salty for us so I used 2 cans of low sodiuim soup and 1 soup can full of milk; I also skipped the onion soup mix and just used fresh onion and fresh mushrooms (canned are salty even if you rinse them well). I had plenty of gravy and it was very tasty.  Next time I make this I will use home made cream of mushroom to reduce the sodium content even further. Tasty and simple, thanks for the recipe.

Great taste, but I wish I had read the reviews first. I felt there was not nearly enough sauce left after it baked and the beef on top did get a little dry. That being said I think adding another can of creme of mushroom and maybe milk instead of water and you will definitely have a winner here.

I'm going to give this a 4 just because I made changes. First off, I did this in the crock pot on low for 8 hrs.  I took advice of others and used milk instead of water, 2 cans of soup (I just had 1 CoM so I used that and 1 Cream of Chicken).  Only used half pkg of regular onion soup mix and used half pkg brown gravy mix. I only had the stew meat on hand and yes, it does get very dry.  In the end it was very soupy so I put the noodles in just before eating to soak up some of liquid rather than adding cornstarch.  Will definitely make again with different meat.
***UPDATE: 01/07/10 I made this using sirloin this time and I also tried the oven version.  I had extra meat but not an equivalent amount of other ingredients so here is what I used:  1 1/2 lb sirloin, 1 1/2 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup milk, 1 pkg beefy onion soup mix, 1/2 pkg brown gravy mix and 1 1/2 cups water.  This had good reviews from the family!

This is much better if you use beef consume soup & onion soup mix.  You can either cook in the oven or in the crock pot

Made this last night. It has great flavor, but let me warn you...DO NOT add salt. I seasoned the meat and sauce with salt like I would any other recipe and it was way too salty!! I could hardly finish mine.

Yummy!  Next time I make this I will look for less sodium soups as this was a bit too salty.  I doubled the cream of mushroom soup.  Served it with noodles and mashed potatoes.  Can't do this one every week, but today I was in Carb heaven!  :)  I have a child that is allergic to milk, so I went to health food store and bought a portabella mushroom soup that is dairy free, so he was also able to enjoy this meal!

This was easy, and really good but next time I will definitely use only one packet of onion soup mix as it was very, very salty, and I'll try fresh button mushrooms and a little red wine for about 1/2 the water.  I buttered my noodles and sprinkled fresh parsley over them, then put the beef and gravy on top and it was delicious!!

Very easy and delicious recipe! It was a bit salty, so I'm going to use a low sodium mushroom soup next time or perhaps just half the beef/onion soup mix. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was GREAT!!! I followed the recipe exactly with a few  alterations. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt, pressed garlic, sea salt and pepper. I chopped an onion and put it into the mixture. I also sauteed fresh mushrooms in white wine, pressed garlic, olive oil and butter before adding to the beef tip mixture.  I was worried that the tips would could come out tough, but that wasn't the case at all!! The meat was tender and delicious! Instead of egg noodles, I paired the dish with garlic mashed potatoes and blanched green beans. Everyone LOVED IT!!!! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely use it again!!

I *really* loved the gravy in this dish.  I used 2 cans CoM, 1 envelope beefy onion mix, 1 cup water, 1/2 c red wine and 1/2 c milk.  I wasn't too thrilled with the beef but will definitely make again, probably with ground beef (meatballs maybe)?  Thanks for the base recipe, I'll just adjust in the future to suit our tastes a little better! **Updated: Made with meatballs and this was delicious!  Thanks for the idea.**

This was very good.  I didn't find it too salty at all.  The sauce was a little thin but that could have been because I covered it while baking.  I will be making this again as my husband really liked it.

YUM! I used campbells lower sodium and then cut back a bit on the soup mix. I also added tons of garlic and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I LOVED this! I'll make again.

LOVED this. I used beef broth instead of water and next time I may add a little red wine like others have suggested, and also onion which I didn't even think about until I read it in someone else's review. I also added a good  bit of fresh cracked pepper because I love pepper. We all liked this. I served it with King's Hawaiian rolls and a vegetable.

This was good and really easy to make but lost a star because it is so incredibly salty.  I even used the Healthy Request mushroom soup so I can't imagine how much saltier it could have been.  Next time, I will cover with foil before baking so it stays saucier, use a can of no-salt mushrooms, and maybe add a touch of sour cream to help cut the salt.  Otherwise, a good recipe and would be easy to make in the slow cooker.

this recipe was excellent. Easy and tasty. I made it in the slow cooker. I did look out for the saltiness one reviewer mentioned so i used campbell's 'Healthy Request' mushroom soup (it's low in sodium) and it was perfect. I highly recommend the recipe.

Thought I'd be clever (and not heat up the house) and make this on the stove as someone else had done.  I think it would have turned out better for me if I hadn't been distracted and the beef tips and gravy got burned!  Will try again because I can see where this would be an excellent dish when not burnt all to heck.  I gets three stars even when it is burnt to heck!
Oh...added some red wine as someone else had suggested and I will do this again too.

Wonderful.  I used beef tenderloin as that was what I had on hand.  I read a lot of reviews and ended up using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of milk & 1 can of beef broth. Added a dollop of sour cream at the end.  Family loved.  Thanks

I followed Dee Dee's advice and made this in a slow cooker. After about 5 hours of cooking it was an amazing dinner. I added ALOT of garlic(we are garlic fiends!) and served it with homemade dinner rolls. Very easy and delicious recipe.

Has a ton of potential, but just wasn't flavorful enough for our family.  Some red wine, maybe?

My family really loved this. My daughter even took the leftovers to school for lunch. The only thing I did was listen to below reviews by adding 1 cup of milk, 2 cans of soup and 1 cup of water. I also added 2 beef bouillion cubes because I didnt have beefy onion soup mix. And I did add a little bit more of the dried chopped onion. I will make this one again.

This was a very simple way to prepare tender beef tips.  I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end of the baking time.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I would have said 5*, but it was salty as others said.  Next time I will add only 1/2 packet of the onion soup or will double the sauce with 2 cans of cream of mushroom.  I did use 1/3 cup of red wine and 2/3 cup of water.  Excellent flavor!

I made this via the good 'ol crock pot method.  It was good.  I added some caraway seeds and tabasco sauce for flavor.  It was great!  You could also use rice instead of noodles.  I'll be making this one again.

This is the BEST recipe ever for been and noodles.  It is really important to use sirloin tips like the recipe states.  Don't try to substitute the cheaper "stew meat" in the meat case at the grocery store.  i have used it before and it turned out tough and gross.  The sirloin is tender and wonderful.  Also, I covered mine with foil and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours.  My four year old son said that the dish was fantastic!

Mmm, SO easy and SO good. Very warming dish to serve on a cold day and even easy and quick enough to prep on a weeknight! My only complaints were the saltiness and the lack of gravy. I may add more water next time to "dilute" it a bit and add more liquid. Still delicious though!

This was very quick and easy to make, especially since I had leftover grilled sirloin in the fridge. I used 2 cups of beef broth and 2 cans of golden mushroom soup to make more gravy. It was delicious and also quite easy on the waistline. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and threw everything in a crockpot and cooked on high for 4 hours.  I also added black pepper for additional flavor.  I then mixed in the noodles before serving and everyone loved it!

This was good for a healthy meal.  I added onions, garlic and beef boulion for some extra flavor.  I also put it in the crockpot and the meat was very tender.  Next time I will make a double batch of meat/sauce to match the amount of noodles.

This was good. I left out the mushrooms because we don't do mushrooms. I doubled the sauce as suggested and added some milk. The sauce was great but I think we could have used a little more with all that pasta.

We loved this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes because I only had stew beef.  I browned the beef first.  I used 1/2 a package of onion soup mix and 1/2 beef bullion cube (again I only had onion soup mix).  I baked in a 9 x 9 dish, covered, on 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  I was very tender and OH so yummy!  This goes in my recipe box for good!!

This was great, especially due to how easy it was. In my opinion VERY salty, but my hubby didn't think so. This will be a weekly meal in our house, but I will use half the dry soup mix.
I baked for 45 mins @ 350 covered.

this was very good, however, the meat should be browned before putting everything together....my meat wasn't cooked fully after being in the oven for an hour....the sauce was very good and I do not think it was too salty at all....I did add 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and one packet of lipton onion soup with about 1/2 cup more water...maybe covering it was the trick...I will make this again, but next time in the slow cooker so the meat is tender and done!

I usually don't make too many changes to recipes and than rate them b/c than you are rating your recipe not the posted one, with that said I made the following changes I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 packet of onion soup mix and lowered the temp to 350 covered with foil and baked for 45 min. This was super quick and easy, like another reviewer said do not use stew beef it would be too tough as the cooking time is not long enough. This taste quite a bit like awesome crock-pot roast also on this site.  Thanks for the recipe

This was good I changed the recipe a littlel I cooked the steak in a grill then cut into strips. Sauted onions and added mushroom soup then poured mix over beef and heated in oven. Then poured over noodles.

Turned out great and it was easy.  I used 1/2 pkg. of the soup mix to 1 can of mushroom soup.  I also added a little sour cream before I served.  I made mine in the crockpot and the meat was really tender. Thanks for the recipe!

Overall this is good.  Needs a few adjustments.  I used low sodium mushroom soup and about 1 1/2 tbsp of dry onion soup and it was still very salty.  Next time I will probably cut back even more on onion soup.  Didn't seem to make enough sauce, next time I'll add a bit more water or try milk like others suggested.  Added lots of black pepper to it-- it was good and I'd make it again.

This was yummy, I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also followed someones advice and covered it with foil.  Next time I think I'll just cook it without the foil because the sauce was really runny.  I think I'd like it better a little thicker.  A lot of people thought it was too spicy with the beef onion soup but I used the amount the recipe called for and I thought it was fine.  Maybe I just like it salty but who knows, my husband didn't complain about it so I'll just let it be :)

This was so quick, easy and tasty.  I added an extra half cup of water and covered with foil.  I also added 2 pounds of sirloin instead of just one.  My 2 year old loved it too!

I make this a couple of times a month, sometimes in the slowcooker, sometimes in the oven.  I like to add fresh mushrooms and onion, sauteed with a small amount of olive oil. I remove from pan and then brown the meat briefly before adding to the canned soup, onion soup mix, and beef broth in the cooking dish.  This can work with lots of tweaks, so have some fun with it!  Add sour cream in the last 10 minutes for a stroganoff-like spin, add some red wine early on for a deeper, richer flavor!  I do not recommend using water in the mix, as beef broth adds more flavor.  Cook as usual, and if it's too watery, cook the last 10-15 minutes with the lid off to evaporate some of the water.  Good luck!

I have never been moved to rate/review until now... this is the only poor recipe I have tried so far on this site! It was so, so salty My 2-year-old spit it out and my 5-year-old wouldn't eat it at all. I don't blame her! Sorry Juie--I had high hopes...

This smelled and looked good while cooking but it's missing flavor!  I even added salt and garlic powder hoping to zip it up a bit.  No luck.  Sirloin was tender but again, no flavor!  I won't be making this again.

Family favorite!  I like to use baby bella mushrooms instead of the canned and toss in some onions as well.  This recipe works best with the sirloin tips, but I've used all kinds of cuts (usually whatever is in the freezer) and haven't had any problems.

The gravy dried up too much while cooking so i would definitely either cook it less or add double the recipe.  Or just use a lot less noodles than what the recipe suggest.  Otherwise it was great.

We really like this recipe when we add a second can of soup (cream of celery because we're not fond of mushrooms) and cook it all day in the slow cooker.

Very tasty flavor, but too dry. Was I supposed to cover it? There was hardly any liquid and it appeared almost burnt, but the meat was still tender. I was dying for a drippier version of the tasty sauce to sop up with my roll. Also, I had a ridiculous amount of noodles left. I used 3 oz of fresh diced mushrooms. Next time I will double the mushroom soup, the beef onion soup mix and the water and halve the noodles. Very easy and fabulous flavor.****update...I've been making this for months now and I keep all the proportions the same, but I use reduced sodium cream of mushroom and I always cover the pan with foil which seems to keep the sauce from evaporating and keeps the salt concentration within reason. I also add fresh mushroom slices and use a LOT less noodles since there are only 2 of us. I think my oven just tends to run a little hotter than it should because I've had trouble with cooking times quite a few times, so maybe thats another reason covering it helps me. Delicious!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy and delicious. My husband loved it and has requested that I make it again and even make it for his parents. He is a very picky eater so that comment speaks for it self.  The only thing I changed was adding extra liquid it cooked a little dry for my taste.

Although this was a quick and easy recipe, I didn't like the sirloin tips.  I kept wishing they were swedish meatballs.  The gravy, however, was excellent!  If you left out the meat, the gravy would be delicious over mashed potatoes.

Really easy & pretty good.  Following the other suggestions, I doubled the soup.  Unfortunately, I also doubled the beef onion dry soup mix & it made the flavor very strong & a bit salty.  Next time I would double the can of soup, but not the dry mix.

This was really good and great for a cold winters night.  I revised it a bit since my boyfriend hates mushrooms.  I used cream of brocolli and brocolli pieces, adding them about 15 minutes before the meat was done.  It was great, but a bit salty from all of the soup and soup mix.

This was really good!  I used a (4.5 oz) jar of whole mushrooms instead of the standard "pieces and stems" can of mushrooms, but that was really the only change I made to this great recipe.  I also served it over rice instead of noodles because my husband really likes white rice.  The meat was pretty tender but I think I'll sprinkle some meat tenderizer on it next time before mixing it into the sauce-  the more tender, the better!  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe.

Very good.  I stired the soups and water together before adding mushrooms and meat. I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them in butter, garlic powder and onion powder instead of using canned mushrooms.  I then browned the meat in the same pan before adding it.  I cut 5 minutes off the recipe because the liquid was almost gone and I was afraid it would burn. I would add more liquid next time so we have more gravy... but I would definitely fix it again.  Thanks!

This recipe had a very good flavor.  I fixed in the crock pot, which made the beef tips very tender.  It was also nice to have dinner fixed and not have to mess with it after a long day!  Very easy recipe!

I don't care for beef so didn't even taste it, but my family devoured every bit of it.  I made it just like the recipe says except I browned the sirloin tips then threw everything in the crockpot.  Instead of cooking the noodles separately, about 45 minutes before serving I put in a 12 oz bag of frozen precooked Reames egg noodles.

I think next time I will try making it with chicken and substitute onion soup for the beefy onion, and still add the precooked Reames noodles.  I will also double the recipe next time!  DH, DS and DD at the whole thing by themselves.  It wouldn't have been enough if other DD and myself had been eating.

My family loved this, even my 22 month old. I used beef for braising. And it really worked out well. My one suggestion, marinate the meat, for an hour or so then bake... The more tender the better.

This was very good!! I used Beefy Mushroom soup instead of onion, it turned out very tender and flavorful.  I like a bit more sauce with my noodles, so I think I will add an extra can of soup next time.

I was searching for a recipe that would remind me of my mom's cooking when I was younger. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy and delicious. I think next time I will add some garlic to the sauce. I used chop suey meat and it was still tender and great tasting. ENJOY! :)

EXCELLENT!!! This was so fast and easy to prepare! I used a 9x9 glass dish and it was deep enough for the recipe. Next time I'll probably sprinkle some meat tenderizer on the sirloin but it was tender with the sauce (we have a 1 yr old so I like her meat serving to be super tender!). The gravy this made is so yummy and rich...great for egg noodles!!! Try this one it's a keeper! Thanks for posting it Julie!!!!!

Wonderful!  I enjoyed this classic taste of beef tips and noodles.  Next time I will try fresh mushrooms (although canned wasn't bad at all!).  The sauce was creamy and had just the right amount of flavor.  The beef came out tender and juicy.  I will certainly make this again!

My 6 year old Daughter was begging me to make Beef Tips over noodles so I came to Allrecipes & found this one it was delicious.  My husband raved & my Daughter said it was her favorite!  So needless to say I will be making this one again.  I am going to try it in the crock pot next time too & double the recipe.  I think I made too many noodles so I need more of the gravy.  Thank you for sharing a delicious easy recipe!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I used 1.5 lbs of meat and doubled the soup recipe.  Lowered the temp after an hour and the gravy was thick and very tasty!!!  This will definitely be a staple dish at our house!

This is a wonderful, quick, easy recipe with very good flavor.  I'm going to try this in a slow cooker next, because we like our meat falling-apart tender, but this is a quick meal that my husband thought took me hours! ;)

This dish was nice and easy but the taste wasn't outstanding as I had hoped from the reviews.  I used French onion soup mix with beef stew mix since I've never heard of beef onion soup mix and didn't see it in the store.  Next time I'll try it in the crockpot like another reviewer did and look harder for the "beef onion soup mix" in the store.
One thing, was the casserole dish supposed to be covered while baking?  I left it uncovered and stirred halfway through cooking.

This is a great recipe.  I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I usually just dump everything in the slow cooker and let it go all day--makes the meat nice and tender.

This is really easy and really good.  I've used regular onion soup mix, fresh mushrooms and served it over rice and it's turned out just as well.  I've also fixed pork chops this way and they were great.  This is a real family favorite.

This was very easy and tasted great.  I cooked in stonewear which worked out very well.  It takes an hour to bake, but the prep time was next to nothing.  I will use this recipe again.

These are absolutely yummy exactly as the recipe is written. I did not have to wait until they were cool to add the powdered sugar. When I make these again I will try different sweeteners to the powdered sugar only because it’s so messy. Love this recipe!?

My meat was already cooked so I just added the ingredients to a sauce pan with the already cooked beef. I added 1/2 cup of milk, additional cup of water, & brown gravy when I added my noodles and cooked it all on medium until noodles were done. Delicious!!

Excellent, but indeed salty. I will do as other reviewers suggested and find soup with reduced salt. I did also add 1/2 gravy packet to the sauce to help thicken it up and it worked perfectly. Can't wait to try it in the crock pot so it'll cook while I'm at work. A winning dish and super easy!

Definitely will make again! I used fresh mushrooms, sauteed in butter, in place of the canned, and browned the beef in the saute pan. Otherwise followed recipe as written! I did not find it too salty at all; not sure why other reviewers felt it was. Very flavorful and plenty of gravy, I served it over mashed potatoes cuz hubs doesn't like noodles, but I would have also loved it with noodles.

Weather you choose to open a can of mushroom soup and dump it in or get a little crazy,  pulling a "3 dayer" hunting and gathering wild organic mushrooms from your perfectly myciliam based backyard to create a slow simmered crockpot based sauce after you have tenderly seared your top sirloin to perfection.  
From  where I stand its all great and creative and I love anything with noodles and throw in some top sirloin with homemade sauce, sounds like an amazing cant get enough meal!...just saying:)

Cooked in slow cooker four hours.  Added little pepper and used 1 cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup. Substituted milk for water. Wasn’t too salty and plenty of gravy.

I made it just like the recipe except I added mushrooms. Next time I make, I will not add the red wine. I didn't like the flavor it gave it. Not sure if I'll make it again. If I do I'll leave the red wine out. Virginia

This was so easy to make. I only had onion soup mix. Also added another can of soup and a little extra water.  After an hour it was done but still a little chewy.  Served it with rice instead of noodles. Very good. Will definitely make this again as it was so easy. Putting it in a slow cooker would probably make the meat more tender.

Delicious.  I added pasta water to the baked meat as there was not a lot of gravy .  This made it creamier and easy to dish.

This was pretty tasty!  It's very quick to make. Next time I think I would try putting a small container or half a container of  sour cream in it.  I know that it would change the flavor, but it would help with the salty taste that I believe came from the beef with onion soup mix..

I slow cooked this instead of baked it in the oven, and the beef tips turned out wonderfully tender.  I also loved the sauce, it's rich and earthy, perfect for the rainy weather.  However, I think this would go well more with mashed potatoes rather than egg noodles. The sauce won't stick to the pasta, so the overall dish was just wet.  I will pair this next time with potatoes or rice!

this recipe AS-IS is easy, wonderfully tasty, and great comfort food. I have made it in the crock pot, one pot, and stove top.  if you want a slight change that is company-worthy,  special night delight.. change the cream of mushroom soup to golden mushroom* ( campbells) . your friends and family will be raving about it a long time!!!

The only thing I do that the recipe doesn't specifically call for is I put foil over the top of the casserole dish to keep the tips moist and preserve the sauce.

Yummy! My husband and kids loved it! Definitely a keeper. So easy and delicious.  I added chicken broth as others had mentioned and used 3 cans of cream of mushroom. Once the noodles were almost done I added them to the crockpot to finish.  I am not sure if I’ll do that next time, it tasted great but soaked up a lot of the sauce. If I do, I’ll increase the amount of broth and decrease the amount of noddles.

I browned the beef tips after flouring with salt and pepper. Then cooked the mushrooms with some red wine and deglazed the pan. Then combined the beef , mushrooms, soup and deglazed cooking juice. Then put into the oven. It was excellent.

Im giving this 4 stars because of the changes I made. I used low sodium beef broth (Kitchen Basics) and 2 cans of Healthy Request Campbell's Cream Mushroom soup and 2 cans of milk.  Also one pkg. of Lipton's Beefy Onion Mix. I floured beef chunks and browned them in my Dutch oven. Deglazed the pan with beef broth  scrapping up the yummy bits. I then added the soups, some black pepper and put it in the oven on covered at 325 for 4 hours. While this was cooking I added some brown gravy, butter,  and frozen peas. I didn't measure sorry. Omg it took it to a new level of yummy. I also added cooked egg noodles at the end. This is one of our favorite recipes to make!

Slight variation: 1 can each of French Onion and Cream of Mushroom. No water needed. Dump all ingredients in the crock pot and go. For more of a gravy, mix cornstarch and some of the liquid and continue cooking for an additional 30 minutes. I nixed the egg noodles and served over rice.

Simple and quick to prep.  Taste was pretty good but like a lot of other comments I used red wine instead of water.  Also doubled up on the sauce ingredients and it worked out well.

Love this recipe. I made it several times. With a 2lb chop serloin roast, I always add one can each of cream or chicken and mushroom. Also 1/4 cup each of warstashire and soy sauce . 1/2 an onion chopped. Salt and pepper the meat instead. 1/2 cup beef stock instead of the water. All in crockpot.

This was a huge hit for our family.  We have a few picky eaters and they all had huge helpings!
A few things I did different were:
Seared the meat first w/ a sprinkling of salt and pepper. 
Added 1/2 of the water and a can of beef broth. 
Cut up fresh baby Bella mushrooms instead of using canned. 
Cooked the dish in the oven,  in a cast iron skillet instead of a 9×13 pan. 
Definitely will be making it again!

Wow, easy and delicious. What more can you ask for? I used a sirloin steak, cut up. So tender! Don't add any additional salt, it was on the verge of being too salty. But so easy and really really good.

I would make this again. The first time I made this, I  used onion soup mix, milk instead of water and fresh mushrooms , browned the meat first then cooked in the oven. It was good but salty. 

Second time I made this I used onion soup mix, milk and fresh mushrooms again. Then I browned the meat in the pan and added all ingredients then let it simmer (instead of placing in the oven) I think that was easier, 2 pot dinner. This is great over noodles or mashed potatoes!

Love this recipe. I tend to double it so that there is more to serve and to have left overs. The beef onion soup is what gives it such flavor!

This was delicious! I used bison steak tips instead of beef and added 2 tablespoons of Worcester sauce and 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke. Put it in the crock pot for 3 hours on high and it was as tender and flavorful as could be. We ate the leftovers on day 3 and it was even better!! Great recipe, thanks for sharing ??

One hour in the oven was way to long. There was no sauce left and the meat was overdone. The taste was great though. We will be making it again dropping the cook time way down.

I made this in am electronic skillet but didn't use canned soup or packed onion soup mix too much msg that my stomach can't handle. I used fresh mushrooms sliced and sautéed them in a stick  of butter added a cup of flour mixed until smooth then 4-5lbs of sliced sirloin steak marinaded for 20 min in a crisp white wine. Added two cups of beef broth to roux stirring briskly then 1 can evaporated milk followed buy steak including the wine I had fresh dill dip I made with sour cream dill paprika and a spice mix mother nature's seasonings by Morton I added 1/3 cup of dill dip to pan. Stirred til steak was well mixed then turned heat to medium low and let simmer for 30 min stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Delicious the whole family loved it including my daughter 13 who is a very picky eater.

Amazing basics to this recipe but I brown the beef with gravy master. Then instead of water use wine like a dry Cabernet. And add at least 1/4 cup sour cream. Yummy

Great meal for a weeknight after working all day.  Super easy and very tasty. 
2 things I did differently: 1 i used milk instead of water (just a habit when cooking with soup, after I made it I realized it called for water) and 2 I cooked it on the stove top instead of in the oven (No real reason, the skillet was closer than the casseole dish).  Brown the meat in a touch of evoo then add the other ingredients, cover and simmer for an hour or so. The meat is so very tender.

This was a simple and delicious meal to make.   Loved the taste and my house smelled so good.  Next time I make, I will change 2 things.  I will do fresh mushrooms and more than the suggested amount (we love shrooms) and I will change up the meat.  I did the sirloin but it was just too thin and came out a little overcooked.  So I am going to opt for the beef stew meat as many had suggested.  Other than that, it was so good.  Had a glass of red wine and some flaky biscuits on the side.  YUM

I took some other reviews into consideration and did alter the recipe to what I had on hand. Plus I put my own personal touches on it. However, this is a fantastic base for someone to make their own version. Thank you for the idea and the suggestions from other cooks. This turned out great!

Reminds me of 50's and 60's style cooking.  Recipe  relies too heavily on processed ingredients; too much sodium, too many preservatives.  Still tasty.

I made changes based on about 90 reviews I read.
I will make again, it's cooler today so the oven isn't bothersome with the rear kitchen door propped open.
I used the family size can of Cream of mushroom soup and then filled half the can with half and half the rest water. Also browned the meat prior with salt pepper opinion and garlic powders, scrapped all the bits and juices into the dish along with parsley. Served over egg noodles along with sweet corn and croissants'.
I agree its a cheap delicious meal.
My crew loved it. So many many ways to play with this. Excellent starter recipe.

I used chuck roast instead of sirloin tips because that's what was on sale. It was so delicious. I highly recommend doubling the recipe. It needed more sauce for sure.

I made this last night, it was very good. I did what hrw did in their review for the gravy. I used one (10 1/2 oz.) can of cream of mushroom soup, one soup can of milk, one package of beef onion dry soup mix and one package of brown gravy mix. We didn't think it was too salty at all. Thanks to the reviews, we can make changes before the better. I gave this recipe only four stars because I didn't make it exactly as directed. But it was delish!

I've been using this recipe for years as written, but today, I followed Ren1216's advice and added a soup can of milk and a packet of brown gravy mix and also seasoned the meat with onion powder, garlic powder and pepper.  In addition, I used fresh mushrooms - just sliced and threw them in with the meat.  Whoa, what a difference!  Will definitely make it this way from now on!

I added half a can of water to the soup mixture and 4 oz of sliced baby bellas. It wasn't particularly salty, although I think I would maybe use milk instead of water next time to increase the creaminess.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and sautéed mushrooms and scallions in butter and garlic. I cooked this covered and it came out with a good amount of sauce. I don't think it serves 8,however.  Serves more 4-6. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe! Will make it again. No changes to the recipe. But as always, I add spices because I am a chef. Pay attention to the bay leaf and thyme. Smelled awesome! You can pick your own starch - rice, pasta or potatoes. I browned my meat  and garlic in a tablespoon of oi and strained. Lightly sauteed my onions in butter with the same pan and returned the meat, garlic and 3 cups of water mixed with the onion soup mix. A whole packet of onion soup mix can be salty! Simmer with lid on til your meat is tender. Then add the cream of mushroom soup, stir.  It's hot enough to eat! No baking! Thank you for this recipe!!! So easy.

I am eating this now.  I didn't find it too salty like others.  I used the Lipton brand "beefy onion"  soup mix.  The noodle-to-beef ratio is perfect.  Very flavorful!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out dry and overdone. We're going to add more cream of mushroom and slice up the meat before our guests get here and hope for the best!! :(

I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added a chopped onion. I used milk instead of water for a creamier sauce. My oven runs a little over temperature, but I only ended up cooking for 30 mins. Delicious! Will definitely make again

Filling, quick and easy. Not something I would serve to a guest. We tend to not use a lot of canned ingredients so the soup mix and cream of mushroom seemed to dominate the flavor. I did add fresh mushrooms and replaced the water with red wine and broth. I may try it again but will have to find lower sodium soup and add spices to lessen the canned taste.

I'm a college kid that has zero money to spend on food, and zero time to make it. But this cost maybe fifteen bucks total, took maybe thirty minutes to make, tasted delicious, and gave me enough leftovers for a week. Perfect.

Super delicious and simple recipe! My hubby requested it and loves it. We make it all the time. I like a thinner beef/mushroom mix so I add about 1/4 of water extra to it. Thanks for the great recipe!!

The 1st Time trying this recipe, we went by instructions. Thoroughly Enjoyed. When making last night, the only EXTRA steps were: dredging the meat in seasoning & flour, then browning. After dumping meat in crock pot, we sauteed mushrooms, onion and garlic then deglazed the pan with Marsala. We served over buttered egg noodles and, after plating, each portion got a dollop of sour cream. This did add a richness to the dish. Definitely a Keeper Recipe.

The only thing I changed was I used milk instead of water and a can of beef gravy only because was afraid not enough sauce. I cooked in crockpot for about 8 hours, cooked noodles and stirred into meat and sauce before serving. I did not put full 16 ounces of noodles in. Served with sour cream. Definitely a keeper. Husband loved it too.

I just loved this easy recipe.  I also seasoned the beef prior with onion, garlic powder and pepper. I switched out the dry soup mix and used Beefy Onion soup to make more gravy.  My family prefers to eat it over mashed potatoes instead of egg noodles.

Thank you, Julie for this recipe! I made it. It was so easy and very good. I had the beef in the oven in fifteen minutes. I doubled the recipe, baked it for 90 minutes.  I find it easier to mix all the ingredients in a large bowl then scoop it into the 13x9 dish. I bought the wrong Lipton Soup mix onion only so, I added 2 tsp Knorr Beef stock granules to the chuck steak.  I like meat more spicey so I added 1 tsp minced garlic,  1 tsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp dried parsley and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper.  My family thought  the beef tips were wonderful and they want this dinner again soon!

I browned the meat in olive oil after seasoning it with pepper, garlic salt and onion salt. I also used 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup water for the liquid. It was delicious and my husband loved it.

I used onion soup mix and beef bouillon.  Instead of water I used beef broth.  The kids and I loved it!  Thanks!

Wonderful! I used beef broth instead of water and used fresh rather than canned mushrooms. I also added some sour cream and cream cheese to make it like beef stroganoff, but it would be delicious without it.

This was really good and easy.  The only thing was I needed to add more water to have a little sauce.

I tried and improved this recipe.  Apologies to the poster, however this recipe got a whole lot better with longer cook times, worchestershire sauce, fresh mushrooms, garlic and onions.

Would do this one again, small stuff i did differently was using fresh mushrooms like some comments 2 cans of Golden Cream of Mushroom soup and using a cup of milk. I would in courage seasoning the beef to taste before putting all in the pot. But otherwise was preatty good an quick and easy to do.

This was just OK.  The sauce cooked down to nothing and the beef ended up tough and crispy.  The recipe needs a lot of tweaking.

I tripled this recipe.  I feed 3 12 year olds, a 7 year old and my husband and I.  It was sooo good and very, very easy, as it was able to cook while we were busy doing weekend family stuff.  All the kids loved it and a couple came back for full plates of second helpings.  Definitely adding to the rotation.

It was fine. Needed some more salt for my taste. Next time I will try it in the crock pot. The sirloin I used was a little tough if not cut up into very small pieces. Overall it was a hearty meal.

As someone not accustomed these types of dishes I found it to be fantastic! There was not enough of the sauce though. The picture is deceiving. I'll double it next time. I found a review to by user hrw to have some good adjustments as well.

I've made this a few times.  Love it! It's so simply to throw together and throw in the oven.  I never like Beef and Noodles before but I love this recipe.  The only change I made was I used Cream of Celery soup only because I don't like Cream of Mushroom and didn't add the mushrooms for the same reason. Other that that I made it like listed and it's wonderful.

I made this and my family raved about how good it is , I did make some changes. My family are not huge mushroom fans. So I just used the cream of mushrooms but did not use the actual mushrooms listed. I added black pepper,  and onion powder.

I've been making this recipe for over a year now, and my whole family loves it.  The recipe is good as is, but since we are not big fans of mushrooms I typically omit the canned mushrooms.  I also sometimes use golden mushroom soup in lieu of the creamy mushroom soup.  Always delicious and soooo easy.  Beware - 1 pound of meat is nowhere near enough for our family of 4.  I usually make around 3 pounds (pre-trimmed weight) and double the other ingredients.  We usually have some leftover for school lunches the next day. Enjoy!

This was great!  I added a little garlic powder, left out the mushrooms, and instead of the water used about 1/2 a cup of red wine and a little bit of milk and beef broth.

Would not put in onion soup too salty just use spices and fresh mushrooms.  Added 1  can water and 1/2 can milk and 2 pkg of brown gravy.

Very good basic recipe. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom healthy request soup with 1 pack of beefy onion soup mix plus 1 can of milk. I browned the sirloin cubes in olive oil and fresh minced garlic (about 1 TB) before adding it to mixture. Also added 1 tsp. of Worchestire sauce and 1 tsp. of kitchen bouquet browning sauce and seasoned with ground pepper and onion powder. Added fresh onion chunks (so my daughter could find them and remove them as she doesn't like them) and sliced button mushrooms. Cooked in slow cooker for 5-6 hours on low.  Meat was very tender and sauce was flavorful. Served over buttered noodles with green beans as a side. One of my daughter's favorite dinners!

This was very easy to make, and turned out well. We did end up with quite a bit of extra noodles, but that was probably us going heavy on the beef tips and sauce.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  It tasted awesome when I finished.  I followed this recipe pretty much to the nose and I would do it again!  My oven cooks hot so it only took about half the time to cook - and even then, the steak was a little dry but I can easily fix that with 5-10  minutes off my cook time.   I am definitely going to recommend to friends and family.

I just made this recipe and turned out great!!! It was easy and not too bad on time. Next time I will probably double the ingredients for the meat n gravy because my kids also loved it. Would like it if sauce stuck to noodles better but still very tasty.

This was a decent recipe. I used low sodium canned mushroom soup to off set the dry soup mix and added a half of an onion sautéed in unsalted butter. Salt is not needed to cook noodles either.

I LOVED this dish. I didn't have any cream of mushroom so I had to make my own from a white sauce & beef stock, added some chopped up mushrooms, and it turned out fine to use. My husband loved it as well, he took the rest to work today, will have to make this again soon. VERY DELICIOUS.

This recipe is so easy and so good!  I have been making it for years and everyone in my house loves it.  Even my picky 4 year old daughter who doesn't like too much of anything I cook for dinner unless it's hamburger helper.  I add cream of chicken soup to this recipe and it is perfect.  You can also add cream of celery instead of the cream of chicken.  To add a little extra flavor instead of water add red cooking wine.

This recipe was made by my Mom back in the 30's right through the late 80's when she passed away.   She made the recipe in a pot on top of the stove and it was called, "POTTED BEEF".   All the ingredients are the same with the exception, Mom used sliced onion's also.   The gravy was thickened with a rue.  I love this meal, easy, tasty and it use to be a cheap meal back in the old days.  Thanks for the revised method of cooking potted beef.   It makes me want to cook this again after the absence for so many years.  Mrs. G

This is a great recipe and works well in the crock pot too.  I just put all of the ingredients in the crock pot and let it cook on low all day.  Dinner is on the table quickly when I get home.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have mushrooms and 
I used a can of French onion soup instead of water.  I'll do different next time as my end result was too salty.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  This is a good recipe.

This recipe is a good choice for a weeknight meal. It is very filling and especially great on a cold day, although it is really good anytime! It is very easy to make and so tasty. I would highly recommend it. The only changes I made was using a better cut of meat. I prefer to use beef tenderloin but a New York strip steak works well also. The sirloin is pretty good but sometimes can be a bit tough which is why I tried a different cut. Also I found that canned or jarred mushrooms were a bit hard and replacing them with fresh ones worked out much better. Overall this dish is a keeper.

This wasn't too bad. We followed the directions pretty closely but we put it in the slow cooker. Next time I'd add some sour cream or milk or less water or something. My husband enjoyed it a lot, and I thought it was just ok... 4 stars since husband really liked it and it was very easy to make.

First off, I used cubed venison tenderloin, and used more like a pound and a half. I used the slow cooker version and it was awesome. Also you can be generous with your cream of mushrooms I used two and also used milk and water. The other suggestion I have is use at least 3 or 4 cans of mushrooms. If you feel the sauce isn't thick enough stir in a tablespoon or two of flour to thicken. We will be making this again and again.

Too salty and dry.  Almost burned in an hour.  It needs more gravy and less time baking?  My husband opened a jar of beef gravy to add to his serving.

Used mushroom onion soup mix instead beef onion soup mix. Very easy to make and have left overs. Can make it with 12 oz bag of egg noodles instead of the 16 oz.

I was very eager to try this recipe as beef and noodles can be such a delicious comfort meal selection.  I followed the recipe, using top sirloin (the recipe didn't state a preference of cut.  I bought the meat from a butcher counter that is known for their good meat).  The beef mixture was bland, actually, almost flavorless, and I was disappointed.  My husband was also disappointed and asked me what kind of meat was in the dish, not even realizing it was top grade beef.  He won't eat the leftovers.  Thinking as I read the recipe, this would be a great dish to serve company as it is so easy to prepare.  I will say, it did taste better the second day.  I do like the method used in preparing the meat and gravy portion.  It is easy and convenient.   I'll have to search for a different recipe to achieve a better, more hearty flavor.  I don't like to be critical of someone's recipe, especially that I see many of the posters really liked the dish, but, I won't use this recipe again

Definitely a keeper! I made some small modifications (I used 2 lbs. sirloin tip steak, 1 c. red wine, 2 pkts. beef n onion mix, 1 can crm of mushroom, 6 oz. jar of mushrooms, couple pinches of black pepper, and a lil cornstarch to thicken)to "beef up" the recipe and feed my big family. I also cooked it for only 40 minutes instead of an hour. I loved this because I am a very picky steak eater but I was really impressed at how lean and tender the steak was. Definitely a hit in my house!

My family really liked this.  I used fresh mushrooms and garlic sauteed in butter.  I cut the amount of noodles and meat in half but kept the rest the same.  Unfortunately, there was not enough sauce and barely enough meat for 4 people.  Considering I doubled the sauce and still didn't have enough, I would suggest using 2.5 times the amount of both soups and water.

I make this recipe and have for a long time except I use 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1 can onion soup. I throw it all together and put in Dutch oven. Put in oven at 350 and bake for 2 hours or so. It makes great gravy for over the noodles.

I have made this recipe several times. It is an easy meal that is great for busy weeknights. I use fresh mushrooms and instead of water, I add a full can of milk from the empty cream of mushroom container. The only negative, like some other reviewers have mentioned, is that the meal is a bit salty.

This turned out good. I did not use a can of mushrooms in mine b/c my family doesnt like mushrooms. All 3 of my boys enjoyed the meal and my 5 year old had seconds which says alot.

Loved this except that it was very salty from the beefy onion soup.  I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup (2 cans), more beef and added fresh tarragon and 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms with 2 cups of water.  Next time I think I will use sauteed fresh onions with no sodium beef boullion in lieu of the onion soup and see how that works.  When you cook with practically no salt, the saltiness of the onion soup was hard to deal with.  My husband said it was better than what his mother used to make :)

This was delicious! I accidentally bought a family size cream of chicken soup, so used 2/3 of it anyway just not to waste it, and it was all good. It was a little salty, but I just used more noodles and scooped  less sauce on them. My husband liked this, and he is a picky eater. I left out the mushrooms because he doesn't like them, but I'd rather have had them in!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was the cream of mushroom soup. I used cream of asparagus since that's what I had on hand. I will say this though, the recipe only makes enough meat for four people, which is what we had, and no seconds. So just keep that in mind as you make this recipe.

Fantastic recipe! I used 2# of sirloin tips, which I dredged in flour, salt, pepper, and garlic salt and then browned in oil. Added meat to 2 cans of soup, 2 soup cans of milk, one envelope of onion soup mix, and then I added some beef broth to thin it near the end of cooking time.

My whole family loved this recipe even our baby who converted to all table food! My only suggestion is to add more cream of mushroom soup and milk or half and half to make more sauce. Otherwise you end up too many noodles compared to sauce. Great for leftovers as well! My husband asked me to put this into frequent rotation at our house.

Good recipe. Our tips were a little dry and they really had no flavor. The noodles were very good. Will definitely use this recipe again. Will probably marinate the tips in the future.

Absolutely delicious!! I used stew beef and fresh mushrooms (sauteed in butter and garlic while browning the meat). Glad I only used 1/2 the noodles because I would not have had enough sauce if I'd used the whole package. I cooked it in the oven for an hour and the meat was super tender! It's a keeper!

Tried this out with pretty good success.  I made a double batch of the sauce using the same ratio as the ingredients specified.  I should have only used one package of the beef & onion soup mix, it was very salty.  Next time I'd also put it in the crock pot to tenderize the meat.  Over all most everyone liked it.  I would make it again, just with modifications.

Delicious!  I did use 3 cans of Healthy Choice Cream of Mushroom (use because it has less sodium as others said it was too salty) and also added 1 cup of milk.  This one will be added to our dinner rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding!! I followed the advice of another member and replaced the water with a mushroom soup-canful of whole milk, added one package of brown gravy mix, used fresh sliced mushrooms, and browned the stew beef in olive oil for just a minute before baking at 375 for 45 minutes. I could not be any more impressed with this recipe. Everyone loved it! Thank you! (we had ours with Grands buttermilk buscuits.. mmm!)

This is actually really good for such a simple recipe.  My ways that I deviated were that I used a 12 inch dutch oven instead of a 9x13 dish, and coated the beef chunks in flour and browned them in a little bit of bacon grease before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I put the lid on the dutch oven then stuck it inside the regular (braising)  oven at 400 for an hour like the instructions say.  They came out perfectly tender and juicy!  Then to go with it I had an oatmeal stout beer, Slow Elk oatmeal stout from Big Sky Brewing to be specific, and it paired amazingly with the food.  I think next time I make this recipe I might actually use a stout beer instead of water for the liquid in the recipe.

I've used these ingredients with a chuck roast for years and it's always delicious. The only thing that I don't use are the canned mushrooms- can't stand them! I put in fresh ones the last part of the cooking and it works out very well. Oh, and I'll add some red wine, too, when I have it around. Great, easy recipe!

A really good dish, even my picky 11-yr old loved.  Used Golden Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Mushroom cause that is what I had on hand.  I found it a little salty at first so I thinned it out with a little beef broth which helped a little.

I tried this recipes about two months ago. My boyfriend and I loved it so much we were eating it once a week. I make my own noodles and some home made mashed potatos with it. The only thing is I have to make double of what it says to feed 4 people, except the noodles I make less than sugested. It might be because the only meat I can find is beef stew meat and that meat shrinks quite a bit when cooked. This is one of our favorite meals now! I dont think I will ever stop making this meal.

Meh.  The sauce was a bit to watery and it was just okay.  I probably won't make this again.

All it needed was some Kitchen Bouquet for that rich brown color.  YUM! Crockpot method is very easy. I sliced fresh mshrooms "on top" the last 1 hr to steam them.  Awesome. Easy to convert recipe for a large crowd..

I tried this recipe against my better judgement. I am an experienced cook and was very disappointed with not only the taste but with the consistency of the sauce.

Delicious Idea - I made a fresh version with the help of the slow cooker. Left the beef in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours salted and peppered and slightly covered in red wine. Then on the stove I made a simple cream sauce. I melted butter and sauteed some fresh mushrooms, whisked in flour and added half and half to complete the sauce. Delicious, quick and MSG free.

This is a new family fave. The only thing I did was I also made mash potatoes with the pasta and everyone perferred the potatoes over the pasta. The next time I make this meal it will be with only mash potatoes.  Otherwise awesome dinner!!!!

This is so. Good. I have a suspicion that this would taste great with just about any cut of meat. The only thing I didn't think about was making more sauce! The recipe definitely does not make enough on its own. I was left with nearly half the egg noodles and nothing to put on them!

My hubby raved about this! I had some left over beef sirloin from a large roast that had to be used so I made this a couple of days ago. I used regular onion soup mix and replaced the water with beef consumme, then added 2 dollops of sour cream when I took it out of the oven. Served over mashed potatoes. Not too salty at all. I am making this again today to use up the rest of the sirloin and will freeze it for another day. Thanks for a great recipe! I'll be making this again for sure!

I think this is quite possibly my FAVORITE recipe on this entire site!  Progresso has a new soup starter with portabella mushrooms in it that goes great with this, and I use fresh ports in it instead of canned.  SO GOOD!!!!!!!

Well, my beef stroganoff used to be the most requested recipe but this dish beat it in a heartbeat - new menu staple!!  I will use ground beef or throw in slow cooker in the future, meat was still a little tough.

I changed a little.. I added 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and a 2 cups of milk. Nobody liked it with the noodles and on top of mashed potatoes but me. Needed a little bit more salt but I did use Low Sodium Cream of Mushroom.  I also mixed all ingredients except noodles and put in crock pot for about 4 1/2 hours.  I didn't add the can of mushrooms b/c My daughter definitely would not have wanted to eat that. I'm not sure if my family would let me make again even though they do like beef stroganoff and it's very similar.

Great recipe. However it was a bit salty. Next time I think I will use low sodium soup, to cut some of the salt. Still it had great flavor and the meat was tender. Will definitely make again.

Tasty the way it is listed; really tasty with a few cloves of garlic, 1/4 c. dry red wine, and real mushrooms instead of a can. I love how easy this recipe is!

This was delicious!  As suggested in other reviews, I used a cup of milk and even added a jar of beef gravy to make sure that I had enough gravy for the noodles.  After cooking the noodles, I added a couple of pats of butter and sprinkle of dried parsley.  After dinner, I mixed the leftover beef tips & gravy with the noodles for storage.  It was even better the next day!  I'll make this again and again!  Great comfort food!

4 stars for this basic recipe that can be made as is for a quick, easy meal.... But next time I'll definitely add seasonings, more water or beef broth to make enough sauce for the (8 oz, not 16 oz) of noodles and saute onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms to add at the end of cook time instead of canned mushrooms.

very good, but changed a few things after reading a lot of reviews: decreased temp to 300 deg, cooked for 2 hrs used 1 can beef broth in place of water used 1 can golden mushroom soup added on package beef gravy(dry mix) mixed all ingredients, poured over meat, mixed well, and covered. meat was very tender this way, and we served it over rice and we had plenty of gravy this way...My daughter loved it!

This was very good and so easy to make!   My husband liked it too which is always a bonus.  The store didn't have sirloin tips, so I bought a New York strip and sliced that instead.   It came out wonderful.

The sauce had wonderful flavor, used fresh mushrooms one small packages, could have used 2, used milk rather than water.  My only complaint is that the meat was very very tough, could have been the stew beef i used but I picked it all out.  Will make again but would cook the meat seperately.

I sauteed onions and fresh mushrooms first then added to the recipe.  It came out delicious and was so easy.  I will definitely make it again.

The taste and ease of this recipe was a 5 star for me.  I would have liked to have had more gravy and certainly didn't need 16 oz of noodles, maybe 8 oz would have been good, but overall it was all I could have expected!

I am only giving this 3 stars because it is only a base recipe.  You have to double or even triple the recipe to have a gravy that looks like the picture.  I think the next time, I will eliminate the water and add beef broth.  I also think I will use the other reviewer's idea and cook in the crock pot all day instead of cooking it in the oven.  The meat isn't that tender out of the oven.

This was a very good, simple recipe.  I only modified it a little.  First, I only used about half of the beef with onion soup mix (I generally find, in any recipe, an entire packet becomes overpowering), and I added some freshly ground black pepper.  I also used a smaller, but deeper, dish to bake it in as I had read other reviews that said it came out a little dry.  The results were great, and my husband actually had seconds!  I served it over brown rice with green beans on the side - great meal!  Thank you for this easy, yet delicious, recipe!!

I add milk instead of water and throw it all in the crock pot except the noodles.  Cook the noodles and add them right before serving.  Huge hit every time - great comfort food.

Very simple, one of my family's favorite dishes.  I throw everything but the egg noodles in the crock pot in the morning and cook on low all day.  Comes out with the meat falling apart, regardless of the cut of meat.

Sounded good, but really didn't have much flavor.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and used milk instead of water.  Some reviewers said it was salty, however even using the beef onion soup mix it didn't seem salty to us.  I will try again, maybe omitting the milk as the sauce was a bit runny and adding a package of beef grazy mix to add more beefy flavor.  Also will serve over mashed potatoes instead of noodles, even with my homemade noodles it just lacked flavor.

This has good flavor, but I thought the meat was too dry and a little tough.  I probably won't make again unless I convert it to the crock pot.

I kept the noodles seperate and glad I did. The meat is great but not so much with noodles. I will make the meat mixture regularly but alone with sides or with mashed potatoes instead of noodles.

I usually don't change up the recipe too much but I followed some other reviews and added a can of milk, a small bottle of red wine, a package of fresh sliced mushrooms and used 3 cans of mushroom w/ roasted garlic soup and 2 lbs of stew meat.  Cooked in crock pot on low for about 6 hours.  Served over mashed potatoes. It was yummy.

This recipe was very easy and good tasting.  I cooked in the crock pot for about 5 hours and added garlic and onion for some additional flavor.  I would have liked to have it a little thicker.  I think next time I will add more than one can of cream of mushroom soup.

Good as it is, but of course we had to add sour cream and hot sauce.... it just needed to be creamier, maybe I'll try milk instead of water next time.

Really delicious although I made a few changes. I substituted the 1 cup of water with a decent Cabernet, used 2 cans of condensed soup, and halved the onion soup mix, and added 2 chopped carrots. It was delicious, the red wine really adds something to the dish.

Super easy dish to make and really delicious.  I used Lipton Onion Soup instead of beef onion and I also omitted the mushrooms because I did not have a can of them.  I would recommend using a bit more water since it came out of the oven rather dry.  I added boiling water to get the consistency I wanted.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

WAY too salty and I followed the suggestions to redcuce the saltiness of the dish. The only one that liked it was my 18 month old. Disaster to the rest of the family. Will NEVER make again

I used a condensed cream of mushroom soup that had garlic added, and cooked it in a 300 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours.  SO GOOD and really easy to throw together.

I thought it was too bland, but my younger cousins rated it an A+, and it was easy to make. This isn't a dish I would cook for myself, but it'll probably stay in my arsenal for the younger kids in the family.

I added to the sauce using milk and thickened it up with 2 tbsp cornstarch per some suggestions from other reviewers.  It was a little bland at first, but after adding a bit of salt, it was great!  It got some mixed reviews from my family, but I would try this again! :-)

This was delicious! I sauteed half a sweet onion and browned the meat before adding to the sauce mixture. I also used a jar of sliced mushrooms, 1 clove of garlic and fresh ground pepper. For the noodles, I used whole wheat no yolk egg noodles and no one knew the difference. Tastes even better the next day as most things do!

I followed the advice of a few others and used milk instead of water.  I also added about 1/4 c of red cooking wine, which really makes a difference.  Very good sauce. The meat was a little over done baking for an hour, but that might have been the cut of beef I was using.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is sooo easy and can be customized for any family. We don't like mushrooms enough to add all that the recipe calls for, but we love garlic so I add a couple cloves and of course some salt and pepper. Perfect for a weeknight.

This dish was decent.  Next time I'll take the advice of others and add some red wine or even omit the mushrooms completely as this dish was WAAAY salty.  I plan on making this again for sure.  I used milk instead of water, omitted the mushrooms, and used fat free cream of mushroom soup the second time around, it was a lot better.

Okay, so my house we don't do mushrooms.  However, we did this by switching the cream of mushroom soup with cram of onion soup.  Eliminated the mushrooms and followed through with the rest of the recipe. Cut back on the noodles to about 3/4 of a bag and everyone loved it.  My God child who is in college and begs for home cooking.  All but did a handstand, then took the leftovers for lunch.

This was a little bland, but could be great with some help. I suggest using salt and pepper on the noodles whilel boiling them. I served everyone's bowl with a scoop of sour cream. This added a lot of flavoring.

I liked this recipe but it  was a little salty with the package of onion soup when made on the stove top...I just added another can of mushroom soup and poured in a little milk until it was the right thickness.   very quick and easy to make if you have left over roast :) Oh the most important note... the kids devoured the dish

Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Everything else I did the same and it was fantastic! Really similar to beef stroganoff(sp?)! Simple. Tasty. So good! Adding this to my monthly menu.

I didn't have canned mushrooms on hand, so I chopped up half an onion and 2 celery stalks. I also wasn't in the mood for noodles, so I put beef and sauce on top of a bed of mashed potatoes! Yum! Next time I will make more sauce.

We made this tonight with venison.  It was a tough old deer so we cooked it low and slow to help tenderize it.  We cooked it for 2 hours at 300 degrees.  Also, I used 1/2 cup of red wine instead of water and we served ours over rice.  Yummy!

I added lots of chopped garlic to this recipe and since I was looking for a quick recipe, I cooked it in my pressure cooker to ensure the meat would be tender, and it was. Thanks for the recipe.

I took the advice of others and only used half the package of soup mix and used milk instead of water.  This was still way too salty and the beef was overcooked / tough.

While flavorful, the salt level is a bit high.  I will definitely be cutting it with some sour cream.

My husbands fave! I don't add any extra mushrooms, not that big on them. I did switch it up a bit though when I doubled the recipe I used one packet onion soup mix and one packet onion mushroom mix, he likes it better this way. Either way great recipe!

Everyone liked this and I'd make it again. I browned the meat before tossing it into the dish. Also, cover it while it's baking, otherwise the tips can get a little dry. Warning: watch the sodium level in the dry soup mix. It could easily get too salty.

Really good recipe.  The guys loved it!  I will try it in the slow cooker as some suggest next time as I found the beef a little chewy.  I had a ton of gravy left when this was done.  I put in the extra half can of water and covered it when I cooked it.  I also added the onions and garlic as someone else suggested.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Pretty good, although I like softer meat so I might try round steak instead next time.  I also added a package of brown gravy mix and a soup can full of milk like on of the others suggested and it turned out great.

I couldn't find beef & onion soup mix so I substituted 1 can of beef broth and used some cornstarch as a thickener.  I also substituted meatballs (24) for the beef.   I really liked this recipe!!

I add some frozen minced onion for flavor, a little white pepper to the meat for zip, and an extra can of mushrooms (or some leftover ones from the fridge, whichever I happen to have).

This is just a great dish.  We love it.

Good comfort food!  I used one can cream of mushroom, one can golden mushroom, and milk instead of water for the sauce.  Also, browned meat with garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.  Baked, covered at 350* for 45 min.  Stirred the noodles into the sauce (only needed 1/2 pkg.) prior to serving.  Sprinkled with parsley for color.  Served with peas and homemade rolls.  Everyone agreed that this recipe is a keeper!

I really shouldn't rate this cuz I didn't have all the 'correct' ingredients!  I had golden mushroom (it's mushroom w/beef), no onion/beef soup pkt, used a packet of onion gravy and everything else the same.  I served over rice and it was OK. I put it all in the crockpot this morning on low...

Great recipe, also budget-friendly. The meat to noodle ratio seems too heavy on the side of the noodles; I've been using brown rice instead. Not too salty, and it's even better if you simmer it for an extended amount of time.

I added sauteed onions, and used fresh mushrooms.  Also, I doubled the recipe.  Instead of adding water I used a half cup red wine and a half cup milk.  Added about a half cup of sour cream.  My only complaint was that it was too salty.  Next time I will use less of the onion soup mix.

Loved this recipe! I actually doubled the cream of mushroom soup so that it was creamier, and I sauted the beef tips instead of baking them. Annnd, I added some sour cream, so I guess it was more like a stroganoff. But it was delicious!

This was great.  I was going to take Dee Dee's suggestion and cook it for two hours at 275, but after only 1 hour of cooking, they were done and tender.  I used fresh cremini mushrooms instead of canned though.

This was really good, but there was not enough sauce,I only made 1/2 package of egg noodles and followed recipe exact except for adding 2 tbsp of sour cream to the sauce and there still wasn't enough, next time I'll double the sauce!

Loved it. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup and the bigger can of mushroom, my family loves mushrooms, and I added some parsley and garlic. I had to cook it a little while longer. Ithink next time I will cook rice with it instead of noodles.

Had some left over roast I needed to use up so tried it with this recipe.  My DH and I enjoyed it very much!  I did add a big dollop of sour cream before serving and I will make again with beef tips next time but did enjoy it very much with the roast as well!

This was good, my kids actually ate it! I added sour cream, a dash of milk, 1 clove of garlic, chopped onion, and chopped fresh parsley. I think adding 8 oz of sour cream gives it a bit more flavor, but you can dress this recipe up to your liking.

I have to cook this at least 2 times a month.  My boyfriend and mother LOVES it!!  We all like mushrooms, so I double the amount of mushrooms and added another can of cream of mushroom because it makes it a little more saucy.  Instead of noodles (because we are not big noodle fans) we use mashed potatoes.

OMG...what a great recipe!!!  The only change I made was to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned....My kids and hubby LOVED this dish!  Like another reviewers said, don't use stewing beef, splurge for the sirloin it is TOTALLY worth it...

This was very fast and easy to make.  Could not find the canned soup, so I used the dry soup mix.  Next time I'll try Golden Onion Soup mix.  The taste was a little too salty and "synthetic".

I used Omaha Steak's beef tips and they are just wonderful to begin with, so they really added to this recipe.  I made the recipe as printed with the exception of an addition of a small amount of red cooking wine.  We all enjoyed it for 2 nights!!

I don't know what I did differently, but this dish came out very dry. I think the flavors would have been good if I didn't have a hard time eating. I would like to try again and maybe either cook at a lower temp and for longer, or cup the cooking time down.

This was simple and delicious!  I used cubed stew meat for simplicity and added crushed garlic and some black pepper to season and it added nice flavor - next time I may add a little more garlic.  The sauce was a little runny, and the meat a little overdone for my usual liking, so I may take it out a little sooner next time, but it was still tasty.  I may use slightly less water or try wine as others suggested.  Served over egg noodles, sourdough bread to dip and good old peas to sweeten & add a little green - Yum!

My girlfriend liked it. I didn't. Followed the recipe except for adding 1/2 cup of milk to the 1 cup of water. In the end, it was too watery and lacked any real taste. Added cornstarch after the fact. Won't do this one again.

Easy to make.  I don't know where you find onion beef soup mix, so I used onion soup mix and chicken broth.  It was ok.  Not great, but not bad.  It was easy to make.

Husband loved it, easy to make. I doubled the ingredients except for the soup mix--just added one package. I also chopped up an onion and added it the sauce. I used a top round roast for the meat.

This tasted really good.  I didn't add the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them, but he didn't realize I used cream of mushroom soup or onion soup mix, which he normally wouldn't have liked.  I would recommend browning the meat first and making more sauce.

this is a dish my mom used to make!  i use reduced fat cream of mushroom, cut lean sirloin in tiny bite-sized pieces so it cooks faster, and bake it 350 degrees for 35 minutes covered in foil.  I serve it with wheat egg noodles and it's perfect.

This recipe was amazing.  Now I did change it quite a bit...I added a couple of cloves of fresh garlic which is a given change to any recipe.  I also used a pound and a quarter of meat, and doubled the rest.  I used half water and half red wine, which made the dish.  I also added fresh mushrooms, because canned mushrooms are basically like anything else in a can!  With my changes it was a stand up fav for beef tips and noodles in my house.

My husband LOVED this.  He wants me to make it a weekly dish.  I on the other hand thought it lacked flavor and was just ok.  I used the exact ingredients listed but cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes.  I also sauted the steak and mushrooms together before baking.

Great recipe, but I cut it down to 30 minutes in the oven by  browning it a little on the stove top, then putting it in the oven, in a little foil packet for 30 minutes. I used fresh mushrooms b/c I didn't have canned. Cut the onion mix to half (all I had). Great! Thank you!

This is a keeper!  I know my husband will request this often.  I used beef bouillon in the water when I boiled the egg noodles, just for a little extra flavor.  Next time I may cut the onion soup in 1/2 because it was a little salty.  Great recipe!!!!

Like others, I did not use stew meat, but used stir frying sirloin chunks instead. It turned out GREAT. Flavor was great. I did have a problem with the meat cooking all the way through. I should have cooked the meat prior to putting it in the oven. I served it over egg noodles. My boyfriend almost licked the plate! Will definitely make again.

This was soooo easy and delicious too!! That's why it gets 5 stars from me.  I read the reviews before trying this recipe so I reduced my cook time to 45 min and the oven temp to 350. The sirloin tips were not dry at all!! I also covered for 1/2 of the cook time. The gravy had a wonderful flavor and I thought my son was going to lick his plate.  We served over wide egg noodles and had deli fresh brown and serve rolls.  We will definately be making this again!!

This was very good. I made it for my boyfriend last week and he loved it.  I don't think I use the right cut of beef, nonetheless, the gravy(mushroom soup)   made up for it.  I plan on making it again this week!

Pretty good.  Picky kids didnt like it much.  I would cover with foil next time when cooking in the oven or add more liquid because it seemed to get a bit dry.  I thougt the taste was good and would cook again.

I thought this was ok.  An easy meal.  Based on others recommendations I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of celery soup.  I used only 1/2 pack onion soup since I didn't have beef onion, and added some beef gravy mix.  I also increased the water by a half cup.  I did not have the salt issue others talked about with this mix.

Very tasty, I used beef bullion granules and onion flakes instead of the soup mix. Sauce was very runny, will thicken with flour next time. Overall easy and tasty.

It gets two stars for being edible at least. I'd consider making it again using brown gravy and onion powder instead of beef and onion soup....tasted too much like onion and the sauce was too runny. Also, should have used thicker noodles, got tired of chasing my food around the plate.

This was really easy, but really salty.  I used milk instead of water and left out the mushrooms.  I will probably try this again , but with some variations like reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup.

This was very good, and easy. I added a splash of sherry, but other than that folled as directed, came out good. I have to wonder if people's ovens are off or cooking too long to dry this out(making it so salty)? Anyway we liked it, thanks.

I think the key to this recipe is adding garlic! I stir fried extra lean stew meat with fresh garlic and garlic powder then threw in an onion and fresh mushrooms. I also used low sodium beef broth to add more juices and whole wheat egg noodles for a healthier option. So good! Everyone loved it! I did notice they were adding fresh ground pepper so I may do that on my own next time.

Recipe was very good. I used beef broth instead of water and added some fresh parsley. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and used about 3/4 of the package of onion soup so it wouldn't be too salty. Turned out great!!!

This was good I had a 2lb package of the best stew meat so I used that I wished I had added a little more water to compinstate for the extra meat.  After saying that I would only add that meat a lb didn't seem like enough.  This was good and I will make it again.

Very easy, very good.  My husband loves this dish, and even tells me I could cook it every night of the week.  Sometimes I serve over wheat pasta, sometimes over brown rice.  It is so easy and so yummy - it is a new family favorite.  The only thing I do differently is to double to sauce.  Thanks Julie!

This was very very good! (and so easy to make)  Hubby even gave compliments and he doesn't give those too easily!  Like the previous reviewer, I too would cover it for a while or stir in the middle because the tops of the beef tips got a bit dark (not really burnt, though).  And I personally like a bit more gravy so I might add a tad more water.  But on the whole this was yummy!  Thanks for the new meal in our rotation!

This was good, but a little dry.  I would add 1/4 - 1/2 cup more water and only cook for 45 minutes so it won't get so dried out.  Covering it may help also.

Very tasty! I cut back on the beef and onion soup based on suggestions and it was great. Not too salty. Next time I will double the amount of sauce. Had way too many noodles left!

Yummy! I definitely suggest trying this recipe.  The sauce was delicious, but a teeny tiny bit on the salty side.  The meat was very tasty and tender.  This one is a keeper.

Ugh. I was surprised at all the good reviews. I hardly ever try recipes on this site that I don't like, but this was one of the few. It was very bland. My hubby didn't care much for it either. Oh well. Better luck next time! I guess one good thing is at least it's low in fat!

Be sure you use sirloin tips.  I used stew meat and the texture was very tough.  Also, I used 1 1/2 cups of water to make more gravy as others did.  Was a bit on the salty side, and I am a salt addict.
Will definitely make it again - overall, it was wonderful!

I thought this was very good.  I am a rice lover, so I served over rice and just like others used 2 cans of soup and about a cup and a half of water.  The meat was VERY tender.  I will definitely make again!

I WISH I would have read the reviews first.  This has to be made in a slow cooker.  The meat was too tough after cooking an hour in the oven.  Everyone agreed this tasted good, the meat was just wrong. I will try again in the slow cooker.

This was really good.  Like pot roast, but beef tips.  I took the advice of others and cooked in a slow cooker for 10 hours and didn't add the water.  2 cans of cream of mushroom soup to one packet of onion soup mix.

The tips come out so tender and the gravy was good.  I used plain onion mix (all I had)and sprinkled just 1/2 pckg just enough to top the tips.  I also added gravy master.  I will make again.  Whole family loved it.

This meal was a hit with my husband and I, though the kids didn't like it, but they are picky anyways.  I used 1.5 lbs of sirloin tips, fresh mushrooms, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, one packet of the beefy onion soup, 2 cups of water, 1/4 cup of cooking wine.  I had to cook it for about 1hr and 20 min. for the meat to be tender enough for our liking. This will definitly be a staple in our household!

This was hard to rate as the kids liked it, but the adults found it rather salty.  I used 2 cans of soup and 1 package of dry soup mix, and 1 cup water.  I sauteed  1 pound sliced mushrooms and 2 thinly sliced onions.  Served it with boiled potatoes. I will make it again as it was very quick to make, but will only use 1/2 package of dry soup.  Thanks Julie!

Used diced fresh mushrooms and about 1/4 onion, diced (both sauteed in butter) in lieu of canned mushrooms.  Used double the canned soup and double soup mix (one pkg of mix would be sufficient, it was a little salty for my taste). Used about 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Great leftovers!  Will make again.

A great basic, easy recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms and just sliced them in with the other ingredients before putting in the oven.  I used three times the meat called for and about a pound of mushrooms.  Next time I think I'll add some red wine to the gravy to give it a little more depth of flavor.

This was delicious! My boyfriend does not like Beef Stroganoff but wanted "something different" using beef. I found this and made it that night and he licked the plate clean! He even had leftovers the next day. My changes were as follows but I think I stayed pretty close to the original recipe: could not find already cut tips so I cubed a sirloin roast, used non-seasoned tenderizer before marinating, used half a package of soup mix with dried onions removed and added 1 diced onion instead, used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned and served over rice instead of noodles. Personally I love stroganoff so I think the noodles would have been great too!

I would've given this five stars but for some reason my meat was very tough.  Other than that, this was delicious.

This wasn't great. I thought it was way too salty. I cooked it as directed in a 9x13 pan and I think it could've been cooked in a 9x9 pan easily. I lost most of the sauce, I think I should've covered the dish, this probably would've prevented such a loss of moisture and such a salty taste. I only cooked it for 45 minutes also. Maybe I did something wrong, but I don't think I will try this one again.

This was very simple to make. I think that next time I would use only 1/2 a package of onion soup mix because the whole package caused the dish to be salty. However, it was a good dish and my husband liked it. He rated it 4 stars. Will make again. Thanks

I was disappointed with this. My family thought it tasted like stroganoff with a heavy canned soup taste. Was easy to assemble but lacked any kind of "homemade" flavor.Won't make again.

These were very good!  I didn't bake them but did them in a slow cooker instead. I used onion-mushroom soup mix but added some beef bouillion but they still came out very tastey and tender.  Good on rice or noodles.  Will make it again and again.  Mik Snegirev   Alaska

I made this for dinner and my three year old asked for seconds!! It was easy to prepare and tasted great. I will make this again for sure!
