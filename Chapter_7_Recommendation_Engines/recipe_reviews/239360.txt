Potatoes wind up too dry. They were OK but probably won't make them again.

I didn' use both methods - I whisked together the oil and molasses, tossed the sweet potatoe cubes in it and seasoned with salt, pepper and sage (totally forgot the cinnamon), then just roasted for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Good flavor, not overly sweet.  We really liked these!
