We love this. I cook the asparagus my usual way - add spears to boiling salted water, and simmer until they turn bright green (about 2 mins). Drain, and immerse in a bowl of iced water - heat the butter in the skillet, add the asparagus and and let it heat through. I then add the almonds, and stir. I sprinkle the cheese over the asparagus on the serving plate - this all avoids soggy almonds, over-cooked asparagus, and gluey cheese. Delicious and easy. Thanks!

I made this as a side dish for a Sunday family dinner and received wonderful reviews on it! The only thing I did different was that after I bolied the asparagus, I drained them and then immediately put them in ice water.  I laighly sauteed the almonds in butter and then turned the heat down and added the asparagus. I added the cheese after I removed it from the pan to elliminate a big string mess and to make a great presentation. This is a great way to get your kids to eat asparagus and almonds are an excellent source of nutrition!

I love this- make it all the time.  I never use shredded parmesan however; it probably would gum up if you did.  The cheese browns quickly and you kind of have to watch it.  It is yummy and the ONLY way I'll eat asparagus.  Thanks!

Very tasty. I used olive oil in place of butter and added some pepper, garlic sea salt and used toasted slivered almonds.  Beautiful, easy and a new regular for us. Thanks for sharing.

This was easy and delicious!  I waited to add the Parmesan until I put the asparagus on the serving platter, which worked out quite well.  Yum!

Didn't care  for the cooking method, which is why I rate this four stars.  Specifically, I know that adding and "cooking" the cheese with the asparagus in the pan would have resulted in a sticky, nasty pan to clean so while I used the ingredients as directed in the recipe, I just modified how I put it together.  I simply steamed the asparagus, then dressed it up with the almonds (toasted at 350 degrees for 5 minutes) and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Elegant and steps above plain, cooked asparagus - five stars.

I used freshly shredded parmesan cheese and ended up with crisp and tasty asparagus with a wad of melted cheeses studded with almonds. Won't be making this again.

My sons (who don't much care for asparagus) asked me to make this two nights in a row.  There's something about the combination of the browned Parmesan with the asparagus that's wonderful.  I recommend this one for sure.

Aside from waiting to add the parmesan once the asparagus is plated, this recipe is the best way to serve asparagus!  Why oh WHY do people insist on making casseroles and covering their delicious asparagus with needless toppings???  Here's a quick, no fuss version I use:  Toss raw asparagus in olive oil or melted butter, spread out onto baking sheet (lined w/ foil for easy cleanup), sprinkle almonds or cashews on top, and bake at 450 in toaster oven or conventional oven for about 10 minutes.  Top with parmesan when ready to serve. Delicioso!!!

Very nice flavors.  I changed it up a bit to serve with fillet Mignon and rice pilaf.  I trimmed about 1 1/2 inches off the ends of the stalks. Then I sautéed the asparagus with butter while the sliced almonds toasted in the oven.  After the asparagus was about halfway done (~6,7 minutes) I cracked in some sea salt and fresh black pepper, and a little less than a teaspoon of (jarred) chopped garlic.   Threw in the almonds and sautéed for about 4 more minutes just until the asparagus got softer at the ends.   I tossed the sauté into a small baking dish (I had a pie pan handy, lined with tin foil for easy cleanup). Put my (probably more than) 1/3 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and baked until it smelled yummy. The cheese crisped nicely especially on the almonds. Asparagus came out delicious, not undercooked and not mushy.  Mmmm- no leftovers though :-(

This was simple and yummy...I did what someone suggested and blanched the asparagus first, then just sauteed in butter, sea salt and pepper and at the very end, I added the parm and almonds (and garlic).  Very tasty!

Good and tasty. I prepped the asparagus, as usual w/olive oil, fresh ground salt and pepper, minced garlic under the broiler. Then, added the almonds toward the end, and parm cheese at the last second to kind of melt it but not totally melt it.

I love this recipe. This is how I always prepare asparagus now. Like the other reviewers, I put the cheese on at the last second so that the cheese isn't gluey.

Great taste and super easy to make!  I followed the advice listed below and dropped the fresh asparagus in boiling water until bright green and tender. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes altogether. Then put in ice water to stop the cooking process while heating up the saute pan with melted butter. Tossed briefly with a little bit of minced garlic and almonds.  Added the parmesan right before serving.  I think the parmesan would really glue up on you in the pan.  Turned out beautifully with the Hudson baked Tilapia recipe I found here as well.

I was looking for a new way to cook asparagus so I gave this recipe a try. I'm so glad I did because it's awesome! We ate it all that night, so when we fixed our pork chop left overs the next night, I tried the same recipe with green beans instead of asparagus and that was just as yummy! This is a keeper.

Aside from what other reviewers commented I found using the parmesan cheese as the recipe instructs to be a fantastic and elegent way to serve asparagus.  I believe the problem with those who found addding the cheese while cooking didn't work was because they used the dried type of parmesan.  I used freshly grated parmesan and the recipe turned out superb, made an elegent presentation and tasted wonderful. This recipe will definitely go into my recipe box.  I will also serve it to dinner guests. I give it five stars plus!!

The flavors were very nice together. I added a little garlic and salt to the melted butter before sauteing the asparagus, then plated a layer of asparagus, sprinkled with parmesan and oven toasted almonds (the powdery parm actually worked better than fresh grated for me - did not melt and stick together), then more asparagus, etc. The heat from the vegetables was enough to soften the cheese, and this way the slice almonds did not stick together as well. Very nice for a self-hosted dinner party. I prepped everything ahead of time, and since the asparagus take very little time to cook, I did not have to excuse myself from my guests for long. Yum!

very yummy!  I did make a couple of changes.  I changed the butter for olive oil and roasted the almonds (which I chopped) first in olive oil and then added the asparagus which I cut into bite size pieces and then added the parm cheese last.  Yummy! Yummy!

I made it just as the recipe stated and it was delicious!  The parmesan cheese and almond flavors melded together with the asparagus perfectly...it was a hit with my husband and me!  We'll definitely be making it again. It was super easy and fast too!

This was a simple yet very good recipe!  I only had whole almonds in the house so I did not use any and this was still great.  I plan on trying it in the future with the almonds!

Great change from same old boiled, steamed, or roasted asparagus.  Just delicious.  Did use olive oil, but other than that followed recipe exactly; added parmesan at very end.  Excellent!!!

I cooked this in melted butter for about 10 min. and then sprinkled with mozzarella and parmesan chees.  I left off the nuts, but it was delicious this way.

Very good recipe - cooking times were right on.  Would suggest less butter, stirring in almonds first, and then finishing by topping with cheese.  Stirring in the cheese allows it to slide off the asparagus, melt/burn at the bottom, reducing the cohesiveness of the dish.  Still, the resulting crust tasted amazing.

We loved this!  It was quick and easy to prepare and had wonderful flavor.  Went very nicely with grilled chicken and scalloped potatoes.  There is nothing I would do differently, it's great just as is.

sooo yummy! i used a non-stick pan so i had no trouble some others mentioned about cheese sticking.  you do need to watch it because once the cheese starts to brown, it goes fast.

Good recipe!  I took the suggestions of others and cooked the asparagus in some boiling water, and I took it out and immediately added it to the butter and almonds.  I cooked it for a minute, put it on the serving dish, and then put the cheese on it.  I had a person who "doesn't like asparagus" try it and rave about it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really quite tasty. I used slivered almonds and cut the asparagus into 1 1/2 inch pieces, adding the bottom parts to the pan first (to cook a little longer as they are tougher). Added some garlic sea salt & pepper, and used parmesean-romano grated cheese after I plated the asparagus. Very good and QUICK!

Simple and delicious.  We didn't have any parm, but substituted some San Joaquin Gold.  The almonds, cheese and butter combined into something spectacular and complimented the asparagus quite nicely.

A++ for taste and simplicity! I added a dash of salt (since I used unsalted butter) and also added to the pan 2 cloves of minced garlic, tore up some fresh basil leaves, and tossed in some cherry tomatoes into the mix. The asparagus was crunchy, the tomatoes juicy...I will be making this again! Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious! I boiled the asparagus and placed it in ice water as suggested and then put it in the fridge til I was ready to make this for a side dish. I added the parmesan cheese in the last minute of cooking time. Everyone enjoyed this!

This was the best asparagus I ever made. I'll be sticking with this recipe from now on. I read another reviewers note about boiling the asparagus, then chilling it in ice water, then cooking it as the recipe states. It made it perfect. I used the normal kraft parmesan and let it get its slight brown crisp. I used smart balance butter which cut down on the fat. I highly suggest this recipe. Didn't have the almonds but didn't need them cause it did not lack any flavor what so ever. It is like having asparagus in a fine steakhouse!

This was a wonderful dish!  I made it twice, and it was definitely better to sprinkle the cheese on just before serving.  It's just a little globby if you sprinkle the cheese while it is still in the pan.  I transferred the cooked asparagus to a serving dish, sprinkled the cheese, tossed it and sprinkled a little more... Perfection!  Even my picky 4 & 5 year olds liked it!  Wow, that's really saying something!

Awesome! For healthier variation when I made a second time, I steamed the asparagus, toasted the almond briefly at 350 in the oven, then plated and sprinkled parm cheese on top, drizzled w/EVOO.

I can find no fault with this recipe.  We all liked it, but then again, we haven't found many asparagus recipes we don't like. We are asparagus freaks and like it just about any way you can find to cook it.  I did use slivered almonds since it is what I had and toasted them before adding to the asparagus and cheese.

I too boiled the asparagus first. I had a few almonds on hand that I had to cut up myself. I addedthem in with the asparagus and butter so they would soften a bit. It was terrific! I will most definately make this again!

We liked this recipe... We're still not big asparagus fans, but the cheese and nuts give it a nice crunch and some added flavor.

With a few added spices (that you may personally like) - this is very good! I toasted sliced almonds and pine nuts and added them at the very last minute along with the parmesan cheese. VERY TASTY!

Very good indeed. As usual, I replaced butter with olive oil to make it more heart-friendly. I also pre-cooked the asparagus for 3 minutes or so in boiling water before moving it on the skillet.  Finally, I would recommend adding crushed garlic to taste when the oil warms up but before adding the main ingredients to the skillet.

This was delicious.  Even my very picky 2 and 4 year olds ate it up.  I will definitely make again.  The only thing I did different was to replace the butter with about a tablespoon of EV olive oil

This was very good.  It was a little bland.  Needs salt, pepper and IMO also some garlic.  But the almonds and Parmesan cheese made the dish!

These were pretty good, I did add a little lemon juice for flavor.  The cheese got a little hard but it still tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe we will be making these again.  I am going to try them with a little garlic next time.

I like to steam my asparagus first then put 1 tbsp. of butter in a pan over med heat add 3 cloves of garlic then add the almonds and asparagus and I stir for a couple minutes and put on a serving plate and then sprinkle the parmesan on top.  The garlic really makes the dish!!

This was a very good side dish for Christmas Dinner. I used fresh Parmesan so with the butter it was a bit too rich for me. Others liked it though. If I make this again, I will use less Parmesan.

This was DELISH!!!  Now, I took another reviewers advice and cooked the asparagus in salted water, drained, and ran cold water over to quit the asparagus from cooking.  Then I heated butter w/ garlic and added the asparagus.  Before adding the almonds I added a "splash" of Worcestershire sauce.  That made this dish for me.  The Worcestershire sauce added a nice tangy-ness to it.  After sauteing I added the almonds (so that they wouldn't get soggy). I didn't add the parm until I was ready to serve.  I just sprinkled the parm (fresh)and placed the lid over the pan (after removing from direct heat) and let the cheese melt that way.  Def. a DO-OVER!!

Very easy and quick.  I, too, waited until after the cooking to add the cheese, but I put the nuts in with the asparagus so they could toast.

Very easy instructions, very different result from my usual grilled asparagus with olive oil and garlic. Per others' suggestion, I did boil mine first as well, but drained the water and immediately added butter and 1 T Olive oil to saute on the stovetop. We didn't have almonds on hand so I substituted minced pecans with excellent results. I used Kroger grated Parmesan but merely dusted the spears and let it stay in a warm oven to melt the cheese w/o making a stringy mess. I'll start alternating this dish with my usual garlic broiled spears.

I really liked this recipe!  I think it needs to be said that you should use the pre-grated parmesan cheese in the classic green container.  Otherwise, it will all melt and clump together if you use fresh.  I followed the recipe and it came out beautifully!  The only change I made was to sub 1/2 the butter with olive oil.  I'm always tempted to add salt, and I did in this case, but it really wasn't needed because of the salt in the cheese.  Also, don't be tempted to add garlic either.  The flavors are wonderful as is!

My guests loved this dish, and so did I. I couldn't find fresh Parmesan so i used regular Parmesan you'd sprinkle on pasta dishes. I'd eat it more often but it really messes up my urine :(

Really fast and definitely easy!  I followed others suggestions of boiling asparagus a couple of minutes before putting in a skillet and I shredded parmesan on after it had been plated. Also, I used pine nuts instead of almonds because I had them on hand.  I love roasted asparagus and this was definitely a nice change.  I will make again.

Delicious, quick, easy!  I added mushrooms as well, just because I am a mushroom addict.  I also put some more garlic into the butter before I added the asparagus.  Definately a regular on my menu.

I rate this as 3 1/2 stars. This recipe tasted good, although I did have a little bit of trouble with the cheese. The almonds and the cheese clumped together when the cheese melted, and it didn't stick to the asparagas at all. Like I said, it tasted good, but because of the cheese problem, the presentation was lacking.

I would give it about 4 1/2 but the option isn't here I guess.  My favorite asparagus is roasted with course salt, pepper and olive oil.  This was however very tasty and very easy.  My husband loved it and wants it added to our Easter dinner menue.

Followed Caroline C's advice to boil in salted water for 2 minutes then put in ice water before cooking on stove. Omitted the parmesan. Turned out PERFECT. My fiance still hasn't stopped talking about it!

This is a really tasty recipe for a side vegetable.  My sister in law and my husband both loved it, and they've always hated asparagus!  I gave it four stars, because the butter and cheese tasted slightly on the heavier side; just my preference to not have asparagus get overwhelmed with a heavy taste.

Turned out nice-everyone liked-even kids. We enjoyed fresh and full (but not too thick) sprouts and added a dash of bacon (Hormel) for flavoring.

Amazing, I did turn my heat off while I added the parmesan so it didn't get too brown.  The crispness of the cheese and almonds were so good.

As a change from boiled, I made this for my family and we just loved it. Then I served it at a dinner club we belong to, and everyone said it was great.  Now that's the only way we have asparagus.  It's so easy too!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very simple and very tasty. I used freshly grated romano instead of parmesan and lots of almonds. The flavors all combined great. No problems with the cheese.

I read the reviews and I would suggest using a non stick pan to pre-brown (make em crunchy!)  the parmesan to sprinkle on with toasted almonds at time of serving. The parmesan sprinkles should be browned and look something like a lace doily when you precook them. 
I did the precook and waterbath as I was taking this dish to a potluck. I shaved butter into the bottom of the pan and added toasted almonds then asparagus and then more shaved butter over the top. Warmed through and set asparagus on plates scooped almonds (and butter) from the bottom of the pan, garnished with the lacy parmesan crunches and fresh parmesan shavings and served.

I don't go to all the trouble to boil in water and then ice after as some do here, it's not necessary.  Just keep your heat down low, melt butter, add garlic, salt to taste and then put in your asparagus. Keep shaking them around to evenly cook. About 5 to 6 min, then turn heat up slightly and add almonds. Go another 2min. then plate them and sprinkle on the Parmesan cheese.  If done right this is a side dish that will get you great compliments.

I should have read the reviews and I could have avoided the lumpy cheese. Great flavor but will add the cheese for serving next time, not in the skillet!

Blanch asparagus first for 2 minutes, then place into ice water. until cool.  Dry onto towel.  Sauté almonds in butter in large saucepan, then add cooled asparagus and heat.  Transfer to plate, cover with shredded parmesan cheese.  Oh BOY!

Loved this recipe! I like it best with kraft parmesan.  The one that looks like powder.  It works far better in this recipe than fresh grated parmesan.

This was pretty good - not fantastic, but worth keeping. I made it exactly as written, and served it as suggested: as a side for grilled salmon. One minor thing is that maybe less butter could have been used - it was a bit "wet" in my opinion. Otherwise, I enjoyed it.

i made a few changes based on recomenations. I added minced garlic and used fresh parmesan. the parmesan i added after i finished cooking the asparagus. it came out great.
