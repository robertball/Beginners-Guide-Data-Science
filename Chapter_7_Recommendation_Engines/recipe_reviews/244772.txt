These were ridiculously good for how little effort was put into them. Not sure if it was the feta, the dressing, or the combo with  spinach but they screamed Greek without the addition of a ton of seasonings and spices. I think olives would be a nice extra touch and will add some the next time I make this.

Didn't use spinach, made into a meatloaf and baked at 365 for 35 minutes.

Left out the spinach, as I didn't have any. Used the rest of a Greek dressing I had made. Added a bit of garlic powder to the mix as well. Here in Germany, I use Brötchen instead of hamburger buns. I fried these up in a pan as well, nice and crispy, moist inside. Great turkey burgers!

These burgers are now my favorite!!! They were juicy and flavorful. The only changes I made was to use 3 egg whites and reduced fat feta cheese.  No more ground beef for me!! Try these....you won't be disappointed.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I might try baking them in the oven next time because they fell apart on the grill. (unless you have a formen). They still tasted amazing--and I forgot to add the dressing so I just poured it over them. I would suggest maybe a side of tzatziki--because i love that sauce and think it could make anything better. I probably will just eat the patty by itself, no bun,it's that good!

I have been looking for a turkey burger recipe for years. This was so good!  I didn’t have the spinach so I left it out and I cut the recipe in half using just the egg white. I still got 5 large patties so I will probably continue to cut the recipe. I also used garlic breadcrumbs because that is what I had. I think that added a bit of flavor. I paired it with tomatoes and peppercinis. I will make this again....probably soon.

I followed the recipe and liked the flavor but I had a real hard time with the texture. To mushy. I'm not sure if it was because of the ground turkey brand I used, the brand I usually use was not available so had to use Jennie O which I don't care for.

These burgers were great! My husband does not like strong cheese, so I did not add the cheese into the mix. I subbed out crumbled goat cheese for the Feta cheese, and put the cheese with some chopped tomato in a whole grain pita bread along with the burger. So good!.

These were good, but, I wasn't crazy about the texture you get from using the bread crumbs.  It reminded me of a meatball.  The flavors were very good though.  I served on mediterranean pita bread with tomatoes, clover sprouts, & tzatziki.

Very very tasty burger. Recipe is perfect as is. Not much salt needed. I found 5min a side a little too much but bbq's vary. Love this recipe. This will be a regular at our house!

Very tasty. I halved the recipe, and I didn't have any dressing on hand. I did use an entire egg, left out the onion and used some garlic. Also put spinach on top with tzatiki sauce we had on hand. It matched a throw together recipe that I've been using with a little bit more structure on the measurements. Well definitely make again.

This was a simple and versital recipe that we could easily make gluten and dairy free.  We added goat chevre instead of feta and used gluten free bread to make out bread crumbs.  We also changed the dressing to fit what we had on hand and it worked out great.  The only concern we had was that the burgers were a bit squishy so we decided to cook them in a skillet instead of a grill.  They firmed up fine once cooked.  Delish!!  Enjoy!!

Okay, I modified the ingredients, to go with what I had on hand, but basically followed the recipe, subbing in Caesar dressing and parmesan cheese.  Great turkey burgers that smelled and tasted wonderful, and held together well when grilling.
