Not so good.  The cupcake part was ok, just not something that I'd ever make again.  The icing had a good taste but was really messy and not really good for transporting.  Still searching!  :)

The cupcakes were great and a huge hit.  The white chocolate ganache wasn't the greatest.

the cupcake part was good...didn't like the ganache, too runny, not creamy enough for my liking
