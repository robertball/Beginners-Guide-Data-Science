This is the best. I sometimes leave out the herbs and finish up with a super white bread which keeps well

Wow---this was phenomenal! I used 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour instead of the other stuff, combined with 1/4 cup of oatmeal. I used fresh, chopped rosemary from our garden. I have been wanting to make this bread for awhile now, and it didn't disappoint---so good! PS Only used about a 1/4 tsp. of black pepper since I was making this for my boys, 1 tsp. pepper seemed a bit much. Also shaped and baked in oven.

This is such a healthy delicious bread! I converted the recipe to avoid using the bread machine because I don't have one. Instead I formed the dough into two long skinny ropes cut slashes in the top and baked them in the oven. The only other change I made was to cut the salt and pepper back to 1/2 tsp. The bread came out very delicious this way...the only other change I would consider is maybe soaking the oat bran in some of the water for 1/2 hour before mixing up the dough so that it would be softer. Thanks so much for sharing...this recipe is a keeper!

I left out the rosemary so I could make mini-burgers using this bread recipe (placed everything in bread machine and pushed 'dough' then rolled into golfball sized balls and baked at 375 for about 12 min.) Kids gobbled them right up!

the rosemary was just the touch! I had a whole cup of mozzarella cheese and didn't want to have any leftovers so in it went and it was ok. definitely a keeper!

This bread was good however the rosemary was a bit overpowering for my taste. Everyone else at the table liked it.

Delicious bread. I omitted the muzzarela because I didn't have any but then added extra parmesan cheese.

Very nice. No this does not rise much but you have to consider the ingredients here. If you'd like it to rise more let it rise longer and/or add more vital wheat gluten. The ingredients are pretty heavy in this and they aren't that balanced by the white flour so bear that in mind. I used all parmesan and dried rosemary. Turned out well. thanks for the recipe!

This did not rise well and it tasted worse. I substituted whole wheat flour for the gluten (which I always do) so perhaps that was the problem but this was really bad and a waste of mozz and parm and fresh rosemary. We won't try this again. My husband said it was too salty too (and he's not one to complain).

Had trouble getting this to rise so I tried it again. Same problem. I have used the yeast before and since so I know the yeast is not the problem.
