Tried this last night.I had bluefin tuna right off the fishing boat.Wasn't sure if I would like this marinade,but am really glad I tried it. It came out great.I did however make two small changes,I used crushed pineapple,because I didn't have preserves ,and because I don't like sesame oil,used regular olive oil.It was grilled to just rare and served over a salad with a light lime vinaigrette.I am sure this recipe will stay in my recipe box and used regularly.

Great! I used apricot-pineapple preserves bc that's what I had. The marinade is awesome - I used about 2/3 of it to marinate and saved 1/3 to glaze the fish after cooking. Also added a little chili oil, since we like heat - but the flavor is perfect as is. Thanks!

Probably one of the best pieces of marinated fish I've ever enjoyed! Tender, flaky and very tasty. I think it would also make a wonderful marinade for chicken or pork. I'll have to try it sometime.

This is a tasty,easy recipe!I used apricot preserves because that is what I had on hand.I had never heard of hoisen sauce,but that was easily found in my grocery store's ethnic food aisle.My husband really loves this recipe and my 16 y/o daughter, who is almost a strictly chicken and pasta eater,gave it the thumbs up!My other kids(19 & 13) ate it also, no complaints.We've made this twice. I think the first time we(I should say my hubby, he's the "grillmaster")overcooked it.The second time we kept a closer eye on the timing and it turned out perfect!We'll continue to use this recipe.

I made these for my family and they loved them. I topped each with a pineapple mango salsa which sent the flavor through the roof! They were so loved that I also made them for my father's birthday dinner and they were also a huge success

Did not care for this at all.  The hoisin sauce really didn't combine well with the other ingredients.  Maybe leaving that out would work, but will not make this again.

Hubby got 20 lbs of yellowtail from his deep sea fishing trip. This was the first and best recipe we tried.   Boil the remaining glaze and spread it on the cooked tuna.  Serve over couscous and wow your guests!

I have to be honest here, after I mixed the ingredient together and put the tuna steaks in a ziploc bag, I went yuk, it looked terrible. But I grilled the tuna steaks after marinading the steaks for over an hour and all I can say is YUM!  It was so good.  My husband and my daughter's boyfriend loved it!

Fixed it with apricot preserves and thought it needed to be sweeter. Will definately fix it again using pineapple or some sweeter tropical preserves. I also think we cooked it too long and slightly underdone would have made it more flavorful.

I made this with Apricot-Pineapple preserves as that's all I could find at the store, and I increased the amount of fresh cilantro. I marinated the fish (a shark steak) for two hours, which was perfect for us. The shark had a super firm/ dense texture which I wasn't especially crazy about, but the flavors came together really well. I reserved a couple of Ts of marinade to pour over the cooked fish. Served it over soba noodles with sesame green beans. Not bad at all. Thanks, dakota!

I made this recipe with a few changes to work with the ingredients that I had in my kitchen.  I used apricot preserves, lemon instead of lime juice, olive oil instead of sesame and I didn't use fresh cilantro or ginger (I used spices from a jar).  The marinade was very tasty.  Unfortunately my fish turned out dry.  I think I may have cooked it a little long? I also broiled the fish instead of grilling- that may have been a factor?  Overall I think this is a good recipe- I'm unsure if I will try it again.  My kids (ages 7, 4 & 1) weren't thrilled with it.

I used crushed,drained pineapple as another reviewer suggested because I had no preserves in the house.  It was a delicious marinade, but I only used 2 tuna steaks for us.

Very nice! We're big tuna steak fans, so I decided to rescue this from my recipe box.  The weather warmed up enough for us to grill outdoors, using cedar planks to add additional flavor.  We used apricot preserves.  I might cut the amount back next time, but all in all, this was a quick, easy dinner served alongside a tossed salad. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because our guests said they're tuna steaks turned out perfectly.  The one my husband and I shared was the one that fell apart on the grill.  I think we'll try this again, and not marinate it so long.  I've learned you're not supposed to marinate fish for a long time or it can make it tough.  Anyway, the flavors in this dish were great!  Worth a second try for sure!

Wow! I made this exactly as the recipe. It only took a few minutes to prepare. I used bluefin tuna (that my hubby had caught and that had been frozen in vacuum bags) cooked it on a grill pan as it was cold outside. The 4 minute-per-side cook time was too long, so I pulled it early. This was the best I've ever tasted fresh tuna and we eat it often.

I'm trying to find more fish recipes I like and I loved this one!  I didn't have pineapple preserves but used crushed pineapple and a little bit of honey in its place.  Turned out great.

Very easy. Since we like our tuna steaks rare, we cooked then 2.5 minutes on each side.

Amazing.  I did not have fruit preserves, so just used a tad of honey instead.  Used the George Foreman Grill and the tuna was perfect in 1 minute flat.

The picky husband ate three servings.  The children gobbled it up.

This  is   delicious recipe  for making tuna and second time I have made it  using this recipe -we had some tuna in freezer  for many months.

 I used my own homemade jam, which was  apricot pineapple. I made as stated - the tuna was absolutely   moist & tender -served over  rice-- I added some mango to top  that I had   in freezer --  even made it  better !

First time cooking freshly caught black fin tuna steaks and satisfied with this recipe. I used 1/2 orange marmalade and 1/2 peach habanero jam instead of pineapple preserves. We need to work on how long to grill them. But overall we enjoyed the meal. Will try it again as we have a whole lot of tuna steaks in the freezer.

I made the tuna on my egg grill. The flavor was delicious. I added extra ginger and substituted orange juice for lime juice. It was light with a sweet and citrus flavor with just a little bi of kick and smoke

I liked the recipe but I tested a small piece before the guests arrived and decided that it needed salt, so I added Soy sauce to the marinade. That was a good choice.   After my second taste test, I decided it would be even better dipped into sesame seeds (after it came off the griddle) and served with a little wasabi sauce.   Make sure the grill griddle is HOT and cook for no more than 1.5 minutes a side. I used a sushi grade Tuna (Frozen) from the restaurant supply store, but, as always  "The fresher the fish, the better the fish."

Amazing marinade.  Just loved it.
It was my fist time cooking a tuna steak, and I over did it.  Hence it was too tough.  
I will try it again and keep a closer eye on them.
The marinade would be fabulous with any fish.
Thanks Kelly!
