This was amazingly good.  Mmmm....  I added more than the two T pecans, though, and mixed them into the potatoes before serving.  Next time, I'm going to try adding a little splenda, just for variety.

Noone seemed to like this recipe- it was the one thing that nobody took seconds of.  It was very bland.  Next time I'll either add Splenda or more salt.
