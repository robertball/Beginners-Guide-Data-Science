I didn't have any trouble making the dough.  I ground the almonds in small batches (about 1 - 2 handfuls at a time) in my food processor until they were very fine.  I wasn't able to get the same results grinding more almonds at once; the pieces were still too large.  I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment so I didn't have any "sticky issues" there either.  However, I think the bake time listed in the recipe is way, way, way too long.  I baked my first two batches at 325F for 12 minutes (half the recommended time!) and they ended up misshapen on the bottom...  It was almost like the middles exploded and oozed out.  I reduced the baking time to 8 minutes for my last dozen, and they were perfect.  ("Perfect" to me is completely cooked through but tender, with a light brown cookie and still-white glaze.)

The taste of these is wonderful, very light and cinnamony.  I did have some trouble working with the dough.  It was very gooey at first, so I put it in the fridge without a cover and let it set for awhile and it became much more manageable.

I am rating this very high - the cookies were fantastic. I was a little nervous to make them after reading several comments about how sticky and hard to work with the dough is. I, however, did NOT have this problem at all.

I used ground almond from the bulk barn, and didn't have any lemon zest so I just skipped that part. I added 1/4 tsp of cloves and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. 

I whipped my egg whites (2 large eggs worth) nice and fluffy for several minutes in my mixer. I added the sugar gradually, and it made this very gooey marshmallow type of stuff. I folded it into the almond/spice mixture and it was pretty crumbly looking. I popped it into the fridge while I waited for the oven and prepped my pans. (max 5 minutes). 

I found the dough easy to work with if you knead it with your hands first. I rolled it between two sheets of parchment and cut out my stars (2 sizes). The meringue glaze is very thick, but easy to paint on with a pastry brush. 

The cookies baked for 9-11 minutes, until the glaze JUST started to brown on the points of the stars. They sat on the pans for a minute or two, then went onto my cooling racks. When warm, they're crispy on the outside and wonderfully chewy on the inside. I hope they stay this delicious even after they cool. 

FANTASTIC recipe - thank you.

These cookies worked out very well. I used a smaller star cut-out and probably baked them too long, as they are very crunchy - hopefully they're a little chewier when you don't overcook them! They rolled out beautifully and taste great, although I would probably reduce the cinnamon just a little bit, and I usually like lots. My one complaint is the glaze, which browned in the oven and isn't pretty at all. Is the recipe accurate in saying you put the glaze on BEFORE baking? Next time I'll leave it off.

Scrumptious!  I ended up being short on almonds, so used 2c. ground almonds and 2/3 c. almond powder (from the asian market) - gave it a delicious ameretto flavor.  ABSOLUTELY GREASE YOUR PANS WELL, OR YOU'LL HAVE A BIG MESS.  I also found that my glaze turned brown, and I know my oven bakes on the hot side, so I made sure the oven light was off and reduced the temp and cooking time.  The last batch I cooked for 15 minutes at 315 degrees, and they were just barely starting to brown.  Has anyone else experienced the temp/time being too high/long?

These were super tasty!  I thought they tasted like the Quaker oatmeal breakfast bars.  I made them for someone I know that has a gluten allergy.  I refrigerated the dough as suggested, as it did look pretty gooey.  That seemed to work!  I used a heart shaped cookie cutter for Valentine's Day, and an 18 minute cook time seemed to be pretty good.  I don't have a gluten allergy, but will be making them again for myself!

I was not entirely impressed with this cookie.  I was trying to finding something similar to the german cinnamon star cookie and thought this would be it - however it just didnt turn out right.  The taste of this cookie was good - the lemon was a nice little surprise. However, the recipe as a whole was just not easy to work with.  I will try again.

I'd tried other Cinnamon Star recipes and was about to give up.  This one worked perfectly.

Delicious! But I wish the recipe was a little more specific on the almonds, because it did not occur to me until I started making them that I should probably be using raw almonds, not roasted salted! I put them in my food processor and they didn't come out all that fine, so I was a little worried, but not an issue! Definitely a bit too much salt, but luckily it still tastes very good! Some reviewers are saying to bake for half the time recommended in the recipe, but mine definitely needed a full 20 min. I wonder if it's the difference between using finely ground almonds/almond flour that you would buy in the store vs. grinding your own...?

An old family favorite that I could not reproduce from Mom's recipie, but this was very close! We added the cinamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of cloves into the egg mixture instead of into the nuts. Did not use any lemon zest or lemon jusice, otherwise followed the recipe and got good reviews from the family!

they are good, esp right after they are made.  they need something, may try to add vanilla next time.  Best when right out of the oven- like most cookies.

I've made this recipe for close to 30 years without the lemon juice or zest, I leave it out as I'm allergic. I always refrigerate my dough for an hour before rolling. I measure my ingredients by a scale. I put the glaze on half way through the cooking time and I bake for only 15 minutes. I also bake these at a much lower temperature only 175.

Delicious!  The lemon gives an unexpected yummmmm.  I thought the hardest part was getting all of the ground almonds worked into the meringue mixture.  When everything was finally folded in, I didn't think the dough was too sticky to work with.  I did liberally use extra powdered sugar when rolling the dough.  I found it helpful to start with a large ball of the dough, and roll it in the powdered sugar first.  Then I rolled the dough into a log shape, pressing the dough in on itself (almost like kneading, but not too much) to make sure it didn't fall apart.  At this point, you could just cut the log into slices to bake as round cookies.  Or, roll it out and cut with cookie cutters as per recipe.  I found I could "knead" the scraps from the cutouts together back into a log again, and roll out again... using powdered sugar as necessary.  The most fun of this recipe was painting on the frosting.  Again... according to the recipe, I had the perfect consistency, and a little bit more than needed to paint all the cookies.  Overall, a little labor-intensive, but so delicious they were worth the effort.  After reading several reviews, I did cut the baking time in half.  I still came out with brown meringue , but they sure taste great!  Oh... and the best part... gluten free for my dear hubby!

Mine are more lemony than cinnamon. I used the ground almond from the Bulk Barn and found the dough to be a little crumbly rather than gooey, almost like pie crust (but not greasy). However, it worked well. I was afraid of overbaking, so I may have under baked, but mine came out a bit chewy. They're definitely tasty!

I loved this recipe - It was great to have such a good gluten-free cookie! The dough did get a little sticky but still came out just fine in the end. I also tried this w/ sliced alomonds rather than ground. I had to crush them a little first, but they gave the cookies a more oatmeal cookie type texture, though w/ the larger almond peices I had to skip the cookie cutter and just press w/ a glass. I'm going to try using this recipes as a base for other gluten free cookies as well, so thank you very much for sharing!

I had a co-worker of mine bring these in and they were to die for. I can't say I've ever made these as I try, is the dough supposed to be THAT sticky before rolling ? I keep thinking I made it wrong even tho' the dough remains the same consistency no matter what version is tried....  The dough is not tough or stiff or rollable, it's all around 'marshmallow goo'...am I doing something wrong ?

I had no trouble at all with the dough. Everything turned out very well except that the baking time is way too long! I baked them for 20min and I didnt keep an eye on them so the glaze turned brown and the cookies were hard. I would recommend cutting the time by half, other than that everything was very yummy.

Easy peasy to make! The dough was a little bit sticky, but you can work with it quite well. :) The smell is heavenly! I would recommend putting them in the oven for a shorter time, like 15 minutes. I think I overbaked my first two sheets a little. Anyway, they taste very good! :) Recommend!

I did not care for this recipe. I had a difficult time with the dough. I tried chilling the dough to make it easier to work with, which helped a little. Used the recommended star cookie cutter, but when the cookies baked they lost their shape.

The dough was difficult to work with--hard to roll and to get the cookie shapes from the cookie cutters. The icing expanded when it was put on the cookies. When the cookies came out of the oven, they were extremely chewy. I will not be trying this recipe again.

Seriously difficult to work with, but the results are great.  I only have a large star cookie cutter, so I used one additional egg white and then set aside 1 cup for the topping.  I think that must have upset the ratios, because my dough was way too sticky to work with until I added a lot of extra powdered sugar.  And I still didn't have quite enough meringue for the topping.  The smell and flavor were wonderful.  I'm a little hesitant to try making them again...but the gluten-sensitive folks did appreciate it.

These are great cookies, very similar to the ones my German family used to make when I was young.  I read all the reviews and therefore baked them for only 14 minutes, which turned out well.  I bought almond flour at the Bulk Barn, so I didn't have to grind the almonds. As a result, they were relatively quick to make, especially for Christmas cookies. The frosting stayed white for me. The lemon is a nice flavour touch.  I also added a smidge of cloves and ginger. I also refrigerated the dough for a short time before rolling it, and that seemed to make it much more manageable.  The reason I gave the recipe only 4 stars is that the cookies are very sweet.  I wonder if there's a way to cut the sugar content somewhat.  Also, the almonds make the cookies quite expensive.

I read all the previous reviews before starting, since baking gluten free is new to me and I wanted to make these as flavorful and non-crumbly as possible. I bought ground almonds at the local health food store, and use local cage-free eggs (2 gave me exactly what I needed). I took the suggestion of adding 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp vanilla, leaving out the lemon juice and peel. Then I did my final mix by hand before chilling the dough overnight (2 hours should be plenty). I rolled only small amounts of the dough at a time, and ended up using bat cookie cutters because that's what I had. I baked for 8 minutes, put on the glaze, and baked for 10 more. Received rave reviews; people thought they were gingerbread.

These tasted good. I could taste more lemon than cinnamon, but it wasn't over whelming. My only complaint is the dough. I used a food processor to finely grind up the almonds. I rolled the dough but was unable to use a cookie cutter, the dough just wouldn't cooperate. They turned out yummy though. I'd like to try again to see how it goes.

Great taste! Followed recipe except baked for 1/2 the time as suggested by others. Crunchy outside, chewy inside.

From all the recipes I've tried this one is the best - BY FAR! I LOVE LOVE LOVE these stars! Yes, it is quite sticky, but I usually have to let it sit for a while anyway and that makes it just perfect! The best part though is the fact that they are GLUTEN FREE - and my husband loves them anyway, which means they must be really, really good!

Temperature was too high and the time too long.  First batch were much too crisp.  Second batch I reduced temp and still too long.  Third batch finally came out OK. Temp at 300 and baked 17 min.

This recipe was easy to follow. The cookies came out amazing! Taste: Delicious, sweet, hint of lemony. Texture: crunchy and chewy. Just be sure to not over bake the cookies, otherwise they will come out too hard.
WILL RECOMMEND! Perfect for holidays!

These are great tasting cookies!
 I may bake them a little less next time so they are softer.  Great gluten free alternative!

Love the flavor of the cookie, like others i cut my cooking time to 15 min, could have gone a couple of minutes less. I thought the recipe could have more detail. Overall, easy to make, even without a food processor, and great flavor.  Thank you for sharing.

I have just made these and they taste fab, just like zimtsterne cookies, however the White icing has cooked a little and gone brown, not stayed White. Has anyone got any tips about what I can do regarding keeping it white?  Do you think it would work if I put the icing on half way through the baking process?!

Great cookie!  Has good presentation, flavor and easy to make.  I made it for a local "Night of the Stars", which features local talent.  Perfect!
