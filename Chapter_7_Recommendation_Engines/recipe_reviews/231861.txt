Novice cooks in particular will appreciate this recipe for its simple and reliable instructions. While experienced cooks may not need these instructions, they'll nevertheless appreciate it for its delicious inspiration(as in "Oh, yeah, why didn't I think of that?").   I'm happy I came across this today for my own inspiration and to use the first of this spring's chives in my garden! This was just what I was after for our stuffed pork chops tonight, tho' I can't imagine any meat or fish entree these potatoes wouldn't complement well.

Just wanted to throw in my 2 cents.  Yes, it is a very simple recipe, but for a new cook, even the simple things can be confusing at first.  How long to boil some potatoes, how long to boil eggs, etc.  And it is a great side dish that can be amped up with extra spices like onion or garlic powder or some parsley.  A very useful recipe!

Easy Peasy, nothing difficult just a straight forward recipe that you don't really need a recipe for.

It is good to remember the simple. At the moment, all I had were gold potatoes and parsley so here is my tweaked version of the recipe: I, as someone suggested, used some garlic to add a bit of flavor. I instead boil the potatoes until soft but still firm. Then, I melted the butter in a pan and added one crushed garlic clove (use 2 if cooking for 4) and cooked it until fragant (a few seconds). Last, I added the potatoes to the pan with a tablespoon of the water I used for boiling them. I cooked it until it warmed up a bit turned the stove off and sprinkled fresh parsley. The water thickens a bit the butter so your potatoes have a tiny bit of creamyness. Do not over toss the potatoes because then you will smash them inadvertently. The trick is using minimal tossing with the spoon.

agree this is simple. but that is what's so great about it. I use garden grown chives especially for this. I add a crescent sliced onions to the boiling water @5 minutes from finish. just a great easy side dish to any meal.

We were all beginners at some point so while this recipe is simple, it serves a purpose. Very good too!

Soo simple and delish...whether you boil or steam, the end result is still delish. This recipe is on point and it's an easy recipe for even a beginning cook to try.

Chives is good on this, and so is parsley.  I find Rosemary a little strong, but I really like Thyme.

This is just good old fashioned in your own kitchen cooking. It proves simple is best. Others suggested adding garlic, rosemary and so on. I say...knock yourself out! Whatever trips your trigger. Enjoy!

I substituted a balsamic vinegar olive oil sprinkled over the potatoes for butter, used coarse sea salt, fresh ground Malabar pepper, and chives...delicious!

Cut the taters up before boiling, but otherwise followed the instructions. Very good for a simple recipe. I grew up with them, so it was a bit nostalgic, but my Yankee wife and teenage daughter loved this as well. That's good enough for me. ??

So easy and with excellent results! I used ~1 1/2 lbs of mixed, colored fingerling potatoes and dried chives that are reconstituted in water (worked great). The 15 min cooking time was spot-on. Just plain and simple with no heavy spices. Will make again!

I sauteed it a little in butter, i liked potatoes little warm. 
Nice flavor. Had it with stewed chicken and boiled peas. Nice dinner :)

Just made this for the first time, but we cut the potatoes before we boiled them and seasoned the water with salt and pepper instead of after boiling. Still an amazing recipe, even for a beginning cooker!

So simple but so flavorful. A great way to use up the plentiful crop of chives on a pot on our balcony.

This may be my favorite way to make potatoes! I’ve made it several times now & everyone always loves it! An excellent side to serve for company & holidays as well.
