These cookies are super delicious.  They made my house smell yummy.  Take note they are very fragile when they come out of the oven so let them cool on the cookie sheet and then on a wire rack.

I took this cookie to a gathering and the platter disappeared quickly. To get an uniform sized cookie use a melon baller or small ice cream scoop.  Do not flatten the cookie once it is on the cookie sheet.  It will flatten out.

Super good! I didn't have enough eggs (I doubled the recipe and only had 2 eggs) so I threw in a banana. The banana added a delicious flavor while the 2 eggs I did put in helped to maintain the delicate texture. These are crisp on the outside but they crumble in your mouth. Definitely recommend!
