These were outstanding! I took them to a church function and was asked over and over for the recipe! The only tip I would offer is...do not skip the egg wash step. I just rolled the balls in bread crumbs at first, but when I fried the first one it didn't do well. The sauerkraut sort of unraveled around the outside of the ball and tried to burn. I just dipped them in the egg/milk mixture and then back into the bread crumbs. They came out perfectly. They just seem to need the egg to hold them together well for frying. But an excellent recipe. It's easy to make and is a real crowd pleaser. This recipe is one I will reach for over and over again. Many thanks!

You've never tasted anything like this!  I was looking for a unique appetizer, and this one hit the spot.  I didn't think they were too time-consuming at all - especially after all the rave reviews!

Love the recipe. Instead of rolling them into balls I used the mixture and put inside premade eggroll wrappers and fried them. It was much cleaner than the flour egg frying and they are delish! You can dip in thousand island dressing. YUMM

These are amazing! Time consuming but so worth it. They taste exaclty like what they are... sausage and sauerkraut. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because I do not cook with salt when it is in other ingredients. I used a little more sauerkraut as my family loves it. 
The trick to these is the size too big or too small they will fall apart. I made them all meatball sized and none of them fell apart. I also dredge them in the flour, liquid and bread crumbs and let them settle and create the "shell" before frying. 
If you like sausage and sauerkraut you will not be disappointed.

They are time consuming, but if time isn't a problem, they are so worth it.  Everyone loved them.  I used thousand island dressing as a dip for them.  YUMMY!!!

Mmmm... good! Mine turned out a bit spicy as I used my homemade breakfast sausage and spiced it up - a lil heavy on the cayenne I think! I used my homemade sauerkraut chopped finely in a processor and was a little bit short of the 2 c. (probably @ 1.5 c. before chopping) so not a heavy kraut flavor; great for my BF as he doesn't even LIKE kraut and had no idea it was in them until I told. I have never understood the flour, egg, crumb steps but, my friend, it works so well on anything I have ever breaded and deep fried I don't question it.   The only thing I really changed was to use garlic cloves sauteed with the pork mixture (as I felt it had enough salt in the pork) and half cream cheese and half mozzarella (which I had INTENDED to be Swiss.) I will try these again with 1/2 cream and 1/2 Swiss. They held their shape frying but crumbled when cutting so perhaps an egg added into the pork mix? Or be less impatient and make them 1" bite size per instructions! (My deep fryer is really tiny.)Also baking would be healthier but I really liked the extra crisp crunch.

Followed recipe exactly. It kept falling apart when trying to form into balls.  Had to fill sink with ice water to help.  Made a dip with avocado and ranch dressing, but it didn't help.

I made these for a work party for the holidays and received rave reviews.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is SO time consuming.  I made these over a 2-day period.  Also, I wouldn't make them again without a deep-fryer.  I used a deep pan on the top of the stove and got splashed with the hot oil quite a bit.  Overall - very tasty!

These were great with a couple of changes. The dried beef is SO salty that the addition of garlic salt would have ruined them. Use garlic powder or fresh garlic instead. There is so much great flavor going on in the inside that plain bread crumbs work just fine if not better too. These were a little time consuming and made a huge mess but very much worth it!
