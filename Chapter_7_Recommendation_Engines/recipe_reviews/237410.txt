J.Storm - No, it is not the same thing.  Neufchatel tates extremely similar to cream cheese, however is has 1/3 less fat that cream cheese.  REAL (see also - French) Neufchatel is made with milk only, while the American version you find in grocery stores is generally made with milk and cream.  As far as the recipe goes - I've been making this dip for a long time.  As written, I give this recipe 3 stars as it is very good.  I always add some seasoning such as garlic or onion powder, white pepper, and even a dash of Worchestershire sauce if I'm feeling really adventurous.

Used fresh jalapeños from the garden, added bacon and a splash of Worcestershire. Delicious!

This is always a party favorite. I actually have only made this with cream cheese and I may try it with the Neufchâtel because it is very rich anyway.  It's a very flexible recipe. You can use different cheese and can add bacon, which is delicious of course.

I used only fresh jalapenos and diced Hungarian peppers. Was a big hit.

Nothing fancy, but oh so good! Ps. I had been using regular cream cheese for a while, and today I used the Neufchatel, which took it to a whole new level!

I'm pregnant and crave jalapeno poppers nonstop. Unfortunately, I only eat all natural foods, so going and getting some at Sonic wasn't an option. I didn't have parmesan cheese on hand and I made it without it. Baked at 400 degrees until heated through. This dip saved my life today! I get all natural mayo at Trader Joes. It exists!
