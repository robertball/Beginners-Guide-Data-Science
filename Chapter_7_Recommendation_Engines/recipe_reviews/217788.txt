My husband loves rack of lamb so I chose this recipe for Father's Day. Unfortunately, there were no racks at the supermarket so I made do with some very nice lamb chops instead. The marinade was simple and a very bright tasting barbecue sauce. The cooking instructions were way off for the onion lollipops though. I should have listened to my own cooking instincts and cooked them over INDIRECT heat for the stated time. My first batch of onions burned within five minutes of hitting the grill. Easily put more together and made a new batch.I had to adjust the cooking time for medium rare chops too. All in all a good barbecues lamb recipe. I would like to try this with a boneless leg of lamb on the rotisserie some time. Thanks for the tasty recipe.

Followed the recipe almost, with the exception of the apple cider vinegar.  thought I had it, but substituted red wine vinegar, instead.

OMG. I normally have made lamb, in the oven.  This is the best lamb recipe I have used and it came out PERFECT.  Wasn't the least bit oily or greasy.  The meat was flavorful and the marinade & BBQ took the "weird taste" and odor, I have had with lamb.  With the 10 minute wait, to let it rest.  I was preparing additional vegetables, in parallel and everything came together in the end.

my sister didn't have a grill so I baked them at 250Â°. My lamb wasn't a rack, I had riblets. I chopped the red onions and laid them at the bottom of the pan. I mixed the ingredients together and put them on top of the onions.  DELICIOUS

Super easy and delicious.   I marinated the meat for the afternoon.  The flavor was wonderful and the red onion adds a nice added flavour.  Will definitely make again and again.

This was excellent!! I made it as posted and was very pleased with the sauce. It would be excellent on other meats as well.

I'm Greek, this is the best rack I've EVER had. I only had one rack for the recipe, so I made 1/2 the marinade & kept the rack in it for about 2 hours.
I shorted the ketchup to about 1/3 cup because the thought of it on my lamb was too disturbing.
I will absolutely use this again & my Very Greek Mother can't wait for Easter!

We used dry spices but hubby and I found this absolutely delicious.  The only thing we didn't do was the onions... I found that part of the recipe to be lacking description.  Were you supposed to put the lamb ON it to grill, or is it a side?  Anyway, it was great without it.
