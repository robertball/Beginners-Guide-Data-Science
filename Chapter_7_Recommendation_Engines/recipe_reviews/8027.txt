This recipe is inaccurate. Do not leave the cake in the oven for 50-60 minutes. I found that 40 minutes was sufficient however the outside of the cake was too crispy and brown while the inside was too soft. Also the amount of frosting in the recipe is too little for a layer cake. It also takes too long for its worth. This cake tastes okay but doesn't taste very good after all the time you spend making it. I wouldn't make this cake again.
