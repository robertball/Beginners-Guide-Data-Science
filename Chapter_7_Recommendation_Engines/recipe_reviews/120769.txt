Despite the fact that I - 1)misread the recipe and used a tube pan instead of a fluted pan and 2) increased the recipe and had to finish it in the microwave because it was mushy -it still tasted fantastic! Everyone loved it! I can't wait to try again with the correct pan and proportions. One tip: put the brown sugar mixture in a plastic bag and shake the buttered dough in it for easier clean up.

I altered this , but only a little! First, I let my 5 yr old stepdaughter help by giving her a pizza cutter and told her to 'make an X to cut the biscuits.' I didn't even have to help her. Then I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 t. and decreased the nutmeg to 1/2 t. I put the sugar mixture in a bowl with a fitted lid, we dunked the biscuit pieces in butter, put them in the bowl, covered it and shook it. Worked pretty slick. When all the biscuit peices were in the 8x8 glass baking dish, I added the leftover sugar mixture and the syrup to the melted butter and drizzled it over the top. This stuff was like a drug---couldn't keep our hands off it-- and made the house smell heavenly!!!

I didn't have a fluted pan, so I just used a regular oval casserole pan.  Otherwise I made it according to directions and it is YUMMY!

This recipe was wonderful and so easy!!!  I also used a large ziploc bag to toss the cinnamon sugar mixture with.  Made for easier cleanup.  Also, I used the biscuits that have "flaky layers" and it made it even more delicious!  Everyone raved about it and it was so easy!!  I'll definately be making this one again! Thanks for the recipe!

VERY GOOD!  I used a pizza wheel to cut the dough and a zip lock bag to coat it.  It was a little harder to do because it was brown sugar not granular sugar but it made cleanup a breeze.  I added sweetened dried cranberries and used chopped walnuts.  Since I didn't have any maple syrup, I substituted dark Karo corn syrup.  When I inverted the pan, all the syrup seemed to run into the dish.  I wasn't sure this was going to be a success.  As it cooled down it became a delightful sticky dessert worthy of it's 5 stars!  Thank you Charlene Wilson for sharing your recipe.

My husband picked at this all day long, he couldn't leave it alone! This would be perfect for a brunch.  I added raisins and a diced apple.

This is a dessert that I made with my 9 yr. old son. It is such a simple yummy recipe that he was able to help with almost everything.  We also put the sugar mixture in a large ziploc as it is so much easier than trying to roll the buttered pieces of bisciut in it.  The only change I will make for the next batch is to use 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon only use 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg as the nutmeg was a little overpowering.  The maple syrup really gave it a great flavor addition to a pretty basic recipe!  We will definitely make this again!

Very good! I used pecans. I agree with the suggestion to put sugar mixture in a bag and add dough pieces otherwise it's a little messy.

Really good.  My change is nothing with the ingredients but with how you put it in the pan.  I mixed the butter & syrup and put 1/2 into the pan.  Then mixed brown sugar, spices & nuts together & put 1/2 of this mixture on top of the syrup mixture.  I did not cut the biscuits but split them into the biscuit pieces & put them into the pan at an angle around the pan.  Poured the rest of the syrup mixture & the the rest of the brown sugar mixture on top.  Baked. Let sit for just a couple of minutes.   Turned over to lots of syrupy delicious-ness!!

Simple recipe that was easy and delicious on Christmas morning. Fed five adults and one child. Baked it in a bundt pan and it stayed to form once on a plate. Will definitely make again!

"Super Triple Awesome All Stars" is what one of my sons had to say about this simple recipe.  My 8 year old made it with my guidance and we all enjoyed it.  We used more nuts than called for and next time we'll add raisins.  I used bread dough, as it's what we had.

Totally fool proof.  I used GRANDS bisuits and separated them in half by splitting the layers, then used kitchen shears to snip them in half.  Cooked for full 30 minutes.  AWESOME!  Thanks!

Definnitey a hit in my household! The maple syrup really makes it nice and gooey (use real maple syrup...not pancake syrup...it's a lot less sweet).  It definitely needs to cook longer than 25-30 minutes.  I had to cook it for about 45 minutes.  IT'S A KEEPER!!!

We cooked longer than it said, but this was so delicious.  Half was gone in first 5 minutes!  First time making monkey bread, so was very surprised at how easy it was!  Thank you for great recipe!

This was awesome.  I only had tubes of crescent rolls, so  I laid one sheet of dough over the other and cut it into squares with a pizza cutter. Then I  rolled the squares into balls before dipping them into the butter. It turned out great.  I made it for a family event, so I didn't get to eat as much of it as I would have liked.  Can't wait to make it again.

I use 3/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white. I have also found that using pre-cut pieces of dough is less time consuming and often produces a better result (Bridgford makes a wonderful product that comes in a bag of small dough pieces that are perfect for this treat). Also, instead of dipping the dough in butter first, I roll each piece separately in a glaze (that I prepare separately in a small saucepan using the butter, both sugars and cinnamon [and nutmeg if you prefer]) to make sure all are coated equally before placing them in a fluted pan that I line with a bit of cooking spray and 1 pkg. cook&serve butterscotch pudding. I have tried many variations of this recipe using canned biscuits, etc. over the years, but have never had much success until I switched the recipe up a bit after discovering Bridgford brand products. Each time I have prepared it, I have had great success with a sweet treat that everyone loves and cannot wait for me to make again!

On average, this last for about 15 minutes from the moment I turn it out onto the plate until that same plate is empty. My family of two boys and a husband start circling the kitchen when they see me making this! I leave the nuts out since my son has a nut alergy, but other than that I prepare it excatly as written. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe according to the directions, but found I needed to make more of the brown sugar mixture half way through. I also added bacon to the layers before pouring the syrup over the top.
Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Pretty good, the maple syrup coating gets a little chewy, but really easy and quick to make.

Yum! If you are thinking about losing weight, please click away. I didn't use the maple syrup or nut because I didn't have any on hand, but it came out good. The only tricky things are removing it, or flipping it over. Also make sure it's cooked all the way!

I have to say I am really disappointed in this recipe. The pieces did not cook all the way in the middle and they are not sweet! Even with all that sugar...really hard to take at 7am on a Saturday. Total cooking FAIL

Delish!  I may have added too much syrup because mine did not invert well.  It had way too much liquid on the bottom.  It was still sooooo good though.  I was only serving 3 people so I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 in square pan.  We ate every bite of it.

Even though I am not a huge fan of Monkey Bread, it was really good! The kids in my class loved it as well as all the other teachers who could steal a bite. Even my fiancé enjoyed it when I did my test bake at home. I will make this again.

Very tasty.  The 2nd time I made it, I decreased the maple syrup to 1/4 cup and I liked it better.   With 1/2 cup you end up with a pool of (expensive!) syrup on the plate.

I had a large can of Grands biscuits pop open on the way home from the grocery store today and really wasn't planning on biscuits for dinner, so I decided to try this recipe...WOW, WOW, WOW! This is awesome! Definitely not health food, but sure is comfort food! I used molassas in place of the syrup since I didn't have any. This made it very dark-almost burnt looking. I baked it in an 8x8 baking dish. Had a little trouble inverting it onto a serving plate, but no trouble at all eating it. =D

I made this recipe for my family on Christmas morning and everyone loved it!  It was easy to make and so warm and gooey to eat, perfect with sausage and scrambled eggs.  I'll certainly make it again.

This is a great recipe!! Its so easy a monkey can do it ;]

One piece of advice for anyone trying it... make sure that its in for the full time or that its fully baked. I got the timing wrong and when I took it out and flipped it it all came apart. I was able to get it all back in the flute pan, and then bake it for another 10 mins and it was just perfect!!

This was pretty good considering how unattractive it was, sopping it what was obviously maple syrup. I was honestly really embarrassed by how it looked, but the taste made up for it and everyone loved it. Next time, though, I'm cutting WAY down on the syrup.

Absolutely fabulous!  I made half the recipe, used 100% maple syrup and added in raisins.  More like sticky buns than traditional Monkey Bread.  It got rave reviews!

This was very delicious and easy!!  I prepared it the night before and kept in fridge since we were helping some friends move the next morning and wanted something that could bake without needing much attention.  The only thing I did different was not add the syrup as we don't keep Maple Syrup in the house.  I did pour the leftover butter and cinnamon mixture on top before baking and it was good!  I made a confectioners sugar glaze to top the bread with and it was just like cinnamon rolls with a lot less work!  This one was a keeper with hubby!  Thanks for a great recipe

I made this to take to the hairdresser's for my saturday's appointment.  I could not get in the door good when everyone there just had to have some.  It was a hit and easy to make served with coffee it made the early morning hair appointment a lot easier to take.

Awesome version of Monkey bread.  Was able to use up some biscuits in the refridge that were about to expire.  Unlike my other monkey bread recipe that you have to make the night before (with frozen roll dough), this one you can make the same morning.

Awesome! Very easy (very messy). I made this with the help of my 7 and 5.5 year old girls. We put the sugar mixture in ziploc bags and they shook the pieces in there. We put the covered biscuits in an 8x8 glass baking dish and drizzled the remaining ingredients over the top, and drizzled maple syrup.  DELISH!

This is the BEST monkey Bread recipe by far! We have tried a few others and this one is more like caramel cinnamon rolls gooey and yummy- we do let it bake a bit longer or it is soggy so you just have to watch it- but so good!!!

Try using only 1/4 cup butter and go ahead and use karo syrup. Pour the extra cinnamon sugar and butter into the pan over the bread.

Delisious & simple. Can't go wrong! I used a big ziplock, as others suggested, to coat in the brown sugar mix. It took a couple minutes longer to bake than suggested, but other than that the recipe was perfect!

I come from the "making it from scratch is ALWAYS better" school of thought, but this recipe is proof that sometimes those shortcuts such as premade dough can produce equal results.   Even if I have the extra time, I don't think I will change this one to homemade dough ever!  The results were that good. I have made it twice.. once using the round fluted bundt pan, and the cooking time was perfect. The second time, it was for a class project, so I doubled it and put in a 9 x 13 pan.   I also singed it and placed in a 8 x8 pan.  Both pans required significantly more baking time.   In fact, after 10 minutes of extra baking (covering with foil to prevent too much browning), it was still a little doughy in the middle.    In desperation of getting it to school on time, I flipped it out of the pan onto the serving platter, put back in the oven at 425 for about 7 minutes, and VIOLA... a firm, sweet (almost crunchy) coating on top.  Even better than the original!    We added diced granny smith apples and they added a pleasing flavor to the mix.  This one will go in my recipe "keeper" file for sure.

Great flavor but undercooked! I actually used a ceramic monkey bread baking mold but between the syrup, brown sugar & butter, this came out a soupy mess.  I finally cooked it 45 minutes to be palatable.  I'd like to try this again and omit the syrup.

This was the quickest, easiest, most delicious breakfast pastry ever.  My 15 y/o nephew helped me by cutting and dipping in the butter.  OMGoodness!!  Simply wonderful and simply simple.  WILL make again soon!

I had trouble getting the biscuits done on the bottom. Would have tasted great otherwise.

I usually follow the Williams/Sonoma recipe, but I wanted to get Monkey Bread on the table quickly tonight, this method is 100 times quicker and yielded a great snack for my family. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was really good and really easy!  I didn't have maple syrup on hand when I made it, so I substituted molasses and it still turned out GREAT!!!

Excellent monkey bread recipe! The maple syrup made it like a huge cinnamon bun. Went very quickly! I made one with chopped walnuts and one without, could go either way.

The only change I made was that I used a loaf pan because I don't have a bundt pan.  I took out of oven after 27 min. and it completely fell apart and the biscuits were still super doughy.  I put the biscuit pieces back in the pan and covered with the syrup/nuts that had spilled out onto the dish.  I had to put in the oven for another 20 min. before the biscuits were cooked through.  I still gave 4 stars because the end result was really good and this recipes is super simple....I think the problem was that my apartment's oven is crappy.

I tried this recipe today/on Christmas morning and it turned out great. I will make this again.  I used a pizza cutter to cut bisuits in quarters. I also put brown sugar/cinamin mixture in a ziplock bag. Baked for 25 minutes and turned out great.

My first time eating and making monkey bread! I used real maple syrup, 1 1/2 t cinnamon, and 1 t nutmeg. Delicious, but I'm trying not too eat it all because it's real fattening

Delicious! I've been eyeing the various Monkey Bread recipes and decided to try this one first as I like the idea of brown sugar as well as the addition of nutmeg, which I thought added great flavor.  I started by tossing the dough pieces in a large ziploc bag, but after a while the butter and sugar combined to make a mess, sticking to the inside of the bag - I finished it in a bowl and thought that was just easier.  Also, I ended up needing to use a bit more sugar.  I used pecans for the nuts.  This was a great recipe to make with my almost four-year old - she cut the biscuits with a butter knife and had fun tossing the dough in the sugar.  With a little one around, it was as messy to make as it is to eat, but nonetheless fun!  Thanks for sharing!
