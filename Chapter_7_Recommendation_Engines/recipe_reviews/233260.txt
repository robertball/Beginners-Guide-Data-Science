Even the snobbiest of shortbread snobs loved these when I made them. The only changes I made were using 1/2 cup cornstarch instead of 1 cup, and 3 1/2 cups of flour instead of 3 cups. Also knocking the temperature down to 325Â°F gave them a nice and soft but crumbly texture. Thanks!

I made a half recipe which was quite plenty. I followed the recipe  but didn't have a cookie press. I rolled into 1 Tbs balls and gently pressed with the back of the spoon.  The dough was kind of crumbly but held together when compressed.  They taste great and were pretty quick to make.

Looked good but had a weird aftertaste. My husband liked and that's all that mattered to me. I was making them for him.   I added a Hershey's Kiss to top of each one.

It turned out more like a sugar cookie than a traditional shortbread. Paul Hollywood was unimpressed.

these were a big hit. Loved the ease of the recipe and the resulting smiles on my family faces when they ate them

great taste but the 350 oven did not seem hot enough. I cooked the second batch at 375 as the first batch was not cooked through even after 10 min.  Have a thermometer in stove so it wasn't a problem with my oven. Second batch was awesome!
