OH my God, this is wonderful! My husband's family is from the Azores, Terceira to be specific, and settled in Tulare, Hanford area. His father would use Vina Dosh marinade for rabbit and chicken. Unfortunately he passed away and so did the recipe. When I tried this and my husband ate it, he was so happy. He said it is as close as I could possibly get, I am sure a different wine would make a different taste, but this is the real deal. THANK YOU SO MUCH CALI-CHEF. Also, I have a portuguese beans recipe I submitted that will be perfect with these, if Allrecipes doesn't post it, find it on justapinch.com Thanks again !

Very close to my mom's. She passed before I was able to learn her secrets. I added potatoes like she did. It was always my favorite because we're Portuguese from Hawaii, so all of our meals included rice. I rarely got potatoes! Will make it again!

This is a very tasty dish! Next time I would decrease the red wine vinegar. It was just a little too vinegary for our taste. But very easy to make and we enjoyed it very much.

This was wonderful-tender and delicious. I used country boneless pork ribs instead of the pork shoulder, and it came out great. This is one of the few recipes I followed exactly as written. Wouldn't change a thing.

I had a small bone in pork shoulder.  I marinated it for 3 days.  Then cut the bone out and marinated the cut up pork for a few more hours.  Followed the recipe the rest of the way and served it with herbed egg noodles.

oh my Gosh Thank you for sharing this! I couldn't get a hold of my dad who is also from the Azores to get the recipe so I thought I would take a shot at looking it up on the internet and Bam there this was!  I have grown up with this and pretty much knew the ingredients but wasn't quite sure. I was craving this so bad!

I was intrigued by this recipe because we have the same Christmas tradition!  Portuguese Vinhodalos!  We use white vinegar, no wine and add salt.  I was expecting 13 people for dinner and had purchased some beautiful pork steaks for our main dish.  When I found this recipe I squealed with delight!  The only exception that I made was adding some Hawaiian salt.  Marinated those steaks for 4 days and grilled them on the outdoor barbecue.  The result was CHRISTMAS IN APRIL!!  Thank you for sharing your version!  By the way, some people call this Vengadalsh too.  Depends on where the Portuguese grandmother was raised.  Thanks again!

Our cooking class in Portugal taught me that marinating pork can have delicious results. Enjoy!

This was just too strong on the vinegar in my opinion. I am Portuguese and I hear the stronger vinegar flavor is more of an Azores thing...a different regional taste preference I guess.

This is wonderful.  I did not change a thing.   It has been years since I have had this and it did not disappoint at all.  My only regret is that I did not double the recipe.  Will make it over and over again!

This was not good at all. I have made dozens of recipes from Allrecipes and until now, each was a 4 or 5 star.  Except for cooking the pork less time than called for, I followed the recipe exactly. The pork was dry, over-cooked, and not tender. If I were to try this recipe again (and I probably won't), I would cook for even a shorter amount of time and find some sauce to pour over then pork.
