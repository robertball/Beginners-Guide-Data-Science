Still fairly new to baking with rice flour, but I had a a lot that needed to be used so I tried my hand at this. I also had some plain low-fat yogurt to use up, so I subbed it for the milk. I used some leftover cream cheese frosting on top of the cupcakes. Added a few almonds to half of the batch in the last five or so minutes of baking. Could have been a tad more moist, but I still thoroughly enjoyed them.

5-star flavor for sure. The only issue I had was that they are very dry. The recipe is spot on though. Exactly three Tbsp of batter per muffin (I used an ice cream scooper) and exactly 18 minutes in the oven. I followed the ingredients perfectly. I sifted the dry ingredients twice before adding to the butter/sugar mixture. Next time, I'll add an extra egg. My husband thought they were too spicy but I thought they were fine. I'm even considering adding a pinch more cayenne next time. If you don't care for things too spicy, I suggest you reduce the amount written. Thank you for the recipe.
