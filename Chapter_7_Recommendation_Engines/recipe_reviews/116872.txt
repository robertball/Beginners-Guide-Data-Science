My homemade salsa is good, but this salsa is great (and a little faster to make)! I used canned "fire roasted" tomatoes, which added a smoky flavor to the salsa.  Yummy!

I doubled this recipe. I did not have whole tomatoes, I used two cans organic diced tomatoes. I did use canned jalapeno only because I don't keep fresh on hand. After running the ingredients through the blender, I folded in an additional 1/4 cup or so more minced cilantro. VERY easy. This recipe doubled filled one quart Ball jar to the top. I normally add brown sugar to homemade salsa but the cider vinegar gave it a little sweet-tang that I really liked. Next time, I would increase the garlic, just for my own personal taste liking. NOTE: The longer this salsa sits, the better it gets.

Wow! Now, this is some really good salsa! I've been searching for a really good salsa recipe and I think I've finally found it. I used a 14.5 oz. can of fire roasted tomatoes, 2 tsp. of cider vinegar, 2 tsp. of fresh lime juice, 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar, 1/2 tsp. of salt, and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I put this into my mini food processor and let it go.... I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend and this is now my "go to" salsa recipe. My brother and his girlfriend devoured the stuff and said it was better than Chili's!

5+ Stars!  My 16 year old had to put together some homemade salsa at the last minute and we had all the ingredients (except used petite diced tomatoes, 3 jalapenos and red wine vinegar instead of the cider).  I thought it'd be decent but it actually blew us away!  Let it chill overnight, WOW!  Will never buy store salsa again.  :)

Super good! I used diced, fire roasted tomatoes with green chiles from Trader Joe's. I was curious about the vinegar so I divided the salsa and tried lime on one half and apple  cider on the other. Definitely preferred the lime.

Wow, I thought I loved my local Mexican restaurant's salsa but this definitely rivals theirs.  I never thought to use canned tomatoes for a fresh tasting salsa but this works so well it will be my go to for fresh salsa.  I did add an extra 1/2 tsp salt.

I love this stuff. Even though you are using canned tomatoes, it has such a fresh taste unlike the stuff you get in jars at the grocery store. I prefer a chunky salsa so i hand chop everything. Be careful...this is addictive.

This is a great tasting salsa.  The proportions are right on; however, cider vinegar is inauthentic and, unfortunately, gives the salsa a bit of a strange taste, especially after sitting overnight in the fridge.  When I first made it, I could really taste the cumin while hardly tasting the vinegar.  But, like I said, after sitting overnight, the cumin blended nicely while the vinegar taste stood out too much.  That said, I will definitely make this salsa again but next time I will use lime juice instead of vinegar.  Thanks for posting.  It really showed me how important proportions are when making salsa.

EXCELLENT salsa! I doubled the recipe using 1/2 fire roasted tomatoes and 1/2 regular whole tomatoes. I chose to use only the ONE jalapeno for a MILD salsa since I don't like too much heat. I also added 1 tbsp of fresh squeezed lime juice. 
This is  fabulously fresh & deliscious salsa recipe. Highly reccommend! =)

I was hoping to find a recipe just like my favorite Mexican restaurant. While the technique was perfect, all I could taste were cumin and vinegar. I made it a second time with half the cumin and lime juice instead and it was wonderful. Thanks for such a great foundation to build from!

So good & so fast! I was looking for a salsa recipe that I could make without lemon/lime juice since I didn't have any at home, so this was perfect. I just used 1 little yellow onion instead of 1/2 red + 1/2 yellow. I also didn't have cider vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar. This is better than some of the other recipes i've tried from this site.

Great salsa!! I forgot to add salt and was going to stir it in, but decided it didn't need it after tasting it. Used 1/2 T. cider vinegar and juice of half a lime. You might be surprised at my secret ingredient until you taste the result -- squeeze in the juice of about 1/4 of an orange (for this amount of salsa). Learned this hint from a local Mexican joint that has the BEST salsa I've ever tasted.

I'm giving this five stars with this proviso:  use fresh tomatoes and hand chop all ingredients.  The fresh tomatoes and fresh cilantro put this over the top.  With canned tomatoes, I'd only give it four stars.  This is too tasty and has a whole variety of uses, from dips to burritos to whatever else you'd use salsa for.

Ok i was pleasantly surprised by this. I won't buy salsa from the store. Sams club sells a salsa from a local resturant that i usually keep on hand. Decided to try this and liked it. Idid't use red onion only white and no vinegar. Did use some fresh lime juice and kept seeds in jalepeno, gave it just enough heat. Used more cilantro because i like it. Put in blender because i like smoother consistency. Thanks very simple and easy to make. Really didn't think i would like with canned tomatoes thanks for proving me wrong

Made this tonight to go with our dinner.  I've been trying to find a salsa recipe both my husband and I really like and I think it's a done deal.  Had a few tomatoes from my garden to use so I just reduced the canned tomatoes by half and only had a white onion.  Very tasty!

this was a great recipe and had lots of flavor. i like my salsa chunkier though so next time im going to just chop it a little finer and mix it all in a bowl. i found it just a little too mild for my taste so i added a bit more purple onion and 1/2 an extra jalapeno pepper and it was nice and spicy! i also excluded the cilantro because my sister is allergic and it didnt make any difference

Very easy, very fast, and very good. The recipe is very basic and a keeper. It is easy to make adjustments to suit your family.  I use canned diced tomatoes, two jalapenos, whatever onions I happen to have.

This is the perfect salsa because it can be tweaked so well.  We like cilantro, so I use the whole bunch of cilantro leaves, 2 jalapenos - I remove the seeds and membrane, which is where the heat comes from , from 1 of the peppers, which leaves it plenty hot. I too used lime juice instead of vinegar. I also didn't drain the tomatoes.  This time I was out of cumin, so had to leave it out.  Still turned out great.  One other thing - if you are putting this into your food processor, you do not need to chop or mince anything.  I processed everthing but the tomatoes, added them last, pulsed it until they were just blended in but still chunky.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!  I used 2 large fresh tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes.  I also split up the recipe at the end and added sweet corn to half of the recipe.  This helped make it a bit sweeter and milder.  It's VERY frest, yummy, and easy!

This was so simple and quick to make. I used a bit less onion than recommended. The next time I make this I think I'll chop everything in the processor a little first before adding the tomatoes. To get the consistency I wanted with the rest of the ingredients the tomatoes became a little smoother than I would have liked. This is a definite make again though. Thanks Sarah.

Excellent & easy. I adjusted the spices to my families tastes. We love cilantro & I have a bunch of it so I put way more in. Didn't have the white onion so I used more red. Used lime, but still added a bit of the apple cider vinegar. Really good!

REALLY GOOD!!! I followed the recipe EXACTLY for the first batch. My next batch will double the cilantro and the garlic and will add 1 TBSP of fresh lime juice. I used tomatoes from my garden. After washing them I froze them in a ziplock bag. When I was ready to make the salsa I ran each under hot water and the skin came right off!!! Neat tip!!!

Made this Salsa to go with the appetizer Tortilla scoop chips at our cookout. Everyone loved it and said I have to always make it now. I used double everything to make double the salsa. Had a little bit left over so the next morning I made Salsa Omlets. They were good too! I used Fresh Tomatos.

THIS RECIPE IS SOOOOOO GOOD, AND SOOOOOO EASY!!!  I have made it for parties and for friends.  They all love it.  Great balanced flavor.  Instead of using canned whole tomatoes, I use canned diced tomatoes and hit it briefly with my immersion blender.

Finally, we have a winner! Next time try 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of 1/4, and split the cider with fresh lime juice.

I made this salsa for a cookout. I originally doubled the recipe (but still only used one jalapeno because i didn't want it to be too spicy for some - it was perfect), but after just 30 minutes of it being on the table it was almost gone. I ended up having to quickly whip up another double batch. Everyone asked to go home with the recipe. Will definitely make this over and over again!

I have used this recipe several times.  It's excellent, however, instead of cutting up those expensive tomatoes, I use a can of petite chopped tomatoes.  Also I do not put the can of tomatoes in the food processor either, I add them to the bowl at the last minute.

Good salsa.  I would not use more than 1/2 tsp of cumin.  This was too much.  I doubled the cilantro.  I will make it again.

I made this salsa two days in a row it was so delicious and so, so easy!   The first time I made it a followed the recipe exactly and the second time I used fire roasted tomatoes (diced) and added the juice of one lime.   Both ways were fantastic and I can't really say I liked one better than the other, but without the lime it has a slightly stronger taste.   I will be making this again and again.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good basic salsa. I added the juice of half a lime as well as the vinegar(and I only had balsamic but no big difference) and ooh la la, that was a good decision. It adds to the fresh taste. Chopped cilantro also kicks it up in freshness and taste. I only had serrano and habanero peppers in the fridge, so I used serrano. Another great flavour, and not any hotter than hot jalapenos.

Yummy stuff. I doubled the recipe, added lime juice instead of vinegar, and omitted the cumin since I added one chipotle pepper and about a tsp of adobo sauce which made it plenty smokey and spicy enough for us. We loved this!!! *UPDATE* Made this a second time tonight (thought it was new to me, lol) added the cumin a bit of chili powder and lime juice instead of the vinegar its a perfect salsa if all you have is canned tomatos!!! I always throw my salsa's in the food processor simply because we prefer a smoother type salsa.  I will make it again, obviously, lol!!!

LOVE this salsa!  I don't love salsas that are like a big chunky salad on a chip - this is the one I've been looking for!  I added a can of Hot Rotel after I blended the ingredients.  Chilling overnight makes all the difference.  Also just make a batch with a chopped Habanero and 1/2 ripe mango.  TO DIE.

Great salsa! I took the advice of others and added 1 TBSP of lime juice, cut the Cumin in half, cut the vinegar in half and kept in one half of the seeds from the jalapeno to add a little more heat. Too much Cumin would have been way too spicy. I'd rather have my heat come from the jalapeno seeds. :-) Thanks for this great recipe!

I came across this recipe exactly 15 days ago, and since then, I have made this salsa 4 times!!!  I consider myself a bit of a salsa connoisseur, and I honestly think this may be the best salsa I've ever had!!!  I was hesitant to use canned tomatoes, but it worked wonderfully.  The salsa tastes so fresh!  I did cut back slightly on the onion, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Trust me, you will become addicted!   p.s.  The cumin and vinegar are key!  Don't skip these ingredients!

This is super good & very easy to make! I don't like my salsa chunky, so I ran my through the processor a little longer & I added a little extra garlic.  I used fire roasted diced tomatoes w/ garlic, fresh squeezed lime instead of vinegar & I also used canned jalapeno peppers. Can't wait for my hubby to get home to share it with him...

My husband has been the master salsa maker for years.  Now I am after making this recipe and tweaking it a bit.  I added some lime juice and a bit of olive oil as some receipes call for.  The real enhancement was the 3 poblano peppers I roasted, peeled and chopped up and added.  It was fabulous and even my husband could not get enough.

I made it , the 1st batch, just like the recipe said and it was very good.  I love lime so I used it on the 2nd batch instead of the vinegar and it was also, very good.  The 3rd batch, I used lime and added one roasted green chili, that gave it a little more kick.  My husband suggested adding 1/2 C. tomato sauce, so I did on his (4th batch) which was the original recipe, with that as the only variation.  He thought that was the best.  I had another jalapeno, so I made the 5th batch using lime, one green chili and 1/2 C. tomato sauce to the regular recipe.  They were all good!  Tomorrow we will try them out on our relatives and get their reactions.  I forgot to mention my brother gave me a case of fresh tomatoes, lol!  Also, I seeded the tomatoes as well as the jalapenos for some family members diet restrictions, FYI.

I also added chopped avocados and a tablespoon of lime juice after I emptied all of it from the food processor. I am going to make this again.

I made one batch of this today for two 2 year olds and two 9 year olds.  They all LOVED it (including me!)  The older two said they would like it a little spicier.  I loved it just the way it was.  I did, however, add lime juice (and reduced the vinegar.)  I used fresh tomatoes (didn't peel them.)  I used cilantro from my garden, but it was actually the stalks and skinny leaves from the flowers, still tastes like cilantro, so why not?  I don't have the leafy kind anymore, my plants have bolted and gone to seed.

The cumin was a LITTLE overwhelming, but still delicious.  I think after melding for awhile, this is going to be my favorite salsa!  (I made it too runny, so next time I'll keep it chunkier and I definitely won't be going back to buying jars of salsa!)

I love this recipe - I make it all the time.
Instead of Cumin I use a tex-mex seasoning by Clubhouse and also use rice vinegar and add some chipotle hot sauce and some scotch bonnet hot sauce because I like spice.
I've been asked for the recipe several times!

It's good, but a little too much cumin for my taste.  It could also use fresh lime, as other reviewers have added.  I made it without lime because I didn't have any.  When I make this again, I will probably use half the cumin or none at all.  I also used 1/2 large yellow onion (no red) and white vinegar.  After all that, I found I still had to doctor it a little (used balsamic vinegar & more cilantro).  All in all, it's decent and worth trying again.

My husband enjoys making salsa from scratch. He tried this receipe which was similar to what he uses from scratch. The cumin and cider vinegar were new ingredients. They both put a slightly different spin to the usual salsa he makes.

LOOOOOOOOVE this recipe!!!!  Everyone who tries it falls in love.  I only use this salsa when I am making mexican food.  You can use diced tomatoes (drained) too if you don't have whole.  The only change I make is using lime instead of vinegar and if you don't have a red onion on hand, it is still amazing using just yellow or white.

This was pretty good. I think I added way too much cilantro. Next time I will start with a very small amount and work my way up. I only used one jalapeno with seeds and all. Next time I might try two :) Very tasty, I will try to make this again :)

The salsa is very good!  It is definitely a base that can be altered to satisfy anyone's taste. I think next time I may add a bit of lime juice, a little hot sauce, drained black beans, sweet corn kernels, and maybe a tiny bit of sugar or crushed pineapple to break up some of the heat and acidity.  I love how quick it is to put together and how versatile it is!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Good heat, nice flavor.  I used diced fire roasted tomatoes for a little extra flavor.

I made this tonight and it was SO wonderful that I was back at the grocery store to buy more so I could quadruple the quantity.  I left out the jalapeno, but followed the rest and it was amazing.

The first time I made it, I put what I thought was a 1/4 cup onion of each in my processor, and it was awful!!!  The onion was very overpowering..the second time, I put everything else in the processor and put a little bit of the onion in at a time, tasted it as I went along.  It turned out great, thank you!!  I don't ever have to go out to a mexican restraunt just for the salsa craving again!

Very good!  Left out the cilantro since I didn't have any on hand.  Next time, I will add some of the ribs and seeds of the jalapeno to make it a medium heat.

I was surprised by how good and fresh this tasted. I used white vinegar, juice of 1/2 of a lime, and about 1 tsp of sugar. Overall, this is going to be the recipe that i use when there aren't any good fresh tomatoes available in the winter. I suggest you try it!

When I originally made this recipe I didnt feel that it had enough garlic so I added 2 more cloves and a little bit of garlic powder to suit my tastes.  After a couple days in the fridge the garlic became over powering.  (my mistake) Overall, I liked this and will make it again.  (with the amound of garlic that it called for)

This recipe was the easiest and quickest salsa recipe I've tried so far and it was also the best.  I LOVE it!  I used the fire roasted tomatoes and added a hint more cilantro.  I also used a smaller green hot pepper in addition to the jalepeno to give it an added spice.

My husband is a salsa "snob" and for years I have been trying to make a homemade salsa that meets his taste, to no avail. Infact my last try (beore making this recipe) he kindly and lovingly said, "Honey, I'm sorry, but for some reason you just can't make salsa. You are a wonderful cook and awesome baker, but salsa is just not your thing." This caused me to go into "I will NOT accept defeat and I WILL make a fantastic homemade salsa" mode! And I DID! This is a perfect salsa! I have always used "fresh" tomatoes and the canned tomatoes did the trick! I did follow a few reviewers suggestions - used Trader Joes Fired Roasted Tomatoes with Green Chilis & substituted lime juice for the vinegar.  And, something I read in another salsa recipe,  I boiled the jalapeno for 15 minutes in salted water then cooled and removed the stem. However, it was a tad too hot for my husband since I left the seeds in the jalapeno, so next time I will remove them. Otherwise this was "perfect"!!!

This salsa recipe has become a staple in our house.  I tend to use more cilantro than the recipe calls for and depending on what I have on hand I will add different peppers and onions.  A great basic recipe that my husband always comments tastes so fresh.  I end up making about once a week.

I like this for how easy it is.  However, you cannot move away from the exact measurements or else it can really go wrong.

Not so crazy about the amount of vinegar or the cumin. I also like it better with some vinegar and lime juice. Great recipe to tweak and make your own.
