Only one problem with this recipe!  When guests begin a civilized cocktail hour, and discover this dip----they don't stop eating it!  Appetizers are supposed to whet the desire of things to come, but this particular one, makes people want to forget the dinner, and just keep devouring this DELICIOUS warm dip.  Thank you Dayna for sharing. After the first time I made this dip, I did add one extra step, that I think makes a noticeable difference.  Before placing the Pepperoni on top of the mixture, I render out a lot of the orange (not too pretty) colored fat, by microwaving the Pepperoni, separately, for a bit on a paper towel, and then I place it onto the casserole. If I can't keep the "vultures" at bay, I may end up serving this as an entree!

Don't give up on this dip!  When I was putting up the leftovers from the Super Bowl, I was surprised that no one ate much of this dip.  It didn't taste much like pizza.  I even added the spices to the cream cheese the day before. Well, I hated to waste the appetizer so I gave it another chance the next day and it was FABULOUS.  Perhaps it needed 48 hours rest time or perhaps it needed to be baked first and then refrigerated for a day.  All I can say is that after being heated the next day for the second time, it was a totally different dip.  I served it with baguette slices but that wasn't the way to go.  The saltiness of tortilla chips made a big difference. I think if you toasted the baguettes with olive oil and garlic salt as mentioned by a previous poster, that would work as well.  The cooling of the dip was a bit of a problem.  I think next time I'll add a bit of milk to the cream cheese to soften it.  Bon appetit.

Don't ya just love watching peoples faces when they see something a pretty and interesting looking on the table? I must mention two of our best friends, Tony and RoseAnne and their kids, Gina and Andrea. They're obviously Italian and I just knew they'd love this dish. Ro, being very dramatic, looked at the plate and wanted to take a pic of it! She's a pip! Needless to say, this dip FLEW off the dish within no time! I took "Laura from Al's" advice and made this two days before. At times flavors really do need to get acquainted. I also added not only pepperoni to the topping, but regular Italian sausage and some onion too. I used my jar of Italian seasonings in addition to my regular garlic and onion powders. A thin chip won't work very well with this. Use something thicker like those mini seasoned bagel chips. Excellent Dayna!

My guests devoured this dip in less than five minutes.  Next time I'll make two.  I mixed the cream cheese and herbs the night before and baked at 350 for 30 mintues.  This recipes is fabulous and so easy.

If you're a pizza person this is the dip for you. I omitted the olives since I dont care for them and pretty much used all the pepperonis that came in the standard sized package. I sprayed some PAM on vienna loaves and toasted them. I recommmend having this ready about 20 min before serving since the dish is really really hot and  not manageable to spoon onto the bread. I've already made it twice! Also make a day ahead of time so the cream cheese sets with the spices and then bake on day two!

I made this for Superbowl and this was a hit!  My changes: I added 1 tsp dry italian dressing seasoning in addition to the seasonings called for, I left out the peppers and olives, and I used 6 oz of pepperoni instead of 2.  I baked it for 25 min at 350.  This is one that will stay in my recipe box as a favorite.  Thanks!!!

I wanted to try something different and this was a big hit!!!  I added mushrooms and more pizza sauce which was tastey.  I loved it with breadsticks instead of chips.  I bought the Pillsbury breadsticks and halved them before I baked them!  I will be making this a lot.  Also, make sure to cook pepporoni or it is really greasy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Everywhere I go I am asked to bring this.  I usually make two, one with just the veggies and one with pepperoni.  I never had the grease problems others mentioned I use the sliced pepperoni from the deli and chop it into fine pieces. I Serve with French baguette. This is a quick yet delicious appetizer.

I have made this about 10 times now.  Every function/party everyone tells me to bring it and it is gone withing 10 min.  I have tried every which way to make it and have fine tuned it to every ones liking.  I always make 2 for it never lasts.  One with veggies and pepperoni and other just pepperoni. Fist I mix 2 types of cream cheese. regular cream cheese and onion & chives cream cheese.  I add garlic along with spices and let sit overnight.  Use Pizza sauce and add extra cheese.  for pepperoni I nuke it for 20 sec on paper towel to get grease off and then cut up. I do one with just the pepperoni and the other with pepperoni, green peppers and saute mushrooms. I bake it which is the best way.  I serve it with french baguette bread which is sliced then  brushed  with olive oil with added  garlic and garlic salt then baked for about 10 min at 350. This is a huge hit!!!!

Very good! I started this yesterday afternoon but didn't "touch" it until earlier this afternoon b/c some had mentioned it needed time to blend. Like reviewer "Emac," I had also added some mushrooms, a little more pizza sauce and also added a dash of garlic powder. In addition, I made a combination of french bread slices and "garlic pita bites" also from this site to do the dipping. Thanks Dayna!

I make this quite often for get togethers with friends, there is never any left to take home.  I mix everything together in a 2 quart slow cooker and just leave it on low, keeps it from hardening up due to cooling.  To eliminate the grease, I microwave the pepperoni on paper towels to get out the grease, or use the turkey pepperoni which has virtually no fat.

The two stars are for flavor and appearance only. This really isn't a dip at all, more like a spread. It was difficult to serve, it was too thick, the cream cheese layer very heavy and the cheese on the top kept hardening and made it impossible to dip french bread slices and even broke the bagel chips. I put out a small knife to spread with but even then, you would get just big blobs of rubbery cheese. I did not use low fat cheese, I know that sometimes causes problems like this, but I went for the full fat varieties. Maybe if I kept this on a hot plate it might have worked better....

I put this one together a few days ago so the flavors might meld (I also used 3T milk in with the cream cheese). I forgot about it until my 18 year old nephew and one of his friends dropped by today and said they hadn't eaten all day.Voila! A great appetizer in minutes! Was he ever impressed.In fact, he and his friend both wanted me to print out this recipe immediately. When I ran into the office to do it, I heard him tell his friend, "My aunt is such a good cook." What he doesn't know is I owe it all to great cooks like Dayna who share their recipes on this site! I love it! Wonderful dip, Dayna. BTW, I served it with garlic flavored bagel chips.Yum Yum.

Ok, this is one of those recipes I tweaked and I am glad I did!  It was amazing!  I tripled the recipe and I mixed the cream cheese in my KA mixer with all the spices.  Mixed in the cheese and then instead of pizza sauce I used a can of drained diced tomatoes.  I used an 8 ounce package of the Hormel chopped pepperoni.  I did not layer, I stired everything together and poured in a pan and baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  There wasn't a drop of this left!  It was so good!

I got rave reviews for this on Superbowl Sunday. Based on the recipe's comments, I prepared this the night before to allow the spices time to work their way into the cream cheese. What's great about this is you can tailor it to your own preferences, just as you would an actual pizza. I used onions instead of the green peppers, and a Mozz/Cheddar combo, instead of the Mozz/Parm. I also opted out of the olives. It was fantastic on a buttery cracker. I can't wait to try other toppings!

I have made this dip for a very long time....delish!  Couple of tips:  In order to not have the pools of grease on top, I always use turkey pepperoni.   It is better baked in oven vs. micro.  Finally, it is DELICIOUS served using Fritos Scoops as the dipping vehicle!

I made a variation of this in 8x8 pan using: lower layer mixture of 1 pkg cream cheese, 1/2c sour cream, oregano, crushed red pepper, basil, garlic powder. Next layer jar of pasta sauce. Top with shredded mozz, chopped pepperoni, sliced black olives. Top with shredded cheddar, parmesan and some green onion/cilantro. Baked at 350 for 15 min.

I have been making this recipe for years.  Discovered it from Pampered Chef.  I mix the softened cream cheese with 1 TSP. of italian seasoning mix then spread in bottom of baking dish. Layer sauce and cheese mixture , then add toppings if desired.  Toasted baquette breads works great with this dip!  I bake in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes. This dip is always a huge hit!

Delicious dip.  Everyone loved it.  Just a tidbit to lessen the fat content a little.  Dip the pepperoni in boiling water for a minute or two to defat it.  Sounds crazy but it don't change the taste.  After dipping, dry on paper towels and then use as directed.

This recipe turned out great, we ate it all!  The only change was the second part of the cheese we put on top by accident, but I think this worked out well, it keep the other ingredients moist and nothing was too greasy.  Like eating a pizza.  Had it on homemade french bread and some corn chips.  Yumm.  So easy!  Actually made it the night before and microwave right before we ate.  Only change was in a 9" pan it did boil over a little so next time I'd put a dish under it or use a bigger plate.

So delicious and I made it with jalapeños, without green peppers and with the addition of fresh garlic, pepper flakes and a small tap of rosemary. The family held the bread and simply went at it with spoons

Yum yum yum yum yum!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using the mini pepperonis instead of buying the big ones and chopping them up.  As other reviewers recommended, I cooked the pepperoni in paper towels in the microwave, on low, for a total of about 3 minutes to get most of the grease out of them.  I sliced baguettes thin, then cut them in half diagonally and then toasted them in the oven for 6 minutes.  They had just the right texture...a little soft on the inside but hard enough on the outside to hold up to dipping/scooping.  This recipe is so simple!  I will definitely be making it again.
1/1/12 - Went camping for New Year's and made this as a dish to share and it was a hit!  Gotta love simple, delicious dishes!

Took this camping this weekend. Everyone loved it. I felt it was missing something, garlic maybe. I added crushed red pepper flakes to the top since we like our pizza spicy.

I can't believe I forgot to take a picture of this!  I don't have a microwave, so I baked it in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350, and the house smelled sooooo good!  I mixed the cream cheese mixture together the day before, and also did not measure the green pepper, pepperoni, and black olives ... just eyeballed it according to my own personal preferences.  I served this with homemade crostini, and it was the yummiest appetizer I had out that day!  And, it's so easy!  My new favorite!!

Awesome! Followed other advice to microwave pepperonis and cook the day before! One thing I did different was I used the teeny tiny pepperoni's by Hormel (Pepperoni mini's) and they were awesome!

This was okay-nothing great.  Over half was left untouched w/ a big crowd.  Cheese on top gets hard and was difficult to serve.

I have made this for several different parties. It is always a hit, I don't use the microwave, I bake it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Also, I use a whole jar of pizza sauce (about 2 cups) it makes it way more dippable.

Definitely more stars than 5.  Made 2 dishes tonight; one to try; one for company tomorrow.  Used chive and onion cream cheese, added Italian Seasoning and garlic powder to cream cheese.  Browned Italian sausage with onion and red pepper (didn't have green).  Used 5 Italian Cheese Mixture along with cheddar cheese.  Microwaved pepperoni for 30 seconds to remove excess grease; cut into pieces with kitchen shears.  Layered as follows:  Cream cheese mixture, sauce (used more), cheese,  sausage-onion-pepper mixture, remaining cheese, pepperoni, black olives (used more).  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Used olive oil & garlic Triscuit crackers and tortilla strips.  WOW!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Can't wait for friends to try it.

Geat recipe.  Our friends loved this one at our superbowl party.  I mixed everything together the day before and then put it in the crock pot on game day, which made it so simple.

This dip is a keeper.  The only change I made was to use 1-1/4 tsp. of Italian Seasoning instead of the other dry herbs as suggested by another viewer.  I topped it with thinly sliced pepperoni which I chopped and baked it in the oven.  It came out yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was really good.  I made it for a New Year's Day dinner party and everyone enjoyed it.  I omitted the peppers and olives and added mushrooms.  I think this would work with any regular pizza toppings.  I baked it in the oven and the cheese melted very nicely.  I had also served it with slices of french bread, but later on that night we reheated it and tried it with tortilla chips and we all agreed the chips were much better with this dip.  However, once this gets cold or even room temparature, it is not good.

Made this for Super Bowl yesterday, declared a hit by all present. I did make a change, used browned pork  sausage instead of pepperoni. Layered it, covered it with plastic wrap and did not microwave it until arriving at the party, micro-ed it 2 minutes longer, wanted it really hot. worked well with Fritos scoops or used a spoon to put it into Doritos Multi grain Scoops. Pizza heaven!

Definitely a must if you are a fan of chips & dip. I added about 1/2 tsp italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes and cooked it all in the oven for about 20 minutes. Also I subbed pizza cheese (that's what it's called in the store) for the mozz and parm. I used mini pepperoni and, like other users encouraged, microwaved it for about 3 minutes to get some of the grease out. THAT IS A MUST! All said and done, this is an awesome dip that I will definitely be adding to my rotation.

I made this dip on New Year's Eve and it was a hit!! I added red pepper flakes to my cream cheese mixture, and topped the dip with some extra cheese and chive snips, I baked it on 350 in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I suggest baking some thinly sliced french bread pieces, brushed with some olive oil, parmesan, and red pepper flakes for dipping.

Amazing.  Easy and very fun dish to serve at a party.  Both parties I took it to left me with an empty dish and requests for the recipe.  I toasted cut up baguette bread with garlic and oil on it to serve on the side.

Easy & delicious!  I did microwave the pepperoni before chopping to cut the grease.  I also added 2 tbsp. of milk to cream cheese to make it smoother.  Also used less parmesan & more pizza sauce.  I made it 24 hours ahead so the flavors could mix and served with tortilla chips - yum!

GREAT RECIPE, IT HAS THE BEST FLAVOR. I MIXED THE 
SEASONINGS WITH THE CREAM CHEESE THE NIGHT BEFORE
TO GIVE IT MORE FLAVOR.  AND I BAKED IT AT
425 DEGREES FOR ABOUT 22 TO 25 MINUTES.
WE ATE IT WITH PLAIN TORTILLA CHIPS AND EVERYONE
LOVED IT.

1-17-2016  ~Creamy pizza on a crostini! Yum!  A big hit with both me and Hubs.  So easy to make  and with such a big pay off.   I don't like a heavy oregano flavor so I prepared this with equal parts oregano and basil, thereby reducing the oregano by half.   I also went lighter on the Parmesan.  All your favorite, lovable pizza flavors scoopable with your "vehicle" of choice - in my case,  crostini seemed most compatible and sturdy enough to support digging into this substantial dip.  Hubs added this to his "make again" requests.

This was a hit with everyone. I doubled the recipe and made it with Italian sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms because the son does not like black olives, raw onions or bell peppers but I do so made a single recipe threw in some mushrooms with the other veggies and left out the meats making it vegetarian. Used scoop Fritos. This is a keeper.

I make a version of this recipe but I add 8oz of sour cream as well as some crushed red pepper. It will fit in the bottom of a 13x9 pan. I put chopped tomatoes and mushrooms on half for vegetarians and pepperoni on the other half.  Serve with pita chips.   It disappears quickly.

This was a hit at the party I served it at.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and made the recipe the night before to let the flavors meld.  I used reduced fat dairy ingredients.  Also, I used the bite size pepperonis and left off the pepper and olives since I was serving this to a crowd.  This recipe is a winner!

Made this for New Year's Eve.  Flavor was alright but both hubby and I didn't think this was a keeper.  It was fatty and heavy. (I did microwave the pepperoni on absorbent paper towels for about 20 seconds to release some of the orange grease but it was still fatty and heavy, due to the 3 cheeses and pepperoni.)  Serving it with Tostito scoops even made it seem greasier/heavier.  Preferred pita chips with it due to that reason.

I just finished making this about 30 minutes ago and it is amazing!  i did use italian seasoning instead of the ones mentioned, i added onions on top, and i split the cheeses in half and did two layers--one in the middle and one on top.  i served it with baguette slices that i brushed a melted butter/garlic powder combo on both sides and then broiled so that they would crisp up.  this is going into the family favorites page in my recipe box.  ETA:  Last night I had the chance to take this recipe to a party.  i tripled the recipe because i wasn't sure how many people were going to be there.  After 10 minutes, half of it was gone and there were only 20 people there so far.

I think this is a really tasty and different 'dip' to take to parties.

I don't think it has too much cream cheese.  I prepared mine in a 8X12 casserole with the cream cheese mixed with 1 tsp. seasoning; a single layer of turkey pepperoni (less fat), Italian Blend Cheese, the pizza sauce, a lb. of OWENS Italian sausage cooked and crumbled and DRAIN really well.  More cheese and sprinkled sliced black and pimento stuffed green olives on top plus a chopped tomato.  Cooked in 350 degree oven 20-25 minutes.  Cooled and will take to party tomorrow to be reheated as per another suggestion that I read.  I personally think that this would be very bland with only the cheeses and pizza sauce.  The sausage and more pepperoni is our personal favorite but otherwise, this is very tasty  and easy to fix.....

My daughter loves this recipe!  She calls it 'Lasagna Dip' since it tastes more like lasagna.  I added 1/2 tsp. of California Blends Garlic Powder to the cream cheese.  I bought very good pepperoni and chopped it up.  I also added cooked sausage and omitted the olives since my husband does not like black olives.  I also baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  This is definitely a keeper for my family!

Very good! Served with breadsticks at my daughter's 4th birthday pizza party. I actually probably doubled the recipe since we had a bunch of people over.

This dip was so good!  I added some mushrooms and lots of olives - went crazy with the toppings.  baked in oven for 30 min @ 350F - My husband likes this better than actual pizza, he likes finger foods!  So thick and cheesy we used forks to get the dip on the bread!  yum!

I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Almost perfect.  I made this for my husband and I while we watched the game last night (so sad, our Eagles) and he loved it, he said it reminded him of something his mom used to make growing up.  The cream cheese layer really adds alot of flavor.  I added 1 Tbsp. of garlic and 2 Tbsp. of milk to the cream cheese mixture after reading the reviews.  I topped half of the dip with chopped green peppers and onions, and left the other half plain.  This dip is great because you can experiment with the toppings, and I would like to try sausage or mini meatballs.  And it is soooooo easy and quick to make! I served with sliced baguette as suggested, but I would like to experiment with that too.  Maybe those garlic mini bagel chips would be good?  I'm definitely going to be bringing this dip to football parties.

This dish was okay. It got mixed reviews at the potluck I took it to. Some people loved it and begged for the recipe, others (myself included) weren't crazy about it. I topped it with pepperoni (which I zapped in the microwave to get rid of the grease as suggested by others) and crumbled sausage and served with bagel chips. The recipe has a lot of potential, so I think I might try playing around with it some.

I was skeptical of this recipe, but oh man - it is delicious! We added some jarred hot peppers too, to spice things up. Best part, is you can assemble this dip in advance and microwave just before the party starts.

I prepared this dip for my grandchildren and they wouldn't touch it. My son said that the Parmesan cheese overpowered the other ingredients. However, the consistency was right for dipping with tortilla chips.

This is a GREAT RECIPE especially if you have pizza "leftovers".  I had made some flat bread pizza recently and had some ingredients left.  I took some of the recommendations and mixed the herbs (used 1/2 more teaspoon of herbs) and cream cheese the day before and refrigerated.  I used an Italian blend shredded and shredded Parmesan along with pepperoni and black olives.  I baked (covered) at 375 for 15 min and then uncovered for another 10 min until cheese looked melted and bubbly.  Served with crusty french bread and sturdy chips.  Gobbled up!

I couldn't really get into this recipe. It seemed really heavy and a little over the top as far as a dip goes. I love a gooey pizza as much as anybody, but this was just alright for me, nothing more. I made a pie plate amount and 1/2 was left over. And not even my family members went back for more. I won't be making this again.

My family loved this recipe! I made a couple of changes tho: sautéed some onion with the green bell pepper then a little garlic at the end and used that instead of just raw green bell pepper in the layering. I also toasted pieces of bread with a garlic butter mixture to serve on. Sooooo good.

This was super easy and soooo good.   My hubby almost licked the plate clean!   Like a couple of users I popped it in the oven for about 10 min. to finish it.   I put some bread in our panini maker and then cut them in strips for dipping.  Perfect for a potluck or a late night snack that does not require a lot of work.

This dip is absolutely phenomenal! My friends and I made this for the recent Super Bowl after I came across this receipe a few weeks earlier and it was the favorite thing of all the foods we had! We ended up making 3 batches of it over the day and every time it was gone in minutes!  The only changes I made from the original recipe was we skipped the olives and we forgot to pick up Parsley but it still came out great! The secret to making this not just good, but great, is having the toasted baguette chips to use with the dip.  While still good with Tostitos Scoops, it just isn't the same as having the bread to dip.  For the pepperoni I had the supermarket deli cut me thick slices of the Boar's Head Pepperoni which ended up coming out cheaper versus buying a whole stick of it.  Overall, I was very pleased and can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe! Here's a few things I did:

I had some "garden vegetable" cream cheese on hand and used that instead. Gave it a great flavor! I also didn't put it in the microwave, I put it in a crockpot on low heat and let it simmer and bubble. It was delicious! The whole party loved it! We baked some Pillsbury biscuits (cut into little breadsticks) and served those with it. Huge hit! I'm going to make this again for sure!

I made this yesterday for my son to take to a Superbowl Sunday gathering.  I did not get the opportunity to taste it, but based on the comments of the guests, my son & his wife...looks like a 5-star keeper!!  (They served it with toasted baguette slices.)  I didn't have enough mozzarella, so combined with some sharp cheddar  -  about half and half.  Also used both dry grated parmesan and some shredded parmesan.  Had to make my own pizza sauce, as I forgot to buy some, but it tasted really good.  Gonna have to make some more so I can try it!

First, I agree this was a hit! I saw got the recipe first from a Betty Crocker e-mail. I checked out AllRecipes for variations/reviews. The difference in "Betty's" recipe was the use of chive & onion cream cheese. There wasn't the problem of the flavors "marrying" like folks had in this recipe. So with that change and using Hormel mini pepperoni's (w/the fat rendered out) it was perfect. I also suggest using a microwaveable dish so you can keep it at the right temperature during the evening (until it's gone,that is!).

Very good. The seasonings were perfect---as it baked (350-degrees 15 minutes) it smelled just like pizza. Can add any pizza toppings you'd like. As it cooled off it was still delicious but needed to use a knife or spreader instead of just dipping as the mozzarella cheese solidified but the cream cheese layer was always 'dippable'. Was equally good with bread, crackers, corn chips---just use what you have on hand/prefer.

This turned out great! I added a little garlic powder while mixing the spices into the cream cheese. I also heated it @ 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes rather than microwaving. It is really good served with the scoop Fritos.

Pretty good. 

I used my Pizza Seasoning grinder when seasoning the cream cheese. I used a mozzerella/provolone blend and Papa Murphy's Herb Cheese blend in place of the parmesan cheese. I added one more light layer of the mozzerella/provolone
blend and a light dusting of the Herb Cheese blend after I added the pepperoni and olives.

Tasty. Made a quick "grownup" snack for
my husband and I, who opted out of the kids' lunch of English Muffin Pizza.

Great recipe.  I use the Italian seasoning blend instead of meausuring all the seasonings separately, add some garlic salt and use the Italian Cheese blend as well.  I also use 2 tablespoons of milk when mixing the cream cheese.  Using the Tostito's dip chips are also a good idea.

YUMMY!  This appetizer literally disappeared in minutes this past Thanksgiving.  I took the advice of past reviews to pre-cook the pepperoni to remove some grease.  Add all your favorite pizza toppings to personalize this dish.  You have got to try this!

I've been making this dip for several years with just a couple of changes. I mix a cup of sour cream and 8 ounces of cream cheese with the Italian seasoning and layer the other ingredients as described. Also, we serve it with Frito Scoops rather than baguettes. This is always such a hit and a great, hearty dip for teens and adults alike.

Made as is, except that I cooked it on the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  Very, very good dip! Even better the second day. Thanks!

Add us to the "gone in 5 minutes" crowd. We are doing gluten free around here and this really worked to handle a pizza crave using GF chips rather than bread. Once you build out the "pizza" you can top as you wish.

I "pre-cooked the pepperoni's a bit in the microwave because the first time I made it, it would collect a pool of grease at the top. After this correction, my family loves it.

It didn't taste much like pizza to me and lacked a lot of flavor. I think, next time I will double the sauce, half the cheese, and maybe replace half of the cream cheese with sour cream to make it less dense.

I didn't think this was going to be that good - it was just a easy & fairly cheap dip for the food table at our Football party - Boy was I surprised!  It was delicious!  Everyone oddly enough thought the same thing but loved it when they tried it (Of course I used home made pizza sauce) - Totally going to have to make it again!

Everyone loved this. I made Exquisite Pizza Sauce (which is excellent to begin with) instead of buying a jar. Made mine with only pepperoni that I chopped up. Baked at 350 for 20 min and man was this stuff good!

Dip - what dip?  Made this for nine 24 year-olds who were watching the Super Bowl and it didn't last long.  I used low fat cream cheese for my first attempt (test batch) and found it wasn't creamy enough.  Recommend using regular cream cheese.

I have a couple things to add to make this better......First, when your combining the cream chess and spices also add some garlic powder and onion powder....  It really added some more flavor and my husband who doesn't like cream cheese likes it better with the additions that were made....  Also, The recipe I already had says to microwave for 10- 12minutes......I don't think 5 min. Is really enough

Made this last night for a New Year's Eve party...made exactly as specified, with the exception of leaving out the pepperoni.  Also, probably added more like 1 teaspoon of each spice.  It turned out amazing, and everyone was raving about it.  Thanks!

this was good but so greasy from the pepperoni. My sister said it would make a good lunch.

Took this to a holiday party last night and it was a huge hit! Everyone wanted the recipe. This dip was super easy to make but I didn't microwave it. I bakd it at 350 for 30 minutes instead.

This is delicious, simple, and very fast. I used Italian sausage instead of pepperoni and olives,  since that is our preferred pizza. I will make this many times. It was a huge hit.

I have made this recipe multiple times always to rave reviews with the following amendments:  to the cream cheese mixture I add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and I have used Italian seasoning in lieu of the oregano, parsley, and basil as it contains all of these. For the "toppings" I use turkey pepperoni as it contains less fat and will not make the dip oily like regular pepperoni. If you do use regular pepperoni I recommend microwaving it on some paper towels before adding it. Onions and mushrooms are also good additions.

Very yummy. I misread the directions and instead of layering the ingredients and I mixed everything together. It didn't matter because it was still a hit. Served it with tostitos scoops and bagel chips. Can't wait to make it again.

Revisited this recipe for an event and it was a huge hit, even w/the "picky" eaters.  Double this recipe, b/c it disappears quickly.  Rather than add the seasonings to the layers, I mix it all into the cream cheese, seems to really make it "pop".   I add basil (fresh or chopped in jar), minced garlic (jar type, in water), Italian seasoning blend and a bit of sea salt.  Adjusting all to taste.  No additional season btwn the layers needed.  I alter the toppings to suit my taste and make it vegetarian friendly.  It's more pizza-like imo w/all mozzarella.  I baked it at 325 for ~20 mins, it was perfect, the edges even got a little crusty (yum!).  Since the dip is 5*, it's good w/a really plain cracker, like a Water Crest.

This was one of the appetizers I made for Nebraska's opening weekend. Food is a big part of football season. Sometimes when I look at a list of ingredients, I have the sense I know how the recipe will taste. Often, I'm right.  I expected this one would be excellent, but was really surprised at how curiously interesting the flavor turned out to be; different and better than I expected. It was a hit with my whole family and I will not hesitate to prepare it again. The herbed cream cheese mixture would be spectacular on bagels. I would not have imagined that cream cheese would pair well with pizza ingredients, but it certainly does.

Very good, but congeals pretty quickly unless you have a warming plate under it.  Right out of the oven it is fabulous though.  Thanks for the recipe.

My 18yr old son LOVED this dip! I made the recipe without alteration, though I did put it in the oven instead of the microwave. When I make it again, I'd maybe try other's suggestions letting the spices sit in the cr. cheese overnight. I also thought of making the dip a little lighter by adding sour cream to the base, but I don't know if this would make it too runny.  I used low fat turkey pepperoni and didn't have any grease in the finished dip. I would double the recipe for a crowd for sure!

everyone loved this dip! next time i think im gonna have to double the recipe because it didnt last long at all. i did not have french bread but had garlic texas toast. so i sliced each one in half, then cut into wedges and baked them untill they were nice and toasty. i think this worked out great because it added the garlicky flavor that i think the dip was lacking.

Awesome dip! I put mine in a 9x13 pan and put it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. This caused the cheese to really cook and brown. I think it made all the difference! I also added some italian seasoning and some garlic to the cream cheese mixture. Served with slices of homemade garlic bread.

All my family loved this, I even caught my mom licking the baking dish, lol. Substituted green olives for the black ones and added chopped onion on top along with the green pepper and sausage. Made the exquisite pizza sauce recipe from this site, give it a try, you will not be disappointed!!

This was absoulutely delicious...definitely a keeper!  I did not add the pepperoni, and instead of the microwave I baked mine in the oven.  Also used toasted slice ciabatta brushed with olive oil and garlic as the dipper.  So so good!

I made this for a cookout and it was gone in a flash!! I used Italian sausage instead of pepperoni, baked it in the oven instead of the micro. Sliced up a loaf of french bread, rubbed with extra virgin olive oil and a clove of garlic then put them under the broiler until the were nice and toasted. We have another cook out to attend and I was told "You must bring that pizza dip!!" Thanks for a good one

I really liked this dip a lot.  I made it just with the pepperoni since I had some picky eaters.  It was still really good.  Next time I think I'll mix it up with a couple other toppings.

This dip was awesome!  As someone who loves pizza, this was almost as good, and tasted like pizza!!!  Made a few adjustments, used only italian seasoning, as recommended by others, and used pizza cheese instead of just mozz.  Everyone raved about it and it was the only appetizer at the party that was completely finished!  Will definitely make again and experiment with the toppings.

This was very popular at the gathering we took it to, but so rich that there was still some leftover.  I added some fresh mushrooms that I had on had, but kept everything else pretty much the same.  It was very good.  Thanks.

Wow, this is a keeper!  I made this Easter afternoon for hubby & the kids (not really kids as they are ages 22 down to 13) as they were playing a friendly game of darts while I was preparing dinner.  They devoured it so quickly and were actually trying to get in front of each other to get the next bite.  I added a bit of garlic to the cream cheese layer.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Hubby said that I should make this for him when the "kids" aren't home so he can have the whole thing to himself.

I think this looked better than it actually tasted.  It seems like too many ingredients for go through when dipping on a plate.

Amazing! The first time I made this was with part-skim mozzarella, canned Parmesan, diced smoked sausage and diced green bell pepper-- and it was pretty tasty. The second time was with whole-milk mozzarella, real freshly grated Parmesan, and pepperoni, and it was absolutely incredible! Better than actual pizza. (Both times I used low-fat cream cheese and divided it between two ramekins.) The only downside is that it's not very visually appealing after it's cooked-- just sort of an orange glop-- but man, is it tasty. This will be one of my signature appetizers. Thank you!

This recipe was a bit of a disppointment after all the great reviews.  The flavor was OK, but the cream cheese got hard and broke the chips, and the top cheese layer hardened and peeled off when you dipped.  Am going to try the White Pizza Dip next time, hoping the sour cream base doesn't harden so much as it cools.

This dip was very easy to make. The taste was pretty good....not fabulous. Family thought it was ok....will attempt again and add pepperoni or other pizza toppings for more flavor. Served with gourmet toast rounds. This recipe is on the back of the Lipton garlic and herb box. Will try again.

This recipe got rave reviews at the Superbowl party I took it to this weekend.  I added a bit more mozzerella cheese, and provided tortilla chips for scooping and everyone gobbled it up.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This recipe was just wonderful.  The only complaint I had was that as it cooled, it thickened.  It made dipping extremely difficult because crackers, tortilla chips or bread would break.  I would make this again, but I think I would add additional pizza sauce to thin it down a bit.

I took this dip to Bunko last night and brought home an empty dish!  I made it about 4 hours in advance and popped it in the microwave right before serving, yum!  I used chopped pepperoni and mushrooms for topping, no problem with grease pooling.  I will definitely serve it to my family Super Bowl Sunday!

This is a great neutral appetizer for picky people.  I didn't add any pepperoni though and wish that I had.  I served it with both torilla chips and french bread and my guests ate all of both!  I sprinkled different cheeses on top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes before serving.  I also added a few red pepper flakes to spice it up.  It's the perfect snack to reheat if it cools down.

This turned out quite well.  My husband, who loves pizza, really enjoyed it.  Next time I will make the cream cheese layer a bit thinner, I found it overpowered the other flavours.

Great recipe ! I made this for a party and everyone loved it! I blended the cream cheese with the seasonings the night before like oters suggested,to let the flavors enhance,but other than that, I made no changes. Didn't have a problem with greasy or runny pepperoni, used the pre-packaged type so maybe that made a difference.

This was a big hit at my Super Bowl party! Some of my guests do not eat meat, so I used green pepper and onion for toppings. I took one poster's advice and mixed the cream cheese and seasonings the night before, and it turned out great! I will definitely make this again.Thanks so much!

Wonderful!  It does taste just like pizza.  The only problem we had was the bread we served with it was too soft so our guests spooned the dip onto the bread.  I'll try breadsticks next time. Also I took one of the other reviewers suggestions and microwaved the pepperoni first. Delicious.

If ever you need a last minute appetizer, this is the one to make! So quick and easy, plus it was so yummy! I made warm bread sticks to serve with it. This is very, very kid friendly, but just as big of a hit with adults.

So simple, so tasty and so versatile.  Altered the toppings a bit, but still great.  
Only regret is that once it cools, it's not the same.  I suggest using a hot plate.

This is a good dip. My guest liked it because it was "different".  I made the dip that day before our party so that the cream cheese was flavored well from the herbs. I would make this dish again.

I will definitely make this again. However, I did add more oregano and I added garlic powder to the cream cheese. Then after assembling the rest according to the directions I baked the dip  at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Delish!

This recipe is awesome.  I have been making it for years for parties and always get asked for the recipe.  My recipe is a bit different though where instead of plain cream cheese, it uses the Sour Cream and Chive flavor in the container.  I also bake mine in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  It definitely brings out the taste of the pepperoni more when baked!!

This is a very good dip that tastes just like pizza, with a little bit of richness from the cream cheese.  I served mine with pita chips, as that's what I had on hand.  I would definitely make again, especially since it is so quick and easy to put together.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Hmmm.  Maybe everyone else out there really likes pizza-flavored cream cheese, but I didn't, and apparently neither did the people at the Super Bowl party because it was barely touched all night.  For me the cream cheese flavor was just way too much, and I really didn't care for the tart/sour taste it gave this.  Pizza isn't supposed to taste like cream cheese.  I even followed most of the reviews and made this a full day ahead of time.  I think if I try this again I would slash the cream cheese and add more pizza sauce.

My family loves this recipes so quick and easy; however I did make a few adjustments. I left off the parmesan cheese and I used turkey pepperoni since it's not greasy. I put it in a casserole dish and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I served it with Italian flavored pita chips; this also reheats in microwave easily.

This was super easy to make and was a big hit with my guests. There was none left by the end of the night. Will definitely make it again, may try mixing up the ingredients with some sausage instead of pepperoni or green olives over black just to see how it goes.

I thought there would be plenty left for snacking on the next day, boy was I wrong!  This was devoured by only 5 people.  Everyone wanted the recipe, which I was reluctant to give out since I'm not a good cook and I thought I'd use it for my goto appetizer.  Oh well, will keep saving Allrecipes recipes.

This dip is amazing and so simple !! I have made it several times and it is always a hit!! It is great for work potlucks because you don't have a bunch of stuff to bring in. (Such as a heavy crockpot)  you can assemble it onsite and it cooks quickly in the microwave.

Saw recipie last Sunday,  Made it last Sunday for snack to munch on during the football games- didn't last long! We couldn't stop eating it. I followed directions only used italian seasoning (didn't have basil but italian seasoning covered it) and added some garlic powder and couple shakes of hot pepper flakes. I also baked it originally but warmed in in microwave.  Couldn't find the bagel chips I wanted so ended up using "scoop" style tortilla chips. Kids are requesting I just make "one huge dish" of it so they can eat it for dinner. Thanks for quick simple and delish snack ! Oh and yes, its being made tomorrow's games too!

This recipe has proved once and for all that I am a pig! Made this according to the recipe, and for toppings used whole 14 oz. jar of store-brand pizza sauce, mini pepperoni, sausage crumbles, and some diced onion. Used Texas Toast to dip with and ended up eating 1/2 the loaf...by myself. I should feel ashamed, but I'm secretly wondering if I can get back to the kitchen before someone else comes in, lol. Will definitely make again, and try other toppings.

This has been a hit at two different work parties! I doubled the recipe the second time. I omitted the green peppers and olive just out of person preference. I am sure it is amazing with it also. I served this with Town House Pita Chip - Mediterranean ones. They compliment this dip well. Everyone Loves it! I also used the original classico pizza sauce from Target and cheeses from Aldi. Delicious!

I make this a lot, never measure the spices, use whipped cream cheese (or whip to incorporate the spices). I mix half of the cheeses into the cream cheese also. Nuke the chopped pepperoni a few seconds to get rid of the fat. Top with sauce, rest of provolone, any toppings I'm in the mood for, and sprinkle a little fresh parm on top. When whipped it's scoopable.

VERY GOOD!  I made sure to mix the cream cheese and spices together about a half hour ahead of time to make sure the spices had time to do therir thing, since one of the reviews stated that it was better the next day. I will definitely make this excellent dip  again soon!

Upon reading the recipe, I knew this would be great, but I made some changes to suit my diet. I used chicken Italian sausage instead of pork pepperoni, sautéed chopped fresh mushrooms which I added to the cream cheese along with a half cup of plain almond milk to help this be more of a dip than a spread. I also added sautéed onions and lots of garlic and extra oregano and cayenne to the crumbled sausage. This was spectacular....tasted exactly like a sausage pizza. I served it with bite sized freshly baked garlic pizza dough pieces, available at Trader Joes if you are lucky enough to have one in your area. Also used their pizza sauce, which is delicious!

we liked it a lot, it's easy and quite impressive when you think of the amount of time it took you to get it together. Anything that can go on a pizza can basically go here: I don't like anchovies, but put a lot of oregano and black olives. Even the children cannot quite criticize it... I have no microwave but this didn't put me out: it is a success straight from the oven too

Very tasty and quick to put together.  I added garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture.  I did not use green peppers and I did use turkey pepperoni mini's which I microwaved briefly to get any extra grease out.  Also topped it with a bit more mozzarella.  I will make this again.

Very easy to make and it was a huge hit at my company potluck. I assembled and heated it in the microwave the night before, then warmed it when it was potluck time. There was so much food that there were leftovers of everything, except this dip! My coworkers demolished it!

As suggested by other viewers, I put all the ingredients into a small crock pot. To me it was nasty and salty. My son and his girlfriend loved it. Go figure... I'll give it one more shot and prepare it as written. I think the overall taste of the  layers will be much better. I want it to work because I really love pizza. This recipe is also easy enough to make it to your taste, for example, adding other toppings.

This stuff is da bomb! I didn't add olives, personal preference, but instead of layering, mixed all together and put in small crockpot. I did used roasted bell peppers. It wasn't pretty, but the taste, oh my. So good, people were asking me for the recipe! Thanks!

Made this the same night we made the Jalapeno popper dip.  I am in LOVE with this dip.  It comes together easily and it has an awesome flavor.  A hit with the kids and adults alike!  This would be perfect for teenagers.  No fuss...  Leftovers are awesome, too!

I really liked this recipe, and so did my guests. I made according to the recipe except I did mix the dip in the morning and let it blend for the day. I served with pillsbury breadsticks, cut into thirds and topped with butter and parsley out of the oven. I liked that it was something different! Yum!

I made this for the first time yesterday and LOVED it! Our group of 7 devoured it quickly, so I would probably make a double recipe next time. I did half with no veggies, and half with olives but not peppers (since I didn't have any). I served it with crackers and tortilla chips, and I think the chips were the best. I will definitely be making this again very soon!

This dip is fantastic! I changed a few things due to personal preference. I omitted the peperoni and the black olives. I sauted up some garlic, onion, and ground turkey and added that as a layer.

Awesome! I love, love, love pizza and this dip satifises my craving without having to order a pizza pie. We were quizical as to how to eat it. Chips, Crackers, Bread until I read some of the reviews. We started with tortilla chips, but they kept breaking. So off to make some French Bread slices. I cut kinda thin and spread butter and sprinkled garlic powder, then toasted them in the over. Fantastic! I think if I gave my husband a spoon he would have been just as happy! A definite keeper! It's easy enough for the kids to make themselves as well.

I quadruple  this and make it in the crockpot. I cook the pepperoni before putting in the crock to decrease the grease, then layer each set of ingredients, sauce, cream cheese mix, cheeses, pepperoni then another layer of the same.  Cook 2-3 hours on high until it's bubbling. It's always a big hit and is eaten up quickly.

I made this last week for movie night at a friends house. It went fast! I didn't change much in the recipe... but I did put this in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese was bubbly. I also used mini pepperonis instead of the regular sized, and threw in some diced green peppers, hot rings and mushrooms. I cooked the pepperoni first based on other reviews, and this worked perfect, as the grease was already cooked out of the pepperonis before baking. I also used fresh mozzarella. Not sure how much different that was than using already packaged, but the cheese stayed melted and was easy to dip. Also, per other reviews, I sliced up a baguette for dipping. I brushed each slice with EVOO and fresh garlic and toasted till crisp. Worked wonderfully and everyone loved it!

Beware! This is dangerously good. I scaled it down to 4 servings to give it a trial run. A wise decision as I would've been tempted to eat the whole thing. Thanks for posting.

My step-mother loved to serve this pizza dip.  We have used it as a main dish with a salad as a family.  For an appetizer, simply bake individual ramekins or sauce cups, and offer skinny bread sticks.

Probably won't make again. I love making apps for parties and do frequently; this was definitely not one of the hits. It wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't fantastic either.  Nice concept, just didn't quite have it. Thanks anyway! :)

This has been a huge hit!  Perfect for camping.  I make it ahead in an aluminum cake pan.  This is so versatile because you can put anything you like on a real pizza in this dip!
I added chopped up banana peppers for a bit of zing! I served it with nachos.
I've made this dip 3 times this summer.

This was a book club hit!  I did bake it like other suggested - 350 for about 25min as well as adding plenty of pepperoni and no other toppings.  I like how versatile this dish would be.  All the ladies asked for the recipe - definitely will put this in my favorites!

This is incredibly easy and really tasty. I made it one night when I used my recipe spinner on my Iphone and it popped up. I was in the grocery store so I just grabbed everything. It was great! I did let it sit for a few hours to let the spices meld with the cream cheese. You can make it as lite as you want with non Works in oven or microwave.

Taste-wise, pretty good. But this dip was very watery (the pizza sauce, I think, is hte culprit). I made it in a pyrex and baked it til bubbly for a deeper warmth and taste. Don't get me wrong, the guys loved it. But I probably wont make this recipe again.

My goodness, this is good dip.  I mean, really good dip!  I made this in three individual dishes to meet all of my kids' request.  One I made with everything in the recipe, one without the pepper and olives, and one with only the cheese and sauce.  All three were gone in minutes.  I served with sourdough bread, and it was fantastic.  Perfect appetizer and football watching food!

This was really good and I will keep this recipe around. I did not find this to be too salty as others have. And no, it does not taste like pizza, hence the cream cheese, but it gets the message of a pizza across and is delicious. I took this to a party and it was devoured.

Wow!  This dip received thumbs up by my entire family, which is rare.  I followed the recipe as written, but didn't layer, just mixed it all together.  Because the mozzarella cheese was blended in, it stayed soft and dipping was easy.  Thanks for a simple but wonderful recipe.

Holy moly this was good!  The only thing I changed was that I added some garlic salt to the cream cheese mixture and I used scrambled sausage rather than pepperoni.  I will most definitely make this again!

this is really good, but i do suggest that you cook the pepper just a bit to release some of the moisture...i did make it by the original recipe and my dip was a bit watery on the top from the green pepper.

Warning!!!!  This dip only last a few minutes.  It is easy and great.  I increased the olives and pepperonis.  Simple and delicious.  It tastes just like a pizza without the crust.

Everyone loved this! Served with a french baguette that was baked and tossed with olive oil and garlic seasoning salt. Doubled it and made it in a 9x13.

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed is I didn't include green pepper and I doubled the recipe.  I took it to work for a tailgate party and served with tortilla chips.  It was a HUGE hit!  I will definitely be making this again!

This dip is really good!!  I made it a day ahead and then baked it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I used Hunt's Traditional Spaghetti sauce for the pizza sauce and added a few chopped mushrooms to the top.  Thanks to a tip by other reviewers here, I microwaved the pepperoni slices on papertowels to remove the orange oil prior to adding to the dish.  What a great idea that was! (Thanks!).  I served the dip with French bread baguettes, toasted, with a bit of olive oil and garlic salt.  I think next time, I will skip the garlic salt and either just use the OO or maybe just a bit of butter before toasting.  This dip is great for any get-together since most people like pizza!  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to everyone for the great comments.

I made this for a party along with several other appetizers. I did it differently though. I diced the perreroni & heated it in the microwave just long enough to loosen the fat. Then wrapped it in a paper towel to absorb it. I didn't layer the ingredients, I just mixed them all together in a bowl & topped with some more cheese & a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. It is much easier to eat that way & looked great. I served it with homemade pita chips. Tortillas are very good with it too.There wasn't a bit of it left & I had several requests for the recipe.

A major hit at a party! When you see 5 people fighting over the platter, you know it is a smash! This is one of those dips that is easy but honestly blows people away. I love to look like an amazing cook! You must do it!

Made this for Superbowl Sunday.  I did as others suggested and put it together the night before.  I also baked in the oven instead of the microwave.  I have to say, this was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it, said it tasted just like pizza and was definitely a "keeper".  I think the best thing about this recipe, is you can completely customize the "toppings".  I omitted the olives and bell pepper, and used only pepperoni.  Next time, I will change it up and use sausage, pepperoni, and some of our other favorites.  I highly recommend making this.....if you like pizza, you will love this.  Also served this with pita chips.  Perfect!

Really good!  I baked mine at 350 for about 15 minutes and it rocked.  I tore up some soft bagels and we used that for the dip, tasted like little pizzas. Went over well.  I like the fact you can change it up with different ingredients.  The parm cheese almost made it thicker to hold everything in.  Very nice!

I made this for a gathering at a friends house and it went over pretty well.  I wasn't impressed though.  It really has to be eaten while it's hot.  If the top layer of cheese cools, it's difficult to eat.

I made this last night to take to a potluck this afternoon, but they canceled the potluck so there are just the 2 of us to eat the whole thing!  We put some in a bowl and heated it in the microwave, and I don't think we'll have a problem finishing the whole dish in the next few days.  This recipe is really good, better than expected.  I used the whole jar of Ragu pizza sauce which was half a cup more than the recipe said, but it turned out great!  I'll make this again for sure, thanks!

This went over REALLY well at a recent party.  I followed suggestions to mix the herbs and cream cheese the night before and I added some garlic powder too.  I cut the parm to 2/3 cup, the oregano to 1/4t, and upped the basil to 1/2t.  I omitted the peppers and olives and substituted vegetarian pepperoni for the real thing.  Is it bad that I didn't tell them?  No one seemed to notice and it was gobbled up.  Good call on the frito scoops; it's a dense dip and the cheese on top makes it hard to break into at first.  A fantastic dip!

This recipe is awesome.  I made this for a second grade class and everyone loved it.  Not only did the teacher ask me for the recipe, but the teacher's students also asked me for the recipe.  Instead of pizza sauce, I added marinara sauce and it actually turn out better than when I first used pizza sauce in the original recipe.

I have made this on several occasions for pot locks, etc. and have always gotten rave reviews. Instead of chopping up pepperoni, I just used Hormel mini pepperoni which keeps the same flavour but more pleasing to the eye.

This dip was delicious.  The only addition I made was to add some garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture.  I did change the amount used of some of the ingredients because of other comments.  I used 1/4 t. oregano and 1/2 t. basil.  Just the right mix.  I only used appx 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and grated parmesan cheese.  I used 1/2 lg. green pepper and one small can of black olives.  I did bake it in the oven at 350 for 20 mins and reheated it in the micro.  I also put the pepperoni in the micro for 30 seconds prior to placing on top of dip.  Everyone really liked this dish and wanted the recipe.  Will make again.

Agree with previous posters - microwaved the pepperoni and omitted the green pepper.  I used Ital seasoning instead of the spices which is basically the same thing.  No leftovers will make again.

Will make again!  Definately a difficult little dip-much better the next day.  I recommend putting it in a microwavable dish for that purpose.  All in all it turned out great-guests agreed!  (After reading other reviews: I did make the cream cheese mixture the night before, pressed into pie pan.  Topped right before with the peppers, pepperoni, olives and cheese.  Cooked in oven for 15 minutes at 350.  Probably won't use peppers again.  I did cook the pepperoni beforehand in the microwave.)  THIS DISH MUST BE SERVED HOT!!

Mmmmmmm!!! I made this the day before my daughter's party and let it sit in the fridge. The flavors came together so well! I added green bellpepper diced, and used turkey bacon (taste just as good). EVERYONE loved it! I brought leftovers (made a big pan) to Sunday School the next day and the children are still talking about it!

Very dissapointed. For the record, almost every recipe i try, i love from allrecipes. I always bring dips to parties. This just didnt cut it. Even for me, i felt like this was just okay. I am used to people begging me for the recipe of my appys, and this there was some extra left.  Sorry. if you are goingto make this, try before you bring somewhere, in my opinion.

Delicious and the crowd loved it. The only things that I did differently was (1) I made and cooked it the day before and then re-heated it and (2) I popped the pepperoni in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds on a paper towel, to eliminate some of the grease. Will definitely make it again. Very easy to prepare too.

This was very good.  Only changes made was I used red bell pepper instead of green bell pepper.  Was gone within minutes.

This is a good recipe...though very oily. The second time around, I ommitted the pepperoni and went for a veggie pizza dip instead; using onions, pepper and black olives. Good base recipe, and very easy...a big hit with teenagers!

This was awesome.  I took to a NYE party and everyone loved it.  I used less parmesan; only 2/3 cup.  I also used slightly more pizza sauce.  Instead of using the toppings suggested, I sauteed sweet Italian sausage with onion.  I crumbled on top and eye-balled how much to use.  I then microwaved the whole thing.  I loved serving it with garlic bagel chips.  This was so easy and tasty!

As suggested by other reviewers, I made the dip two days ahead and microwaved it as guests were arriving. It was delicious! I made it for a Christmas party and it went over pretty well. I don't know if I'll make it for a party again, as it is a shallow dip and it was hard for guests to scrape out of the pie pan. But I will definitely make it again for a lazy Sunday with my husband!

I thought this was pretty good, but there was a lot left over from our party. I think there was too much seasoning... it was really strong. If I make this again, I will probably cut the oregano in half, as that seemed to be the predominant flavor. Definitely stick the pepperoni in the microwave on some paper towels for a minute or so before adding to the dip. Lots of orange fat will accumulate on the top of the dip if you don't do this. I did like how cheesy this was, but not sure if I will bother making it again.

We have game nights often in the cooler weather and my husband has deemed this dip a game night necessity! I just used pepperoni and not any onion, olives or green pepper.  It was a definite hit.  Thanks for sharing!

I brought this to a potluck for work & it was gone almost instantly. It was really delicious. I baked it for 20 minutes before I took it so it'd stay mostly warm by the time we could eat it. Next time I will leave out the green peppers because of personal preference.

I originally thought this dip would be boring, but I was wrong. Excellent recipe. Important to mix the seasonings with the cream cheese first. I also added extra cheese to the top. Pick a pizza/spaghetti sauce with lots of flavor. Also, if you don't have time to wait overnight for the flavors to marry, just bake it in the oven for 25 minutes as other members mentioned. It helps. Thanks!

Yum yum yum! This was sooo good, I loved it! The only changes I made were that I halved it and added some salt, garlic powder and onion powder to the cream cheese and also added a little more of the "toppings". I ate it for lunch with some breadsticks I made! I will definitely be making this again!

I did not use pepperoni as I don't eat that.  This was an excellent dip for bread sticks.  Too heavy for chips like someone else said.  I did not find that this tasted very much pizza, I thought the parmessan cheese was over powering...I think I would cut back the parmessan cheese next time.  Although this was also better the next day after it had set in the refrigerator over night and then was reheated the next day.  So I would make this a day in advance refrigerate and then reheat.  Will probably make this again but not an absolute favorite.

Excellent recipe! So easy. I added crumbled bacon, and chopped up some canadian bacon. Used turkey pepperoni for less greasiness, also followed others advice and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes! Was a huge hit at Girls Night Out...thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so great for parties, and quick get togethers!  I might add a little sour cream or plain yogurt to the cream cheese mix (about 1/4 c. or less. maybe even a T. of milk) to make it a little creamier plus 1/4 - 1/2 t of garlic powder.  The cheese seems to be a little stiff for chips, especially if it has been sitting for a half hour.  Other than that... will be my go to recipe for quick appetizers and football munchies!!!

This was a hit! I didn't layer it, though. I just melted the cream cheese over the stove and then added everything else until it was heated through. I transferred to a crock pot to take to work. If you want this to be a little more "dipable", double the amount of pizza sauce.

I made this pretty much as written except I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the cream cheese mixture.  Everyone at the gathering I took it to liked it, but it wasn't the first appetizer to be eaten.  This was good, but not spectacular.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe to take to work today.  It was GONE in less than 30 minutes, and got rave reviews.  The recipe was very quick, easy and could be prepared the night before, but I was a little disappointed in the flavor.  Guess I just expected more.

This is very good!  It's easy to modify with the toppings of your choice, I only used pepperoni - no peppers, olives, or sausage.  Make sure the toppings are bite sized for easy dipping.  It was really good on pita chips or small toasted bread.  I bet fresh french bread would be good too!

Very good and worked great for my party.  Made up the week before, wrapped tightly in saran wrap & put in the freezer.  I pulled it into the refrigertor the night before the party and then baked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes just before the party started & it worked great.  Followed a suggestion by previous posters and added a little milk to the cream cheese mixture and this helped it stay soft.  The best part is that you really only have to dirty one dish because you can mix up the cream cheese mixture in the pan you're baking it in.  That's what I did.

I made this for the Super Bowl. There was none left at all! My husband even ate it and he isn't a big cream cheese fan. Very simple to make. I served it with store bought garlic bread sticks. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

This was pretty good.  I did leave off the green peppers and olives. (didn't have them) I added about 1/8 c finely chopped onion over the cream cheese and it added a lot of flavor.  I made this for a party and the recipe was request many times. oh I baked this in the oven and not in the microwave.  325 for 20 min.

This is a great quick recipe for football parties.  I can't show up without this dip!!  I add garlic powder to the cream cheese.  I skip the peppers and olives.  I cover the whole top with sliced pepperoni.  It makes a really pretty presentation.  I like it with bread, but my friends like it with tortilla chips.

I'm not sure what I did with this one but it came out to be a great dip.  I was concerned that the dip wouldn't come together well and would remain in layers, but I microwaved mine in a small casserole dish and everything blended together and created a really nice appearance for the dip.  For extra zing I added a bit of crushed red pepper to the cream cheese.  I served mine with a loaf of fresh Italian bread that I cubed.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for Superbowl and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made was I eliminated the green peppers because my family doesn't like them and I put a layer of cheddar/mozerella mixture on the very top.  I baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Awesome...Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for a birthday party and received mixed reviews.  Most people liked it but there were quite a few that didn't care for it.  I will give it another try someday because my personal feeling is that it's pretty good cold.

I made this for poker night and was sort of disappointed with it, since everyone was giving it great reviews. The only thing I did differently was mix it up after I microwaved it. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to mix it or not. The guys who tried it all said it tasted blaa, but I will give it another try but will oven it and not mix it.

I made this for two Thanksgiving dinners and it was devoured. I also substituted italian seasoning- it's just easier, and added minced garlic to the cream cheese (personal preference) and it was such a hit. I'm taking it to a work potluck soon as well. Thanks for an awesome easy appetizer!!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and everyone at our Mothers Day potluck loved this. It has amazing flavour and is very rich. I served it with baguette and nacho chips. It looks so good, noone could keep from devouring it.

Yum! I will double the recipe the next time I make it.  Not enough to go around...  I followed a reviewer's suggestion and went easy on the cheese.  I added more pepperoni and bell peppers and olives than the recipe called for and also some cheddar cheese (for color).  Next time I will add red pepper flakes and maybe some fresh garlic. I served it with tortilla chips but will also serve with toasted baguette.

This is good but hard to serve with the top layer of cheese.  Too much hassle probably to serve again with so many dips to choose from.

I agree that this recipe is fantastic. Made two batches for two different New Years Eve Parties. Both parties went crazy over it. My niece asked me to leave any leftovers because she wanted to eat it New Years day and to please give her Mom the recipe!! Thanks for taking the time to share it...

This was pretty good.  I liked it, but wasn't extremely thrilled with it.  I did microwave the pepperoni quickly to get rid of some grease which worked well.

What a great appetizer recipe.  It was fast, easy and very kid pleasing.  You can whip this together in just minutes.  I added different items to each half of the pizza to give it variety.  Thanks for a real keeper.

I have made this for several parties.  Now when I have a party to go to, people request that I bring this.  Only thing I do differently is leave out the bell peppers (just because I don't care for them) and used chopped rather than sliced black olives.  This stuff is addicting!!!

I use this every time I put out a spread for any gang that comes into my bar.
Very popular and easy to make. I highly recommend this dish.

Made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it. It worked out especially great because I didn't have a way to bake anything at work for a mid day event, and being able to microwave this was the perfect thing.

I guess I'm the odd man out. I did not like this dip at all. I follow the recipe like it said with the exception of adding a packet of dty Italian season dressing since I needed it right away and I didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge for a couple days as some reviewers mentioned. All I could taste was Parmesan cheese! there was so much of it. Pretty sad because it looked amazing.

My pizza-loving husband really enjoyed this.  I took the advice of other reviewers and made this early in the day, and microwaved it and cooled it.  I reheated it at party time, and served it with toasted french bread slices.  I substituted part of the parmesan with asiago and added a little 6 cheese Italian blend.  Forgot the pepperoni, but it was still delicious.   Super easy too!

I did not have parmesan cheese at home so I used mozzarella only.  I also used turkey pepperoni and left off the peppers and olives. I served it with sourdough bread pieces and everyone LOVED it. I would highly recommend this for a party.

I made this for my office potluck. We were doing a dip theme. I looked at a few pizza recipes and so glad that I picked this one. Everyone loved it. The only difference is that I used an Italian seasoning mix.

I accidentally used tomato sauce instead of pizza sauce. at first I thought it would have made it a little soupy but it didn't and it came out really good. We also used Pita Chips & Triscuits to dip into the dip.

I tweaked this recipe to make in a small slow cooker for Thanksgiving. I assembled it pretty much as directed and added or deleted items according to my family's tastes and left the slow cooker on warm during the football games that day. It was a pretty big hit overall and I will definitely make this again.

I took this to my Canasta group last night and had promised my husband the leftovers=almost one tablespoon!  This is a Good keto-friendly dish if you are careful to use the correct pizza sauce, and I appreciated Chef Jeff’s tip to render the pepperoni.  I will definitely be making this again soon for my best taste tester who was a little disappointed that he had less than a tablespoonful!

This recipe is super easy and tastes fantastic!  Everyone loves it. I doubled the recipe and made two layers of each ingredient and then microwaved and YUM!  (I had to extend the microwave time because if doubled the recipe and I think I ended up microwaving for 8 minutes.  Just check it after the first 5 minutes to make sure it is warm all the way through. We served it with Simply Naked Pita Chips.  We will definitely make this one again!  ????????

This was a big hit! I made it with diced green peppers and onions on top since I'm a vegetarian and popped it into the microwave. Everyone loved it. I served it with some french bread slices  that I brushed with olive oil and toasted in the oven!

This recipe is amazing!! The only thing I did different is omitted the black olives as we don't care for them.  I made this for a football party and then just put it in a crock pot on warm just so that it stayed warm over the course of the afternoon. Will definitely be making this for Christmas Eve!

Perfect dip!!! Instead of green pepper, we used green olives. You can really use any topping you want. Goes fast so I would definitely make 2 dishes next time!

Very good and does tastes like pizza. I'd recommend using the full jar (about 2 cups) of pizza sauce. I also added other toppings that go with pizza (onions, mushrooms, garlic powder, etc). Came out thick enough to top onto slices of baguette bread yet still excellent for dipping with bread, chips or crackers.

Well. It's on my board called shameless. But what the hell. This is clearly drunk food. That said. It's delicious. Like..... 100%. The only thing that might have made it better was actual crust. We didn't love it BUT we somehow ate all of it. You be the judge. Drunk Carby cheesy food. Will make again FO SHO

Very good, I took others recommendations and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning to the rest of the spices.  I made in the morning and cooked in the evening (partially in the microwave and finished in oven).  Guests enjoyed it!

Surprisingly good and kid approved.  I’m hesitant to try dips like this but thought I’d do something different for the kids and their friends to try.

Wow, what an awesome dip or really spread. Used toasted ciabatta and added Italian seasoning and garlic and onion power to cream cheese and it was devoured.

You can literally do ANY type of pizza as this dip.  Use white sauce and make it Alfredo pizza dip, use sausage, anything!  My guests absolutely LOVED it!  I did use pita crackers as they are a little more sturdy.  Excellent!

My friends liked it better than I did, but it was good. I think it really should be served with the bread as suggested.  It gets a thicker consistency as it cools and I think bread would make it taste more like a pizza.

Loved this dip.  It was the hit of the cookout.  I did skip the olives (as no one likes them) and used turkey pepperoni instead.  Definitely make this again.

This pizza dip is delicious !  It was a huge hit at a dinner party that I brought it to, it was gobbled up in minutes.  Followed recipe exactly the only thing I didn't add was the green peppers.  Thank You for sharing.
I have made this dip numerous times for parties.  I have started making one exactly as written (except for green peppers) and I also make one that has been nicked named "Loaded Pizza Dip" in this one I add the  Mozzarella and instead of the grated parmesan I use a Mexican Blend cheese.  Then I add pepperoni, crumbled precooked Jimmy Dean Turkey sausage, black olives, jalapeno pepper rings and if I have some crumbled bacon in the freezer that goes on also.  I do not microwave this dip I cook it in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes until hot and bubbly.  This dip like I said is always a  huge hit !!

Made it with some of the recommendations of other reviewers. I added 3 T of milk to make sure it didn't solidify, used turkey pepperoni so it wasn't greasy at all, and used Frito's scoops as the perfect dipper because you really  need something strong to stand up to the thick dip. I was really most worried that it would get clumpy and solidify, but didn't want to heat the house on a hot day.  Microwave on high for 5 minutes and no problems.   Love these reviews! I can make it great first time without my guests feeling like they are test subjects.  Thank you!!

This was definitely a surprise recipe for me. I changed it a little based on another comment. I added 3 tablespoons of milk to the cream cheese mixture and omitted the olives. It definitely tasted like a pizza.

LOVED it. I baked it at 400 for about 20 minutes. Followed the recipe as stated. DELICIOUS! We ate it with tortilla chips and baguette slices that were drizzled with olive oil and crisped in the oven. This is a keeper!

This was an amazing dip. I always make a recipe as written the first time. The only change I would make is less sauce (3/4 cup) but that's only because I'd like it to be more about the cheese.   I used garlic bagel chips, which are a very good texture for this because it is strong but softens just a little after dipped. The only problem was they were too salty. But that's just my opinion. I will definitely make this again with hopefully lower salted chips!!

Awesome, Deeelicious, Reeeeeaaaallly good were the comments from fellow employees who devoured 2 plates of this in 20 min! Only change was I used mini pepperoni to save cutting. (I heated the pepperoni in the micro for 30 sec to get some of the fat out before putting them on). I will DEFINITELY be making this again very soon.

I had this at a party years ago and loved it- never made it myself until now. I used  1 tbsp of Italian Seasoning instead of the individual spices and let it sit overnight and that was great flavor. Also used different toppings, but i think that's the glory of this- just like pizza, you can make it your own and for the audience you are serving- just the basics for kids or loaded for adults. Will definitely do this again!

This is a yummy dip, I've made many times but I add a small container of sour cream or small container of frenchnonion dip.  It makes for a creamier dip instead of a thick spread and the onion taste gives it just enough spice.

I cooked the pepperoni in the microwave for about 2 min and blotted with a paper towel to soak up grease.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was such a hit I was asked for the recipe .

Everybody LOVED this dip.  Garlic bread was a great accompaniment.  My guests requested a "sausage topping" next time.  I also considered putting chopped pepperoni in with the cream cheese.  Can't wait to make this again with some variations!

Really great treat.  I did add the additional step by microwaving the pepperoni first before placing on this dish to get rid of the orange fat.

Love this recipe. I make it with just pepperoni, no veggies or olives. Tried mini pepperoni and regular size slices. 

I mix a little bit of olive oil with garlic and butter and smear it on baguette slices that i toast.  Not low calorie but amazing.

My hubby *hates* cream cheese but doesn't taste it in this.

When I read some of the other reviews I was wondering what can I do to get the flavored more enhanced because i didn't have time to heat it then refrigerate and let set overnight (I kinda didn't read it before I made it.) So I added my seasonings to my cream cheese and also garlic salt. Garlic always enhances the flavor of anything ooey gooey cheesy. Then before I added my pizza sauce I added more seasoning plus garlic salt. I think it made a difference in the way it turned out cause everyone was talking about how good it was. I forgot to take a picture though. Sorry

I scaled this down to four servings (not making for a crowd). I made it in a small, round ~6 1/2" dia baking dish. The next time I make this (maybe even if it's a larger amount), I will try cutting back on the microwave time by one minute. The edges here came out very hard, almost inedible. I also didn't want a strong oregano flavor, so I went light with just  Italian seasoning and parsley. I also went very light on the parmesan. I just finished and basically had it as a meal with crostini. It's very good, kind of satisfying that pizza craving. Highly recommended!

Made this today for the big  game!  Was a little nervous with the ingredients - namely cream cheese! What a surprise ! 
This dip was easy to prepare! Made exactly as recipe called
for. Took others suggestions and baked it  for 25mins at
350. Also i nuked the pepperoni for 20sec in micro to take
some of the grease out of it. Served with garlic bread and
baked them at the same time. Garlic bread gave it a nice 
crunch and yet softness of the bread! Yummy! This is a 
KEEPER!

I made this today as a trial run for a Super Bowl party. I'm glad i did. The dip is good when piping hot but if it sits just for a little while it does not make for a good dip for an all day event such as a Super Bowl party. Not bad....maybe I was expecting more after reading the reviews.....

This is excellent. I sprinkled each layer with Italian Seasoning but did not put the black olives on it.  I made two for an office party dip contest and won. It is delicious and so easy to make.  Make two - they will  disappear. I served it with breadsticks but thin slices of Italian bread would be equally delicious

Delicious. My microwave isn't reliable so I popped it in the oven at 180*C for about  20 minutes or so. Absolute hit. Served with toasted tortillas, this dip disappeared within minutes.

Thank you.

Loved this!  Served it at a party and got multiple requests for the recipes.  Based on reviews, the things I changed were:
-I doubled the recipe
-I used a little more pepperoni than called for (though I will at least double or trip next time)
-I used 14 oz of sauce (which I doubled to 28 when I doubled the recipe)
-I made it all the night before so that the flavors had time to blend
-I mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering
-I baked it at 350 for about 40 minutes

I use whipped cream cheese and mix in 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella & 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese with the cream cheese & seasonings.  I also use fresh basil--about 2 tablespoons.  I add  a couple shakes of cayenne & garlic powders.  I spread the cheese mixture in the bottom of a pie dish, top with sauce, about 1/2 cup - 3/4 cup shredded mozzarella, then pepperoni that I microwave for about 20-30 sec to get rid of the oil. We serve it with baguette slices baked in the oven with a bit of olive oil, garlic salt & pepper.   I've made it several times and it is always a hit!  We've never had leftovers of this dip.

I use the mini pepperoni and microwave them first.  I also add in some browned italian sausage.  Everytime I make it it's a huge hit.  Perfect for work potlucks where all you have access to is a microwave.

I mixed everything together, and also added chopped scallion as I was chopping it for another dish. Added another cup of mozerella cheese on top and baked for 20 minutes at 350. Color wasn't so great but taste was excellent. Kept the top from getting hard as it cooled. Served with crackers and pretzel crackers that had similar spices.

People ask me to bring this one to Potlucks.  Word of advice, don't use the turkey pepperoni, it is healthier, but the real pepperoni is much better.

I tried this recipe for the second time today and it got gobbled up!! I probably was a little more generous with the spices this time around and also sprinkled in some garlic powder. I didn't measure the toppings...just put them on like how I like my pizza.  I used a 3/4 jar of RAGU brand pizza sauce.  I heated it in the microwave as instructed and it was killer good.  You can tweak this many ways just like pizza.  I think you can make or break it with what jarred pizza sauce that you purchase....so you better like your sauce or you could even make your own.  This is a fun recipe - make it how you like your pizza! I served mine with bagel crisps...plain and garlic. Thanks!

This dip is always a favorite!   I prepare it using sour cream in addition to creme cheese, with a ratio of 1 oz sour cream for each 3 oz of creme cheese.  Try using fresh crushed hot peppers and some oregano too.  A mixer, used on the lowest speed, blends the dip nicely.  Serve w toastitos "scoops"

Made for my last Super Bowl party and served with croistini and hearty crackers...was a big hit!  Please go by others suggestions and bake ahead and reheat before enjoying.  It really did bring out more flavor.

Flavor was good. A little too saucy for us. Will cut back to half cup of pizza sauce instead of 1 cup.  I used sausage that I seasoned with onion, garlic, cayenne and red pepper flakes instead of pepperoni. Will make again, thanks! :)

Made this for family and it was amazing how fast it disappeared. Great for parties or would be perfect for Super Bowl.  I'm actually going to make this for Halloween Night's post Trick or Treating.
Very good recipe.

I took this to a Bday party Saturday night and it was devoured.  I made two little changes. 1. I found miniature pepperoni at the store and 2.I baked the pizza dip for 25 minutes in a 350 oven. It got bubbly and crispy brown around the edges. I then refrigerated it till needed that night and then popped it in a 350 oven for 12 min. It was a HUGE hit. I served it with nacho scoops. By the time I thought to take a picture it was gone. I can't believe anyone gave this only 2 stars. They must have really messed up the recipe or used inferior ingredients.

Tried this tonight.  It was fantastic.  Did not have the French baguette, so I toasted bagel halves in the oven for 5 minutes then cut them into 1/4 pieces.  That was also a great combination.

Easy, good. A bit salty from the pepperoni. Used Hormel, so try another brand next time.

Hi all , I have had this dip an made it myself.  It is wonderful an kids love it. I added some cayanne pepper to mine for a little zing. I did not even get any once it was done. Two children an my husband gobbled it all up before I got a chance.  I made bread sticks with the dip an wow all gone fast.

Was okay and a good idea for a dip.  I made according to the recipe even though I had reservations, but too heavy on the oregano and basil for my taste.  Gave it more of a spaghetti flavor than pizza...so was disappointing.

Didn't taste like pizza. The cream cheese did not work well with the other ingredients, either and overall it was pretty bland.

Made this for poker night. We finished the plate before we even started the game.  To dip used various tortilla, multigrain chips, Melba toast, I also added cracked pepper which gave a nice zing. Next time I'm adding in chives, jalapeño

I take this to every party I go to & I always come home with an empty dish.  The Only revision is I usually just buy the pre sliced pepperoni and add that to the top instead of the sausage.  It's easy and always a hit

I brought this to Thanksgiving at my boyfriend's stepmom's house, and this disappeared from the appetizer table within 15 minutes of putting it down. I omitted the pepperoni, green pepper, and olives, and added sauteed onions and chopped mushrooms. I also added more sauce and probably used more mozzarella than was called for. I used Italian seasoning instead of the spices called for, and added a good bit of milk to the cream cheese to make it more spreadable. It was served with tortilla chips. I'll definitely double the recipe next time.

I've made this recipe like 3 or 4 times now. Me and my family really love it. I saute the onions and peppers and cook the pepperoni in the microwave to drain off the grease. I also added more seasoning like red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the cream cheese and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I layer this dip and bake it in the over for about 20 min comes out great each time!

This dip is amazing! It is very easy to tailor to any crowd by adding different toppings. I often double the quantities ( I don’t think the original serves 16) Like other reviews say, once it is discovered, it disappears. I serve it with sliced baguette and it’s a hit. If I make it at home, I broil it for a min or two after to crisp the pepperoni.

This dip tastes exactly like pizza!  I used mini pepperoni slices and kalamata olives and it turned out amazingly.  We used tortilla chips to eat it.  I will be making this for every party!

This dip was fantastic! I am giving 4 stars for now because I had forgotten all about it after making it over a year ago, so I can't rank it as high as my 3 other go-to dips for football Sundays. I am going to make it this weekend, though, so maybe I will fall in love all over again. I used green pepper, grilled onion, and giardineria for my toppings. I baked it to ooey gooey perfection and everyone loved it!

Best thing i made for superbowl.  A few variations.  First of all just dump everything in Crockpot and set to high for an hour, then turn it down to low.  Add 2 jars of pizza sauce instead of 1 cup.  Add a bag of mini pepperonis as well.  My variation is more of a fondue than a dip but it is amazing.

This is absolutely the best dip I have ever tasted. It looks exactly like a pizza when cooked and is so delicous with french baguette.
I omitted the olives and bell peppers, and also cooked the pepperoni in microwave and then blotted off the grease before placing on the dip. It was wonderful, you dont want to just put the regular pepperoni without cooking first, will be way too greasy. Also I think you have to use regular pizza sauce not spaghetti sauce, there are different herbs in pizza sauce that make it taste better.

This was amazing! Made it for the Super Bowl and added veggie chorizo (nice and spicy vegetarian version) and also added cheese to the top. Baking it in the oven for a few minutes is a great idea!

I gave this recipe 4 stars 'cause it was too salty for my taste. Next time, I'll try using less parmesan. I tried adding some salt-free basil n garlic seasoning to the cream cheese. Think it was a good addition. I won't give up on this recipe.

We loved this. I did follow other's suggestions about making the cream cheese mixture a day in advance, but I used FRESH parsley and basil with dried oregano and added about a 1/2 tsp garlic salt and  1/2 tsp of FRESH rosemary to it as well. I placed in in a pie dish and covered it with plastic wrap.  Although, it tasted fine that day and could have been cooked off without waiting 24hrs due to the fresh herbs. I also found these mini pepperonis which worked out great. I served it with a sliced french baggett which was the perfect pair.  It is easy and quick and only 5 minutes in the micro makes it the perfect party food!

This was AWESOME! I reduced the oregano to 1/4 teaspoon (personal preference) and added about 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. I didn't have any green pepper, so I subbed some chopped pepper rings. This was gone in a flash! I can totally see changing this up with all different 'topping' ingredients. I served this with toasted bread rounds and crackers. I will definately be making this again...OFTEN! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this as an appitezer while watching football and it was really good. Next time I will add Jalapenos and simmer the bell peppers just to get the water out of them because it made the dip a little runny. Toasted a sliced baguette with butter and a little garlic salt. Every last bit got eaten....this is a keeper!

This was pretty good. Unlike some other reviewers, I thought it tasted a lot like pizza. I left out the Parmesan cheese, since I don't add this to normal pizza. Rather than microwave it and layer it, I just mixed everything together and put it in the oven on 350 for 20-25 minutes. It was great with toasted Italian bread cut into strips for dipping. I have some leftovers, which I expect will be tasty with tortilla chips.

sooo yummy!!! I just used italian seasoning to mix with the cream cheese and for the cheese i used a package mix that had parm in it. This helps to cut back on the list of ingredients without cutting out how wonderful this tastes!

This was an extremely cheesey dip. The parmesan cheese made the texture a little grainy in my opinion. Next time I think that I will just add more pizza sauce to compensate.

This was really good and also very simple to make.  I did as others suggested and added some garlic powder to the cream cheese.  I mixed it up and let it set in the fridge several hours.  I microwaved it and thought it came out great.  No real need to put it in the oven.  I will definitely bring it to another gathering.

My guests LOVED this dip and it literally disappeared within minutes.  I barely had a chance to taste it!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese) and put it in the fridge overnight, and then baked the next day.  Based on all the rave reviews from my friends, I will make this again.

This tastes just like pizza. I left out meat and veggies and made it with the cheeses only. We used warm baked crust bread to dip. I made half the recipe and there was some left over after my husband and I wolfed it...Im def bringing this to our next get together.

Rave reviews! I left out the green pepper and I fried and drained the pepperoni before adding to the dip. I served with plain pita chips rather than the french bread. This is so easy and would be perfect to take to a party since it just gets popped in the microwave. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

Had this dip at a friend's house this past holiday season, it's wonderful!  She adds different things depending on what's she feels like eating, so it's quite versatile.  I highly recommend this and plan to make it a regular at my house, too.

This dip was easy to make and a huge hit. The only problem was the portion that it made was very small...so you might want to double the recipe if you are making it for a party.

This was a huge hit at my casino themed party over the weekend. Not a drop left and everyone was asking for the recipe. I did like people suggested and put the seasoning in a few days ahead of time and added some onion, it was amazing. I am already planning on taking to a christmas party with the family. Thanks for this great dip could not have asked for more.

Love this!! So easy!! Just put whatever topping you would want on a pizza. I added some mushrooms and a little onion. I used turkey pepperoni ... tastes just as good but healthier!! Great with tortilla chips!! Everyone will love this! There will be no leftovers.

YUM!  This dip is so good!  You can't go wrong when you make it.  You can even make it with low-fat cream cheese and you can't even tell the difference.  I didn't add the bell pepper to it and I baked it in the oven to get the pepperoni a little crispy and it is so good.  I think you can pretty much add whatever you want and take out what you don't and it will be a hit!

I made this for a party at my house over the weekend and all the men loved it!  I followed the tips and mixed the cream cheese with the herbs the night before.  Had a little left over the next day and it was still delicious re-heated.  I served it with Frito Scoops- Yum!

This dip is delicious with FRITO SCOOPS. It's the only way to go. My favorite local pizza place serves this dip with Scoops on the side. The salty corn chip really adds a lot to this dip. Especially paired with the cream cheese and pizza sauce.

Excellent recipe!!  I've made this recipe for a recent family function and it never made it onto the appetizer table -- a few family members ate the entire dish in the kitchen!!  I recommend serving it with Sea Salt Bagel Chips.

We absolutely loved this!  It will definitely be in heavy rotation for "football Sundays" at our house!  I read previous reviews that said the cream cheese part was a bit bland, and added a few shakes of Onion Salt -- really, really good!  I bought a loaf of thinly sliced Italian bread and brushed it with a bit of melted butter and minced garlic, then toasted it in the oven.  Excellent recipe!

I made some significant modifications, but used this recipe as my basis and it won me the top prize in my family's annual 4th of July appetizer contest!  For my toppings, I browned up some hot italian sausage and tossed in about half an onion, half a green pepper, one package of pepperoni (which I diced) and about 1/4 cup of banana peppers.  I drained as much of the grease as I could and put the whole thing in a casserole dish then into the oven for about 20 minutes on 350 until the cheese on top was bubbly and golden.  I served with some crostini that I'd toasted under the broiler with EVOO, garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  A HUGE HIT!

I made this last night to send to our son's youth group party.  He came home with half the chips we sent.  Apparently the dip was so good the kids were just eating it with a spoon!  So from a group of hungry teens, this recipe receives a certain 5-star rating.

I made the dip for a party and everyone loved it.  A user recommended the pillsbury bread sticks as the dipper.  Good in theory, but did not work out as well as planned.  I will be trying it again!

What a hit! Nice thing is you can add your favorite pizza toppings.  My family loved it--made two, one just veggie and one with pepperoni and assorted toppings. So simple and so delicious!

This is so good!  :)  The only thing that I added different was a little garlic powder to the cream cheese.  Next time, I think I will also add some tidbit pineapple to the top just because we love pineapple on our pizza.  I cannot wait to take this tomorrow to a function.  I know everyone will love it!

I love this dip and it's always a huge hit everytime I serve it. I mix a little parmesan cheese and italian seasoning in with the cream cheese mixture. My toppings vary depending on who I'm serving. Love the versatility of this one.

I'm giving this five stars, because I thought it was very tasty. I doubled the cream cheese, and spices. Left the same amount of everthing else. I'll make this again.

Turned out great! Made it for our super bowl party and it didn't last long. I love that you can change up the toppings to fit the crowd. I served it with cut up pieces of texas toast. GREAT recipe!

A great recipe. The only thing I did different was to leave off the olives. Served with french bread that I made, a loaf that is small around, sliced it thin, brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder and baked them til crisp.

This is excellent!  It was devoured in no time at my party.  I gave it 4 stars b/c I think 1 cup of parmasan cheese is too much.... 1/2 cup makes it perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of our favorite recipes.  I am always asked to bring this.  I substitute 2 teaspoons of italian seasoning for the other spices.  We serve it with baked breadsticks or crackers.  I have learned to double the recipe because it goes so fast.

This was just OK. I made this for a football party going for something different. It was definately different, but just was not what I was hoping for. Could have used more cream cheese and  more ingredients to jazz it up more.

This is very good.  I did not have parm cheese, but will add next time.  I think you need to bake in oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  I served on garlic/cheese toast rounds.  YUM.. Thanks!  Great football food.

Oh my goodness this was awesome.  I wasn't too sure about it  but tried it anyway with all of the great reviews.  I am glad I did. This is a new favorite with my family and friends.  I added some ground italian sausage to the sauce and cooked onion and green pepper in a little butter to softened them.  Oh, so very good.  Gonna go make so more right now!

Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I did what someome else suggested and mixed the cream cheese and herbs together before hand.  Also, I went to the deli counter and had some Pepperoni sliced extra thick and diced that up.  I like my pepperoni think and in chunks.  Nothing was left!

Surprisingly Delicious! This was incredibly easy to make and so good!  I used toasted crusty bread, drizzled a little olive oil and some garlic powder on sliced bread and toasted them in the broiler!  Guarantee a hit with any pizza lover!  You can pretty much add whatever toppings you like.  Easy to reheat too, just pop it in the microwave.  Even my picky eaters loved it!

I have made this many times as a take-a-long appetizer and it always gets rave reviews.  Just prepare it at home, pack it up and pop it in the microwave when you get there.  If it hasn't been devoured in the first 20 minutes or so, pop it back in the microwave and it's brand new again!

i love this recipe, i take it to all of the parties/gatherings that I go to and it gets rave reviews.  I generally "dumb it down" and just get a bag of mozzarella, parmesan, a jar of sauce, and the cream cheese and I generally don't measure.  Can't go wrong with "too much" cheese ;)

I haven't actually tried this recipe but it sounds almost exactly like the Pampered Chef "Hot Pizza Dip" recipe, so it's probably good. It's good to use as a dip with the refridgerated breadsticks dough that you twist and bake.

This was pretty good. I left out the pepper and olives because I didn't have any. I put the pepperoni on after the sauce and used freshly shredded parmesan, romano, and asiago cheese instead of the grated parmesan. I baked mine in an 8x8 pan for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I stirred it all together at the end to combine everything. Great with garlic bread!

I made several modifications to this recipe and my husband loved it. I enjoyed it, but he literally scraped the bowl down!

Used neufchatel instead of cream cheese, added chopped garlic, red pepper flakes and hot sauce to that mixture, then thinned it with a little non fat plain yogurt. I also used more of each spice because we like a lot of flavor.

I subbed red bell pepper for green and used vegetarian pepperoni instead of the real thing – saves lots of calories and cholesterol, in addition to the animal!

Finally, I baked it for 20 minutes at 370 instead of microwaving.

We used yellow corn tortilla chips but I think next time I'll use crusty bread.

I like to try new things each time I entertain.  I found this recipe which didn't sound thrilling exactly but I went with it on the fact that it had so many great reviews. This was a HIT.  I loved it, my husband loved it and our guests thought it was spectactular.  I think I am going to make this for every gathering in the future.  I left out the pepperoni & olives just as a personal preference. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this for a New Years Eve/Bowl Party for our teenage son, the hubby and I got just a bit, but it was great.  

The plate came back empty.  I used turkey pepperoni and none of the kids knew the difference.

This is going to become a regular treat for us.

This was a hit!  I did not add the green pepper, pepperoni or olives.  I made 1 1/2 of the recipe & put it in a 11 x 7 pan.  I baked it at 350 for 20 min.

I would of loved to give this 5 stars but for some reason it was salty. I didnt use the peperoni i use canadian bacon I am not a fan of salt what so ever maybe it was my pizza sauce. I am going to try thing one again with a different sauce.

This was a great hit at our last book club meeting. We dipped bread sticks and was a different twist on the "dip" and a good change from the same old "Mexican dip".

Yum! I served this at work today, and it was devoured completely. I had several requests for the recipe. I used romano cheese instead of parmesan, but that was the only thing I did different.

Awesome made as posted. But I've also made it without sausage, peppers and the olives when making it for kids. I've also cut down the parm cheese when I want to cut calories a bit. You can't mess this one up!

This is very easy and a definite crowd pleaser.  It takes no time at all to throw together and you can even make it a day or two before.  I added onion to mine and put the "toppings" on top of the sauce instead of on top of the 2nd cheese layer.  I served with tortilla chips and it was gone before all the guests had even arrived.  That is definitely evidence of a successful recipe.

Excellent!  I did as others suggested, cut back on cheese, substituted italian seasoning, and baked it.  I also used turkey pepperoni.  I set out crackers and tortilla chips, Everyone seemed to like the chips better.  I have microwaved it before, baking it is much better.  Enjoy, it's great!

Very good!  I took the advice to microwave the pepperoni beforehand to get rid of some of the grease, but the first time I left it in for a full minute and it burned, but then I did it the correct way and the dip turned out great!  Be aware that the finished product depends on how good the pizza sauce you use, so choose a good one.  Easy recipe!!

I used Italian seasoning in the cream cheese, more pizza sauce, more cheese.  This is a finicky teenager's dream come true.  Even the grown-ups liked it!!

The recipe was okay. However, there are other pizza dips that I like better.

Four of us finished off the entire dish, with some crusty brown bread and corn chips - it was pretty good, the only thing I'd change is use less cream cheese, it was too much, and add more sauce.  I used salsa instead of pizza sauce and it worked well.

This turns out perfect. Even my fiancee, who doesn't like pizza, loved this. When it's done it looks like a pizza in a pie dish, and smells wonderful.

I think a few things are important for making this turn out so good. I'd say, don't wimp out on the toppings even if you're not terribly fond of them. Most of the flavor comes from the cream cheese and herbs so, unlike a normal pizza, the toppings aren't that prominent especially if the pieces aren't too big. Also, chopped pepperoni would work far better than sliced, so don't take a shortcut there. Finally I used an italian cheese blend rather than just mozzarella and I think it turned out better that way.

I made this for a party and it was well liked (especially by the teenagers). I made one vegetarian-style and the other with pepperoni. The kids definitely like the pepperoni better.

This was okay.  My husband liked it.  To me, it tasted too much just like pizza sauce.  Next time I would also use pizza or italian seasoning instead of the 3 the recipe lists.

This is a terrific dip. I made it for a Halloween Party. I used a different mixture of Italian seasonings though (1.5 tsp of Italian Seasoning Mixture) instead of the separate seasonings. I used jarred pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce. It was a big hit and my son loved it at home, leftovers by dipping chicken nuggets into it warmed up.

Great dip. I'll make it again.

We didn't care for this recipe.  I had a lot of trouble spreading the cream cheese into the pizza pan.  Also, DS said it had a sour aftertaste.

Pizza without the fuss!  I used more bell pepper and pepperoni than called for - enough to completely cover the dish.  This was so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out well and tasted like good fresh pizza but without any real kick. I think an increase in seasoning and less cream cheese might improve things but it was good for what it was, a nice change of pace in snacks.

I made this with pepperoni and too much grease collected on top. I would suggest using another kind of meat.  However, it's very good with just the cheeses!

This is an excellent appetizer.  Would be excellent for either a casual party or something a little more formal.  Beware... it can be addictive.  Also, very simple for even novice cooks.
