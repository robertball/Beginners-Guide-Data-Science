I swapped the white vinegar for balsamic and did about 1 c olive oil and 1/2 vegetable oil (because I ran out of olive oil). This substitutions definitely raised the cost of the recipe, but really elevated the taste as well, I believe. Overall, good recipe that yields a LOT of dressing, even without the water, which I reduced to 1/2 c. The roasted red pepper takes more time to prepare but enhances the recipe. I used the dressing in a pasta salad that I brought to an event and received numerous compliments!

I followed this recipe completely, I found it a little bit too sweet for my taste. I absolutely love knowing what ingredients are in my salad dressing and will save this for future use. I think next time I will reduce the sugar and I might add a little bit of freshly ground black pepper to it.

I used red wine vinegar  and home dried tomatoes instead of bell peppers. I also added some minced garlic. Then instead of all basil, I added half basil and half oregano.

A very nice Italian dressing recipe.
Good job getting the flavor right.
I made it less tart and less sweet to fit  my taste profile and added some garlic.
1 tsp of dry mustard helps it emulsify

I loved this dressing because it had fresh lemon juice in it.
It also tells how to roast the red peppers, so helpful.  thank you.

I marinate all my chicken in the most inexpensive Italian dressing I can find. I'm not going to buy it anymore though; I'm going to use this recipe but not just for marinade cuz it's really delicious on its own. I added 2 Tbsp pickle juice b/c I've read that Chik-Fil-a uses it to marinade their chicken, 2 tsp minced garlic from a jar, cut sugar to 1/8 cup, 2 tsp mustard seeds just because I had them ha ha, and added about 1/2 Tbsp or so of flour to help suspend the herbs and seeds. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I used 3/4 cup olive oil instead of the full amount just because I'm saving calories.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of white.  Half basil and half oregano  and added garlic powder and a small amount of dry mustard so it stays mixed.  Used my immersion blender.  I added sugar slowly at the end to my liking which was much less than the recipe calls for.   It's a very good recipe.  I like to use it in my bean salsas.  Thanks!

Looking for Italian dressing for sub sandwiches. When I realized I had a can of red peppers, I made this dressing. The kids couldn't tell the difference between this and store bought. I will definitely be adding this to my regular dressing list.
