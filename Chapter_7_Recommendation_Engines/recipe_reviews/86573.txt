this is one of my favorite barefoot contessa recipes. the only thing you should edit is part 2 in the directions: the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt should be sifted before mixed. the melted butter should then be added and blended. and lastly, the eggs, milk, vanilla, and mashed bananas should be combined...then added to the flour/butter mixture. these changes will make quite a differnce in the outcome of these muffins...they are fabulous!

Wow....what a great recipe.  I made some modifications as others suggested:  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour; used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar; substituted buttermilk for the milk.  I also decided to add 1/4 cup wheat germ.  Be certain though to properly combine the ingredients as mentioned in a previous review - dry ingredients mixed first, melted butter added to the dry ingredients.  Combine the eggs, milk, and vanilla and add next.  Finally, fold in mashed bananas, chopped bananas, granola, nuts, coconut, and wheat germ.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I don't doubt this recipe ROCKS as is, but I am a diabetic.  I made a few "healthy" changes.  I used 2 cup freshly ground wheat flour, 3/4 cup of unbleached all-purpose and 1/4 cup of milled flax seed INSTEAD of 3 cups of all-purpose.  I added 1/2tsp more baking powder.  I also used 1 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of splenda brown sugar blend INSTEAD of the 2 cups of white sugar.  I also did as one of the reviewers said and mixed the butter into the dry ingredients before mixing in all the wet.  I made these as heart shaped mini muffins for valentines breakfast for my children.  Oh yummy!  I can't tell you how very good these are!  They are also VERY filling.  My bottomless pit otherwise known as our 14 year old son could only eat 3 of these mini muffins (VERY unusual).

This recipe is AMAZING (even though it's a recipe from the Barefoot Contessa). Definitely follow the suggestions from MADISONRAE -  the muffins will have a different texture if you mix them as instructed. The directions here are fine - just produce a different muffin. The flavor is wonderful and they turn out great every time! OH - AND DON'T FILL THE MUFFIN CUPS TO THE TOP!!! You'll have a huge mess. They do rise to fill the muffin cups - just fill them 2/3 full. SO GOOD! ***UPDATE*** Made these again tonight with 3 cups whole wheat flour, half butter half applesauce, eggbeaters instead of eggs - SO SO GOOD!!! You can't go wrong with these!

Very delicious recipe!  I added some chocolate chips b/c I didn't have enough nuts, so just to add some variety to the texture.  They were very nice.  One reviewer said to fill to the to since they don't fluff up a lot, but when I did that they just spilled out all over the oven.  So from then on I filled only 1/2 to 2/3 full!

A 5 stars plus! Moist, full bodied, very filling and banana-y. Barefoot Contessa is also one of my favorite cooking shows and I watched this episode where she made this and I couldn't wait to bake these muffins. What I did do slightly different is use 3 cups whole wheat flour, buttermilk instead of milk and I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp of banana extract. After I filled my muffin cups almost 2/3 ways, (they do rise up a little)I gently inserted a couple of banana chips into the muffin tops, breaking some, and sprinkling all over the top as well. These baked exactly 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I did end up with 36 muffins. My house smelled of bananas...MMmm. I think the buttermilk really helped as these muffins were just so moist, and there is a nice wonderful crunch factor from all of the quaker oats granolas, banana chips and walnuts. I can taste a little of the sweetened coconut flakes (nice!). Overall an easy recipe to put together with wonderful results! A definite keeper!

These are really nice muffins! One important word of advice, though: cut down the sugar!!! I halved the sugar and they were still super sweet. Next time I will add even less. The granola adds sweetness, the banana adds sweetness and the coconut adds sweetness... so, really, you don't need 2 cups of sugar! Otherwise, I followed to a T, except for using 3/4 cup olive oil in place of the 1 cup butter. I sprinkled granola over the tops of the muffins before baking, which made them look really appetizing and pretty. Will make again, with less sugar. Thank you!

These were GREAT!  I had some frozen bananas that I wanted to use up (little tip for those of you who don't know what to do with your very ripe bananas is to freeze them and save them for cake and muffin recipes...not only is there no waste of them but the sugars are perfect for recipes like this! :) )and my granola turned out to be flavored with strawberry so I substituted a cup of quick oats for it.  They came out amazing!  I did have to add about 7 minutes baking time, but that could be just my oven.  I think that everyone's oven is different anyway and you just need to bake them until they have a nice brown appearance.  Going to take an Easter Basket full of them to work tomorrow...the guys love baked goods!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipes....I will make again for sure :)

very good base....but I made some changes to make it more heathly...
did a combo of 1 c white flour & 2 cups whole wheat, added 1/4 c of ground flax seed, used 1 cup sugar (instead of 2 cups), 5 small ripe bananas (smashed) & used 3/4 c. canola oil.  Omitted the walnuts & banana chips.  My kids really loved them & me too!! Nice & lite.

I have made few modifications to make the muffins healthier and it turned out well. Here they are: 1. I used 3 cups of ORGANIC WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR instead of white flour, 2. I used 1 CUP RAW CANE SUGAR instead of 2 cups white, 3. I used POWDERED SOY MILK within the dry ingredients and added WATER where the recipe calls for milk. Be sure to add a little extra liquid because of the whole wheat flour (bran makes it absorb more liquid), 4. instead of butter I used apple-carrot purée. Other than that I followed the recipe and I must say that these are my favorite muffins so far. Thank you for the recipe

I thought that this recipe was really good. All the ingredients were simple so they were very easy to make. I also used chocolate chips insted of granola and I used pecans insted of walnuts. I turned out very tasty:)

Really delicious, but certainly not "healthy". With 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of butter this muffin is sure to please the taste buds, but add pounds to any waistline.

I've been wanting to try this recipe for quite a while, but have never found myself with the right ingredients on hand. I finally did and made them, with a few changes. I made them healthier by replacing half the flour with whole wheat flour and half the butter with organic canola oil. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. I love the crunchiness of the banana chips on top!

I didn't add the walnuts as I didn't have any, or the dried bananas on top - I did add vanilla pudding as that tends to keep my muffins moist.  GREAT recipe thanks for sharing!

Very good I only changed the sugar to 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Also added some raisins. The banana chips on the top really set them off. I used the large muffins pans and made 12 cook them 28 min.

VERY good!  I used up the last of my walnuts and pecans.  Added chocolate chips instead of granola.  I didn't make banana chips.  But I used 3 mashed bananas.  Another great way to use up over ripened bananas!

I just needed to use some bananas, so I tried this recipe. My husband is the banana eater in the family, and he thought these were great. ONLY THING: It is better to be cautious than overambitious with this batter. When filling the cups, aim for somewhere between half full and three-quarters full. These puppies rise! Also, old fashioned oats are fine as a replacement for granola, and it's best to follow the advice of another reviewer when mixing the ingredients. She knows what she's talking about!

These turned out great! I followed the recipe pretty closely but made a few adjustments used in another review and sifted all the dry ingredients first. I also Used pecans instead of walnuts as what I thought were walnuts in the freezer were pecans! Also in place of granola I used oats. These were fantastic! I will make again!

I love this recipe!  I love it even more when I make a recipe for the first time and it turns out delicious!  The only substitution I made was using pastry flour instead of all purpose flour.  They seemed to be more tender or softer than other muffins I've made in the past, as this was my first time using pastry flour.  I think I may use it for muffins from now on.  Now if I could only get my muffins to rise when baking...

Very tasty! I didn't have any granola so I substituted some Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Net time I'll had add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter, it goes well with chocolate. I also added an extra small banana because when I was pulling the banana off, that one broke open. This recipe made way more than 24, though, it actually made 36 regular sized muffins. And I didn't know I was out of muffin paper so I just sprayed the muffin tin with baking PAM and they came out perfectly. Since it made so many I plan on freezing half of them and keeping the others in an airtight container to have the the news few days. Oh, and one more thing. The batter is SOOOO good! YUM! And this coming from someone who is not a batter/cookie dough eating kind of girl, either. So yummy!

Oh my goodness these are just so delicious.  Pretty sure this is the recipe I will be using again and again.    I followed the recipe exactly, but no changes at all and baked for 20 minutes.  They came out perfect, the muffin is so moist and flavourful in every bite.  Thank you for sharing!!!

I did  make some changes.. here they are:
- I used whole wheat flour (not white)
- I used an extra banana (used 4)
- added 1/2 cup sliced and hand-crushed almonds
- added a bit more coconut.
- added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract (it helps bring out flavors in banana and oats)
- made a topping consisting of; granola, oats, flour and coconut... I sprinkled that generously on each muffin pre-baking

That all been said, my nephew thought these were awesome (and didnt know they were kinda healthy). he is almost 10. My almost 5 year niece came up to me and told me they were great. My almost 2 year old kept asking for them over and over again.. he'd eat 3 in a row if I let him (which I did). I have made this recipe 3 times now in teh last month and it came out excellent and got wonderful reviews. Thanks so much!

I made this recipe using grape nuts cereal instead of granola because that's what I had around the house. The resulting crunch was excellent, but the grape nuts tend to get stuck in your teeth! So I would use granola next time. I followed others' advice on how to mix the ingredients and it worked great. I added a quarter cup of wheat germ, decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup, and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour + 2 cups of white flour. The result was a very healthy tasting and delicious muffin. Serve hot with a bit of natural peanut butter spread across, mmmm mmm good.

Reduced the sugar by about a half cup and didn't miss it.  Also made without granola and they turned out fine.  Used three mashed bananas instead of slicing the third. Would add cinnamon.

I made a few modifications due to lack of ingredients but they came out delicious! I didn't have butter, so I used 1/2 cup of canola oil; the muffins came out slightly dry but that is my own doing (I should have used 1 cup or added apple sauce to make up the difference). I added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp cloves. I didn't have coconut, granola or banana chips, but I did add 1/2 cup raisins and 1 cup oats. Next time I think I will substitute apple sauce for all the butter and hopefully it will turn out more moist.

Hands down without a doubt the best muffins every time I make them.  Everyone comes running when the dinger goes.  I don't use the banana chips and because of an allergy I use Pecans instead of walnuts.  They are always delicious, sweet and moist! Great MUFFINS!!!!!!

Excellent base recipe to use and follow several users recommendations. Thanks to other users and this recipe, we're enjoying a rockin' banana nut muffin. The coconut is a fabulous addition to the traditional banana nut recipe. I also followed the recommendations to use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour and sifted these dry ingredients which resulted in a superb texture!!!

As written, this is a very good recipe. Next time, though, I will omit the granola and coconut and just make it a banana muffin. I used sour cream in place of the milk with terrific results. I think this muffin recipe would be very adaptable...think blueberry & lemon, orange & chocolate, raspberry & white chocolate, cherry & almond, peaches and cream cheese, apple & carrot, pineapple & mango...

These were super awesome, and I made all the changes suggested by other reviewers to make them healthier. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, 2 of all purpose, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown. I only used 1/2 cup of melted butter, and 1/2 cup applesauce. I mixed dry ing, then added butter, then wet, then at the end I added the coconut, finely chopped pecans :) and some finely shredded carrot and a smidge of mini chocolate chips.. they were awesome, and on the healthy side for my 2 year old.

They were really good.  I used 1 C whole wheat flour, 1/2 C almond flour, and 1 1/2 all-purpose flour.  I also cut the sugar to 1 C and it came out great.  The granola I used did not come out chewy, it was small chunks of granola and that might have made the difference.

Fabulous!  I used brown sugar, and probably not even a full cup of it.  I realized I didn't have coconut so I skipped that but threw in some dates.  I found mine had to cook for 30 minutes because they are very thick.  But these are probably the best muffins I have ever had.

I cut this recipe in half and used 50/50 whole wheat/all purpose flour(and canola oil as it produces better results with whole wheat.) My muffins were really light textured and very sweet with great banana flavor and a crispy brown top. At 25 minutes they were quite browned but not done in the center, so I would reduce the baking temperature to 325 and increase the time a bit. The recipe should be more specific on which type of coconut to use - unsweetened or sweetened. I assume it's supposed to be unsweetened, but it doesn't say one way or the other. I used sweetened as it's all I had. That may have contributed to the baking issue I had. I was really hoping for the promised crunch, but the granola (I used home made) melted into the muffins and the only crunch was from the walnuts. The coconut added some interest though, and this recipe IS a treat for the tastebuds.

I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and compensated the rest of butter with oil.  I didn't have milk so I used 1/2 cup condensed milk and 1/4 cup water.  Didn't have banana chips so sprinkled the top with more granola mix.  It came out delicious!

Wonderful recipe made as stated.  I use Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch for the granola.  But I love to play around with substituing ingredients (adding flax seed, using whole wheat flour, brown sugar, etc.)  All the reviews give lots of ideas.  I have made this into mini loaves and worked fine, but like it best as muffins.

Amazing! however I made a few adjustments: I used about 1/2 cup sugar, substituted the butter entirely with sweetened applesauce, and used oatmeal instead of granola. Also I extended the baking time to 30 minutes. The taste of this muffin is perfect! Way better then the store bought "freshly baked" kind!! If possible, don't skip out on the coconut because it really makes a difference!

These muffins turned out moist, light and fluffy. My only complaint was that it was too sweet. 1 1/3 cups of sugar is plenty. That and the walnuts and banana chips were the only things I changed since we're not big on nuts in baked goods and I didn't have any of the chips on hand. I'll defiantly be making this again! It's a nice way to get rid of overripe bananas. :)

I just wish I would've discovered this recipe earlier!  I made a couple of changes based on reviews:  cut butter down to 1.5 sticks and added 1 cup sour cream.  Because I didn't have granola, I just cut up a couple of roasted almond granola bars to make 1 cup.

These are definitely the best banana muffins I've made!  Very moist!  I used 1 1/2 cups each of white and whole wheat flour, and did 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/4 cup white.  I substituted 1 cup applesauce for the butter.  Since the granola I had on hand already had almonds & coconut in it, I didn't add more.  I also only made 18 huge muffins.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was awesome!  Very moist and flavorfull.  I did fill up the muffin tins more than the recipe stated to make slightly larger muffins - they still baked the same amount of time.  I didn't use the coconut flakes and I also didn't use the "banana chips" on top (just don't like the fake flavor of those).  I did add 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger for alittle extra zing.  My family loved these -- we will be making these again for sure!  Enjoy

These are moist, tender, & full of flavor. I added another egg, another cup of flour, used oats instead of granola, & part sour cream with the milk. I didn't add coconut or banana chips, and I pureed all the bananas. This recipe made 13 jumbo muffins for me. I'll be using this often!

These muffins were delicious.  My husband raved over them, and the whole family really enjoyed them.  I did make a couple of changes - I used buttermilk, as suggested in another review.  I also did not have granola, so I used Nature Valley Granola cereal, which worked perfectly.  Delicious!

Delicious recipe but did a few of my own substitutions of course. No walnuts, so I doubled the granola. Sprinkled the tops with granola and coconut. Reduced vanilla to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of almond extract. YUMMMMMMM and they look divine!

WOW!!!  Even my 5yr old who hates bananas loved these muffins!  I used half wheat flour and I omitted the granola since I didn't have any.  I added a few milk chocolate chips.  So good!

These tasted very "healthy," although I did make some changes: whote wheat flour instead of white flour, splenda instead of sugar, half the butter, no nuts or banana chips  (banana chips are VERY fatty!) and  double the granola.  I used Bear Naked vanilla almond granola and used an almond to top the muffin.  I think they could have been sweeter, or had more spices, like cinnamon or nutmeg.  Otherwise, great base recipe, and looked great.  I used my kitchenaid muffin pan sprayed with crisco non-stick baking spray (butter flavor with flour) and I didn't need to use muffin cups.  They just popped right out beautifully!

I just finished making this recipe and I am enjoying eating the warm muffins with a glass of milk.....ohhhh my goodness, they are absolutely out of this world! I did change a few things for health's sake but they are still the best muffins I've ever made.

I substituted brown sugar for white sugar and whole wheat flour for white flour. I also cut the butter by half and added 2 tablespoons of oil instead, until the mixture was thick yet moist.  Since i didn't have coconut, i added 1 cup of mini marshmallows and some leftover wheat germ that I had in my pantry (1/4 cup).  I took them out of the oven when they were beginning to brown, after roughly 19 minutes. They are absolutely spectacular, the brown sugar is a great substitution I think.

An excellent recipe but I was wondering if I could reduce the butter and still get a similar result.  The taste is excellent but you do know that there is butter in the recipe.  For 1/2 the batter I added choc. chips and for the other 1/2 I added fresh blueberries - around 1 cup of blueberries.  The blueberry muffins were the best of the two. Also added the cinnamon, nutmeg and reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp. Will definitely be making these again.  Thank You.

These muffins were fabulous.  I made them for a group of people and every single one of them loved them.  I took the advice of others and used 1 c. whole wheat flour and 2 c. all-purpose.  I also added a second chopped banana and I decreased the walnuts a few Tbsp so that I could add some wheat germ.  Gave the muffins a healthful flavor.  One note - if you want them to have a "crunch" they need to be eaten after baking.  The next day they were super moist and yummy, just not crunchy anymore.

These are wonderful muffins!  I used some whole wheat flour (about 1/3 whole wheat and 2/3 white), which gave them a heartier texture.  I also used half brown sugar and half white--I might cut down on the sugar next time, as these were very sweet, but then again, maybe not--they were very good!

Added 2.5 bananas and topped with shredded coconut instead of the banana. Next time I'll have to adjust the sugar because my shredded coconut was already sweetened and the muffins were just a bit too sweet because of that.

Thanks to everyone for their tips about sifting the dry ingredients first, then mixing in the butter, followed by the wet ingredients.  Worked well.  I also only used 1 cup of sugar and found the muffins were plenty sweet.  I ended up using chopped almonds instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand, and I added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract with the 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I also used light cooconut milk in place of the 3/4 milk...worked very well.  These are moist lovely muffins.  Will definitely make these again.

4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. 1/2c. sugar and 1/2c. brown sugar, 3 mashed bananas, and cinnamon.  I also substituted oatmeal for the granola because I didn't have any.  Very, very good! Moist and very flavorful!  Definitely making again!

DEEEE-LICIOUS! These are now my favorite muffins!!! So moist & tasty. It was hard not to eat all the batter... I only substituted granola for oats & coconut for chocolate chips (since I have a 2 1/2 year old). The are the most delicious muffins! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are very moist and delicious muffins! I made  few minor alterations to accomodate the ingredients I had. I used an extra banana (mashed half and chopped half), I used quick oats instead of granola, sweetened coconut so I cut out half a cup of sugar, and only about 1/4 cup of walnuts. My husband and his coworkers couldn't believe there was coconut in these muffins! They loved the muffins despite their distaste for coconut! :)

These were more tasty without the banana chips added on top. Very moist and fluffy. I expected they would be heavy so the fluffiness was a surprise. While there is lots of good for you stuff in them they are really high in calories and fat. I will make this again though!

These are the best banana muffins I have ever tasted. I made mine with 3 Oats & Hunny granola bars (used food processor) ground up. I even added some granola on the very top of the muffin mixture and then baked them. Thank you for an amazing recipe!! I added a picture too :)

These were very good! I omited a few things like I didn't put in granola, I used chopped  pecans in place of walnuts and didn't use banana chips. But I think the chips or banana frosting would make a good topping and push this right up to five! These are great to make for anytime.

These muffins were phenomenal!!  I admit I subbed old-fashioned oats for the granola, making for a chewier rather than crunchier muffin.  Next time I have granola on hand, I will make this recipe as written, and I'm sure the muffins will be off-the-charts delicious. The combination of mashed & chopped banana with the addition of coconut gives these muffins lots of flavor and a distinctly hearty texture.  The added crunch of the granola certainly would make the muffins outstanding.  Once you try them, you'll never want to make another banana muffin!  Thank you, Harajukwa.  I will be making this recipe over and over.

Very good, used the suggestions of others and they came out very moist and tasty, the entire family loved these.They also stayed fresh for a couple of days and did not lose their flavor. Next time I will try these w/ the banana chips.

Giving credit where it's due, this is identical to the Barefoot Contessa (Ina Garten) recipe. With that, I will say the recipe is exceptional. While I didn't get the crown I like to see on the muffins, the taste and texture is very appealing and delicious. I forgot to add fresh banana chunks, but it still turned out great! I decided to use some leftover caramel and ganache toppings to make the tops a little prettier and use up the toppings. Yum! Great crunch and texture with the granola, walnuts, and coconut!

Will not be making these again.  Texture was way to mushy and didn't like the hard bits of banana chips on top.  Sorry.

OMG! What a wonderful muffin!!!!  I only change very few things.  Used 1c. of Splenda and 1 of brown sugar. Omitted the coconut at our family does'nt like and used granola with chocolate bits.  Super good and very simple.  Made them with my son and it was a hit!!!!!

I also used 2 c white flour and 1 c whole wheat flour, and 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. These tasted amazing! I didn't really care for the granola, and the coconut made the muffin way too sweet for me. Next time, I will just double the walnuts.

Wow!  These are the best banana muffins I've ever made.  Probably even the best I've ever tasted.  I've made many different recipes for banana muffins/banana bread and none were all that remarkable.  Finally I've found a recipe I will use again and again.  I actually cut the sugar down to a cup, but then when the first batch came out, they were good but I thought it could use a little more sugar.  I added some more and it made the difference.

Fantastic! I used whole wheat flour instead of white, used 1/4 cup of olive oil and the rest fat free sour cream and pecans instead of walnuts. I used 3 mashed bananas instead of chopping one and i left out the banana chips. In half the batch i added chocolate chips. Both were fantastic! will definately make again and again!!!

I made these this morning because I finally had some granola to use! I've been waiting months to try this. I wish I'd made this recipe sooner.

None of my boys like walnuts or coconut, so I omitted them and upped the granola a bit. Everything else I kept the same, besides cutting the recipe in half to make 12. I did half of the recipe in full-size and the other half mini-sized.

These are amazing. The granola keeps a little of it's crunch which is a nice contrast to the smooth consistancy of the muffin and since I quartered the cut banana called for in the recipe, you get a little bit of banana in each bite.

I will SO be making these again. These will be good to bring to a bake sale or 
my son's snack days.

These muffins were very tasty. I added chocolate chips to about half of them and they were soooooo good. My only small criticism would be that they seemed to dry out more quickly than other muffins I had made that same day and stored the same way. Next time I will probably store them differently.

It works so much better to mix the dry ingredients and  the wet ingredients separately and then stir together. Also, these weren't the moist-est muffins I've made. I will make again due to the ingredients are all favorites and great for using up leftovers in the pantry (I always seem to have over-ripe bananas and a partial bag of coconut). Also, I added a topping mix of brown sugar & oats for a little crunch and sweetness, that I thought this recipe needed.

This was the best banana bread I have ever had. I did make some adjustments. for the butter I used 1/2c of Smart balance(1stick) and 1/2c apple sauce.  For the flour I used 1c of white flour and 2c of whole wheat gram flour and the banana chips I mixed with coconut shavings and sprinkled on top. The rest was just to recipe and It was great. I will make it again and again.

This muffin is Da' Bomb!  It is sweet, yet crunchy.  My two kids made them by themselves (ages 7 & 10) and they turned out great.  Obviously a no fail recipe!
I didn't have enough granola so I had them substitute grapenuts cereal which worked out well.  I also omitted the coconut since I didn't have any.  YUMMY!!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't add walnuts or coconut, though.  I did as others suggested and mixed the dry ingredients (I used 1 c whole wheat and 2 c white flour), substituting 1/2 c Splenda in place of a bit of the sugar, then added the butter (I used 1/2 butter, 1/4 c olive oil, 1/4 cup canola oil), beat the egg and mixed with the milk and then added to the dry ingredients.  I then added four mashed bananas, 1/3 c wheat germ, and 1 cup Kashi Orchard Spice granola.  It was a little thin, so I added 1/4 cup more flour.  I divided the batter in half and stirred in some frozen blackberries, raspberries and blueberries to one portion.  The recipe made two large loaves and two small ones.  Both were wonderful!

I am not sure what I did wrong because I have never been much of a baker. The muffins had a good flavor, but were flat. They  did not rise above the top of muffin pan when I baked them. I used all ingredients...whatever. They did not look like the picture for sure.

Wow, this recipe is good. I wasnt even going to make them because im not much of a muffing person, but when i found them here i decided i would, because i had saved them on food network(barefoot contessa recipe)I pounded granola bars real small.  I didnt have walnuts or coconut, but i wouldnt put coconut in it anyway because i dont like the stringy texture it gives. Plus the granola gave it such a great crunch. It was awesome. I filled them all the way to the top so the tops could be big. I topped with finely crushed granola and rice cereal. THey looked soooo beautiful!thx!

Great muffins. Decreased sugar to one cup white, 1/2 cup brown. Replaced butter with applesauce to make more healthy and still turned out great. Doubled the granola and omitted nuts, coconut and banana chips. Thanks!

Even with substituting muesli for granola and grapenuts for walnuts this recipe was amazing.  The muffins rise up beautifully, look, smell and taste great.  I don't always have success with muffins, but I will definitely make these ones again.

My family LOVED this recipe.  My husband, 2 yr old, 5 yr old and me.  Didn't have granola so I substituted oatmeal.  I made both med. size cupcakes (20 min. was perfect) and made mini cupcakes - cooked for 18 min.

Will be making again!!

Flavor wise these are excellent muffins. I omit the banana chips because i didn't want them. 2 things I will do different next time, 1 only fill them 1/2 way. They didn't fluff up and stay up, they went flat and spread all over the top of the muffin tins and it was so hard to get them out. #2 I will use muffin papers next time.

These are the best!  I had to substitute the eggs for 1 tbsp ground flaxseed with 3 tbsp warm water for each egg due to my daughter being allergic to eggs, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  No more premade muffin mixes for this family...this one is going into my permenant recipe box.  Will definitely be making these again!

Yummy muffins!  Sweet, banana-y, and interesting with the coconut addition.  Did not care for the granola as it did not stay crunchy, even when out of the oven for only an hour or so.  I'll skip the granola next time.  My recipe yielded 18 muffins, then with the extra batter I made a little loaf cake.  Only change was to sprinkle some brown sugar on the top of the loaf, but it sort of sank into the mix while baking.  I would recommend toppings, definitely, for presentation.  Half my muffins were in paper cups, the rest without, and I prefer the paper cups for less mess.  

Also, as someone suggested, I mixed in the melted butter to the dry ingredients first, and it did not really make sense to me.  I'll go back to my old ways of baking next time, and see if there is any difference.

The only reason why I didnt give this recipe 5 stars is because I changed a couple of things.I made 3 dozen so the 3 bananas just werent gonna cut it,so I used 5,no walnuts no coconut but added extra granola.These were absolutely delicious. I froze the majority and take them out as needed for my husband and boy does he love them.They hold up so well even after being frozen for a week.This is now my new recipe and have already made them twice.Thanks for the post.

Fantastic muffins!  These were soooo good.  I had no granola so added a bit more coconut & the walnuts along with a handfull of chocolate chips that needed using.  They came out fluffy and good!  Will be putting in my permanant rotation!

Very tasty, with a nice banana flavor. I didn't have any granola, so I used Special K cereal instead. They still had a nice crunch to them. I would make these again when I have ripe bananas to use up.

i thought this recipe was delish! I made a few changes..substituted 1 cup of sugar for splenda and 1/2 of the other for brown sugar. I also used a vanilla flavored granola cereal and used chocolate chips..These were a hit i would say! You can vary up and play with the addiional ingredients no problem..but it did only make 18 small for me..thank you i will make these often

Love this easy banana muffin recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2 and increased the milk slightly to compensate for the reduced liquid.  Next time I might use 1 stick of butter and applesauce to reduce the fat content.  I didn't have coconut, which would have been fantastic and instead I used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I used my Bear Naked granola that I loved and the results speak for themselves.  This is a muffin that everyone will love because it is so different. The granola adds a surprisingly good texture and unexpected taste that I just love!

These are sooooo delicious! I made them tonight because I had bananas that I wanted to use up. I cut the recipe in half (I used 2 small bananas). I did not have the nuts or granola on hand...but they were still delicious. I look forward to trying them with those ingredients added as well.

This recipe made a ton! I got 24 muffins plus a medium loaf of bread out of just one batch. I liked the loaf better than the muffins, but probably because I baked it until it was only JUST tan colored, rather than golden brown. It stayed more moist that way. The banana chips to the top didn't add anything to these, however.

I made these muffins when I was looking for a tasty healthy snack for my two-year-old. I thought they were pretty good, but he didn't care for the crunch. I can't eat them all alone, so I'm looking for a new snack idea. Good recipe!

These are great! This is a pretty fail-proof recipe, as I had to pinch hit quite a few things: I used soy milk, powdered eggs (so convenient!), only 1 banana, trail mix instead of granola and almonds instead of walnuts. I also did half brown / half white sugar, and I toasted the almonds and coconut first. Next time I'll skip the liners, since they kept the muffins from getting the all-over crust that I like. These are sweet and rich, but not overly so ~ my kind of muffin!

I didn't have a problem with them being too sweet, but I substituted Splenda for the sugar so that might be why. The muffins were good, but if I make these again, I'll put an extra banana in.

This is a little too sweet for my liking, but everyone loves them!  I might use less sugar next time because the bananas are sooo sweet.  I used 1/2 unbleached flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour, skim milk, Bear Naked Banana Nut granola (naturally sweetened, purchased at Costco, but usually available at natural food stores), unsweetened coconut, and I picked banana chips out of the granola as toppers.  They are plenty moist, but didn't rise very much, so I would fill your tin to the top, I only filled 2/3 full.  I will probably make this again, though it doesn't seem any better than my regular banana nut muffin recipe.

Delicious. I didn’t change a thing and everyone loved them. But that’s just me, if I’m short on time, I don’t take chances...One note: only fill muffin liners halfway.  Also, my yield was around 18.

These turned out delicious and just what I wanted for a breakfast muffin!  Food Fanatic's review had good suggestions so that's what I followed. My extra exception was using coconut oil instead of butter, because I was out. Using half the sugar was just right for us and because we are at a high altitude, I added 5 minutes to the baking time.

Didn’t make any changes ... just loved these!  I can also see these as a base for other combos - maybe skip the chopped banana and add in dried pineapple or cherries ... the flavor combos are endless, and these are moist and flavorful enough to stand up to different add-ins. Can’t wait for next batch!

This looked like a good recipe, but decided to screw around with  it  a bunch...just for fun.  Used 1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and almond extract. Added two oatmeal breakfast packets and 1/4 cup  oil in addition to the butter. Didn't use chocolate chips in this batch. Added 1/4 yogurt.

I sifted all the dry ingredients together first, substituted light brown sugar for white and whole wheat flour for white.  Then II blended the eggs, milk ,  vanilla and cooled melted butter before adding to the dry mixture.  Then a carefully folded in the mashed bananas, the chopped bananas, granola, nuts and coconut.  I didn't have banana chips, plan to use them in the future!  I suggest using paper liners in the muffin pan, makes for easier clean up of pan later!  I love this recipe--was up late making it!

Made these muffins following the recipe.  These were very good. Only thing I would do differently is cut back on the sugar as they were a bit too sweet.

I had all the ingredients, including the banana chips, which is a miracle... I followed the recipe to a T, adding the melted butter to the flour as per other reviewers, and that is about it. It is SO SO DELICIOUS! For MY taste, I would next time add some WHEAT flour to make it a little heartier... harder... it very super fluffy like a cake.

Instead of white flour I made a blend of brown rice/oatmeal flour, exchanged the 2 cups of white sugar for 1 cup of coconut sugar and some stevia and used 3/4C half and half melted butter/coconut oil.  blend the wet ingredients and then the dy before mixing together, much better.

I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for half the butter.  Next time I will just use 1 1/2 cup of sugar. Baked (cupcake size) perfect in 22 minutes, 25 minutes in my oven would have burnt them. I used granola oatmeal and it did not stay crunchy but added a little texture.

Very delicious muffins!  I followed MADISONRAE's review and followed the directions as she stated.  My granola was the Honey Bunches of Oats Granola and I left out the banana chips because I didn't have any. I just want to suggest only filling the muffin cups 2/3 full.  I filled my first batch to the top and as they made beautiful tops I had to bake them for 5 min extra.  After letting them cool for 5 min. in the pan they had to be gently persuaded out.  If not the tops would come right off.  Filling them only 2/3 full the baking time was exactly 25 min. and lifted right out after cooling.  I ended up with 30 muffins.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

These muffins are the best! (Ughh! My diet came to nothing!!!) Bananas, walnuts and coconut make a perfect team. I halved this recipe and got 9 appetizing crispy muffins (2,5 oz/70 g each). I didn't add walnuts, as my granola has them. Will definitely do them again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous. It was so yummy that I made a second batch and shared with friends. They loved them. They were moist and I loved the crunch. I am not a fan of coconut, but it added a great flavor. The banana chips were great as a garnishment. Many people complain that they are too sweet, but I found them to be semi-sweet. Overall, it gets a well deserved rating of 5.

This has become my go-to recipe for Banana Muffins. I never have banana chips on hand, so I always leave out that ingredient. They are EXTREMELY TASTY! I would recommend these if you are looking for are looking for a treat muffin as opposed to a healthy muffin ;)

Great muffins! I used half veggie oil and half applesauce to replace the butter.  Omitted the granola and walnuts.  I added shredded coconut to half of the recipe so I could see which tasted better, with or without.  Coconut definitely adds a nice texture to the muffin. Thanks HARAJUKUWA!

Real good, did as others suggested, exchanged a cup of white flour for wheat, only 1amd a half cubes of butter, added 1/4c wheat germ, 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/4c white sugar. Lessond baking time by 5 minutes for my oven. Dry first, then butter then wet then fold in the rest. Yummy!!

Wonderful recipe!  A real crowd pleaser!  My only suggestion is to follow the suggestion from MADISONRAE on Jun. 29, 2005.  This makes a world of difference!  I always leave out the nuts and omit the banana chips and they turn out perfect every time with a great texture on top.

This is NOT healthy but it is so fabulous.  Add flavored granola for more fun but leave out the banana chips and don't use as much sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that these were some of the most flavorful muffins that I have ever made! I opted not to put the banana chips on top and left the top plain. The inside was moist and cake-like, and I have found my definitive banana muffin!

I changed 3 things.  No walnuts because family does not like nuts, and no banana chips because I did not have them.  Added a few Guittard milk chocolate chips to each muffin by pushing them in the batter.  These were yummy but definitely a dessert item.  I like the basic batter though.  The melted butter instead of typical vegetable oil makes a lighter tastier muffin.  Next time I will try some suggested healthy variations to make it more of a breakfast on the run item.

This is absolutely yummy! I did some adjustments. Reduced 1 cup of butter to 1/2 and sub 1/2 with apple sauce. Reduced sugar to 1 cup. Increase banana to 5 (because that was what I had in the freezer). It was delicious!!!!

Fantastic!  Love these muffins!  Like lots of others, I made a few modifications, 2 c. ww flour, 1 c. ap flour, 1 c brown sugar and 1/2 c. white, reducing the butter to a 1/2 c - cutting it into the the dry ingredients until it looked like crumbs.  Then to compensate for the reduction in butter, I added a 1/2c. applesauce to the wet ingredients and mixed until just moistened - and then added the remaining ingredients.  I think being careful not to overmix does help these muffins rise, but even so mine still didn't get any higher than what was pictured.  For the granola, I had "Megan's Granola" from this site already made - which is great on it's own, and wonderful paired with this.  Also didn't top the muffins with the banana chips - used bright white sparkling sugar instead. Really pretty and delicious!

I made these tonight... used the 1 c whole wheat/2 c white flour as others mentioned, also used only 1 c purecane sugar and it was perfect. I completely forgot to add the granola, though I had planned on Oats instead (forgot those too)  I only used 2 mashed ripe bananas since that's what I had on hand, and I added some Butterscotch chips just because I love them and with that they were delicious. So this recipe can work with variations. I may try the actual recipe, but what I baked up was yummy!

i followed this recipe to a tee and loved it, but then i thought "why not add in a bit of chocolate" as i do with nearly all my recipes ... try adding a bar or two of broken up chocolate (galaxy cookie is my preferred choice) and serve warm with butter melted on for a yummy treat.

Excellent!  I made it without eggs (only because I didn't have any today--oops!) and it was still great!  The texture likely would have been more fluffy with eggs, but I was surprised at how nicely these held together even without.  I did sub approximately 1 T of mayo per 1 egg (I halved the recipe).  I also substituted applesauce for half the butter.    I sprinkled some extra chopped nuts and coconut on the top of each muffin, which made them prettier and added crunch.    YUM!!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

The muffins were moist, not crumbly and tasted very good! They are also pretty healthy.

These muffins were excellent and easy to make (and I am by no means adept at baking). I did follow the recommendations with regard to the order of ingredients, as well as, using wheat flour and white flour and using two mashed bananas (I cut the recipe in half, because it's just me). I did not use any granola or oatmeal (just didn't feel like it), but next time I will add either to give the muffins a different texture. However, with these deletions and modifications, the muffins were very moist and flavorful.

I made these for work, with some suggestions from other reviewers: used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 AP; decreased overall sugar to 1/3c white & 2/3 c. packed brown; used buttermilk instead of milk; used cranberry almond granola and added extra almonds & cranberries instead of coconut & walnuts, and added chocolate chips. They were very tasty, and everyone told me they loved them, but I thought they were a little dry. I would probably have added another mashed banana. A little drizzle of cream cheese icing on top was the perfect finish. Actually made 24 reg muffins and 12 mini muffins.

Very nice muffins! They were very sweet. I did replace the granola with oats as I didn't have any granola on hand. I also omitted the banana chips as I don't care for them. But the muffins were very moist and quite sweet. WIll surely make this again.

Very good. I used 1/2 cup low fat ricotta and 1/3 cup oil instead of the butter. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and used part white whole wheat for some of the flour. Using only 2 bananas total came out OK too.

These were amazing. I did make one change and added 1/2cup of vanilla yogourt as we like our muffins moist. Everyone thought I bought these from Tim Hortons.  I loved the coconut and my extra picky kids didn't even pick out the nuts. These are going to be made many times in our house.

These are really good!  Follow the advice of other reviewers and add the ingredients in the correct order! (dry, butter, wet, add-ins).  I put a streusel topping on half (streusel from "banana streusel muffins" from this site!). If you decide to use that streusel, do not add the cinnamon.  I liked it, but others might not!  It made more than 24 large (not jumbo) muffins for me!  I will make again and add the coconut which I was out of this time!

Ooooh! VERY good banana muffin with a neat and unusual crunch. I LOVED these (did I say I love these?!!?!?)!!! Made a batch yesterday. I had been craving banana nut muffins all week, and finally got around to making some for myself (my bf HATES bananas - hehe!). I almost followed  HARAJUKUWA'S directions to a T.... I took MADISONRAE and Food Fanatic's advice to sift (thanks MADISONRAE) all dry ingredients, add butter, combine wet ingredients (minus bananas) and add to the dry/butter mixture and then fold in mashed and chopped bananas, walnuts, granola and coconut. Do make sure that your melted butter is cooled to room temperature before adding to the dry ingredients as directed (I don't know if this makes a difference or not, but I wasn't going to risk it...). My only other change was to make a half batch of jumbo sized muffins. I did not need to alter the baking time at all (I thought I might need to, but 25 minutes was perfect!). Mine were a little brown on top, so I covered them with aluminum foil after 15 minutes to prevent from darkening any more. My only complaint is the banana chips... they are a neat idea, but out of place IMHO. I guess I just don't care for how they taste. They were easy to pick off though :) BEWARE: These are VERY rich. I should have made regular sized muffins. One of those would have been perfect (I could only eat half a muffin at a time with a tall glass of milk to wash it down). Thanks for sharing!!!

I love this recipe! I used 3/4cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil, instead of using granola I used Kashi go lean crunch cereal which I added to the flour mixture, and same as other reviewer I mixed the applesauce/oil into the dry ingredients before the rest of the wet ingredients and these muffins turned out wonderful! They taste amazing too, my 3yr old and 5yr old gobbled them up :)
thankyou for this recipe

I made this for 12 servings. For the butter, I substituted 1/2 margarine and 1/2 homemade applesauce. I didn't add nuts or coconut because I used homemade granola, to which I'd already added coconut and almonds. I added an extra 1/2 banana and 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. I reduced sugar by half--used brown instead, and whole wheat flour.

Delicious!!!...I DID NOT follow the recipe exactly. I reduced the sugar to 1 and half cup, and I did not include the extra chopped banana.The muffins came out tasting as if they were made from a box of Betty Crocker muffin mix.

These were really good! I gave it four stars because some people in my family can't eat nuts or coconut, including granola. So I made some without any of that and instead put a crumb topping on them using brown sugar, butter, and flour, a recipe from this site. Then others I added the walnuts and crumb topping, and some others I sprinkled cinnamon on top for extra flavor - they turned out amazing. I highly suggest if you have everything this recipe calls for - use it - it makes it so much better!

These were just ok for my family. I didn't have any granola so I used cooking oats like someone else suggested but I don't think that made that much difference in my family thinking they were just ok. Won't make again... will try a different recipe.

Easily the best muffins I have ever made...
I have never had any luck with muffins, eventhough I bake a lot and everything else turns out great!!!  I decided to try this and am so glad I did!  I did follow the directions from the other reviewer who said to add the butter to the SIFTED dry ingredients, then the egg/milk mixture.  They are moist, tasty, and the perfect brown color.  I am even sending some to my husbands board meeting tomorrow!  Thanks!  This is a keeper!
Note: I went and bought 2 new non-stick muffin pans today before baking and did a test:  One pan of 12 with muffin cups and the other without any.  Definitely use them (I used metal baking cups).  The pan without the cups stuck, but came out with some coersion...

These were a mixed bag.  I liked how the granola added to the texture, but I'd definitely leave the coconut out next time (and I'm a coconut lover, just not in this muffin).  My kids didn't like them much at all, leaving me to eat most of what was a double batch.  I made my half with nuts, which was much better than theirs without (they don't like nuts in anything).  Without nuts, only three stars.

This recipe was delicious! I only had 2 bananas instead of 3, but it still worked well.  I used Post Selects Great Grains cereal with raisins, dates & pecans for the granola and that seemed to work quite well. Yum!

REALLY GOOD and quite easy!  I cut the recipe in half to make 12 muffins and they came out perfect after exactly 25 mins in the oven.  A few small changes though, used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, just prefer brown with bananas.  Had some toasted coconut left over from a cake, so threw that in instead of plain.  And added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Also, used pecans, cause that's what I had on hand.  Didn't have banana chips, but pressed a whole pecan on top and it added a nice touch.  Bonus:  My house smells heavenly :)

These are excellent!  I love them!  I only had two very ripe bananas, so I halved the recipe and just put in the two bananas instead of 1 1/2.  I also didn't add walnuts nor did I have banana chips.  Instead, I sprinkled a bit more granola on top of the muffins and baked.  I really like the crunchiness from the granola and the banana flavor comes through nicely.  Thanks!

OMG these are the best banana muffins I have ever made! Didn't add the walnuts 'cause I didn't have any, so I added just a little extra granola. WOW! It made a lot more than 24, so I added a couple of elderly peaches, peeled and chopped. Reallt, really good!

I am a coconut fan & am always looking for fun, easy recipes with coconut in it & this was it! The combination of banana & coconut were delicious & I never would have thought to put them together. The muffins were gone in 2 days here. Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe.

We love, love, love this recipe!  Absolutely delicious!  I made a few changes to it because of a lack of ingredients but they still came out fantastic.  I added a 1/2 choc. chips instead of banana chips and because I didn't have any granola on hand, I added Honey Bunches of Oats cereal instead.  My daughter made these for our local 4-H fair and won Champion and they will now be judged at our State Fair in August!  Thank you for a divine recipe!  We'll let you know if it wins Champion at State.  Yummy!

Very good! Very sugary; my family liked the muffins but they were a little too sweet for my liking. I made some changes: I used whole oat flour and brown sugar, omitted the coconut, (I didn't have any)and I used ricemilk and omitted the eggs because of an allergy in my family. I also used an additional cup of milk in place of the melted butter because 1 cup of melted butter is getting a little bit too rich for my taste. Overall, great recipe! I will most likely make again. 5 stars; thanks submitter.

This is my new favorite Banana Muffin recipe!  I totally forgot to add the 1 cup of melted butter and the vanilla, PLUS instead of the granola, I added two packets of the cinnamon flavored Quaker instant oatmeal and they still tasted fantastic.  Slightly crunchy on the outside with great flavor!  I made three more batches just to use up my bananas, but this time I remembered the butter and vanilla.  They're in the oven.  I'm anxious to see if there's much of a difference in taste!

WOW!  I made this recipe TWICE today because it is so good--it makes great breads as well as muffins.  Once I used buttermilk, once milk.  Great both ways.  I also used 3 eggs, 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white.  TRY THIS ONE!!

This is, hands down, the best banana muffin recipe we've ever had.  Just fantastic!  Excellent taste, texture and the crunch adds the punch.
We're not banana "fans" but this will now be a favorite.

The best yet and i make muffins every sunday! I 1/2ed the recipe and got 16 med. muffins. 25 min. produced perfectly browned muffins. Changes: used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, for the crunch-pulsed 1 nature valley pecan crunch granola bar, 1/3 c. quick oats, 1/4 c. walnuts & 1/2 c. trader joe's organic unsweet coconut. followed last reviewers sugg. to combine dry, then butter, then wet, then crunch ingredients. these are too good, i usually smear butter on muffins when i eat them but these do not need any! i am packing some up for a neighbor before i eat them all!

This was my first time making homemade muffins.  These were so good.  The family loved them.  I only did a couple of things different.  I did sift the dry ingredients together and I used granola on the top instead of banana chips as I didn't have any.  This one is definitely going in the recipe box and will be made many more times.

I made a batch of these and they didn't last a day in the pantry!  The only thing I changed was I used brown sugar, as that was all that I had at the time.  Very good recipe!

Relatively easy to make and they turned out great!  However, I thought the granola made them a little tough.  But maybe my granola was just old...  I'll still definitely make them again.

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I used 1/2 cup rolled oats and 1/2 cup chocolate granola cereal to replace the cup of granola.  Also added raisins.

Excellent recipe! I used whole wheat flour, and brown sugar instead of bleached flour and white sugar. I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1 and 1/4 of a cup as well. Also, I added in raisins and whole flax seeds as extras.

I've made these twice - once with granola as in the recipe, and once substituting Kashi nuggets because I'm trying to figure out things to do with them.  Both times, the muffins were incredible, and I'm not usually a banana muffin fan.  My husband and my neighbor, who are banana muffin fans, were in ecstasy.  I was skeptical of the baking time, but it really does take the entire 25 minutes to make that crispy top, and the muffin inside stays incredibly moist and flavorful.  Btw though, my batch made 34 muffins instead of the 24 stated, but we're quickly devouring them.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Thanks.

Best banana-nut muffin recipe ever. I suck at baking, but these muffins came out moist and had wonderful flavor and texture. The best baker I know (my boss) asked for the recipe.

These were so good. I didn't have a full cup of walnuts so I combined chopped pecans to fill the cup. I also didn't have any granola on hand so I used Kashi Go Lean Crunch, which has a similar texture. I'd make them again, even with the modifications!

Fabulous! I've already made these twice this week and given them away as gifts. They're delicious and turn out moist and flavorful, even with whole wheat flour! These are going into my personal collection of can't-go-wrong recipes.

I used Grape Nuts Trail Mix Crunch with Raisins and Almonds as the granola (twice as much as the recipe called for) but then didn't use coconut or walnuts.  And I followed MADISONRAE's suggestion for mixing and they came out perfect.  Thanks for a great way to use ripe bananas!

I made a few changes, I am sure the original is even better. I didn't have granola, left out coconut, used one cup whole wheat flour and halved the sugar. They turned out great, and I added milk chocolate chips and a few raisins. Thanks for the great base recipe. I also like that it makes 24 muffins rather than just 12.

Great recipe!I love all the healthy ingredients, but it was more time consuming that I hoped for, but worth it. I baked the first batch the full amount of time. They had tough bottoms, so the next batch I baked for less time and they were perfect

I don't like a really strong banana flavour in banana breads and desserts.  The banana adds needed moisture to the batter in this recipe but not a lot of strong flavour, which is great.  I just put in 4 mashed bananas (saved in the freezer when they got too brown).  The muffins are moist and yummy.  Thanks!

Rainy day here today, so thought it would be a great time to bake something. I didn't have any coconut so decided to add dried cranberries...this added a great tang to the muffins...LOVE THEM and will absolutely make them again...that is the only thing I changed, and also 1/2'd the recipe...we don't need 24 muffins in our house, I would eat 20 of them...so got 15....

I had some bananas to use up and made this recipe (cutting it in half).  Followed the directions exactly and we loved them.  Best banana muffins I ever made. Half of the recipe yielded 15 muffins.

These are quite possibly the best muffins I have ever tried.  I halved the recipe and it still made 12 muffins, and 7 mini-muffins!  I only baked them for about 20 minutes, so watch the time.
I also replaced half of the white flour with wheat flour...my kids (and my husband couldn't tell the difference).  I used a granola that had dried cranberries and currants in it, which only added to the flavor.  I didn't have enough walnuts, so we used half walnuts and half pecans.
Overall, they were delicious and I will definitely make them again!!

So good.  I used ingredients as written, following the mixing directions of an early reviewer.  Just delicious.  The combination of coconut, nuts and banana with the granola gives wonderful texture with layers of flavor.  I highly recommend.

I cut the recipe in half and got 12 big muffins and 11 mini muffins.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and only 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also cut the butter in half and replaced the other half with applesauce.  These were plenty sweet!

these muffins are fabulous and wonderful!  i modified it a bit to make it more healthy, and my partner, who hates everything healthy, couldn't even tell and adored these.  i made it with half whole-wheat, half white flour, and i reduced the sugar by half, and i substituted half of the oil with applesauce.  any way you make them though, these muffins are pretty much perfect.

These were really good and moist but they didn't puff up like a muffin should, they stayed more in the shape of a cupcake.  Anyone else with the same problem?

This is a great recipe! I did have to change the flour to whole wheat and it still turned out great! I also added cinnamon, because I love cinnamon in everything I bake.
I will make this again, maybe in a loaf version?

I switched the recipe up a little due to the allergy to eggs and I replaced one egg with a 1/3 of applesauce...they came out wonderful!, and are a great breakfast with a cup of coffee!!!!!

Delicious!

Mmmm very unigue taste! My brother said it tastes like a white chocolate chip cookie in a muffin... I think so too! I didn't have any banana chips to put in the muffin or on top. I think that would have really brought out the banana flavor because I couldn't taste banana otherwise. Besides leaving out the chips I followed the recipe exactly! Will definately make again with banana chips and adding extra banana!

Great!  Did not use granola but they still turned out very good.  The coconut gives them a great touch!

I've made some pretty awful muffins, but not with this recipe. 
The only reason I'm giving 5 stars is because 6 isn't an option.

These were absolutely delicious! I wasnt a fan of the banana chips taste after they baked but otherwise this was great. I used half all purpose and half wheat flour. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. The only thing I would change when I make these again is put maybe a mix of coconut and granola on top for that extra crunch instead of the banana chips.

Wow, these were delicious!  I used a bit less sugar and they were still plenty sweet.  I also substituted half a cup of flour with whole wheat flour and the taste was superb.  Next time I'll try to use more wheat flour and substitute some of the butter with applesauce to reduce fat without sacrifcing taste.  These were great!

Very good and easy recipe!  I also appreciated some of the variations in the reviews.  Very helpful.  I added raisins as I did not have granola.  I used 1 3/4 cup of fructose sugar--next time I will probably use 1 1/2 cups.  
Will add to my recipe file!!!

This is the most delicious bananna bread I have ever had!!  I didn't have any granola on hand, so I used kellogs fruit and yogurt cereal.  It gave the muffins an extra crunch with the yogurt pieces in it.  Feel free to use your favorite granola cereal in this one.

These were great! I didn't have banana chips, good without. The only way I could keep my fiance from eating them all was to put them in the freezer!

I used half butter half veg oil, plus I topped the uncooked muffins off with a mix of coconut and grape nuts cereal since I didn't have banana chips on hand. Moist & delicious! Great recipe.

Very nice!  I'd suggest halving the vanilla, and using less sugar (they're still very sweet like this).  I didn't have any granola, so doubled the amount of nuts (I love walnuts!).  Don't make them if you're hungry, though: they'll never have a chance to cool, and they're not really a proper lunch :)

These were awesome! I varied from the original recipe only slightly. I used 1/3 whole wheat flour and 2/3 unbleached all purpose. I also cut the sugar by 1/4. Finally, I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Delicious!

ABSOLUTELY the best! Everyone loved these muffins in my home, even my husband who doesn't have a sweet tooth whatsoever!  They were a huge hit. Great recipe!
