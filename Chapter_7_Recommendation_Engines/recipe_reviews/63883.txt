PURE HEAVEN!  A smooth, gentle and soothing autumn treat.  I used my hand blender to puree the bisque right in the pot.  It worked great!  Be certain to peel the squash well before cooking.

I made this recipe for a fall picnic and it was a hit!  Truely creamy and tasty.  I did use vegetable bouillon instead of chicken and the flavor was wonderful.  This one is a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  I changed the spices - added cinn, ginger, and a significant amount of nugmeg, which gave a great, warm flavour.  I also went overboard with the amount of squash.  Freezes surprisingly well.

I like this soup, but the end result was too thin. Next time I will add less broth or more squash than it calls for. As a matter of flavor preference I added one clove of garlic and less allspice. The squash was plenty sweet enough without adding a bunch of sweet spices as well. 1/4 tsp of allspice was just enough to give it depth of flavor without sweetening it more. A good soup with some minor changes.

This recipe was great for the fall.  I definitely wouldn't leave out the allspice, though - it really contributed a lot to the flavor.  I think this soup may even have tasted better as a leftover, after all the flavers blend together.

Love this soup!  I add just a bit more salt, but other than that small addition, I make it just as the recipe states.  My family looks forward to this soup each Fall.  I do use fat free half and half.  Yum!

A wonderful fall soup with the right amount of sweetness and spice.  I used the 2 C canned broth in place of the bouillon and water.  I added a bit more salt. Even my husband--who normally won't eat squash--loved it.

Easy to make, very nice flavor.  Peel squash before cutting it up!  Next time I make this I think I'll try a different spice, like cardamom.  If you use allspice, I recommend starting with half what the recipe states, & adding more to taste.  Allspice is not my favorite, & even though it was only a half teaspoon, it was more than I wanted to taste.  I will start iwth 1/4 teaspoon of any spice I choose.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  My teenage sons ate this up completely, and complained that I didn't make enough!  They honestly thought it was very good 'potato' soup until I told them!

I used double the amount of squash, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  A keeper!

This was excellent soup!  I didn't have any half and half so I just used a little milk and a dollop of cream cheese.  It was so filling and creamy.  I felt so healthy after eating it- its loaded with vitamins and minerals.  Much better than those canned soups!!!

This was easy to make, but not great.  The half-n-half overpowered the flavor of the squash, and it tasted too rich.  I would no make this recipe again.

I really like this.  Just made it (doubled the recipe), family hasn't tried it yet.  Used chicken broth, half the allspice.  I figure we can adjust our seasonings at the table.  From what I tasted already, yummy!

Pretty darn good on the first wintery weekend of the season! I made it a bit on the thick side and couldn't eat too much at once. But the taste was fabulous and I would definitely try this again.

I love this soup.  If you can find the bags of precut butternut squash, it makes the prep a breeze.  If you're clumsy, it's also safer.  I've almost lost fingertips wrestling with whole squash - I'll pay a little extra to keep my fingers!  :o) The only change I recommend is doing the allspice a little at a time and tasting - it's easy to overuse strong stuff like allspice.   And give the sour cream a try; it sounded weird but tastes really good.

amazingly great! if i could, i would have given this six stars! :) i varied the recipe a little - i only had 1 lb of squash, and i used 2 c organic vegetable broth instead. i didn't put in that much half and half, but i did add yogurt & sour cream upon serving. DE-LICIOUS!!

Yummy!!  We had this last night and it was so good and creamy!  I will make this again!  My parents were visiting and they usually eat squash made in the microwave with butter and brown sugar.  They were surprised to have it in a soup base for once!

This recipe was creamy and delicious! The perfect soup recipes for an autumn night! I used a blender to puree the squash, which took a bit linger, but it came out great! This one is a keeper!

my husband and son liked it but felt it could do without the allspice, my daughter and myself did not like at all. a mixed bag.
