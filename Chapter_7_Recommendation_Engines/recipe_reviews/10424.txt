These cookies were fun to do & made a great presentation.  I liked the results even better when I omitted the water brushing before sprinkling the tops with sugar.

I left the sour cream out. Dough was not sticky. I also put a scant spoonfull of seedless strawberry or raspberry jam in the center before folding the edges in.  They were alot like a shortbread. Also baked at 375 until edges were starting to brown.

I made these and found the dough to be too wet and sticky.  After folding in a lot more flour I could manage.  The flavor of the cookie was not that great.  I love the idea though and will use it with another dough recipe.

I found the dough to be really hard to work with - very sticky, I had to add so much flour that it affected the taste. That said, the cookies were pretty good once they were done. I baked it at a lower temp because my first set burned on the bottom and were incooked in the middle. They are adorable for Valentines day.

A lot of work for so-so finish.  Will not make again.  Cute idea, but needs work.
