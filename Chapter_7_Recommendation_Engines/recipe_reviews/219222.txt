This is how my grandma and Tia's used to cook it. I have been looking through several recipes and this is the closest (without the chicken) recipe that I have found. Besides not adding the chicken, I also didn't add the pepper.. This is VERY authentic sopa and I am very happy to have found this!

Loved this simple and flavorful soup!  A breeze to put together.  The flavor was wonderful.  A couple of tweaks, I added a quartered and sliced small zucchini and summer squash for some veg, and used 8 cups low sodium chicken broth.  I used two 6 oz pouches of Tyson Southwest seasoned grilled chicken chopped fine, and a teaspoon or so of cumin.  Delicious, and a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe... Full of flavor, and very fragrant.  I added some whole peeled tomatoes, and used Chilli seasoning as I couldn't find the "sazon".  I also cooked the chicken breast with olive oil and seasoned it with chilli seasoning, salt, and pepper... I fried it until brown and then added about some water and chicken bullion granules.  I cooked the chicken as a prepped the vegetables.  Enjoy! Very Tasty!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. We have some sensitive palates in our family, so I left out the jalapeno pepper which did not ruin the recipe at all.

I didn't find this recipe to be as flavorful as others. I used twice the amount of sazon and lots of onion, garlic and poblano pepper. It seemed very bland. I'll be looking for a better recipe.

De-flippin-licious!
Followed recipe to a tee although I added mexican blend cheeses and sour cream to the bowl, was awesome!
Next time I will add more chicken and possibly tomatoes.

Love it!!!!!! I did not add the jalapeno or green pepper but used red and yellow for a bit of color. For me fresh garlic is a must if you have on hand.

I made this with one green bell pepper, one jalapeno, and I used rotisserie chicken breast. If using minced [jarred)garlic go with 2.5 tsp. I cut back on the sazon and only used 1/8 tsp. It turned out delicious. It's very easy and perfect for a cold day.

Very flavorful!  I made this using part of an Anaheim pepper and a mix of red, yellow and orange bell peppers.  I didn’t have a jalapeno or Serrano pepper, so I left that out, but added a little heat with some cayenne pepper.  I used thin spaghetti for the pasta and subbed chicken broth for the water/bouillon.  I also threw in some diced zucchini and yellow squash that needed to be used.  This was very good, but I wasn’t thrilled with the appearance of the pasta.  I know, a minor detail.   But next time I think I would use orzo and toast it as the recipe indicates.
