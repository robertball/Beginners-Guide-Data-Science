I made it for my boyfriend because he loves meatloaf and I changed it up a bit but he loved it. I used a cornbread stuffing, and cooked my hamburger meat before mixing all the ingredients. If you don't have an hour+ time to cook that cuts your cooking time in half. If you let it cool down a bit after taking it out of the oven it still holds together like a meatloaf if your wanton to serve it on a platter. If not like us, we just scoop it out and it was great :) thank you!

I’m so sorry I didn’t take a photo. My husband and I were so hungry and it smelled so good we just started to eat this delicious meat loaf. I didn’t have all ingredients. I used two pounds of chop meat minced onion,garlic powder,salt,and black pepper. I used corn bread stuffing . I also used cream of mushroom soup however my pot has a drip strip for the oil. So instead of putting it on the bottom I put it on top about 20 minutes before it was done. It came out delicious we even had it the next night again. Next time I will use all ingredients and see the difference. Thankyou for this recipe. Any suggestions will be appreciated.

This is by far the top meatloaf recipe we have tried. It was a tiny bit on the salty side. Just cut the salt in half if you do not like salt.

I have searched for years to find a great meatloaf recipe.  This is it.  I have tried many recipes and none were very good.  Even growing up, my mom's was just ok.  I started to think maybe I didn't really like meatloaf.  Then I tried this. This recipe is different and so wonderful.  I will never make another meatloaf recipe.  Hubby loves it too.  I sometimes replace apples with bell pepper.  Thank you for this great recipe.  This is my first review after years on this site.  This was worth reviewing.

The taste was good but the consistency was not.  The soup bubbled over the top of the meatloaf and pretty much boiled it in the oven.  I followed the recipe completely with the following exceptions:  I used 1 lb. of ground turkey instead of the 1.5 lbs. of ground beef.  I used the whole can of mushroom soup but probably should have used on 2/3 since I had less ground meat in the recipe.  Otherwise I scaled all of the other ingredients down by one third.  It didn't brown and we weren't impressed.  I won't be making it again.

We really enjoyed this!  So unique!  Great flavor and what a change from your usual meatloaf.  Difference - - I used all organic beef.

Absolutely amazing! I used less milk and no water though. I always bake in glass - so 9x13 glass pan! It was so great we couldn't stop eating before I remembered to take the picture.

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used only one apple instead of two. And 2 stalks of celery instead of three. Turned out perfect. My husband and kids loved it! Will definitely be making this again. ??

I tried this recipe tonight. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. And replaced the apple with diced red pepper, half a zucchini, diced and mixed all the remaining ingredients together. 
My husband walked in the door and said, something smells so good. If it tastes half as good as it smells, it will be delicious. 
This recipe is a keeper. 
Thank you for sharing it.

I followed the recipe except it calls for 2 eggs. My husband has egg allergy so I substitute the eggs with oatmeal and it came out very yummy.  My husband loves it. This recipe is a keeper.

I don't make a lot of meatloaf, but this is so good. It's tender, flavorful and easy to put together. I will make it again, but next time: I will use less onion (I used 1 sm. onion) or cook it w/ garlic first . The  bits of onion were overwhelming (in texture), I kept getting too many bites of onion. I cut it small, too and I love onion. Maybe I will use minced dried onion next time. Also, I loved the cream of mushroom soup addition. I didn't add water, just some milk. I also just used hamburg, that's what I had on hand. So good with mashed potatoes, salad and french cut green beans.

It was a really nice supper.  The mushroom gravy went well with potatoes, and we ate leftover meatloaf sandwiches the next few days.  Used a 2 quart casserole. It took the full 1.5 hours to cook. Didn't have celery and used StoveTop Chicken stuffing.  Yes, will make this again. Beats my old tired meatloaf recipe.

Moist and meaty with a delicious topping. I used 1/3 pork and 2/3 beef. Replaced the apple with zucchini cause I don't like fruit in my meat but otherwise made as directed. The garlic and salt were just right, the baking time right on. It was really good leftover too. Will make again, thanks!

This was a unique way to do meatloaf with a sauce built in via the mushroom soup and I was curious to try it. Also my parents love stuffing and meatloaf and I thought this would be a hit, as I make meals and take to them. I made it lighter by using egg white, and nonfat mushroom soup, and 93 percent lean beef, one large apple. When making again would even go a higher percentage fat free and I think it would be fine.   I used stove top stuffing as I didn't want to buy a bigger bag of stuffing, although Pepperidge farm is my favorite and would use it if on hand. The only thing I wish I had done was to "cook" the onion celery and apple a bit before adding. Even a minute or two in the microwave to soften. I think that would have elevated this to a 5 star for me, and taken a bit of the bite out of the onion. My onion was a bit strong. I added Herbs such as parsley, thyme, and sage. Herbs de provence would be good in it.

This was excellent!!!  One of the best meatloaf recipes I've ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Maybe try with turkey next time but I'm guessing it won't be as good!

This was really good especially if you're like me and you prefer meatloaf with gravy instead of ketchup. I used a meat mixture of 1 lb of ground pork and almost a lb of ground beef because that's what I had. I didn't have the apples so left them out which I would have done anyway because I'm not a fruit and meat fan. No celery so subbed celery flake, but would add real celery next time. Used chicken stove top for stuffing and needed to cook some on-their-last-leg mushrooms. Softened onions and mushrooms in a little butter but I don't know if I would do that next time. Had to remove grease from the dish after it came out of the oven. I did save some of the mushroom/onion/celery flake mix and mixed with cream soup.  I didn't add the water and didn't notice it. Wouldn't fit in my loaf pan (not sure of the size) so put in round cake pan, cooked for about 1hr and 20min, flipped, sliced into wedges, and served with broccoli and instant four cheese potatoes. So good.

This was excellent and the family loved it. Didn't have apples so skipped it. We don't care for the traditional meatloaf but this was easy and tasty. Will rotate into our menu. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I did change this to my boyfriend's liking! But still great base recipe! I was never a meatloaf fan until now. Boyfriend is but I never made one until this one that we both liked. He begged me not to change anything and make meatloaf more often. Thank you for recipe.

This was really good! Smelled amazing and tasted like Thanksgiving in a meatloaf!
I used ground beef and Johnsonville sausage for the meat, made my own cream of mushroom soup. Everyone in the family loved this. Thanks! 
Next time I'll stuff it will bleu cheese!
