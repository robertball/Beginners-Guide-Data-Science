This recipe is just great!  Don't change a thing. The soup sounds as though it would not be a good addition, but it has to be part of the revipe. I just served it to five hungry guys and they each ate three. Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper!

I've taken this recipe to 2 or 3 potlucks at work so far and am considering doing it again for another one next week. This is a very easy, economical and popular dish for potlucks and I have never had any left over.  You will need a slotted spoon for serving as the sauce is quite runny. No biggie though 'cause the chili dogs taste really good.

I started with a pound of Velveeta cheese and a large can of chili con carne. I also added a sprinkle of chipotle powder instead of the green chilies. This was pretty good. I also did not use the crock pot, too Hungry! LOL This makes a Great dip btw! Thanks Sooz:)

I feel like I didn't need a slow cooker at all. To me, the cream of cheddar offset the chili. I probably will use Velveeta cheese next time. It was a bit thinner, too but luckily my family isn't picky and they liked this a lot.

With the exception of adding corn chips, I followed it exactly.  My wife, who typically doesn't eat hot dogs, wanted to branch out and ended up loving these.

YUM!  My kids loved this and my daughter doesn't usually like chili dogs.  This was a huge hit and very easy to make.  Definitely will make it again.  We did omit the green chilies and we used crushed chili flavored corn chips as that was all we had.

Best chili cheese dogs ever! I cut the recipe down to only feed myself and use the leftover sauce for Frito Pie. Delish! I can't understand how anyone would give this one star.

A glorified version of "chili cheese dogs".  In the future I would heat up some regular chili (with beans) and hot dogs in the microwave and not bother with the slow cooker.  If you do follow this recipe, double the ingredients for the chili that you put in the slow cooker.  There wasn't enough of the chili mixture to go around when dinner time came.  Be aware that the chili comes out thin and soupy.  I liked the Fritos on top though, that was yummy.
