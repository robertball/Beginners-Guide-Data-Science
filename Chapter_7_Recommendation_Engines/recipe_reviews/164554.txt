I'm sure this still would have been a 5 star without the changes I made, but I did make some revisions to fit our tastes and to decrease fat/calories even more, as this is already a fairly light chowder.  I used cod (about a 1/3 of the price) and the flavor was still great.  I also used a couple extra pototoes and pureed them after they got a bit soft to help create a thicker consistency.  I replaced the tomatoes with a can of corn, used 1 cup of skim milk, and about 1/2 of a 14 oz can of reduced fat evaporated milk.  In addition to the fish, I added a can of minced clams, reserving the clam juice.  I mixed the clam juice with about 3-4 Tbsp of cornstarch and that really thickened the chowder nicely.  I shook in a good amount of salt and pepper and also added a little Old Bay and cayenne.  With the richness of this chowder the way I prepared it, it's hard to believe there is only about 3-4 grams of fat per serving.

I used cod rather thn halibut (availabilty dictated this), and evaporated milk rather than milk and cream, a lower fat subsitute I often use in chowders that does not sacrifice smoothness. Turned the heat up with a bit of extra crushed pepper in consideration of some family members. Used red skin potatoes unpeeled and fresh parsley so the colors were lovely. Yummy! I can see this being a family favorite.

Delicious! My dad made this a long time ago and he shredded the carrots, so I was quite pleased that I found this recipe on allrecipes. I didn't have the heavy cream on hand, but I thickened the soup with corn starch and it turned out fine.

My family loves this recipe.  I did not add the pepper flakes because I have small kids who can't handle spicy stuff.  This was a great way to use up the halibut my husband caught in Alaska last year.

Fantastic.  Everyone in the family liked it and asked for it to be cooked again. I used left over halibut from a party that we had the night before. I added it to the completed soup at the end. I also used up the leftover potatoes from the night before. I added the potatoes with the garlic but only cooked it for two minutes instead of ten. I didn’t shred the carrots. I threw some baby carrots in a food processor and pulsed  them until they were chopped up. I think this is a pretty  “healthy” chowder. Most of the base is chicken broth, and there is only ½ cup cream and one tablespoon butter. Not bad, and it tastes wonderful.

We live in Northern BC and have been catching halibut for years. We were looking for a new way to cook halibut. This recipe was awesome. Everyone in the family loved it, including the 8 year old picky eater that doesnt eat anything new. Served it with warm buttered sourdough bread. Perfect recipe dont change a thing.

This was an awesome chowder! i used Tilapia (cheaper) instead and it was sooo good. My whole family raved! I thought it needed a lil more flavor so I added some parsley and more salt and it was de-lish. It was actually better the next day cuz all the flavors had gotten richer over night.

My sons fresh catch of the day was rock fish, red snapper and sea bass.So threw it all in the pot. I replaced milk with heavy cream. Also added 1 cup of corn. Yes a little extra butter and cheese. Then last but not least some hot  sauce. It was fantastic. This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first attempt at fish chowder and it turned out great! I did not modify the ingredient list at all although I did use only half the amount of fish and only 1 litre of broth (because I only had a pound of fish and a litre of broth!). It is a very good recipe and I think I may change a few things next time like add some celery or maybe corn or different fish or...... but it is just great how it is too.

First, let me say that this makes a LOT of soup. The first time I made it exactly as written - VERY GOOD, but I didn't care for the tomatoes. Last night I made this for the 2ncd time w/these changes; Divided all ingredients by half. Substituted cream corn for tomatoes & added 1/2 tsp minced garlic & 1 TBSP of flour to onions. This soup was creamier & richer...Hubby said best fish chowder ever!

An excellent basic recipe! I too made variations on it: no tomato (not a fan of fish with tomato); used monkfish and some shrimp; upped the butter, and used 1 1/2 cups half-and-half and one half cup good white wine (I used a Chardonnay). Used Swiss instead of Cheddar, and added celery, leek, sage, a little basil, and a little coriander; also some finely chopped spinach and a hint of mace. And white instead of black pepper. No red pepper. It was sumptuous!

We wondered about the lack of spices and herbs but it turned out excellent with a lot of flavour.  We followed the recipe to a T.

Excellent! I added fresh bacon crumbles and it added the perfect extra taste.  The only problem I had was the way that my stomach felt afterwards...this might sound weird, but it was well worth it!

This is a great basic recipe that lends itself to individual tweaking.  I made it as listed and it was very good.  It's a terrific way to use up that frozen halibut.  Thanks for posting!

This was pretty good, but I changed it a lot. I used tilapia because it was much cheaper, but I'm sure this would have been much better with the halibut. I also used 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup heavy cream. Added a box of frozen corn (which was a great addition) and some fresh crabmeat (which was a waste because the crab was overwhelmed by everything else). I used the food processor to hack up some baby carrots and didn't add any cheese. Sprinkled in some Old Bay seasoning, but next time I will experiment with some more herbs and definitely season the fish before adding it to the stew.

I like this because it doesn't taste fishy.  Hubs liked it, too. Had to compromise because of what I had on hand and incorporated previous reveiws. My only changes were: added three slices torn up pancetta (didn't have bacon) no potatoes! - added al dente pasta added Tilapia No creme on hand - thickened with 3 tsp cornstarch and 2 Tbls water  Delicious.  Will make again with all on hand.  Thx for giving me confidence with a fish recipe.....not fishy at all......yummy.   I'm going to have another bowl now.

I used a mixture of sand bass, catfish and perch.  I am another that has added some extras.  This chowder turned out very good.  After adding the chicken stock I only added 1 cup of skim milk.  I did not add the cream at all.  When the fish was finished cooking at the end of the recipe, I added flaked mashed potatoes to thicken the broth.  Excellent!

we had to double the recipe because of our family size. I added bacon and cooked it with the onion for a wonderful chowder flavor. I also added parsley at the end. Oh, and since I live in Alaska, I had scallops on hand so added those in as well. Thank you for the wonderful recipe to build on!

This soup was superb.  The flavor complimented the halibut without masking or altering the natural, delicate taste of the fish.  I too substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream as some ingredients are very difficult to come by where I live.

I made this recipe with some halibut that we brought home from Alaska and the only thing I changed was that I used some Tony Cahcere's seasoning instead of the salt and crushed red peppers.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and I will be making it again.  For just the two of us next time I will cut the ingredients in half.

Very good recipe.  I go to Alaska every year and bring home fresh halibut; this was a good alternative to the other cooking methods I know.  Rather than adding the cheese before serving, I allowed each person to add their desired amount of shredded cheese and red pepper flakes.  I also added lime tortilla chips on top which went very well.  Everyone loved it!

This was a great recipe!
It made a delicious chowder. 
I did make some adjustments from the recipe after seeing other reviews: subbing frozen corn from the canned tomato, using evaporated milk instead of milk, with a splash of cream. I also added half a red pepper, one stock of celery (chopped), and a handful of mushrooms. It soup isn't very thick so I steamed and mashed some potatoes, which made the soup creamier. I might try adding some minced clams and claim juice+corn starch, as suggested by Nicole next time for a smoother texture, also for a bit more of a seafood taste into the soup. :) Enjoy!

Great receipe.  I used talapia and cod (that's what I had on hand).  I added 2 cans of creamed corn (an awesome addition), and I used 1/2-n-1/2 instead of heavy cream and milk.  In my opinion, this recipe does not need the cheese.  I tasted the choweder before and after I added the cheese, and I actually think it's a little better without the cheese.  Finally, I used cilantro as a garnish, and omigosh, it added a fantastic, wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Halibut application.  I thought I had stewed tomatoes  on hand, but didn't so I left them out.  I also added a bay leaf and thyme (but next time I would only use fresh thyme, so I could remove it) with the chicken stock.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be making this again.

I made this on a whim one night while looking for something to do with a halibut filet.  It was delicious!  I didn't have canned stewed tomatoes so I just threw a fresh tomato in there.  I also was out of milk so I used all cream which made for a very rich soup, but still very, very good.  I would definitely make this again!

WOW! this was really good! I did have to simmer it for a little while longer, I prefer my chowders to be thicker. Next time I may try it with a smidge of white wine and a little more heavy cream.

This was good but not amazing.  It was easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.  My biggest complaint is that it doesn't feel like a chowder to me, more of a chunky soup.  If I make it again I will follow some of the reviewers suggestions and thicken it with cornstarch.

This was really, really good!  I do not care for fish, but my husband does so I try to find ways to put it in our diet.  While not the lowest fat fish entree, it is certainly delicious!  I will make this again!

This was an awesome recipe! I did make a few changes which made it from good to the best soup I have ever had...  I used all fat free cream and milk and a little more then the recipe called for, I used fat free Half and Half instead of cream and threw in a whole package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I added a chicken bouillon cube, some dried tarragon, I subbed the potato for sweet potatoes which was so good with this recipe! I used halibut because its way cheaper. My family went crazy when they tried it, it was so good! I served it with garlic bread and it was delish. When I make it again I might try adding something to thicken up the soup because it was a bit watery rather than creamy but still the flavor was to die for,

This is a great recipe whether you follow the directios exactly or have to modify it when you don't have all the ingredients or not enough of an ingredient. I am a cook for seniors in their homes and they all rave about it .The recipe is slightly different each time as they dont all have all the stuff . Sometimes no cheese,sometimes not enough potato,sometimes less fish ! Its all great !

This was excellent.  I added corn which I think makes it!  Also, I get the canned tomatoes with the green chillies.  It give the chowder extra kick and goes well with the sweetness of the corn and fish.  I use cod which holds up very well.

This was good, but I will make some changes next time. I used tilapia and added some corn (will ad more corn next time). Will cook again, but next time I will experiment with some different seasonings and seafood.

A warm, cheesy and spicy chowder. Comfort food doesn't get any better than this! The first time I tried this recipe I ate together with a person who wasn't very hungry, so she left a big amount of her plate. I was like "Excellent! more for me!" so I ended up eating three whole servings of this magnificent chowder.

Fantastic!  I've never made a fish chowder before and was skeptical as to the taste.  Delicious!  I did tweak the recipe just a smidgen.  I used evaporated milk instead of the milk and heavy cream and chicken soup base instead of the broth.  Other than those changes it's a keeper the way it's written.  YUM!

This recipe is GREAT. My husband as cancer and all he wants is soup or chowder. He can't get enough of this chowder. For a cancer patient to eat a lot, I think that is saying a lot for the recipe. I made just like the recipe calls for  except I used Cod couldn't fine Halibut and it was still great.

I am a chef on a yacht and made this for lunch today. In 2 months of cooking on this boat, this is the most loved meal I have made. The owner's quote....."exceptional". I halved the recipe and used two prosciutto-wrapped halibut fillets left over from the night before. Just chunked them up and added them toward the end (the prosciutto was a nice touch!). It easily fed 5 hungry people. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, though I did add a can of corn and thickened it up just slightly with a tsp of cornstarch. I have been requested to make this whenever guests are on board now. Thanks so much for posting this. Wow!

Used fresh caught rockfish.  Diced carrots, upped cheese, red pepper flakes and heavy cream.  Add cream AFTER fish is cooked, milk/cream curdled.  Adding milk AFTER fish cooked would have made it 5 stars.

YUM! We had gotten some halibut from a friend who had come some in Alaska. Wasn't sure what to do with it but a chowder sounded good. This was delicious. I followed the recipe to a T, maybe adding more carrot and a little cornstarch to thicken, but that was it. It turned out great and it was super easy. I'll definitely do this again if I ever have halibut around. Perfect for a cold fall day in MN.

THE best halibut chowder ever! I thought the ingredients were too simple and one, weird, but fought the urge to change the recipe. It made sense when I ate it. Anything else would have robbed the halibut of its flavor. Served it with my auntie's buckskin bread and was in HEAVEN!

This soup is really good, but lacks a bit of punch. I will try the suggestion to add the seafood seasoning next time.  I pureed the soup before adding the milk/cream/fish and also added corn starch.

Good Recipe; the addition of cream is a good twist.  Warmed up the umteenth time, the chowder gets better and better.  I can't leave well enough alone, so, after trying the recipe as printed, my next batch, as with many halibut soup or chowder recipes, I induce a few more ingredients, i.e. I've added 4 cups of sliced mushrooms several minutes after adding the potatoes. And to thicken the chowder a bit, I add corn starch as metioned in other reviews.  You can't hardly hurt this recipe.  My next batch of chowder, I'll also add some chopped celery; this always goes good with halibut soups and chowders.

Very awesome only changes I made was I took some of the soup out and then added flour to make a thickener then when thick and bubbly added it back to the chowder then let it cook on low heat for another 30 min. I also added celery. Awesome chowder I will make this again.

Our favorite fish is halibut and we really liked this recipe. It was a good soup to have for dinner on a winters night.

This is a great recipe! My mother made it and gave us some leftovers. My husband liked it so much he had me call my mom and ask for the recipe. We love it. We have also had it with Sole - a fish with a similar texture to halibut and cheaper.

This was great!  Next time I will add a little more red pepper since my husband likes his food spicy. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful recipe. Company worthy. I substituted milk for cream and added a few teaspoons for corn starch to thicken it. I also did not use pepper flakes.

Great basic recipe!  (When asked to rate a recipe, AllRecipes asks: "Did you make any changes? Would you make it again?")

Changes:

Half the recipe is enough for 4 good-sized servings.  I couldn't find the number of servings on the recipe, as written, but a number of reviewers said it made a lot, so I halved it for my needs.

I added: chopped parsley, diced celery, dried basil.  I swapped stewed tomatoes for 2 cored and diced roma tomatoes.  Like other cooks here I slightly thickened the soup with a slurry of corn starch.

A flavorful, hearty chowder.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this a lot with the halibut we catch. I use Old Bay seasoning instead of plain salt and it makes a HUGE difference. I also add a package of frozen spinach (or other greens) for some extra nutrition and color.

We thought this was great! Subbed evaporated milk for the milk products, omitted tomatoes, used 3 potatoes, a dash of old bay, added fresh corn and bacon. We used fresh, caught that day halibut. It turned out a wee bit "fishy" for me but my husband loved it. We served it topped with cheese with biscuits on the side.  It was definitely easy and we had most ingredients on hand.  My husband is already asking me to make it again sometime soon! I only have 4 stars because I tweaked the ingredients some.

Wonderful  recipe.  No need to change anything.  My dad said he had never had a better soup, and we live in Seattle where there are a lot of fish soups .   I will make again.  My four year olds ate this up.

A wonderful Fish Chowder.   When I make next time I will  gently mash the potatoes before adding the fish to add a little body to the broth.  I am sure it would be just as wonderful with any firm white fish (ie: Haddock or Cod).   Only  used 1 pound of  Halibut and that was plenty.  I did not use the hot pepper flakes and did think it needed some additional salt.

WOW! This was my first fish chowder/soup, and this stuff was awesome!!  I did make a few minor changes, I halved the recipe, I also used cod instead of halibut, I also used 1 can of cream corn in place of the tomatoes.  When this soup is finished the broth tastes amazing.  I cannot wait to see how it taste tomorrow, after the flavors have had a chance to blend.

Love this recipe, so easy to make and it tastes great without getting that "fishy" flavour. I added about 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay spice, 1 tbsp. of dill and 3 celerys. Everyone loved it!

Excellent recipe. More like a soup than a chowder though. I followed the recipe, but substituted regular milk for the cream to reduce the fat and used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes in lieu of the stewed tomatoes. Don't let the lack of spices dissuade you - the flavor is wonderful.

Made a few changes & substitutions & it worked out GREAT! I used 3 potatoes instead two-- ooh I know, I know living dangerously! Used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of 6 (yup I'm a rebel) I used can of corn instead of tomatoes & used a giant can of costco clams, drained (did save 1 cup of clam of juice which I mixed with corn starch for a thickening agent). Did not use heavy whipping cream instead used 1cup of NF milk. Didn't have carrots on hand so used mushrooms & bell peppers. I added the clams & the halibut the last 10-12 mins of cooking & it was perfect. Thanks Nicole Burdelle's review..I got the idea of clams & corn from her. You gotta make this, it's THE BOMB!! Next time I make it I will use salmon in place of halibut just to try it out :D

I made this step by step except I put the cheese in my bowl instead of the pot.  I added the green onion like the picture above.  It turned out fantastic, I just love the broth.  The red pepper flakes are a lovely touch.  I had some frozen halibut in my freezer and didn't know what to do with it I am so glad that I found this recipe it was a hit thank you so much I posted it as a very positive review on my Facebook page as well and I'm saving it so that I can make it again later.

Added thyme. Used shallots instead of onions. Cheese never goes on fish.

Absolutely delicious. Great save for halibut which was very dry!

I travel to the east coast of Canada fairly often,  and I found a place that sells Halibut for $3 a pound. I cannot believe how good this recipe is. Everybody loves it! Thank you for sharing!!!

I used sweet potato instead of white since that's what I had.  I used pre-shredded carrots to save time.  I used cream of poblano soup instead of cream and Rotel tomatoes to give a little extra kick.  I added Old Bay as others mentioned, skipped the cheese altogether.  Used frozen flounder since that's what I had. Turned out well, will make it again using white potatoes.

Made it exactly as written and my husband and kids loved it. Made a few changes then next couple times and now they won’t allow me to make any more changes because they say it’s absolutely perfect! I left out the potatoes to reduce the carbs, did a combination of about three pounds of salmon and halibut (soaked in milk as I cut it to eliminate the fishy flavor), added 2 chopped leeks and 1 bunch of celery chopped up to the onions and sautéed them together, and added some coriander. I used a can of diced tomatoes including the juice instead of stewed stewed tomatoes. Sooo delicious, and I don’t even care for fish!

Used leftover, sauteed halibut and added asparagus, a pint of heavy cream (no milk) and a 6 oz package shredded asiago/parmesan instead of the cheddar cheese. Also, added 2 tablespoons Old Bay seasoning. Delicious!!!

Awesome! I used rockfish and added kale.  To inhance the flavor, I added a bay leaf and seasoned it with salt, turmeric, ginger, and parsley near the end. I used plain coconut milk and goat milk for the milk/cream as well.  It was a great hit.  My only issue was that I didn't pay attention to the number of servings  (16!) and ended up with a giant pot of way too much soup.

Very good! Had leftover halibut I had from another recipe, as my husband brought a lot back from Alaska.  Used the left overs in this recipe, and my hubby, parents, and even 7 year old son loved it! my hubby and I both agreed that we should try a can of clams in it next time. Oh, and since my hubby is low carb, I used diced zucchini in place of potatoes.

My husband and I both liked the recipe but I thought it would be thicker.  It was very broth-like in the consistency of the base.  I added shrimp to the recipe because my husband loves shrimp.  The overall flavor was quite good.  I may make a roux with a little flower before adding the broth next time, just to thicken it up a bit.   But it was tasty!

I definitely would make this again. I had some alaskan halibut that I had frozen from this summer. The chowder was yummy. I added more hot pepper flakes and a little more salt to spice it up a bit.

Better the next day, of course.  I did not use onions as they are not something I can have.  I did boil and puree a third potato to thicken.  Used onion powder, doubled the garlic, and we discovered its AMAZING with jalapeño tabasco added after serving!

Not the most pleasing of colours so I would have given it 4.5 stars but I loved it more than I liked it...So yummi!  I made a few changes and added in a cup of organic local corn that I had frozen over the summer, a bay leaf, white pepper instead of black and I used my own homemade fish stock that I had in my deep freeze - it's fish chowder so fish stock (if you have it) would work best.  I finished it off with old shredded white cheddar instead of adding it to the soup since it just disappears and a side of buttered crusty bread for dipping.  Perfect comfort food for those cold winter (Canadian) nights - brrr!

I used tilapia (because it was in the freezer) and I rough chopped the carrots instead of shredding.
I would cut the mount of chicken broth/milk in almost half.  I found that there was almost 2 cups of just liquid left after we ate all the "solids".
I would like to try and roast the fish next time, just to impart a bit more flavor into it.  
Overall, I liked it.  The broth and the veg were great, and I can see using it as a base for any protein.

No changes. This was perfect as written. I’ve made this multiple times with all different kinds of fish. Great with cod or tilapia or any of the more affordable fish also. Thanks for this awesome recipe.

This is a great halibut chowder. I think I'll also try it with salmon. I did use evaporated milk instead of milk and heavy cream. I'm sure it would have been even creamier using the cream.

One thing I did differently, we do this when we make clam chowder, is to start with some cut up bacon strips in the pot. After cooking the bacon, I added the onion and continued with the stated order of cooking.  Yes, this probably takes away a bit of the healthy aspect, but bacon is always a nice addition.

This was very easy to make, but much more of a soup than your typical hearty chowder. My grocer didn't have halibut, so I used cod instead. Next time, I will add corn, mushrooms, and maybe celery so that it's more filling and doesn't just taste like a fishy soup.

My husband is from Kodiak Island so we always have a nice stock of AK halibut in the freezer. Most of the time I use it for this recipe! I think I've been making it for the last 5 years. It's not one of those ultra-fattening gelatinous chowders. I did as the last recommendation suggested and mashed the potatoes a bit and the results were good. I usually double the ingredients and add canned yellow corn.  For the cream I substitute half & half since I can use the leftovers in my coffee. Very delicious.

At first I wasn't too impressed, but added some garlic salt and a sprinkle or two of sugar and let simmer a little longer and I liked it.  Next time I would probably make it more creamy.

Like some of the other reviewers, I used cod ($3/lb) instead halibut ($13/lb), but other than that the only change I made was to add a few dashes of Old Bay seasoning. I really liked the result; creamy and rich and delicious.

Delicious! Even my husband, who says he hates halibut, enjoyed this dish. All of my children went back for seconds. My only complaint was more a personal issue. I shouldn't have cooked it for so long, because the halibut got a little bit tough. However, that made it a very meaty stew, so I don't think anybody minded. Very good!

Excellent recipe/easy to revise to your own needs; I doubled the butter, added 2Tbsp flour to the butter & onions, used 2lbs walleye instead of halibut, only added 4 cups chicken stock, sub'd cream corn for the tomatoes and used 1cup heavy cream - no milk.  My family likes thick soup/chowder, and this was very thick (I might add a cup of milk next time...) It was sweet, savory and scrumptious!  Even my son, who H-A-T-E-S fish of any kind, ate it! ;)

My daughter brought me back halibut pieces from Ahousat (a small Native community on Flores Island, not too far from Tofino, BC) & I needed a recipe - this worked out perfectly! This recipe is wonderful!  I added fresh basil & dill (couple tbsp each), some sliced fresh mushrooms & some chopped celery. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I used 8 oz of crushed tomatoes. I used Lactose Free Half & Half cream. I wish I had read the reviews first & had blended the potatoes to make the soup thicker more like chowder, but that's my only complaint (I'll do that next time). I also had a few tbsp of sour cream that needed to be used up so I threw that in the soup too. The soup goes really well with Rye bread toast. :D BTW, I'm not usually a fan of tomato based chowders but this recipe changed my opinion!

I  left out the tomatoes and added a can of niblets corn including the liquid. I added 1 tsp of Bay seasoning. I used a can of evaporated milk and 3.25 % milk and I added a bit of gourmet curry powder. At the end is added some chopped up peppers. I also added a bit if thyme. I also used grated extra old cheddar cheese  - about 2/3 of a cup. Instinct led me to make those adjustment  and it ended up being a fabulous large pot of soup which pleased everyone.  I kept the potatoes and carrots chunky and sautéed the onions  before doing anything.  Everyone loved it! Hope you try it Tyson.  Jan

Ok I was loving it until I added the shredded cheddar, and then DISASTER STRUCK!  I had tasted the broth, followed all instructions (except left out the tomatoes), loved the taste, but when I stirred in the shredded cheddar, the whole thing CURDLED!  Yikes - it must have been too hot??? I ate a bowl but if I would have had guests, could not have served it.  This recipe needs to contain more detail about cooling the chowder before adding the cheddar??? It was delicious with the carrots & red pepper, a very distinctive taste.  Not so good after it curdled, however.  Not sure what the cheese added to this recipe.  Also, the halibut cubes should be smaller than shown for fish wimps - halibut's a pretty strong taste and maybe best in little doses? I would also throw in a bit of chopped celery if trying it again, which I will.  Sans cheddar.

It is a good start for a base but like others have said,  put your own flare on it.  I did thicken mine so it was more chowder like.  Also used an Asian chili/tomato paste instead of canned tomatoes as well as more halibut and carrots.  I like heat so I spiced it up a bit more,  delicious!

This is an awesome dish. I adjusted a few things- used cod instead of halibut and evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and milk and seafood broth instead of chicken broth. I also added shrimp, celery, creamy corn, some hot sauce and herb and garlic spices. Will definitely make this again!!!

I loved it, but my hubby didn't care for tomatoes mixed with the cream chowder. But I have a finer palette than him and think this is a great way to eat all the Alaskan halibut we caught this summer. I didn't add too much red pepper, as I don't like the burning sensation only the flavor of spice, and it was excellent. My daughter, who is 6, ate the entire bowl.

It was really good, but I will puree more potatoes to thicken it up the next time and skip the cream.

LOVE LOVE! Only wish mine would come out more thick and much less of a soupy consistency. I like my chowders thick. But love the flavors.

Oh my, this was so good! My husband could not stop eating this and said it tasted like something from a restaurant at the coast....that's a keeper. I followed the recipe exactly except for a couple very minor changes because I was working with what I had. I had some leftover halibut from the night before and decided to create another meal out of it. I'm so glad I found this recipe. I rinsed some of the sauce and seasonings off the halibut in water and chopped it up ready to be reused. Only changes made with ingredients was adding 2 cups regular milk (had no heavy cream) 14 oz canned diced tomatoes (had no stewed). For those of you who said it wasn't thick enough all you have to do is cook the potatoes longer and thats it. No need to add starch or puree potatoes. After awhile the potatoes begin to fall apart but you are still left with chunks of potatoes creating a soup very much like a chowder....yum, yum. Instead of cooking potatoes in soup for 25 minutes I cooked it more like 40 minutes. Also, make sure you add enough potatoes that it will be able to thicken your soup. The recipe calls for 2 large potatoes. I would think they would have to be very large. I had medium sized so I added about 5. At the end of cooking I added the milk and seasoned to my liking and cooked another 5 minutes.Then, I tossed in the halibut last. Fish still tasted moist and flavorful even with it being a day old. Superb!

I loved this recipe. Simple and delish. I only changed the fish. I love my halibut too much to put in a soup, so I used a great cod and shrimp. I served it with a gluten free Irish soda bread. You have to try. It's a keeper.

Absolutely lovely. The cheese isn't necessary, and the soup's more elegant and just as filling and creamy without it (not to mention easier to clean up). I usually make it with cod, but have also used snapper. Everyone loves it. Everyone asks for the recipe.

Tried this recipe with leftover halibut and it was absolutely wonderful !!  We love garlic, so increased the recipe to 6 cloves and added a cup of chopped celery & shredded cabbage.....   A REAL KEEPER !!
