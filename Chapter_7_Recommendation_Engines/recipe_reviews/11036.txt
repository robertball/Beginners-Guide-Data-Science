We were looking for a recipe similar to the thin crisp oatcakes served while in Scotland. These were too soft and gummy

This seems to be missing some fundamental ingredient.. flour maybe? It didn't work at all it remained very gooey until they basically burned on the outside. Not at all like oatcakes.
