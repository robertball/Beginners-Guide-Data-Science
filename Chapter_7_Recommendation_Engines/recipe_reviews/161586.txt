Out of the oven, the first bite gives a crisp crunch and wonderful pretzel flavor with the softest dough in the middle. Absolutely delightful! Once the boys heard the crunch, it was all hands on the cooling rack and nothing left in minutes. The flavor is good enough not to need extra butter (as my husband is wont to do at times) but also goes well with a goood coarse ground mustard and yes! a nice beer.

It was so easy I made multiple batches to play with. I reccomend not changing a thing in this recipe. I split the batch into 12 moderate sized pretzels rather than big ones. so that they would last longer (they didn't :)

One thing I did try that showed interesting results:
Kneading by hand made the inside very soft like frsh white bread.
Kneading by Kitchenaid made the center more tough for a heartier chew.

Also tried wrapping around already simmered turkey brats after dipping pretzels in baking soda solution and made fantastic pretzel brats.

This recipe is a definite keeper. My thanks to the Drexlers for passing this on!

Awesome! You probably saved me from going to jail!!! Having grown up in Bavaria, I miss pretzels terribly and always play with the idea of trying to break the law and smuggle them back with me to the U.S., not a good idea if you don't want to get to know customs and who-knows-what agencies from up close. I knew that usually the pretzels get washed with lye in Germany and that always stopped me from even trying to make them over here. Then I saw your recipe and the baking soda wash and went to work right away. They were absolutely delicious, the best thing you can make without lye. I followed the recipe exactly and found the dough to be just the right consistency but I also didn't overknead the dough. I made my baking soda wash a little stronger by using only 2 1/2 cups of water. If you use a smaller pot the fluid is deep enough that you don't have to flip the pretzels over, the will simply swim in the solution and be coated all around. A large slotted spoon is just the tool for the task and works perfectly. To get the pretzels off the baking sheet, be patient and let them cool a bit on the sheet before going to remove them. Then a turner will slide them off easily enough.

This was a good basic recipe and made a delicious pretzel. The only complaints that i had with this recipe were one; the directions were somewhat lacking and two The dough  is much better when you let it rise right after kneading, then separate the dough into portions, let it rise again then make one ball into a pretzel and dip immediately into the soda bath, then make the next and so on. one additional tip that helped to give the pretzels a lovely brown color was to give it an egg wash instead of brushing them with butter. A really good recipe on the whole though.

Great recipe!! I used my kitchenaid for about 3/4 of the kneading and the rest was done by hand - they turned out fabulous - soft in the middle and chewy on the outside.  We also made about 20 little ones as opposed to the large ones and they were delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

The pretels were really good - I made them for an Oktoberfest party and got a lot of compliments.  I had to add a lot of extra flour to the dough - it was too sticky to work with after adding just the stated amount in the recipe.  I worked the dough by hand.  I had to use a spatula to take the pretzels out of the water bath - they were a little easy to fall apart at that stage, but it got easier the more I did.  It took a lot longer than the stated time - mostly due to having to keep adding more flour and the learning curve in shaping the pretzels - next time I might make "stix" instead of the traditional shape.  Would probably go a lot faster the 2nd time around.

These were insanely good!!! I portioned the dough into 8 pretzels, and they were still a good size. They were gone a few hours after I made them...my husband ate 4 in less than 10 minutes. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

Oh my goodness! These were delish! I almost made the "Mall pretzles" but i'm really glad I stuck to this recipe. Nobody in the house gave it lower than a 9 on a scale from 1 to 10. The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I used more yeast than the recipe called for, because the Fleischmann's packet had a little over 2 Tablespoons. I divided the the dough into 8 parts, instead of 6, because there are 4 people in my house, and I wanted them to get 2 each :). And they were super simple to make!  BRAVO DREXLER!!!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!!! I AM DEFINITELY KEEPING THIS AND WILL BE MAKING IT AGIAN SOON!

This recipe is fabulous!  We love soft pretzels at our house and these were a huge hit!  We tried half of the batch with mustard and the other half with cinnamon & sugar!  Either way they were amazing!  The only note I have is probably a no brainer for most people but I didn't think about water temperature when adding to the flour/yeast mixture and used cold tap water and had to repeat that step using warm water to activate the yeast.

SUPER Awesome and easy (i'm eating one as I type). It took in total about 50 minutes for me to make and I did add quite a bit more flour during the kneading process (I used my mixer w hook for kneading). They are SO soft and good. I am going to make my kids a turkey sandwich on pretzel "bread" for dinner using a pretzel cut in half. very easy and delicious. Will make again.

I was super excited about making these because it sounded so simple with great reviews - but ended up disappointed.  Fairly easy to make, I used parchment paper on my baking sheet to prevent sticking, and also stretched the dough by lifting off the counter and pulling after I had rolled it out to 15".  I felt the flavor was lacking, not a lot of that pretzel flavor as you'd expect.  My husband said, "not bad" which I think sums it up.

Thank you for the great recipe! It's my first time baking bread and I had low expectations- but it turned out amazing! Only changes I made 1) I needed more flour - almost 3.5 to 4 cups and I used 1 cup bread flour and the remaining self-raising flour. 2) added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of 1 teaspoon white sugar. 3) brushed with melted butter before putting in to oven. 4) also made "mini" pretzels abt 20 of them- tried to get the "rope" to be as thin as possible before twisting them in to shape. 5) also let the dough rest and rise for abt 30 mins before working on it. Turned out beautiful after 8 mins in the oven. Served hot with another coat of melted butter and cinnamon sugar .. Yumm! Everyone at home loved it. I do have some questions though- after it's cooled for few hrs, what's the best way to reheat them before serving? I placed them in the microwave for 10 secs ( may be not the best idea, was lazy to reheat the oven) and they had become more chewy and harder and "flatter".. Any suggestions on how I can serve them / reheat them so that they taste as good as they come out of the oven? Thanks again for the great recipe and all the reviews- will surely make them again :)

This was my first time trying to make pretzels and it will definately not be my last. These were the best pretzels I have had since I was in germany and a nice change from the frozen ones that I normally have to buy at the store!

Papa! Thanks so much for this recipe-so easy, so quick, and the ingredients are close at hand. The texture is perfect and the taste is even better. I was feeling German today, so I did a second batch (why not-they are easy and quick!) substituting out 1/2 c of the AP flour with rye flour and adding 1 Tbs of caraway seeds. You've got this down, Papa!

Very tasty, I will attempt to make them again.  I found that I had to use a cup more flour than was called for.  The dough was very soft, and when I tried to make the tradition shape, after adding them to the water most of them turned into looking like cow pies.  I am jealous of the pics.    But again, very tasty and soft.

These are the best pretzels I have ever eaten! I had never made  pretzels before and they were really easy. I've made them twice, and the second time I cut some of the ropes into bite sized pieces- perfect for kids (and adults)!

Pure heaven. I just tried this for the first time, exactly according to the directions,and I'm surprised the neighbors haven't swarmed the house for a bite. Everything about this recipe is wonderful, thank you so much for posting!

I had a recipe once for homemade pretzels but lost it. They were buttery crispy and perfect looking in shape and size. I was on the hunt today to replicate that recipe. But, this was not it. "THESE WERE HUGE"!!! Even after I put them in the pretzel shape, they would just not quit growing! By the time they came out of the oven, they were faintly in the shape of a pretzel as they were just so thick and wide. So, I hoped that they would at least taste like a pretzel, and they did, but slightly. They reminded me more of a "really salted bread." And, the taste was okay, because who does not like hot soft bread, especially with salt. I will see how they hold up tommorrow and then maybe cut down the middle and use like pretzel rolls for a sandwich, as they are so thick. They will get eaten, I am sure, but they are not at all like my old recipe or like a mall type pretzel.

These are absolutely delicious! If you double the amount of pretzels made (to make smaller, but more pretzels) like me, I would recommend soaking them for 15 seconds total, while flipping them over half-way.

I like the general idea of this recipe and was super excited about having all the ingredients on hand; however, I was rather disappointed overall.  
As other reviewers mentioned, the traditional pretzel shape is virtually impossible to master.  It very well may have been me, but I also had a rather difficult time with the twists.  I finally gave up on the fun shapes and made little bites.
Secondly, no matter how much I greased the baking sheets/how much wax paper I put over top (with spray butter on top of that), the pretzels still stuck.
Apart from the shape and sticking issues, I was not impressed with the flavor of this pretzel.  Again, it very well may have been something I did wrong, but I probably won't ever make these again.  :-/

These Pretzels were fantastic.  They baked up nice and huge!  Perfect for cutting in half like a hero for a sandwich (Ham and swiss with mustard, or Cream Cheese.)!
My kids liked moulding the dough.  I used the bread maker on the Pasta/Dough setting adding all the indgredients in at same time and it still worked great.

This was so simple to make!  My family absolutely loved them and right now we are thinking of what else we can make with this.  Like most people I increased the the amount of pretzels made (I divided it into 9 pieces instead of 6).  I used 4 1/2 c water and 4tbsp of soda when boiling and it was the perfect pretzel taste!  Also I used about a cup more flour while kneading it and only kneaded it for about 4-5 min not 8.  I shaped them into a simple twist and followed the cooking times almost exactly.  These were one of the best quick dinner rolls that we've had in a long time!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect!  I relocated to Florida from the Philadelphia area and have since been on a quest to find a recipe that could match the famous Philly pretzel...this is the closest one by far!  I'm so happy to find a recipe that didn't taste like the pretzels were soaked in butter and sugar for days. Thanks so much for sharing! :d

Wonderful -- I also used my Kitchenaid mixer to do most of the kneading.  I also tried out making a Kummelstange by sprinkling with caraway seed and kosher salt -- worked great!

Very, very good! I made 16 smaller pretzels. You do have to add a lot of extra flour because the dough is rather sticky but it still tastes great. Be careful, if your pretzels become too thin they tend to become hard after a while but its nothing a few seconds in the microwave cant fix. I served them with the "Nacho Cheese Sauce" recipe off this website and it was unbelievable!

These are wonderful and easy to make. So quick we have them often for supper. I've replaced one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and they were also great.  Couple of tips:  1) Don't cut the kneading time short or the dough will turn to goo when you do the baking soda dunk and 2) I limited the Boil to a 15 second per side dunk and that worked well.

Excellent soft pretzels! The second time I made them, I used whole wheat flour for the last 2 cups, and used olive oil instead of the melted butter. I used the dough hook on my mixer for the kneading. The only problem I had is that the finished pretzels stuck to the pan pretty badly, even with lots of oil.

I really liked these pretzels.  They were easy to make and delicious.  I froze my unbaked pretzels individually on a cookie sheet overnight and then combined them into a ziplock bag.  Took three out tonight and did the soda bath and baked them!  The only reason why I rated the 4 stars instead of 5 was that they didn't really remind me of the bavarian pretzels that we had over in Germany, these weren't as thick crusted or dense.  It could be the soda bath vs. the lye.  Overall, awesome recipe though!

My first time making pretzels. It was fun. They were ok for having been made at home for the first time. I used hodgson mills yeast(incredible product)I think they will get better as I become more experienced.

I cooked them on the middle rack for the 8 minutes, just barely a light golden color but not too dark, then brushed the rest of the melted on them before they cooled. These were great and much cheaper than those at the mall, but just as good if not better.

I'm wondering if it's something to do with the 3 tablespoons of baking soda?  Should that read teaspoons?  And when do I put it in (with the salt?)  Really, I was terribly disappointed because I love soft pretzels.

My hubby and I are eating these straight out of the oven with mustard.  Even with fingers burning, they are impossible to resist.  YUMMY!  My dough was a bit soft, I think because I didn't put quite enough flour.  But it was easy to work with, and these are delicious.  A definite keeper for us.  **Forgot to mention that I doubled the recipe and also added about 2 TBS malt powder to the flour.**

Quick and easy, loved it.
I made a second batch with pumpkin seeds, ground flax seeds and chia seeds mixed into the dough to boost the nutritional value. Turned out great.
Thanks Papa D.

Mine didn't turn out great, they stuck to the pan. I tried again with more grease on the pan and they still stuck. And I guess I'm used to sourdough pretzels because these just tasted like rolls in the shape of a pretzel.

These turned out AMAZING. Nice and crunchy outside, soft inside. Perfect pretzel taste. Added more flour like others stated and a bit more salt. Did the kneading with my Kitchen Aid mixer. Been looking for a good pretzel recipe and this one is it!!

Wowza, these are great pretzels! I've tried to make pretzels before, but they were not even close to the goodness of these. Super delicious. I 
wasn't very good at shaping them, so we turned out with 4 weird looking pretzels and 8 pretzel "sticks". I also proofed the yeast with the water and sugar before I added the rest of the ingredients and kneaded it in the kitchen aid. I think the baking soda water does the trick. We will be making these again very soon!

Just pulled these out of  the oven! OMG they smell and taste AMAZING! Lightly crispy on the outside and so tender on the inside. 
SUPER (and I mean SUPER) easy to make. I had to leave them in for 10-12 minutes to get the browning I wanted.
Made them today for this afternoons football game and I haven doubts there will be any left by kick off. All ready planning a beer variety, and Italian herb variety and a cinnamon sugar variety!

These were great as pretzel buns for burgers. Used the recipe as written but rolled the 6 "ropes" into spirals. I had to smoosh them down a bit while they were cooling but they were perfect for the purpose. They made 3 total "buns" (6 circular pretzels). If you do this, make sure you pinch the end of the rope to the body of the spiral, or it might start to unravel. Cheers!

These were definitely yummy. They were best with cinnamon and sugar. My kids loved them but said they taste like a mix between bread and a pretzel. The crispy outside was like a pretzel and the soft inside like bread. It did take 20 minutes for them to even brown a little on top and they got a little too brown on bottom so next time I may try the egg wash in place of the melted butter to try to get the tops brown before the bottoms get well done.

Finally a pretzel recipe that worked for me!! I did have to add about 1 more cup of flour during kneading. Used dough hook for most of it, then by hand to make sure I stopped after it wasn't sticky anymore. So very good, thank you.

OMPretzelyGoodness!  These were fantastic!  I did the recipe EXACTLY like it is written, and read many reviews as well.  We tried both cinnamon sugar and kosher salt after brushing with butter.  I also put the boiling water/baking soda into a smaller pot so I could dunk the pretzels for less time.  These were so extraordinarily yummy.  I made 16 medium/small pretzels.  My only recommendation is to double the batch!

I just made this for the first time, but instead of dipping it and adding salt, I layered in Feta cheese and Spinach. My goal was the wonderful spinach and Feta pretzels Starbucks makes, and I got pretty close. I will definitely do it again. I mixed in almost 2 cups of cheese, and a cup of cooked spinach as I was shaping the pretzels. The breading was PERFECT for it. (Not really pretzelish, but a wonderful snack)

Extremely easy to make and absolutely delicious - better than the ones in the mall. Once they finished baking, I spread melted butter on them and added the salt (the salt I used was sea salt cracked fresh from a grinder). Will definitely be making these time and time again! Next time will do some variations like garlic and cinnamon/sugar. Can't wait!

5 stars fresh out of the oven.  Plan on adding about an extra cup of flour--some just to make it come together in the bowl and the rest while kneading to keep it from sticking.  I recommend using parchment paper on the pan rather than greasing:  the pretzels lift off easily after "resting" to go into the soda bath, and they lift off easily after baking as well, without getting soggy on the bottom.  This one is a keeper!

yum!  these were pretty easy & fast for doing them the first time.  there's a certain confidence you get once you make certain recipes several times, so i think they will get even better when we make them again, and again, etc.   i was amazed how good they looked, i got my hands slapped cuz i kept trying to sneak one before we had our dinner.  my hubby made a couple into hoagie rolls & we split them afterwards & stuffed em with sausage, mustard & saurkraut!  delish!  and he's taking a turkey samich on one today for lunch!  will definitely make again!  good little weekend recipe-something everyone in the family can help with too!

We loved this receipe, I followed other peoples suggestions and made 8 pretzels.  I hand kneaded them and did need about 1/2 cup more of flour.  We did four with kosher salt and four with cinnamon sugar. We will diffently be making these again but next time will baste with butter before putting in oven and after and then add the cinnamon sugar as I think they will taste better. Yummy

Easy and REALLY GOOD- you will need to add a LOT more flour in order to get a smooth NOT sticky pretzel- I didn't. And mine were not so pretty but tasted good.  I think next time I'll make little bites.

I can only give this a four since I didn't make the bread dough, I used frozen dough and let it rise overnight.  However, I did follow the directions for dipping in the baking soda water and the high temperature for the oven.  I think these two steps are critical.  I have made pretzels before, but never with the baking soda water.  I did this and they tasted like actual pretzels.  Thanks so much for the tip!

I made these pretzels with my hubby and kids the other day, and we had a lot of fun. It was my first time making pretzels, and I thought they were actually pretty easy. They looked great coming out of the oven. I didn't think they tasted that great. I guess it's a combination of flavor and texture that didn't really appeal to me...but I wouln't say I hated them. Just three stars.

Nice and chewy on the inside, a thin layer of buttery crispiness on the outside. Like a few others I had better luck bathing the pretzels while the water was boiling. Also If you mist the inside of your oven with water just before putting the pretzels in it helps in dryer climates.

The flavor of these was great!  We used brown sugar in place of white just because my almost 3yr. old was helping and insisted.  Also, I found that after doing the water bath on a few that ones that were in the water just off the stove turned out best.  Next time I'll keep the water simmering the whole time.  I did need to cook mine an extra 5 minutes but ovens vary.  Can't wait to make these again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Maybe I should have stuck with the original size and not tried to make these a larger pretzel?  They were ok, but once they were cool noone wanted them any more.

These were so disappointing.  I read the recipe and thought it was quite vague and different from other pretzel recipes I've read but the reviews were positive so I tried it anyway...they were terrible.  I should have listened to my gut and chosen a different recipe.  These were not worth it.

I’m a fairly experienced baker, and these did not work out at all, as instructed. Too much yeast or rising time, these fell apart in boiling process and become soggy and wet when baked. This recipe could probably be redeemed, but followed as is, was a huge fail.

It's an all around decent recipe, but I would suggest either omitting the yeast altogether or letting the dough proof for 30 minutes before shaping. doesn't taste very "pretzely" but still delicious with cheese for dipping.

Wonderful and not too hard to make.  Even fun for the kids to roll out the dough and shape the pretzels.  Made these about 10 times so far since they are SO good.
I found if I do not added butter on top they get more of a golden brown, or maybe just be sure to add a little butter not too much.  Just experiment with one or two with the butter since it could depend on your oven.  Also I made a water/baking soda bath so you don't need to flip the pretzels, and a spatula to scoop them out.
If you do not dip them in the water/baking soda bath, you can make them dessert pretzels by adding sugar and cinnamon on top.
Do use a flat baking sheet without ridges as these things tend to stick.

These are great.  I made them for the first time yesterday and turned into a fun activity with the kids.  Did not make any adjustments other than I doubled everything.  I served as part of a bratwurst and sauerkraut dinner - these were the in place of rolls - people enjoyed the novelty

I must have done something wrong. They came out soft and buttery not crisp with a soft inside.  Still good!

I made these pretzels today.  The first time I've attempted anything like this, although I've been making bread for over 40 years now.  So easy to make too!  From start to finish, 2-3 hours.  The pretzels turned out very light and fluffy.  I will definitely make them again.

I make this recipe all the time. They are best straight out of the oven, but are tasty reheated. They have a delicious buttery flavor. These are great with the coils wrapped around small sausage links as an appetizer, or hot dogs as a bun alternative. I made them with the sausage links at Halloween as "mummy toes". They were a huge hit!

I tried these for the first time and they turned out pretty good!  I found that I had to bake them longer in the oven in order to get the preztel to brown nicely, and they were best when eaten right out of the oven.  I would definitely try making these again :)

I've been craving "ballpark" pretzels (thicker and slightly crustier than the mall ones) and I figured it was probably easier to make them than drive around until I found one!  I just made these and they taste amazing!  They're a little softer on the outside than I prefer, but the taste and texture of the inside is perfect.  If I can get the outside a little chewier, they'll be absolutely perfect.  Maybe I didn't boil them long enough?  I slid them back in the oven (which I had already turned off) for a few minutes and they're a little better. Not sure what else to try, but I'll definitely make these again!  
I did have to add an additional 3/4-1 cup of flour, but they rolled and shaped beautifully.  I cut the dough into 8 balls, formed one, put it in the water, then rolled the next one out.  As soon as the next was rolled into a long rope, I flipped the boiling one, then formed the rolled one.  As soon as it was formed, I put the boiled one upside-down on a paper towel and immediately flipped it right-side-up onto a Silpat on a baking sheet.  I sprinkled it with kosher salt and put the next one in the water, then repeated the process.    The timing of this worked for me.  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!!

YUM!!!  Wow, are these amazing!  I followed this to the letter, although I needed a smidge more flour, as my dough was incredibly sticky.  I popped the dough in my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook attachment to knead, just to make my life a little easier.  Worked wonderfully :)  It is really helpful to roll the dough into ropes, set aside and let them rest as you make the rest of the ropes, and then go back to the first rope and roll it longer.  Letting it rest for a couple minutes makes it so much easier to get the desired length.  Also, I would like to add in case anyone is new to bread making, it is imperative that the 1 and 1/3 cup water you add to the yeast mixture is warm.  That will activate the yeast.  Anyways, this is an awesome recipe- easy and delicious.  The pretzels have a lovely crunch on the outside, but are tender on the inside.  Perfect snack with a nice cold beer!  Thanks for sharing Tim Drexler  :)

Really good. First time making pretzels and this was easy. Followed another reviewers suggestion of letting it rise before making the pretzel shape. Be warned though...these will be huge if you only divide the dough into six balls. I divided it into eight and they were still huge. Will try 10 next. This is definitely a keeper :-)

Random 2 min. long search had brought me to this page. That's where search ended. Made them so far on 3 occasions. Family and friends loved Papa Drexler's Bavarian Pretzels so I had to share on my Blog the link to this page and a photo gallery of made by me pretzels. Danke!

This is the best pretzel recipe ever! These are the best pretzels I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly and the pretzels had a nice crispy crust and were almost light and airy in the middle. 

I twisted half of my pretzels into the traditional shape and the other half into the shape on the picture for this recipe. The picture shape is best as these pretzels spread out and look nicer in the looped and twisted shape. I think that the next time I make them, I'll divide the dough to make 10 pretzels instead of eight and roll them into 10" ropes for twisting. I did this with one pretzel and it make a nicer looking pretzel that baked a little more crispy.

I also had some leftover hot dogs, so I wrapped ropes of pretzel dough around those and baked them per the instructions and they were amazing as well. They would go well served with a sauerkraut mixture of chopped onions sauteed in bacon grease and tossed with sauerkraut and crumbled bacon.

I've made these several times, to glowing reviews. Sometimes right before I bake it I will add shredded cheese and/or garlic salt (instead of sea salt). Once you get the hang of making them it's pretty fast and easy.

Great treat! I made only 4 pretzels (instead of the six it says in the directions) which which proved to be a slight mistake since they swelled to the size of of the baking pan.

I had a bit of issues with the recipe since the pretzels turned out tasting like baking soda and they were very doughy even after 15 minutes in the oven, plus it took closer to an hour when I was all done.  I will definitely try again, though.

Excellent recipe. I had no idea that making these would be this easy - or turn out so well. Straight-forward, simple to follow recipe. Had a slight problem with them maintaining their shape after bathing them in the water/baking soda, but some practice should help!

I got a new KitchenAid mixer for Christmas and used it to make these pretzels. (It kneads the dough for me.)  My hubby said these were the best pretzels I've ever made. I melted some Velveeta cheese with some milk to make a cheese dipping sauce. I bet honey mustard or garlic butter would be yummy as well, though. I also think it would be simple to add chocolate chips and sprinkle with a bit of sugar instead of course salt. YUMMY!!! We will be making these again soon, but doubling the recipe. Also, I think I will divide them into 8, instead of 6 pieces, because they were HUGE!

These pretzels are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, just divided the dough into 8 pieces instead of 6.  The next day I threw them in the oven to heat them up and glazed them with some leftover cookie frosting.  The salty/sweet combo is awesome!

Very easy to make and very good!  I did use warm water to activate the yeast, the recipe didn't specify. I also forgot to add the salt to the dough.  I did the butter and salt before baking and they had plenty of flavor, even with my mistake.  We had lots of fun trying to get the pretzel shape right. No matter how they looked, they tasted amazing.   Great recipe, thanks!

I'm not sure what I did wrong - but these didn't turn out well. Both batches got stuck to greased cooking sheets. And things were incredibly weird during the water/baking soda stage as well.

Tastes like Pretzels. I am quite impressed with my first ever try on this. The dough is a little hard to roll and knead, but definitely worth it. I found it a tad doughy after 10 minutes so I left it in for another couple mins, making sure they didn't burn.

This recipe makes great pretzels! It's best to have at least two people working together, so one can shape the pretzels while the other dips them into the baking soda bath. An afternoon of pretzel-making would be a fun project to do with the kids!

I've tried several of the "Mall Pretzel" recipes but this is the best one yet. Like other reviewers, I did have to put more flour to make it less sticky. I also make 8 pretzels instead of the 6 it calls for. A keeper!

My 10 year old made these for science class and they turned out great.  Had to add additional flour like others but followed the recipe exactly.  They didn't look pretty - she's only tne but they were great.  Reheated them in the toaster oven on the 2nd day and they were great again.  Tim, thanks for the recipe.  P.S. my daughter was the only student in three years to do pretzels for the project - everybody else did sweets or bread.

The taste was wonderful.  This was my first time working with dough however and I can tell its going to take some practice.  I used one teaspoon of brown sugar also.  I think this would be great as pretzel sticks.

These pretzels tasted great the first day, but by the second they were pretty "blah." The recipe was very easy to follow, except like everyone else I had to add more flour. I think I over-worked the dough, because it was a bit hard to roll without it breaking apart. However, it was easy, and they tasted great the first day. :) I just melted some velvetta (just for consistency), and added shredded cheddar cheese to dip the pretzels in and they were a great snack. I might make again, but only as many as we can eat in a day. Good luck :)

ATTN: CHADANDKATE you wrote "I'm wondering if it's something to do with the 3 tablespoons of baking soda? Should that read teaspoons? And when do I put it in (with the salt?) Really, I was terribly disappointed because I love soft pretzels."  The baking soda does not go into bread mix, It is used in the water bath. Add the soda to your water and boil. What I do is boil each pretzel in the pot(placing them top in first)30sec per side. Then I place it topside facing down in a strainer in the sink. I put a little flour on the bottom, and then place on a greased baking sheet. It is at that time I sprinkle salt on the top of the pretzel. ...I saw your post and just had to help, hope you see this

DELICIOUS.  I followed the recipe as is and I'm making these for a second night in a row now, and I cannot wait for them to be done.  The first batch was gone in less then 10 hours (mind you I made my first batch at midnight!).  Last night I did just salt, but tonight I did some salt and then some brown sugar, I'm hoping they come out as amazing as they did last night.

My 4 yr old helped make these. I would not mold into pretzel shapes or loops again. I got a much better crust when I made sticks. Not too hard on the outside and soft on the inside. I needed an extra cup of flour to work with the dough. Our family prefers the sweeter topped pretzels so I am not sure if I will make these again.

Yummy! I agree they are better straight out of the oven.  However my dh and I were able to enjoy them for a couple of days by warming them up in the microwave.  The recipe was easy to follow even though I have never made anything like this before.  Thanks!

These are FANTASTIC. And easy to make. And addictive. And therefore, very dangerous! I have made lots of soft pretzel recipes, and this is my favorite yet. Simple, yet tasty. I also made the same recipe into 8 good sized pretzels. One tip - the recipe did not call for a greased pan, so I didn't add any butter or oil to the pan before baking. When I tried to take the hot pretzels off, they stuck. After taking a couple off minus the bottoms, I decided to let them cool ON the pan. this worked much better.  I will be making these tasty things again.

I changed up the recipe slightly. I used one packet of Fleishmans highly active instant yeast instead of one whole Tablespoon.  Also, sugar gives yeast something to eat so I changed the sugar  to one Tablespoon.  I increased the salt to 1 teaspoon.  The 1/3 cup warm water I added near the end of getting all the flour in to help make the dough smoother and a bit tackier to help in rolling it out later.  I removed my bowl from kitchenaid and put the bowl with dough in a preheated oven at 170 degrees for 45 minutes to help with a nice first rising.  Take out to counter then half it to get 15 or so blobs.  Rolled out nicely very smooth soft dough.  I let it raise for 15-20 minutes after shaped.  Dunked in hot (not boiling) baking soda mixture.  Put on greased sheet.  Also I moved baking them to the top rack in the oven, it makes the bottoms a bit lighter.  My yield was 15 medium sized pretzels.  I topped with butter and course sea salt.  Extra soft, very nice recipe!  Thank you =)

WOW! I was going to make Mall Pretzels from this site and I'm so glad I didn't. These were absolutely wonderful! They are so quick and easy to make. I added a little extra flour while kneading (it was a little sticky at first), and I skipped brushing on melted butter. I just used the water/baking soda bath and sprinkled generously with kosher salt. I got 10 very large pretzels (they even LOOK like pretzels). :) This is my new go-to recipe for pretzels. You just can't beat how quick they can be put together and baked, and the taste is a bonus.

YESSSSSSSS! My Dad made something similar to these when I was a kid, and he's gone now and I've been missing them. This recipe is the closest one I've found on allrecipes that tastes like my Dad's.  I used my breadmachine. I didn't brush with butter because my Dad didn't. This is a great recipe, thank you so much for it!

These pretzels are delicious!  I had to add quite a bit extra flour because the dough was very sticky, but otherwise they turned out perfect.  I used bread flour, but next time I'm going to try them with all purpose flour so we can see which way we like best.

While they didn't look like pretzels they tasted like pretzels!  They were alot of work but the taste was worth it.  I also had to use more than 3 cups of flour in total.  I think I used just about an extra cup and a half to get it into a workable dough.  Would make again.

What a great and simple recipe!  With the exception of having to add about a half cup of flour while kneading the recipe is precise and easy to follow.  I'm a novice with yeast cookery and mine were crispy and buttery on the outside while dense and chewy on the inside.  However, my pretzels were hilariously deformed. This didn't stop my flatmates from gobbling them up (perfect with beer) but it did make for uneven cooking.  In the future I'll do them "nugget" style but its great to get the kitchen cred for doing real pretzels even if they do look a little folksy.  I'm thinking one could skip the salt and toss the nuggets in cinnamon and sugar after baking. I'm also plotting how to get peanut butter into the middle of these theoretical nuggets but I fear it may be difficult to inject jelly donut style.  Thanks to the Drexler's for sharing this great recipe!

These were totally fab! My German husband also gave these his seal of approval. I was always curious about why a pretzel skin has that sharp, clear, almost bitter taste and now I know. This will definitely be a regular snack in our household!

I am from Germany and grew up on this stuff...these days, I catch it at Aldi's when I can.  It had been a long time since they had them, so I searched to make them myself. The first batch was a tad cumbersome to make.  It had been years since I made anything with yeast....that was not the problem...it was the baking soda bath.  I made pretzel sticks. That was bad enough, but I can see how that could forever make you turn away from making pretzels in general.

You also do NOT need 3 cups of water and three tablespoons of baking soda for the brine-you could make a half a cup and add 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda.

I researched applying the brine and you do NOT need to dip and soak for 45 sec.  You can just brush it on.  That said, my second batch turned out totally awesome.  I doubled the recipe, cut the dough in 4 pieces,  froze three of them.  I shaped the remaining piece in a little loaf and cut it into 6 roughly equal pieces.  I then rolled each between the palms of my hands until the strands were about 5 inches long, arranged them on a baking sheet with parchment paper, dabbed them with a napkin soaked in brine on all exposed sides, turned them over, repeated on the remaining side, took a knife and cut 3 equally spaced slits in each, brushed on melted butter and stuck them in the oven.

You could also make pretzels of course, but I like being able to cut everything open, so I can spread butter across everything.  This is hard to do with the regular pretzel shape.

Not sure what I did wrong, but after rolling out the dough and shaping it I placed them in the boiling water and they just fell apart. They didn't look anything like a pretzel . I had to cook them longer than the 10 minutes to get them not so doughy. They actually tasted pretty good, just unappealing.

This was my first pretzel recipe I ever tried (I am very much a novice when it comes to baking anything involving yeast), and I'm pleased to say that even I couldn't ruin these. I followed the recipe with one small adjustment: I read in another comment that reducing the water bath from 3 cups to 2.5 strengthens the effect of the baking soda, so I followed that advice. I will say that the dough was VERY sticky, and while I was kneading I was having some trouble keeping everything together. I ended up adding quite a bit of flour (gradually, during kneading), and thankfully it all turned out fine. 

My only real advice is to Google how to twist a pretzel before you go about making these. You might think "who doesn't know how to twist a pretzel?" but I promise you, if your only preparation for twisting a pretzel is that you've *seen pretzels before,* you're gonna have a hard time. 

Oh, and double the recipe, because everyone is going to want seconds.

It will take about 4cups of flour to be workable. Stretch to longer than the 15 inches, more like 18-20 inches. You will get no more than 4 on a large baking sheet if divided into 6 portions.

I found them too thick, but I knew that when I wasn’t rolling them out. ANd they weren’t really brown and crusty on the outside. I’ll try them again. Any suggestions?

This is my 1st attempt. Just took them out of the oven.
I thought they would be darker and left them in for about 15 minutes, total.
I never did a soda bath before, either. I lost one completely.
Recipe is easy, but that bath is tricky and I would recommend a shallow pan for easier access

Only change I would make is that after the 10 minutes in the oven I would flip them and cook for another 2 minutes just to crisp the bottom a touch.  Other than that a fantastic recipe!

These turned out excellent.  I made sticks because they are easier to eat and I am too lazy to make traditional shape!  I was seriously concerned with the soaking phase because they puffed up and became very friable.  I ended up baking mine for about 13 minutes.  Now to make some beer cheese!

Amazing, delicious and easy.  Needed a lot of flour during the kneading.  Baked 10 minutes and could have had a minute or two more.

I made four batches.  One with 100% Whole Wheat Flour and no butter (I forgot), one with Whole Wheat Flour and Vital Wheat Gluten, and two with Unbleached White Flour and butter.
  The whole wheat flour pretzels were okay, but they needed more salt... and butter to dip them in.
  I much preferred the Unbleached White Flour version.  They were pillow soft, chewy, and really good.

I thought these were great and will definitely make them again. I probably added another half-cup of flour while kneading the dough, and next time I will probably add a little more butter on top for extra flavor. Overall, these turned out well and were fairly easy to make.

More flour needed. To prevent soggy-ness, took out of water placed on cookie sheet prepped with no stick spray. Let drip off a bit, then moved to sprayed baking sheet. Egg wash. Took a bit longer in oven than recipe...quite tasty!

These are wonderful and deserve 10 stars for ease of making and end product!  I made the recipe as stated (at little hesitant due to the lack of rising time) and it works!  Couple of notes:  1) I used to Kitchen Aid to knead the entire time and used at least 3/4 cup more flour; 2) note the 1 Tbsp of yeast!  This is more than 1 small packet but less than 2; and 3) my baking time was closer to 16-18 min.  Thanks so much Papa D!!! 

ps.  Mustard/cheese sauce is great compliment.

Followed the recipe without any changes.  These were AWESOME!  When it comes to shaping the pretzel, I saw a video that suggested rolling the dough into a log shape that's shorter than what you need, waiting a couple of minutes for the gluten to relax, and then rolling out to the right length & twisting into the shape.  This made it a lot easier!

This recipe tasted good, but did not brown like they are pictured. Mine looked more yellow and only got crispy in spots. Actually I baked them two different ways- done in the oven and some in an electronic pretzel press. The ones in the press actually were crispier. The outside did not come out with a smooth outside. Real-deal  German  pretzels have an outer crust that almost looks like skin- very smooth with s split along the bottom. The European style pretzels are tough to make. our kind of flour is so different.

I've made 16 pretzels using  white wheat flour. I used the soda bath right after I removed the pot from the stove. That was a mistake. 
Allow the soda bath to cool off a bit. This allows the pretzels to maintain their shape, avoid the soda taste, and get crispy.

These were good in that any homemade bread is good. I'm making and comparing a few soft pretzel recipes in preparation for an Oktoberfest party, so I suggest1 - Use bread flour, not AP flour. The dough was really soft and sticky, I had to knead in some more flour just to handle it, and the first few I rolled did not develop good surface tension and absorbed water during the alkaline bath. Once I got the right amount of flour incorporated, they rolled better. I find that recipes made with AP flour tend to have this issue where ones made with bread flour don't. 2 - Use a full teaspoon of salt. The dough was a bit bland, and more salt would have helped.

Ultimately the texture of these is like a soft mall pretzel -- delicious in their own right. -- not so much a crusty pub pretzel which is what I'm after. 

Finally, I used a trick  for the alkaline bath where I baked 1c of baking soda for 2 hours at 250 to dehydrate it and raise the Ph, which gives better browning. Then I used 3T of this baking soda with the water, and dipped each pretzel for 30 seconds on each side. This yielded the best pretzel crust I've made to date!

Absolutely perfect if you follow the recipe! It made more than 6! I made a cheese dip with it- mix melted butter, cheddar cheese, Monterey Jack cheese and a little beer on the stove until all melted and blended. Heavenly!

Delicious. 10/10 when fresh out of the oven. 7/10 if you have to reheat them. Best when hot and fresh, for sure.

This recipe makes an authentic German pretzel!  If you divide the dough into four pieces, you will get pretzels that are the right size for a German bakery pretzels.  I have made these twice and they came out great both times.  An egg wash is visually appealing and I prefer it to brushing them with butter.

I have made this a couple of times, and I quite enjoy the taste of a yummy homemade pretzel. I like to make mine to use as a pretzel bun for sandwiches. It also good dipped in beer and cheese dip. My only issue is that the cooking instructions seem off, and I haven't been able to master how long to cook them for.

I made these  a couple of weeks ago. Dough was a little sticky right out of the bowl. I just used a little extra flour at a time as I kneaded the dough. They were easy and delicious. Everyone loved them. I could have baked a little longer for a crustier top. But over all a BIG HIT.

Made a double batch (using each batch to make 8 instead of 6) for a small party of 4 people. They were all eaten by the end of the evening. Everyone loved them! I will make these again, and I am posting a link to this recipe on my blog for others to find as well :)

These were so much fun to make and they turned out awesome.  Definitely will make them again and again.  I was looking for something to make for my "pub fare" party and these will definitely be on the menu.  When I make them for pub fare I will make them smaller so that they won't fill my guests up to quickly.   Made the way the recipe calls for they are impressive and beg to be made into gourmet sandwiches.

Made a huge big batch for a social event. After rolling the first 30 into pretzels, I made the next 30 into pretzel buns which was way easier. Delicious!!!

first time I've made pretzels, so was just doing what it said and hoping it was sensible. These turned out great, although the fatter ones needed an extra minute to brown. Very easy with great result, although they stuck to the tray and I think they could have used another minute.

Just made these.  Like other reviewers, I had to add additional flour while kneading the dough. I made about 20 pretzels. Mine didn't come out crisp... ended up putting one pan back in the oven for an additional 5 minutes which helped.  No problem with them sticking.  I'm wondering if perhaps my water/ baking soda bath got too cool since I was making so many.  Does anyone know if the heat of the water plays into the crispness? I made them for an Oktoberfest party tomorrow, hope they are still good.  May make another batch tomorrow before the party!

This isn't exactly a review as much as a question:  after boiling/dunking the pretzels in the water bath are you supposed to let them dry before brushing with the egg wash and baking? I made pretzel rolls once and they weren't very successful.

this recipe is fabulous!  very easy, tasty, and versatile.  i portioned dough into 12, and i allowed my 5 yr old daughter to help roll out and make shapes, and despite her best efforts, they still turned out great!  we made braids and twists, along with other indefinable shapes, and they all baked perfectly.  but beware!  if you don't dry off or drip-dry after taking out of the water bath, NO amount of non-stick anything will save you from losing the bottom of your pretzel to the baking sheet/parchment paper.  we used a cinnamon/sugar topping, and a honey yogurt dip after.  yum!

This is my favorite pretzel recipe. Crisp and buttery on the outside, warm and soft inside. My boyfriend and I enjoy pairing these with a good microbrew, they really do taste great with a nice beer. I cut the dough into 8 pieces instead of 6 to get more pretzels. If I have any leftover the next day (which isn't often!) I slice them lengthwise to use as roles for sandwiches :)

These scored big time with the kids & hubby!  I still prefer the "Mall Pretzel" recipe for taste, but, these are MUCH easier & faster to make.  These pretzels do not require any rise time.  I made 12 small ones instead of 6 large
