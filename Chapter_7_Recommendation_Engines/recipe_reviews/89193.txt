I made this soup for a family gathering and got mixed reviews -"It's a drink, it's a smoothie".  Once I tried it I agreed.  Suggestions from the crew included using a liquer versus the rum.  I would like to try it using Amaretto.

i went on my first cruise and had cold banana soup.  i fell in love with it and when i found this recipe, it was close and yummy as is.  I used imitation rum since i was serving it to the kids and i don't drink so i didn't have rum on hand.  I also added a couple dashes of all spice and nutmeg, that was the flavor that was missing from what i tasted on the cruise and it turned out great!!!!
