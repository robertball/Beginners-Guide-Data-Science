This was an incredible chicken salad.  It had a lot of flavor, and was excellent served on a croissant.  I added a few walnuts for extra crunch.  I took the leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was still crunchy and wonderful tasting.  Thanks for a new favorite recipe!

I wanted to try this recipe because the chicken is grilled, and wow did it make a difference!  This is definitely my new favorite summer salad. I spread it on mini croissants for finger sandwiches at a party, and it was a HUGE hit--they were the first thing to go from the buffet table. I reserved some leftovers for myself and it was even better the next day after the flavors had melded. I didn't use nuts since I was making it for a group, but I think they would go great in it too. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this to use up some grapes. Didn't make the dressing, use mayo instead and grilled chicken leftovers. Very good---loved the combo of apples, grapes, dill, and tarragon w/ the chicken, a winner for sure! Thanks!

Awesome.  Dried tarragon works just as well, and I used raisins in a pinch.

This was VERY tart. I would omit the vinegar all together next time. It had potential though.

Really good, just a little bit of spice to the chicken but the dressing really cools it down.  I have found that I usually don't need as much dressing as the recipe calls for, I guess it depends on how much mayo you normally like in your salad.

Good, but I would omit the vinegar next time...way too tangy for my taste.

This is a good recipe, but I think it is a bit too tangy with 1/4 C. vinegar and it distracts from the other fresh ingredients.  I increased the amount of chicken and there still seemed to be too much sauce. I enjoyed the unique flavors!

Next time I will also use the marinade but I folowed the recipe to use my leftover chicken that I had previously roasted.  I made the dressing with a dash of cayenne to make up for the red pepper in the marinade.  I added walnuts and used more grapes since I didn't have an apple but the fresh tarragon really made this imo!  YUM!!! :)

Delicious. The tarragon adds a new and beneficial flavor to an old standby.

This dish is dee-lish.  I'm a vegetarian and made half with chicken and half without.  So, the only substitution I made was for the vege half I added a soy breaded chicken patty substitute cut up into cubes. I used rice vinegar and half the lemon juice in the dressing as a previous reviewer suggested.  It was fabulous.  Next time I'll try adding walnuts.

I made and served this yesterday for a baby shower for my DIL.  It was very tasty and not a all hard to make.  I made no substitutions or major changes.  I did buy and bakeand cube the chicken about 3 weeks ago when it was on sale.  Then I froze it until Saturday when I put it together.  Good recipe.  Thanks for posting it.

Refreshing and perfect for summertime!  I doubled the recipe - so I would have enough to last all weekend!  The only thing I would do different next time is use a little bit less vinegar.  I also added 2 teaspoons of white sugar....but probably would not need to do that next time, when I decrease the vinegar.  Will make again and again!  Oh - also - I used dried herbs and used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream - since that's what I had on hand.

I made this great dish for the first time this evening, using fresh herbs from the garden. The family agrees that this recipe is a hit, although we found the dressing a trifle too sour for our taste. I would use the rice vinegar in the dressing instead of cider vinegar next time and cut the lemon a little. I thought chopped pecans would be a lovely addition, too.

I loved it! I will make it again. Simple  preperation but it took a lot of time. I lightened up where I could on the fat content, and the crushed red pepper. Next time I make it i will add a lettle less vinegar and lemon juice because it came out a little runny, but not bad if you want to serve it over a bed of lettuce greens.

I was looking for a recipe similar to one my friend makes (she only gave me an ingredient list without measurements and I totally messed it up) and this was great. I used left over roast chicken, cut the ingredients in half because I only had about 2 cups of chicken, accidentally forgot the vinegar and lemon juice in the sauce but still tasted great! Oh and I added slivered almonds for crunch. Yum!
