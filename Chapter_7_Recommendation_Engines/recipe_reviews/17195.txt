Great recipe!  I can't keep my husband away from them.  Couple of tips I found useful...mix the ingredients in a food processor!  I have never had a problem with dryness and I think it is because the processor does a much better job mixing the ingredients and getting moisture into the bisquick that I could.  Also, they normally take 20 - 25 minutes to cook.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I've been using this recpie for years except I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of milk (I'm never very exact when baking hehe)
After I take them out of the oven I put them in a covered container with a towel in the bottom. It absorbs the extra grease from the meat and cheese and they stay warm if you're taking them to a gathering. They also stay moist like that. Mine are always a big hit and my Mother makes them the same way and hers always go fast too!

This is the recipe I have used for years to make sausage balls.  I have always thought they were too dry though.  My mother also made them this year only using a recipe that called for only 3/4 cup of baking mix.  Hers were much better.  You could actually taste something besides the mix.  I would say make them with only half the mix and they turn out moister and with more flavor.

VERY IMPORTANT: COOK/BROWN THE SAUSAGE FIRST IN THE SKILLET!! Then, while the sausage is still warm (and drained if desired), mix with Bisquick and cheese in bowl. Balls form easily and cook in oven for 15 minutes.

I like this recipe the best of all I have tried.  These are just right,not too dry.  I sometimes use hot sausage and sharp cheese for a stronger flavor.  One hint...I "warm" my sausage just a bit, 30 seconds, in the microwave.  This makes it a bit easier to start mixing.

These were delicious. I took them to a Christmas party and everyone loved them. I doubled he cheese and added 1 tsp garlic powder. They turned out very moist and tasted good even the next day.

This was simple to make, however the ingredients are all fairly dry so be prepared to mush them together with your hands. Also, to give it a bit more flavor, I use Sharp cheddar cheese.

These are great.  I've been cooking these for several years.  I use an 8oz. jar of Cheese Whiz instead of shredded cheese.

They were quick but I thought they were a little too dry for our taste buds.  I would probably not make these again.  I didn't think they had all that much flavor, either.

These are great! I backed the Bisquick off to 1 cup and resisted the urge to add a little olive oil (just keep mixing, like making cole slaw, it will moisten up) & plopped in just a little more cheese (1/4 C max)  Don't forget to take your rings off and pour a glass of wine before you start.

I used 2 pounds of sausage instead of 1 and 4 cups of cheese. Takes care of the dryness problem. I have a hard time stopping once I start eating these.

These were gone quickly, mostly only eaten by the guys.  I jut back on the biscuit mix and used my kitchenaid and dough hook to mix it...super easy.  I also sprinkled garlic salt and red pepper on them before baking.

I think these were yummy as long as you did cut down on the biscuit mix.  I only used 3/4 of a cup.  Great football watching snacks!!

I also tweeked this recipe, after reading some of the reviews.  I did let the cheese & sausage come up to room temp, and it was MUCH easier to mix.  Also used my Kitchenaid stand mixer and let it do all the work, took just a minute to completely mix up.  I also added a 1/4-cup of diced onion, and a sprinkle of garlic powder... cut the biscuit mix down to 1-cup, and upped the cheese to 1-1/2 cup.   Also baked them 25-min, and they came out perfect, nice and moist & were gobbled up in no time!!

I did like one reviewer suggested and only used 3/4 cup of bisquick mix. They were awesome! Made them as a new years day breakfast treat, next time I will try with hot sausage for a spicy kick.

Was dissapointed.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I did exactly what the recipe called for.  The first time I used Italian Mild Sausage, never cooked through.  I tried a variety of temps. and times.  Just kept being raw.  The last attempt was at 450 for 20 mins. turned out like rubber.  The next day I repeated recipe with Esskay sausage, they still did not turn out right.  Do I need to precook the sausage.  What did I do wrong.  I had these years ago (someone else made them) and they were great.  These were awful.  HELP

This sausage ball recipe is easier due to fewer ingredients that most but just as good!  I cooked mine longer because they just didn't look done after 15 minutes.  Perhaps I rolled them larger than suggested.  Either way, they were great!!

Like another reviewer, I cooked the sausage first.  Definitely made things easier!  Also, do add some milk.  When mixing, add enough to make the mixture moist and sticky (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup?).  Use your judgment.  Otherwise they come out dry.  But even dry, my sons gobbled them up.

These were very easy to make.  A little different than the Recipe my Mom used to make.I added extra cheese to suite my family.  Next time I think I will use a bit more Baking mix to absorb more of the sausage grease.

Just baked these up for Christmas breakfast.  A little bland for me, but this can easily be remedied with a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage and sharp cheddar cheese crumbles.  Did add one egg, a splash of milk and then a bit of ice water to make everything stick. I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil, sprayed with nonstick spray. I'm thinking these would be great to have in the freezer for quick breakfast on way to school or a lazy morning with a quick sawmill gravy over them! Thanks!

This is almost identical to the recipe ingredients that I use.  I make these often and they are a big hit everywhere that I take them.  I do use a little more bisquick and a little more cheese and I add a few drops of milk so that the mixture is not too dry.

So quick and easy my 10 year old made it. We added a little red pepper to add a bit of spice and it was a huge hit with even the pickiest of eaters!

Really good and easy to make. They came out a little dry, so perhaps will use a less lean meat next time.

I have made these many times.  The key is to use the hot or spicy sausage (Jimmy Dean or Tennessee Pride brands are good) and use extra sharp cheddar.  Everyone raves about these every time I bring them to parties or make them on game day.  I am careful not to over-bake them to keep them moist.  Sometimes I throw all of the ingredients in a food processor to save time which  seems to make them a little more moist.  If you do it by hand, just be sure to keep working the ingredients together until really moist (kneading it a little).  This should keep them from getting too "cakey" and drying out.

Perfect! We always make a double batch because we eat 1/2 of them while we are making them.  I use a stand  mixer with a dough hook; just dump it in and turn it on low and watch them come together.  Made the size of English walnuts I bake them for 8 minutes.  Perfectly cooked - not dry at all.

This was tasty and easy to make, but for some reason was not very popular at my holiday party.  People thought they looked like weird cookies and didn't want to eat them.

This was a great recipe and extremely easy.  I did do a couple things different.  First I used my hands and mixed the bisquick and sausage together and then microwaved the cheese and then added it. I used a block of cheese instead of shredded because it makes the sausage balls moist.

I had a sudden craving for sausage balls, so I randomly picked this recipe.  I've used a similar one that turned out great, but the proportions seem to be a little off with this one.  I agree with everyone else who said you should cut down on the biscuit mix.  Also, I ended up having to cook mine closer to 25 minutes than 15.  Next time I make these, I'll probably use one of the other recipes.

Way too "breadey".  The volume of biscuit mix is much too high.  Cut it down by 1/3rd if you want more meaty sausage balls.  And, if you want them spicy, you'll need to add some spice to this.

These did not turn out well for me, they were to dry. Next time I will add a little milk, or either cook my sausage then mix. Also, took like 25 - 30 minutes to cook.

Only used a cup of baking mix, added a little garlic powder and ended up baking about 25 minutes.  Turned out pretty good.

Another Superbowl flop, these took a lot longer than 5-15 monutes to cook, more like 25-30 minutes. And in the end they turned out somewhat rubbery. :-(

Someone made these as a appetizer for my grandma's 90th birthday, they were a hit.  So when we got back I looked for a recipe and found this one. the first batch was very bland so we ended up haveing to add spices to it  Made it but also added a splash of milk to help mix the cheese, sausage and bisquit together.  it was okay, nothing to rave home about.  sorry!

Great snack food or appetizer. I just decreased mix to one cup and used mild sausage for added flavor.  Definitely one I'll use again and again.

I really hate review ratings that are based on the way a person changed the recipe.  But, mine is.  I wouldn't have made it, though, if I hadn't changed it.  And still I didn't care for it.  First of all, BROWN THE SAUSAGE BEFORE YOU MIX THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.  I don't know anyone who would want to eat sausage after it's only cooked 15 min.  Next, the proportions were way off.  It didn't have near enough cheese and the biscuit mix didn't brown.  If you're looking for a good sausage ball recipe, keep looking!!

These were ok.  A little dry though.  I've never had sausage balls before and I had heard they were great. I think I still prefer regular sausage patties.

These were ok. The texture was a little weird, everyone tried one and that was about it. Not a very big hit at Christmas and I probably won't make again. Thanks anyways.

Good, basic recipe. I added a bit more cheese.
