Awesome recipe!  I slow-cooked mine in the crock pot and the turkey breast just fell apart.  It was more like pulled-turkey!  I threw in some little red potatoes and had an instant meal.

Deee-lish!  I used dried basil instead of fresh and red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice.  I cooked a 3 lb breast in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes, then reduced the heat to 375 and cooked for about 90 minutes (until the thermometer read 180).  My husband was skeptical, because he doesn't like the traditional turkey done at Thanksgiving but he couldn't get enough of this.  And, my one year old daughter was shoveling it in.  She's a picky eater, so you know it's good if she approves.  We will definitely be eating this regularly.

I had never cooked a turkey breast before and was not sure what to do, this recipe quickly gave the answer. I am not a big fan of cloves so I replaced with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in the rub, what a fantastic flavour.  A huge hit with the family.

Excellent!  Very easy and quick!  Great flavor.  I broiled mine in the oven, 375 degrees for about 30 minutes, until the meat thermometer was 168.  Boy I can't wait to try this on the grill.  Thank you so much for a great turkey recipe!!!

I've made this recipe a couple of times it became a staple since last year's Thanksgiving, since my family is only a family of two   I don't want to make a whole turkey, I made in in the regular oven, first put it to broil for 10 minutes each side and after let it cook for 45 minutes at 400 degrees, it turned out juicy and  flavorful.

This was the first recipe I found for grilled turkey breast and it is "excellent".  I have made turkey breast many different ways but this was so tender and tasty; that I may never make it any other way!!!

My husband and son decided they didn't want to eat, but I went ahead and made this anyways since I had marinated it.  I added more lemon juice and brown sugar and cooked it for about 40 minutes on the grill at medium....marinating it every five minutes or so.  It came out perfect.  My two pound turkey breast was GONE!!!  They couldn't get enough!  I can't wait to make it again and this time, I will save more of the marinade, heating it to make a sauce.  It was great!!!  Thanks!

Never prepared turkey other than on Thanksgiving & this was truly amazing. Looking for side dishes? Try the Squash/Onion/Pecan recipe. Or the Cranberry Rice and/or Canned Cranberry with Toasted Cinnamon Pecans recipes! I believe it may satisfy ANY pallet! Footnote: try to marinate it as long as possible. I could only marinate for about an hour, yet can only imagine what its like marinated for a few more!
(BTW- If you cant "grill" it, preheat oven to 350 F. Place a frying pan on med-hi, pour marinade and meat in pan and cook for about 5 minutes each side to "sear". Pour remaining marinade and the breast/cutlets in a shallow baking dish & cover with foil. Bake for about 20-30 minutes. So tender AND juicy!)

I've made this a couple of times & we really enjoy the flavor blend. I have used dried basil rather than fresh, skipped the cloves, marinated overnight, then cooked in slow cooker. Nice combination of flavors for sure!! Thanks for the recipe.

My fiancce & I decided to have Christmas alone this year so we fired up the grill and LOVED this recipe! I didn't have whole cloves on hand so I used ground cloves and mixed it with the other ingredients - worked perfectly! If your grill tends to get too hot or juices from the turkey sparks flames in the grill, try propping the lid open a small amount with a SAFE pair of tongs to allow a little air in - it will not dry out the turkey. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I made just a few changes based on other's reviews. I used cinamon instead of cloves, I added some paprika and ground cumin to the rub which I loved! I marinated this in the fridge for several hours and then I seared each side in a pan with the marinate. I then poured the marinade over the entire turkey and baked in the oven for the appropriate time. AMAZING!! My 9 month old devoured this, as did my husband and I! I will be using this marinade for Thanksgiving!

Wow--crazy delicious. I used breast tenderloin turkey which is a great lean cut. I substituted peppercorns for the cloves (both for taste and convenience), maple syrup for the brown sugar (because I was out of sugar) and red wine vinegar for the lemon, as another reviewer suggested. I marinated the turkey for only 2 hours and baked it instead of grilling, right in the dish they marinated in, on about 375, turning once or twice and cooking til a tiny bit brown on the outside and no longer pink in the middle. My husband and I had it the first night as a main dish with a salad, the next day for lunch on a turkey and swiss sandwich, and the day after that on turkey wraps (lettuce, cheese, ranch, tortillas). You'd think I'd be turkey'ed out, but I could eat it again today if there was any left...

FINALLY  a delicious marinade! I, however, didn't have turkey breast available and had to use split chicken breasts instead. And, the weather looked threatening, so into the oven it went as per someone's suggestion of 375 degrees. I baked until the internal read 175 degrees and broiled it until golden brown. I used the pan juices to make a gravy, which was equally as good.  I can't wait to use it on chicken or turkey for the grill!

My grocery only had bone-in, so the butcher de-boned & skinned a double breast for me. The string-tied breasts looked pretty thick to cook in the recommended 30 min.  Webber cookbook says to sear 8 min per side over med. high then 45 min of indirect med. heat.  Delicious.

I was really disappointed with this. I marinated for over 24 hrs because of a change of plans and still the turkey tasted like plain turkey plus it took well over an hour to be done. I made exactly as written using fresh lemon juice since the recipe doesnt specify fresh or bottled.

The combination of flavors in this is incredible. Since our grill was covered in ice and snow, we used the advice of a few others and "broiled" it and then baked it.. This didn't work out so well for the amount of turkey we had. It was juicy inside but verrrry dry inside. I cooked just two turkey breasts (about 1/2 pound each). Making it again tonight, and we will not broil. Slow cooker or just baking it is the way to go.

Really nice & juicy! Doubled garlic (never too much in our house).  Not big on cloves, as a spice, so used one, ground up in mortar & pestle, added to marinade & low sodium soy sauce.  Started marinating night before.  Great with veggie & Mary's Healthier Potatoes!  Thanks Danielle for a recipe that makes healthy turkey tasty!

This marinade is just like the one I use all summer on any grilling meat. I cut up chicken to finger size pieces and grill. Incredible taste. Sooo easy and tastes wonderful. Good on beef too. Just marinade longer. My go to marinade for grilling anything.

I made this with turkey breast cutlets. I did not have whole cloves of garlis so I just added 1/4 tsp. of minced garlic. Also, I followed someone elses suggestion for baking at 375 for 30 minutes. Flipped half way through cooking.

Really delish. I had a 3pm breast and I doubled the rub and the marinade. Saved 1 portion of marinade to baste with. Yum yum yum. Took a littlenmorenthan 40 min on the grill but well worth it! Make sure you have bread or something to sop up the juices!

This was very good. I used two turkey boneless breast tenderloins and cooked them on the George Forman at 325 for 15 minutes. I skipped the cloves and marinated the breasts in a food saver for 8 hours. OH SO GOOD. My husband is VERY picky and he raved about this one. Definitely a keeper.

Really easy and good. Used dried basil (no fresh) and just sprinkled the spices (used garlic powder) over the turkey, marinated and baked at 350 until 170 degrees. Will make again.

These are absolutely wonderful!! Have made them several times.  My family requested them for Easter dinner.   I usually let mine marinate all day if cooking them in the evening.  
(Can also use chicken breasts)
My grill does not have a lid so I just cover with foil and it seems to work just fine.

This actually came out really nice although a little bland for my taste. I like things a little spicy. So I took the liberty of adding 3/4 teaspoon chilli powder and a little chicken broth to the marinade and it was wonderful.

This is really good.  Instead of rubbing on the ingredients, I just threw everything in a ziploc bag and marinated for about an hour.  I also baked it at 350. It still came out really tender.  I think next time, I might put in a little less of the brown sugar.  My kids and husband loved it though.  I will make it again -- I'm always trying to find dinners that are not chicken!

Wonderful!  I left out the cloves and roasted it in the oven instead of cooking it on the grill.  I marinated it overnight.  It came out moist and delicious!  I will definitely be cooking this again.

My husband, who is usually pretty good at the grill, managed to turn these turkey breasts into black, charred remains, and they were STILL JUICY inside!  I will make these again, but will cook them over indirect heat, as I do chicken.

Absolutely love this recipe.  Decided to make this for Thanksgiving in 2011, simply because my mother in law insisted upon having some turkey.  The rest of us prefer ham.  One bite of this, however, and the ham was left on the serving platter, and the turkey was devoured.  Great for cold turkey sandwiches, too! This has become a family favorite.  Simple and delicious; my kind of meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent!! My wife & I recently made this recipe & we loved it... The only thing we did differently was insert garlic cloves into the turkey instead of just regular cloves.

This was EXCELLENT! I ended up merinading the breast for 2 days (life happens!) before grilling it. I basted it as it grilled. It was a hit with the whole family and now replaces turkey from the deli!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very, very tasty!  I had never grilled a turkey breast before, but this recipe was easy and enjoyed by all.  My only comment is to watch the turkey on the grill closely - I put it on a hot fire, lid down as directed, and when I went to turn it, it had burned on the bottom.  I cooked the other side over indirect heat and it was perfect.

I'm probably one of the few people who is giving this a low rating, but it's only because the flavor of the cloves came through so much and for me that just ruined it. Sorry.

Reduced the soy sauce by half and marinated overnight.  Used a stovetop grillpan and these came out wonderful!  Flavorful and juicy, although I am glad I reduced the soy sauce.  Next time I might add a little ginger to the marinade.  Very nice to have a non-Thanksgiving style turkey recipe.   This one is a keeper!

Very delicious.  I used a turkey breast with bone by removing the skin, adding the rub and marinade, and cooking on 400F for about 1.5 hours.  Came out beautiful, and tasted great!

Other than the cloves, this was pretty ordinary.  The meat in the vicinity of the cloves was definitely tastier that the rest.

This was the best! The whold family loved it.  I can't wait to share it with guests!  I made it late and only marinated it for an hour and a half and it still turned out scrumptous!  I used thinner turkey breasts and grilled them on a preheated to 400 degrees grill for about 8 or so minutes per side and they were beyond moist and the taste was to die for!  Can you tell we loved it!  Thanks you so much for this recipe!

I marinated a turkey roast in this seasoning over night.  I baked it in the oven for over 3 hours.  The meat was falling off of the boneless roast lol.  This is an excellent one thanks!

This is the best turkey I have ever tasted.  It is very tender, and very flavorful.  My kids won't eat turkey without cranberry sauce to help it down.  But this they eat without the cranberry sauce and they go back for seconds.  even the 2 year old.

Really good marinade.  I used boneless, skinless turkey breasts and baked them @ 350F for about 35 minutes.  They came out super juicy and tender.

It was actually an accident that I had to use this recipe! I got a Perdue 3 lb turkey breast roast and unwrapped it. You are not supposed to take the foil off, because it actually will unravel! So, I decided to marinate and grill it. BEST TURKEY I EVER MADE! I do Christmas dinner every year, and I will definitely use this again! I received so many compliments!

I will never cook turkey traditionally again!  This is the best recipe for holiday turkey EVER.  I marinated the turkey breast overnight and cooked it in the crockpot in the morning.  I didn't use cloves because I don't like them, and I still put butter slices under the skin because some habits are hard to break.

Cooking in the crockpot? It was so easy! No babysitting for hours, no worrying if it was undercooked or overcooked, no worrying about when to get the sides started so everything finished at once.  And the flavor?  SPECTACULAR!  The soy sauce acts as the brine, and the seasonings flavor the meat all the way through.  The turkey comes out moist, flavorful, perfectly done.  Mine even browned, but that might be because I used a cast aluminum crock, not a ceramic one.  

Cooking the turkey via crockpot inspired me to keep the mashed potatoes, gravy, and stuffing heating in their own crocks, which freed up the oven (and my sanity) for everything else that needed to get done.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was very good! Next time I think I will either reduce or eliminate the use of the cloves.  They were a bit overpowering for our tastes, but the turkey was otherwise very flavorful and moist.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Danielle!

Excellent recipe!  I used cloves and cinnamon, red wine vinegar, lots of garlic, and basil and thyme-fresh from the garden.  I doubled the marinade recipe and marinaded for 8 hours.  This was fabulous--we cooked on the rotisserie on the grill.

I thought it was pretty tasty. I used dried basil and ground cloves (added to the rub), then 1/2 of the brown sugar (next time I'll leave it out entirely, I think). We don't have a grill, so I followed someone's suggestion to cook at 350F for 75 minutes. I dumped the rest of the marinade over the turkey and cooked it-basting at about halfway. It turned out perfectly juicy inside and tasty outside.

Fantastic!!!! I read through the reviews before trying this out as my "first" Thanksgiving turkey. I did as one previous person did and baked it at 425 for 15 minutes then dropped it to 375 for 90 minutes. I was very nervous about how it would turn out....but it was wonderful and all of our guests loved it. I will be using this every year!

The first time I made it we all loved it! Even my cat, Riley, who dumped over the garbage to get at the bones. We now call this recipe "Riley's Turkey Breast" and make it often. It's a keeper!

Delicious!  I tried this with a turkey I shot last week.  It was perfect to get out that "gamey" taste.  I think it could even use a bit more basil.  It had kind of an asian flavor because of the soy sauce and would probably pair well with some fried rice.

Excellent. I used this on a skinless, boneless turkey breast.  Did not remove from marinade and baked covered in a glass dish for 50 minutes until thermometer read 170.  Very, very tasty with reserved juice.

very delicious marinade, great flavor, but a bit on the salty side.  I cut the soy sauce down by about half and that takes care of it.

Very good.  I marinated mine for about 18 hours.  I was using wild turkey so I wanted to let the marinade sink in a little more.  I doubled the brown sugar and garlic, but turned out very flavorful and even my wife (not into wild game at all) took a bite and said it was delicious.

I fixed this for my family today & everyone thought it was delicious!  I cooked it exactly by the recipe except I placed it in the oven for two hours @ 350 degrees!  I removed most of the marinade but left a few tablespoons to mix with the gravy once the turkey was finished.  The turkey literally just fell apart once we took the netting off!  One thing I wasn't sure of was if I should leave the garlic cloves in while cooking and I did, perfect!  I wouldn't say it was a strong nor suttle flavor, just perfect!   I'll use this again with the turkey.

I made this for dinner earlier in the week.  I did not change a thing and it was absolutely incredible.  MAKE SURE YOU GET BONELESS AS DIRECTED.  I purchased what I thought was boneless, and I was unpleasantly surprised when I was preparing the marinade and realized it had a bone.  It really made it cook unevenly.  The ends were done and the middle was still completely pink.  I sliced it until I found pink and then put it back on the grill.  It still gets 5 stars because that was my silly mistake.  Everyone should try this, it's a nice change to have turkey when it's not Thanksgiving.

4.5 stars according to the meat eaters in my family. Very easy for me to put together, although I added all the ingredients to the marinade instead of rubbing some on and them marinating. Very moist and flavourful. Thanks!

This was ok, I followed the recipe exactly (rare for me) and found the flavours to be very subtle, which is okay for someone who likes that, but I like flavours that make you sit up and take notice.  I might play with it a little next time, maybe add some fresh rosemary and lemon thyme.

This is quite a good recipe!  The only changes I made were to substitute dried basil for fresh and ground cloves for whole ones.  It had a unique but pleasing flavor, and while it wasn't the most outstanding turkey I've ever had, I'd definitely make it again.

Works very well.  Basil adds a slightly different touch than the usual soy-based marinades;  however, I prefer to avoid the strong taste of the cloves which can be overpowering.  Try cutting back on these.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I decided to have Thanksgiving in July and made this Marinated Turkey Breast recipe (along with Amber's Super Stuffing and Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole both from this site).  I had about 2 1/2 lbs of turkey breast and I doubled the rub and marinade because I like strong flavors.  I also marinated the turkey breast for a little less than 24 hours.  We put it on the grill and it got a little burnt but it tasted great -  the next time I make this I am going to burn it again!  Oh, and it was still moist!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is the BOMB!  My daughter just harvested her first wild Turkey and was so excited to cook and eat it. I've had wild Turkey before and it always had a wild taste and was so dry and tough. So I found this recipe and see what it could do for wild Turkey. I am so happy to report it was THE BEST Turkey I've ever had wild or domestic. I followed the recipe exactly except for the cloves since I didn't have any. It had awesome flavor and was very tender and surprisingly juicy!  I will definitely be saving and referring back to this one in the future!

Didn't marinade the full four hours, doing two hours instead, it was great! Did it on the grill, took a little longer than 30 mins, but it's well worth the wait!

I am going to marinate a whole Turkey breast starting today and will be putting it in my infrared deep fat fryer (all the great sealed in flavor of deep fat fried Turkey without the oil and danger, best device invented!!) on Friday for a Wild Women with Wine party I am hosting at my house. I will come back and let you know how it goes!

This was fantastic.  Didn't have a grill so I seared the marinated breasts in a frying pan, 4-5 min. per side, then placed skin side up in a shallow baking dish.  350 degrees for about 60-75 minute.  I also doubled the marinade and added it to the baking dish so I could baste and have some to spoon over the finished product.  Unbelievable, moist and juicy.  Got rave reviews from the in-laws too!

Ingredients used are similar to most soy sauce marinades, but not as good.

This marinade is quick and easy, an VERY good on both chicken and pork (since turkey isn't always available.) Will definitely make again!

I love this marinate, I will be using this one again.  My family just loved it and we are not big fans of turkey meat... there’s was no leftover.

I have made this many times with a couple tweaks....I leave out cloves, and add some red pepper flakes. I also have grilled it briefly for color on both sides, then put in crock pot with some beef broth. I have used this method for pot lucks and cooking for a crowd. Wonderful tender juicy results. Thanks for sharing this one!!

This was awesome - I couldn't believe how tender and moist turkey could be. I didn't have lemon juice so I used lemon grass instead (also ommitting cloves). I also baked with a lid on for 25 mins at 375 and then lid off for 10 mins at 400. I'll def get turkey breasts again - who knew?!

This was a very easy mix.  I actually just mixed all the ingredients together, without doing the rub on the meat or putting the cloves in the meat, and liked it better than when I followed the recipe as is the first time.  Still great flavors including the clove

I tried this recipe, and maybe it was because I didn't marinate for very long, but the flavor did nothing for me, I was really disappointed. I cooked it in the oven and it came out juicy and cooked perfect but the flavor just wasn't anything special. Maybe I will try again but not for a while. Thanks anyway.

Few changes: I made this with chicken breasts; chopped garlic cloves and threw them in with the marinade; also skipped step of rubbing the breast with salt and basil, just threw them in the marinade as well.  So yummy!

I left out the cloves with no substitutions and it was fabulous. Marinated it overnight and grilled it for 30 minutes. My son who hates turkey, loved it!

Okay, so the first time I made this, the flavors were totally overwhelming.  I used smaller pieces of meat that time, and it killed the whole turkey taste.  I tried it once more, this Thanksgiving, with a much larger piece of breast meat, and it was wonderful-- now I see what everyone was talking about!  I did reduce the marinading time just a bit, but it made for a delicious and juicy piece of bird, and such a lovely alternative to a huge roast turkey!

I got a turkey breast from my work for Thanksgiving and I wanted to do something interesting and flavorful instead of the same old boring bird. This recipe was great!!! The turkey still tastes like turkey, but with a great kick! Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I have made this several times, the first time I didn't add all the cloves because I'm not a huge clove lover.  I found that it really did NEED ALL THE CLOVES.  When I take this to a tailgate I always take the recipe because people ask for it.  Thanks for sharing

Chicken was very tender with lots of flavor. I grilled a whole turkey breast (with ribs)and grilled it for over an hour. It was worth the wait!

I used turkey tenderloins.  I did not have fresh basil, so I used poultry seasoning and Italian seasonings, and kept everything else the same.  I broiled them until the temp was 180.  A definate keeper, moist and flavorful!

Very good, tender, and easy.  My four children and my husband loved it.  I left out the brown sugar because of a diet I'm on, but it was still great. I will make this again.

This recipe was wonderful. I am always looking for new ways to make turkey. I let the turkey marinate overnight and the flavors were wonderful.I also did not want to fire up the grill so just did it on the stove top and they turned out perfect.

Excellent!  Thank you for this recipe!  I was tired of preparing the same meats for dinner, so I bought some turkey breast and had no idea how to make it!  Hubby was not excited at the idea, but one bite changed his mind!  I marinated overnight and broiled for 6 minutes on each side...perfect!  This will be a part of our regular rotation now!  Thanks!!

Wow - this was fabulous!! I used a turkey roast. I only managed to marinate it about an hour. Then I cooked it on 350 for two hours and an additional hour on 300. It was one of the best turkey roasts I have ever had!

I have never tried making a grilled turkey breast before and thoroughly enjoyed this one. I thought the basil was a little bit odd considering the other ingredients but it wasn't too bad.

I must say, for all the raving about this recipe, I just didn't get it.  It was OK, but nothing more...and as far as "you can't over cook it" that's just wrong.  I felt that high heat really chard it...won't make again

My father is a wild turkey hunter and I have several wild turkey breasts that I wasn't sure what to do with.  This is a great recipe.  I marinated the breasts and then cooked them in my rotisserie using a basket.  Top Notch, will use this recipe over and over again.

I marinated our 9-10 lb. turkey in this sauce, and baked it in advance in an oven roasting bag with the sauce.  It came out great!  There was so little white meat on the turkey, though, that my husband went out to get just a turkey breast.  We marinated it in all the turkey juices (left over from the first turkey) overnight, cuz I just wasn't going to cook another thing that night!  The turkey got rave reviews from the 5 Chinese students and researchers who came over for Thanksgiving dinner, and I even sent the recipe home with the one woman who didn't speak English - through a translater, we learned she wanted to learn to make it herself, not take home any leftovers.  We'll definitely use this recipe again - maybe on the grill sometime.  Oh - I was going to put the whole cloves in the marinade, but I forgot, and it was still great.  I put the final batch of turkey juices in the fridge overnight, took off the fat the next day, and thickened the juices with corn starch to serve with wild rice stuffing.  Yum!

We liked this a lot....although I did change the recipe a little bit.  The biggest change was instead of using fresh basil, I used fresh rosemary.  If you're going to do this, use the rosemary sparingly because it can easily overpower the other flavours.  I also added more brown sugar than called for (about 2 tbsp). Very nice grilled dish....we will very likely make this again.

This recipe was AWESOME.  I am so glad I found it!  I had bought a 4 lb. turkey breast at Sam's Club in hopes of putting it on our rotisserie on the grill.  I didn't know what seasonings to use, so I browsed this site and found this incredible recipe.  

I used the full amount of marinade and rub, substituting the cinnamon for the cloves (great idea) and let it marinade in a gallon ziplock bag for about 6 hours.  Next time, I'll let it sit in there overnight for even more flavor within the turkey meat.

We had it on the rotisserie for about 2 hours, and it was perfect!  Very juicy and only a little dark on one side.  We just peeled the skin off before slicing.  It was wonderful!!!  I was eating it off the cutting board before it even got to the table.  My 5 year old twins also ate it up, and my husband declared, "we need to make this when my mom visits!"  That's a good sign.

Can't say we really liked this - I don't know if it was the marinade or the fact it was wild turkey breast we marinated.  It was edible, I just didn't care if I ate more than a few bites.

Considering how healthy and easy this is, it's surprising it can taste so good!  We also used 2 turkey tenderloins for 2 servings, but kept the rub and marinade quantities the same as for 12 servings, and it worked out perfectly.  We also marinated for 24 hours, then broiled the turkey instead of grilling, and it came out beautifully browned, juicy, and delicious!

Awesome marinade! I made the marinade and put the breasts and marinade in a big zip bag and pushed all the air out, then let it marinade overnight. Hubby broiled it instead of grilling it and it was sooo juicy and tender! Would definately make again and again!

The most flavourful turkey I have ever eaten. It was perfect, and marinating it for only 4 hours was plenty of time! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will definitely make this again. Thanks, Danielle!

Excellent, first time I ever smoked turkey.  I had sixteen people over and they all loved it.  I used a 9 lb breast and dried basil and it came out very tender and good.  Smoked on a my smoker for about an hour with indirect heat.

I added a tablespoon of oyster sauce and a teaspoon of Asian fish sauce to the marinade, and used low-sodium soy sauce. The fish sauce give the marinade an extra depth of flavor (umami). I grilled direct on both sides a high medium and then indirect to an internal temp of 170. Try a little fish sauce. It made sales the difference. If you’ve never used it, use sparingly. It has no fishy taste.

Very good, moist, had to omit the salt due to sodium restrictions. I would repeat this one again. I cooked it indirect in a charcoal grill.

I have made this recipe several times, but without the brown sugar and basil.  It is one of the best recipes around and I need to try it with the basil and brown sugar.  I would recommend to grill for only 5 minutes on each side to prevent the turkey breasts from over-cooking and being dry.  I highly recommend this to everyone!

These were pretty good.  I didn't have turkey, so used it on chicken breast instead.  I pounded the breasts out to an even thickness and cut them into strips then marinated them for about 2 hours.  I bakes them in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.                                                                                         The flavor was a bit strong, but overall good.  Next time, I will try it on turkey.

Substituted the basil for chopped fresh onions and coriander as well seasoned with Cajun seasoning along with salt , pepper , and garlic seasoning. Marinated ( 4 hours ) flipping every 30 minutes. Make sure the grill gates are mid level and grill for 15 minutes on each side.

The soy sauce does blacken the meat so you may have to flip prior to the 15 minutes. The coriander adds a delicious aroma and taste to the meat.

This was a nice change from chicken on the grill.  I followed the marinade directions, but added a few more spices.  I used fresh rosemary, thyme and basil and a little white pepper and cayenne and it marinated about 5 hours.  We used a charcoal grill and it turned out great - no leftovers!

This recipe just did NOT work for us. We put it on a couple of turkey tenderloins on a charcoal grill and the flavors weren't there. The thing is that this is really just a surface marinade. Nothing got into the meat. In addition, the combination of basil, garlic and soy sauce just didn't work. Still searching

I have made this recipe as is and cooked it on the grill with good results. I have altered the recipe after making it the first time and chopped the garlic and put in the marinade. I have also substituted dried basil for the fresh (~1 teaspoon). We have then smoked it on our smoker instead of grilling. It made this recipe even better!!

I put mine in the crock pot on low for 5 hours and then pulled it apart and made it for sandwiches.  I didn't have soy sauce so I used Yoshida sauce instead (slightly sweeter) but other than than I followed the recipe pretty closely.  It turned out moist and really yummy.

I didn't make any changes, I did find it a little tough, I will try it again in the spring when I can grill it is think that may be the reason it didn't turn out as well as I seen other rate it.

I really expected the turkey to be dry, but when I marinated it, using all those ingredients for about 6 hours, roasted at 425 for 10 minutes (hot oven) and baked about an hour at 375, I was rewarded with a moist, juicy, tender turkey breast, now what to make with the delicious leftovers!  Great recipe!

Do yourself a favor: take a break from chicken and use turkey breasts and give your oven a rest and use your grill...you won't regret it! I cut up some zucchini, red onion, portabella mushrooms, and yellow peppers (coated in olive oil, sea salt & ground pepper) and grilled them on the top rack of my gas grill while the turkey cooked below it. It was all amazing...turkey was super juicy and loaded with flavor for a change...and since I grilled everything it was a blissfully easy cleanup! ??

Marinated Turkey Breast Haiku: "Terrific turkey! Only one small swap I made, had to use ground cloves." Truth-time: I've never had turkey other than Thanksgiving baked turkey, and deli sandwich turkey. For real. I'm so glad that I picked up turkey breast at the butcher and made this recipe b/c it was absolutely wonderful. Marinade is similar to my favorite AR "Pretty Chicken Marinade", so I can't give this any less than 5 stars for easy ingredients (as mentioned, I only used ground cloves, maybe 1/4 tsp, instead of whole cloves) and a great flavor on a birdie part that I've never grilled b4.

I used this recipe for a friends memorial day cookout. And it was a big hit. All his buddies were coming up to me asking me for this recipe. I marinated it over 24 hours prior to the party. Let me say the flavor was outstanding. I have made this on several occasions and it always brings praise. Delicious...

I made this scaled down for 2 turkey legs and it was absolutely fantastic.  I just threw all ingredients together (did not do dry ingredients as a rub just mixed wet with dry)  and let them marinate for 24 hours.  I used whole cloves but again just tossed 'em in with the oil & lemon juice. Other than that I did it exactly as recipe states and it was incredible.  Best poultry marinade I've had in a long time. I roasted the legs in the oven but can't WAIT to try it in a charcoal grill.

Had this recipe on board our boat over Canadian Thanksgiving and cooked the turkey on the grill.  Without exaggerating, everyone wanted seconds; so much so there were no leftovers.  Will definitely do again.

I never marinated a turkey before - and I had a WHOLE breast.  So, I split the breast and used the rub and marinade.  My family LOVED it!  I was afraid it would taste like Thanksgiving turkey, but this marinade actually gave the turkey a completely different flavor....Very light and summery!!!!

My boyfriend and I had a mini Thanksgiving, just the two of us, so I didn't want to do a whole turkey. I cooked a big bone-in turkey breast with this recipe and it came out just perfectly - despite the bottom burner of our oven breaking and having to use the broiler to cook it! The marinade is definitely a different taste than your classic holiday bird, but so lovely. The only change I made was to leave out the cloves, because I can't stand them. Great recipe that I'll definitely make again!

Christmas dinner 2010...incredible!  Looking for a way to jazz up plain turkey my kids aren't keen about while trying to satify husband's request for Christmas turkey.  We all thought it was fantastic as written and will use this recipe again and again!  Thanks Danielle!

Awesome! I just put all the ingredients in my ceramic dutch oven, rubbed it over the turkey breast and set it in the fridge for a few hours until I was ready to cook it. Cooked it at 375 for about an hour and a half.  It was easy and delicious. I will be adding this to our regular rotation.

These weren't amazing, but they were easy to make and good enough. As another reviewer advised, I broiled it for 10 min on each side before baking it at 400 for about 45 minutes. Also, I opted out of the cloves since my family's not a huge fan of them.

Forgot the cloves and this turned out awesome!  Used turkey tenderloins that were pretty large.  Put the rub on and placed in the marinade early in the morning and grilled this evening to rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe really dressed up what my family usually considers a boring meat.  I did not add anything to the ingredients.  I did cut the turkey breast into smaller pieces so that I could grill it on my George Foreman Grill.  They looked great and tasted just as good!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome.  I put the marinated breast into the freezer until the weekend.  Let it thaw in the refrigerator for a day.  Great taste and really juicy.  This will be in our regular dinner rotation from now on!

I really tweaked this recipe, actually merged it with the recipe on this site for breaded turkey breasts because I don't have a grill and didn't want to use the oven since it was occupied with scalloped potatoes... the marinade is great, could really taste that the marinade had permeated the meat and was not overpowering at all, but nicely and delicately flavored. Not at all dry either...I marinated the breasts for about 6 hours in the fridge, then coated them with egg and dipped them in bread crumbs with a dash of garlic powder and pepper. Fried them lightly in just a smidge of oil on the stovetop... boyfriend said it tasted and looked like it came from a restaurant... and he was hesitant about turkey because I guess here in France it is considered a low grade version of chicken and nobody eats it... tasted like chicken actually... he didnt like the cloves, so next time I will omit them.

This recipe is fantastic!  I used dried basil, turkey cutlets, no cloves, olive oil instead of vegetable, and sprinkled cinnamon over cutlets as recommended in another review and let them marinade in a covered dish in the frig for close to 8 hours.  I put foil sprayed with non-stick cooking spray on grill grate and grilled cutlets for approx 5 min per side as they were not very thick.  Everyone from my almost 3 yr old granddaughter to my picky "meat and potatoes only" husband inhaled these.  I know I will make these again and will probably try with chicken breasts one day.  Thanks for sharing!

Very nice!  Cooked until 170 degrees on a George Foreman and it turned out tender and juicy.  Used the same amount of marinade for only a 1 1/4 pound turkey breast, so I kept the marinade and reduced it, making a glaze for the finished product.  Had no cloves, so I used both cinnamon and ginger, and the effect was pretty good!  Very unusual combo of ingredients made for a really nice flavour.  Husband loved it, son-who-doesn't-like-soy-sauce said "it's okay".

Turned out great. The husband actually thought it was boneless pork chops instead of turkey cutlets. The only thing I switched out was cinnamon instead of cloves - I didn't have any. Still turned out very tasty. Since I had sliced turkey cutlets instead of 2 large breasts, I didn't rub the seasoning on - just combined everthing in a bowl and threw in the turkey. Grilled on a George Foreman and the marinade turned a really nice brown with grill marks.

I liked this recipe but suggest that if grilling the breast be rolled and tied. Otherwise the thin side of a breast will cook faster than thet thick side.  When doing this again I would triple the marinade and save it.  I would reduce it by a third with a little bit of freshly grated ginger and some orange zest.  Then I would thicken it with about a teaspoon of corn starch dissolved in about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  Finally, be sure to let the breast rest for about 5 minutes after taking it off of the grill.  It will be sweeter and juicier this way.

This marinade is very good. I actually left out the brown sugar because I didn't have any on hand and it was still very tasty!

This was great! I added just a touch of Woreshire(SP)sauce. I think I added more garlic also to the recipe, I love garlic though. I do recommend this recipe.

Tried several times & have decided to just eliminate it from my recipe box. The flavor was ok, but either the weather didn't co-operate so we could grill or I didn't have the right type of turkey breast.  This last itme we baked it & it was ok, but I think I'll just forget this.

Excellent! I used turkey cutlets (which were 99% fat free) and did not stuff them with the cloves of garlic. I only added the minced garlic to the marinade. My finace grilled them and they were perfect. See the photo that I took. The marinade carmelizes on the turkey and is just delicious. Thanks for the recipe! It's definitely a keeper in my house.

AWESOME!  I used chicken breast instead of turkey as I didn't have any turkey.  I only used about 1 lb of chicken as well, but used the entire amount of rub and marinade the recipe calls for.    I also skipped the cloves as I'm not a huge fan and I also added just a little bit of salt to the rub.  It was incredible!

Wow, was this ever yummy!  I had some turkey tenderloins and wanted to find something to do with them and this sounded scrumptious!  I scaled down the ingredients a bit as I didn't have 3 pounds of meat.  Having said this, I did not keep my soy/oil ratio the same, only used about 1 tbsp of canola as I didn't feel that much oil was needed.  Didn't have the cloves, so just left out.  SO GOOD, definitely a keeper, really moist and tender, loved it!

This was so simple, requires most things i already have and quick to make. PLUS, the marinade (even though i only marinaded for 2 hours) makes the turkey breast tender and juicy. Pleasantly surprise at the results.

This really was an awesome recipe. I used a little more cloves and probably more garlic. I am not one for measuring so I sort of eyeballed it. The neighbors even yelled over the fence and asked what I was cooking because it smelled so great!

Used grill press to cook. It was too cold & too snowy to grill this on the outside grill here at the end of December in CO.  Served with a chilled pasta salad. Very moist & tasty. Fiance said it was the best turkey he had that wasn't on a sandwich & I agree. Better than any Thanksgiving dinner turkey I've ever had.

This marinade proved to be flexible, as I did not have cloves and accidently put parsley along with basil in the mix. Cooked in a slow oven, covered, along with chicken broth to make the gravy. The result was tender and everyone thought it tasted great. Thanks!

Excellent!  I grilled it just like the recipe said.  I did have to cook the breasts longer (around 15 min. longer).  After the 15 min. on each side, I put them in a foil pan and finished the cooking.  Delicious!

This was my first attempt at a turkey on the grill, and it was fabulous!  The turkey breast I had was 6 pounds, and came with a popper which I found very helpful.  I didn't flip it over, just left the 'meaty side' up.  It blackened but didn't get over-charred.  Incredibly tender!

Amazing.  All I could find on 12/24 were pre-cooked turkey breasts; maybe that made them better!  I used the entire recipe to marinate two 1.5 lb turkey breasts, then grilled & basted about 8 minutes to brown.  Mmm!

It was good, but I guess I expected more. It needed to be either sweeter or spicier to completely satisfy our tastes. I will do again but do some changes.

This was excellent.  I used 2 turkey breast tenderloins totalling a little over 1 1/2 lbs but kept all of the other measurements the same - we like strong flavors.  Even my 2 year old devoured it and she rarely eats meat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I used only one turkey breast (4 1/2 lbs) and grilled it for almost an hour. As suggested by another cook, I used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in the rub instead of cloves. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. My husband and children (ages 2 & 5) loved it. This is a keeper.
