I might call this "Poached Chicken with Tarragon". The chicken should be seasoned and browned and removed. The pan should then be deglazed with the wine and herbs (and a lot less tarragon!) Perhaps add a bit of butter to emulsify the sauce and then gently add the chicken back to heat and finish at a very low heat.

this was VERY easy to make and quick to put together with simple ingredients. it was very tasty and the sauce was great. i would change the quantities of spices, there was a little too much tarragon to my taste.

Fabulous.  It was amazingly tender.  I'll probably use a little less tarragon next time, but regardless, we all loved it.

As other readers said, this was truly easy and very good. Rather than use the tarragon which several said they didn't care about, I used fresh rosemary from my garden. Try it, you'll like it!

This was a suprising thumbs up from my picky hubby! I did omit the tarragon and used chicken broth instead of white wine. It was so quick and yummy! Next time I will double up on the herb mustard mix and broth, just to have more sauce.

Didn't love it, might be better if the chicken was browned first instead of just being "poached" in wine. Probably won't try this one again.

This dish is absolutely amazing!  I'm normally not one for tarragon, and I may add a little less next time, but this is probably one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had.  I recommend serving it with ratatouille on the side to complement.  The mustard is so sweet, yet it has just the right amount of spices for a wonderful taste-- and it's so easy to make!

Excellent!  Can easily be changed to accomodate individual tastes.  For example, I used less mustard after reading some reviews - and a little more honey.  I also used all fresh herbs straight from the garden.  If tarragon is not to your liking, use less and add more of the others.  Very easy to switch amounts and ingerdients.  I served with long grain wild rice and fresh from the garden squash.  A glass of chardonnay made the meal very simple and perfect.  In fact, I made this entire meal while chatting with my sister on the phone.  Very easy.

It was good enough to finish, but not good enough to make again.  The herbs are overwhelming and the chicken took much longer than instructed.  Also, you can't taste the mustard.

I was weary of trying this recipe because I read it used too much tarragon, but it came out outstanding! I put a bit more honey and mustard than listed just because I like those ingredients, and by accident I added twice as much dried basil, but it turned out excellent. It was incredibly easy, quick, and clean. I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe was ok, but I definitely will alter it a bit next time. First off I used chicken stock instead of white wine as some other people had said.. it didn't quite thicken as much as I would like - I would add a thickener at the end, then replace the chicken and simmer it in the sauce to enhance the flavour.  I also think that it could use a bit more honey and mustard. All in all my family still liked it, and I will probably make it again with those changes.

FANTASTIC.  Only changes:  I only used one tblsp. tarragon, and a half cup white wine.  I also added about two tsp. more honey, and added about a half tsp. cornstarch mixed with cold water to the sauce and boiled to thicken.  I served it with carrot soup and a green salad, thanks for a great recipe.

This was great; even my 13 year old had seconds.  Quick, easy and easily adaptable if you don't have all the required/exact ingredients.  We'll be having this again--Soon!

This is pretty tart, the mustard taste is strong.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but worth a warning.  Probably pretty easy to control by using different strength mustards.

This was really delicious.  Because it's simmered in wine, the chicken was moist & tender.  I served it w/ Roasted Vegetables (submitted by Saundra) and it was the perfect pre-holiday meal!  Very tasty and simple to prepare!
For those who posted that they ended up with dry meat, or little flavor, I would suggest following the directions precisely.  If done correctly, you just can't dry the meat out.  As for flavor, broth could easily be substituted, and maybe even a little balsamic vinegar.  I may try these, but I'm pretty darn happy with it just the way it is.  Even my picky 4 yr old ate it!  Truly a feat!

I personally LOVED this dish! I'd give it 4.5 stars, but rated it 3 because my husband and daughter didn't like it. If you like tarragon, it's a winner.

Very easy to make.  Fast and tender.  My kids didn't like the "green stuff" (tarragon, etc.) on the chicken, but didn't say anything more about it once they tasted it.  We will definitely make again.

This was very good and elegant looking after it was cooked.  However, it doesn't look so good when you make the herb coating.  Very easy and quick.  Served over rice.

Good.  I browned the chicken first, but followed exactly other than that.  It was a nice change from our regular chicken rotation!

My husband and I thought this was a great recipe.. We are already thinking of other ways of serving this dish. The only adjustment was the tarragon, 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons. Our side was green beans covered with the rest of the sauce.

Would have been much better without so much tarragon. I'm sure that if I cut the tarragon in half or even more, that it would have been excellent.

Wow! What a great recipe. The herbs really made this dish. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I used fresh herbs and it was delicious. I will certainly make this dish again. Thanks for sharing.

This was awesome, and the sauce topped it off.  I only used 1 T. of tarragon and 1 T. of thyme.  It tasted wonderful.

AMAZING recipe! Really quick, really easy, and DELICIOUS. Could even fix a nice salad while it was simmering since it's so simple to cook. The herb in the original recipe were fine for me, I just ended up a little on the short side with the sauce 'cause the wine reduces so quickly. A+

I've made probably 50 to  60 different recipes off this website and never had one I didn't like -- until last night. Flavors just didn't taste right together. I did cut the tarragon but it was still too strong. Not good at all.

I pounded the chicken first to make it more tender and reduced the tarragon to 1/2 tsp. I added more salt prior to serving. This was easy to prepare and tasted like something you'd order in a restaurant.  Very good.

As written it's a 4, with my changes it became a 5! I love the sauce on this chicken, it's incredible. Ok, my changes: Combine herbs with salt and rub into chicken breasts. Heat large saute pan on medium-high, sear chicken breasts 1 minute on both sides and reduce heat to medium.  Coat chicken with dijon mustard-honey sauce and add 1/4 cup white wine to pan.  Cover and follow cooking instructions from here.  Works with any variety of herbs, I omit tarragon as we don't care for the flavor.  Leftovers are great when chopped and served over a salad. Part of my regular rotation now!

I made three different chicken dishes the night before last and this was my favorite one out of the bunch. My family liked the other ones better. This was moist and very simple to prepare. I used ready made honey mustard instead of mixing up my own. Went great with Charles Shaw Chardonnay ($2 Buck Chuck from Trader Joe's).

Quite good, though I'm pretty sure that the recipe is supposed to have 2 teaspoons of tarragon, not 2 tablespoons.  Very tasty though.

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  I probably won't make again only because there are so many great chicken recipes and this one was pretty bland.  Definitely don't expect to taste the mustard.  The honey did add a nice sweetness but even with the quantity of tarragon the recipe called for, it had no flavor.  I served with couscous and used the "sauce" from the chicken as a topping for the couscous.  The sauce definitely had all the flavor! It was yummy.  I think this might be ok if you used the mustard mixture very liberally and then coated the chicken in bread crumbs, then fried it and left out the white wine.  That way the flavor would stay on the chicken and not all end up in the sauce.

An excellent, quick and easy recipe.  Obviously, it's not for those who don't like the licorice-y taste of tarragon.  Use fresh herbs if you have them. Divine.

4.25  Smelled very mustardy.  I was afraid it was going to taste that way too, but to my surprise it didn't.  I cut the tarragon to 1 tsp.  Seemed like a fancy meal without much effort.

This was really good.  I didn't have any tarragon so I just coarsely chopped some fennel seed and used that instead.  The flavor was very French, I thought.  It went really well with some wild rice pilaf I made and a green salad.

This combination didn't work as well as I'd hoped. It was too sweet and there was too much tarragon. And I like tarragon. With a little work this could be much better. How about a little heavy cream to mellow things out?

This was good, though I didn't have any white wine and did vegetable broth instead. I did only 1.5 tbsp of tarragon and cut the chicken into strips. It took a little longer to cook than stated, but was still fairly quick. I used grey poupon mustard with white wine, and I think that made a difference. We ate this with mashed potatoes. I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and then tossed the chicken strips in it. I'm sure I will make it again, since everyone (including my toddler) liked it.

This had too much tarragon for my taste. I only added 1 teaspoon of tarragon, but I did not enjoy the aroma and I am sure it is because of the tarragon. I will not be fixing this again.

This was ok. My husband loved it; I didn't. I think there were too many herbs. Since my husband liked it so much, I'll probably try it again with less tarragon.

We liked this a lot.  The result was a little dry, but otherwise very flavorful.  I only used one tablespoon of tarragon but will go for two next time. I also used a dealcholized chardoney for the wine. The recipe didn't call for it, but I turned the chicken so that is was brown on both sides and had enough heat under it to caramelize the sauce.  It was very nice.

We did not enjoy this recipe. There were too many herb flavors that competed with the unique honey-mustard flavor. I did add sliced white mushrooms after the first simmer, and they picked up a nice flavor from the wine. Despite the flavor being too overwhelming for us, it did make a very tender chicken! The method of cooking was very successful. I think if I looked to this recipe again I would, but leave out the tarragon and do honey-mustard only... OR, I'd leave out the honey-mustard and just use Italian seasonings.

This was good...not outstanding, but another way to serve chicken. My family seemed to enjoy it. Very easy to prepare. I served it with couscous and steamed zucchini and a tossed salad.

This was good but there was something missing.  I can't put my finger on it.  It needs something, perhaps a little sweeter.  Kind of just laid there.

My husband loved this one. I used apple juice instead of wine and skipped a step by using honey mustard but it all worked out. Quick & easy & tasty.

I did a little something different. I cut the wine back to half a cup and marinated the chicken before searing it on the grill. very tasty. you have to have a nice crusty outside for the flavors to coexist though. i paired this with herbed beets and onion slices, also grilled. if i would have had time, a salad would have finished this meal perfectly.

I would highly recommend using an iron skillet for this recipe. The skillet helps brown the chicken and leaves great bits for the end of cooking. I browned the chicken on both sides before brushing it with the mixture. I omitted the tarragon and used Italian seasoning. Do use wine (cooking sherry) because it makes the dish pop. Paired it with long grain wild rice. Family loved it!

I used a specialty mustard, reduced tarragon to 2 tsp and browned the chicken on both sides before brushing on the seasonings. It was delicious and we'll be enjoying again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love tarragon, but just didn't love this recipe.  Despite all the seasonings I couldn't appreciate the overall flavor.

I chose this recipe because I had never cooked with tarragon before and wanted to give it a try. I pounded the chicken slightly before cooking because they were large pieces, and used a tablespoon of unsalted butter in place of the 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. I also halved the thyme because all I had was ground. I had some misgivings about not browning the chicken, but it turned out very nice.
