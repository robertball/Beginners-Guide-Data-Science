I made this the other night and hubby absolutely LOVED it! We've recently changed our eating habits from less beef to more lean meats like Lamb and Bison. I was at a loss as to what to make with the ground Lamb. This was perfect and easy. I served it over a bed of brown rice and a broccoli side dish. Just a side note:  I used Almond Milk instead of cow's milk.

I chose to not make the red sauce and serve it over angel hair pasta which was tossed with butter and pecorino romano. Parmesan would I think also be lovely as it is milder. The flavor profile of the meatballs stood out, I think that adding a tomato sauce may steal their thunder.

I was so impressed by how good this turned out!! I had 1lb of ground lamb on hand and was just looking for a simple recipe to make without going back to the store. Some alterations: used a jar of pizza sauce (2cups) and some chopped grape tomatoes to sub for the tomato sauce; used dried mint and rosemary; and almond milk instead of cow milk. Still turned out delicious!

I made just the meatballs and added to a store bought sauce. They were so tasty! I was really surprised. I used oatmeal and panko crumbs because that's what I had.

The combination of spices for the meatballs here is unbelievably delicious (cumin, cinnamon etc.). I use it for all of my lamb recipes (lamb burgers, lamb stuffed peppers, etc). Great job Chef John!

AMAZING! Minutes into starting this recipe I realized my eggplant was rotten so I was forced to omit it, I thought my meatballs might not turn out the same as others but the recipe held up well and turned out DELICIOUS. The spice was perfect, and the lamb so tender. This was my 1st time making lamb and I am so happy I did!

This was delicious.  While I didn't have any mint on hand I did have everything else that the recipe called for and followed the directions as written.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again.

I really like this recipe but the mixture was too wet. I was still able to make the meatballs but a lot of the mixture was on my hands. When I make this again, I would either remove the milk or add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup more breadcrumbs. Overall the flavor is amazing. With these small changes, I think the meatballs would come out better next time.

Very flavorful! Not spicy hot. Made the lamb tasty even though no other meat was combined with it. I often find ground lamb strong and mix it with beef or pork. My kids liked it too.

Dang. This recipe is good. I’m almost always missing stuff when I make this but the flavors are so solid, there’s a ton of room for interpretation. The meatballs I keep pretty close to the recipe. To the sauce, I add an onion, green bell pepper, zucchini, black olives, and sometimes kale. My husband is crazy for this meal. I don’t even care that it takes and hour and a half to make. #worthit

Fabulous! Flavorful! Great change from "the usual" balls of meat. Easy recipe that can be easily augmented based on what you've got in the cupboard. Gourmet taste.

Loved this.  The salt was a bit much for me personally, but that's an easy thing to adjust.  When in doubt, rein in the salt a bit - it's always easy to add more later.

Most Excellent! (Grammarians cringe.) This was truly outstanding. Added crushed seeds from a half dozen cardamom  pods. Served on lemon-zested couscous and topped with Pecorino Romano just before serving. Cooked for 40 minutes in sauce pan and everything turned out great. Only negative was the splatter from the tomato sauce. Like a volcano spewing drops of tomato sauce on stove and even hitting the floor.  Suggest splatter screen.

Ah, a lamb dish! I made this per Chef John's recipe with the slight addition of my own baharat spice mixture. My baharat contains cinnamon, black pepper, cumin, allspice, cardamon and nutmeg. The meat balls were moist and flavorful alone but  the red pepper flaked tomato sauce, a whole new flavor layer was added. I generously garnished the dish with fresh chopped mint  and a dollop of yogurt. This dish followed a steamed artichoke with a curried dip for an appetizer. Thanks Chef John for another great dish.

I have never made lamb so this was all new experience.
It was amazing!!!! I used Mids Spaghetti sauce (Tomato Basil). I put the mint in the meatballs instead of the sauce and it was great.
Thanks Chef John.

I followed this recipe and only increased the cooking time in the oven so I didn't have to cook the meatballs for 45 minutes in the pan. The combination of spices are down right delicious! The meatballs held in all the flavoring (didn't drain while baking) so the result was very tender and full of flavor.  Another slight adjustment I made was I simmered my tomato sauce with a cinnamon stick and a few garlic cloves for extra warmth and spiciness. This is one of my favorite meatball recipes! A perfect fall & winter dish! Thank you, Chef John!

Pretty good lamb recipe for those who are afraid to try lamb (my wife). I didn't have mint but it was fine without it. I did add some salt and pepper  and some anchovy paste and marjoram and grated Parmesan cheese to the sauce as I thought it was just a bit bland. I'll make again.
