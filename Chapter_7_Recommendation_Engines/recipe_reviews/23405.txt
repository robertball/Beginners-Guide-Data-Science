This is a great recipe!  Mixing it up is quick, and you just walk away and let it rise.  There is NO NEED TO KNEED!  It's perfect!  My 11 year old and I put these in the oven and everyone said "Oooo" and "Ahhhh" as we tried them.  I even tried rolling the dough into balls and placed two side-by-side in a muffin pan... and they baked up well.  Enjoy!  Email this to a friend!  Thanks Monica!  Oh, and try cutting Pollish sausage into 3rds, and wrapping this dough around them, and making "pigs-in-a-blanket".  Yummm!!!

This recipe is really good, but needs some corrections. Step 2 should say to pour milk and SHORTENING into bowl, not milk and margarine. Also, there is no mention of when to add the sugar. I added 2 Tbsp with yeast and the remaining 1/2 cup with the flour.

These were a major hit Thanksgiving, my family wants them next year. They are so easy and I love that you can make them ahead and freeze. I do alot of cooking ahead when I'm expecting a crowd and these have been added to my tried and true stand-bys.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner for 15 people because it sounded so easy and "no fail".. Well, after step 1, the dough rised but did not double.  I was rushed for time so I continued on to step 3. The rolls did not rise at all. even after 4 hrs. in a warm oven.  My husband saved the day by quickly making biscuits from a mix.
I put the rolls in the refrigerator and tried again the next day.  I let them sit for a whole afternoon and part of the evening in a warm environment but to no avail.  They never raised!  I baked them anyway and ended up with what looked like cookies..
I was so dissapointed because of the waste of time and ingredients.

This recipe does not tell you when to add the sugar?  I am a novice at making bread so I tried this recipe.  About half way through I realized this recipe does not tell you when to add the sugar.  I decided to add it at a point that I thought would be ok, however I guess it wasn't the right time to add it.  Therefore the bread did not rise and I ended up throwing away the whole batch.  As I hate wasting food this made me pretty upset.  Whoever submitted this I would highly recommend rewriting the recipe with more clear instructions for beginners as the title of the recipe sort of makes it seem like this is a good recipe for beginners.

Despite letting dough rise over 2 1/2 hrs, it didn't double.  Couldn't believe it then said add more flour then cut and let it rise TWO MORE HOURS!  What a waste of time.

Like a few others said, I missed adding the sugar until it was too late (though if you look carefully, the recipe does say to add it to the dry ingredients). When it didn't rise, I balled them up like a drop biscuit and baked them as instructed, and they made an ok biscuit. It was pretty dense, but better than throwing it away. I did think it was rather sweet, and I probably would have been better off just not adding the sugar at all.

I thought these rolls were good - a little bland. I'm new to yeast breads, so I did appreciate the ease of the recipe - and it will be easy enough to flavor it up a little next time. Thanks!
