Very good, with a nice, crusty topping.  I used Panko bread crumbs and baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Lovely and moist!

I just tried it last night and my guest loved it. I made lots of substitutions to work with what I had, like using croutons instead of bread crumbs and lemon pepper seasoning instead of lemon zest... put butter on top and baked for 18 mins in the oven... delicious. I was nervous of how it would taste with so many substitutes but still so good!

This was fantastic! I made a few changes due to ingredients I already had on hand. Dried herbs, pre-minced garlic, Italian panko crumbs and since I don’t have a fancy shmancy oven I baked it at 375° for about 18 minutes and then broiled it on high for 2 minutes to brown the crust a little more. I also halved the crust recipe and it was PLENTY to cover a 2.04lbs salmon filet.

Loved it! Flavors are fab! I probably made about 2/3 of the topping and didn't use it all so I would probably halve this next time. Also, I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of fresh because I had them on hand. I used the auto cook fish 3 for one pound and it set the oven for 23 minutes. My fish was done in the 18 minutes as recommended though so be careful to watch this. I didn't make the asparagus because I had some broccoli to use up, but I made that in the oven instead of doing them on the same pan. Really, really good!

I love the way this recipe turned out. My family loved the crust on the salmon and the grill flavors. It looks elegant and doesn't take long to make. The asparagus had a perfect texture and are a delicious complement to this dish. Good thing I can cook both things at the same time in my Panasonic Induction Oven.
