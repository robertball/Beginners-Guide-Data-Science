I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a major hit.  The only things I did different were adding a dash of white pepper and a teaspoon of turkey broth.  I also did not bake them until I served them as leftovers the next day.  On the whole this is a great recipe and I will be making them again soon.

My husband made these for Easter dinner. They were great because he prepared them the day before and just popped them in the oven the next day to warm them up. Everyone enjoyed them, except my husband. He found that they had too much cream cheese. Next time we will scale back the cream cheese by half.

Great, I added season to taste, cheese on top and mixed in a little bacon bit, all my cooking life I've worked on perfecting those restraunt/home cooked mashed potatoes and I believe this recipe got me there. All I was missing was a little cream cheese

Making this for New Year's to go along with steaks on the grill. I'm adding cheese, crumbled bacon and chopped green onion and baking in oven. I've made this before and it is a perfect potato to take along to a party. Happy New Year

This is how I almost always make my mashed potatoes, tho' I of course don't measure - just add the ingredients to my liking and to get the right consistency. I've never added onion salt or garlic powder and I have to say I prefer the potatoes without these additions. Since I used these potatoes as the basis for "Twice Baked Mashed Potatoes," also from this site, I did not complete the freezing and baking step of this recipe.

These are indeed rich!  So creamy and delicious.  Instead of using garlic powder and onion salt, I boiled some fresh onion and garlic with the potatoes.  I added 1 tsp. kosher salt to the boiling water, then another 1 tsp. kosher salt to the mixture.  I didn't bake them in the oven, I just whipped them up like regular mashed potatoes.  An absolutely perfect compliment to the roast chicken I made!

Very tangy and of course, rich. I followed this recipe exact, only adding parsley, using onion powder and a half tsp. of salt. VERY GOOD. I plan on pairing these potatoes with my No-Peek Tender Tips. I can't wait. EDITED: I served this with Carnation(R) Swedish Meatballs and it was off the hook.

We liked the flavor of these mashed potatoes. I halved the recipe and added some bacon bits that needed to be used up to the mix and they turned out really well. The sour cream added a nice zippiness that we enjoyed. Thanks for posting. I will make these again:)

this was my first attempt at mashed potatoes from scratch. It was easier than I was expecting, though I halved the recipe because it was a smaller crowd. I found the end product to be a little bland (I did use onion powder instead of onion salt, as that's what I had on hand), so I'd probably add more garlic next time, and maybe a little more cream cheese, as the taste didn't come through at all.

These were delicious! Reminded me of my mother in law's garlic mashed potatoes that everyone loves, only better (shhh) ;) I stuck to the recipe, other than using onion power and garlic salt rather than onion salt and garlic power (just b/c that's what I had). Added a bit more salt, and mmmm! Hubby loved them. Didn't bake the 1st night, but plan to when I reheat. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Best mashed potatoes ever!
I used about 1/2 the container of sour cream and about 1/3 of a brick of cream cheese and no onion salt or garlic powder, just salt and pepper. My husband said they were fantastic!

4.5 stars as I feel heavy amount of crm cheese & S crm but is easily adjusted. Anyway...I used 2 med/large baking potatoes and scaled down other ingredients. After mashing with 2 tblsp butter, I added 2 oz of crm cheese (didn't want them too rich) and 1/4C S crm. I had previously roasted diced onion and garlic so used that but added a bit more granulated garlic. Used salt due to omitting onion salt. I did add a few splashes of buttermilk because mine were a bit 'stiff'. I placed in the oven (covered) to keep hot during last 1/2 hour my pot roast was in oven. Potatoes were very tasty even if I did things a little differently. Mashing potatoes first with butter does improve texture. FYI: I don't recommend using red potatoes or Yukons for mashed - their too dense or 'waxy' and end up like a pile of glue. Just a mention as recipe doesn't specify type of potato. :)

Very good, and I couldn't find the sour cream in the fridge, so I just used less than a cup of milk. I imagine it's even better with the sour cream (although I'd use Daisy light - less fat & calories and none of that yucchy gum stuff the others have).

Very rich and delicious mashed potatoes. I only used 6 potatoes, 1 tbls butter, 3 oz cream cheese, just eyeballed the sour cream and the seasonings. Made these for my niece and she loved them. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a good "base" recipe for creamy mashed potatoes. Once dressed up with more fixins ie more seasoning, bacon, etc, it becomes a tasty treat.
