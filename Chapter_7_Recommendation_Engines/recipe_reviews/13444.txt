Nice recipe - one of my favoriate dishes - readers should note that Posole is really hominy...or a version of hominy if you want to get technical.  If you can't get blue corn posole or hominy, feel free to substitute White or yellow corn hominy (NOT hominy grits though).

I didn't use the squash or Eggplant, instead I added strips of cabbage at the very end for texture and I added a fair amount of cumin and a squeeze of lime juice - which is more in the mexican style.  If I can find blue corn posole, I'll try it with the squash - I bet the colours would be as ravishing as this beautiful dish.

I use pork shoulder in this, and put it in at the beginning before the Posole, after a couple of hours you should have a nice broth and the pork will shred easily with a fork.  The add the Pozole and continue to cook. Some places in Mexico sear the meat first and then add all the ingredients to make a kind of braising sauce - in that case just simmer the whole thing and use stock insetad of water.
