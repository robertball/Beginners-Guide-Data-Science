There's a little problem with this recipe - too much moisture! I omitted the milk altogether and used 2 cups of fresh cherries that I tossed with a couple of Tbsp. of sugar which produced their own juice. I creamed 1/2 cup of butter with 3/4 cup of white sugar and then added the eggs one at a time. I only used 1 & 3/4 cup of flour and instead of 2 tsp. of baking powder I used 1 tsp. and added a tsp. of baking soda. I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of almond extract. I left out the nuts as well. I poured the batter into six Texas sized muffins tins lined with paper topped them with a generous amount of turbinado sugar and baked them at 400 for about 25 minutes. With those changes it's now a 4 star recipe!

These are so good! I used fresh Bing cherries. I think the wetness of canned cherries may have caused the problems some of the reviewers were talking about. The fresh ones were so good in this. I used half applesauce for the butter half whole-wheat pastry flour and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I also used walnuts. These are so good and my husband and I cannot stop snacking on them! Thanks for the recipe! I only wish I had thought to add some vanilla or almond extract I think it would make them even better!

These muffins really don't bake well at all.  Maybe using less sugar would help.  Once you get past the ugly apprearance, they taste pretty good.  But I've definately made better and I won't be making these again.

these muffins don't cook very well. I was disappointed with the final version. I made them twice to make sure it wasn't me!

Great taste! They didn't rise up like regular muffins. I used 1/2 c. wht. sugar 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. honey white whole wheat instead of ap flour fresh dark sweet cherries and added 1 tsp vanilla. I had a yield of 24 mini muffins 12 regular muffins and two custard cups of little sweet breads.

I made this recipe as a bread (like banana nut bread). I used bing cherries reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. It made a very dense loaf. But it was delicious. I will be making it again very soon.

Very dense somewhat sticky and overall a really heavy muffin. Edible enough to finish the batch but not something i would ever make again.

Because I changed this recipe I gave it four stars to be fair to the person who wrote this. I substituted the dried cherries I had instead of using canned. I could definitely see why these didn't bake well for others: my batter was pretty moist but because I used dry cherries they turned out pretty well. Canned cherries would have been way too wet. Overall pretty good. Thanks!

This recipe was my first t ime making muffins from scratch. I used dried tart cherries instead of the canned - I think this helped with the problem other had with them not cooking well. They cooked up fine and were quite good. My only recommendation would be to cut back on the sugar a bit - they are a little too sweet. Otherwise it was a nice and easy recipe.

I had some trouble getting the muffins out of the baking dish but they are very moist and taste great and had disappeared almost instanteneously.

I loved these muffins after a few changes. First I only made a half recipe. For that I used 1 can of tart cherrries. I drained them first then left them to drain more while I prepared the recipe. I used half whole wheat and half oat flour in the second batch and they were better than with the all purpose!! Make sure you use a mixer to cream the sugar and butter then add eggs. This gives a nice texture. Add the dry ingredients mix till half incorporated then add in the cherries. Mix just till incorporated. DON"T ADD THE MILK!! It will make your batter too thin. Then add a teaspoon of almond extract. These were so good I had to make a second batch the next day. I WILL be using this recipe again as changed!!

While the batter is out of this world YUMMY the finished product resembled a nuclear waste accident in a muffin wrapper. I didn't read the other reviews until after my batch came out of the oven but obviously I wasn't the only one who had "dish"-appointment upon pulling the muffin pans out of the oven. If I end up bringing these to the gathering for which I baked them they're being brought in a brown paper bag without a name. (And I'll probably point and laugh at them along with my friends.)

I've made this recipe three times now. The first two times I made them I used a mixer and they were the ugliest muffins I've ever seen (but they still tasted delicious). This last time I mixed everything by hand and they turned out much much better. The texture is lighter fluffier they rise higher in the oven... I still think they are a little on the sweet side so next time I will cut back a bit on the sugar.

I made bars instead of muffins and used both fresh sour pie cherries and home canned cherries off the same tree drained well. My family loved them. The texture was actually better when I hand mixed the ingredients just until blended than when I used a mixer to cream the butter and sugar.

Flavor is excellent, but the rise and appearance leave much to be desired.  Followed the recipe exactly, stuck even to a well greased muffin pan.  Will have to decide if the taste is enough to overcome the appearance. It might....(I say as eating my second..)

What a great recipe! I was looking for recipes that I could use fresh rainer cherries since our tree went crazy this year. My recipe made 12 medium muffins rather than the 24 indicated on the recipe and they were average size. Couple of changes I made was to chop the cherries in the food processor use less milk as someone suggested and add a little cinnamon to the batter. Didn't add the nuts since I was out. Topped with cinnamon/sugar mix (another good suggestion from the reviews.) Mine took 25 minutes to bake. We loved the muffins enough so that we made several batches (since I had a ton of cherries) and froze them for future use.

Great taste and a good way to use up home canned Cherries. I followed recipe exactly until I got to the milk. I followed some of the advise. I mixed everything up to see just how much milk I needed. Turned out to have used about 1/2 cup of milk. My cherries were home canned Royal Anne. Where I got in trouble was I didn't have any muffing tins so I baked it in a 5"x9" pan. After 20 min. (Very wet) another 10 min. etc. etc. I think I ended up baking about 45-50 minutes. Is definitely a keeper but next time I may add some cinnamon or vanilla flavoring. Although it is really good as is.

So good! I modified it a bit though. I made my own oat flour and added in chia seeds and flax seeds. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and also used less...about a cup instead of two. Also 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup frozen cherries. Baked it for 45 min. Still moist but not too much just delish!
