Great salad dressing and using fresh ingredients makes it all the better! I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I opted to use a white balsamic which proved to be a good choice. I just put everything into my mini food processor, gave it a whirl and it was done in no time at all. I let it set in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors blend together. This was a wonderful dressing for "Strawberry Spinach Salad with Feta and Bacon" from this site.

I decided to try this today for a salad for lunch. Being as I did not need that much, I made 1/4 of the recipe rather easily. I had frozen raspberries and they worked fine. I just blended all of the ingredients together in my Vitamix on medium speed about 25-30 seconds. I don't care for the raspberry seeds and they would get more processed that way. When I first tasted it, I thought it tasted way too acidic. I added a squeeze of agave syrup and it cut through that. Only other issue is the color. It has the color appearance of human blood, giving it that halloweenish appearance. So, basically, I would consider using a white plain or flavored vinegar, instead of the dark colored balsamic, if serving this to guests. For myself though, it was fine.

We give this a 5 star rating, even though after one salad I strained out the seeds.  I made half the recipe (you never know if you'll like it or not), and I made it as stated with the exception of the vinegar---I used half regular balsamic and half one that I found at HomeGoods recently--a white raspberry balsamic.  Initially I was afraid it would be too sweet with the sugar and the honey, but after it sat in the fridge for several hours, it mellowed out quite well for our tastes.  I will make this again for sure.  We really liked it!  I see other recipes now that would be wonderful using this recipe.  Thanks very much!

Far too vinegar-y, even for a vinaigrette! Added more raspberries to balance it, which worked, but I will definitely decrease the vinegar the next time I make this.

This is a fabulous recipe and most of the time I make it as written with one or two exceptions.  Instead of just balsamic vinegar, I use a good raspberry balsamic.  Gives it added raspberry flavor.  And when I do this, I omit the honey, as you don't need the added sweetness when using a high end balsamic.  I have also used almond oil instead of olive oil, or a combination of the two.  I have even, on occasion, added a tablespoon or two of toasted sesame oil.  Gives it a nice toasty flavor. Thank you mommy2two, for a great recipe as is or to start from for little tweaks.

There is far too much vinegar.  I spent quite a bit of time adding more ingredients in order to make this dressing edible for me.  I added more sugar, more olive oil, some brown sugar, and raspberry preserves.

I did not care for this.  I kept thinking I did something wrong, measurements, something.  Nope.  Everyone I made taste it thought it was awful.  Other recipes call for 2-3 TABLESPOONS of balsamic.  2/3 cup was WAY too much.

We threw all the ingredients in the blender, turned out very creamy. and it kept well in the fridge. My husband liked it so much he has requested I make it again.

I found this to have too much of a vinegar flavor.  I reduced the vinegar by half, added more honey and some dijon mustard and ended up with a delicious dressing.

Love it.  I would add a few more berries, and maybe even experiment with other berries. I hate letting them go to waste. I used more honey and less white sugar.  I like the extra tang.

Perfectly balanced. Great fresh vinaigrette recipe. Easier to blend in blender - smoother texture. Add all ingredients except oil; puree and add oil in steady stream with blender running. Season with extra salt and pepper. This is a go to recipe to keep in your fridge!

This is excellent! I have also made it using a very tart raspberry jam. I didn't use the sugar and cut the amount of honey I  used, with excellent results. This dressing goes well with candied nuts and dried fruit such as cranberries or golden raisins in a lettuce salad.

Excellent and easy to make.    Have made it multiple times, and usually add a second berry (suggest blackberry and/or blueberry).   Kids enjoy the dressing too..... except the boy, but at 10 years old, fruit and veggies are the "enemy".   :)

Like others the first time I made this, it was really heavy on the vinegar, which I usually like in salad dressing, but its just a tad to much. Changes I made the next time, I used a tablespoon of agave nectar instead of sugar and I went with a 1/2 cup of balsamic, a pinch of onion and garlic powder as well as 4-5 grinds of black pepper and a dollop of dijon mustard.  Awesome.

Delicious! I substituted the balsamic vinegar with rice wine vinegar. it added a lighter tang. Did a taste test against Marie Callendar's. Beat it hands down! This recipe was very savory and not too sweet. Perfect!

I made it (August 16/2017) and am quite impressed with the outcome. I added an extra 1/4 of olive oil and used brown sugar instead of white. I put the raspberries, brown sugar and salt in a pot and boiled the mixture for 20 minutes on low heat. I then combined this with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. It turned out perfect. I have a question: How long will It last in the refrigerator? Thanks !!!! 5 stars

I used boysenberries and replaced sugar with monk fruit.  Blended in a blender, strained seeds and I think it's the best I've ever had. Will make again. The Kirkland aged balsamic vinegar of modena is perfect from Costco.

Company was about to walk in the door and I still hadn't made the Fresh Raspberry Vinaigrette yet - other than letting the raspberries sit with sugar on them for a long time.  I rushed to make it, and as I poured in the first 1/3 C balsamic vinegar it hit me adding a second 1/3 C would be too much, so didn't.    Good thing - for me just the 1/3 C was too much.  I added another T of honey and poured in some more olive oil.  Now the dressing was ready.

The chef who came for brunch gave the viniagrette a thumbs up.  Yay!  I will make this again

Absolutely love it. Great on a mixed greens salad. Sweet enough to balance the vinegar but not so sweet it melts your teeth out of your head. Makes a healthy amount too.

My husband and I had this dressing on our spinach salads for lunch today. Excellent! I was looking for a Raspberry Vinaigrette made with raspberries instead of raspberry vinegar. I had frozen raspberries and balsamic vinegar on hand along with these other salad ingredients: dried cranberries, sweet onion, toasted sliced almonds and Feta. However I'm sure  it would be good with countless combinations.  I'm looking forward to trying each one.

Perfect color taste and texture. I served it over a salad of arugula, cold shrimp, boiled eggs and avocado.

This is delicious and simple.  I took another rater's advice and cut down on the vinegar by 1/3.  I will be using this to dress a peach salad later.  Can't wait!

I really liked this recipe. I did change the amount of fruit to about half and omitted the sugar as well as using champagne vinegar for half the total vinegar. It thought it was delish!

I made it pretty much as stated but used Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar  and stevia instead of sugar and I added 1/4 tsp poppy seeds and 1/2 tsp onion powder, I also used fresh raspberries and just blended it in my bullet.   Absolutely loved it and will definitely be making this again, so much better than store boughten.

As others have mentioned it is way too vinegary tasting. I only added 4 ounces of balsamic which is less than recipe calls for and it was still way to much. I tasted it after I mixed everything and it burned as I swallowed it. Balsamic overpowers the recipe and even covers the raspberry flavor. I had to add more honey to try to salvage it.

I am new to cooking and was looking for something easy and exciting for a salad I made for Christmas lunch yesterday. This looked really good and I found frozen raspberries in my local supermarket. (I'm from Malaysia!) I read through some of the comments, and followed HeatherLily's changes - thanks! I loved it, and though it was really different for my family, I think they liked it - well, the salad disappeared!

This is a keeper!  Since my family has a sweet tooth, I added about a tablespoon of seedless raspberry jam.  I blended all the ingredients in a Ninja-style blender.  The ingredients stayed combined quite well.  It was a hit!  Served it with a spinach, apple, goat cheese, green onion and candied walnut salad.  Yum, yum!

Excellent flavor.  I'd prob reduce the vinegar some and add more oil but it was very flavorful.  I also added a tablespoon of mirin.

Raspberry vinaigrette is my favorite dressing. I decided to make my own instead of purchasing. I am glad I did. This recipe is so good. I usedc1/2 cup balsamic as other reviewers said and added a bit more honey. This tasted great. I will need more soon. I will be buying more greens more often. Yummy

As with some of the other reviewers, I also thought this was acidic with too much Balsamic Vinegar.   I am a fan of Balsamic and really wanted to like this one. I did not try to remedy this by adding other ingredients. 
Perhaps you could start with 1/2 of vinegar and progress to full amount if you prefer.
I will browse other recipes.

I think this came out great, and was a fantastic way to use up the hundreds of berries growing on our bushes.  I  put it all in the food processor, and used only 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar based on other reviews.  It still came out nice and thick.  Some may want to strain out the seeds after but they didn't bother me.  I think I will make a second batch and gift it to a friend.  Thanks!

06-12-16 ~ I had a lot of fresh organic raspberries to use up. This recipe was a delicious place to use some of them. I put all the ingredients in my MagicBullet and whirled away. It was delicious on a fruited / vegetable salad that I took to our Pastor's going away luncheon. I would definitely make this recipe again. UPDATE:  This review does not belong with this dressing.  It goes with:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/238997/raspberry-vinaigrette-salad-dressing/?internalSource=search%20result&referringContentType=search%20results&clickId=cardslot%202

I bought Cherry Blossom honey at the farmers' market the other day so I thought I'd give that a try instead of regular honey. It went perfectly with this recipe. I pulsed all the ingredients a couple of times in the NutriBullet because I like my salad dressings to be smooth. It was fantastic!

This is a great way to use my fresh raspberries.  After reading other reviews, I started with equal amounts oil and balsamic vinegar.  I couldn't taste the balsamic, and ended up using about 1/2 cup balsamic.  I used my blender to process it, which gave it a creamy texture.  I will be making this again, but will try it with the full 2/3 cup balsamic vinegar.

I made this vinaigrette this past weekend to use on a spinach and strawberry salad. Very tasty and easy to make. Everyone enjoyed it. Will make again.

Yummy! I used strawberries instead of raspberries and mixed all in the blender.

I found this recipe easy to make. I used frozen rasberries and you would never no it. The dressing is well balanced.  It is my new favorite dressing. It was so good I could put a straw in it and drink it up.

Only needed half the recipe so I split it in half. But I only put in ONE tablespoon of balsamic vinegar in the dressing not 1/3 cup. Also put the full tbsp of honey instead of dividing it.

I will make it again, but will cut down on the vinegar. Note : as I didn't have balsamic vinegar on hand I substituted cider vinegar and this may have affected how it tasted. I have made it with both fresh and frozen raspberries, both were good.

Absolute smashing dressing. Love the contrast of the vinegar and honey with freshness of the raspberries

I increased from 16 to 24 servings and substituted white balsamic and maple syrup (out of honey).  Followed prep instructions.  Everyone loved it!  Will be making it again.
I will make with original ingredients at some point to compare, however this was a winner!

I only used 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, and mashed the raspberries with a cocktail muddler. It was delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was wonderful, and a great way to use fresh raspberries.  I made half a batch and I think I always will - it made plenty.

I used some champagne orange Muscat vinegar (Trader Joe's) and left out the honey and it was great!

this recipe is easy to make and tasty.  The only thing I changed was not adding sugar to the berries and changed the serving size. My sister really enjoyed it when she was here at Easter as its made with fresh ingredients and contains no preservatives or soy.
