I made this tonight using chicken that was slow cooked in stock, beer and water with salt, pepper, paprika, oregano and garlic. The juices from that I used for 2 of the 3 cans of chicken stock. Canned yams, frozen spinach, roasted garlic, salt, pepper and smokey turmeric. This is a fantastic, simple, base recipe. It is also delicious! A big hit in this household.

This soup is delicious! I added some things, but I still think it deserves 5 stars cause itâ€™s an awesome base recipe. I added some herbs, half an onion onion, kidney beans and quinoa, but honestly just the spinach and sweet potato make this soup. So so tasty and will make again!

This has become an every other week dish for us. I make it as is for the first day. Then I add extra nine broth and quinoa and have it as soup the rest of the week!

It was simple and tasty.  But, it was extremely soothing.  I don't know which I liked best the taste or the relaxing effect it had on me.  Definitely a keeper.
I added an onion.

I've made this a few times now, and I like how simple and fast it is.  Healthy, too.  I generally double it, and use shredded cooked chicken or leftover chicken picked from a rotisserie chicken.  Today, I used a garlic herb seasoning mix instead of plain garlic, to give it a bit more flavor, and I typically use a bit less broth because I prefer soups that aren't so liquidy.

I added onions while boiling the sweet potatoes and subbed Montreal Seasoning for salt and pepper. Incredible

I used frozen spinach but the rest of the recipe as detailed.  It was a hit with a fussy eater (my hubby) and my mother-in-law.

My neighbor made this for me after my double mastectomy and it was the perfect soup for after surgery. Tasty, easy on the stomach, good blend of protein and veg. I ate it for a week straight and didn't tire of it. Great with rosemary bread.

A simple and yummy soup.! I kept the ingredients the same. I used my savory homemade chicken broth and it turned out wonderful. This recipe is a keeper!
