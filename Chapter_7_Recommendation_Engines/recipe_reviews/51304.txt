This is a great sausage gravy with any type of sausage. Maple tastes great & I normally wouldn't have chosen it, but have used it several times for this gravy. I end up having to use a little extra flour because I make this with 1% milk, which is what I normally buy. OH - ONE OTHER THING: The most popular review states that he whisks the milk & flour together & adds it to the sausage directly. The reason the recipe is written the way it is - is because you need to cook the flour in the drippings & butter to get rid of the "floury" taste. All successful white sauces are made this way. Following the original recipe as written makes the best tasting gravy!

hands down 5 stars. i cook this at the firehouse every sunday morning when i am working. this is our absolute favorite! don't even attempt to use anything other than maple sausage. it just doesn't taste the same. we skip removing the sausage to leave the drippings. we wisk the flour and milk together in a bowl and then just dump it in to the pan with the sausage. tastes the same and is quicker. THE GUYS ARE KNOWN TO COME IN OFF SHIFT JUST TO EAT!

As far as directions this is one of the better sausage gravy recipes I have seen.  I prefer to use sage sausage in mine.  I find the maple sausage has too strong a flavor that clashes and doesn't taste right.  I also do not add the butter.  I find I get more than enough fat from the sausage.

We love this recipe!  However I did tweek it a little bit so that I could get the taste closer to that of which they serve at the Montage in Portland, OR.  I add about 4 Tablespoons of maple syrup after it thickens and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper OR replace maple sausage with chorizo sausage to make it spicy....but you can add either to your liking, I just found that it makes the flavor burst!  Also, I serve mine over buttermilk biscuits...the only way to eat them!  Thanks Bill!

I tried this with maple sausage and thought it was great. Then on a whim I tried it with a batch of the Breakfast Sausage recipe on this site.  It was divine with the Breakfast Sausage!  Makes even ho-hum biscuits taste great!

Pretty good. I added a few diced hard boiled eggs to the sausage gravy to stretch it out a bit. Really went fast. EDITED REVIEW: I make this a lot now, but I'll usually use canned milk to make a creamier gravy and I'll either add red pepper flake or Frank's Hot Sauce to give it a little kick.

This was fantastic! I doubled the recipe since I was making it for a breakfast potluck at work. I added some onion powder to the sausage, along with pepper and salt. I wasn't planning on adding butter, but the sausage didn't render much fat, so I added about 5 tbsp. for the double batch. Everyone at work loved it (it was the favorite dish). Plenty of black pepper is a must, I think, but I like pepper. Thanks, Bill!

Fantastic! I will never buy the dry-packaged gravy mix again. I love the fact that I can make sausage gravy with no MSG. The only difference I made was to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit since we like it hot in my house. Thanks for sharing your recipe Bill!!

I used 2% milk because that's all I had, and it worked just fine.  The consistancy was perfect.  I never had much luck with gravy in the past but this was a success!

This is a fine, kick-butt recipe, but for me NOT with maple sausage.  This must be a regional thing.  I was introduced to B&G in the southwest- I must've tried 10 different versions while going through Texas, alone.  But none of them used maple sausage and most of them were heavily peppered.  So I just use a sage or other standard breakfast sausage (but not hot sausage) and am heavy-handed with the black pepper.  The fresh-made country breakfast sausage available at Sprouts was quite good in this- they also have a maple sausage if you must have it, but please try it with a regular sausage before you tell me I'm all wet.  Enjoy it with strong black coffee for that true truck-stop feeling.  

Thanks kindly for reading...

One of my favorite things to eat. Been making cream/milk gravy since my mother in law taught me how in 1974. Season with salt and pepper. The only thing I added salt to when I was pregnant.  This is the same recipe basically I've used since then. Tweek it however suits you. The meat doesn't matter, the extras don't matter, it's what appeals to you. Use on biscuits, toast, plain bread or right on the meat. I've made it with sausage patties, ground sausage, bacon, pork chops, hamburger, kielbasa, country fried steak and after frying chicken.  YUM!!!! My son in law adds tabasco at the table. I've gone from whole milk to 2% to 1% and it's a winner with any of them.  I only take the meat out if it's not ground, then cover with the flour and brown a bit. It's really not necessary to brown it for very long. The important advise I'll give is to not walk away from it after you put the milk. It will probably stick if you don't. But I don't simmer it, also don't use high heat,  so I stir as it cooks. Best to keep it moving. But it won't take long. It might also get a little thicker after it's done. But it generally doesn't sit around too long. Only thing I don't do is add butter. If I need a bit more drippings I add a little shortening or oil if I have to stretch the drippings a bit and keep the meat flavor.  Don't need to do this often but it's not a heart friendly thing to begin with. Otherwise it would be on the table everyday. *L*

I made this this for dinner for a change & it was great!  I used regular flavored sausage and everyone in my family loved it.  My mom asked me for this recipe right away.

I'm from the south and been making gravy for 60 years plus.  Only change I would make to this recipe is:  I don't use butter, drippings only, and I use canned evaporated milk diluted with a can full of water. It makes your gravy taste so rich compared to regular milk.  Can also make gravy using bacon drippings instead of sausage.

Yep...I'm definitely feeling a "southern thing" with this recipe.  I absolutely love sausage gravy.  I'm originally from the South, so when I go back to visit my family, this is always on our menu.  This is best served over hot biscuits.  Definitely comfort food at it's finest!  Thanks Bill.

This is a wonderful recipe! Make as written first! My tips are as follows:
1) I use 1 lb regular breakfast sausage (Jimmy Deans is always good or in bulk from our local butcher)
2) We don't buy whole milk, so I use 2 cups nonfat milk and then the last cup I mix 1/2 c. nonfat with 1/2 c. half and half. But I must say all nonfat turns out just fine.
3) 2 T of butter with the drippings is plent of fat. The extra just makes it that much richer, but I don't miss that.
4) I strongly encourge you to add the flour to the fat as written in the recipe! This is a classic roux and this ensures the gravy doesn't taste "flour-y" or "pasty" -- mixing with the milk is a risk. Let the flour and drippings cook together, whisking constantly, about 1-2 minutes. This gives FLAVOR!
5) The milk/fat/flour ratio is perfect. I heat the milk in the microwave for about 1 minute so it's not too cold. Whisk in slowly. Once in, let come to a nice bubble and boil gently, stirring often. This thickens the gravy. Once you add the sausage and continue to cook, the thickening process continues. Thin with extra milk if too thick. As it cools, it will thicken more, so just add milk if needed.

Enjoy!!

This is a great basic sausage gravy recipe.  One tip and time saver I learned from my dad.  Don't bother to remove the sausage from the skillet.  Just add the flour to it & the drippings.  Cook for a few minutes till the flour browns and then add the milk.  It will thicken just fine and saves time & cleanup!

Who cares about the nutritional content with you're eating biscuits and gravy! This meal is one I couldn't eat every week, but, when I'm in the mood for it, this is the best!! Everything in moderation!!

Because of Bill, I will never again order biscuits and gravy in a restaurant! I have always loved B&G, but had never tried making it myself. This is so easy and just WOW. And it is absolutely because of the maple sausage. In my store, you can find regular pork sausage for much cheaper than the name brand maple sausage......so when I make this with regular sausage, I just add about 2 tbsps of maple syrup to the gravy after it is thickened. Although it isn't the same, it's close. Like a few others, I also make this with skim milk (because that's all we drink) and I omit the butter (you'd probably need the butter if you were using a leaner sausage, like turkey or chicken) - still turns out awesome and less fattening, too. Thank you, Bill! :)

Gravy was bland.  Needs more spice other than salt and pepper.  Maybe some sort of herbs.  Best thing about it was the maple aroma.

My family is Appalachian and I was raised on a farm eating biscuits and gravy, eggs and fried apples.  I tried this recipe because...well I'd never seen anyone "measure" a gravy recipe.  We are a dump and pour until it tastes right family.  My granny knew what she was talking about when she told me if you want the best tasting sausage gravy use bacon grease as the base and I have to agree.  I gave this a shot but it is much better if you reserve bacon grease to brown your flour in then add the drained sausage pieces to the gravy.  Also, for more punch try white pepper...everyone seems to forget about that little gem.

This is one of our family's favorites.  I've used maple sausage, and we all like it, but really prefer the plain stuff.  I usually don't have to add butter, and I sprinkle the flour right over the cooked sausage and stir it all together.  It's simpler than taking the sausage out of the pan, still gets the flour cooked, and works well.  This gravy is thick and flavorful, and our kids even ask for it for birthday breakfasts!

YAHOO!!!! I made sausage gravy that didn't taste like pasty flour!!!!! I've tried for years to learn how to make this, even though I know it's supposed to be simple. Even my husband thought I had bought it somewhere, and was shocked to hear I made it myself. Terrific recipe!!!!

Don't skimp on this recipe! All we had in the house was 1% milk, and turkey sausage. If you are already using 3T of butter don't hold back. it is still good as a lower fat version, but turkey is no sub. for good pork sausage! I also followed someone else's tip of adding some syrup directly to the gravy. YUM! I also like the idea of making the flour into a light rouge first. My mom always used a shaker and mixed the flour and milk before cooking which gives you a whiter gravy. But I do not have a shaker, so there was always a clump or two of flour in mine. The rouge adds nice flavor, and breaks down the flour for  a smoother gravy. Yum, going in my recipe box for sure! Thanks.

This is a great standard recipe~although I was taught by my grandmother to use evaporated milk and water to thin if needed.   This gravy (with a dash of cayenne) is excellent over  country fried chicken and potatoes (don't forget the biscuits!)~not just for breakfast!

I'm not big on the maple sausage, but any flavor sausage will work well. Tip: After browning sausage, sprinkle flour directly over sausage and mix until the flour is no longer visible. Then add milk. No need to add butter. This makes it quick, easy,  and less fat with same flavor and texture.

Delicious.  I don't always use maple sausage but it is good either way.

My family loved this gravy.  I used one can canned milk and one can water in place of the whole milk because that is how my grandmother made sausage gravy.

I followed this recipe to the T and felt like it was lacking more flavor. It's a perfect recipe to make ahead of time and take camping. I will try it again adding more spices for flavor.

This is a great recipe. I use Isernois premium breakfast chicken sausage (you can purchase at Walmart and Winco). There is only 13 grams of fat in the whole lb. of sausage (2.5 g per serving). So very good.

This is fantastic!  I have made this MANY times it is my 3.5 yr olds favorite dish and she is very picky.  I have made it with every type of sausage.  I find that if I am using a link type sausage there is often very little grease after cooking so I will add the full amount of butter the recipe calls for.  However, when I use ground sausage there is so much grease I omit the butter altogether.  Great recipe Bill!

I've been making this since I was knee high! I add a finally minced onion to the meat as it browns. Sprinkle the flour directly on the meat and I have graduated to either 2% evaporated milk or fat free half and half. Yum

Amazingly good. I have no complaints with this one whatsoever. This recipe is very easy and makes a lot. I did use a pound of regular sausage instead of maple links but this will turn out great regardless of what you choose. I served over Pillsbury Grands biscuits and it was very filling. I will be making this often.

If you don't save your bacon drippings you should.  This recipe would be MUCH better if you substitute bacon drippings for the butter.  If you don't you will be left with a very bland gravy.

Absolutely fantastic!  I did not use the maple.  I used lots of pepper though!  My husband loved it too.  I haven't made sausage gravy in years and this is the recipes that I will likely use from now on!

Absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure about using maple sausage but we loved it! I used 1% milk and made JP's Big Daddy biscuits off this site. I also doubled the recipe so we'd have enough to smother our biscuits. Yum!

I have made this several times....I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before.  This is my favorite sausage gravy!  I love the slightly sweet flavor the maple sausage gives it.  I made it exactly as stated and I wouldn't change a thing....Thank you so much Bill!

This gravy was very tasty, but I had a little problem with the part about the butter and flour. It got all stuck together and not creamy until I added the milk. I think my sausage did not give off enough drippings, too. I think it would taste better with regular flavored sausage, as the maple-flavored was too sweet. All in all, though, it was very good and would probably be easier to make with a little practice!

As the Cajun Chef would say, "You start with a simple roux..."  You cannot make this recipe without stirring the flour directly into the bubbling butter.  Adding the flour to the milk, as some here have suggested, will result in a flour-flavored, milk-colored gravy.

Just a tip for anyone making this gravy or any milk gravy. My Grandma told us its thick enough and done. When the bubbles are as big as "Hogs Eyes".

Fixed this the first time for Thanksgiving brunch, everyone raved about it. Made it several times since, now I cook the sausage and make the roux ahead so I can reheat the roux, add the milk and cook until thickened, then add the sausage and let simmer until meat is hot. By the time it's done the biscuits are ready to come out of the oven. J.P.'s Big Daddy biscuits and gravy, YUM! Not very healthy but a great special treat.

I've made this several times and it always turns out great. I use a 1lb package of sausage, so I increase the other ingredients a little to compensate. This is also really good on whatever type of fried potatoes you like.

This gravy really did remind me of the gravy I grew up with in East Tennessee. The only adjustments I made were: I used 2.5 cups 2% milk and .5 cup half & half (that's all we had), and I didn't use the "simmer" part at all.

I won a gravy contest with this one and the 1 most outstanding comment was that they could taste the maple and loved it. Thanks!

This was great. I used Cheese Worse which is our South African sausage. The cheese one is more salty and WOW it was so good. My boyfriend got a stomach ache from eating so much. Made it with Fluffy Biscuits from this sight... Finger licken good and a bit of home in South Africa. :)

This is an excellent recipe! I prefer breakfast sausage instead. It can also be made in large quantities relatively easy. The guys at the gun club said it's the best B&G they've had so I'll be bringing it in for the 4th time this coming weekend. Thanks for the recipe Bill. As the guys say, your recipe has become legendary!! :-)

I tend to love spicy things so I was initially thinking of using spicy sausage. The store did not have spicy sausage so I opted for maple sausage. I am NOT disappointed. YUMMY!!!! I made biscuits and gravy for Easter. I haven't served it yet but I expect for it to be a hit. Thanks Bill for the wonderful recipe.

My husband (who is the only consumer of breakfast gravy in the house) said it was pretty good, needed a little more flavor in the actual gravy. The sausage I used didn't produce a lot of grease and I unexpectedly ran out of pepper. I let it sit for a couple days in the fridge, added a little more milk and he said it was much better. Will likely make again!

never ate this before, but my mom rants and raves about it espically when she returns from vacations down South so I decided to try and make it... First time after following the recipe the gravy came out a little thick, but she said it was good.  Next time I added a 1/2 c. of milk and she said it was PERFECT!  thanks for the recipe

Very good, very easy.  Didn't require any 'tweaking'!
I found that it made more than 4 servings, but that was okay with me.  I've made it twice - once with mild sausage and once with maple sausage.  My husband and I felt that the maple sausage version was the best.

It was excellent, the best sausage gravy I ever had. Better than restaurant. I used Safeway brand buttermilk biscuits, this has become a household favorite.

I have never made good gravy - finally I did with this recipe.  I also didn't use the maple sausage - I prefer Jimmy Deans Sage Sausage.  I added more milk to make it more soupy and cooked it longer to thicken it up.  I like lots of the gravy and a little less of the sausage.  My husband and stepson really like it alot.  This is now my one and only sausage gravy recipe.  Thanks!

This was GREAT. My husband raved about this to everyone he saw. My husband loves biscuits and gravy, and every attempt we have ever made was too floury. I added a dash of onion powder and garlic powder and used mild sausage. I even liked it, and I really don't care for biscuits and gravy.

My mother is from Kentucky. Her mom, as well as my mom..and now me....have the secret to perfect gravy and the bland flavor this recipe and others may produce. Just add a little of your strong black coffee, one tbs. or a little more, at the end and stir in till well blended. It gives it a rich intense smokey (non coffee) taste and makes the gravy color a medium golden brown. It's an old pioneer trick farmer wives used when nothing was available to enhance their morning routine breakfast gravies. Enjoy! The instant aroma is even worth more. I also never remove the sausage (sage,regular) from the pan after it is browned. Also for truly velvet texture, my family only uses canned evaporated pet milk. Try serving this over lightly (sea)salted thick sliced (room temp) garden fresh tomatoes. Whewwww!!!  Kentucky Heaven! :))

This was ok but I think that the Super Sausage Gravy recipe on this site is better.  You won't have to add extra fat (butter) if you leave the meat in like that recipe suggests.  Extra steps for almost no difference, the outcomes are pretty similar.  I use the extra milk this recipe calls for (3c instead of 2c).  Other than that the recipes are almost the same.  I don't use Bob Evans sausage unless I happen to have it on hand (the other recipe calls for it).  I have used Jimmy Dean and a few other brands, I can't tell the difference.  Call me uncultured swine I guess!  LoL

Made exactly as written. So easy and so much better then packaged gravy.  Use the maple flavored sausage and only butter (if your eating this you will have to cut calories somewhere else!)

I didn't have any maple sausage, so I used regular Jimmy Dean and stirred in some brown sugar while the meat was browning. Mmm. So good, I made this gravy two weekends in a row. Perfect with Grands biscuits.

My husband love's sausage gravy so I try to make it once a month or so.  I find it easier to leave the sausage in the pan after it is done cooking, along with the drippings.  I don't add any butter. I just sprinkle the flour in with the sausage slowly stirring until all of the flour is absorbed.  Then I add 2 cups of milk and simmer until thickened.  It always works.  I usually use 1% or 2% milk because we like the gravy thinner.  This is so quick and easy.

Perfect gravy! Came out exactly how I love it.  Stuck with the basics of the recipe, only changed a few of the flavor elements.  I used sage flavored sausage, as I'm more partial to savory versus sweet.  Added a minced  shallot, chili pepper, some white and black pepper as i wanted a little heat.  Also melted some aged white cheddar on the biscuits which ended being amazing

Very tasty... Gravy was not as thick as would have liked it... Next time I will either add a touch more flour or a little less milk... Very good though.

This is one of the best recipes for sausage gravy I have seen. I usually use a spicy hot sausage instead of maple, but it would be worth giving maple a try.  There is no reason to take the sausage out of the pan.  Browning the flour is essential, one reason restaurant gravy is so bland, they don't brown the flour.  I use enough flour to soak up the drippings, add salt and pepper, brown, and then add enough milk to make it the right consistancy.

Great recipe.  For a change, try it with buttermilk.  I like it best with buttermilk.

I use follow this recipe all the time but I don't use the maple flavored sausage (personal preference).
It is very good.  for those of you who have to criticize healthy choices I suggest you go to the "Healthy Cooking" tab on this same site.  Just because someone like's this type of food does not mean we eat it 3 times a day OR every day.

What a recipe.... I gave it a high five on QUICK and EASY. The next was TASTE and FLEXABILITY... The final was a down to earth GOOD recipe... I loved the maple sausage for this recipe because it added the element of "breakfast", and served it with fluffy scrambled eggs. WHAT COULD BE BETTER? LOVED it!

I wasn't crazy about this.  I added maple since I didn't have that type of sausage and a bit of cayenne as another reviewer suggested.  I didn't skip steps, and it still tasted floury to me.  Not a nice mouthfeel.  Could be I'm just not a fan of/used to white gravies.  This is the first I've tried to my recollection.

This is close to my usual sausage gravy, with a two/three changes.  1)  I do not remove the sausage...just sprinkle the flour, and whisk for a few minutes....but do not allow it to start to brown. 2)  I use evaporated fat free milk.  Started doing this to make it easier for camping, and found it improved the entire dish.  This will also lower the calories.  3) For an everyday/week-end gravy I use turkey breakfast sausage.  It make it more healthy, and allows us to enjoy more frequently.  For special occasions -- maple is the way to go!

This is SO GOOD, and easy as can be. I'm from the South, and I made these for a Midwestern guy I was dating who was very charmed by the idea of me cooking him up some biscuits and sausage gravy. haha I used regular sausage and followed the directions exactly, then served the gravy with homemade buttermilk biscuits hot out of the oven. The guy was putty in my hands.

Fantastic! Super simple and super fast. It's even better the next day. My only alteration was using sage sausage instead of maple. I also used 1% milk instead of whole and it turned out just fine.

This is the BEST sausage gravy recipe I have ever made! I made it (exactly as the recipe says) for a church potluck (it was breakfast themed) along with a bunch of biscuits and it got AMAZING reviews! Thanks for sharing!

I decided to make this recipe as a healthy version.  The words "fattening" in the description seemed unapealing.  I used reduced fat biscuits, turkey sausage, 2% milk and 50% reduced fat butter.  Came out awesome! Thanks for the recipe.  I nearly cut the calories down by 75% and it tasted just as good!

Make in a large cast iron skillet - and I've always used Sage sausage (I tried Smokehouse sausage once and didn't like it at all).  Over hot biscuits - just the way grandma made!  I've served over toast too.  I transferred it into a crockpot to take to a pitch-in at work and it disappeared.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

My husband is the biscuits and gravy connoisseur in our family.  He said this was excellent, but not quite to the outstanding level.  However, he also added, "Feel free to continue making this recipe 'often' while you work out what little thing is missing!" :o)--UPDATE--Here is what he says makes it the "world's best".  I use regular Jimmy Dean sausage and follow the directions exactly.  Then, I add two pinches of cayenne pepper, 60 twists of freshly ground black pepper (from a McCormick disposable shaker), and a swirl of maple syrup just before letting it simmer.  Delicious!  Of course, the thing that puts it right over the top is fresh, homemade biscuits!

Very good - took a little while to thicken, but stayed PERFECT in the crockpot for brunch buffet. Needs pretty heavy seasoning ~ and maybe we'll try it with other types of sausage as well. Very good!

This was good...but we found it to be a little bit bland.  Even with the sausage drippings it still needed something.  I will definately use again because it was so easy...but will try to flavor up a bit.  Thanks for the post.

My husband loves this recipe.  He loves biscuits and gravy and I have tried many recipes.  I finally found it! This is a winner.  I know it says "Serves 6", but he insists on more than one serving, so I'd say it serves 4 hungry people.  He's the only one who eats it, so I freeze the rest in Food Saver bags.  It freezes very well.  Just heat it up with another splash of cream or milk.  Every weekend we have "Biscuits and Gravy Sunday".  If I ever stopped making this, I'm sure he would leave me.

The only thing missing in this gravy is sage. Also pour a container of milk and let it sit out, before you start cooking the sausage, so you're not adding cold milk to the hot gravy pan. Works much better.

I'll be75 this summer. My mother showed me this recipe when I was in school. She learned from her mother.

The only variation is we used all lard, no butter.

I have my grandchildren making it now.

It's also good with chipped beef, SOS., or chicken or turkey and cheese.

Really, really good gravy! I am challenged in the gravy making department (even though I'm a decent cook in general) and this worked perfectly for me! I used 1% milk since it was on hand and babied the gravy until it thickened. This recipe taught me that good gravy takes time and this recipe is well worth it. We didn't use maple sausage because we are not fans of the flavor.

I used regular sausage with the plan to add maple syrup at some point, but I forgot.  Anyway, it was very good without it.  I did have to add more flour to get the sauce to thicken however.  And later, after it sat on the stove for a while, it seemed too thick, so I had to add some milk to thin it out.  To add more flavor, I chose some additional spices for the sauce; garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper flakes for just a bit of heat.  I will make this one again!

I have made this now several times and for several people - it is delicious!  The only changes I make is since I don't care for maple flavored sausage, I use either regular or spicy sausage, use 2% milk and I have used margarine instead of butter but it always gets rave reviews!

I also use the base sauce as my "go-to" white sauce for creamed onions or as a white gravy for chicken fried steak.  It is wonderful!

Great recipe!  I prefer mild sausage, as I don't like the sweetness of maple in my gravy, but that's just a personal preference.  I've even used this recipe with 2% milk, when that's all I have.  It's worth the calorie splurge every once in a while!!!  Makes a great, hearty breakfast-for-dinner meal too!  My husband loves it, and he even asked me to teach him how to make it so he can make me breakfast ... maybe someday :)

Made this recipe both ways; one with maple flavor and the other with regular sausage.  The maple flavor was the winner, hands down.  Followed it to the letter and served it over buttermilk biscuits... fantastic.  Thanks for a great breakfast comfort food!

I used regular pork sausage. I didn't have to use any butter because the pork sausage had more than enough drippings for me to make a roux. I didn't add any salt and pepper to it because I wanted to have something to base my future calculations of additions on. :) Very awesome. My husband loves it. I used bisquick biscuit mix. All together a delicious meal.

Perfect recipe for homestyle gravy. We added a little Tony's Creole seasoning at the end of the simmer time and it took it just that extra notch away from sweet to savory while still keeping the maple flavor. Take the time to make your own biscuits. They hold up so much better than refrigerated biscuit dough. Thanks for the recipe!

This is good but we aren't crazy about using maple sausage. Try using regular sausage with a few ounces of hot sausage.

This was wonderful...I used 1 cup of ½ & ½ and 1 cup milk and I thought the consistency was perfect...I think 3 cups of liquid would make it to runny...I used ¼ cup of gravy per biscuit half...This is a definite keeper!

I made it as written, pouring the flour in first and whisking then pouring the milk. Mines came out really lumpy. Even after whisking the heck out of it I still had some lumps. I find it best to pour flour in liquid in another bowl/cup and whisking before pouring into the pan. I plan to do it this way the next time I make this. Even with the lumps it was very good. My mom and daughter loved it. I also made homemade biscuits :-)

I definitely do not like the maple sausage with gravy.   I use a mixture of sage and spicy or just sage and add chili flakes.  It kind of amazes me that we need to add fat when using sausage these days, it's gotten so lean.  I guess that's a good thing.

Perfect, simple gravy.  Even a beginner couldnt mess this up.  3C of milk is perfect.  It thickened up to the right consistency, and I didnt have to keep thining it out.  I used 2% milk, sage sausage and lots of salt and pepper.

It was very good, but it was lacking a little more flavor. I'll use a different brand of sausage next time. Jimmy Dean didn't do it for me. Still, it was the first time I made this dish, and came out pretty good.

This recipe is the Real Deal, except that I've always used "original" sausage.  The sausage should be removed while browning the flour, because it takes TIME to make a roux like this.  This step is NOT get rid of the pasty flour taste.  That will happen effortlessly during the simmering period!  What Bill's doing--and we should be, too--is SLOWLY BROWNING the flour, stirring often to prevent burning.  If you leave the sausage in throughout this process, the sausage gets overcooked, and you won't be able to tell when the flour becomes "light brown." Browning the flour adds tremendous flavor, just as browning meat does, but you can't do it fast.  Sure, you can stir the flour around a little and then add the milk, but it won't be the same gravy.  Personally, I like the gravy BOTH ways, "white" and "brown," but Bill specifically says to cook the flour "until light brown."  And the picture seems to confirm that he did.  You're right, Bill, this IS the best!

this is an ok recipe.  I don't use maple sausage, we use a local butchers homemade sausage.  try adding 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce and fresh cracked pepper and 1/2 tsp papricka.gives it a lot more flavor.  your also should just add the flour to the drained sausage and cook it for a few minutes. you don't need to add fat to it.

I just made this again ( have done so many times) for last night's "breakfast-for-dinner". I love the maple sausage (and YES, I put maple syrup on my regular-flavored sausage). This is a tasty sausage gravy, and I have never had any problem (as someone did) with it tasting "floury". It won't taste that way if the flour is cooked sufficiently. It's called a "roux". Thanks, Bill, wherever you are!

to make it easier but avoid the flour-y taste you can add the flour directly to the cooked sausage, brown slightly, then add the milk.

Hubby said best he's ever had! I used regular sweet sausage in place of maple (all I had). Next time will definitely try the maple sausage.

I have to give this a 5. There is another gravy recipe on this site I actually like better but it doesn't have sausages included with it. This was good. I served it over Miss Betty's Super Quick Dinner Rolls.

Don't care for the maple sausage, and to make it even simpler, you don't have to remove the sausage, just before it is cooked, sprinkle the flour in and stir it into the sausage and drippings, till the sausage is fully cooked,and the flour looses its "floury" taste, then add milk and whisk till thickened, makes it less messy, and a WHOLE lot easier.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

This is exactly the way I make it but I also add a few dashes of hot sauce and I use regular sausage.  Sometimes I use the hot sausage and omit the hot sauce. Sometimes I don't take the sausage out of the pan, just add the flour to the cooked sausage, then the milk and simmer. Thanks for the recipe- Wonderful.  Gary

Bill, Bill, Bill!! I've prepared this wonderful recipe as a reward to my 28 co-workers in my office for over a year now. Sometimes I make it as per your recipe. Sometimes I use regular sausage and add sage. (Sage sausage I've found to be a little too intense. I use the dried spice) One thing I ALWAYS do is add half bacon drippings and half butter to the roux at the onset. Anyway I've done this, it is jaw-dropping good! Thanks, Bill!

I made this gravy to serve over the Johnny Biscuits recipe from this site.  Great combination!!  I didn't have whole milk so I used a combination of evaporated milk and water.  I also used a combination of sausages cause it was what I had on hand.

Okay, I have can make a deboned wild duck stuffed with a wonderful wild rice, cranberry orange stuffing... on and on... I have NEVER been exposed to much of the basic midwestern/southern foods such as sausage-gravy.  Well... now I am engaged to a meat and potatoes midwestern guy who doesn't want my "High brow" cooking but wants things like this.  I made this recipe and with trepidation served it to my very picky meat and potatoes guy.  VOILA!!!  Success!!!  So thank you much for this recipe it has redeemed me in my man's eyes... still not interested in raspberry chocolate truffle torte... Oh, well!

Great recipe, just for you out there that are health conscience, I omitted the butter and it was still great, there's enough fat from the drippings without adding more!!  I took the advice of another and just wisked the milk and flour together in a bowl then poured it right into the pan with the sausage, YUMMY, Thanks for the recipe:)

I just made this for dinner this evening with Bisquick Garlic biscuits and it was AWESOME.  My husband loved it, and I will definitely be making it again.  I used 2% milk instead of whole milk, and it still came out wonderful.  I didn't remove the sausage when I browned the flour with the butter, and it worked perfectly, and I had dinner on the table in no time.  Thanks, Bill for an awesome gravy recipe!!

This was excellent.  While browning the sausage, I mixed the flour and about 1 cup of the milk in a shaker.  Then when the sausage was fully browned I added it to the pan with the sausage and drippings along with the remainder of the milk.  This made it easier than trying to remove the sausage and whisk in the flour and milk. Great dish!  I will definitely make this again.

We prefer the hot spicy sausage, but use whatever sausage is your preference.

I love cooking this for my family - it's down home comfort food!  My friend's husband is very jealous that MY husband gets homemade sausage gravy...should I tell my friend (his wife) how easy it is?  Hmm...nah!

I've never had this dish before, so this was my first time tasting it anywhere.  Seems as though it shouldn't be sweet.  Will try it again using regular flavored sausage.  Also, was thinking this might be good (with reg. sausage) with added cheese and spooned over grits or mashed potatoes.  Will post again after I try that.  My kids loved it as is and asked for seconds.

This was ridiculously good!  I am a bit of biscuits and gravy connoisseur and this is the best recipe I have ever found.  I would recommend using normal sausage if you are not a fan of sweeter gravy, on the other hand if you like it then definitely use the maple flavored sausage.

First time I made sausage gravy from scratch (I usually cheat & buy the packaged mix). Super easy & really flavorful. Plus you just use what you already have on hand. Followed the recipe exactly except used half regular & half hot Jimmy Dean sausage. Thanks!

Very yummy! Didn't use maple sausage, just the regular kind. I sprinkled just a few light shakes of garlic powder into the gravy as it was simmering, simply because I'm a garlic fanatic! This turned out great! Simple, too. Thanks, Bill. :-)

These biscuits were So simple and too about 10 minutes to prep and get them in the oven!  I baked mine for about 11 minutes ( my oven runs very hot!)  at 425 and they came out golden brown and delicious!  While they were baking, I whipped up some simple white gravy with 4 tbsp butter, 1/4 c. milk and about 1 to 2 cups milk..added some salt and pepper and it was perfect right about the time my timer was going off.  Nothing like a comforting breakfast on a chilly Saturday morning!  Thanks for the recipe!!  It is for sure going in my permanent file!

This is the BEST sausage gravy recipe that I've tried. I almost used regular sausage because I was worried that the flavor would not be "right" w/ the maple. I'm so glad that I didn't. The maple sausage gives this recipe the most wonderful flavor. Thanks so much Bill.

I made this for part of a Mother's Day brunch and it was a HUGE success. I doubled the recipe and used one roll of Jimmy Dean's hot and one mild and it was perfect. I will never use another recipe. Thanks so much!

I make this sausage gravy all the time. I only use regular sausage though. I don't even bother to remove the meat from the pan. After the meat is pretty much cooked through, I throw the butter(if it needs it) and the flour in the pan and finish browning it all together. When the flour is golden brown add your milk, adding more until desired thickness. Add salt and pepper or any other seasonings to taste. Wonderful!!!

Very good and easy meal. We had it for dinner with biscuits one night and it was a big hit. It did take a little while to thicken up.I used 2% milk and country crock light and it still turned out fine.Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good recipe!  I used regular sausage (I didn't think we'd like the maple).  It had a perfect flavor.  I will definately make this again.

MMM MMM MMMMMM!!! I've made this a couple of times already, and will surely be making it again (and again). The first time I used the maple sausage, and the second time I used hot sausage. They are both really delicious! Definitely a keeper for my recipe collection!

Oh my my. This is great! I didn't have maple sausage, so I used hot sausage. Delicious. And I had only 2% milk, so I added a titch of heavy cream. :-)  Next time I'm trying the maple sausage and whole milk to see if it's even better. With the maple, I'll probably add a bunch of black pepper. BTW, I halved the recipe and it worked great. Now I wish I'd made a whole batch!

Oh Bill...just like Grandma used to make.  Thanks!  Maple Sausage all the way, sprinkle your hot sauce on the finished product if you like it spicy!  Super fast, super quick, and super easy!  Great recipe for the beginners.  Real Butter, full fat milk, makes the best product!  This is not time to skimp people...Last for nearly a week in the fridge so make a double batch, it re-heats well.

Everyone loved this gravy.  I use what ever sausage I have on hand and always turns out great.  For a little extra flavor instead of salt I add a chicken bouillon cube.

I am a southern girl who has never even attempted to make gravy.  I just thought I'll leave that to grandma. I've always heard how difficult it is to make gravy,  it's lumpy, too thin, too thick etc. Well this is the first recipe I've ever tried and the only one I'll ever use.  I still can't believe how easy it is!  It actually tasted like grandmas!  My husband was even surprised.  Its not every day you find recipes like these that take you home again. Thank you Bill!  By the way I did'nt have whole milk so I used skim and there was no problem at all.

I used the fat from 3 or 4 strips of bacon and added crumbled up bacon at the end, but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T, and it was great!  Thanks so much!  Will definitely be a winter weekend staple.

Excellent recipe. Big hit with overnight guests who never had biscuits and gravy before. It's great with frozen biscuits which makes it even quicker and easier to prepare.

EXCELLENT!  This was the best sausage gravy Ive ever tasted and the first time making sausage gravy as well.  I recommend using Jimmy Dean or Tennessee pride sausage.  The maple flavor adds a nice kick and also, if possible use LOL (land o lakes) butter!  This gravy was awesome 3 days after I made it and I will make it again and again.  ITS A WINNER!

My husband has everyone at work convinced that I am the best wife.  I get him Philsbury Dough Biscuits and make this gravy for him and he takes it to work for breakfast.  His co-workers are all jealous. (Little do they know how easy this recipe is.)

This was the best sausage gravy I have ever cooked. It might be the best I've ever tasted for that matter. The only thing I would do different is to under season the gravy before adding the sausage. I forgot to allow for the saltiness of the sausage. Great recipe Bill. Thank you!

This was my first time trying sausage gravy. It sounded like a good idea, but it didn't do much for me. Maybe it's an acquired taste.   I might make it again for my boyfriend since he liked it more than I did. I noticed that the sausage didn't leave much drippings behind....they sure make sausage lean these days.

I served this gravy on top of some country fried steak and it was delicious. The only "fault" with it was really my own fault-I made it slightly too salty because when I was tasting the gravy while preparing it, I felt it was bland so I seasoned it well. However, when we ate it with the steak, the flavor really came to life, so remember that when you try it the first time. This is definitely the recipe I will use from now on for breakfast foods! Thanks, Bill.

Wonderful side dish for my Mother's Day brunch.  My only suggestion is to count on this taking longer to thicken than the recipe calls for.  Mine took around 50 minutes to thicken, but was well worth the wait!

Awesome!I made it the day before my Sunday brunch & stored it in a quart canning jar. The next morning I transfered it to a serving bowl and warmed in the microwave (it was so thick I had to add a little more milk) The flavors were blended perfectlly and I received many compliments. I made a single recipe for 6 adults and 3 small children. We had a tiny bit left over. Fantastic!!

This is super easy to make and tastes great! I now make a double batch each time I make it. I use 1 maple and 1 hot sausage. The only thing I don't double is the butter...instead of using 6 tablespoons I only use 4. Six made it too greasy. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Fabulous!  I only had regular sausage on hand so I drizzled some real maple syrup into the sausage as it was cooking, about 1 tablespoon and added a few dashes of cayenne pepper. Perfect and delicious.

Amazingly simple to make and basically fool proof! Tried with multiple variations but came downtown to overall best in my opinion was: 
-Subbing the sausage with 1/2 maple sausage and 1/2 spicy sausage....gives it just the right amount of sweetness with a little kick of spiciness. *play with the ratio of maple and spicy sausage to fit your tastebuds....ie: for more sweeter gravy use more maple sausage.
-Leaving the ground sausage in its drippings to make the roux, then adding the milk slowly and using the back of the tablespoon to help mix and mush the roux with the milk forming smoothest gravy
-I feel the slower you go with this gravy the tastier it becomes....it allows all the flavors to merry together quite nicely. 

Never again with sausage gravy will I go back to mixing my flour and milk then pouring over the sausage to mix and serve....so splendidly ecstatic to have found this recipe!

Read the recipe, had to try right then. Didn't have maple (wish I had & next time will) used 8 thawed patties. Pretty much followed recipe to a T. After you add flour you need to stir constantly, and when it starts to turn brown, does so quick, keep an eye on it. Right before the simmer part I did add:

1/8 tsp onion powder,
1/8 tsp garlic powder,
pinch of cayenne (bout half an 1/8) don't really like spicy hot,
heaping 1/8 tsp oregano,
1/4 tsp parsley flakes,
1/4 tsp pepper,
1/8 tsp salt, lord knows there is enough sodium in everything we eat, and
right before serving...3/4 - 1 tbsp chives.....

Scrambled a couple eggs, put on the biscuits, and YES MA'AM, YOU ARE WELCOME. My Memaw would be proud.

This is the same recipe I use for gravy every time I make biscuits and gravy.  Don't think you're limited to just maple sausage.  This recipe can be swapped out with just about any type of breakfast meat.  My family loves it with mild country sausage.

This is my first review so here goes! I made this with my fiancee this past weekend and it was amazing - restaurant quality! We made a few adjustments. I first cooked the sausage in a little bit of water for moisture. When it was almost finished cooking, we added cayenne pepper to it for a kick. We did not remove the sausage from the pan but added in the  butter then flour then milk, all the while whisking it. We then added salt and pepper for more flavor and had it simmer for about 15 minutes and that was it. Very simply to make and absolutely delicious!

Much like the recipe I already use aside from the butter. This was excellent. I did add a bit more flour. Next time thinking of adding in a little bit of caramelized onion.

This basic recipe is how I've made my gravy for years. However, I use sage or a combination of sage and spicy flavored sausage, never use butter (it's rich enough,) and I just add the flour right onto the sausage without removing it from the skillet first, cooking it for a few minutes before adding the milk, it's quicker. Sometimes I sauté minced onion along with the sausage and since I don't like big chunks of meat I use a pastry blender to break up the pieces just before I add the flour. A generous helping of fresh ground pepper and a splash of heavy cream and your guests will be licking their plates and begging for more!

The only maple sausage I could find came in patties, and these are difficult to pull apart when raw and impossible to do when cooked. Be sure you have sauage of whatever kind that comes in a large tube.

Delicious, fast and easy recipe! Definitely my go-to for a sausage gravy brunch. Also very tasty with sage sausage. I find that a high-quality sausage makes all the difference and improves the flavor tremendously!

I've tried Maple, but we prefer the hot sausage.  Brown the sausage with some grated onions, if you like them.  Add the flour directly over the sausage and stir and brown the flour.  It will mix up on the sausage and use the oil from the sausage as well.  If you need more fat, add  1 T. of Olive oil and 1 T. butter. Pepper with fresh ground, quite heavily.  Bake the biscuits, I always like to split them and butter, but some prefer them whole.  While the biscuits are baking, add 2 to 3 cans of evaporated milk from the can and at least one can of water to keep it still thin enough to put on the gravy and not just globs. You can add salt at the table, if you really need it, and more black pepper or red sauce.  Enjoy.  Been making this forever.

Though this is ok my version has less fat, tastes just as good and is less work.  1 lb sausage of your choice, we like 'Hot' pork sausage, 2 heaping Tbs. flour or 3Tbs. gluten free alternative flour mix (like Pamela's brand),1 can evaporated milk (reg or skim), salt and pepper or additional seasonings to taste and additional fresh whole milk as needed.
Brown sausage well on medium high heat until you have browned bits on the bottom of the pan-cast iron works best. Stir in flour (w/o removing the sausage) and let it cook a few minutes stirring occasionally. Add canned milk while stirring and bring to a boil.  Once boil has been reached and gravy has thickened taste, adjust seasonings as needed and add additional milk if it gets too thick or you need to stretch the servings out or like less sausage in your gravy.  Enjoy.

Do not understand why it is necessary to remove the meat ..... I totally bypass that step and as long as you continue stirring while adding the milk and while it simmers after for a bit, it smooths out beautifully .... I never have "lumpy" gravy ( not counting the sausage, of course )

Much too bland. Garlic powder does the trick. Also, I don't do exact measurements. I slice off a chunk of rolled sausage and fry till just cooked through. I do not remove it from pan--just add some butter then flour until it's a paste. Cook for at least one minute then gradually add in your milk to the consistency you prefer for your gravy. Season to taste with salt, pepper and garlic powder. This is my one-Sunday-a-month breakfast treat.

Wow this recipe has me floored! Soooo good!!!

I grew up in the South but live in NJ now.  It is IMPOSSIBLE to find sausage gravy in this part of the country.  sigh.

I decided to make this for my mom (another Southern gal) for Mother's Day.  Some tips and adjustments below:

-Def use a cast iron pan.  It's like flavor x 3!

-"sweet" sausage gravy sounded weird to me so instead of maple I picked up Hot sausage instead - Jimmy Dean brand and used 3/4 of the package.  I bet this tastes just as good with Sage flavored sausage.

-I know it's just flour but King Arthur Organic is superior.  $2.89 for a small package but you will absolutely notice the difference between  high quality product )organic or not) and a regular one.

-I measured out 3 cups of milk but whisked in a little at a time, adding more when the texture got too thick during cooking.   In the end I was left with about 1/3 cup.  

I can't believe I waited so many years to try making one of my top 5 favorite foods!!  I was going to be extra special and make homemade biscuits too but wanted everything to be perfect for my mom.  So I decided to stick with what I know and spread the gravy out on Pillsbury "southern style" biscuits instead.   Delicious - and super filling!!!    This one is a keeper!

A good 'core-recipe'. Thank you. Have been making this with moose sausage in recent years. It tastes great, but moose tends to need some fat to brown nicely, even as sausage. Butter doesn't like the heat from browning, so I use bacon grease if I've got it and a high-smoke-point oil if I don't. (I omit the butter when I do this as it isn't needed.) If you try this, watch the salt when seasoning your gravy; bacon grease is quite salty. A half teaspoon (more/less to taste) of sage adds variety, too. YMMV

I just posted a review but inadvertently failed to also add that, as another reviewer suggested, I doubled the flour and milk but added just a little more milk. It tasted pasty at first but the extra splash of milk helped a lot!!

Hands down the BEST gravy ever. I used Turkey sausage and added 1/2 tsp of maple syrup to get that maple flavor that would have been lacking. This has become our new favorite breakfast! YUM!

I had only 1% milk and it worked just fine! I added a bit of cayenne pepper and used fresh cracked black pepper. I thought the maple flavored sausage would be too sweet but with the pepper, it's a good balance. I did need to add a bit more than 3 cups of milk.

Just remember, when building this gravy, take your time. Don't over cook the sausage. Whisk, whisk! Add flour gradually. Add milk gradually.

This gravy was great!  I had reservations about using maple sausage, but it was really good.  I made 2 batches one with hot sausage for my husband and he liked it that way better.

I used hot Italion, and followed the recipe. We had it last night for supper over some potatoes O'brian. Wasn't much left over. Good recipe, and pretty much what I have always done. Next time I go to the grocery I will get some maple sausage, and give it a try.

I've always made this gravy for my husband and kids.  My Kentucky mother-in-law taught me.  The only execption was we used bacon, of course you have to drain some of the bacon drippings b/c it would be way too much bacon drippings. They loved it!!  The sausage gravy it really good I used the regular sausage, instead of the Maple.

Very good recipe.
 I made changes but they were for personal preference: Sage flavor sausage and I used skim milk instead of whole milk.

Yum! Very tastey and easy. To those people who say it's too high in fat, don't eat it every day... very good for one of those "comfort food days".  I would rather spend my fat and calories on something like this than chocolate ice cream. :)

I use corn starch, but mix the starch in with the cold milk FIRST, and then add to the drippings/melted butter.  No lumps!!

Sausage and gravy has never been my favorite, but this gravy is fantastic.  Added some onion and minced garlic.  Served over J. P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits.  Husband rated it higher than his favorite breakfast place!

Oh my god, this is perfection.  I love sausage gravy and had to try this recipe.  I didn't bother taking the sausage out of the pan but instead added the whisked flour and milk to it (I used 1% milk).  I didn't use maple sausage though.  I didn't have any on hand so I'll have to try it with the maple sausage some other time.  I kept adding the salt and pepper to achieve the taste I wanted.  The cook is always allowed to test the food:)  Thank you for the recipe.

I would have given this recipe 10 stars if I could. I made this for my husband and some friends last week and it was Sooooo good. I made a double batch and sent some home with my friends. She texted me the next morning that she had thought about those leftovers in her fridge it all night and ate it the next morning first thing because it was so good. My husband also devoured it. Not very healthy but who cares when something tastes this good!!

GOOD recipe. Bill, you must be a Southerner! To those who think the melted butter is too much??? oh, no. The butter adds the "flava".  I do use a pork sausage without the maple flavor though. Lots of pepper, even a dash of cayenne in mine! Serve over hot bisquits, with coffee and fresh fruit cup. Filling.

Thanks Bill. I was averagely interested in this, and thought it provides a good base for different flavours. But my family luuuved it, including my small children, so I need to give it a 5 star rating. I only had sundried tomatoe sausages and added about half of a fresh onion finely chopped.

This was my first time making sausage gravy and it did it just for my dad because I have never been a fan but this was awesome.  I even had seconds!  It goes perfect over some homemade buttermilk biscuits.  It's simple and delicious

Made this for breakfast on fathers day. I used sage sausage as this is what I had on hand. I also substituded  a 1/2 cup light cream for some of the milk as I use skim milk and this made it extra creamy. Very good overall will make many times more.

I tried these today and was absolutely delighted. I did not have any maple flavored sausage so I just used regular breakfast sausage.  I used this on Johnny’s Biscuits and oh my, was it wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Simple and fantastic.  How could anything with 50g of fat per serving not be delicious!  I use sagey breakfast sausage instead of maple.  Add a dash or two of tabasco at the end- you won't be able to taste hot sauce, but the vinegar and cayenne will make the sausage flavors pop.  To get rid of the flour taste, simmer longer.  Anything thickened with a white roux should simmer for 30 minutes stirring often.  If you can taste flour, the sauce is not done.  You may have to add additional milk as the sauce will continue to thicken while simmering.

Fabulous! I've made this using hot sausage and maple sausage, but I prefer the hot sausage. Leftovers are even good the next morning!  I've also made it frying the sausage patties (for the grease) but not using them in the gravy...just making sweet milk gravy. Definitely my go-to gravy recipe.

Wow, yum!  So easy, and so good!  We use regular breakfast sausage - don't care for the maple flavor - and we usually have enough left over for another meal.  I've used skim milk and half and half, and it never fails.  Thanks, Bill, for sharing!

Delicious!!!  I have made this recipe several times following the directions exactly and it comes out great.  I use this recipe for camping and make it at home and freeze.  I bake my biscuits the day before we leave as well.  Thaw and warm in a saucepan and you are good to go!

My family loved this!  I used regular sausage instead of the maple flavored, but other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit!  Oh yeah, I used half 1% milk and half canned milk.  Didn't make a difference at all in the consistency!  In fact, I needed to add a tad more milk just before serving because it really thickened up nicely!  Thanks for a real, honest-to-goodness comfort food recipe!  We will totally make this again!

I already make good sausage gravy, but I have had lots of practice in my lifetime.  I just wanted to let everyone know, that your's sounds just like mine.  I never measured my ingredients before.  It just came naturally since I lived on a farm and had fresh cows milk.  It's okay made with the cream skimmed off. (2% milk works fine) We used the cream to make our own butter, or home made ice cream.  I give this recipe 5 stars, because it sounds so good. I make my own biscuits too.  It's real easy to make them if you use self-rising flour because you don't have to add the baking powder, etc, just shortening and milk. (sweet or buttermilk will both work) There's probably directions on the back of the bag.

first let me say that i am so glad to know that i'm not the only person who makes bisquits and gravy with maple sausage.  i LOVE jimmy dean maple...use it in stuffing and queso...i know, gross right? but it's REALLY tasty.  i always use bisquik instead of flour and make the gravy in a separate saucepan, but next time i'm gonna try it this way!!!

This is great for a wintery Sunday morning, and it's approaching quickly here!  I use Atkins low carb milk. 4 carbs and only 90 calories. Takes the guilt out and does not harm the wholesomeness of the recipe. I like the sausage w/bacon. You have got to serve this over the "Miss Betty's Super Quick Dinner Rolls" from this site. They are not rolls but biscuits. They are hearty and don't have the baking powder aftertaste. The gravy doesn't sog them up. Amazing. Just bake the biscuits for about 20 minutes or so.( don't be fooled, they don't get over brown when done)and they are ready when the gravy is done. I just love this. Never had it before till I tried this recipe a few weeks ago.  Excellent recipe!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We are spicy food fanatics, so we put in hot sausage instead of maple....it's amazing!!!! We also started watching some of the fat and we use skim milk.  It takes a little longer to thicken, but the end result is still the same.

I've never made sausage gravy but have had it many times eating out.  This recipe was easy and wonderful!  I used regular sausage as that's all I had in the house.  Since it's just the two of us I had enough left over to frreze.  It made an a no-brainer dinner last week - all I had to do was thaw it and reheat it in a pan with some extra milk to thin it out.  Spoon over some biscuits and dinner is served!  This is a keeper!

I really liked this ~ I'm a big comfort food fan ~ but picky hubby didn't care for me "messing around" with his sausage. I'll be making it again though (hubby can make himself some toast).

Awesome!!!!  I made this recipe for a retirement breakfast at my husband's work.  I used 5 pounds of sausage (3 regular and 2 spicy), 3/4 cup butter. 1 1/2 cups flour and 15 cups milk.  OMGosh!!!  They couldn't get enough!  One guy was eating it with a spoon right out of a bowl - no biscuits!  This is the only sausage gravy I will make from now on!  Hats off to you Bill and thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I was able to acutally make a good breakfast gravy.  Next time I will not use the maple sausage my family did not like it, they wanted regular sausage.

This was a very good recipe.  Since I like a very thick gravy, I let this simmer for at least half an hour.  It reduced a lot because of this, so next time I will definitely double the recipe.  This made just enough for 4 people, covering 8 biscuits.

This should be called Bills Best Sausage Gravy. It was the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted. You can smell the maple of the sausage while you are waiting for it to thicken. It was on the sweet side, which I really enjoy, and it really doesn't need any seasonings beyond a little bit of fresh ground pepper. EXCELLENT DISH!

This was my first time making "real" sausage gray and it turned out great. I used reg sausage only because the store was out. It was a tad bland but salt and pepper helped a lot. Can't wait to use maple sausage the next time I make it. I won't be using any other recipes for gravy!

We had never tried to make our own sausage gravy before, so I was very selective when I looked for one on this sight...and this one was excellent!  Not only easy, but the best sausage gravy we have ever had!  We used regular flavored sausage and added some red pepper flakes for a little heat; otherwise, we didn't change a thing.  Thanks, Bill!

Yum! Although I was afraid my heart might stop while eating this dish with JP's Big Daddy Biscuits for dinner, it was worth all the fat and calories.  It is so filling, I can imagine this recipe feeding twice as many people as it says! I'll freeze the rest for another yummy meal!

Not like this recipe needs any more positive ratings, BUT...

...we LOVED this recipe! It was so easy and DELICIOUS! It turned out perfectly. I had doubts when it didn't look like it would thicken up, but be patient and it will work out just fine. It was so flavorful and creamy. Definitely don't make this if you're on a strict diet ;) but it was a wonderful treat!

These were pretty good, really gross looking though =/ I finally got my boyfriend to eat them (he claimed they looked like.. well, I won't mention it) on top of homemade biscuits. I added quite a bit more pepper b/c they were a little bland. Anyhow, pretty good. Thanks.

Good recipe, a tad bit sweet for my tastes. Had to add about a tablespoon of cayenne pepper to get it spicy enough.

Used 16 oz. regular sausage because that was what I had on hand. Still didn't look like enough grease to start with so I added an extra tablespoon of butter. This was my first time making gravy from scratch and it turned out great! Thanks Bill!

This gravy is very good!  I used Hot Sausage b/c that's what I always use.  It's just like the gravy I had growing up.  I never had a recipe for it b/c my mom just dumped the ingredients in.  Now, I have a recipe for it!  It reheats well after being in the refrigerator.  I just added a touch of milk and put it in the microwave.  Yummy!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Easy and Delicious.  To add richness, I substituted a can of evaporated milk for part of the milk, and to add a little depth to the flavor, I put in a dash of worcestershire.

This is the recipe I use every time I make biscuits and gravy. I use bacon grease instead of butter for more of a southern taste. Absolutely the BEST sausage gravy I've ever tasted. Thanks Bill!

Quite good! Very simple and easy to make. I also used regular sausage instead of maple, but I wish I had tried the maple, after tasting this gravy it might be a nice flavour. Will try next time!

I have never made homemade gravy before.  Not only was this incredibly easy but delicious as well.  My hubby, who loves biscuits and gravy loves this gravy!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe close at hand!

This gravy was very rich. I think it may be my fault a little though because I served it with very buttery biscuits ( canned ). I recommend not using biscuits that already have butter inside. I will be trying a different gravy next time, but this one was worth the try.

My husband says this is the best sausage gravy he has ever had anywhere.  I used regular sausage because I did not think he would like maple, but he can't stop raving about it and requesting it.  Thanks!

Sprinkling the flour over the sausage gives the same results, and saves time and dirty dishes.  Add butter or not, depending on the quantity of 'drippings' (fat) in the pan.

Very Impressed. I used to have Biscuits and Gravy with Sunday breakfast at a certain restaurant in Phoenix. Now that i'm in Australia i obviously can't get it. 
This recipe is just as good. I followed the directions to the letter and came up with a wonderfully thick and rich sausage gravy. Your choice of sausage is going to be the telling factor depending on what flavours you want to achieve. My butcher gave me a good sausage meat that had virtually no fat which was wonderful, so i did need the butter. Then i added the salt and pepper dead last after i gave all the ingredients a chance to blend all the flavours together. 
I made fresh homemade biscuits (scones) to go with it and my neighbour and i are loving it. Thank you very much for giving me a wonderful recipe and a little taste of home.

Simple and yummy.  I used 16 oz. of sausage which was fine.  When I reheated the leftovers the next day, I added more milk in order to thin it a little.  It made my ordinary (and dry) biscuits taste great!

This was pretty good. I like zesty foods, so I used spicy sausage and added a little paprika to spice it up. Otherwise it is not too shabby!!

I've tasted better sausage gravy. This was just OK because it was rather bland. I don't think I would make this again.

Great!  I didn't have any sausage and so I omitted it and followed the recipe as directed.  This makes very good basic white breakfast gravy!  Next time, I will try with the sausage.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the BEST sausage. The fisrt time I only had orginal sausage and put syrup on the meat and it was great and the second time used the maple syrup sausage. Too good for words.

I am not usually a fan of sausage gravy, but my husband and I feel this gravy was excellent.  I could not find maple sausage, so I added maple syrup to regular sausage after it was cooked.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because my husband really liked it....I made it this morning as part of his birthday breakfast....myself I don't think that maple flavoring is my thing.....the gravy itself was not hard to make at all...the end reults were great....looked wonderful....had a nice color and texture to it...next time I will use regular sausage with this recipe....definately will be using again!!!!

I didn't use maple sausage, but this was wonderful!!  I had original flavored Jimmy Dean links, which I diced up and fried in a couple tablespoons of butter--flavored up those drippings!  The best tasting sausage gravy I have ever made.  We'll have this again and again!

Very good but just a slight bit too sweet.  The family loved it though.  I will certainly prepare it again.  The next time I'll try maple flavored sausage and regular sausage.  The gravy is fantastic, thanks Bill

Awesome recipe.  I use regular seasoned sausage from a hog we had butchered.  Just the right amount of fat/flour/milk.  I usually spice it up a little more, but this is a good starting recipe.

Fast, easy, few ingredients and feeds alot...I made an extra two cups of white sauce and there was still plenty of sausage.  I didn't use maple, which we love...just too sweet for a gravy.  Family and my kid's friends had it for breakfast & all loved it! A keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe and my family loved it. This is just the recipe that I need to completely fill up my three boys and my husband. Their stomachs are bottomless pits, and this gravy along homemade jumbo biscuits filled them up till they could hardly breathe. Thanks Bill for your submission.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it with spicy sausage and sage sausage both. I also varied it once and used vegetarian sausage (soy) and Vance's dairy-free milk. Each time it was wonderful!!

This was pretty good.  I used skim milk and it still worked.  I can bet it would have been even better with whole milk!  It made a lot more than I expected.  Even my husband, who HATES biscuits and gravy, went back for seconds!

This is just fantastic! I haven't learned to make it in Australia, but for Christmas at home in the States I made this recipe for the family. YUM!!! Very creamy and just enough spices. I did add a little extra ground pepper to mine because I just like that. This was just as good McDonalds or Hardees if not better. Once I figure out how to get sausage perfect here like home then I'll be making this more often.
Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.
Thank you so much for this recipe!

Like candy!!!  When I first made these for my husband, he wasn't even hungry, but after he first tasted them, he filled up with them, and then couldn't wait until he had room for more.  And his excuse was that it was just like candy, it was so good.  I'm vegetarian so I can't say, but I know the smell was terrific.  Thank you so much, I've been told to toss any other sausage gravy recipes. :)

This is the best sausage gravy ever.  Made this for Christmas last year for the first time and now it's a regular weekend request.  Quite easy to make as well.

These are SO GOOD!!!!  Definitely a treat rather than an every day meal.  I made this exactly as specified.  The maple sausage was so good!!!  This is much better than what you usually get in restaurants.  (I'm from Georgia - I know!!)

This recipe was very easy and very yummy! This was the first time I tried to make biscuits and gravy and Bill helped me out!! My husband thought it was great. I did use regular sausage instead of the maple, but I think either way would be great. Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I used mild sausage (Jimmy Dean), skim milk and put it over store bought frozen biscuits.  Mmmmm, my husband remembered why he married a GEORGIA GIRL when I made this for him!!

This is excellent.  I have been making biscuits and gravy for awhile just kinda eyeing the ingredients, but decided I would try a recipe today and I am really pleased with this one.  I never simmered my gravy before, and I think that goes a long way in making the sausage flavor predominant and not floury or pasty.  I didnt have maple sausage today, and cant wait to try it with that.

I don't usually care for gravy, but even I think this is good!  If you're patient enough to cook it long enough and generous with the flour, I've found you can even cut down on the butter/milk ratio a bit without compromising the taste or texture.

As a southern gal who hates southern tradition types of food, i had never made gravy like this before.  Husband loved it, and i loved the fact it was quick and easy.  i served it over homemade buttermilk biscuits (using Bisquick), with bacon and OJ on the side.

I also used 12oz chubs of Jimmy Dean Maple and Sage sausages. I doubled the rest of the recipe and this was the BEST! We all went crazy over it! I've made it a few times now and it's the only biscuits and gravy I'll make. I use bisquick for very simple biscuits and have not had any left overs!

Great recipe - dont be skimpy with the salt and pepper!  I also used this with the J.T. Big Daddy Biscuits, and it went extremely well with this gravy.  It was also very good as leftovers - it did not separate or anything.  I used regular sausage; the maple sausage would definitely have been too sweet.  This is my gravy recipe from now on.  Thanks!!!!!

THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! I did it. I made sausage gravy and it was awesome. Everyone loved it. It was my very first time and I was worried.  Better than any I have had and my husband raved about it to his family when he called them for Christmas.

A very basic but authentic recipe for Biscuits and Gravy.  This recipe makes a roux which can not be substituted as in others with just flour and milk.  This was a big hit  with some picky eaters!  I followed recipe exactly and it's very flavorful although I used sweet Italian sausage and not maple.  Either would be great!

I’ve been making this for 20 years. My family asks for it once it gets cold here in Northern California. The challenge is finding Maple Sausage. So, after trial and error I have settled on adding 3 Tablespoons Maple Syrup a dash of cayenne pepper as well as a dash of seasoned salt and pepper. It’s a winner that keeps on wining.

Great recipe. I didn't have whole milk so I used 2% and there was no need to remove the sausage it cooks perfectly with the sausage still in the pan. That's just an extra unnecessary step to me. I'll def make this again!

This is so easy & always a crowd pleaser. I can't find maple sausage here, so I just use regular breakfast sausage & a squirt of maple syrup. It comes out great every time!

I'm sorry to say I didn't like the taste of the maple sausage. It was all I could taste: too much sweet, not enough savory. I tried to add a lot of extra pepper, as some of the other reviewers suggested, but to no avail. Thank you anyway!

I've made sausage gravy like this for over 40 years and is the way I prepare it most of the time. Another option would be to fry the sausage, drain the grease add milk to deglaze the pan, heat to simmer and thicken with a cornstarch slurry. Fewer calories and a different (good smooth) texture. Add salt and pepper to taste when thick. Though I use original mild bulk sausage as we don't care for the maple flavor.

This is how I make my sausage gravy, except I use Jimmy Dean's SAGE sausage roll and it is absolutely delicious! I'm from NY and had never heard of sausage gravy, until I moved south. My husband was from the south and he asked me to learn how to make it. Once I finally found the Jimmy Dean's sage sausage roll, my husband told me my sausage gravy was better than any diner, he had ever been to and he was very picky! I usually serve it over a nice big biscuit, with a fried egg . Makes a great meal! Yummy!

The best, the only thing I do different is add a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  Adds a bit more flavor, not so bland.

I've made this about five times now and my family continues to love this recipe.   I love to double the recipe then freeze or refrigerate the left overs.  Just toss it back on the stove, add a little more milk and it's good as new.   I always follow the given directions unless  I'm feeling a little more maple flavor-ey that day... then I'll add a tad bit of maple syrup.

This sausage gravy was good, i made slight changes. I used sage sausage instead of the maple because that is my preference and i added diced onions to give it a touch more flavor.

This sausage gravy is amazing!!! I am actually allergic to dairy and was able to make this dairy free! I just used regular almond milk and earth balance butter. Since there is no fat in almond milk, I added two tablespoons of cornstarch to help thicken up the gravy. I haven't had gravy in a long time and this sure hit the spot!

This was the first time I've made (or eaten) sausage gravy and it was a disappointment for me. It seemed heavy and bland rather than being full of flavor. My son bought breakfast sausage instead of maple sausage, so perhaps it needed that extra maple flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and added plenty of pepper and salt, but it still seemed to lack flavor. (However, my son loved it.) I'll probably makes this again with maple sausage or a more flavorful sausage just to see how much difference that makes.

This is a great recipe, but I use regular our hot sausage instead of maple like it says. I like it better that way, make this quite often and love it. Recommend this to anyone that likes biscuits and gravy.

S.O.S.
Been eating this Sausage/Hamburger Gravy for nearly 50 years, so I would say I'm somewhat of a authority on this delicious gravy..
Eggs to your liking on TOP of the gravy & biscuits to me is a MUST...
My first S.O.S tray made of metal was served in a mess hall in the Army and it was smack full of  sausage gravy and 3 eggs over medium on top..Eggs were perfect.  Seconds were free of course...
BTW,  Breakfast cost 15 cents if you were drawing food and housing allowance!
I'm still cooking it the same way as this recipe, and doesn't hurt to tweak it...

I made this as is - except I added a teaspoon of bacon grease to my roux ( and doubled it). This was the best sausage gravy I've ever made, hands down. We had guests for breakfast, and they each ate 2 plates full of biscuits and gravy. This will DEFINITELY be my go- to recipe!!

Being from Canada biscuits and gravy are pretty much unheard of.  I tried it while I was visiting the states and had such a craving for it, so I made tonight! It was fantastic and will make it again, I pretty much want to use this gravy on anything I can!

Tasted great.  I added a tablespoon of maple syrup because I didn't have maple sausage.  I crushed the smallest cayenne pepper I had (from my garden) and that made it a bit too hot for my taste, but not out of limits.

I don't like sausage gravy but I made this for my husband. I made it with mild Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand. He loved it. Super easy.

I used normal ground sausage and it turned out marvelously!! The only thing I messed up on was not adding enough water... But this recipe, coupled with my mother's biscuits, fed my wife and I for a couple of days. =]

Great stating point.I always tweek anything I cook so added some fresh herbs and a little hit of Toney Chachere's Creole spice to kick it up. What is great is the gravy lets the sausage and whatever back notes you add shine through. I would recommend using Bob Evans sausage roll. Cheap sausage will add too much grease and kill the taste.

This is as good as advertised.  Even with turkey sausage it is perfect every time.  Add more spice to suite your taste.  I always add more pepper and a touch of thyme for a bit more flavor.  To suit our new diet lately been using almond milk to thicken and it works great.

LOVE this recipe - have made it as directed, and also substituted the maple sausage for hot sausage in the past.  Have also thrown in some Sriracha sauce and vanilla in the past to shake it up :) Great base recipe by itself, but have fun with it!

This was excellent! The sauce took a little longer to thicken when I cooked it, so I gave it another 10 minutes. I served it over southern style biscuits, and the leftovers heated up well too!

I have NEVER been able to make gravy... as hard as I tried... but this was super easy and delicious!  I didn't put sausage in it because we were eating fried back strap and mashed potatoes with it.  I did add a little bacon grease.  It was a HIT!  I am now the 'gravy maker'.

I give this stars for technique. I used 2% milk and the consistency was beautiful. However, though it was not floury, it was bland. I used with regular flavored sausage links, which did not create much drippings, so I did use the butter, and I even added a little bit of maple syrup. I added a TON of pepper. We ate most of it and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as the packet at the store. Why? Flavor, it just didn't have much and adding the maple syrup was weird. I keep this recipe - again, for the technique - and I may tinker with it by adding garlic powder, or maybe a bouillon cube or something. I'm not sure.

I lived this recipe, it was my first time making home made gravy abd the maple sausage really made a difference. I ended up using pancake batter instead of flour cause I didn't have any. still tasted amazing. I agreed to add maybe a tad bit more flour or less milk.

We only used about two and a half cups of milk and we just had the regular flavor sausage, but this gravy was on point. Next time we may season it with a little cayenne or Tony's.

Our sausage around here comes in 16oz (1pound) packages other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out fantastic. I didn't have biscuits nor did I feel like making them from scratch so I cheated and spooned the gravy mixture over toast. I thought it was  good.

I grew up in the Midwest, and this is great! Only problem is that my sausage wasn't generating enough grease, so I supplemented with bacon grease.

It was a good thick gravy but it tasted bland. I think it's because I'm southern and used to gravy  with bacon grease instead of sausage. Hubby loved it though.

I have used this recipe many times. It never fails to disappoint the men in my house. I have found that using 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper adds a nice zing. I also began using 1/2 & 1/2 to make it richer, but milk works fine too.

Followed recipe completely.  Didn't have maple sausage though so used non-flavored or seasoned sausage and it still tasted delicious.

Thanks, I will be using it again and recommend it highly.

Very good and easy to make! Although I went with 6 oz maple flavor and 6 oz original. I didn't know if full maple would be too rich.

I added a can of cream of chicken soup. It really brought out the flavor and made the sauce a bit more interesting. I also sprinkled in some onion flakes and didn't add any salt. The soup and butter make it plenty salty. I also used corn starch to thicken the sauce instead of flour.

Excellent!  Only change I made was i used 10 patties, so had more grease and ended up close to a full cup of flour, and my hubby likes it thick, so I didn't measure the milk, just poured until I had am the right consistency.   also, I had I piece of bacon left from yesterday so I crumpled that up as well.

I had to cut the quantity since only needed enough for 2.
Very simple. Personally I like a thinner gravy so next time
I will cut back slightly on the flour.

This is a very GOOD recipe and I highly recommend it!
My son (Adam) always order it when we eat out and kept asking me to make it at home. I came across this recipe and made it. It was delicious and easy although  the gravy was very thick but I just added more milk or water. After I was comfortable making this I doubled the recipe and kept in refrigerator. When biscuits are gone, Adam made toast or English muffins. Now to learn how to make homemade biscuits....any recommendations would be welcomed! :)

We are a family that loves our sausage gravy. The problem with so many recipes is that it just comes out too plain. This was great, and a small dribble of maple syrup in it finished it off perfectly. Our new Sunday morning recipe

This is a pretty standard recipe - I tried it with the maple sausage and it was horrible. I'll stick to good ol' southern breakfast or sage sausage. And Bill, it is sacrilege to put sausage gravy over store bought biscuits. Take the extra ten minutes and whip a batch up yourself.

Big brunches I make it as written and everyone loves it!   Other times, I do alter the recipe based on what I have in my kitchen and it always turns out great.  A lot times I don't have whole milk - so I use what I have on hand - even skim.  I like spice so I use a country spicy breakfast sausage too - love it!

I just made this for breakfast but using bread instead of biscuits, making it an old Navy favorite (my version); SOS. I took another poster's idea and spiced it up a bit with a finely chopped habanero pepper. The milk help sooth the hot but yet still added flavor. The flour to milk ratio makes the perfect gravy. Thank you for the recipe.

Don't tell my mother-in-law, but this is replacing her sausage gravy recipe :). A couple things I changed: evaporated milk instead of whole (it's just what I had on hand) and added cinnamon. This gravy turns out smooth and creamy and the sausage flavor really comes through. Thanks for sharing this!

This was amazing! I didn't have sausage links so I used mild sausage and added maple syrup the last 3 min of cooking!! I will never go back to the sausage gravy in a packet!! Lol paired it with homemade, star shaped biscuits!!!

tried it today with my kids....was a bit too sweet with the maple sausage. I loved the fact that I can now make it, but I'm a bigger fan of a spicy kick, rather than sweet for a B&G recipe.  If you like sweetness in your B&G, this is going to be a big hit.  If not, I think I will go with a more spicy sausage next time.

I made this a few times now. I didn't try it with maple flavored sausage though. I've used regular breakfast sausage and hot Italian sausage. We poured it on top of biscuits. Yummy! My family enjoyed it, especially my bf who is a biscuits and gravy lover. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Wouldn't change a thing. I used 1% milk because that's what I had. I've never gotten the proportions right before and never used butter. Really good.

Made this recipe tonight using leftover sausage from breakfast.  My only changes were decreasing the flour by a tablespoon, and using 2 cups of heavy cream instead of the 3 cups of milk.  The results were fantastic in looks, texture, and flavor.  My husband and one year-old daughter gobbled it up with their dinner and asked for more.

We had an abundance of onions from the garden and I was including onions in everything I could think of.  I added diced onion near the end of browning the sausage, continuing to cook until the onions were translucent.  It added a little kick and now I always add onion.  This is definitely a family favorite.

I have made this recipe for years and have always just sprinkled the flour over the cooked meat and sautéed it a little and then poured the milk into it ....(omit butter... it is not needed).......then there are NEVER any lumps in the gravy.

Great recipe.  I cook hot sausage with some red pepper flakes and fresh cracked pepper. Drain fat.  Sprinkle about 2 Tablespoons Wondra (found in the flour isle in a blue cardboard can) on the sausage.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes on medium.  Add milk to the degree of thickness you desire.  This reduces the fat and calories.  I leave the salt out to reduce sodium, there is plenty in the sausage.  Judy

Adding a couple tablespoons of finely minced onion while cooking the sausage, adds a lot of flavor, but don't use too much. When my wife isn't eating this I throw in some crushed red pepper. I use hot milk. It cuts down on cooking time quite a bit, and you still get a very smooth creamy gravy.

This is an awesome recipe.  I have been making this since grade school.  I choose not to add butter since there is quite alot of grease from the sausage.  I have always used the spicy hot sausage roll, but if as written is too bland for you add some red pepper flakes, pepper, sage and/or garlic. Recipes for cooking are guidelines not rules; experiment and make it your OWN. ENJOY.

I make this quite often, and it is very good. These are my measurements for the gravy. 3 tablespoons of butter, 3 tablespoons of flour, and 3 cups of milk. I also cook the butter and flour until the raw taste of the flour is gone, and then add the milk. I guess everyone has their own method, so whatever works is best.

My husband makes a version of this.  He does not drain the Jimmy Dean regular sausage; uses Wundra instead of flour mixed with milk, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Awesome!

I've been doing all my white sauces that way for years and I'm outta the firehouse over 20. Now I'm making it for my grown kids and grandkids and I use the big tube of sausage! I concur with the Navy_Mommy, sage gives it a great kick and as I remember the firehouse heat was always a good thing!

I made sausage and biscuits to try with this recipe.  It's a solid recipe that works.  My hubby says that he'd order this at a restaurant even though he never liked sausage and gravy.  You can cut down the flour by a tablespoon, since you'd only need 3T of flour to go with the 3T of butter.

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I use it to serve over my chicken waffles.  I have to keep hubby from actually licking his plate clean.  The only thing I change was to sub one cup of the three cups of milk with half and half.  Gives it a slightly more creamy consistency.  The maple flavored sausage is what really makes it an over the top sausage gravy.

I make this for family & it can't be beat. For church however I add butter to the sausage drippings to equal 1-1/2 cup total, then add 1 tbsp. each of salt & pepper, 2 cups flour, a gallon of whole milk & 3lbs. sausage(I use locally packed regular mild & add 1/2 tsp. sage while browning). Cook as directed above. Makes 1-1/2 gallons. 
If you have any leftovers it freezes well. If it's become to thick just add a little milk or water to thawed gravy and whisk well.

I used Jimmy Dean regular sausage along with Wondra quick mixing flour for gravies. The ingredient amounts were the same and the sausage gravy turned out good. I made bisuits to go with the gravy definately will make again! Thanks for the recipe.

The is no need to remove the sausage from the pan before adding flour. It will coat the sausage crumbles and brown the flour perfectly. Once you start adding the milk, the flour and grease from the sausage blends perfectly and you never get lumps. By far the best gravy recipe ever!

I just made this today. Followed recipe but with mild sausage. It tasted great! I made it for my husband, who is search for the best sausage gravy. He said it was a close 2nd and gobbled it up. I do not like biscuits and gravy and before I served it I tasted it. Its good. I didn't have a plate but I dipped a few pieces of biscuit in it. I added it to my recipe box and will make it again. Oh, I do not like to cook and I found this rather easy. Give it a try!

Received RAVE reviews at home for this one.  Love how easy it is to make.  I use this with grands biscuits adding some melted butter, old bay, parm cheese and top if off with cheddar.  Then pour this gravy on top.... MMM MM!!!!

This was super easy to follow,  right on with step by step directions,  and works well if you are short on the amount of butter. I used 2 tsp. instead of 3 and it still turned out.

Made many times except I leave the butter out-I feel it's just as good without it. The fat in the pan from the sausage always seems enough. Thanks for sharing such a yummy comfort food!

This is the first time I made sausage & gravy and it was fantastic!  I used an apple chicken sausage because it's one I know my kids will eat.  It was amazingly good and so simple. Whatever sausage you use is what will give it flavor.  The rest is a basic white sauce.  You can play with it by adding different seasonings and trying different sausages.  Next time I may try it with a turkey mushroom sausage and add some white pepper.

This is the first gravy recipe I've ever tried and the one I keep coming back to. We alternate different types of sausage but so far we haven't found one we didn't like!

Whipped this up today for brunch, wow, incredible!  I would never have used the maple sausage on my own, but now I can’t imagine making my sausage gravy any other way.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I added to the recipe 1/4 chopped onion, 2 chopped cloves of garlic and sauteed and took out before adding the sausage. Also I've added to the milk about 1/2 tsp of "knor" beef mix and grated 1/2 nutmeg. This brought  it up to a higher notch.

I am not a big fan of sausage gravy, but my husband is, which is why I tried this recipe.  He loved it!  I tried it too and I have to admit, it was pretty good!  I didn't use maple sausage since we don't like things too terribly sweet, but maybe I will have to try that next time to compare flavors.  This goes great with Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits from this site!

I made this for dinner using Italian Sausage and it was very good. The flavor was great and we used it for biscuits and gravy.  Using the grease drippings from the sausage is what gave the gravy an amazing flavor that didn't need very much salt or pepper

This is a great simple recipe! I will make again. I did not have maple sausage, so I used jimmy Dean & squirted about a TBS of maple syrup into it during browing process to add the taste of sweet. I used 2% milk, to be a tad healthier..you would never know, I used fresh black pepper as well as a little white pepper. For biscuits, Bisquick is fast & easy, use a standard glass top as your cookie cutter & you have hot fresh biscuits when it's time to eat. THANKS for sharing!

This is pretty much the recipe my grandmother used for her biscuits and gravy and has been passed down for generations.  The only difference is she always used canned condensed milk instead of whole milk.  This is one recipe that is best cooked in a cast iron skillet if you have one as it helps intensify the flavor.

With todays super lean pork its imposible to make a good sausage gravy, as a result I've started to buy breakfast sausage from a local pig farmer and even his pork is lean!!!!! Oh how I wish for the olden days so this treat would rate a 5 star rating!!!

this is pretty much like the recipe i came up with except that I use fat free half and half instead of whole milk. Sometimes I add a pinch of sage too but that's my preference. One thing i do though that really makes a difference.,, but also makes it more fattening is that I fry the family's bacon in a cast iron pan and then add the sausage to the pan with the bacon grease. Adds so much flavor!

PLEASE make the recipe as stated for the flour and milk! VLLYBY1 knows what they are doing. If you don't it will have a raw flour taste. YUCK!! You can use the maple flavor, sage or regular flavored sausage. It's a personal preference. I like the regular flavored and I have to add the butter because the sausage I buy doesn't yield enough fat by itself. TERRIFIC recipe!! Thank you!

I add about 1 T. finely chopped onion to the pork, I use sage or just plain Bob Evans in the roll, I never have to use butter, just add flour to cooked sausage, salt and pepper,  and then the  milk, but this one is just as good, better than most restaurants, mine was from the old Frugal Gourmet recipe book.

Kudos to Bill for an AWESOME recipe!  About the only thing I did differently was susbstitute bacon fat for butter.  I will try it with the butter next time, but for now this will be the ONLY gravy I will make!!

Instead of taking my mom to a restaurant this Mother's Day, I decided to make her biscuits and gravy from scratch.  She couldn't believe I made it, and it couldn't have been easier!  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I used regualar sausage since I know she's not fond of maple flavored sausage.  It was so incredibly good and incredibly simple!

My first try making gravy and it was not only successful but super easy! I used Owen's hot sausage and the after taste was perfectly spicy for mine and my boyfriends taste buds. It took awhile to thicken but it was tasty!

Wow!  I felt like I was eating at my grandmother's house as a kid!  I followed the recipe except for I used 1 T of butter, and the 4 T of syrup.  That was amazing and it will now be my sausage gravy recipe!  Thank you!

I'm glad I found this.  Just as easy as buying the prepackaged stuff and much better.  I used 4 TBS butter because my sausage did not render much fat.  Followed the recipe exactly other than that, and we enjoyed a thick and creamy sausage gravy over JP's Big Daddy Biscuits.

I've been making gravy for years the way my mom showed me, which is mostly "eyeballing" it and using only the pan drippings.  The butter made this EXCELLENT and having more precise measurements meant no lumps.  This is the only way I will make gravy from now on!

Made this because my husband loves biscuits and gravy. I don't actually like sausage gravy normally but this was great! Hubby, kids, and I love this! Did everything in one pan and didn't remove sausage followed recipe exact and came out excellent and very easy too.

I used Bob Evans Sage Sausage and it tasted sooo good. Also I left the fried sausage in the skillet and added the butter and flour. I serve it with fried Yukon Gold potatoes and Grands biscuits. My husband loves this dish. It is a fast meal. I serve it for breakfast and also for supper with eggs and sausage patties on the side.  I always used the same ingredients, but I did not messure it out. Tastes also real good with Bob Evans Italian sausage.

This is the recipe I have used for years and I don't really measure anything anymore.  I usually use canned milk, it gives it a creamier flavor.  Delicious!

We use regular sausage, half and half instead of milk, no flour. It will thicken on it's own. The longer you simmer it, the better it tastes. Also can't forget the Lawrey's seasoned salt. We swear by it!

This is exactly how I make mine, BUT I don't use maple sausage, just mild or spicy sausage and for an extra 'yummy factor' I add one can crm. mushroom soup.  It makes it even more rich and delightful, my family has loved my sausage gravy and biscuits so much they've even requested it for dinner! :)

I love Sausage gravy its one of my favorite weekend breakfast treats. BUT I am really trying to cut down on fat so it made a few changes. 1. real butter is a must. 2. I used turkey sausage and added a dash of garlic powder and hot sauce and maple syrup ( gives it a sweet and spicy taste. 3. I used 1 c. chicken broth ( adds great flavor) and 2 c. 1%milk and a little extra flour to even it out. My husband who did not think he would like gravy and biscuits loved it.

This gravy deserves every five star rating it has received!!! Yum! I also use a smaller amount of sausage and split the final product and use half with the sausage (for biscuits and gravy) and half without the sausage for mashed potatoes.  Outstanding. I won't be using any other sausage gravy recipe again... EVER.

This is always a winner. We make it every Christmas for brunch and it's a hit. A word of advice, though...don't even attempt to cut the fat on this one, or the result will be gluey and not nearly as good.

I had some problems making this (not the recipe's fault) so I had to adapt and it STILL turned out fantastic.  First, there was no maple sausage at the grocery store. I bought sage sausage instead.  Secondly, there were almost NO drippings when the sausage was cooked. (What's up with that???) With no drippings, I had a dilemma. I added the butter directly to the crumbled sausage in the pan and cooked that for a little bit.  I then whisked together the milk and flour and added it directly to the pan.  Much to my surprise, the flavor and consistency still turned out great, easily the best sausage gravy I've ever made!  I'm really looking forward to trying this recipe as-written (which was my intention) but even with these alterations it was still easy and amazingly good.  Thanks!

I love this recipe. Since my father-in-law needs to watch his fat intake, I modified the recipe to cut a lot of the fat out.  I use turkey breakfast sausage and add a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup as the turkey sausage is cooking. You can add some dry sage if you like to kick it up a notch. I make sure to get the sausage nice and brown and then remove to a small bowl, leaving the drippings in the pan.  I add three tablespoons of Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend and melt, adding in the flour and whisking the roux for at least a minute to remove flour taste.  Instead of three cups of whole milk, I use two cups of Land 'O Lakes Fat Free half and half, and one cup of skim milk.  I add only the first cup of milk, whisk really well, then add the rest of the milk, seasoning well with salt and pepper. Now you've got all the taste without all the fat.  Totally yummy!

This recipe states it's for 4 people, so I tripled it for 12.  Big Mistake!  It would serve 12 people if it were your main course & eaten like soup!  I would try this recipe again by making it for 6 people when serving 12, since we only used it for biscuits.  Otherwise it was very simple & after adding lots of salt & pepper while cooking, it was fine.

You can make this same recipe with reduced-fat bulk sausage and fat-free milk to reduce calories.  Just don't skip the real butter! My favorite weekend breakfast!

Very good! I did add the butter since I used turkey sausage (doesn't render a lot of fat) and 2% milk. If you skip the step of browning the flour in the fat, by adding the milk and flour together as another reviewer suggested, it tends to taste a bit "doughy". Still good, but much better when followed as written.

I made with regular sausage and did everything else as stated in the recipe.  It was outstanding.  I live by Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen in Chapel Hill and this gravy blows theirs away.  I just wish I got off this dumb diet so I could have biscuits and gravy again.  Thanks, Bill.  It's a real keeper.

I, like a previous reviewer didn't have any fat from my Bob Evan's regular sausage (didn't have maple).  I added 5 tbls of butter (not margarine) instead of 3 as she did.  It turned out excellent...better than restaurants I've been in.  Everyone else loved it too...thanks for sharing!

This was okay. I didn't have the maple sausage so I used sage. It tasted too flour-y to me. I don't think my sausage had very much fat and that might have been a problem. It was just okay. I won't make it again.

This is perfect, as written.
Love the slight maple flavor too it. 
Be sure not to use biscuits that are too salty when serving.
I wish I could rate it ten stars because it is one thing every member of my family will always eat and love!

I love this, but I use 2 % milk and add about 1/2 cup finely chopped onions and 1 tsp worcestershire sauce.  I have found it doesn't matter what kind of biscuits, or what type of sausage you use.

Yummy yummy yummy......I really liked this.  I used this over chicken fried steak that I made for breakfast this morning.  I didn't put a lot of sausage in it because I didn't want it to overpower the Chicken fried Steak. I did add the Sausage to the rest if the gravey when we were done with breakfast. I plan on using it tomorrow over Biscuits.

YUMMY.  I didn't have the maple so I opted for regular old Bob Evan's sausage.  We all loved it. Don't think of skipping out on the REAL butter....hey this is no way a low fat meal so splurge and enjoy!  A few tablespoons of old brewed coffee makes this the exact Tennessee family recipe.  Gives it a woody flavor and great coloring like Bob Evan's.

I was not that impressed with this, I just thought it was kind of bland and the maple sausage just gave it a flavor that I didn't care for. I thought the gravy could have used more flavor. It just basically tasted like flour and milk to me.

My boyfriend loved it more than his own method of making sausage gravy--and his is fantastic. The only modification I made was to use Williams' hot country sausage. Thanks, Bill!

I Loooove sausage gravy, and I have to say this is a pretty good recipe, I added some sage and a couple of healthy dashes of fried chicken seasoning.  it helped tremendously.  I do beleive that the success of this recipes relies heavily on the sausage used.

I made this exactly as directed.  I was skeptical about the maple sausage and bought a package of sage just in case.  The maple sausage was great.  I love biscuits and gravy and can't believe how easy and delicious this recipe is.  I had to pass on the recipe to my sister who is also a B+G fan.

Yummie!! This gravy is delicious.. My mother has made her famous sausage gravy for years and I think this will give her a run for her money!! :) I also think it would be good with any kind of sausage that you prefer.. the only thing I would do different is add more salt and pepper the next time I make it, and I will make it again soon!!

This recipe is awesome, especially when made with the "breakfast sausage" recipe here at allrecipes (cooked loose instead of in patties). I know this recipe calls for maple sausage but I don't add maple to the sausage recipe and it is not missed. Serve it over the "JP's Big Daddy Biscuit" recipe and you won't be sorry. If I could give it all 6 stars, I would! Fantastic!!

My great grandmother made this gravy years before I was born .. and this has passed down thru the generations. 
Other variations are.. you can use any sausage that you prefer.. altho personally I like the sausage with sage. I've also used ham sausage it's just as good. 
Another use for the gravy is .. leave the sausage out completely and use bacon drippings ( don't we all have some we save )... anyway when completed use the gravy on boiled/fried poatatoes.. Yummy,,, for those of us that are short on milk another variation is use half water add alittle butter & garlic salt for flavor . We called it poor man's gravy then. It's just as good.

I have made sausage gravy most of my life but never tried it with maple sausage.  This was good but we really didn't like the sweet taste as well.  To get even more fattening we split our biscuits and spread with butter before topping with the sausage gravy, jist can't hep mysef!  At times I will add a couple poached eggs on top.

This was very good! I would have given a 5 star, but since the maple sausage was a bit too sweet for us next time I will use regular sausage or a spicy sausage! Then it will be a 5 star for sure!  I will for sure use this again! Thanks!

Excellent recipe!  I am new to cooking and have never made gravy before and this was SO EASY!  I used regular flavored sausage and unsalted butter and the gravy came out awesome!  I used to "cook" breakfast by treating everyone to Hardee's biscuits and gravy....not anymore!  I can cook these at home!  Thanks for the awesome recipe and easy to use directions.  It really helps a newbie in the kitchen like me.

Wonderful recipe! I made it for our youth group for breakfast and had two teenage boys say it was the best sausage gravy they had ever had. Quite a compliment! I took the few leftovers I had, added green beans and cheese and served it over biscuits last night for supper!

Excellent!  I didn't get to the store so I used what I had on hand...used regular sausage but added about 1/4 cup of maple syrup for the flavor and only had 2% milk to use but it still tasted great!  Also, I made homemade biscuits and it was a lot of work and not worth the taste...once they're smothered in gravy you can't tell the difference so next time I will get country biscuits from the store.  My husband loooooved this!!!

This was even better than "my" gravy! I used regular sausage and it still came out delicious! Was better with JP's Big Daddy Biscuits than with Bisquicks. At first, I thought it a bit much in continuing to cook after it thickened and I had added the browned sausage, but the flavor was so much better, so I think it did make a big difference.

Yum... this is soooo good!  The only change I made was making it with regular sausage instead of the maple.  There were no leftovers!

After eating ALL of this, my husband declared this the best breakfast -- ever!  I followed the recipe exactly, just adding a pinch of cayenne for contrast.  Took the easy route and just served over pop'em-fresh-from-the-oven buttermilk biscuits, although hubby said not to waste 'such delectable goodness on bread next time'... Thanks, Bill!

This was great but I live in the Southwest so I could not resist adding a small can of chopped green chili's, it added that extra kick that took it over the top and made it a 5 star breakfast

This is a very good recipe but I do think it would be better with just plain sausage or maybe hot.  The maple sausage was too sweet.  I like to make mine with plain sausage and top it with Crystal hot sauce!!!!

Just the best. I love it with the maple sausage. Only once have I messed this recipe up, by adding too much flour because I was worried the gravy wouldn't thicken. It takes time, but it does thicken up. I want to make this with organic maple ground sausage, if I can find it.

I don't eat sausage, but I made this for my husband and he really liked it a lot. This is a super easy dinner with Bisquick drop biscuits. I used a 16 oz package of spicy sausage, and upped the flour to 1/3 cup and the butter to 4 Tbsp. I kept the milk at 3 cups and it turned out fine. This was my first time making gravy so I was pleased that it was so easy to make without lumps, etc. 10 year old said that she liked it but also said it was a little spicy due to the sausage.

This was my first time making gravy.  I didn't know what to do when my sausage left no drippings.  I ended up going ahead with the recipe and adding very little beef broth and pepper to taste.  In the end it tasted good.

Awesome!  This was the first time I've tried to make biscuits and gravy from scratch, except the biscuits I used store bought too.  My husband loves it.  I couldn't find maple sausage at my grocery store but used spicy sausage & it was great.  Thanks!

This was absolutely to die for.  I used Hot Sausage instead of the Maple sausage and it gave just enough spice to it.  Way better than Bob Evans!!  I can't wait to eat my leftovers. :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe Bill.

We use this recipe all the time at our house.  It's not really my thing but my housemates LOVE it.  We usually put it on Grands Buttery Flaky biscuits and it's a hit.

Very good and easy.  I made it a little less fattening by using turkey sausage instead and it still turned out great!

Very good simple recipe. I put the sausage in the food processor and chopped it up before adding it back into the gravy. Then served over biscuits with scrambled eggs.

Our Favorite biscuits and gravy come from Brahms...till now! This was by far better and very easy to make (I could tell from the unusually tidy state my kitchen was left in!)

I doubled this recipe for dinner last night using a combination of Jimmy Dean maple and sage sausage. My gravy was a little thin, but I think that was my fault as I was in a hurry and my measurements may have been off. The taste was great and I plan to make this again when I need a quick meal for my family.

I used to make my own version of the gravy but after never making it the same I was advised by my wife to find and follow a recipe. This was the best and out of this world. Best sausage gravy recipe out there.

We used to make it with regular milk, but are now dairy free. Made for the first time today with Oatly oat milk and turned out great. We also don’t eat sausage or gluten so just make it with the butter, (Bob’s Mill Gluten Free) flour, (oat) milk, salt and pepper. But following his measurements works out well!

Can use any sausage with this recipe, I also didn't take the sausage out of the pan when it was done cooking; I just added the flour and butter and mixed those into the meat, then added the milk.

It needed a little help from my friend Cayenne Pepper.  Maple is optional in my opinion.  Especially if you use sweeter flavored biscuits.  Otherwise, great and easy recipe for breakfast.  Scaled up easily to feed 60 men.  Just don't leave the stirring to someone who gets distracted.

I've follow this sausage gravy recipe over 100 times the past few decades.   I don't look at the process as its too simple.   Sometimes I add garlic and crushed red pepper when I cook the sausage to change it up.   Also I've sub'ed bacon grease (1tbls) for butter.   Don't worry about getting all of the sausage out either, sometimes I'm just lazy and put the butter in the pan with sausage, toss the flour in blend it up and heat it till I see a slight browning of the flour and add the milk.

This is an amazing and simple recipe to consistently make great sausage gravy. I tweaked it a bit for personal taste by adding a bit more butter, some sage, and a dash of smoked paprika. I also stir in a little real maple syrup before simmering. My only regret is not having this recipe before.

We loved it!!! I used almond flour to make it lower carb and sage loose bulk sausage. Also, I added garlic and onion powders, parsley, salt and pepper. I also thickened it using Wondra as it cooked.

Didn’t like the maple sausage but it is good with regular sausage. Also no need to remove the sausage from the pan just put the flour right on top of the meat then proceed with the recipe as written

I liked this very much, but I think I needed to cook it a little longer as it did have a slight flour flavor.  That being said, the left overs were excellent the next day.  I will absolutely be making this again.

I made this recipe and followed it exactly. I wasn’t sure how it would turn out with maple sausage but it was surprisingly good and my kids enjoyed it. I served it over cheddar biscuits made with bacon fat.

Great tasting and easy peasy. I added sprinkling of parmesan chess on top..Kicked it up a notch.

I love this simple recipe! I do substitute a shot of bacon grease for the butter... Makes it a little harder to mix the milk into the flour mixture, but low heat, and adding the milk SLOWLY helps it all combine perfectly.  I have made this many times this way, and have yet to disappoint anyone.

I will be using this recipe again! My boys ate it up on Magnolia homemade biscuits. Personally, I like more gravy, I will add one more cup of milk and a little bit more- just slightly over one third of a cup since I use 1 to 2% milk.

Simple recipe. I didn't follow the sequence to the directions at all,  just cooked down the sausage. Once it was all cooked, I added the milk and flour. The resulting sauce was a tad thin, so I added about 1/8th cup of flour to thicken it up more.

Astonishingly simple. I used a full 16oz of ground sausage and added 3 Tbsp of maple syrup. Will make again.

I've made this a few times now and it is hands down the best sausage gravy recipe I've tried. When I don't have maple sausage on hand I just add some maple syrup to it. For some added flavor I also put in a little bit of sage and it 's divine!  Doesn't last long in our house!

The consistency was good. The flavor was ok. It's great over eggs.  However, we didn't care for the sweet maple flavor.  Next time I'll try making it with regular pork breakfast sausage, leave the sausage in the pan when I add the butter, flour, and seasonings.  Then when it's bubbly add the milk.

Excellent and simple. I will make this often now that I know how simple it is. Couldn’t eat all I made the first day, but I found reheated the next day was even better. I did have to add more milk the next day, but that’s part of the beauty of this gravy. You can make it as thick or thin as you want by varying the milk. Just keep stirring.

Hands down, our favorite sausage gravy recipe!  I use hot sausage instead of maple, but that’s the only change I make. It turns out perfect and delicious every single time!  Bonus: It’s just as good with 1% milk as with whole milk!

Great recipe. I like the maple sausage. But it is a tad too sweet.  If you add garlic powder and onion powder, it cuts down just enough on the sweetness to add a little savory taste as well.

This is a very easy recipe. I used 4 brats out of the casing instead of the sausage. I also also used skim milk instead of whole milk and added a dash of ground sage. I did not took for 12-15 minutes, more like 5 minutes because I am actually eating it the following day so I kept it thinner. It was very easy to warm up the next day in a pan and didn’t have to add any additional milk or flour. I personally think it tastes even better the next day!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now. I always follow the recipe almost exactly. Sometimes we don't have maple sausage available, but I definitely try to get that if possible. However, recently my daughter has become allergic to dairy. She was heartbroken because this is one of her favorite meals. I just finished making it with Silk (almond milk) replacing the whole milk. It turned out great! Next time I may try it with regular breakfast sausage since the Original Silk is a tad sweet. There were zero complaints from my family! Oh, did you know? Most margarines have dairy in them also :( but we've found a few that don't. This is a new chapter for our family, but we're making the best of it! Fantastic recipe! I wouldn't change a thing!

I personally really enjoyed this recipe. My children didn't like it until I put it on their homemade biscuits. Once all of the flavors came to together, they were in heaven! I followed it exactly as described using a cast iron skillet. Definitely saving for future reference! Thank you for sharing!

This gravy made a believer of my whole family who thought sausage gravy was white flavorless paste!  I added one white onion when I cooked off the sausage and did a mix of hot sausage and sage sausage.  It was easy to double it too!

Very nice idea. Good over other food like potatoes. I didn’t use the maple sausage either and don’t think it’s necessary. I replaced the butter with water for less greasy version.

This is an excellent, easy base recipe for sausage gravy. We've made it many times with variations. My family actually didn't like the maple flavor as much. We usually make it with Italian spiced sausage and add Italian seasoning to the gravy. 

Otherwise, we follow the instructions as stated and enjoy this recipe!

This was really quick and easy. The first time I made it, I followed the directions and used maple sausage and we didnt really care for it.  I made it again using plain breakfast sausage and the whole family loved it!

This is how I make my sausage gravy. Only differences I normally buy 2% milk so that's what I use in this recipe. If you really like Maple flavor try adding a teaspoon or so of 100% pure Maple syrup. It really takes it over the top!

I just made this for our meal today,  it is so yummy and easy to make!  I didn’t intend to change anything in regards to the recipe but since I only had sage sausage available it obviously replaced the maple sausage (which I will try in the future).

This is a really great recipe! I love the addition of the butter it gives it a more rich taste! I added Jane’s Krazy Mixed up salt instead of salt. It has several different herbs and spices in it and I use it and almost all my recipes. Kudos and thank you very much for this recipe!

I love this recipe. I followed these directions except I added bacon grease after adding the milk instead of salt. The bacon grease helps cut back the floury taste. I will be making this again.

I have made this many times always some variation of whole milk or heavy cream but this time, my new favorite, whipping cream. It comes in a two cup container so just add one cup water to dilute it a bit. 
The benefit? The gravy is creamier than whole milk and tastes better than both heavy cream and whole milk.

Very good southern gravy! Didn’t remove the sausage, added butter and a bit bacon grease to sausage in pan, sprinkled little more that 1/3 cup flour on meat, warmed milk then wisked it together. Yummmmo

Love this recipe. I really like the use of the maple sausage. Although, if I double the recipe, I will use one maple and one hot. I use the generic brand of butter biscuits to go with it, they are soooo good!

First time making this, my gravy making history hasn’t been good. This recipe and directions worked perfectly for me, it was delicious! I used fresh bulk sausage from a show pig we bought at the fair, so it wasn’t maple flavored. I used the Bisquick Drop Biscuit recipe on he box, which also turned out great. Thanks Bill!

So the taste was delicious, but I must have left it on too long because it was way too thick. I tried to add milk to salvage it, but it was too late. It was still delicious, though, but my husband didn't like the consistency. ALSO, all I had was regular sausage, so I added a small amount of maple syrup and it made it delicious!

I made it exactly as the instructions said to. We liked it very much! I am looking forward to switching the sausage to a moderate/spicy sausage.  

Thanks for a great recipe.  This is my go-to for gravy!

Delicious recipe as is but I did make a slight adjustment.  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and added some maple syrup to the mixture. I use whatever milk I have which is usually 1% and it turns out perfect!    Best sausage gravy you’ll ever have!!

This recipe is pretty amazing but I gave it 4 stars only b/c I never have enough fat drippings from the sausage alone, I always have to make bacon as well & use the fat from that to get enough.. Otherwise the recipe is perfect! I've added maple syrup to it a few times & that really amps up the deliciousness! Once I made it with lactose free milk for my boyfriend & it still tasted great!

I've made this several times and it's my go to sausage gravy recipe.  I think the key to this very tasty recipe is to not get into a rush.  Make sure the flour is lightly browned and tend the gravy, stirring occasionally after the milk is added.  My only changes are for personal taste.  I use regular breakfast sausage instead of the  maple and I add a dash of cayenne pepper.  It turns out SO GOOD!  Thanks!

This is the base for my go to recipe. I stick with the basics but my girlfriend is not a fan of maple, so I usually use original or sage sausage. I’ve tried with a few different brands as well and it’s always been a success. Everyone who has tried it really enjoyed it.

Delicious! Made exactly as written, except I had 2 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream on hand. That was my only substitute.

I added Cayenne pepper as recommended by KSCHAE above.  It took the recipe from good to great.

Good sausage gravy...though not exactly heart-healthy.  Used Jimmy Dean Sage sausage and pillsbury biscuits.

This gravy is the bomb.  I love the cayenne pepper in it, gives it a great flavor! We put ours over Biscuit cups (with eggs, sausage, cheese) it was amazing!

Classic. No complaints. Used the left overs on a few other things over the next two days, just added a bit of milk while reheating in a small pan to thin out of it had thickened too much while refrigerated.

Wonderful country gravy for a yummy breakfast. I've used this gravy in a biscuits n' gravy casserole, too. Spicy pork sausage or maple is delicious.

Butter. Is. The. Key.  

Very unhealthy dish but darn is it DELISH. I’ve made this for skeptics and they end up asking for seconds or taking leftovers home! I am a decent cook (when I want to cook, ha ha) so I just use my judgment on measurements. Good luck and hope you enjoy this recipe as much as our family does!

Made this for the first time. Turned out pretty good. Used a turkey sausage as I don't like the maple kind. Going to make this again. Made my own biscuits from a Basic Biscuit recipe on this site.

First time making sausage gravy (Christmas morning of course) and it got rave reviews.  Like someone else mentioned, no butter needed. Plenty of grease from the sausage. I used regular sausage but would use maple if I had it. Will definitely make again!

Fantastic recipe! Simple is best! I added a few things at the end. A touch of cayenne, sage, parsley, along with some salt and pepper of course. Easily the best sausage gravy I’ve ever made!

This made the best sausage gravy. I used sage breakfast sausage, since I don't like Maple flavored, but everything else was the same. I think the trick to the flatvor is to really make sure you let it simmer those 15 minutes after adding the sausage back to the pan. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was perfect, I halved the recipe because there are just a few of us. It was perfect sausage gravy goodness, I threw together some scratch drop biscuits also from allrecipes, some over easy eggs and bam! Perfect breakfast and really without deatroying my kitchen.  I will make this again.

We made it exactly as it says (except that the package of sausage I bought was 16 oz instead of 12) and it was a hit! We had it for dinner, and then we all slept soundly! LOL. I'll definitely make this again.

Made the recipe exactly as direction and it came out super duper perfect. Set aside to make the buscuits and then while warming added a bit of milk to make it more creamy. Added maple syrup into the gravy to give it more of that maple kick. Loved it!

This was a hit. Easy to make a delicious. I easily made it gluten free by substituting the flour with a gluten free pancake mix (what I had on hand). Made a double batch and had no leftovers!

Perfect gravy. I used fresh sausage from the local locker. I kept it a touch thicker since I used it in a casserole. Will definitely use this easy recipe again.

Easy and delish! I only had the regular breakfast sausage by jimmy dean and it still came out fab! I used the whole tube of sausage which is more than he calls for. It came out a bit too meaty because of that but that was my fault-didn’t want to waste the sausage.  The taste was still on point tho!

Great recipe, I did add salt and pepper and I used a sage flavored sausage... so I think this gave it a little extra flavor. My kids and spouse all thought it was delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Always loved biscuits and gravy and can finally make them at home! I’m a fan of sage sausage so made that swap and part of my milk was heavy whipping cream. Thanks Bill!

I made it with original Jimmy Dean sausage since my grocery store didn't have no maple sausage. It was really good. Very similar to the recipe I have used for years. I go heavy on fresh cracked pepper.

This is great as-is but I tinker leading to an end result that was a better fit for us.  I used regular Jimmy Dean, added garlic, onion, cumin and cayenne powder plus extra black pepper - the results are pretty tasty. Have made it several times and will continue to do so.

I really like this recipe. I've made it both as written, and with spicy sausage instead of maple sausage. Personally, I like my sausage gravy to have a little kick to it, so I prefer it with spicy sausage, but the maple sausage was also very good.

This recipe taught me how to make this style of gravy. I added bacon to mine and it was super delicious. You need to add a little more flour if you use extra meat (like adding bacon if you keep the full amount of sausage. )

It worked for me but I used a 12 oz great value maple flavored sausage patties and there was no “drippings.” Anybody have suggestions for that?

It needed something for flavor, I think I should have used a breakfast sausage with a little more something and that would have helped.

I have made this recipe many times. It is my go to for weekend breakfasts. I use regular breakfast sausage opposed to the maple flavored kind. My 1 and 3 year kids love it and we always have clean plates. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe. The only changes I made was instead of maple sausage I used premium sausage and my kids are usually picky eaters and they loved it. I also served it over buttermilk biscuits. I will definitely make it again.

Other than adding 2 pinches of cayenne, followed exactly.  Followed for 6 servings, and it served 4 perfectly.

Absolutely love it!! I use original Jimmy Dean sausage, 2% milk, and Jonnys instead of regular salt. Otherwise I follow the recipe to a T. Turns out thick and flavorful. Usually pour over Bisquick biscuits. Kid and mom approved! Of course it isn't the healthiest, but a nice treat every now and then and an easy dinner! I usually have everything on hand except the sausage so cheap to prepare as well!! Great way to use up milk in our house as we rarely finish a gallon. I'm also proud that I can now make homemade sausage gravy!!

Delicious!! Can take a lot of pepper for sure.  My BF is not a big gravy lover and he was raving about this recipe. Used sage sausage as the House is a little more savory than sweet and it was a big hit!  Definitely will be making this again.  Thank you!

This recipe was delicious. I’m super picky about breakfast gravy and this will absolutely be my go to recipe when I need my biscuits and gravy fix. I’m not a fan of maple so I just used regular breakfast sausage but kept everything else as written. Even my incredibly picky 8 year old devoured this. Soooo good!

Made it exactly how it was written.  Could not find Maple Sausage, so just used Jimmy Dean ground breakfast sausage. It was a big hit at the Firehouse..

My husband loves this gravy!  We use our own sausage that we make but I think any sausage would be great with this recipe. This is also the first successful gravy this former Yankee has been able to make.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious. I will never use the packaged country/peppered gravy mix again. This was so simple to make and I had all the ingredients in my pantry. I used a bit more pepper. Great for breakfast, lunch or supper.

Great recipe! I wasn't in the mood for maple sausage so instead went with original homestyle. I added a bit of salt, lots of pepper and a decent amount of Worcestershire sauce to the gravy before I added the sausage. The Worcestershire sauce really gave it a nice kick. The gravy was a hit...will definitely be making this again!

Delicious.  I used Jimmy Dean bulk sausage.  Makes enough for four hungry men!  Reheated for four minutes in microwave with a quarter cup of milk, stirring after each minute.  Delicious with 7-up biscuits (easy)!

Great recipe!  My husband, at 51, is now to where he's lactose intolerant, and we're cutting way back on meat (cholesterol), so I substituted to make this vegetarian (not vegan due to butter) and it worked!  I used Califia Farms Barista Blend milk (it's a lovely whole milk substitute) and crumbled Morningstar sausage patties (meatless).  I kept the butter since it's negligible at 3 tbsp for health and butter flavor is always fab.  We were super thrilled that it turned out great!

Great recipe. 

The only deviation was that I added about 1/2 teaspoon or so of cayenne pepper and it provided a nice zip.

My husband is a truck driver (for over 30 years), so needless to say... he has had many, many, biscuits and gravy dishes, all over the country.  He told me this is the best he's ever had.  The first words out of his mouth, were... "Oh, honey, you nailed it!" Trust me when I say, that is  huge compliment. 

I did not make any changes to the recipe, it was perfect the way it was.  I used Grand's Southern Style Biscuits. 

Thank you, Bill!!

The first time I ever had sausage gravy and biscuits was my first vacation down south and I hated it. My friend from Midwest raves about this recipe, swears by it, and told me I should try it one more time so I did and now I'm in love. I used a sage ground sausage and added maple syrup while cooking. I poured this over an egg in a basket and a homemade biscuit and within an hour it was all gone !

Even though I am a trained chef I have never made a gravy at home before that turned out good. This has turned out just the way it should. I’m very excited. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn’t use maple sausage because I had bulk sausage from a hog we processed a few months ago. But I imagine it would be delicious with the maple as well. Following the process is the most important thing and cooking out the flour taste.

This gravy recipe was AMAZING!  Just like I remember it when I was a kid.  Huge hit as a hangover breakfast after NYE with a house full of people!  Made biscuit dough and froze in advance for fresh biscuits to go along with the gravy.  So yummy.

This is the  real deal.  It works with maple or sage sausage.  I always serve with pepper on the table because I like mine with a bit more than the rest of my family.  This is always a winner!

I follow the recipe. I do use 2% and sometimes skim milk to lighten the calories. We never notice any difference in the taste. My family loves it!

The best gravy recipe ever. I do not use maple sausage and I usually add a pinch of season salt to it but other than that perfect exactly as written!! So good!

This recipe is fantastic! It works extremely well!  Be sure to taste test it as it cooks down to see if you need to add more salt and pepper, because that's definitely the key! It will turn out perfect, better than restaurant quality! Serve with the Kentucky Biscuits recipe and , breakfast is served!

Best sausage gravy I’ve had! I use a little less sausage and substitute 1 cup of the milk with cream. The maple sausage gives it an excellent flavor. I use the butter or honey butter tasting biscuits with it and make it every week. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was a good starter for me. It just wasn't enough gravy for us. I followed the recipe as stated but used country ground sausage, not maple. I then added a can of cream of potato, more milk and butter and some of our favorite spices. Majoram, thyme, sage, dash white pepper, garlic salt and parsley, black pepper, and garlic pepper. I added milk until it was the consistency I liked. Then let it simmer for 5 minutes. The best sausage gravy by far!

I've never been a huge fan of biscuits and gravy, but this recipe changed that. I've been using this recipe for four years and my only substitution is sage sausage instead of maple.

This was really good. I accidentally added too much flour and it got overly thick. I will not make this error again. Use the salt and pepper liberally for the best flavor

I had a Saturday morning craving and this turned out great. I didn't have maple sausage, so I improvised and used mild Italian sausage, removed the casing and added maple syrup while browning the sausage.  I n addition to the salt and pepper, I added a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce to kick it up a notch.

Outstanding!  Absolutely delicious!  I used regular breakfast sausage because that's what I had; however, I would like to try it with maple flavored.  I don't buy whole milk so I substituted evaporated milk  (12 oz. can) reconstituted with 12 oz. of water to get 3 cups. I use it for puddings and pies, too; makes them rich and velvetty. The gravy was rich and delicious and worth every calorie for a once-in-a-while splurge.  Added plenty of course black pepper and enjoyed with Sadie's Buttermilk Biscuits from this site.  I think next time I may add a little sauteed onion because I think it would be a good fit making it even more savory.

This is by far my favorite sausage gravy.  I have made it dozens of times and my picky family devours it every time.  Tonight, for the first time, I whisked the milk and flour together first.  It turned out exactly the same and was faster and easier.  Biscuits and gravy perfection here!

Just like my dad makes! This is such a good sausage gravy! I use 2% milk instead of whole and it actually has a better texture. Also, Neese's hot country sausage is the ONLY sausage worth using, in my opinion. I make this once a month for my Sunday school class and it is always a hit.

This was fantastic gravy.   I did not have whole milk so i used half 2% and half heavy cream. (I know..more calories and fat) I ran out of flour so i used  Kentucky Kernel seasoned flour.  I used Williams sausage. Followed how it was prepared  and oh so yummy!!!!!!!    Made some homemade biscuits and picked some fresh tomatoes and   wow, it just kept getting better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

First time making homemade gravy.  I made sure my milk was cold when added to pan to help with no lumps.  I also didn't have maple sausage, so I used Italian and used and put Cheyenne pepper for a nice kick. DE-LISH!

I tried this recipe today and it was the best ever, I followed the directions pretty much exact except I use 1/2  of the maple sausage and the other  1/2 with the zesty hot pork sausage, a perfect balance. It was phenomenal . Use the butter milk Grand  biscuits  Home run , The wife loved it :)

5 Big Stars all the way! You could eat an old boot with this on it and it would be delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe but used sage sausage instead. Everyone loves this one!  Give this one a try and you will be smiling all the way!

So easy and delicious, followed recipe as directed. Made with some frozen pillsbury country style biscuits, this will be a staple from now on. I will say this is not a recipe to make it you are trying to diet though, pretty fattening.

This was easy and good. I'd bought some currywurst at the farmer's market and wasn't sure what to do with it. Rather than follow the German recipes for currywurst found here, I tried this. I started with some sliced spring onion in the skillet before adding the sausage. I didn't have whole milk, so used 2 1/2 cups of 1% and 1/2 cup of half and half. The gravy worked out fine and picked up the savory flavors of the sausage. Served it over rice.

My husband really likes this gravy. He says a 4 out of 5 stars! ThTs really good for him! I am not a huge fan of sausage gravy due to I don't handle pork very well however, I did taste it and I'd say this is pretty darn good!

I use maple sausage links and cut them into bite size pieces. I never liked the bumpy feel of ground sausage. After adding milk and flour, try cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder ! if you really like spicy food, try fresh, minced habanero, maybe try it without the seeds first. :) For the measurements, it depends on the amount, I just eyeball it and always add more cayenne at the end.

I've tried sausage gravy where you make the gravy with just butter, and where you make it with just drippings. The best flavor is when you use both, which is what this recipe has you do. It might not be healthy but dang is it good!!

In my experience, maple sausage ruined the dish. Use original sausage and it's better.

This is a keeper although I make mine a little different first I use half regular or maple sausage and half hot sausage like jimmy dean.  Second I don't use the butter I just slowly add the flower to the sausage and grease. Great recipe thanks for sharing

I tried making this twice and both times it didn't turn out well at all. I had to throw it away. I don't know what I did wrong as I followed the original recipe, exactly. I had trouble when it came to melting the butter and adding the flour. It started to clump up. I waited to see if it would smooth out, but it didn't. I had to toss it away.

It's a great started recipe. I followed the directions exactly. It was good, although next time I'd cut back on the flour a bit more. Will definitely make it again.

A delicious and easy-to-make recipe. I used regular pork sausage as opposed to the maple sausage to have more of a savory taste. It was a big hit with me and my boyfriend!

Just a note.  You don't need to remove the sausage.  You really don't need the butter, but it's a good addition.  You can just sprinkle the flour over the sausage and stir in. The fat in the sausage will absorb the flour.  Then add the milk as called for and it will thicken perfectly.

Great recipe!
I added garlic and onion powder.   Also doubled the recipe. 
My coworkers loved it for our potluck breakfast!
I cooked it the night before and heated it up in the crockpot the next morning. 
Perfect.

This recipe was a hit! I followed instructions from a previous review of mixing the milk and flour together and just whisking it in with the cooked sausage.  I only used about 5T of butter. I used 2% milk, and chicken sausage. I also used lemon pepper instead of just black pepper. Delicious! This will be a recipe I will use forever. Thank you!

The only sausage I had was frozen turkey sausage. So I thawed it and used that. I was always afraid that gravy was too hard to make, but I now realize it is: Hot fat/oil then mix in flour until it thickens then mix in milk until you have enough gravy then stir until it thickens again. Then season it... pretty simple. And for all the teachers out there who always wanted your students to sum up what they learned after the lesson here it is. I was listening in class.

I love this !! This is my base recipe for sausage gray. I add 1/8 -1/4 minced onion (Real not dried) and 1 clove of garlic also minced. If you want to impress those relatives, fix this for breakfast!!

Solid recipe; nice and simple.  Used uncased, sage sausage meat.  Gave it a nice flavor, and was a little departure from the sweetness of the maple sausage.  Gives it a nice twist on a classic dish, although stick with the maple if you're looking for the original formula.

Perfect! Works with whatever sausage you prefer. I like basic but safe is good to. Would like to try with maple but haven't seen ground maple sausage at my grocery and I don't care to take it out of casings. I'm heavy with the pepper and use frozen biscuits. My kids eat so much of it which makes me happy because they are both built like birds.

Best gravy. Easy. I always have a hard time judging the thickness. It always seems too soupy but it's gets thicker. My crew likes flavor and spices so I leave it out and let each do their own.

I added a couple changes to this recipe but it is awesome! I use 1 pound of Bob Evans zesty sausage and 4 teaspoons of brown sugar. I add the brown sugar once the gravy begins to Thicken. You really get the sweet and heat with this one. You can always start with 2 teaspoons and add more sweet if you desire.

We didn't have maple sausage handy, so I used regular sausage.  Otherwise, made it  following the recipe exactly as presented, and it was delicious!!  Reminiscent of breakfasts I've enjoyed in southern diners!  And it was pretty easy to make!

This was really a good recipe and I think many others can be made based off of this. 

I am really bad at measuring stuff so I added milk as it thickened, and finished it to my liking. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give a bit extra kick. I used uncooked (not the precooked), mild sausage patties. Will definitely make it again, once my arteries have some time to clear out. ??

Fantastic Basic biscuits and gravy!  I used sage sausage as I prefer my gravy a bit more savory.  Added a heavy tablespoon of extra flour to thicken up the gravy and it was just like I think it should be.  Simple and delicious.

Quick, easy, and wonderful!!  I needed to make this for a crowd so I doubled the recipe, did not have the correct sausage so I used what I had, 12oz sage sausage and 12 oz of fully cooked links which I ground in a mini food processor.  I had ruined my breakfast casserole and had to think of something to make and fast!  MMMMmm, I love comfort food!!  Thank you AllRecipes for saving the day!!

Loved this recipe! I like my food well seasoned so I added rubbed sage, poultry seasoning, red pepper flakes, smoked paprika and garnished with parsley flakes and chipotle chili pepper. Even better with reindeer sausage, though that's a regional thing. Delicious!

Very good. My first shot at it worked out fine with Jimmy Dean Mild sausage. Not as good as my ex-mother-in-law cooked up every Christmas (God rest her soul!), but she had about 50 times more than I did to get it just right to her taste! Easy to do, and I will do this one again.

This is probably the best gravy I've ever had. The pepper was perfect and the consistency was perfect for smothering biscuits.

Made this at the request of my kids over Thanksgiving Break.  This was very easy to make and tasted fantastic.  Didn't change anything on the recipe.  The maple sausage was wonderful in the gravy mix.  This will definitely become a tradition at our house.  My kids are requesting it again for Christmas and even before.

My kids wanted to do breakfast for dinner so this was a part of that. It turned out wonderful. Next time I might add some chopped onions to it and saute that with the sausage. I didn't use maple sausage by request. Maybe I'll sneak it in there next time. My son put it over the biscuits but I put it over my eggs and hash browns. It was great over all of them.

I made it exactly as directed. It turned out fantastic. I cooked the sausage a little longer because I'm picky with meat so it had to be a lot darker. But it is soooo good. Boyfriend loved it too. Will definitely be making again.

The only changes I made were tom use hot country sausage, and I added enough vegetable oil to the sausage drippings to make a quarter cup.  The flavor was outstanding and the consistency was just right.  Great comfort food.

Super simple. It was my first ever attempt at making sausage gravy and I pulled it off in 15 minutes and it was quite tasty. Definitely will be my go to recipe. For those who like a thicker gravy, I only had half and half and it was thicker than I assume the milk would have been.

Delicious recipe! I like it with the maple sausage, but I much more prefer it with sage. I am also quite heavy handed with the black pepper. Recommend!

Easy smooth gravy with sausage.  Used country sausage instead, just a personal preference, but still tasted great!

Making it right now but since there are only two of us humans (discounting the tapeworm in the always hungry dog LOL) I have to halve the recipe so it should work out well.   My southern boy fiance grew up on biscuits and gravy so he's not all excited but I actually had a dream about them last night! so I'm making them this morning.  and use cornstarch instead of flour .    He can have his Chocolate Mini Wheats if he wants ....

Best sausage gravy ever! I make this on a monthly basis and use sage sausage instead and add a dash of cayenne because we like things with a kick in my house. This one is a keeper!

This was a very easy, but very delicious recipe. I used regular breakfast sausage because I didn't have maple sausage. This recipe is a definite keeper and I cant wait to try it next time with maple sausage.

We loved this, after I made it without the maple flavored sausage. It was just to sweet for us, so next time I made it i used different flavors.

I made this recipe for my family.  Having just returned from vacation in New Orleans I changed the recipe to be more like the sausage gravy from a restaurant called Oceania.  My husband and loved their Sausage gravy because it was very creamy.  I stead of 3cups of whole milk I used 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and  1 1/2 cups whole milk.  It made the recipe very creamy and almost identical to the gravy in New Orleans!   Everything else was exactly like the recipe!  My family loved it!

An awesome recipe, but be SURE you really like maple sausage! I had never had maple sausage in gravy so it was really overpowering for me.  However, with that being said, this is a wonderful gravy recipe!  Rich and smooth and just beautiful.  I'll definitely make again, but for my personal taste I'll use a sage sausage next time.

My whole life I thought I didn't like sausage gravy because my mother, bless her heart, wasn't the world's greatest cook. But this recipe changed my mind. I use regular sage breakfast sausage and I don't bother removing it from the pan before I add the butter and flour and use 2% milk; it thickens just fine. The key is lots and lots of fresh-ground pepper. When you think you've added enough, add more. I serve it over homemade sourdough biscuits (my great-grandmother's recipe) and it's the ultimate comfort food.

I used to order biscuits and gravy dishes all the time when dining out for breakfast and/or brunch but NOW that I've come across this recipe, neither my husband nor I are interested in having this anywhere but home!

I whip this up while I bake fresh biscuits.
Easy and incredibly scrumptious!

As mentored by other reviewers, the gravy was a bit bland.  Salt, black pepper and paprika helped.  I had to add quite a bit of milk to thin it out enough, so I might use a little less flour next time I make it.  A good homemade sausage gravy.

I've been searching for the perfect biscuits and gravy recipe for so long, and this is the one!  I made the recipe exactly how it's stated, and the results were fantastic!!  I used store-bought Pillsbury biscuits (Southern style), and it made it even easier to put everything together.  Quick, easy, savory, and delicious!

I followed the recipe except that I used Jimmy Dean regular sausage instead of maple, and my whole family flipped for this dish.  The only problem was that it didn't make enough.  I will double the recipe next time.

A-MAZING! I do use the breakfast sausage recipe found on this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/16359/breakfast-sausage/), and double the meat recipe for 2lbs of pork. I also add a bit of sage to the gravy recipe, for additional seasoning.

Whisk the flour into the milk, and add the combination to the drippings/butter. Stir constantly until it thickens up. I do keep a bit of thickening agent (either flour or corn starch) handy, to get it to the gravy-like consistency we like.  Excellent recipe!!!!

It was great! I will say it needed a bit more taste to it and moist but this was pretty simple!

Really good! I used turkey breakfast sausage and part half-and-half (just to use up some left over) with the milk and it turned out delicious.

Made it exactly like the recipe called for except I used 1% milk (we try to eat healthy...I thought this would be a good compromise). It was amazeballs! The hubs has celiacs, and I used store bought gluten free flour...it tasted just like the real thing. I made GF biscuits too. He was in heaven. And I agree on the maple flavored sausage being a must have. Thank yooouuuuu!!

Made it exactly as recipe stated, although I didn't have maple sausage. Just regular so I added a squirt of maple syrup lol. People stated it tasted like flour, maybe they aren't browning the flour enough so that really cooks in the flavor. And add the milk slowly while whisking, to be sure your getting all and any lumps out

Very good. I added extra milk as gravy does get thick but it was yummy! Used mild pork sausage from my butcher.

This was my first attempt at homemade gravy.  Tasted great but could have used more seasoning.  This is a great recipe for those who are not savvy in the kitchen.  Thanks Bill for making breakfast a hit this morning.

This is a good basic recipe. I prefer a little zing to my sausage gravy though so I substitute hot sausage.

Simple, easy and tastes great!  I used regular sausage and I did not add salt or pepper because the Farmland sausage tends to be very salty.  I would wait till the end to see if you need any so it isn't too salty.  *NOTE* follow the recipe and use the grease, that's where the flavor comes from.

The reason I love this site is finding recipes like this. I love this recipe and I made with mild sausage instead of maple. Reheats well, if too thick, add a splash of milk

This is my favorite base for a sausage gravy recipe. Realistically, I think the author went approximate with the flour and milk ammounts, because you pretty much add the flour until you have a nice roux, then cream/milk, until you get the consistency you want. But as far as bare-bones sausage gravy recipes go, this one's got it!

Yes, a hundred times yes!  I make this often and always enjoy it. FYI you can omit the sausage and just use butter.  Add lots of extra pepper to taste. Thanks for passing this along!

The only change I made was using plain breakfast sausage patties instead of maple, just because I dislike maple flavored sausage.  Everything else, I did exactly as written, and it turned out wonderful and easy with no surprises to catch me off guard.  I made it to top potato-leek hash, but it was fantastic a few days later on top of freshly made biscuits too.

Sometimes simple is best the way to go! Only thing I did different was use  1lb natural sausage. It's a keeper and will make aagain soon.

My wife and I thought this was fantastic.  We prefer a "typical" breakfast sausage, as opposed to a maple type.

Great recipe.  I double the batch and use half mild and half hot sausage (Tennessee Pride) and it tastes just like my grandma used to make

Even though I'm from the south, my mom never made this.  Made it last night for dinner and my husband (who's from Texas), gave the best compliment..."Awesome!!!  Almost as good as my mom's!!"  With a few minor exceptions, I followed the recipe exactly.  I had a one pound bulk package of mild sausage (not 12oz of maple).  It wasn't quite spicy enough so I added more pepper.   Great stuff and he took it to work for breakfast.  It re-heats very well when you add a splash of milk since it thickens much more overnight.

This is my go to breakfast gravy recipe any time we have family staying over. Always a big hit! I do cheat a little and use precooked turkey sausage crumbles (I don’t eat pork). To compensate, I up the butter quantity a tad. I also use 2% milk, and add pure maple syrup to the gravy just before putting the meat in to add that yummy sweet maple flavor. Super easy, and always tasty.

Love this recipe, I've made it a few times and it's always a hit with the husband.  The only thing I do different is I use 2% milk instead of whole and regular breakfast sausage not maple.  So good!

So yummy! We did everything the same except we only had 2% milk on hand so we added 2 1/2 cups rather than 3 cups.  It was perfect.  Served immediately it was great! We had a couple late comers to breakfast so I just needed to stir a tiny bit more milk in because the gravy got thick  while waiting.  It thinned it back up perfectly. Love this recipe!

I broke up all the sausage while cooking for maximum distribution of deliciousness.

The only change I made was accidental since I only had  regular  sausage.  I was never good at gravy but WOW!!!!!  We absolutely love this just the way it is.  Rich and flavorful.   To the person who thought this was bland, just add a little more S + P.  It's perfect!!  Thank you, Bill.  You are the master :)

Didn't use maple sausage (could have cost it a star), but not being one that was raised on this dish I enjoyed it.  First time making it so I will massage it next time a little.  Unfortunately my three kids have yet to appreciate this comfort food.  They will though... they will.  (insert evil laugh here)

I'm from the Midwest and grew up on homemade sausage gravy but could never get it to turn out right so had to go out for breakfast to get that stick to your ribs goodness. Now I live in the Northwest and gravy is very different here, so I avoid it at most restaurants. So have tried to make it on my own with no success. This is the first time I have been able to make my moms sausage gravy and it was fantastic...thank you!

This recipe was good. Simplistic ingredients, and easy to make. The only advice I can offer is to resist the temptation to use the entire chub of sausage. Most chubs are 16oz i.e. Jimmy Dean. I thought to myself...'just use the whole thing'....so I did. That was a mistake. It's just too much sausage, and what happens is the gravy seemingly gets absorbed into the meat, and you lose that nice velvety gravy flow spilling over your biscuits and running onto the plate.  Trust me, 12oz will be enough. Use your favorite variety of sausage i.e. maple, sage, original, and you will enjoy. I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to mine.

I didn't have any breakfast sausage, so I made the recipe without it. I used oil in place of the sausage grease. This gravy has the best flavor and goes great over chef John's buttermilk biscuits. I can't wait to make it WITH the breakfast sausage!

WOW! This is very, very good. I used Fresh Market breakfast sausage and it turned out perfectly. My husband said "this is just like my mom used to make!"

I used venison sausage that the hubby brought home. Used about 3/4 tsp of salt, a few dashes of pepper and added a tsp of sage. Was very good.

I didn't have any whole milk and I didn't have maple flavored sausage so I improvised and use regular breakfast sausage and evaporated milk and water.  This is delicious!  I did add the optional pinch of cayenne pepper as suggested.  Next time I will try it with the maple sausage.  YUM!

This is a great base recipe, and you can change it up with different flavored sausage or spices. I had 1% milk instead of whole and it still turned out yummy

Fantastic recipe! I prefer my sausage gravy a little spicy instead of sweet, so I use either hot sausage or regular with an added teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It is easy and comes out perfect everytime! Thanks Bill!

I love this recipe. I doubled everything but the sausage because I love a lot of gravy.  I also added a bit of seasoning salt. It was fantastic! I have made many times using sage sausage. I also used heavy cream. Not low calorie but soooo worth it!!!

I made this gravy with a few changes. I used gluten free all purpose flour and 2% milk and it tasted great and the texture was perfect. I did not change any of the measurements. So good.

This is a very good base recipe but came out pretty bland.  We spiced it up a lot using more pepper, seasoned salt, sage, garlic, and a little cayenne.  I don't like sweet meat so we used hot sausage instead of maple.  Will use again!

Good basic Sausage gravy !  It depends on the sausage if you want more spices ! Kroger sausage  is a bit lean for this add the butter and/ or some bacon grease to the roux .  It's a 5 star winner to cook the roux brown ( a true southern thing) I find it has a better flavor than a white creamy gravy .

One of my favorites for certain. The Maple sausage is a nice touch, but any breakfast sausage will work changing the taste of your gravy depending on the sausage. The type and brand of sausage you choose can make a big difference in taste or how spicy or bland your gravy turns out. Using butter in the recipe can be optional also, most sausage has ample grease to make a good gravy on it's own without adding butter. 
Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

I've been making this for over 40 years...the only thing I do differently is use spicy sausage for that little added kick to it. I also make home made cheddar garlic biscuits to serve it over...yummy.

I've made my gravy like this for years...but didn't think to brown the butter. Love this step as it deepens the flavor! We like things spicy in our house, so we also add a little cayenne. Yum!

I have made a lot of gravy, and if you are not health conscious , use bacon fat instead of butter , and I have found sage flavored sausage is better tasting than the maple . other than those changes , enjoy!

I think I've nailed this down at the firehouse.  1/4 cup butter (maybe a little more ;) 
1/4 cup flour 
2 cups milk, any
1 tube Sage breakfast sausage 
Salt
Black pepper
Crushed red pepper (a dash or two, don't go crazy)
Garlic powder (see above)
Slowly, melt butter and whisk in flour, then slowly whisk in milk. 
Brown meat at same time. 
Pour in browned meat,  simmer until thickened. 
BOOM!  Best sausage gravy, ever.

Mmmm that was sooo good!  Thank you Bill for this easy and tasty recipe.   This was my first time making any sausage gravy. I had the ingredients already.. sort of, I made lots of substitutions.  I used Evaporated Milk (1& 1/2 can or 16 oz)and 8 oz of water.  Baker's Corner found at Aldi is my new favorite brand.  I also had to sub some Garlic & Herb butter for regular.  Lastly I used Sage sausage.  Salt & Pepper to taste.  I read one review that said it was bland.  I don't think that was fair since WE do have some control over that.

I have used this recipe several times. It works beautifully. I use 1 pound of sausage and 1/3 cup flour. I've made it with all types of sausage it is always a hit. I'm using it again this week to make biscuits and gravy for 100 people.

This was totally AWESOME!!! I will definitely make this again. I did change it a little. I doubled the recipe and added a little more butter then they called for. I used regular sausage also, about a pound and a half when I doubled it.

Good if you like a lot of sausage in your gravy. I had to add a bit more flour because it was super thin otherwise.

This is a great recipe.  I took a suggestion from another review and skipped the step that has you remove the sausage from the pan, and it still came out perfectly.  Everyone who ate it thought it was delicious.

This recipe is great! The only change I made was using skinned brats for the sausage instead of maple breakfast sausage. I followed everything else and it turned out perfect!

I agree with a previous post that this made as is, is bland. I did not however use maple sausage but I doubt that would have made much of a difference. I did flavor my sausage with maple syrup as well as throw some in my gravy. I tried to season with S&P in layers but it didn't help. I added onion powder and red pepper flakes to the finished product, cooked it a bit longer, and it actually turned out quite tasty. I'm giving it 4 stars because the consistency is amazing and very creamy. It's a good base recipe, it just needs a little extra love.

Definitely good, but was a little bland. Of course, that's fixable.  I also tried Easy Sausage Gravy and Biscuits from  this site and preferred that one. Not sure why, since the recipes are similar...perhaps it was the sausage. Still, give this a whirl - it's highly rated for a reason.

Great recipe, thank you. I have a vegetarian in the house, so I made this vegetarian with veggie sausage crumbles. I also  added mushrooms and a bit of onion. The final product was a big hit!

I love the concept of this. The first time I made it, I did exactly as written, texture good, but bland. I made it again, I used Jimmy Dean's hot sausage. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper, and went a lot heavier on the regular pepper, very good!! I like spicy, but I will follow the basic recipe for the rue from now on, I love separating the sausage out and adding thee real butter and flour. If you don't like spicy don't add the cayenne.

This recipe is awesome! So awesome I want to make it all the time, but without all the calories (so I can actually EAT what I make).  That in mind - lo-cal version:  I substituted ground turkey sausage for the meat and 1% milk (with a little buttermilk) in place of the whole milk.  The flavor was still fantastic.  I have a food-snob family and they cleaned it up!

Great recipe for sausage gravy. The only difference is that is use regular sausage and reduce the milk to 2 cups, adding periodically during cooking. I also sift the flour in to keep it from clumping. Everyone I make this recipe for raves about it.

Definitely a breakfast favorite in my house. I add a little ground red pepper for a kick. I thought maple sausage was too sweet so I normally use original. Links or patties. Both come out amazing!

This is a great gravy that is simple to make and yet was a hit with the teen kid who I just got custody of. When he asked me the next day if I could make this again and knew we had a winner. I have made it several times and each time everyone loves it.

This was so good! I used breakfast sausage, so I added a little maple syrup. I also added a little habanero hot sauce and cayenne because we like quite a bit of kick. It was so easy to make and tasted so much better than any store bought gravy. I will be making this very often!

I've never followed a recipe to make gravy. My mama taught me how to make gravy when I was little. This gravy is fabulous. Don't tell mama, but it may be better than hers.  I didn't need to use all 3 cups of milk: you may want to just try a little at a time until you get the consistency you prefer. Oh I used spicy sausage and it worked great.

Love this recipe! I make the homemade Turkey Breakfast Sausage from this site and make it into this gravy - and serve over homemade cream biscuits. One of my family's favorite breakfasts for sure.

I live in Sweden and have never found sausage here. Today I made sausage. I made patties out of half of it and this gravy using the other half. It was amazing. My husband even liked it and he is not a gravy person. My sausage was not maple sausage but it worked well with this recipe. They only thing I did different was that I added cayenne pepper to mine and I used 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of milk only because I did not have enough milk on hand. Excellent recipe.

I made this recipe today and i must say it's a little strange for flavours. maybe that's because I'm British and never tasted it before plus i may have done something wrong somewhere but i did follow the recipe from American measurements to British measurements. or maybe try it again with different sausages. I did eat it all so can't be that bad :)

Next time I will salt after adding sausage back to gravy.  A little salty but that was my fault.  Kids loved it!

This is a great gravy recipe!  I make it all the time now and my whole family loves it, even my wife who isn't crazy about normal sausage gravy.  I tweaked my recipe by adding some sage and thyme, it really sets it off!

My husband is so happy I found this recipe.  I've made it twice.  The first time I seasoned as it says, before adding the sausage.  It turned out a bit peppery for my liking.  The next time I added seasoning after sausage so I could better gauge what was needed.  Really a nice, easy recipe.  Well done.

Wow this recipe is amazing!! This has replaced our local biscuits & gravy go-to restaurant. We use 16 oz of Jimmy Dean's Hot sausage, and fat-free milk. Im iffy about spicy foods, but all the milk and butter counteract the hot sausage and it just has a nice zip to it when all is said and done. We serve this over my grandmother's biscuit recipe and have leftovers for lunch the same day!

I used sage sausage because I don't like maple flavored.  I tripled the recipe and there was enough sausage grease that I only needed to add about one tablespoon of butter.  I liked it much better than the recipe that I have been using for years.

I have made biscuits and gravy for years!  I never knew there was an actual recipe for it though.  I use regular sausage instead of the maple flavor and I don't add the butter, I just use the fat in the pan from browning the sausage.  Cook it up sprinkle flour evenly over the top and then start stirring in milk until well blended, I just eyeball it.  Once it heats up it starts to thicken up.  If it gets too thick I just add more milk; too thin and I let it bubble for a few minutes and it thickens right up.  I play with it until I get the consistency I want.  Easy-peasy!  I always serve with scrambled eggs.  We pour the gravy over the biscuits and over the scrambled eggs too!  YUM!

Made recipe as written except I don't like maple flavored sausage so I stuck with regular Neese's brand. It was delicious; I was a little heavy handed on the salt so added extra pepper and milk to even out the flavor.  Next time I'm going to use Neese's Hot country sausage. Will definitely make again... thanks Bill!

My husband loved your gravy! I thought it was good but felt it was missing something. I made it as directed. The next time I will try it with regular sausage instead of maple. That may have made the difference for me. Thank you for this recipe!

I love sausage gravy...but easier way to make it....brown sausage well..prefer country style...when cooked well, add the flour to the sausage and continue to brown for a minute or so....add cold water to your flour/sausage...stir...thickens...then add 1 can of can milk...lots of pepper/ and salt to taste....

I changed the maple sausage to Italian sausage and chorizo.  Preferred the Italian.

This recipe works well with any preference of sausage.

This is a good basic recipe for sausage gravy.  I saute some chopped onion and bell pepper with the sausage.  Use the spicy sausage or add crushed red pepper for a bit of a kick.  Also I add a little shredded sharp cheddar after gravy is thickened once in awhile just for a change up.  My greatgrandaughter loves this and she's only 4.

Great recipe ... As others say works with almost any sausage... For a treat, add 1/4 cup of sake or vermouth (I prefer sake).  Great flavor option.

I tried this and added 1tsp red pepper flake, 1 tbs sage and it was PERFECT!! I never tried this with maple sausage but love it so why not!! They say you cant trust a skinny chef and I definatly have several extra pounds to carry after 38 years as a chef so believe me when I say this will impress anyone!

I have been using a similar recipe for the last several years except I use Hot Italian Sausage.  Brown it slow to retain the fat for the gravy.  Sometimes I like to add some chopped jalapenos....we like it hot in Texas!

This is a fantastic recipe as it is. The only thing I add is a pinch of rubbed sage and it's outstanding every time. Sage is an herb I add to any ground pork, chicken or turkey to give it a breakfast sausage flavor. if you try it in meat it's more flavorful to let it sit overnight with other seasonings: salt, pepper and a touch of maple syrup.

This IS a good recipe! To those commenting on the flour taste; you're not sautéing the flour and fat from the sausage (no butter needed) long enough to cook out the raw flour taste. I used plain sausage, not maple flavored ( don't care for the taste), added a little sage, and let it simmer until the consistency we like.

The gravy was extremely bland. It was basically just milk and sausage--no real flavor there. The gravy never got that thick for me either.

We use just a regular breakfast sausage - not one with a particular seasoning to it - and this turns out very nicely - we do add a bit more salt once it is cooked through though.

Very good recipe, my kids loved it. I'd been making something like this for years with regular breakfast sausage but the maple sausage adds something extra to it.

Wanted a breakfast gravy recipe for Easter morning.  Loved this!! Not a maple fan so used sage pork sausage and 2% milk.  Definitely will make again.

Delish! I also save time by mixing the flour right into the browned sausage and cooking it for a couple minutes - then just pour in the milk and heat until thickened. I don't add the butter.

So easy & delicious!  I used regular sausage instead of maple since that is what I had on hand, served on refrigerator biscuits for a quick and satisfying breakfast.  Definitely recommend this recipe.

I have been making this FOREVER I learned the recipe originally from my mom and who learned it from her mom. It is simple, warm and for me as comforting as comfort food gets. I had never thought to use maple but it was great. A must try!

Good standard recipe but I don't remove the sausage from the skillet.  Just move your sausage to the edges of the skillet and make your gravy in the center of the pan.  Add a little cayenne to spice it up.

This is the recipe I have used forever. Accept the maple sausage but we love maple sausage so it works great. No other spices needed for country sausage gravy, it would taste weird especially over biscuits. Great like it is. But any sausage works if maple is not your thing. Brown sugar sausage is great too.

I have made sausage gravy for years, basically same recipe as Bill's.
I use Tenn Pride or Jimmy Dean bulk sausage.  I do not take the sausage out of skillet when browned (saves a step). I add the flour, mix well, and then the milk.  Stir until consistency you desire.  Is great with Mary B's biscuits (in frozen foods), dash of hot sauce and hash browns.

We are trying for cutting out processed food and used this recipe instead of a packet. I also used whole wheat flour and all natural sausage and 1% milk. Served with homemade whole wheat biscuits. Still fattening, but not processed like I used to do it!

This recipe was a good starting point for me, but if I made it just the way the recipe said, we wouldn't have enjoyed it very much. I accidentally used a pan that was larger than needed so I ended up adding quite a bit more milk than this called for. Once I got the white gravy the way I wanted it, I added lots of a pepper spice mix (Wildtree's Rancher Steak Rub) that I have in a spice grinder, garlic powder and seasoning salt. Even with all the pepper mix I added we thought it could have used a bit more. We just aren't bland food people so I'm glad I added more spices to it, but it was still so much better than anything we'd get eating out - we loved it!

Made this for a Mother's Day brunch party at my home. Everyone loved it. Went quick!
I used regular sausage and added a pinch of cayan for added interest.
Kept it in a crockpot on low to keep it warm and delicious.

This recipe is AMAZ! Used skim milk instead of whole, and used country sausage in place of maple sausage. I just added maple syrup as the sauce thickened as some reviewers suggested. Don't forget to add lots of pepper, it takes this recipe to the next level.

Believe it or not, I made a vegetarian version of this with Morning Star farms sausage patties.  I used olive oil instead of sausage grease then I cut up the fake sausage into chunks... it was gone within minutes at my church coffee hour.

I made this for my husband and kids. They, as well as I, loved it.  I used Jimmy Deans original for the sausage and Grands Southern style biscuits. We eat our biscuits and gravy with lightly salted Roma tomato slices. This recipe made enough for a family of four to have two biscuits per person. When I cooked my sausage, I let it burn just a bit before setting aside. This left little bits of sausage that flavored the gravy and gave it that brown color. Mmmmm...

This is a winner; simple down-home comfort food. I have tried other recipes that failed, but this is flawless!  I didn't have milk on hand, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add canned evaporated milk and some water. It turned out beautifully!  Thanks to Bill and all other reviewers who share helpful tips like that. Enjoy your gravy!

I enjoy this recipe. It is your basic gravy with plenty of room for personal flare. I've used regular as well as spicy breakfast sausage and I add a few extra spices and a little bit more flour to thicken it up more. The family loves it, I never have leftovers.

Made it for the first time. The gravy itself was a lil creamy (which i loved) could have gone without the maple sausage. Next time I plan on using regular sausage.

We liked it, and the maple flavor is nice for a change, but I wouldn't use this recipe for every biscuit 'n gravy breakfast. Next time, I'll try it with regular breakfast sausage.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it turned out fantastic! My husband loves it and requests it at least once a month now. The recipe is easy to follow and turns out just as promised! This is a keeper. I found that using sausage patties works much better than links.

This is good but I didn't think the maple flavored sausage had that much flavor to it.  It seems original TN Pride sausage has more depth to its flavor so I think I will continue using it (either mild and/or hot) but this is fine too.  Thanks for sharing.

My entire life I've used packaged gravy until this morning. This recipe is easy and delicious. And of course I had all the ingredients on hand...I had no idea! I will never serve non-homemade gravy again! I used 1% milk and it turned out just fine.

This is very easy to make and is ready as soon as you can bake up some southern style frozen biscuits! Add a little tabasco on top and you're all set. (I use other types of sausage, as I am not a huge maple fan, but it's still great.) Thanks Bill!

Yummy!  I made this with 1% milk (because it's all I had), and this gravy is still so rich and wonderful.  Also, the only sausage I could find at the store was 16 oz. instead of 12, so I used it all.  I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight.  :)  This will definitely be a gravy recipe I use over and over again.  Gosh, I'm hungry now!

This is my go-to sausage gravy recipe. I've been using it for years. It always turn out perfect! I usually end up adding more milk toward the end, but that's just because I simmer the gravy a bit longer, so it needs thinned out.

I fixed this last night for dinner for my husband and I. It was delicious!! The only thing I changed in this recipe was the milk. I used 2% milk instead of Vitamin D milk.  And I didn't use maple sausage. I used mild pork sausage. The only reason I didn't use the maple sausage is because I already had the mild pork sausage in my fridge. The next I make this I am going to try it with the maple sausage.  Excellent recipe!! And very easy too!!

I thought this was the most flavorful gravy I've ever made. My issue was, that paired with bisquick biscuits, it seemed really heavy. I know it's biscuits and gravy.... But it may have been the biscuit being too dense. I'm not a fan of bisquick, but thats all i had.I will try next time with canned biscuit dough, which I love, say what you will... But I will see if that makes it even better.

It was very good but tweaked it by using fat free half and half, 1/2 cup of black coffee, 1 lb sausage, 1/2 tsp each of parsely and sage.  Will try with regular pork sasuage next time just to see the difference in taste.

The reason some of you are getting a floury tasting gravy, is because you aren't allowing the flour and grease (roux) to cook enough. The recipe says "until smooth." From personal experience, any kind of roux should be cooked until it resembles the texture of sand, (for white gravy, without allowing it to brown). If it starts to brown, add the milk immediately. If you do this, it wont have a floury taste.

This was the first time making sausage gravy and it was delicious.  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage because it's what was on hand.  It was even better 2 days later.  This was a trial run for my soon to be DIL and I can't wait to serve it to her.  Served with 7 Up Biscuits from this site.

Nice flavor and pretty easy to make. Made exactly as stated but did use white pepper instead if black, mostly just for looks. My daughter even told me it is better than her grandpa's so this was a nice compliment. Will be making again  soon

We loved this gravy!  Having enough fat and/or butter is the key to getting the flour to smooth out.  We didn't have whole milk so I used a little over 2 cups of 2%.  The consistency was perfect and tasted fantastic.

This is an amazing recipe.  Easy too.  I made this with maple sausage and it was to die for!  I also served them over J.P.s Big Daddy Biscuits and you can't get any better than that.

This is the first time I've ever made biscuits & gravy.  This recipe was super easy and pleased the whole family.  I used a little less sausage mostly because I don't care for sausage, but I love the flavor of sausage!

Delicious!! I only had the reduced fat sausage on hand and was worried it might not have produced enough drippings. But it worked great! And I used fat-free milk (again, the only thing in the fridge) and it still turned out thick and creamy. My son LOVED it!!

I adapted this recipe a little. I used chicken(which i had boiled and shredded the night before for another recipe and had some left over.) and added chopped green pepper and onion. It was delicious! A wonderful white gravy starter that can be adapted for any occasion!!

This recipe by itself is not too bad, but definitely not what I was expecting. It definitely needs more than just salt and pepper, but if you like simple but pretty good, this will work.

I like my gravy especially thick, so I typically add more flour and just a little more milk. I also add in a  lot of ground black pepper. When cooking the sausage, I season with garlic, pepper, creole, and a little bit of cayenne (I like it hot). 

Not bad, but could be better.

This was my first time making sausage gravy, and I loved it!!! I cut the sausage into bite size pieces before cooking that way I could leave them in the pan the whole time and just added everything else. Super simple and oh so yummy!!!!

When I made this , I didn't have maple sausage, so I used sage sausage and it was still very good.It is bland but that is okay, you can put as much spice as you like. I would make it again.

My wife is Southern & I lived down South for a number of years, Sausage n' Bisquits is one of my favorite Breakfasts. Bills Sausage Gravy recipe is fantastic, I highly recommend it. My whole family loves it. I did not change a thing, following the directions to a T. Very good & I highly recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of fare.

I tried this recipe and I must have added too much milk. It didn't thicken up like it  should have, but the flavor was out of this world. It's already in the recipe box. All I have to say is "YUM YUM YUM"!

This is a standard in our home now.  If you think it's lacking in flavor - I HIGHLY suggest you don't use maple sausage - Savory Sage is the way to go.  Or if you want it really spicy - chorizo.

Hey guys! I made this gravy using Jimmy Dean's mild sausage and it was EXCELLENT!!! My bf likes gravy a bit thicker so I made mine using the metrics posted and added 1/3 cup more flour to make it thicker for him. Overall, it was delicious and it has definitely become one of my favorite recipes. Great for a beginner cook, just like me!

I always use a pound of sausage.  Sometimes use half & half and skim milk, have tried all different flavors of sausage (maple, sage, spicy).  Serve over Pillsbury Grands with sunnyside eggs.  Crowd pleaser every time.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was a very filling and tasty meal! I followed the directions exactly except for making less to accommodate two people and using about half of the sausage required to go in the gravy so that we could have the other on the side.

Perfect except, I would change the sausage from maple, as I think the sweetness just isn't quite perfect.  We actually prefer the spicy hot sausage or just the regular flavor with this.  No contest on the gravy though -- it's the way to go!

Want to send this over the top? Substitute milk with heavy cream. The recipe stands alone in it's greatness though. Using the heavy cream just means there won't be any left over to freeze for later use.

My family couldn't get enough of this!  They were eating it out of the pan with a spoon...  They even said it was better than that famous Bob guy who has that chain of restaurants!!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe multiple times and it comes out perfect everytime.  Excellent recipe!  We don't drink whole milk so I use skim milk and it still comes out perfectly.  Also, I like to use Jimmy Dean Hot sausage to give it a little spice.  YUMMMMMMMY!!

We just made this. :) It's pretty much exactly how I make it. I'll use lard instead of butter sometimes and it comes out similar.   You can also swap out sausage with bacon. Use half of the bacon grease, as there will be a lot, and no need to add extra butter. It'll be plenty and tastes yummy!  I also used maple sausage when I made this one. :)  My family is weird, we put ketchup on top of our gravy and biscuits. We also call the concoction "bookie". Maybe it was a Kentucky thing!

Really good! I have never made this with butter before, and thought it would be sinful, but it does add another dimension. I did not use maple sausage so in order to provide some flavor other than the salt and pepper, I added a dash of cayenne and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Perfect!

Pretty good stuff!  My husband made this for an Easter Brunch we had with family.  We served it over homebaked 'english muffin' bread... it was very good.  We did remove some of the sausage fat, there was just SO MUCH and added a little butter.  You do need A LOT OF SALT AND PEPPER for this recipe!!!  We also used some garlic salt.

I made this gravy over homemade biscuits and got rave reviews. I changed it a little by using a full 16 oz of mild rolled sausage and 2% milk. My family loved it and I will definetly be making this again!!!

Ok, I know everybody thinks that their sausage gravy is all that, but this one really, really was!!!! I have NEVER been a fan of sausage gravy, but I made this for my hubby and his brother a couple of weeks ago and oh my goodness I was  just about licking the pan myself!!! I'm making it tonight for dinner..lol. This is great just the way it is. I made absolutely no changes and I'm always changing stuff up a bit. So fattening, but soooo delicious!!

LOVE this recipe!  I use it any time we have company and everyone loves it.  I recommend adding a little more milk... it tends to be too thick.  I've also used fat free half and half or whipping cream... whatever I have on hand.  I also use maple flavored sausage... yummy!

My husband said this was "the best gravy ever made."  It was easy, didn't take long to make, and any milk will do--I use skim, and any sausage as well--I use hot sausage.  Happy proclaimed to be a family "do-over."

Very good!  The only change I made was that I used 2 lbs. of turkey sausage (not to make it healthier purposefully, that's just what I had on hand)...but I did use WHOLE MILK-fresh from the bulk tank in the milk house.  Very very tasty with homemade baking powder biscuits!

I made this yesterday for some friends, and it was a hit. I made a 20 serving batch, which I thought would complicate things, but it came out fine. I did change a few things, I used half maple sausage, and half habanero sausage. I also used fresh cracked mixed peppercorns instead of standard black table pepper. I never use regular pepper in gravies or sauces, the mixed is far better. Everyone loved it. This was the first time making sausage gravy, but this is the only recipe I'll need. Thanks Bil.

LOVE IT.  Sausage Gravy and Biscuits has always been our Christmas Breakfast.  I couldn't find my mom's recipe, so I tried this one.  I think she was offended at first, but now she uses 'Bill's' too.  We don't always use maple sausage--sometimes we use sage or country sausage.  We've even done it with turkey sausage.  Always perfect!

Best GRAVY EVER!! I make this all the time, and everyone who has had it loves it, I do a few tweaks though. I Use spicy or hot sausage this eliminated the need to use salt and pepper, it comes out with plenty of flavor also i use 2% milk, and it works fine..

This is a great tasting and easy recipe. I tried it with regular sausage and the maple sausage and thought the maple had a better flavor. Made homemade biscuits to. WOW ! what a great breakfast. Thanks Bill

I used veggie sausage and inspite of whole wheat flour and fat free milk , the gravy was gobbled by all at home. Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe.

I love biscuits and gravy for brunch, and this gravy along with JP's Big Daddy Biscuits are my favorite.  As good as or better than any restaurant I've been to!

Great idea using maple flavored sausage, Bill. I'd never tried that before, but loved it! I have always added a little oil to the drippings, but I like the butter flavor better. Thanks!

This is a new breakfast staple in our family. Many years of Denny's and Bob Evans while traveling convinced me to try Bill's recipie. My wife and boys, ever the critics, were happily impressed.

I grew up in the south and loved Biscuits and Gravy but always thought "too complicated to make!"  Was I wrong... thanks to Bills Recipe!!  These are the most simple and DELICIOUS biscuits and gravy.  Easily doubled for a crowd and everyone asks for the recipe!! Follow the recipe exactly.  I have used maple and regular sausage.  Both are Terrific!!

Oh yum!  I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast, since he requested biscuits and gravy.  Now, I'm a southern girl, so I don't usually even use a recipe for biscuits and gravy, but I wanted something a little different.  While we could feel our arteries clogging with every bite, this was DELICIOUS.  Hands down the very best sausage gravy I have ever made.  Even our one year old couldn't get enough.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

The gravy is good for anyone who likes sweet. It has a nice consistency and is good but just a little sweet for me, however, everyone else thought it was good.

Not a huge fan of sausage so I went looking for a gravy that used bacon but did not find one.  I decided to make this one using bacon.   I fried about half a package of bacon and set aside the actual bacon.  I poured 3/4ths of the bacon grease into a tin leaving the remaining one third in the pan. I then followed the recipe exactly as noted except for I crumbled the bacon into the gravy when the recipe called to stir in sausage.  I then added more bacon grease as needed for flavor.  My boyfriend loved it and I agree it was good.  Next time i am going to try maple flavored bacon.

This is essentially the same as the recipe I've used for years, except I omit the butter to avoid the extra fat and you don't really have to remove the sausage.  Just mix in flour with sausage once the sausage is completely cooked.  Stir around completely until sausage is completely coated and all grease is soaked up.  Then, add milk, sage, black pepper, and cayenne pepper and cook until thickness you desire is achieved.  If not enough gravy, add more milk and continue cooking until thickness is achieved and pour over hot biscuits or toast (SOS).  Excellent.

No need to keep searching for any other sausage gravy because this is the best hands down. I doubled the recipe. My husband is lactose intolerant so i used Whole Lactaid milk except that i only used 4 cups instead of the 6 cups of milk that the recipe called for ( low lactose milk usually doesn't thicken in sauces) and it came out great. Nice and creamy no one could tell that it was done with lactaid milk.Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Excellent! I live in the Northeast so it's not so easy to get biscuits and gravy up here. This was delicious! I halved the recipe to make for 2 and it was perfect. Made just enough for 3 biscuits. Cooking time was about in half as well.

This was a simple recipe but it has absolutely no taste, I had to doctor the recipe to try to make it taste like a sausage gravy instead of flour and milk. I'll keep searching for a better one.

This is so good! And I was surprised at how easy it was! We've tried it several times with different flavors of sausage. Maple is sitll my favorite, but its pretty good with a spicy sausage too (if you don't mind the gravy truning orange from the grease).

Thanks for the reminder to eat this more often!  Sausage gravy is usually a no-brainer, but the Maple sausage is a great twist.

I gave this five star, this is exactly how I make mine, and it is fantastic, my husband likes me to add cooked bacon too. reminds him of Bobs Big Boy but better. A basic white sauce like this is so versatile. I use it as a base for cream soups,gravies, and even pot pies.

Thank you so much for the great instructions!  The maple sausage is wonderful.  My family has teased me for years saying that I didn't have the "gravy gene" due to my complete inablility to make homemade gravy.  (Which is practically a sin in the south!)  My gravy turned out perfect!

Loved it! I couldn't find maple flavored sausage so I used regular sausage. I thought I had maple syrup already but I was wrong. So, I used a little bit of pancake syrup in the gravy. Served with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits.

This was my first time making gravy, and it was so easy and delicious! I didn't even make the sausage with it and it still turned out great. Though I was raised eating my mawmaw's gravy made with lard, truly the best ever, I am still giving this recipe five stars. I have experimented with numberous recipes that require lard, either replacing it or leaving it out since I stopped eating any kind of pork many years ago. I cook only kosher foods now. For recipes that require lard, it's hard to get them to turn out the same, but this was great!

I've made this recipe way too many times.  It's become my go-to breakfast gravy.  Yes, you can use whatever sausage or milk you want, but I like it best as posted.  (I can't find maple sausage where I live any longer but when I'm back East, this is what I make my hosts for breakfast at least once a visit.)  Commit this recipe to memory.

Soooo good!  And soooo easy!  We make this just about every weekend now.  If you add a little minced garlic and finely chopped onion to the sausage - it's divine!  Adds a bit more complexity to the gravy taste.  As per Paula Deen, also subbed out 1 cup of the milk (2%) and used 1 cup half and half.

really good gravy!  My husband ate this whole batch in one day.  I used regular sausage and added 1 tablespoon of maple syrup after the gravy thickend.  I also used 2% milk and still got a nice thick consistency.  My husband thanks you Bill!

This gravy is really good; I've made it before and I like to add a bit of sage or poultry seasoning a dash of cayenne pepper, and a dash of nutmeg to the milk/flour mixture.  I didn't need to add the butter because I had enough pan drippings.  Thanks!

This is really good!  I used cheap sausage and had a lot of grease left over in the pan so I poured most of it off and used the 3 tablespoons of butter as instructed.

Easy, Easy to make.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of 1% Milk, it was creamy, and delicious.  I froze the leftovers and can't wait to have it again.  White and creamy.

Just like Mom used to make.  I did omit the butter and put the flour right in with the sausage instead of taking it out to make the gravy; and I only used 2 1/2 cups of the milk. Thanks so much for posting this!!!

I never thought I'd be able to make gravy, but this was a hit! Very, very good. My husband loved it, and it made alot of gravy, so there was plenty leftover. It reheated well.

My boyfriend is gonna freak out when he tastes this!  It's an awesome recipe and so easy.  I chose reduced fat sausage and I know you could use skim milk, too for a reduced fat option.

This is definitely the better gravy recipe. I have been making gravy like this since I was a child, being from the south. If you don't let the flour brown it will not have much flavor. Thank you for adding that tip

The taste is great, but I only gave it 4 stars because it took too long to make it.  Perhaps is was just me or my pan or my stove, but it took almost an hour to cook the gravy.

This is great. It was especially great for me because I woke up on a Sunday morning and smelled sausage. I walked down stairs and the boyfriend was at the stove cooking! First time he has ever cooked for me. It turned out awesome. We put our gravy over english muffins.

This is a great recipe for sausage gravy.  I've been searching for this recipe for a long time.  I followed the instructions, and it turned out fantastic.  I thought that using maple sausage was strange, but it tasted wonderful.

I have been making this gravy for over a year using different types of sausage and they all turn out amazing. Maple sticks a little so I use it less often. This is the best gravy recipe ever my family loves it! My father always asks me to make extra and deliver some to his house.

This is the easiest sausage gravy recipe I've ever made!  I use bulk sausage (sometimes breakfast or sometimes Italian Sweet) in my recipe and my husband loves it.  I also make up some drop biscuits to place the gravy over.  This is simple, fast and very filling on a chilly night.  It is also good with fried or scrambled eggs on the side.  Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful results! Used 2% milk and had more sausage than it asked for but equaled it out with more milk. Turned out great. Very versatile recipe.

I am always apprehensive when trying new recipes.  I had never made anything with a roux before this.  The instructions were prefect, and the gravy turned out just great.  I, however, used "regular flavor" sausage instead of maple sausage (I suppose I'm not that adventurous).

This was fantastic. I made it for dinner tongiht and my husband and one year old love love loved it. I normally am not a buscuit and gravy fan, but i loved it too. I will be a new staple in our family, and it is possiblly one of the most inexpensive things to make. Great recipe.

This is so easy to make and is some of the best sausage gravy and biscuits I've ever had. I don't even bother taking the sausage out it all stays in till it's done. Great recipe!

Good stuff.  I didn't use maple sausage, just regular.  Just my preference.  I prefer it much over packaged gravy mixes.  They are far too salty or something.

This recipe is good and easy. I didn't really care for the Maple sausage so I will try a different kind next time, but still very good.

Absolutely fantstic. I used a spicy sausage because the family likes hot stuff. They adored this recipe. I had never made sausage gravy before. Hubby's mom's recipe intimidated me too much, but this was great and easy too.
Will be a sunday breakfast staple from now on.

Perfect!  All 5 members of my family loved it!!  I find on my stove I have to keep the heat hot for it to thicken up but it thickened up beautifully!  I served it over JP's Big Daddy Biscuits from this site and got raves!

Wow, I've never made sausage gravy before but this was excellent!  I was pleased with the maple sausage, I thought it would be very sweet/dominant but it wasn't.  Very easy to make also, I served over refrigerated butter layer biscuits from a can - they were a great complement.  Thanks so much for the recipe, many future guests in my house will enjoy it!

Very good gravy! I did not add butter, and used regular sausage instead, since I am not a fan of maple sausage. We loved it! I also cooked it in an electric wok. It worked out very nice! I will use this recipe again.

This is not something that appealed to me, but my husband want me to make it. As I cooked it I always think, I'm just going to have salad... I always end up eating to much of this anyways i's so yummy! We even multiplied it to feed 70+ people for a community dinner and it was a HUGE hit!

Nice, simple recipe.  I doubled it to serve at a Sunday Brunch and it turned out just fine.  I actually made the gravy about 1 1/2 hours before Brunch, covered it, and set it aside.  I reheated the gravy right before serving and it held up beautifully.  I used regular sausage, instead of maple-flavored, but otherwise stuck to the original recipe.  For those who complain about blandness, this is not supposed to be a highly seasoned dish.  Just look at the ingredients.  People tend to adjust the seasoning using as much salt and pepper as they wish at the table.  Thanks, Bill - this is a keeper!

This was great, and it can be used with any sausage as I know cus its so easy to make and I have made it many times just this year alone and I love it, my hubby was home from Iraq and I wanted to cook him something different everyday but this was requested even for just a snack, but my picky 5yr son loved it too so Thanks.

I had most of a bag of Hormel premium maple bacon crumbles left over from my Super Bowl chili recipe so I figured I'd use it in this recipe so they wouldn't go to waste.  REALLY GOOD on the Texas Style Biscuits I just baked.  Can't wait to try it with the sausage.  Thanks for the recipe!

I only give it 4 stars because I think I may have added too much salt.  I added a little onion powder as suggested by another reviewer ans think that may have been what set it off.  Kids still asked for 2nds but it could very well be that these are my mistakes and truly deserves 5 stars.

This is a keeper.  The only thing different was that I could not find a 12oz package of maple sausage.  I could only find a 16oz package.  But that was just fine with my husband he loves anything pork.

It was good, just not for my family. Out of 5 people, no one had seconds (including my always hungry hubby, and 14 year old son) and 2 of the kids didn't even finish. So, it was easy to make, had good flavor, just not right for my family

I have never really liked buscuits and gravey.  I decided to try to make some for my husband who loves it and was tired of the prepackaged boil the bag in water kind.  I picked this because there were a lot of reviews on it and they seemed to like it.  I ate it with my husband and now I can't get enough of it.  Bill really knows his stuff.  I have made this so much that I don't even need to look at the recipe.  I love it with drop buscuits.  YUM

This was really great I just got done eating it and I couldnt help but to join this site and thank you for this. I have never made Sausage Gravy or any other gravy for that matter in my life. It turned out great, I followed the directions as you described and that was all I needed. The maple sausage was awesome with it! And you really helped me to impress my family. Great Recipe, Thank You!

Made it this morning for the kids along with the banana muffins.  Not a drop left on their plates.  We made it just like the guys at the firehouse, not removing the sausage from the pan, but just throwing it all together.  The maple sausage is awesome in this recipe!  Very simple, and very good!

Delicious!  This was my first time making sausage gravy and it was just as good as any restaurant.  My only complaint would be that the gravy didn't have much sausagy flavor, I think because the sausage didn't leave behind many drippings.  I might try something other than the maple sausage next time.

My son absolutely loves this recipe...I think it is just a bit bland making it as directed.  Next time will try the sage as recommended.

This was really good. I used turkey sausage and there wasnt any drippings so I melted about 1/4c olivio in the pan. I also used skim milk and it thickened up nicely. I will make this again.

Before I found this recipe several years ago--I was NEVER able to make good gravy! Mine always tasted too "floury". The maple flavor really makes the dish; however, I have not been able to find the maple sausage in my stores lately!  For anyone who has never been able to make homemade gravy--you HAVE to try this!  We make this alot at tailgates and campouts as well!  Thank you BILL!

LOVED IT!  I did use regular sausage though. I'm not used to making gravy...but it seemed to take longer than it should to thicken up.  Really, really good flavor though!

We always use 1% milk, but this is the best sausage gravy I've ever had.

I make this recipe all the time, at the request of my fiance. A life-time fan of Bob Evans' biscuits and gravy, he says I have ruined Bob Evans for him because this gravy is by far the best he's ever had! And trust me, he is picky. Every restaurant we go to, he has a hard time finding sausage gravy that pleases him. Certainly, I will be using this recipe forever!

This recipe was wonderful!!  Probably the best sausage gravy I have ever had, restaurants included!!!  The only thing I would change is to cut back the sausage just a little and add a little more milk, only because I like my gravy a little less thick.  I used JC Potter mild sausage.  This will definitely be my sausage gravy recipe from now on!!!

OH MY GOSH!!! This was awesome.  My husband's favorite thing was Bob Evan's Sausage 'N Gravy..well he now says we're no longer going there, this Sausage Gravy is even better!!  I didn't change a thing about this recipe.  Also it's sooo easy to make and fast!!!  We served it on Pillsbury Buttermilk Buiscuits and like I said it was awesome.  Will definately be making it alot more!!! Thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

SOOOOOOO good!  This time I used 2 packages of maple sausage instead of one, and left the same measurements for the rest of the ingredients.  Everybody loved it!  Definitely a keeper, thanks!!
