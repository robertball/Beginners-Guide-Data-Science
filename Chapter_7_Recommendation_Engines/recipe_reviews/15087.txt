I gave these out as gifts before I tried the recipe.  One person commented she needed to add more margerine because they didnt hold together.  Another person commented they were hard to chew.  I had to bake some to find out for myself.  I agreed it needed more margerine and make sure to use mini M & Ms, the regular size fall out when you form the balls.  The taste is good and my kids liked them.

We found that you need to use 1/2 cup margarine instead of the listed 1/4 cup. I believe this might have been a typo because every similar recipe has 1/2 cup.

I am planning on making these for Christmas gifts, so I decided to try them for myself.  I thought the cookies were really good, chewy and crispy.  My husband and daughter both loved them. They were easy to make and looked really nice layered in the jar.  The typo must have been fixed, because the recipe now calls for 1/2 cup margarine and I had no problems getting the cookies to hold together. I am also thinking about trying them with chopped nuts.

I decided to use this recipe for my daughter's 5th grade class Valentine's Day Party.
I cut the recipe in half and used a pint size jar.
We put raffia and Valentine ribbon around the top
of the jar with the recipe attached. All the kids
loved the project and the kids loved baking the
cookies at home. They said the cookies were "awesome". I will use this recipe for Easter
gifts using pastel M&Ms for my Sunday school class. Thanks for a great idea!pattih5

Pretty easy. However, there's so much stuff in them that when you bake them they hardly stay together. In fact, some of mine broke apart even after completely cooling them. They're somewhat tasty, but they have too much 'stuff'. I'd cut one of the goodies out.

This is an easy recipe and looks beautiful!  A fun gift idea for any occasion.  I found you can use the "seasonal" M&M's to make it appropriate for any occasion.

The jars look great.  The cookie tastes good, it a bit dry and hard.  Would cut down on the amount of Choc. Chips, found there were too many.

I always make these recipes first before giving them as gifts.  I followed the directions, added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and they were terrific!  Using a small ice cream scoop to drop the cookies on the cookie sheet was VERY effective.

I have to agree with an earlier post, too much stuff!  I think I would leave out the M&M's even though the mini M&M's did look pretty in the jar.  They baked a little dry, maybe better as a bar or with more butter?

Gave these as gifts and everyone loved them! I substituted butter on the label for margarine just based on my personal preference. They're so pretty in the jar too!

This recipe is yummy. I added a half teaspoon of vanilla to the dough and it gave it a sweeter taste. I am making several of these for my nieces and nephews this holiday season!

I made these cookies yesterday as directed. my family and I found that they were crisy (not hard), just crisy.

We made them again today.  This time we used peanut butter large m&ms, added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and used butterscotch chips. We removed the oats.  Cooked them for 10 minutes and they came out a little more like a soft cookie.  Doing the peanut butter m&ms and butterscotch chips make it a unique taste and like it. 

Giving this receipe a 4 due to the crisiness of the cookie the first time around.  Second time around giving it a 5 star.

These make great gifts, bake sale items, shower favors and just to make. Once people have made the cookies they always seem to come back asking for the recipe. Thanks!

I don't know how these will taste, but the jar sure is attractive.  Very colorful.  The arrangement of the ingredients is just right.  I like how the flour comes after the brown sugar instead of something it can leak down into.

I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF CRAFTS FOR VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL.  I USED THIS RECIPE AS A PROJECT WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE ADULTS SAW HOW MUCH FUN THE CHILDREN WERE HAVING THEY JOINED US.  THE COOKIES ARE VERY GOOD.  ONE OF THE TEENAGE GIRLS WENT HOME AND BAKED HER COOKIES AND THEN BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE CHURCH.  I MADE AN ASSEMBLY LINE OF THE INGREDIENTS, HAD THE PAPER ON THE TABLE MARKED WITH THE AMOUNTS NEEDED, AND I HAD PURCHASED DISPOSABLE MEASURING CUPS.  EVERYTHING WENT WELL.  WE COVERED THE LIDS WITH HERSHEY KISS FABRIC, USED RIBBON TO TIE ON THE RECIPE CARD, AND WE WERE FINISHED.  WE COMPLETED ABOUT 50 JARS AT CHURCH AND I MADE A FEW MORE WITH THE LEFT OVERS AT HOME.  THANKS FOR YOUR RECIPIES AND WEB SITE.
