The lamb turned out very flavourful.  Used 1TBS. dry mint, and reduced the apple cider vinegar by half. Can't go wrong with Chef John on your team. Thanks.

Do not make this! Do not make this unless you are prepared to be hounded forevermore. I remember the days when all that was requested of me was chicken wings. -sigh- Oh and there is no need to adjust. They are perfection. Seriously. Oh yeah, I had to order the skewers from Amazon. Good thing the pack was ginormous because it appears Iâ€™ll be needing them for sure.
