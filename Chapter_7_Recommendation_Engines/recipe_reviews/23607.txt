There is an easy fix to this recipe.  Uncooked flour will taste like raw flour.  To correctly make this sauce (called a roux) you must first cook your flour in a couple of tablespoons of butter or oil.  Heat the butter in a saucepan on low heat, being careful not to burn.  Stir in flour until a paste is formed.  THEN add liquid ingredients gradually, stirring constantly over low heat until smooth and desired consitency.

When I tried this recipe it tasted chalking and flour-ey !!!  I would suggest that no one use this and that if you do try it, you use LESS flour.

This started too flour-ee.  We used half & half with regular white flour,  doubling the amount of dairy with the prescribed amount of flour and it turned out fine.  Then we added salt, lots of pepper and 6 cloves of garlic in a 4 serving recipe.  Yum.  2 star recipe starting but but it's a 4 1/2 star recipe with these changes :-D

I used this as a base for white sauce for peas. I suggest adding some sugar for a little flavor. Maybe garlic, parsley etc. It has no taste but can be used as a base and then add what you want to make it taste like something other then flour.

I used this as a base for my cream sauce, adding some garlic, salt, pepper, and italian spice for flavour. It turned out quite well but I would use a little less flour next time.

This definitely has potential but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I wish I would have read the reviews before ruining my heavy cream [expensive stuff!].  I cut this recipe down to serve 2 and still it came out too thick.  Definitely should have used less flour!  I ended up having to add dill & garlic to spruce it up.  I am not sure if I want to attempt this recipe again but I am sure it could be fixed.

I tried it with chicken breasts and served it on top of pasta it was pretty good it depends I guess how you spice it up and what pasta you may use. I used reg. spaghetti but you can use fettucine, or linguini,or like pastas that really hold up to a good sauce such as this.

I halved the recipe (didn't know if it would keep) and it didn't turn out well at all.  In the end, I used 1 cup of cream, salt and pepper, some garlic and corn starch to thicken.  This way turned out better than the directions.

Add much less flour. To fix I added 1/4 tsp of salt, oregano, and 2 cloves garlic, 1/8 tsp of thyme and cumin, 1/4 cup milk, 2tbs of olive oil.

I ended up adding a lot of garlic to it, making it into a garlic cream sauce out of it.  The amount of garlic varies for the dish you're using for.  For just plain pasta, I usually end up using 2-3 cloves.  But obviously it depends on the person.  It made a very good base for a garlic sauce.

I used this recipe to teach an 18 year old neighbor to cook for herself. It was used with shell noodles to create a simple side dish with steaks and came out fantastically good.

Blahhhh! It had no flavor at all... unless you like the taste of flour.
I was lucky to have some white cheeses on hand to bring it to life.

Tracy is 100% correct! Must cook the flour first! I didn't make this I just know it would be an unpleasant taste the way it's written.
