This recipe is so similar to mine - I don't think I've ever measured...I do add worcestershire sauce to each layer.  This was a family tradition at my house for Thanksgiving.  I like it with a Steak as well (and have been known to heat them up and eat for breakfast - it grosses my family out but I love them)!  Glad to see someone else is eating them!!!

Pretty much the same as the one I make(I'm not very good at measuring), but it never occurred to me to use parsley and I liked the dash of color. I've been addicted to these since I was a little kid and I'm ashamed to say that I probably make them 7 or 8 times a year and am very selfish. Have to admit I've done the "breakfast thing", as well...
Awesome!

This was really the best scalloped oysters I have ever eaten.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner with the family and made it the following week for my husband and I.  No changes were made.

Great recipe.  I layered the oysters with chopped cooked bacon, onions, parm. Cheese, and used dash of old bay on each layer..Cook in cast iron. Skillet..makes it crispy...

I just tried this recipe out of curiosity (and the video looks so good). I don't even like oysters, except for the canned smoked oysters, but I really liked this recipe. Although, I found that in order to cover the bottom of the dish and the first layer of oysters the same way Chef John does in his video, I needed more like 5 cups of crushed crackers. I used half Chicken in a Biscuit and half Saltines. This is a great way to use up stale crackers! I used four 8 ounce cans of whole oysters, but dumped half of the liquid that was in the cans. I've never bought fresh oysters so I don't know how much "liquor" is normal. If you used canned or jarred oysters, be careful of the occasional small pieces of shell! I think next time I'll use a little more cream. Overall, it turned out very good. The funny thing is that my husband didn't like it. Said it was too fishy tasting (which he doesn't like). I thought the exact opposite. I thought it was hardly fishy at all. Funny coming from a guy who likes oyster shooters (but I don't)! Oh, and when reheating any leftovers, watch out! When I pulled my plate out of the microwave, an oyster exploded! So leave your covered dish in the microwave for a few seconds before pulling it out!

Like others, my north Louisiana family has been enjoying a dish almost exactly like this during the holidays at least since the 1950s (as far back as I can remember). We do not mix the crackers with butter, and do not really measure. Just crumble a good layer of crackers and top with oysters, closely spaced because they will shrink with cooking. We also add worcestershire, green onions, and some Tony Chachere's. Repeat the layers, ending with crackers topped with butter pats, then pour in milk until it looks right! :-) We always use fresh oysters, but I have learned that in recent years there is usually water added to the liquor so it is not very flavorful, and we do not use that any more. This is always requested and devoured by family members who like oysters!

This is very similar to my Grandparents' traditional recipe. I use a quart of oysters and about 4 cups crushed oyster crackers. I layers the crackers, oysters and pats of butter in a 3 quart casserole dish . This seems to prevent anything from getting dried out and what joy to dig into those many layers of heavenly goodness.  I also mix about 1/2 cup of oyster liquid w/ the cream and slowly pour that into the casserole. I season only with some pepper and bake at 350 for 45.  Oh, and never reheat in the microwave; do it in a frying pan with a little extra milk to moisten. Chef John is right, it is so good, it is only served once a year for Thanksgiving; we all look forward to it!

Great recipe, everyone loved it and none left over!  Mixed the oyster juice with cream and seasonings which I poured a little layering the casserole and then over the top.  Also, added a 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika and Worcester sauce.

Love this, I've made it for years, sometimes I just use milk instead of
 cream and it's still wonderful.  Yep, I've eaten it for breakfast too!

Just like our traditional family recipe, with the addition of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of Tabasco. instead of the red pepper…probably just the same taste.    Very delicious.  There are never leftovers as this is the dish everyone heads to for seconds. This is also a good dish to let the kids help assemble.  They all love draining the oysters with their clean hands to check for shells.  We cannot think of a family holiday dinner without these!!

OMG!!!!!! It is wonderfully good for such easy preparation.  One of my guests didn't like oysters, but tried it and then went in for a second helping.  I just wonder what sides would be good to serve with this?

Easy to make after I watched the video.  Disappeared quickly at a potluck. Agree you must use quality oysters of course!

I made this yesterday for a a holiday get together and it was big hit. I did add a few more spices, garlic and onion powder for sure. I also put swiss cheese on the top before baking. People that didn't know if they really liked oysters came back for seconds. Definitely a keeper.

CHEF JOHN, you rock! Had searched for a recipe similar to my grandmothers so I could prepare oysters for my dad. This is perfect!  I used two 12oz containers of fresh oysters.  The only addition was a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce in the oysters because my grandmother did so.   Can't wait to make them again at Christmas.

We made this and it was soooooo good.  I could have eaten the entire recipe by myself.  Since the oysters were a gift, I felt compelled to share but I have to tell you it was really hard to share. I'm not normally a selfish person so I was really surprised at my reaction not to want to share any of this.

The only change I made was leaving out the parsley as I had none on hand. Otherwise did everything as shown and it was wonderful! My whole family ate it- including kids- and we all thoroughly enjoyed. Highly recommend you try it if you like oysters

This was a Thanksgiving tradition in the house I grew up in.  Everything about it is perfect.  However...in the tradition in my gramma, I used condensed milk and added an extra jar of oysters!

I added some cooked bacon, some chopped fried shallots, and a little chopped spinach. The flavour was great, but neither of us was a fan of the butter-soaked crackers.  I'd rather either make this with a well-vented pastry top, or using crackers only on the top, not in layers.

I start with this recipe, then add spinach,  garlic, Worcestershire sauce and top with parmesan to make Scalloped Oysters Rockefeller! It's a favorite Thanksgiving side dish. I made it last year and got a request to bring it again this year too.

I made this this evening and it was delicious!! I halved the recipe since it was just for myself, but still had to crush up 2 sleeves of saltines. I used worcestshire sauce, Old Bay, and Tapatio (in place of the cayenne) for each layer in addition to salt and pepper. Turned out great! I also may use more heavy cream next time, and maybe a little less oyster liquor, as the bottom was a smidge soggy~ still good though! I will definitely be making again!! Thanks for the recipe :)

This was excellent and just what I was looking for.    I did add a little shredded gruyere cheese on each layer and a few extra saltines on top to make it extra crunchy.  I also added some cayenne pepper to the saltines and butter before layering them.

Excellent recipe I only bought 1 cup of shucked fresh oysters. I cut the ingredients by half , I may have added a tad bit more cyanne seasoning but the Italian parsley is a must have for this recipe and dashes of worchestar sauce didn't hurt either very yummy

I thought it was very good but I'm sure there are bazillions of calories.  My husband did not care for the taste and definitely the texture.  Guess I won't make this again.

This recipe was easy to make. I used Ritz and another cracker bc it's what I had. I also used half and half for the same reason, but otherwise I followed it pretty closely. It was delicious and the leftovers were good too. I will make it again for sure.

My husband and I both love oysters but I have to honestly say we did not like this recipe. I felt it was a waste of my ingredients  as I ended up throwing it out. Number one it was way to salty. I think omitting the juice of the oysters and adding another wet liquid and using saltless crackers would be the thing to do. Number two ,  I didn’t like the layered crackers. Will add to the top only if I make it again.

Easy, peezy!  Toughest part of this recipe is finding fresh oysters in the desert highlands of AZ.  Even with bottled giant oysters (5-6 per jar), this still hits the spot as a side or the main dish.

The family raved about this recipe!  I had been making an Amish recipe for years that never came out the same...sometimes soggy, sometimes greasy....and I never ever thought of dicing up the oysters.  Genius!!! This is exactly how scalloped oysters should be! Make it exactly as written and you will not be disappointed.

I used whole wheat saltines and instead of cayenne pepper, I used dabs of Thai red curry paste on each oyster.  Everyone loved this side dish, even those at the table who are ambivalent about oysters!

Making this now!  I make every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  2 sleeves of saltines, small box of Chicken in a Biscuit, extra butter, maybe some cheddar on top....   If any of it is left after the meal, it’s because someone wanted some for the next day’s breakfast!  Great recipe

Not sure I’d make it again. The oysters got lost in the crumb mixture.  It was fairly greasy, maybe because I had to substitute for the heavy cream. It was also pretty mushy.  Guess I’ll go back to individually breaded oven fried oysters.

Maybe I'm used to Oyster Stuffing.  Made exactly as stated and it tasted like saltines.  Even used fresh oysters with juice.  It was also mushy, baked it longer but it was still yucky

Yuk!! This recipe was a waste of good oysters.I followed it exactly, and used oysters fresh from the water. Nobody in my family would eat it, and we are oyster lovers! I think perhaps this recipe would be better using fresh scallops.

Disappointing. I was expecting something really special, but this was a letdown. It wasn't "decadent" nor rich, despite the butter and cream. It didn't have any special flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly. If I make again, I would not use cayenne pepper; this doesn't need any heat. I might increase the butter to one cup and the cream to one-and-a-half cups. Perhaps a buttery cracker, rather than saltines, might also add more flavor.

Made it Thanksgiving morning and let cool to room temperature.  It set up nicely and had good flavor. There were 12 adults and not one of us had ever had Oyster dressing (we live in Nebraska).  Polished off the 9x13 casserole but the consensus is that it is too rich. I'm glad I tried it but think will move on to try other sorts of holiday side dishes.

Well Chef John was right, you have to love oysters for this recipe. I split the dish between 2 dishes.  The first was made as written and the other I added garlic and worchestire sauce.  I made this knowing that it may not go over well but I've wanted to make this for awhile.  After tasting both dishes the receipe received 3-never agains, 1-OK and 1-like.  I liked it and had it the next day for breakfast with a few dashes of hot sauce.  I doubt I'll make again but enjoyed the process.  Thanks Chef John!
