I am a pastry chef with a small bakery/cafe. I use this recipe** everyday to make these donuts.   **I like to add 2T. melted butter instead of shortening, omit the cinnamon in the batter, use buttermilk instead of milk and bake them at 400' for 8 to 9 minutes.  Once finished, a quick dunk in melted butter and a roll in white sugar, granulated brown sugar and cinnamon (combined of course) makes a donut my customers crave.  I also bake them in mini muffin pans (same time as donuts) and they are "poppers".  Try these revisions and you will never go to the chains again for donuts.  YUM.

I bought an electric doughnut maker expecting it to come with a simple recipe but it didn't. After searching on here for the tastiest sounding recipe but also the least complicated i found this delicious mix which is absolutely fabulous with a chocolate topping.

I honestly don't understand why this recipe has gotten so many one-star reviews.  I have made them twice now, and they barely lasted a day both times - my family just loves them!  They are not Tim Hortons/Krispy Kreme donuts, but I wasn't expecting them to be either.  I wanted something much lighter that I could use my donut pans for, and I think this recipe is perfect for what I was looking for.

If you are expecting these to taste like a fried donut you will be disappointed.  For a baked donut, though, they are *very* good.  And do not expect them to brown--they will be pale.  They are done when they spring back to a light touch.  If you bake them till they brown they are dry.  I make them with only 1T of melted butter (to save on calories--it doesn't affect the donuts), then spray them on both sides with butter-flavored cooking spray after they come out of the oven. I also add plenty of cinnamon to the glaze (we like cinnamon a lot) and it makes them taste like the powdered sugar/cinnamon donuts only they do not shed.  The texture is a little different than a fried cake donut--lots lighter (not sure where others are getting denser).  The hardest part is getting the right amount of batter into the donut pan =D.   The batter is extremely stiff, and does take some getting used to as far as transferring it into the donut pan. It helps to take a toothpick and run it through the batter--it seals up the edges of the batter so they come out circular instead of  like a sealed "c."  It also takes some of the air bubbles out of the batter, so the bottoms are prettier and not all cratered.   From the above recipe you will get ~48 mini donuts.  We love them!  Next time I will try the chocolate.  Or maybe half chocolate and half cinnamon glazed.

To make these Cake Doughnuts fluffy, mix just until moistened and use buttermilk (3/4 cup of milk w/ scant 1 T vinegar; let sit 5-10 mins). Otherwise, you will get a tough doughnut from over-mixing. Gotta find a different frosting.

I took the top reviewer's suggestions and omitted the nutmeg and cinnamon, I used buttermilk ("soured" lactose-free milk, really) and I used two tablespoons melted butter in place of the shortening. Honestly, I made this recipe twice this morning. The first time was unsuccessful because I overfilled the doughnut pans (and honestly, I think that the baking time was too low) and the doughnuts were underdone and kind of gross. The second time, I slowed my roll. I used a tablespoon of batter on each side of the doughnut pan, banged the pan down on the counter a few times (which my mother always taught me to do with cakes, not only to even the batter but to also try to eliminate some of the air bubbles), then I baked them for eight minutes at 425*. The second time they turned out perfect. They're exactly as the title states--fluffy and cake-y. I got 18 muffins out of one recipe. I used my Grandma's Vanilla Glaze for these doughnuts instead of the one called for in this recipe. My husband and kids ate 12 doughnuts all on their own, I sent the other 6 to my aunt's house for her family. This was a good learning experiance for the first time I've ever used a doughnut pan. I'll use this recipe again.

This recipe even worked well with my mini-doughnut pan, which a lot of other batters don't do well.  My husband loves these if I add some cocoa into the mix too, they're wonderful!

Great recipe with just a few tweaks.  I followed others' advice and omitted the cinnamon, used "sour" milk, added an extra 1 T shortening (I melted the shortening to incorporate it better) and topped them by dunking in butter and rolling in cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Outstanding!

Didn't taste like either a donut or cake.  Very disappointing when so many of the reviews seemed positive.  If you don't have one of the donut pans, be aware that the dough is more like the consistency of pancake batter so without that special type of pan you won't be able to make these.

Just right for a doughnut that is baked!  It has a nice flavor.  I have tried the chocolate iced and the almond iced.  I used less of the almond flavoring, but both turned out very tasty.  Tastes so much more wholesome than the deep-fried counterparts.

I am very pleased with this recipe. I baked them in my new donut maker and they baked up so fast!  I halved the recipe to test out my donut maker and I was able to make 9 donuts. They are fluffy and flavorful! Will be using this recipe.  didn't have nutmeg, but tasted great.  ***UPDATE: I made half of the recipe again and used half white whole wheat flour and a scoop of flax seed. Brown sugar instead of white.  I also, added 1/4 cup of fat free sour cream and used buttermilk instead of milk.  They came out so much better and taste great! Oh, they are addicting. I was able to make 13 donuts in my donut maker from half the recipe. I used 1 heaping TBL of mix in each donut cavity.  Yummy! I already ate 3 of them...  :) --- Chocolate glaze: 1/2 cup semi-sweet choc chips, 2 teaspoons butter or shortening, and 1 teaspoon corn syup.  melt in microwave 30 sec and stir til smooth.

I made these doughnuts using a doughnut pan I bought on clearance and didn't know what to do with. I had used other recipes and got a "muffin" taste every time. I went with the suggestion of the pastry chef's review and omitted the cinnamon and I used buttermilk as the liquid and melted butter instead of shortening . they tasted exactly like Doughnuts. I guarantee it's the nutmeg that you'd never expect. I will try dunking in butter and sugar next time. I used powder sugar and they were delicious. I will make these for a bake sale fundraiser at my husbands office and see how they do. One tip for a mini doughnut pan is to take a piping bag or a ziplock bag with the tip cut off one edge to pipe the batter into the rings to get them even and keep from wasting and spilling lots of batter. it makes a very pretty uniform round doughnut.

I really enjoyed these doughnuts as they were easy to make.  It took me a little longer as I used an electric doughnut maker instead of a donut pan.  I will probably use less nutmeg and more cinnamon next time.  My friends and family really liked them with the glaze on them.

This is almost exactly Sur la Table's recipe for baked cake doughnuts from another blog I found. They only omit the cinnamon and vanilla, use cake flour instead of all purpose, and buttermilk in place of milk - all the proportions are the same.
My mini doughnuts turned out great, but BE SURE to lightly grease/oil/spray the pan, or these will be hard to get out. I think I added too much spice, so next time I'll follow more closely. I also think buttermilk would be great (sub yogurt if need be).
What I do know is that these were made the night before and gone the next morning, and the recipe made 48 mini doughnuts, probably more if I hadn't filled the pan so high.
Dusted with powdered sugar or coated with chocolate these were eye catching and tasty.
A trick for pouring into the pan. I used a sport top water bottle, cut in half and poured the batter in and let it fall into the pan wells, stopping the flow with my finger between wells. Since it had an attached cap it made it easy to close and set upside down until the next batch (very little batter escaped) The hole might need to be made a little bigger, but that's what kitchen scissors are for.
I might try a chocolate version next time- replacing 1/4 cup of flour with coacoa... hmmm

I love this because I bought a little doughnut pan for five bucks today, no instructions or anything.  I'm a pretty healthy eater, just I'm a sucker for sweets & I love to bake.  I subbed a lot of stuff due to the fat content like egg whites, used nonfat milk, margarine for the shortening, and splenda.  I omitted the nutmeg, although I love it.  I made all different kinda of doughnuts in one batch.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of cocoa powder to the remaining of the batter for 3 minis, added some pumpkin pie spice & more cinnamon for 3, and left the other 6 the basic recipe.  I made a fat free cream cheese/sour cream frosting for them.  So delicious, I will continue to make these.  Thank you!

I got a donut pan as a gift today so, despite the fact that I baked 3 dozen donut muffins yesterday, I had to try these out!  I followed Jmyslin's (the pastry chef) review, and omitted the cinnamon, used buttermilk in place of milk, and used melted butter in place of shortening.  Then, after baking, I dipped them in melted butter and rolled them in a combination of cinnamon, white sugar and brown sugar.  Wow!  They are springy and rather light.  Moist and tasty!  The butter/sugary coating is the icing on the cake!  (see what I did there?  A baking pun!).  Next time I make them, I will try them with the glaze...and will probably make it chocolate.  These are wonderful, and I highly recommend them!  Thank you for a great recipe :)

I made this recipe on a whim, and only had 1.5 cups of flour left in my pantry, so I added 1/2 c of bisquick. I did everything else in the recipe except I omitted the cinnamon, replaced 2 T butter for the shortening as recommended by a reviewer.  I only had milk so used that.  Baked at 400 degrees for 8-9 min.  They were pale and came up a little when touched. These turned out AMAZING!!  My kids were begging for more.  Moist,fluffy delicious.  I dipped them in butter and then in cinnamon/brown sugar/powdered sugar mixture.  These were so good!  I also made the glaze but the kids liked the other ones better.  They were begging for more so I went and got all the right ingredients this time.  I got flour & buttermilk, and used those the second time, and followed the recipe carefully.  They were dense and not very good at all!  Oh no!  So, I'm going back to my original batch version from now on... with the 1/2 c bisquick and milk!  So good! :)

Toughness is caused by overbeating the batter.  Solution:  Put the flour in a separate bowl and put aside.  In a different bowl mix everything but the flour.  

When you have a nice wet mixture, SLOWLY, gently, pour it into the flour and then GENTLY BLEND it into the flour.  DON'T BEAT IT.  Use gentle motions to mix it all together.

Flour is usually sifted or comes pre-sifted in order to have extra air put into it to cause it to rise light and fluffy.  If you add everything immediately to the flour, you will need to beat it pretty hard in order to incorporate those whole eggs, etc., into the flour.  If you beat hard, you are eliminating any extra air in the flour and that's why the donuts become tough.

The best motion is less motion.  :-)

Followed the recipe exactly to make my first donuts in my new mini pan. I tossed them in sugar & cinnamon just as they came out of the oven. Delicious. I had no appetite and didn't feel like eating anything today, but I devoured these like they were, well, donuts.

Surpisingly good for a baked doughnut.  To try out my brand new Wilton doughnut pan, I made only half the recipe (6 doughnuts).  After reading ALL the reviews for this recipe, I decided to eliminate the cinnamon, use buttermilk instead of milk, and substitute melted butter for the shortening, increasing the amt. for the half recipe to 1 tablespoon.  The doughnuts baked in a preheated 400 degree oven for exactly 9 minutes.  After cooling, I dipped them in the glaze.  NOTE:  I had to increase the amt. of confectioner's sugar to obtain the consistency I desired.  All in all, pretty darn good.  I will be making these again.

These were delicious. I did make some changes - I used cake flour, buttermilk, and melted butter to replace the AP flour, milk, and oil. I also baked at 400 degrees and they still took 10 minutes to be done. Very tasty.

EVERYONE I SERVE THESE TO LOVE THEM! I use the sugar/ brown sugar/cinnamon topping another person suggested and I also sour my own regular milk with 2 tbs. of lemon juice as another suggested. AWESOME! * Just a note, I did find that if I wait to coat these it won't work well, they need to be hot and moist, the butter application idea is a good one, and I use a pastry brush.* These are our new weekend breakfast treat, Thanks for a great recipe and great review ideas ;)

These doughnuts were soooo good!  I followed a few reviews, particularly the one who subbed some of the flour for Bisquick.  I used 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup Bisquick.  I also used butter in place of the shortening and I made my own 'buttermilk' by adding 1 T vinegar to the 3.4 cup milk.  I dipped half in melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar and the other half in a yummy chocolate glaze and sprinkles.  My extremely picky 6 year old said these were the best doughnuts ever!  Oh, I also used a mini doughnut pan.Thanks for a great recipe!

I love store bought cake donuts, and I wanted to make my own. I followed the recipe and mine turned out very dense, nothing like the light and fluffy donuts I get from the store. I won't be making these again..

I have come to terms with the fact that baked donuts will be slightly dense and a tad dry.  That being said, These were the best I've tried!!!  And in the past few days, i'd tried quite a few!    I did follow one reviewer's advice and baked at 400, hoping that this would keep them a little more moist.  They only needed to bake for about 5-6 minutes.  I made mini donuts and this recipe made 36 and I over filled the pan a bit, so I could have gotten more if I tried.    While they were still very hot I put them in a bowl of cinnamon and sugar.  I had tried it with brown and white sugar, but my husband didn't like the brown sugar.  I also tried dipping them in melted butter first, but again, my husband didn't like that.  I, personally, loved them!  It brought out the "Paula Deen" in me.  lol

ATTENTION - this is not a doughnut, it is a cake that looks like a doughnut. Even though I was a little bit disapointed, it was a pretty good tasting cake.

Wonderful cake doughnut recipe!  It came out a bit lighter than the "store made" cake doughnuts, but they had a very nice texture and crumb.  I followed the recipe exactly and I had no problems with the batter being too dry, like some of the reviewers did.  The batter was nice and smooth and squeezed easily out of my pastry bag into the doughnut forms.  They baked well and looked lovely.  We ate them warm and plain (we aren't icing or glaze fans) and they were moist and springy.  5 stars from me!

ehhh....not sure what to say about these.  i don't think the cinnamon and nutmeg in the donut went well with the recommended glaze...seems like it would go well with either a chocolate glaze or by dipping the donuts in butter and then cinnamon sugar.  the texture was pretty disappointing, too.  i knew without frying them they weren't going to taste like dunkin' donuts, but these were pretty darn disappointing.

NOT fried doughnuts! lighter, less oily but still sooo good!  i made these with soy milk and no eggs, but it was a thicker batter so i added about a half cup extra milk. VERRY GOOD!!! added half an ounce of chocolate to the glaze and dipped them in sprinkles! way easyer then fried doughnuts, with less mess!

I just made these, and they turned out great!

Per the suggestions of some, I used melted butter and buttermilk.  I added all the liquids to all the dry ingredients and then blended with a light hand, as you would with muffins, to keep them light and textured.

I used a recipe for Krispy Kreme glaze, and that's made a big difference. It's basically the same as this recipe's glaze with melted butter added AND I dipped them in the glaze the second they were out of the pan (or 2 minutes out of oven). That way the glaze gets absorbed into the donut, very lush.

I'll be tweaking, but it's a wonderful basic recipe.

Gave this a 4 star because I had to adjust a couple things.  I wanted only a plain doughnut so I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I dont have a doughnut pan so I used a muffin tin.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the 2 spices I omitted.  Filled the tins up 3/4 like it says.  Only made about 10 though.  However, after 10 minutes they weren't done.  So, I added a couple more minutes on the timer at a time and checked.  I think they baked for about 17 minutes in total.  If they are springy and solid to the touch they are done.  They didnt brown or anything so if they brown it was too long.  After cooling, I made a chocolate glaze with 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 4 tb of cocoa powder, 3 tb of milk, and 2 ts of pure vanilla extract.  Oh my God!  They were so so good!  Best ever with the changes I made.

I really wanted to like these ... I mean I *really* wanted to ... but there was just something about the texture that I couldn't get past.  I made two batches - one in donut pan, the other in mini-muffin tins - and while the grandkids enjoyed frosting and decorating, even they didn't seem to thrilled with the end result.  So sorry - tried to be quite careful with mixing so as not to overbeat, but still same tough chewy taste.

Of course, these are not going to taste like your typical deep fried doughnut.  Keeping that in mind, these are tasty little treats.  Mine did not turn out fluffy, but were more dense.  But I do not have a doughnut pan, so I used my mini-bundt pan.  I glazed them with vanilla glaze and sprinkles, or course, for the kids.  The almond flavoring in the glaze is perfect.  I would definitely make these again as a healthier alternative to regular doughnuts.

Not a fan. Only reason I'm even giving this 3 stars is because they're pretty. I wish I'd read the reviews. I don't have a donut pan so I used a mini muffin tin. I glazed them with the satiny chocolate glaze from this site then dipped in sprinkles. I have a 5 year old who would eat a tire if dipped in sugar... and he ate one bite then just licked the glaze/sprinkles off. Oh well. Time to bust out the yeast and the deep fryer and do it right.

These are incredible!  I took the advice of some here and used buttermilk instead of milk and melted butter instead of shortening.  I love the way they come out!  I put the dough in a gallon-sized plastic bag, cut a tiny corner off and piped them into my donut pan -- much easier to work with the dough that way, and they come out pretty and perfectly round.  Instead of the glaze, I dipped them in melted butter and then in a cinnamon-sugar mix -- delish, and the finish gives the donuts a toasty color, like they were fried.  Yummmmmm!

These cake donuts are very tasty.  I only made a couple changes based on reviews, I used buttermilk, omitted the oil and used 2T melted butter in batter.  When baked, I dipped in melted butter and rolled in brown sugar, sugar and cinnamon. 

What I loved the best about these is that I ad all the ingredients on hand.  The bonus is that the kids ate them up!

I'm not what I would consider to be an advanced baker, so I was skeptical as to if I would be able to pull this one off. I followed the recipe step-by-step and was amazed. I will admit, when I got to the part where I had to "beat" the batter, I was concerned. It seems too sticky and I thought I had messed it up. I couldn't even get the batter to go into my donut pan! It kept sticking to the spoon and my fingers. I tried everything. Eventually I added the batter to a piping bag, and VOILA! These donuts are to die for. I'll never buy another one again!

Not really like a doughnut at all. Not very sweet, and had a bread like texture. Kind of like big less sweet pancakes. They don't taste bad, but they're definitely not what I was looking for.

I saw the high reviews for these doughnuts and excitedly scrambled to make them.  I was optimistic because of the 5 star ratings, and even more optimistic when I tasted the batter and it tasted JUST like a bakery doughnut.  That optimism faded when I took these out of the oven.  

These doughnuts feel and look like rubbery sponges--almost like the top of a mini bagel.  When I broke one apart, it even looked like a sponge.  The flavors present in the batter, which I'd rather eat raw, amalgamate into a dense (not fluffy/light as many reviewers suggest) sponge-like cake/doughnut/ring. The texture is rubbery, and the flavors somehow disappear once baked.

These doughnuts even fail aesthetically because they don't brown.  And if you manage to brown them, that probably means they'll be dry.

The suggested glaze also didn't work for me.  I don't know what I would put on these to make them taste better. I suggest the melted butter + cinnamon/brown sugar/sugar combo.

I followed the recipe exactly, but used a mini doughnut pan.  However, the only difference I think the regular doughnut pan would have made would be even bigger rubbery sponge cake/doughnut/ring/blobs.

If you want the pros, they're really easy to make, and they don't make any crumbs when you eat them.

Very disappointing.  It will be a while before I attempt another baked doughnut recipe.

I made these for a coworker's birthday. Much easier than fried yeast donuts. All my coworkers loved them, but I'm not a fan of cake donuts in general. I made almond glazed, vanilla glazed, chocolate glazed and powdered sugar.

Not like fried donuts, but I didn't expect them to be. Very good for baked donuts. =) We subsituted the shortening for butter, however.

Loved the doughnuts...still on the search for the perfect glaze though! I did melt butter and then dip them in a cinnamon/sugar/brown sugar mixture...those were my favorite! My husband thought they were better when I only dipped half in butter and then the sugar mixture. :) I liked them either way. I WILL make these again...maybe will try butter and then powdered sugar?? :) Thanks for a yummy non fried doughnut recipe!

These are fairly good.  I added a little extra flour and then rolled the dough out and cut it into donut shapes with a biscuit cutter (and then cut a hold in the center with a little cookie cutter).  They definitely need a glaze (I brushed melted butter over mine and then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over mine) or else they will be really plain and dry.

While this doughnut didnt taste like a fried doughnut, it was still rather delightful. I followed the recipe exactly and am quite happy with how they turned out. The only thing I did different was used a mini bunt pan since I didnt have a doughnut pan. This didnt effect the out come of the doughnut what so ever. I also made some with cinnamon and sugar. I did this by greasing the mini bunts and they sprinkling them with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. After I put the batter inside, I then sprinkled the top with the cinnamon as well and they are delicious. I will make these again~ Thanks for the recipe!!

These turned out wonderful! Very light and tasty! I used white whole wheat flour and sour milk, and replaced the shortening with butter. Then baked for 9-10 minutes at 385 degrees. The higher temp seemed to help them bake more fully. I topped them with a crunch topping made of toasted coconut, brown sugar, a little cinnamon and powdered sugar, lightly processed in my food processor. Glaze donuts first, then roll in topping.  They looked and tasted wonderful!

The taste of these donuts was wonderful, however the texture was not all that great. I found them to be very tough in the end and were much too dense even for cake donuts. If you make these I really would suggest being careful to only mix until the dry ingredients are wet and  not anymore. Mixing until "well blended" will only make them hard and chewy.

These are very good!  They taste just like an old-fashioned donut without the grease! ;o)  I used a cupcake pan -- 1/4 dough, 2 TBS Strawberry Jam then topped with more dough.  YUM!!!  Had to increase baking time to 13 minutes.

The batter smells delicious, but that's the only good thing about this recipe.  The doughnuts had the rubbery texture and the egg-y flavor of a bagel. I was very disappointed!

My family is going to LOVE me when they get home today!  These turned out great!  Followed the recipe as is, except that I baked them at 400 for 10 min.  Now I am going to try making some substitutions to make them safe for my gluten/dairy free girlie and see how they turn out.

The taste of these donuts is just amazing! Sooo soo good! You HAVE to have a donut pan. I tried with just a cookie sheet and I got something similar to donut chips- which were still really wonderful taste, just flat. Local cooking store didn't have the pan but I found it on ebay. Give them a try! They are wonderful!

This is the EXACT same recipe that came with my mini donut pan the only differencr was 2 TBSP butter melted. I tried that one 3 times and I wasn't to impressed with the results. So I played around with this one. 1 and 3/4 cup flour (no subs, I tried) 3 eggs, 2TBSP butter melted. I skipped the icing and brushed mine with melted buter and dipped in cinnamon sugar. With these changes my donuts were much better. If your expecting a light airy donut then you better go to Timmies as these are not that..more of a homemade bun texture. Best eaten when hot from the oven.

They turned out quite dry because I was unable to tell that they were done because they looked white still. Take them out at the right time! I didn't have any confectioners sugar so I dipped them in butter and rolled in sugar/cinnamon/brown sugar. Next time I will make the glaze! BTW, this is the same exact recipe I found on my doughnut pan box. Interesting. . .

I am new to making doughnuts in my new doughnut pan and so far have only tried the chocolate mix and plain doughnut recipe both from King Arthur Flour.  My family was very happy with both until we tried this recipe - it is much better!  I made the recipe with the changes recommended by Jmyslin.  Some of the doughnuts were dipped in butter and rolled in cinnamon sugar (wow were they good) and the others frosted w/ chocolate.  Doughnut has great texture, not as heavy as the ones I made previously.  This is our family's new favorite.

Since I wanted doughnuts but didn't want to fry them and don't own a doughnut pan, I decided to make these in my mini muffin pan. They baked up in the specified time. Although the tops still looked undone - when I touched it, it was finished. I also melted some butter and tossed it in cinnamon sugar cause I wanted a quick treat. These were really good! They were more dense than I expected them to be, but still very soft and delicious. I will make these anytime I want a quick treat. Thanks!

I just tried these oven baked donuts and they are delicious! They are light, not heavy like cake donuts. I read the previous reviews and did use buttermilk and 2T of melted butter in place of shortening and regular milk. I have a donut pan that makes six donuts. I filled the cuts up 3/4, baked at 400 degrees for 8-9 minutes, no longer. Let them set for a few minutes before you take out of the pan. The next six donuts I added cocoa to the batter to make chocolate donuts! Delicious! I made the glaze as the recipe calls for and dipped the donuts in sprinkles. I will definitely make these donuts again and I recommend them to you too.

Pretty darn good baked doughnuts! I used coconut oil instead of shortening and buttered the pan instead of sprayed. I used a mini-doughnut pan and yielded 40+ . Frosting was bad so I added 2 tbsp melted butter, some cinnamon, pinch of salt, and just over a tsp of maple syrup... it came out great! After dipping the doughnuts I put them in the fridge for a couple minutes to solidify the frosting. I would definitely make these again, they are a huge hit.

I don't like cake donuts -- I'm a Krispy Kreme girl m'self.  So it was with some trepidation that I tried these, and I'm very glad that I did!  I halved the recipe just to try it out, and because CHOCOLATE, I used 3/4 C flour and 1/4 C cocoa powder.  I also took jmyslin's suggestion and made them in gem pans hit with a shot of Pam; I, too, used butter rather than shortening (HATE shortening!!!), and I used buttermilk in place of milk simply because I had it on hand.  I only added a dash of the spices, and I used vanilla instead of almond extract in the glaze.  They are nothing like the cake donuts from the bakery, more like a dense cupcake, which is probably why I like them.  Once the rest of the world gets tired of their electric donut makers and starts donating them to Goodwill, I'll pick one up for cheap and make "official" donuts with this recipe.

With a few changes this recipe turned out really well.  I followed others suggestions and used buttermilk and melted butter in place of the shortening. I put all the batter into a plastic bag and snipped off a corner to make it easier to pipe into the wells of the pan.  I used a donut pan and baked them at 400 degrees F for 8-9 minutes.  I let them cool and dunked them into a chocolate frosting I made using 2 TBS melted butter, 2 TBS hot, 2 TBS cocoa powder and about a cup and a forth of powdered sugar.  The frosting/glaze will set up quickly.  Delicious!

How adorable! I used vanilla almond milk instead of dairy and subbed the shortening with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Recipe yielded 4 dozen mini donuts, perfectly put into the pan via the ziploc bag method. I made a chocolate glaze from a handful of dark chocolate chips melted with a tablespoon of butter. I glazed half with that chocolate (even added some sprinkles to a few) and half with the dipped in melted butter then tossed in powdered sugar idea. The later produced a great glaze. Just tossed in powdered sugar was good too, but super messy. None if them were pretty, but they are flying off the plates!

I made these in my bakery years ago, in muffin tins.  I dipped them in melted butter while still warm and rolled them in cinn & wh sugar. I could not keep them in stock, and now I make them for pleasure....a big hit where ever they go!!!

I followed the directions given by Jmyslm, the pastry chef, except that I didn't omit the cinnamon.  I used Penzey's Ceylon cinnamon, which is VERY mild...  "I like to add 2T. melted butter instead of shortening, omit the cinnamon in the batter, use buttermilk instead of milk and bake them at 400' for 8 to 9 minutes. Once finished, a quick dunk in melted butter and a roll in white sugar, granulated brown sugar and cinnamon (combined of course) makes a donut my customers crave."

I've tried lots of recipes for baked donuts, never finding one I considered to be worth the effort.  This one is fantastic, although still not like a fried donut.

after making the first batch I had to check the temperature of the oven since they didnot rise very much. The stated temp in the recipe was 325 degrees for 10 minutes. After checking my other recipes for baked donuts they all used 425 degrees for 10 min. I tried this recipe at 425 degrees for 10 minutes and it worked perfectly. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk, cake flour instead of regular flour and melted butter or margerine instead of shortening. Used cinnamon and nutmeg and half white sugar and half brown sugar. very good

This were excellent. I did use buttermilk instead of milk and 2T of melted butter instead if shortening. As one reviewer suggested cooked at 375 for 12 minutes they are fabulous!!!

We have a mini donut maker and I have been testing recipes since Christmas to find one that works well and tastes good. This one turned out perfectly!! The taste amazing :-) I may add some extra cinnamon next time just for more of the taste, but it is also great the way it is. We split the glaze up into 2 cups, one with strawberry extract and one with the almond with a little dark chocolate cocoa powder added. Fabulous! Thanks!

I didnt use shortening, instead I did 2TBSP of melted butter. I thought these tasted like muffins and lacked the right texture/ taste of a classic cake doughnut. Over all this doughnut was just OK for us.

I made my first batch according the the directions except for subbing butter for the shortening and it came out very well.  They are different than traditional donuts, but you should expect that when making these.  In the second batch I used Splenda for the sugar and they came out much more dense and chewy.  I would not recommend making this substitution!

Used this recipe to try out my 2 new mini donut pans. They were okay and fun to make but I'll look for another recipe. I wouldn't call these "fluffy". I wanted a fluffy donut like you get in a shop. If I cant have that then I'd rather go for a denser cake donut. These were pale as reviews said but they looked fine to me...especially once glazed. I shook half in a baggie with cinnamon and sugar, it stuck well if done when the donuts were hot. Glaze was ok, I had to add more liquid. Dipped the tops in it then let dry on a rack. Glaze set up nicely! I thought this recipe was very easy to make but I just want a different consistency next time

I didn't have a doughnut pan to hand, so I used a normal cupcake pan and it seemed to work.  The doughnuts took twice as long to cook as the recipe indicated, and even then I think they might have benefited from a few minutes more.  They tasted vaguely doughnutty hot, but as soon as they cooled down the flavor was mostly soft.  All in all though, these reminded me of a (rather nice) cake.  I liked them, but they were not quite what I was looking for.

Delicious!  I used butter instead of shortening and omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg.  The donuts came out great in my baking pan, though they took closer to 18 minutes to bake.  I also made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze to ice these with, which came out wonderful!

I cut the recipe in half and then added two eggs by accident!  They still came out great with some added protein.  I used a mini-doughnut maker and they did brown on one side.  I substituted orange flower extract for the vanilla extract and made a chocolate glaze with milk, cocoa and confectioners' sugar.  We liked them best plain but my sons (5 and 6) liked the chocolate glaze with sprinkles.  The orange added a little something to the fresh ground nutmeg.  Worth a try; each round of doughnuts lasted 30 seconds!

Woudldn't change a thing to this recipe.  Very good doughnuts and works perfectly in my pan.  The only difference was we dipped our slightly cool doughnuts in melted butter and then shook them in a bag of sugar and cinnamon or powder sugar and cinnamon.  They won't last long

I was so excited when I got my doughnut pan. With high expectations, I followed the recipe exactly. The results are spongy, bland bread products that are nothing like the cake doughnuts I get at the local shops . I will not be making these again. I would recommend looking elsewhere, but hey, individual results may very, so give it a whirl.

I received a donut maker for Christmas and although it came with wonderful creative recipes, it did not contain one for a plain donut.  This recipe was easy, delicious and gobbled up!!  I love vanilla and cinnamon, so I doubled both of those ingredients in the batter.  I also doubled the almond extract in the glaze - which is adds the final touch to the donuts!

They were nice and fluffy but lacked any taste. We added more vanilla and still tasted like nothing. Next time we are going to substitute butter for the shortening. Overall, not bad, but if you are looking for something with flavor, keep looking!   As a note, we made this with Arrowhead Mills gluten free flour (which we use for ALL baking) and we added about 2 1/2 cups flour to make it the right consistency. Plus we also used a plug in donut machine, we didn't bake them and they were fine. They cooked right up in about 2 minutes a batch.

This recipe is great (for a baked donut - which is not as good regular fried). Cook until they spring when you push them (they won't be dark). Also - the chocolate glaze is SOOOOO good. Tastes just like the chocolate glaze at Krispy Kreme. Yum!

This was my first time making doughnuts, and it was quick and easy.  The batter was a little hard to work with, and my doughnuts came out a little chewy.  But overall they taste very good.  I brushed mine with melted butter and then topped half with sprinkles and half with cinnamon/sugar.

These were really good.  I did omit the nutmeg because I don't like it but they turned out wonderfully.

This recipe is delicious.  They are more muffin like than doughnut like, but still good.  I made the glaze also.  Very good!

they were weird and rubbery.  tasted too much like a muffin, with a texture like a gross little frozen bagel.  i think part of hte problem was too little butter.

Would give this recipe a miss. Have just made these donuts using my donut pan [have lost my original recipe which came with pan-most annoying!] following the ingredients and method exactly and I have to say that the end result were heavy little rubber cake type things. odd!

I recently bought one of those mini-donut pans and as it did not come with a recipe went looking for one. This is the first one I found that had 'normal' cake-like ingredients so I went for it. The heck! The batter was so thick and dry it was a trial to get it into those little donut cavities and they came out all warty and lumpy on top, because they didn't smooth out. Also, they were very very dry. Guess I'll go look for some more recipes...

Excellent. Used apple pie spice blend, and butter instead of shortening.  Finished with a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar.  Turned out perfect first time.  Recipe made a dozen.

I didn’t have shortening, so followed another reviewer’s suggestion to replace it with 2tbs of butter. They were really flavorful, not like the donuts I’ve tried to make in the past. I also read in a different recipe to be careful not to over mix or you’ll get tough donuts. I was careful with that for this recipe & they were truly light & fluffy.

I made it with the modifications suggested (no cinnamon, buttermilk and 400 for 9 minutes).  I used my mini muffin pan.  These are a bit more dense than the shop kind but that may be the result of baking and not frying.  Very filling.

Recently purchased a donut/beignet pan and wanted to try it out.  This recipe looked easy and the dounts were baked.   I made a half recipe and added a TBL of sour cream.  I also used a sandwich bag filled with the batter to fill the donut pan.  I mixed the dry ingredients with a whisk in a large bowl then did the same for the liquid ingredients in another bowl.  Then I slowly added the wet to dry ingredients making sure I used a light touch.  Not over mixing is the key.  Thank you to the reviewer who made that suggestion.  Baked at 400 degrees in a convection oven and did they ever rise!  Took about 10-12 minute to  reach a light brown top.   When they were cooling I sprinkled the donuts with confectioner's sugar.   My husband is a born and raised Southerner and he said they reminded him of the donuts/beignets he ate in New Orleans.

Just made these...ate FIVE already!  I followed the recipe using buttermilk and  MELTED butter without cinnamon.  Will probably increase nutmeg to 1/2 tsp next time.  I used a BABY spoon to fill donut pan.  Dough very stiff almost like a biscuit dough consistency ( but not quite), but came out perfect after 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  I melted butter, dipped tops in butter then dipped  12 in a mixture of brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon.  Made 17 donuts.  Dipped last five in powdered sugar.  Easy recipe and very good.

This was a very nice baked donut. The first time I made the donut I followed the directions and it turned out very good. I did bake it at 400 degrees for 8 minutes. The next time I added 1 tablespoon vinegar to the measuring cup and added milk to make 3/4 cup of  buttermilk. I melted 2 T butter, added the eggs, milk and 4 oz. of sour cream and stirred them up and added that to the dry ingredients. I left out the cinnamon.  I used the chocolate ganache recipe  from this site and topped that with chopped walnuts.

This is a good versatile recipe.  I've made this a couple of times in my mini donut maker, and both times they turned out very nice. The texture is like a Tim Bit/donut hole. This time I tried replacing half the sugar with mashed, ripe bananas and added a few chocolate chips. Turned out great!

Just tried this recipe straight from my emil inbox. Not a bad cake base for any substitutions or additions you want to do for it. This one kind of reminds me of the old fashioned cake donut Dukin makes or used to make in the 80s. 
What i did was used a miniature bundt cake pan. What i found is that you need to adjust the bake time to about 18-20 minutes, or until light brown, as mine were still not light golden brown after the 8-10 minutes. 
You don't need to worry about whether or not you have a donut pan. Just use any pan. Its all good. 
I don't like the glaze made with water. I prefer mine to be milk based. I wasn't in the mood for the spices, but for the holidays its an excellent blend. I also drizzled the glaze over them as soon as they came out of the oven while they were still warm to allow it to absorb into the donut like they did at Dunkin. (I used to work for them years ago).
I plan to try cocoa powder next time instead of these spices and going to try margarine instead of the shortening. 
Over all, not bad.

This is so good! I followed the suggestion on the first comment to omit the cinnamon and replace the shortening with butter. I also dipped it in melted butter and cinnamon-sugar after it was baked. It was sooo good! It disappeared in minutes before I could even take a picture. Will definitely make this again, and again, and again. This recipe is a keeper.

This is the recipe that came with the non-stick doughnut pan I ordered from Amazon.  I made it last night exactly as written.  The doughnuts were dense and flavorless.  I tried one, gave one to someone else to try and I'm moving on to find another recipe.

I thought it was just "okay". Had kind of a spongy texture, which I wasn't fond of. And was a little too sweet for me. I guess it just wasn't the recipe I was looking for. Sorry.

I made these for breakfast this morning and they were yummy!  I took the pastry chef's suggestions and used sour milk and butter and rolled in the cinnamon/sugar/brown sugar mixture.  I don't have a donut pan so I just baked these in a regular sized muffin tin at 400 degrees and they were very tasty.  I can see how baking in a donut pan or a mini muffin pan might be better since then you could coat the whole thing in the cinnamon/sugar mix.  I will definitely be making these again.

I used "sour" milk and decided to omit the cinnamon and nutmeg after making one batch with and one without. Since I was making mini donuts, I followed others advice and baked at 400 for just 5 minutes. They will not look brown at all, but as long as they spring back when touched they are done. I'll use this recipe again!

My kids ate these up!!  I followed Jmyslin's amendments and they turned out nice and perfect.  My kids ask for donuts all the time but I hate buying the fried donuts for them, so they only get them on occasion.  I felt good about making these for my 3 kids this morning.  I made the white glaze icing with vanilla (I can't find my almond) and I also made a Chocolate glaze with 1/2 tsp of maple extract.  Not  sure if I will use maple again but it was good just not the chocolate I was looking for.  Super Easy to make and quick to bake.  I used a mini muffin pan and NOW I need a donut pan!

I have to say I wasn't super impressed with these. They turned out kinda like sponge cake which was not what I was going for. My hubby loves donuts and I was wanting to make something more like the heavy cake donuts that Dunkin makes. He said he liked them ok anyway.

I took the milk out and put buttermilk instead (another reviewer had mentioned doing this), left out the cinnamon and it was great!  I received a donut maker for Mother's Day and the recipe that it came with was terrible!  So glad that I found this one.  I dipped the tops in melted butter when they came out and then dipped them into cinnamon sugar (which is why I left cinnamon out of the actual recipe) right away.  I can hardly wait til my daughter gets home from school because she'll be so surprised!

This makes for a pretty good doughnut.  I made mine 3 ways.  Chocolate glazed, powdered sugar, and cinnamon & sugar.

If you add some soluble coffee crystals to the wet mixture, they dissolve and add a wonderful kick to the cupcakes. Great addition to you coffee in the morning.

I just made this after I got my new donut pan.  I changed the milk to sour milk by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice and milk to make 3/4 cup.  It's light and fluffy.

Best baked donut recipe I've found. I followed the advice of another reviewer to use melted butter instead of shortening and to use buttermilk instead of milk. For my glaze I used cream instead of water and only a drop of almond extract. I did half like this, and then added some chopped semisweet chocolate and dipped the rest. Heaven. I had to send them with my boyfriend to his work so that I wouldn't eat them all!

These turned out pretty tasty, by themselves I loved the flavor. Not as good as fried up donuts from my favorite shop, but they'll do the trick when I want to make something sweet at home. I'm not really a fan of the glaze though, personally I found it too sweet.

These are good... some people said that they are not donut-like.  I think that is just because they are baked, not fried.  I baked them in my mini donut maker.  I used 1 cup of milk because the batter seemed a little thick.  I used butter instead of shortening and I increased it to 3 Tbsp.  I also added chocolate shaving to the batter.  I frosted them with Nutella and added more chocolate shavings on top.

I took another viewers suggestion and baked doughnuts whole in a mini cupcake pan.  I made the following changes: I used 1 1/2 cups of white flour, 1/2 cup of cake flour, added 1/4 tea of soda, used buttermilk instead of milk and used melted butter not shortening.  It took longer to bake, about 13-14 mins, very good

I was disappointed in this recipe.  For all the rave reviews, I thought it was kind of boring and plain.  I think it could probably be made more exciting by adding different flavors, but it's also a little dry, so it definitely needs more shortening/butter.  Not terrible ... just not what I hoped it would be.

Thanks to all the reviews I was able to modify my recipe.  Left out the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Used butter in place of shortening.  I also used 2/3 cup of pastry flour in place of regular flour, I wanted a softer consistency to the donuts. I would've added more pastry flour but that's all I had on hand.  We got a mini donut maker and ended up making 38 mini's.   Found a chocolate glaze recipe on this site to dip the little guys in.  Finished with sprinkles!  Yum yum.

Ok, so I bought a donut pan a while back and tried the recipe that came with it and they were HORRIBLE.  So I have been in search of a good recipe and came across this one.  Read the reviews and used some of the tips and I have to say...I was very pleased!  Loved the pastry chef's tips, so that is what I did.  I didn't care for the plain glaze, but I did make a chocoloate one that was really good, and the cinnamon/sugar/brown sugar topping is perfect!  I brushed with butter and coated them well.  Whoever said these are dry must have  overbaked them, and if you didn't get good results, then it is operator error...sorry!  Mine were quite most and fluffly, just like the recipe says.  You can tweak the flavor of this donut for sure.  Going into my file for keeps!

These were slightly more dense than I was hoping for, but making the changes described in other posts (buttermilk instead of milk, butter instead of shortening. I cooked at 400 degrees for 9 minutes. Really tasty with a cinnamon sugar coating!

This was really good for a baked doughnut. I bought one of the doughnut pans and didn't like the way the first batch I made turned out so I haven't done it since finding this receipe. I did make several changes based on what I had on hand. First I used self rising flour so I did not add the baking powder or salt. I also used light Agave Syrup 1/2 cup. I increased the spices to 1/2 teaspoon and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice. I also used Coffee Matte's Italian Sweet Cream instead of Milk. I placed the mix in a 14" pastry bag and piped each hole twice. They rose nice and high and looked liked fried doughnuts. With the next batch I didn't have enough batter so I could only pipe around once and they looked like homemade doughnuts they were also more densed then the others which were very light for a baked doughnut. Will be making these again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great base recipe!  I made a few changes to make it more to my family taste.  I doubled the cinnamon and instead of using eggs, I used pureed pears.  (1/4 cup per egg replaced).  I also made a hazelnut glaze using sugar-free syrups made for coffee drinks.  My kids loved them!

Eh. I wasn't expecting krispy kreme style, but I was expecting a just okay cake doughnut and I'm not sure if I even got that. Maybe I messed something up? Maybe b/c I don't have a doughnut pan? That's why I didn't give it under 4 stars. But it was kinda ick and tasted kinda like a plain dough brick that sat in your belly and made it hurt. I think I'm just gonna give up on a decent for you doughnut idea, should've known better!

I don't know about "fluffy"... in my opinion, they would be a better consistency inside if you use a faster oven - maybe 350 or 375. I say this because when they were done in the middle, they were not brown at all - not even a tint, and slightly dry inside. Next time I will try the hotter oven for a shorter time period, and I imagine they will be fabulous. Great flavor, though! This is definitely a muffin recipe, by the way, so if you are looking for the yeast-y kind of donut, it's not for you.

i'm usually a really good baker, but these just didn't have enough moisture in them when i went by the recipe. i had to add about an extra 1/4 to 1/3 c of milk just to get this dough off my mixer whisk. i dont have the pan, but a similar shallow muffin pan, i just used an apple corer to make holes once they firmed a bit. they have a decent flavor, but not what i was expecting. very dry and absolutely not gonna be able to coat with any dry sugar or cinnamon. i my brush a little milk over them while warm and see what it does to roll in sugar  mix then.

These are very yummy.  I used buttermilk, half wheat flour, only a heaping 1/2c of sugar, and one egg and they still turned out very light with a good flavor.  Thanks for the idea of dipping in melted butter and then in cinnamon/suger.

The glaze was perfect. The chocolate glaze was great too. They tasted just like doughnuts- but they were denser. Heathier too since they were baked. I think next time I'll leave out the cinnamon and nutmeg since I'm not a fan of either. Thanks!

These are only okay. Very dry and I added a 1/4 cup more of half and half. I substituted the milk for half and half. I liked the ones rolled in cinn and sugar better than the ones I glazed.

they randomly taste horribly metallic/bitter. not every one, and not all bits of any one. i'm guessing the 2 tsp of baking powder wasn't mixed in completely?

i added more brown sugar, flour and milk to the remaining batter - trying to at least get the horrid taste thinned out. we'll see what the next batch brings.

do we think the amount of baking powder is too much?

We thought these were too cake-like.  I know, the recipe says "cake doughnuts".. but I was hoping for the consistency of the cake doughnuts you get at the store or in a bakery.  A little denser.  My husband & I also thought the almond flavor was WAY too strong in the icing and the nutmeg was too noticable in the batter.  Thanks for sharing, but I'll keep searching for the perfect cake doughnut recipe for us.

For those who have a hard time with this recipe, test your baking powder before baking. I’ll share a new review with fresh baking powder next time.

I'm a Pampered Chef consultant and was looking for donut recipes to use in our Batter Mix & Dispenser and Donut Baking Pan.  This recipe worked great, except it was a bit too thick, so mix the wet and dry ingredients in separate Batter Bowls before adding to the Dispenser.  Also, substituted melted butter for the shortening.  My daughters rated it 5 stars, so there you go!!

My Home Care Giver made these exactly as written. I just can't find anything I'd have her change. While they were yummy, we think we'd try icing next time rather than the glaze.

I followed the recipe exactly for the donuts.  I didn’t have any almond extract for the glaze, so I used vanilla extract instead.  They turned out really good!  Next time, I will make sure to have some almond extract!

I had family that said they tasted more like cupcakes, from "those are the best doughnuts I've ever had!"  I must have a larger donut pan, and this was my first time using it, but mine cooked from 14-17 minutes and I cooked them at 375 degrees.  I divided the dough and half of it I added a large, heaping spoonful of hershey's cocoa and everyone liked it.  I left out the nutmeg and the cinnamon, added the 3/4 cup clabbered milk, and used 2 T of melted butter instead of the shortening.  When the plain donuts were done I dipped them in butter then cinnamon sugar.  For the chocolate I halved the ingredients for the glaze and that worked well.

Amazing. I took another posters suggestions and made slight changes of my own. Being December 1st, I kept in the Cinnamon and Nutmeg, and substituted store bought eggnog in place of the milk. 
Subtitutions:
3/4 c Eggnog in place of milk
1 tsp Coconut Extract in place of vanilla
2 Tbl Melted Salted Butter in place of shortening
for the glaze:
+2 Tbl of confectioners sugar 
   I found my glaze was watery thin so I thickened it slightly
I baked it at 400 degrees for 8 - 9 minutes using a Wilton 6 well doughnut pan.

All together a tasty recipe. Served with a cold glass of spiced eggnog. An instant favorite in our house.

After reading reviews I did change the recipe. I used butter instead of shortening and yogurt instead of milk. I thought it strange to mix the sugar with the flour so I did it the traditional way. Mix dry ingredients and then cut the butter into the dry mix. Once the butter has been mixed in I beat in the wet ingredients/including the sugar. The mix get super fluffy and thick. Pipe into pan.  These tasted just like real donuts and not like muffins.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except I needed to adapt it for high elevation.  I did have to bake them a bit longer than I expected, but these turned out amazing.  My husband ate four in one sitting!  (He loves donuts).  The flavor was really good.  I will be making these again!

I just made these and was not too impressed. So, I changed the recipe a bit by using melted butter for the shortening, adding 1/2 cup of sour cream and I doubled the vanilla extract. Much better with the changes, but I will play around with this recipe a bit more as I still think they need more flavor! This recipe made 24  cake donuts. I glazed them and added sprinkles to half.  They looked very pretty in a covered cake stand.

This is a keeper.   Change the milk for buttermilk give the donut a tangy distinctive flavor.   We don’t like cinnamon so I omit that.    When they were ready I dipped in melted butter and sugar.  My friends devoured them and ask for the recipe

It's my new recipe! I like the fluffiness because it has twice the baking powder. I think the next time I will use butter instead of shortening to make it a little richer.

Very disappointing.  I was super excited about trying this recipe.  The "doughnuts" tasted like glazed pancakes.  Not good at all.  I'll keep looking on Allrecipes to find the perfect doughnut recipe.

Good and simple. I over-filled doughnut pan so it took longer to get them done.  I like the almond flavored glaze. Next time, I will try butter milk and increase oven temp to 400.

I typically try to make new recipes as written first but I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to make do. I didn't have a single grain of sugar in the house so used the equivalent of Splenda brown sugar blend and used buttermilk instead of plain milk. They turned put beautifully. I melted butter, dipped both sides of the donut in it then shook in a paper bag of powdered sugar. Delicious. Grandkids loved them. Great basic recipe and I see where you can make a lot if different flavors. Next I'm trying lemon.

They don't have the consistency or taste of a cake donut.  Definitely spongy/rubbery and the taste is weird:  like it's too sweet and the nutmeg doesn't blend with the other flavors.  They're okay, but not what I was looking for.

I wouldn't use "fluffy" to describe these doughnuts; they were more like dense bread.  I always follow a new recipe to the letter and then "tweak" it to our taste.  There was no tweaking this one :( Three stars because the kids still ate them, covered in icing and sprinkles.

Tried this recipe today.  Did not have a donut pan, so I improvised.  I used a regular muffin pan with rolled up balls of non stick aluminum foil placed in the middle of each space in order to make the holes.  Worked okay, but they were more like half muffin-half donut when finished, so muff-nuts or Dough-ffins were born! :)
The end product tasted fine, I would dial down the nutmeg and cinnamon just a bit next time, maybe add a little brown sugar to improve taste and cut down on the nutmeg/cinnamon after-taste.  Also used leftover cake frosting mixed with a little hot water to glaze them with.  Very yummy.
My daughter loved them, so that tells me this recipe is a keeper!  
Thanks for sharing!

I didn't make any changes to it. The best part of the recipe for me is that it is very easy to mix up and make. That said, it doesn't have much flavour. Might try a few variations with more spices or cocoa powder the next time.

Flavor was good, but rather heavy not very fluffy. 
Presentation was poor....one side was browned the other was pale and sticky. 
Doubt I'll make these again. Too many other, better choices.

Ick!  It's an insult to donuts everywhere to call what this recipe makes "donuts".  I followed the recipe exactly but the end result was flavorless, bready, thick, hardly edible pieces of junk.  Nobody in my household liked them...although they looked pretty.  The search for a good baked donut recipe continues...

Made these today and they are delicious.As in my case, if you don't have a donut pan, just use a muffin pan. Same results just a different shape. 
Also I cut the recipe in half, makes an even dozen. Tastes just like the cake donuts I used to make for the bakery I used to work at.

These are delicious!  I just bought a donut pan and wanted to try it out.  They took about 15-20 minutes to bake.  I dipped them in the glaze while hot.  Very, very tasty!  I got 15 donuts out of the recipe.  I added melted butter instead of shortening.

9.3.16   First, this is VERY easy to make with ingredients most of us already have on hand.  Instead of round doughnuts, I used a doughnut twist pan which gave me six doughnuts.  Used half the glaze recipe, and just drizzled it onto the doughnuts rather than dipping them into it.  Texture was more dense than I would have liked, but they still were tasty (and lower in fat since you’re baking, not frying).

I would probably use a pince of nutmeg and I put flaxseed meal to make it healthier. So it wasn't so delicious but the kids liked it. Also I used coconut oil instead of shortening. Maybe next time I would use melted butter.

just not for us.  Wonderful suggestions by previous reviews which I followed.  In the end this just wasn't our thing.  End result was pretty dense and bland.

This is a great base recipe as/is!  I decided to make these diet friendly and used Carbalose low carb flour, Sweet Perfection as the sugar, 1/2 cup almond milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream for the milk and 2 tblsp of butter instead of shortening.  They turned out delicious although I will use maybe another 1/4 of the sugar substitute.  For the glaze I just used butter, cinnamon and the sugar substitute.  A great low carb, sugar free treat!

I used the suggestions to use butter and buttermilk and leave out the spices.  The kids didn't complain but the adults all thought they were "ok."  One adult said "it tastes sort of like a pound cake.  Sweet enough but not overly sweet."

One taste and your addicted to this confection. It is almost as good as Gordon Ramsay's best  hamburger . although, it would be nice if the glaze would be thicker. so, i would just add a little more powdered sugar. :)

I used the pastry chefs changes and the result was a  a fluffy and tasty donut from my donut pan. Resting the dough with the buttermilk addition is key. 
I am a donut addict; I eat more than I should, but try hard not to eat too many on a weekly basis. This could change with this recipe.

Since I've never made these before, I followed the recipe exactly.  The "fluffy" doughnuts were anything but and the flavor was a disappointment.   Even the frosting couldn't save them.  No one  liked them.  If this is an example of what I can expect, I may never make baked doughnuts again.

Made recipe as written except used 2 tbsp butter, as was suggested in the comments. They came out tasting pretty plain and of a doughy-denser consistency.  The almond in the icining was way too strong.

Got this recipe to try my new doughnut baking pan and first try they were perfect.  Texture and taste is excellent.  The batter is a little thick so I added two or three tablespoons more milk while mixing.  Just finished my second time and added some cocoa powder and again perfect.  I am now looking forward to the variations that Jmyslin posted.

We enjoyed the texture of this donut. It turns out a lot like a regular cake donut. We baked them in a Wilton long john pan.  The only thing we didn't like was the nutmeg. Next time we make this recipe, we'll leave it out.

Did not have a great consistency, felt rather dense and the taste was average. Used my special donut pans and was hoping for a lot more.

This was my first donut baking experiment and I thought they were great! I will try using buttermilk next time. My husband loved them and the glaze was simple and the best part! We added pineapple juice to the glaze and it helped make the donut softer as I baked it a minute or so too long.  We used a giant donut pan and mini muffin pans. Loved them both! So fun!

I liked this a lot! Tastes more like cake than greasy doughnut. It was a refreshing change!

Great doughnuts! Used 2 tablespoons of melted butter instead of shortening as suggested and baked in the oven using round bun tins (not muffin tins, but the small patty tins)! Turned out great in 10 mins. Brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with caster sugar they tasted great eaten warm.  Made 24 in total so going to have the rest for tea spread with choc spread and sprinkles, yummy! Great with a cup of coffee too!

I made a small batch by adjusting servings.  I had craved doughnuts.  As I didn't own the proper pan, I used the muffin tin.  My son said it tasted just like the commercial glazed ones.

I sell home baked items at our local farmers market.  These are much better than the fried doughnuts for that purpose because they can be made ahead (and even frozen before frosting).  To avoid melting in the sun, I melt chocolate chips and drizzle on the doughnuts.  I have one out as an example and keep the rest (packaged two at a time) in a cooler.  They sell out almost every time!

This is a winner! Whole family loved them. I have wanted to try making baked doughnuts with my doughnut pan and this recipe was so good. The doughnuts were moist and tasted perfect even without any topping. (although rolling them in cinnamon and sugar was soooo good)

I took the advice of other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening and used melted butter and almond extract to toss them in before tossing in cinnamon sugar. Also, I used mini muffin trays and cooked at 400 for about 8 minutes. They were AMAZING. I'm going to try making them again but healthier, but they were awesome

Very good.  The family loved them.  We all tweak the recipe a bit so this is my tweak...Used butter like every one else.  Made the soured milk. Increased temp to 375...here's the reason why...I don't have donut pans so I made them in my muffin tins and made sure I only used about half a cup of batter per "doffin" (that is my made up word for half donut half muffin) baked for 12 minutes and dipped in butter then cinnamon sugar...yum.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm sorry, I just didn't care for the flavor of this recipe.  I even tried the altered recipe of the pastry chef and didn't care for the flavor of the doughnut.  I just wanted a nice flavorful doughnut.  I didn't want to have to add lots of sugar, whether granulated or powered, or coat with a glaze to get any flavor with lots of carbs.  Won't be making this one again.

Pretty good for baked donuts.  :)  Made in a mini cupcake pan rather than a donut pan.  Makes about 30 mini cupcakes/donut holes.  Added a little more powdered sugar to the frosting than what was listed.  Would be good dipped in chocolate frosting too!  They don't keep as well as traditional donuts though (probably because they're not covered in oil), so plan to eat them with 24-48 hours.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I used buttermilk) and thought these came out dry and not very tasty.  Luckily my kids didn't care, but I was super disappointed and will not use this recipe again.
