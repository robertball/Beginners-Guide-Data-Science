I made exactly as the recipe stated. I did experience the syrup pooling at the bottom at first, but after leaving it to soak in overnight the syrup absorbed and it became sticky and delicious! Well worth the trouble of tracking down the orange blossom water. I tried to bring it to a work potluck, but my family had at it first and left no survivors. One thing to watch out for is time; it can go from golden brown to blackened brown very quickly so keep an eye out after 45 minutes or so.

This was the best baklava that I have ever eaten, and surprisingly simple to make.

I made this as stated with a bake time of 40 minutes.  I used a bunch of orange zest instead of orange blossom water, and while the sauce did pool, it had completely absorbed by the time the baklava had cooled completely. Definitely will be throwing this into the recipe box!

I don't like how this turned out for me. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The taste is fine, very sweet, but what can you expect from baklava. I like the interesting taste the orange flower water adds, although it gets lost once it's poured over the baklava. The top crisped up way too much, and I didn't even leave it in the oven for the required amount of time, so the liquid didn't absorb properly.  Also, there is too much liquid, it's pooling at the bottom of the pan. .. probably because it didn't absorb properly. I'll stick to supermarket baklava, that way I just buy what I want and am not stuck with copious amounts of it. Sorry Chef John - not a winner.

This is the best baklava recipe. I didn't need to change a thing. I'll definitely make it again, and again. God bless the Greeks for giving us Baklava. Sooo delicious.

Good recipe, but keep an eye on it while baking. I took mine out around 40 minutes and it was already overdone, so it's a little bitter and overly brown on the bottom. Take it out when it's light golden brown and you'll be fine.

Really great technique for making homemade phyllo! I added elderflower cordial to the syrup and did a mix of almonds and pistachios

With less servings, I would recommend only 1 filo dough piece per layer instead of two per layer

Mm-mm good
This made me look good.  Took liberty with nuts.  Switched to  Almonds and pecans.  Could not find orange flower water.
Will try this again after it arrives,
This is another Chef John recipe for me.

This was good, but too much syrup for my liking. I really love the taste of the orange blossom water. It was a definitely take-away that I'll include in whatever recipe I eventually settle on. Thank you!

Fantastic recipe!
I made this for friends we had over for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  The only change I made was swapping orange juice for the orange blossoms water.  My grocery store didnâ€™t carry it.
I thought the recipe video was very helpful and funny.  
Thanks Chef John!

yes, I will make it again but I would cut the sugar syrup down by 1/2.  The baklava was literally floating in sugar syrup.

I used the store bought dough which made it easy to put together.  The syrup had great flavor but mine was a little thin.  Will reduce the water next time.  Used walnuts, pistachios and pecans.
