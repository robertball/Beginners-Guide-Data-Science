This recipe was a major hit!!! I cant believe how amazing that it came out!!! I did make a couple of changes though like doubling the recipe. I only cooked the noodles and sausage and mixed the rest in a bowl for the oven. I melted a package 1/2 of cream cheese and a little sugar  into the sauce to cut the acid in the sauce. I also used turkey peperoni, texas yellow sweet onion, and sliced spinach (to hide it from the little one), and put the spices on top of the cheese (pepper, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, basil, oregano) and cooked it in the oven in a 9x13 pan for 30-35 mins adding the cheese the last 5-10 mins. Everyone loved this recipe and I've shared it already with family and friends!!! It is a hit for ANY age and can be changed easily for how you love your pizza.

Definitely a keeper! It was so quick & easy and still had lots of flavor. My picky husband even liked it! It would be easy to incorporate onions & peppers to add more veggies. This would make a great busy night meal.

Easy and versatile recipe. Added onion, green pepper, doubled the cheese, and half a cup more sauce. Pretty yummy and a nice change to the ordinary pasta dishes I typically make. Would make again.

My family really liked this.  I made some changes.  I diced part of an onion and sauteed it with the smoked sausage.  I left out the mushrooms and made my own marinara sauce.  I added more smoked sausage so it was really meaty.  My family would love this once a week!

I'm impressed this is pretty tasty!  I added in some minced garlic, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper  to have some extra veggies.  I will probably make this again

I followed recipe as is without the pepperoni and added some onion and green pepper to the sausage.  I put in 1 jar of pasta sauce, it didn't look like enough so I added another half jar. 
 I played around with the spices a little adding basil and oregano.  We couldn't taste the sausage that much, I think I'll try it with only pepperoni next time.

This was good but I definitely think it needs some additional vegetables and spices. Maybe I picked the wrong brand of marinara sauce (Newman’s Own) but if I wasn’t eating a piece of sausage or pepperoni my bite was bland. My husband likes it so that’s a plus but I don’t know how soon it’ll be before I make it again.

Definitely a winner in my book. It was easy to prepare and could lend itself to a great deal of personal touches. Divided into serving size portions this will provide me with a dozen hearty work lunches.

I made a few changes - added cherry tomatoes, onions and spinach instead of mushrooms.  I also added more spices as I enjoy the taste of garlic, basil and oregano.

Great flavor. I didn't have a big enough skillet to finish in the pan.  I had to put it in a casserole dish and cooked it for 20 minutes. Delicious and will definitely make again.

Used medium shells with smoked sausage & small diced ham. Turned out very well and quite tasty. Lots of ways to customize this recipe based on personal preferences. Highly recommend it!

Very quick/easy meal that was a nice change. Very flavorful. I used Barilla Marinara sauce.The only additions I made were adding some chopped onion at the beginning, and I added garlic toward the end when adding the pepperoni. I also use mostaccioli instead of penne because it's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try to make it a little healthier with turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni.

I've made a similar pizza pasta before but the smoked sausage in this kicked it up a notch for me. Loved the flavor it gave this dish. I used smoked turkey sausage and it was great, not greasy at all. Loved the ease of this as well as how quickly it came together. I added way more mozarella than called for, but we like our pizza dishes cheesy! Perfect weeknight meal for a busy family.

Earlier in the week, I made Smoked Sausage and Orzo Stuffed Peppers. Since there are just two of us, I halved the recipe. This was the perfect recipe to use up the rest of the smoked sausage and jar of marinara. We were told in the Cook's Tip we could add other ingredients like peppers, so I added diced yellow peppers and onions. I also used miniature pepperoni because it was what I had in the freezer. It was like eating pizza in a pasta dish.

It doesn't get much easier than this! Super easy and great flavor! I used already sliced mushrooms to make things even easier. All I had to do was boil a pot of water, slice the sausage, and the pepperoni. To make things even one step easier you could always buy the mini pepperoni and then you wouldn't  even have to slice that. I didn't think 2 cups of marinara was going to be enough to cover the pasta but once you get all of the sausage and pepperoni mixed in it is spot on.  This is a perfect recipe for those busy weeknights!
