Yummy base recipe.  I used pepper bacon, and added onion and red peppers.  Left out the egg, personal preference. Used a little less soy sauce, low sodium. This is a do over for sure.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Changed a few things, doubled the sauce recipe with all ingredients except siracha (3 T).  Skipped carrots, used canned corn.  I chopped the bacon prior to cooking and saut√©ed it with chopped onion and chopped water chestnuts.

Instead of buying frozen peas and corn separately, I bought a blend which also included carrots. This was really good but I would have preferred plain white rice over the jasmine but that is just a personal preference. Use whichever kind of rice floats your boat and you have a winner here!
