My family loved it, of course I tweaked it. I used red potatoes and added a slither of butter with the EVO when I saut√©ed the mushrooms. It was wonderful! My husband, 18yr old and twin 9yr olds agreed to replace the normal roasted potatoes I serve with this recipe! (my oldest tweaked it even more at the table by sprinkling Tony Chachere's on his which I tried and it was good as well) We will definitely enjoy this recipe again!

Upfront here:  I had to change up things here because of ingredients available to me.  I've eyed this recipe for a long time now, and there is no way I could find the mushrooms called for.  But I needed to try this recipe (it has been calling to me).  So I had to use dried mushrooms that Trader Joe's has available this during the holidays (porcini, shiitake, black & oyster mushrooms), and they are a far cry from those called for.  And I used red potatoes.  Other than that I used the recipe as written.  I thought it could have used a little more garlic and maybe more seasoning.  It's possible that the other mushrooms would have added that flavor---and I'd love to try them.  I'll keep looking for them.  Thanks, Chef!

This is a great recipe although it is hard to find the fresh mushrooms called for.  I always enjoy Chef John's video's.

so I used this recipe as a jumping off point. I bought 10 oz of crimini and Italian mushrooms and a bag of Trader Joe's fingerling potatoes. To save time I boiled the potatoes while the mushrooms cooked on the stove, then threw them all together in the oven. I only baked them about 15 minutes (did stir them after 8 minutes), then pulled them out and poured the sauce over (2T balsamic, 1T cream sherry, 2t dried tarragon, 1t garlic powder). We liked them but they were a tad sweet. would make again and definitely try to be closer to the original, though this was fine, too.

This recipe was very very good. I did use different mushrooms though because we did not have them out our grocery store. I made this as a side dish for christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Great recipe i will be making it again. Thanks!

For those of you who cannot find the exotic wild mushrooms be glad. If this was done with other mushrooms it would be wonderful. I didn't care for the taste of the wild mushrooms

Like most others, we couldn't find the fresh wild mushrooms the recipe calls for, so made it with what was available. Everyone enjoyed it very much. Cook time was a bit too long for our oven; thankfully I checked in between, as otherwise it would have been overdone.

This recipe doesn't really transform the ingredients. The potatoes taste like potatoes and the mushrooms taste like mushrooms. Overall a not very exciting dish, but not bad tasting.

One of my favorite recipes. Only change would be to cut back on vinegar a bit.

My store did not have the variety of mushrooms so I had to use shitake and baby bella.  The recipe was great, the vinegar adds a nice extra layer of flavor.

I didn't find this too flavorful.  But I like both potatoes and mushrooms, so I ate it!

Made this for an early Christmas family dinner to go alongside prime rib.  No one really liked it.  We found the terragon a little overpowering, but in fairness, we substituted dried for fresh (1:3 ratio), so I'm giving it an extra star, assuming it's better with fresh.

Absolutely the best potatoes! The mushrooms, herbs, and olive oil also pair well with chicken!

Very tasty side dish! I wish I could find the fresh exotic mushrooms, which would probably make it even better - but the reconstituted dried mushrooms worked fine. And since a couple of people here will not do raw garlic, I did saute that with the pancetta and mushrooms - but I added a little extra, because more garlic makes it better :-)
