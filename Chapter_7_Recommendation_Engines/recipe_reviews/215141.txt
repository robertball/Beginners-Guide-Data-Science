I doubled all the sauce ingredients except the plums. I used four bone-in pork chops because I didn't have a tenderloin. I seared the chops on both sides, removed and kept warm on plate under foil, then deglazed the pan with the balsamic vinegar, adding the brown sugar and honey, and finally plums; I let the sauce cook for 15 minutes to reduce, stirring often, then added the chops back in for another 10 minutes or so, coating them with the sauce. I did not puree/blend the reduction. It's nice to have a chunkier, more chutney-like texture with meat.  Also, it's essential to reduce the ingredients to allow the full flavor to come through; a reduction brings the essential flavors out and concentrates them. Just thickening the sauce with cornstarch is NOT the same.

This is an excellent dish and very easy to prepare. The reduction was delicious and made a beautiful presentation drizzled over the tenderloin medallions. I served it with skin-on garlic mashed red potatoes and farmer's market fresh green beans for a delightful summer evening feast.

My husband called this his new favorite pork tenderloin!  We've experimented with many rubs, marinades, etc., but this one is tops!  I made the recipe as written except for the optional blueberry juice (because I didn't have any).  He has requested this as his birthday dinner, which is next week.  Thanks, ziprose, for the fantastic recipe!

This was incredible! I used exactly what the recipe called for, but decided to double the sauce ingredients minus the plums (read in a previous review). The balsamic gave the sauce a wonderful bite, and kept it from being overwhelmingly sweet. I did not add the optional blueberry juice, but I would have if I had it. It's also a nice choice because it's not too labor intensive: once the pork goes into the oven, it doesn't take very long for the sauce to reduce properly. All in all, an deceptively simple meal that yields the look and taste of a restaurant quality dish!

This way of cooking a tenderloin couldn't have been easier, but with fabulous results. It took just a little longer to get to 150 degrees internal temperature, but you'll want to watch carefully for it, since that temp yields a tender, not dry result. I served mine with the cranberry red wine sauce from AllRecipes recipe called, "Roast Beef Tenderloin with Cranberry-Red Wine Sauce" and served fingerling potatoes to accompany. The meal got rave reviews!

This came out so much better than I'd anticipated. It's very quick and easy to do. The only thing I did differently was add half a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it since I didn't want to wait for it to reduce. Will try it out with the girlfriend for sure.

I'm really rating the sauce and idea as we had country pork ribs cooking in the crock pot with apple cider. The reduction sauce was awesome! I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar and apple cider since I did not have blueberry juice. Perfect to get "Aahh's" from company. Served with quinoa that had been cooked in apple cider and water and sauteed some cabbage in olive oil to complete the meal.

I used blueberry syrup in place of the juice, honey and brown sugar and it turned out great.  I also didn't blend the plums and left them in chunks.

An easier way to make the sauce is to peel the plums - that way, you don't have to mess up a blender and spend time cooking the sauce twice. I also throw in a small handful of blueberries for some extra flavor.

My fiance just raved all through this meal! changes I made: I cooked the meat according to the recipe, but added a couple slices of plums to the skillet where the meat seared in the beginning. For the sauce, I used 1 apple (skinned) and 1 plum, less than 1 T br sugar, 1 T honey, 2 T balsamic, and a spoonful of natural apple and plum puree. I cooked this down for about 30 minutes and did not use a blender. There were still soft chunks of apple left and it was pretty thick. more like a confit or chutney than a sauce. The great thing about this recipe is that there is a lot of down time (meat cooking, plums reducing) so you can really make a whole meal in 45 minutes. I served with homemade mashed potatoes and sauteed asparagus.

Oh dear God this is delicious!!!! I am lazy so used a can of plums with pits removed. Tiny bit of the juice. Did 3 tblspns balsamic /2 of honey and 2 of brown sugar. Super easy to reduce and chop in pan with spoon. I like it thicker. A nice addition might be a touch of clove spice. Outrageously good sauce. However 145 is really rare pork per my oven. Which is new and state of the art. Prefer 155. A keeper

This was really good and simple. Use the purple plums not white to get the most flavor.

This was delicious! I knocked off a star however, because this does not make enough reduction, and the cooking time took much longer than listed.  This was a problem because I timed it so that my reduction was done the same time as the meat...but the meat took 15-20 extra minutes to reach the 145 degrees.

In an attempt to keep an otherwise perfect reduction warm, I needed to have the stove top on low, and it cooked away some of the sauce.  Even though I had doubled the reduction recipe, I barely ended up with enough sauce for 2 people, while the tenderloin could feed 4.

For a 5 star meal:  Double  (or triple) the reduction recipe, change the oven time to 30 minutes, and (as suggested by someone else) peel the plums before hand so you don't have to bother with the mixer.

Wow! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using 2 tbsp of brown sugar because I was out of honey. The pork was beautiful - moist and perfectly cooked. And the sauce...YUM! This one is going into my regular rotation.

Easy to make and I used my handheld immersion blender.  Makes a great presentation drizzled on pork.  It certainly was sweet but not too sweet against the pork.  I omitted the blueberry juice and added just a bit of water to help get the plums cooking.  Made this to see if it was worth making for an upcoming dinner and it will be on the menu.

This dish is a 5 out of 5! I will make it many times! It has an elegant presentation and the plum reduction is beautiful both in look and flavor! I served it with a dish from this site "Butternut Squash with Apple and Cranberries" ..... they seemed to perfectly compliment each other perfectly. I will marry those two dishes!

I really didn't like this but my husband said it was "okay" so I'll rate it 2 stars instead of 1.  The cooking time is way off - you'll have rare pork unless you cook it longer.  I spent quite a bit of time researching pork cooking times to try and get it right  (lent my meat thermometer out and it hasn't been returned yet).  The sauce tasted exactly like raisins.  I love balsamic and was excited about it but mixed with these other flavors you're just left with raisin.  I love raisins but not with pork tenderloin.

This had a lot of good flavor, but the sauce turned out more like a chutney, which I didn't mind. Sort of like cranberry sauce. I also just mashed the plums instead of blending it, so maybe that was the issue. The recipe didn't make nearly enough sauce, so doubled it and added chicken stock to thin out.

I had the butcher at Kroger cut a pork loin in half to make it a 2lb loin (I live by myself), and it was the perfect size. It cooked beautifully as directed by ziprose.

As for the plum sauce, I didn't have balsamic so I used apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, and red wine. It was amazing, especially because I made it in the pan that I browned the roast in. I also didn't use a food processor - I just smashed the plums.

Overall, awesome seasonal dish! I made mascarpone potatoes and lemon pepper green beans with it.

This plum sauce is so yummy, I recommend doubling it. This recipe is tastes like a variation of Thanksgiving turkey with cranberry sauce. I served this to a group of friends, and they loved it.

This was oh my god so good I doubled the sauce recipe and even added a can of organic blueberries to it and it made it so good my husband is like this is his new favorite meal he says that the sauce he just wants to drink it. And that it would make an amazing barbecue sauce if you added that kind of twist to it. Next time I think I would make even more of the sauce it is that good!

This is so quick and easy.  I had everything done within half an hour.  Although the meat was tender, sweet and delicious; sadly, we did not care for the plum sauce.  I think we just don't like fruity-sweet things with our meat.  I used a cast iron skillet to brown the tenderloin and then deglazed the pan with the sauce ingredients and used a fork to smash the plum into the consistency of apple sauce.  Next time, I will just deglaze with some shallots, mushrooms and wine.  Thank you.

This was amazing. Used boneless chops, seared and then put in oven. For sauce used 3 plums, peeled the skin off, the balsamic vinegar, honey, brown sugar and about 1/3 cup blueberies. Let simmer till thickened. As it cooked I kind of mashed the fruit. Very fast and easy clean up.

I followed this recipe for cooking the pork tenderloin, but I didn't have plums or blueberry juice.  I guess my dish was inspired by this recipe.  I used seedless black raspberry jam, maple syrup and balsamic vinegar. I whipped the ingredients together, added some pepper and reduced it in the pan where I cooked the pork.  Very delicious.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I took the advice from other reviewers and doubled the sauce ingredients, except the plums.  I blended until smooth.  Served it with sauteed garlic & shallot quinoa & steamed green beans.  I will definitely make it again.

Awesome! Goes great with pork chops and garlic mashed potatoes. I added some fresh grated ginger to mine and simmered it for a lot longer than the recipe says (about 20 min or so). I ended up adding a little cornstarch at the end to thicken it up because it was taking a while to get to the consistency that I wanted (more like apple sauce). My husband loved this dish and we will definitely make it again!

I had a pork roast on hand, so I made a crock pot pulled pork to have with the sauce.  So good!  The sauce is amazing with the pork.  Will definately make it again.
