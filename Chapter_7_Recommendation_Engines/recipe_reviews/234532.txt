This recipes was really delicious. My family was skeptical at first however they all ate it up and loved it. I did make a few changes...I used taco seasoning instead of chili. I left out the tomato juice. And I added a can of white beans to give the chili a bit more substance. I also served with chopped onions, slices of avocado and sour cream for those who wanted it.

I used a homemade chili seasoning and sauteed a little onion/garlic in with the ground turkey. I did not try this myself, I prepped the chili ahead of time for my husband to rewarm when he got home from work. All he had to do was make bowls of "taco fixin's" to go over the top, grate the cheese and open a bag of Fritos. They all say that this was tasty. My husband thought the chili could have been a little zippier but the kids liked it as is. NOTE: We used Chili Cheese Fritos.

In the 80s, we called this recipe "haystacks," adding additional toppings such as refried/black beans, sour cream, scallions, lettuce.  My children make it for their children and I still enjoy it occasionally.

This is a great recipe a frito pie that my family will actually eat!  I am a native New Mexican and we make our frito pie with straight red chile, not chili.  Therefore, my frito pie is very spicy and very hot, and my family is afraid of it!  My husband and my 4 year old will now actually eat Frito Pie after making this recipe.  It has great flavor but is not hot.  I serve it with sour cream, cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, and chopped tomato.  Delicious! * I added pinto beans and that made it 5 stars!

While it is a fine recipe, you forgot one ingredient., flavor. Add a dash of nutmeg.

I've made this before but never saved the recipe, well now it's saved and we're having it tonight. I used 85/15 ground beef since we don't care for ground turkey. I didn't need the tomato juice because I felt it would be overly watery.  I did add 2 diced serrano chilies for some bite and switched out the cheddar for 1 cup of pepper jack cheese and topped it with about 1/4 cup of finely diced onion. We got 2 good large servings and were stuffed. I've definitely made this my go to Frito Pie Recipe.
