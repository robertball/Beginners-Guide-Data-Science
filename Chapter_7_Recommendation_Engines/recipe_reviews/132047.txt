I really screwed this recipe up because mine was just a sloppy mess. But I added about 1t of Almond extract and 6T of flour, just enough to end up with a very sticky batter. I patted in to a jelly roll pan and baked. These were awesome. Next time I will add some chocolate shavings and coconut to make an almond joy cookie.
