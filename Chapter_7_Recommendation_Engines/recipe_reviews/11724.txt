I thought this was really good, although I did make a few changes. I changed the setting so that it was for 2 people.  I used a whole small onion.  I used 3 tbl spoons of the paste and 1 1/2 tsps of the turmeric.  And I added 1 tsp of white pepper, 1 tsp of ground black pepper, and some cayenne.  My boyfriend loved it!  Nothing fancy...but good and easy.

I liked the flavor of this spaghetti, but I think the sauce needs more sauce.  It only made just enough to barely coat the pasta.  I think I would add a little more to it next time, but overall this was a good recipe.

This smelled good when the beef was cooking but I was a little confused in the last stage - how can the noodles and beef cook for 30-40 min without completely sticking to the pot?  The final product was a little bland, but still edible.

This recipe almost tastes like the spaghetti I grew up eating. Ground turkey makes a great substitute in this recipe for those who aren't all that into beef. I added more salt and turmeric to taste. I also added dried basil and pepper to taste. When it came time to add the tomato paste mixture, I added half of the tomato paste mixture and half Prego. I kept adding Prego when more sauce was needed especially after the pasta was added to the meat mixture. It tasted great!

I followed the recipe exactly as indicated. I do love turmeric and enjoy the health benefit it offers, that said it is not enough to make this a properly seasoned spaghetti. Additionally there is not enough sauce (I doubled the water, turmeric, and tomato paste). After tasting it, I decided to add in the following herbs 1 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp crushed rosemary, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, with 1/4 tsp garlic powder (I like my garlic) the result...much more flavorful spaghetti for a bump to 3.5 stars.

I have tried a many of recipes and this is by far the best tasting of tem all!
I tweaked a little bit but overall kept to the same.
When i make Chiili, I add about a teaspoon of Sugar to cut
the slight bitter taste of the tomato paste. So I did the same
for this recipe and added it along with the tomato paste and the ground beef mixed. . I also Added fresh Basil - from a plant not in a bottle or already picked - .ground beef used was 80/15.
Also added fresh garlic. the addition of the tumeric is wonderful. it really brings all the flavors together. My wife even told that this is by far the best she has had. My compliments to the person who gave this recipe....
