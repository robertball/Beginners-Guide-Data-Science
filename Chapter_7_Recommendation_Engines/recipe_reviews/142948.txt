Loved this recipe, very tasty and tender. I cooked it in the oven on a rack at 180 two and a half hours. Will make this one again. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD

Very Good recipe, But Curing salt is a must to rid the meat of bacteria and helps it preserve longer. great flavor, but dyhydrators dont get hot enough to kill bacteria. The curing salt is cheap and can be found at any sporting goods store.

The jerky came out very flavorful. Although when left overnight, it was a bit too salty. I'd suggest either reducing the salt or marinating a shorter period.

Thanks Doc! - This 5th batch will marinate til Sun. morn.

I had a beef jerky cook off in my kitchen today using this recipe and two from Recipezaar.com and quite frankly this came in last place.  Maybe it was the choice of meat??  The only round I could find was quite thin and did not cut into strips well.  I used flank for the other two and they were fabulous.  The other two had much more flavor than this one did as well.

This was very good beef jerky had a nice flavor. I might use a little less soy sauce next time though, because a few people who tried it said there was a little too much for their taste.  When I cut these into strips I cut against the grain on the meat(something my hubby suggested to make it easier to chew). My store carries 2 different types of "Liquid Smoke" I used the Natural Mesquite flavor with this recipe. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have had great success following it exactly and by making slight alterations. 
The recipe doesn't specify type of salt so I use pickling salt (dissolves in cold water easier, curing salt adds nitrites which are unnecessary if your dehydrator goes above 160 or if oven is used)
I have found that omitting the Liquid Smoke and adding 1tsp cayenne pepper and 1tsp curry is wonderful. 
We also make a "hot" version where we sub hot paprika, add 2tsp cayenne, 1tsp crushed reds and 1tsp curry

Should also note I am non-classically trained professional chef and butcher

Incredible Jerky Recipe! It has turned me into a Jerky addict! I have tried many other recipes but keep coming back to this one (with slight variations).  Cook in the oven at about 180 for several hours...I leave the oven door slightly ajar while drying/cooking.  You will not be disappointed.

I will say this is the jerky recipe I will forever stick with. I normally knock off stars if I change the recipe. But I just cannot bring myself to as this is so yummy!! I double the marinade, and omitted the salt (per other review suggestions), and used mesquite liquid smoke. I also used sirloin, which I thought is much easier to cut excess fat off, then london broil. Less oil while dehydrating I found as well. 
 It is by far the best jerky I have had in my life...and I LOVE JERKY. And I made it which is so cool!! I love salt, and I can't say this enough, try without adding the tsps of salt first. You will be happy with the result. 
Thanks for posting. 
Now if we can get a ground beef jerky version that has the same magical taste. I think I will try by mixing all the dry ingredients into the ground beef, make into strips with a jerky gun, then coat with the mixed wet ingredients.  I will edit my review and let you know of the results. Apparently, liquid marinades to ground beef, equals a real mess if mixed all together at once : (

I used Round Steak cut into thin strips and I left out the liquid smoke, tenderizer and paprika. I cooked on my Weber Grill over low coals.

It turned out Awesome!

I like this jerky recipe very much, reminds me of the hickory farms beef jerky we used to get when I was a kid. And I've been missing that! I only gave it four stars because I did it a little differently from the recipe here. I didn't use meat tenderizer, I don't like using msg and I believe that is what it is. I used gluten free low sodium tamari for the soy and I also cut down the salt by about half. The first couple times I made it I didn't have liquid smoke so I used chipotle powder which was too spicy and didn't mix well. I also used the amounts in the recipe for one pound of meat. I would double the recipe for two pounds of meat. 
   I was using this without the liquid smoke and it was ok but it's better with the hickory flavored smoke I used today. And I warmed the marinade on the stove and then let it cool to get the ingredients well incorporated. I found that mixing everything room temperature, I couldn't get everything dissolved and parts of the jerky would be more flavorful or more spicy than others. Warming the marinade allowed the brown sugar to dissolve and all the other ingredients to incorporate well. Once that was cool which didn’t take long, I added it to the meat, mixed it well and let it marinate for about 12 hours in the fridge. I used my oven to dry it, 180 degrees which is the lowest it goes, for about 4 hours. 
    With these changes, I'm very happy with the recipe and will be using it again. I shared it with friends that really liked it also.

Fantastic jerky.  I buy a bottom round roast and my butcher slices it thin for me (costs a little bit more to get it sliced jerky thin but it is WELL WORTH IT).  I cut it into jerkly length strips with a pair of cutlery scissors.  I follow the receipe to the letter except I substitute low sodium soy sauce, hot paparika, and curing salt for those three ingrediants.  I let it marinate for three days and then put it in the dehydrater for 3 to 4 hours.  I have had many rave reviews on it and get asked when am I making another batch.  I just put on a 6 pound batch to marinate.

This is a nice alternative to the ground beef recipe the dehydrator came with.  I'll definitely make this again, possibly with larger strips of meat.  Mine marinated for 8 hours and was fairly  tender.  The flavor was excellent. I'll try marinating over night next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty but not too strong.  I doubled the marinade as this did not cover the meat well enough or at least compared to other recipes we made the same day.  Even then it was not enough to cover 2 pounds of meat.

My husband and kids LOVED THIS RECIPE, we are a hunter family however so I used Deer, Moose, Sheep and Mountain goat, and they are worked out great! I let the Sheep and Goat marinade longer, and extra day, because it is a little different to cook with.  But everyone was greatly impressed with this recipe!!  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the liquid smoke, but since I've done this a few times without it seems unnecessary to add it now.  Thank you so much!!

Before deciding on a beef jerky recipe, I had only thought of it when I came across, some beatifully thin sliced top round beef steaks, and I knew..BEEF JERKY! I found this recipe and decided to do this recipe....giving the approval my guys, said really good, needs just a bit more umph, but over all a good recipe. I did find, that I should have doubled the recipe due to my meat being exactly 2 pounds and there was no excess slurry left when added to the meat. SO Please take in account if any makes this with already prepared sliced meat, double the slurry batch to accomendate. I also left the meat to marinade over night for added flavor. Thank you.

Update. Used a chuck roast first time. Flavor was great but meat was tough, very tough, even though we beat the fecal matter out of it. This time, half the pepper, a tablespoon more brown sugar and London Broil, also pounded, but only slightly. No kick (because of my husbands delicate sensibilities) but incredibly tender and outlandishly delicious. Also marinated for two days. Doc, it just gets better and better. Thank you!

An excellent recipe with just the right amount of bite. Go easy on the salt, as you may find this a touch too salty, what with the soy sauce, Worchestershire, garlic and onion powders, all of which are salty unto themselves. Overall, this tastes exactly the way beef jerky should.

Great flavor. I did decrease the salt and marinating time based on reading some other reviews but I will make it again using the recommended amounts and marinate longer. Very good!

For those who think this isn't enough, put all ingredients in a plastic ziplock and the juices flow.  I let mine marinate over 24 hours, 1/4 in London Broil.  Only took 4 hours in my Excalibur dehydrator.  Loved it.

I have made this twice and it was excellent.  I used London Broil cut as it was on sale and had the meat clerk cut it for me for jerky.  The first batch I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent.  The second batch I added 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper for a little kick and it was excellent.  I will experiment a little more and maybe try a jalapeno/serrano or habernero pepper in the marinade.

I made this exact recipe for my 2nd ex-wife on our first date back in 1979, and we ate an entire bag together on the hood of my car, with 2 - 3 strips of jerky at a time passing back and forth between our interlocking jaws. I remember the bold old country flavor and the sense of power each shred of jerky filled me with. I guess you can imagine how that night ended, tucked away in a corn field silhouetted by an Ohio summer sunset.

This is my first attempt to making jerky, spend tons of money on store jerky, Im trying to home make it and love the ingredients in this one.... Im using a bonless cross rib pot roast, its really lean and with the extra fat Ive cut off Im marinading and giving it to the dog for a treat! I will repost with the results. didnt have the meat tenderizer so omitted that and no salt to start, im not a salty person. plus Im using a light soya sauce and fresh minced onions and garlic.

Great recipe for jerky.  The family LOVED it!  I've got another batch marinating now with a little crushed red pepper added to bring some heat.  After removing meat from marinade I placed it between two paper towels then placed that between two pieces of waxed paper to pound it out.  Pounding it between paper towels helped take some of the moisture out the steak before putting it in the dehydrator.   Only had in the dehydrator for 4 hours - after taking out I wrapped the jerky in paper towels again to let it rest in the refrigerator before sealing up with a food sealer.

My grandson and I tried this recipe-it was fantastic!!  We used hamburger, mixed it into the seasoning and then shaped the pieces before baking 180 degrees, 1 1/2 hours.  Grandson is very picky about jerky, but he couldn't get enough of this one-we'll be making again soon!!

Oh my gosh! This beef jerky is AMAZING!! I found one before where they just say to use a store bought marinade, and it was horrible! I made this as like a make or break and it is delicious and everyone I've shared it with LOVES it!! I cant get enough of this :)

I just finished putting the dehydrator away after a good cleaning using this recipe. I let it marinate for two days in the frig before making the jerky.For some reason it only took about 8 hours. It usually takes 18 hours or so when I use a different receipe. I was looking for  different  ingredients  and came across Doc's.It has a very nice taste not at all spicy. I added 2 tablespoons of honey. This was made for my son to take back to Toledo Univ. I am getting ready to make another batch to give for a stocking stuffer. This time I am going to add a little sriracha sauce for a little zip.

Absolutely delicious. Tastes like a good store bought brand. I added a little more pepper and marinated for 16 hours, but I think the original recipe is probably just a tasty.

The marinated smelled wonderful.  When the jerky first came off the dehydrator the taste was pungent. However, a day later and all I can taste is salt

Very good flavor, I used to make jerky for my son while he was in the Navy and served in the Gulf.  The recipe I used was similar to yours omitting the meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika, cut the salt in half added 1/2 tsp. pepper and used London Broil instead of the round cut on the bias (or across the grain).  I was so glad to see this recipe on here because I had lost mine, I thought forever.  Thanks for sharing!

I have tried dozens of recipes for making beef jerky, this is without question, THE BEST!  It's tangy and has a subtle peppery taste.  This stuff is amazing.  We actually made 10lbs of jerky and it only lasted 2 days before everyone ate it.  Just returned from store with 20lbs of meat to make a fresh batch for the weekend!  Amazing Recipe, thank you for sharing!!

so far everything is smelling delicious.....it is very hard for me to stay out of the jerky as the smell is sooo inviting.  This recipe is better than any marinade I can get from the store. I will update when the first batch is done.  Both batches are done.  This recipie is GREAT.   The fam loves it and my co-workers are exstatic about it!!! Best results- marinate for 12 hrs then put in dehydrator for 12 hrs, reversing racks, and turning meat after 6 hrs

The "standard" with which all recipes can begin from. Excellent basic all time jerky flavor! From here I will experiment with some spicier versions but will back to making for friends and family that like good ole' fashioned "beef jerky". Thanx Doc!
BTW, Pounding between plastic wrap was the best thing to do! Have made jerky before but this way it comes out evenly and dries in half the time.

For you heat freaks out there; I sprinkled each piece with cayenne and ghost pepper just before placing on the dehydrator. I find I can control the flavors with even more precision by using a dry rub of sorts, just like with steak.

We just found out our daughter has celiac disease and almost all commercial jerky uses soy sauce with wheat. So we bought a dehydrator and have used this recipe 3 times in three weeks. I cut out the salt totally (there is enough in soy sauce) and cut waaaaaaaay down on the liquid smoke. Awesome recipe! We have at least double the recipe every time with no issue!

I have made it twice with the ingredients exactly AND the 2 pounds of meat. Both times I have had to DOUBLE the marinade amount as it didn't cover the meat enough. I did put in a 9 x 13 inch glass dish that I have cover for and turned it have way through the approximate 24 hours of marinating. I would like to know if anyone else had to double the marinade. I will say that I am still giving it 5 stars BECAUSE my family and (for the 2 days it barely lasted) said it was as good and better than "store bought".

Best jerky recipe I've found yet! This is awesome..I put it together and accidentally left it in the fridge four days instead of overnight. I think that made a huge diference compared to other recipes tried. Works perfect in the oven at 180 F for 2  1/2 hours if you dont have a dehydrator.

Love the flavor! I added a fresh Hawaiian chile pepper from my garden. My dehydrator is really slow so cooked for over 8 hrs.  My friends thought it was perfect! I'm on my 3rd batch! Thanks for sharing.

We really liked it.  The amount of salt was perfect for us but that may be because the liquid smoke I used had no sodium in it.  I made deer jerkey.

Made this for my husband who is a real jerky fan. He loved it. He was eating it off the dehydrater as it was done, one tray at a time. He finds it comparible to Enjoy brand jerky which he loves but is hard to find.

Many times. this is my go to recipe. sometimes modify based on requests ( teriyaki in place of soy, more brown sugar for example) but have never failed with this. I like the simple measures, 1 tsp for spices,  2 tbsp for most everything else , i skip the salt, plenty of sodium from everything else (meat tenderizer, soy sauce)

I had the top round sliced 1/8 inch thin.  Used dehydrator at top temp for 5 1/2 hours.  
I had 4 lbs of meat so I doubled all ingredients.  I did not pound the meat or use plastic.  Just soaked overnight in ziplock bag and cooked next day.  
All said delicious...make more asap.  Now I'm doing 8 lbs batches in two dehydrator sessions.  No grease or other residue...washed trays in dishwasher without prewash and they came clean.
Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! Awesome flavor. My family is addicted to it. I make 3 lbs per week out of top round beef. The only changes I've made is I've added a teaspoon of mustard powder and a tablespoon of hot pepper flakes. I do a pound-and-a-half with pepper flakes in a pound 1/2 without because my two boys don't like the hot and spicy as much as my wife and I. come deer season I'll be using venison.

It has a funny smell when it was dehydrating which made me think the meat had gone bad.  However, that wasnt the case and it really is very good.  I didnt use meat tenderizer as I have a meat slicer that was able to cut the meat very thin.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again.

I've been making my own beef jerky for decades now, and have finally found a recipe that's the tastiest.  Instead of using wooden toothpicks thought, I used short bamboo skewers, which worked incredibly well.  Per other reviewers, I did cut down the worcestershire sauce a bit and added more salt.  Otherwise made as written and is it GOOOD.

My first attempt turned out great.  Used top sirloin that I found on sale.  Trimmed all the fat and let it marinate for 24 hours.  Used a meat tenderizing hammer to flatten out the strips to 1/8 " and put in the dehydrator for 10 hours at 160.  I know this recipe recommends only 4 hours, but after checking mine after only 4 hours, I found the meat to be too moist to keep for any length of time.  Great jerky recipe !

I have made this numerous times. My only changes are the following. I made the marinade separately and mix thoroughly before combining with the meat. I do not add salt.  Sometimes I will add more spice ( Siracia, chil i powder etc)

I have made venison jerky many times, but this recipe is by far the best I have ever tasted. The only thing I did different was added 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes. Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!

A touch to salty (and we LOVE salt) and entirely to spicy for us. If you like something with a bite to it, and want to guzzle water because of the salt and burn, then this is for you! However, I have a gallon bag of beef jerky that I have to suffer through because beef is too expensive to throw out. Even though it tears up my gut and burns up my mouth. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This is an almost perfect recipe. I use a variation of this and it always gets two thumbs up from everyone who has tried it. I cook it in an oven at a low temperature and keep the door slightly ajar to prevent cooking the beef too quickly.

I left out the meat tenderizer as it is not needed, especially if you are using a nice top round beef. I recommend marinating for a maximum 30 minutes or you'll encounter an overload of salt from the soy and various powders.

If you marinate using this recipe over night like I did the first time, you're going to have one VERY salty beef jerky on your hands that will have you dry reaching.

Consider using smoked paprika and leaving out the liquid smoke and you get a slightly less jarring flavour that is more spicy. In place of the garlic powder I used freshly crushed garlic. Honestly, the difference is night and day if you use fresh garlic.

I also leave out the sugar as I don't like sweetened jerky. I prefer to let the meat do the flavour work and sugar to me just obscures the taste of the meat. If you want a more store bought taste, add in the sugar or just leave it out.

I quadrupled the recipe to marinade 3-4 pounds of wild game meat that I had. I don't know who your friends are Doc, but they are just being nice to you when they say it's the best they have ever had. This was so salty that it was inedible! I ruined some meat, and I won't be doing this one again. If you folks want a better recipe, try Alton Brown's over on the Food Network website! Sorry Doc, this one was a huge miss for me!

I have tried it several times and just now I put six pounds of meat to marinate overnight. No question about it, this is the best recipe for jerky. My two boys call daily to see if there is any jerky ready. Other recipes are good, but this one is THE RECIPE. Thanks compadre!I use a common store bought dehydrator and the meat is ready in 5 to 7 hours, depending on the thickness.

We tried this recipe with my two kids who wanted to make beef jerky for the first time.  They (all of us, really) loved it so much we had to make another batch as soon as the first batch was eaten.  On the second batch we used a little less soy sauce and a little more Worcestershire (sp?) sauce and we liked that flavor a bit more; but the recipe, as it stands, is just excellent.  The taste is really addictive.

I tried this recipe on a wing and a prayer that I would not mess it up, I fallowed everything exact and it turned out perfect! The marinade is wonderful, the taste is everything beef jerky should be. I used my oven for this instead, and still great. My family has eaten almost all of it already.

This is a great jerky recipe.  I make this all the time using gluten-free soy sauce (my son has an allergy) and we take it backpacking and fishing.  I have tried quite a few recipes and I keep coming back to this one!

Dear Doc,

Your Jerky ideas are incredible.  I made some adjustments with my son, from targeting over a 100 people this last week from all races and genders.  It seems that the ingredients that work combined with marinating and dehydrating are as follows in creating the New, "ZOMBIE JERKY":

* Top Round London Broil 1 pound
* Black pepper
* Worchestershire
* Onion Powder
* Garlic Powder
* Meat Tenderizer
* Liquid Smoke
* Paprika
* No Salt
* No Soy Sauce
* Chipalta Chile Pepper

* Marinating time: 20 hours
* Dehydrating time: 8 hours

Thanks for all you help,
Chef Zombie

Just to say that I have made several recipes over the years and I always seem to come back to this one. The Jerky can be canned in sterilized jars, but I never seem to have it too long in the pantry as it is a great snack among my family members.

Normally I dry the jerky in a dehydrator overnight. Today I am going to dry it in my new gas smoker and also the oven to see how that works out as I am making 3 times this recipes. 

At times I add more coarse black pepper to one or two racks, while drying, for an added peppered flavor.

I've been making beef jerky for a long time and found this one to be one of the best recipes I've tried. I marinated for 2 days....not intentionally but it did work out that way. I was afraid of the saltiness that was mentioned in another review but it honestly turned out fantastic. I changed a few things though. Used smoked paprika instead of plain and added some (about a tsp.) of chipotle powder. Its spicy and exactly what my family likes in jerky! Thanks so much for sharing!

Got to say....one of the easiest recipes for jerky I was able to find and it turned out great! I'm not a fan of things overly salty. I marinated it over night and it was not salty for my tastes, it turned out just right! I don't have a dehydrator and I saw that one reviewer said that they baked there's. I live at a higher elevation and had to bake it longer then 2 1/2 hrs! Just keep in eye on it or it can over dry, I would say if it's your first time making the recipe keep a close eye on t he meat during the drying prosess!

Made this for members of a pirate crew I am involved with and they raved!  I made 2 lbs of it and it was gone before the end of the first day!  I should have made more.  Everyone has been asking me to make it again - I get requests constantly.  I was crunched on time so it only marinated the morning I made it for about 6 hours but it still came out phenomenal!  This will be a staple festival recipe and just for the heck of it recipe also.  Thanks so much!

Awesome!!! I marinated for 2hours, used London broil, added 1.5tsp of  Tony Chachere's Seasoning, cut into 1/4 inch slices , used a meat hammer and flattened/tenderized the meat before putting in the dehydrator. Meat turned out to be 1/8 inch after I used the hammer.. I like my jerky hard... This turned out perfect... Best jerky ever..

This is very very good.  I used the exact recipe with 2lbs of 93% ground beef.  I personally think there is either too much smoke liquid or too much soy; I'm not sure just yet.  My next batch will use 2 tsp of liquid smoke to see if it is a bit more to my personal taste.  I think I'll also add some cracked pepper on top before putting it in the oven/dehydrator next time to give it a little more kick.

I made this recipe and it tastes delicious! I did find the liquid smoke to be a bit too intense for my liking though.
I tried it a second time and only did 1.5 tablespoons liquid smoke and added a tablespoon of some cider vinegar as well. The vinegar helped give it a better texture, and the slight decrease in liquid smoke made it perfect for me and my husband.

This was the first time I made any kind of beef jerky and I must say this recipe is spot on.  The jerky has such a good flavor and I will be making this on a regular basis.  I like things a little spicier so I added a little red pepper flakes and it’s perfect for me.

Excellent recipe best jerky I’ve made. I did mine in the oven on wm or 170 degrees for 3 hrs. I also like hot food so after I marinated for 24 hrs I added red pepper and lots of black pepper. But I also did some as the recipe said no complaints from the kids. I certify myself as a beef jerky specialist now.

I was looking for a beef jerky recipe to try as I am on the keto diet and wanted jerky that wasn't packed with sugar. I found Doc's recipe and figured I could swap out the brown sugar for a sweetener/maple extract substitute. It worked! I tripled the recipe to use with 3 pounds of a mix of top and bottom round. I cut the table salt in half (after tripling the original amount) and it turned out to just the right saltiness for my palette. I marinated for a day and a half using gallon-sized ziplock baggies and then dehydrated til done (my dehydrator is OLD so no temp setting or timer lol). The texture is different than store bought, but in a very good way. I'm hoping there will be enough when we leave to go backpacking because my husband won't stay out of it! Will definitely add this to my have-to-make again box!

I used top round had butcher chill and slice for me a 2.5lb roast.
All i did was follow the marinade the best i could with what i had. The only thing i won't do next time is pound the meat as it stayed super flat and was more like beef crispy then jerky but still much better then what you get at the store. 165F @ 6.2hrs and i let it sit in the dehydrator until cool.

This is the 5th batch of jerky I"ve made with this recipe. The first 2 were as is written, just tripled the batch. AWESOME!  One of the best basic marinades I've ever used. Perfect balance in my opinion. 
Using this as a base the past 2 times, I've adjusted with several things.  Using the base, and splitting up the batches of meat, I added cyanne and crushed red pepper to one. I added BBQ dry seasoning to another.  Added Dales Steak Seasoning to some, again awesome. AND, this time, I sprinkled the Grippo's BBQ Potato Chip seasoning on it before putting it in the machine! WOW, if you like Grippos BBQ chips, you'll love this with jerkey. Great recipe.

Excellent.  Subbed Chipotle Chili Pepper powder and Japanese 7 Spice for the paprika.  Dehydrated 4 pounds top sirloin for 8 hours.  Not leathery thin like commercial jerky.  AMAZING.

I make beef jerky frequently and this is terrific.  I used irish whiskey instead of meat tenderizer because it tenderizes, adds flavor, and why not.

As a Newbie to using a Dehydrator, and a Lover of Beef Jerky. It goes without saying that learning to make jerky was my First recipe for my dehydrator. ;)
Your recipe, I would say, is the best combination of spices and seasonings. I have since made some adjustments to entice the taste buds of my Family and Friends, but your recipe will Always be my bench maker for making the Best Jerky. Thank you for sharing. God Bless

We raise cattle, and I routinely use a dehydrator to make jerky from our freezer full of fresh beef.  Today I made this recipe as well as my family's reigning favorite jerky recipe.  In a side-by-side taste test, this recipe was declared (5-0 votes) as the new favorite!  After reading the reviews, the only changes I made were as follows: 1t salt (instead of 2t), and cut both the garlic powder and onion powder down to 1/4t each, instead of 1t each.  (Note:  I only cut the last two because of a food allergy and to get them down to tolerable levels.)  GREAT jerky recipe!!!!  Thank you for sharing it!

I used this recipe, and made two pounds of jerky. I let it marinate over night and then used the oven to dehydrate it. My husband loved it much that the entire 2 pounds was gone that same night!!

I used my Weston 10-tray dehydrator set to 160 and left in for 5hrs. It came out perfect. Flavour was great. I used Eye of Round and will try again with flank steak to see how it turns out. The only changes I made was to add an additional tablespoon of hickory smoke.

This is by far my favorite jerky recipe. My co-workers have tried it and have cost me more money than I can count making it for them (I truly don't mind though). Thank you for a great recipe, and thank you for making my co-workers happy.

Having made this as much as I have, one thing I'd like to point out to others is jerky is very dependent on salt. This recipe can taste very different depending on the ratio of marinade to meat (and time marinated). Don't be afraid to experiment to get your personal perfect taste.

Have made this three times in the last month. The only bad part of this recipe is when you have to leave to go to work. The family will  undoubtably swoop in and wipe out your stash every single time. It’s just that good. The only addition that I made was adding 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes. The combination of the sweet and spicy flavor is so delicious. Two different friends who tried this recipe went out and immediately purchased dehydrators just so they could make their own. I got real lucky to find this recipe right after buying my dehydrator. I would not even bother trying any other recipes because this tastes exactly what I want my jerky to taste like!!!!!

I made it in my dehydrator and it was good but too heavy on the soy.  I will alter that a bit and I added hot pepper flakes.   Hubby loved it and wants more of it!

I have made this twice, once per the recipe and the second time I substituted Cayenne pepper for the paprika and added a couple of Tablespoons of Sriracha. 
I like a jerky that bites back! Still tweaking it to my liking

Needs longer marination time and if you use curing salt refer to manufacturers amounts, for Prague powder this suggested amount is way too high!

Beef jerky is a family favorite. Everytime I take requests, Docs Beef Jerky is #1 on the list.  I'm lucky enough to live by a carniceria (a Mexican butcher shop) and they slice your roast almost paper thin! It takes the hassle out of slicing the jerky. The hardest part is picking out just one flavor. I also use a dehydrator ??

I haven’t had meat tenderizer to add but I’ve made this recipe a few times without now without it and it’s killer! I occasionally add some sriracha to give it a little more heat but it is great regardless. Everyone who has tried it has loved and some even suggested I start selling it! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this jerky! The only problem is I can’t stop eating it! I do substitute curing salt in order to eliminate bacteria because dehydrators don’t get hot enough to do so

Good recipe. I followed the advice of others and omitted the salt, thinking the soy and Worcester would do the trick, but that was a mistake. Needed a bit more salt as I made it. I also found the taste a little heavy on the liquid smoke. I would cut it by 25% in future.

I made 8lbs of jerky so I had to adjust measurements. I did double the garlic powder, black pepper and paprika for more of a bite. Also using a multi-pepper grinder gives it more texture on top for a pepper jerky. I also let it sit for 48 hours and it really made it softer yet nice and dry with ALL the flavor!!! Turned our great!  Will reuse this recipe over and over!

It's very yummy and tender beef jerky. It's too much of soy sauce to my taste, I'll try to reduce amount next time I'll be making it.

This was a great recipe. It was my first time making jerky and it was perfect. It is delicious and has a great balance of salty and sweet with a kick of pepper. I didn’t have meat tenderizer so I used a squirt of lemon juice instead.

Excellent recipe. Followed recipe exactly less the meat tenderizer (none at the local store). Dried for 5.5 hours in an Excaliber dehydrator. @145F setting. Very tasty.

Hands down THEE recipe to use for homemade beef jerky.  Very flavorful without being too salty, which is a common problem I've run into after trying a variety of brine and marinade recipes.  I eliminated the liquid smoke and used my electric smoker with hickory chips and it turned out amazing.  This is the recipe I'm going to keep going back to.

Great recipe! My only problem was that I got my meat tenderizer all sticky when I should have used it to tenderize the meat before marinading. 1 tsp was just the right amount though.

really good traditional recipe. I should have added more soy, worcestershire and black pepper since I had over 2lb of beef but that's personal taste.  Still turned out good from my dehydrator.

Awesome recipe but here are my tweaks to it. Instead of onion and garlic powders, use actual onion and garlic, cutting down on the saltiness. I like extra spicy so I add 1tsp of each cayenne and chili powder as well as fresh Serrano and habanero peppers. You're going to leave all the veggies behind when you throw it in the dehydrator so they don't mess with the moisture content too much. Comes out HOT!

This jerky is unbelievable! So delicious! The only thing I changed was, I added red pepper flakes to my marinade. I eyeballed the amount I thought my family would like and good lord! It came out amazingly delicious!!!!

I have made jerky alot over the years and this recipe is darn good.  I made it like it said the first time but now I'm going toad a little terriyaki marinade and more pepper. I must say the smashing of the meat made it dehydrate much quicker.

I have been looking for a good recipe for Jerky. Look no further, this is incredible! I had the Butcher slice bottom round for jerky. It took 5 hours to dry in the Dehydrator. I put 7 trays, stacked.
Delicious! This recipe is a keeper!

Bought an Excaliber Dehydrator on Amazon. It arrived on Monday. My wife and I purchased 4lbs of "eye of round" and thinly sliced by hand (approx 1/4 inch) with the grain on Tuesday and marinated per the recipe(combined all the marinade ingredients in a 2 cup glass measuring cup and heated in microwave for 45 seconds and whisked so all was dissolved. We put the meat and marinade in a gallon size zip lock bag and marinated for 48 hours working the meat and the contents of the bag by massaging/mixing it every 6-8 hours to ensure meat was well coated and seasoned. Laid all the meat out after marinating on plastic wrap and cover with wrap and gently pounded it out for even thickness. Placed on trays with plenty of space between pieces in dehydrator ( I have a 9 tray dehydrator but only used 5 so there was plenty of heat being distributed evenly) at 165 for 4 hours exactly. Turned out perfect. Unbelievable. Amazing. Another great accomplishment in my life.

Just got a new food dehydrator and this was the first recipe I tried.  It was a home run!  Whenever I try a new recipe, I always make it exactly as the recipe calls and afterward, will tweak but this one was perfect as is - and that's coming from a family of serious jerky connoisseurs!

This recipe is okay, but not great. It's a little tasteless. Also the "How To" video has also missed the mark. They show fatty cuts of meat. I'm talking by long sections of fat. This is definitely not good. You have to trim all the fat or at least as much as you can, because it doesn't taste good, the texture is bad and it will go rancid fast.  This is beef jerky  101 and is supposed to be common knowledge with chefs.

I made this recipe and it turned out very good. I cooked at 165 degrees which is the highest setting on our dehydrator for four hours. The jerky came out a little crunchy so I will adjust next batch to 3 and 1/2 hours at 150. Good stuff!

Very good jerky.  I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted Tamari, also  out of Worchestershire  sauce and used anchovie paste mixed with more Tamari.   ( I had read somewhere anchovies are an ingredient in Worchestershire sauce and it was a good substitute)  Jerky was  a bit sweeter but the flavor was still very tasty.  Will make again!

Seriously the best. I make it with amino acids instead of soy sauce since Cilac is an issue in the house but it's perfect. You'll be happy you made it.

I am a jerky lover! Never made it myself though and always dreaded spending so much on it in the store. So I bought myself a dehydrator and made my first batch! After reading a ton of reviews I decided on this recipe! Let me tell you I am in LOVE AND SO ARE MY KIDS LOL the flavor is amazing. This is all around a great recipe. I used ingredients just as listed but I used a rump roast as that's all my grocery store carried.

Really good flavor but a little too salty for my taste. I'll definitely make it again but I'll cut the salt in half. Much better than store bought jerky and you control how thick you make it.

fantastic! made it hanging from a rack in the oven for two and a half hours at around 175, we were missing liquid smoke but it still turned out great. a few of the thicker pieces were a little undercooked so I'd recommend making sure everything's pretty thin.

From a flavor perspective this is really good but if you put meat tenderizer like Adolfs, for example, in the marinade for 8 hours you will ruin the texture of the meat. It's great if you just leave that out.

Did add a dash or 2 of chipotle chili powder. Also added 2 tsp of red wine vinegar. And left 1 Tbl of liquids smoke out since i was smoking it on my REC TEC grill on my first batch and it was excellent. This next batch I did all the same things again but I also added 1 TBL of molasses. The sauce tasted even better and can't wait to drop this batch onto my REC TEC grill tomorrow.  ( side note: I smoked at 180 deg for 2 hours with hickory pellets)

My improvements on the method made mine incredibly easy, not so messy to make, and delicious. First, I mix all the ingredients except the meat in a large ziplock bag and mix well. Then, I used flank steak, aka London Broil, that has been frozen and then thawed for an hour or so, so that I could slice it into 1/4-inch strips. I remove the fat on the edges as I discovered that it doesn't dry well or taste good after drying. Then I lay the bag(s) flat on a cookie sheet and store in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days, or whenever I have time to dry them. No more than 3 days or else the meat tenderizer begins to turn the meat to mush.  I flip them every once in a while or when I think of it to ensure the marinade reaches every corner of the meat. When it's time to pound them flat and put in the dehydrator, I put two or three slices in a freezer ziplock bag (for strength) and pound them flat with a spiked mallet before laying them in the dehydrator.  They dry for 4-6 hours on high heat, and then I pack them and send them off to my son at school. At least I know he's eating SOMETHING tasty...

My husband and I tried this Doc Beef Jerky recipe to make 20lb and the feedback from all was the best beef jerky they ever had.  I use the same recipe to make small batch of Cayenne pepper added to this and it was the spicy sweet...delicious as well.

I made it as the recipe stated and am making it again. This time I added more garlic powder and marinating it longer. It was good the first time but needed a little more spice.

Very good, I did a 1/4 x1/4 ,now trying get a 1/4 X 1/2 . Adding a bit more brown sugar this time for a slight sweeter taste. A very good recipe, one can alter it a bit to your own taste. My wife and I both liked original recipe, but wanted to try a slight change. Will know tomorrow.....

I've been using this recipe for two years. I add 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  Every person who tastes it says it's the best they've ever had. I use defatted choice eye of round sliced 1/8" thick cross-grain on an electric slicer. Very uniform thickness.

I sometimes shake on a mixture of finely ground black pepper and cracked red pepper after raw meat is trayed and ready to dry.

This is very good! I would double the marinade to cover all of the sliced roast. We liked when the meat was cut a little thicker. In the oven it took 3 1/2 hours for thin slices. On the round dehydrator it took 18 hours for the thin slices. 26 hours for the thicker ones.

I use this as my base recipe for all my venison and beef jerky recipes.  This is an excellent jerky recipe on its own.  However, I have made some personal modifi ations.  I do not pound the meat to uniform thickness.   I add 1 Tbls Maple syrup,  1 Tbls hot sauce, and sometimes add varying amounts of crushed red peppers, and other spice.
I run the meat and marinade through my vacuum marinator and the drying process is handled by a fan powered dehydrator.  5 trays full 8 -12 hours.

I added a teaspoon of chipotle paste to give it a little kick. Not quite enough, so in the second batch I added a tablespoon of chipotle paste. Perfect!!!!!  This is a great recipe to start with!

An excellent recipe which adds more flavor than most jerky you buy at the store. Ended up smokey, flavorful and not too salty. I let mine marinate for 48 hours and dried the meat at 160 degrees in a dehydrator for about 6 hours because my meat was sliced pretty thick.

The flavor was a little weak for my taste. I have been trying different beef jerky recipes and so far Chef Johns is my favorite. In comparison, this one is only ok.

What an excellent recipe! I had to make slight changes (that I don't think would change things very much) based on ingredients I didn't have. I didn't have meat tenderizer or garlic powder, so I used a tiny pinch of sea salt and a shake of Tastefully Simple garlic garlic. We also like spicy so i added a dried pepper blend we made. I should mention i used this on venison so we over dried a little, but now we want to make it with "all the meats" lol. My husband keeps asking when we are getting a food slicer and if he can cut up all the roasts in the freezer!

I added crushed pepper to the marinade to kick it up a notch. To dry it I threaded the meat on wooden skewers and hung them from the oven rack. The meat dried more evenly and produced a more consistent product. I posted a couple of pics.

OH MY YUM!  This is the best marinade.  We made jerky tonight, but will be using the marinade recipe for chicken and beef and then grill.  What I liked best was that it wasn't overly salty.  Just a wonderful flavor. YUM YUM YUM

I starting making jerky a few weeks ago, and have become addicted.  I made this recipe twice.  It is by far the best recipe I've tried out of the 6 batches of jerky I've made so far.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly, although I added fresh minced hot peppers (real hot!!, 2 ghost peppers and 2 fatali peppers in the first batch, and 6 hot peppers --2 ghost and 4 fatali-- in the second batch).  I also reduced the salt a bit in the second batch.  The results were fantastic.  I love spicy food and have a high threshold.  Adding the hot peppers, the jerky has a nice heat, with a punch at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!!

So dang good. Easy and great flavor. I doubled the recipe. Also, I'm not big on salt but love pepper so in my doubled recipe, I only did 3 tsp salt and 3 tsp pepper. Glad I did both. Next time I will use liquid aminos instead of soy sauce. I used sirloin tip and it was very easy to cut thinly so I didn't have to pound it out.

Perfect Lamb jerky! Everyone said it was the best jerky they have ever tasted. Especially when finding out it was made with lamb. A nice addition was including a few Hawaiian chili peppers in the mix.

** Just made this officially 5 stars. It is amazing! I also added some habanero flakes from my garden to a portion of the beef and it came out with a perfect taste and that slight sizzle I was looking for. I might just have to go get more meat and get this started again!**

4 stars only because I haven't tasted it yet... but boy does this look good! First time making jerky and so far so good! After reading comments saying it might be a little too salty, I subbed low sodium soy sauce and used 2/3 the added salt. I stuck a toothpick in the marinade before touching the beef and it was fantastic. Can't wait to see how it comes out in a few hours!

I've made it twice because my daughter lets her one year old twins chew on it for pacifiers. I didn't get any of the first batch.

It's ok, but most definitely not the best. I used this recipe to try something different and to see if I could come out with better jerky. Honestly, go buy a bottle of Allegro....it's a whole lot better than this recipe.

My son just started college and I wanted to send him some homemade "love" in his care package.  I chose this recipe, and I am so glad I did.  First time making jerky so I didn't dare change anything!  I can honestly say, I never will make any changes either.  I used two types of beef: London broil and top round.  I much prefer London broil.  The London broil cut was free of any fat or connective tissue which made the jerky's texture very consistent.  I placed the meat on 3 cookie sheets topped with racks.  I baked it in my oven set to 170 with the door propped open about 1/2" with a kitchen towel.  Steam still collected on the oven door and I just wiped it dry occasionally.
I started removing pieces of jerky from the oven after about 4 hours.  The larger pieces and the ones that were closer to the middle of the baking sheet took about 5.5 hrs.  The most helpful review stated to let the jerky cool completely before testing to see if it's done.  I doubled the recipe and 4 lbs of beef yielded 1.5 lbs of delicious jerky. If my son doesn't absolutely love this, he will be up for adoption. Thank you for the recipe and all of the helpful reviews.

We all loved this beef jerky! I omitted the salt,  used less of the liquid smoke (but will increase next time) and cooked it in the oven at 180 for 3 hours (turning over once) instead of the dehydrator.  Awesome!

I try other recipes for fun but I keep going back to this because it's my favorite and everyone keeps requesting it.  No need to change a thing with the recipe but I've perfected my technique with it.  
Keep an eye on the sales flyers.  You can often find London broil, top round, and bottom round for $3/lb.  Don't buy just anything, even if it means leaving the store with nothing.  Look for cuts that have a large fat cap on one end with NO or nearly no marbling.  Meat should be deep red.  Light red means small veins of fat running through it.  Great for steaks and roast, not good for jerky.  Cut the fat cap off and slice your jerky.
Put all dry ingredients in a magic bullet.  Use Kosher salt and black peppercorns and any other whole spices if possible.  Much better flavor from your spices and seasonings that way.  Grind and mix.  Then add liquid ingredients and mix in the magic bullet.  Get a smaller bowl, pour the marinade in, dredge a strip and place it in another bowl large enough to fit your meat.  Really easy and ensures a more consistent flavor in each piece.  
If desired, sprinkle with course ground black pepper before dehydrating to get a peppered jerky.  Add as little or as much as you like but start with a little on your first batch so you don't ruin a good batch of jerky.
And since food is about sharing - Cut strips into 1"x1" pieces when finished and store in a small mason jar.  Take a jar with you wherever you go and watch your friend devour it. (Bite size pieces

Excellent dish. Made a couple of adjustments. As recommended, doubled the marinade. Cut the round steak paper thin and marinated for about 40 mins. Also added some diced jalapeño and cubed summer squash. Cooked the marinade at the end with the squash

I made this recipe with a few deviations.  I started with a 2lb. eye of round.  I used Bragg Liquid Amino instead of Soy Sauce.  I did not add a meat tenderizer or liquid smoke.  I used a meat tenderizer mallet and I used my Bradley electric smoker with Hickory wood set at about 180 degrees, for about 6-hours.

I just made jerky for the first time and chose Doc's recipe (with a few adaptations) along with another similar recipe that used honey instead of brown sugar for my debut attempts.  Family and friends were invited to taste test the two recipes.  Doc's recipe won all the votes!  My changes: used "smoked" paprika, eliminated the salt, and changed the amounts of soy sauce (1/2 cup), Worcestershire sauce (1/2 cup), and liquid smoke (1 teaspoon).

My first time making jerky with my first dehydrator.  It was a huge hit!  I then became over confidant and my next batch was made with a marinade that I made up-----bad move--hahaa.  The dog liked it but no one else did including me.  I'm sticking with Doc's recipe from now on----thanks Doc!!

Absolutely fabulous! First time we made beef jerky - and my husband can't stop eating it! We used london broil and cut it against the grain resulting in a lot of tiny (and seriously addictively good) pieces and dried  it at the highest heat our dehydrator has(155F) for 4 hours.  Thanks, Doc!!!

Freshly ground pepper on top after tenderizing makes it great. 5.5-6 hours in my excalibur dehydrator at 155 degrees.

Followed every step except for the added salt. The recipe is PLENTY salty with full sodium soy sauce. Next time I will try with lite soy sauce. Thank you for the recipe! For those who say high salt is necessary for preservation, it isn't. If the meat gets to 160, it is safe per USDA guidelines. Refrigerate, vacuum seal, and eat within a week (shouldn't be a problem as this jerkey recipe is absolutely amazing)!

First time I made jerky that it came out really good! Only thing I did different was that I let the beef in the marinade for about 25 hours. It  'soaked' up all of the marinade and had a great taste.  
I also put my jerky on oven racks for 4.5 hours at 170 degrees with the door ajar.
This is my new benchmark for jerky!

Great flavor! Way better than store brands. This is my new favorite marinade. I used more beef than the recipe called for, so I had to add a few tablespoons of beef stock to cover the meat. Makes about twice the jerky that you get in store bags for half the price. Goooo Mountaineers!

I found this recipe to be very salty, the smoky taste was way too overpowering, and it covered up all of the other delicate flavors. So, I will be trying this again but either with no smoked flavoring at all, or with a different brand/variety. By the way - which Liquid Smoke did you use? Mesquite? Hickory? I used Mesquite and it just steps all over the other flavors. Thanks for sharing.

I have used this recipe many times not just on beef but also on venison, pork and turkey, it has never disappointed. On occasion I have switched it up a bit and used honey or maple syrup instead of brown sugar. I will warm the marinade in the microwave for 30 seconds to help dissolve ingredients before I saturate each piece of meat and put in another bowl. Once all meat has been coated I pour remaining marinade over meat, cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, rotating top and bottom to make sure every piece soaks up the goodness. The butcher at my local grocery store will slice roast into equal thin strips saving me time.

I made this using the dehydrate setting on my oven.  First time making jerky.  They came out so wonderful and perfect.  I followed the marinade recipe exactly.  For dehydrating I set the oven to 155 F and verified it with an oven thermometer.  At 4 hours the texture and look was great.  Then, following some googled safety advice I took them out, bumped the oven to bake at 275 F and then put the strips back in for 10 minutes.  The strips turned to a dark mahogany with a perfect texture.  I also strung the strips on bamboo skewers so they hung down in the oven.  All in all, very successful and I will be repeating very soon.  I plan to double/triple but will do multiple single batches as I'm not sure if this recipe will multiply correctly because of the salt factor as indicated in other reviews.  The single batch version is wonderful.

This is the very first recipe I tried when I received my dehydrator. It turned out AWESOME! Thank you so much for sharing. I brought it into work and they devoured it.

Great recipe, made as is since I hate rating something if I made changes. Good flavor. Next time I make it, I will use less soy sauce; my son tasted it right away. And it was too salty. Other than that, the flavor was very very good.

Used Jerky gun for ground turkey and decided on second batch to omit liquid smoke.  Used hickory on Traeger for 4 hours and turned out wonderful.  
These do not last as everyone in the house eats them.

This is ok... I mean nothing to rave about... not even good enough to bring into work and brag about. My husband and I will eat what we made, but with that said, all the others we have made we eat fairly quickly, this one is still in the cupboard. I wont make this one again.

I needed a recipe for my new dehydrator, and this one will do just fine.
I used a brisket sliced against the grain 1/4 inch thick.  I trimmed off the fat.
I did not use Worcestershire sauce.
I did not use meat tenderizer.
I did not used onion powder.
I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.
I used mesquite liquid smoke.
All other ingredaments were used.
I marinated for 2 days because I got injured and was not able to proceed with project on time.
After marinade, I put in fry pan high heat just to grey both sides.  I am really anal about such things as bacteria.
After the pan, I laid the pieces on paper towels to absorb moisture and oil.
Once semi dry, and laid on fresh paper towels, I covered with paper towels and beat the  out of it with a meat tenderizer/hammer using the pokey side.
Then I sprinkled with extra black pepper, placed on fresh paper towels and entered into dehydrator max temp for 4 hrs.

Came out tasting awesome.  just a little too dry for me though, but very tender.  I think I will check the next batch in 2 hrs.  Or maybe I will just make a bigger batch.  I know, I will make a bigger batch AND check it in 2 hrs.

I used sirloin and omitted the meat tenderizer as I'm sensitive to the chemicals in it.
The meat jerky came out delicious and tender, though it was a bit salty for my taste. The next time I make this I will cut the salt in half and possible add a bit of red pepper flakes to give it some spice.

Excellent recipe! We've used both a standard dehydrator and the oven and both turned out excellent. We've also varied the marinating time from about 8 hours to 24 and either way you can't go wrong with this one!

Wonderful recipe!
I used Bragg's Aminos instead of soy sauce, and added 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder, then baked the strips in my oven at 180F for 3 1/2 hours. I will be making this again.

Jerky is my favorite road trip food... so much so I've tried (and reviewed) dozens of store-bought brands. Small Batch and Big Box... the good, the bad and the ugly. I'm going to try your recipe and see how it compares! http://jerkyaficionado.com

Made the recipe per the directions except no meat tenderizer and no liquid smoke. Put it on the Treager for 4 hours and it came out perfect. My favorite jerky recipe so far!

Not the best recipie, bit the family loves it. I had to cut the pepper back 50% and instead of nasty liquid smoke. I put in 2 Tbsp Montreal steak flavoring. in my dehydrator at 180 degrees and after its done it doesn't last, they eat it so fast.

Tried this yesterday. Yum. As written this recipe is up there with the best jerky I've eaten. Make it as is first, then adapt to your taste the next time. Personally, the only change I plan on making is to add a few drops of hot sauce to the marinade. Not to make it very hot, just for another layer of pepper flavor. Delicious.

I skip the salt and use low sodium soy sauce ( if possible) and make it as thin as possible a slice about 10 sheets of paper thick will have a drying time of 2-3 hours if done right ( 160 degrees Fahrenheit in a dehydrator)

I followed the marinade instructions and the resulting jerky turned out a LOT better than the store bought one. The end result was a jerky that was better than what I had expected. I don't have a dehydrator. I used the oven heated at 165 F for about 6 hours. I put a wooden spoon in the door for air circulation.

I have done this several times and stuck to the recipe all but once. The second time I only let it marinate a couple of hours and it came out terrible. I make sure it soaks overnight. Also, I smoke it rather than add the liquid smoke and that works well. I dry it for an hour in the dehydrator them put it in the smoker for about 2 hours. Wow is this good. Follow exactly, or minor changes, this is a good recipe.

This was my first go at beef jerky.  Came out superb!!! Tripled the recipe (I am a go big or go home kinda gal).  I made it to bring to a couples' weekend and could not be more proud of the result.  Making it myself, I especially loved knowing exactly what is in the jerky.  Plus, I think it tasted much better than any store bought beef jerky I've had.  ~Slightly freezing the meat before slicing really helped me get consistent slices; also it didn't seem to matter if I cut with the grain of the meat or against.  My dehydrator took about 4 to 5 hours, I checked the jerky and pulled out the done pieces as they finished. Thanks for all the "trials and errors", you've made a winner.

Couple tips I can give is to (1) dry the meat after marinating between paper towels. This will help the process, since you are trying to dry the meat. The flavor is already absorbed from marinating. Mine marinated for about 36 hours. (2) I sprinkled the dry seasonings on the meat first and then poured the wet ingredients on. I found this easier to incorporate. (3)I used the oven at 170 degrees F instead of a dehydrator. I bought a sirloin roast and sliced it super thin. It took about 2-3 hours. I turned them after an hour and about every 20-30 minutes after that. This is my first time making jerky and I can't believe how good it is. Oh, I also added a 1/4 cup water to the mix to cut back on the salt from the other reviewers complaints.

I got rave reviews. I did not have meat tenderizer so I used a lime. (The meat will not taste of lime.) I also added a teaspoon of hot chili powder to the marinade. I ground black pepper over the the slices before drying.

I used reduced sodium soy sauce but hardly think that is the reason for total lack of flavor. I use it for other jerky recipes and no difference in taste.

I'm a jerky junkie and have been for years.  I used this recipe to feed my addiction and save money from buying prepared jerky by making my own.   This recipe is fantastic and beats any jerky out on the market.  Thank you for posting this recipe. BTW I sliced the meat thin using my meat slicer and skipped the pounding part and it turned out just fine to me.  I do like my jerky just a little on the tough side. Otherwise, as my husband says, it's not jerky if it's too tender.

You might as well double this recipe to start with. This is by far the best basic jerky recipe out there. As is it is GREAT and it leaves room for tweaking with out destroying the results. Add a teaspoon  of ground or crushed red pepper for a little kick. Bump up the sugar or add honey for a little sweater side. Add a couple of tablespoons of teriyaki sauce. 100 times better than the store bought stuff and much cheaper too.

I have made this twice now and it is every bit as good as what I was paying $38.00 a pound for if not better, I did add some crushed red pepper flakes and right before drying gave it a good shot of course ground black pepper. Thanks Doc!!! I am going to try it in the smoker next time.

Way to salty! I like the flavor, but I am going to cut out  most of the salt next time, since I think the soy sauce has enough salt.

This is excellent. I have the butcher cut the beef so I start with very thin slices. I do not use liquid smoke or meat tenderizer, but I do start with a good cut of beef. My family and friends love it.

I just received my first dehydrator.  After much research, I decided to try this recipe in hopes to 'get it right' the first time around.  This marinade isn't just the best....it's perfection!  My picky husband tried the first piece and told me I had to hide it otherwise it would all be gone by morning.  Thank you for the years of trial and error!

This recipe was really good!  Because I was letting it marinade overnight, I omitted the salt based on other reviews.  I used the hickory flavor of liquid smoke, and a london broil cut against the grain.  I would recommend checking it every hour after the first 2 hours.  I have a dehydrator and took it off after 6 hours - probably an hour too long.  Any longer and it would have become brittle.

I tried this recipe with a couple variations.
1.) I used venison
2.) I marinated it for 30 hours
3.) I eliminated the liquid smoke and meat tenderizer, then dried it in the smoker using apple wood.
4.) I didn't pound it thin. I prefer a thicker meatier jerky.
5.) I separated the marinade and the meat to two bowls and added about four tablespoons of pureed scotch bonnets to one of the bowls. (It was spicy, but not unbearable).

My only regret is that I didn't make more. I took the batch to work and only got one piece for myself. everybody that tried it came back for more.

I make jerky often and tried this for an alternative to my regular recipe. I didn't add meat tenderizer (why would you; it's jerky), added half tsp. of cumin and half tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes and it came out really flavorful and delicious. This will be my go-to recipe for now. I will take the tip from above and start using curing salt to extend the life of the product.

You did it! This is truly a great recipe with tons of flavor. We have made this countless time so thank you! The only addition we did to the recipe was marinated the venison for 3 days. It was so good every time!

I have tried this a few times and love it. I have tweaked it slightly, double the brown sugar, onion and garlic, half the salt, and use chipotle instead of paprika!  I have also added honey garlic sauce or teriyaki sauce.

This recipe is very easy to make and very tasty.  I made it exactly as stated except for the meat tenderizer and garlic powder because we didn't have any.  I used fresh garlic instead of the powder.

Excellent recipe, great flavor.  I skipped the tenderizer because I like my jerky tough.  Also I used chili powder on half of it instead of liquid smoke which made for a spicier jerky.

Very good!  I rated 4/5 because I cut down the salt -- it would have been too salty for us with the recommended amount.  We love it!

I used antelope with this recipe.  It was very easy to throw together and tasted great.  It was a little spicier than I normally like but overall was a recipe worth keeping.

This is way better than the store bought. I got a dehydrator for Christmas and I have made about 4 batches of jerky! Great recipe!!
