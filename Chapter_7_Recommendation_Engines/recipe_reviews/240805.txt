Instead of deep frying scooped out balls with a disher and nestled them in corn bread batter in a mini muffin pan then baked for 25 min. in the oven. Definitely will make it again

This was a great recipe for boudin.  I used Panko for the breadcrumbs and the only thing different I did was use buttermilk instead of the egg wash for the breading/ coating.  Made a basic remoulade sauce to dip and these were pure bliss.  Tip: Not mentioned in the recipe but make sure to let the balls rest for about 15 minutes after breading so that they set properly and when you fry them the coating won't fall apart. Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing! 
Hoping they freeze well because I doubled the recipe and it made over 70 balls! Update...freezes well after  frying, just pop them in the oven t heat up :)

My (non-Cajun) perspective is that these were a LOT of work, but I agree that they are worth it. At my store I had to buy 4lbs of pork, so I made about 8 lbs of sausage/paste and froze 6lbs. I cooked 1lb pretty badly. With no thermometer., it now seems best to heat the oil on medium, and watch carefully, maybe removing sooner than  suggested. The 2nd lb, kept in the fridge for a few days before cooking, was great. Definitely include remoulade! I eat these as a main course or sometimes re-heated for a spicy breakfast.

I did not deduct points for the work or possible nutrition issues, since these are all stated up front.

I loved it. Missouri girl with Cajun heart! I made it all in one day. Can't wait to let it sit in fridge to absorb all the flavors.

These are perfect. I waited and let each part sit over night as suggested. I can't believe how good these are. Thanks for the recipe.

I baked and maybe too long. Theyâ€™re a bit dry, but the flavor is wonderful. Now I need to make my remoulade.
