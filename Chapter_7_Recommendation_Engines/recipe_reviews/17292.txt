This is the second time I am reviewing this...This time around, I used heavy cream instead of milk and almost 1 can of corn instead of frozen - no wierd chewy bits as before with the frozen corn.  Made one loaf with corn & one without - the loaf with corn was moister and more flavourful.  I also made one mistake loaf where I used 1 cup of milk (with corn)- that actually was the moistest loaf.  And the honey gave it a good flavor.  I used 
loaf pans, which required about 45 minutes to cook.

Overall, this is a very good base recipe.  After making a test batch, I made the following alterations, and they turned out really well!  Take any you would like!  Also, as with any quick bread or cake, MAKE SURE you cream your butter and sugar well (i.e. a minimum of 4-5 minutes) and that all your ingredients are room temperature to ensure even baking.
1.  I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 15 minutes and added this mixture after adding the flour/baking soda.
2.  I read the other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. (although I didn't think they were too sweet before - I just like really sweet cornbread).
3.  Again, off the other reviews, I added about 3/4 of a can of kernel corn, drained, instead of frozen (the frozen was a bit chewy).
4.  Instead of upping the milk, I stirred in 1/4 c of sour cream before the kernel corn.  Made a nice texture difference.

These are very tasty corn muffins, and my daughter's favorite!  I used freshly ground corn and soft wheat, making them come out a little more dense, but delicious and hearty.  I also subsituted canned for frozen corn with great results.  The recipe takes exactly one regular sized can of corn.  This is definitely a keeper.

These muffins were a bit too sweet for my taste.  I would cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup next time.  Remember to thaw the corn; otherwise, the kernels will be too dry.  This recipe will also yield 24 mini-muffins.

Can you say yummmmmmyyyy??? These were so moist and delicious. Though I baked them in a rectangular class baking dish instead of a muffin tin and it took about 15 min longer to bake. They turned out great.  They were sweet and we used Brummel and Brown on them and had them with chili. They were fantastic!!

Excellent! I had to omit the corn kernels, however-didn't have any available at the time. But they were still lovely and sweet. Very good

These were so delicious!  I made them in mini-loaf pans and ate a slice in the morning for breakfast.  My boyfriend always wants me to make these again.  I followed the recipe exactly and plan to double or triple the recipe next time!

Very nice and light -- great with chili. I might increase the honey next time to add a little more sweetness.  I made them as mini-muffins -- just the right size for the kids.

For me recipe as written...it was too sweet and not enough like cornbread. I could of easily served this with strawberries and whipcream for the perfect "strawberry shortcake" concept. I decided to make this recipe again the following day with some changes, and made it in the traditional style regular pan. I reduced the honey to 1/8 cup. Sugar 1/2 cup. salt 3/4 tspn. cornmeal 3/4 cup + 1/8 cup more. baking powder 3/4 tspn. milk 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup more. I also put the corn in the food processor for a two or three times quick pulse spins. Everything else in recipe is ok to me. I found that this was much better for regular cornbread and still plenty sweet without going overboard. I enjoyed this batch much better than the first one. If approved by my supervisor at my job, I will bring her a sample of the revised recipe today and hopefully use this as as our go-to recipe at the hospital where I work as a baker. I think our customers would enjoy this.

Very delicious.  Moister and heavier than regular corn bread.  Didn't need anything on them. Best when warm.

My family found these muffins too sweet and dry.  They seemed more like corn-cake muffins.  Also, the corn kernels were sticky and got caught in our teeth?!  I can't imagine putting these together with chili as some people suggested!

I believe this is the best cornbread I have ever made.  I have made the amusement park cornbread (also from this site) and they taste almost the same. I wanted to add some vanilla extract but was out.  I used a full cup of sugar and baked mine in an 8x8 inch baking pan rather than the muffin tins.  It came out very sweet..almost like a cake, but tasted fantastic.  If you like sweet cornbread, I definitely recommend this recipe!! Thanks a million Lisa.

These were good but seemed to have "pockets" of sweetness - maybe the brown sugar?  Next time, I'll use the honey.  Rated 4 stars. 
Really wasn't crazy about the corn, so made with the honey and "craisins" instead and put into loaf pan.  This got 5 stars.  Took about 50-55 min to cook and had to use a sharp knife to tell if it was done - toothpick came out clean but center was still liquid.

These were fantastic!  Everyone in the family raved.  We didn't even need honey because they were so sweet. However, I found that it made a lot of batter.  I made 12 muffins, but they were full to the brim and took a lot longer to bake. Next time I will make several smaller ones instead of 12 monster muffins!

The texture is not crumbly and cake-like but is firmer and denser. It has an excellent flavor, rises well and tastes wonderful with fat-free margarine and/or honey. I will make this again.

great cornbread muffins!!  one thing i will definitely change next time, is to decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup.  they were pretty sweet.  i did use whole milk though since that's all i had - it may have made them even sweeter.  i can see how these would be great with chili.  thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe. These muffins are excellent to say the least. I was never a fan of cornbread until I tried these. They are sweet, moist, and very flavorful. Easy to make and go great with chili.

Awesome recipe. I have been searching for this recipe ever since they closed the nearest Kenny Rogers Restaurant. They were moist, sweet and perfect.  I served them with chili, but ended up eating them as a snack all night long. Thanks for the recipe. Nancy

LOVED IT!!
I will not have another sweet corn bread recipe.  I took the advise and replaced thee honey with sweet bread - LOVED IT! Added a nice flavor to the muffins.  

My guests would not leave without the recipe! LOVED IT!  :-)

This tasted like the Kenny Rogers muffins, I used brown sugar instead of white, turned out caramalised..my children loved the supersweet corn kernels, since I ran out of plain flour, so I substituted SR flour and did not use any rising agent, interesting, I left the batter in the fridge for 4 hours (cos I needed only in the evening) and the muffins rose very nicely, Crisp on the outside, moist in the inside...Awesome!!

My whole family loved these.  I used an equal amount of brown sugar, because I didn't have any honey.  I will definitely be making these again!

Very similar to the muffins from a chicken chain restaurant.

Replacing the honey with the same amount of packed brown sugar results in a nuttier, richer flavor.

This is a very, very good recipe! The sweetness and the corn along with the honey was great. The only thing I did different was I made this in an 8" iron skillet. I rubbed butter in the skillet before I poured the corn bread in. I baked it at 350 for 18 minutes. Turn out golden and delicious. Will make this again for sure! Thanks

This is a GREAT recipe! Made it for a family potluck, a double batch for 10 people, and they ate it ALL! I followed the recipe exactly except for the corn. I used plain, whole-kernel canned corn instead. I also used a electric hand mixer to cream the wet ingredients and mix the additions until I got to the corn and milk, which I mixed in by hand. I put the double batch in a 9X13 cake pan and in the 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes and it came out perfect and moist, and not too dense. It was an instant hit.... everyone said, this is GREAT... that recipe is a KEEPER! This IS my cornbread recipe. {Perfect with chili, too!)

5 Stars for the product... Not so much for the representation. These were very tasty and I love it when a recipe comes out picture perfect like mine did. Makes me sorry I didn’t have a picture! But if you are confused, and you were looking for a cornbread recipe this isn’t it. These are more accurately called corn meal muffins and not corn bread muffins. I am undecided whether the corn kernels (I used canned) added or not. If they are muffins I suppose they might be the equivalent to raisins or nuts. If it’s corn bread they were a bit over the top. They are real sweet, somewhat dense and rich, muffins.  Since they also call for the honey, I even cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup. I used the real butter because I had some but I usually don’t. I keep honey on hand but rarely use more than a Tablespoon in bread machine recipes. Both these expensive ingredients and the time it took (not too long, but it was a genuine baking exercise) make me wonder if these were worth it. The real butter made me ponder that they weren’t very health-wise to make often either. I made these when I would have actually made a Jiffy corn muffin mix instead but I didn’t have any so I decided to make from scratch. Jiffy mix is really fast to make, slightly sweetish, more cornbread-like, and a lot less expensive. If you want muffins these are gourmet corn meal muffins. If you want a slightly sweet corn bread, in individual muffin cup servings, use Jiffy.

love Love LOVE these!  I made a huge batch of these for a holiday gathering, then used the batter to add jalapeno and pineapple for a few dozen like this site's "Hot and Sweet Cornbread", and cheddar cheese and canned green chiles to another few dozen, and left the last few dozen plain.  All were wonderful, and all freeze well.

Replaced the milk with cream and used 1/3 c honey rather than the 2/3 c white sugar (in addition to the 1/4 honey the recipe already called for.) They were great.  Only took 18 minutes to bake.

Maybe I did something wrong (probably.. I'm a horrible baker) but these were horrible. They were dense and 'hockey puck' like and just yuck. Next time I'll save the time it took to make these and my reputation on making superb recipes and stick to the boxed mix. That works every time.. this.. DIDN'T.

These are great muffins and the perfect bread to go with our turkey chili.  The extra corn keeps these very moist.  Next time I will use liners only because the sides browned a little much and I think the liners would keep these looking a little nicer.  Overall, the flavor was great, especially for those who like a little sweeter corn muffin.  No need to add extra honey to these.

I am giving this a 4 because I used a boxed cornbread mix. I added 1 egg, 2/3 c milk, 2 Tbsp sugar, 3/4 c corn, and the green parts of 2 scallions. They tasted amazing but they baked kinda funny. Its almost like they had a blow out on the top! Next time I think I will add a touch more sugar.

Amazingly moist and delicious! We used 1 can of  corn (rather than frozen), as suggested by other reviewers. We also used 1/3 cup of honey, and only 1/3 cup of white sugar; the muffins had a wonderful taste of honey (normally, we make honey butter, but they didn't need anything). We also used 1% milk, which worked fabulously! And, 1/3 cup of chopped green chilis -- a great balance with the honey taste. They were done in 15 minutes and were moist, tender, and truly fabulous!

Delicious.  I made the recipe "as-written" and they came out extremely moist and very flavorful, but not overly sweet.  I made them for a potluck and received numerous compliments. Cornbread-type recipes can often be on the dry-side and crumbly, and these were neither.  Leftovers were still delicious two days later after being warmed briefly in the microwave.

Note: watch the baking time--like another reviewer mine came out a bit too brown on the bottom so I recommend checking them about 5 minutes before the recommended time and see how they're doing.

Yum, Yum.  Great muffins.  I used margarine instead of butter and skim milk instead of whole and the taste was fantastic.  Next time though I will melt the butter before using it and simply stir the first four ingredients together.

I really liked these muffins. I used canned creamed corn (3/4 c.) instead of corn kernals and bumped up the cornmeal to a full cup to make up for the liquid in the creamed corn. They turned out really well - very moist and full of flavor!

We love these and I make them regularly as a side.  I follow the recipe however I leave out the frozen corn kernels.  I tried them once and found the kernels to be a bit chewy...and it's just an extra thing. They taste very good without them so I just leave them out now.

Mmmmmm.....I've never made corn muffins before so I didn't have any cornmeal but I just add more flour for the omitted cornmeal and instead of frozen corn and milk, I added one 10oz. can of creamed corn.  Delicious!

This was excellent! I made it for dinner, to go with our chili, and it was a hit. I used fresh frozen corn, and did not change a thing. I doubled the recipe and made 12 normal sized muffins and two mini-muffin pans. Yummy!

I omitted the sugar, added just a little bit of maple syrup, soaked the cornmeal in milk as some other reviewers recommended, and substituted applesauce and a little sunflower oil for the butter since we're low on butter right now. To thaw the frozen corn, I let the kernels sit in warm water while I mixed up the other ingredients and it ended up looking basically the same as canned corn, only without the BPAs from the can! I also used more cornmeal than the original called for, about half cornmeal, a fourth white flour, a fourth whole wheat flour. Turned out really well. The original recipe plus the reviewers' comments and a little innovation combined quite well! Thanks for this recipe.

Exactly what I was wanting. Used fresh cooked corn cut off the cob (needed to use it up is why) and half and half instead of milk. Made 24 minis.  Very yummy!

Loved these!  I'm a big fan of whole corn in cornbread and these didn't disappoint.  I was looking for a cakier texture so substituted vegetable oil for the butter and they came out very moist and tender.  I didn't find them too sweet at all.  One thing though, I'll make sure to fill the muffin cups almost all the way to the top next time.  I filled to the standard 2/3 and ended up needing 4 extra muffin cups, but these don't rise a ton.  In any event, these will definitely be joining my go-to recipes and I'm looking forward to playing around with add-ins.  Maybe shredded cheese next time?

Very tasty cornbread muffins!  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is related to texture - they were slightly more dense than I prefer.  Very good flavor, though.  Thumbs up from the family :)

This was a hit a our teacher appreciation luncheon-it went to quickly that I was asked if I would mind running back home to cook a double batch before the second wave of teachers came through to eat. I didn't have honey so omitted it, and used creamed corn. Got many raves.

Delicious! I had some corn on the cob already cooked, so I just used those kernels. I also blended them up, so as to make them creamier, and it might have been over 3/4 cups. I made corn dog muffins out of these by pan frying a few hot dogs, slicing them diagnally(sp?) and putting them at the bottom of pan. Were sweet, corn tasting and everyone loved them!

I, too, made the following slight adjustments based on most helpful reviews: - 1. Soaked cornmeal in heavy cream for 15 minutes 2. Used canned corn kennel instead of frozen ones. Result?? Irresistibly tasty and moist muffin treats for me with co-workers !

I did a head-to-head bakeoff between these muffins and "Best Ever Corn Muffins" from this site. These were the winner by far. Perfectly sweet, tender get grainy cornbread muffins.

Definetly needs more milk than the recipe calls for - the recipe as written is  very thick. Without the extra milk, they were a little dense. With the extra milk, they're moist and delicious! Cut the sugar to 1/2 though.... I have a sweet tooth so I didn't listen to the advice in the reviews, but they mean it... cut the sugar.

Really good!  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey instead - I like the honey flavor!  Also, I had a total of 1 cup cornmeal, so I used it all, and reduced the flour by 1/4 cup.  Turned out wonderful!

Yum!!  This cornbread was delicious!  I love how this recipe incorporates honey and butter right into the cornbread.  I made in 8x8 pan and it turned out wonderfully.  It was great with the corn, but seems like it would also be good if you skipped the corn (I'll try that next time and compare).  Thank you!

These are very good.  My husband is in Mexico (on business) this week, so I thought I'd make some Mexican food (which is funny because he doesn't like Mexican food & is stuck there eating it....poor Tom).  I scaled the recipe to 6 and they went well with our little mexican buffet.  Thanks Lisa.

Wonderful recipe! These are sweet, dense, yet moist muffins that go perfectly with a savory dish such as chili. I used the full amount of sugar called for by the recipe and it worked great. Instead of frozen corn I used canned. I've made this recipe twice - once with corn and once without. The recipe was great both ways but the corn really adds something special. (if you include the corn, you'll have enough batter for 13 muffins. Without corn, 12 muffins) If you have leftovers, no problem - just pop them in the microwave and they're piping hot and moist as ever!

I've made this recipes about 6 times. The first time I followed the instructions exactly with the exception of using 3/4 canned corn kernels instead of frozen. They were perfect. The second time, I followed some of the reviewers recommendations. I reduced the sugar by half, and used the entire 15.25 oz can of corn, drained. The extra corn worked out perfectly, but I prefer the recommended amount of sugar in the original recipe. My favorite way to make these muffins: follow recipe exactly with exception of using an entire can of corn. Make mini muffins adding large slices of all beef hotdogs to each muffin. Bake at 375 for 18 minutes. I've had to start doubling the recipe because my teenagers and husband devour these. They are so much better than the processed corn dogs bought at the supermarket.

These are excellent-definitely more of a corncake/muffin so it's sweeter. I have a sweet tooth but these didn't need any more sweetener than they have. Very good with chili!!

These were delicious, but I have only rated 4 stars because I did make a change.  I used canned corn instead of frozen corn.  Next time I make these, I will add a can of diced chiles as well to make them "pop".

This muffin has great texture and wonderful corn flavor.  This recipe was a little too sweet for us though.

Love this recipe!  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and cut down on the sugar (and I'm glad I did. they were plenty sweet with 1/2 c of sugar and slightly less than 1/4 cup of honey).  I also used unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk or cream.  DELICIOUS!  Everyone loved them!  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good.  It's interesting that this was really sweet (even after cutting the sugar some) and had corn.  I substituted applesauce for butter.  I made this into mini-muffins and turned out to be a great snack!

This recipe turned out wonderful.  We had no frozen corn, so we used some canned corn, rinsed it thoroughly, then literally dried it on a kitchen towel (leftover corn was simply added to the chili we were eating with the muffins @ the time).  The end result was awesome. The muffins were not too crumbly or too chewy - they rose just the right amount & were wonderful.  I would guess that adding some diced up jalapenos or Anaheim peppers would be a nice way to jazz these up, since they were just a tad sweet.  This recipe has been added to my recipe box and is definitely a recipe that will be used over and over again.

I'm pretty picky about cornbread and have only found a couple of recipes that I like.  This was not one of them.  I made a batch of these to compliment a crockpot of chicken chili for a group of 10 people.  The chili was devoured but no one liked these muffins.

Here, from Brazil, I bake this recipe and found it delicious! The muffins came from oven fluffy and so sweet! I add some fennel seeds to dough, because we use to add this ingredient to cornbread cakes we call "bolo de fubá" in portuguese. I love those muffins!

Good recipe.  Substituted 3/4 cup creamed corn instead of thawed frozen corn to help make the muffins more moist.   I may add more honey next time but didnt find the muffins too sweet to begin with.  They went well with chilie or alone as a breakfast muffin.

Fantastic!  After reviewing the written comments, I decreased the white sugar by half, but otherwise followed the recipe.  These were moist and delicious.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  A keeper for sure.

Very good, I did make a few changes. After reading other reviews about them being too sweet, I didn't add any honey. Instead I added 3 garlic gloves, a teaspoon of rosemary, a teaspoon of pepper, a few dashes of tyme and then about 1 1/2 cups of cheese. ( I did a mix of cotija, sharp chedder, reggiano and parmesan) After cooking for 20 minutes I pulled them out and sprinkled some parmesan on top of each of them and put them back in for another 5 minutes. Really tasty, sweet yet savory as well.

This is a favorite recipe of mine.  I like to serve these muffins with chicken or as a side to any dish, really.    I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and use 1 can of drained kernel corn.  Delicious!

These were great I forgot the corn but it didn't matter, I did add 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup because I read some of the reviews of it being dry.

I had two extra cobs of corn, and in a family of 5, that's not enough to go around, so I looked in my recipe book for something that used just shy of a cup of corn, this was it.  The muffins came out a tad dark because I don't use papers on muffins (personal preference) so next time I'll take down the cooking time.  Inside, they were moist and perfect.  Even the ones that were left out on the counter overnight were very dense and moist in the morning.  I was very pleased.  They were sweeter than most corn bread I make, but since they were made as a side to my husband's chilli, the sweetness was a nice counterpoint to the salt and spice.

This is a great recipe, but with some changes.  I leave out the honey - otherwise it is too sweet. And I make it with 1/2 cornflour & 1/2 cornmeal, plus 1/2 cup more milk, or else it it gritty.  It also needs more baking powder (3 tsp) so it is not too dense.  Some other substitutions I have used that have turned out great are replacing 1/3 cup of white sugar with brown, and replacing 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  When I make them with the above changes, they are soft, moist, and delicious!

These muffins are absolutely delicious. My first time making anything corn bread and i have to say I'm very happy i picked this recipe. Instead of milk, i used half and half. I also replaced the frozen corn for canned corn. The muffins turned out so moist and good. ( I'm having one right now!)

I used Silk brand soy creamer instead of the milk as I cannot have dairy and the result was the most scrumptious corn muffin, so very good.  I also used canned corn instead of the frozen.  They were a little sweet as other reviewers have suggested and definitely will decrease the amount of sugar next time or better yet use all honey instead of sugar.  My muffins were very dense but also very moist and Oh so good with the Silk soy creamer

I tried this last night and my fiance and I both love it! It was the first time I'd ever made cornbread from scratch, and I couldn't have been more pleased. I didn't have any corn cornels, so I just cut that. Everything else I kept the same. Thanks for a great recipe, I'll use it all the time!

Found this recipe looking for something to serve with chili that wasn't a standard cornbread mix.  My mom always makes really sweet tasting cornbread, which made me want to try this.  The only variation I had was using cake flour to use the last of it up & they came out very moist & fluffy.  This recipe DOES COME OUT pretty sweet tasting --so some might want to scale the sugar back a little if they're not looking for a very sweet tasting bread.  This recipe turned out great and everyone who tried them loved them.  I'll definitely make them again and again.

I did cut back the sugar per other reviewers suggestions (used 1/2 c).  I thought they were plenty sweet and the full amount of sugar called for would have been too much.  This recipe made a lot of batter, I ended up having to fill the muffin cups up more than the usual 2/3 full, they were filled to the tops,  I baked for 18 min. and the bottoms burned, (could have been my oven).   Overall good taste, but my boyfriend was freaked out by the pieces of corn, and wouldn't eat more that one, I will make again w/out the corn as I liked the flavor, slightly sweet and moist.

These were wonderful.  I was making a pot of brown beans and ham and didn't have any cornbread so I hopped on here and found these.  They were simple and all the ingredients were on hand.  I bakes them in star shaped muffin tins wc made for a pretty presentation.  I also used a half a can of corn and added chopped up jalapenos to it.  Between the sweetness from the corn and the heat from the peppers it was a mouthful of flavor.

These are great!  Changes I make:  reduce sugar to 1/2 cup (its still very sweet).  Replace half of the milk with sour cream or yoghurt (or sub buttermilk).  I use defrosted frozen corn, but if i'm out, i make it without the corn and its still awesome.

about 15 min in, i checked them and they looked a bit too crunchy on the outside, so i covered them with foil and put them back in for another 10-15 min. the result-crusty outside and moist inside! absolutely delicious!

Wow!  A recipe that my whole family likes and I even used some whole wheat flour.  Very impressive.  I used 1 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup white, regular cornmeal, and then increased the milk to 3/4 cup to compensate for the whole wheat.  This will be my only recipe for cornbread muffins from now on!  We all love the corn kernels and I also used a can of drained corn rather than frozen - thanks for the tip.

Delicious... I've never tasted such sweet cornbread.  It baked up super quickly and tastes, smells, and looks like a gourmet dish.

Well, I have to say that today I tried two different recipes and this one is a keeper! No baking powder aftertaste, not crumbly, sweet but not too sweet.  I made half the batch with corn (from a can) and half without.  Both were wonderful.  I am serving chowder for a ladies luncheon in a couple of days and will use this good recipe for delicious muffins.  I know it will be a hit!  Thanks

Wonderful! I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup as suggested and used canned corn instead of frozen, because that is what I had on hand. Yummy cornbread, thanks for posting this recipe.

Great very moist corn muffins!  Almost a bit too sweet, next time I might cut back on the sugar. Ate them all in a day!

Yum, Yum, Yum!!  That sums up these corn muffins.  This will be my cornbread recipe from now on.  No more box mixes for me!!  They were wonderful plain or covered in Honey Butter (from this site) as thequalitycookdotcom suggested.  I will make these again!!  Thanks!

WOW!!! This recipe was great. I followed the ingredients exactly with one exception: I melted the butter like other reviewers have suggested. The only other change I made was to bake them in my convection oven at 350...I usually like to bake bread at a lower temp for a little longer so that it cooks all the way through without burning the crust. When I mixed all the ingredients together, I thought I had done something wrong because the mixture was really thick. But they turned out perfect. My package of frozen corn was 16 oz, so i just tried to measure out half. That came to be about 1.5 cups of corn for me. I think next time I will use 2 cups. As another reviewer said, the corn really adds something special to this recipe. Also, other reviewers have said that these muffins are cake-like. Well, they are, but not overly so. Anyway you slice it, in my house, that's a good thing. They were definitely sweet and we loved them...Kinda like your grandmother from the South would make. If, however, you don't like sweet cornbread, I might suggest cutting the sugar some, but leave the honey. It makes the flavor unique. I served these with sweet cinnabutter, but we didn't need it. These muffins are both sweet and moist enough to stand alone! Great recipe! Thanks for sharing. Oh yeah, one more thing: I made 6 giant muffins instead of 12 regular sized ones...ENJOY!

I LOVED these muffins!  I have never cared much for cornbread, thinking it rather dry and bland, but these muffins won me over.  So much sweeter, tastier and moister than any I have had before.  I followed the recipe and mine raised beautifully and were moist on the inside while crunchy on the outside.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

These are pretty good.  They have a nice sweet flavor, which I like in cornbread.  The added kernel corn is a nice touch too.  However, this may be because I made them, then froze them for later.  They do freeze well, and I'd recommend this recipe to anyone who likes cornbread.

Yummy!  These were so good.  I made a big batch and froze most of them so we can pull them out and reheat for any meal of the week! I added extra cornmeal because I like mine really corny...

These were pretty good!  I halved the recipe and used yellow cornmeal.  Definitely a step up from a boxed mix, just plan on a little extra time for preparation.

Not bad, the real corn are a nice touch. Could use more corn meal and less flour, otherwise just a biscuit with corn in it. Taste: not bad.

This is a pretty good basic corn muffin recipe. I substituted a half can of whole kernel corn instead of the frozen. This is the second time I made this recipe and the 1st time was a rousing success! As before, I made this batch to accompany some turkey chili & my husband and I devoured them all! They were not too dry or too sweet. He was impressed with the added corn...made the muffins more hearty & flavorful. Will definitely make these again!

I have use the same recipe for corn bread for over 40 years.  Decided to change it up and try something new.  Very glad I did!  Excellent.  I used cream corn in place of kernels. Bake in  9x9" glass pan. No other changes.  Baked for 20 min, which was a few minutes too long. Would check at 15 the next time.

Tried the corn muffins today. They were every bit as good as the positive reviews claim. I used canned corn (the same amount as called for with the frozen). Also borrowed another reviewer's tip and pulsed the corn a few times in a mini food processor before adding. One other thing, I sifted the flour and used the same measure but of sifted. Yes they were sweet, deliciously sweet and moist. Just scrumptious.

This is a moist, dense, sweet treat.  It is more cake like than either cornbread or a corn muffin.  No butter or honey is needed to enjoy this muffin.  It was a perfect accompaniment to both chili and a salad lunch.  Thanks, Lisa K.

Family enjoyed these but felt they were a bit dry.  If I were to make again I would add some oil or make with creamed corn rather than kernel.

I love cornbread and corn bread muffins. I am delighted with this recipe.  Mine made 12 full size, delicious muffins.  Please note that I omitted the canned corn as I didn't have any at home.  Also, I baked mine for 20 minutes and they were slightly overdone. So, I suggest that you keep an eye on yours and possibly start checking them at about 15 minutes.

I will never use a package mix again. These were easy to make and turned out great.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

I was looking for a sweet cornbread recipe. I made it according to the recipe making no modifications. They were wonderful! Just sweet enough - the corn wasn't chewy as some other reviewers noted. They were moist and not dense as some other reviewers noted. Great recipe as it is written.

Very good.  Made it tonight and we really enjoyed it -- very closed to Famous Dave's!  

And (due to my 12yo daughter's using it up and not telling me) I found I had no baking powder.  Wound up mixing 1/2 tsp cream of tarter with 1/4 tsp baking soda, then measuring the 1/2 tsp for the baking powder.  I left out the corn.

Wonderful -- very nice flavor.  Thanks!

I used canned corn (creamed-style), because it was all I had on hand and the muffins came out very moist and delicious, with the perfect amount of sweetness. They were slightly more dense than normal, but were so good it didn't matter. They were a hit!

This recipe is quick, easy and tasty. I added glazed jalepeno peppers and a 1/2 cup of ultra sharp cheddar.
We made a honey chipotle butter with minced glazed jalepeno peppers to serve with it.  Delicious!

These were delicious!  I used 1 cup of cornmeal and 1 1/4 cup of flour instead and added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries (soaked in water first to plump them up) instead of corn kernels.  These are perfectly moist and so yummy!

I made these muffins with a slight adjustment and my husband (an avid corn muffin eater) said they were the best he's ever had.  I didn't have any honey, so I subbed in molasses, which gives a really nice rich flavor and a moist dense muffin!  Thanks a lot for the recipe, I've been searching for a good one for years.

Wow! These were amazing! I substituted the egg (I cut the recipe in half so I only needed one) for 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water and they turned out just as great! So sweet that this could even be used as a breakfast muffin

These were great and easy to make.  We like the little bits of corn -- I used fresh ears of corn, boiled until cooked, and then cut kernels off.  I needed 2 ears of corn to make a cup of kernels.  Like others said, they were sweet.  We made mini muffins with this and each had 2 with our stew.

I made these for Thanksgiving after making Cornbread Muffins II last year. I have to say I like them both! I think these have a more true corn bread consistency and texture though. I haven't decided if I like the pieces of corn though

These were excellent right out of the oven and the same day as baking. However, once they get microwaved they aren't as good. The corn gets really chewy, not a good thing.

I used a can of corn after drainng as others suggested and everyone loved the muffins!

They asked I make them again 2 weeks later and I made them last night.  We were out of honey so I substituted maple syrup and they liked them even more!  

I don't know of the maple syrup would do well with b-b-q and beans, but it added a comforting breakfasty flavor to our eggs and bacon.

These muffins are sweet, moist, and soooo good! The whole family liked them. What was not to like!  They are more like a dessert muffin though. So,I might not add the sugar next time or cut it back for health reasons. It would make a good alternative to a sweet and sugary dessert. I served them with a mexican casserole and can't wait to try them with chili!

After trying three different corn muffin recipes I finally found one I like.  These are a keeper. I used a can of corn based on other reviewers suggestions.  I also used slighty less honey (basically b/c I ran out).

Delicious muffins!  My only complaint is that the corn will get hard and nasty if you don't eat them the first day.  Only make what you need, or freeze immediately to avoid this problem!

I reduce sugar in recipes whenever I can so I used 1/2 cup vs 3/4 cup.  Instead of 1/2 cup of milk I used 1/4 cup of 1% milk and 1/2 cup light sour cream. I used fresh corn vs frozen.  I did not precook the corn. I also added 1/4 cheddar cheese and fresh chopped chives. Family really liked them.

I cut the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup, used fresh corn that I removed from the cob, and made into mini muffins to serve with a salad (Blueberry walnut salad)for a tea. Everyone enjoyed them. I cooked the mini muffins for 15 minutes - it made 3 dozen. The leftover are yummy too.

These were very good. I put less sugar and honey than the recipe called for because we were eating them with Cowboy Hash. However, they are sweet enough to enjoy as breakfast muffins.  The family gives it two thumbs up!

I always have to make these corn muffins when my sister comes over.  They are her favorite and she will not accept any others!  They make a pretty good size batch so I freeze the extras.  They reheat beautifully in the oven.

Very good recipe for muffins. Fluffy, sweet and yummie corn taste. I did use canned corn like mentioned in another review. Tasted great... Kids loved it.

I followed this recipe exactly as it said. I don't know why everyone is giving it 5 stars. I find it very bland.  I would not make these again.

Have made this recipe a couple of times.  First in a cast iron skillet (however it never got done in the alloted time and was always raw in the middle), and then as muffins like the recipe called for.  That was the way to go...  This in an absolutely incredible recipe.  Definite do over and over and over.

If I could have given these a 4.5 rating, I would have.  They were not quite a 5, but better than a 4.  Best corn muffin recipe that I have found yet.  Batter was thick, so I added a bit more milk - turned out just fine.  Also omitted the corn, because I didn't have any and didn't feel like running to the store.

I really enjoyed these muffins.  They were very sweet, but that's how I like them. I even overcooked them a bit and were still moist and chewy.

These were really great muffins, but I felt it was more cake-like than the cornbread muffins I'm used to. I mean, I LOVE cake, but not until after dinner. Next time I'll add less sugar and honey, that will probably make it perfect. I'll try creamed corn too...mmm...I can taste it now!

Thank you so much for this recipe! It's so easy to make and they are the best corn muffins I ever tasted. I've made these for my ladies Bible study and everyone loved them! My whole family loves them and like I said fast and easy to make! I make them with the canned corn but I use the kernels when I know they will all be eaten the same day. If I make them just for me and my husband I leave out the kernels because after a few days the kernels get sticky. They taste great with or without them! Thank you again. :)

I had to scale down the recipe by half, but these were the best tasting corn muffins that I have ever eaten. They were really moist. Just the way that I love them. My boyfriend/husband is already asking me when I am making them again. LOL

I will never be allowed to make jiffy again.  These were absolutely AMAZING.  If you aren't a corn bread person you will be after these.  I did skip the corn because I just felt it was weird with corn.

Made these with chili for the Super Bowl - though the chili got rave reviews, these muffins stole the show!! My friends agreed they were better than our fave cornbread from a local restaurant. I used only 1/2 C sugar and they were still pretty sweet, but that was not a bad thing! Might try just 1/3 C sugar next time, though. The frozen corn kernels were an awesome addition. I also subbed in vanilla soy milk for the milk and added a bit extra as others suggested - they were nice and moist and I know my friends and hubby will be requesting these often!!

I use this recipe exclusively for cornbread now.  The whole family loves it!  It's also very versatile, and there is quite a bit of wiggle room in this recipe - I have used whole wheat flour, canned corn, creamed corn, and it always turns out great.  Also, I love using this recipe as a topper for chicken pot pie.  Delicious!

These were wonderful! I modified them a tad..ran out of honey so used raw sugar instead & being a non dairy person, used vanilla soy milk.  Moist and tender. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  Using tips from other reviews I cut the sugar in half and only used 2 tablespoons of honey.  I doubled the milk because I didn't add the corn.  I baked it in a 9x9 pan. It was dense yet soft and very good tasting.  This will be a regular recipe for me.

I don't normally review recipes, but this one deserves it!  My husband made these for us this weekend and they were wonderful.  He did make a couple of small changes... First, being from Vermont, he used maple syrup instead of honey.  Secondly, we had just a little creamed corn leftover in the fridge.  He added about 1/2 cup to this recipe.  The muffins probably came out a little denser, but they were so incredibly moist!  We loved the little hint of maple syrup as well.  Thanks for a wonderful new additon to our favorite recipes!

These were VERY VERY dense.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 4 mini loaf pans to cook them in.  It took about 30 minuted for them to cook, and when we were eating them, my husband said they were more like a pound cake.  They tasted pretty good, though, hence the 3 stars.

I didn't really care for the texture of these muffins and they weren't sweet enough. As a base recipe it's OK, but I'd have to add quite a bit to it so that it was sweet and moist enough for my liking.

These muffins were great!  So moist and sweet, they are like they're little own dessert!  I used the canned corn like some of the reviews, it was a little too much chunckiness for me.  Next time I will use creamed corn.  Will make again!

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. It sounds like a winning combination of ingredients but mine turned out dry and very dense even warm from the oven.  They did have a very corny taste though.

These corn muffins are fantastic! They're moist, a little sweet( I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup as others had recommended), and easy to make.  I've tried other recipes and they always come out dry and/or bland.  These were great!  I'm definitely using this recipe again.

Not at all like cornbread--next time I'd use more cornmeal and less flour. These muffins were tasty enough, but I wanted cornbread and these did not deliver.

Also, I always add frozen corn to my cornbread, but this recipe calls for way too much. Cut the corn in half and it would be much more pleasant.

I love this recipe!  This was the first time in many moons that I made muffins from scratch and it was really simple... a great compliment to my beef stew. I made some basic exchanges to suite my needs. I used splenda instead of sugar, egg substitute instead of real eggs, 2% Milk, and creamed corn instead of frozen.  This is definitely a muffin of substance and man was it gooood!

Used 1/2 cup Splenda in place of sugar and 1 can of drained corn.  Baked in 8x8 pan for 30-35 minutes.

If you like Jiffy you will probably like this. My boys have been raised on Jiffy but I'm now trying to get more whole grains into our diet. Another reviewer suggested a whole wheat option that I tried (still too dense of my boys). I'm not giving up on the recipe though. Next time 1/2c. whole wheat + 1c. white flour. Also, many suggestions to sub can corn for the frozen, it was still too chunky. I'm going to try the cream corn option next time. There is enough potential to try again, a tasty and healthier option to Jiffy.(the batter tastes just like Jiffy!)

For those of you who did not like the corn in these muffins because they turned out dry or hard.  I put the milk and THAWED corn in the blender and pulsed it a few times. No hard or dry corn pieces.

I found the muffins to be sweet and wonderful. I just loved it. I did make a few changes. I used butter milk instead of the milk & used a small can of creamed corn instead of the corn. I was not thrilled about the corn bits in the muffins. And I made them in a mini muffin pan and baked them for 15 minutes. A great muffin. I will be using these muffins for breakfast with small bits of bacon. I am thinking of breakfast already. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG!  Love this recipe!  Like many others before me, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used about 2 TBS of honey.  I also used canned corn instead of frozen.  I have never made cornbread before but this recipe was amazing.  Definite keeper.

this one is a winner! butter really brings out the flavor. You might reconsider adding in corn--it came out as very chewy/slightly hard bits in the muffins, as if they dried out in the oven. The cornbread part is definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe. The only thing I did differently, out of personal preference, was to use about a 1/4 cup extra milk, and to soak the cornmeal in the milk beforehand to take the edge off the sometimes crumbly texture dry cornmeal seems to add. I'd originally only intended to soak it for an hour, but ended up leaving it overnight. Wonderfully tender. I also found that a dash of cinnamon adds a really nice spice to the sweetness.

These are sooooo good! They are very sweet but I am a sweets-a-holic so  LOVED them. In fact I couldnt stop eating them!!! I used fresh corn, which I husked, and cooked in the microwave for 7 minutes. I also had to add a little more milk than the recipe said because it looked way too thick. They were done in 20 minutes. LOVE IT_THANKS!!!!

I just baked 3 different corn muffin recipes from this website, and compared to the other 2 recipes and compared to my normal recipe, this recipe is a big disappointment. These muffins are way too sweet, and have an aftertaste like shortbread (because of the butter and sugar combination). They're not what cornbread should be (in my opinion), although they have a lot of flavor. They did have a good texture inside, and did rise nicely though.

Yum!  We all loved these, including my picky two- and five-year olds.  They are quite sweet, so if that's not what you're looking for, reduce the sugar.  I used a half-recipe and made 20 mini muffins with about 10 min. baking time.

Since I always use already-cooked canned corn in my cornbread recipes, I did the same with this, rather than frozen corn.  Also per reviewer, DCGirlyGirl, I added a bit more milk.  These were very good and went well with the Alaskan Salmon Chowder (from this website) that we had tonight.  Thank you, Lisa K!

These were really good. I am only giving this 4 stars because they have to be eaten right away. Within a few hours after baking they were really hard, but popped into the microwave for a couple of seconds and they were fine. Yummy!

Absolutely delicious!! I am not a huge fan of cornbread because its usually dry.  This was so moist! I realized while I was mixing, my muffin pan had been borrowed to a friend.  So I used a 8x8 pan.  Still turned out wonderful.

I have been searching for the right corn muffin recipe for months and this is it!  I wish I looked here first!  The honey and kernel corn really do make the difference in this one.  There is a nice texture and flavor to the finished product.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Lisa.

We make this often.  It's easy and good.  It always turns out great. I never take the time to defrost the corn and it still turns out great.  My husband loves these.  They are a tad on the sweet side, but very good.

I was on cornbread/cornmuffin probation after using the recipe on the cornmeal box one too many times and ending up with a dry, mealy side dish.

I was a Thanksgiving hero using this recipe.   I made 12 muffins, and the recipe made enough batter to nearly fill the cups.  The baked product was nicely browned, with a nice crown.

I agree with other reviewers that these are a tiny bit too sweet.  Most liked the sweetness but it was a bit much with a sweet-heavy Thanksgiving spread.  Would probably cut down on the sugar by 25%, but the honey added a distinct and delicious taste that I would definitely keep.

The corn adds a nice chew, definitely keep!  Might even consider a quick toast on them to add a bit more chew and flavor. 

Didn't put in anything spicy, but some canned jalapenos would be excellent.

Will definitely make it again, with a bit less sugar.

I actually bagged all the dry ingredients in a large 
Ziplock, and then did a quick mix-together at the in-laws house with the wet ingredients.  Didn't exactly follow the recipe procedure, and it still worked well.

Make this, you won't be sorry.

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly, making mini muffins. I baked them for about 7 to 8 minutes at 400 degrees, and my family loved them. I used a nonstick mini muffin pan, but I greased it a little with margarine anyway. It made 42 mini muffins. The mini muffins were only good for two days; on the third day, the corn kernels got really hard. However, the taste and texture was great - you can really taste the butter and honey, and the corn kernels are chewy, flavorful, and good. No need to butter these scrumptious muffins! I made them once for an event, where they all disappeared, so I made them the next day for my family; they were a hit everywhere! Thanks, Lisa!

These muffins are absolutely delicious.  I have a sweet tooth, but I thought they were too sweet - maybe cut down the sugar in half.

I added green onions and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  They were wonderful.  I will make these again.

Great muffins!! I'm lactose intolerant and used soy milk (it was vanilla flavored) instead and thought they were delicious!  I'm not sure what they are like with dairy milk, but I thought the soy milk was fine, and the vanilla added a subtle flavor to the muffins that was delectable!

Made this recipe several times with thick soups and it's heavenly!  They've really been a hit alongside chili for my husband and his friends.  I've used drained canned corn when out of frozen and it's turned out just as good.  Definitely not your everyday bland cornbread.  Thank you for the recipe!

Good, but a bit too sweet for my liking.  Next time I will try them with about half the sugar.  Great texture.

A little too sweet for my taste.  I use applesauce instead of honey, and left out the corn kernels.

These muffins are easy to make, so delicious and filling! I'm munching on one as I'm typing this review.I had all the ingredients on hand except the baking powder. I used 1/4 t. each of cornstarch and baking soda. The muffins rose so high and look & taste great. I saved to my favorites & will definitely make again.

Least sweet of many similar recipes, still, I reduced the sugar a bit to my taste. Great texture and nicely moist. I added an additional egg white because I had one and it made my muffins lighter.

Best tasting cornbread I've made!  Next time I will add a little more flour, it was crumbly. Could have been the humidity or my grind of cornmeal, I will definitely make this again!

We LOVE these muffins! When I bake, I’ll make three batches and freeze them, taking out what we need. They don’t last long. I have used a cup of currents, or yellow raisins to this recipe just to shake things up. Very good!

Really good recipe as is. I did use fresh cooked left over corn instead of frozen. If you wanted to use a little less sugar you would probably be safe. I feel like the key when I made this recipe was really really creaming the butter and sugar.

Moist, sweet, and delicious! My teen daughter said they tasted like Cracker Barrel's corn muffins. I took the advice of several reviewers and substituted a can of corn (drained) for the frozen corn, and used equal portions of heavy cream and half & half instead of milk. This is the first corn muffin recipe I've made that I absolutely love! Goes great with BBQ or fried chicken. Especially good for taking to potlucks.  It's also quick and simple to make. It's a keeper!!!

I followed recipe exactly and they were pretty good. They turned out a little more dry than I would normally care for, but my family loved them either way. I'll probably back off of the baking time just a bit next time to see if they are a little more moist, but overall, they were good and my nieces loved them.

I made these awesome muffins today. In Canada we call them Johnnycake muffins 
 I don't know why we call them that. My Gran used to make these as a treat. I thought I  would  add pickled Jalapenos and some diced cheddar to this wonderful recipe and they turned out better than I could have imagined.  Love this recipe

Excellent recipe. I lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup, split evenly between white and light brown sugar. I also don’t add the loose corn my son doesn’t like that addition. The honey flavor comes through and is delicious. I’ve always made this in an 8x8 pan rather than muffins but will make them as muffins this time.

These were excellent and so easy to make. Like another reviewer recommended I used heavy cream instead of milk and canned corn instead of frozen. Definitely a more moist muffin, but that's how I prefer them. Will be baking these again!

They turned out really good. I used fresh cooked corn kernels but otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out a bit dark so next time I will cook them a few minutes less time.

This turned out great! One boy liked it; one boy didn't. Par for the course ;-) Because I was making six jumbo muffins instead of 12 regular muffins, I couldn't bear the thought of using 2/3 cup sugar. So I only used 1/2 cup sugar, and they still turned out great. For the six jumbos, they were still done in approximately 25 minutes.

I made a muffin loaf  instead of muffins, if you do as i did cook the loaf for 30-35 min.  This recipe makes 1 small pan.

Love these but I did cut the sugar down to 1/4 c, used steamed corn and added 1/4c sour cream. I also lined the cupcake tin with bacon before pouring in the batter. These are super decadent and moist. Not for the healthy minded meal.

I made sure to beat the eggs and butter and sugar until fluffy. I used a (drained) can of corn. Muffins were delicious, fluffy and sweet. This is my go-to for corn muffins!

I made chili and these corn muffins and my husband LOVED it!!!! He kept thanking me for making the meal. But these corn muffins where awesome!!! I just didn't put the corn ( I just don't like them in my corn bread.) But I will make these again, they were perfect!

Always a perfect sweet cornbread muffins with or without (I usually make them without) the frozen kernel corn.  Better than any store bought mix!  My family and friends love it with my homemade chili.

I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it in a pan instead of muffin tins.  Double to the cooking time.

Although the corn bread was late getting out of the oven for our Southern dinner, the timing was perfect when served hot.

It was a huge hit even for those family members who disliked corn bread.

I have made these cornbread muffins multiple times and they always get rave reviews. I do tweak the recipe by using a can of creamed corn and cutting the sugar to a 1/2 cup. Deliciousness!

I made this recipe twice. Once using Bobs Red Mill Gluten Free baking flour and once with regular King Arthur flour.  The recipe came out great. Modifications were made out of convenience.

I substituted 1 cup of Buttermilk for regular milk - I had it and wanted to use it up. Buttermilk is thick,  so you'll need to add more. I used almost a full cup. I got rid of the honey, because I really didn't want them too sweet. I swapped quantities on flour and corn meal because prefer more corn meal.  I used frozen corn, thawed. It did not sink to the bottom as one review commented. Maybe their batter was too thin?  Anyway, lots of raves. Next time I will add some herbs. Maybe thyme or a bit of rosemary.....

I really enjoy making this recipe; I tweaked it a bit though. In the end I add 3/4 of a cup of plain sour cream to make it less dense and I use creamed corn instead. It's light and delicious!

These muffins are quite good.  Since there are only two of us it took a couple of days for us to eat all 12.  The corn bits in the muffin seemed to dry out and were "weird chewy bits" as another reviewer said.  The muffin base itself is very good though so I will try again with canned corn as other reviewers have suggested. :)

The texture was good but I just felt they were missing something.  They were bland and even slathering them with butter didn't really seem to help.  They were also a bit sweet for my taste.

I took a few suggestions from others reviewers and soaked the cornmeal in the mik and I used  one can of creamed corn. Really good, a bit sweet but that's what i was looking for. The only issue I had was the muffins would not come out of the paper. I am gping to try again, not the recipes fault.

This is a great recipe. My husband loves the cornbread muffins from Famous Dave's, with a little honey brushed on top after they come out of the oven makes them pretty comparable.

I made this recipe with 1/2 c sugar and a can of corn kernels instead of the frozen and baked in a Pampered Chef mini loaf pan for 30 minutes. It made 3 of the mini loaves and was sweet and delicious. My family (including three kids, two of whom are usually pick when they see veggies in anything baked) gobbled down two of them before I knew what happened.  Definitely a keeper!

Smelled delicious in the oven. Followed recipe except for corn-didn't have any. Muffins were moist and a bit sweet, the honey was a bit too much, probably will cut back a bit on honey and sugar next time. Overall, I would make that recipe again.

Pretty good!  I'm not a sweet flavor person so I didn't add the honey (topping with honey butter for the family) and added sour cream, slight amount more baking powder, hot sauce and soaked the corn meal like another did.    Texture is stellar and flavor is straight corn goodness.

These were incredibly easy to make! I too, like most others, used canned corn.

However, it was my first time buying, baking with and eating cornmeal and I didn't like the bits in the muffin. Any suggestions as to whether to omit the cornmeal?

Otherwise, this was an absolutely delicious recipe!

This recipe is great. I used half and half (all I had in my fridge) instead of milk and added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to add a little bit of heat. Very tastey.

Among the best corn muffins I've made. I did cherry pick changes from other reviewers: I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup & added 1/4 cup of sour cream. I used thawed frozen corn with no problem. But my muffins were done at 15m, & my oven is properly calibrated.

Made this gluten free!  I did not add the corn.  I used sweet rice flour, gluten free corn meal and 1/2 tsp of xantham gum (since it is gluten free) and a ratio of 2:1 cream of tartar to baking soda for gluten free baking powder.

I thought I was out of gluten free cornbread mix until I was halfway through mixing this recipe up.  Turns out this is way better then the mix!

The best basic one...I made changes so not really a fair rating....changed the butter to lard...I prefer lard when making savoury...I added whole chopped jalepeno and some jarred red pepper and real corn...not frozen.  AND cause it was savoury I used sour cream instead of honey....still need the white stuff though.  AND then I made 30 mini muffins....they were great.  But I have been cooking a LONG time so understand where changes can be made.  But dang they turned out good.  Oh and 10/12 minutes in 350'....check at ten.

Pretty good except they were way too sweet even for someone who likes sweet.  Instead of 2/3 sugar perhaps only use 1/3 cup, keeping the honey at a scant 1/4 cup.  I used cream instead of milk,  1 cup canned corn as others suggested and they were good, though what Southerners might call "Yankee style".  I  used  Nora Mill Granery yellow spectacled grits, rather large grained, and I think if you use fine grained corn meal these may be too dry. Not sure why this is not clearly explained in corn bread recipes.

First time trying cornbread from scratch. I did add a bit more corn than the prescribed amount, and had to substitute honey with a bit more water and sugar. The muffins looked perfect (my kids dug in so quickly, I didn't have the chance to even take a picture), and I loved the flavor and cake like texture. Will definitely do it again. Maybe using honey next time. :-)

I added 1/2 can of diced mild chiles and 1/2 c shredded parm and they were amazing. I made 16 muffins and baked them for 15 min.  They were a little sweet. I would cut the sugar back to 1/2 c.

excellent muffins!  Have made them twice already this month.  They heat up very well in the microwave. DH took them to his "man weekend" and had them with chili.  Everyone loved them. Thanks for a great recipe.

I am giving this 5 stars, but just a heads up I made these with 3/4 cup buttermilk instead of the 1/2 cup milk - I just have a thing for using buttermilk with corn muffins.  I also used canned corn as opposed to frozen at the recommendation of others and it came out great.  These are definitely sweeter corn muffins than I am used to, but I loved them anyway.

I scooped the normal amount of batter I use for cupcakes/muffins but was left with very short muffins as they didn't rise much if at all (but it DID give me more than 12).   They were super moist though, and when I simply added more batter per cup they were perfect.  Next time I'll try adding a bit more baking soda to account for the buttermilk and also dividing the batter evenly between 12 (and only 12) muffin cups.

Overall a sweet, VERY moist, delicious corn muffin!

Made these with Bob's Gluten Free All Purpose Flour, they were delicious. Although, I would agree that they are a bit sweet and would probably cut the sugar back to 1/2 C. Were very moist and had great texture! Will definitely make these again. (making 150 for my cousin's wedding, why I used gluten free:) )

Very moist and fluffy, certainly not rustic, so I'd go with this recipe if you're looking for a sweeter cornbread. I used canned corn instead of frozen. My one criticism is that some of the bigger bits of cornmeal didn't soften that much, they were pretty crunchy. But that could have been the brand/type of cornmeal I used.

Great taste!! They are a tad dense, but that's okay for chili. I used Canola oil instead of butter, omitted the honey, added a Tsp vanilla, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (but 2/3 is fine I'm sure.) Plus I only had to cook them half the time in a conventional oven. They POPPED right up like popovers do! Cute :) I remembered to thaw the frozen corn first, so I didn't have a problem with the kernel texture. The point is that a home-cook could tweak the recipe and it still turns out delicious! Yumitty Yum.

I made these mostly as directed but substituted a cup of frozen blueberries instead of corn.  They came out good and I didn't think too sweet, but possibly because I used some almond flour instead of white flour and almond milk instead of regular milk.... Would definitely make again!

I really liked these muffins.  They were moist and had a great flavor.  I wasn't sure initially how full to fill the cupcake liners, but I ended up filling them nearly to the top and they rose nicely without spilling over everywhere.  I will definitely make these again.

I loved this recipe.  I won't talk about my changes, they were few and driven my need.  The flavor was very sweet, but that's what I expected.  I did make in a round cake pan instead of muffins.  I will certainly make this again.

On the plus side, these came out moist with good flavor.  On the downside, I took them out at 20 mins, and they were overbaked.  Several had burnt bottoms.  I suggest checking them at 18 mins.  After reading some reviews, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used canned corn instead of frozen.  I also beat the sugar, butter, and honey first and then added the eggs one at a time.  I don't know if that made a difference, but they were pretty dense.  I served them with chili (pumpkin turkey chili, from this site, albeit modified), and people liked them but didn't love them.

Following prior suggestions, I reduced the sugar a little, used 1/2 cup skim milk and a large spoonful of reduced fat sour cream.  I also used canned corn, drained.  These came out very good.

Loved this recipe. I do not like the typical dry and crumbly cornbread.  I have been looking for a more smooth textured recipe.  With a couple of minor modifications, these were close to a real muffin consistency and were not at all crumbly. I chose not to add corn so I substituted 1-2 additional tablespoons of butter and increased the milk to 3/4 cup so they would not get dry.   I would recommend at the 15 minute mark to start watching them closely so they do not burn.

very yummy and easy! Didn't have honey so I substituted maple flavored pancake syrup and they really were delicious! Served them with fried chicken and they were a hit! Next time I will decrease the flour and increase the cornmeal because I am used to serving Jiffy mix cornbread, which is more corn meal based, I think.  Totally recommend!  Thanks for posting!

I made these muffins for my women's Bible study group and they loved them!  We are having chili today and I am going to make them again!  Big hit!

I've made this recipe numerous times and have always loved these corn muffins--and received rave reviews from those with whom I've shared. I will say that I like my cornbread sweet & moist, which I know is not everyone's preference. This recipe also works well in an 8x8 baking dish; just leave in the oven a bit longer.

I made this recipe last night and made a few changes.  I used Splenda instead of the sugar and for half of the mixture I added asiago cheese and a fresh diced jalapeno.  I brought them to work to share with my friends and they said it was the best cornbread they ever had and demanded the recipe.  
Next time I will make half of the recipe without the corn because my 8 year old wasn't fond of the corn. 
Serious comfort food here.

I made these, but did not have any honey and they turned out well! My family thought it was different, but enjoyed them. I got a request to make them again.

These are very delicious home made moist cornbread muffins! Do not overbake. The only adjustment I made was cutting down the sugar to half a cup. My whole family loved it!

Made exactly as directed using canned corn instead of frozen and COARSE ground cornmeal. Gave them that hearty old fashioned taste. Sweet and moist...just delicious!

These were good cornbread muffins...I used canned corn, which definitely gave the muffins a different though good consistency.  They are sweet but I like them that way.  Next time, I'll probably try a different recipe.

I liked these alot, hubby gave them an 8.5 out of 10 stars, which isnt bad considering he is not a huge cornbread fan!  I had a medium grind cornmeal in the house, so muffins were a but gritty, next time I will make sure I have a fine grind in the pantry to make these.  Will make again!

Consistency and sweetness were perfect (I used 1/2 cup sugar) but they didn't have a good strong corn flavor.  In fact, it hardly tasted like cornbread at all.  Suggestions?

First time making cornbread muffins and My family and I gobbled them up in no time. Yummy and I loved the corn bits in them. I did sub milk with buttermilk because I had it on hand and needed to use it before expiring. The recipe is simple and I'm looking forward to making more. Thanks for sharing!

Best cornbread recipe! I needed a recipe that didn't have buttermilk.  The only changes I added to this was that I used 1/3 C Honey instead of 1/4 and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 20-25 minutes. Most, sweet and delish.

Wonderful recipe. If you don't like your cornbread sweet do what the other people have sugested and use less sugar. I personaly like it this sweet. The only thing I did different was used white corn that I cut straight from the cob (after I boiled it of course), and I only baked for 18 minutes.

These were pretty good.  I read some reviews and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  And I didn't read the directions carefully and didn't thaw out the corn, still came out good.  Will be making this again.

My husband just made a batch of these and they came out moist, and excellent tasting! Maybe the moisture content that people are finding in their muffins has something to do not just with how long they are baked, but with the amount of moisture in the corn. My husband used canned corn in the recipe because frozen corn isn't available here. Also, sweetness of canned or frozen corn can vary too. Anyway, this recipe is a keeper!

Being a 23 year old male, baking isn't exactly my forte.  However, I needed something to go with my chili, and these turned out AMAZING.  They are sweet so if you do not like this you may want to remove some of the sugar, but I love them this way.

These are quite sweet but the texture and flavor are fantastic. I made a double batch. My family doesn't  eat eggs right now so I used energy egg replacer. I also used almond milk and corn I'd cut from the Cobb. They were so good I brought some to neighbors.

Delicious. Needed a sugar-free version though so opted to replace the sugar with an extra 60ml of honey in the recipe. Also added an extra egg white and 50ml of milk to loosen and lighten the mixture, and left out the corn kernals. My husband thought they tasted like real southern cornbread!

It had a nice texture and flavor, however it was way too sweet.  The sugar, with the honey and corn was overpowering in sweetness.  I did use half clover honey and half raw local honey , so I don't know if that was the reason or not. It was so sweet that no one in my family could eat it.

Excellent cornbread muffin!  Served them with chili and the eaters raved about them.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1.  Used a thicker clover honey instead of "normal" honey but it worked out just fine.  2. Substituted a 14.5 oz can of sweet corn (drained) instead of the frozen corn.  3. Used paper liners --> easy clean-up!  4. Made about 16 muffins for 1 batch.  5. Oh, and I used 1% milk.

Made with extra honey and only 1/3 cup sugar and 3/4 cup milk.  Left out Corn kernals and it was fine.  Loved these!

These tasted very good, but my guests and I could eat no more than 1 of them - they were SO sweet! I may try to cut down a bit on the honey next time.  It gave a good flavor but the sweetness was just too overwhelming.

So far the best cornbread I have made.  This recipe is on the sweet side - so if you don't like your cornbread sweet and moist don't bother.  I made it with 1/2 c. sugar and 1/3 c. honey and only a half a can of corn.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar to 1/3 c. and add the whole can of corn and it will be perfect.

Sinfully delicious!!  Great honey taste.  I used canned corn and it was wonderful.  One of the perks of this recipe over other cornbread recipes is that they did not stick to my muffin pan.  This one is a keeper for my family!  It is sweet though, DH calls it corn cake.

These were very sweet and dense, but good. I used defrosted, frozen corn and skim milk and didn't have any problems. Even though I made these to pair with chili, I think that a savory cornbread tends to go better with chili.

I've made this recipe several times and it is a big hit. The muffins never last long. The only thing I changed was instead of frozen corn I use a regular size can of corn. Turn out wonderful each time.

These are so good!  Very moist!  If you don't like sweet cornbread then you probably won't like these because they are very sweet.  I didn't have any corn and it was still very good without it.

Everyone loved this cornbread!  I'm not sure what consistency I should have expected, but it turned out much more moist and dense than I thought it would, possibly because of the substitutions I made.  I used canned creamed corn instead of the frozen kernels and in a bar pan instead of muffin tins.    Overall, a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  Great texture and I liked that it had just a hint of sweetness.  Very rich and filling.  I, too, used a drained can of sweet kernel corn instead of thawing the frozen kind. It was a HUGE hit with my hubby (picky eater).  If he likes it, EVERYONE will like it!

Love this recipe.  Easy to make!  I brought it to our thanksgiving lunch last year for work, and my colleagues loved it.  I am bringing them again this year!  I use a can of fresh corn instead of the frozen corn, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

Delicious. I doubled the recipe and used 1 can of corn (drained). I used mini muffin tins (no liners) and reduced bake time to 17 minutes.  They turned out perfectly. I made them a  week prior to a party and froze them- they were still delicious after being frozen.

We loved these!  They are pretty sweet but because of that, they paired nicely with our spicy chili tonight. We just had to go wheat free in our household, beginning this week, so I experimented with the Pamela's Wheat and Gluten Free Pancake and Baking Mix.  Substituted for the flour.  NO ONE would ever know they were wheat free!

these were very tasty perfect with chili. I used a 1/4 cup on cornsyrup instead of honey because i did not have honey, and 1/3 cup of splenda sugar. I also used canned corn not frozen still came out great!

I like the taste the honey added to the muffins.  I didn't really like the consistency. They were very spongey. If I made again, I'd probably adjust to make sweeter.

Delicious!  Very sweet, but with the hot spicy turkey chili I made (Doc's Chili from Biggest Loser program), they were fabulous!  I used 1 cup of canned corn, well drained, and that was good, but would have been great with the whole can (I needed a little corn for another recipe).  These aren't for someone on a low calorie diet, but if you make mini muffins and restrict yourself to one, you can have decadent comfort food.  Thanks Lisa K for posting this recipe!

I've been looking for a great cornbread muffin recipe and I think I have finally found it. Believe it or not I forgot to put the baking powder in! BUT they still baked nicely. They were pretty dense and not fluffy but they have a REALLY great flavor. I love my cornbread sweet and moist and this is both! I did use canned corn and I used whole milk! YUM

A little too sweet but overall very good.  Will make again but with less white sugar.

YUM! YUM! These were delicious and moist. I made mine with corn syrup( in place of the honey) and no sugar because I prefer savoury corn muffins. However, next time I will add more corn syrup. This was pretty good, thanks :)

These are excellent! I use canned corn & chop them up a little before adding them into the batter. I also soak my cornmeal in about 1/4c of milk for at least 1 hour. It seems to keep them moist...or it could be my imagination. LOL! I use Kauai Honey which makes a HUGE difference in flavor. I tried using the regular Honey in the bear bottle & the taste was just not the same! So if you can, use a better quality honey. Great with Chili...You never need to slather butter on these muffins!

Have now made these DOZENS of times!  Just now reviewing as I cut into cubes for oven toasting, and can't quit eating them!  DOUBLED the recipe, and WHOLE grains am I, so ground whole oats to make half the flour amount, and used white flour for the rest.  Added 1 T. ground flax seed, and CUT THE SUGAR down to 1/3 c. for a DOUBLE RECIPE!   NO KIDDING, and they are STILL killer sweet from the amount of honey in recipe!  AS well, I did cut butter to 1/4 c for a DOUBLE RECIPE, and made sure I didn't fully drain the corn so recipe would suffer from the smaller amount butter!  GREAT ALL AROUND RECIPE!  MAKES WONDERFUL CROUTONS, which last longer than a loaf around here!

I really liked these. I didn't have any honey so I didn't put any in.  They weren't too sweet at all.  They were quite tasty.  My three year old had three of them, I think he thought they were cupcakes because of the shape.  I was thinking maybe next time I'd use low fat margarine for less calories so i can eat more..

These were too sweet for me to think of them as cornbread, although they were tasty and very moist.  Next time I'll reduce, or maybe leave out altogether, the white sugar.

Awesome, easy to make recipe. I substituted can of corn for frozen corn. One recipe fills a 24-mini muffin tin. Bake for only 18 minutes for the smaller tin.

These were pretty tasty and plenty moist. I don't like my corn bread 'too' sweet so I halved the sugar and added 2 tbs honey and the sweetness was perfect. I sprinkled grated sharp cheddar on the tops. I will be making these again.

These are really tasty. They are pretty sweet, next time I will cut down on the sugar. They also didn't rise very much, they are very flat but it didn't affect the taste, maybe I need new BP. I also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  Overall pretty good.

I thought they turned out good, but I would have liked them to taste more like corn.  I think I would add more cornmeal and less flour next time.

I'm giving it three stars ONLY because it wasn't "gritty" like I'm used to.  HOwever, the flavor was good.  I thought it was a cross between bread and cornbread. thanks.

Loved this!  Made exactly as the recipe stated.  Used whole wheat flour though.  Very sweet though.  No need to add honey while eating!  Next time I will probably cut down on the sugar.

Very good muffins. Love the actual corn inside it. Only comment is that it is a good idea to add a little extra moisture--I usually just add a bit more milk (around 1/4 cup). Otherwise, it is my favorite cornbread recipe!

We used canned corn instead of frozen and added in some garlic. They were pretty good- moist and sweet. Usually, I drizzle honey over cornbread muffins before eating them, but these ones certainly didn't need any.

Made this recipe on Friday for family and it was a hit.  Cut down the sugar as some other reviews suggested, and they were plenty sweet.  I used a can of creamed corn instead of whole kernels.  Muffins were so moist and delicious.

i give it a 4 because some kids liked it some didn't although I am not sure I can fairly rate it.  I did use 1/2 flour and 1/2 wheat.  I don't know that I'll do it again, I also accidentally lowered the sugar but doubled the honey.  It was way too sweet. But then again, the ones who liked it ate 3-4 pieces so something was right.

Very moist and soft.  Not dry and crumbly like cornbread can get.  I made a vegan version because of a dairy allergy in the family- margerine and soy milk in place of butter and milk.  I also used canned corn instead of frozen- about a half of can.  Not many recipes are easy to convert from dairy so that's why I picked this one.  It was delicious and easy, easy!!  I'll definitely make it again.

I'm not a big cornbread fan but made this for my mom who is - and it was a great recipe!  I used fresh corn shaved from the cob and baked in a 9 X 13 pan rather than making individual muffins.  The baking time was approximately the same.  Fresh out of the oven the cornbread was delicious, the perfect amount of sweetness.  However, I only gave the recipe 4 stars as the next day the cornbread was crumbly and dry.

These were easy and yummy, however not what I consider actual cornbread. They were very sweet (if I make them again I'll cut the sugar in half) and leaned too much on the flour side so that it was more cakey than corny.

Wow! These are fantastic!  Giving 4 stars because of the mods I made: 1/2 cup sugar, 1% milk, margarine instead of butter, and 1 can of corn instead of frozen. These came out beautifully after 20 mins in the oven.  I've never made any type of cornbread muffin before (have had them a lot and love them though!) but I will a lot more now that I found this recipe!

Would give 5 stars but wish it were a little more fluffy than dense.

This receipe was delicious,I used loaf pans,extra milk to be moist because cornmeal soaks up liquid and less sugar and it turned out perfect,it was extra special with the corn kernels.

these are amazingly delicious. i was looking for a corn muffin recipe with real corn that wasn't dry as dust and these were perfect.  for a moist, sweet, corn-included muffin, these are worth washing the tin for!

Very good recipe. I omiited the corn (because I didn't have any) and used 1/2 c. of honey and omiited the white sugar. I added 1/2 c. of milled flaxseed for the health benefits. GREAT!

These are incredibly tasty muffins!  I was concerned about the outcome when I put them in the tins, the batter was like cookie dough!  Might have been something to do with substituting cream for the milk.  The only complaint I have about them (and again, this might be a result of the cream substitution) is that the baked muffins are lumpy, bumpy and not all that pretty.  They are meant to be for a work potluck, but after tasting the first one, they may not make it that long.

they were fantastic.  The taste was exactly what i was looking for to serve with soup.  i did cut back on the sugar. Frozen sweet corn gave it the extra sugar.

This was a pretty good recipe but not exactly the homemade cornbread taste that I was looking for. I used 1/2 cup less flour and added 1/2 cup of cornmeal instead. I also cut the sugar in half but added 1/8 cup more honey and a little more milk and 2 Tablespoons more butter. The muffins came out a little more crumbly than the original recipe but I thought the second time was more what I was looking for and well worth the little extra crumbliness.

This was a great cornbread recipe!  The only thing I didn't really care for were the whole pieces of corn.  It gave it a strange texture in my opinion.

this was pretty good, but i need to change it because it isnt the consistency i want it to be. im thinking less honey this time (half a cup is a lo9t of honey!) and then more cornmeal, less flour? but very good and very sweet!

edit:
the second time i made this, i knew i wanted a thicker cornbread, like the one at sonny's bbq. so i increased the cornmeal and the milk and decreased the honey and the flour to my own tastes, and it was a billion times more my taste and perfect. i plan on making these in the future until im old and a granny :)

I was really excited to try these muffins because I've been wanting to make muffins with the actual corn kernels for a long time. I was disappointed. I just didn't really like the texture, kernels were sort of chewy (I used frozen corn). The taste was fine.

i used mini muffin tins and they were eaten up really quick

Very nice muffin.. maybe just a tad on the sweet side.  Would probably use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup.  Corn and honey are a great touch. I needed a change from the routine of the cornmeal box recipe and this was just right.  Honey butter would be quite complementary!

My oh my!!!!  These are delicious - sweet and just dense enough.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Used a bit more corn and when slathered with Honey Butter (also from this site), they were like little bites of heaven.  I served this with Portabella Mushroom Chili and seriously, they nearly outshined the main course!!  Thanks much!

Keep an eye on these because mine cooked faster than was said and burnt on the bottom! Given that they burnt on the bottom and this was my first attempt at made from scratch corn bread...I will need to adjust the cook time and try again before I can rate it justly.

I though they were really good! I actually added a little extra honey to the batter and when they were done, I topped them with butter and a little more honey to adda  bit more sweetness. I didn't add corn though because i hate corn in my bread. REALLY GOOD!

OK, I admit I have no idea what down home restaurant the recipe refers to, lol, but these were great.  My 16 month old LOVED them, and I suspect that it's because they were sweet.  I made the recipe exactly as written (I like to try it out as it's submitted first, so I can rate it accurately) and next time, I'll do as some others suggested and cut the sugar just a little--just to a half-cup.  If my daughter still loves 'em, these will be five stars for me FOR SURE!  Thanks for a very nice basic corn muffin recipe!

These were yummy.  I did make a few changes.  I only added 1/2 c. sugar and 1 tbsp. of honey.  They were still plenty sweet enough.  I also added cheese.  My whole family practically inhaled them!

It was a little to sweet for my taste, so next time I'll cut down on the sugar.  I made a roast tonight and was craving some corn bread, the corn bread would probably go better with chili beans. I give it 4 stars.

I made these muffins yesterday. I thought they were too sweet, next time I will reduce the amount of sugar. I did think they were very good though. One thing I thought was odd though was that the next day when I had one of the muffins the corn pieces were sticky and sort of dried up. Still good but it made the texture chewy.

Excellent recipe! My whole family loved them. (Even the picky children.) I liked the fact that these aren't too sweet. They're perfect by themselves, and they weren't dry like most I've had. Would definitely make these again!

This is the recipe I have been looking for. The one that are "very similar to the ones found in a famous down-home cooking restaurant". The reviews were correct and the recipe did not disappoint. Very moist, just sweet enough and the honey does make the difference. I made them in a baking pan I just purchase that makes 8 mini loaves. Twenty minutes seemed to do the trick for that pan. I wish I would have found this recipe two weeks ago as I wanted to start a new tradition and have cornbread at Thanksgiving. The new tradition will start this next Thanksgiving for sure! Thanks for submitting it Lisa K!

Great recipe! I have never made as muffins, but have made twice, once as one big loaf, and another time I split the batter for two average size loaves. Both times it was great, but needed more cooking time than muffins of course. I used this cornbread in a cornbread stuffing recipe this Thanksgiving and it turned out great.

Thank you Lisa K for the best cornbread muffin recipes ever! They were so most and yummy. My only modification was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk. They had a great texture and flavor, will make these often for my husband that is a "cornbread Connoisseur"!

Wow, excellent!!!  I made this one as cornbread in a 8x8 pan instead of as muffins.  This is excellent: very moist and thick, and the corn kernels added a great taste and texture.  This is better than a lot of restaurant cornbreads.

Lisa,
I was very impressed after reading the reviews.
I doubled the portions and made a batch in muffin pan and another in 8x8 pan for school's thanksgiving party.
It turned out OK but still pretty dry..not as moist as I expect.
Can you tell me where I could have gone wrong as I want try it again....
Can Corn grits be substituted for corn meal ???
Thanks... 
Susan

These were moist and delicious prepared just as the recipe was written!  My family was oh so pleased with the moist, slightly sweet muffins.  The only problem--I couldn't keep them away from seconds and then thirds!  I was hoping for some leftovers for tomorrow!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by my family!

These muffins were pretty good.  I mixed them for too long, so they were kind of dense and did not have crumbly tops.

These are excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly and, unlike other reviewers, didn't find them too sweet at all but absolutely perfect.  I used frozen white and yellow baby corn.

These were good, but I made the mistake of not reading the recipe and made 24 muffins and not 12. I did a couple things differently: I melted the butter, I used 1 T of Baking powder because someone else here said they didn't rise, and I mashed the corn a little first. I think I may try these again, since my family seemed to like them, but I will use less corn. I agree with someone else who said that the corn was a little strange and that it stuck to my teeth a bit.

Did not rise very much, which surprised me greatly, but still turned out pretty well.  Had a very nice, sweet flavor.  I will likely make these again.

I love these and have made them several times. They *are* very sweet, but that and the real corn is what makes them so great. I love them with butter and salt, and my husband keeps bugging me to make them again and again :)

My husband who thinks corn muffins are too dry, enjoyed these.  Not quite like the corn muffins I grew up with.  But these are excellent.  We will definately be having these again.

Well, I can certainly understand how someone who isn't totally into sweet breads would think that these cornbread muffins are over the top: they are *super* sweet. But if you love sweet, you will love these. I made them with 1 c. cornmeal and 1 c. flour. I used all the sugar called for, and I even sprinkled some on top.

I used a can of corn.  These turned out good, especially nuked in the microwave for a few seconds and swathed in butter!  My 6 year old loved the real "corn" in them!  The recipe made more than 12 muffins.

These tasted great and were very easy to make.  The kernels of corn were a nice change from the usual cornbread recipes.
