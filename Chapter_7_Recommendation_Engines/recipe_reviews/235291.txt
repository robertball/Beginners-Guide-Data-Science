So good, incredibly moist! I used pecans instead of raisins and topped these cupcakes with a maple bacon buttercream. New favorite cupcake!

These tasted great! However, they weren't exactly French toast flavored, more of a cinnamon raisin. But even then they tasted really great! I used plain Greek yogurt, and it tasted fine! Powdered sugar on top really tasted great!

I tried these cupcakes twice.  The flavor is good.  My problem was that they stuck to the paper cups to the point that I only had crumbs.

UPDATE:  After sitting in a plastic container for a couple of days, I was able to get the cupcakes out of the paper cups.  

Version 1 is being dusted with powdered sugar and then a dollop of raspberry cream cheese frosting will go on top.

Version 2 is being frosted in a peanut butter maple buttercream.

I made these and they did turn out good.  I used a maple flavored yogurt and added a little less maple syrup.  I also made maple flavored buttercream frosting for the top with the left-over yogurt.  I was concerned about not using an egg... and they came out tasting a lot like french toast - minus the normal consistency of a cupcake due to the lack of egg.  Super soft and moist, just bit crumbly.  Very good recipe though and easy to modify!

Left out the raisins and they were so good! Will definitely make again!
