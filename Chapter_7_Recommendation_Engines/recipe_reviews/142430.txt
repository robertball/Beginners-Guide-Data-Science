OMG, I made this a few months ago and it was a big hit.  This is very tasty and anybody who likes crab and smoked salmon separately will love them together in this recipe.  Ever since I have added a few of my own ingredients to the recipe to enhance it further; thinly sliced green onions and dill.  So far it has been a hit every time I make it.

Very easy to make.  Just dump it all in the food processor and whir it up.  I used 2 3-ounce packets of red salmon and 1 12 ounce package of imitation crab to make it a bit more affordable.  I'm sure the version with the smoke salmon and real crab is delicious, but this less expensive version was really good too!

This dip is fantastic!  I prefer green onions, so I substitute those instead of the cooked onion.  Other than that, it's wonderful as-is.  I served it in a big sourdough breadbowl- big hit.  Let the dip chill overnight for best flavor.
