What a wonderful twist on pumpkin pie.  I would rate it 10 if possible - the mincemeat definitely takes this to a different level.  This pie can not be rated on it's own without the addition of the mincemeat because that is what makes it special.

I omitted the mincemeat on this one, because I just wanted a good pumpkin chiffon pie recipe.  It was delicious!  I have NEVER cooked Christmas dinner before.  Amid the chaos, however, this recipie was a breeze.

Ok...so I'd never had mincemeat-anything (apparently it's a Northern/British thing) or a chiffon pie before but this seemed like an interesting/fancy dish to bring to a dinner.  I was nervous as everyone took their slices but it tasted great!!  It was a big hit!
