I prefer the taste of beef but for health reasons, I use lean ground turkey for all dishes that require ground beef. It's delicious, regardless. I used Classico brand four cheese pasta sauce, which I love when I can't make my own. However, I could not find cottage cheese with chives ANYWHERE! I looked, looked, looked... So, I had some ricotta in the refrigerator and just went ahead and used that. I also sprinkled some parmesan on top. I had some spinach occupying space in my refrigerator so I threw that in there too. Yes, I changed it up a bit but like the author said, this recipe "can be a start for so many variations". That's definitely true. Make it your own. It is a great base recipe and I loved the change of pace when it comes to texture on an italian dish. I pour some sauce in the middle of a serving plate and placed the polenta on top, made it look pretty and served it with a side dish of steamed broccoli. Yum Yum!

YUM! I sauteed the ground beef with fresh garlic, skipped the tomato sauce, and added fresh herbs and mushrooms to the pasta sauce. I couldn't find cottage cheese with chives so I added some fresh chives, basil, and parsley to the cottage cheese (yummy). I used the Polenta recipe from this site to make my own at home. So good. Thanks!

I layered everything in a small baking dish, with lotsa sauce, and no beef.  The result looked more like a soup, but it tasted like lasagna, and it was great. Easy, perfect for lazy days. Sprinkled feta, cheddar, parmesan  and breadcrumbs on top. Cooked almost 1 hour at 350F.

I made my own polenta (4 cups chicken broth to 1 cup polenta); spread it out on a buttered cookie sheet, covered it with plastic wrap and refrigerated until firm. I then cut the polenta into circles with a round cookie cutter. For the sauce, I substituted JohnsonvilleÂ® mild Italian sausage for the ground beef, giving it a couple of quick pulses in my food processor after browning to give it a finer, more beef-like texture. Delicious! My whole family liked it. Thanks for the recipe Angie!

This is a great recipe to add variations, but I believe the most important step is to bake the polenta for at least 30 minutes first to firm it up before adding toppings. 
Then add any toppings and bake off till warmed and bubbly.

I put my homemade sauce in the bottom (enough to cover the bottom of the dish), layer in the polenta, then a spoonful of ricotta on each piece then beef - skip the cottage cheese, cover with additional spoonfuls of sauce on the polenta slices and some mozz & parm cheese (whatever I have on hand) and bake until hot, bubbly and cheese is a little brown.  I don't make it too saucy and can adjust it to just two of us or all 6.

It was good. I actually layered it like a Lasagna and the polenta was a little soft. I would follow the recipe a little better next time. It was still amazing though.

I used a can of diced tomatoes but should have drained a little of the juice.  I also used ricotta cheese.  I added mushrooms and spinach.  The thing that made it was the use of fresh spices.  Hubby really liked it and I will use this recipe again.

This didn't go together at all for me, I ended up pulling off the huge layer of mozarella cheese and then eating it.  Will not make it again.

I couldn't find the cottage cheese with chives. I sprinkled some Parmesan  cheese feta cheese and blue cheese instead. Added some onions and sliced mushrooms to the meat while cooking. Sprinkled some Mediterranean spices and basil in there also.

I made this using my own home made sauce with ground turkey and mushrooms. I like using polenta instead of noodles, because it's fat free and gluten free.  The browned mozzarella on top was the best! 
I couldn't find cottage cheese with chives, so I just put chives in a container of regular cottage cheese. This is delicious, I will definitely make it again!

I gave the idea 4 stars because it is quick and easy.  However, I changed the recipe up quite a bit.  I used only veggies (spinach, mushrooms, zucchini and fresh tomatoes, and about 1/2 cup organic tomato sauce.  Lots of  fresh parsley, chopped garlic and basil added to the tomato sauce.  Excellent idea for dinner, thank you!

Looks lovely UNTIL I cut into it. I presume the cottage cheese should really be "ricotta cheese" because the recipe as-is turns out runny/watery. Too much liquid. The polenta roll slices never combine/unite. I'll make it again with several additional adjustments (ground beef NEEDS seasoning: 2 cloves garlic,  1/2 large red onion,  S&P to taste - this was a good change; in future will switch out cottage for ricotta cheese & will use a fork to spread polenta on bottom of pan). Largeky disappointed.  :-(  First All Recipe that does not turn out as anticipated.

Sooo easy. I sauteed onions and garlic, added the meat. Put in the pasta sauce, some Italian spices. I didn't have the right cheeses so I put cream cheese on the polenta and then shredded monterey jack on top of the meat. Still delicious!

We loved this. I did make changes only because I didn't have cottage cheese or ricotta (subbed in sour cream and dried chives) and I added mushrooms to the sauce. But this is a great recipe and a hassle free lasagne. Personally lasagne noodles and I don't get along :) Thanks for this excellent recipe and idea. Using polenta as a base for things is kind of a hobby. Served with fresh homade italian bread and a brussel sprout slaw that slayed.

Very good and easier than regular lasagna. The polenta is a very nice change. I plan to make my own polenta next time, and then ricotta with the mozzarella on top of it.

I loved this recipe! I left out the meat and added Italian seasoning to my plain cottage cheese. I also left out the tomato sauce as the jar of sauce was more than adequate. Very tasty and saucy.....great for using garlic bread to "mop up" extra sauce! Amazingly easy and great for vegetarians!

I thought this was just OK.  I  only used 8 oz of mozzarella on top, and that was plenty.  I also used ricotta with fresh chives and basil,instead of cottage cheese.  It surely didn't  look like any of the pictures.  The taste was good, mostly tomatoes and cheese.  the polenta flavor didn't really come through.  I'm not sorry that I tried it, but I probably will  not make it again.

I made this using four cheese pasta sauce, adding some onions, mushrooms and herbs.  I believe this will even work for those who must eat gluten-free.  It was a big hit and I'll definitely be making it again.

The only reason I gave this three stars is my husband liked it.  It does have good flavor, but it is a mess. I followed the directions exactly. My jar of spaghetti  sauce was 26 oz instead of 24, but I doubt that  made this much a difference. This should be served in a bowl!  I think the cottage cheese is the offender. Most of them are so wet, I wondered about it. I think ricotta would be a better choice.  The sauce turned a light orange due to the cottage cheese. I have never heard of cottage cheese with chives but I grow them in my herb garden so sliced up a couple tablespoons and added. In the future I would not put in the tomato sauce. No idea why you'd need it. The polenta wound up swimming around in this mess. It looks nothing like the photo. I'd like to know exactly how that was made.  I doubt like the recipe says! I should have submitted a photo. Glad I didn't have company that night.

Made my own polenta base - 1 cup to 4 cups of water (as another review had suggested). Thought the base may not set so stuck it in the freezer for about 30 mins! Then spread ricotta cheese over it followed by grated parmesan. Poured over the ground beef sauce - like a thick bolognase sauce & topped with grated edam cheese. Baked until browned on top. It was absolutely delicious! Next time I make the polenta base I will only use 3 cups of water.

I made it with 3 thinner layers of polenta with the sauce in between, much better.
