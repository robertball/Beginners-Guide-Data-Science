I made this as directed with drumsticks (used soba noodles instead of the thin somen, sorry Tina!) except once the chicken was done I added a couple of red peppers (large dice) just so it could be an all in one dish and have some veggies in there.  I also added a good glug of sambal olek to finish it, just 'cos I like it spicy :)  Upon tasting it seemed to be missing something...so I tipped in a bit of oyster sauce and BINGO!  Took it over the top and gave it some nice added depth.  I'll be taking this for my lunches at work this week and am planning on sprinkling some chopped green onions on top of each serving (i.e., not cooking them in).  Thanks!

I love this soup! (and yes, the noodles are called somen). My mom always made this for me, especially on a cold, rainy day. The rice wine really warms me up! LOVE!

My mom makes muah yu gei (ma yo ji) at home for us too, and this tasted great! I didn't have dark sesame oil, so the sesame oil taste wasn't as strong, so next time I will try it with dark (I used light sesame oil). Still, the broth was so fragrant and the measurements are all pretty spot on, to create the thick broth that sticks to the noodles. My mom's is a bit more brothy, but I like this version better since it coats the noodles more. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs, and it still tasted great. I had oyster mushrooms and bamboo hearts on hand too, so I added those and they tasted great with the flavors.

I found this recipe hard to follow. Maybe it loses something in the translation. I don’t understand why I’d boil bone in chicken pieces and then just drain away the chicken stock. Also, 12 minutes wasn’t enough cooking time for the size of my pieces. There was no instructions to debone the pieces, but I felt like I had to let them cool and pull off the meat. Just a cup and a half of water doesn’t make much broth. I couldn’t find the proper noodles so used rice noodles since that was what I could find at my grocers. The soup was not bad, but was a lot of work. I’m not sure I made it properly, but I put in the effort. Probably won’t make it again.
