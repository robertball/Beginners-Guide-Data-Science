Admittedly, this is my first pumpkin soup, so I didn't know what to expect. I subbed home-made vegetable stock for the water and bullion cube because we have poultry allergies in my family. The result was a bitter, bland mess, even with the cream. 2 teaspoons of salt and 3 tablespoons of honey later, and it was tasty soup.
