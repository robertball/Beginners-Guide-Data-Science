I'm not so much criticing the filling...  it's the crust!  I have always hated tarts because of the crust.  They always remind me of sawdust held together with elmers glue.  Not this one.  It has flavor, texture...  style!  I use it for all of my tarts.  Thank you for showing me they don't all have to be awful...  that they can actually be really, really good.

I needed a recipe to use up chocolate hazelnut spread, this was it. Kids gobbled it up. I was afraid of using a glass pie dish from freezer to oven, so I used the foil pie plates instead. I also didn't have any whole wheat flour on hand, I just used all purpose. Thanks for sharing Gypsy

Although I baked it for 20 minutes at 350, it was dry.

This was fairly easy to prepare, but my family thought it was too rich.  Maybe if it was served with whipped cream, and a bit less honey?
