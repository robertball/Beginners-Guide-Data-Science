I have to admit, this was pretty darn good and i'll definitely make it again.  Make sure to grease/spray/flour the pan ahead of time - it will stick like crazy no matter what the recipe says.

ANY GOOD BAKER KNOWS YOU NEVER, EVER GREASE AN ANGEL FOOD PAN.....THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF ENABLING IT TO RISE!!! SIMPLY RUN A THIN SHARP KNIFE AROUND THE EDGE OF THE PAN AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE CONE AFTER COOLING, THEN I FLIP IT OVER IN MY HAND THEN FLIP OVER ON A PRETTY PLATTER.....COMES OUT BEAUTIFULLY! SERVED MINE WITH STRAWBERRY/RHUBARB COMPOTE.......MMMMMMMMMMM!

Made this for my mother for Easter and she loved it. She is hoarding slices of it in the freezer for later. It was not as high as a regular angel food cake I made the same weekend, but it was very good.

For some reason it didn't rise very much.  But I would make it again because it's so very yummy!
