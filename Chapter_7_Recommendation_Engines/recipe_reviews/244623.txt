Wonderful for sleep and inflammation. Turmeric is a traditional Ayurvedic herb.  However, if you want to follow Ayurvedic principles, do not cook honey. It should only be added when the drink is warm and not hot. Otherwise it makes a sticky substance in the body called ama that gums up the works.. Hence, only  4 stars.

Fantastic! This was my first time using fresh turmeric root and I picked a winner of a recipe! I can see myself making this over and over again.  No changes needed. Fresh turmeric is so much better than powdered, so I highly recommend you try this, even if you don't care for the powdered form.  To save time, I just strained the milk into my cup instead of getting my immersion blender out.  And since this only makes one cup, I suggest you double the recipe because you will love it! I ended up topping off my cup with extra almond milk. Delicious!

For your body to absorb the tumeric you need to add 1/4 teas pepper. Also like!email other viewer coconut oil is a great additive

Soooo delicious and soooo healthy! Next time I make it, I'm going to add a banana! I did use agave nectar instead of honey, I love it!

I doubled this and drink it often. I use powdered turmeric and ginger added the black pepper. One thing I changed is I mix the powders with honey left it for a few minutes then add a bit of hot water so that it’s not grainy. Then stir in almond milk and coconut milk. It’s so delicious

Good, however I agree with another reviewer. It needs peppercorns.  I also like more of a bite so I add a dash of cayenne.  Coconut oil is also nice for body!

Nothing to change here! I was skeptical in making this, but it's surprisingly good and with many health benefits. Consumed nightly for just over a week and actually felt it helped me feel better (digestive quite a bit and now sleep too perhaps.) Also, tried with adding the peppercorn as other reviewers suggested. If you have acid reflux or GERD, do not add the peppercorns.  You'll still reap benefits without the pepper. Will be making this again! Thank you for sharing the recipe, BQ!

Wow! I have never had anything like this and it will definitely not be the last!  I assume this is something that can be made in larger batches and stored in the fridge to be warmed later with the honey. Thank you for sharing!

I only had Vanilla oat milk, ground turmeric, ground ginger and ground cinnamon and the honey and it turned out wonderful! A great drink to snuggle up with in winter!
