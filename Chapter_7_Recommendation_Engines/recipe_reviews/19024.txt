I made this for my fiance's birthday and everyone LOVED it!  Some said that it was the best dessert they ever tasted and none of them could believe that I actually made it myself!  It is a great treat to make for both adults and children.  Pour a little 151 bacardi over it and light it on fire to make the treat extra special!

I get asked to make this cake for birthday parties/going away parties. It is so easy, you cannot screw it up, and you can mix it up easily by using different ice creams. 
What I did for a change was use the fudge at the bottom of the pan, and pour evenly on top oreo cookie crumbs, freeze it, then do an ice cream layer, then freeze it, do another layer of fudge/cookie, freeze, do another layer of ice cream, freeze. Works out really really well.

I made this for my son's 19th birthday. He doesn't like cake, loves coffee in any form, especially ice cream, and he was super happy with this. I didn't add the mini marshmallows, decorated the marshmallow creme instead. My husband said this was the best ice cream cake he has ever had! We especially love the fudge sauce recipe. I used a premium baking bar of bittersweet chocolate (60% Cacao), and it was just the right sweetness. The fudge sauce keeps perfectly in the frig, then we just heat for 15 - 25 seconds in the microwave. YUMMY! We are having it as a dip for strawberries and pineapple for tonight's dessert!   Thank you for sharing :)

Fantastic! But this is not a cake, it is a pie, also, a kitchen torch will toast the marshmallows nicely without melting the ice cream.

I made this ice cream cake for my husband b-day and he really enjoyed it. I did make a few changes, but that's the fun part about recipes you can tweek them to your liking. Instead of graham crackers I substituted oreo cookies and sprinkled the toasted almonds over the coffee ice cream. I also used up the rest of the heavy whipping cream and made whipped cream to place on top instead of the toasted marshmallows. I thought the marshmallows would be to sweet. It was very easy and I would definitely make this again.

Positively addicting!  We subsituted the coffee ice cream for vanilla or chocolate, and it is wonderful either way.  I couldn't stop eating it! Try it and you will LOVE it!

I'd give this recipe a 10 star!!! This was AWESOME, instead of coffee ice cream I used chocolate. Afraid it may turn out too sweet, I subsituted 60% cocoa chocolate chips for semi-sweet and it was perfect! Also, I thought putting it under a broiler might melt the ice cream too quickly so instead, I used a flame torch (used for creme bruele) on the marshmallow. I ended up not using the marshmallow cream, didn't need it. I knew it was a keeper after I tasted it and someone told me it was good enough to sell.

My daughter chose this for her birthday 'cake' this year and it got rave reviews. It's super easy to make. I don't have a food processor, so I just mashed up the graham crackers with a rolling pin, and luckily I had bought slivered almonds, so I just left them as they were. I did use fat-free evaporated milk in place of the cream in the chocolate sauce as I always do and it was fine. I agree that this would work with most any kind of ice cream. I think next time I would definitely use a coffee chip flavor, or coconut chip would be awesome. I was a little leery of the marshmallow cream and marshmallows--it just seemed weird--and especially of putting an ice cream pie in the broiler, but it was a great touch, and I think it was what made it special. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for Valentine's day for my boyfriend and he and I both loved it! I thought it was better the next day when the marshmallows had frozen onto the cake.  The sweetness was almost too overpowering when the marshmallows came hot out of the oven.  I will definitely make this again!  I think I will try adding a cake layer to the bottom next time.

Be careful when broiling the marshmallows! They caught on fire for me. We scraped off the blackened marshmallows and ate the rest. It tasted good and I might make it again with some changes. I would use a 9x13 pan and probably just top the marshmallow creme with additional toasted almonds so I could skip the flames!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I used  a combination of chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Make sure to give this time to become closer to room temperature before cutting. The graham cracker crust is too hard straight out of the freezer. I thought the marshmallows weren't needed though. It was fantastic.

Directions are confusing.  It states repeat layers, but there are enough ingredients to repeat layers twice but then there wasn't any fudge left over. I made 3 layers but they were muttled. Next time I would only make 2 layers  Broiled on high 2 minutes...too long

I really like this recipe lots!  I only made it once, but I want to make it again.  It's so so good... just an awesome dessert!  This recipe is not difficult either.  Fairly simple.
