This made a great light lunch! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it absolutely needs a little fresh cracked sea salt, fresh ground pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to take it to the next level (which I added after I took the picture). I used low fat cottage cheese b/c I can't do the fat free, and white basalmic vinegar instead of regular. I just eyeballed everything to taste. I could totally picture eating this w/ a few slices of toasted garlic crostini, which I did not have today, but will next time. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

If you love cottage cheese like I do, you will love this.  I used a touch of white balsamic vinegar on the tomatoes and basil and then stirred in the cottage cheese, which was nice.  The regular balsamic would give the cottage cheese a muddy color - in which case I think I would not mix the tomatoes & basil into the cottage cheese but serve on top.

SO delicious!!! I don't even miss the Mozarella. For a slightly creamier texture with less "bite," low fat cottage cheese is great too. It's wonderful! Thank you. I will make this again and again.

I'm impressed.  Love mozz caprese but don't love the calories involved with all that cheese.  This is a great alternative.  Lots of tomatoes and too much balsamic vinegar.  I started eyeballing all the ing rather than measuring after I made this a few times- like 6 times in the last week!  I like it heavy on the tomatoes with just a splash or 2 of the vinegar.  Hubs even loves it!  I have added cut up red onion which was a nice addition.  Great way to use up all the fresh basil I have!

I used "lite" cottage cheese, not fat free. I did not measure my balsamic, I just drizzled a little over the top. Absolutely delicious. I almost licked the bowl. I seriously ate both servings.

My hubby and I really liked this. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar by just a little. I did use coarse ground sea salt and coarse ground pepper also. Very Good!! Will definitely make again. Maybe tomorrow!!

So good, I also added a little red onion, sea salt and used a balsamic glaze instead of strait balsamic vinegar. Great either way though.

Very good.  I did use white balsamic reduced vinegar as I really didn't want  the dark color by using regular balsamic. This would be just as good without any vinegar, too. Fresh basil is so delightful. Will definitely make again.
