Use a DEEP DISH 9" pan.  I saw this pie and HAD to make it because it sounded so fabulous.  First, I will disclaim that while I am not a novice pie person, neither am I one of those “I can throw a pie together in 15 shakes” people.  I was very doubtful about the double crust on the bottom, so I didn’t attempt it at Thanksgiving. I was afraid it might be doughy, and I could not readily find another example of that method. A single crust came out perfect, with a candied crispness. Next time I will try the double crust. I used 9” pans (I made two), but had way too much rum filling – use a DEEP DISH 9” pan.  The cheese layer floated ABOVE the corn syrup/rum layer, which I didn’t expect.   It’s very delicious. I might switch to either brown sugar and/or dark corn syrup in the custard, and add lemon or orange zest to the cream cheese in the future.  (I had so much rum custard left over that I made a small pecan pie with the remaining rum custard. DELICIOUS!!

Did not expect the cheesecake layer to mix with the pecan layer. I used new Rum extract but it is so strong the pie was barely touched by anyone. I was disappointed to say the least and I will not be making this pie again.

Yummy! Love love it! Even my husband who doesn't have a real sweet tooth loved it. Super easy and quick prep time. I love the double crust too. If you love pecan pie and cheese cake you can't go wrong with this recipe. Thanks for sharing starmaster25!

I subbed 6 TBSP dark rum for the 2tsp rum extract (I googled the conversion ratio).

This pie/ cheesecake was absolutely delicious;  it was easy to make too. I loved it the way it came out. My husband said he would increase the cheesecake part. Either way, it is a keeper!
