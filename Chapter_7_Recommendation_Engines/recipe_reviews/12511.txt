EASY!!!  I didn't do it light, however. I made it as directed but substituted regular cream cheese for the light and custard style vanilla yogurt for the coconut  yogurt.  My husband is a huge coconut lover and he was thrilled with it.  I enjoyed it as well.

I used chocolate pudding and the light cream cheese.  Poured it into a store bought chocolate graham cracker crust.  It had to set overnight to get firm enough to eat.

Excellent! Lower fat but it sure tasted like it was rich and delicious! Will make this again. Used pina colada Yoplait fat free yogurt and turned out so good.  Also put a little of coconut extract for more coconut flavor.

Delicious and EASY! I have also done this with plain fat free greek yogurt instead of coconut yogurt and it turns out great! I also like to put toasted coconut on top. YUM!! This would also be good with a different flavor of yogurt and something instead of coconut (though I do love the coconut) like chocolate or peanut butter.

Everyone loves it when I make this! I've made it about 4 times and it barely lasts two days. It's easy to make & great for last minute gatherings.

Fabulous!  I was looking for a recipe my roommate used to make that is similar but I like this better!  I used strawberry banana yogurt (because that's what I had) but I can't wait to try it with coconut because I love coconut!  Delish!

I used two containers of coconut greek yogurt since they were 5.3 oz each and I didn't want to save the leftover. It was very good. I made a graham crust with graham crackers(1 1/2 cups crushed) and 3 TBS of soft margarine....no added sugar.

I had this at a friend's house and she told me to go here to my favorite recipe website to find the recipe. I had to make it again soon for myself!

You can substitute the coconut for 4 oz melted baking chocolate, and the yogurt for plain no fat vainilla yogurt for a low fat chocolate pie.

Was very easy to make and tasted good.  I added toasted coconut to the top to make it pretty and I used a shortbread cookie crust instead of the graham cracker crust.  This was good but really lacked in the coconut flavor.
