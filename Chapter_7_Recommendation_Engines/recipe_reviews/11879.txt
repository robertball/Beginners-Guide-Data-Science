An even easier (and better tasting) recipe for the same thing is to boil some bow tie pasta (or use some leftover pasta- any shape will work but NOT any long pasta like spaghetti), then dice up a few slices of raw bacon, cook it in a frying pan, add the drained pasta, and crack in an egg or two (depends on how much you're making and how you like it), and stir it all around until the egg is cooked.  Salt and pepper to taste.  You can replace the bacon with diced pepperoni and a bit of butter if you like.  I was a foreign exchange student in Austria for a year, and my host mom always made this if she was in a hurry- she called it fast food.  Tastes great!

5 stars when made with a few variations. 1. skip the cheese. 2.toss in cubed cooked chicken and mushrooms 3. pepper MAKES this meal add a LOT. 4. Add a generous dollop of milk when you toss in the eggs for a creamier sauce. We always serve it with a salad and prefer fettuccine noodles but any kind of noddle works well. This is comfort food at it's best.

This was a bit unusual for us but it was suprisingly delicious.  We used sausage rather than bacon and I prefer just a light sprinkling of cheddar on top rather than the Velvetta.  I've actually been craving this since we made it. Thanks for sharing.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because I made it for my very PICKY 7-yr old.  (I don't think I would make it for adults b/c it wasn't very pretty, but tasted great!)  I'm always looking for recipes that he would like b/c he's so picky.  I used the Multi Grain Penne instead of Spaghetti b/c that is what he likes.  I also added some pureed veggies in it with the cheese and egg mixture (of course he doesn't KNOW that!) Be sure and add a lil milk to the mixture too.  I did not use the onions (for obvious reasons) but did use some onion powder.  I also added some mixed Italian style shredded cheese.  I sprinkled some more bacon bits (from the package) on the top with more of the Italian style cheese.  Also, to the reviewer that stated something about "raw" eggs...the eggs cook faster than the cheese even melts, so no worries there.  Anyway, HE LOVED it and we will be making this again.  Thank you!

A hit!! I had a craving for breakfast for dinner and this worked!  Everyone in my family loved it!  Suggestions:  1.needs more bacon, maybe double  2. I used 6 eggs  3. I didn't have an onion so used dry onion pieces 4. I used mozz. cheese and it was great!  5. I added chopped frozen spinach thawed to get the veggies in. So you can see it's hard to go wrong!  Very quick meal to make and clean up with common ingredients!  5 stars all the way!

my kids loved it and asked for more, i found it to come out a little sticky so i added butter to the finished product and was then eaiser to eat.  i wouldn't try it on a busy morning though due to waiting for the water to boil for the spahgetti.

We will definitely be eating this again as my picky 2 year old even liked it. This was really good but I would make a few changes next time I make it. I added 1-2 Tablespoons of milk to the mixture in order to help with the cheese melting and to make it a little creamier. I also added around 1 tsp of fresh ground pepper to the eggs when I scrambled them. I will add a dash or two of cayenne pepper to the eggs next time around to give them some body. I added tabasco to my portion at the table but it is a little strong for my hubby. I also followed the recipe for the velveeta, but added about a 1/3 cup sharp cheddar cheese as well.

This recipe is a little scary, but it is quite good!!  It seems so odd to be eating bacon and eggs with pasta, but if you can get past that it is worth it to try it, especially with kids of any age.  You can use a few extra eggs or any different number of cheese combinations.  I used some american and mozzarella as it is what I had on hand.  I wouldnt use two onions - that would be way too much onion.   As other reviewers have mentioned, when you pour the eggs in, just stir it - it will cook - it kind of binds to the pasta.  Thanks for sharing - it is a great way to use leftover spaghetti!!

Surprisingly good. I think I had the same reservations everyone had. Mostly about the eggs being raw but they do cook before the cheese even melts as stated. Very good. Pretty quick for a weeknight evening. And a bonus being the ingredients are a strange mixture of what you just might have left in the fridge at the end of the month.

This dish was extremely easy to make and tastes awesome!  It does look kind of gross and it is an unusual dish, but it tastes really good.  This meal is great for lunch or dinner, and I think that next time I'll add some more veggies - maybe spinach.

So quick and easy.  I made all of the ingredients (used egg & egg white combination) and then cooked each portion separately, since some of us like bacon and some like onions, etc.  I added peas to mine!

This was just ok for me--a little bland and sticky.  I left out the onions because I don't like them, so it may be my own fault that the flavor was lacking.  I wouldn't make again.

WOW! What a tasty way to start the day! I used more bacon & drained almost all the grease away before sauteing the onion but other than that, I didn't change a thing. Yummy!

I tried this on my boyfriend last night who is very picky. He told me this was a keeper. I drained the onions on paper towel before I added the other ingredients and added milk like another reviewer did. Took out some of the fat and made the sauce richer.

This was a pretty good recipe. I have to say that it's downfall would be that the eggs give it a strange texture but it's still very good tasting. I used only three eggs and I think that was plenty. I added a bit of milk and a bit of butter as well as some of the bacon grease. Before adding this it seemed pretty sticky so these additions seemed to help. I also added quite a bit of pepper which I think added to it. My kids topped it with the green can type of parmesan and they really enjoyed it. I have three kids ages 2,4,and 9 and it's very seldom that there is anything they will all eat so for that fact alone it's a winner in my book. Thanks for something different!

A good use for left over spaghetti. I used one large onion, instead of two. I added frozen spinach straight from freezer & cooked with the onion in the bacon grease. I should of drained or patted some of the grease afterwards. This would of avoided any fatty taste. Other than that, I would fix it again. Looks wasn't special but everyone went back for seconds.

This is a really fast and GREAT recipe! I didn't add the cheese, due to the fact that one of my daughters is lactose intolerant. It was wonderful even with out the cheese! A new family favorite, great any time of the day!

Easy and delicious!  This was a definite crowd pleaser in our house.  My family loves bacon, so I used a whole pound.  I also went with rotini instead of spaghetti - felt it made the meal a little more visually appealing.

I didn't change the recipe at all.  This is a winner in my house-my picky husband and VERY picky 2 year old love this.  It seems to work best with Oscar Mayer bacon for me-I have used other brands and it comes out too greasy.  Great recipe!

Not very good at all. We followed the recipe exactly as stated. The eggs give the dish no additional flavor. Velveeta makes it taste cheap. If you're looking for a similar and MUCH tastier recipe, just make classic, homemade mac and cheese and add your own bacon. This recipe doesn't come together as anything special.

I was pleasantly surprised how well this turned out.  It was yummy!  I used the grated parmesan in the green can (I know, but I didn't have anything else!).  And it still turned out great. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks Karena

The flavor was fine but texture was very gummy. Next time I am going to add milk or butter.

I was looking for something to make for breakfast one day using what I had on hand and found this recipe.  I'll agree it was pretty ugly but when I tasted it I was IN LOVE!  I used finely shredded 4 cheese Italian blend because that is what I had and it was spectacular!  This is my new favorite weekend breakfast dish!  Thanks Karena!!

My mom made a version of this when we were kids,we called it a spagetti omelet,she called it pasta hash.If she made it with leftover potato it was potato hash.Now I'm grown up I call it a fridge dinner,easy mixture of stuff that is leftover in the fridge.Use a little goat cheese if you have it,it becomes very creamy and good.But thats whats great about this concept very easy to suit your own personal taste.

I was intrigued with this recipe and with a couple of adjustments for personal reasons, it was delicious! Did not let us down! It was easy to make, not time consuming and used ingredients that are usually on hand..  Since I was making for only 2 I used 8 oz of pasta, 6 regular sliced bacon, 1/2 c chopped onion, 5 eggs, 1-2 Tbsp milk with the eggs and 6 oz velveeta + 1/4 c 3 alarm cheese sliced finely. Make sure you continuously stir the mixture once you add the egg/cheese mixture to the other ingredients because it could stick very quickly!

I like caronara, but I am hesitant to eat raw eggs. So, this dish, slightly different from carbonara though, is a good way to enjoy spaghetti. To add color, I toss some chopped spinach with eggs and cheese.  This pasta recipe is easy and pretty good; I might make this again when I don't have much time to prepare dinner.
