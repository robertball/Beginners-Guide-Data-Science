I didn't have any pears, so I made it with 2 apples instead, and it was delicious. I loved the way the rosemary brought out the sweetness of the apple. The parsnip doesn't have much flavor on its own, but it adds heartiness and bulk to the soup. Because the flavors are subtle, premium chicken stock, preferably homemade, is a must. If I were going to change anything, I might add a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to accent the parsnips and leeks.
