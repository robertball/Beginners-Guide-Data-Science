When I found this recipe I had not saved any of the drippings so I replaced it with chicken broth. Very simple to make and tastes wonderful!

Delicious! I made it as directed except like others used broth and water, and tossed in a chicken boullion cube for good measure. Everything else was the same with recipe halved as its just my hubby and I. Very easy, turned out great, will make again thanks!
