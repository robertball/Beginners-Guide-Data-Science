The taste was good but it was super dry. I mixed the shells instead of stuffing them to save time. It needs 3/4 cup of tomato sauce instead of just 1/4.

Couldn't find gluten free shells, so layered it with gluten free pennee.  Doubled the recipe, increased the amounts of cheese to taste.  It was delicious.   A definite "do it again".

I added chopped broccoli.  I also made homemade mushroom soup. A food processor is a girls best friend. My friend ate this n he hates mushrooms. I put my chicken in my power cooker n let it do the work for me..
Cool it put it apart n put everything together n put it in the oven with some mozzarella cheese on 350 for 30 minutes n call it a day. Less clean up. I always save stock..

Made it with rigatoni pasta instead of stuffed shells (less work) and the sauce was fantastic - thanks!!  I only gave it 4 stars because some people get cranky if you give it 5 but change something so erring on the cautious side and giving it 4.

I was in a hurry so served with pasta instead of stuffing shells.  Used a little extra cream cheese and broth because did not have the wedge and goat cheeses, and the taste was still delicious.
