I have used this basic recipe for a couple of years. It's four stars with the changes that I made. I added a tsp of vanilla and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. I don't like a sweet pound cake. I added more like a heaping half cup of sour cream. The first time I made this it started to burn. Now I bake it at 350. If anyone is new to baking and unsure of what a pinch is just use a 1/8 tsp measure for the salt and the baking soda and you will be fine.

This is excellent!  This is what I did to make it come out that way.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract to the batter.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 75 minutes.  

The inside was moist and tender. The outside was crusty and rich.

I topped it with whipped cream and sliced, sugared fresh strawberries.

It was yummy!

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe, used cake flour, a tube pan and dropped the temperature to 350.  The cake was perfect!  Remember..eggs and butter at room temperature and don't overbeat. This recipe is a keeper!

I already had this basic recipe in my file, but I needed to make a few changes.  To start, I doubled the recipe so that I could use a 10 cup tube pan instead of a loaf pan.  I always make sure that my ingredients are room temperature before I start.  This is very important in cake baking.  I creamed the butter and sugar, but I used unsalted butter and I used 2 1/2 sticks instead.  I kept the sugar at three cups and I used seven large eggs separating the yolks, adding them one at a time, beating well after each addition.  I put the egg whites in a glass bowl and set aside.  Then I added the extracts to the mixture, but I did something different.  I like a very flavorful cake, so I used one teaspoon each of orange, lemon and almond extract and two teaspoons of vanilla extract and never, ever use imitation.  I just can't imagine baking a cake without some extract or other flavoring. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and I sifted it three times.  Because I like to use unsalted butter I had to add 1/2 teaspoon salt, plus 1/4 teaspoon baking soda to the flour.  I split the flour into thirds and added it alternating with the sour cream.  Then, I beat the egg whies until stiff peaks were formed and folded them into the batter, poured the batter into the tube pan and baked for about 90 minutes at 350 degrees.  This cake was perfect and its a nice big cake. I simply love it and its moist, too.

Beautiful, classic pound cake, tho' I do add a pinch of salt and a flavoring as well - vanilla, almond, lemon -  the possibilities are unlimited. I also use the traditional preparation method: cream the butter and sugar very well, a good few minutes, until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the flour and sour cream alternately in thirds, beginning and ending with the flour.  Set timer shorter than  designated baking time to guarantee a moist cake by not overbaking.  Delicious. On this occasion I used this batter for cupcakes - one recipe makes 12.  Make a double recipe for a Bundt or tube pan.

I added lemon zest and poppy seed to this recipe. Zest of one lemon, juice of lemon and 1/4 cup poppy seeds. Then I added a lemon glaze of lemon juice, powdered sugar and milk.

My husband is a great cook, but following detailed recipes is not his style. This is an easy to follow recipe with a tremendous pay off! The crust is crisp with a tender and moist cake in the middle! Watch the time, as our oven cooks it in 45 min. Also, double the recipe if using a bundt pan!

Very good, with minor changes.  I added vanilla extract, baked at 350, but had to cover with foil after 40 minutes to keep from getting too brown.  I might reduce the sugar a bit next time.

I think personally, that the flavor was ok (that's based on the batter, anyways). However,the cake came out dry and I was very careful not to overmix or overbake. Not pleased; will not use again.

According to my husband, this is the best Pound Cake I've ever made.  Over the years, several times, I've tried unsuccessfully to duplicate his beloved aunt's pound cake.  This is the closest I've come to her version.  It was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this cake again.  I think I'd like to try it with a sour cream icing/glaze.

So buttery good! A trick to make this moister: after creaming the butter and sugar, add 2 tablespoons of boiling water and beat for 1 minute. Continue the recipe as written. I add this trick to all the cakes I make where you cream butter and sugar together. I've made this 2 times in 1 week. Thanks for posting this winner!

This only just misses the coveted 5 star rating by a whisker. It's a solid starting point. However, it loses a half star because 1) it benefits greatly from the addition of flavoring and 2) the instructions are incorrect. No way around it. The temperature is too high, and the timing too long. Had I baked it at the indicated 375 degrees and left it in for 50 minutes (subtract 10 minutes to compensate for the larger pan I used - read on) the result would have been a dark brown outside, and and a dry inside. It should be baked at 350 degrees. Because I don't have the loaf pan size specified, I used a 9"X5" pan, and 45 minutes resulted in a perfectly baked cake. The texture is spot-on for a pound cake, dense, with a moist, velvety crumb. Excellent keeper, presumably because of the sour cream, which imparts a lovely flavor. I used 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp each of orange and lemon extracts. This can be tailored to your tastes. 1-2 tsp vanilla will give you a flavorful plain cake, but you can use any combination you'd like, such as almond, coconut, anise, lemon, rum, maple, orange, or a little of all of them. If you like citrus, fold in 1-2 tsp finely grated zest. Infinitely variable. It's fast and easy to throw together in no time at all. Freezes well, but do not store for more than 4 months tops, double-wrapped in plastic for optimum quality. Looks like a Sarah Lee or Entenmann's cake, with a far superior flavor to either. With these minor modifications, stellar!

I'm the food service officer on board a US Navy warship.  We needed to get rid of 10 cases of sour cream before it went bad.  I found this recipe and had my sailors make 800 portions.  I was a little nervous that increasing it by so much may throw off the chemistry and the recipe would flop. One taste and I knew it would be a hit. The crew LOVED the pound cake.  Thanks for a delicious and simple recipe.

Absolutely incredible!  Yum, yum, and yum!  I made only a few changes to suit my taste (lessened sugar to 3/4 cup), and divided the batter in two batches - poured first half in the loaf pan, then sprinkled with fresh, chopped strawberries, then poured remaining second half of batter over the strawberries.. smoothed the top (I tossed the chopped strawberries with a little bit of flour, to help them not "sink" to the bottom while baking - and it really worked)!  I followed the suggestions of baking at 350 F, and I only had to go for 55 minutes until the toothpick test came out clean, and the top was a light golden brown (gorgeous).  I topped each slice with homemade whipped cream that I folded more chopped strawberries into..and sprinkled slivered almonds on the whipped cream.  I posted pictures, so you can see what the inside looks like, with the layer of strawberries!  You can probably substitute with other berries, and yield similar results. :)

I have never rated a recipe before, but this one deserves endless praise!  I am making a birthday cake for my husband, and I needed a dense cake that would carve well.  I made 6 batches of this batter and baked it into sheets.  It is the most delicious, moist, awesome cake I have ever had the pleasure of baking.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add a tsp of vanilla per batch.  This one is going to have a permanent home in my recipe box at home!

Have made two of these in the last week. My first one was over done but still tasty. (Oven's fault) so made another one yesterday and it is PURE HEAVEN! I used vanilla and almond extract and cooked for about 54 minutes...yummy! Last night we feasted on strawberry shortcake with homemade whipped cream..what can I say..BLISS! Such a simple recipe but yet so tasty!!

Great simple easy recipe.  Followed exactly only added a little Almond Extract.  My cake was ready after 40 minutes, so just be careful of the cook time.

I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and doubled for Bundt cake. I also used the cooking instructions of other reviewers, cooking at a lower temp. Yum!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a teaspoon each of PURE vanilla and almond extracts. This baked at 350* for just under 70 minutes. I did cover the pound cake halfway through the baking time with foil to prevent the top from burning. This is a delicious pound cake--the flavor that the sour cream adds to this dessert is just perfect.

I used cupcakes instead of a rectangular pan. It came out beautiful. It made 11 good size cupcakes. The top is crunchy, the middle is moist and spongy. Nice to eat while still warm. To be successful in baking this cake or any cake you have to know your oven. Cakes bake at different temp because we use different size/height/width of pans or cupcakes. Keep in mind baking time/temp vary in oven performance as well (from electric, gas or fan-forced). You have to adjust the temp according to size/deepness of the pan you are using. I do think 375 is too hot to bake this cake. The top will burn quickly. My oven is a small fan-forced oven, I set the temp to 275 F. At 30 mins, I checked it - the top was golden brown but the toothpick came out with cake batter so i put it back for another 10 mins. So mine only took 40 mins to bake cupcakes. When I used a rectangular pan, I also set the temp at 275 and checked it at 30 mins. From there I checked it every 10 mins until a toothpick inserted into center of cake came out clean.

I was raised in the deep south and pound cake with ice cream after Sunday Dinner was the dessert my grandmother most often served, especially in the summer.
Her pound cake was the traditional kind (only butter, sugar, eggs and flour) and while it was really yummy, I always felt my aunt's with sour cream was a little better.
This recipe is very close. 
I doubled it, added 1/2 t almond extract, used 1/2 t baking soda and 1/2 t salt and cooked it longer and slower (1 hr 15 min at 325 degrees) in a bundt pan.   Mmmmmmmm!
I'm planning to serve it tomorrow after our barbecue with homemade peach ice cream. (If it lasts that long!)

This is a great recipe.  I professionally decorated cakes and used this recipe as it can handle the weight of buttercream frosting.  This cake is very versitile as it also can be baked in many different type of pans and takes many types of toppings.  It also tastes best alone.

I really enjoy this versatile cake.  It is so delicious that I make it once a week.  The suggestion to add the zest and juice from one lemon is out of this world.  The first time I made it in the loaf pan but it would not finish cooking in the middle.  I now use a bundt pan and it is perfect.  Even if I double the recipe the pan works beautifully.

My new favorite pound cake recipe. This recipe uses less ingredients, is fluffier, takes less time to bake and is the perfect balance of sweetness.

Great cake and very simple! I took a few recommendations from the reviews: added vanilla and a little bit of lemon zest. I also baked at 350 and that caused it to run more towards an hour and twenty minutes. Everyone raved about the crunchy crust and delightful, chewy inside. I was not too fussy about mixing everything in, and it still had a few lumps when it went in the oven but it came out perfect. On round two of making this, I used vanilla yogurt and that worked really well also. My friend said that this was better than his mom's pound cake and apparently that is a really big deal.

This cake turned out terrible. It took much longer to bake and was very dry. I will not make this again.I have baked many cakes over the last 20 years.

I loved this and will make it again and again, though I did make some revisions.  I doubled the recipe to bake it in a Bundt pan and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract to the batter and baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes and covered it with foil for the last 20 minutes since I was afraid it was going to burn. The crust did come out golden brown but it is sweet and crunchy and the cake itself is pretty moist and delicious. I sprinkled the top with some powdered sugar to visually dress it up a bit, but it certainly is sweet enough on its own.  Great recipe and thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this and it was simple to make, although I added 2 tsp vanilla, and mini choc. chips, and 1 cup sourcream. It was definitely moist and dense, but didn't have much flavor. I may add a bit of extract like almond or orange next time. Very simple to throw together and I like that it was a recipe for a smaller cake. I brought it to work and it was all gone by 9:30 am.  UPDATE: I made a chocolate version of this cake by adding 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1 cup sourcream, 1tsp vanilla and 1 tsp orange extract, 1Tbs more butter,(used half brown, half white sugar) it was dense but moist and the orange/chocolate combo is fantastic. I love this recipe. (don't overcook the chocolate version! or it will be dry) :+)

This recipe makes a good, tasty pound cake. I don't usually make scratch cakes, but decided to do this one after I something in the photos. I didn't think it rose as much as it should have, but again, I'm not the worlds best baker. The taste was great. We ate this with apricot preserves and sour cream. Thanks!

Yum Yum Yum! This cake was so tasty. It was cakey, yet dense and moist and great flavor. I can easily see this becoming a staple in my kitchen. I made some adjustments to the recipe as others suggested. I added salt, decreased sugar to 1 1/4 cup, increased the vanilla to 3 tsp, and increased the sour cream to a 1 cup. I used all-purpose flour so I made sure to use a little bit less than what was written in the recipe and I also made sure to sift it twice. I baked it in an 8x8 pan instead of a loaf pan at 350 degrees but may reduce the heat next time to avoiding over-browning.

After reading alot of the reviews, I took the following suggestions:
1. I DOUBLED the recipe and used a bundt pan, plus...
2. I added 2 tsp vanilla extract
3. I added 2 tsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed
4. I added 2 pinches of salt
5. I Lowered temp to 350 and baked for exactly 60 min. for doubled batch (check it early though, depending on your oven can be done within 55 min. )

This is delicious-dense and moist.  My only change was to add the juice and zest of one lemon and some vanilla extract.  I did not have a problem with it being dry as some reviewers noted, but I watched the time in the oven carefully.

Excellent; good texture. Wasn't dry, but I was surprised that it wasn't as moist as I thought it would be. But that could be the baking time; I dropped the oven to 350 since ours errs on the "slightly too warm" side, but it was still a little tanner than I'd like before 60 minutes was up. So, keep an eye on it, the temps and time might be a little off. It didn't completely fill my loaf pan either, but mine might be a little taller than most? The recipe itself is spot-on. I added lemon zest and a teaspoon of lemon extract, and dressed with a lemon glaze later.

Yummy!  I added vanilla, butter extract and almond extract.  I mixed the baking soda to the sour cream and folded it on at the end.

Great basic recipe. Followed the sugar reduction and sour cream addition suggestions, and the pound cake made a perfect base for fresh berries and homemade ice cream.

Outstanding cake! I'm a pound cake fanatic and this is one of the best recipes ever!  I did, however, add 1 teaspoon vanilla and about 2 Tablespoons bourbon for a nice flavour.  Delicious!

I doubled the recipe, used cake flour and cooked it in a tube pan as another reviewer suggested and obtained excellent results. With these variations 1 hour and 10 minutes was the perfect cook time.

I have made this five or six times now.  I have added vanilla, lime juice, and almond extract at different times.  I have made it in a loaf pan and as cupcakes.  It's consistently a hit.  I like that it is a simple recipe I can make quickly with the help of my young kids.  It is plain enough that their friends all like it, and it doesn't have to have icing to be good, making it easy to pack and eat for kids.  I double the recipe

Awesome base recipe.. I doubled the recipe and used a bundt (tube) pan; and agree with other reviewers and don't like overly sweet products, so reduced the sugar (2 cups for a double recipe). My other changes were: tsp of vanilla; zest of two lemons, juice of one lemon; 1/4 cup poppy seed as another reviewer has recommended.. Also reduced the heat to 350  as heavier cakes do well with lower temp and a little longer cooking time. Thanks for sharing this wonderful vintage recipe!

I've baked this cake twice. The first time I followed it exactly except I reduced my cooking time to 50 minutes and tooth pick came out clean. It was a great cake.  The second time I replaced half of the sugar with splenda (3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup splenda) and it tasted exactly the same as the origional.  Next time Im going to try substituting the splenda for the sugar totally. I believe it will taste the same as the origional that way.

We loved this pound cake and will definetely make again. I made a few changes. The recipe was doubled except for the sugar, I reduced it by 1/4 cup, added 2 tsp. vanilla, fresh farm eggs (which made the color turn a rich yellow) & reduced the temp. to 350. I also used a bundt pan. Have to say it was fast & easy. Thumbs up!!!

This is my first pound cake.  It was good.  I used cake flour because that was what I have.  I added some vanilla.  I also lowered the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and i still thought it was pretty sweet.  Put the temp to 350 in the last half hour.  I will be making more pound cakes then come back here to update.  Thanks for the formula.

I made this cake last night and we all loved it! Very MOIST! Absolutely delicious... I follow the recipe but made some adjustments as suggested by some reviewers: I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and I separated the egg yolk from the whites and folded the beat egg whites into the dough at the end.

Excellent recipe - delicious with strawberries and whipped cream. Needed a lower temperature and longer time as the outside started to get a bit darker than I wanted. Agree that 1 scant cup of sugar is better or it's just too sweet.
But very moist and delicious.

Wonderful. Followed the directions exactly. Made a great strawberry shortcake. Good toasted with butter on it for breakfast. Will add some vanilla next time.

A VERY easy cake, which turned out nice. I baked it at 325 for 1 hour in a bundt pan. Instead of greasing the pan I used 2 tbsp butter and sprinkled 1/4 cup sugar over the butter, which gave the cake a great candied crust. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. Overall, a good basic pound cake recipe.

Lower temperature to 350!  I wish I'd read all the suggestions before I'd followed the recipe as written because my cake was overdone at only 45 minutes.  It was still tasty, but the recipe itself is faulty.

This is not pound cake. The cake is fluffy instead of dense and terribly bland. It needs vanilla extract and salt. Also, baking at 375 burns the outside before the inside is cooked.

This is the first cake that I ever made from scratch.  I accidentally put 1 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 1/2 cup of sour cream so I had to use two loaf pans, and it still came out great.  I was very impressed.

this is a great pound cake, especially for beginners! the crumb is firm and moist, the crust is crispy and sweet. i had extra batter left, so i made it into muffins and baked for 45 minutes. a sweet treat for children. watch the time carefully: my cake actually collapsed in the middle when i tried to revert it onto a rack for cooling! Serving suggestion: try serving with a warm berry sauce, made by heating seedless berry jam of your choice until its smooth, then adding a light orange liqueur until you like the taste. Enjoy!

I've finally found the perfect pound cake recipe to build on.  I love this!  My only change was to add a pinch of salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. This cake is moist and the texture is a lot smoother than others I've tried.

Talk about quick and delicious! I loved that this desert uses so few ingredients and can be ready to enjoy almost as soon as it comes out of the oven!  I baked mine at 350 for approx 55 min. Eggs & butter should be at room temperature, and I cut sugar to 1 cup and added a dash of vanilla extract. Served with slice peaches one day, then fresh sliced strawberries the next.

This was such an easy recipe.   My 11 year old daughter could make it by herself with no help at all.  Made 2 in springform pans and then sliced the cakes each in half and made a four layer strawberry triffle back inside the springform pan.  After sitting in fridge for a couple of hours I popped the pan and put it on a plate for serving - beautiful.  YUM!  See Berry Bliss recipe for triffle recipe.

This was a really good pound cake.  I also turned the temp down to 350.  I dont know if my oven was too hot but the bottom started to burn before the hour went by.  But i just cut off the bottom part and it was still very tasty.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I would have rated this cake a 5 but the baking temp and time are off.  I now realize I should have checked before an hour was up...or maybe remembered to read some of the reviews before I put the cake in the oven!  The resulting cake was very dark, almost burnt on the outside, but quite tasty after I cut off a good portion of the outside crust.  I will make it again but cut the temperature down to 350 and watch the baking time to add or subtract as needed.  I think I may also add some almond extract as others have suggested.  Thanks!

Not quite a traditional pound cake but I had the ingredients and tried it out.  Very tasty and easy!  I did one batch with chocolate chips which the kids adored!  And the second batch I used the zest of one lemon and the juice of half a lemon and about a cup of frozen bluberries and poured into muffin cups.  They were a hit with my other Mom friends!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and the cake is wonderful.  Last time I did measure the sour cream (think it was a little more) and the cake was fluffier.  Both versions are great!!!

This cake is devine. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestions, and it came out perfectly. I cut the sugar in half, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and a heaping 1/2 cup of sour cream. I baked at 350 for about 50 minutes. It turned out super moist, absolutely D-Licious, and made the entire apartment smell heavenly. I will be keeping this recipe for future layered cakes. YUM!

I combined the ingredients exactly as the recipe called, and baked for 55 minutes at 350.  It came out beautifully!  The texture and flavor are excellent.  I'll definitely make this again, and next time I'll add vanilla extract.

Great cake!  I had to improvise a little with the ingredients; I used 1 1/2c. of sour cream and 3/4c of margerine instead of butter.  I also turned the oven to 350 degrees as suggested and it came out wonderful!  The outside baked a beautiful brown while the inside was dense and moist!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Made it this afternoon and had a slice for dessert this evening: very light and great texture. I added 1tsp vanilla extract. Kinda "basic" cake, but outrageously easy to make, with only a few ingredients and in no time (except cooking time). What is more, you always have to go back to classics, don't you? Gotta give it a try.

Had a spare container of sour cream that was a few days past expiration date, so I was glad to build a recipe around it. Worked fine! Added a teaspon (each) of vanilla and almond extract to mine for a strong flavor. Threw in some raisins too. Cake came out very moist inside and very mildly crispy around the edges. It's probably not for everyone and not exactly explosive on taste but still pretty good esp. for those who like moist pastries. Good with jam, etc.

8.13.17  I accidentally baked at 350ºF instead of 375ºF. but all turned out OK.  I was out of sour cream, so I sub’d plain Greek yogurt and added 1 tsp almond extract which worked well with the sliced peaches today.   Didn’t want a pound cake loaf, so I made  mini-bundt cakes which took 17 minutes, and the mini-loaf took 30 minutes at 350ºF.  Loved how few ingredients this recipe has and how quickly it went into the oven...simple, easy-peasy!  Very moist and tender, light in texture, and the perfect base for sliced fresh fruit desserts this time of year.  Only needed four mini-bundts today, so the rest are heading to the freezer.  *****UPDATE*****12.22.17  For anybody thinking about tryiing to make this recipe more diet friendly, don’t do it.  Today I used Truvia® Sugar Blend for Baking (instead of sugar) and Egg Beaters® (instead of eggs), and it was a bust.  Just follow the recipe; you’ll be happy you did.

This is a delicious, moist pound cake.  It is a basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to your taste buds and measurements adjusted easily to fit the serving sizes you want.  There were only two things I added which was salt and some vanilla extract.  I doubled the serving size recipe and was able to bake in a 10 x 13 pan that baked up beautifully.  I lowered the temperature per users suggestion of 350 degrees, and baked for 45 minutes, then increased temperature to 365 for additional 15 minutes to finish baking the middle and gave a light golden color.  This cake was definitely moist and dense.  My family gobbled up half of it with vanilla icecream on the side after waiting five minutes for it to "cool" off. ??  Perfect combination for a delicious cake ??????

I love this recipe! I added a little vanilla to the mix and baked it for 50 min. My Husband and Dad are huge fans I have made this 3 times this month and have one in the oven as I type! Can't wait to make more for family and friends this holiday season. Going to try some different add ins soon will post again if they come out the way I hope they will!!

I like to cook and eat good food but I rarely make anything with TOO many steps.  This recipe was simple, delicious, and can be made with staples I keep in my home.  Like some of the other reviews, I added vanilla extract, used room temperature eggs and butter, and in the future I will lower the temperature to 350°, use less sugar and double the recipe for a larger cake (my 1st cake was devoured).  I no longer feel the need to purchase a sour cream pound cake (which costs more than other cakes in my bakery).

I shy away from pound cakes because the copious amounts of butter, sugar and eggs scare me, but this pound cake is the exception! It is very moist and has a great texture and taste. The sour cream not only adds richness without too much extra fat, but it also enhances the vanilla which I add in to give the cake more flavour. I reduce the sugar to one cup and to be honest, nobody can tell the difference! My dad says that this cake is professional quality and since it is so easy and delicious, I make it quite often! For a twist, I sometimes add in 1/2 cup of shredded toasted coconut and a 1/4 tsp of coconut extract for a change of pace!

Argh! Followed this recipe and used an 8x4 loaf pan as directed - I have spent nearly an hour cleaning the bottom of my oven from the batter that overflowed the pan and burned on the heating element. Will try the recipe again, but suggest using a 9x5 pan to avoid spillage.

PERFECT! Love it!

My changes were to double the recipe, cook it in 2 loaf pans and add 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla (Yeah it sounds like a lot, but it gives it a wonderful vanilla hint at the end of chewing a bite.)

For me, when I bake, if it's a sweet, vanilla goes in. Sometimes it's the barest splash, sometimes it's more like this recipe. I REALLY recommend trying to add a dash of vanilla to anything sweet you're baking- it REALLY makes the flavors pop.

This was very good, but I baked it in a bundt pan and I thought it turned out just a tad dry.  Next time I will bake it in a loaf pan.

I have high hopes for this pound cake, but it was too good to be true, for sure.  :(  Oh well.  This is the kind of recipe that burns on the outside before it is cooked on the inside.  The outside was almost black and the middle was still dough.  The edible parts were definitely tasty, but most of it was garbage.  Maybe cooking it longer at 350 might be better?  Disappointing.

Followed other bakers advice and cut sugar to 1 cup.  Freezes rather well.  Was glad I used tooth pick test.  Should not be pale in color, not lightly browned.  Going to try adding bourbon for flavoring.

My husband and I love this recipe, though we do add 2 tsp of cardamon, and a tsp of vanilla! Very tasty!  We've also discovered that you can use greek yogurt in place of the sour cream with the same great results!

I've had this cake for almost a week and it is still as moist as it was when I first pulled it out of the oven! The top is nice and crispy while the inside is soft. The only thing I would change about this recipe would be to cut the sugar. I found it a little too sweet for my taste.

I  had a tub of sour cream left over from a dinner party and didn't want to throw it away so I found this recipe.  I did make a few changes but only because I'm lazy and my little boy likes chocolate cake not plain cake so....  I used the same weight of olive oil instead of butter and mixed it all together without having to "cream" anything. Added the full 142ml sour cream and 25g cocoa powder, a sachet of baking powder and a couple of ounces of chocolate chips.  It was perfect and the whole family loved it - no one guessed that it had sour cream in it at all.  Thanks for posting!

I altered this recipe, following the guidance of other reviewers (reduced the sugar, added vanilla, soda and powder, and reduced cooking temp of 350 for 1 hour). I only added on t. vanilla and next time I'll double that... I think it would be VERY dull with the vanilla.

Pretty good, not as moist as I would like but here is the problem, it was New Years Eve, I just got back from the grocery store, and wasn't about to make a special trip back for butter. So, I used "butter-flavored" Crisco. It is always my back-up butter. This may have affected the moisture, who knows?   Plus, I made mine in mini-bundt cake pans, and set my temp for 325 and for 30 minutes, and I believed it was overbaked, so be forewarned. But, I added some chocolate glaze (which I've never had to add glaze to my pound cake before but felt the need to since it was overbaked), this helped compensate for being too dry.

The flavour was alright. A bit too sweet to my liking. My cake ended up really dense and almost rubbery. Perhaps I overworked the batter...will have to test it again.

Wonderful cake very easy. I doubled the recepie and it made a huge cake. I did add some vanilla, just dumped it in about 2 tsp. I just couldn't imagine cake without vanilla kept everything else ture to the recepie. My oven may be hotter than most. I used a Ceramic Bundt Cake Dish. The next time I will use 350 and maybe cook it a little longer the cake looks alot darker in the picture than it actually is. The texture is even and it is very moist. will be great under fruit or plain with coffee. I will make it many more times and have added it as a favorite. Thank you.

This was a great tasting cake.  I added a bit more sour cream than the recipe called for, and vanilla, and the taste was excellent.  The top was a bit burned after 1 hr in the oven, but that may be because I didn't use a loaf pan.  Next time- start watching closely at the 45 minute mark.

Terrific!  I have been looking for an easy pound cake recipe and I believe I have found it!!  My only change was I added two teaspoons of orange extract (I like orange) and decreased the sugar to one cup.  Very tasty!!  I will be making this cake again to serve to guests!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe! The only changes I would suggest is to bake the cake for about 50 minutes instead of an hour. Other than that this recipe is wonderful!

i tried this similar recipe from the joy of cooking.....it had 1/2c less sugar, 1/4 tsp baking powder, and 1/8 of baking soda, & tsp vanilla ex (temp was 325) ..... this was my 1st of ANY cake from scratch and i think it turned out well.  its just not the BEST pound cake i have had. AND I LOVE pound cake.  I poured a couple cupcakes and baked those so i could taste it without cutting the cake. I am going to try some other recipes and continue my BEST p. cake search.  I think this particular recipe would be good with a glaze or icing....or fruit and whipped cream.  it was velvety, not very sweet, and light....

I made this today for dessert. I added vanilla just like some of the other reviewers suggested. My husband fell on the floor when he tasted it. He said it was the best pound cake he has had in a long time. Will make again maybe use lemon extract next.

It's a pretty good pound cake. It's not as good as the last recipe I tried here but I couldn't find that one. I'm actually really bummed because I made this recipe for a MOPS breakfast tomorrow and it won't come out of the bundt pan. It's stuck fiercely, despite that I sprayed and floured it. I'm going to have to go buy a box of doughnuts in the morning for my MOPS group. I guess that's not the fault of the recipe, but I'm still giving this one 4 stars for it's near mediocrity and stick to the pan nature.

This was my first time baking a pound cake FROM SCRATCH (i.e... no box!!!) and this recipe came out very tasty. I read some of the other reviews and took some of their advice... I baked it at 350 degrees instead of 375 and I added some vanilla extract. It came out a little dark (2 much extract), but it was still yummy. Very moist!!! Yay!!!

So the flavor of this was excellent.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla, but that was my only change.  I'm young and  tend to only bake in cake pans or with cookie sheets, so while I thought I had an 8X4 loaf pan, I was wrong and halfway through baking I discovered my beautiful cake overflowing inside the oven.  So it may seem obvious to some people but this cake rises enough that if your batter fills your pan, the pan is too small!

A VERY sweet poundcake. I will be cutting the sugar in 1/2 next time. I, like many here, cooked it at 350 for 1 hr. 10 min. I also added about 2 teaspoons of lemon extract just because I like lemon. Would likely be great with either 2 tspns Vanilla or Almond extract too. Look forward to making this one again!

Good cake.  Everyone at the church liked it.  One thing, be sure to grease or spray the loaf pan & dust with flour or your cake may leave a corner behind.

I made this with the following modifications- lite sour cream and a good splash each of almond and vanilla extracts.    This is very delicious but I have to agree with others that it's slightly too sweet.  Next time I will add less sugar.  Thank you for the recipe, though Will- it's definitely one that I will use again and again.

Great little cake! I followed advice from others for lowering heat but mostly made it as is. I added lemon zest, lemon essence, white chocolate chips and yellow food colouring. I baked it in a silicone dish and then I also glazed it with a lemon glaze - Everyone keeps asking for more! My next twist will be oranges and bittersweet chocolate chips. YUM!

I made this and it was yummy however, I should have cut the sugar back as suggested. A little on the sweet side. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. I also added 1/2 stick more butter.

I made this in a 9x5 loaf pan (recipe says 8x4)and it came out perfectly. Lovely texture and rich flavor. Not as buttery as my usual recipe but perfect for the strawberry trifle I used it for. Definite keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This was really, really good. I cut back on the sugar a bit just for my family's personal taste. I didn't need a ton of ingredients and ended up with a delicious pound cake that was just the right size for our small family to consume within a few days. We topped slices with fresh blackberries and whipped cream. YUM!!

I must have done something wrong.when i was mixing the wet ingredients together they seem to stay separated instead of creaming together. maybe my loaf pan was too small cause even though the inside was done the texture was not right.looked too moist. i through it in the trash. it wasn't the recipe i think i just goofed. i will try again but use a tube pan giving the cake more room. i am sure then i will be able to give it a 5

Excellent flavor overall, texture is perfectly fine-grained and dense, just as it should be. I only used 1 cup sugar and added 1/8 tsp salt and 2 tsp good vanilla extract. I baked it in a 6 cup bundt cake pan and it raised over the top a good inch but didn't flow over, just scared me to death. I can imagine what it would have done in a 8x4 loaf pan with the additional sugar!

This is tasty and easy.  Although it is a little too light for a poundcake in my book; I would make it again as it was very good just lighter than traditional poundcake.
Iced it with White Chocolate Sour Cream frosting from this site- YUMMMY~!

Wow this is a really good  cake! I was looking for one that didn't use so many eggs, and this is wonderful. For those of you who thought it was dense, it is supposed to be dense..pound cake is! I doubled the recipe and baked in a bundt pan as some recommended, and it was wonderful. It rose to about level with the pan top, developed a beautiful rich golden crisp outer crust and tender inside. I worried as it took at least 75 minutes, and I covered the top that last 15 with foil to prevent excess browning.in fact I shut off the  convection oven and left it in there for another 15 minutes and then it was done perfect.   We had it with fresh picked strawberries and whipped cream! YUM. My husband LOVES it. Especially the crunchy outer crust!

I thought it was an great pound cake if it is going to be used as a base(ie.strawberry short cake). However, if u r looking for a pound cake to eat plan, it's not the best. It just needed more flavor. I used vanilla, but still no "pow". I will make again with strawberries.

Good and very simple recipe. I took the advice of some others regarding oven temp time and adding vanilla extract. (I had an oven temp of 350 and added 1 and a half tsp of real vanilla) I baked the cake for an hour making sure to check it at 50 mins. It turned out perfect! :o)

This is such an easy & quick cake to make!! My boyfriend jumped in the shower, and by the time he came out, it was already in the oven ready to surprise him. I did follow other reviews and used one cup of sugar,just two eggs, and a teaspoon of vanilla extract, but did something different myself. Instead of one cup of regular sour cream, I used a light sour cream and the result was a light, but yummy pound cake. There isn't much of a rise to the cake, but it still remains moist and soft on the inside. I baked it at 350degrees for about 55 minutes, periodically checking on it after 45 minutes to desired browning. Very good! Great alone, or with fresh fruit.

This cake was delicious. I used 2 eggs instead of 3 only because that was all I had.  It was phenomenal.  Next time I make it I will still only use 2 eggs. Oh- and added some vanilla extract.  I always add vanilla to my cookie/cake recipes.  If it calls for 1 Tbsp I put two, just a quirk about me.  Love the flavor it gives.

After reading all the reviews I decided
to make this pound cake. It did not rise alot, only cooked it 45 minutes and that was too long. It also had to many eggs in it for
the 1 1/2 cup of flour. I will try it again
with less sugar, 2 eggs, and some baking
powder.

This recipe was just OK.  I used a stoneware loaf pan, maybe that made the difference.  The cake tasted good, but the outside of it was too dark by the time the middle was done.  I probably will use one of my other pound cake recipes next time.

I made this cake this afternoon.  Without any regular flour in the pantry, I made the cake with self-rising flour and it worked just fine.  My 8 x 4 loaf dish is glass; therefore, I decreased the temp to 350.  Besides that, I did all the right things.  This is a really good down-to-earth cake.

I've made this MANY times now. So, so easy. I'm lazy and just dump all the ingredients in my mixer in one shot, mix it up and bake. I don't bother following the steps anymore.  This is a super yummy recipe and a great way to use up that sour cream nearing expiry in your fridge.

This was excellent.  Our favorite pound cakes have a wonderful crunchy crust and this one does not disappoint.  I added a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla extract.

I used the recipe given but I used cake flour  instead doubled   the ingredients, added vanilla flavor to use in bunt pan. I must say my first time baking it came out Ok , the only thing was it was an after floury taste that I didn't like.

The recipe as is is fine but there's definitely something missing. This really isn't a pound cake as much as it is a loaf cake, I was expecting a little bit more buttery flavor. That said, it comes out sweet, nice dense cake, not dry in the least, and if you pair it with strawberries it works- I made a strawberry sauce to go with it and it jazzed it up nice. But I can't give it more than three stars because of the disappointment in the flavoring otherwise. Maybe some vanilla would help?

I tweaked the recipe like ChitownCook suggested and it came out very moist, but a bit dense. Maybe because I added a little more sour cream. It's very good though and I will make it again!

It was okay. I used vanilla extract but it still came out too sweet. I'd recommend using 3 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon salt. It was just too sweet and not the good kind of sweet. It was sickly sweet.

Perfect! Doubled recipe for 2 loaves. Excellent crumb.  Added vanilla extract and baked at 350 for just over an hour as per other reviews.  This will now replace all of my other pound cake recipes.

Definitely a delicious pound cake.  All the reviews are right - the baking temperature is definitely listed too high. Reduced it down to 350 and it was done in about 50 minutes.  It's not as moist as I would have hoped but I would definitely make it again and just watch the mixing and baking time really carefully.  Added a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of vanilla and the zest of half a lemon.  Also reduced the sugar down to 1 cup and still found it really sweet.

This is a great recipe, the cake is super moist and buttery. The only change I made was decreasing the sugar to 1 cup and it turned out fine. My family loved it and now I'll be making this again and again!

This is a great recipe as is unchanged!  It is especially good when it is still warm from the oven.  One loaf gone in minutes at family dinners.  I am always asked for this recipe whenever I make it and bring it anywhere.

bleh...WAY too much sugar. I saw that people said to drop the sugar in the reviews but i didn't listen -.-. It tasted like cornmeal porrige (the rest of my family agreed) which isn't a bad thing, but i thought it would taste something like entenmann's cake or something bases on all the 5 start reviews.

I made this to use for strawberry shortcake and made no changes.  It is very good, however, I found that the edges/top got very dark before the inside cooked.  When the inside was cooked, the outside was almost burnt.  I'm not sure what that's all about.....

Holy salami, call my mommy! This is the best pound cake! After baking it according to the recipe out of respect for the baker, I began adding 1/2 tsp each vanilla and almond extract. Delicious! I have the recipe memorized now!

This has been one of my basic 'go to' recipes for the last twenty-five years. I have played around with it and whatever I do, it always turns out great. I have added a medium seedless orange, chopped, including peel, and I have split the pound cake in two horizontally and filled with cream cheese, and marmalade.

I have tried this recipe twice now and it seems a bit dry. I also decreased the temperature to 350 and took it out at only 50mins...edges were too brown for my taste and to dried up. Not sure what to do with this recipe to get it moist.

I was looking for a very dense, simple pound cake to carve a topsy turvy cake out of. This worked nicely, and is not too sweet. I added zest of 1 lemon which gave a nice flavor. I left out the pinch of baking soda to keep it a little denser.

I did lower the baking temp to only 350, and the cake was still nearly overdone after 1 hr.

I did NOT like this recipe. My mom use to cook sour cream pound cake and it was delicious. This one had this weird taste. The first time I cooked it, I thought I messed up so I re-did it. I even added a lemon glaze to it. The difference the second time is that I only could eat the part with the lemon glaze on it. Will NEVER use again.

This is excellent! I was looking for a pound cake recipie to make a wedding cake and this one is perfect! I made one small change to it. I used banana flavored yogurt instead of sour cream! I have not yet finished the cake (I just had to rave about it after I cut the top level and had a taste!) I am going to fill it with bananas and frosting.

This is a great recipe. Very easy to make and is moist and great for short cake. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and plan to experment with other flavores. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent poundcake.  This is very simple and easy, not too dry.  I enjoyed making it with different flavorings - lemon, almond, bourbon, etc for variety.

delicious! I made this for co-workers who were very happy. 4 stars only because I agree with a lot of reviewers - 375 i think is too hot. My cake started browning at 35mins and at 45 mins I thought it might be done but the middle was still very not cooked. I turned the temp down to 350 and let it cook through. It never burned and actually ended up with a lovely crisp top. Next time I will add lemon.

This is absolutely delicious! I made some changes however. I used a stick of Smart Balance buttery spread, 1 cup of light sour cream, and limited the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. I also lowered the heat to 325 during the last 25 minutes. I will definitely make again!

Phenomenal flavor! 
I did add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of butter flavor extract.
Will have to adjust the cooking temp/time a bit for my stove next time but I highly recommend this wonderful and simple recipe!

This is a great pound cake recipe.  However, I lowered the baking temp to 325 deg. and baked it exactly 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  It is the best pound cake I have ever eaten.

Baked in a star-shaped layer pan for my husband's birthday - cooking time is about half.  Start checking at about 30 minutes or when the FABULOUS AROMA fills your kitchen.  Like many, I also added vanilla.  Simple, superb, and my new favorite cake recipe!

This pound cake was great!  I'll tell you the changes I made.  I exchanged 3/4 cup yogurt (plain) for the sour cream, added 1 tbs vanilla to the batter, took 1/3 batter and added 1/3 cup melted chocolate morsels, added the white batter first to the pan and then the chocolate on top.  Lastlysprinkled corsely grained white sugar on top. Then baked at 350 for 1 hour 5 minutes!  Was beautiful!  This recipe is a great one to get creative with! 5 stars!

The recipe was delicious as is. But, with a few extra critiques , like for instance, I added some cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. i also added one whole lemon worth of zest, and two lemons of juice. And I served it with sugared strawberries, jam, and whipped cream, with a dash of caramel sauce. It was super delicious!

I have a 6 cup bundt pan that I have rarely been able to use.  This was a perfect fit.  I too added vanilla for one baking and vanilla and lemon for another.  It has been great each time.  I don't like using a hot oven for baked goods so I used 350 and watched it closely as the bundt takes less time than a loaf.

I really liked this.  It was simple and delicious!  It would be good with a berry topping, too.  I did add a teaspoon of almond extract and a teaspoon of vanilla extract, as a reviewer had suggested.  Also..I doubled the recipe and needed one cup of sour cream.  However, I only had 3/4...so I substituted with 1/4 cup plain (full fat) yogurt...and it was still delicious!

This pound cake was pretty good, but not as good as the cream cheese pound cake I've tried from this site. I needed a bigger cake than this was, so I doubled the recipe, and then baked it in my bundt cake pan. It rose VERY high, but did not go over. Once I turned it out of the pan to cool, the bottom squished down a little (not enough to get dense, just enough to look prettier!) and it was fine. Altogether, this is a good, tasty cake, but I prefer the taste of the cream cheese pound cake. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great basic cake recipe, but like a lot of fans here, I doubled the recipe to use a tube/Bundt pan instead of a loaf pan, added 1 1/2 t. vanilla extract, and used the eggs with Omega 3 added.  I also suggest the use of the sprays with flour/fat mixed together(like Baker's Joy), as they get the crevices in fancy designed Bundt pans very well(even if they're nonstick pans, they can stick!).

This was really just outstanding. Wonderful recipe. I did make sure the eggs and butter were at room temp. and also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract. A pinch on the baking soda was 1/8 tsp.   I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes and 350 for about 35. It was pretty brown on top so I gently covered it with a piece of foil mid way through.   Just delicious.

I made this cake this afternoon.  It was my first bundt style cake.  I doubled the recipe.  I did lower the oven temp to 340 and cooked it for 1 1/2 hr.  The cake has a good taste and is moist.  Will make it again because it is such an easy recipe. I'm cooking in a new oven, so I'll have to make it and figure out the perfect for doubling it.

This beats every pound cake I've had or made so far! Though I discovered when I re-read the recipe that I used double the butter called for. Not healthy, but very delicious!

This is a very easy dessert to make. I have made it a few times and I always have to bake it a lot longer to get the tooth pick to come out clean. This last time I made it the outside was pretty dark so I will decrease the temp a bit and add more time. Maybe that will work. We really like it the same day but is kind of dry on day 2. It's great with fresh strawberries & syrup.

This has an excellent taste to it.  It is a good jumping off place to play around with the taste of this cake.  I'm going to try changing the taste by trying different extracts in it.  I'm plannning on trying it also with the juice of 1/2 a lemon and some of the rind grated into the batter.  This is not only a delicious cake but an easy recipe to prepare.  One usually has all ingredients on hand.  A wonderful dessert to serve to guest.  This cake can be dressed up really fancy or served just plain with a nice cup of Earl Grey.

I used 2 eggs, one cup of sugar, 2 tsps. vanilla extract, 1/4 c milk, increased sour cream to one cup and sprinkled some red sugar  on top for Valentine's Day. Baked in 9 inch round pan at 350 for 50 minutes. The cake is nice and moist. Will definitely make this one again and add some blueberries.

Very good.  Came out better than expected.  Very fluffy and moist.  I used a thin sour cream frosting.  Didn't separate the eggs like others suggested, but still came out wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was a really good cake. The only change I made was to add 1t vanilla as many had suggested. Instead of baking in a loaf pan  I spread it in a jelly roll/  barpan and baked it.  Same temp. I just watched it cook until it looked done.  Then I sliced it into squares and served little layers of cake, mixed berries, sauce and whipped cream.  Yummy!

I doubled this recipe and baked it for 75 minutes at 350 degrees in a 10 inch tube pan dusted with confectioners sugar.  I also frosted it with the sour cream ganache and it turned out great!  I give it five stars!

I'm pretty sure it would have been fantastic without any alterations at all, but I did change a few things. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 c plus 2 T, increased sour cream to 3/4 c, added 2 t of vanilla extract and the kicker: about 1/8 t of ground ginger. The ginger gave it a really rich taste, combined with the sour cream. This is definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe although I used it as a base more than by following it exactly.  I sort of took all suggestions and variations and put them into one recipe.  I used about 10 T butter, 1 C sugar, 2 eggs, 2 whopping spoonfuls of sour cream, 1 1/2 C flour, 1/8 t soda, 1 T vanilla and I baked it at 350 for about 1 hour and 10-15 minutes.  I really love this...so easy and cheap!  Thanks!

Although this did rise, it just didn't taste good.  Based on other reviews, perhaps I did something wrong although I followed the directions without any change.

I made this recipe with 1c. sugar, 2 eggs, 1tsp vanilla and 1/8tsp soda. Baked @ 350F for one hour and it is perfect! I used two mini loaf pans, and both came out nicely brown outside...soft and moist inside. This recipe will be added to my list of regulars!

I doubled the amount called in the recipe for the bunt pan. It didn't turn out very well. It was done on the top but not on the bottom. I would recommend adding more butter and sour cream,cook at a lower temreture, and add a glaze. I will try theese things next time.

I doubled the butter by mistake, and WOW.  SO GOOD! I made 8 mini loafs (in a mini loaf pan) and baked at 350 for about 30 min.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and then divided the batter in half and added 1/2 tsp. of lemon extract to one half and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract to the other, so that 4 mini loafs were almond and 4 were lemon flavored.  Both were excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!

terrific basic recipe.  i took the others' advice: used 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp almond extracts.  i prefer very moist cake so i used 1/4c less flour and skipped the baking soda.  also, i baked it in a 8 in round pan at 350 degrees for closer to 45 minutes since the cake was much flatter than in a loaf pan.  and i used non-fat greek yogurt  instead of sour cream.   FANTASTIC!  thanks!

This recipe is very easy and the cake is delicious! As suggested by previous posts, I added vanilla (1.5 tsp) and it turned out great! I also lowered the cooking temp and baked for an hour. This cake is very moist and delicious. I also like that it's baked on a loaf pan so that we don't have lots of leftovers and waste. I highly recommend this one!!

I have to give this cake 4 stars even though I didn't like, everyone else did! My husband, kids and brother and his family loved it after Sunday dinner. I cut the sugar to 1 cup..the oven temp. to 350 degrees and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. It's a very light pound cake....it's an average cake to me.

This pound cake was delicious, quick and easy!!  Everyone liked it and wanted more.  I didn't have a loaf pan so I used to cake pans.  When they cooled I stacked them one on top of the other, I also used 3/4 cup butter.  It all worked out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!  And yes, when I cut the cake the two halfs stayed together. I was suprised about that.

SO GOOD and very forgiving recipe. I added vanilla, and being a chocoholic, subbed 1/4 cup of the flour for cocoa powder. I seem to be missing my loaf pan so I used an 8x8 square pan and it was perfect and done in 30 minutes at 350. Tender, moist, dense, and substantial at the same time. I sliced up some strawberries and sprayed some whipped cream on one piece - amazing - and ate one piece plain after that. Also amazing. Thanks -

I love pound cake and this is perfect! I have a small oven so it took 55 minutes to bake. I only added 1C. sugar (vs. 1 1/2) and it is the perfect sweetness for my taste. I also added 1tsp. vanilla. I added the eggs one at a time beating after each one. Added the flour and sour cream intermittently and baked at 350• Will definitely make again!

It came out really well. I added a teaspoon each of lemon and vanilla extracts because I had a lemon glaze that I wanted to put on it,  and it was really tasty.  The texture was perfect.  I was very pleased.

Very good classic pound cake! Easy and I like just using the 1 stick of butter it calls for. It makes a sweet, crusty loaf. I have also added vanilla and almond extract which is my favorite. Some readers have suggested using less sugar so I may tr y using a half cup less of that. Definitely my go to recipe.

I added some dried fruit to the recipe.  It turned out great.  I made it Sunday and it’s Wednesday...my family wants to know when I will make another one.

I substituted plain nonfat Greek yogurt for the sour cream and added vanilla. Reduced the heat to 350 and it was done in a coated nonstick pan within about 45 minutes. Really great crust on this- it got quite brown but did not taste burnt at all.

I've baked many pound cakes but this one is the most moist and tastes best. It is simple to make and only takes me ten minutes to prep. I add 1 tsp. of vanilla and a pinch of salt and lowered the temperature to 350 and bake a little longer so that it doesn't dry out.

Followed recipe to the tee. It ended up burnt. And still raw in the middle.

There was a good 1/4" of dark crust around the entire cake (top, bottom, and sides) that had an unpleasant burnt taste.

Such a shame. I do not recommend this recipe at all.

I followed the recipe exactly and OMG it's perfect. So quick to put together (one bowl). Long baking time and does get a bit dark on the edges but the texture of the inside is so soft and buttery. I've been looking for a recipe like this and the search is over!  
So easy to customize, adding chocolate chips on top is very good!

Good starting point but definitely needs vanilla &/or almond extract added for flavor. I doubled the recipe except cut sugar a little (used 2 2/3 cups instead of 3) and baked in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Still do tooth pick test for doneness as ovens vary.

This is not the recipe I will follow in the future for making a pound cake. While it did turn out yummy with some tweaks, the tweaks I'd need to list make it a different recipe, so don't bother with this one. Remember, it's called a pound cake because there should be a pound of each ingredient.

Simple, great, and easy! I added a few blueberries to mine.  Plus, I put it in a bundt pan.

I also put it in a mini loaf pan and divided it into 4 flavors. Raspberry dark chocolate, marble, maple walnut, and very vanilla.

Yummy! I made a few changes based on reviews, but I'll tweak it back a little when I make it again. I doubled the recipe to fill a bundt pan. I also used cake flour and added a teaspoon of vanilla and the zest and juice of one lemon and a dash of nutmeg. I also tossed in bit of baking powder, by accident (I read the baking soda wrong and didn't catch it until after I had added baking powder). I cut the sugar from 3 cups to 2. I separated the eggs and beat the whites until they were heavily frothy, then folded those in at the very last.   I started it in a cold oven and baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes.  Next time, I might add more vanilla, some lemon extract, and push the sugar back up to the original recipe. This was so tender and moist and light (probably thanks to the baking powder). This is a keeper and a great base for so many different ideas!

Doubled the recipe for bundt pan, cooked for 60 min at 350.
Ingredient-wise, used 2/3rd the sugar that it called for, added 1/8 tsp salt and 1/8tsp baking soda, plus 2.5 tsp vanilla and 1.5 tsp almond extract. Also added 2 tbsp boiling water after creaming the sugar and eggs. Moist and tasty

I took the suggestion and cut the sugar back, and did so to 1 cup, and added either a tsp of vanilla or almond extract.  The almond extract is my favorite with this recipe, I highly recommend.  My family loves this recipe, but it's devoured much faster when I add fresh or frozen fruit into the batter just before baking.  I've done peach mango, and one with a mixture of berries.  Came out perfectly moist when baked at 350.  Had to extend baking time.

Since I don't eat sugars or grains, I made a few changes to fit my diet.
I used almond flour (same amount), Pyure,  zero glycemic index sweetener (3/4 cup),  increased sour cream to 1.5 cups, added tsp each of orange, lemon, and almond extract (picked up from another reviewer), pinch of salt and baking soda.  I whipped the egg whites separately, (picked up that suggestion in an older review).  
Baked at 350 for 45 min, cake came out very moist,  I served it with blueberry sauce that I made the day before and whipped coconut cream (was out of heavy cream).  The cake absorbed the sauce so it was a nice, colorful,  addition, and the cream also added to the presentation and flavor.    Lastly, cake was easy to make, I love using ingredients on hand and it took less than 1.5 hours to make.  Would definitely make it again.

I read the reviews first (always a good idea) and baked mine at 350 (most cakes are baked at that temp) for 60-65 minutes.  I too added a little vanilla, a pinch of salt and a little almond extract.  I also cut the sugar just a little because this is going to be topped with grilled pineapple and ice cream and those are sweet enough (with a brown sugar glaze of course).  Next time I make this I will use a 9 x5 pan instead.  With the pinch of baking soda it did rise and I just think it would bake better with a slightly bigger pan.  Good recipe with a few tweaks!

Excellent base recipe.  I did read other reviews and took the suggestion of adding in some vanilla and lemon juice for flavor.  I added 1 egg at a time and then added the flour and sour cream alternatively and the cake came out perfectly (awesome texture).  This was great with the abundance of strawberries we have from our garden.

The only changes I made were to add a 1/2 t. salt and 2 t. vanilla.  I changed the prep steps to: cream the butter and sugar,  then add the dry ingredients alternately with the wet ingredients, ending with the dry.  The traditional way to make cakes.  I, too, only baked it for 45 min. to avoid it being dry.  It was very good.  Served it with sliced strawberries from my garden.  No whipped cream needed with this cake!

Oops! Made this taste-y cake for my Meals on Wheels patients. Read the reviews and followed some hints (thanks). it spilled over in my oven and collapsed in the middle. It was probably my fault--I used a ceramic pan (the correct size, though), and probably over-mixed as I used a stand mixer. I added 1/8 tsp of salt. It is a mess (as well as my oven!), but it is delicious! Now if I can cut it for my Meals on Wheels people...they won't care what it looks like!

I have made this pound cake several times and finally figured out how not to burn the top. I use a convection oven and for me about 45 to 50 minutes at 350° works perfect. Great recipe and taste. Thank You.

I put in the wrong pan, I used a bundt pan as normal pound cakes are usually. This cake doesn't rise enough for my liking. May tweak it with either self rising flour and a little more sour cream. Taste was just okay.

Very nice! Great pound cake that you can make quickly and with less eggs. I reduced the baking temp. To 350 as others suggested. I added maraschino cherries, a capful of vanilla and almond extracts, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. Yummy!

This is a very special pound cake!  Its an old-fashioned cake very much like that of my Great-Aunt's cake.   She used vanilla in her cake.  When I bake it, I always use half Splenda, half sugar to reduce the amount of sugar and enable everyone to have a small slice of this heavenly cake!  Its always received very well by all!

I needed something for my strawberry shortcake and was looking for an easy recipe. This worked out great! I had to bake it for a little over an hour, and when I pulled it out the top was cracked and gooey in the middle. I think I may have over mixed it a tad, but I'm a cook not a baker. The flavor was great, and it was nice and dense with a crunchy outside. I will be making this again soon!

This recipe is  "OFF THA CHAIN"(Pleasing to the taste buds) lol
I baked it late last night and it's gone early this morning! (we enjoyed ours hot and steamy) It was even better after it cooled completely. I would recommend this recipe to anyone! This cake was great very moist and flavorful I did add a tsp of vanilla and that was it!! Thank you for sharing!

large pound recipes. I have probably made 4 or 5 times.

I made this into mini loaves to use as the shortcake with strawberries...it was a hit!  I took the advice of another review and cut the sugar down to about a cup, knowing the strawberries would be sweet as well.   I think it was still a little sweet, but it went over well!  (I added mini choc. chips to some of it, for those who wouldn't want strawberries.)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is so good it should be against the law to make !!!!
I took advice from another review and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of banana extract .. The outcome was incredible!!!
The cake was so moist and the flavor was out of the ballpark!!!!
The flavor was like having a moist  delicious madeleines ...
Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

I like others doubled the recipe, except for the sugar, so that it could be baked in a 9 or 10 inch tube pan or bundt pan. I thought with these minor adjustments it was a great cake. Used it at the church fundraiser this year.

I opted to bake mine at 350 as many others suggested (for about 55 minutes) and also added 2t vanilla extract and 1/2t lemon extract, and cut sugar down to a little over a cup.  The only thing that I chose to do a littlw differently than others, was to use Organic Coconut Palm Sugar vs. regular white sugar.  This made for an interesting difference...made the loaf darker in color.

I made the recipe as written except I baked my cake in a deep 8 inch round cake pan. It only took about 40 minutes to cook. Next time I will bake it at 350. The bottom got just a little more brown than I like. I don't recall ever making a cake without flavoring. Since I often make shortbread without flavoring I tried it. It's perfectly delicious. It has a somewhat "natural", for lack of better term, quality to it without the flavoring. The texture was spot on, dense yet fluffy still. This is the perfect cake to serve with strawberries. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It doesn't make enough batter for it to bake without burning for an hour as recepie calls. Do not  bake for the whole hour...probably 30 min. Or double the recepie. Overall texture and taste were nice except for overcooked shell (icing helped) but I added vanilla and lemon extracts.

This cake was so tender and moist. I followed another user's suggestion and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a little extra sour cream.  It was excellent. Great flavor and not heavy or dense.

Only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Cake was easy to make and ingredients were things I always keep around. Tasted great on the second day. Thing to remember with pound cakes is that the flavor "ripens" with time and they will always taste better after 24 hours.

Very good. Wish I would have stuck with the full amount of sugar, instead of reducing like some suggested. Baked in a convection at 325 for around an hour.

I used this for cupcakes instead of a cake because I didn't have a loaf pan.  Thus I reduced the temperature to 350 and the bake time to 30 minutes--very nice!  No crust on top, but there was on the sides, and I'm willing to live with that.  I think had I cooked them longer I would have dried them out so i guess for cupcakes, you can't have a crust.  Great basic recipe, 4 stars because I made adjustments to the ingredients.  I decreased the sugar to one cup, added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and next time will add lemon zest and lemon juice to add character.

Mine came out more like Biscotti than a Pound Cake.  It barely rised at all and was a little overdone on the outside. Maybe my stoneware bundt pan was too big, maybe I overcooked a little, I'm not sure.  I baked at 350 for an hour and it seemed a little overdone and a bit bland.  I am going to try out a different recipe next time to test it out, thank you for the inspiration.

I am a dessert junkie especially anything chocolate. I made this looking for something other than my daily chocolate fix. Wow this was great. Everyone that tried it said it was the best pound cake they ever had! Made two additions based on other reviews added lemon juice and vanilla. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious cake and easy to make!!
I made the following changes- 3/4 cup sugar and added 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  Don't overmix and add eggs and butter at room temp.  Baked at 350 degrees for just under one hour till beautiful golden brown.  I will be making it often!

Super easy and delicious. So yummy my husband gave most of it away so that he wouldn't eat it all (he's always watching his boyish figure). I will definitely be making this often, next time I think I'll double the recipe and maybe do a light glaze even though it really didn't need it.

Easy, easy, easy! I tried this last week and it was a big hit. Today I doubled the recipe and made one bundt style and one loaf. Bundt is for company and loaf is for the husband.  The bread is wonderful but even more wonderful after a day or so of resting. It gets more dense.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and about a half a cup of dried cranberries.  Tasted delicious, but the exterior was a bit overdone.  Next time, I'll reduce the temp to 350 and cook it a bit longer.  Still, a great pound cake, with lots of potential for additions to the basic recipe.

Delicious, easy & and worth the wait!  Got me thinking why do we buy pound cake in the store when it is so easy and yummy to make fresh?

This was my first non-chocolate gluten-free cake to work out! I'm not sure how it tasks as a pound cake since it's been a while since I've tasted it, but I thought and was told (by non-gluten free people) that it was really good.  I made the suggested changes for doubling the recipe: 1/4 tsp salt, vanillla, a little extra sour cream, and a little less sugar (to tell the truth, I actually ran out of sugar).  Doubled, this recipe made a full tube pan.  I baked it at 350 F for about 75 min.  I topped it with a premade pecan-coconut icing - which I don't recommend.  Maybe I'll make some brown sugar sauce next time! Thank you for the recipe! I'm sure I'll be making this often!

My family thought this was really tasty. This was very easy to put together. I did add some vanilla butternut flavoring to give it a little flavor boost. I served it w/ ice cream and hot fudge sauce. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

Pretty good.  I used the following suggestions, the recipe was doubled however but only 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and added vanilla.

I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars because I thought it was a little eggy tasting, and more dense than I'm used to, but still very yummy. I've never had pound cake from scratch, so maybe it's supposed to be this way? I doubled for two loaves, but cut the sugar back. I also added 2tsp vanilla, and 1.5tsp almond extract. This tasted great hot, cold, and served in place of shortcake for strawberry shortcake with whipped cream.

Beautiful. I baked it in two layers and filled it with strawberries mixed with sugar and a dash of lemon juice. I frosted it with the delicious sour cream frosting from Margaret Wheling's Sour Cream Banana Cake. I would note that I also added tsp of vanilla, and I think 1/2 would have been better.

This was my first time making a sour cream pound cake and all I have to say is wow! It is moist and delicious and I have gotten great compliments on the taste! The only things I did differently were using cake flour instead of regular all-purpose, using fresh from the farm brown chicken eggs, and adding a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla flavoring. This was very easy to do and I will recommend this recipe to everyone!

I doubled this recipe and baked it in a bundt pan.  I added some vanilla extract and a smaller amount of almond (did not measure either).  I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for an hour and 10 minutes.  I took the "pinch" to be 1/8 tsp so I used 1/4 tsp baking soda.  I either used too much or my pan was too small b/c this cake rose quite a bit - it actually hit the top of my oven and burned on some parts!  I also used a heaping cup of sour cream b/c other reviewers said their cakes were dry.  Other than the cake rising more than I expected, this was delicious.  It tastes great alone and even better with a cup of coffee.  The crust is delicious as well, kind of crunchy and sweet.  My husband wished the whole surface was the crust.  I will def make this again!

This was a really easy recipe!  I liked that it didn't require as much butter as other recipes.  I tweaked it by adding the zest of one lemon and juice of half a lemon.  I would definitely try this again!

My very first pound cake and it turned out beautifully. Dense, moist, flavorful with a wonderful crust. The texture and crust was exactly like the pound cakes served at church when I was a young girl, made by women who had been cooking for decades. We had it plain and with strawberries and whipped cream after dinner and it was practically inhaled by the family. Just one thing. Plain, with coffee it was, to me, perfect. But with  with the strawberries and cream  I thought it was just a bit too sweet. However,everyone else in the family thought it was just right. So I think the sugar should be adjusted to what kind of sweet fiend you are. Wonderful recipe. Breeze to make. A definite keeper.

I followed the advice of others and added 1 tsp. vanilla and a heaping 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I baked at 350 for 45 minutes, and half of the bread was done, but the other half was still gooey, so I baked it for 15 more minutes.  It was finally done and tasted great, but it turned out very dry!  Does anyone have a suggestion to make it more moist?  Maybe do 1 cup sour cream instead of 1/2 cup?

I made this cake today when I got home from school. I thought it was an okay cake. It had a nice flavor just a little bland compared to a typical pound cake. I had to add some vanilla and cinnamon. Its just a personal preference, i guess. Even so, I would still propably make this again because my mom liked it.

This was just okay.  It will probably be better tomorrow.  I cut back the sugar to 1c and glad I did.  I also added some lemon extract and baked at 350 per other reviewers.  The outside was still over-cooked before the inside was done, and the flavor was mediocre.  I have better pound cake recipes.  Thanks anyway.

I used a silicone 9x6" baking dish.  I also used self-rising flour for the flour.  I followed some of the other suggestions and added 1 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, & heaping 1/2 c. sour cream.  Baked at 350* F for 55 min.  It came out perfect!  It was my first try at pound cake and I was very impressed. VERY MOIST & DELICIOUS.  We just ate it as is, no need for fruit or whipped topping (although that would make it extra yummy)

Awesome cake! Even my fussy two-year old liked it! Like other reviewers, I added vanilla and extra sour cream, and baked it at a lower temp (350 deg F) for a longer time. Already a family favorite.

Exactly what I was looking for to serve with strawberries and cream.  

Like others I reduced the temp to 350F and reduced baking time a bit.  I also used 3/4 butter, and a splash of vanilla.  Next time, I'll try some almond extract with it too!

I TRIED THIS OUT AND ENJOYED IT ALOT, ALTHOUGH THE COOKING TIME MADE IT A LITTLE CRISPY AROUND THE EDGE.  I WILL DEFINITELY TRY RHIS AGAIN, I PUT SOUR CREAM ICING ON MINE, AND MY FAMILY LOVED IT.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

My new neighbor gave this recipe to me and we made one at her house and loved it.  I liked it so well that I made one for a cook-out I went to the following week.  Everyone was raving over this cake.  It's a must try.
