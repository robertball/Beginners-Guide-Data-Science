Thirty years ago we moved to Texas from Louisville.  No one here had ever heard of Benedictine...a Louisville staple!  I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit at parties.  Thanks for sharing!!

made with fresh dill, regular  (large) cucumbers and scooped out the seeds.  First time trying benedictine and I'm now addicted.

I will admit that I've never had Benedictine  spread before, so I could be that the recipe is fine but I don't like Benedictine spread.  My family and I didn't care for the almost grainy texture of the cucumber in the spread.

Grew up in Louisville and my Mother made this often. She always used a box grater but this is easier. Great!

Needed to use up some cucumbers and all I had was cottage cheese. Followed the recipe and used cottage cheese instead of cream cheese--it turned out really tasty. I will definitely use it on crackers and with carrots. I'm sure the consistency would be better with cream cheese, but it tastes really good.

This was the best Benedictine I have made, the wife absolutely  loved it.  It was as good as what is served in the Derby Caf√© at Churchill Downs. Highly recommended.

This was really good. Next time I might whip the cream cheese for a smoother consistency.
