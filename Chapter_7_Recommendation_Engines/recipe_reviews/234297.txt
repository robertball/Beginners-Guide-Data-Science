This is an awesome recipe! I have made this several times, and have tried a few different things to suit this to my taste. You can add curry for a little more spice, if you'd like, but it is wonderful on its own. I have learned you definitely need to use all natural peanut butter, it makes a huge difference to the taste. Also, I use the crunchy kind, so no need to add peanuts! I'm going to try this in a wrap with chicken and veggies and I know it will be superb!

I have recently stopped eating gluten, dairy or cane sugar.  So I was thrilled to run across this recipe. It barely needed any substitutions to accommodate my new diet. I used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar and will need to find a replacement for the siracha sauce since it has sugar. Even with my changes it was AMAZING! My whole family loved it. I served the sauce with chicken satay (from this site),  rice noodles and green beans.  I also topped with cilantro and diced green peppers  as recemended . I would have added some some peanuts but did not have any, I am sure that would make it even better.  I used the sauce to flavor everything on my plate. Having this sauce made up ahead of time would really make for a quick meal after work.  I would give this more than five stars if I could. Also..... The recipes calls for a very small can of coconut milk (5.6 oz),  but I I used about 1/2 a standard can and it worked perfect. I will be adding this to one of my favorite all time recipes. Thanks!!

This sauce was EXCELLENT!  So very tasty....the flavors blended so well together so it didn't just taste like peanut butter.  The sesame oil and fresh lime juice are a MUST. Paired with spring rolls, it was quite the treat for my co-workers when I brought in as a surprise.

Really good with bacon-wrapped scallops.  We left out the fish sauce, and will double the garlic and Sriracha  We may use less coconut milk to make it thicker.  We added chopped red and bell pepper, and the fresh cilantro as a garnish.  We will definitely make it often.

This was excellent. You have to be flexible with this recipe. The peanut butter I use is the freshly ground type in the natural foods department, so I dumped all of the ingredients in the blender and gave that a whirl. It was a little salty and a little thick for my taste buds, so added more peanut butter, more coconut milk, more heat, and more sesame until it worked just right for us. I used this with Chef John's Thai tri-tip, and have enough left over to use with a couple of chicken kabobs.

Excellent balance of flavors, though we like it a bit spicier and tangier, and hence used about 3x  sriracha and some  rice vinegar.   Served it with crudités for a healthy snack.

I made this twice, once as written and once with garlic chili sauce instead of siracha.  Both sauces were good, but not great and the flavors of both spices were a little different for me.  I prefer my heat via crushed red pepper flakes.   I also used about 1/2 a can of coconut milk to achieve my desired thickness.

Just made this sauce and it was delicious. I added more soy sauce and chili garlic sauce because I like the sweetness to be cut more by the spiciness of chili garlic sauce. By the way, I made this sauce to go with Chef John's Beef Satay recipe, which was also excellent!

Great recipe! I didn't have fish oil or sesame oil, just just used about 1 tbsp of vegetable oil.  I eye balled all the the ingredients since I've made a similar one before.  THANKS for this!  (oh, I used it as a drizzle over chicken & noodles)

I made this sauce to go with Vietnamese meatballs for a dinner that we were hosting. It was a HUGE success - even the two 3 year olds loved it! I didn't cook the sauce so I added a little warm water to the regular 1% milk I used to thin it out (I didn't have any coconut milk). Also, I didn't add the red peppers or the chopped peanuts. Our guests raved over the sauce saying that it was the best they have ever had. Definitely give it 5 stars... more if I could.

I thought this was bland. I had to add more sri racha,  soy sauce, and brown sugar. Next time I'll try using just half a cup of peanut butter to the same other ingredients, so there's less of it.

Really delicious! I was worried it would be too "nutty" but the liquids in the recipe off set it quite nicely. I was forced to substitute some ingredients, starting with low sodium / low fat peanut butter. Lemon Juice instead of the lime, oyster sauce instead of fish, and a 2:1 coconut cream to normal milk mix . Despite, or maybe because of (?) these changes it was was superb as a dip for some garlic chicken wings.

Marinating my beef now. I made the peanut sauce and did not see to use a 5.6 oz can of coconut milk until I used a full 13.5 oz one (Ampawa is the best.).  I checked with my large chain grocery store.  They don't sell one and I frequent my Asian grocery and besides having 8 or 9 brands to choose, I don't remember seeing one that small.

Perfect to go with the beef satay! Just beware on the amount of coconut milk, that is not a normal size can.

What I did was made it into more of a Thai peanut sauce (I added a LOT more spice to mine and a little more sesame and fish oils).  Then I drizzled it and a raspberry jam reduction over some chicken wings and OH MY WORD it was so delicious!

This peanut dipping sauce rocks! I doubled the recipe so we were able to dip our Satay skewers as well as pour of the fried rice I'd made.  Everyone loved it.  It was simple and quick.  I had made it the night before so it had thickened quite a bit.  Since it was so quick to make I would recommend making it the day of instead. I had to adjust a lot to get it back to the smooth consistency it was the night before.  It still tasted awesome but it was a last minute problem I wouldn't have had if I'd done it the day of serving.

I made this to go with fresh spring rolls that I made for the first time.  I didn't use all the coconut milk because I wanted a 
thicker sauce.  Very good and close to what I get at my favorite Vietnamese place.

very smooth and creamy. I didn't have bell peppers though, but I added freshly grated ginger, and it was really good. I also used Bragg's aminos instead of soy sauce as a healthier alternative, and as usually, I skipped salt. Turned out awesome!

Had a craving for a good beef and chicken satay with an awesome peanut sauce....I came across Chef John's recipes and made them both.  Awesome and easy recipes, love the videos (to follow along so I didn't screw it up), loved the 'this is  a base for you to add more sweet or salt' to the peanut sauce.  I added some additional soy sauce and it is PERFECT!

I have made 5 or 6 times and my family loves this recipe. My favorite Thai restaurant  serves chopped raw, red cabbage drizzled with a delicious peanut sauce. Now, I can make this very simple salad at home. I will use this sauce with other dishes in the future. 
I use 4 tsp. Garlic Chili Sauce vs. the recipe's 2 tsp.; the lime juice is a must ingredient.

This tastes just like the dipping sauce in thai restaurants. I used Trader Joe's smooth peanut butter and the sauce was too thick when following the recipe as it is (almost like nutella consistency) I gradually added warm coconut milk and by the time it was restaurant consistency, I had used an entire 13.50z can of coconut milk. I added more chilli for the heat and some fish sauce and soy sauce to balance flavors. I was very pleased with the results, so was everyone else who tasted it. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best recipe I've tried so far. I made the original recipe and then added more soy sauce, sugar and Siracha sauce to taste for a deeper flavor.

good!  I had a similar experience in having guests ask for more spring rolls, just so they could snag more of the sauce.  Because of a guest's sensitivity to peanuts, I used cashew butter this time instead.  Wow.  Even better.  Thank you so much for this recipe.
