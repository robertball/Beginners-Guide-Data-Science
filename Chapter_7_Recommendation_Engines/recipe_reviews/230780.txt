Tried this recipe and it turned out amazing! So moist and so incredibly wonderful! I was a bit hesitant to cook this in a crock pot, but the ease of it surprised me. My dessert was cooking while I was making dinner and it wasn't taking up my regular cooking space! I would definitely make this again and shared the recipe with friends tonight on facebook! The picture I posted is of it still cooking :) the finished product looks much different :)

I tried this the other night, and it turned out OK. But it was still very soupy after 1.5 hours on high, and the almond extract tends to overpower the peanut butter flavor. If I try it again, I'll use a little less than the 2 cups of boiling water and only 1/2 tsp of almond extract at most.

This was really good!  I was surprised that the cake was so moist and made such a chocolatey pudding.  Perfect for an easy dessert on a cold night!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was excellent.  Lots of sauce in the bottom, nice cake-y top and good flavour throughout.  I would make this again in a heartbeat exactly the way it's written with no changes whatsoever.  I used a 2.5 Qt crockpot.

The recipe does not indicate what size of slow cooker to use.  I'm sure people know not to use the itty bitty 1 quart ones, but 'standard' slow cookers can range from 2 quart to 6 quart, which will dramatically alter the density and therefore the results.  I'm going to try it with my 5 quart cooker tonight and we'll see what happens. :)

Our oven died and I had to make cake for my husband's birthday.  This recipe saved the day.  It was delish.  I didn't think it was soupy at all.

This was quite good, I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. It's called pudding cake so I expected it would have some degree of gooeyness...Mine was like cake around the outside edges and runny/gooey in the middle. I can see how cooking it longer or decreasing the water may be a good idea for some people as mine was more pudding than cake - but still very tasty! It would've been amazing if I'd had any ice cream to go with it!

Easy, simple recipe that tastes great. Looks pretty ugly going into the slow cooker, but have faith...looks at the front end change into a great dessert. The only thing I would add is a layer of mini-marshmallows next time, placing them atop the already-cooking masterpiece about a half hour before it's done. Another gooey, flavor to add to the pudding cake! Tastes fantastic!

A little dry and not as rich as I hoped. Not difficult to prepare, however, and the convenience of the slow cooker is wonderful. Will try again but not quite sure how to moisten up. Maybe poke some holes in it before pouring the chocolate mixture to allow it to seep in. Good luck!

Based on other reviews, I decreased the water to 1 1/2 cup and it took about 1 hour, 45 minutes for the cake to begin to pull away and feel firm.  The cake was still plenty moist, though I wonder if there would have been more chocolatey, gooey goodness in the bottom if I used the full 2 cups of water.  I topped the cake with vanilla ice cream which really added to the dessert!

I tried this dessert for our Valentine's Day dessert. I think the amount of water was fine. It didn't come out soupy. We didn't think it tasted that good, especially compared to the other desserts on the site. It was edible and didn't taste as good as it sounded. Wouldn't make it again.

We tried this tonight.  It was very good.  I am in agreement that I would add less almond extract and less water.  Everyone enjoyed the taste and flavor.

We substituted sour cream with plain Greek yogurt and almond extract with vanilla extract! We ate it with little banana and plan to add ice cream for the next serving! Came out as pictured; a little moist in the center but not overly so; overall happy with the recipe and met my prego craving!

I used Mexican vanilla extract instead of almond. I doubled it and used my larger crock pot but I think I could've used my medium size so there would be more yummy gooey sauce. It was still a hit with my guests,though,and what little I had left over reheated wonderfully!

Made recipe as is, texture for me was mushy. I've never had pudding cake so I'm not used to the texture. The flavors tasted good, I even had vanilla bean ice cream on the side. The combination of the ice cream did make this dish more tasteful. However,  I would not make this dish again because of the mushy texture.

Surprised how well the cake turned out, but tasted no peanut butter and the chocolate was over powering. I was expecting a Reese cup flavor, but was disappointed.

At first I didn't like it , but now I realize my crock pot cooks to hot while on a low setting.  It was too dry.  The next day I heated it up with milk in the bowl to give it one more try before pitching it. Wow, what a difference. The "pudding" quality was there and now I taste how it is support to be.

Family  enjoyed it but thought the almond flavour over powered the peanut butter. Would make it again but reduce the almond extract by half or omit.

I found this recipe on the menu spinner. This was so easy and I already had most ingredients on hand. I was out of sour cream so I substituted buttermilk in slightly less volume than was required of the sour cream. Everything turned out perfectly. It makes its own chocolate sauce on the bottom similar to my chocolate cobbler recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

I messed up the last step; basically mixing all together and it still turned out! It needs the chocolate sauce to appear fancy (And I sprinkled powdered sugar on top, as well). The 1 1/2 hr. cook time is exactly right -- it can scorch if you go over that time. Happy that the cooking spray kept it easy to remove/clean after.

If I tried this again, I would omit the almond extract.  It overpowered the blend of chocolate and peanut butter flavors and was not appealing.

We enjoyed this very moist cake. I used chunky peanut butter and the added crunch was nice.  I will add some chocolate chips next time just to see how that will work.
