My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. The rice complimented the chicken very well and the asparagus gave it a fun flavor. I do not believe that I would change anything about this recipes.

This is excellent.  It has a lot of flavor and the chicken turns out very juicy.  I fixed extra asparagus for a side dish along with the rice, the whole meal is visually striking and delish.  I will decrease the chicken broth to 1 3/4 cup instead of 2cups the next time I make it as it took around 35 minutes for the extra liquid to boil off.  I used brown rice (I always use brown rice, much more fiber!).  Otherwise I followed the directions to a tee and it was great.

This was amazing. The chicken was fabulous, especially with that little crunch the asparagus gave it. And the rice was to die for...I couldn't get enough!!

I did not stuff the ingredients, instead I amended this recipe by placing the chicken flat at the bottom and adding the ham, asparagus mixture and cheddar on top. Tastes great, although I would use parmesan cheese next time, as I prefer the taste.

I would definently brown the chicken first just to improve the appearance. Perhaps some cheese melted on top would also enhance the appearance.
But everyone raved about it.

This recipe was outstanding, my two girls and my wife all voted it 5 stars.  Be sure to stuff the chicken as full as possible, the asparagus gives it great flavor, and account for the water in the canned tomatoes.

The whole family loved this recipe. I ended up turning the broiler on in the last few minutes of cooking to brown up the chicken just a little more. But the chicken was tender and juicy and the ham and cheese adds fullness and demention.

I tweaked a couple of things to use some ingredients I had at the house. I sauteed some diced fresh mushrooms with the asparagus (for the filling). I used colby-jack cheese because that is what I had on hand, used brown and wild rice instead of white, and mixed the remainder of my asparagus (chopped) and fresh diced tomatoes into my rice for the last 3 minutes of cook time. Obviously several tweaks, but with spectacular results! I'm giving 4 stars because it will need a little seasoning on top the next go around. I will be making this again!

My family really enjoyed this meal. The chicken was delicious. I added a bit of chedder cheese on top of the chicken when i baked it just to make it look a bit more appealing to the eye.

This was really good. It looked so pretty when it came out of the oven. The BF was impressed. Will make again for sure. I had some asparagus I didn't use so I warmed it up and put an alfredo sauce over it. Yummy!!

I think if I made this again - I'd opt for broccolini or green beans.  I would also double the cheese.

This was really good! I just had plain canned tomatoes so I added onions and celery cooked in the butter for a couple of minutes. I also used vegetable broth in the rice. Will make again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted the asparagus with fresh broccoli because I loved this idea but never cared much for asparagus. Everything else I kept the same and it was super delicious!  My finicky teenagers loved it and told me it looked like a "real chef" prepared it. Other than the sarcastic remark, it was a big hit at my dinner table. Five stars!

I loved this recipe! I substituted fresh green beans for asparagus, sauteed it with minced garlic and celery and some steak seasoning for extra spice. For the rice I threw everything in my rice cooker and it turned out perfect! This was so delicious and easy I will definitely be using this again.

The chicken was fabulous.  Of my four kids, only the 6 year old wouldn't touch it (typical).  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese to the rice, but it was good without it.  I'll have to remember to add it next time to compare.

This dish was great! I didn't have any cheddar so I used provolone instead and really enjoyed the flavor. I also sauteed the asparagus with fresh garlic and shallots. Really wonderful.

Fantastic recipe. My wife could not stop smiling? I would make one change, instead of canned tomatoes I would recommend using fire roasted tomatoes. It only takes about an hour to fire roast them yourself (which you can do while you are prepping the other food), and the flavor is so much more distinct.
