REVISED REVEIW 

Go Saints! Yes I'm from Nawlins myself and this is a good recipe except this way too much roux.That's the amount I use to cook a gumbo for 8-10 people!Try 1/4 that amount and brown it to a light tan color or even darker. Otherwise the end result will be way too floury and thick.  I like to used chopped fresh tomatoes, especially in summer. I also add a little dry white wine. If you don't use Cajun seasonings add salt, black and red pepper to taste.PLUS chopped fresh basil and 1/2-1 tsp thymne. Adjust seasonings to taste after the ingredients have a chance to marry. Put your favorite Cajun Hot Sauce on the table.

Wow!  Sooooooo yummy! I didn't have 3 pounds of shrimp so I added some chicken breast also... It made so much we ate it all week!  And believe me, it was so good I didn't mind one bit ;)  I will make this a regular meal.

I love to look for different recipes and this was a big hit, even the leftovers. I substituted cajun seasoning for the salt and chili powder and used only half the tomato paste. I had so much sauce that I refrigerated half of it and made a chicken, sausage and okra gumbo with it a few days later. Just as tasty.

I cut the oil and floup in half.  I used two pounds of shrimp and I thought that was plenty.  I would add the chili powder and some spice while it is cooking instead of at the end.  Overall I liked this recipe and will make it again.

Great recipe.  I used it for a Mardi Gras celebration at church and it was a hit.  Served 80-90 people.  Very easy and fun to make.

this really is excellent!!!  i also cut down the roux to about half.  i think it makes a lot more than 6 servings though.  my husband and i have been enjoying for the past 2 nights, each night having seconds and there's still more for tonight!  will be making this quite often.

Very Easy and Good! I like to use a mix of chicken, sausage and shrimp. I always add a pinch or two of sugar to the sauce. It's a nice balance with the spice. Everyone I have ever served this to loved it!

I have made this recipe several times and everytime it comes out, well, excellent!  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  The last few times I've made it the only changes I've made are I use beef broth instead of water, creole seasoning instead of just chili powder and hot sauce (this way I get the flavor without the heat), and I add the seasonings while it cooks instead of at the end.  I've never had a problem with it being too thick or floury/pasty tasting.  If it's too thick simply add more water or whatever liquid you're using.  If you're getting a pasty taste, it could be either your roux is not smooth or it may not be cooked long enough - I do cook the roux slightly longer than stated to ensure the flour taste is cooked out.  At the end where it says to slow cook I turn the heat down to low to medium low with the lid on and stir occasionally.  Never had a bad batch.  It's great over white or brown rice or pasta.  And it does make a ton of servings - way more than 6.  I usually freeze the extra portions for later as it does freeze very well and the flavors develop even more.

I took the advice of Johhny Y, and it was perfect!!  I truly truly loved it!! So did my husband! I think seasoning it while its cooking versus at the end makes a tremendous difference.  It was awesome and it looked like it came out of someone's restaurant:)

This recipe was good.  I had to decrease the ingredients by half.  Quick and easy to prepare, toasted garlic french roll compliments this recipe well.  Served over white rice, will try pasta the next time around.

I had lost my receipe for this dish and had been searching all over for one that would come close. I could not have come closer with this one. It IS the best one around. Only thing that I do different is I add scallops to the dish.

Very good!!  I added less water because we are trying not to eat any carbs (no rice) and I wanted it to be extra thick.  I also added some cooked chicken breast, for the kids.  Turned out wonderful and very easy to make.

I made this for someone else...as I absolutely detest seafood...BUT this person LOVED it! I used melted butter for the roux instead of oil, figured it would make it more flavorful. Used 2 kinds of pepper, paprika and tobasco sauce (my friend likes it HOT), didn't have any celery. Had to use lots of water in order for it to not come out pasty. Used frozen shrimp, worked out nicely. I cooked them a bit in some olive oil and garlic paste before transferring them to the main pot. Makes a LOT of stuff!

First, I found that it was a huge amount of roux so the liquids needed to be increased dramatically.  I added a can of tomato sauce, a bit of sugar and probably about 4 cups of shrimp stock I had in the freezer.  I didn't use the rotel tomatoes because I have small kids who don't appreciate spicy stuff so I added basil and thyme along with a can of whole tomatoes (squished).  But cayenne to taste at the table is the remedy.

One thing I like to do with the shrimp shells and leftover veggie scraps (onion skin, garlic skin, bell pepper ends, etc) is to throw them all in a stock pot with water and cook to make the above shrimp stock.  Salt to taste or else it tastes like dishwater.

This tasted like tomato-flavored wallpaper paste, and I followed the recipe to a "T".  It was so thick, I couldn't let it cook without stirring constantly.  It would probably have been great if there wasn't so much flour in it.
