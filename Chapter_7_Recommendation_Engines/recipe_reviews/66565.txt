I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, threw in a half cup or so of halved cherry tomatoes, used leftover "mexican" shredded chicken instead of canned and homemade dry ranch dressing mix. Between the three of us (my two boys and I), we made quick work of this macaroni salad. NO leftovers.

I can not get enough of this salad!!  I did make a few changes...I omitted the chicken since I was preparing this to accompany cheeseburgers and hot dogs.  I made the directions to serve 16 so the recipe asked for 4 packages of ranch mix.  This made me a little nervous so I added only two at first.  I changed the green olives to sliced black olives and added sliced carrots.  I made the salad the night before and when I checked it in the morning the dressing was slightly thick and I thought it could handle one more package of ranch.  I whisked the ranch into 1/2 of milk and this did the trick.  Everyone at the BBQ loved it and there was enough for leftovers which made me happy!!  I will make this again with my changes as well as main dish and add the chicken (not canned though) to see how it is that way.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

UUUMMMM!!!  That was probably the best variation of macaroni salad I have tried.  I excluded the chicken because I was serving it with a meal and didn't think I needed it but it would be a great meal on its own with the chicken.  Definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though.  I had to test when it was first made and have to say I was not impressed, but once it sat, yummy!

Very "simple", plus it's a great base for whatever add-in's you like or have on hand!  I opted to use penne pasta along with black olives. I lightened up the Ranch dressing by using light sour cream, Hellman's light mayo and light buttermilk. I had some leftover bacon that I crumbled and threw in along with some light shredded cheddar cheeese. I just couldn't see using canned chicken so this was a great opportunity to use up some leftover grilled BBQ chicken.  I topped this with some chopped green onion and a dash or two of paprika - delicious!

Big name but great taste! I doubled the recipe, using 1/2 c mayo and sour cream while still just using 1 pkt of ranch dressing.  Also, I grilled a few chicken breasts vs canned and worked great!  Love to eat and easy to make.  Thumbs up!

Thanks for everyones great reviews. I have since tried this recipe and instead of using canned chicken I used Rotisserie chicken that I shredded up from the grocery store and used black olives instead of green, and added bacon. It is soooo delicious. There are so many variations to this recipe. Thanks again for trying it out =)

Yummy recipe! I used 1/2 the celery because my hubby isn't a big celery fan, and I opted for baked chunks of chicken instead of the canned.I had him try it cold - and then he heated it up in the microwave just to see how it was warmed. He gave it a thumbs up either way. I will definately make it again! I'm going to add pimentos for a little more color next time, and I plan on trying it with tuna instead of chicken sometime. A fabulous - what can I add to this - recipe!

I made a few changes but really liked this salad.  I used small shells instead of elbow macaroni.  I also added a couple of chopped green onions.  Used leftover chopped turkey instead of canned chicken.  Because I found it a little too salty initially I increased the turkey to 2+ cups and added 2 diced hard-boiled eggs and that seemed to take care of it.  Served it on a bed of lettuce with cherry tomatoes as a garnish.  Very tasty!

Excellent Flavor!  I loved the ranch! I used miracle whip instead of mayo and I added a little extra because it got a little dry the longer it sat. I will be making this again!

I doubled everything in the recipe except for the ranch dressing (still used 1 packet), and thought the ranch flavor was perfect. Might've been too strong as written in the recipe. I left out the chicken, and added some halved cherry tomatoes. A nice twist on classic macaroni salad. I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe, but I didn't like the canned chicken AT ALL.  People at the BBQ I took it to all thought it was tuna with the smell and consistency.  I'll make this again, but with real chicken.

I have made a similar salad like this for many years, except I have used 1 can of tuna, drained, and added about 2 Tbs. of finely chopped green bell pepper.  It was something my husband grew up with and we adopted into our family....very nice on a hot day.....I think chicken works great too.

This was really delicious.  I had it at work for a luncheon and wanted to find the recipe and they said they got it at All Recipes.  The only thing I will be changing is the Ranch Mix is so salty, and I'm sure when I make it I will be cutting it and using only 1/2 if not 1/3 of the package.  Otherwise this is a wonderful blend of flavors and has a nice creamy texture to it.  I'm thinking I might use regular chicken also for getting rid of some of the salt.  Also the gal that made it didn't put in the olives and again, I won't either to keep the sodium down.
UPDATE:  Have made this (actually tripled it for a crowd).  Only put in one packet for a triple batch and it was plenty - I didn't put in the olives either - I believe that would make it to sour and salty at the same time.  I've had requests now for my version - but I wouldn't have my version if not for this one...thanks again...this is a keeper.

excuse my young adult syntax but THIS WAS FRIGGIN' DEL!!!!!!! as a newbie in the kitchen, this was easy to make and my whole family loved it. It was so refreshing and not too heavy. I loved this. I will definitely make this again. I used boneless Walmart chicken breasts, since we have them in abundance at my house. And I didn't add olives since I don't particularly like them. I also used salad dressing, since that's what we had. This was so good!!

I cut back on the celery by about 1/2(not a big fan), added green onions, also added Salad Supreme Seasoning, which I add to almost all my pasta salads (added 2 tablespoons to this). Waited about 4 hours & we loved it! The Salad Supreme I think takes away the blandness.

I made this for a Memorial Day BBQ, but I left out the olives and added in real bacon pieces (packaged).  Everyone (especially the guys) loved it.  One of my favorites.

Super easy recipe and perfect for quick lunches throughout the week. I used pimentos instead of olives although I think black or green olives would be great with it. Next time I am going to add a small amount of curry powder and maybe some grapes or apples. Many different ways to mix it up a bit. I also used grilled chicken instead of canned chicken.

I thought the recipe 'as-is' was too salty. I will use this is a base recipe next time. I will omit the celery and olives, add a chopped onion and maybe a cup of frozen peas, plus use only half the ranch seasoning pack and up the milk to 1/4 cup.

Was well received but no one really commented on it. I doubled the recipe but only used a packet and a half of the ranch. Definitely needs to be made in advance, flavor was better the next day.

Good flavor but mine came out waaay too salty.  I used generic ranch so I wonder if that was a problem.  I would try again but with less ranch.  I added red bell pepper and tomato.

This was the *best* recipe ever!  I modified with chopped BBQ chicken breasts, as I had some left over, and added two tablespoons of Kraft Red Peppers and Parmesan dressing.  The olives totally made this.  It was a hit at a BBQ I attended!

This is a good basic/easy recipe for mac. salad. My 3 y/o daughter really liked it, and she's not a ranch dressing fan. I think it needed a bit of a different flavor so I added some chopped onion. Probably wouldn't bother with the olives next time 'cos I didn't feel they really contributed much to it - or maybe I didn't like the flavor of them, which is wierd 'cos I DO like olives.

After letting it sit overnight, I thought it got rather dry and the flavors weren't any better than when I tried a couple of hours after I made it the day before.  I added a 1/2 a cup of milk and some onion and garlic powder and it helped but not enough for my husband to be impressed (He also said the canned chicken tastes like  LOL Guess I gotta go the real way next time).  Overall I'd definitely make it again, with just some tweaks.

I cant wait to try this recipe! I'm a little tempted to add bacon to it, just because bacon and ranch pair well together...

YUM!  I used leftover chicken breasts, and mixed paprika in with dressing.  Easy and different from other chicken salads.

This recipe just really didn't work for me. 4 servings didn't seem like enough, so I did double the recipe. I ended up using two cooked chicken breasts and cut those up, because there was no way I was going to use canned chicken. I used lite mayo and sour cream, which I do in all recipes with them. The problem I have is the ranch powder seemed like a lot and it made it really salty. The ranch powder at first seemed over powering but blended in after the paprika. However, I didn't understand the amount of paprika but used about 3/4 suggested. Once it gets into the pasta it turns it an orangy color. It makes it difficult to tell what kind of pasta salad it is. I also thought it was an awful lot of green olives and was uncertain how well the green olives will go over either with anyone who eats it. I refridgerated it as suggested and the green olives were so tart and strong tasting in the salad it made it near inedible. Not sure what I could have done wrong.

I am always looking for a great way to use chicken and this was a hit for my family.  I followed the recipe(omitting the celery) to the letter.  I will keep this one handy

Nice version of the usual Macaroni Salad - although I used farfalle pasta.  I just used bottled ranch dressing and omitted the mayo...also a little of the liquid from the olives added to that special taste.

I made this for a BBQ that we had for my sons birthday, I was not sure if it was going to be a hit or not, but IT WAS, everyone was coming back for seconds. I changed the recipe a bit because I did not have some ingredients on hand.  I did not add the celery, ranch packet, or mayonnaise.  I used reg. ranch dressing instead (just a little bit) and I use Miracle Whip.

I was looking for a simple yet different recipe for a cookout this past weekend. I decided on this one. When I was looking for ranch salad dressing I came across a fiesta style ranch dressing. It sounded good so,being the adventuruos cook that I am, I decided to try it. It turned out a little strong tasting so I modified it just a little. I added about a cup more mayo and a cup more cooked macaroni so that the mayo would not be too much. It was a perfect blend and very tasty! Everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.It's definately a keeper!

Not bad, has a lot of potential to be better. I added yellow onion and after doing so, I realized green onion would be better. I also added green pepper and a couple squirts of lemon juice. I quadrupled the recipe for a big family, but only used two ranch packets. Next time I will add hard boiled eggs. The lemon juice really made the difference between plain and yummy.

A quick throw-together. This recipe was ok and I would probably make again for a quick side dish. I skipped the canned chicken and olives because this recipe does not need more saltiness.  I substituted thinly sliced carrots which I par boiled with the pasta for the last 2 minutes of boiling.  I doubled the recipe but not the ranch dressing and it was fine.

This is great. I love that you can make this ahead. I took some of the other reviewer's advice and added my own real chicken chunks. I omitted the olives, but that's only because I didn't have them on hand. I think I've found myself a keeper with this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and it was so delicious i'm having it for lunch today.  I did omit the olives and I used rotisserie chicken instead of canned. This dish will be made again and again in my house. Bravo Pamelabee.

I used med shell noodles and changed the green olives to black olives. This was well accepted at the dinner table, but thinking back, I should have thrown in some bacon bits and probably will use fresh shredded chicken (canned is too salty and people mistake it for tuna)!! Next time! :)

This was very good and easy.  I did not use the olives. I did put in some onion, 3 hard boiled eggs and yellow pepper.  Chicken or tuna would be great also.  I did not use any meat this time.

This recipe was fair.  I didn't add the green olives b/c I don't like them but I did add a chopped boiled egg and doubled the rest of the recipe.  I think it would taste better in the summer with some fresh cherry tomatoes.

This is excellent and very easy to make.  You could use all kinds of variations, depending on what you have on hand.
I grilled the chicken, added chopped onion and chopped broccoli. Excellent!

I’m no sure about the flavor.  I used broasted chicken & doubled the recipe. I’m thinking it was too much paprika and or too much ranch dressing. I’m still trying to tweak it to my taste. Read most of the reviews & squeezed fresh lemon over. Taste test tomorrow. Maybe some hard boiled eggs?

Very simple and satisfying mac salad. I used precooked grilled chicken and left out the celery but added chopped green onion. I was pressed for time so I just used bottled ranch dressing.
