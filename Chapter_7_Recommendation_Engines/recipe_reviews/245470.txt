The only change I made was I used a pack of bacon instead of 6 slices. Turned out great and my family loved it

This is more labor intensive than most meals I cook, but the flavor was delicious. I don't have herbes de Provence, so I just used Italian seasoning. I served this with rice and put the sauce on top.
