my kids are eating this with bread, raw broccoli and carrots. it's kid friendly fondue!!! I could see this being good with some mushroom powder, like porcini.

I agree with the other reviewer. This lacked flavor and was very bland. It came together quick and melted nicely though so I think it has potential if you were to add some seasoning and even something for some heat.

it was easy to make but very mild without a lot of flavor. I had lots of leftovers.
