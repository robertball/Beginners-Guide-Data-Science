These were so good, I could have eaten them all before the guests arrived. I melted the chips and then put all of the grapes in the bowl and tossed to coat then spread them onto wax paper and sprinkled finely chopped peanuts over the top. These were a hit!

These are fantastic!  I only dipped about a quarter of the end of the grape in the white chocolate, giving the finished treat the appearance of an acorn.  I also used toffee covered peanuts.  Although they are good at room temperature, they are even better chilled.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These little gems are perfect!  So easy for children to help/make. I have to say that we like the white chocolate on the grapes more so then the milk chocolate that we also tried. The peanuts really finish the recipe into perfection!

So good. I served these at a kids' birthday party, and they were gone fast... both the adults and the kids loved them!
I ran out of peanuts, so I smashed up some pretzels, which turned out great.

This was a really fun dessert to eat. It's surprising as you find the freshness and juicyness of the grape inside the sweet and salty combination of white chocolate and nuts. I used roasted salted cashews instead and chilled them for a few hours before serving them. They went fast and everybody was intrigued and pleasantly surprised.

These were a hit!  I left off the nuts do to an allergy and I still think they were that good!  My girlfriend loved them and they are better once they have sat in the fridge and gotten really cold.

The are amazing!!! I never have leftovers and my family is usually eating them faster than I can make them! A few words of advice:

1. If you're making grapes with the "acorn" look (dipping only a quarter of the grape into the chocolate) then I suggest buying BIG grapes. I've made the mistake of buying small grapes and ended up getting more chocolate on my fingers and spending extra time hovering the countertop.

2. Use a chopper for the peanuts. It just makes life easier.

3. Chill them. But when you do, leave them UNCOVERED, otherwise they tend to get soggy.

4. Make a lot.

I give this recipe 5 stars. We don't care for peanuts so we used crushed, salted cashews and they were wonderful. This is a keeper.

I had some extra chips and grapes, so i thought, why not?  My toddler spit hers out after one bite, my husband almost did the same.  I was neutral, something that wasn't unedible, but i would def not make again.

These are very good and even better when chilled. For dipping I just used a toothpick inserted into one end..help make it a lot less messy!

tasty!  The grapes are easier to coat in chocolate if the chocolate firms up a bit.

Wonderful and refreshing...I tried dipping them 1/2 way in caramel first, then after that set up, I dipped it in the white chocolate...the BEST touch was instead of nuts, I rolled in crushed Golden Graham cereal...My next feat is to somehow make these less messy...perhaps dipping in the chocolate, rolling in cereal and then drizzling the caramel ontop...

YUM YUM YUM!! I thought these sounded interesting but strange and thought I'd give them a try.  I didn't have peanuts so I mixed crushed walnuts and and crushed pretzles and rolled them in that! AMAZING! I made half of them completely rolled in the mixture and the other half just dunked and I actually preferred the dunked ones.  The grapes I used were pretty small so the dunked ones balanced the flavors nicely! Thanks for sharing!!

What an addictive little snack! It's hard to eat just one of these little babies. A little messy trying to roll these in the crushed nuts, but it's all in fun. I'll have to make these again, they were surprisingly good. But then, what isn't after a dip in the chocolate?

These are not difficult at all. I used bars of baking chocolate and pretzels. At first I tried to roll the dipped grapes into the pretzels but I found everything was sliding off, so I used candy cups (like what is in the picture) and filled the bottom with a thin layer of pretzels and placed the dipped grapes on top with toothpicks in them, letting the chocolate coat the pretzels. It worked wonderfully! My guests seemed to like them and asked where I got the recipe. They came out looking like a lot more work than they actually were.

Great potluck dessert! Everyone loved them, once they figured out what they were...very different than chocolate covered strawberries, very refreshing! I used cashews instead of peanuts, and took them to 2 different events over the weekend, had none to bring home from either party.  The kids especially loved them!

I made this for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it even though he is not a big chocolate fan. I used pecans instead and only dipped half the grape in chocolate. This was a really unique idea! Overall a good treat with interesing textures and taste!

This turned out horrible for me.  I used Ghiradelli white chocolate and otherwise followed the directions ezactly.  The chocolate gumped up and eventually burned.  I'm going to try it one more time... but the first go round was a major bust!

Easy!  Different!  Delish!  Only 4 ingredients.  Brought these to a girls happy hour - required no plates, cutting, mess or utensils.   A somewhat guilt free pleasure - considering the other treats around them.  Was going to use cashews, but the peanuts were really good.  * note  make sure you roll the peanuts right away or the chocolate begins to harden and will not stick.  Enjoy.

Great idea. However, I used black chocolate instead of white & chopped walnuts instead of peanuts (I was not too thrilled about the savoury & sweet combination)

Different, easy, and delish!  I left out the nuts and they were fine standing alone.  :)

Made cute pumpkins for Halloween coloring the white chocolate orange and using dark chocolate for features.  Could be neat to make into eyeballs for Halloween also.

These are a great summer treat.  They are very refreshing. They couldn't be easier to make. Will definitely make again.

Everyone loves them!! I’ve also used white almond bark in place of chips because that’s what I had- tasted same.

What a fun, easy little treat or dessert to make and eat! I've got to make these for my grandchildren! Better yet, I'll get them to help me make them! I used pecans because it's the nut I had. I'm in serious trouble if these little gems are any better with peanuts.

They kind of tasted like caramel apples.  Not sure how, but delicious!

This was very delicious but for future reference it's best to heat up the chocolate on low heat on the stove. The microwave is just not  suited for this recipe.
