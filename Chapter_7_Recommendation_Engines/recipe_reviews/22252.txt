This receipe was great but I did change a few things. I used angle hair spaghetti. I sauteed finaly chopped onions with the beef. I added all the seasonings into the egg mixture. I put a thin layer of pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan. I then put the spaghetti noodles in. Then the egg mixture. Then a layer of pasta sauce. Then a layer of shredded monteray cheddar cheese. Then the beef which I still sprinkled oragano and garlic powder over. Then the rest of the sauce. And finally lots of shredded monteray cheddar cheese. I took out the pepperonis though. I also cooked it for about an hour to make sure the egg was done. It turned out great and even my picky boyfriend loved it!! THANKS

I also have a similar recipe.  I use Alberto's homemade noodles (wide or linguine) 12 oz.  I put it in one large round baking dish or two small ceramic pie dishes (one for freezer).  This looks more appealing like pizza and I slice it in pizza slices.  Children and teens love it.  I use a little more sauce than this recipe calls for.  If you need a quick meal the meat can be omitted.  I use this recipe all the time.

This dish was very good, I also added all my left over from making a pizza the night before. Fresh mushrooms, green peppers and even some canadian bacon. Used a combination of monterey jack cheese, mozz, chedder, and parmesan. Kids LOVED it. I added some onion and garlic cloves to the hamburger. Thank you for submitting this recipe. Nice twist to traditional spaghetti.

All in all it was good!  After 30 mins I took it out and the egg/milk mix was very watery.  I increased the temp to 375 and let it cook another 15 mins.  I took it out and the middle looked a little better but it still only registered 140F on the thermometer.  I then microwaved it for 5 minutes and the egg center finally finished cooking and reached 160 degrees.  I let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting it.  We liked it, especially the cheesy meaty topping.  Might add 8 oz. more sauceand some ricotta cheese to the egg/milk mixture next time to try and jazz it up, but we will definitely make it again.  Yummy!  
Well I made it again and this time I added 8oz of ricotta cheese to the milk/egg mixture and baked at 375F for 45 mins.  It came out perfect.  The only thing is next time I will use less pasta because the addition of the ricotta almost had my 15 x 9 inch corningware bake dish overflowing!!! This is a keeper recipe and sure to please the little ones in the family too!

I halved this recipe and it was ample for a family of 4.  Tastes great, but there was a watery milk mixture at the bottom of the casserole dish when I spooned it out to serve.  I only used a handful of pepperoni that I purchased from the deli section at my grocery store (about .50 worth of pre-sliced pepperoni, and I only used 1/2 of that.  It was fairly spicy.)   I also didn't have hamburger, so I used meatballs that I had in the freezer - just threw some in a pan, sauted with some onion till I could chop up the meatballs and used in place of burger.  Overall, a decent recipe that I would try again, but would definitely use less milk.

The first time that I made this, I followed the directions completely.  It came out ok, but was not what I had hoped for.  I made it a second time and I added double the sauce, double the cheese, a teaspoon of crushed red peppers and 3 fresh crushed garlic cloves.  This was a TOTAL improvement and will be a keeper but with a few more tweaks here and there...  I think that I will add a container of ricotta cheese the next time I make this...

I make a very similar version of this recipe that I call Baked Spaghetti.  I use angel hair pasta, it holds together really nicely when slicing and serving it, and I always use a mixture of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses for more of an Italian flare.  It’s such a quick and easy meal to prepare on a weeknight, but it’s still very yummy and satisfying.

My boyfriend loved this dish! I did layer it a little different: First, Used more pasta sauce, which I spread a thin layer on the bottom, then the noodles, then the eggs (which I had mixed all the dry spices INTO the egg mix). Then I spread another thin layer of pasta sauce over the noodles, followed by a little cheese, the meat and then the remaining pasta sauce and cheese on top to cover all. Overall, my family thought it was pretty good but it made alot...hopefully leftovers are equally as good! Thanks Naomi!

This a very tasty dish! My whole family (including a couple picky toddlers) LOVED it! I cut the recipe in half and we still had quite a bit left over. But it's just as good the second day as it is the first! The only thing I will do different next time is leave out the spices. I use an already "spicy" spaghetti sauce and it just didn't need the extra on top. And I'm sure that I used more cheese than the recipe called for, but you can never have too much cheese! This would also be a great recipe to serve to company. It's spaghetti, just a little dressier!

My husband and I LOVED this! When I was browning the beef, I added fresh garlic and seasoned it with Jane's Crazy Salt and Pepper and also some Season All. It added great flavor. I also used mozzarella cheese as well as cheddar. I will definitely be adding this to my list of favorite dinners.

THis was really good.  I was looking for a baked pasta dish with egg and this did the trick.  Whole family like it.   I did use my own pasta sauce that I freeze, that was my only change.

I made this in an 11x15 pan because I needed to stretch my meal. I also added another jar of pasta sauce. It disappeared very quickly and my whole family loved this dish.Thanks what a hit.

This was good but needed a few changes to be great.  You *definitely* need to add more sauce.  It was very dry. I would also layer some cheese in the middle to add some flavor. My top cheese burned so next time I will add it to the final 15 minutes. I split the recipe into 2 pie pans so I could cut pizza like slices and it worked really well!  One pie pan made enough for our family of 2 adults and 2 toddlers and I froze the second one.

12-14-07 - I received this recipe via email today and not knowing what to make for dinner I decided on this.  I had to substitute sausage for the hamburg and I also added some mozzarella to the cheddar.  The dish was bubbling after 30 minutes but when I served it I noticed the egg/milk mixture (as another reviewer noted) was still on the bottom of the dish.  This should heat nicely as leftovers in the microwave. UPDATE 5-8-08 - Did this with the ground beef. Only changed it by adding 1/2 chopped onion with the ground beef while browning.  Lowered the milk to just under 1 cup. Did add some more sauce. Baked, covered, for the first 30 minutes at 375. Then added cheese and baked for an additional 15 minutes. No more runny milky mixture. Leftovers are probably better the next day!

Very tasty! I kept off the pepperoni, and after it was finished cooking it looked nothing like a lasagna. It didn't have a nice layer of cheese on top like I had intended. (I used about 2 pre-packaged cheeses). Other than that, very delicious!

I was not pleased with this recipe.  I followed the common recommendations (one more egg, cooking longer, more sauce) and it still was rather bland and dry.  I was surprised because the ingredients sounded great -- meat sauce, spaghetti, cheese, pepperoni -- how could it go wrong??  But it did.  I think what ruined it was the fact that the meat is just browned and then thrown in.  I would not recommend this recipe.

I SO wanted to like this recipe.  I love spaghetti, pizza, and lasagna.  At the store, while I was buying the ingredients, I could barely contain my children.  It's not hard to make at all -- although like all lasagnas, getting it all in the pan is a bit of a challenge -- and we all eagerly awaited the finished product.  My husband and kids thought it was "fine"(hence four, instead of three, stars), but for me, it just seemed like there was a whole lot of really dry, tasteless spaghetti at the bottom. The ingredients didn't meld like they do in lasagna.  Since the family wants me to make it again (I think they like saying the name as much as anything), I'm going to make the following adjustments -- only eight ounces of spaghetti and only four ounces of pepperoni; increase eggs to three; start my layers the way I start regular lasagna, by covering the bottom of the dish with sauce.  Also, I'll decrease cooking time slightly, since I thought the cheese on top seemed a bit burnt.

I made this recipe in a group for foods class as a lab and it turned out great! The whole class left their own labs behind and was begging us to let them have a piece! the only thing that turned out wrong were the eggs they got very lumpy and somewhat scrambled, but  think I that was just because we poured them over the hot noodles!

I reduced this recipe to six serving and made two layers each of the pasta, milk mixture, pasta sauce, beef, spices and pepperoni.  I topped it with a combination of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses.  I added chopped onion, three teaspoons of minced garlic, two teaspoons of Creole seasoning and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the ground beef.  I chopped up the pepperoni slices for my top layer of pepperoni and sprinkled on some seasoning salt.  I also waited until the last five minutes of cooking time to add the top layer of cheese.  Next time, I plan on adding chopped olives and mushrooms.  My husband and I thought it was very good!

This dish was ok, when my husband saw it, the first thing he said was, "looks like your goulash dishes"--enough said! It was hearty and filling, but nothing spectacular. If I make this again, I will def. make some additions, like more meat, like italian sausage, genoa or hard salami w/the pepp., more cheese, less noodles. More spagetti sauce and more garlic. It was mentioned that I should layer it so that it all get a little bit of very thing. The idea of milk and beaten eggs was new to me, but I liked the end results. When I make this again, I will let you all know how the changes turned out.

I tried this recipe for the first time for company.  We all loved it!!  It was completely gone with no leftovers!  I even had to print off the recipe to hand out.  I added more sauce but I think next time, I will try and layer it so the pasta won't be as dry.  I also think I'll add mushrooms next time.

The whole family loved it! Very kid friendly and very filling! We had a ton of leftovers that were promptly gobbled up the next day! The only change I made was to mix the mozzarella and cheddar cheeses together since it's all I had on hand. Great recipe!

Excellent!  Easy, flavorful.  Served with a nice green salad and garlic bread, the entire family loved it.  This is a nice change from our usual weekly spaghetti dinner.  Thanks!

Normally, I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe you didn't follow exactly. But this sounded awesome to use up some ground turkey and really spicy chicken Italian sausage, so I cooked those up and omitted pepperoni. I cut back on milk and added an extra egg as per comments. Also added onion and extra spices, 'cuz we like a little bite. Loved it. Very good. My two cents- cover it for at least part of the bake time to keep the cheese from getting hard.

Overall, this was pretty good. I used a 6 cheese Italian blend instead of Cheddar cheese because I thought it would taste much better. My only problem with it is that not having the sauce mixed into the pasta before baking ends up making it a little dry, and I am worried about how the leftovers will taste. If I made this again, I would put pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan, then the pasta, then more sauce, and then finish layering. I also didn't use as much pepperoni as the recipe called for, and probably used 2 cups of cheese instead of 3.

This is definitely better the following day.  I followed other recommendations and set oven to 375 and cooked for 45 minutes, added spices to egg mixture, and sauteed chopped onion and garlic with beef.  Two recommendations I didn't use this time but will next are to use more sauce and wait to put the cheese on until the last 15 minutes or so.

This was an easy dish to make.  It smelled of more spices than it tasted.  The milk / egg mixture didn't bake through either.  Next time I'll add more spices, layer as others have suggested, and cook longer.  Other Spaghetti Pie recipes I've used add some cheese to the milk and eggs, and is mixed with the pasta before it goes in the dish and I think that helps.  Overall, a good fallback with ingredients on hand.  Thanks for something different!

Havn't tried it yet but spaghetti sauce now comes in 26 oz. jars.   Recipe says 1- 32 oz. jar--but shopping list says 2 - 28 oz. size jars??  so, what is the amount you really need?

The baked spaghetti and pepperoni go well together- except I found that using cheddar cheese as the topping made it a bit too dry/crunchy.  So I added part mozzarella and part cheddar to make the cheese softer.

My husband loves spaghetti but I get tired of always making it the same way.  He first turned up his nose when it came out of the oven but after he tried it he went back for seconds.  Next time I will use more sauce and try adding mushrooms.  The pepperoni tasted good on it.

I made this for my roommates and friends and although the recipe says 12 servings, 5 people at it all because they thought it was so good.  The next day one of the guys was asking me how to make it and they want me to make it again soon.  Great recipe!

Not bad.  I added more cheese and used leftover spaghetti sauce with meat already in it.  The kids liked it, but probably not something I would make frequently.

This recipe is amazing!  I made it for a function at my church and it never made it home!  I use ground turkey, two different spaghetti sauces, and four different kinds of cheese (the ones that come pre shredded at the grocery store?).  It's delicious and something that my sister now considers her comfort food!

This is a great recipe!  My picky 5-yr-old inhales this!  To make it healthier, I used whole wheat noodles, ground turkey, turkey pepperonis and low fat mozzarella.  Adding ricotta to the egg/milk mixture sure makes the sauce nice and creamy!

I just used 4 stars just because I tweaked it from other people's suggestions.  I used Angel Hair spaghetti, but only 1/2 lb because I found 1 lb to be too much.  I also used 48 ounces of pasta sauce.  I put some on the bottom of my casserole dish, put the Angel Hair next.  I used 3 eggs with the 1 cup of milk - and I added Parmesan cheese and the oregano/salt/pepper into the milk mixture.  I put the ground beef on top - which I had browned with garlic and onion.  I used Monterey Jack and Mozzerella cheese instead of Cheddar- I find cheddar can make things a little too oily.  I sprinkled a small layer of cheese on top of the beef and pasta sauce.  I layered pepperoni slices on top, layered with more cheese... then a small layer of pepperoni slices on the very top to give it that "pizza" taste and look.  It was soooo good.  The pepperoni with all that is excellent.  My hubby LOVED IT - my picky 4 year old didn't try it- just because the way it looked-  might try to put it in round pie pans to make it look like pizza.   I loved it--- you can top it with parmesan, red pepper flakes.. whatever.  Salad with it takes the key.  Thank you.  Loved it.  OH, my 2 year old daughter LOVED it.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it just did not turn out well.  My husband & mother-in-law liked it, but my kids and I did not.  The taste of the pasta sauce was too strong, & the casserole's consistency was too watery instead of held together.  The top, w/ the cheese & ground beef, was almost overdone, while the middle & bottom, w/ the egg mixture & pasta, was underdone.  I will look for a better baked spaghetti recipe.

I liked this recipe very much.  My husband said, "You can make this again", my 8 yr. old son ate 2 big pieces!  Even my 2 picky eaters ate without complaints.  My "tweaks" were:  I reduced the milk to 3/4 c and added 1 c of low-moisture mozzarella to the egg mixture.This is also where I added the spices. I used fresh onion (don't care for dried onion) and garlic sauteed with the ground beef. I made 2 layers with the ingredients using the pepperoni (only 4 oz) on the top layer.  Since we like more sauce, I used about 1 and 2/3 jars of sauce.  I waited to add the cheese on the very top until after it had baked for 25 minutes, then I added the remaining cheese and baked another 15 minutes.  It set up nicely and cut through like lasagne.  The bottom layer, where the cheese and egg baked together, was delicious!  This recipe was full of flavor!  Will certainly use again.  Thanks!

I make this for suppers in the field durring harvest for my husband and all the men that help.  It goes over great with them.  The only thing that I didn't like is that the cheese gets to crusty on the top.  I would sprinkle it on with 10 minutes left to bake.

This was an ok recipe.  I thought it turned out a little dry, it was too much meat, and too much pepperoni.  I think if I were to make it again I would mix it a little before I baked it and do with alot less meat.

Tried this for dinner last night and hubby and son liked it well enough to agree to have it again with a few changes.  They suggested added more spices, green peppers, additional sauce and using mozzarella cheese.  Since this was so easy to make will definitely try it again incorporating their suggestions.  And as some have said, this was really great the next day as leftovers.

We really liked it.  However, we found it a little dry so next time I will add a little more sauce.  I used ground Italian sausage and we found the flavor really good.  Since I grow my own herbs I added a lot more than it called for.  Will make again!!

This was very easy to make. My husband would have licked the dish if able. I would have doubled the egg and milk mixure to make it more stable when slicing. You can also add riccotta cheese into the layers. I sprikled parmesan cheese with each layer.

It was pretty good- I cut the milk to 2/3 cup and added spices to it- baked it for 45 mins. at 375 degrees then added cheese to top and cooked an additional 10 minutes- had no problem with it setting up - I also added more spices (Italian seasonings)- and real onions when I browned the beef- I loved it but my husband and son just "liked it"- It actually tastes better the 2nd day reheated-

This was quite a tasty dish; however, I did make some additions as other reviews suggested.  I added more spices (minced onion and oregano) to the milk/egg mix, cheese to the top (used cheddar only), and I used salami and pepperoni.  It was quite tasty!  There were quite a bit of spaghetti noodles, whether or not that was my mistake, next time I will cut down on the noodles.  All in all, it was a flavorful dish and I will most likely make it again.

We thought that it was very plain, and IF we make it again we will change some things like things other people suggested in their reviews.

I thought this sounded like a really good recipe but it didn't turn out that way. It was very bland and it called for way too much pepperoni. I also found adding the egg and milk strange but I did it anyway and after biting into it I was mad at myself for following the directions ... THE EGG WAS STILL RAW and this was after 30 minutes in the oven. I would also use less cheese or a different kind next time because after it all melted it turned into one big chunk of cheese. I will not be making this again.

This is a great recipe, but it's very filling and makes alot.  For my family next time I'll probably halve the recipe.  But very yummy!

I made a couple changes, but not many. This was wonderful! My 3 year old son-who is the world's PICKIEST eater- ate ALL OF HIS!!! I will definitely make this regularly. I doubled the sauce, used Angel hair pasta, Sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef, added mozzarella cheese to the cheddar (used 4 cups total of cheese), added minced garlic, peppers, and onion to the cooking meat, and mixed the dry spices into egg mixture. I also layered it as another reviewer advised: sauce on bottom, then pasta, then egg mixture, then sauce, meat, sauce, cheeses, pepperoni. I found that the mini pepperoni slices were perfect with this. Definitely worth it to make again and again! Thank you for the awesome recipe Naomi!

It's a keeper, the kids loved it. I did substitute dried onions for real, added some Italian seasoning to the meat while browning and used linguini pasta instead of spaghetti.

My husband and I thought this was very good. When I asked for a review from him all he said was "you could have put mushrooms in it!" LOL! Maybe I will next time, but I like to make these recipes as is the first time so I can give an honest review of the recipe as written. Thanks for a great dish.

Tastes mix really well...my spaghetti didn't stick (but I think that was my fault) and I would take advice of others. Less milk, extra egg, layer of sauce underneath.  I also added chopped garlic and onions to the ground turkey I used and used a mozerella cheese mix.

This recipe was delish!!!  The only changes I made was I added alittle more sauce and instead of cheddar cheese I used a mixture of mozzarella and provolone.  I also sauted an onion with the ground beef and added some fresh garlic

When your feeding 13 hungry firefighters in a busy house, you look for quick and easy meals that are hearty...this one takes the prize.  I used angel hair, went a little heavier on the garlic, and added some Franks to spice it up a little.  Was a big hit!  Great quick and easy filler-up!

This was really, really yummy. I used mozz with some parmesan cheese. I doubled the amount of sauce as others suggested and it probably could have used a bit more. Overall it was really good.

This made a fine meal.  It might be a bigger hit if there were children who tend to like this kind of thing more.  We ate it with garlic bread and salad.  Will I make it again?  Not for the two of us.

Delicious, especially when you add ricotta cheese(2 lb) to the milk & egg mixture. I also used an extra 1/2 jar of sauce, which I spread in the pan before adding the whole wheat spaghetti. Definitely a new family fav!

I enjoyed this for a quick weeknight meal.  I do think it needs a little something extra--perhaps sauteed onions rather than the dried onion?

Good, but not quite worth 5 stars in my opinion.  I found it had too few seasonings, my hubby agreed.  Will make again, but add a lot more spices and seasonings.  Thanks for the recipe.

This reminds me of spaghetti casserole. I substituted chopped onion for onion flakes and used 1/2 the pepperoni and 4 oz. mushrooms. I baked mine for an hour to make sure the egg was done. Plus I did 2 cups of shredded mozzarella and 1 cup of cheddar! Oh--I also covered with foil until the last 15 minutes.

A great recipe.  It's much easier to make than traditional lasagna and a nice change from regular spaghetti.

This turned out great!  It's very taste and adds a new twist to regular spaghetti.  Will make again and again!  Thank you, Naomi!

This recipe left much to be desired.  I love pasta.  I make Italian food all of the time.  The spaghetti tasted very nasty.  It was bland and the sauce did not mix well.  I will not make this again.

This recipe was a hit with my husband!  And it was so easy to make.  I had it in the oven within 15 minutes.  We never have leftovers!  I add more pasta sauce because we love the sauce and it still turns out great!  I've told everyone about it.  NWilson

Great recipe...  although I didn't have the crust-like (from the picture anyways) bottom.  But overall very yummy, even my picky three year old and persnickety nine year old ate it!

Husband, 15 year old, 5 year old, AND 2 year old LOVED this one.  They had it for 3 meals in a row and were happy each time! :)  Left overs are almost better. Made a few modifications to make it less fatty - added low fat Ricotta and used low fat Mozzarella instead of chedder. I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  I followed others advice and used 1.5 times the sauce and layered some sauce at the bottom.  I also mixed the spice (italian seasoning only as my sauce was preseasoned) and Ricotta into the egg mixture.  After 30 mins. the milk mixture was just barely runny but as the dish cooled, it thickened.  It did not detract from the dish.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

I followed the recipe other than the substitution of real onions for the dried (I was not going to purchase dried for one recipe).  The cheese, for lack of a better description, vulcanized the top of the dish.  The recommended amoung of pepperoni added too much salt to the top part of the dish while the spaghetti neededed seasoning.  I would not even take this dish to a pot-luck without serious modification.

This was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. I did halve the recipe, as it's just me and my husband, and it was still huge. We only ate about 1/4 of it. Should make good leftovers. I did follow the most common recommendations: layer of sauce on the bottom, cut back on the milk, extra egg, increased temp. and bake time, waiting until last 15 minutes to add cheese. I also went a little heavy on the seasonings (I get it from my husband...he's big on spices). I might make it again. My husband is a tough critic. I served it with bread and butter, cottage cheese, and salad. Very filling.

This was a nice change from simple spaghetti.  My daughter, who hates spaghetti, ate this with no complaints!  I just excluded the pepperoni due to personal taste and used angel hair instead of thicker spaghetti.

I have made this before and changed it by after the noodles were cooked, then i mixed garlic powder, cheese, egg, and a few Tabs. of milk into the moodles(this helped the noodles stick together more) topped with seasonings.  Came out perfect!

Upon reading other reviews I cut back on the milk, and cooked an extra 15 min.  It still came out watery. Otherwise, it tasted like spaghetti. I doubt I'll make it again, making old fashion spaghetti would be quicker.

I made a few adjustments based on what I had on hand.  I used some home made sauce I had from a previous recipe.  It had a sausage/ground beef mix in it.  I used turkey pepperoni.  And I added some shredded parmesan to the mozzerella.  Not sure if I'd make it again.  It just didn't 'pop' for me.

This was a fun recipe to make for my family.  The only complaint was that there was just too much pasta all at the bottom and no enough pepperoni; so the second time I made this I used angel hair pasta and halfed the amount and I added more pepperoni.  This is a new family favorite.

I liked it but it had too much pasta and milk so it was watery. Next time I will use less pasta and milk and add another egg to make is more like a pizza.

I thought this was an excellent recipe!  There were just a couple of things I tweeked with it though.  I like more sauce in my "lasagna/spaghetti/pizza" so I used about 1/2 a can/jar more than what the recipe calls for.  Also, I covered the dish for 20 minutes of the cooking time and then uncovered it for the remaining time so the topping didn't get hard.
It was really delicious!!!!

My family and I really loved this recipe.  I used whole wheat spaghetti and omitted the pepperoni.  Followed everything else exactly.  Treat it like lasagne and let it sit for 10 minutes or so after it comes out of the oven.  You can then cut it into perfect squares for serving.  Yum yum yum.  Makes a lot too!

I think it needs a little more sauce.  I added galic and the spices named to the meat and to the cassarole itself.  Very different and easy.  Different things can easily be substituted for picky eaters or something different.

This had very good flavor. I used Turkey Pepperoni - a little healthier. Easy to make in a short amount of time.
