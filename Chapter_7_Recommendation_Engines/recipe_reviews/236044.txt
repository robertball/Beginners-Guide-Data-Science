I knew I didn't quite have what the recipe called for but I could be close. I sub'd 2 dashes of white pepper for the black pepper and 3 dashes of Montreal Chicken seasoning for the Montreal Steak one and since I had no cornstarch I added 1/2 cup of potato flakes at the end of the cooking time not ideal but workable. I omitted the Italian seasoning but that was an accident I just plain forgot to add it. I usually go light on seasonings just due to personal preference. I used frozen broccoli florets because that is what I had. I really liked the end result and I realized this is a very flexible recipe which I appreciate. Next time I will try it with cream of mushroom beef stock and mushrooms for a more earthy flavor. I think saut√©ing the veggies together added more depth to the flavors so I think the mushrooms on the variation will be really good. Thanks to the person who posted this.

This was pretty good. I didn't add the steak sauce, and it was still a little zippy for my taste. next time I will add a little less Montreal seasoning. I also didn't have cornstarch, so I used tapioca, which I use to thicken other soups and stews.

This was delicious! I didn't cook any of the vegetables ahead of time just threw it all into the crockpot. I also used Velveeta instead of shredded cheddar because I find that processed cheese makes for a smoother consistency. The key to this recipe though is the Montreal Steak seasoning which gives it a surprising and pleasing kick.

This was not good. There was just to much pepper and the stake seasoning did not complement the cheese and broccoli well at all.

Cozy good! This soup is insanely delicious. Reminds me a bit of the Panera Bread version. I've made this a few times and just get some crusty bread as a side or dipper.

This is a simple and delicious soup! better than a lot of restaurants versions! I'm not a fan of Sharp cheddar so used Mild instead with a little Colby/Jack cheese..warm creamy and filling!

I made this one with a few items from two others on here. Did not use cornstarch, canola oil or sour cream, used 2 cream if celery, one cream of chicken, two bags of mixed cheddar cheeses, added a little milk, same spices. The result was super YUM. My brother doesnt like mushrooms.....you can really get creative, depending on what cheeses and thickening agents you prefer. Enjoy!

One of the easiest and most delicious soups I ve ever made. I altered a few ingredients based on what I had in my pantry but not enough to change the recipe substantially. One of the things I like about this recipe is that it s easy to modify. I did add chicken which was great.

Turned out great. A little zesty for my liking so next time will omit the steak seasoning or at least 1/2 it.

I doubled the recipe but next time I won't double the Montreal Steak Seasoning or the pepper--will use the regular 1-batch amount. Also--I used frozen broccoli rather than fresh put the whole thing in my stockpot instead of a slow cooker and was done in 30 minutes from start to finish. Family loved it!!

Very flexible recipe.  I chose it because it seemed like a simple one pot soup.  Used 2 lbs frozen broccoli florets, boiled them in about 1.5 cups of water until soft, and mashed with a meat mallot.  Added 2 chicken bullion cubes, and dissolved them in the mixture.  Added 1.5 cups frozen carrots that were sliced into rounds from my garden last year.  Cooked for about 5 min. Added 1 can cream of chicken and 2 cups of water.  Threw in about 1.5 tbs of tastefully simple onion onion and some black pepper out of the grinder.  Added a half bag shredded bacon cheddar cheese and a half bag shredded asadero (mexican queso mix from crystal farms) that I had in the freezer.  Cooked on low to melt the cheese.  Soup pretty much made itself.  Delicious and EASY.
