I made these a little different, but the same idea as written.  I used a cup of graham cracker crumbs mixed with only 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1 TBS of granulated sugar.  Sprayed a mini muffin tin with cooking spray and put about a TBS of crumbs into each well.  Baked those for about 5 minutes at 350.  Then took them out of the oven, added one rectangle piece of chocolate bar broken in half and a half of a regular sized marshmallow to each cup.  Turned the oven to broil, and broiled until the tops turned brown.  Allowed them to cool in the pan at least 10-15 minutes then removed.  Great hot, warm or even cold.

Oh! This is good! The graham cracker is a bit hard to get the right stick-togetherness. I added bits more of butter until it would hold a shape. Pack it into the muffin cups but you don't have to be fussy about it. We used mini chocolate chips which I'm sure melt differently then the bars, but they were much easier to get into the cups. The only really hard part was waiting for the marshmallows to brown! You can eat them hot but they won't hold their shape until they're cool. The solution, of course, is to eat some hot with a plate to collect the yummy falling goodness; and save some for later (best of luck with that!). This version is campfire memories made with a perfect twist. You'll be happy you did.

I think i read this recipe wrong -  i used two 14.4 oz boxes of graham crackers crushed with the 3/4 cup of butter. That was way too much graham cracker to the butter.  Maybe it is two packs inside one of the 14.4 oz boxes?  Mine fell apart.  This could have been written more clearly. . Also I think it works better to use one full size marshmallow cut in half. It adds an extra step but the three little marshmallows are not enough. They melted into a thin layer.

My granddaughter and I made this recipe.  The quantity of graham crackers needs to be more clear.  I thought that 2 packages meant 2 boxes.  I guess it meant 2 of the packages within the 14.4 ounce box.  We used a lot more butter than was called for in the recipe, but that may have been because we used the whole box instead of 2 of the packages.  Using paper liners is better, but you can make them without, if you grease the pans.  We used 5 mini marshmallows and 5 regular size chocolate chips per serving.

A friend brought these to us when my grandmother passed away.  These were beautiful, impressive looking, and so good! They were quickly devoured before many other desserts. I will be making these from now on when we need a chocolate fix and want it to look pretty. I noticed my friend used chocolate chips instead of candy bar pieces and she did not use paper liners which seemed to work out fine. I also found out my friend used 1/3 Cup sugar in graham cracker crust.

I drizzled the chocolate on the top at the end and I used the rectangle marshmallows, cutting them in quarters.

These are cute and pretty tasty, but I tried the Hersheyâ€™s bars and chocolate chips and thought the chips actually sat better in the little cups.  I used the store bought graham cracker crumbs - 2 cups with 1/2 cup of melted butter and added 2 tbsp sugar.

I don't get the people who gave it 1 or 2 stars and then state they read the recipe wrong. The recipe is so clear. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 3/4 and could probably have used less. I also had full size marshmallows in the house so I cut them in thirds and put 1/3 of a marshmallow on top. I made them in small cupcake tins with paper cupcake holders. I put 1 teaspoon of graham mix into the paper holder and pressed down on it with the back of the tablespoon measuring spoon. It made it nice and flat. I also added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the mix.  I overcooked the first batch waiting for the marshmallows to get brown but the second batch is great! I just let them puff up for about 6 minutes and took them right out. I also used vegan marshmallows from Trader Joe's which worked out perfectly.

I didn't have any paper muffin tin liners in the miniature size, so I followed ReneePaj's suggestion and used cooking spray and baked the graham cracker crust first before adding the chocolate and marshmallow. It came out well except that the crust was a little crumbly and fell apart when I removed these from the muffin tin. It could be because I didn't mix the butter in well enough to the graham crackers, though. I also broiled the marshmallows which only took about 30 seconds until the ones in the middle were in danger of burning! The taste was great though and I will make these again.

This recipe did not turn out well.  I let the marshmallows cook too long thinking they would brown and instead they melted into a pool of goo.

Cooking disaster!!!  I followed directions as written. I used paper cupcake liners.  Paper stuck to the smores and was impossible to remove.  The marshmellow top clung to pan which made them difficult to remove from the pan,  would not recommend this recipe
