We thought it was goodish.  We had to make a couple of changes since we only had ground turkey on hand.  You really have to experiment with how much of each item you like.  The first time I didn't put enough meat, and the second time maybe too much.  We sealed the burrito up withs some cream cheese and that gave it such a nice flavor with the strawberry salsa I think I'd just use that next time instead of the blue cheese.  We also ended up a lot of extra salsa, which we are going to try to save for salads tomorrow for lunch, but I'm thinking it will be soggy and slimey by they...we'll see.  All and all I think this is a very well thought out lunch/dinner that just falls a little short, but I do think it's a great way to start experimenting with these flavors, maybe adding them to other favorites.

I tried this recipe and LOVED it!  I used Feta cheese and mixed with the strawberry salsa, the combination is fantastic.  Plus, it was quick and easy.  I will put this in my recipes that I make on a regular basis.

This is a Great summer meal and one we make often.  This is my first review but I like this one so much I decided to add my two cents.  This recipe is even easier if you buy the grocery store's rotisserie turkey. We use feta and mixed greens instead of blue cheese and spinach but that's just a preference.  mmmmm!  Making it again tonight.  =)  Thanks for a great one!

These were great.  I used chicken tenderloins and I marinated it in a lime dressing marinade because I couldn't find any southwest marinade seasoning.  Used regular onion instead of red, feta cheese and jalapeno and cilantro tortillas.  Very light tasting and flavorful.  Thank you.

this recipe is really good. We ended up eating as a salad instead of a wrap though, we felt the wrap took away from the flavor

I have made this several times and everyone raves about it. I am not a fan of blue cheese, but in this dish it gives the perfect flavor. I would not change a thing. The extra salsa always makes a good salad topping the next day.

So good! I used chicken instead of turkey. I also used bottled marinade, so I didn't cook the chicken in oil. I also used feta instead of blue cheese as suggested by another reviewer. Definately a keeper!

I really enjoyed this, especially the strawberry salsa, so delicious! I used left over bbq'd chicken, feta cheese, baby greens salad mix and sealed the edges of the wrap with a little cream cheese. mmmmmm, yummy!

Don’t let the spinach scare keep you from trying this one.  We substituted mixed baby greens and arugula.  Not being a huge fan of blue cheese we used Laurie’s suggestion of using feta cheese, but combined the two type of cheeses together.  It was delightful, and what a wonderful way to use the last of the summer strawberries.  It makes a light wonderful summer time meal.

Excellent - Definitely a recipe with a ton of possibilities.  We made it with chicken instead of turkey and I couldn't find the jalapeno wraps so we used sundried tomato wraps.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

This recipe is a keeper.  Everyone loved it. Delicious and easy to make.  I used romaine lettuce instead of spinach.  I will make this one often.

This has potential!  I had a Foster Farm BBQ tenderloin in the freezer and needed a recipe. I stumbled on this one and made a few minor changes. I did make a southwest marinade (recipe found elsewhere) and re-seasoned the turkey before cooking, giving it a decent flavor. Our household does not do blue cheese, so I subbed feta. Aside from that I stuck to the recipe.

The onion and cilantro over-powered the other delicate flavors; it was all I could taste. I'm of the thinking that strawberries and onions don't go well together but this wrap could be great with some adjustments.

I used chicken breasts instead of turkey. I added a pinch of sugar to the salsa to bring out the flavor of the strawberries which made a huge difference. This was really not spicy at all so next time I'll add a little ground red pepper to the marinade. This was delicious the next day.

Great, interesting blend of flavors. We actually preferred the leftovers when the turkey was cold along with the rest of the ingredients.
