This was pretty good for a quickie dish.  I cooked the ground turkey with fresh garlic, a half a large onion, 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper in olive oil for extra flavor.  I also prepared it ahead of time and baked it for 45 minutes instead of 30 since it was coming from the  fridge. My company said it tasted like lasagna :)

We found this easy to make, but on first serving the Turkey needed some more flavor to it. Second serving the turkey had more flavor but still could have used more to make this recipe a 5.

I added some pesto to the cheese mixture and used 1 24 oz jar. I think 14 oz would have been really dry. Really easy and quick!

This was WONDERFUL!  I have to admit, I love to read recipes but I seldom follow them exactly.  I like to get ideas.  This one I actually followed pretty closely except I only used about half a pound of ground turkey and I used fresh mozzarella and then I added some fresh basil and oregano from my garden.  Oh, and  I used a can of stewed tomatoes since I didn't have the Classico.  I can't wait to make this with a couple of fresh tomatoes! Oh, another thing...I didn't precook the pasta...I sauteed the turkey, onions, garlic then added the tomatoes,ricotta, herbs, a little extra water to the skillet, brought it to a boil, then poured the whole thing into a casserole, and cut up the mozzarella balls on top.  Yum yum, great flavors!
