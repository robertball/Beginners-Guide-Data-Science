I knew this recipe could easily go bad, but it shocked and surprised me--in a good way.  I doubled the peanut butter, and so glad I did, as it was the perfect amount.  I also added 1 T vanilla, 2 T brown sugar, and only used 1 T butter in the muffins.  These have more of a cake-like texture, but they were delicious.  I tried them plain, but chocolate chips would make a nice treat (a little much for our breakfast).  I also just dusted them with sugar prior to baking, and didn't end up putting extra butter on top.  Next time I make these, I am planning on making a streusel topping with chopped peanuts and I can't wait to try that!! Will add to my collection--thanks for something new for breakfast!

This really needed some tweaking. The peanut butter flavor got lost. Bland. I liked the technique of cutting in the butter and pnut butter- made a nice texture. I added chocolate chips and then microwaved peanut butter and added an equal amount of powdered sugar to make crumbles (how much depends on how decadent you want them to be!)I folded that in at the end. Hubby says more chocolate chips so maybe add 2 cups. You could also put a mini Reese cup in the middle and chop some up and put on top near the end of baking. Thanks for the basic recpe, though!

With adjustments based on reading all of the comments - these were very good.  I was looking for a PBJ muffin for my kids' lunches.  I will try some more just to see about less suagr but these are very good.  I used 1.25 cups flour and .75 cups oatmeal instead of 2 cup flour.  I used 1 cup of peanut butter.  I added 2 T brown sugar and 1 T vanilla with the wet ingredients.  I used only one T butter.  

It made 16 regular sized muffins.  I made twleve with jelly in the middle (fill halfway, add jelly, and top off) and I got my kids to eat a jelly they otherwise do not like.  The other four I put a banana slice in the middle and a few banana slices on top sprinkled with cinnamon sugar mix.

Great recipe, I really liked cutting the butters into the dry ingredients and I think made it fluffier and lighter... I substituted 2c whole wheat flour, added 1/4c brown sugar, used 1c peanut butter, added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, used water instead of milk, and covered with chocolate chips after in the tins and baked at 350 for 15 min... and they are perrrrfect!

I loved these..adding 1/4 tsp. vanilla or butterscotch flavoring, 1 T. sugar to the 1/2 c. sugar, cut the butter to 2 T. and added 1/4 tsp.sugar to top before baking, skipping the melted butter & cinnamon/sugar after baking. Yummy!!!!!

I did as others did and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup (crunchy) and also added chocolate chips!  They are to die for!

These were fantastic!  Even my husband who doesn't like peanut butter at all really enjoyed them.  And just a tip for anyone else feeling creative...for 6 of the muffins I filled the muffin cups half with batter then a dollop of Nutella and then more batter on top.  It was like Peanut Butter Cup Muffins:)

Wow, these are great! Not too sweet which I thought was perfect. I added 2 tbs of brown sugar to the mix and used a little brown sugar in the cinnamon sprinkle on top too. Great recipe! I cant wait to try this with jam for breakfast.

These were great and very, very easy to make. I made them for my brothers and sisters and they all loved them. With one batch I was able to make 12 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins. My 6 year old brother said he could eat 5 big pans of them and 5 small pans:) The only thing I changed about the recipe was to substitute flaxseed for the eggs. After they were finished baking we poked holes lengthwise through the middle and put grape jelly in them. The only thing I would probably do different next time is to add more peanut butter. Thanks for the recipe; I will for sure be making these again!!

Per other reviews I doubled the PB and put the cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  The flavor was ok but certainly not wonderful.  I think they really would have been bad without doubling the PB.  They weren't sweet enough for me.  Maybe I should have tried the vanilla & brown sugar that others suggested.  I may give this one another try but if it fails again it's a no-go.

Nice light peanut butter flavor. I used canola oil in place of the butter and used Egg Beaters in place of the eggs. Will definitely
make again.

I used 1 cup of "real" peanut butter (fresh ground), added 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 1 Tbsp vanilla  as others suggested, and about 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips. I also used about 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. I didn't add any toppings. Wow, these were the best peanut butter muffins I've ever had.

I made these...added 3/4 c. PB, tbsp vanilla and left everything else the same.  I added mini choc chips to half of them.  My family will not eat them, but I will and I gave some to my brother to take home (hopefully he will eat them).

I have to agree with another reviewer.  These were rather bland, even with more peanut butter and the nutella in the middle.  Maybe a teaspoon of grape jelly in the centre would help, but I don't think I will bother trying these again.  Good texture, though.

Doubling the peanut butter is absolutely necessary. I'm really glad I read through the reviews before I attempted these. I used whole wheat white flour, one teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda, "soured" nonfat milk, organic eggs, Trader Joe's chunky peanut butter and I added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, as that is what other reviewers did. Right before baking, I did sprinkle a little bit of sugar over each muffin. I recommend melting your butter and combining it together in a bowl with the peanut butter, eggs and milk before folding it into the dry ingredients so your muffins don't end up tough. 20 minutes at 350* was just right for me. My family really did like these muffins but I think if I had not doubled the peanut butter, the muffins would not have been as good. NOTE: I got 12 large muffins out of this recipe.

Delicious muffins!  Minor changes to make a bit healthier:  1 cup oatmeal in place of 1 cup flour, 3 tablespoons olive oil into batter in place of butter, used 2% milk, and added ground flax seeds and raisins!  Light and fluffy!  Fabulous!

OMG, these are amazing! I don't even typically like peanut butter in my baked goods but I wanted a muffin that was hearty and healthy so that I could grab on the go for work.  I found it!  

I have no doubt the recipe is good as is, but I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup combination of flax powder and bran.  Only other sub I made was almond milk instead of regular.

These are in the oven now and they smell wonderful! I made some modifications to the recipe. I used buttermilk, rather than regular milk, and, I added baking soda and powder since people are saying they fell flat. Also, since people were saying they were bland, I chopped up a granny smith apple, coated it in brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon, and mixed it in after the base was mixed. Also used mostly brown sugar since I'm low on white. Will top with sprinkles of cinnamon and sugar. Hopefully, the bf will like them!

I only gave this recipe 3 stars, because I made a lot of modifications.  My muffins turned out great, but I made them into a dessert.  I followed others' advice and doubled the PB.  I also subbed half all purpose flour and half cake flour.  I added 1/4 brown sugar to the butter, used soured milk, added vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.  Then the batter still looked a little risky of being too dry, so I added a tablespoon of oil.  Then, I added Reese's PB chips to the batter.  My daughter sprinkled the tops with colored sprinkles (sugar) and baked them just a bit longer than directed.  Overall very good with the changes!

These muffins hit the spot. I used buttermilk instead of milk but other than that stuck to the recipe. My  kids and I added a little jelly to them after they cooled. Scrumptious.

I´m pretty disapointed with this recipe.
My muffins came out to be tasteless even with the bailey and the vanilla extract I added in the batch before placing the muffins in the oven.

These are really delicious! Just the right amount of peanut butter for flavor. I did not have cinnamon left so I just used sugar and they were still great. I made them exactly as the recipe said and I think there are no changes that need to be made. They were easy to make and my three year old gobbled them up.

We really enjoyed these! My 8yo said "5 stars!!!" with a mouthful of muffin. He asked me to add them to my permenant recipe box (that usually doesn't happen until we have made a recipe several times). Thanks for the post! (:

These muffins were good. Not too sweet, so they work for breakfast, and they taste great with jelly. I'll be making these again!

My husband has celiac disease so we needed to use a gluten-free flour. I did 1 3/4 cups of flour and did just over a cup of milk since the gluten-free flour is more absorbant. I also added more peanut butter. When filling the muffin tins (I used cupcake liners as well) I filled it halfway, inserted a small spoonful of jelly, and then filled the rest of the way. The result was a jelly-filled muffin and it was fantastic this way.

I made this because I was looking for something to use up some chocolate and peanut butter chips and this was perfect! I did read the reviews of others mentioning that it was too bland and I think it would be without the chips added. However these muffins with the chips were AWESOME!! I will be making these again and again. Great peanut butter muffin starter. I want to try it with  bananas too.

YUMMY!  I used 1 cup of smooth PB and added 1 Tbsp of vanilla, b/c I add vanilla to everything!  My bf's mom had one and then came back for more!  That should explain just how good they are, when even your mother-in-law has seconds!  :)  Next time i will try adding some PB chips or chocolate chips.  Also thought that adding a couple ripe bananas might give it a nice flavour. . . and really, who doesn't love a PB and banana sandwich?  Thanks for the wonderful recipe! 5 Stars all the way!

good starter. changed from 1/2 cup to 1 cup of peanut butter, and changed to 1 Tbsp butter in recipe.   Replaced 3/4 cup flour with 3/4 cup oatmeal, added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Filled muffin cup half way, added spoon full jelly, filled the remainder of muffin cup.

Wow even the batter tasted amazing! lol but I did tweak it just a little, I added cinnamon to dry ingredients along with some Reese's peanut butter chips. Also when I was mixing the wet ingredients I also added some vanilla in there. Both of those just a added more depth to the flavor. I will have to try it with the brown sugar too! Delicious!

I don't know what I did in error but it must have been something. I followed to recipe to a T and they turned out nothing like I expected. The mix was not moist, but kind of dry. They didn't rise and they were very bland. There wasn't much PB taste to them at all. The next half of the batch I tweaked and added some vanilla, more sugar and more PB plus a little oil. These turned out better but not something I'd make again. Thanks for the recipe though and I'm glad others have better luck then I did.

Not bad...not fabulous. They were a little bland, but I think the changes I made helped them. I added 3/4 t. of vanilla and an extra 2T. of brown sugar. I also used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. My kids liked them really well with peanut butter on top...or jelly, so I'm glad I tried the recipe.

Each member of my family thought these muffins were very bland.  I double-checked the recipe afterward to make sure that it really did only call for 1/2 cup of sugar.  Although I did not expect the sweetness of a cupcake, they did not even have the sweetness of a muffin.  I did use 3/4 cup peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup. I added a little vanilla like others sugguested but still "blah." I really liked the idea of these muffins so I may try again and add more sugar or brown sugar but I'll try a few other muffin recipes before giving this one another chance.

I have to agree with everyone, the method of cutting the peanut butter and cold butter really makes this good and interesting! I wanted to try the recipe as written to see how it was before I modified it. I have a sweet tooth, so my first instinct was yeah, it's not sweet enough. The peanut butter flavor is pretty light too. But overall, I think these were perfect muffins. Nice and light and fluffy! If I made it sweeter, I think it'd be a cupcake, not a muffin. As it was, it was perfect with a chai tea this morning! I think those peanut butter chips would be great in this, as would chocolate chips. If you add more sugar and make it a cupcake, add chocolate frosting! MMMmmm!

I tried them with almond butter instead of peanut butter and made them Gluten Free and they were absolutely amazing. It's hard to get Gluten Free to be moist and this worked.

Delish!  I used buttermilk (only because I had some leftover), together with 1 tblsp of brown sugar (as suggested by others) and some chocolate chips.  Very tasty and moist.

I'd never eaten peanut butter muffins before, but these came out delicious! I made them exactly according to the recipe, except I put a brown sugar mixture on top before baking instead of the melted butter and cinnamon because that seemed like too much trouble. They came out really delicious, and just the right texture. Will definitely make again, whenever I have extra peanut butter!

This recipe was a little disappointing. They didn't taste sweet enough or peanutty enough. Maybe I'll try it again with more of those added.
