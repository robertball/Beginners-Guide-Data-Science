I came across this recipe using the recipe roulette on this site and what a great find! I love macaroons and this is such an easy twist. Instead of letting the bread dry overnight, I first cut up the bread (into 6 instead of 3 to make them more cookie size), then toasted them in the toaster oven. Worked like a charm. Great EASY recipe... can't wait to use for Christmas!

Drizzle some melted chocolate over the tops.  These are okay, more of a novelty because they are made with bread.  Worth trying at least once.  Maybe you can jazz them up a little with your own twist.

I did not like this recipe at all.  Very messy to make and the end result tasted like coconut flavored day old bread.  No one in my family cared for them either.

I made this for a simple party, hoping for a tasty recipe with little mess. These cookies DEFINITELY didn't meet my expectations. Needless to say, I will never make these again.

Ohhhh! I remember making these in home economics when I was in school! It definitely appealed to my young sweet tooth! Every once in a while I'll make a teeny batch with some leftover Eagle Brand. Not anything I'd serve to company, but they are one of those things that can satisfy a craving. (We didn't worry about letting the bread get dry and ate them warm and drippy with the sweetened condensed milk.)

I grew up with these as a child. My mother had this recipe in a depression-era cookbooks. It is quite messy to make; I guess that is why my sister and I loved to help out.  We have even made this recipe with minced nuts which worked well.

These are easy and very good. When you use this recipe you probably should not expect something worthy of serving to guests, but if you just need a sweet coconut macaroon-y snack, these are the thing. Thanks for helping me use up my leftover condensed milk!

I made these when I first started baking (I think it was 2nd or 3rd grade now I'm 26)and my mom called them Cinderellas. I still love these and just made another batch last night. I don't stale the bread, I just use it fresh and the cookies have never been dry. These aren't the pretties cookies ( I have never made them so they turned out beautifully however I am not the "prettiest" baker). They are so simple and would be fun to make with small kids who want to learn how to bake. Some people said they didn't like how they tasted, I always thought they tasted like a chewy, coconut, nougat candy bar. I'm considering trying something new. I'm considering mashing the bread, milk, and coconut all together to form a thick paste, then forming that into half-inch tall, coin shaped cookies. I did that with one last night (unintentionally because my hands were covered in gunk and it ripped the bread apart) and it turned out great, and not runny like the other ones.
