Ok, so I used this recipe as the basis for a pretty decent chicken dish. I used pretty much all the stated ingredients apart from the water, but I browned the bite-size pieces of chicken in olive oil, added the onion and sauteed it, then stirred in the rest of the ingredients along with a can of chicken broth. I simmered it until the broccoli was tender - I needed to add a little more broth - and served it with plain white rice. Not bad at all. Thanks, Rodney!

This is a great recipe. I found myself with no small cans of diced tomatoes, so I substituted a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes for the tomatoes and sauce. I also used chicken broth in place of water and two cloves of garlic for the garlic powder. I used the "Cajun Seasoning Mix" from this site. Thanks for a keeper.

Really, really great recipe! The blend of spices is just right. I would recommend adding another can of beans though, maybe white beans or garbanzo. Delicious!

Very good soup.  My only suggestion would be to add more veggies.  This soup made a lot of broth, so add more veggies.  I put in more carrots and let them cook for 15 minutes before adding the broccoli.  I added 2 cups broccoli.  I think I am going to add some fresh green beans or zucchini next time.  Good recipe though.

This recipe is excellent.  It was so quick and easy.  I loved the cajun spices.  It tastes great with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  Great with grilled cheese sandwiches.

Used leftover rotisserie chicken. I picked the meat off. Then I put the carcass in broth[made with ckn broth instead of water] let it simmer about 30 min. for more flavor. I never throw out a ckn carcass.  They come in so handy. Just wrap them up and throw them in the freezer til you are ready to use them.  Took the carcass out.  Added veggies.  Carrots, onions, green beans & zucchini. Was out of broccoli. When they were tender I added chicken that was removed from the  carcass before I put it in the broth.  Next time I think I'll add a little rice or pasta.  This is a great recipe for using up what's in your fridge.  I also added some red pepper flakes. I always crush them in my hand. They blend in better that way and no one gets a mouthful. I always enjoy making a good soup.  2/19/2011  If you are worried about little ckn bones remaining in the soup wrap the carcass in cheesecloth & tie it tight & when soup is done remove the bag.  It's a good precaution.  Especially when the kids are slurping up the soup.

Sorry, but I just thought this was kind of boring.  I don't specifically recall, but I'm sure I started adding more spice to get some flavor back into it... but I also always rate the recipe, not my fixes.

This was an okay soup.  Like others I found the soup week.  I added more cajun spice, lots of garlic salt, and some parmesan cheese.  Came out good but not one of my favorites

Oh so yummy!  Thanks for sharing.  Upon others' advice, I used low sodium chicken stock substituted for water and added a can navy beans as well.  The whole family loved it.

This was pretty good. I doubled the amount of cajun seasoning and garlic powder. I had a green bell pepper I needed to use so I threw it in with all of the other vegetables as well.

I thought that the quantity of water made the soup weak, so I had to add more Cajun seasoning and pepper.  After it cooked down a little, the flavor of the soup was great.

Simple and delicious!  I added a can of black beans and let it simmer longer to get a thicker soup.
