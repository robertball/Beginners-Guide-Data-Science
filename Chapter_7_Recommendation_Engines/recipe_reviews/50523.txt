I am so glad that you have all enjoyed this recipe. When I said a 9 inch pie pan, I was referring to a nine inch deep dish pie pan (glass type). This will hold the entire mixture. If you don't have the deep dish type, cut back on liquids. I always cook mine on a cookie sheet, just to be on the safe side. Let your pie set up before serving. Hope this helps too! Enjoy!

This is a great recipe for a crustless quiche! (Really cuts down on fat content.) Be sure to spray your pie plate before adding the ingredients and use olive oil spray to saute onions. I left out the mushrooms only because I don't like them. I also did not cook the spinach as other reviewers suggested. Thaw and drain is enough. I used no fat or low fat everything and it was delicious!!

The quiche was absolutely delicious, but I did have one problem.  The recipe didn't call for deep dish pie crusts, so I bought regular ones and they weren't nearly big enough.  What was in the crusts was great, but I must have lost about 4 eggs when I pured the egg mixture over the crust, it spilled everywhere!  I would still highly reccommend this recipe, just make sure you buy deep dish crusts.  Thanks!!!

Dear Clark-
My father has stage 4 esophageal cancer.  It's difficult for him to eat and I have to select foods that go down easy. I'm always looking for new recipes that have calories, protein, etc.   I found your recipe a few weeks ago.  My father didn't know what quiche was, but I told him he'd probably like it and its better than scrambled eggs.  Tonight I made your quiche.  I took out all the meat, and substituted turkey bacon(not a pork person).   My father ate an entire piece and he loved it!  Your recipe is a blessing to me and I thank you with all my heart for taking the time to post it.   I just wanted to say "Thank you", and to let you know that sometimes even just posting a recipe can truly change someone's life for the better.  Sincerely, 
                                                             Amy

There is a way to avoid a soggy crust.  Beat the white of one egg with a teaspoon of water.  Brush the whole crust with this and bake the pie shell(s) for 10 minutes at 375 degrees before adding ingredients. Cook as directed.  Great recipe--tasty!

Although I have eaten quiches for many years, this is the first one I actually made and it was a huge hit. Probably the best one I have ever tasted. I made two modifications, I used a little over a pound of bacon and deleted the ham and substituted broccoli for the spinach. 

After reading everyones comments I was a little gun shy about the amount it made so I had some extra pie crust and tins on "standby". The way I made them there was just slightly more than would  fit in two 9 inch tins (1 deep, 1 regular). My only criticism is that this takes WAY more time to prepare than 15 minutes. The preparation of the bacon takes longer than that. Also, this recipe uses a lot of cheese and if you don't want to pay a fortune to buy it shredded, that step will also be time consuming.

We will definitely make this fantastic recipe again. You cannot go wrong with this one.

I've made this quiche probably a dozen times this past year.  In my opinion its the best quiche I've ever tasted (although not the healthiest!).  I pre-bake the pie shells for around 10 minutes.  I eat one and freeze the other.  The frozen one tastes just as good as the fresh quiche.  Instead of ham, I use fresh smoked bacon.  Instead of frozen spinach, I use two bunches of fresh baby spinach.  I've also substituted a fresh bunch of spinach for broccoli as that combination works really well too.  SOOOOOOO good!!!  I've also made this one for my parents.  They were so impressed with  this quiche that my mom got rid of her old quiche recipe and only makes this one too!

Excellent recipe - easy to make and was a huge hit for Thanksgiving brunch/lunch today (Canada).  I took the advice of previous review and cut back on cheese amounts (5 oz vs. 8 oz) and substituted the spinach for same size pkg of frozen chopped broccoli - also deleted the bacon and just used smoked ham steak (diced)- also added diced green and red peppers to onion/mushroom/ham saute mix.  Nice flavour and colour.  On advice of previous review, I held back on egg mixture (I had enough left over for my boyfriend to make one massive omelette at work later on!) - any more egg mix in the quiche pie shells (deep dish 9") would have definitely overflowed but didn't due to cutting back.  Would suggest cutting back to 6 eggs vs. 8 (if using large eggs).  Could have gone 45 minutes vs. 40 in oven but overall - awesome recipe and enough for 6 adults with tossed salad.  Thanks for the recipe, Clark!  I will definitely be making again!

This recipe was wonderful.. I had a small brunch for some friends and made these in mini form... They were delicious... Just drop the temperature to 325 degrees and cooking time to 30 to 35 minutes...  Thank you for this GREAT recipe... Yes, even the kid's LOVED it... I also emailed it to my friend's, right after they left...

I should have believed you Clark: I halved the recipe and made only one... It was gobbled up immediately and the next day my fianc√© came to me with the sad puppy look on his face, asking me if I could pleeease pleeease make another one. :-) An excellent quiche! I especially like the spinach - sour cream mix: I've now used it in other quiches, too, and it does wonders.

We really loved this recipe. To reduce the carbohydrates, I did not add the onions. I would suggest baking the crust for a few minutes before adding the filling because it was a bit mushy on the bottom.

The best quiche yet!!! I lined a 9x12 glass baking dish w/ cresent rolls on bottom only as the crust because I couldn't find pie crusts deep enough to hold the recipie.  It's a wonderful way to make it for a party because it's easy to cut into little squares.  Thanks Clark!!!

Eggs never tasted better than in a good quiche. This one is a great one! Thanks Clark!!! I made  4 modifications. 1) I didn't have any ham so I used 1 lb. bacon drained. (Note: Try making your bacon in the microwave. Place 2-3 paper towles on a microwave safe plate. Arrange the bacon 1layer thick and not overlapping. place another paper towel on top. Nuke for about 4 minutes ...longer if necessary.) 2) I added about 1/3 cup diced red pepper for flavor and color. 3) I sprinkled a strong 1/4 teaspoon of ground dried rosemary leafs on top of the mushrooms. Used a mortar & pestle to crush the rosemary. 4) After 30 minutes of baking, I sprinkled 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese flakes on top. By waiting until then, the cheese did not burn but rather turned a nice golden brown. Also, instead of making 2 quiches, I decided to make 1 deep dish (see photo). This required me to turn the oven down at the 40 minute mark to 350 F and bake an additional 15-20 minutes. Perfection!

I made this for friends and they really enjoyed the dish. The only change I made was to leave off the spinach. I will make this again in the future.

This is my first low rating. It was terrible! And I love quiche, and spinach! I ended up putting ketchup on it to try to make it better. I'm embarrased to have served it to my family. I'll stick with the wild rice and ham from this site. If I could give this a lower rating I would. Leaves a bad after taste in your mouth and the flavors do not blend well... at all. I see most everyone who gave it 5 stars altered the recipe then rated it... I made it exact, but I'm glad I only made one.

Listen up, quiche purists!  I mixed everything together instead of layering and it was very quiche-like.  I made some other changes:  in an effort to reduce carbs and fat, I did not use pie crusts, but baked all of this in a 9x13 pan.  I used 12 oz turkey bacon, omitted the ham, added chopped red pepper, used egg beaters instead of eggs, and fat free half and half instead of cream.  It's an awesome quiche / breakfast casserole.

This deserves WAY MORE than 5 stars!!! Yes, it's THAT good! Hands down, the best quiche recipe I've yet to make. My husband most definitely agreed and went back for seconds! I guess real men really do like quiche! Nothing too delicate here though; this is a VERY hearty dish! After all, there is bacon, ham, cheese, sour cream, half & half, and eggs.... All are ultra-rich! BUT, you can slim it down some by using "reduced fat sour cream", half real eggs with half egg beaters and low fat cheeses. Trust me, it will STILL taste extremely rich, even when subbing some of these lower fat alternatives!!! I used green peppers in place of mushrooms, because I do not eat the nasty fungus! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and WOW! It was outstanding! I think the addition of the sour cream to the spinach is what makes this exceptional. Just be certain to drain all the liquid from the spinach so your quiche won't be soggy. THANK YOU, Clark for an excellent recipe!

This is a really great recipe!  I made this recipe with just one basic variation for the ladies tea at my church and it dissapeared!  Even the men who were serving us loved it!
The one adjustment that I made was to substitute equal weight measurement of chopped broccoli flowerettes for the spinach since we were already having a spinach salad.  I also mixed it up a couple of days ahead of time before I baked it in the crust.  That set all the flavors in motion and was wonderful.  
My next variation on this quiche will be to use one or the other of the meat as the Ham seems to take over and hides the bacon.  
I also used the cream cheese crust recipe I found here in All Recipes and found it to be  super simple and a very easily workable crust that went perfectly with this quiche.

5 stars for taste!  I made as directed and would make the following recommendations - cook the pie crust a little first, not bother sauting the onion mixture, and watching the top for browning.  In my oven, the quiches cooked for an hour.  Thanks for a keeper!

I rarely review recipes, but this one was too good to pass on...you must try it!
I love this recipe, you can't go wrong.  I always double the eggs, spinach, sour cream and heavy cream and make 4 quiches.  Great frozen and reheated.  Thank you Clark!

Re: mushy crusts.  Layer the bottom layer with the ham, then the mushrooms, before adding the more liquid layers.  Also use whole cream instead of half-and-half it is also less watery.

The sour cream was a new addition to quiche for me.  But, it is now a necessity.  You are only limited by your imagination when it comes to adding meat and vegetables.  I make meatless for some family members, only bacon and cheese for some or throw in cooked roast beef, turkey, chicken or whatever I have on hand.  Clean out your refrigerator and toss in dabs of leftover vegetables for a wonderful surprise dish!  My family loves quiche and a salad and the leftovers are just as good tomorrow!  I'm making 8 for a family reunion next weekend.  They are great cold, too.

I deinitely LOVED this recipe, however I used 1/2 the amount of ham and bacon and used 2 9" deep dish pies to make it. I also used 1/2 as much cheese but I substituted 2% reduced fat cheeses to make it lower fat. I also used 1/3 more spinach. I found that it improved in flavor the longer I kept it in the refrigerator so If you need to prepare a meal for brunch it would be in your best interest to compile the ingredients and bake it fr 1/2 of the alloted time at least a day ahead and freeze it. Just before you need to serve it then put it in the oven for the rest of the time. I highly recommmend it as is, but I modified it because I am a WW.

This has made me famous! :)
The big change I make is I only use Swiss cheese, no other kind. I use 16 oz total and people love it. I also add a little nutmeg to the egg mixture. When I have been out of sour cream, I have subbed for (very) softened cream cheese with the same great results. 
I also make this with home made pie crusts. 
Very time consuming in all (including the time to make the crusts) but always worth it!

I'm so glad I listened to you Clarke! I made two pies worried that it may be two much quiche but when I noticed that before the day was over my husband had already eaten half of one I was so happy I made two! His family also loved the quiche! The only thing I did differently was to omit the salt... enough salt comes from the bacon and the the cheeses. Also I added basil to the spinach and sour cream mixture. Delicious!!

I made four deep dish quiches with this recipe (I increased it only just a tad since everyone was saying it made a lot).  I gave two away and kept two myself - heehee.  Been having it for breakfast or lunch each day - and sending hubby to work with it, too.  Really tasty - will make it again for sure :)

Delicious! I followed the recommendation to blind bake 2 deep dish crusts and was also prepared with a backup 1 1/2 qt casserole sprayed with nonstick for the overflow.  I filled both crusts and made another crustless quiche in the casserole, cooked in my convection microwave while the quiches were in the oven.  Now I know I can make it crustless and it is fabulous too.  I froze the 2 pies, put them in the fridge the night before serving to houseguests, and heated at 325 for about 40 minutes. Delicious!  Next time I'm not sure I'll use both bacon and ham, should be fine with either. I also am thinking of using prosciutto crumbles instead.

This recipe was great! The only amendments I made were as follows: cut it in half, used a deep dish pie crust, pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes, reduced the half and half slightly, baked for 45 minutes, and mixed all ingredients rather than layering. It was the best recipe I've ever made.

This quiche had wonderful flavor.  It was much chunkier and less custard than a typical quiche - but, really good.  I made exactly as is, but, without mushrooms because I didn't have any.  Next time I will be sure to add them in. Thanks for the tips from other reviewers to use deep dish crusts - you definitely need them.  I served with a simple green salad.

I made Clarks Quiche for mothers day brunch, it was fabulous! I changed a few things, instead of half and half I used whole cream, and I added some white cooking wine while I saut√©ed the onions and mushrooms, and I made some hollandaise to top when I served it!  So so good! Also I used a 9x13 pan, I just added more crust! There is some much of 
this that the pan was a perfect size! Thanks Clark I will definitely put this in my special collection!

This was very good! I followed advise from others and pre-cooked the pie crusts for 5 mins. before filling them. I also used fresh baby spinach that I sort of cut up before adding to the sour cream & s&p. It was easy and tasted fine. I have to say, they smelled delish while cooking and there is a good chance that I will be making this again.

This is the best quiche I have ever had, and the first one I have ever made from scratch.  I subbed Canadian Bacon for the ham and smoked Gouda for the Monterey Jack; I did not have any mushrooms this round, but I will be sure to get those in the next time.  Even after waiting 45 minutes after they were cooked (it was postponed for trick or treating because of the amount of time prepping the ingredients) and staying in a (200 degree) warm oven, it was still a huge hit with my husband and 9-year-old.  The three of us ate one whole quiche, and will eat the other for dinner tonight.   Great recipe!  It realistically can take an hour to prep and get into the oven, if you are not using pre-prepped ingredients.  Cooking/cooling/chopping the bacon and chopping the "ham" and defrosting/drying the spinach and grating the cheeses, and cutting the onion and not even mushrooms took me over an hour.   Be sure to use deep-dish pie pans, as Clark added in his review.   I am noting the prep time as 60 minutes and the "ready in" time to be 2 hours.

My husband jokes around saying real men don't eat quiche..well now that he tried this..he thinks the name should be changed because he thought it was YUMMY and wants to remain a real man!!!  Only changes were I used 2 deep dish frozen pie crusts that I baked 7 minutes prior to cooking.  I left out the mushroom and added instead cut up zucchini and broccoli from my garden.  I used fresh parsley as well and ofcourse..you can't leave out the garlic.  My pie crusts were stuffed..just be careful to pour the egg mixture on the cheese SLOWLY..or it will just spill right off the sides.  I didn't use as much cheese and don't think you really need it all.  If you were to use it all I would make three pies instead.  GREAT SHARE!

awsome!!!! i used Marie Calendars deep dish pie shells, and I did not add as much ham, cheese, etc (seemed like alot) I put everything but the egg mixture in the pie shells then poured the egg mix over it till just about 3/4 full.  Baked up great, froze one for about two weeks and it was great when reheated. Seems like a very easy recipe to change the flavors as you desire.

My children (16 and 11) H. A. T. E. quiche and said this was the greatest thing EVER.  I have nothing else, really, to say.  That says it all.

It has earned its place of honor on the monthly rotation schedule!  Thank you!

The flavoring was very good.  I would however cut back on some of the cheese, I don't feel it is very neccessary to have as much as the recipe called for.  Also, I don't it need both the bacon and the ham, I would suggest having one or the other.  I used green onions instead of regular onions and used a few dashes of cayanne pepper to add an extra zing.
I again would suggest cutting back on a few ingredients because I ended up making a total mess of my oven.  The quiches ended up overflowing.
I admit I did like this recipe and I will make it again but I will modify to more of my liking. It was also very easy to make and my boyfriend and his 10 year old son absolutely loved it.  His son was giving my hugs and kisses for making it.

This was fantastic! Made it and froze it a week before company came and they loved it!  I used two Marie Callendar 9" deep dish pie crusts.  I had leftovers as well--next time I'll make a third.  I wasn't crazy when reading about the layers and not having a good ratio of ingredients since there's too much liquid, so I mixed everything together before pouring it in the crust.  This worked great--even, homogeous distribution of ingredients and it was thick so I filled the crusts up and nothing ran over.  I thawd the quiche and then heated one in 325 oven for 40 minutes.  The remainder I just microwaved the subsequent days.

The flavor, consistency, etc. was amazing. This will be my go-to quiche recipe.

To speed things up I bought pre-diced onions and ham, shredded cheddar, and sliced mushrooms.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave as I always do, so it wasn't that time consuming.  Well worth it!

Great recipe.  Do avoid soggy crusts I usually bake the shell for about 10 minutes before adding the ingredients.  Also, make sure ALL of the water is out of the spinach or in my case....I use fresh.

I am not a fan of eggs, but I do like them mixed with other things and this quiche was better than I had ever tasted in any restaurant.  I also add some diced ham which I carmelize with the onions.  Lots of flavor

The measurements are correct for a deep dish glass pie plate. I made one quiche only (but will make another one next week for the office), using the recipe for "Best Ever Pie Crust" for the crust. I think I'd omit or reduce the amount of bacon next time; I thought it too overpowering. Other than that, this is a very good quiche recipe. **EDITED** I just made two of these quiches for work and won raves. I omitted bacon (subbed with more mushrooms) and cut down on the parmesan to reduce the strong salt flavour. I added garlic also. I think I will continue to make it with these modifications. I had one person say they're not really a quiche person, but they loved it. Also, another person pronounced this the best quiche he's ever had!

To be completely honest, when my husband and I ate this hot from the oven, I was really disappointed.  It tasted like scrambled eggs, bacon, and ham--that's all.  I thought it was really salty and basically a waste of an hour's work.

HOWEVER, the next day, it suddenly turned FABULOUS.  I guess all the stuff had time to meld together because suddenly I could taste a little spinach, a little ham, a little cheese, all mixed together.  This will definately become a staple in my house.

Next time, though, I won't use both ham and bacon--one or the other is enough.  Also, I'll cut down on the egg topping because it was still a little eggy and took an additional 28 minutes to cook up in my oven than 40 minutes (although I used a deep quiche pan, so that's understandable).  Also, instead of putting all the cheese in the quiche, I'll reserve some next time to sprinkle on top so it looks less like an egg pie.

Overall, great recipe--especially the next day!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made it for my in-laws during a visit and they loved it!  We ate a quiche & an half.  I gave the rest to my neighbors to try and they loved it as well.  The only thing I did different was use "Tastefully Simple Bacon Bacon" bacon bits, (my mother-in-law really watchs her diet) and omited the ham (I didn't have any).  I also didn't cook the spinach first.  It worked out perfectly... there wasn't any left!!  I also added a bit of garlic.  I am making this recipe on again on Saturday for a brunch I am having. Revised: 4/4/12 I made this quiche last night for breakfast this morning.  I made it as directed this time, halfing the recipe.  FABULOUS!  The only thing I would do differently next time is omit the extra salt.  Between the bacon, ham & cheese, I feel it would be salt enough.

This was wonderful!! I have tried several other recipes and this was the best (better the next day!) It was easily adaptable and easy to make. I left out mushrooms and bacon and my kid each had two helpings. Make sure you use 9 inch pie crusts though! Great flavor

This turned out amazing for me! I did some substitutions based on what I had on hand but the basics of this recipe are great.  
Best thing about Quiche is you can use whatever veg you have around! I didn't have mushrooms, bacon, ham or enough spinach. Instead I used chicken breast, onion, asparagus, cauliflower and red pepper with the little bit of spinach I had.
Passed the boyfriend test and will make it again!!

I rarely cook and I made this for the first time on Mother's Day expecting 20 people.  I followed the directions exactly and this was FABULOUS!  My guests were talking about this for days after Mother's Day.  I was told it was beginner's luck and would never be repeated.  I plan on making this every Mother's Day because the recipe is so well constructed I am 100% confident I can have complete success once again.  This is probably the best recipe I ever found on this site. Thank you Clark for posting it!

This was great!  Even the kids that would never eat spinach ate this...and loved it!  I would not change a thing.  I did use deep dish pie crusts, and poured the egg mixture a little at a time and allowed it to sink into the cheese before pouring more.  The crusts were very full when I put them in the oven, and did overflow a little, but the baking sheet caught the run off.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe, we will definately make it again!

This was very yummy!!  I took the egg whites from 1 egg and a teaspoon of water and brushed the pie crust before baking. I prebaked the pie crust at 375 for 10 minutes.   You will not get a soggy crust this way.  I also only used 6 eggs and it turned out perfect.  I layered all ingredients as stated in recipe.  I only added a pinch of salt to the spinach and sour cream mixture, other than that, you do not need the extra salt.  The bacon, ham and cheese have plenty of salt, and you can always add salt later.  Thanks!

I did everything as posted in the recipe and it was a disaster when it should have been a wonderful treat for Father's Day Brunch. Only the top 1/4 of the pie was cooked, even after baking for 40 mins. and settling outside the oven for 10 mins. We could only salvage the quiche by scraping off the top 1/4 of the pie and eating that and even that was mediocre.

Prep time took longer than I expected and this made a ton of filling.  I did scale it back to make just one pie but still had more than enough filling.  Husband loved it.  Thanks for sharing.

I'm not looking at another quiche recipe, ever.. the best! Used almost all organic ingredients. I omitted the bacon. I used fresh rainbow chard cut into strips instead of spinach and mixed it into the onion mixture seconds before I removed it from the burner; chard wilts quickly. I added chopped garlic to onion mixture. I used pre-cooked thickly sliced quality pork roast that I bought from the deli and cubed it. I used MARIE CALENDER Deep Dish pie crusts. Reduced amount of half and half. Omitted Monterey Jack cheese (not necessary). Reduced the total amount of cheese; you simply don't need so much. You can tell while you're grating how much you need. I actually can't wait for my in-laws to visit so I can make this for them :) THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!

Exellent recipe. Simple enough to whip together with the help of my little kitchen helper. I omitted the meat because I didn't have any and threw in bacon bits on top just before cooking. Turned out great. So good in fact that my 2 year old asked for another piece and even had leftovers for breakfast-spinach included! Definitely will make again meat added.

Delicious!  I used 2% (or was it 1%?) milk with no problems; I just made sure that I beat well the 7 eggs that I used. I cut back on the cheese amounts (about 4oz each) and just used the cheese I had in the house: sharp cheddar & provolone in addition to the parmesian.  I think it needs stronger flavored cheeses because of all the competing flavors in this quiche.  I didn't have ham, so I used bacon only, and I defrosted a brick of spinach to add (made sure it was *very* dry).  Baked in two deep dish frozen crusts--I baked them in advance for about 8 or so minutes, then added the ingredients.  Per several other reviews, I did sprinkle some of the cheese on the bottom of the crust to further firm it up before adding everything else.  I premixed all of the remaining ingredients and just poured it all in; I didn't do it by layers.  I covered the pies with tented foil to prevent the crust from over browning but removed the foil in the last 20 min or so to brown the filling. I baked for about about an hour.  Lovely quiche, I froze one it held up really well.

This is a fabulous recipe for quiche!  It is very forgiving if you want to play with the fillers too and use different combinations of vegetables and meats.

I reate this recipe four stars. It had a wonderful taste, but the crust was soggy for some reason. I used the frozen deep dish crusts, and made the recipe exactly as it read. Was I supposed to cook the crust before filling? Perhaps the sour cream from the spinach mixture made it soggy? Or the water from the mushrooms?

I made this last night and my whole family just loved it! Even the spinach was gobbled up by my picky 7 year old. The only problem i ran into was thingredients overflowing out of the pie dish. I will use a deep dish next time. GREAT quiche!! will make again!!

Major drawback is that the deep dish is NOT specified enough.  I have egg and cheese all over my baking sheet (it's still in the oven), which I'm not thrilled about.  It sure does smell good, though.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I have made many, many quiches and this is by far the best. I did not add the ham. That was the only change I made. This is definitely a keeper. Delicious!!

Very good but makes a lot. Sometimes I freeze one or give it to my husband to take to work. I have omitted the spinach and parmesan before when I didn't have either one on hand, and it still comes out really tasty. I'm not a big fan of eggs either and I really enjoyed this recipe!

I changed the recipe up a bit. I cut it in half so that I wouldn't have too much left over.  I also cut the ham and just did bacon. I used fat free half and half and fat free cheese. 

It was fantastic! I want more but I already had enough. It is so good .. there was some spice missing but not sure what.

This was very good and enjoyed by most of the family.  Made it just as written except I pre-baked crusts 10 minutes and used cheddar and swiss (it's what I had).  Like the layering but will probably not do it next time.  I'm not a fan of onions and have to bury them in stuff so finding a layer of them was unappealing to me.  The taste was good though.

Very good. The taste was phonominal but next time I will add more eggs as it fell apart when scooping it out so it didn't hold that quiche texture. I will make it again though for sure!

Hello Mr. Clark,  this was absolutely wonderful. I did make some changes... I did not have half and half or the mushrooms so I used cream of mushroom soup. I took a couple of slices to work today, and they want me to bring the other pie.. Thank you for the great recipe!

Made this for a baby shower brunch this morning and got rave reviews.  I left out the ham and mushrooms and used 2 packages of Kroger bacon crumbles to save time and mess.  I did cook my pie crust first for 10 mins as some other reviewers had suggested and my crust was not soggy. I also let it cook 45 minutes as others had suggested.  I will absolutely make again. Thanks Clark!

I give this recipe 5 stars BUT the prep time is significantly more than 15 minutes.  It's more like an hour and 15 minutes.  I challenge any seasoned chef to prepare this in 15 minutes.  My family feels like all the effort is well worth it.

Clark is a genius!  This quiche is the BEST I've ever baked myself OR had.  You can substitute ANY of the add-ins (like ham, bacon, spinach, etc) for anything else.  I've made this recipe with sausage & onion, and with bacon & broccoli and many other variations.  It always turns out wonderful! I'm SO glad I stumbled upon this recipe-- and you will be too!

The ratings are well deserved -- this is a great quiche. I've made it three times, tweaking each time. We tried first with ham, but our favorite was browned breakfast links cut into about four pieces.

The first time, I mixed the spinach mixture with rest. Next time, I tried layering and the wife said it had too much spinach. Last time, I mixed it all together again (same amounts of everything) and she thanked me for cutting back on the spinach.

I've found there's too much filling for regular shells, but just enough for deep dish. I also covered the tops with foil last time for about half of the cooking time and while they weren't as browned when done, the cheese was much easier to cut through with a fork the next day when microwaved.

This is the perfect symphony of ingredients for a delicious quiche!!  I have made it 4 times now, and I do have to agree that 3/4 of the cheese mixture is more than enough and overflow is almost always an issue....so be sure to place on a foil lined cookie sheet.  That could just be the result of different pie crusts...I used a 9 inch deep dish Albertson's brand all 4 times.  Also, I used fresh chopped parsley instead of dried, and it looks beautiful! Look for my uploaded quiche photo.  No need to use olive oil to soften onion...just use the grease from the bacon...MUCH better flavor!  In the end, the ingredients come together for an amazing taste!  Love the sour cream toss with the spinach (or I used broccoli once for a change...delicious!) Now I'm getting requests for this in place of Birthday gifts!!!  
Thank you, Clark!!  :)

So good!
I took out all the meat and added more spinach and mushrooms. I also used the shredded "mexican" blend mixed with shredded mozzerella instead of the cheddar and monterey jack.
The prep was way longer than 15 minutes. I also cooked it for an addition 5-10 minutes.
And like the other posters, I used a frozen deep dish pie crust (I let it defrost while I was prepping).
I served this at a brunch with bagels and fruit. No one touched the bagels. It was all about the awesome quiche!

Quite rich but very good.  I would cut down on the sour cream layer next time.  Will make again though - with a few adjustments to tailor to my taste.

wonderful! made this to take to my sister-in-laws for Mothers Day and everyone raved on how good it was. I followed the recipe just as described. I wouldn't change a thing. It did make 3 8 inch frozen deep dish pie crust without over flow, if i'd had 9 inch pie crust i would have been able to make 2 pies.  Thank You for a wonderful recipe!!

While we liked the flavour of this quiche, it didn't turn out exactly as expected.  Following the suggestion of one other reviewer, I omitted the bacon and increased the amount of ham - don't do this (ham takes up more volume than bacon), so in the end there was just not enough room for the eggs!  Next time I make this, I will decrease the amount of ham and add the bacon as per the recipe - hopefully this will work better.  One final observation is that the pie crust should be partially baked before adding the ingredients - the bottom crust of the pastry didn't cook very well.

This was really good.   I scaled this down to make only one quiche and used a deep dish pie shell.  However I had a mess in my oven.  Almost all the egg mixture bubbled out of the pie shell.  Next time i will try leaving out the spinach and not layer the ingredients in the shell. Instead mixing them all together prior to pouring in the shell, this way i can leave out the extra amout that will not fit and still get some eggs in the quiche.

I agree with the other reviews - this is an excellant quiche, however, the filling is enough for 3 or 4 quiches.  I bought frozen deep dish pie crust and it was overflowing and I cut the cheese and filling in 1/2.   I would buy 4 pie crusts and divide all the filling ingredients among them.  Increase the egg/half-n-half mixture by 1 1/2 or 2 times and freeze the extra quiches.  I also used fat free sour cream and fat free half-n-half and you could not tell the difference at all!  Loved the recipe, Got rave reviews from everyone. I will make again and again.

This quiche is so delicious you won't  want to make any other recipe.  I left out the ham because I didn't have any.  It was so perfect that I wouldn't add it in the future. 
I paired it with a light salad consisting of Boston lettus   tomato,  apples,  walnuts,  cheddar,  parmesan, a little olive oil,  a sprig of basil.

I did not think I had deep dish pie plates, so I planned for 3 quiches and ended up having to add a couple more eggs and some more half and half.  So people saying they had too much for 2 must be using those little foil throwaway ones.  I have never made quiche and I'm a terrible cook and this recipe turned out awesome!!  I baked my crusts for 10 min the night before on 350 and then put in the egg mixture.  I made 3 different ones:  brocolli(frozen), cheese, onion; bacon, spinach(fresh), tomato, cheese; and ham and cheese.  put in fridge overnight and then baked for 1 hr on 350.  I had to put foil strips around edges the last 15 min to keep them from getting too dark.

This was my first time making Quiche. I have to say I was pretty impressed with myself I didnt follow the recipe exactly but fairly close. My family loved it they ate 2-3 slices each. I am looking forward to trying different ingredients. We will be making this more often.

Yummy!! I only use bacon (nitrate free) and skip the onions and mushrooms (pregnancy preferences) and leave everything else as is. This dish extremely versatile and forgiving. Add what you like and take out what you don't and there's no worry. this has become a breakfast staple for our house. I've made about 6 within the last two months and there's just the two of us here!!

Made this quiche for the office this morning.  It is slowly disappearing entirely.

Didn't make any changes--wanted to judge it based on the real recipe.  Would maybe saute garlic next time.

Overall, awesome!

Amazing! The prep work is well worth it. And like all the other reviewers have said, CUT DOWN ON LIQUIDS. I reduced mine to 3 eggs and 2/3 cup half and half and it was still too much.

I think the recipe should call for deep dish 9 in. pie shells.  I followed the measurements exactly, yet couldn't fit all the ingredients into the purchased frozen pie shells.  Only 2/3 of cheese and 1/2 the eggs were put in. Then the eggs overflowed onto the cookie sheet.  Tastes Great though, cooked the rest of the eggs and ate with the quiche.

I loved this recipe and will make it again and again!  I made the quiche just like the instructions except I mixed the onion/ham mix with the spinach and cheeses before adding to the pan instead of layering.  I had a hard time fitting all of the egg mixture and had to throw a little away, but it turned out great! The whole family LOVED it! It made a great Father's Day breakfast!  I also pre-baked the pie crusts a bit and it still wasn't totally done on the bottom at the end.  I recommend browning the bottom and wrapping the top in tin foil so it doesn't brown before adding filling.

I'd actually give this 4.5 stars but that's not an option.  I definitely like the taste but I'm not fond of the layering.  I made it crustless and although I squeezed the water out of the spinach pretty well, it was still too liquidy but that may have been due to the mushrooms also.  It would have been much better (personally) if everything was mixed together.  Didn't like the solid layer of cheese at the top that after cooling and reheating, became it's own layer.  I will try it again making adjustments!

This is probably a very good quiche recipe, but I've finally decided that I am not a quiche kind of girl. The spinach mixture was tasty at the bottom, but the bottom crust was mushy (and I don't think there's a fix).

rich and delicious, but the bottom crust didn't get well cooked, and it does have a different texture than a "regular" quiche, and so might be off-putting for the quiche purist.

I LOVED this quiche!! This is the first time I made a quiche and it turned out fantastic!! I made it Christmas morning and it warmed my Soul!! I love the combination of flavors. I've been thinking of ways to lighten it up by maybe using lite ingredients (lite sour cream, half/half and cheese). The quantity of ingredients split evenly to make two full quiches. It was DIVINE!! Thanks for sharing this wonderful meal!!

This was very good. It was easy to make, but did take some time to prep. Will definitly make again, but will probably cook the pie crust a few minutes before adding the other ingredients next time so it is not soggy.

This is seriously DELISH!..and my only go to quiche recipe I will keep, and you can always omit this and that to customize the smaller ingredients to what you like.. For me. I omitted the spinach, simply because I didnt have any, I also omitted the Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese and did simpley cheddar and mozzarella. I added fresh chives, and rosemary and parsley instead, and this quiche was a hit..there were no leftovers to speak of.

Cooked the quiche exactly as specified in the recipe. It tasted good but took FOREVER to make. I actually think I prefer a more simple quiche -- a little ham, mushrooms & Swiss. This one seemed to have WAY too much going on. It was a little heavy and overwheming and I won't be making it again. Not worth the effort.

Quoting Sully because I feel the same way: way too much sour cream and spinach mixture, way too much cheese, and way too many eggs and cream. I only used 1/2 of the egg mixture for 2 deep dish 9" crusts.  And more egg mixture poured out while cooking cause there was no room with all the other ingredients. Will never make again.

Absolutely delicious.  The Prep time and the cooking time at the top are wrong.  It take me about 45 minutes to prep and 40 minutes to cook.  I find that it needs 2 deep dish pie crust and 1 regular pie crust.  I also, sauteed the onions and  mushrooms then added the frozen spinach and cooked the water from the spinach.  Then put all ingredents into a bowl and measured out about 2 1/2 cups into each pie crust, then it didn't spill out.

This is awesome! Easy to make, tastes fabulous, and looks very impressive. I used deep dish already made pie crust (from the grocery freezer section) and did three total to fit the crowd I was feeding.  Just use the whole dozen eggs and 2 cups half&half.  I made one with bacon, one with ham and one with zucchini (no meat)and extra mushrooms. I made them for a work function so I baked them the night before, popped the aluminum dish off the next morning and microwaved it. A big hit with everyone.

I made this for Easter brunch this morning and it was sensational! I made a few alterations; instead of spinach I used broccoli and for the cheeses, I used gouda and gruyere. I omitted the onion but think I may add a bit of it next time. Also, next time I am not going to place it on a cookie sheet because the bottom was a tiny bit undercooked.  Very tasty quiche--a keeper! Update: I have made this recipe many, many times now and it is absolutely fool-proof and THE best quiche you will ever eat. I now make it with broccoli, ham and I mix up the cheeses. I also sprinkle about 1 T. dried onions in the egg mixture to give it that hint of onion that makes this so good. Excellent recipe!

I decided to prepare this Quiche for a dinner party despite the fact that I had never tried it - crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.  It was wonderful.  All guests raved and asked for the recipe.  I made a few substitutions that worked out great:  I used fresh spinich instead of frozen (put into the recipe raw), portabella mushrooms, raw diced green onion with tops and fresh parsley. I omitted the ham completely, and pre-baked the pie crusts for 10 minutes before adding the filling.  It was heavenly. I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks, Clark!

DELISH!!!  made this for my husband today for a valentines breakfast.  he LOVED it!  i 1/2'd the recipe for just one pie.  Used a premade refrigerated crust and pre-baked for 10min prior.  glad i did - would have came out soggy if not.  Careful on the "salt to taste"...i used a few dashs but will use a lot less next time! (i had forgotten how salty the cheese is!)

Verrry good quiche! 
I made this exactly by the recipe. Next time I will pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes as previous reviewers have advised. I won't add any extra salt, the ham makes it salty enough. I might cut back on the amount of sour cream, it's very rich. And I'll be sure to "finely" dice the ham. Also, if you're making this on a time schedule, you can get the ingredients diced and ready the night before so it won't take as long in the morning!
All in all, Thanks Clark for the yummy quiche!!

Holy Quiche!!  I made this as my first attempt at homemade quiche yesterday...  absolutely fantastic!!  I did cut the recipe in half, as I was only cooking for my husband and I, but it set up perfectly, and I had absolutely no problem with overflow in my 9-inch deep dish.  I did make a few minor adjustments to my taste...  added chopped green and red peppers to the ham mixture, and a layer of very finely diced jalepenos between the ham and cheese mixtures for an added boost.  Absolute perfection!!

this quiche is so easy to make and is absolutely delicious.  I used the pillsbury refrigerated pie dough and pre-baked it for about 5 minutes.  I used a regular 9-inch pie pan and the filling filled up perfectly - no overflow.  The key to making all the ingredients fit is to finely chop everything.

We made the quiche again, but this time with whatever leftovers we had in the fridge - celery, ham, pepperoni, onions, shredded cheese, etc.  I pre-baked the pie dough for 7 minutes since I thought 5 minutes was too short last time.  We finely chopped everything and sauteed them in a pan over medium heat for a few minutes.  We had medium eggs instead of large eggs, and it took about 6 medium eggs.  The quiche turned out great!

Good Quiche, but I think I should have mixed all of the ingredients together instead of the layer effect.  But always top with cheese.  :)

Definitely better the next day.  Bake it the night before, then reheat in the oven the next day.  Only problem is that I couldn‚Äôt pour the egg mixture through all that cheese.  Next time Ill pour the egg first then top w/ cheese.

It was pretty good although I think I would dry out the spinach more by cooking it in a frying pan.  I do that with another quiche recipe and I like the way it taste.  My husband who usually hates quiche loved this recipe because he said it tasted more like a casserole than a quiche.

Really liked this recipe-- and I usually don't like quiche! But it was really impressive looking and my friend and I gobbled it right up with a fresh green salad. I used turkey bacon instead of regular because she's kosher and substituted broccoli for spinach and everything came out wonderfully. The crust of mine was a little mushy, but that certainly wasn't the recipe's fault and the quiche still held together well. All in all, A+, will be using again!

This turned out terrific!  I followed the recipe as written.  I made it the night before and then just warmed it up in the morning. (One slice covered with Saran Wrap in the microwave for 1 minute was perfect.)  I think I will try with with brocolli instead of spinach next time (although the spinach was great).  I would also cook it just a tad longer.

Two thumbs WAY HIGH UP!!!  We loved this.  I made a few minor modifications: I did not cook the spinach, just thawed and drained, didn't use mushrooms (don't like them), used 3/4 lb bacon and less ham, a 12 oz can of fat free evaporated milk instead of half-and-half, and I mixed everything together instead of layering in case of overflow(which didn't happen).  I was planning on freezing one, but we loved it so much that we kept it out for leftovers!  Definite keeper.

I‚Äôm glad I scaled this recipe in half to only make one quiche because it wasn‚Äôt that good (then again, maybe I just don't like quiche). Mine did not set up and was runny, but was firmer and had better flavor and texture the next day. Definitely make this the day before. I left out the bacon because I had a lot of ham. I also used fresh spinach and reduced-fat sour cream.

I've never made quiche before and could use some help. I made this and froze 2 for church breakfast this Sat (one week). How do I prepare to serve then? Thaw when? Microwave for how long?
Sorry to have to post here but I can't find anyone that knows!  This was very good and I will make again.  Thanks

Amazing! I got scared when the bottom looked as if it was raw, but someone made me realize it was the sour cream that created that effect. It was delicious. Thanks for the instructions for freezing it, it worked out great.

This was an outstanding dish. Hope you dont mind but I left the spinach out.  Not a green eater.  Also I used portabella mushrooms which added a hearty flavor.  Very good though and I will definitely make it again. (Even better since the rest of the family doesnt eat mushrooms, all mine.)

This was just fantastic! A little more involved than a regular run of the mill quiche and SOOOOO worth the effort! (I actually saved time by buying frozen crusts, which I NEVER do)My family LOVED it...I made one without mushrooms and it was great too. I personally liked all the cheese in it but to each his own. What a great way to get kids to eat a healthy meal :) Thanks

I will say this was a delicious recipe. My only downside is that the 15 min prep time is far inadequate for the time required.

Unless you are buying all pre-made components of this recipe, consider an hour of prep time to get all the ingredients chopped, cooked, sauteed, etc.

This quiche is awesome!  I made it for a party and did not even get to eat any because it was gobbled up so fast!  Fortunately, I still had the second one at home..... I used 2 deep dish pie crusts and there was still not enough room for all of the ingredients.  I think next time I will make 3 pies using the same amount of ingredients.

Best quiche recipe! I use fresh spinach, cut back on the sour cream and add some blue cheese.

I wanted a spinach quiche and only had some of the ingredients called for. With all the 5 star ratings, I figured how bad could it be? I only had one pie shell and no ham or mushrooms, so I scaled the recipe for 1 pie. This was fantastic! I have used several quiche recipes from this site, but this was the best by far. I think the sour cream and parsley add to the flavor. Will try it again soon with all the required ingrediences -minus the ham, just a personal preference.

Perfect recipe just like it is. Everyone's taste buds were enjoying this meal we had for  dinner tonight.  Served with rolls and a fruit/walnut salad.  Perfectly satisfying for dinner with 4 of us eating one pie. Note: Watch the liquid you pour into shells,  just a little to much for my 2 deep dishes.  Keeping left over to scramble in the morning. And with all the shredding, dicing, sauteing & mixing it took 30+ minutes prep time,  not 15.  :)

This is a great basic recipe! I HATE it when people review a recipe, but then change a bunch of things. With that being said. I changed a bunch of things! It didn't seem to matter, because it is such a great basic recipe. So, here's what I did. I didn't have any cheddar cheese. I substituted Swiss cheese. I didn't have (and my husband doesn't like spinach). I used mushrooms and black olives instead. I had left over Christmas ham. I left out the bacon and added more ham. Finally I used heavy cream instead of half and half. As I said, this is a great basic recipe! You can feel comfortable changing things and it will turn out great!! BTW my husband loved it!

This has been my favorite quiche recipe for a few years.  It is always a hit.  Here are my tips:
1)  Partially pre-bake the crust first.
2)  Spread the spinach and sour cream layer over the pre-baked crust as directed.
3)  Mix the egg and half-and-half together.  Then add the rest of the ingredients into the egg mixture.  Mix the egg-milk-meat-veggie mixture before putting it all in the pie pan together.  (This keeps the egg mixture from sliding over the cheese layer out onto your counter.  It also avoids having to use a deep-dish pan.)  
4)  Per the internet, generally 8 ounces (1/2 pound) of shredded cheese equals two cups.  
5)  Since the crust is partially pre-baked, cover the edges of the crust with a strip of foil part-way through the baking.  
6)  Plan on a more than 15 minutes for prep time if you are doing your own chopping and shredding.

I wanted to do something different and tried this recipe...my first ever quiche. I love quiche, but had never tried to make it myself. My 14 yr old son hated the quiche he had previously tried but loved this - he ate 2 pieces. My 7 yr old ate all of his and asked for more. My husband actually likes quiche but said this was the best he's ever had, I agree. I did an egg wash (egg white + 1 tsp water) in pie crust and baked it for about 10 minutes then cooled and filled - the crust was not at all soggy. Also, house full of guys now that my daughter's gone, I used two pounds of bacon, omitted sausage and used fresh spinach omitting mushrooms. I sauteed onion in bacon drippings and when tender crisp added my fresh spinach (chopped about 3/4 of a 12 oz bag baby spinach) until it was just wilted. Used 6 oz shredded sharp cheddar, 6oz Mexican blend and 4 oz shredded Parmesan (instead of grated). Used heavy cream instead of half & half. I also mixed everything together instead of layering. Used 6 x-lrg eggs + yolk left from egg wash. Once pie crusts were filled I topped with just a little extra of all 3 cheeses and sprinkled on crushed dried rosemary. Cooked for 53 minutes. Just a few tweaks for our own taste, but the basis of this quiche is excellent. Prep time to consumption is well worth the effort, work, wait (about 2 hrs). DELICIOUS, EXCELLENT, WILL MAKE AGAIN. Variations should be easy as long as basics are followed.

I love this recipe! I have made it probably about 12 times now with a ton of varieties. I have never used the sour cream or meats, just because I usually will have meat on the side, when at home. I usually don't use as much cheese to save on calories and fat and it is still just as tasty. I make this on Sundays, for myself, sliced it up and brought a slice a day to work during the work week. It is so yummy & filling, it gets me through til lunch. Thanks Clark!

SO GOOD!

The only thing I did differently was leave out the bacon, because we had plenty of that on the side. It was the hit of the morning and both dishes were decimated by the time everyone left. 

It's a bit of work with the prep, but I will definitely be making again! EDIT: Made it again, this time left out the ham, because all I had was bacon, and I used almost a whole package. Instead of using pie tins, I filled a 9x13 cake pan. It was really good again, but after finishing 3 slices, my dad was surprised to hear there was bacon in it!

Clark makes a great quiche! After reading several reviews about the filling not fitting into the pie pan, I used a 9" round cake pan instead. This held the ingredients nicely. I also doubled the bacon because I didn't have any ham, used fresh spinach that I cooked down, green onions,  and substituted 1/4 cup of mayonnaise for the sour cream because I did not have any (after seeing it in several other quiche recipes).  I followed the advice of another review and pre-cooked the crust for 10 minutes to prevent it from getting soggy, and it turned out perfectly.  My only regret is that I halved the recipe and only made one quiche!!

I had to cook this longer then directed so that the center would come out done and this made the edge crust a bit dark but not inedible.  I could have covered the crust to prevent this. I think this is a problem of my very old oven.

I really loved this recipe! And even better, my boyfriend (who is a harsh critic) loved it too. Like others have said you can cut back on the cheese and eggs, there will be way too much for 2 deep dish crusts. I am happy to make this recipe again and again and excited to try new ingredients.

Fantastic - so much flavor!!  I changed the spinach to broccoli ‚Äì just cooked frozen chopped broccoli a little in microwave and squeezed it out.  And I didn‚Äôt do the ham, just doubled the bacon.  And I just sprinkled some parmesan, didn‚Äôt use 4 ounces.  And I left out the mushrooms and added red peppers to the onions while I saut√©ed them (in the bacon grease instead of the olive oil).  I added no salt - the additional bacon and cheese salted it enough in my concoction.  I've done it in a pie plate with a crust as well as crustless in a casserole dish - works well either way.  My go-to egg bake recipe now.  :)  Bacon browning tip - cut the slab of bacon up with a kitchen scissors and brown it like ground beef - easy!

this was so yummy!! very rich and creamy without being heavy. i used fresh spinach instead of frozen and left the ham a little more chunky for some texture. the way it's layered as you make it makes the two pies easy to prepare.

The taste is great! Not low fat, but I will try using low-fat substitutes next time. I must say that even using the deep dish pie crusts, the filling is still almost too much. I cut back on the half and half a pinch and used 7 eggs and was JUST barely shy of overflowing. Prep took a long time, but would be easier with leftover bacon (if there is such a thing in your house). Overall, super quiche!

Wonderful but I changed the amounts just based on what I had on hand and personal preference.  I had 2 deep dish crusts that I decided not to use.  Everything went in a large 10 x 13 (I think) dish.  Only had 7 eggs so I added a little more half n half.  1 lb bacon and leftover diced easter ham.  Had some black olives to use up and used a mexican cheese blend.  Next time I would definately double the spinach and 2 or 3 more eggs since I wasn't using pie crusts and need to fill the pan and use 2 cups of half n half.

This recipe had the potential to be awesome, however there was way too much filling/cheese/eggs to actually fit the pie crusts.  I tried to fit it all anyway and ended up making a huge mess and had almost a cheese breading on top of the quiche.  I should have made three with this recipe and it would have been perfect.

I used this for my first quiche, and this was a great recipe to try.  The sour cream was a nice touch to the recipe.  The only thing that I didn't like was that I had A LOT of filling leftover which I had to throw out, plus the quiche overflowed, leaving a hard to clean gunk on the pan that I had underneath it.  Changes I made:  1)  I saut√©ed diced green and red peppers w/ the onions.  2)  I used frozen broccoli, rather than the spinach.  3)  I didn't use mushrooms or ham.  4)  I used a pound of bacon.

This one deserves 10 stars! Make sure you pour the egg mixture into the 2 deep dish pie crusts VERY SLOWLY. There is so much wonderfulness going on that it is easy to overflow your shells. I find it helpful to take a fork and push the filling around a bit as you pour so the eggs soak all the way down. Freezes great...tastes like you made it fresh that day.

One of the BEST recipes on this site. Everyone is shocked by how good this is.  My family and friends especially love this when I add goat cheese crumbles instead of the montery jack. I mean....THAT is cooking for in your face flavor. Not timid at all. I sometimes add a 4.3 oz pkg. of  Hormel picnic (real) bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon. It's an easy shortcut. I've made this for company who THOUGHT they didn't like quiche and totally changed their minds:) My boyfriend gave some to his father...who said he would just have a little taste...and he ended up eating a huge piece!

I have to say this is the best quiche I have had in a while. I substituted sausage for the Ham and Bacon and cut the recipe in half to make one pie. I also had to make a gluten free pie crust since my husband is gluten intolerant...Was so good though, I went back for seconds!

Bakes up beautifully but is a bit too savory for our tastes with the bacon and the ham.

This turned out very very well! So yummy.
- I was working with what I had on hand, so I used a bag of fresh spinach and just chopped it up, then cooked it down in a little butter.
-I omitted the bacon and just used about 3.5 cups chopped ham.
-I omitted the mushrooms and added 1 chopped bell pepper (sauteed with onion).
-I used premade pie crusts from the deli section and did brush them with a little egg white and baked at 375 for 5 mins to avoid soggy crusts. 
Great recipe!

This Thanksgiving holiday was about the 5th time that I have made this recipe.  I have mini quiche pans and have made perfect, very flavorful breakfasts/brunches each time!  Thank you for sharing - didn't change a thing.

If I were reviewing on flavor alone, I would give 5 stars... but I feel like this recipe needs some twqeaking or perhaps futher instruction. I halved it, since I had never made a quiche before, I figured that I could see how one turned out and if it needed any changes then I could do that with the 2nd one. I'm glad I decided to make just one. 

I followed the recipe, almost to the "T". The only things I changed didn't matter, like leaving out the parm since we don't care for it. The flavor was excellent... but I'm concerned about the overall presentation.consistancy when removing it from the pan. I prebaked the pie crust and it was still soggy on the bottom. The spinach/sour cream mixture did not set because the egg just doesn't seep down that far. (I let this set for about 40 minutes in my fridge before baking) The egg barely went through the meat layer. So when cutting into this, the bottom where the spinach is kinda gave way to the top and caused every piece to fall, ruining the presentation when serving. 

I used a store bought 9", deep dish crust, and there was way too much of the meat mixture. It wouldn't all fit, and I wasn't able to put much cheese on top because of this. I used 4 eggs (since I only made 1 quiche), and the egg mixture went in to the pie no problem. I didin't experience any overflow except for a little drip here and there. It baked up beautifully, it was really pretty when it came out of the oven, but it was hard to cut and serve.

Great, although even with a store-bought deep dish pie crust the filling was way too much.  I would also reiterate baking the crust a bit before filling it.  The filling was delicious, though!

Delicious recipe (how could it not be with those ingredients?).  I used 2 frozen Marie Callender 9" deep dish crusts and the liquid still overflowed the pans.  I tried it again with 3 Callender 9" deep dish crusts and thought it was perfect.  It was not quite so rich the second time either.  Next time I will try using some low fat or turkey ingredients.  Very good recipe.

Best quiche recipe I've found,(now using Clark's hint to use deep dish crusts.) IF you missed the hint and have leftover mixture, treat yourself to a fantastic omlet, or pour into a shallow glass pie pan for a third quiche.

This was a wonderful quiche. I did use broccoli instead of spinach. My  husband loved it. He said my quiche before was great but he said this was the best recipe yet. I didnt tell him until after both pies were gone that it had sour cream in it (which he does not like) I love to trick him like that. :o) Thank you Clark for a wonderful recipe. When making my own crust and using deep dish pie pans I had just enough room in the pans, they didnt even drip over.

This makes an excellent quiche! Made it for a little get together with girlfriends and we just kept eating and eating it.    I didn't add bacon since I didn't have any, but I'm sure it would have added a great salty taste and crunchy texture.    I also added nutmeg since nutmeg and spinach go so well together.

I thought this was very good and like Clark said, made two. Now, would like to know how to reheat the one that is now in the freezer? I prepared most items ahead of time, but this is not a quick quiche to make. Didn't have mushrooms, but was excellent without them. Will make again.

Good stuff! Very time consuming to prep, but otherwise good! Only used 6 eggs, and that was more than enough in the deep dish crust I bought. Also prebaked my crust, and it still was a llittle mussy, but I may not have gotten all the liquid out of the spinach.  Didn't use all the cheese as that seemed like an overwhelming amount.  I didn't like how the cheese formed a crust over the top when cooled, and hubby said he would like a more eggy quiche.  I think next time I will mix everything all together instead of doing the layers.

delicious!  I used the deep dish crusts & still had too much filling (I ended up leaving out about 1/4 of the egg mixture) and it still came out great.  It was a huge hit in my house - Thanks for sharing :)

I made this quiche for New Years Eve dinner/breakfast.  I did not make any adjustments. This is possibly the best  quiche recipe I have tried so far. Make sure to use a deep dish pie crust.

Excellent Quiche!  Served it at Christmas brunch and it was a hit!  The only change I made was I replaced the bacon with sausage since my wife doesn't like bacon.  The sub worked out well.

Loved it!  Used turkey bacon, no ham, skim milk and substituted mozzerella for the MJ.

This is really the best quiche I've ever had... I doubled everything except the eggs and half-n-half, and it fit perfectly into my pie crusts with no spillover!!!! Loved it.

I would think you have to be a meat lover to enjoy this dish.  I am far more of a vegetable cheese lover so this dish just was not for me. All in all okay for meat lovers not watching their weight.  Too much pork for me.

YUMMY! and so easy to make....I have made this and substituted sausage for the bacon and cream cheese for the sour cream that is mixed into the spinach (just because that is what I had on hand at the time) it turned out just as wonderful!  Clark, Thank you so much for taking the time to share this recipe :-)

This one is a winner. Made it pretty much "as written". Skipped the bacon (didn't have any on hand) and the dried parsley (personal preference -- read: don't often see the point of parsley  :) ) Other than that, stayed "on recipe". End result was VERY tasty. Layering, especially the sour cream and spinach mixture, was a nice approach. "The Hubbs" isn't a mushroom fan, but given that they were finely diced, he didn't complain. Served it for an informal dinner with friends with salad and popovers (Grandma's recipe). Overall, it was a hit. Thanks for this recipe!

The order in which I combine: veggies, sour cream, cheese, eggs, milk. Delicious! So delicious, in fact, that my 9 year-old daughter is asking me to make it again. I use whatever veggies and cheese I have on hand.  I simply sautee the veggies with salt. The salt helps the veggies soften up faster. This time I used chopped onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms, broccoli (no stem) and threw in some chopped tomato at the end. Then I tossed in a couple handfuls of real bacon bits, added the fat free sour cream and shredded colby jack cheese and gave it a stir. Added the eggs and stirred again. Lastly the milk. This lightened version tastes marvelous. Even my vegetable hating son, enjoyed this - and that's saying A LOT!  I used frozen deep dish pie crusts and they worked perfectly. I baked them for 45 minutes in a convection oven on a sheet pan lined with foil to catch any spills - although not a drop was lost. Just bake until it's puffed, brown and set, like Clark said, and you can be enjoying this delightful quiche at any time of day. I love that it can be prepared ahead of time. Thanks so much Clark! My son will now eat his veggies! :-)

This is awesome.  I substitute sausage for the ham sometimes, but always come back to this.  Great recipe, and you do need to bake 2 or you will regret it.

This was fantastic! I omitted the mushrooms, ham and made it without the pie crust. I didn't miss the crust at all as the filling is pretty rich tasting, and I didn't have any problems with the bottom sticking to the dish. Using the measurements listed, I had enough filling to fill a 10 inch quiche dish and a 9 inch pie pan. I liked the sour cream and spinach in the recipe, those were new ingredients to me to include in a quiche. I will make this frequently.

This is the Daddy!  This is a Manly-Man Quiche!  I'd been searching for a rich, creamy, tasty quiche recipe and this is it!  The hunt is over!  Only thing I did different was saute my onions/mushrooms in butter instead of olive oil....love that butter flavor.  Thanks Clark for a great recipe!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! So do my husband, parents, in laws, brothers, nieces, nephews, coworkers, and anyone who has ever come by when I happen to make it. I make it at very least once a month and NEVER have leftovers! I typically use whatever cheese I have on hand and have sustituted cream cheese for the sour cream on occasion... I tend to just throw whatever I've got in the fridge into this quiche and it's never let me down! Kudos Clark! From me and my loved ones!

I didn't have a chance to taste this recipe, and that is why it deserves every one of these stars, due to the fact that all five of my kids completely cleaned the plates of this...twice.  It is very rare that even one of them has seconds, but unheard of that all of them wanted more.  I will have to make four next time so I can see what it tastes like.  Very simple to make, having had all the ingredients on hand already. Next time I will strain the spinach more carefully, to decrease the amount of liquid in the bottom. Still fantastic, or so I'm told.

I made this for a special Valentine breakfast for my husband and it was awesome! Heed all warnings to use a deep dish, it won't fit otherwise. The only change I made, besides cutting the recipe in half, was I mixed the Bacon mixture with the Spinach/Sour Cream mixture and was happy with that result. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow.  Every single step to this quiche was enjoyable. All they way up to my brunch guests' enjoyment.  Thank you for sharing!    Hint 1:  deep 8 " dishes are a must; two regular pie dishes will NOT contain this quiche recipe  Hint 2: letting the quiches sit for more than 5 minutes will help them solidify and make cutting easier.

Absolutely delicious! I agree with the reviewer that suggested pre-baking the crusts for a few minutes to avoid mushiness. I used fat-free and low-fat dairy products for this recipe to cut fat and calories and it was still absolutely amazing. I used Portobello mushrooms and otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.

GREAT quiche!  I served this TODAY for a brunch and it was a hit.  I used ALL of the ingredients but decreased the portions of ingredients somewhat to avoid spillage.  I do not understand how some people rate this as a 3 or 4 when they change the recipe around so much.  It's ridiculous and everytime I read one of these reviews I get so annoyed.  Just saying!

I was able to make 3 deep dish quiches from this recipe! Alot of flavors going on so it is sure to please the masses. I think I would make this one again, especially if I had to make a few at a time or just put in a pyrex pan without the crust and bake as a breakfast casserole.

i enjoyed this recipe. I attempted to make it exactly as is...but couldn't add the exact amount of cheese...too much! I only used 8oz blend of cheddar/monterey. Then sprinkled parmesean on top, about 1/4 cup. The reason only 3 stars..because the eggs didn't penetrate all the way to the bottom. The flavor of the eggs was delicious, however, the spinach mix on the bottom had no egg. The second time I made this recipe, I decided to saute the onion in 1 T of butter then added the frozen drained spinach, 10oz, then added the sour cream, bacon and pepper and salt. I added that mixture plus the cheeses to the eggs and then poured them into 2 deep dish pie crusts. Delicious!  Thanks Clark for the great recipe . I also make extra bacon when cooking on a Sunday morning and freeze for cooking. That will help cut down on prep time . The bacon freezes well

This is five-star fantastic.  I made it with high-end ingredients:  Neuske's hame and bacon, and real parmisiano reggiano.  It was stellar - the best quiche I've ever had.  Makes a ton.  I had to poke holes through the cheese and meat to get the egg mixture in there, but it was well worth the messiness.  Freezes very well and is even better that way!

Delicious!  Light and tasty.  My daughters, whom refuse to eat anything that is mixed all together, inhaled this!  The only modification I made was I added 1/2 t. of nutmeg.  (Which plays off nicely against the cheeses and bacon.)  Best quiche I've ever had.

I have just tried to make this recipe and it will not fit in two frozen bought deep dish pie crust. So I now in the middle of trying to make it with the cream cheese and spinach already in the crust also with the bacon and ham and other ingredients in the pie crust, have to stop and go get more pie crust. I will then review it when I am able to put all the ingredients in the correct amount of pie crust. It will be 3 if not 4. So I have no idea how he could say these fit in 2 crust.

Loved this!  Even if you want to sub out some of the additions to this recipe (ie: different meats/veggies, etc...) What a fabulous quiche!  The bottom mixture of spinach and sour cream is superb!  I also enjoyed the quiche the next day just as much if not better!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I froze my quiches for several weeks after baking so that I had an easy breakfast to serve guests.  I warmed them up in the oven and guests left with copies of the recipe.  Delicious.   Used Pillsbury pie crusts and own deep dish pans.

Very Good! I left out the meat in one of them for my Vegetarian Teenager, and it was also really good. The only thing I changed is I reduced the amount of salt. Will definitely make this again!

I actually thought this recipe was terrible.  The bottom crust was soggy, and the whole thing overall lacked flavor. Sorry!

This is outstanding!  I made these for a breakfast brunch for work and they were both gone. I used an applewood smoked bacon and it added a very good flavor to the quiche.

Clark- this was EXCELLENT!! I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars!  The flavor's are so delicious, the dish really could be used at any mealtime,(or a snack)!  The only thing I did different was I used a homemade pie crust.  I know it's more time consuming, but I have my great-grandmother's recipe, and if any dish calls for pie crust I do not think I could deviate from the homemade! I learned through the other reviews that this is intended for deep dish, I had the perfect pie dish, and no problems with overflowing!  I did not cut back on any eggs or cheeses.  I did end up using a little more spinach. I only made 1 pie though due to the fact it's just the 2 of us...and I had to stop my husband from devouring all of it in one sitting!  He didn't have enough good things to say about this!  One of the best recipes I have tried on this site!!!  Amazing job :)
This is a quick update: I forgot to mention that I did bae my pie crust for 10 mins. prior to filling.  This is a MUST step in my opinion.  Also, I would agree with many other reviewers by reducing or completely leaving out the added salt.  Either by just adding it the one time to the spinach mix or, whichever.  But with the bacon, ham, and cheese it came out a little on the salty side.  And I usually have a high tolerance to very salty things.  Even with that though, the quiche was off the charts!!!

Make this all the time, and the whole family loves it.  You can definitely skip the bacon/ham (if you don't have it or don't eat it) and it's still fantastic!

I've been making this for a few years now - and I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  I now use it as my base recipe for all quiches, changing the meat and veggies as desired for any occasion.  Perfect 10.

I've reviewed this recipe before, but I don't remember how long ago it was. I was reading some of the recent reviews and noticed quite a few people having issues with too much filling. It all depends on the crust and pie plate you use. 

I've made this recipe numerous times and have never had a problem with spillage. I use the Pillsbury Refrigerated Pie Crusts that you just unroll and put in your pie plate. I also use the Emily Henry deep dish pie plates. It's been a perfect combination for me so far. 

I also use frozen broccoli instead of the spinach.

This is the first quiche I ever made and it came out well, even when I thought I overbaked it. I followed suggestions by other reviewers--prebake the deep dish pie shell, use less cheese, cut vegetables into very small pieces, and put foil under the quiche. There was no runover or spills in the oven, and I used the entire egg mix. That sour cream mixture is delicious. I will be making this recipe again.

Loved it! Turned out great, even though I left out the spinach and mushrooms and just used veggies I had on hand. Really liked the sour cream on the bottom. I'll be using this recipe from now on for quiche. I used the 'Easy Pie Crust' recipe on this site also, great alternative to store bought crust. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe with Jimmy Deans spicy sausage(just browned it up)instead of the ham. Also used pepper jack cheese. I combined all ingredients instead of layering. Had no problem with overflow or left over mixture. Made this for a brunch and everyone devoured it! I will definitely make it again. Yummy!!!

This quiche got rave reviews from my friends. I followed everything to the T, except  that on the last layer I thought I would overflow the crust, so I ended up using two less eggs. For those who have never made quiche before (like myself) you'll be pleased to know that the filling barely rises and you can fill the crust basically up to the brim without worries. Next time I will use all 8 eggs.

This is a great recipe, I was told it was one of the best quiches when I served it to my family.. however, I found that it didnt come out as thick as I like a quiche to be.. I cut the recipe in half to only make one quiche and didn't reduce anything further, so Im not sure why it came out thin. the flavor was amazing though, and because of the rave reviews I received I would give this recipe another try.

This is an excellent quiche recipe. Like others, I made changes to suit my taste. I left out the ham and used a full pound of bacon instead. Even without the ham, the quiche did not need extra salt. I used a cheese blend (cheddar, monterey jack, pepper jack)and added a bit of ricotta instead of parmesan. I thought the pepperjack especially complemented the flavor of the veggies. The sour cream/spinach mixture is fantastic. I stirred in a sprinkle of sea salt to that layer, and it gave the quiche a dip-like flavor. I would usually give this recipe a 5 since it tasted fantastic (though altered to taste--that's what recipes are for!) and the baking time was correct (cooked perfectly, looked beautiful), but I was rather upset that I had so much excess liquid. I hate wasting, and made a mess when the quiches overflowed. Mind you, this is with omitting the ham and 1/4 cup cream, and using deep-dish pie shells. Next time I will reduce the cream much more and cut the cheese in half. Other than that, great recipe.

Simply outstanding. I could have probably eaten a entire pie myself. I didn't see the need to dirty a lot of bowls, so I mixed the spinach and meat mixtures together, and then topped with the cheese and egg mixture.

Made this for a work going away breakfast. Since it made 2 pies, I was going to take a piece for dinner but both were conpletely gone before I had a chance. Very good and tasty. I bought pre-cooked bacon to save that step.

Excellent recipe. First time I made Quiche and it was a big hit. I made for a Sunday brunch for out of town family. They loved it and it makes enough for 2 pies.  I do suggest to get deep dish pie crusts because both of mine were overflowing and most of the egg spilled out of the crusts but it was still good. So I know it will be even better next time.

After using allrecipes.com many successful times and generally looking for those recipes with the largest number of reviews/ratings I have yet to actually leave a review until now.  This was truly one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  I substituted turkey bacon for the bacon and ham (more than the 1/2 pound it called for), used fat free half and half and added broccoli to the spinach/cream cheese mix.  All of these substitutions were fine, with a slight problem with there not being enough room for the egg mixture on the top.  I think I should not have done both the broccoli and spinach which would have taken up less room on the bottom thus not leaving enough space for the last layer.  Despite a little egg mixture overflowing this was EXCELLENT, and I highly recommend doing both pies, or even four!

WOW! WOW! WOW! I made this for my husband and our chuch musicians gathering and it was a HUGE hit! I used a 9" deep dish and a 10" deep dish. I used a low carb tortilla for the 10" since a lot of people were on low carb and it turned out great too. A keeper!

Delicious... but I made one deep dish and one regular 9" and still had about one cup of egg mixture leftover. Next time I will try two deep dishes.

made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  I couldn't fit all of the ingredients in, however, so divided ingredients into three pie plates and used another 4 eggs and 3/4 cup of half and half for the third custard.  Served it for brunch with friends and was told it was the best quiche ever.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for mother's day brunch today. It was a hit. It looks elegant and presents really well. I bought deep dish pie crusts and didn't have a big problem with overflow but do line your baking pan with foil. I made no modifications today but next time I might add some green pepper or some sun dried tomatoes. Very good recipe there was none left over.

Followed previous suggestions to reduce servings to 6 for one pie shell.  Used turkey bacon, did not have enough left over ham, so I mostly used bacon.  Used fresh spinach about 5 oz., and wilted it with the mushrooms/onions mixture.  Layered sour cream, bacon/veggies, cheese, and poured eggs on top.  Still had a little bit of overflow, so be sure to place some foil under your dish just in case it leaks as it warms. This is a delicious quiche!

I made this for xmas eve & everyone loved it! i doubled the recipe because i neede 4 quiches & cooked them in 2 pampered chef deep dish pie plates & 2 regular run of the mill pie plates.  I didn't have any problems w/ overflow . I also baked everything the night before & reheated the next day & that worked out great.  I used fresh crab & shrimp in 1 instead of ham & bacon & it was the best.  This recipe will be going into my perment collection!

Excellent recipe! I made it a couple of time and people never fail to rave about it. I substituted half & half with 2% reduced milk + margarine, but it still turned out tasty. This has become my signature dish now!

The quiche look awesome. But I've must complain a bit about the amount of ingredients. I used two deep dish Marie Calender's pie crusts and it still overflowed all over the place. My oven is a mess (I even used the baking sheet below but it didn't matter). Take a previous viewers advice: use three pie pans. 

I followed the layering technique. Next time, I will combine the cheeses with the eggs and half and half before putting it in the pans. I think it will blend better. 

I will make this again.

This is a very flavorful quiche, but the recipe didn't fit into two 9" pie crusts. Must either use deep dish crusts or use a third 9" regular crust. I would also watch salting the mixtures to taste - the bacon and ham add a lot of salt.

What a fantastic quiche this is! I didn't have a pie crust on hand, so I placed some leftover mashed potatoes in my pie plate and baked them until golden brown. I then added my filling minus the ham. The whole family absolutely loved this recipe. Thanks Clark!

This recipe was AWFUL!  It was heavy, tasteless, and didn't even look pretty.  I served it for company over the holidays, based on the raving reviews, and in the end, I was embarrassed to have served it.

Agree with all that this is absolutely the best quiche...not for the low cal crowd.  Don't substitute low-fat anything, spoils the result.   Made for a girls weekend in Vermont recently, and everyone requested recipe. Agree that this quiche is definitely best the next day.  Reheats beautifully, too (oven, not m/wave).  Great recipe..thanks Clark.

The best Quiche I have EVER had. Truly. Easy to make too. I made one with the meat for my husband and one without the meat and mushrooms for me. Both were so so good. I also used Vidalia onions and Cremini mushrooms. Instead of just cooking the onions until translucent I caramalized them. This is a very generous recipe so make sure you use DFEP DISH pie pans. if not use 3 pie pans. Very meaty and filling as well.This truly deserves the highest rating.

This recipe turned out great. Made it for brunch and took your advice and made two!!  My daughter said it was the best quiche she has tasted.  Added a little nutmeg to the egg and half and half and it tasted great.  Thanks it was a winner with my family.

I made this as a practice run for a  brunch and I'm so glad! Here's what I discovered. You need deep dish pie crusts. I pre-baked mine for about 7 minutes and they shrank as, crusts do, to a half inch below the rim of my deep dishes.  So make sure you have large pie crusts. Definitely pre-bake them though. My crusts were perfectly golden. Also I baked my quiches for an hour and 5 minutes. I can't imagine them being done after 40 minutes. They took about 45 minutes to prepare,  I grated cheese so that likely added to prep time. Finally you have to let them set for about 10 minutes to absorb the liquids.  I was concerned once I removed them from the oven as they seemed to be underdone but they were fine after sitting a few minutes.  I skipped the bacon, I didn't have any. And I used fresh spinach, about two handfuls.  The end result was great. This recipe is a keeper. I'm making it for my brunch with confidence now.

I made only 1 quiche so I halved the recipe.  I also used pancetta in place of the bacon.  Everything else was done to the exact recipe.  It turned out delicious!!  I have made many quiches in  my day and this is definitely one of the best recipes I have tried.  Thanks Clark!

Made it exactly as the recipe was written and it was fantastic.  Experimenting some I replaced the bacon with hot sausage... OMG was it ever good...  Everyone who was lucky enough to get a piece of it raved about how good it was.  Great for a cold snowy midwest Sunday morning...

The sourcream & spinach in the first layer is a genius idea.  BEST quiche i've made and eaten.  Thanks for this recipe!  I used fresh spinach, cooked it with some olive oil, added sourcream once it had cooled.  I made 2 complete quiche's then put them in the refrigerator for christmas morning.  I was able to enjoy christmas day without worrying about what to eat and my family thoroughly enjoyed these quiches!

This quiche is good, but very rich. The ingredients were too plentiful to include all; for example, I used less cheese than the recipe called for. Less sour cream should be used as well, in my opinion. Tasty, but I prefer a more traditional quiche.

Delicious! I made this as a test run to see if I want to serve it for a luncheon I am having.  It was easy to make and had wonderful flavors.  I will be making it for the luncheon. My husband loved it, proving that real men really do eat quiche!  I used gruyere cheese instead of Monterey Jack.

I've made this as written about 6 times. It's wonderful and you don't have to change a thing, although it's probably simple enough to add your favorite veggies!  It's great with soup or salad and keeps well for days.  Everyone I've served it to asks for the recipe.  I can see why it has great ratings from fellow great cooks.  Quiche lovers know a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This quiche (or these, since it makes two) are delicious and hearty. I enjoyed the creamy spinach layer especially.  I cut down on the eggs and milk and still overflowed the deep dish pie pans. May try to get three out of this recipe next time.

I made the recipe just like the directions called for and will not make changes when I make it again. As with certain foods, the second pie on the second night tasted better. I reheated the second pie in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

This recipe was a total hit with the family. Everyone had seconds, even the kids that will generally never eat anything with spinach. Only change I made was to use cheese I had from a cheese board when we had guests over (using gouda, aged cheddar, parm, et. al.). I also didn't follow directions very well and mixed the cream, eggs and cheese together; but it didn't matter -- this recipe is hard to mess up... This was a successful pre-run before relatives come over for the Holidays. I will make a bunch of these ahead of time so that I can just pop them into the oven in the morning...

I love it. But saying that I do modify it I use a red pepper with my shallots and some garlic, swiss and cheddar are good but I leave out the parm. I also make mine with a hash brown crust and bake it right in my cast Iron pan.

The taste was good but not amazing.

I prepared the recipe as written, except that I could not fit all of the ingredients into the pie pans.

I did not add any salt. There was too much filling for 2, 9-inch, deep dish pie shells.The sour cream did not seem to enhance the flavor of the dish. The end result was fantastic. 

I will not make this recipe again.

Great recipe and easy to change ingredients for variation. I used steamed broccoli instead of spinach and used breakfast sausage instead of ham. I didn't have deep dish pans so I only used six eggs and one cup of half and half. The quiche was gone in about fifteen minutes!  It was a hit.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't have any ham or mushrooms, so I added 1 cup of artichokes along with the bacon & onion. The spinach & sour cream bottom layer made for a very special blending of flavors. I have some vegetarians in the family, so I plan to make it for Christmas Eve, leaving out the meat, but adding artichokes with the other vegetables.

This was great but I had to bake about 10 mins more than it called for and I substituted green peppers for the spinach. Even my grandma who is a great cook loved it. I made two for a family brunch.

This has been my go-to recipe for quiche ever since I found it! I've made it for office parties and everyone loves it! The only modification I make is to use the bacon fat to saut√© the onions and cut back on the sour cream, cheese and half and half just so I can add a couple extra eggs.  This is the best quiche ever! Thanks Clark!

I have made this quiche many times for family holiday brunches. It is wonderful. I use deep dish pie crusts as it would overflow using regular ones. I made extras and freeze them as they are great for dinner.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I had never made quiche before. It came out perfect. I omitted the spinach though because my family is not a big fan. I also made a crust for my pies and doubled the amount of egg in each (8 per pie, for total of 16 eggs used. It just didn't look like 8 eggs split between the two pies was going to be enough). I was sure glad the recipe made two pies. Everyone loved it so much they went back for 2nds & 3rds!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Best quiche I've ever eaten!  I really did not think that all of the ingredients would fit in two 9" pie shells, but it did!  Excellent taste and well worth the time spent preparing it.

I love quiche and have tried many, many recipes and this is one of the best.  So versatile and forgiving.  The flavor is wonderful as is, but changes with whatever ingredient you decide to add.  Thank you Clark for submitting this and sharing your quiche recipe.

OMG this is good! Even better nuked the next day, if possible. I went with a 1# all-bacon version (thank goodness, 'cause I wouldn't have had room for 2 C of ham), and I'm SO glad I read the reviews and used DEEP DISH crusts. Also made sure to egg-white-wash the crusts and pre-bake a little so they didn't get soggy. YUM!!!

Have made this dish six times now. Tweak it a little bit based on what I have in the kitchen. I always seem to have more than what will fit in the pie crusts, so I cut the ingredients back a little bit so that it won't overflow in my oven. Tried it with ricotta cheese instead of sour cream but it was too sweet. I cook one and cover the second one with press and seal and it stores in the freezer nicely.

So far, I have made this three times in two weeks. It is delicious. YOU HAVE TO COOK THE CRUST FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE FILLING IT. That's how you keep the crust from sogging. It's fun to play around with meats and veggies to add, but man, the original is excellent as is.

It was great!  I just have a question.  I froze one of the 2 I made and I'm not sure how to reheat it.  Do I defrost it in the refrigerator overnight?  Do I put it in the oven frozen?  What's the time & temperature if it's frozen vs. defrosted?  I'm not the best cook - I try and sometimes have pretty good success, so I don't want to ruin awesome quiche.  Thanks!

Beautiful quiche, took them to a party and everybody said it was the best they'd ever eaten!  I used mushrooms, green onions, low-fat semi-dried tomatoes, and fetta cheese instead.  And dill instead of parsley.  Definitely suggest par-baking the crusts for 10 minutes.  Thanks Clark!

VERY tasty. But as in the other reviewers mention seemed to be a lot of filling, I made 16 mini pies, 6 crust-less muffin quiches and one 9" deep dish quiche. 
I used half eggs and half whites only to make it a touch healthier...only thing I would do different is to mix it all together for the crust-less.

Very, very tasty.  I made it exactly as written, just omitting the mushrooms (one son won't eat them).  These fit perfectly in two deep-dish crusts.  I will definitely be making this again... thanks!

As written, there are a number of issues with this recipe that make me give it only 3 stars.  However, with a few changes, it earns 5!
The issues:
too much filling for even 2 deep-dish pie crusts!
too much cheese
too much meat
not quite enough eggs and 1/2 and 1/2 to extend the filling to a third small quiche

My fixes:
In addition to 2 Marie Callendar deep dish crusts, I used a small baking dish to make a crustless third quiche with the extra filling.  That way, none of the pies overflowed and I have one to keep and eat now, one to take to my event, and one to freeze!  To accomodate this third quiche, I had to add two eggs and an unmeasured but small amount of 1/2 and 1/2- maybe 1/3 cup?

I used 8 oz of extra sharp aged Tillamook cheddar, about 3 oz of Moneterey Jack, and about 3 oz of a shredded parmesan-romano mixture.

I cheated and used a package of pre-cooked bacon- 2.5 oz of it snipped into small pieces.

And I substituted frozen chopped broccoli for spinach- thawed and drained but not cooked.

With these fixes, I am EXTREMELY happy with the results.  I cooked them all in one oven at the recommended temperature and for 40 mins, and they are perfectly browned and done.  Thank you to Clark for providing this recipe from which we can all build our own masterpieces.  :)

Delicious!  Like others suggested I didn't cook the spinach.  I drained it and squeezed the water out.  I also baked the pie crusts for 6 minutes before filling.  Best quiche I've made!

Made it exactly according the the recipe.  Best quiche I've ever had!  I needed to cook it longer than the recipe says - I would say cook it 50 minutes to one hour.

Great tasting quiche!  My hubby is not a quiche fan so I used small tart shells.  It took less time to cook, about 30 min.  Since I love quiche, I can freeze these mini quiches and have them whenever I want.  Thanks for the recipe!

Best quiche ever!! Even the kids loved:) the only small change I made was that I mixed the sour cream with some salsa and grated zucchini, used broccoli insteadof spinich. I also used 10 eggs - made two regular 9inch quiches- planned on freezing one, but the my family enjoyed it so much they ate both:)

This was the first time I made quiche and it turned out wonderful!! The only ingredient I didn't have was the mushrooms. It was pretty time consuming and kind of costly, but it was worth it! I made two so I could freeze one for another day and I'm so glad I did. This is great for brunches, holiday breakfast, etc. Will make again!

Excellent quiche.  Made this past week and doubled; my only issue as with others is that the volume is greater than 2 deep dish Pillsbury pie crusts, luckily I read reviews ahead and bought 6 and used 5 since I doubled.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I had visitors right after baking and my granddaughter, her SIL and my hubby all did a taste test and thought it was great.  Taking 2 to my g'daughters cooked today (July 4th)..daughter is getting married today and leaving immediately after for a honeymoon so will celebrate with her daughter.  Freezes well!!

I really liked this.  I used sausage instead of bacon which I like better for quiche.  I also had to use one less egg but it turned out fine (I used a little bit less half and half to match).  However, according to my boyfriend it's not as good as the quiche made by his mother and grandmother so it only gets four stars from me.

Excellent! No mushrooms for us and I used fresh baby spinach. I just wilted it in my hot bacon grease before cooking the onions. Very rich!

Great quiche recipe! I was trying to use up some of the leftovers in the house so I used turkey instead of ham and turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. Turned out really good! A very versatile recipe. Please note that all the ingredients DO NOT fit into two regular 9 inch pie crusts so I would recommend using either 2 deep dish crusts or 4 regular crusts. I Didn't read the other reviews before making this and made the mistake of getting 2 regular pie crusts. To avoid overflow after I finished making everything I split the different fillings in half putting one half in the quiches and the other in the fridge for later. The next day I used the refrigerated half to make 2 more quiches which was good because they were so good that the other 2 were already gone!

This is a wonderful quiche!! We enjoyed it very much. The recipe does make two large quiche's. I used 10" pie pans. I also made my homemade pie crust and it was delish. This is a KEEPER, can be for breakfast or dinner.

I made this quiche tonight (2 of them...the full serving). The flavor was great. However, it took a long! time to prepare (way longer than 15 min) and it was quite moist, even after an additional 20 of baking the second pie. Next time I will leave out the sour cream b/c I feel it's unnecessary for the flavor and contributes to too much moisture. (And I did drain my spinach well.) But I will make it again...flavor was very good.

Amazing! I modified it a little cutting the recipe in half and used Gruyere and a little cheddar cheese instead
 They devoured the whole thing and was disappointed I didn't make more. I made a flaky pie crust using another recipe, will absolutely make it again!

Made this exactly as written but with a little extra bacon.  It was very good --- I wouldn't say unbelievable though.  And for the amount of prep time I'm not sure it was worth it.  There are a lot of good quiches that you can make in 1/4 of the time.

nice consistency on the filling though my crust came out a bit soggy for some reason.Being forwarned I used a really "deep" deep dish (cut everything in half/just made 1) and it was just right. For normal pie pans/crusts it would definitely make 3, not 2.I tried this a second time as a veggie quice without the heavy meat content. It cooked up better and was a much bigger hit.

Always a hit!  I omit the ham and only use bacon...just a personal preference.  To cut down on fat, I used fat free half & half & sour cream.

Oh my heavens, this was divine...I have never written a review before but I just had to write one for this. I made it nearly exactly as is, but I used  a pound of bacon and omitted the mushrooms only because I didn't have any on hand. This dish disappeared like magic! Thank you so much for the great recipe!

Only thing wrong with this recipe is how much I ate of it!!!  Made exactly as written.  I keep going back for "one more sliver" and have ended up eating a quarter of the darn thing!  AND still want more!  Thanks alot for blowing my diet with this one Clark!

Absolutely delicious. The recipe yielded enough to fill two of those pre-made pie crusts you can get with enough leftover to fill another 9" pie dish. Unless you've got some seriously deep pie pans, expect to have some leftover.

Instead of olive oil, I just reused the pan I cooked the bacon in. I drained all of the bacon grease out, spooned a bit back in and saut√©ed the onions in that.

Wow! I wasn't able to buy a premade quiche for Christmas breakfast so had to make from scratch...first timer! I followed the advice from reviews. Used less cheese and deep pie crusts (prebake for 10 mins.) I was nervous since the meat mix almost filled the 2 pans. There was enough meat to do three pies but you would need to adjust egg portion. Poured the 8 eggs over the 2 dishes and crossed my fingers.  Cooled, covered, and reheated the next morning. It was amazing! My parents want this quiche every year. It takes prep time but soooo worth it. Finely diced is the way to go.  Thanks Clark

This quiche was very good. I didn't change anything but I was sure glad that I made two of them. I was only going to make one but something told me that I would regret it later. Thank you for the wonderful recipe and please keep 'em coming.

AMAzzzing! I made this for my family of 6 and it was plenty for all of us and then we still had left overs!  I actually only put the meat in one of the pies and both pies were equally wonderful! All 4 of my children loved this meal, which is very hard to do in our house! I will be making this for a lunch for my girlfriends very soon!

Excellent, and seems pretty forgiving - as far as changes.  I used a pound of frozen spinach and didn't really drain it, just used a little less other liquid (half & half).  Also, used a lot less cheese, didn't have ham or onion, and used 9 eggs.  Also I baked the crusts for about 20 min first.  Nice to have one waiting in the freezer now!

OMG! I must say this was the best quiche I've had thus far.  My brother and I thought that Pour-A-Quiche was good and the little appetizer quiches from Sam's Club were great, but this was complety homemade and AWESOME!  I did add a little garlic and onion powder to my spinach as well as to the egg mixture and I must say that this quiche was bursting with flavor.  My family loved it and I served it at a bruncheon at work and my co-workers raved over it.  Thanks Clark

OMG, this smelled wonderful baking in the oven, and it tasted great.  Will definitely make again.  The only changes I made were no sour cream and I used canned mushrooms because we were out of those, too.  Time to go to the grocery store!  I also drained all but about 1 tsp of bacon grease from the frying pan and sauteed the onions and mushrooms in the pan, scraping up the little bits.  Thanks, Clark!

This was excellent! The first quiche I've ever made and probably the best I've ever had! Great flavor and even better the next day! I froze one for later as theres just 2 of us. I did leave out the mushrooms because I dont care for them at all but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Next time I think I will bake the crusts for a few minutes to get the bottom more crisp. Great recipe!

I needed a lot of prep time, as I had to shred, grate, dice, cook, saute and cool everything before assembling the quiche.  As for 2 (9 inch) deep dish shells, I needed 3.  My prep time was closer to 45 minutes and I can't say the effort was worth the resulting taste - the quiche was only 'good', not 'outstanding'.

Excellent recipe!  I made it this morning and it is outstanding.  The only thing I did differently is omit the mushrooms and used all bacon instead of ham.  The only thing I will do differently next time is not add any salt (the bacon has more than enough for the amount I used) and add a TON of pepper.  Thanks for posting!

This is an amazing quiche.  My husband who is not a fan of eggs loves it because it is so rich and doesn't have alot of "egg" taste.  Delicious!

This was the best Quiche I have ever made.  Adjustments that I made was to use 1.) only 5 eggs 2.)a splash of white wine and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the egg mixture. 3.) I pulsed the mixture in a blender to incorporate a bit of air. These two 9 inch deep dish pies are light and delicious.

delicious -- everyone in my family liked this recipe (even those who were professed to "not liking spinach in a quiche"). This does take more than 15 minutes of prep time and I had a number of pans to clean up (not a one-pan recipe like other quiches). I split the recipe -- even then, had enough "fillings" to make 2 9" "deep dish" frozen pie crusts, although I did have to make a bit more egg mixture (6 eggs, another 1/4 cup of milk) to pull this off.

I made this recently for some friends.  They loved it.  I left out all the meat because I needed to have at least one vegetarian dish.  I will definitely make this again.

First time I made this recipe I halved it (one pie)...used bacon, onion, mushroom, asparagus and tomatoes instead of the spinach....wow...so, so good I still dream of it at night! Currently, as I write this, I'm making 4 for my sister's brunch/wedding reception. Two for the carnivores (bacon, sausage, tomato) and two for the vegetarians (mushrooms, onions and green peppers. I think the sour cream is the key to this recipe. I can't wait for all the 'wow, who made the quiche' comments tomorrow ;)

WINNER! Love the combination of the cheeses. Also added a 1 T dried basil. Diced the bacon before frying and sauteed onions, mushrooms (sliced, not diced) and ham in the same pan. Also, used a 10" deep dish with no spillage. Took both to a gathering of six girlfriends so everyone could have a slice for lunch the next day. Thank you Clark!

I thought this was very good.  Although I omitted the spinach and sour cream because I didn't have any it still came out very good.  I halfed the recipe and came out with 2 pies.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks Clark for your recipe!

Exceptionally good!  Don't change any of the ingredients.  Make sure you use deep dish pie pans - only problem I have is there's just a little too much of the egg mixture, so I don't pour all of it into the shells.  And...make sure you have a pan underneath to catch anything that runs over.  One of my all-time favorite recipes, and my kids love it!

This is an awesome recipe and I thank you for sharing it with us.  My only complaint is that the prep time is not 15min.  more like 30min.  It takes 15min just to fry up the bacon.  And the cook time is a lot more than 10min, the actual recipe states 40min making the "ready in" not 25min.  My family thought we were going to eat in 30min.  Turned out we ate in hour.  We did however enjoy the finished product.  We have made this several times since and have found that it works out just as well as "crustless" as it does with the crust.  Thanks again for sharing.

Best quiche I have ever had!  I cut down the servings to 12 but kept the two DEEP dish pie crusts and it was the perfect amount of filling.  I didn't use any parsley and I cut back on the cheese a bit too after reading some reviews.  I also mixed everything together before adding to the pie shells instead of having layers.  It was sooo good though!  I will for sure make this again and I'm really happy that I have another one in the freezer waiting for me right now!

One word-WOW. What a delicious quiche! A little time consuming but worth the effort. I made this for Brunch/Rose Parade watching. I served it with some hot cinnamon apples and it was wonderful. The only thing I would do differently is omit the added salt.  I think the bacon and ham provide all the salt you'll need. Try this quiche and impress your guests. They come out beautifullly!

Wonderful! I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes and that worked perfectly. However, I had 2 regular-sized 9 inch shells so not all of the egg mixture fit. Oops! It was still tasty but DEFINITELY use deep dish shells or 3 regular ones.

This Quiche is amaaaazing! I made it for a brunch with friends and everybody loved it! It's easy and quick to make. I actually made two different ones - one with meat and one without for the vegetarians. Both turned out incredible and the effort for making two different quiches is tiny! Thanks for sharing this remarkable recipe, it's a keeper!

This is soooo good!  I used Marie Callendars frozen deep dish pie crust and a total of just 7 eggs and it was a great fit (a tad bit of overflow in the oven).  I also used fresh baby spinach just for the heck of it, but next time I will probably use the frozen.  I don't know how noticeable the fresh was.  Oh, my criticism...I was actually pretty peeved at this:  The times are way off!  It takes much longer than 15 mins to prep, and for some reason the cooking time says 10 mins at the top of the recipe (with total time being 25 mins HA!).  I have never made a quiche before so I didn't know that 10 mins was totally unrealistic!  I was running late and pretty bummed once I got to the end of the recipe and it said to cook for 40 mins!  I think it took even more time than that!  5 stars, none the less, because the taste was very impressive....an hour and a half later!

My husband said this was the best quiche he'd ever had. I'd never made quiche before, so it was really great to have this recipe. I didn't have any ham, so I just added extra bacon. I think that was a mistake because I thought it was a little too salty. That was my own fault though. Thanks for this recipe!

Thanks Clark! Made this last night and we all enjoyed, my husband said "excellent)! My boys are vegetarians and don't much care for mushrooms so I left them out. I didn't have any spinach but I did have asparagus. I had just bought some frozen puff pastry sheets and decided to try that for the shell.(I pre-baked the crust for about ten minutes.) This recipe is a keeper!!!

The flavor was fantastic but I can't quite give this 5 stars.  I used the quiche recipe as a guideline for doing my own thing.  I used the cheeses and then did broccoli and chicken.  Mixed the broccoli, chicken and sauted onions together with sour cream and then put in my shells.  From there, topped with cheese and poured the egg mixture over that.  Next time, I will just do eggs and no milk/half-n-half/cream or whatever.  The sour cream in with the "stuff" was just fine.  One or the other, basically (sour cream with stuff or milk with eggs, but not both).  I will also mix the cheese in with the "stuff" instead of making it a separate layer as the eggs could not really penetrated inside the quiche.  Finally, I did follow other reviewers advice and baked the shells a bit before filling.

This turned out great. I omitted the mushrooms, and used broccoli instead of spinache, but it was a big hit. I also found a recipe on here for a handmade cheesy pie crust that made it pop!

I catered a bridal brunch for 30 yesterday and made this without having tested it first...Homerun!! Holy cow, is this delicious.  Instead of two deep dish, I made 3 shallow pies using frozen pie crusts.  Made everything the night before and refrigerated, baked in the morning.  Try it, try it, try it!

I've made this several times.  As written, the recipe is a 3* one simply because the prep time is way off, and so is the quantity.  If you make this as directed, you'll have a lot more egg mixture than needed.  I reduce the cream to 1c and reduce the eggs to 6, and I still have about 2/3 cup of egg mix left, which I just scrambled up and ate on toast.

Tip for the ham:  Have your deli do 2 slices of ham at a #7 thickness, and then it's so easy to dice and it's just the right amount.

Very good quiche.  Important to note:  use deep dish pie plates; allow 1 hr - 1.5 hrs for prep and cooking; precook the pie crust a bit.

Very tasty but the cook time is incorrect.  I was very upset when I figured our the cook time was wrong because I was preparing this meal for church and had only 1 hr. to prepare and cook the quiche.  You need at least 30-40min. to prep the food, 10min to pre-bake your pie crusts(if you choose to use them) and you need 30-35min. of baking time.  Overall, the recipe was good but I would recommend cutting way back on the cheese, buy fat free sour cream, don't add salt(meat is salty enough), and use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  If you don't have time to pre-bake the crusts for 10min. the crust comes out undercooked and tastes terrible (tastes great without pie crust also).  Enjoy!

This such a great recipe, everyone asks me to make it for ant brunch or breakfast we are having.  I do one with just the meat and cheese and then one just as the recipes says and they are great.

Wow!  My second quiche attempt ever.  My previous was a colossal failure.  This one was terribly good.  I used my Pampered Chef and a regular pie pan. The Pillsbury unroll crusts I prebaked.  I cut back on the cheese (at the advice on some of the comments), used whole milk, full fat sour cream, and did not add any extra salt.  I used a little less meat also.  And about two tablespoons fresh parsley.  The results, unbelievably delicious.  The prep and baking time took far longer than the recipe stated but who cares it was so good.

We are going to my mother's for Easter this year and quiche sounded like a good idea.  I came across this recipe and read all the rave reviews and figured i would give this a shot. As I was preparing this recipe, the amount of ingredients seemed like a lot (there was so much cheese!) so I ended up splitting the mix between three deep dish pie crusts instead of two.    I did one of the pies without ham because my husband has some strange aversion to ham and mixed in broccoli instead.  I also substituted sliced artichoke for mushrooms for all the pies.  I let them cook just a little longer due to the extra veggies. The crust was dark but not burnt. The flavor is fantastic, very savory and hits the spot. This is probably the best quiche I've ever had!  God bless you Clark for sharing this recipe! I can't wait to share this with my family as well.

This quiche is great.  I did use fresh spinach which extended the cooking time a bit due to the extra water.

I meant to review this recipe about 5 months ago, and just noticed I never posted it. This was BY FAR THE BEST quiche I have ever had! I was hosting a brunch at my house for all of my family and wanted to try and make a quiche rather then to buy one. I have to be honest and say that I have never attempted to make a quiche in my life and the reviews I got made it look like I had been making it for YEARS! They all loved it and begged me for the recipe - they all said it was the very best they have had as well! The only thing I did different was I did not add any salt because the ham and bacon had enough in it. I also used a little more skim milk then the half and half (I did add the half and half though cuz I know despite the calories, it does really make it good!). I also added lots of chopped mushrooms cuz we love them. I was so scared to try and make this (let alone serve as one of the main dishes for my brunch) but I am so glad I did - it will for sure be the only recipe I use! Thanks so much Clark!!!!

I liked the taste, but mine came out mushy.  Words of advice for beginner cooks out there like myself:  1. Make sure you literally wring all the water from the spinach, otherwise your quiche will turn out mushy like mine. 2. If you're using regular 9" pie crusts, use the 8 eggs but reduce the bacon and ham by 1/3; otherwise you'll barely taste the egginess that you expect from quiches. 3. Don't buy the sweet shortbread pie crust, go for the regular graham cracker crust. 4. Make sure you bake the pies for the entire 40 minutes.  I did 30 min., which may also explain the mushiness of my quiche.

It's good.  Quite good.  I don't think it is worth the effort.  For all the cleanup and dishes I won't make it again.  Laziness isn't the best way to review but I didn't get a good return on the time and effort investment.  Oh, if I did make this again, I'd leave out the spinach or maybe use fresh.

I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter and was a little frightened at the amount of stuff in my deep dish pie crusts, but it turned out beautifully!  The only recommendation I have is to bake the quiches on the top rack of the oven and have the bottom rack layered with foil, just to catch ANY falling debris!  LOL....It saves you from a messy oven.  My husband brought the leftover quiche to work the next day and said that it practically got him a raise, it was so loved by his bosses! 5 STARS!!!

Made this again. It's a tasty recipe, but there really is too much as far as contents to pack into both pie crusts. Prepare for over drips in the oven. 2/9/2009 This is the best quiche recipe I have ever used. The quiche was so packed full of delicious ingredients that I could barely fit all the eggs in.

I was glad I took Clark's advice and made two, and you definitely do need the deep-dish pans! I like an eggy-er quiche, but my boyfriend loved this recipe. I would probably try a variation of it next time. The spinach mixture was excellent, I would use less meat and cheese (just for lowering the fat/calories) and more eggs.  I would be curious to know if anybody has tried to make a recipe like this using egg beaters, and if so, how it went.

I was looking for a meatless spinach quiche and came across this.  Ha! Ha!  But it sounded good, so I just omitted the meat and followed the rest of the recipe.  I only made one because I only have one deep dish quiche pan.  It was plenty big enough for the egg mixture, no overflow problems.  I used the whole 10 ozs of spinach and more mushrooms since I wasn't using any meat, and used the whole 8 oz of sour cream in the spinach.  It was really very good, and my husband and I ate half the pie in one sitting!

I give it only two because it only mentions at the end that you bake it for 40 minutes!!! It says ready in 25 min at the heading, and I found it in the 'ready in 30 min' section of the site. REally choked me!!

Made this for New Year's Day. FABULOUS!! Glad it made two, as company stayed over. Used only half the cheese and it was still excellent. Cut down eggs by one. Mixture fit perfectly in my pie plates.

I made this quiche for out of town guest at Christmas, and it was wonderful!  It makes two big pies.  I will make this again in a heartbeat.

Great recipe! I halved the cheese and left out the bacon and made without crust to make it a little lighter and it was so so good.

This is a very good quiche; not your traditional quiche but still very good.  And extremely easy to make.  I definitely chose to use low fat/fat free ingredients when I could.  I hate mushrooms, so omitted that, and didn't have any ham on hand either.  Recipe still turned out great.  Also, I chose to use the ready made baking graham cracker pie crust (usually used for cheesecake).  The sweetness with the saltiness of the dish are incredibily tasty (that's how my mom used to make quiche growing up and I always loved it).  Next time I would suggest cutting back on some of the cheese and substituting it with a little bit of swiss cheese as well. Would make a great combination.

This is a wonderful dish! It works with a can of evaporated milk also, which is something I always have on hand, unlike cream. I recommend adding a little salt to the spinach/sour cream mixture and that's it. The cheese and bacon make the rest salty enough.

Holy cow was this yummy!

I used boxed crust mix just because that I made so much dough these past days that I wanted a break from cutting in shortening to flour but it worked fine.

It all came together rather quickly and I did substitute some of the eggs with cholesterol free egg product and had to cut back on the cheese and egg/cream mixture just because I didn't have deep dish pans.

Can't wait to dig into the second pie tomorrow for breakfast!

Very good!  I halved the recipe because I'm only cooking for two and it turned out just right.  I used a sheet of puff pastry (filo dough) for my crust instead of the pie crust.  Nice, light and flaky that way.  Turned out awesome.

Clark is right! You HAVE to make 2! Hubby hates eggs but had 3 big pieces of this quiche! I followed the recipe except I used fresh spinach which I cooked down a bit with my onion, and didn't have too much for my deep dish pie pans, it was the perfect amount.

This is wonderful. I made 2 9 inch deep dish pie crusts with no problem. I used the Pillsbury frozen pie crusts. I did prebake the pie crusts for about 8 minutes before I filled them. I had no problem with overflow in the stove. 
I omitted the mushrooms. My son hates them. And instead of olive oil, I just used the bacon grease for the onions. Seemed like a total waste of the bacon grease to not use it. LOL. I did mix all of the ingredients together instead of layering them. I just made sure everything had cooled before I added the cheese and eggs. I didn't measure the cheese exactly, I just did handfuls until the mixture looked right. LOL. I'm not big on measuring unless I am baking. I made them for tomorrow night. I read the reviews that this is much better the second night. We are having this with potato and ham soup for supper tomorrow. 
When I got them out of the oven tonight I did have to taste just a bite of the filling...and it was AMAZING. I think even my husband might like this. My son loves quiche...My husband not so much. But I think this will be something he likes.

This quiche was amazing. I'm not easily impressed but this was delicious and full of flavor. It does make a lot, 2 + 9 inch pie pans. But is well worth it. I added breakfast pan sausages on top. OMG. This is eating!

Very good quiche.  Did not add shrooms but subbed in fresh diced, drained tomatoes as we have an abundance right now.  Added a clove of garlic to the onions.  Also, after grating the cheddar and the parm it was a HUGE amount of cheese so just omitted the jack cheese.  Came out wonderful!  SOOOO good!  Oh, one more thing I thought I had 1/2&1/2 but didn't so I subbed whole milk.  Still rich and wonderful!  Next time I will omit the bacon as it really doesn't need it in our opinion.  Thanks for the recipe.  If you follow the basic quiche part of the recipe you could add all sorts of things.  Will try that next time to use up odds and ends in the fridge.  Will make it again.

Very good. I did sautee, the mushrooms, onions and meat mixture in the bacon grease instead of olive oil. Mainly because it was there. I didn't have parmesan cheese so I did a colby, Jack and cheddar mix. Used about 2 cups frozen broccoli florets microwaved it for 3 minutes and then chopped super fine. I will make this again the only thing I might do different is mix everything instead of layering just to see if the cheese spreads out a little more. Awesome...kids and hubby liked it a lot

Did 2 9" pies in deep dish pie shells.  I also did some leftover diced chicken instead of the ham, because I didn't have any ham.  EXCELLENT recipe!  I did layer, according to the directions, but I think it would work as well with just mixing it all together.

The flavor of this Quiche is really great.  I made it for a camping trip and everyone loved it.  I dont know what happened, but my Quiche crust was soggy...is it supposed to be this way?  I dont know what I did wrong.  I will try again just because it was very good.  I made put everything together the day before and then put in crust the next day...maybe that is why....I will give still 5 stars because it was so good and everyone loved even though the crust wasnt crisp!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good quiche!  Like other reviewers, I mixed everything together and poured in UNBAKED pie shells and they were great.  Pre-baking would have gotten them way too brown.  I did NOT use the bacon, but followed all the other directions.  I did have to bake an extra 10 minutes or so to get them to a doneness that I like for eggs.  This made one quiche for dinner and an extra one that I took to work the next morning for breakfast.

I used the pillsbury pie crust and pre-baked as others suggested (probably not needed).  I layered the ingredients but it was messy so I would just mix them all together next time.  Big hit at our neighborhood play group.

scrumptious.  i wanted to make homemade pastry as other reviewers did, but happened to have the frozen Pillsbury kind on hand, so I used that.  I think I did everything as the recipe said except that I didn't use ham or mushrooms, and I added chopped green onions because I only had about 1/4 cup chopped white onions.  I did prebake the pastry but the edges got a little darker than I hoped so next time I won't prebake.  It was delicious...my 19 month old even loved it and he usually likes most of his foods separated.  I definitely would leave out the ham again because the bacon was good enough (put in an extra slice or two).  I used half reg bacon and half maple bacon.  MMMMM.  Perfect topped with slices of fresh avocado w/garlic salt and pepper.

Really hearty and very good.  This is the first time I made a quiche and I am very pleased with the results.  I did pre-cook the pie crusts for 10 minutes so they would not get soggy and used canned mushrooms (squeezed dry).  I also used shredded swiss and cheddar/motz mix cheese, I probably did not use all that was called for because the crusts were filling up.  Cooked perfectly in 40 minutes- very tasty.

I found this recipe a few years back while looking for something to serve on mother's day.  I have been making it every mother's day since.  My family so looks forward to this dish.  I serve it with fresh strawberries and mimosa's...  Yum!  Make sure you make at least two- I NEVER have any leftovers!

I didn't know what a "Quiche" dish was but learned that you could make it in a deep dish pie pan.  It was delish! I followed the advise of other viewers and sauted onions and garlic. I used a biscuit mix recipe on this site (scaled way down, of course) since I didn't have my own. My husband loved it and my 17 month old had two servings! I have no leftovers cuz my hubby took it to work to eat it for lunch today! Thanks!

I have made this for friends and family several times.  It is always a hit!!  I don't recommend freezing it though. It was watery and not as tasteful.  For quick serving as breakfast for guests, I make it the night before, cover and refrigerate.

The most excellent quiche I have ever had!  I made this for a baby shower and everyone devoured it!  I made it just as the recipe said, and it turned out perfect!  I did halve the recipe to only make one, but I wish I would have had two.  I also baked it for about 6 minutes longer, and I prebaked the pie crust for 6 minutes. Yum!

Mmmm, really liked this...  I skipped the meats and just upped the mushrooms, and added a bunch of other veggies (spinach, broccoli...)  Also used the No Roll Pie Crust I recipe on this site for the crust.  Definitely freeze one for later-  thaws out great too.

This is a GREAT RECIPE!  I made some alterations that make it a bit more healthy, I only used 1 meat and put in half the cheese because it is a bit overly cheesey. I think this is a good base for quiche. You may want to get deep dish pie crusts because it's hard to fit all the ingrediants in the regular pie crusts :o)

This was a good quiche but very rich. Next time, I will half the recipe and make only one. With only 3 people in my family, we had plenty left over with one quiche. Thanks for sharing

This is great.  The recipe may seem intimidating looking at that long list of ingredients, but it goes together quickly and is such a great quiche.  I made this for a brunch buffet at my house and everyone loved it.  I also offered a sliced fresh fruit plate with pears, melons and strawberries, pumpkin bread and mimosa's, of course!

This has been one of my favorite quiche recipes on the site.  I use all lowfat ingredients including turkey bacon and it still tastes wonderful.

This quiche is phenomenal.  I made it for a competition and the only reason it didn't place was because I used a cheap store-bought crust (BIG no-no - it tasted waaayyy too floury).  I can imagine if you make it with a homemade crust it would be absolutely perfect.  I am DEFINITELY holding on to this recipe.  All the flavors blend marvelously, and the sour cream mixture at the bottom is amazing.  This one is truly a keeper.  Make this now!

WOW!  Need I say more.  This was absolutely delicious!  I must say, it was hard to know which review I should foolow the advice of because some said it overflowed and some said it turned out perfectly.  It comes down to a matter of things like: how finely you dice and what size onion or whether you use large eggs or jumbo eggs.  Some said it cooked in the specified amount of time and others said it took alot longer.  My answer to that is to know your own oven.  I did pre-bake my pie crusts for 5 min. because they were the frozen variety, and next time I will pre-bake them a little longer.  As for the recipe the taste is wonderful.  I did have a small overflow with my recipe, but by following Clark's advice and putting a cookie sheet in the oven the mess required minimal cleanup.    Excellent, excellent, excellent!

This is a wonderful quiche recipe! I used 2 9" deep dish crusts and had exactly enough, down to the last drop! Instead of mixing the spinach with the sour cream layer, I substituted some finely sliced fresh chives in the sour cream for a little extra onion flavor (we love onions) and just mixed the spinach into the egg batter. I also prebaked my crusts for about 4-5 minutes before filling to take the "rawness" out of the bottom layer of dough. Both quiches came out picture perfect and the flavors were wonderful! Just a tip for some of the reviewers who are commenting that their quiche came out runny: If you follow the recipe and (most importantly!)preheat your oven well as directed, there is no reason that you should have to bake the quiche longer than 45 minutes. The crucial part of quiche is to let it set for at least 10 minutes before slicing, as it continues to "carry over cook" as it cools/sets. Thanks so much for the great recipe, Clark! It's now our new favorite quiche dish and we can't wait to have leftovers for breakfast!

Really disappointed. The bottom crust was raw and I cooked it past the time recommended. You really need a deep dish pie plate for this quiche if you're going to make it, too. I've a mess in my oven now. I don't know about the recipe's taste--the raw bottom crust turned me off. Very disappointing.

I love this quiche!  I do use less spinach so that my kids will eat it.  I also only use either bacon or ham, doubling the amount as stated to compensate.  I have no problem with the amounts of cheese, but do have to reduce the eggs to 6 if I am using a store bought crust.  Whenever we go camping, I make these ahead of time, and we eat it for breakfast the next day.  One of the best leftover recipes I know of!

Clark, thank you so much for this recipe. It is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. You don't need to add any salt...you already get enough from the bacon and ham. Also, it took a lot longer than expected to prepare all the ingredients....but it was worth it. I cooked them on a pan in the oven because they were so full. It overflowed, but I don't care. It was great. Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  Made this for Mother's Day and the whole family (young and old) devoured it.  The flavors are rich and the recipe easy to assemble. This is a forgiving recipe and allows personal biases in altering the quantity of various ingredients added.  This is a good recipe that every cook should print and keep.

I served this recipe with three other wonderful All Recipes recipes:
Strawberry Spinach Salad I
To Die For Blueberry Muffins
Molten Chocolate Cakes With Sugar-Coated Raspberries

This quiche was just okay. I made it because it was rated 5 stars and was disappointed. I should have used deep dish pie shells because I had tons of leftover filling. I didn't have room to use all the eggs and half and half called for either.  And it baked faster, overflowed, and made a thick, brown skin on top. If I were to make it again, I also would have used bacon OR ham, not both. All the ingredients made for a heavy quiche.

I used 2 regular pie dishes, so I had to cut back on the egg. I should have baked the pie crust (edges wrapped in foil) for 5-8 minutes or so before filling it because the pie crust was undone! Used very little salt (bacon and ham had enough). Delicious, will make again with changes.

I chose this dish because of all the high ratings - although almost everyone had to make changes.  I too HAD to make changes and was glad I had the advice of others to follow.  I cut the cheese in half and it was more than enough - I cut the eggs back to 6 and the amount of half and half to a cup.  I was using deep dish pie crusts.  If I hadn't done all that cutting back it would have been a mess and I would have been throwing out a lot of the ingredients.  I didn't use salt and I'm glad I didn't.  The smoked ham had enough of a salt taste.  All in all - with all the changes that had to be made I think I will explore other quiches to try before I would make this again.

fantastic quiche!  used 2 deep-dish pie  shells and could have easily filled another...prebaked the pie shells for 5 minutes and the crust was perfect!  also, used a combo of swiss cheese, monterrey jack, and parmesan.  substituted fresh sauteed spinach for the frozen since i had it on hand.  just came out great!  will make again and again....thx clark!

WOW ... We luved it.  My family and I do not like Quiche, per se' however, we had several items left over from Easter, including ham and thought to try the concoction ... this was simply delicious!  My grandmother and mother-in-law have since requested the recipe.  We did use Carnation milk instead of cream and added 3/4 c. of feta cheese (yup, feta) and it was simply devine!!  Thanks a bunch for a great recipe ...keep em coming!

Excellent! Made it for Easter dinner, my sister said "I don't like quiche," then ate three pieces! I did use my glass 9" pie pan, but it still wasn't big enough. I'd use just 3 eggs for each pie next time. This is a keeper.

FABULOUS!  We had friends over for brunch and it was gone in a hurry.  My husband doesn't like mushrooms so we left those out, and we used canadian bacon instead of ham since that's what we had.  The only thing I would do differently is to buy deep dish pie crust because the egg mixture didn't all fit.  Thanks for sharing a definate keeper.

Wow, this quiche is delicious! Very very rich, however. I thought it was a little too much on the creamy side. Next time I'll probably add another egg and decrease the sour cream/cream mixture by a little bit. I also left out the spinach and added some green pepper instead...it works just as well!

FANTASTIC!!

I did mod the recipe a little - I halved everything in addition to omitting the onion, ham and parmesan cheese. Instead, we added some chopped red peppers, used Kraft Mexican blend shredded cheese and just added more bacon than called for here.

This came out beautifully and my two guests LOVED it.

Thanks!!

"This is the best quiche I've ever had" is what I got from two different people. It's a fantastic recipe. I reserved the bacon grease and sauteed the onions/mushrooms in it. Next time I would use half of the bacon grease..because I thought it was too salty. I also used only cheddar..that's all I had. But it was simply amazing.

I have made of ton of quiches, but this is the best!  I played around with the recipe and added other items in place of those listed-WONDERFUL!  Great recipe and can adjust to what you have or want to use (or get rid of) and it turns out fantastic!  Thanks!!

Delicious! I didn't bother with olive oil for sauteing the onions and just threw them in the same pan after I cooked and removed the bacon. Omitted the mushrooms for our taste. Very pretty presentation and tasty! Thanks!

Awesome dish. I made a double batch. And did not include the ham.I did have some leftover cheese and a little spill over. I found that if I patted down the cheese layer I could get more egg. Will share this and make again!

I made this for Mother's Day brunch today and it was delicious and a hit!  We had a small group, so I was able to send the 2nd quiche home for leftovers.  I love the flexibility of adding or deleting ingredients and having it for any meal.  Thanks!

I followed everyone's advice and I still only found this recipe to be "okay." It was bland and lacked texture. Maybe it was because I used fat free sour cream and half & half. I made one with meat and one with vegetables. I won't make again.

This is the best quiche recipe I've ever tried! I followed the recipe exactly as written (although I think I ended up with more than 2 cups of ham once it was diced) and it still fit perfectly in two standard 9" pans. I did shape the crust a little taller than normal, which helped hold in the extra ham. I didn't have a sheet big enough for both pans so I just laid a sheet of heavy duty foil on the oven rack.  Turns out I didn't need it though - it didn't spill over at all. Excellent recipe!

This was an excellent tasty recipe that I will make again.  I made a few substitutions mostly because I didn't have the items or didn't want to spend the money on them.  I left out the Bacon and The Mushrooms.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of diced ham and I only put 7 eggs and 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 cream in instead of 1 1/2.  I also just used tex mex cheese and about 1/2 cup of Asiago that I had left over in the freezer. I used 2 Tenderflake deep dish pie shells and found that it filled right to the top and puffed up in the oven.  Also put them on a tray because there was a bit of overflow. My family loved it and I'm sharing some with my co-worker today. I'm sure it will be even better today.  Thank you Clark Hamblen...

Excellent quiche.  Have no idea how Clark puts this together in 15 minutes, though.  It took me longer than that to cook bacon.  Definitely a little labor intensive with the chopping and sauteeing, but worth it.  I followed the advice not to cook the spinach -- just thawed and drained it well -- and it was fine.  I also didn't bother layering -- just stirred everything together.  I made home-made pie crust and used two standard 9" deep-dish glass pie pans, and had no trouble with the amount of ingredients.  It fit perfectly in the two pans.  Store-bought deep-dish crusts must not hold as much.  It looks as good as it tastes.

This quiche is absolutely fantastic!!! A+!
HOWEVER, I ended up having to run to the store to buy more crusts. I got 4 9" deep dish quiches out of this recipe (one without spinach), so either cut the recipe in half or buy extra pie crusts. these freeze very well. I will definitely make this again.

This quiche is my hubby's absolute favorite. The first time i made it i wasn't quite sure about it. But practice (i make it atleast 1 time a month) has aided in Quiche perfection. My recommendations are to use 1 less egg and a little less cheese. I used to have trouble with it being WAY too much for the deep dish frozen pie tins, but lessing the topping has helped. Thanks for such a great recipe! The Lord is Good and Trustworthy May we Look to JESUS today!

Good recipe! Based on other reviews, I made the following alterations: did not cook spinach; used only 6 eggs; used only ham and not bacon, added red peppers. I don't have very good luck with rolled pie crusts, so I used a "press in the pie pan" crust recipe that was easy and time-saving: 1 1/2 c. flour, 1/4 tsp. salt and 6 Tbsp. butter (directions: cut butter into flour mixed w/ salt until you have fine crumbs; pressin bottom and sides of pie pan.)  Will make again! Thanks, Clark!

EXCELLENT!!  I made this for Easter brunch last year and I'm going to make it again for Christmas!  Was requested by my family as a "keeper!"  I didn't have a problem with the pie crust not getting done like some other folks may have had.

This was so good, there goes the cholestrol.  My only problem was my egg ran all over my baking sheet.  I had the put a foil wrapper around to catch it and keep it on the pie.  It turned out so pretty and I did listen to the others and made it the day before and had it the next day.

This recipe was excellent! However, I made some changes to make it quicker. I halved the recipe to make just one quiche. I also microwaved the bacon and instead of using olive oil, I used some of the bacon grease to saute the onions for more flavor, and I didn't have any cheddar cheese, so I used a mexican blend cheese, and it came out AWSOME! Thanks for such a good recipe!!

This recipe was superb!!  I left out the mushrooms, onions, and oil, and used six slices of bacon. With these alterations,I didn't have any trouble fitting the rest of the ingredients into two 9-in. deep dish pie crusts.

Fantastic!  The flavor was great and it was a hit at brunch yesterday.  I STILL cannot figure out how to fit everything into 2 pie crusts....and yes, I used the 9 inch deep dish.  I made a bit of a mess, but oh well....I now have two extra quiches!  I will make this more than once!  Thanks Clark!!!

This is a great quiche recipe.  Be sure to allow enough cooking time and use large pie tins.  I've adapted fillings in many ways, but kept the egg/cream part constant and it always works out great.  Add hot sauce for extra zing.

Very rich, flavorful, and delicious filling, but the pastry was soggy. Will partially cook the pie shell first next time, use less filling or larger shells to prevent overflow (should've consulted the reviews before preparing), and allow at least 30 minutes prep time.

Thanks for the recipe... it was very tastey. The only thing I did differently was decrease both the ham and cheese by half.  I also added a dash of nutmeg.

The recipe was very good, the whole family enjoyed it.  However, the ingredient made 4 pies.  I froze 2 and they tasted just as delicious as the fresh one 2 weeks later.

Very delicious.  My sister and I mixed everything together and put the mixture in prepared frozen puff pastry cups and served them as appetizers.  Worked out quite well.

I've made this recipe twice and it turned out beautifully both times. Even my picky eaters loved it. It actually looks and tastes better than the quiche served at our local gourmet tearoom.

Turned out amazing. What I did differently was
* instead of spinach I used 1 med size spaghetti squash and let it cool off for awhile so it was dry.
* Instead of ham I used maple sausage from the night before.
* Also I didn't have (unexpired ha ) sour cream so I substituted plain greek yogurt. Ended up making 3 9inch pies
Was fantastic!

Delicious, hearty quiche I‚Äôve made countless times and it‚Äôs always a hit. It definitely makes 3 quiches if you‚Äôre just using regular store-bought frozen pie crusts.

This was awesome. I cooked the crust prior to baking.  I used red bacon, red pepper, onion and sausage instead of ham.

Made this the day after thanksgiving day. I have some leftover ham and most of the ingredients. This is so delicious! Everyone loved it. I read most of the reviews but I followed the exact recipe. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to rate it if you alter the recipe to your liking. So, this recipe is legit! Loved it!

GREAT QUICHE !  I didn't change a thing. I used big pie shells, don't think they were quite deep dish, and just pressed the edges on the store bought ones instead of crimping. they were perfect.

Fantastic!! Bought deep dish pie crusts, but still needed 3 as there was no way everything was fitting in 2, but that was fine for me! Prep did take closer to 45 minutes, but I lack skills.  Totally worth it, though.  Split into 3 pies, a 1/6th pie serving is PERFECT for keto diet.  This is going to be a meal prep go-to recipe for me. Love it!!!

Terrific and easy recipe.  I made it with the crust (prebaked as recommended by others) and without the crust and enjoyed it equally both ways.  Without the crust, it is a great low carb option.

I just gave this recipe a try, played it pretty fast and loose with the ingredients and quantities of each. The really interesting thing for me about this recipe was using the sour cream in with the eggs and cream. Would definitely make it again!

You end up with too many ingredients in the pie and no room for the final wet ingredients‚Ä¶. mix it all up and put in the shell... if there's any mix left over cook it in an omelet the next day...

I've been making this one "as is" for years and it's my favorite go to recipe! It freezes wonderfully, but as my boys grow (along with their appetites), I rarely get the opportunity to freeze the second one anymore! Love it!

I made this recipe for Easter Brunch with relatives and everyone loved it. I was a bit leery of the spinach/sour cream mix on the bottom, but I made it as directed and it was fantastic. I stuck to the recipe, but I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and used Gouda, which I had on hand in place of the jack cheese. Great recipe, a keeper for sure. Thanks Clark!

Great quiche recipe. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and pieced the pie dough to fit. I used only the ham. This made it a super easy and quick dish to get in the oven. Will make again.

I can't believe it...it tastes better than it looks, and it looks wonderful! I used what I had on hand, heavy cream, Swiss cheese instead of cheddar, and the crust? I just make my own. Took 11 minutes and always tastes great!!

I absolutely love the quiche and everyone who tries it loves it too. The only change I make is instead of olive oil, I use some of the bacon grease to saut√© the onions and mushrooms. I also use shaved Parmesan instead of grated if that‚Äôs what I have on hand.

I served this on Christmas morning for brunch and it was a sure hit. Because a couple of my kids are vegetarian I made one with bacon (no ham) and one without. I reduced the eggs  from 8 to 6. There was only one generous piece of the vegetarian quiche left over which my daughter microwaved the next day and raved about it.

I‚Äôve made a lot of quiches over the years and this one is a keeper! I love the combination of the spinach and sour cream along with the addition of Parmesan cheese.  It just gave  it that extra yum!!! I omitted the bacon and cut the recipe in half to make just one quiche. I will def make this again.

If someone like the ingredients in this recipe, It is a great recipe!  The person who put a negative rating on this must have done it wrong.  I actually put the egg in before the cheeses or it still worked out great!   Did anyone notice large eggs and getting larger?  I had a little extra egg that was too much for the recipe!

This was my first time making quiche.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  I modified mine a little, one was bacon, broccoli and mushrooms.  The other was spinach, salmon and mushrooms.

I loved this recipe! I worked with what I had. I used  chopped onions, mushrooms and  and broccoli and stirred it into he sour cream. I also used sharp cheddar, mozzarella and fresh parmesan and bacon and sausage. It was wonderful. It didn‚Äôt quite fill two deep dish pie plates. I think I didnt have the exact same amount of veggies to substitute for the spinach.  It baked in 35 minutes.  I think you could substitute any meat and cheese. The thing that makes this so tasty and unique is the sour cream layer. By far the best quiche I ever made. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My first time making and eating a quiche. I decided to cut corners by buying the already made chopped bacon from Hormel. Also I used honey ham slices chopped into pieces. I added bell peppers on top of the ingredients listed. Instead of using dried parsley, I used dried cilantro since I have that on hand. It turned out really well the only criticism I have is that I followed the egg mixture/custard as directed but I had leftover liquid after pouring it onto my quiche. So, if I do make this next time, I may have to cut down on probably seven eggs and a cup of half and half and see how it turns out.

Yes, I  made changes and will make it again soon and make a few more and then give another review. Loved it but I think I didn't put it together right. The one my wife made the week before was so much tastier than mine. But almost exact same ingredients. Third times a charm.

Outstanding!........Even my amateur chef brother said it was the best quiche ever.  I really only have one negative, all the ingredients listed do not fit into two deep dish 9" pie pans. It's not a problem however, I simply made the unused ingredients into omelet for breakfast.

Love it! We make it all the time in a crustless version in a 9x13 glass pan. We use ham instead of bacon, and throw anything on hand in.

This is awesome!  I added some saut√©ed chopped  red bell pepper & minced garlic as suggested by other reviewers.  We had several meals of leftover quiche, warmed in oven - leftovers were as tasty as the first day!  Will definitely make this again.

This is delicious! I didn‚Äôt like how the spinach tasted with the crust so I tried it without a crust and it was much better. Also I left out the mushrooms because they are gross! With those changes my family loves it.

We all love this recipe!  The only thing that I did different was that I saut√©ed the onions and mushrooms in unsalted butter versus the olive oil.  It tastes a bit richer than with the olive oil.  We have this for dinner at times with Arrowhead's Blackberry Wine.  (If you've never had this wine, be prepared, it will be the only wine you ever drink again)!  Plus, a crusty bread!

This quiche was absolutely fabulous!  It was moist and flavorful and every single person that had a bite raved about it!  The opening comments were correct...you'd be sad if you only made one!  The only suggestion I have is to purchase a deep dish pie crust to better hold all the filling.  YUM!

Ingredients and quantities make three quiche pies.  Make sure to buy deep crust pies!!  It's in the oven now and smells wonderful. Two pie crusts wouldn't hold all of the content, so, better to make three than have uncooked leftovers.

I used this recipe as a starting point, as I wanted to use the ingredients I had on hand. I halved the recipe to only make 1 quiche, but found that I still needed more like 6 eggs to fill up my deep pie dish. Instead of the bacon layer, I used ground turkey, onion, and jalape√±o. Next time I might put some raw jalape√±o in instead of cooking down before baking to retain some of the heat. I also used fresh mozzarella and tomatoes for a top layer, in addition to cheddar. Turned out delicious! Lots of flavor!

I made this exactly as directed, and baked it in a ceramic pie pan on a preheated baking sheet.  The top didn‚Äôt puff and it was not set after 40 minutes.  I baked it another 15 minutes, and while the flavor was good, the crust was very soggy.  How do you get that crispy crust?  Should I have used a glass or metal pan?

I made a few slight changes:
Instead of spinach or mushrooms I did some pre-cooked broccoli. I did a full pound of bacon but left out the ham.
Oh my gosh, this was the BEST quiche I've EVER had.  The filling seemed to fill up my two pie plates perfectly, and I was SO glad to have the second one to freeze, since it was so amazingly delicious!

It was fantastic. My husband wasn‚Äôt too thrilled when he heard I was making quiche but he admitted it was delicious. I added garlic and two green chilies and saut√©ed them with onions. It added a nice spice.

Layer some of the cheese between spinach and mushroom mixture.  Better the second day.

I added crab meat instead of the ham and omitted the bacon. I also used fresh spinach and saut√©ed with the onions  before adding to other ingredients. My family LOVED IT!!!! I like that the recipe was made for the two quiches as this is how the shells are packaged. Eat one, Freeze one! Will definitely make this again and again!

Incredible quiche!   I have made a few times and always a hit in my home.  Frozen store bought deep dish crust is really not large enough for the filling but that just means that the quiche is brimming with goodness when it is baked.    Freezes very well.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  A true favorite!

Love this recipe.  I always add sun dried tomato.  I sometimes swap spinach for chopped broccoli I have  been known to add roasted garlic, and a few capers.  I have also added several tablespoons of pesto.  I always get rave reviews.  An extra quiche to freeze for later what's not to like.   If you have too much egg left over and or other ingredient save for scrambled eggs and add the extra filling as mix ins the next day.

This was so delicious! I made this for my potluck brunch last year and my husband literally proposed to me that day!!!! So I consider this my "good luck" dish. I will definitely use deep dish crust and only six eggs next time.

Excellent recipe. Don't have to bother cooking spinach. Just used frozen chopped spinach and followed the recipe. Made two crustless quiche in 9 inch deep dish pie pans. One is gone and one in the freezer!  Great way to have meals ready as needed.

I made this quiche for work a few weeks ago, my first time ever making quiche, and it turned out fantastic!  Not knowing much about making it, and seeing all the hundreds of recipes and variations, I was hoping it would turn out.  EVERYONE at work (including my parents as I left the second one home for them) said it was delicious!
Tweeks:  I left out the onions and mushrooms since many picky eaters don't like them.  I used just bacon, and added broccoli along with the spinach.  I personally don't care for parsley so I skipped that as well.  I made my own pie crusts as well...super simple and really takes it over-the-top.
I'm making another quiche as I write this to take to work again tomorrow upon request...I have a feeling my coworkers are going to make me keep bringing this on a regular basis!  Thank you!!!  
EDIT 7/10/18:  I made this recipe again for my coworkers (as they kindly requested), and ended up adding the onions.  Definitely makes it much more flavorful!  I pan fried my bacon and decided to go ahead and brown the onions in the bacon grease, instead of using olive oil.  Can't waste any bacon ;)

I prebaked the pie shells for 10 min & made the recipe per Clark's instructions. It was fabulous. Will definitely make it again. So glad I have another pie to freeze for later. 
 A few reviews said the egg mixture ran over the filled pie shell. Mine did too, until I verrryyy slowly poured it on top. This gave it time to soak into the filling.

Well, something must be wrong.  Carefully followed the recipe and double checked the amount of each ingredient used.  But when it came time to add the 8 egg/mixture (size of eggs not noted-used large) only 1/2 of the egg mixture could be added and the egg mixture overflowed-what a mess.   The spinach on  the bottom of the pie shell (deep dish shells might have worked better but was not noted) left the pie too soft and was difficult to scoop out and not really great for leftovers.

Like most recipes, I used this as a template, or a suggestion. I was only going to make one quiche instead of two as the directions dictate. I failed to cut the sour cream in half and midstream, I thought about it and used the normal amount of eggs to sour cream ratio. Baked it all in a 9X9 pyrex baking dish and it turned out great. I'll use this as a suggestion again, just gotta find ingredients that my picky eater will eat though.

I  made a few changes:  I made it as a crustless quiche  (be sure to grease pan), added some different herbs, substituted Swiss for Monterey jack cheese.  I  thought it was great and so did my other half, who doesn't like quiche.

This quiche was great!  I should take off one star because there is NO WAY it takes 15 minutes to prepare.  As one person said, just sauteeing the bacon alone can take that long...it took me well over one hour.  I did make some changes and substitutions . I do not eat onions and mushrooms, so I omitted them altogether.  I used a 12 ounce package of spinach as that is all they had at the grocery, and instead of ham, which I dislike in quiche, I double the bacon as someone suggested.  
I had looked at a lot of other recipes and actually misread this one, and I prebaked the pie crust as the package of pie crust suggested for quiche for about 8 minutes.  Unfortunately the box did not say to weigh the bottom crust  with anything, (e.g. aluminum foil with beans or pennies on it) which I should have done, as it puffed up and cracked when I took it out.  
   That said,  I did the rest as described and it  looks okay.I did bake it convection mode, as I could not fit two pie plates on one standard baking sheet and put them  on two  oven racks.  I cooked it at 325 degrees for about 40 minutes or so.  It tastes really good!  Even without the onions and mushrooms and ham!

Really good & everybody loved it. I ended up using 12 eggs total and also increased the amount of cream as 8 eggs did not fill my pie pans. Had to increase the cooking time to about 55 minutes because of the extra liquid. Cheesy & delicious, but might cut back the cheese next time (5-6 oz of each + parmesan).

I found it to be a little, 'wet'. I don't know if it was the spinach, but it tasted great. I think I would cut back a little on the liquids next time and perhaps wring out my spinach a little tighter, as well.

Amazingly good!  It is also forgiving of changes, as I had no sour cream. I used cream cheese thinned out by milk with a few drops of lemon juice to counteract the sweetness. (Thank youfor that idea, Mom!) I also used onions, mushrooms and fresh crushed garlic.  I will never eat another omelet again!

Tweaked the recipe a tiny bit and served it to my friends for brunch.  It was a major hit.  Everyone in the neighborhood was talking about "my quiche"!

Great. Made changes due to what I had on hand. Milk instead of half and half, cooked ground turkey sausage instead of bacon and ham, and nonfat plain greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream.

Delicious! I used all bacon instead of ham, added a half red bell pepper to the onions, no mushrooms, buttermilk instead of half and half, no Swiss cheese, and placed sliced jalape√±os on top of the mixture. I made one with the pie shell and one without. I brushed the pie shell with egg white and baked 10 min before adding the filling as others suggested and my crust was perfect. I like spicy foods so next time I think I'll add a little hot sauce to the egg mixture. But it was wonderful and looked pretty too!

It's a good recipe. No if's and's or but's about it. 

We used frozen deep dish pie crusts and had to use 3 for the entire recipe.

I would think 2, 9 inch deep dish pie plates would hold the recipe but I'm skeptical.

OMG best quiche ever!! Of course I made a few mods like adding garlic, less cheese, fresh spinach, no ham, green onions and I added a little mayo just because... I made it in 2 regular pie crusts instead of one deep dish and both of them only lasted a week in our house of just me and my husband!  I will pre bake the crust a bit next time because it was a little soggy, probably bc I used fresh spinach, but it was still delectable

This was delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, however I did make it with a shortbread crust and it added an amazing sweet taste to it. Loved this! I will absolutely make this again! Make sure you make both pies as you will want the second one the next day!

This is my go to quiche recipe! I love it as does my family. Deep dish pie plates are a must and I like to bake the crust for about 10mins before filling to help them cook completely. This is the perfect solution to leftover ham from a holiday. I have done with and without bacon, and find that if I double the ham and saut√© it a bit in replacement for the cooking the bacon step, it comes out great. We eat one and freeze the second (in the glass pie plate). It is just as delicious even after being frozen. It's an easy stand by and excellent for company.

My family thought this was pretty good.  Next time I'll combine the spinach mix with the ham mix & cheeses, topping with a little more cheese.  The flavors were really good.

I recommend not adding the meat.  The pies will likely overflow, so be sure to put some sort of baking pan under the quiches to catch the extra egg and cheese while it's cooking.

I have been looking for a quiche recipe as an alternative to a Quiche Lorraine recipe that I have made for years. I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out great - hearty and delicious. My picky husband, who doesn't like mushrooms, didn't even notice them, and he thought it was delicious, too. Thank you!

This is a great recipe, and my first time making quiche! I used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon, no ham, no parmesan, and about half the other cheese, but it still turned out fantastic. I will definitely be making this again!

Surprisingly, my picky 13 year old liked this and ate seconds the next day... though she did say she still likes the commercial quiches better.  I only made one, and a little extra that I baked crustless in a soup bowl since it just wouldn't fit in the pie tin.  (Even so, it ran over the edge of the crust.)

Amazing quiche! Those who say otherwise obviously don't know how to cook... so don't listen to them ;) You'll definitely need that deep dish pie crust! I went vegetarian with this and omitted the bacon and ham. I used more mushrooms and spinach instead. Yummy!

Delicious!  I will definitely use this again.  I am sure it is worthy of 5 stars as is .                    
I also don't like when people rate a completely altered recipe.  I only substituted where I did not have two required ingredients.  I used deli- turkey in place of ham, which I added to the cooking  bacon when almost crisp for added flavor.  I had used my spinach to make spinach dip, so used about 1 cup of the prepared spinach dip with additional sour cream for creamy consistency and you will love the results.  Thanks for this recipe.  One quiche to serve, and one to freeze for later!

I've never made a quiche before and this recipe got a 10 out of 10 rating from my son! I made 2 versions. One bacon and jalape√±o the other breakfast sausage, spinach and mushroom. I egg washed and pre baked my pie crust  for 10 minutes. For the bacon/jalape√±o I cooked and crumbled a package of bacon, saut√©ed 2 chopped jalape√±os, 1/2 a small chopped onion and a clove of minced garlic. For the sausage, spinach, mushroom I used 1/2 a package of breakfast sausage browned and crumbled, saut√©ed 3 cups of chopped fresh spinach, 1/2 an onion, 4 large chopped mushrooms, and 1 clove minced garlic. I split the sour cream, cheese and egg mixture into 2 separate bowls but followed the amounts per the recipe. It came out wonderful- great flavor in both quiches. Will definitely make again!

This took quite a bit of time to chop everything up, but oh my goodness, was it good!!  This was the best quiche I've ever had.  My 14 year old son agrees.

This is my absolute favorite recipe out of the many I've obtained from this site.  The flavors blend so well together - it is pure perfection.  Yes, it takes time to prepare, but I make four pies at a time and freeze.  Delicious!!  Thank you, Clark.

This recipe is a Christmas classic in my house.  Though I love it just as it is written, I have made many changes over the years to accommodate the preferences of my family.  Because so many people don't like mushrooms, I leave them out.  I also leave out the bacon because most of the females who come to Christmas brunch seem to think that there is too much meat.  Since I prefer ham to bacon, I leave out the bacon and add the ham.  I notice the men seem to love the meat-loaded version, though not a one has ever complained about the just ham version.  I also often add some diced red bell peppers for color and flavor.  

No matter how you choose to adjust the meats or veggies, you can't go wrong with this recipe as a base.

Loved it, and so did my picky husband! The only minor changes we made were due to a lack of ingredients, and gf pie crusts.

The only thing I can think of is to note that 8oz of cheese needs to be measured with a liquid measuring cup - NOT the bag it comes in. That was TERRIBLY confusing for about ten seconds.

I've made this recipe several times for family functions and it's been perfection every single time. I have frozen it and it still tastes so incredible. Crustless with parchment to line the pie dish works really well so that you don't have to scrape egg off your pie plate for weeks!! It's perfection in a pie plate!!!!

This didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped - layering it and pouring the egg over the top kept the flavors separated rather than blending them together.  I eat it because I spent so long making it, but no one else finished their first slice.  It wasn't bad, just kind blah.

I have made this dozens of times.  For my wedding breakfast,  I made 10 the day before,  with minor variations,  a few vegetarian,  a few with no mushrooms,  ect.  and they were a big hit.  We had a few left over,  so we froze them,  and they were great a couple of weeks later,  all we did was thaw them and eat. 

They look fancy,  take very little effort and taste devine.

I left out the mushrooms (I don't like mushrooms much) and baked the crust before I added the ingredients. Followed the rest to a tea and it was amazing. Will definitely make this again and again!

Oh just made this today, this is the best quiche I've ever had! So creamy and delicious. I substituted bacon with turkey bacon and skipped the ham. Used the cheeses I had at home sharp cheddar and Parmesan cheese and mozzarella. It turned out fantastic. I highly recommend !

Great and easy to make quiche. We had mushroom, zucchini, and ham to use up, so this was a terrific way to have them. We skipped the spinach, by I'll try that next time. Added just a little fresh ground nutmeg too. I'll use this as my base quiche recipe and add what we have in the fridge. Love to find ways to  make great use of food you need to use up!

This was a hit at my husband's office potluck.  Followed the recipe completely. We loved it at home and they loved it work. Awesome recipe. Crust is nice and flakey . The only thing I would do differently is I would bake my pie crust  for 15  mins then add the layers. Other than that this Quiche is warm comfort food anytime. Yummy

Just took this out of the oven...based on all the reviews I felt compelled to make this. One helpful hint I want to pass on...I found a bag of "Casserole Cheese" in the cheese section of grocery store that had Monterey Jack, Cheddar, and Mozzarella so I bought that and added Parmesan.  Also added red bell pepper for color as others suggested. Be careful adding ingredients to pie shell, it gets full quickly. Yum!

I served this quiche for a brunch and it was a big hit.  I didn't change anything.  I used the pillsbury pie crusts in my glass pie pans and I have to admit I was wondering if  everything would fit.  It did and I couldn't be more pleased.  No spillover or soggy crust.  Thank you Clark.

This is an amazing quiche! You DEFINITELY want to make two pies or you will run out. I make this quiche at least once a month for my fiance and myself. I slice it and freeze it and we eat it for breakfast for a week. Bake the crust before adding the filling or it gets gummy.

We love this recipe. After making it a few times, we have decided it's really large enough for three quiches instead of two by adding two more eggs (10 total) and another half cup of half-and-half (2 cups total). With only two quiches, we always ended up with extra mix pouring over the sides - even with deep dish.

This is very good. A little labor extensive but i made my own crusts. The only thing I'd change is ....I would add no salt. With the cheese, bacon and ham you don't need it. Its also nice it's makes 2. Same amount of work for one, so its nice to have leftovers to to share.

I replaced the mushrooms with some asparagus since my wife doesn't like mushrooms and I used a mix of whole cream and 2% milk in place of half and half. Otherwise I made the recipe as stated. It was delicious! It is the best quiche I have ever had. My wife and I both loved it!

This quiche is amazzzzzzzing!!! I made it about 2 years ago and I was my favorite thing I have ever eaten for breakfast! It is a lot of ingredients and it was quite time consuming so I haven't made it since but now I am dying to make it again. I don't even like eggs but it's seriously so delicous! I'm so glad I found the recipe again! Can't wait to make it!

Great recipe.  Some tips for faster prep - chop bacon before cooking (very easy to do), fry a few minutes then add onion, and ham.  Produces very little fat which is used in place of olive oil to fry onion.  Prep eggs and spinach mixture (I chopped frozen broccoli instead to save time) while bacon/onion cooks.  I had these in the oven in ten minutes, even with my 7 year old "helping".  I cut way down on the cheese, simply because I didn't have enough, and it was still great.  I also used skim milk in place of half and half, because we like to save that for our coffee...point being that you can switch up ingredients based on what you have on hand and it still turns out well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh, this recipe is evil because of all the fat and sodium... but it has all the good things! How can you go wrong with bacon, spinach, mushrooms, ham, and cheese? I'd double the mushrooms and maybe halve the spinach to compensate because I'm that much of a mushroom junkie, but that's only because I have an unholy affection for mushrooms, not because the balance is off. The only thing that might *possibly* improve this recipe would be the addition of 1/4 tsp of anchovy paste to bring out the flavor of the mushrooms, but maybe that's just me and my mushroom addiction.

Turned out marvelous! Could only fit about half the cheese in without the egg spilling over. Used fresh parsley, looked very appealing. Family loved this for Easter dinner. I used Morning star meatless sausage crumbled up in one quiche due to a vegetarian guest. We enjoyed - thank you.

I made this quiche this morning for Easter Brunch. It was so good. Everyone loved it. I purchased two regular sized 9 inch frozen pie crusts by accident instead of the deep dish crusts. I ended up making this exact recipe, but split the ingredients between the two pie crusts and one crustless quiche. Each one came out perfectly and was so delicious. I liked the crustless quiche just as much as the ones with crust so next time I may just make two crustless pies. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

My family of 4 all enjoyed the quiche.  I baked two and put one into the freezer afterwards for a weeknight meal.  I don't own two pie pans (terrible, I know), so baked one of them in the Pampered Chef stone deep dish baker.  It worked like a charm.  The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because we weren't crazy about the sour cream/spinach combo on the bottom (I know, we are definitely the minority here).  My kids will always eat spinach when I make it with eggs, but I always use fresh and mix it up with the eggs before baking. They both curled their noses and threw mini-fits at the high concentration of spinach in the bottom of their pie piece tonight.  They still ate it, but they ate the other layers first :)  It would work better for my family if I used fresh spinach and mixed all ingredients together instead of layering. Overall, it still was a great meal!

I bet I've made this quiche a hundred times now.  Even when I have to tweak (have fresh instead of frozen spinach etc) it turns out great.  I always make the 2 and freeze one.  Perfect for unexpected company

I made this for Food Day at work. Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe. Make sure you use Deep Dish pie crusts. I decreased the eggs to 7 and had to decrease the cheese because it wouldn't all fit in the shells. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The prep time takes about an hour. I don't know how the author could possibly have done it in 15 minutes. FYI: Walmart has Great Value branded shredded cheese packages with a blend of Monterey Jack and Cheddar!

This is absolutely delicious!!! I would not change anything. I helped my 11 year old make this for a cooking competition and she was the overall winner in the egg category! Thanks, Clark! She's super excited to make this quiche for regionals!

Perfection! This is the best breakfast quiche I've ever made. We didn't have ham, so I used smoked turkey sausage. The flavors were amazing and my family of 3 devoured both pies in less than 24 hours. I will make this over and over again. Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for how I made it.  All the fat and calories in this recipe made me cringe so I lightened it up. The light version was excellent. I made only one quiche so only need one pie crust.  Spread about 1/4 cup of nonfat Greek yogurt in bottom of pie (instead of sour cream).  Layered on fresh spinach that I had wilted with hot water and squeezed very dry.  Then layered on saut√©ed onion, zucchini, tomato, to which I added a little diced ham (actually deli ham that I had left over from bagette sandwiches).  Then layered a little bit of swiss cheese (like three slices also left over from sandwiches).  Then topped with 5 eggs plus one egg white mixed with about 1/3 cup of skim milk plus 1 T flour and 1/4 t. baking powder. Popped it in the oven at 350 for the recommended 40 minutes and it was absolutely delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe that modifies easily!

Delicious. Mine fit well into a Marie calendars frozen pie crust. The only change I made was to switch out the spinach for broccoli like others have also done. Used fresh broccoli and chopped it up fairly small. Didn't need to blanch it or anything prior to mixing with the sour cream. Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes and I left out the bacon because I didn't have any.  It was delicious, but made way too much filling for two pie crusts (yes, I used deep dish crusts).  Most of my egg and cream mixture ended up on the pan under the pie plates.  I would suggest that you either halve the recipe or have extra crusts prepared just in case.  I will definitely give this recipe another try.

Easy to make and very tasty recipe ! I used fresh raw spinach mixed with the sour cream, no onion or mushroom, since it was for breakfast. I'll defenitly keep the recipe.

Loved the recipe. Ho I made healthier. I use a Crustless version. Lightly greased pie pans. I also used part Eggbeaters and I used Evaporated skim milk with some 1/2 &1/2. I used a lower fat cheese. No body knew the difference and did not miss the crust. It was really good and allowed for a second piece.

Amazing! Added 4 more eggs than called for because it seemed to dry. Made 4 quiches instead of 2. I have taken them to baby showers & pot lucks and everyone always think they came from a restaurant because they taste that good! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have always wanted to fix quiche but was to chicken to. My family thinks of eggs as well eggs, but I decided to try it. My husband and I ate on it for three days. We love it. I had to modify it according to what I had and it was amazing!!!

This is a yummy recipe. I made mine in a muffin tin for 6 and cut the recipe in half.   I never use pie crusts for my quiches. To me that's just extra calories. You need to let them sit for at least 20 minutes if you're not using a piecrust to ensure they stay firm.  However next time I might try just putting a very thin piece of the pie crust in the bottom.  My personal preference is a creamier quiche topping so next time I will use three eggs to 3/4 cup cream instead of the four eggs it called for.   I cooked this for a total of 13 minutes at 375.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count!  I use the basic recipe and change up the vegetables and meat, depending on what I'm in the mood for.  For something even more special, I use puff pastry dough, cut into small squares and put into cupcake pans for individual quiches.  Perfect to serve at a tea or bridal shower!

Great recipe. Not sure what went wrong with some of the lower reviews, but I enjoyed the flavor and will definitely make again. One thing I did do was too simply defrost the spinach and not cook it a then drain it so it would not make things soggy. I like the base and may try different proteins next time, using maybe chicken or turkey.

This is rich and delicious.  The ingredients "overfill" my store-bought deep dish pie crusts, so I reduced ingredients a bit.  Used 8 oz of sharp cheddar and about 4 oz each of jack and parmesan, 7 eggs, and only one cup of half and half.  Lots of complements on this dish

Delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe except for the ham.  I just doubled the bacon because that was what I had on hand.  I think it would've been even better with the ham.  I have eaten half of a quiche by myself over the last two days.  It does reheat well.  I will definitely make again!

This is my FAVORITE quiche recipe by far. I make it often and I modify the recipe with the ingredients that I have on hand. The last one I made with only vegetables for Lent so I upped the spice and added a bit of cayenne to give it a kick. I could eat this every day if it wasn't so caloric, lol.

I've made this numerous times and I was never disappointed ! I did add sriracha to it to add some spiciness as well as cayenne, but over all I love it to death

Really simple, really easy, and really good. However, I must confess that it is my firm belief that there is no such thing as too much bacon or too much cheese. I think you get where I'm going here. ;)

The taste was really good, but followed the recipe to a T and the crust at teh bottom was undercooked.   We had to eat it without the crust.

First recipe I tried. This is the Perfect Quiche. I use this recipe once a month. Sometimes I freeze one. I've halved it also. I have changed the fillings but never the basics. It is always consistent. Family always requests it & guests love it. Thank you for sharing.

This was very good and my family really enjoyed it. Not really a traditional style quiche but very tasty. Next time I will either pre-cook the crust or try another suggestion because the crust was very soggy.  Also this took much longer than 15 minutes to prep. One pie fed five and I froze the second one.

Received rave reviews from everyone, and versatile enough to easily make your own, with adjusting the meats and such. Definitely took longer than 15 minutes of prep time and it was a little tricky with getting the egg mixture in, but just pour slow, and I press along the pie as I pour to help it to filter through. WONFDERFUL recipe though!

Great recipe!!!  I was looking for a quiche recipe, where I had a little flexibility to incorporate the items I had on hand.  While I didn't follow this exactly, my quiches turned out fantastic!!! Thank you for sharing ;)

My family loved this recipe!  The only reason I thought of giving it 4 stars is that it's a pretty involved recipe for me personally.  Took a little time to make but was worth it.  I did what I could to cut back on calories.  Used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  Used 6 eggs and 5 oz of each kind of shredded cheese.  Lots of substance and yumminess!

I made these for a Christmas brunch. One I made vegitarian with just onions and spinach and cheese. The other I added bacon. I didn't have half n half so I substituted evaporated milk. The quiche was a huge hit...no leftovers...so I just stuck another batch in the oven for dinner cause  I can't stop thinking about how good it was!!!

I used two 10" pie crusts and it worked out beautifully. Next time I will add more bacon and more eggs. Also added some fresh herbs from the garden. Delish.

I've made this a few times and it's always well received by everyone. It was a really big hit last Christmas when I met my boyfriends family for the first time. I wanted to make something tasty to feed the group on Christmas morning. Both pies were devoured in about 20 minutes & there were only 8 of us :)

This recipe is fantastic.  I make it every year for the neighbors at Christmas rather than cookies, and it is a huge hit.  Even have the 85-year-old next door trying to steal me away from my husband.  Just read the idea of putting an egg white wash on crust and baking.  I always bake the crust ahead of time as well, but the egg wash seems like it would make it even better.

This quiche is DELICIOUS!  The only modifications I made were to omit the mushrooms (because I don't care for them), add red bell pepper, FRESH SPINACH (roughly chopped), and turkey sausage (to cut down on the salt).  My family & co-workers cannot get enough!  The only negative thing I have to say about this recipe is that it does not specify DEEP DISH pie crusts in the ingredient list.  Without the deep dish pie crusts, I had enough left over for 1 more quiche (and I'm definitely not mad about THAT!).  I will use the base of this receipe over & over modifying the protein and vegetables for a delicious quiche EVERY TIME.  THANKS, CLARK!

Super yummy! The sour cream base is fantastic. I didn't have the spinach, so I sauteed the onion with some garlic and chopped fresh brocolli. Mixed with the sr crm for the bottom layer. Also, only used Swiss cheese. I was concerned when I put it together that there wasn't enough liquid, but it came out of the oven beautifully.

Outstanding recipe!  One of my guests did not care for mushrooms or spinach so we substituted Canadian bacon and pepperoni for those ingredients. This is such a versatile recipe and it's very easy to add your favorites.  I believe this is the best quiche I've ever had the pleasure to eat and it will always be in my recipe box. It takes awhile to prepare and the first time I made it I didn't realize I needed a large deep dish pie plate however it made 2 quiches using the small foil pie plates which was perfect because we had 1 left over for breakfast the following morning.  I think refrigerating overnight helps the flavors marry for better flavor.

Great recipe but I too have some suggestions.  Please the cookie sheet on the shelf below the quiches so the bottom crust cooks thoroughly.  I also substituted swiss cheese along with a blend of Colby/Monterey Jack and paremasan.  I also used 2 small cans of mushrooms which I chopped and sauted with the onions, ham and bacon.  Yummy and glad I made two.

My go-to quiche recipe because I like the ratio of egg to meat to half-and-half.  I've tweaked it with more meat, less cheese, more veg and it still comes out great.  Highly recommend.

I made this meatless and added broccoli, I also used milk instead of heavy cream. Amazing dish that would taste great with any combination of meats and/or veggies. The mixture of spinach and sour cream on the bottom was so yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

It's true.  You'll never need another quiche recipe.  Used fresh spinach.  And as weird as it was to spread sour cream/spinach over the crust, it came out great.  My husband and kids who hate sour cream never knew it was in there. Use cheese as desired.  Doesn't need that much.  Cooks quicker than a regular quiche, thank goodness!  Needed all the eggs.

First time I made quiche and it turned out great.  Made the recipe without the bacon and added some chopped red pepper.  Used low fat sour cream.  Did not cook the frozen spinach firs - just thawed and dried.  I par-baked two quiches in frozen store deep dish crusts for 20 minutes and now I have them in the freezer.  There was filling left so I baked that in a small casserole dish.  Hubby and I ate that for dinner.  Yum. Yum!

I loved this, and not only for the mix of flavors, but how gorgeous it came out.  I've been making quiche for over two decades and had been using the same old recipe.  I am so glad I tried something new, thank you Clark!  This would also be a lovely gift for all of those times when we need to help someone out with a pre-cooked dish, or for a romantic picnic for two.   An all-round winner!

I didn't think I liked quiche much until I made this one for Easter morning. It's delicious. It does take some prep time, but it's worth it. I made the different filling layers the day before and then assembled and baked it the day of. My son loved it and didn't even a word although there was an assortment of vegetables in it. However I did substitute baby spinach as one reviewer suggested and processed the mushrooms very finely. Next time I may (or may not!) use quite as much cheese. One thing, after baking you may want to let it sit a little longer than 5-10 minutes so the inner part of the quiche has time to set up some more. Next time I'll be doing that. But it's a really wonderful, special occasion recipe!

Oh my gosh YUM. Made modifications based on what I had on hand but main recipe the same.   Made crustless and used 9x13 casserole instead of splitting between 2 pie dishes.  Baked for 42 mins at same temp and was perfect.   Used sour cream, bacon, cheese, onion, skim milk, 3 tbsp butter (since no half n half but will not add butter when make again).   Didn't have spinach or shrooms but didnt miss them.  Very delicious!!!  Will definitely make again.

UPDATE: Been using the recipe for years now, love it and always get great reviews about it.

I season the spinach mixture as I would a spinach dip (dried soup broth and dried veggies), have also done frozen chopped raw spinach no problem, or a half half combination.
The onion mixtures is usually onions, mushroom and peppers but depends what's in the fridge.
I don't use as much cheese as the recipe calls for (just sprinkle some on top)
And don't always add half-and-half, sometimes just milk or sometimes just add an extra egg if we don't have milk either
Added a bunch of dried herb blends that we often cook with.


ORIGINAL: I had enough filling for 2 deep dish pie shells.
I would add more mushroom next time. I also added some red peppers which was nice. And I would add more seasoning to the spinach mixture.

This s my go-to quiche recipe. First off, the submitter of this recipe is right...you want two quiches!  It's so tasty and is honestly easy to make.  Just buy store bought crusts.  Why bother with the prep of crust?  Every thing me I make it I get rave reviews.

Really good, but I have to say if you omitted the pie crust it might be better (I made it exactly as written). Also I don't think I would miss the bacon.

I've made this several times and each time it has been wonderful. Only sub I made was omitting the mushrooms (although I have occasionally subbed either broccoli or green/red peppers). I didn't have any problem with the cooking time, so I'm not sure why others have had problems. My favorite part was the sour cream & spinach layer - but then again I'm a sour cream junkie. Everyone who has tried this quiche has raved about it. Thanks for the recipe!

No lie, make 2 and freeze one if necessary.  Probably the best quiche I've had in a long, long time. It definitely takes up every square inch of the pie so tap out the air bubbles as you slowly add the egg mixture. It's already been added to our family's "Tested Best" recipe collection!

Gluten free family.  So I made this with a hash brown crust.  It was a hit.  I did reduce the cheese a bit.  From 16 oz to 13 and a bit less on the parmesean.  Next time I make this I'm going to try light sour cream and even less cheese just to be a little more figure friendly.  But I loved it!  I don't want to change it too much.

We made this quiche today for Thanksgiving breakfast and I have to say this is by far the BEST quiche I have ever made!!! We even gave a taste of the quiche to Kona our Lab and he loved it!!!
The only thing I changed is not adding Parmesean cheese as I am not a fan of it.  Thanks Clark for this wonderful recipe!

This is one of the best quiche recipes I have ever had.  I follow it exactly and have never had to change a thing.  The crust is always tender and flakey, the eggs, meats, cheeses and veggies blend together so well to give absolutely fantastic flavor.  I have frozen the extra and it still comes out awesome.  They don't usually last that long though!!!  Thanks Clark for a great recipe!

The flavor is good. I omitted the bacon and ham and replaced with more veggies, also reduced the cheese. 
Please edit your recipe to state that you meant "deep dish". When you don't put it in the recipe, we have no way of knowing till we're in the process of making it.

I loved it, husband thought it was ok as he is not a spinach eater, but the kids wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. In order to get everyone to eat it I would omit, or reduce, the spinach. My first quiche and it won't be my last.

Really good! I didn't add the mushroom, ham, and the tons of cheese that was called for. I cut down the recipe in half because the pie crust wasn't deep enough. I used the two store bought crust and it was enough after I half the recipe. The best quiche ever!! My 2 year old loves it so it's definitely a keeper. Thank you Clark you're awesome.

Yummy!  A lot of prep time, but the end product was well worth it.  Im sure it will go faster next time, and i have the second one in the freezer for an easy heat-up on a busy school night.  It smelled great cooking and got everyone excited to try it.  Even my picky kids approve and had seconds.  I did leave out the mushrooms b/c I knew they would never even taste it otherwise.  I also left out the ham and doubled the bacon b/c I am making ham tomorrow.  I'm sure that would be great in here though.

Very tasty and cheesy! My only criticizm is that the sour cream on the bottom seemed to soak into the crust making it very soggy. I usually coat with egg white first but didn't this time. Next time will brush with egg white or partially bake crust before adding egg mixture

Absolutely delicious! Not a Weight Watchers menu lol, but definitely a best ever! The only thing I did differently is leave out the mushrooms, but only because I didn't have any.  My spouse couldn't believe I went from "what to do with leftover baked ham" to "oh my word best quiche ever!" Thank you so much!! This will be a Thanksgiving and Christmas morning specialty!

YUMMMMMMMMMM. I  laid my thawed store-bought pie shells into two glass pie pans (used a third pie shell to add height to the crust). Organic eggs. No mushrooms...no bacon...just a little breakfast ham...steamed fresh spinach for one pie, steamed asparagus for 2nd. I added organic rosemary to both. Looks beautiful...tastes excellent. The BEST pie EVER...looks beautiful - tastes EXCELLENT.

This quiche always gets wonderful feedback.  It is full of flavor, ingredients, and indulgence.  

Two pies is worth it.  The toaster oven works great for reheating.

This has become my "go to" quiche recipe. It's great made as is or with moderations. I never use ham anymore and always use chicken as my meat in it. I have also done it with a variety of fillings. Comes out great everytime.
Thank you Clark for the great recipe!

Amazingly easy and delicious! This is the BEST quiche recipe I have ever made! The only changes I made were that I omitted the mushrooms (because I didn't have any on hand) and I substituted the ham with chicken (again, because that's all I had) and it was still a GREAT dish. The prep time was def more than 15 minutes, but it is well worth it. This is a new family favorite for us.

Unbelievable!  I used a package of fresh baby spinach instead and sauteed with onion.  Also used a red bell pepper to give it more color.  Left the ham out and used more bacon.  Used canned mushrooms because that's what I had.  Had rave reviews from our guests.  Wonderful recipe and will be making again soon.  Thanks, Clark, for sharing!

Good - but actually too much of a sour cream taste for me.  I think it lended to its creamy texture - so I will just cut back a bit next time I make it.  I also used a tart pan - which is a bit wider - and it worked perfectly (vs a deep dish pan).  Because it is wider (thinner) I reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes.

Delicious! I used fresh spinach and wilted it with some of the bacon drippings. I used colby jack, gruyere and parmesan cheeses. Make sure you use plenty of salt with the sour cream. Best quiche recipe I've found.

This was the best quiche I've ever had - and I actually made it from scratch!  I substituted 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 swiss and also used fresh spinach-- as some other reviewers recommended.  I sprayed my pie pans with nonstick cooking spray and baked the crusts for 8 min. before adding filling.  My mistake, though, was leaving the pie dough a bit too thick (more than 1/4 inch) and it made the crust kind of dry.  I covered the edges of the pie crust with a ring of aluminum foil to keep the sides from getting too brown.  My boyfriend ate over half of one pie at once -definitely 5 starts!

I made only 1 quiche and used the "serving" size option on the recipe to recalculate the ingredient amounts.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfectly.  My bottom crust was not as crisp as I would have liked, so next time  I plan to remove the pan under the dish for the last 20 min. of baking time.  I think this will help crisp up the crust.  The quiche turned out exactly as described, browned and puffy.  It was delicious and I will be making again.  The recipe does take time to prep all the ingredients so you should allow for that.  Thank you Clark for such a delicious and satisfying quiche.

SPECTACULAR! My neighbor made one similar and I was looking for the recipe on here. This was a 100 times better! Delicious and very easy to make! I did make a few preference changes. I did not add mushrooms. I used polish turkey kielbasa instead of ham and diced it pretty small. I used green/spring onions instead of parsley because that was all I had on hand. Also used a non-sweet heavy whipping cream instead of half and half because that was what hubby bought. Again this was extremely delicious, pretty sure I wouldn't have made so many changes if I would have gone grocery shopping! Haha But none the less everything worked!
Sidenote: My two toddlers absolutely ate it up. Great way to get them to eat veggies!

Fabulous quiche!!  Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  The second quiche fit perfectly into a gallon size freezer bag and will be eaten later this week when my husband needs to feed the kids while I'm off on business.

I love to make quiche when we have overnight visitors and this one is very good. I usually just wing it using whatever I have on hand but I'm glad I gave this one a try, it was wonderful.

Delicious - especially following the directions for layering. I left out the onions/mushrooms/salt/olive oil and replaced cream with 2% milk. Will do again!

Really good!!!.. And I'm not a quiche eater but this made me re-evalute. It was quick and easy. I made one for a friend in need of a meal for her family and kept the other. Didn't expect my husband to be too excited about it either but since there is so much meat it was perfect for a full dinner meal. I did cut down on the amount of bacon and made up for it with ham, just to lessen the guilt! Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this one just before Christmas and it was so good that I made it for several people as gifts for Christmas Eve.  Since they could heat it up in the morning, it was the perfect start to their Christmas Day!  It can be a little pricey to make but really is a wonderful recipe.

Very tasty! I followed one or two recommendations I prebaked the crust for 10 min before adding the filling! and I used 3 8 inch pie plates....i did add a few extra eggs and some extra 1/2 and 1/2 and parsley due to the the third pie plate! I loved it! so did the family! Its a keeper and I will pass it on! I know a family with chickens.....they are always looking for a new way to use the eggs! LOL Thanks for a great new quiche

My family loves quiche, so we enjoy trying new recipes. Everyone loved this quiche! I did add a few more spices, and in one quiche, I omitted mushrooms & spinach & added green chiles. Good stuff! Thanks for sharing.

I absolutely love this quiche for a great summer dish with fresh fruit or a salad. I cannot eat onions, so I used onion powder instead. I also find that the cheese quantity is too large for 2 pies. It really is enough for 3. I also used 6 eggs mixed with 1 cup half and half. Delicious. Almost better  cooked, frozen and then reheated at a later date for a quick dinner.

I made this for a brunch when my kids were visiting.  Everyone loved it and asked for seconds as well as the recipe.  This was my first attempt at making quiche so I was very happy.  The only thing negative I could possibly say would be that it seemed to take a lot of prep work.  Otherwise, fantastic!!

By far the best quiche I've ever made! I use Honey Baked Ham and smoked bacon, fresh steamed spinach, Walla Walla sweet onion, and I even cheat sometimes  with store-bought Marie Calendar Pie shells... perfect for any holiday brunch--- I've made them for Christmas, New Year's and Easter. I usually make one with spinach and one without for the kids... but we always seen to finish the "with" first! Left out the mushrooms however-too many picky eaters in the family. I'm even planning on making these in the RV... if I'm organized to get all the prep done before vacation! This is a MUST TRY recipe--- thanks for sharing Clark

This is a really delicious recipe.  Like many quiches or pasta dishes, it tastes even better and is a firmer texture the next day.  I always "lighten up" recipes, so I will use Daisy LITE sour cream, nonfat 1/2+1/2, less shredded cheese, and factor in some egg whites and low-fat ricotta for subs. But for those who can eat like this and not worry 'bout cholesterol, I say, "Go for it!"

Made this quiche yesterday.  Used fresh baby spinach, as I had some and no frozen.  Also used Mrs. Dash, as we are trying not to use too much table salt.  Instructions were easy to follow.  I did increase cooking time by about 10 minutes as the quiche did not look set or done at 40 minutes.  I think this is a good base recipe and could be adapted if you choose to.  Would definitely try one of this cook's recipes again.

This was fantastic.  It was my first attempt at quiche and I'm glad this was the recipe I tried.  Entire family loved it so it is officially a permanent part of my recipe collection.  As good as any restaurant quiche I've had.  I didn't change anything except I only cooked the spinach halfway before adding it to the pie pan.  Also I found that if I poured the egg mixture VERY slowly it didn't overflow.

The BEST quiche I've ever had! And it was the first one I've ever made too. :) I brought it to a breakfast party and it was a real hit! People were even taking some of it home to enjoy for later.

I made this for Easter brunch this morning, and it received rave reviews by all! After reading the other reviews, I made 3 regular (not deep dish) 9" size pies out of this recipe.  There was plenty of filling or all 3 pies.  I followed the recipe exactly but used more bacon and left out the ham because we were having a whole ham for brunch as well.  I have never made quiche before and tried this one because it received such great reviews!  It was so delicous, that I think this will become a good 'ol standby in our house!  The best part is that I took 2 quiche to brunch and still have one left to eat another night this week for dinner!  Can't wait!

Perfect.  I made a couple of changes.  I'm not a fan of spinach, so went to frozen chopped broccoli.  I'm also not a fan of messing up several pans, so cooked the onion and mushroom in the bacon grease.  I'm so naughty, I know.   I also did Italian seasoning instead of the parsley, only because that is what I had on hand.  This is probably the best quiche recipe I've ever tried.  Easy, accessible ingredients, and  cook time was perfect.  This is a keeper in my book.

WRONG TIME IS GIVEN FOR THE COOKING TIME!!!  I wanted to make this to take to a brunch at a friend's house . . . .checked the top of the recipe where it says cook time of 10 minutes -- WRONG!!!!  It's a cook time of 40 MINUTES!!  It's closer to an hour or slightly more to make this dish.  It tasted good, but I guess I should have read the entire recipe rather than rely on what the top part said.

This was the first quiche I've ever made.  It was easy and came out perfect!  Two of my dinner guests do not like mushrooms or spinach... BOTH of them went back for seconds and took some home!  A big hit!  Thank you!

It tastes delicious but I especially like that it looks gorgeous. My guests didn't believe that I made them. I used low fat cheese (could only get about 10 oz of cheese into the two pies), no bacon, and soy creamer/2% milk in place of the half and half cream. I also didn't add any additional salt. I made one vegetarian and I think it did need the extra salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was fantastic, it wasn't too complicated and the filling was perfectly constructed.  This is by far the best quiche recipe I've ever carried out.  We had a lot of extra cheese that couldn't fit in the dish but the left-overs were fantastic!

Absolutley Delicious!  Unfortunately, I didnt have any onions or ham.  But other than that, followed the recipe and it was wonderful.  I cooked them on Christmas Eve and they heated just fine.  Will be making again!

Love it! I make this almost every year for holiday breakfasts.  I leave one out and freeze one to take to relatives.  FYI- I leave out the ham, uses fat free half and half, and use cholesteral free egg substitute for half of the eggs in the recipe.  And still...it is rich and delicious.  Thanks Clark!

It really is that good.  I made one and froze one....can't wait to eat it!  I did find the filling was a tad bit too much...will likely cut down on the mushrooms next time.

One word- delicious!  It is a bit labor intensive but is so worth it.  I cut back on the eggs as some had suggested but think I could have used the original amount and gotten more egg throughout.  Next time think I will poke some holes before adding the egg to help it seep down further.   I used broccoli as my husband does not like spinach and it was great.  Thanks!

12/23/10-  Had to add that this is now a Christmas tradition for us.  So great to heat up on Christmas morning and enjoy with our coffee as the kids open their gifts.  Thanks again!

This is the recipe that keeps me coming back for more. I'm about to make this quiche for at least the dozenth time and every time it is a huge success. Yes, I've had the pies overflow and yes, I've switched it up from time to time (omitting the ham, adding peppers or broccoli), but I always come back because this recipe is AWESOME. No quiche compares. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Do give it a try and enjoy.

Excellent, excellent quiche. I usually make a simple bacon and cheese quiche, but this is my new standby.  I will pre-bake the crust a little next time.   Thanks Clark!

Spectacular and easy.  Everyone goes for seconds.  It's a regular dish and for 2 of us or a crowd, I wouldn't dream of cutting this down to one quiche! I have used different meats/veggies for the filling, but I think the signature of this dish is the sour cream layer.  I use fresh chopped spinach and about half the cheese.  Brilliant, Clark, thank you!

This was outstanding! I substituted turkey bacon for the pork. I also omitted the ham and used tons and tons of cheddar cheese. My sister and I live together and she does not care for leftovers at all but when I made this the next day she came home from work and was looking for it for her dinner. I beat her to it and had it for breakfast! This is a keeper.

This quiche tastes fabulous! As suggested by other viewers, I pre-baked the pie shells to elliminate a soggy bottom. Instead of Parmesan cheese I subed Mozzarella. I also used 2tbls of dried minced onion instead of fresh onion. It does take much longer to prepare than stated in the recipe and I needed to bake it for 50 minutes, not 40. Overall, this quiche was VERY good and I can't wait to try it with variations of sausage and broccoli.

The only change I made was adding some fresh tomato to the meat/onion mixture.  I did overdo the salt, though - so suggest watching the double salting.  Will make it again!

I made this quiche for the first time for a brunch and was a little nervous to share it not having tried it first. It turned out beautifully and got excellent reviews! I decided to use broccoli instead of spinach. For the cheese I bought Trader Joe‚Äôs brand ‚ÄúQuattro Formaggio‚Äù( a blend of parmesan, asiago, fontaina and mild provolone) which I used 4 oz. of . I also used Trader Joe‚Äôs brand ‚ÄúLite 3 Cheese Bled‚Äù (mozzarella, monterey jack, and cheddar cheese) which I used 8 ounces of.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried.  I divided the recipe into two pie pans and did not have a problem with overflow. They cooked perfectly.  I warmed it up for dinner the same day and it re-heated in the microwave wonderfully. I will defiantly used this recipe again and share it with others. Thank you Clark :)

Wonderful.  Great Lake breakfast.  I make the two; freeze; pull out and put in frig day b/4 I want to serve it.  Put it out on the counter; everyone cuts their piece to their liking, microwaves it and eats it :)  All who have tried it love it.  Also, was great for a friend coming home from hospital - one for me and one for her √ú

My family loved this dish!  My toddlers love anything with eggs so I really couldn't go wrong here.  I didn't have spinach so I just left it out.  I only did one pie and next time will bake the pie crust first so the bottom is done.

Really good recipe! Made 2 deep dish quiches. I've made it many times & have added different ingredients to change it up with much success. Tastes great with some hash browns cubes too!

Good quiche but it has a lot going on-almost too much. I can't decide if I like the sour cream layer. It just sits on the bottom-maybe it would be better if it mixed in w/the other ingredients? Just not sure why it's there?! Anyway-I got 3 deep dish quiche-2 w/crust, 1 without-out of this recipe, following it to a "t".

SO GOOD!!  Made one of mine crustless when I ran out of pie crust -- turned out great!  I used milk instead of half and half. I used 4 eggs and 3/4 cup egg beaters just to lighten it a bit! Turned out perfectly!

Very delicious and lots o'meat!  Absolutely make 2 ... since it is a little labor intensive, you'll want to have an additional pie to serve or give.

I had never made quiche before but a friend asked me to bring one to her afternoon wedding reception. This recipe was awesome.  I made 2 and they were gone as soon as I put them out (there were 10 other quiches there).  Everyone was talking about it.  Thanks!

I've been making this recipe for years, always with great success.  For Easter this year I decided to make mini quiches out of phyllo dough in a muffin tray.  I halved the original recipe and it made 2 dozen "cupcake quiche" (as my 3 year old called them).  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes was perfect and as always - a success.  Thanks again for this great recipe Clark!

Excellent - I would have rated 4 but I used fresh sauteed spinach and chopped green onion and it pushed it over the top.  Will make often.

I made this for a family brunch and it was really good.  I made one with the crust and one without (for low carb option). I also didn't cook the spinach as other reviewers suggested.  It wasn't necessary since it gets baked.

Bravo!  I misplaced my grandmother's quiche recipe, so decided to try this one.  This will now be my go-to recipe.  Only change I made was to cut back on the cheese by about 4 oz.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to get all of the ingredients into the deep dish pie crust.

This was an easy and tasty recipe. I didn't have half n half so I used 1 cup heavy cream w/ 1/2 cup 1% milk. I didn't use the bacon. I used fresh spinach and cooked that with the onions/mushrooms/red peppers (I added diced red pepper). I would make this again!!

Awesome recipe!! I halved the recipe and only made one because it was just me eating it. I made a few minor adjustments . . . 1. Instead of the two kinds of shredded cheese I used just one (colby jack) and used about a cup. 2. Even with the help from the other suggestions, my filling spilled over while baking so make sure to cook it on a foil lined baking sheet.

I made a pretty good amount of modification to this recipe.  I have no idea if it would have turned out well if I had made it the way I was supposed to.  Being in a rush, I didn't realize that I needed deep dish pie pans and just used to the regular ones that I had.  These are the extent of my modifications: No mushrooms, no ham, a little less bacon, 3/4 cups half-and-half and 6 eggs.  It fit just fine into the regular pie pans, and I think that a pound of meat is awfully excessive!  I went with a little less than a half pound of bacon, and it was MORE than plenty.  Frozen spinach tasted dandy to me, and usually I'm the kind that likes frozen nothing.  Also, be warned that if you're not an onion fan, or have them in the family, that this will be overpowering.  I love onions, so I was cool with it, but you may want to cut down.  The ratio of cheese to egg to meat to spinach that I had was very much to my liking with my mods; I never follow anything to the recipe anyway.  My extended family liked it so much that we fought over who got to keep the second one :]

This recipes was amazing!  I used all bacon for the meat, and broccoli instead of spinach.  The broccoli filling was so good, I couldn't stop myself from stealing bites as I prepared the rest of the pie ingredients.  The only changes I will make next time relate to the filling.  It came out rather layered - broccoli on the bottom, bacon, then egg and cheese on top.  Next time I will mix together everything except the egg mixture, put that into the pie pan then pour the egg mixture on top.  Otherwise, an amazing recipe.

Great basic recipe, very versatile. We have used everything from bacon and spinach to crawfish tails.  Rather than use the pie crusts I use the pre-made refrigerated dough you just roll out and press it into a springform pan.  Pre-bake dough for five minutes.  Much tastier than the pie crust, and solves overspill problem.

Wow this was excellent! My picky kids and husband ate it all up with many compliments. The only change I made was I used brocoli because I did not have spinach and I also did not have any bacon but did use ham. YUMMY!! Thank you.

I Eliminated the Ham, and used Turkey Bacon. I substituted Broccoli for the Spinach, and also added red and green pepper. I used Colby Jack cheese, because it was all I found already shredded. I used Fat Free Cheddar and light Sour Cream to indulge healthier eating habits. The second time I made it, I also used Fresh Parsley, which gave it an even better taste, if that was at all possible. THANK YOU for this amazing Christmas hit, as well as MOMS Club Spectacular!

Wonderful!!! However what I did for my crust was used my pampered chef deep dish round stoneware and used two regular pie crusts and fit it in to make my own. Worked wonderful :) For the cheese I used already shredded packs from the store there is a kraft one that has cheddar, monterey and colby all in one..I used that, also used the kraft parmesan that is a shredded pack as well.

This was excellent!  I only used ham since we had a lot of leftover ham, and I cut the recipe in half.  It perfectly filled a 9" deep dish pie pan.

This is a wonderful recipe!!!! I've already made it twice and froze the 2nd quiche for enjoyment later. Warning:not all deep dish pie crusts are made the same. Make sure you buy a deep deep crust!!

I had used the sweet small pie crusts which was a contrast to the savoury quiche.  Need the plain pie crusts to ensure it went better with the quiche.

This is an excellent quiche!  The only thing I changed was I used about half the amount of sour cream called for simply because it's all I had on hand.  It still turned out excellent.  I think I will try to make this "crustless" next time to cut down on carbs though.

Pretty good.  I halved the recipe to make just one quiche, and I left out the bacon completely.  I also used Tillamook Fat Free Sour Cream (LOVE that stuff), and fat free half and half.  The whole family enjoyed it.

This has become known as the Christmas Quiche in my home. I finally invested in 2 Emile Henry deep dish 9" ceramic pie dishes from Wilson Sonoma and they were the perfect size! Nothing boiled over and I didn't need a cookie sheet underneath. I made this the day before, so I wouldn't have to prep it Christmas morning. After baking, I let it set on the counter for about an hour to cool and then popped in fridge and reheated the next morning. Perfect consistency!  I had to cook about 45-50 min. in ceramic dish vs. aluminum foil/glass pan. I stopped baking once it got to 180F internally. (Should be between 165-185F)  I still used the frozen pre-made 9" deep dish pie crusts and when they are less frozen but not thawed, they pop out easily and then I pressed and formed to the ceramic dishes.  It made a much more beautiful presentation than aluminum!!!   I did NOT alter any of the ingredients, other than using fat free half-and-half and light sour cream.  For the same ceramic pie dishes that I found that hold all the ingredients visit William Sonoma or the condensed website: http://tinyurl.com/mran2uk

This is by far the best recipe for quiche.  It is DELICIOUS!!.  My hat goes off to Clark for this one.  He must be quite handy in the kitchen too, because his 15 min. prep time took me 1-1/2 hours.  LOL  BUT, it was worth every minute.  

Since I carry this to personal gatherings, I do use my own quiche pie pans and a ready made crust I roll out and form in the dish, but I would change nothing else.  I have received the nicest and sweetest compliments every time I serve this dish.  

Thank you Clark for this AWESOME recipe and sharing such a delicious yummy food with the rest of us!!

I made this crustless, and I left out the mushrooms because hubby doesn't like them, but otherwise it was as listed and it was excellent.  My 3 year-old asked for it for days.

Great recipe and easy to follow. We couldn't stop eating it...breakfast, lunch, dinner. I made these very minor changes: left out the ham, used about 2/3 of each of the cheeses to cut out  a few of the calories, and used the precooked thick cut bacon that you microwave. It was perfect! Thanks for a sharing a wonderful recipe!

Very good and easy. I had never made a quiche before so I was nervous at first, but it turned out really well. I took it to a brunch at my church and it was all gone by the end. I use sausage instead of ham and that worked really well too.

We love this recipe!  It's so tasty!  On the deep dish note, I did buy some deep dish frozen pie crusts and it overflowed.  This time I'm using the refrigerated pie crusts and pressing them into my deep dish Pampered Chef pie pans.  I think they will hold it just fine.

This recipe was really good, however, it took me a reall long time to prep--do not know if it was the recipe or my toddler--but it turned out great.  I think I will do either bacon or ham and not both.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Thank  you Clark for a great recipe. I've been experimenting with Quiches for a while now and this is the best so far. I made a few minor changes. I omitted the bacon and added more ham instead, and I used fat-free half and half and milk insead of the whipping cream. It turned out great!

Wonderful!  Except for using fresh spinach instead of frozen, I didn't change a thing.  I guess my pie dishes were just the right depth, because they filled exactly right.  I may try this with phyllo next time, just out of curiosity, but that would be a purely experimental change.  Incredible quiche, and it was my first!!

Worst measurements for this meal. Way too much sour cream and spinach mixture, way too much cheese, and way too many eggs and cream. I only used 1/2 of the egg mixture for 2 deep dish 9" crusts. Wasteful. And more egg mixture poured out while cooking cause there was no room with all the other ingrediants. Will never make again.

This was delicious. I used half the amount of cheese the recipe called for, and it still seemed decadent. I can't imagine having put all of that cheese in there, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. I also omitted the ham and used 1 pound of bacon. I will definitely make this again. With half the cheese, I didn't have any "overflow" using two regular 9" pie pans.

This was okay to me, I've had/made many other quiches and egg bakes that are much better.  Not much flavor.  I did make it crustless, but made everything else as called for.

Very good.  The receipe needs to be updated, though with correct information:  I would say prep time is 35 minutes and cook time is an additional 40 minutes.  I would suggest making "holes" in the cheese before pouring the eggs over . . . pour slowly!  Othewise, you will have a huge amount of spillover and lose several eggs.  For more flavor, yes, green peppers.  Also, I would use low-fat everything for a bit of ease around the waistline!  

Try using broccoli if you don't appreciate spinach!

I loved how this recipe makes 2!  I used low fat subst. and turned out well.  I did have to cook it for 15 extra minutes to get the right consistency.  Next time will leave out the shrooms.

Great texture and flavors. It was easy to alter to fit what I had on hand. I prebaked the crust as suggested for 10 minutes. I used fresh spinach instaed of frozen by folding it into the onions that I sauted in some of the leftover bacon grease. I omitted the mushrooms because I'm not a huge fan. I substitued Gruyere for the parm and milk for the cream because that is what I had onhand. I also mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering them and then poured them into my large castiron for one deep dish quiche. It took about 1 hour and 15 minuted to really set. Left overs were great the next morning. On a side note: many people have stated that it didn't need bacon or to leave it out. In my house, it is sacrilegious and just plain wrong to leave bacon out. The more bacon the happier I am. That is if the bacon makes it into the quiche before it is all eaten away.

Yummy! This was realy good. My boyfriend and I ate almost a whole pie. I followed the recipes almost exactly, but I don't like mushroos, so I left those out. I also did not have any olive oil, so I just used veg oil. I made quiche once before and I made the mistake of using some of the bacon grease to cook the onlions and it ended up turning the whole pie brown.
I left it in the oven for about 40 minutes and then turned it to broil for a few more minutes.
I am freezing the other pie, so I will let you know how it freezes.
I will definately make this again, but with very little or no additional salt.
Thanks for the recipe!

Nice rich flavor. Definitely a quiche I'll make again. I mixed the ingredients per Lost Texan's review because my husband's not a spinach lover. I poured the whisked eggs (6 large), parsley, and half-and-half over the rest of ingredients that I had combined instead of layering. I also threw the onions and spinach in without precooking. To save a little more time, I‚Äôll use real bacon bits next time. Even though I omitted the ham and mushrooms and reduced the number of eggs, I had a bit too much filling for my store-brand 9-inch deep-dish crusts.

I have served this twice now (once w/ egg whites only and once with whole eggs). Both were wonderful, but the whole eggs seemed to be the best. I introduced all of my guests to your recipe, Clark! They all loved it! :-)

This recipe  is excellent, i have a similar one i have been using from Southern Living. It is equally as good. i followed the directions to the ingredients as written. But i did not layer the items in the pie pans. i mixed all the ingredients together and poured them into the pan. Came out just fine. Thank you for sharing.

No other quiche recipe touches this. Oscar Mayer turkey bacon does the trick if you're staying away from pork products.

Excellent Quiche!!  I used deep dish crusts and used broccoli instead of spinach and used ham only (just my preference) this recipe is definitely a keeper!! Thanks!!!  Edit:  Now I've made this dish several times....my favorite variation is adding chopped green chile to one of the quiches...Yum!!

THIS IS THE BEST QUICHE EVER!!  I made a couple minor changes.  I doubled the bacon and left out the ham. I also used fresh spinach and reduced fat sour cream.  I chopped the mushrooms very fine b/c my friend doesn't like them, but thought she could deal with them if she couldn't see them.  She said it was the best quiche she's ever had too!  I had no issues with the liquid being too much for the pies.  Don't hesitate to make this!!!!

I didn't have any ham, so I doubled the mushrooms and bacon and the flavor was great.  I wasn't too crazy about the layering, so I think next time I will just mix everything together and pour it in the crust.

Oh, my goodness!  This is so good!  I left out the spinach and the mushrooms, since I wanted a "no veggie" quiche and a separate "veggie" quiche for a party.  This recipe, even without the spinach and mushrooms, is so rich and delicious.  I've been making quiche for years, but never added sour cream.  I think the sour cream definitely makes this quiche special.

very good, I ate mine for two weeks, I sliced it up and froze the individual portions!  Worked like a charm.

Next time I will reduce the spinach I put it though, a little too strong for my taste.

This recipe is wonderful. We have a chicken farm and always have an abundance of eggs!  So I use this recipe to make a quiche for everyone I know!  I use this as a basic recipe give and take the ingredients I have on hand.  I have ha to pass this recipe on a bunch of times!

This was really good! It was my first attempt at a quiche and it turned out really well.  I took it to a brunch and it was gobbled up!  I did NOT use the entire egg mix, bacon mix (which I used bacon, sausage, onion, mushrooms, green and red peppers), cheese mix or the spinach and sour cream mix. I did use two deep dish pie shells, but they were still full to the brim.

Either way, this was really good and will definitely make again.

very good recipe,but one problem,i bought 2 frozen 9'inch.deep pie crust.still i have lots of liquid left,i lost about 3 eggs. and they weren't nearly big enough. when I pured the egg mixture over the crust, it spilled everywhere.in my sink,floor. I would still highly reccommend this recipe, next time i would make my own crusts and glass deep dish.thank you for the recipe my daughter loves it.

Never had quiche before, so I was naturally a bit nervous. However, this was delicious. Like other reviewers, I simply didnt have enough room in each pie crust to use all the cheese, so I threw alot out. 
It was still VERY good. The ham and bacon was wonderful, and the sour cream a nice touch. Excellent recipe. Try it!

Wonderful recipe!  I used sausage instead of ham, and it was delicious.  All I had was one deep dish pie dish and then a shallow one.  I used both and the deep dish took about 45 minutes longer to cook.  Great, great, great!!

The flavor was very good.  I left out the ham and it was still flavorful.  I will bake the pie shell a little before putting in the spinach mixture.

Oh, Clarke!  Best quiche I have ever had!  I used frozen broccoli, uncooked but de-thawed, 1/4 bag of fresh spinach, and did not sautee the mushrooms, just added them freshly sliced.  Yummy.  Excuse me, I need to go get a second slice!

LOVE IT!  As many others did, I pre-baked crusts 6 min. and added 10 minutes to final bake time.  I also added red and green bell pepper to the onion/mushroom saute.  Then, I split the saute mix in half, added bacon to one, and diced tomatoes to the other.  This way I pleased vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks!

This is a great quiche! I made it exactly as instructed, but substituted ground beef for ham and added red pepper. Very very good!

I halved this recipe for 1 quiche and didn't have ham so just used bacon.  I also doubled the amount of mushrooms and onions and used more spinach and fat free sour cream.  Recipe still turned out really well.  Baked it with Best Ever Pie Crust from this site and it turned out excellent.  Will try with only ham next time to try and cut down on the fat content.  A family favorite!

Thank you for the recipe!

I just put these in the oven and while I haven't tasted yet, they look delicious.  I wanted to say that if you use the small frozen pie crusts, 2 won't hold all the filling.  I used 2 refridgerated crusts and my ceramic pie plates and it made 2 beautiful looking quiches.

This was simply amazing. I've made it 2 times now with spectacular results. The first time I mistakenly omitted the bacon, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. I served it one time with Pan Fried Asparagus (also on this site), and the second time with just a simple garden salad. My foodie mom, afraid-to-try-new-things husband, and picky 5-year-old all loved it as much as I did. Give it a try. You'll be glad you did. It's fabulous! 5 stars.

Super recipe!  We used a glass pie plate and did not pre cook crust and it was perfect.  Used green onions and omitted ham. Came out perfect!

This turned out really well and it was so simple to throw together.  I used deep dish pie crusts and the measurements were right on.  The only thing I might do differently is to add some chopped tomato next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

OverFILL!! The flavor of this quiche is wonderful but I followed the instructions exactly and it was STILL too much for even TWO deep dish pie crusts. You could probably split this recipe between THREE deep dish crusts! There were A LOT of left overs!! Unfortunately I didn't have a third crust and with no time left, I ended up saving the mixture in a plastic container:(

For a vegetarian version of this recipe I left out the bacon and ham and found it a bit bland. However, everyone loved it anyway. Next time I will probably add a little more red pepper to give it an extra kick.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, do not change anything!! Hands down, the best quiche I have ever had. I made this for my husband's co-workers and they ask me to make it again EVERY time I see them. :) My family and I are definitely glad the recipe makes two pans; we simply cannot get enough!

This was wonderful!  I precooked the crust like someone suggested about 5 minutes.  The prep time was longer than it states, but worth it.  I also had to cook it a little longer than 40 minutes because it was still runny.  But, when it was done, it was delicious.

I omitted the ham and the mushrooms and used mozzerella, swiss and parmesan cheeses.  After reading the previous reviews I baked my frozen crusts for 5 minutes before adding the yummy stuff, including Omega3 rich eggs.  Nice way to get a green leafy veggie in for the day.
Great recipe for a midweek dinner!

Wow - what a great quiche!!  I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit.  Guests that "don't like quiche" loved this dish.  It was easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  (I took other reviewers advise and reduced to 6 eggs - worked great.)

This recipe is terrific and got five stars from my guests.  I have made several times and added or left out some ingredients with still amazing results.  The prep time listed is not enough if you make all the items from scratch which I do.  Also use a deep dish pie plate for best results..I prebake by pie crust for 7-8 min. before I add the spinach,cheese and egg mix.

this was the 1st time i have made quiche and i took the risk of making it for a bridal luncheon.  i ommitted the spinach in one quiche and just followed the reciped for the remainder of the ingredients.  D-LISH.  i used pepperjack cheese instead of monterey jack to give it a kick and all i had on hand was heavy whipping cream instead of half and half.  it was awesome.  i had so many compliments, some guests said they didn't really like quiche, but loved this recipe.  will definitely make this again and again and again.

I followed this recipe and didn't change a thing. I get a chuckle when people don't follow the recipe, yet rate it according to their changes. This is an awesome quiche! I made 2 for a potluck get-together...not a crumb left!

This was my first quiche and it turned out very good! I made it for my inlaws when they last came to visit, and they loved it.  My husband, who didn't want me to make it because he didn't think he'd like it,loved it and wanted it for dinner the next day. I omitted the mushrooms, and used about half the cheese. Like others, I just used a shredded cheese blend (like cheddar jack.)  The cooking time was a little longer than stated, but that could be my oven. I will definitely make this again!

This was a great quiche!  It took a bit to prepare and was well worth it. I froze the extra pie splitting it up into smaller pieces for the work week.

This was wonderful. I followed the directions except I used fresh spinach instead of the frozen.  The prep time was definitely off, it took me almost an hour to chop everything and then cook the bacon and sautee the veggies.  But it was so worth it!

I made this for mothers day and both moms loved it.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the amount of cheese.  I also made another one that had no cheese or sour cream in it and my husband (who doesn't like cheese) LOVED it.  Will definately make again.

This is an excellent quiche recipe.  When it says it makes two 9-inch pies that is no exaggeration.  My pie plates were filled to the top.  I love spinach, but wasn't sure how this would be received by some of my picky eaters...I guess the fact that there was not one bite left confirms that this recipe is a winner!  I had to increase the baking time by about 15 minutes and keep an eye that the crust didn't burn but other than that...Bon Appetit!!!

This was excellent! I browsed many of the quiche recipes and this was the one I decided on making.  I read most of the reviews but I didn't really modify much. I cut down the cheese just a bit (5-6 ozs instead of 8)and baked the pieshells about 5 minutes first, but other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great.  I wasn't sure my husband would even try it, but he ended up eating 2 servings.  I will keep this one in my recipe stash and make it again!!

POSITIVE:  This has a "world-class" quiche flavor.  NOT-SO-POSITIVE: This recipe makes a TON of filling.  I may have used extra large eggs or perhaps was too generous with the cheese.  I filled one deep dish pan to the brim (it overflowed during baking) and, with the addition of another couple of eggs and a bit of cheese, filled ANOTHER deep dish pan.  Baking time proved to be a bit too short, as the filling was not quite set inside.

This is the best quiche I have tried so far! I have made Quiche Lorraine and mushroom & spinach quiches before, but this one is the perfect combination of those two. So flavourful. I made my own crust, and skipped a step by sauteing the mushrooms, onions and some fresh gralic with the bacon. We are having this for lunch all week and I plan to make another one for a potluck this weekend. Thanks so much!

I've made this recipe a few times.  I always use canned spinach because it's easier to squeeze out the water and less messy.  This time I left out the ham, added 2 extra eggs, doubled the sour cream (fat free), used fat free milk, and put 3 slices of swiss cheese on each crust.  I always add 1/2 teaspoon of thyme.  Yum!

i guess the pie dishes i bought weren't big enough because i didnt have enough room for all the filling. I ended up using only 6 eggs instead of 8 and 1 cup of half and half, and it still overflowed!! Good thing i lined the cookie sheet i had the pies on. 

The quiche came out so delicious. It was my first time making quiche, and my whole family enjoyed it. My boyfriend ate a quarter of the quiche for dinner!! Will definitly be making this again, and will try to find a better fitting store bought pie. Thanks for a great recipe!

I read through the reviews of this recipe and took the suggestions to heart as I set about to make Clark's Quiche. I chose to only use bacon, but other than that, I followed Clark's directions exactly. I received rave reviews this morning from 12 friends who came for brunch. This was my first try at making a quiche and I'm definitely going to be making it often.

Delicious quiche!  Needs a little more zing, so next time I think I will add some cayenne.  I didn't use the spinach as the family doesn't like spinach.

We REALLY enjoyed this recipe - I did use mushroom soup vs potato and only ham - it was quite tasty!

Very good and easy to modify based on what you have on hand.  The sour cream - spinach mixture is to die for.  Adding some feta cheese to it makes it event better.  I make this quiche often in various forms, and it always comes out well.

This recipe IS excellent.  Made it for family and friends both Thanksgiving and Christmas mornings.  Everyone loved it and went back for seconds and thirds and for leftovers the next day.  The only modification I made was using crunchy hashbrowns as the crust.  Would have it everyday if it wasn't for the cholesterol.

AWESOME!  I'm not a big Quiche person, but I've been looking for a recipe for my Husband.  He likes me to make it on Christmas morning.  After serveral years, I found a a quiche recipe I actually like!  I cooked the day before and reheated in the oven.  Turned out perfect!  My company kept raving.

5 PLUS 10 more stars..absolutely fantastic!!!  I made this ahead of time for my husbands breakfast, but he ate the whole thing for dinner when he walked in!!  
I scaled it down to about 6 servings, and used only bacon, shredded 1/2 a potato, mushrooms, onion, mozzerella.  sauteed it all together, then folded it into the eggs, i used a ready made pastry crust, baked it in a small shallow quiche dish..
(im allergic to eggs, so boo hooo..i didnt even get to try this!!)PERFECT! and easy

Yum!!  Extremely Decadent!  I will definately do this again.  I did however make some changes.  I skipped Step 1...ham & bacon was just too much meat for me.  In Step 2, I added garlic & a minced hot pepper to the onion saute & omitted the mushrooms.  In Step 3, I also omitted the spinach, but kept the sour cream layer.  I also made this without a crust...but otherwise, I followed everything else as defined in the recipe.  A keeper!

Very good.  I did not use bacon, but it really didn't need it anyway.  I read some of the other reviews, but I didn't have any of the same problems.  Highly recommended!

Who says real men don't eat quiche?  Obviously Chuck knew that this recipe would be a hit...my guys gobbled it up without breathing.  Thanks Chuck..this is a definite favourite.

Absolutely the BEST quiche I've ever had!  I did add a little garlic powder and onion powder to the bacon mixture which added really good flavor!  I had a small slice for dinner and my husband polished off the rest of it between dinner and breakfast.  He wants to know when he can take the 2nd one out of the freezer!  Should have heeded others advice though, this recipe makes WAY too much filling for only 2 deep dish pie crusts - could easily have filled 3 or 4!  Not the most health conscious dish (I know it could be made with fat-free cheeses and sour cream and turkey bacon or something, but would lose a lot of it's charm!), but I will make it every couple of months or when company comes - GREAT recipe!

I'm not sure why anyone would have a problem with this quiche (runny??).  I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic.  So-o-o good!  Thank you, Clark.  This is definately a 'cut above'.

I made two of these the night before and they tested excellent the next day.  It did take longer than 15 minutes prep time though.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very good.  I eye-balled the ingredients when I was making it, and had just enough to fill the two pie crusts.  I used lite sour cream and fat free half & half.  This is just right for breakfast.  Thanks Clark!
