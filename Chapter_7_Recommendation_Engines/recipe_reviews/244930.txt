With my first kiddo on the way, I was looking for some easy make-ahead meals to keep me eating healthy when I'm too tired to want to cook. These are a wonderful time-saver in the morning. I made them with regular eggs, diced ham, red peppers, habenero shredded cheese, and green onions.  In the time it takes to toast an English muffin, I've got a great breakfast!!! Love it! 
I tried to make them in muffin liners for my first batch to save on clean-up time - don't!!! They are very difficult to peel out of the papers.

A very nice breakfast. The fact that this recipe doesn't call for saut√©ing the veggies first not only makes it healthier but it also saves time and dishwashing. It also gives the veggies a nice crunch. I used fresh spinach. I added some onion and a fresh hot pepper. Thank you for the recipe.
