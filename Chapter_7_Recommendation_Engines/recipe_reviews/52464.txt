I'm in love! First off, I usually stink at making pork chops. This is the first recipe I've found where the chops didn't turn out like dry shoe leather. In this recipe they are as moist as meat can be. The sauce is so flavorful. The basil makes this dish (I substituted about 2 tsp dry basil). The recipe was simple to make. You could probably throw in an extra chop or two since it makes ample sauce. I wouldn't suggest making any other substitutions, as this recipe is perfect as-is (except, I'm sure it would also be great with chicken).

Very tasty dish.  I made it with 2 pork chops and 2 chicken breasts in the same pan and they all turned out great!  Didn't need full hour of simmering to cook through, but neither meat toughened while I left it on the stove to stay warm.

Yumm....My husband loved this dish.  I've made it twice this week.  The combination of onion, garlic, basil, mushrooms and tomatoes really perk up plain old pork chops. It tastes great even without sour cream.  I've used thick cut pork chops  and pork cutlets and they both turned out wonderful.  If you use pork cutlets, reduce your cooking time in half.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Lisa Dawn

The pork turned out tasty and tender.  The only thing I did different is double the garlic.  This is a keeper!  DEEELISH!

I thought this was Ok.  My family ate it but weren't overly impressed.  I thought it was rather bland.  If I were to make it again, I would eliminate the milk as I found the sauce a little runny, and I would also boost the seasonings a little.

pork chops were good but the rest was just blah. Didn't hate it, but didn't like it enough to make it again.

These turned out moist and tender but were otherwise bland and lacking depth.  We ate them but I don't think I will bother with them again.

This is excellent.  I actually made it exactly as is, and it is very good.  The sauce is a little thin, so I would use whole milk maybe (I used fat free).  I also removed the pork chops and added the sour cream to the sauce and it thickened up a little bit.  Excellent!

Oh my gosh...fabulous! Only change I made was to use more soup for extra gravy but used cream of mushroom and cream of celery instead of chicken based. The fresh tomato, especially since they're in season, added just the right texture. And the basil was the perfect seasoning. I will make these again and again. Thanks for the new twist on chops!

I feel awful that I'm in the minority here, maybe I did something wrong, I was quite surprised that it didn't have more flavor than it did.  Although my pork chops were nice and tender, I wasn't really impressed with the sauce.  It may have been the cream of chicken, maybe the brand I used, I'm just not sure, I followed the recipe to a 'T' and thought I'd love it.  My husband enjoyed it, but he will generally eat anything.  :)  Sorry that I'm in the minority!  Maybe I'll try it again and see what happens.

We really like this a lot! I used a thinner cut pork chop and halved the cooking time, I need to reduce it even more. But regardless, it was very tasty! I used white wine instead of milk,mushroom soup with roasted garlic, put the sour cream on the meat, that was really good, and put the sauce on pasta. We put parmesan cheese on the pasta. It was all really good! A keeper for us!

This smells amazing in the kitchen! I found that the skillet I used was not large enough to brown the chops so I browned them in batches in the skillet, transferring them over to a stock pot that I kept on a low temp. When the chops were all done, I mixed the basil, tomatoes, etc into the "left-over stuff" in the skillet where I had cooked the chops. This made a great sauce ( I also sub'd cream of mush. ) I poured this over the chops in the stock pan and followed the directions from there. MMM mmm

I used 2 teaspoons of dried basil instead of fresh and skipped the sour cream and the tomato because my boyfriend is not a fan of either. They turned out great.

This was great!  The only thing I did differently, on a whim, was to add a little white wine to the sauce.  Will definitely be making this one again!

We didn't care for the cream of chicken flavor - we would have prefered mushroom.  I used half a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one.  Served over pasta - would have been OK over rice too.

I really enjoyed this receipe, very tasty and it was soo nice to be able to do something different with pork chops.  I changed it up a bit and added the sour cream directly to the sauce instead of putting it on top.  Will definitely have this again.

I liked this. I had Omaha Steaks pork chops on hand, so I used those. They are 4 oz each, so I think they were way too small, and turned out a little tough. However, the flavor of the sauce was really good, even though I used dried basil. There was a lot of sauce leftover, and it made a delicious gravy. I think this would be a really great recipe with chicken, and I will try it that way next time!

What a great tasting and easy recipe.  I seasoned the chops with Morton's Nature's Seasonings (MSG free) and seared them in canola oil. Increased the garlic to 5 large cloves used mushroom soup, and omitted the  tomatoes b/c I didn't have any.  Served over brown rice - my family loved it.  Next time I will try it with pasta.  I almost skipped the sour cream b/c I don't really like it in sauces but I'm sure glad I didn't - the small amount called for is just right.

I don't know what others say about bland. This recipe had so much flavor. My husband and I loved it!! I did increase the recipe by two porkchops totalling 6, used an extra can of cream of chicken and doubled the milk. I also used a can of cherry tomatoes in basil, drained then and cut them in half instead of a fresh tomato. This is probably why it had more flavor. I'm glad I didn't have the fresh tomato. I think it would have made it less tasty.

Excellent, moist pork chops.  I didn't change a thing but take out the tomato, which I don't care for.

These were fantastic!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I didn't have mushrooms but everything else was followed just as the recipe calls for.  I'm making them again this week.  Thanks for the great pork chop recipe!

This is great!!  Even the kids ate it.  I used canned tomatoes, drained and dried basil.  I used thin pork chops and it still took almost a hour for the chops to get tender and the mushrooms to cook.  Served it over rice, Very good!  I've made it twice and will make it again!

This is just simply awesome.  My girlfriend and I have a few "keepers" that we tuck away for when company comes, and this is definitely one of them.  We have a herb garden, and used a lot of fresh basil and the smell of this cooking is so wonderful.

It's so easy, and is a great thing to prepare while guests are arriving, and while it's cooking you can entertain and have a few drinks with guests while the delicious meal simmers and bubbles, and makes the kitchen smell wonderful, and the guests' mouths water.

This recipe was ok, but didn't turn out as delicious as I thought it would.  Like another reviewer said, the sauce wasn't really anything that special.  It did get all get eaten though, even as leftovers, so it wasn't too bad.

I have to agree with Melissa on this one - I really thought it would have more flavor.  It wasn't bad, just not as great as I expected it to be based on the ingredients.  Probably not a repeat recipe, but thanks for the post anyways!

This recipe is great! I made my own cream of chicken soup mix because I have celiac but i wouldn't change anything else! I used a pork tenderloin cut into pieces since that's what i had at the time and the meat was very tender. Makes the house smell wonderful!

My Fiance gave this a five star, & he's very picky!!!!  The sauce was alittle runny, but I thickened it up a bit with flour, next time I will use less milk.  I did not add mushrooms (because fiance doesn't like them) & I had not basil on hand so I used other herb mixtures instead but it was still very, very delicious.  I couldn't imagine the deliciousness with basil!!!!  The meat was perfect, not dry like usual for me,lol!!!  Will definitely save this & make again!!!

I am DELIGHTED with this recipe -- it's the first time my hubby has LOVED my pork chops and believe me -- I have tried a ton of recipes. Used canned instead of fresh mushrooms, heavy cream instead of milk, and cream of broccoli instead of cream of chicken soup. I only used two pork chops but kept the same amount of sauce and it was so delicious, it made an excellent gravy over the mashed potatoes I made. As another reviewer stated, I would definitely try this with chicken! Thank you so much for this recipe - I no longer feel like a pork chop failure.

This was good.  We made our's with a side of brown rice.  We actually liked the sauce over the rice better than with the pork chop.

I sautéed the onion and garlic in olive oil then added the pork chops to brown. After they browned, I added 1/2 cup white wine and let it reduce. I used cream of mushroom instead, put the sour cream in with the soup, and skipped the milk. Used extra sauce to mix with egg noodles. Next time will simmer for 20 minutes only each side.  Thank you for sharing.

When I made this recipe I used cream of mushroom soup because using cream of chicken soup just didn't make sense to me.  I also used tarragon instead of basil only because I like the flavor better.  
I left out the chopped tomatoes simply due to my personal preference,  I don't like tomatoes with my meat and after reading other reviews it's easy to guess this is the reason why the sauce is to thin.  
The only other substitution I made was to use half and half in place of milk as that is what I had on hand and it makes a much richer sauce.
The dinner was flavorful and absolutely delicious.   My husband saved all of the extra sauce so he could put it on his next hamburger patty he cooks.

This is fantastic the way it is. I serve it with the pork chop on the plate and garlic redskin mashed potatoes. I use the sauce over the potatoes. I love the unique flavors the soup, basil,  mushroom, tomatoes and sour cream become. This is a recipe I have made over again and again for years.

I loved the sauce but didn't care for the pork chops in it.  Would be fantastic with chicken.  Ideally I would like to make my own cream soup but was short on time.  We ended up adding sriracha to the pork chops separately to make those edible.  Served over egg noodles.

These were good. It was kind of hard to cook everything in the same pan as the chops, but in the end everything mixed well.

This was yummy. Not exceptional, but tasted like a standard american dinner that my mom would have made. I'll make it again just because it was so easy!
