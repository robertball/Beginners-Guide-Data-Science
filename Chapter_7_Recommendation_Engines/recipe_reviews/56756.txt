Absolutely delicious.  I've made many biscotti and this by far is one of the best recipies.  Granted - it's definitely "NOT" low fat or low calorie but that's what makes this cookie so scrumptious.  Splurge and try this.  You'll love it. I only had walnuts and regular chocolate chips and it still turned out wonderfully.

Very, very good!  Definetly use the liquer, it makes all the difference in the taste!  Dipped my biscottis in dark chocolate and drizzled with white.  Tip: Use a ruler to help shape the biscotti: use the flat side of a normal 12 inch ruler and "scrape" the biscotti into shape on a flat (preferably cold) countertop.  This way you can tell just how thick and how flat the biscotti is; if that made any sense.

Great recipe!! To make them not so soft, after I cut up the logs into pieces, I baked them a little while longer on each side. They turned out perfect.

These are delicious and simple to make. The one problem I had was the biscotti being undercooked. I had to cook them longer (on parchment) and the bottoms browned. Maybe next time I will slice them thinner, they are close to 3/4" thick. I do love them though!

These biscotti are so delicious.  The dough was sticky.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and it was easier to work with.

A very nice recipe.  My husband told me I could put Starbuck's out of business single handedly!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I found I preferred them baked a little more than the 8 mins for the second time.  I love that it makes so much! Now I don't have to make a second batch, as I am giving them away as gifts. I had a little trouble with them when the first baked logs came out of the oven as I tried to tranfer them to a cooling rack off of the pan they got some slight cracks so I had to be VERY gentle with them when cutting and baking for the second time.  They're very delicate at that stage but not so much when they are completed and cooled.

Everybody loves these!  I'm still enjoying them; it makes a good-sized batch, and I even gave away a couple medium-sized plastic containers worth.  The amaretto is definitely worth the expense (I usually don't buy it).  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and ended up adding about a 1/2 cup extra all-purpose b/c the dough was too sticky to form into logs.  The extra flour helped.

Awesome recipe! Easy to follow, came out PERFECT first try.  I followed it to the letter. I made 2 batches. One as written, the other I dipped 1/2 the biscotti in melted chocolate for variety. A HUGE success with my husband, children and girlfriends (made for afternoon tea with my the ladies:-) All asked for recipe. A KEEPER. Thanks!

I get rave reviews with this cookie!  Just whipped up two batches for my Christmas cookie plates! This is a sticky dough to shape.  I increased the flour by 1/4c. but still was sticky.  I will deal with the stickiness b/c I don't want a dry cookie.  I also prefer to bake these longer than 8 minutes.  I eye them till slightly toasted, approx. 12 mins., take out of oven, flip and bake another 12.  I like a crunchy biscotti and so do my cookie fans.  Thanks for the recipe, its a hit!

After trying another biscotti recipe at Christmastime I decided to try this one - and this one is far better! I think this one also works well as a basic recipe to make your own variations and add your own mix-ins. The dough is nice and thick and bakes perfectly making it easy to slice. Texture is nice and not too crunchy. The amaretto really does add a nice flavor too; I even added some to a chocolate biscotti recipe as well. This is definitely a keeper!

These were the best of the best that I made for Christmas presents. Everyone has absolutely loved these. The first batch turned out smaller than I wanted because they did not spread out as much, so I just made the wider the next batch. Dipped them white chocolate and rolled in macadamia nuts.

This was really good. I'm surprised that the biscotti doesn't have to sit around to dry--definitely made it easier to make if you're a "I want it and I want it now" kind of person. I suggest making the logs taller so that, once you flip the biscotti on its side, it/they can have a greater surface area to rest on; mine had a hard time standing on its own because it was a bit thin. Also, I added more flour b/c the dough was kind of "goopy" without it. But the taste was great. It looks harder than it is ;)

This is a wonderful Biscotti recipe.  Definately softer than your traditional recipes.  I made this for my ladies gourmet group and everyone commented how good they were.  They all especially liked that they were not hard.  It is an expensive recipe, but worth it for a special occassion.  Very easy to make.  Will definately make again.

White Chocolate is my favorite flavor, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I used almonds in place of the macadamia nuts.  My family loved these, although I thought they were just a bit too sweet for biscotti.  However, I will try them again with less sugar.

Yummy! Took to a party and everyone loved them! I put a little extra white chocolate chips in and a little less macadamia nuts to cut the cost a little... they are expensive to make but good for a special occasion. Dipped one side in melted white chocolate chips. Might bake a little longer next time after they are sliced so they are a little harder. Very tasty!

I could not really taste the liquer in these and I used the Di Saronno.  Next time i'll add a bit of almond flavor to accent the amaretto.  They were gobbled up, and I had lots of favorable comments.  I also made the second baking time 15 minutes and flipped them over halfway thru.

Excellent! The brand of chocolate and amaretto make a big difference. I used Guittard, my friend used Nestle. I used Lazzaroni amaretto, she used a store brand. Same recipe, but hers did not taste anywhere near as good as mine did.
It was amazing how the same recipe tasted so different! These were exceptionally good. Daughter is a pastry chef and even she was impressed :)

Great biscotti! I halved the recipe and added chocolate chips to one half and white chocolate chips and cashews to the other. It took longer than called for to bake the second time. Everyone loved it.

Very good. I liked it a little harder, so I left it in longer for the 2nd bake.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made them with sliced almonds and dark chocolate chunks.  My Aunt, who loves Biscotti said it was the best she ever had!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe.  I love the softness of the cookie.  Make sure you don't cook them too long especially on parchment paper.  The bottom gets much darker than the top.

I have made many versions but this is my favourite.  I switched out the liquor for Kahlua, added chocolate chips and no nuts.   So so good.  This recipe is easy to make substitutes.

I thought these were real good.  The white chocolate, macadamia nuts and amaretto compliment each other very well.  Mine took a lot longer to bake than the instructions set and finally I upped it to 350.  Came out good.

Great recipe...sold at a bake sale and I had people asking for the recipe.   I would suggest flouring your hands when you shape into logs as the dough can get sticky.

Really tasty!  However, too soft.  So I put back into 225 degree oven for almost an hour, turning every 15 minutes.  Perfect!!  Used almonds to highlight the Amaretto.  I'll make again!

Very good!! I had to bake a little longer. Made great christmas gifts. I think next time I try it I'm going to replace the macadamia nuts with pecans and then dip half in chocolate.

A very, very good biscotti recipe!  So good I even saved the crumbs to sprinkle over ice cream!  TIP:  Use an electric knife to slice the cookie logs.  It works like a charm.
