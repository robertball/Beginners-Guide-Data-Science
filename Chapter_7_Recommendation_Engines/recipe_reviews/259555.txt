23.18  Well, I have to say that there was no Asian flavor at all in this hen even tthough  I marinated for 9 hours.  But I also would like to say that this was a really tasty dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and basted every 15 minutes. but this was just like eating a really good roasted cornish hen.  Not bad, but not as anticipated either.

Delicious! Keep an eye out for over browning toward the end. The skin was tasty and crisp and the birds quite moist. a definite do-again for Me.
