This recipe was awesome. Two days later I was still talking about it.  The only change I made was I used penne instead of linguine, held the sauce very nicely. This is a definite remake.

This was super easy and super tasty.  We had some Nueske's smoked hot dogs so I used them, doubled the shrimp as well.  Easy peasy.

Very easy and good! Might lighten up on the thyme and paprika, but I like the kick the dish has!

This was absoloutely delicious!  I added some extra veggies and white wine.  Was also heavy on paprika so it had a bit of a kick which we love. I used 2 chicken boulon cubes not the liquid.

Very easy, very good! :)  I used Beddar Cheddars instead of smoked sausage and went easy on the paprika and cayenne.  It makes a lovely sauce :)
