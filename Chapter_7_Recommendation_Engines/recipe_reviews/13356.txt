Nice simple soup.Not to be too picky, but "veggie soup" does not have beef bouillon in it. Try vegetable broth instead!

I am super impressed with this soup!  The tomato juice is a great way to add flavour to the broth. Someone mentioned trying vegetable broth instead, but I loved the beef broth.  I actually added macaroni and wieners, yes wieners, to add some meat for a full meal.  And I was hoping it would intrigue my two little girls, which it totally did. My four-year-old told me the next time I make soup, to make this soup.  I will definitely make this again, but I think next time I will use fresh vegetables instead of frozen. Although  frozen is a good alternative if you don't have fresh veggies in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe

This is such  good idea! So easy! I used V8 juice, one potato, chopped celery, Italian seasoning and pepper. I did simmer it for almost two hours to thicken it up and "melt" the potatoes. The frozen veggies will be for next time since all I had were peas. I serve it with cheese toast made under the broiler with a little paprika on top. Yummy! 

I wish I knew about this years ago because it's a great stock for whatever is in the fridge. V8 juice has a real "bright" flavor that canned tomatoes just don't have. My sister is pretty much anti-veggie but she really liked this recipe. I'm keeping V8 juice in my pantry now!
