These are okay. Definitely you can add more lemon if you like things zesty. I'd like to make again, but maybe use only two eggs, as I found them to be really eggy. I didn't follow measurements to the glaze. I used the juices and zest of one whole lemon and whisked in icing sugar till it was a thick glossy consistency. My icing hardened and was glossy. They are beautiful to look at with the zest poking through. Thanks for the inspiration to have and make a brownie that's not chocolate :)

These are nice and lemony.    I used kosher salt rather than sea salt, and I had to use a 9" pan rather than an 8".  I found that the glaze was too runny, whether it was my doing or the fact that it needed more powdered sugar is unknown.  I would double the amount of powdered sugar in the icing part.  It was hard for me to give up the way I usually mix recipes like this--creaming the butter and sugar and then adding the eggs, etc.  I'm sure that these directions make it more like a sponge cake than a regular cake.  I would make these again and make the icing different.  I used four lemons for this, three for the lemon juice (my lemons weren't very juicy) and the fourth for all the zest I used.   Making these in a 9" pan made it possible for me to use a cookie cutter to cut out the shape.  Thanks, BronsonsMom!

If you want more lemony taste and want to avoid a runny frosting, use True Lemon...it worked perfectly!  I also use True Lemon for my iced tea at restaurants, since most restaurants don't wash their lemons well before putting them into drinks.

These have a nice tender crumb, very good.   I made this recipe with Meyer lemons and the flavor is spectacular.  The only changes I made was to use 2 eggs instead of 3 (some reviews said it was too eggy) and I mixed in  just enough lemon juice to the powered sugar to make a nice thick glaze, I was afraid 1/4 cup would make it too runny.  I am very pleased with the finished product.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I loved these! They are very lemony! My icing was very runny so I sliced the brownies and then poured the icing on. The icing went into the cracks and absorbed into the brownies. I then put powdered sugar on top. So delicious!

I really liked these, and will definitely make them again. I like my desserts sweet, and these were definitely sweet. However, I made them with vanilla and powdered sugar icing(no lemon), and I'm glad I did because I think the lemon might have been a little overwhelming if I had put any lemon juice in the icing. Another "however" is I did not have nearly enough zest for the recipe, so instead I just used an extra tablespoon of juice in the brownie mix.

a new favorite!  Different from lemon bars or lemon cake. The consistency did truly make this a brownie. I brought them to work and they were gone before 10 am. Total winner.

Doubled the recipe for a 9” x 11” pan:
used 4 eggs instead of 6, used zest from 2 lemons (2/3 to mix and 1/3 to frosting), 4 tbs. lemon juice (from lemons)

Frosting:
used 2c. confectioners sugar
lemon zest
1/2 tbs. vanilla 
1/4c. lemon juice ( to a good consistency-not runny)

Turned out deliciously!!

Great recipe! It was a hit with my kids. I only changed the glazed, I only used 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 cup of confectioners sugar, lemon zest and 1 tbsp of milk. It was perfect! Next time I'll try 2 eggs, instead 3.

Definitely too much egg in this recipe and possibly not enough flour. The lemon glaze and flavour are good but the slimy texture due to too much egg was off-putting.

I made this to direction. Like above reviewer, it was too eggy and the icing too runny. I even put the icing in the frig and didn't use that much lemon juice. Don't make this. It's a waste of good ingredients.

I’m thinking that the lemon juice was switched in this recipe. Maybe it should have been 1/4 cup in the batter and 2 Tbs. In the icing because the icing was extremely runny. I solved this by poking holes in the brownies with a skewer and spooning a bit of the runny icing over the top to soak in. Worked brilliantly!

I made it, but I won't make it again. I only used 2 eggs instead of 3 as others recommended,  and that helped, but they weren't very good.  I added twice as much powdered sugar and finally got the icing to be spreadable.

I love anything lemon! These are very good! Moist and tender. I lined the pan with foil, making handles for lifting the brownies out. I doubled the recipe for a pot luck and baked in a 9 X 11 pan.  I live at high altitude so I added 1/4 cup extra flour (for the doubled recipe) and baked an extra 10 minutes. I made about half the amount of glaze because I don't like much and just drizzled it on.  Hubby liked these because they weren't overly sweet.  I will definitely make these again, but will add extra zest, or maybe some lemon extract because I do love my lemons!

We love all things lemon, so I was anxious to try these.  As others noted that they were too eggy, I used only 2 eggs.  Everything else was done as recipe specified.  My glaze was a little runny, but we loved the way it soaked into the brownie.  The flavor was wonderful.  I will make these again.  Thanks.

I made it and it was a big disappointment. Would not make it again. Stodgy and dense and does not resemble a brownie texture in any way. Not recommended, sorry.

Pretty good. Used 2 eggs and a different lemon glaze recipe since the glaze seemed to be the problematic portion of the recipe. It definitely needed the glaze to be good. The texture was reminiscent of a little Debbie brownie, which is not a bad thing.

Following the reviews I only used two eggs. I only had bottled lemon juice so I used 3 tbsp to substitute for the zest. The lemon flavor was strong (which we love) and we thought these were delicious.

I"m a lemon lover and so I made these........superb.  Of course I added more zest and a bit more real lemon juice to the batter...........it doesn't make a big batch........six large.  I'd double the recipe if you are treating someone else.  TY for the recipe!

I used a 9 x 13 pan which produced a thin brownie.  Next time I will double the recipe to make them thicker.  They were still good!  Yummy light dessert.

Just ok. Kind of disappointing, but I’m not sure how much of that is the recipe and how much bad luck. I didn't get the eggy flavour some are getting, but the texture is definitely odd. Accidentally added too much vanilla to the glaze and I think on top of that the lemon I used just happened to be really bitter because even almost doubling the amount of sugar didn’t reduce the bitterness by very much (and considering how thin the glaze is even with double the sugar, I think that part of the recipe is off anyway). Regardless of the mistakes/bad luck, I think the recipe has some flaws that would have come out even if I’d make them “perfectly”. Wouldn't make them again as they are, but I like the idea so might try again using a good tried-and-tested brownie recipe as a guide.

Why the name Lemon Brownies?  Just a cake with frosting.  A Lemon Cake Mix would have been much cheaper and tasted better and I don't like cake mix.  Will not make this recipe again.

The glaze was too runny to spread so had to add additional powdered sugar.  These are not as good as lemon bars and will not make them again.

Loved them! Nice and tart. The tartness seems more impressive the next day. I stuck them in the refrigerator overnight.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except for the glaze. I was dubious about beating it with a mixer, but doing that lightens the batter.  It ends up like a thick pancake batter, which you spread over the pan with a spatula.   It was done in 17 minutes and I made the glaze with about a cup of powdered sugar and a couple table spoons of lemon juice, plus the vanilla.  It's delicious, but not very pretty.  Kind of pale with little holes on top.  I think for guests I'd sift some extra powdered sugar on top of the glaze, just for presentation.  I'd make it again, for those times you want something sweet, lemony, and easy to make!

Very  easy  to make , I agree  with  another  reviewer ,  fresh  lemons  did not provide  a  strong  enough flavor , so I used bottle  juice  as well.  I  added  zest  to the  mix  as well as the  glaze.    Finally  I had to add  my love of coconut, and  because  a coworker  only  likes it toasted, that's  what  I sprinkled  on top. That is  how  I  will  always  make  this  recipe .

Quick and easy - everyone loved them. I also heated up some lemon juice and sugar to make a syrup and poured over the top of them - delicious!

I've made these going on #5 and they never make it till morning (it's 9 pm).
1/4 cup of lemon juice is too much for the icing; between the zest and the juice needed I use one whole lemon and it's perfect.
I put 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime and they turned out awesome; next time it's all Lime, can't wait :-/
