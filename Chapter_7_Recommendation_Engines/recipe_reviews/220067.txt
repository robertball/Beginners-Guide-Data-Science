I never had eggplant before but I was plesantly suprised. This recipe is delicious. My fiancé is a vegetarian so I get tired of pasta and this was a great change of pace.  I think the only thing I added was a minced clove if garlic to the spinach mixture. My only beef with this recipe is the labor. It took hours. Definitely not a weeknight meal. I think next time in the interest of time I will brown the eggplant on a sheet in the oven as suggested by my fiancé. 2 eggplants yields quite a few slices. Browning 5 minutes on each side takes ages. I may also use spaghetti sauce instead of the crushed tomato mixture just to see the difference. If your on your own preparing this, give yourself some time.

This was fantastic! My boyfriend and I aren't huge eggplant fans and he loves meat, but this was delish! I ate what was left for lunch the next few days-- it kept getting better! Alot of prep, so if you're short on time, this may not be the recipe for you!

Great! I just "grilled" the eggplant slices on my george forman with some cooking spray, way faster and less fat.

Meh. I made the recipe just as stated. This recipe took forever to make since the sliced eggplant took 5 minutes per side and there were many slices to cook. Prepping the other ingredients also took quite a while, used many dishes that had to be cleaned, and made an overall kitchen mess that wasn't worth the time vs. outcome. The flavor was fine, but nothing special for me. I found it to be more like a layered vegetable stew than a lasagna. I really missed the noodles to give it some stability and some kind of chewing texture.

Smells good, looks good, and pretty easy to make.  I browned the slices in the oven to make it faster and pre-prepped my dry ingredients while the eggplant was drying.  I also peeled the skin off.  It's the first time ever making homemade lasagna and I'm pretty thrilled with it.  Added more spices and cheese and it's a huge hit!  Next time I'll try breaded eggplant slices for a change.

I am transitioning over to becoming a vegetarian.  I wanted to try something new,  and I came across this recipe. My family was kind of spectacle about it, because it contained no meat! The meal still had that great hearty taste, and the eggplant replaced the meat in an incredible way. The pan was empty, and my family is craving more! Thanks!!!! Defiantly a meal to go down in the books.

My family loved this!  I substituted the eggplant with zucchini and prepped it the same way (Only because the grocery store was outfoxed eggplant). I also added 2lbs of ground beef and a few cloves of minced garlic to the sauce. It was fantastic.  It does take a long time to prep so the next time I make this I will make a few batches and freeze them.  My father hates zucchini and he cleaned his plate... twice...said it was the best lasagna he's ever had! Thumbs up!

I would give this more stars if I could.  This was soooo good.  Sadly my husband doesn't like eggplant but I'm going to try this with lasagna noodles sometime.

I thought this was pretty good, considering it has no pasta noodles. My son ate it without (much) complaint. My two year old wouldn't touch it, but that's nothing new.

This was delicious!  The recipe did not say whether to peel the eggplant or not.  I chose not to peel it but the next time I make it, I will because the peel was a little tough.  Other than that, I made no changes and it was perfect.

I followed the recipe at the beginning.  The step on getting the eggplant to release the water worked really well.  I deviated from the recipe two ways, the first is I used my own homemade sauce and second I added a bunch more Mozz between layers, love cheese

This was just okay for me.  I didn't care much for the sauce to be honest.  It's also a time consuming recipe.  Don't think this is something I'd prepare again.

I made this as a gluten free alternative for a big family dinner and got several compliments, even requests for the recipe! A little extra work but not much more than any from scratch lasagne recipe. I liked it as more than traditional lasagne! I added some cooked Italian sausage to prepared marinara sauce, and mushrooms to the veg mixture. Broiling the eggplant slices rather than frying was a great shortcut.

This was delicious!!!  Bought some eggplant at the farmer's market and wondered what to do with it.  Cheated and used jarred sauce - cooked up quickly.  Love the addition of veggies, garlic and onion powder to the ricotta cheese.  Very tasty - will make again!

This recipe is delicious,  BUT took forever to make! I doubt I will make it again unless I have a day to kill.
