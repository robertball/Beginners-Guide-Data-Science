I had never tried making this type of roast before, and I found this recipe on Pinterest. It turned out beautifully, and everyone loved it. It is a keeper, and I will make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly - my oven did not go down to 170 so I set it to 'warm' for the last hour of cooking. It turned out a perfect medium. I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed spinach!

A+. First time try yielded roast beast perfection. 13 mins at 500 for small (2.08 lb) eye of round. Then nothing for 2hours. Evenly medium rare. Started with Room temp roast with oil n aggressive dry rub. Salt pep garlic powd cinn onion powd. Sharpen yer best knife n slice thin.
I had vigly avoided eye round for decades - too much chew. Wowsa. 10 Q.

I marinated my roast for over 48 hours. (Change of plans is why it was so long.) I should have used my own judgement to cook it. Tough, tough, tough. Eye of round does not belong with this cooking method. Plus mine ended up being overdone.

I have made this three times and it is easy and great! I buy locally raised grass fed beef and it is fantastic. This recipe gives me control over the temperature. I do weigh each roast so I cut the time of the initial heating to work with the size. I cannot use wine so I substitute organic red grape juice or white organic grape juice with a little lemon whenever a recipe calls for wine.

Fantastic recipe! Through allrecipe I've become a believer of using aluminum foil when baking. The seasoning was delicious, the roast stayed tender, and like other reviews I read, for a Med-rare to Medium roast, only ~ 45 minutes of baking time was required. (Could have been less had I used the convection setting.). The use of the two pieces of foil made transferring the drippings into a pan for the sauce simple, and the sauce itself was delicious. Will definitely be making this again. Even my picky kids loved it!

This was the best beef roast recipe I've ever used! The seasoning comes out relatively subtle with the beef flavor after cooking. The au jus was incredible too. I added mushrooms to it and it was the best meal I've had in a while. You might want to make a point of removing any excess rub before placing on the foil to avoid having too much salt accumulate in the sauce after reducing it. If I could, I would give it ten stars.

this is a great recipe.  Eye of the round is easy to overcook,  I took it out of the oven at rare and it looked close to medium rare.  the seasoning is great and the directions look complicated but they are easy to follow

I cut the salt by half, and the pepper by half and I added extra chopped garlic, and a little onion powder to the roast rub. I also added a little of McCormick Montreal Steak spice mix.  This method of roasting  was so easy. I had to add approx. 30 minutes additional time to reach the internal temp of 145 for a medium finish but my oven sucks. Use an instant read thermometer to get the exact temp. Very good results. Perfect Medium.

This was the first time I've ever made a roast.   It turned out amazing,  I added onions to the bottom of the pan -just because I like onions.   Turned out just like the recipe stated!   Will definitely make this again!

I made this last week with a whole eye of round, 6lbs, for 8 people. I didn't add the wine at all, because my husband hates the taste. I had no thyme, so I used some herbs de Provence that I had. It was perfect. So tender, not chewy like eye of round can get. The crust scented the whole house for two days. It was delicious. The leftovers (and there weren't many of them!) were still yummy 2 days later with tomato sauce.

Always hesitated to roast eye of the Round due to it turning out tough.  Followed this recipe , didn't  bother with the sauce, but the meat turned out a perfect medium pink and thin sliced beautiful.

Didn't use foil. Had it in a roasting  tin and just put the lid on instead of wrapping in foil.  Cooked it to 140 deg F internal. Threw in potatoes too for roasting. Family loved it.

I have made this roast 3 times now. I never knew it was so easy to make a roast beef! My husband and teens love it. Instead of red wine, I used extra beef broth. One time I had no beef broth so I substituted 1/2 beef consume and 1/2 water.  Both ways are delicious!

After reading so many rave reviews, I decided to try this with Eye round. I too followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a beautiful tasty medium.
I will definitely try this again.

I used half oregano and half ground thyme as part of the rub. I made a gravy of just the juices and skipped the wine and broth and the flavour was amazing. Super tender and cooked perfectly

This was the first time I made this, I made sure to follow the time per pound directions to a t, and started checking temp at 40 minutes out since my oven runs a bit hotter.  I was done at 45 minutes. 
A little to peppery for my younger kids taste buds, but not terrible.  I also skipped the wine in the sauce and doubled the broth, I just didn't have it on hand(or I drank it...hmm).  
Next time I will decrease the pepper by 1/2 teaspoon and up the thyme and maybe add a touch of rosemary per request of my oldest.  Overall, a well done recipe.

I made this exactly as written, with a 2.94 lb roast, and when I took it out of the oven it was a perfect 134 degrees.  The rub is awesome, very flavorful and forms a bit of a crust on the outside of the Roast.  Inside is juicy and tender.  The Wine Sauce was perfect with it.  As another reviewer noted, it is a Keeper!

I did not make the sauce to go with it, but the basic recipe was solid and I would remake it. I would think about a horseradish crust would add some great flavor

Not amazing or as terrific as other reviewers rated.  But probably as good as Eye of Round could be.  If eye of round is the only option, then this is definitely the best recipe and method to roast it.  Make sure to slice thin.

Rub was great - my roast was 2.1 pounds, so I should have reduced the 1 hour slow cook by about 15 minutes, as the meat was more medium than medium rare, so it was a little tough.  Might reduce the 500 degree roast by a minute or two next time as well (I went with 14 minutes).  Will give it another try as it's a good recipe.

This was so easy and very tasty .  The meat was a bit tough but could be the piece I bought even though it was an eye round roast. I’ll make it again. Used leftover meat and au jus in soup the next day which was very good also.

Delicious recipe and worked perfectly.  I shortened the times a bit due to slightly smaller roast, stuffed mine with lots of garlic and it’s tender with lots of juices to make a red wine based reduction for gravy.  Will definitely use this again!

I followed this new recipe, never again! I had a 2.60lb roast and after  18 mins. @ 500 then wrap it up and lowered the oven temp to 170; @ the end of one hour it was still so cold inside that it didn't even register on my meat thermometer!    So my dinner with company was over an hour late being served!!

This was excellent! I will definitely make again. The only change I made was the cooking time. The roast reached 140 degrees too soon so it sat too long and began to cool down. I put it back in the oven at the high temp. for about 15 minutes to bring it back to 140 and it was perfect. Very tender; slicing thin is important though.

Followed the recipe exactly except for checking the temp at 45 minutes instead of an hour and I am glad I did.  All ovens run a little differently.  It was a little more done then I would have liked, so next time I will check it at 35 minutes.  But it was still delicious!  The au jus was also delicious.  The next day I took the cold roast and shaved with a sharp knife and warmed it in the hot au jus and made drippy beef sandwiches.  So Yummy!

Always Check the cooking time about 15 minutes sooner I took this out about 15 minutes early and it was just medium it came out very tender I would suggest using a quarter of a cup of wine because it becomes very overpowering the gravy is very good as it’s thickened with butter and really enhances the taste of the meat I would make this again

I made this exactly as directed and it was 45 degrees upon temping!  Had to stick it back in the oven at 350 for another 45 minutes.  I won't follow this recipe again.

I had a 3.6 pound roast.  After 21 minutes at 500 degrees, I wrapped it and dropped the temperature in the oven to 170. After 1 hour, the temperature was 91 degrees in the middle.  I tried another 1/2 hour and it was only up to 101 degrees.  I upped the temperature to 325 degrees in the oven and tested the temp several times.  Finally took it out after another 45 minutes.  It's red throughout and my husband says it's tender.  I didn't try it because I ate leftovers for dinner.  I guess this will be tomorrow night's dinner.  Glad we didn't have people over for dinner

I cooked a 5.5 pound eye of round for 6 minutes per pound at 500 (after at room temp for an hour).  Lowered the oven temp to 170, and the roast was 100 degrees after an hour.  So...dinner was supposed to be ready an hour ago.  I haven't tasted it yet because it's still cooking.  I had to raise the temp of the oven, so we'll see.

I used a roasting pan with a lid instead of the tin foil. When removed after one hour at the 170° part of the roasting, my meat thermometer read 135°, so I would have removed it sooner for a more rare temperature on the meat. But overall it was juicy and delicious!

OMG! This came out perfect!! I stopped making beef roasts in the oven long ago because I just never had luck. It always seemed to be overdone and tough. This was a wonderful surprise. I  had a one pound eye round roast. Baked it for 6 minutes on 500 degrees and then took 18 minutes more at 170. Perfect, tender and pink from end to end. My picky 16 year old daughter loved it. Will be making roasts more often! Thank you Reynolds Kitchens!! :)

The only reason I am giving this four out of five stars is because the red wine overpowered the Au Jus. This could just be because my roast didn't produce many drippings after cooking.  The taste, cook temp and texture came out perfect.  The roast was 5.25 pounds so I doubled the recipe which worked well (for those looking to entertain a larger crowd).   I am not a huge fan of dried herbs so I subbed fresh Rosemary, Thyme, Garlic, S&P to make a paste and let the beef marinate on the counter until room temp (about 45 min).  After 30 minutes at 450 and an hour at 200, the roast registered at 130 (for medium rare) so I pulled it out of the oven, covered it with foil and let it rest for 30 minutes while preparing the sauce and sides.  Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed!

This came out very nice!  The meat was tender and spices were balanced except for the salt, too salty!  I will reduce salt and add Thyme next time.
Thanks for a great recipe!
Meal #2, reduced salt by half, increased tyme a little, need to double next time. Made gravy and used Gluten-free flour to thicken. Need to pull roast when rare since it continues to cook.  Everything was good!  Served with mashed sweet potatoes.

Was amazing! Flavor was spot on and the au jus was even better. I doubled the rub to get all over. Never knew you could cook a tough piece of meat to be so tender! Putting this on my regular list for dinner!

I seared the roast in my frying pan before I wrapped it and threw it in the oven. I did about an hour and a half at 225 instead, but kept everything wrapped. The gravy, I substituted white wine (I don't like opening something I'm not going to drink) and made a rou with butter and flour to thicken the gravy. Otherwise it was a ridiculously tender roast... Like everyone said it was very much like my prime rib. I was pretty surprised how tender it was though.

I had a three pound roast so I followed this recipe to a "T".  While it was tasty, it came out overdone and gray in colour.  The next time I will try searing it and cooking it in a 250 degree oven.

Didn’t make any changes, and took it out of the oven at exactly 125 degrees.  Used our meat slicer and it was tender and delicious!  Will roast beef this way from now on!

It’s a good roast, and the family loved it, but I don’t think wrapping it in foil made it tender. It might have been the meat, but it was pretty tough to chew, and I used the same cut they recommended in the recipe.

We both liked it.   IProbably would have loved it if we had not overcooked it.  I didnt check it with a thermometer until an hour; and the roast was 3.3 lbs.  It was well done.   But - the gravy was AWESOME.   Will definitely make again.

This beef roast recipe is the best I have ever tried! I did not thicken the drippings. I just poured them over the roast once cut in a chaffing dish that would hold them in. Also sliced very thinly as the leftovers( if there are any) are superb for sandwiches too.

I finally have a go to receipt for round roasts!! I found I didn’t need to leave in as long as recommended here. My oven has varied heat bottom to top - I think that’s what happened. Tonight I am making it again and will take out a little sooner. Love the flavourful coating.

The method of cooking was very good. Note that this beef simply doesn't get tender. It is not tough just "to the teeth" as it were. Recommended.

My home oven only heats to 450 F. So the bake times had to be increased. I omitted the wine. Great flavor I will be using this recipe again.

I made no changes and followed the recipe exactly.The roast was way overdone but it had a great flavor.  I cut it into tiny pieces, mixed it into the pan juices and served over mashed potatoes.
Wish someone could tell me what I did wrong.

Followed the directions except I used a flavor injector and injected onion butter into the meat before cooking.  The meat was cooked absolutely perfectly, and was very tender.  I will definitely make this again!

I cooked as specified and waited 10 after taking out of the oven to cut.  I cut against the grain for tenderness.  It was not tender, even the medium done.  I recooked in the crockpot after cutting the remainder of the roast into pieces.  It turned out good, much more tender.

The flavor was great, but it was still vert tough,but for that cut l guess that is just how it is.  After our first meal l threw it in the crock and add pod the broth and some more stock and cooked it down so it was tender. Then used it to make hot beef sandwiches for DH. I won't make it again.

I have made a number of eye-of-round roasts with varying results.  As my husband likes meat rare, that is how I prepared this, following the directions exactly as written, and served it with mashed potatoes, gravy, steamed asparagus and salad.  Throughout the meal, he kept commenting on what a wonderful dinner it was.  I don't usually compliment myself on my cooking, but also thought it was the best eye-of-round recipe I have tried and I will definitely be making this again.

OMG! This is FAB-U-LOUS!!!  I bought this cut of meat on accident. Not knowing what it was or how to prepare it, I turned to my trusty friends at All Recipes. They did NOT steer me wrong.  While I agree that Eye of Round Roast is not the best cut of meat, and I most likely won't buy again ... This rub is fantastic and I plan to use it on my Easter prime rib!! Furthermore, if you have that kind of roast, this is definitely the recipe to use!  I doubled the amount of rub (because it didn't seem like enough for a 3 pound roast) and then used it liberally all over.  I followed the cooking method to a 'T' and the results were beyond good, so don't pay any attention to the reviews that say this type of roast shouldn't be cooked in this manner. Also whipped up the red wine sauce and it was a great addition to the meat!  This recipe is a definite keeper!!

I really don't know if it's fair to rate this one. It was excellent with the changes made. I had a roast of approx. 1.28 lbs and halved the garlic with fresh garlic locally grown and added about 1 tsp of thyme. I also added approx. 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to the other ingredients in the recipe. I reduced the freshly ground salt and pepper to 1/2 the receipe.  Marinated for about 1 hour.  I accidentally forgot to turn off the oven(or reduce the oven) at 500 F after the 8 minutes and left it on for approx. 20 more mins.(the oven door was not opened during cooking).  I promptly withdrew the roast from the oven. Had used a shallow tin pie pan. Placed the roast on the stove with foil loosely on top for about 20 mins. I was so very pleasantly surprised!! The result, a crisp coated, juicy, medium rare roast . Excellent result!! Will be making this again. I am currently going to try the sauce but added 1/2 (mushroom and beef total)bollion to approx. 1 1/2 cups of water to reduce on the stove, no wine.  Can't wait to try it!

Great recipe. If you like it rare, cut the time in at 170 degrees down to 25-35 minutes.

The people who made this successfully must have "the magic touch."  My oven works perfectly, I followed the directions exactly, and the result was a severely delayed Christmas dinner. After 1 1/2 hours the internal temperature barely reached 130 degrees.  I finally turned up the oven temperature to 375 (recommended by EVERY other recipe I found) to get it to cook.  Still in the oven (almost 2 hours now) and thinking we may to resort to cheese as our main course.  Very disappointed!!!

I was hoping for a somewhat tender roast so I could slice very thin for French dip style sandwiches. Followed recipe exactly. Turned out tough as leather, even thinly sliced. Is this the fault of the cut of meat? Or what? Very disappointed. Can I somehow continue to cook this to a somewhat tender state? Or is this 3-1/2 pounder ruined.

This was straight up easy to do!  My kids age 6,4,&3 all ate their roast beef up with the jus. I can't believe how easy this was and how delicious it came out. I made the au jus to specs except I omitted the butter. Didn't need it.

Loved this! I followed the directions exactly for the roast. I would have liked a  little more "crust" on the roast, but not enough to have it dry out. Ours was very tender & flavorful. The only change I made, and this was just personal preference, was to make a slurry of flour & water to add to the gravy to thicken it a bit. Roast and sauce were both delicious! This will be my go-to recipe for eye of round from now on!

The flavor is great and this method keeps the meat nice and juicy.  My oven takes longer than the recommended cook time though.

Just cut up parsley, lemon thyme, and rosemary from the garden to combine with garlic, salt and pepper, left it in the oven about 10 minutes longer because the gang doesn't like it too rare. And I carmelized some button mushrooms for the sauce. Yummy

This recipe is fabulous! I have never made this type of roast before and was a bit worried about the outcome, but take my advice and just try it...I think you'll pleasantly surprised! I had a five pound roast and just doubled the seasonings.  My whole family gave rave reviews saying it was the best and favorite way of eating beef! the sauce itself is incredible, so make sure you follow that part of the recipe as well. I wouldn't change a thing!

I had never cooked this cut of meat and was a little nervous. I followed the recipe as written and it turned out delicious. My family loved it and the leftovers make wonderful roast beef sandwiches when sliced thinly.  It was tender and tasty. We like ours medium rare. The sauce recipe is awesome. I will definitely make this again.

This was incredible. Got a 3 lb roast for $5 and it tasted like a $20 meal.  I used about 8 cloves of garlic in a press and followed the recipe from there.  Once the roast had rested after coming out of the oven I sliced it up and put all the slices in the sauce.  

Unbelievably tender and loaded with flavor - I couldn't get enough of it.

I wasn't a huge fan of the thyme seasoning - but the actual cooking instructions were PERFECT!  The meat was so tender and delicious,  it was a family hit. And my husband loved the sauce from the drippings.

Really good recipe! I cooked it 45 minutes at 200 degrees, and still had a nice texture.
