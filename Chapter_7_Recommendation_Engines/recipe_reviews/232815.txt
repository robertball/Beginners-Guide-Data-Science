I'm a big fan of blue cheese and baking my main dishes so this was perfect. I enjoyed the flavour and how filling it was with the rice it actually filled the plate but didn't overpower the chicken. I followed the recipe almost exactly aside from proportions and my boyfriend loved it. Easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

It was ok. Found the rice to be a bit bland even with the chicken stock. Kids ate it for the most part.

Absolutely delicious with the following adjustments: substitute long grain & wild rice for white rice. Season rice w/white pepper before serving. Increase cheese blend by 50%.

This chicken dish was just ok for our family. I thought the bleu cheese marinated chicken would have more flavor than it did. The dish did take longer to bake as I had leg/thigh combo pieces of chicken. I liked the crunch of the panko crumbs and Parmesan-Romano cheese blend. The rice had a very mild flavor and was cooked perfectly. Not a bad dinner by any means and your family might really enjoy it.

I thought this was delicious! I made some changes but not to the recipe just to the way that I cooked it. I saut√©ed the celery onion and garlic as in the recipe and added the broth (I used vegetable cuz that's all I had) but didn't add the rice to the mixture. I poured that into the baking dish. I also coated the chicken completely in the panko crumbs after removing from the bag. I then placed them in the broth mixture and baked uncovered at 375' for 35 minutes. I removed and sprinkled more panko and added the cheese as stated in the recipe and baked at 420' for an additional 10 minutes. I made the rice separately and served the chicken and sauce mixture on top. SCRUMPTIOUS! Thank you for this great recipe!

I hated it. Everyone else though It was just okay. Chicken and rice were beyond bland even with a Blue Cheese marinade and Cajun seasoning. Tasted like a dish they serve at my grandmother's nursing home. Won't make again.

The "covered" cook time should be extended. The taste was OK but not worth the effort.
