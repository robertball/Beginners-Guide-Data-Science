I had half a can of whole cranberry sauce to use up and chose this recipe.  Instead of a 4 lb. beef tenderloin I just used two nice filets.  I made the sauce early in the day and let it sit at room temperature, reheating it just before serving.  We grilled our steaks and when plating, I spooned some sauce on the plates and topped it with the filets.  Nice flavor that we enjoyed very much.  I will say this isnâ€™t the prettiest sauce.  The balsamic vinegar makes it a very dark brown.  So, not exactly appealing to the eye, but definitely delicious!

I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dried. Was a little much, since I did the seasoning amount called for, but only have about 1 1/2 pounds tenderloin (we butcher our cattle much smaller...and we have Lowlines...so the cuts just aren't as big). Was really good, though. My husband said he could do without the thyme, but I think it was just that it was too much. I liked it! I cut the sauce recipe in half. The sauce was a great compliment to the tenderloin! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  Made for Christmas Dinner just as recipe directed and it was great - everyone loved it.  I used an 8 lb untrimmed beef tenderloin, but once trimmed was easily 6 lb.  Feed 6 adults will a few leftovers.
