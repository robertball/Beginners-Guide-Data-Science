Very easy and very good! It's nice when you use a couple of simple ingredients you have around the kitchen that come together for something that tastes good.  I used low sodium beef broth and KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and I did throw in a few shakes of Montreal Steak Seasoning for good measure.  I didn't use the entire amounts listed in the recipe, but just eyeballed what I needed for 2 good sized T-bone steaks.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for a few hours, brought the steaks to room temp. and then grilled.  Very tasty!  I would probably use this again for a tougher cut of meat such as London Broil and let it marinate for a good 48 hours and see what happens...

My fiance made these for my Birthday Dinner the other night. OMG! They were WONDERFUL! SOOO flavorful and juicy and wonderful! He  let them marinade for about 36 hours before cooking, which I would highly recommend!

This is awesome!!!  I used 2 beef bouillion dissolved in 2 cups water and an entire bottle of hot bbq sauce (scorned woman to be exact).  I also threw in about 1/4 cup of chili sauce that I had on hand.  I cut up a roast and marinaded all day in a food saver container.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow is this a great recipe and made exactly as written.  One thing I would like to suggest is double check your BBQ sauce.  I did mine and found that my full bottle was only 14 oz.  I had more of the exact same in the fridge so was ok on the amount.  The steaks ended up marinating for 24 hours.  The meat was tender and full of flavour.  Will be doing again. MAY/15 UPDATE I DID A MAJOR TWEAK ON THIS RECIPE.  I SUB CHICKEN BROTH FOR THE BEEF AND MARINATED 4 CHICKEN LEGS AND 3 CHICKEN BREAST HALFS.  TASTED JUST A GREAT AS THE BEEF.
