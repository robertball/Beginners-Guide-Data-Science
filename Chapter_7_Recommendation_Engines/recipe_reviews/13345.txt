WOW! This was wonderful! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except: used only 1 can of the Italian tomatoes because I only had one. I put in an equal amount of White Zinfandel wine - used it to deglaze the pan after browning as someone else suggested. I added 2 TBSP of Worchestershire sauce because we like it. I did let the meat simmer for about an hour before adding the potatoes and carrots to ensure the meat was tender! It was DELICIOUS! This will definitely be a keeper and one that I prepare often. Plus, it is easy to prepare and takes little time except for the cooking! Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a novice cook.  This stew was my first experience with beef.  It was so easy even *I* had no problems with it!  My husband loved it and I felt like queen of the world serving it.  This domestic stuff is more fun that I thought it would be.  :)  Thanks!

Once again I am reading reviews looking for something to cook for dinner and all these reviews add extra ingredients. How am I suppose to know if the recipe has a good rating if everyone keeps adding things to the recipe? Make the recipe as is and rate it. That's the right thing to do. I am not making this because I don't have time to scroll down and read all the ingredients everyone threw in and even if I did I couldn't afford it! If you can't rate a recipes "as is" then say nothing. I am moving on to find something else to cook tonight. GEEZE Louise!

Very good!  Does have a strong dijon flavor, so if that's not for you, you may want to cut way back.  Like many reviewers, I browned the meat first and put that, along with everything else in the crockpot.  I didn't make any changes except adding two garlic cloves and about 1/2 lb. of fresh green beans that needed to be used.  Sadly, I didn't realize I had no thyme until I was almost done making this.  I bet it would be even better with thyme.  The stew got nice and thick and I didn't have to add any extra flour.  Was very flavorful too.  My only complaint was that it was a little salty, and I used reduced-sodium broth and added no extra salt.  Next time I'd use one can of salt-free tomatoes.  I bet the leftovers will be great!  Served with french baguettes from this site.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm very satisfying! I added some mushrooms, celery, and a dash of Worchestshire sauce.  Also used some onion soup mix and Italian seasoning and added a little less mustard.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I've made it twice.  The first time I added half an onion, a few fresh sliced mushrooms, and about half a cup of wine.  The second time, I made the recipe almost exactly as written.  Unexpectedly, I like the recipe as written much better.  I thought both the flavor and the consistency was improved.  Though the stew was excellent both ways.  But I must have been using much tougher stew meat than the author, because I had to simmer about two hours before it was tender enough to eat.

I used my instincts and added a few items, and it was fantastic. 
I added 1 onion (sliced into thin rings) and 1/4 cup red wine. Then with 10 minutes from the end, I added 1/2 cup frozen peas. Make sure to use Dijon - it matters. Excellent

So wonderful!  I made the following tweaks: omitted the thyme (didn't have any), added a chopped red onion and plenty of minced garlic.  Also added a splash of worchestershire and a bit of red wine per other reviews.  Served with warm biscuits for dipping - even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used red wine to deglaze the pan, as per other reviews and added an onion and more potatoes.  This was my first attempt at making beef stew and was a huge hit!  I think the Dijon gave it that little "something" that made it stand out.  It was great!

I always make a conscious effort to follow recipes the way they written first, and rate them based on this. However, I want to rate this five stars even though I changed the cooking method. After browning the meat I chucked everything in the slow cooker for 4 and a half hours on high. Kept ingredients the same. This tasted really delicious, and the meat was lovely and tender. Didn't think the mustard was overpowering at all.

Yum! This was simply fantastic. Even tho I already have a favorite stew recipe, I'll definitely be adding this one to my regular rotation. My stand-by recipe takes hours to prepare (it slow cooks all day). The fact that CORWYNN's version takes minimal time to prepare, calls for basic ingredients I generally keep on hand and takes only an hour to cook makes it a great candidate for an "on the fly" weeknight meal. Having said this, it did take about 1.5 hours to produce fork-tender meat (as is, my meat was a tad tough). Since my hubby forgot to chill our bottle of wine to serve with dinner, it worked out to our advantage to cook this an extra half hour. :) And the best part??? The dijon mustard!!!! It takes this stew to an entirely new (elevated) level. For the one reviewer who complained that adding mustard produced a vinegary tasting stew, perhaps yours was out of date??? Mustard turns to vinegar over time and certainly if it is kept past it's use by date (just a thought). DON'T leave the mustard out!!! You might as well find a recipe that better suits your taste if you do, IMHO. Served with French-style green beans and crusty Italian bread, this was a DEEELICIOUS meal. Thanks SO much for sharing CORWYNN! :-)

This is a very easy and tasty beef stew recipe.  After browning the meat, I transferred to a slow cooker and added the rest of ingredients.  I cooked for about 4 hours on high, then low until ready to serve.  Worked great!!

I have tried many recipes from this site and most have been great, but this is the first I've rated.  I followed the advice of others and added seasonings to the flour (Tony's and garlic powder), browned 2 lbs of meat with 1/2 onion, then deglazed the pan with about 1/3 cup dry red wine.  I then put it all in a crockpot, added an extra can of broth,  used 4 lbs of red potatoes, a tbsp of Worchestershire sauce, and the 2 tbsp of mustard, as called for in the recipe.  I let it cook on high for 6 hrs, but the potatoes were not quite done and it smelled a little off.  But, after adding the mustard and allowing to cook on low for a few more hours, it was perfect. Gravy was smooth and had complex flavor.  It was even better the next day.  Got rave reviews... husband said it was the BEST stew he'd ever had.  And I have to agree!! YUM!!!

This was excellent! Tastes even better this morning. Added chopped onion, garlic, herbes de provence and red wine. Also when I coated the meat with flour, I threw in some garlic powder. The dijon is great in this recipe -- I even added a bit more. This will be the only beef stew recipe I ever use again. I cannot believe that some reviewers didn't like this. Forget about them and try it.

Awesome! So good! And if you don't like the mustard, just don't add it. We also have this with some egg noodles.

This stew turned out OK, not bad but not nearly as amazingly delicious as I had hoped..It's a bit bland, even with the dijon. Some red chili pepper flakes and sweet potatoes might help!

Great stew for a rainy night! I sauteed chopped onions and celery before adding the beef. I added some mushrooms and cilantro as well. My husband loved it!

I followed the recipe fairly closely with the following changes.  I browned the beef in olive oil, without flouring first.  Then I drained most of the fat, using about two tablespoons to saute my mirepoix.  Then I assembled the rest of the ingredients, adding enough red wine to cover, brought the stew to a boil, then finished (covered) in the oven at 350 for about two hours.

This is excellent! I picked up a pound of beef stew meat for super cheap, but I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. I found this recipe and decided to give it a go, although I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I only had 1 lb of meat and tossed it with the flour and lots of black pepper. I also threw in half of an onion chopped, as I didn't have any carrots in the house. I didn't have italian diced tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes with onion and garlic and added some italian seasoning blend. I also didn't have any beef broth, so I used water and added some beef bouillon. I simmered all of that for about an hour before adding the potatoes, as some of the reviewers said that they became mushy. About 15 minutes before it was done, I added a bag of frozen green beans. So, my total cook time was about two hours. Boy, is this good! The mustard really adds a nice, unique flavor. I am freezing this in individual portions for lunches, and I can't wait! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent--Just a really good, classic tasting stew.  I skipped the browning of the meat, just tossed it in flour and mixed all ingredients in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low.

This was good. I did add onion and garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe. I must admit that I don't quite see what makes this french though. It seems much more italian then french, which could be the additions I made. It was a nice meal and I was surprised to see my 5 year old daughter actually eating it too.

Very good.  I made a few small changes.  I didn't have any can styled Italian tomatoes, so I just used regular tomatoes and I opted to use sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes.  Very good.  Season to taste.

I was so confused by all the changes made in the ratings for this recipe that I simply made it as listed and then put everything in the crock pot. This was easy to make and very flavorful. It will be my go-to recipe for stew.

First time I've made beef stew and my family was mad that I was making it - they don't like beef stew. Turned out that they LOVED it. I did make a few changes though. I added salt and pepper to the flour, used a little more olive oil and added some butter when browning the 2 lbs of meat. Deglazed with 1/2 cup of red wine. Added celery, pearl onions and minced garlic. My family hates mustard, so I only used 1 tbs on mustard and i added it with the beef broth so cooking would mellow out the flavor. Added 1 tsb of worchester sauce, about 3 tbs of beef base and 1/2 tsp of ground celery seed. No additional salt was needed, but it did need pepper. Simmered for about 1 1/2 hours covered and 1/2 hour uncovered to thicken. Truly the BEST beef stew I've ever had.

My husband made this and the only thing he did different was to deglaze the pan with about a cup of red wine after browning the meat. The red wine then cooked in the stew with all the little tidbits normally stuck to the bottom of the pan. It was delicious!

It took over 6 hours for this to be done on high in my crock pot - it may be that it's because I have an old one (25 years).  I wasn't thrilled with how it looked (or even tasted) - still too watery though I had thickened with cornstarch a few times during cooking.  I had added the spices someone else here recommended. Because it was so late, we ate it the next night.  It was just right and we all liked it.

OMG this is good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but I did season the flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder before I brownded the meat , and added an onion when I added the veggies after letting the meat simmer for an hour first.

Delicious! I will be making more of this, and adding my own tweaks to the recipe as well. I've already made this again, and added more potatoes and carrots, as well as marjoram, sage, basil, and rosemary. I also found spicy brown mustard to compliment it very well, since I didn't have any dijon mustard for the second batch.

Home run!  I usually think beef stew is boring, but I always keep my fingers crossed that I'll find the perfect recipe - this is it!  I used fresh rosemary instead of thyme.   I deglazed the bottom of the pan with a little bit of the beef broth after browning the meat before adding everything else.  I stirred in the mustard with all the other ingredients instead of at the end.  So tasty - I just wish it was winter right now!

Good, but  a little bit bland as written.  I added chopped celery and onion to the vegetables and sprinkled in garlic powder.  Served with cornbread.   This is a nice hearty, stick to the ribs kind of meal!

The meat took longer to cook, probably 90 minutes.  The mustard was a great addition.  I only had veggie broth and needed to add quite a bit of salt.  This would probably be better in a slow cooker.

I LOVED this!  It had way more flavor than the traditional dinty moore type with the following additions: 1 packet onion soup mix, 1 bay leaf, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp italian seasoning and I subbed honey dijon for plain dijon because I like it better.  I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure how it would turn out and I wish I hadn't because DH and I polished off the whole thing so there's no leftovers.   :(

I didn't find anything worth raving about with this recipe. I followed recipe to the T & found the flavors mild, meat tough and potatoes mushy. I was hoping to find my next favorite stew recipe based on the other reviews, but will have to keep looking.

Yum. Yum. Yum.  I also added one small yellow onion, cut into large pieces.  1/2 cup red wine, and I used less oil while braising the beef so I could throw in a teaspoon of butter before tossing in the cubes.   This was excellent.  My husband and I are foodies.  And impressing him is no easy task.  He's a bit of a snob really.  He loved this.  This recipe has now excited him about this website and he's now decided to add some of his own recipes on!   So, if you like good, simple, yet bold flavors melded together, this is a good recipe for you.  don't forget the dijon.  An addition that goes far!  Thank you Corwynn!

I thought this was just delicious, and my husband enjoyed it aswell and had two helpings. However, I made a few changes. I also used 6 small potatoes, a few bay leaves, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, a sliced brown onion, a little sugar and I mixed some herb and garlic seasoning into the flour mix to coat the beef. I only had 500g of beef, but it was still enough. After browning the beef in the pan I cooked it all in the slowcooker on high for 5 hours and low for 1 hour, adding the mustard and a couple of tablespoons of Traditional Gravox gravy mix to the stew in the last hour, which was very nice. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

Great recipe, we loved it.  The only change I made to it was I sliced a sweet onion and added it to the stew to let it cook all day.  With just two of us in the house we had it for 2 nights (the leftovers were wonderful so flavorful) and I froze the rest for another day. 
Will make this again and again.

I have been using this recipe for years now, and it never disappoints.  I have had to change my ingredients a bit since moving to Greece, as canned Italian-style tomatoes are not available (so I make my own).  I also now use fresh thyme from my herb garden instead of dry.  But the recipe is excellent as is!  Love it!

This is a super recipe! Very delicious and tangy. The addition of the mustard makes all the difference. My only complaint would be that because the flour is added at the very beginning, the resulting thickened stew has a tendency to burn over the required hour of cooking. As a result of having to stir frequently to avoid this, the beef wasn't as tender as I would have liked. I think I saw in someone's earlier review that they transfered the stew into a crockpot and finished it there. That would solve the problem, but, of course, add cooking time. Perhaps next time I'll omit the flour until the very end.

Tasty beef stew recipe, and I don't particularly like beef stew. I would recommend marinating the beef though. The stew has nice flavors but if you get a larger piece of beef then beef flavor just overwhelms everything in your mouth, granted the beef was super tender, and if you like the taste of beef then that's probably a good thing. Perhaps a marinade with dijon mustard playing a major role to get a bit more of that flavor incorporated into the dish.

An easy to make stew that tastes great - even more so when reheated. I used bison (rather than beef) and added 1/3 cup Italian dressing and 1 tsp red pepper. This will be a winter staple here in Wisconsin.

So tasty and so easy. I added mushrooms and celery; I am sure you could add whatever you have on hand. I used a little more Dijon than called for and skipped the salt.

Made this tonight with a couple changes. My family thought it was good but not great. The changes I made - I didn't drain the tomatoes but I reduced the broth slightly, I added minced garlic, minced onion and Italian seasonings. I also left out the mustard at the end and made garlic bread with a chef salad. It was a decent Italian style meal.

Mad it exactly how it said except skipped the mustard because when I tasted it at the end, I couldn't imagine risking ruining it with mustard. SO satisfied!! My hubby absolutely loved it!

I don't like beef stew. But it is a great "warm and hearty" winter meal...so I was determined to find a beef stew I liked. I finally did! My husband loves beef stew and was always upset that I wouldn't make it for him. He loved this! (This is also the first time I enjoyed eating cooked carrots!) The thyme/dijon blend is superb!

everybody really enjoyed this. my fiance went for seconds, which is always a good sign. i did have to add a 2nd can of beef broth (or else there isn't enough liquid to simmer in) & 2 garlic cloves (minced). besides that it came out great... the reason i gave it 4 stars is because the dijon gave it strange smell... i think i was the only one that noticed though. thanks for sharing.

VERY frustrating to find reviews based on changes they had made to the original recipe. As other reviewers stated this was very DISAPPOINTING--needed to cook the beef 2 hrs. for tenderness, potatoes were mushy, and the dijon overpowering.

This was wonderful on a cold and rainy night. The only thing I changed was I added some more potatoes for the kiddos. We all loved it with crusty french bread! The kids were worried that the meat would be chewy, but it was soft enough for their little teeth. Thanks!

I added some onion and red pepper and the stew was so flavorful that I didn't need to add the mustard. I found the serving sizes were small for a regular family. I cooked for 3 but ended up with 2 small serving sizes. Either double the amount or serve a side dish with this!

This was really very good, my husband loved it and it was very easy to make. I had to make a few changes though, because for whatever reason my broth didn't thicken. I made a roux and added it to the stew and then let it cook for a while longer. I also only added 1 tbsp of dijon mustard to it because my husband wouldn't have liked it if it tasted too different. But the dijon made a big difference! It really added a depth to the broth. It took longer than an hour to cook for me too, probably an hour and a half. I served it in a bread bowl which was amazing!  I would definitely make this again, especially because you can wing it with this recipe and play around with veggies etc.

This was sooooo good!  It was ready and waiting for me when I got home from work and I have to say that the beef was so incredibly tender.  My husband said it was very easy to make, so all you ladies out there - give this one to the men to make and take the night off from cooking!

Outstanding. Perfect tang. I deglazed with wine, as others suggested. I thought the stew was going to need onions, but alas, it was perfect without. My picky kids cleaned their bowls and asked for more.

Fantastic! I did have only 1 Can of diced Italian Style Tomatoes and I added 2 little Cans of Mushrooms, also some Adobo Seasoning instead of Salt. I did add some Corn Starch to make it thicken up a little more since it was too soupy for my Taste. The Dijon really makes all the Difference in this Dish. I also added a little bit of Horseradish. Will definitely make this regularly!

I took this to work and got many complements. They said to bring more anytime.  Great comfort food with a nice flavor.  I made a few changes due to personal preference: I reduced 1 carrot, added an extra potato, 1 pk. of Lipton dry onion soup and about 2/3 Cup extra beef broth.  Browned the meat on the stove and once the other ingredients were added I transferred it to the crock pot.  Cooked on low for about 8 hours.

Great flavor; the mustard gives this stew a wonderfully interesting taste.  My boyfriend is usually a bit picky so I was a little nervous about serving this, but he quickly declared this the best beef stew I've ever made.  I did change the recipes slightly, only adding about half the mustard called for.  I also sauteed in a sliced shallot and a clove of minced garlic with the beef, then deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of dry red wine. I tripled the cook time as well. This is definitely one to try!  I'll be making it alot more!

The picture with this recipe is gross. My apologies to whoever submitted the picture -- but it should be pulled. This is a great stew recipe.  The beef broth, tomatoes, and dijon mustard is an excellent flavor combination. I added some onion and celery, but definitely was not necessary.  This will be my stew recipe from now on.  The day after I served it my husband asked for the leftovers for dinner.  It was even better the second day.

This is going to be my beef stew recipe from now on...  Great flavor!  Here are the tweaks:  I added 2C mushrooms, 2 celery ribs, used 2 ea. of yukon gold and red potatoes, 1 red onion, substituted the dijon mustard for about 1t of dry mustard instead (my husband HATES mustard, but can tolerate dry mustard) 1T worchestershire sauce, French Onion soup mix, deglazed the pan which browned the meat with approximately 1/2C red wine which was added to the stew.  I cooked in the crockpot for 8 hours on low... and came home to a fabulous stew!  I think next time I will increase the amount of potatoes and mushrooms as there was still room in my crockpot.  Delicious!!!!

Overall I think it was alright, but my family didn't care for it at all.  I should have taked the advice of the other reviewers and only used one can of tomatoes.  It turned out bland and watery.

This came out alright. I did add some sauted onion and garlic, also, I didn't have fresh carrots so I added a small can of carrots and of green beans the last few minutes of cooking. The mustard does add a nice flavor though. I think this needs to simmer longer than an hour...my meat came out pretty dry.

I really didn't like this recipe and neither did my husband.  The thyme ruined the flavor completely for me.  I also don't understand the point of flouring and browning the meat - it didn't seem to add any flavor and all the flour came off the meat when the stew cooked and I had lots of little bits of flour stuff in the stew which was yucky.  There is also way too much tomato in this recipe for me.  The one thing I liked (quite suprisingly too) was the dijon mustard in it - it added a wonderful flavor, which is why I give this two stars instead of one - I will try using that again with a different stew recipe.

Excellent stew, though I half the mustard. The first time I made it the dijon overpowered the rest of the flavors. A stick to your ribs kind of meal. Yum!

This recipe was DELICIOUS and easy.  The only thing I did differently was after browning the meat, I put all the ingredients in a crockpot and let it simmer all afternoon.

I added 1 tsp. italian seasoning,1/2 tsp. basil, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, pepper to taste, oregano, minced garlic, bay leaf,green onions and celery. I simmered the stew for 3-4 hours, then added the potatoes and carrots and simmered for 1 1/2 hours more. The longer it cooks brings all the flavors together.

Maybe I did something wrong, but it was so sour from the mustard (Grey Poupon) I could barely stand it, and I am not a picky eater.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2 lbs stew beef.  My husband thought it was good, but I definitely won't be making it again.

I loved this recipe.  It was very easy and very, very tasty.  I made it in a crockpot just because I didn't have time to make it after work, it worked out fine and like I said tasted great. My husband loved it too. You did need to thicken it up with cornstarch. I will definitely make this again, a great winter meal!

This was really tasty!  I deglazed the pan with port wine (it was handy!), and added green beans in the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  I cooked it for 1.5 hours and the meat was very tender.  Lots of left over gravy, I think I will bump up the meat to 2# next time, and add double the potatoes and carrots.  I used my homemade beef bone broth in this, really made for a robust gravy.  Super meal for the sub-zero weather we're having right now.

Served this tonight with fresh out of the oven home-made pain de campagne and my family swooned over it. That is, grown man, control freak 5 year old and finnicky toddler...and I confess, my puppy liked it too. As always we have our own variations, and I added 2/3 cups of red wine to the mix (in between steps two and three) and dialed down the tomatoes...I only had three fresh roma tomatoes at hand, so I went with it. I also let it simmer on super low for about two hours. All in all, my husband says its the best thing I ever made. Thanks Corwynn!

Loved this pretty much as is! Found it flavorful and my husband and I both liked it. You can taste the mustard so if you don't like mustard this might not be for you. The only things I changed was I used diced tomatoes that were flavored with rosemary and oregano. And I halved the recipe because I didn't have that much meat, but wasn't sure exactly how many lbs it was so ended up adding a tiny bit more mustard and thyme because I thought it might need it. Also cooked it for 40 min instead of an hour because we were starving and the meat was fine, but would have been better after an hour I think.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks. I used 2+ pounds of beef, white yams instead of potatoes, more thyme and cooked it in a 3.5 qt slow cooker on High for 4hrs then scooped out some liquid. I put the veggies in and cooked on high for another 1.5 hrs.

This was very good.  I like especially like the mustard in it.  I added frozen green peas at the end, because I require that in a good beef stew.  I also only added 1 can of tomatoes and added a little more broth.  I would say the cooking time for tender beef would be about 1 1/2-2 hours.

Love it. No other words needed. only thing i add is onions, extra potatoes (yukon gold), extra carrots some celary fresh garlic and maybe a lettle red wine and FRESH THYME is all you have it. Such a lovely dish .... even without additions. DO NOT SKIP THE THYME OR THE DIJON .... it will ruin the dish.

excellent recipe. I also deglazed the pan with red wine I added alot more garlic (10 cloves five in the beginning and the other five towards the end of the dish) and did not have dijon mustard but used 1 tbls of a polish stone ground mustard that really set this dish off. We are not big meat eaters but this is definetly going on the monthly menu plan. I also used about a tablespoon of fresh thyme instead dried.  Thank you for posting this recipe corwynn darkholme

I changed this recipe quite a bit based on suggestions here, but am still reviewing it so I remember my own changes! I probably used more flour than called for to really coat all the pieces, browned the mean, then used about 1/3 c. red wine to deglaze the pan. Then I added 1 28 oz can of whole tomatoes w/basil (they were in a thick tomato sauce & I just chopped them up in the can, then dumped the whole thing in the pot), 1 cup of water plus 1 1/2 tablespoons beef bullion powder, 3/4 teaspoon thyme, a dash of basil,few shakes of worchestershire, salt, & pepper. Brought it to a boil, then threw in 5 cubed potatoes, a big handful of chopped carrots, & a few sliced mushrooms. Simmered for almost 2 hours - 1 wasn't long enough for my beef.  Result was a thick, tomato-beef flavored stew with some potato cubes still whole, but others had disintegrated to thicken the stew up.  Very tasty & my husband loved it! Forgot to add the mustard, so maybe next time!

Used 2 lbs beef stew meat, 3 tblsp flour, 2 tlbsp olive oil, 1/2 cup good red wine, 1/2 cup mini onions, 1 tlbsp sugar, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 2 bay leaves, pinch of basil. The original recipe is too bland, but using the "most useful" reviews as a guide, the altered recipe is awesome!

I followed the directions but added one onion. We served with french bread, which is a must. The dijon overpowered the flavors and this just wasn't the type of stew I had hoped for.

I have been using this recipe for quite awhile and have always made it exactly as directed.  I am not a huge fan of beef stew but I do like it with the addition of the mustard.  I would suggest adding 1 tablespoon first and trying it though.

Great Stew.  We've made it in the crock pot several times on a Sunday.  Served it with crusty bread and a salad, delightful!

Fabulous!  I have made beef stew many times using many recipes, but this one is a hit.  I coated the beef stew meat with half flour and half masa harina, a little trick from another recipe on this site, Southwestern Chicken Roulade.  I also added garlic powder and Adobo seasoning, which has salt, pepper, and yes, more garlic!  Seared that in the pan, then I removed the meat and put in one sliced onion and sauteed that for a bit before adding sliced mushrooms, which I then sauteed that for a few minutes more before deglazing the pan with some white wine I had left over from the night before.  I put the meat, potatoes, and carrots back in the pot along with the beef broth and 1 can of tomatoes (garlic and onion), and thyme and cooked over low heat for a few hours.  Just before serving, I added green beans and the Dijon mustard and didn't need to add any extra salt and pepper.  This went over very well and no one could taste the Dijon although they admitted it was different than traditional beef stew.  My husband loved the way the meat cooked and I do think the masa harina is what keeps the meat moist on the inside so I will definitely do that again.  Great recipe!

I've made this stew recipe quite a few times before seeing it here on AR - I have to say it's just about my favorite.  But this time I added mushrooms as others had and since I was only using 1 pound of beef stew meat, I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes - not Italian - I did not want the basil/oregano flavors to compete with the Dijon and thyme.  Just added some garlic powder to the flour that coated the meat.  And I simmered for probably 2 hours.  Made this for guests and it was a hit.

I have been making recipe this since 2007. It's a family favorite, with our own spin of course: I load it up with extra vegetables: onions, potatoes, carrots, celery, green beans, peas, and even mushrooms or parsnips from time to time.

Pretty good!  The mustard is a must.  I used cornmeal instead of flour but it was really good.  My three-year-old even liked it.

This stew was great but not at all what I expected.  I had thoughts prior to making it that the Italian style tomatoes may take over the taste due to there being two cans of them in it.  I was right.  I couldn't taste the Dijon at all, even though I put the two tablespoons it called for and was expecting it to be over powering from various other reviews that have made this. I also added mushrooms, carrots, celery and potatoes to make it a little bit hardier.  All and all, it was really good and got great reviews from my boyfriend.

I prepared this in the slow cooker by flouring and browning the meat first then adding it and all the other ingredients into the crockpot and letting it cook on low all day.  I did add minced garlic and additional seasonings and I felt it still needed something upon tasting when it was done cooking.  If I had some I would have added red wine to kick the flavor up a bit.  I will keep this one in the rotation and make a note to add the red wine next time.

This stew is very good. I did alter it basically by only adding the following vegetables. Besides the Italian tomatoes, I added chopped onion and garlic, corn, green beans, peas, carrots and potatoes.  I didn't have the dijon mustard so that wasn't added. I also cooked it for 3 hrs on a low heat so the meat would be very tender and it turned out excellent!  It's one hearty stew during the cold winter days and I feel one way to get all your veggies in, so all in all, pretty healthy too.  By adding all the other ingredients, I ended up with some to freeze for another time.  Thanks for sharing this!

Such a versatile soup to "play" with. Reading the reviews gives such good ideas. It was soo good (and i even forgot the mustard.  Next time, i will add onion and red wine.

Awesome.  The only change I made was to deglaze the pan with some red wine--mostly because I needed an excuse to open a bottle of red wine. ;) I only added 1T of mustard because I wasn't sure how it would taste, but will definitely add more next time.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I followed recipe except I added 2 celery stalks, used 2 lbs of beef, and cooked in crockpot on high for 4  hours.  This was really good and I will make again.  Next time I will only use 1 tablespoon of the dijon mustard; it was just a little to overpowering.

This is such an easy recipe! Made this on a whim and will definitely end up making this again. I added some wostershire and red wine like some others suggested. The mustard adds such a unique flavor. Definitely give this recipe a shot!

To be honest I wasn't at all wild about the taste, but the family seemed to enjoy it well enough, I won't be making this again personally, but it's a good soup recipe anyway, just not my taste.

Very tasty. It did not make 8 servings. My husband and I are "good" eaters, it only made one meal (husband had second helping, which he should not have eaten). Used frozen home grown tomatoes instead of the 2 cans of italian style tom.  I let the liquids cook down a little and it made a more hearty meal. Next time I will fix some sides with it, maybe we can get a second meal out of it.

SO yummy! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used only 1 can of tomatoes, but added 1 onion, a few stalks of celery, a healthy splash of red wine, worchestershire sauce and the full amount of mustard. I simmered it for about 1.5 hours--the meat came out perfectly and the flavor was deliciously complex and layered! The best! I will make this all the time. :)

It was really good, but 1 hour is definitely not long enough. After about 2.5 hrs the vegetables and meat were tender and the stew had marinated long enough to infuse all the flavors. It was actually even better the next couple of days as left overs after it had longer to sit!

Very good indeed. Used whole shallots and fried off with meat. added garlic, green beans, red wine and cooked for almost 2 hours (slow). Added less mustard than suggested as it would have taken away the flavour of the meat and veg. Served with a Bistro Salad and fresh warm Baguette... They ate it ALL up!

This one's a keeper.  I followed some suggestions adding an onion, some celery and 2 TBSP worshershire sauce.  I cut back a tad on the mustard, but still found the flavor incredible.  Easy to make and lots of leftovers to freeze!

I made no changes to the recipe and this stew is great.  Plus its easy to make, you don't have to do to much to have a great stew!  I usually keep it on the stove for a couple of hours (vs one hour).  I always serve it with fresh french bread.  Mmmmm!

So Delicious! The mustard really gives it a unique and yummy kick!! I threw everything in my slow cooker (put a little olive oil on the bottom, put in the meat, sprinkled with flour). Cooked it on low for about 7 hours then stirred in the mustard just before serving! So good!

Followed the recipe.  Mustard added an interesting new twist to it.  I still felt it needed a little more taste so I added 2T worcestershire sauce. It gave it a lot of flavor.  I'll probable use this recipe as a base and see what else I can do with it.

Combined ingredients (including a cheap cut of stew meat) and simmered for 2 hours as suggested by another member. My thought was to simmer for 2hrs so that the meat would be tender. The meat was fantastic- it was very tender! I liked the Italian tomatoes- could really taste their flavor, combined with the salt, pepper, garlic and thyme. Note, however, that the thick-cut carrots survived but the potatoes had dissolved after 2 hours of simmering! I didn't mind this- I thought the potatoes combined with the broth and thickened it nicely. My hubby thought it was terrible, tho, and barely ate his dinner. I will eat the leftovers by myself- there are worst things in the world I suppose. I still give this 4 stars. But next time I will use my head and add the potatoes 20 minutes before the cheap stew meat is done simmering in the "broth/Italian tomato/thick cut carrot/spice" mix.

Very easy, very good.  I love mustard so used the dijon full-strength, and that's what made the soup.  Don't add a thing--why complicate this wonderful simplicity?  ADDED: Since I have added this recipe to my rotation and cook it a lot, I'm giving it 5 stars instead of the original 4.

Fabulous stew - did the recipe as written with the exception of adding 2 cans of mushrooms. Dijon added great 'french' flavor to a wonderful dish - close to 5*.
Update: Did this dish again. Given the fact you can make this stew in a relatively short time AND the fact that the taste (dijon) is so great...this is now a well-deserved 5*.

To die for! I used leftover medium-rare beef from a roast and followed same directions. After browning meat I removed and sautéed onion & 4 garlic cloves, added 1/4 c wine to remove brown bits from bottom, replaced meat after veggies cooked and continued with recipe. Add mustard gradually as dijon has a strong & particular flavour. Deliscious! A keeper!

Loved this w/a few modifications - I added yellow onion, garlic (2 cloves), and sliced fresh mushrooms while browning the beef, and I had to simmer 2 1/2 hours for the meat to get tender. Next time, I would leave it on the stove even longer. It was great with crusty dinner rolls. The dijon flavor is fantastic; don't omit it!

Delicious!  I deglazed the pan with a red wine after the meat browned per other reviewers' suggestion.  I also added two cloves of garlic after adding my veggies and broth.  I also ended up having to add a cup or so of water because it got thick too quickly.  I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow!

Unfortunately, this recipe was not one of my favorites.  I believe amount of mustard detracted from the taste rather than enhancing all the traditional stew flavors.  I may give this another shot using the slow cooker and paring down the mustard.

Hubby gave it a 5, I gave it a 3 so we took the median.  I thought this broth was really tasty but I just didn't like the chunks of tomato.  I added 4 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms and a diced onion to the beef when I was browning it, also added some garlic powder and red wine before simmering.  Definitely serve this with biscuits to sop up the great broth!

Made this stew this afternoon.  Only changes were that I used 2.5 lbs. of stew meat and added 2 chopped onions.  I chopped up 1 pound of carrots, but used 2 Yukon potatoes and the 2 cans of diced tomatoes (which I did not drain - next time I will drain the tomatoes).  I cooked this on low for about 4 hours, and the stock was still very thin so I did add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch diluted in some water, which did thicken up the stock into a gravy.  Although I did add the thyme, I didn't increase the amount, as some others had mentioned they didn't care for that taste.  The dijon mustard did give the stew that extra kick.  Next time I think I will leave out the potatoes, add some crushed garlic and serve the stew over egg noodles.  The aroma was wonderful, the beef was very tender, and the carrots and potatoes still had a bite to them.  I do have leftovers, so I will be interested to see if the flavors change overnight.  This stew is much more flavorful than the recipe that I have that uses condensed golden mushroom soup.  The big plus to this recipe is that when I tested my blood sugar 2 hours later, it was in the low range my endocrinologist expects.

Excellent! I've been making stew for years & wanted to change it up a bit.  This was wonderful! I did add a cup of wine and some grill seasoning to the flour when I browned the beef.  Also added a bay leaf, some chopped garlic and onion and more vegies as we love them. Have a new stew recipe now!

Amazing!  Easy!  A few things I changed... I only browned the beef in a little water- no flour and no oil.  I used the juice from browning in water as my beef broth.  I also used sweet potatoes (NOT yams) instead of regular potatoes, and threw in tons of kale!  Everything was organic too... by the time it was ready for the mustard addition, I took a taste, and it was PERFECTLY YUMMY so I stopped there!  No seasoning at all!  AMAZING and wholesome and incredibly healthy!  :)

I used this recipe as a base and added 1 med. red onion, yellow bell pepper, + bay leaf. About a 1/2 hour before done I put in a 1/4 cup white wine. This is also done well in a slow cooker, altho I had too much liquid so I had to add some tapioca to the mix. Yummy!

My family didn't care for this stew.  I guess it was the tomato and tanginess that turned us off.  We prefer a more traditional beef flavored stew.

"Good" stew with the minimal ingredients. My stew meat took a LOT longer than an hour or so... to tenderize though;closer to 2-1/2 hours. And I slow "BOILED", so unless your stew meat is a lot more tender than mine was... plan on tough meat or more time. I thought the broth needed some more flavor too.  I added onion, celery, garlic, majoram, rosemary, some red wine (boiled alcohol off) and worstershire sauce. Was much better after adding more ingredients. Loved the mustard added at the end.

THIS WAS GREAT!!!  Took the advice of others, cooked the meat for one hour, then added the potatoes and carrots for another 1/2 hour.  I also added mushrooms and onions with the carrots and potatoes.  I used the entire can of beef broth and added 1 cup of Merlot.  This is by far the best beef stew I have ever eaten, and coming from the midwest-that says a lot.

ah, the difference a day makes! this recipe had all the markings of being a great stew but i needed to make it for the following evening. i was impressed how the flavors came together! after reading the many reviews, i tailored this recipe to have 1/2 cup red wine (in exchange for the same amount of juice from the diced tomatoes). i also added a 1/2 cup of both chopped onion & sliced mushrooms. final note: by reading the previous comments i was very aware that my beef may come out as tender as desired. the simple remedy is to simmer the beef & basic stew ingredients (without the potatoes, carrots or mushrooms) a solid hour or more ahead then adding these veggies. this method definately allowed for the flavors to come together. mmmm, what a wonderful dish! thank you, corwynn!

My husband hates tomatoes, but by the time it was done cooking, they are pretty much melted, only leaving the flavor.  He loved it!  (And wouldn't get off the couch for an hour!)

My husband said it was ok, but I couldn't eat it.  It had a sour flavor and unappetizing color.  My family has owned a butcher shop for 50 years, so I'm used to great meat dishes.  I'm afraid this one won't be added to my collection, sorry.

It was good.  I thought it was a little too spicy, I would have probably liked it better with different tomatoes (not italian).

This is a great alternative to a stew that generally takes double the cooking time.  The mustard at the end it a great touch.

I took a taste before the required cooking time was up, and wasn't thrilled with a certain "spice" taste that I couldn't identify.  However, by the time it was finished cooking, it was sensational.

Excellent!  We did make some adds like Onion and Parsnips, added two more potatoes (ours were small), and cut back on the Djion mustard to three Tsp.  We let it simmer for an hour and thirty minutes because we had the time.  This is a great recipe and one we will turn to again, adding some more Djion next time around.  Thanks for this excellent dish!

Very Delicious recipe! However, 1 Hour is definitely not enough time if you want super soft meat and potatoes.  I browned the beef first in a pan then put all of the ingredients in my crockpot and let it cook on high for 1 hour then on low for 4 hours.  I added the mustard at the end just before serving it.  My family and I LOVED the flavors!

Outstanding!  Made this to eat after a day of hiking in the cold, was perfect.  Thought the mustard sounded very strange so just put it on the table to let people add a bit to their bowl if they wanted and everyone agreed it made it even more delicious and that I should definitely just add it next time.  I didn't make any changes except for adding a bag of frozen peas.  It did take a bit longer than an hour to cook down though.  Will definitely be making this a winter staple!!!

It's been a while since I made this recipe, but I remember that it was fantastic. It's similar enough to the beef stew I grew up eating to still have a 'comfort food' feel, yet has enough of it's own flair to not just be the same old thing.

Just reiterating a previous comment: I have made this stew many times. My family loves it. I don't make many changes. I add a little red wine, onions, and garlic, I use Kitchen Basics beef stock. Thanks Corwynn. This is a staple in my home. I make it at least once a month.

This is one great stew. I discovered the recipe years ago, and it has been my go-to beef stew recipe ever since. I generally make it as stated, the only changes are that I use fire-roasted tomatoes instead - I love the slightly smokey flavor they add to the stew, and that I use half butter, half oil to brown the meat. To make it healthier (=smuggle in more vegetables for my picky son to eat), I add more vegetables, depending on what's in season. I found that green beens and mushrooms make a perfect addition to this. I also love the flavor the mustard gives to it. If you like it a bit on the spicy notes, add a finely chopped up hot pepper, that gives it another nice twist. The best thing about this is how easy and quick it is. Plus, my very picky son loves this stew as well, despite all the veggies in it.

Outstanding.  Put a big smile on the wife's face!!!   Used very precisely trimmed venison, salt n pepper flour sautéed in olive oil with fresh garlic cloves.  Be careful to not over cook.  Added small amount of bay leaf, thyme, red wine and oregano.    Also added mushrooms.   Forgive me but had to put a southern twist and serve over rice.

Very simple, tasty recipe. I added slices mushrooms, large sliced sweet onion, and some fresh garlic cloves. After frying the beef, I deglazed the pan with red wine (cab sav). Also, I used fresh thyme. Easy to customize, I recommend it!

Loved it!  I added onion and garlic to cook with the beef and then used parsnips instead of potatoes.  Some times I do add a Tablespoon of sugar if the tomatoes make it too acidic.

This was a nice change of pace from the stew I usually make. We realy enjoyed how the dijon gave it a nice tang. The beef wasn't as tender as I normally like. To fix that problem, next time I will simmer the beef with the tomatoes and beef broth for an hour, then add the potatoes and carrots and simmer for another hour, or until the vegetables are done. I was out of thyme, so I used savory instead and it worked really well. I also threw in a chopped onion and ended up using about 3 teaspoons of dijon instead of the 2 tablespoons.

Great, Ive never had stew with dijon in it before, but it does add a nice tang. I ended up letting it simmer for about 3hours, only because I had the time and it was cold. I also subbed baby carrots because I had them.

This is a delicious stew. I've made it twice. The first time I made it exactly as it appears.  The second time I added cut green beans instead of celery only because i did't have celery and I added about a tablespoon or so of worcestershire sauce. Wonderful both ways!

DELICIOUS!  I used fresh tomatoes because I needed to use them up, added half an onion because I also needed to use it up, and deglazed with 1/2 cup white wine and 1 TBS worcestshire.  Crock pot for about 8 hrs on low and it was great!  Be sure to check the seasoning at the end.  Once I adjusted the flavors, I thought it was amazing!  Great stew recipe!

Husband is hooked on this recipe. He is not much of a beef stew lover but he loved this one! two changes I made: red wine instead of water, added about 1/2 c. of salsa to add flavor to tomatoes.

Very, very tasty.  I cooked this in the slow cooker and the only thing I changed to the ingredients was to add a few left over veggies that I had in my fridge - leek, red onion and some celery.  Served with some dumplings.  Will be making this again - hopefully it will freeze well!

Good! I found a recipe for a dijon mustard substitute online. It didn't overpower the soup, but gave it a nice little "thang".  Dijon Mustard  1 tablespoon dry mustard 1 teaspoon water 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar -- (or 1/2 white wine, 1/2 white vinegar 1 tablespoon mayonnaise pinch sugar  Mix all ingredients. Yield - 2 Tbsp.

I cannot say enough good things about this stew!!! It is fantastic everyone including the toddlers in our house loved it! I made it as a 24 serving batch using only 5 cans of tomatoes and 5 cups of broth with about 10 potatoes and 8 carrots. It is a good thing I made so much because everyone wanted more and 9 people wiped it all out. I have had to write this recipe 3 times already tonight. Thanks for the Wonderful recipe

This is such a simple and easy recipe and the only modification I made was to add glugs of red wine (I added a whole lot!) to help tenderize the meat and also gave it some wonderful flavor. It was the first beef stew I made that didn't taste tough or bland. just perfect!

Made this this evening for my husband who is not at all a fan of mustard!  The mustard makes all the difference in the flavor!  My husband gave it a thumbs up and said "this one is a keeper!"

I have made this stew two times..... the first time I didn't review it so I really had forgotten the problems that I had had until I was reminded the second time.  One of the main problems was the stew meat which MUST cook for quite a while before it's edible.  So while it's cooking away the potatoes are turning to mush and eventually disappearing (even though I quartered them this time, hoping that they'd retain some sort of presence in the stew).  But despite this problem, which is mainly my fault (I'll never use stew meat again!) I'm still not crazy about the taste.  The mustard does lend a unique flavor but the end result is just not what I consider to be "stew."  I won't be making this a third time.
EDIT:  I had leftovers of this today and they were good! I still don't think I'll make this stew again, but I'm changing my 3 stars to 4.  If you're going to try to make this, I'd definitely suggest using a better cut of meat than "stew meat."

I made this for dinner tonight and served it with lavender biscuits. It was really good, and I will make something very similar again. I really liked the Dijon mustard; it added a subtle tang which was really nice.

My alterations - I added some Herbs de Provence for extra flavor, I used a mix of different colored carrots, and I added some frozen peas near the end of cooking for a little bit of green. Next time I'll use plain canned tomatoes and chop my own garlic and onion instead of using the Italian style; the oregano in them was too dominant. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

We really enjoyed this recipe, although I found the sauce/gravy a little runny and too plentiful.  I used baby potatoes and added onion and garlic.  I would add more meat next time.  The mustard is a definite plus and I added a huge wallop of it!  Yum!

This turned out pretty good.  The meat was very tender.  I kept it on simmer for a couple of hours.  Some might want to go easy on the dijon mustard because it is strong.

WOW, this is the best beef stew I've ever had.  The only thing I did different was dissolved a beef boullion cube in 1 3/4 c water because I didn't have beef broth on hand.  But followed the rest and the results were fabulous...smells awsome.

Browned then cooked in a Crockpot. This recipe is Perfect. I wanted something "different" then the stew I have made for years but also easy. This was both! I added some curry and ginger (took the idea from another recipe on this site), honey, and 2 Tbsp. Vinegar.  skipped the veggies and served with bread sticks. It was GOOD!

This is a very good stew. I love the flavors.  I did only use one can of tomatoes, as I knew the kid would complain and he did with just one can.  I also did not have dijon, but substituted spicey brown mustard, I only did 1tbs.  I did as directed and all in one pan put on lid and let set for a hour and dinner.  ***I am thinking this recipe would be good over rice, leave out the potatoes and add onions, cabbage or other veggies.. new dish.

Easy to make! You can add any sort of vegetables you like, although I do think the potatoes play an important part. It was a bit salty for me though- I used regular diced tomatoes. Also added 1/2 tbspn chili powder, 2 tbspn Worcestershire sauce, 1 tbspn of parsley (in lieu of thyme) and 2 tbspn of garlic for an extra kick.

After browning the meat, I made this in the crockpot.  Unfortunately the vegetables took much longer than 1 1/2 hrs. to cook.  Next time I will add them earlier.  The stew was tasty.  I added mustard to my serving, but most of my guests chose not to try it with the mustard.  I also pureed the diced tomatoes because my family doesn't care for big tomato chunks in prepared dishes.  I think this is a good base recipe and can be easily adjusted to your family's tastes.

my favorite beef stew recipe. I've used spicy brown mustard and canned fire-roasted  tomatoes - this stew is full of flavor - brown the meat and let simmer in the crockpot for 5 hrs

This was incredible -- I do like the dijon flavor, so I added more to my bowl.

I eyeballed most of the ingredients, added more carrots and potatoes, only one can of tomatoes, and I think next time I'll either zap them in the food processor or just use tomato juice.  They added great flavor, but weren't very attractive swimming in the brown broth.  I added onion (I add onion to everything) and celery and green beans (all personal preferences--I like a lot of veggies) and by the time I was done, I probably had close to double the original recipe yield, and added mustard a tbsp at a time tasting after each.  I stopped at 3.  Definately add it slowly to your own tastes.  Used a bit of cornstarch to thicken, cause I had it in the crock and it seems like things don't thicken right in there, and I have saved out a bowl for my mom and MIL, and my 2 yr old loved it.  The mustard is brilliant.  I'm used to the 'traditional' beef stew, so it took my tastebuds a minute to adjust, but wow was it good!  This might just replace my regular beef stew, if it gets hubby's approval. (I had to eat without him tonight.  Couldn't wait!)  And even if not, you'll see me mixing mustard into my bowl!

I use 2-2 1/2 lbs of stew meat - and add garlic powder/salt/pepper to the flour(I use about 3/4 cup flour.)  After browning the meat I add 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes w/juice, 2 cans beef broth, about 1/2 cup burgandy wine, and leave it to simmer while I get the potatoes and carrots ready.  I dice 4-6 potatoes (depending on size)and use most of a bag of petite baby carrots -that I generally leave whole.  I put the potatoes and carrots into a 5 quart crockpot and pour the beef mixture in - stirring everything together.  I cook on low for 8-10 hours.  I add about 2 Tbls of Grey Poupon Mild & Creamy mustard 1/2 hour before I'm ready to serve. 
I've been making this recipe for a couple of years - and always get lots of compliments on it.  We love it as much the 2nd and 3rd day as the 1st.  I made this for a family birthday - about 20 guests - and everyone raved about it.  I took garlic powder along so people could add it to their taste.

I've always found stew very bland, but this one is great.  Added some shallots and celery, put it in my dutch oven and cooked for 8 hours at 225.  Put in fridge overnight and warmed the next day. Forgot to add the dijon but excellent without it.  Will try with mustard next time.

This was really great - this is a keeper - I did make changes but I think that is natural with stews.  I ended up doubling the amount of beef, hence I added another can of tomoatoes and beef soup, always use a Bay leaf or two, large chunks of onions and then had to add some red wine.  I also added a mixture of corn starch and water to thicken the gravy.  All in all I did stay pretty true to the recipe and I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Absolutely fantastic! I followed the advice of others by flouring the meat and adding red wine. It was the first stew I had ever made and it is so yummy! The Dijon mustrad adds the perfect tang...

Everyone in my family loved this recipe, but there was a flavour in it that just didn't sit well with me.  I think maybe it was the dijon...perhaps I used too much.  Rave reviews from everyone else though!

This really is something different and very delicious.  Used only one can of tomatoes, red wine to deglaze pan and omitted the potatoes (I find they don't freeze well).  The mustard adds such flavor and puts this stew in a class of its own.  Thankyou for submitting this recipe.

Corwynn does it again. I used a non-stick pot, I put the stew meat in it and salt,pepper,chili,onion,garlic powder, thyme and a pinch of cumin. Then I put the flour on top of meat and seasonings and stirred it and then turn stove on, added 12oz water, 2 bouillon cubes and tomatoes and 1 potato. Brought to a boil, reduce heat, covered and simmered for 2 hours. added mustard and 1 can of mixed veggies. Excellent!! Next time I'll make a heck of a lot more.

I used the cheapest cut of meat I could find and cut into cubes myself.  Browned
the meat with onion and garlic; added more spices and lots more veggies and red wine.
Cooked the meat for an hour before adding the veggies and it is melt in your mouth tender.

Pretty good stew.  I added a few things to the recipe.  In the flour mixture; I added Basil, Bay Leaves, Thyme, and Rosemary.  I also let the meat simmer on low-heat for 30 minutes after it had browned.  I did not add any juice from the canned diced tomatoes.  I added 1/2 of the beef broth and added 1/2 cup of White Wine.  I also added fresh mushrooms, finely chopped fresh garlic, and half a small onion.  I changed the servings to 7, but it only fed 2 servings with a little leftover for my husband to take to lunch tomorrow.  We ate this with garlic bread and the combination of the two made for a delicous dinner.  I will make this recipe again.  Next time I'll increase the servings so that we have more leftover.

This stew is great! This was the first stew I made and it was very simple and chose it because it did not have a huge list of ingredients or complicated steps. The changes I made-- did not dredge the beef in flour, but added cornstarch an hour in to thicken sauce; browned meat with onion and garlic; did not have thyme but added rosemary; also simmered for 90 min, meat turned out very tender and came apart with fork. I will definitly make this again, and probably try out more vegetables!

This was very good, but we came to the consensus that it would be better with the dijon cut in half, it was very overpowering, then it would be five stars.

What a wonderful recipe!  I only modified it because of what I had on hand.  I followed an earlier reviewer's advice and dredged the meat in flour with some garlic powder in it.  YUM! Even my picky daughter who responded "I hate STEW!" ate it ALL up!

Don't count on the minimum hour time cooking. If your stew meat is tender in an hour I want to know where you get your meat!

Otherwise, an excellent dish...don't leave out the mustard!

Great stew that can be adapted to personal preferences.  I followed others suggestions and added mushrooms, onion, celery and wine.  I also halved the mustard because I have found dijon to be a little overwhelming in other recipes on this website.  Thanks for sharing!

I only added one 14.5 can of Contadina Italian Herbs diced tomatoes, and added more beef broth and water to make up for the loss liquid.  Also added 1/2 chopped onion and green beans.  I bet that mushrooms would be very good here, but I don't enjoy them.  Dijon mustard is a must.  I also cooked the meat in the beef and tomato broth for an hour or more before I added the vegatables.

This is an awesome recipe.  Definately a keeper.  As advised by others, I also added mushrooms, onion, red wine and garlic.  I added the vegatables after the first half hour and then simmered for another hour.  It is the best beef stew I've ever had.  Thanks!

After viewing other readers' posts, I also added 1/2 cup onion, and waited an hour to add the carrots and potatoes (then cooked everything an additional 1/2 hour). I had friends over the night I made this, and they all RAVED about it. This was my first attempt at a beef stew, and it was a winner. Thank you for sharing!

This was the best thing I have ever made, according to my husband and myself! I added in some red wine, 1/2 cup of mushrooms, and 1/2 an onion. It is so good I am eating the leftovers today!

EXCELLENT FLAVOR! Used tenderized lean stew meat and that really lends to a more tender beef. Left out potatoes only because I didn't have any (they would've been good). Followed another reviewers suggestion and substituted 1/2 cup red wine for half of the broth and was pleased with the result. Added 1/2 chopped onion and 1/2 cup diced fresh mushrooms. Next time I make this with potatoes, I'll do what others have done and simmer meat for 1 hour and THEN put in potatoes and simmer for another 30 minutes so that it doesn't all turn to mush! I also added some garlic powder and Cavenders to the flour before tossing. The Dijon mustard is key! Don't leave it out! Just great! Thanks for the post!

This is very tasty and very easy. We made this for our cook-off at work and came in first. I added celery to make it look pretty but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. My family were the testers (they are very fussy) and they loved it! I definetly recommend it.

This stew was delicious!  My husband doesn't even like stew, and he loved this.  The liquid part was so tasty -- the mustard is a great addition.  I used pre-cooked meatballs, chopped up, and a can of sliced carrots.

This recipe is soooooo good.  Like others I use chicken tenderloin.  I add more garlic powder to the dredging mix to give a little more flavor.  Also to get a nice breading on the chicken you need to dredge, dip back in the marinade and then dredge again.   Then let the chicken rest for about 15 minutes to allow the breading to adhere to the chicken better.

This was really, really good!!
I added a few things:
Worchester sauce - a splash
Red wine - a splash
Extra mustard and one onion.
And some tapioca for thickening.
It was great!!!  We ate sooo much we had to lay down.

I know that everyone seems to just love this recipe, but I didn't really care for it.  It smelled better than it tasted.  I thought it was a little bland.  My boyfriend (the least picky eater I have ever met) said it was good, but he didn't rave over it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh tomatos rather than canned ones.  I thought that would make it better, but maybe that was the problem.  I doubt I'll do it again.  It was hearty and very filling though.

This is a great beef stew recipe, very quick compared to many others.  It was thick and hearty.  I added one can (drained) of green beans at the end of cooking (so they won't turn to mush) for more color.  I love the twang that the mustard gives this stew.  I will make this again and again.

added onion before/while browning the meat as per another suggestion, added whole grain mustard in addition to the dijon at the end, white (not russet) potatoes, kept the skin on the carrots, just scrubbed em real good. Turned out GREAT!

I made this last winter. Absolutely delicious! I just threw everything into my crockpot and put it on high for about 4 hours.

I love this recipe and have probably made it ten times since finding it.  The first time I followed it exactly and it was very good.  Since then I’ve tweaked it.  I add an onion, etc.  And since discovering I’m insulin resistant and going low carb I’ve omitted the potatoes-  if anyone can think of a lower carb substitute that would help thicken it please let me know!  This recipe is delicious, easy and can be changed as you like-  perfect!

Wonderful!  Only change that I made was that I used corn starch instead of flour.  Also,  made some cornbread to go along with the stew.  An excellent meal on a cold winter night!!!  Genuine comfort food!!!

A flavorful beef stew. Made "as-is", it's alright. I think the mustard is a bit too strong. This is how I would personally change the recipe in the future: slightly brown some diced onion in a skillet to add in with the rest of the ingredients after the meat is finished browning, use half as much mustard, and add a little more thyme. Adding the potatoes and carrots 15 minutes after the heat is reduced resulted in soft potatoes but perfect carrots, I might let it simmer for 20-25 minutes before adding them in the future. After this changes, I'd give the recipe another star for sure!

This was easy to make. I had to adjust the cooking time for the meat to be tender the way I like. I simmered the stew meat an additional 45 minutes and then added the potatoes and carrots.

I made this recipe pretty much as is but doubled all ingredients as I'm feeding a largeish family.

I feel I want to add less mustard next time though.

Very good recipe, would make again :)

Very tasty! Added garlic, turnip (1/2 turnip, 1/2 potato), acorn squash and rosemary. The tomato gave it a bit of tangy acidity that hit the spot. Making it again three days later.

Not our favorite ... we both rated it just ok.  Followed the recipe as it was, other than adding an onion and a little red wine to deglaze.  Timing was way off for me.  I browned the meat and added everything else except potatoes and carrots, and allowed that to simmer all afternoon ... about 5 hours.  Tasted after an hour just to see, and stew meat was way too chewy ... was much better after 5 hours!  Added the potatoes and carrots an hour before we planned to eat, and they were nowhere near done ... cooked another 45 minutes or so, and they were soft enough to eat, but nowhere near mushy.  Will look for another beef stew recipe next time we get the urge.

Being a vegetarian cook it is very challenging cooking meals I cannot taste. I followed the recipe. Added onion, Worcestershire sauce, used wheat+gluten free all purpose flour and  Italian herbs. I had to cook it for 1h 30m. My man said it was one of the best meals I have ever made for him:D I love that it is easy and quick to make. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed recipe but added minced garlic, celery and fresh  brussel sprouts to the stew.  I didn't have the canned tomatoes but did have Roto-Tel, so I used that and eliminated the mustard.  It was spicy and delicious.  My husband loved it.  Next time I will try the recipe as written, but may also add veggies that I think enhance the stew effect.

I made some changes, but the base recipe was the same. I tossed my grass fed stew meat in gluten free all purpose flour, some garlic and pepper seasoning  and some dried parsley. I browned it in cast iron pot with onion slices and some oil. Once it was brown and the bottom of the pan was nice and chunky i deglazed it with about a cup of Cabernet. Then I added a whole box of beef broth (32 oz), the 2 cans of diced tomatoes Italian style, chopped carrots, celery, and red potatoes (skin on) cubed. I also added the thyme and a splash of worcestershire sauce and let it simmer for a while. Near the end I threw in some frozen corn and frozen peas because I wanted more colors in there and of course the Dijon mustard. So many people said don't leave out the mustard so I listened and I'm glad I did. The flavor was amazing and even with all the broth I used the consistency was perfect. I tend not to measure things and just go by what I have on hand so I hope I can recreate it. Even my picky neighbor loved it. I'm only giving 4 stars because I changed it a bit. I don't know what it would be like made as is. Maybe I'll try that and update the review.

I made the recipe as posted, and it is very good. I am still not sure how I feel about the Thyme in it. Maybe next time I will use less and see  how I like it. I am just not a fan of thyme being so predominant.  I will make it again and appreciate the original cook sharing it with us!

Delish. And a great recipe for beginners. I used the recipe from a review. I substituted the baby onion for minced red onion and I used fresh thyme. The wine addition really made the stew.

My husband is English. I am Italian. We both grew up eating beef stew and over the years I have tried a few different recipes seeking the 'perfect one.' It was great- we both loved it and are so happy we found a keeper that satisfies us both! The only change I made was that I added 3 stalks of celery, chopped, and finished it on low in the oven. Use quality ingredients if possible and be sure to taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly. Will not be looking for another stew recipe ever again! :)

It's not done yet but tastes great and smells delish!  I see that I may have to use paper towels in an hour or so to soak up grease (bad call on the meat I bought).  I just threw some Herbs de Provence in the flour and added more instead of thyme, because honestly, it seemed more French.  Also based on reviews, I threw in some garlic first in to the oil then browned the beef, removed beef and added a cup of red wine to deglaze - seriously I had never "deglazed" before and was desperate to try it....and I had lots of deglazing to do!  Then added the beef broth and tomatoes, tossed the meat back in, the carrots & potatoes....threw in a bay leaf because I have them and shouldn't you always add a bay leaf if you have them??  More herbs de provence because my Dutch Oven seemed full, S&P and then I measured 1 TBS of Worshestire because I like it.  And I was drinking the bottle of red wine while cooking and was wearing an apron and it seemed like the thing to do.....  :)

Wow!  This is an amazing recipe!  I used gluten free flour and browned the meat prior to placing all ingredients in the crockpot. Cooked for one hour on high, then six more on low.  Meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender and sauce was divine.

Followed it down to the mustard. My wife is allergic to Dijon so I added 1 tbsp of regular mustard and a shake or two of worcestershire. The meat was tender at the one hour mark for me so I did not run into the same problems with time as some of the other posters. Along with the stew I grilled up a couple of my rendition of Panera Fontina sandwiches and enjoyed a hearty meal on an uncharacteristic snowy night in southern Virginia. We both loved it and will be doing it again.

I made this tonight because we here in Texas were experiencing another 'severe cold-weather storm,' so it seemed the best recipe for such shocking cold (to us Southerners). With a family of 7 to feed, I doubled the recipe and as it cooked I went about my routine of unwinding. When it was done, I told the husband and 5 teenagers to grab a bowl and I would be in shortly. HUGE mistake. When I made it to the kitchen, approximately 12 minutes later, my 20 year-old was on his second bowl and hubby was on the way to his. I had one bowl. ONE BOWL. It was superb, but not nearly enough for my disrespectful family; next time I will triple it. The only thing I did differently than what the recipe called for was add herbs de province. Delicious and warming and most definitely a keeper. Every one of the family members raved, which is a rare thing. :)

I did toss the cubes of beef in a mix of flour, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Didn't put the veggies in yet and cooked for an hr. Then I added all the veggies plus onion and celery plus bay leaves. Cooked that for another hr and also added a corn starch slurry to thicken it. Very good!!

I've made this a few times and it's always a big hit.  The only addition I make is about 2 tbs of tomato paste because I use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, juice and all.

Excellent recipe and easy.  I just realized I forgot to add the mustard, in the end....next time.  I also had to substitute chicken broth for the beef and I added some mushrooms. Very tasty and easy.  I coated the beef with flour as written and browned in vegetable oil before throwing everything in the crock pot as other reviewers suggested.  Then cooked about 8 hours on low.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was alright. We ate it all, but be careful adding the mustard. Work up to the full amount, tasting as you go and don't add it all at once. As far as stews go it had simplicity of ingredients on its side, but I wouldn't consider making this for company.

The beef was great, however I found the broth to be extremely lacking in flavor. I could taste the mustard, but there really was no 'body'. It might be due to the fact that I did *not* drain the cans of Italian diced tomatoes. If I try the recipe again, I will be sure to do this.

This was delicious! I made it the day before and hen when I reheated it the next night i added the mustard, which added a nice zing but didn't overpower. When my husband read the recipe he asked me not to put all the mustard in, but I did and he didn't even notice. Porbbaly the first stew recipe to turn out and I will definitely make again.

i'm not the biggest fan of stew but this was pretty ok.
i added some celery, onion and mushrooms to it (if i made it again i'd probably cook the mushrooms first as they had a gummy texture just thrown in there).
i didn't think that the dijon mustard really added that much to it either.
also, a couple of people in my family felt that it was a little too tomatoey.

I really like this stew, fast and easy. I used more potatos, one can of diced tomatos, and some oragano, season salt, and onion powder. Husband liked it enough to take left overs to work, so I will make this again!

I didn't think the Dijon mustard had much flavor, so I added a generous dollop of Coleman's English mustard, which is quite hot and tangy. I also threw in a thickly sliced onion (you can't have stew without onion, imo). I simmered the stew on low for about 2.5 hours. This was good but I will probably stick to my beef/mushroom/shallot/red wine stew recipe.

This stew is wonderful and easy to make.  I have made it several times and passed it on to friends.  The carrots develop a great flavor so definitely don't leave them out. The dijon mustard is the key ingredient!

Fabulous! It's a cold weather staple in my home -even better the day after. I usually add a little burgundy to it.

I did like this recipe but I have had better so I only gave it four stars. I think I just like making beef stew with leftover roast meat because it is more tender.

I thought this was very tasty, especially with the crusty bread as suggested.  My husband thought it was pretty good, so that's why 4 stars.  The dijon mustard does make it taste country french, "pres d'Avignon".

This is not a bad recipe at all. I used a can of tomato and made up for the lost liquid with 1/2 cup more broth and some red wine, added an onion, 2 ribs of celery, and a tbsp of brown sugar. I normally like my veggies crunchy but my husband likes them mushy so i threw in the carrots and potatoes early onto the cooking process. The finished product was a rich, flavorful, sloppy stew, which was a great hit with my daughter. Next time though, I'm gonna take the advise of others and throw in my veggies an hour later.

Good recipe!  I added paprika, garlic powder, and seasoned pepper to the flour mixture, and added 1/2 cup red wine and 2 tsp minced garlic to the stew while it was cooking.  I only used 1 Tbsp mustard; last time I made it as written and thought it was too mustard-y.

A bit too strong for us.  I don't like the tomatoes in the stew!  It gave me heartburn.  Usually we gobble up leftover stew, but this time we didn't eat them at all.  We DID cook it in the crockpot, so maybe that made the flavor too strong?

This is excellent!  I had a leftover pot roast, so I just used the meat, potatoes and carrots from that.  Since they were already cooked, it made this very fast.  I just added about 4 tbl of cornstarch to thicken (mixed with water).  Besides that, I followed this to the letter and thought the taste was fantastic.  This is a keeper!

This was really good; I did as other suggested and let the meat simmer for an hour before adding the veggies.
I also added onion. I accidentally subbed a can of stewed tomatoes for the diced and it was really good. But I never got a gravy like consistency and had to add a little corn starch, thus the four stars.

This is a great recipe!  I followed other reviews and added the vegetables after cooking 1 hour, but my vegetables took another 45 min. to cook.  I also added celery and zucchini.  Husband loved it!

I hate beef stew but This I can eat 2 days in a row. The meat is sooooo tender. It is not spicy at all. I freeze the left over and that is rear that there are left overs I tell them the pot is empty ;-)that is after everyone has 2nds or is on their 3rd bowl.

We all loved this...including two finicky kids!  Everyone who came into the house told me how wonderful it smelled.  It was SOOO easy to make!  I cooked a bit longer, including cover off, because I like a thicker broth.  Also had to substitute Italian stewed tomatoes...no big deal.

I have finally found the perfect recipe for beef stew! My only changes were an extra 1/2 can of beef broth and an extra tablespoon of mustard. This was just delicious.
