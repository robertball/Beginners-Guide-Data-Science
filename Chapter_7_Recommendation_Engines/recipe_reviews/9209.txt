This is how I have been making my sweet potatoes since I can remember, and how my mother and grandmother did before me.  The only difference is that I use brown sugar instead of white.  I think it gives it a more "carmelized" flavor and texture.  I also omit the spices all together.  I don't care for spicy sweet potatoes, just SWEET sweet potatoes :0)  Be sure to use "real" butter for this as that is part of the fabulous end result!!!!  Thanks!

If you want more of a candied yam where they almost look fried around the edges, then reduce the amount of sugar and butter. Too much sauce drowns the potatoes and they overcook in too much sauce and start falling apart, become liquidy and mushy. So many recipes call for too much liquid, reduce by half and make sure to cook your butter and sugar first for carmelization, then add your potatoes. Make sure there is just enough sauce on the bottom of the potatoes and NOT half way up. Then they become candied.

Slow cooking without stirring made all the difference - thank you I finally made the perfect sweet potatoes! I only baked the potatoes for a bit so they would not fall apart while slow cooking and stay firm. Also, I only used about 2 TBS brown sugar. About 5 minutes before serving, I transfered them to a casserole dish and added chopped pecans then topped with marshmallows and browned it in the oven. So yummy!

I saw another reviewer say that after it was done...didn't want to make again because of the work.  I had the complete opposite reaction.  We liked these so much that I would definately do these again.  Don't get me wrong, it is time consuming...but we believe they are totally worth it.  Do be careful because they can burn.  We found french vanilla cool whip and ate this as a dessert the next day  (yum leftovers).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful side dish!  These are so much like what I enjoyed at holiday time when I was a kid in south Ga.  My recommendations are: 1)Yams and sweet potatoes are NOT the same thing. Use sweet potatoes if you can find them.  However ,if only yams are available, substitute and make this dish anyway, because although the taste is not the same, the result is still very very good.  2)Even though this recipe is designed to create a very sweet dish, it calls for more sugar than is necessary.  I start with HALF of the sugar and ALL of the spices.  As the sweet potatoes cook, I taste and add more sugar as needed, and I usually only add a tablespoon or two.  3) Make sure to turn the sweet potatoes about every fifteen minutes, to coat them well on both sides.  As they cook, they become very tender, so be careful in turning them because they will easily fall apart.  This does not affect the taste, but it does affect the presentation.  This is also a good reason to cut the sweet potatoes at least 1/3" thick-- the thinner they are, the more likely they are to break. 4) Try to remember to add the vanilla at the end.  I forget so often, and the dish is still very nice, but the vanilla adds alot.  I've dealt with my forgetfulness by leaving one vanilla bean out on the counter, and I'll throw it in the pan sometime during the last 10-30 minutes of cooking.

Delicious and easy.  I used about 2 pounds of sweet potatoes, uncooked. Peeled and sliced them into a baking pan.  I also used half white and half brown sugar.  Baked them covered at 375 degrees for about 1 and a 1/2 hours.

Excellent recipe! Much easier than the way I made them in the past. I needed a large dutch oven sized pot to cook six sweet potatoes though. I left them in large chunks so they wouldn't disintigrate while cooking. The addition of vanilla is awesome but my family doesn't care for cinnamon and nutmeg in their candied sweet potatoes, so I added the zest of one small orange which added a nice flavor.

I love this recipe, but my son is diabetic  so I use Splenda in place of the sugar and double the spices.  Some times I also add a   little sugar free maple flavored syrup  for a more traditional taste   I also bake it.  I served it at our family Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  They also liked the fact it was much lower in calories.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Finally! After years of the frustration of having watery sweet potatoes and not being sweet enough...I come across this recipe! Now I can serve my candied yams with pride. I never thought I'd be able to make them "candied". And I never thought to cook them in an iron skillet. DUH! This is definately a keeper for me!

This was a really nice recipe. I forgot to put the vanilla in at the end and also put just 3/4 the amount of sugar (half white and half brown) as some of the previous reviews said the recipe might be too sweet.  I served this to a bunch of brits that had never had Sweet Potatoes like this and it was a hit!! Oh yes, I also cooked this in the oven in a heavy cast baking pan with foil on top rather than a skillet.  I cooked for about 35 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.  I would make this again.

First time I ever made sweet potatoes, and everyone thought they were delicious. I found, though, that at the end of my hour, the sauce was not carmelized but very liquid, so I removed the potatoes, as they were fully cooked, and simmered the remaining liquid with the cover removed til it carmelized and then poured it back over my potatoes.

My sister, Susan, is the queen of candied yams. They are the favorite dish on any table! Her secrets for stove top yams: cook the butter and sugar first to get it thick and syrupy (but don't burn it), then add the yams, this way you don't over cook the potatoes and get them all mushy and falling apart. Also make enough sugary mixture to "cover" the yams, this way you don't have to keep turning and busting them up and all mushy. If you have to, turn the yams over with a small spoon one by one and "make sure to cook on low" so they "slightly" bubble. Don't let boil vigorously, this turns the yams to mush. You won't perfect this dish on the first try, but if you master it after 3-4 times, you'll get the perfect candied yams and they will ALWAYS be requested on Thanksgiving. We don't add other flavorings, don't need to, but we do add marshmallows on top and stick in the oven just to brown. Even picky kids eat em up, enjoy!      was to cook ied yams. They were truly candied, not mushy

I've made this twice now, once with the yellow "sweet potatoes" and once with the orange "yams" (though I guess they are all technically yams, my mom swears there is difference and only buys the "sweet potatoes"). The yellow ones came out firmer, the orange yams got mushy.

Yummy.  My husband raved about them so much I ended up cooking another batch the day after. Smelled so good while cooking.  Took longer to cook than expected-I think I cut the potatoes too thick.  Added half white-half brown sugar because I like the flavor the brown sugar adds.

Served this on Thanksgiving.  It was a big hit.  I substituted Splenda brown sugar for half of the sugar.  It was great.  Will definitely make this again.

These sweet potatoes were, by far, the best I ever had!  They were extremely easy to make and everyone loved them!  My mother-in-law was even impressed! She actually suggested not having them for Thanksgiving because she said nobody ever ate them...well, guess what, everyone ate mine!!!  I did sub 1/4 of the sugar with brown sugar, but other than that followed to scale!  YUM YUM YUM!  Thanks!!!!!

Awesome!! Scaled the recipe down, using only 2 potatoes, but still made plenty.  You really need a large pan for this so you can spread the poatoes out so they cook evenly. Cooked in about 40 minutes. Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Used another reviewer's suggestion and stirred the sugar into the melted butter before I added the potatoes; resulted in a great sauce.  And don't forget the vanilla; it makes the dish pop.

This was an excellent recipe. I did not find it to be a lot of work, except for the peeling and cutting of the potatoes. I did make a few changes. I used brown instead of white sugar. I also melted the butter in the microwave and hand tossed it with the potatoes in a large bowl to make sure they were well coated before placing them in an electric skillet and sprinkling them with the sugar mixture. Once the sugar and butter melted together to make the sauce(set at 300 degrees), I turned the skillet to WARM and cooked them covered that way for the hour,stirring them a few times to ensure they were well coated with the sauce. Absolutely divine and held their shape and texture just fine. The sauce can look a little loose, but thickens upon standing. Also, you can take the potatoes out of the skillet, then pour however much or little of the sauce  you prefer over them. This one will go into my recipe box!

This is similar to how my mother-in-law taught me to make sweet potatoes. The first time I made candied yams, I selected this recipe as a guide because the proportions were dead on to what I remembered my mother-in-law telling me. We do this differently by using brown sugar or a mix of brown sugar and white sugar. We also add the sugar to the melted butter at low heat and stir to make a caramelized sauce. Be careful not to burn the sugar. Also, don't remove the mixture from the heat for too long (the sugar will get hard and your sauce will be lumpy). When the sauce has caramelized, add the potatoes. If the sauce sizzles when adding the potatoes, its too hot, reduce the heat and continue to stir. Otherwise, keep adding the potatoes and stir for a few more minutes as the water from the potatoes thins out the sauce. Then just let the potatoes simmer in the sauce at low heat until done. This recipe is good, but I think these changes make it a 5 star, although it is a little more work.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy.  I've been trying different recipies for 25 years., this is the winner.  I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  My kitchen smells wonderful.

Cook in a skillet? who knew? Worked millions times better than my method I've used for years. So much easier than boiling, transferring, baking, lots of dishes later. Good too, though I forgot the vanilla at the end. Rave reviews from family!

This is def one of my favorite recipes on this site. My mother-in-law asked me how I made it and that's the first time in 11years that she complimented me on anything I made. I do use brown sugar and add pecans at the end and bake it for about 10 minutes.. mmm the best!

So delicious!  I made this recipe almost exactly as written.  The potatoes were cooked and starting to fall apart after only 30 minutes.  I transferred them to a casserole dish, topped with mini marshmallows, and baked at 350 just until the marshmallows were golden brown.  Kids and adults alike declared them amazing.  This is certainly a tasty addition to any holiday meal!

For Thanksgiving my family used to by these frozen bagged candied sweet potatoes. This past year they were unable to find them in the grocery stores so I went out on a limb and tried this recipe. PERFECT! I am now in charge of the candied sweet potatoes every year. EVERYONE LOVED THEM! Even my sister who doesn't like them!

Similar to what my mom taught me - but we do it on a cookie sheet in the oven.  Boil the potatoes ahead with the peels on.  Let them cool and the peels will slide right off.  (If you don't peel them, you can leave them in the pot in the fridge till the next day.) Slice the peeled potatoes about 1/2" thick.  Melt 1/4 c of butter on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven.  Place the potatoes on the sheet turning to coat with butter.  Sprinkle with brown sugar and any spices you want (cinammon or nutmeg).  Bake for 30 min or until the edges are crisp.  Fabulous the next day warmed in the microwave!  And freeze really well, too.

This is the only way to make authentic southern candied sweet potatoes.  My mother always boiled the sweet potatoes in the skins and always overcooked them.  She would then cut them length wise and they would fall apart.  When I got older a girlfriend made them this way and I've been making them like this ever since.  I omit the cinnamon and use more butter.  Most of the time I just layer the ingredients and dot with butter starting with butter on the bottom of a very heavy pan or pot.  Calphalon always works for me or a heavy cast iron skillet with a lid.  Make sure you turn the fire down real low and watch them carefully.  Sweet potatoes always make their own water and with the sugar and butter you never need to add any liquid.  The best recipe for sweet potatoes or yams, ever!

I printed this recipe out on a whim two Thanksgiving's ago.  I'm so glad I did.  I started cooking my family's holiday meals and this seemed very easy to follow.  It is now a tradition to have these sweet potatoes at all major holidays.  I changed nothing and followed the recipe to the exact letter.  Thank you for posting.  This is my favorite recipe for sweet potatoes, even the kids eat them!

This recipe was my first attempt at making candied yams.  My family loved them!  My husband tried to eat the whole pan and really didn't want to share them with anyone else!  Great recipe.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!! The reviews are correct!!! I did get confused about if I needed to add water, but since the recipe didnt say to add it, I didnt.  The sugar and salt pulls the water out of the potatos and makes more than enough sauce. I did sub part of the white sugar for brown sugar, but I didnt measure anything, thats just me. If this is your first or hundredth time making sweet potatos, try this recipe, you wont be disappointed.

Yummy, thanks! I used yams because that was all I could find. They were quite soft after an hour, so next time I will reduce the cooking time if I have to use yams again. The flavor was nice and a very easy recipe. Love it and will be making these again for sure!

OMG! Made them for Thanksgiving and another reviewer put them in a crockpot to save space so that's what I did....I'm telling you they where sooooo good, I always brought sweet potatoes in the can and I never would eat them because the potato did'nt taste real, I will never have to deprive myself from what I use to love. NEVER AGAIN. I added 1/2c of Brown Sugar cooked for 3hr. stirred a few time. My family loved them and everybody wanted seconds...very easy 1pot.

This one is a winner everytime. My 4 year old requests it on a regular basis. I normally end up serving this as a dessert. Everyone praises this dish and say they never knew sweet potatoes could taste so good. Definitely 5 stars all the way for this dish.

Very easy recipe and very good. I cooked mine in the oven and used one cup of brown sugar/one cup of white sugar. I also melted the butter in a pan along with the sugar, then poured the mixture over the yams. Don't forget to add the vanilla...this really seals the deal.

I never tried this in a skillet. Surprise, surprise. This was amazingly alot easier than my method. Wonderful flavor, great texture and carmelization. Just be careful of the amount of sugar you add. Next time, maybe 1 1/2 cup will be enough.

These were a huge hit at my Easter dinner last night I did do as others suggested, and substituted 1c. brown sugar for 1 c. of the white. Very easy to do in my caste iron fry pan, and truly delicious!

Delicious!!  I did use mostly light brown sugar with about 1/2 cup of white sugar.  The taste was wonderful.  I'm serving these tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  The only problem I had was that they were done a lot earlier than I expected, so they got a little softer than I wanted and since I'll have to warm them tomorrow, I'm afraid they may get too mushy.  Also they didn't candy like I expected, so I added a touch of cornstarch to the juice to thicken it a bit.  You can't beat the taste though!

I thought this turned out great! It was my first time making candied sweet potatoes, so I was a little intimidated. 

I took another reviewers advice and did one cup brown sugar and one cup white. It gave it a great taste. Also, this did not take nearly as long to cook as I expected, after about 30 mins, they were ready to go! I guess my advice would be to keep checking to make sure that you don't overcook. Thanks so much! Will use this recipe again!

Easy recipe - Turned out perfect.  I did change a few minor things.  I reduced to white sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added a 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I did not add the vanilla because the taste did not seem to need it.  I cooked these in the old southern tradition by using an iron skillet.  It made the presentation look appetizing.  This goes in my recipe box as a keeper.

This is the first year I made these and my entire family declared that this MUST be made every Thanksgiving & Christmas from now on. This is the only dish that people had seconds of! They are delicious. And, it's wonderful that you can cook them on the stovetop since the turkey & the rolls are normally taking up the oven. Wonderful recipe. Thank you!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they turned out  soft instead of candied but still absolutely delicious.  I didn't have a skillet large enough for 6 lg sweet potatoes so only used 4. I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I may follow another reviewers suggestion and uncover for the last 30 minutes of cooking, in hope that some of the excess liquid will evaporate to help candy.  My guests went on and on about how these were the best sweet potatoes they had ever tried.   They couldn't have been easier to make either.  Definitely a keeper.

Flavor was good, but there was an awful lot of liquid which I ended up cooking down. I do think the potatoes need to be cut very thick as they will fall apart if too thin.

I used this recipe and combined it with another; adding a little OJ to the mix 1/2 cup to be exact as I had doubled the recipe.  Then followed this other than that.  Delicous

5 stars for delicious and easy!  Didn't add the vanilla because honestly, I didn't think they needed it!  One thing to note--other reviewers mentioned that the potatoes fell apart.  If you slice them thick (recipe never specified how thick to slice), you won't have that problem, and they'll still cook enough.  YUM!

Very, very good. Exactly what I was looking for in candied sweet potatoes. Very sweet and rich and tasty. I used the fresh sweet potatoes in the store (the orange ones) and they really cooked up well. My only recommendation is to chunk them or slice them very thick (1/4" or thicker) because they break up too easily otherwise and the presentation is lost. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This was terrific.  Made for Thanksgiving. Even those in the group that didn't like sweet potatoes took second servings.  I cooked ahead of time and then put in a casserole dish for a half hour on low temp during the last minutes of the turkey.  That way was able to enjoy happy hour with family instead of slaving over the stove!

LOVE THIS RECIPE! It was my first making these. I'm now to cooking and I made this about 3 times in a week! My friend tried it all loved it. First time i did  a test batch with 2 yams and reduced to 1 cup of sugar kept everything else the same and it was so so good! Thanks! This will be something I do very often.

Very sweet and yummy.  Simmer (use smallest burner) so the syrup doesn't get too thick.  Next time I'll chop the yams into large chunks instead of circles.

I love candied yams, but stopped making them - I could not get them sweet (used to boil them first).  I tried this recipe for Xmas and let me say, this was the best candied yams I have ever tasted.  I loved it so much I wanted to make more the next day, but store was out of sweet potatoes.  Thank you Pam, this recipe is now taped to the inside kitchen cabinet door, where I put all all my go to recipes.

My search is over!!! These are just like the ones my grandmother would make!! I tried to make these last year with yams and they were very stringy and un-enjoyable. This year I found sweet potatoes. My grandmother always made them so they were hard around the edges (I don't know if she fried them 1st) but it was sooo good. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. I doubled the spices and cut the sweet potatoes in inch size pieces because it's more heart warming and pleasant if you take the time to cut them. No one wants a big bulky potato in their mouth. This dish tasted even better 5 days later!

Made this delicious recipe for Thanksgiving. I gave it 4 stars, because it was way too much sugar. I would definitely recommend cutting down the sugar by one cup, but still used the rest of the seasonings as directed. I added some pecans as well. I will add this to my recipe book!

This is the one dish I could never master, but now I am THE MASTER!! The only change I made was to use 1 cup of brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar. I have made these numerous times now and they come out perfect every single time!!

I substituted brown sugar for white.  That's the only substitution I made.  I don't think I can go back to the canned stuff ever again.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

My second attempt at candied sweet potatoes. The first time I tried my own recipe but didnt like it. I loved this one with the changes that I made to it, I used only 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and when it was almost finished I added 2 tablespoons of  cornstartch to the sauce to thicken it up.

They were really good.  I did not use as much nutmeg as called for.  I am not really a fan.  Next time I think I will cut down on the butter just a tad.  Thanks for the superb formula.

Two words: too sweet! 
I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving, and because 6 potatoes didn't fit the pan- I only put 5 or so. They turned out too soft and too sweet, so I made steamed a couple more potatoes and added it into the dish. It tasted better this way and had some balance to it. I'll be making this again- IT WAS STILL GOOD but will def cut down on butter+ sugar.

I do wish potato recipes would list the amount of potatoes in pounds rather than a number, because sizes vary so much.  Before I found this recipe, I had already gotten four very large sweet potatoes (not yams) for the recipe I usually use, and they were more than enough.  I wouldn't have been able fit any more than that in the skillet.  The only change I made was to use one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white.  The sauce did not thicken as much as I expected, but they were still very good.  This is a great way to conserve oven space and have easier control over checking for doneness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Whole family loved this. I made it healthier by using cocunut oil instead of butter/margerine. Also used 1/2 cup raw sugar and 1/8 cup Stevia instead of the 2 cups sugar. It was plenty sweet that way!

This recipe was greeeeeeeeat the only thing is it was a little too loose , I would suggest instead of covering the dish let simmer uncovered the last 30-35 minute until done , also like some others I totally forgot the vanilla extract because I was too busy taste testing, but overall great recipe, I definitely will be making this recipe again soooooooon , I will tweek it a little , I would advise any first timers please follow recipe instructions then make changes the way you see fit. thanks

These tasted amazing but they would not get soft on the stove top, they had cooked for 3 hours and were still rock hard, i stuck them in the oven for about 30 minutes they were perfect.

This was very tasty. The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I had some Asian yams lying around, so I used this recipe and they turned out delicious!

Can't go wrong with butter and sugar! I used about a cup and a half of brown sugar, and put it all in the slow cooker. Worked out well.

Fantastic! Truly "candied" just like Grandma's. This is a really sweet dish. Not at all like the sweet potatoes you find baked with the marshmallows that people usually call "candied yams". The candying gives them a different texture. These are the real thing, just what I have been looking for! Thanks for sharing, this is a real treasure.

This turned out just as my motehr would make them on holidays. I didn't give it 5 stars because it isn't the supreme sweet potatoes that my grandmother makes. This is a great basic recipe and works well. If able to try adding the marshmallows and pecans topping.

I've made this many times and have adjusted as following: Use half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also, cut down the amount of sugar to about 1.5 cups total. Since the slices break easily, I just mash them up with a masher. This helps soak up the liquid, too. Thanks for sharing Pam!

Excellent. This how sweet potatoes are supposed to be. Y'all with "southern" sweet potatoes they are supposed to be saucy, juicy or runny. So, don't try to boil or get rid of the brown sauce, if you want, just pour some or all of the sauce off. Cut the SWEET POTATOES not YAMS(looks like a sweet potato, but kind of stringy when cooking) in bigger chunks. I have eaten sweet potatoes for years and they are supposed to be SWEET, SAUCY and MUSHY or mashed.

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving and even the sweet potato haters loved it....so much in fact that I had to make it again for Christmas!  And NO LEFTOVERS!  I sliced the potatoes very thick and am glad I did because the thinner ones began to fall apart at the end.

Awesome recipe!  I usually make my candied "yams/sweet potatoes" the same way.  However, I wanted to try something a little different and I'm so glad I did.  This is definitely a keeper.  Oh, I only used 1 cup of sugar and yams instead of sweet potatoes (all I had on hand).  We re-make using sweet potatoes.

This was a big hit at the Thanksgiving table. I already had the ingredients from making a Jewish apple cake. Sugar, butter, cinamamon and nutmeg, that's it. The cooking time carmelizes the sugar and you would swear there is brown sugar in this recipie. I hand cut the yams into 3/4 inch slices, some in half, giving a quarter moon effect. This is delicious.

This was my grandmother's recipe, although I suspect that she never followed one.  Each year I have to come back and look it up, this time it is going in the family book to give to my grandchildren.  I make mine in an iron skillet just like Grandma Russell did - adds to the flavor...ok, it's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  This is a wonderful, easy recipe.

Delicious all the way through! I substituted brown sugar for white and added a few splashes of spiced rum to deepen the flavors. Very easy to make.

Did them mostly in the skillet and then tossed them in the oven to finish. Had to hurry them, so they weren't super soft. Added a splash of bourbon (just for fun). My favorite comment? "I love the carrots!" ....(me) "They're sweet potatoes"...(him) "I HATE sweet potatoes though!" They were a hit!

This is my new favorite candied sweet potatoes recipe! It was a hit on both Thanksgiving and Christmas. The first time I made it, the nutmeg was very overpowering. I will be omitting it from now on, but I do suggest reducing the amount by at least half. It was hard to taste the sweet potato over it. I also used brown sugar instead of plain white sugar.

I did tweak the recipe a bit. In the end, I transferred the potatoes to a casserole dish and topped with mini marshmallows and finely chopped pecans, and placed in a heated oven (350 is OK, no more than 400) until the marshmallows were gooey. The kids even loved it, and they aren't sweet potato fans. :)

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  The only thing i did differently was use half white sugar and half dark brown sugar and these were fantastic!  These sweet potatoes and the Slow Cooker Stuffing (from this site also) were voted by everyone as the best things on the table.  Huge  hit, thanks for the recipe!  I also liked that they didn't have to go in the oven...that oven was busy doing other things!  Oh yeah, I also forgot to add the vanilla in the rush at the end, but they were fabulous anyway!!

These were good, my neighbor brought some with crushed pecans on top that were a little better.  I had to remove the lid for the sauce to thicken.

After reading others' reviews, I used 2 cups of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I cooked the sweet potatoes for about 50 minutes, and they were perfectly soft.  Overall, this recipe produced tasty candied sweet potatoes.

Woo-wee! These were AWESOME!
Best sweet potato recipe we've ever had!! Might try cutting down on the amount of sugar next time- 2 cups seems like an awful lot...but worth it! 
Merry Christmas!

This dish was very delicious but extremely runny.  I took this dish to a family gathering and everyone raved over the flavor, but like I said, it is extremely runny.  I even tried broiling for a few minutes but it never carmalized like it was supposed to.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! 
I didn't change a thing, and it was fabulous. The kids said it tasted like candy. They were sweet, but not too sweet and not at all watery. In fact, we were worried at first that there might not be enough liquid with just the butter, but it was perfect. 
From the pictures on this site they look really gross and mushy. You do want to be careful when you stir that you don't squish or mash them. They are very soft, but not at all watery or mushy. 
5 stars!
Note: I just added a photo of them...

I made these for Thanksgiving & they're soo yummy. It looked like too little butter & too much sugar but it was perfect & I also used 1/2 as much nutmeg. I used fresh sweet potatoes & Im going to make this again only put it in a casserole dish & melt mini marshmallows on top. Yesterday I made it completely on the stove & had no marshmallows anyway.

I have not had success with sweet potatoes in the past. I tried this recipe but did not have high hopes.  I was pleasantly surprised and totally impressed.  They were awesome, tasted like I wanted. I will definitely make these for Thanksgiving and every holiday meal after. Finally, the taste I have tasted with others sweet potatoes, but never my own. My family all loved them and can't wait for me to make them again. This is an excellent recipe. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was great.

First time ever making candied sweet potatoes and they turned great. I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar. My potatoes didn't cook evenly on the stove top, so I transferred them to a baking dish and finished cooking them in the oven. Turned out great.

Very easy to make and came out so good! I was so happy that the syrup was not runny at all like with other recipes I have tried in the past. I added a handful of pecans while cooking. I will be making this for Christmas dinner this year! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago and it was a hit. This year I was assigned the sweet potatoes again and was able to find the same recipe. Everyone loved them and said they were much better than the store bought kind. I used 7 large sweet potatoes, added some brown sugar in place of all white, and sliced the potatoes into large pieces to prevent breaking. They produced lots of their own liquid and took almost 2hrs on low on the stove top. Still a success in my book!

We just finished our Thanksgiving dinner, and I couldn't write this review fast enough!  These were so easy to make, and so delicious that five stars are not enough!  My mother in law, from Mississippi, said these sweet potatoes are just like what she grew up with!  Any time my mother in law compliments my cooking, I KNOW it's a keeper!  Thanks so much Pam for this recipe, it's easy to make and tastes so good I can't wait to make them again (and it won't be next Thanksgiving either)!

I must say that this is the best Southern Candied Sweet Potatoes recipe in existence. I made them a few days before Thanksgiving to test the recipe for quality and taste. I shared them with my neighbor who wasn't a big fan of candied yams. That is until now, he is begging me to make some for him for his family's Thanksgiving dinner!

This was great...we'd planted some sweet potatoes in the garden this year and I was scrambling to figure out what to do with them.  My daugther, who swore she would NEVER eat sweet potatoes gobbled them up.  

One recommendation...I didn't have the hour that this recipe called for so I cut the sweet potatoes smaller.  They cooked faster and it was still very good!  Also, I second another reviewer they were good as leftovers too :)

Excellent, I used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter...i also cooked with the lid on for 30 mins, then removed the lid to cook for the last 30 (on low heat) to allow the sweet potatoes / sugar to caramelize!  i don't think the vanilla was necessary so i didn't add it, the nutmeg and cinnamon were more than enough!

The Best Old Fashion Recipe! I found that when cooking a lot of potatoes you might want to let them cook longer in the butter.  I let them cook almost until they are tender. Once you add the sugar they candy fast.  My family thought they were AMAZING!!! :)

This is so delicious and easy. The second time I made it I used 1-1/2 C sugar and about 3 T maple syrup....YUMMY.  I think next time instead of the maple syrup I might try adding OJ and bourban. I love this recipe

Great recipe!  We loved how they turned out.  I reduced the recipe, b/c I only had 4 sweet potatoes.  My 7 year old was helping me and might have added a little too much nutmeg.  I forgot to add the vanilla at the end, and kept forgetting to stir it towards the end, but not stirring it made the ones on the bottom of the pan have a fried side to them.  I took the potatoes out, placed them on a dish, then cranked up the heat on the sauce, when it was boiling, I drizzled it over the potatoes.  YUMMY! Definatly soak your pan in soap & water immediatly. Sauce hardens quick.

My Hubster loved these! I'm partial to savory side dishes, but this gooey & sweet dish was a pretty tasty side as part of our Thanksgiving dinner. Didn't change a thing about the recipe and were happy with the results! They certainly are candied! Thanks for the recipe! We'll make it again with the next turkey! :)

DELICIOUS! I just made this for Thanksgiving at a friend's house and there was no leftovers! It was so good I had to promise my husband I would make it again tonight. 

I'm a rather disorganized cook (part of my charm), so I made a few recipes modifications out of necessity and based off other reviews. 
I only had 4 large sweet potatoes, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, left out the vanilla (I ran out!), and baked in the oven in a dark pan at 375 and covered with foil for 1 hour. Since I didn't have vanilla I drizzled some maple syrup over it just before I popped it in the oven. 
When I got to my friend's house I topped with chopped pecans and mini marshmallows and popped back in the oven uncovered for about 15 minutes, just enough to brown the marshmallows. Turned out to be the best part. When it came out of the oven the second time the sauce was thick and gooey! I think the spices added a nice flavor and the added pecans and marshmallows made it extra special! Everyone helped themselves to seconds and thirds! 

Thanks a lot for this recipe, it will be a holiday staple in my house!

The best recipe for sweet potaotes i have tried. I had these in mind to make for my boyfriend and initially i asked if he liked sweet potatoes and he said NO!! I made them anyway and Yes he loved them. He said they tasted like a dessert. Although mine didnt get the 'candied' effect i was hoping for - a little too much liquid left over and also was cooked in about 45mins. definetely a keeper never going back to making these in the oven.

The boys loved it, I made these candied sweet potatos for the first time for  ThanksGiving, they turned out great ! ! The Family loved them, they remind me of my grandmothers candied yams.  I used a I cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar. Next time I will cut the sugar to about 1 1/2 cup a little too sweet for me, but fantastic recipe all the same.

I made this with yams instead of sweet potatoes. I didn't have sweet potatoes. My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I didn't have to cook them for an hour.  Probably only 45 minutes.  They were a perfect side dish for our Thanksgiving meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

We had this for dinner last night and it was very good! The yams were a little underdone, but we had some things pushed on us that interrupted the time I had originally planned on started making dinner and I was feeling rushed and impatient, so I think that's why. I omitted the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white. I also added a can of crushed pineapple with the juice. I made half the recipe since it was just our family of 5 (and 3 are small children). Very easy and yummy.

I have used this recipe several times over the years with great results. I used brown sugar as well. Tastes like my mom used to make. When I lived overseas and couldn't get fresh sweet potatoes I used drained canned sweet potatoes and it still tasted great.

The best!  My husband loves sweet potatoes, but I usually gave him the canned type.  I'll never go back to canned again!  Like the others, I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Will use this recipe again and again!

This was the only new reciped I added to my Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a huge hit!  I only used 3/4 of the sugar mixture and it was super sweet.  The cooking time was nowhere near what the recipe stated but I sliced the potatoes relatively thin.  Great recipe. Will use it again.

This was a great side dish for my first Christmas dinner as a new bride. My husband said they were better then his mothers. I loved this recipe! Just the right amount of everything I didn't vary in any way from the original recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong, but these didn't turn out the way they were supposed to.  I cut the ingredient list in half as it was only my husband and I eating, but other reviewers have done this and their recipe turned out fine.  The problem was that the 'sauce' just would not reduce.  I cooked the potatoes with the lid on for about 30 minutes, and after that time the sauce wasn't even close to starting to reduce and the potatoes were cooked, so I removed the lid and left them for another half hour, we just ended up with a very gloopy, sticky sauce.  The flavour wasn't bad (hence 3 stars), but they were VERY sweet, so I'm not sure how quick I will be to make these again.

I made these on Thanksgiving.  Since the majority of my family are not fond of sweet potatoes, I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings.  I thought that they were pretty good.  My kids wouldn't touch them...but they are picky. They were very easy to make.

Each Thanksgiving I search for the recipe that will satisfiy my husbands desire for candied sweet potatoes. This year with this recipe he said I'm getting close, but the "candied" portion was "syrup" and not thick.  He did say they were tasty though.

Wonderful recipe! Candied sweet potatoes have always been one of my favorite side dishes.  I have made this dish several times now, and each time the results have been perfect.  If you're big on presentation I would suggest cutting the sweet potatoes in thick slices, and be gentle while stiring.  They tend to get very soft while cooking.

Great easy to make candied sweet potatoes.  I made these for Thanks Giving and had to make them again for Christmas.  The little bit of vanilla really makes the difference.  Great recipe, Thanks.

Delicious!!!  Don't change this recipe one bit :)  Wonderful as is--without omitting or adding ingredients.  Note--the smaller you cut the potatoes, the quicker it cooks.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful!  I made it to accompany our second Christmas ham feast, since our scalloped potatoes were dwindling.  It reminded me of my grandmother's candied sweet potatoes, which I just loved!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2018 and we loved it.   I cut the sugar because regular recipes are just too sweet for us.  The nutmeg gives this recipes a bit of a different flavor than what I grew up with, but I loved it.  Tomorrow for Christmas 2018 I am going to add 2 sliced and peeled apples to the sweet potatoes.  My brother in law use to always bring the sweet potatoes with apples add, but they moved across the country and I miss his recipe.

Excellent! Made it for Thanksgiving. Added additional sauce ingredients then let it simmer for a while after removing the potatoes in order to thicken it up.

Like so many others, I was skeptical about this method. After reading several reviews, however, I decided to give it a try. I peeled, sliced, and tossed the sweet potatoes into my sauté pan with reckless abandon. The end result? My entire family loved the finished product, and I love being able to do all the prep ahead of time. This recipe is a keeper!

I make this exact recipe every year during the holidays, it is THE BEST. Every single person who eats my sweet potatoes says they are the best they have ever tasted. The only bad thing about that is there are never any extra for leftovers. Even if y you make a boat load, you will not have leftovers.

The only thing I did differently was use brown sugar. I think it tastes better.  Very good recipe though. Pretty traditional.

I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 Brown sugar instead of all white sugar. My family loves this.

Most times I like to have multiple layers of flavor in a dish and this can be problematic with candied sweet potatoes. This recipe however captures this and is the best candied sweet potatoes I ever had. The potatoes will accompany any main dish as a great side and I don't think you will be disappointed.

This dish came out really nice, the cooking time was a little off because the slices almost got too mushy. I also used some grated orange peel and that gave the dish a nice twist

simple and easy, makes a lot of syrup - I used 3 lbs of smaller potatoes, i'll use a few more potatoes next time.  I prefer these to the casseroles which are great but..... they're more like dessert.  these are sweet enough but really yummy!  using a cast iron skillet was perfect, I have a very large one with lid.  Candied sweet potatoes in less than an hour.

These were good, but I won't give them a full five stars because I didn't see a substantial difference compared to similar recipes that I've tried.

I liked this recipe but I did make an adjustment: I used less than half the sugar asked for and all dark brown sugar. Every time I make them I convert some "yam-haters" and now its an expected dish at any family get togethers that I host:) I love it because its stove top and they don't need to be babysat. Can't overcook them, they just get better!

I give 5 stars for the ingredients, because this is how I think real candied sweet potatoes should be done.  My way is to use both white and brown sugars and I begin my potatoes on top of the stove in my heavy black cast iron huge skillet and once they sugars have melted and they are all coated well, I put the skillet into my oven and let it bake until the potatoes are tender and the syrup is thickened.  They are so good.  Since my diabetes has become worse, I am making my potatoes using Splenda white and brown sugars and I am confident they will be just as incredible.  I have been cooking with Splenda for years now and everything I bake comes out great.    I am so glad that there are others who really know how to make dishes that still taste like our Momma's and Grandma's used to make.  I love holidays because the smells make me think of my Momma, Lillie and my Grandma Lizzie and my Great Aunt Annie.  Great cooks all and I learned from the best.

My family has been making sweet potatoes this way for years. We use brown sugar and omit the spices. I pre-cook them in microwave for a few minutes then slice and simmer them for a few hours in a pressure cooker. Fabulous. Absolutely no spices or marshmallows.

Made this for our early family Thanksgiving; everyone loved them.  I deleted the nutmeg, used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and FORGOT the vanilla.  They are easy to make and very tasty!

The best sweet potatoes we've had.  Savory and sweet; but not too much of either.  (I also threw all of the ingredients into a dish and baked it instead of using the stove top.)

Followed the advice of a few of the others cut the sugar in 1/2.  (1/2 white, 1/2 light brown), sliced thick.  These were absolutely delicious! This will probably replace my sweet potato bake for the next few holidays.  Yummy!

Followed the advice of a few of the others cut the sugar in 1/2.  (1/2 white, 1/2 light brown), sliced thick.  These were absolutely delicious! This will probably replace my sweet potato bake for the next few holidays.  Yummy!

Salt is important for potatoes of any color! If you use unsalted butter please add salt, it helps to reach the sweetness without adding tons of sugar! Loved this!
 Oh, and slice thickly about one and a half inches, to keep them from falling apart!

Just made these a few minutes ago.  Stupid delicious.   Used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.  Cooked in Dutch oven  until almost fork tender then cranked up heat until cinnamon sugar mix became syrup.   Kids loved 'em.

I loved this recipe! The recipe said it would take about an hour to cook the potatoes but it only took about a half hour. It was a very easy recipe to follow. I would strongly suggest these sweet potatoes!

Followed the recipe exactly.....very easy and so tasty. I've always made the same sweet potato dish and decided to change it up a bit for today's Thanksgiving dinner at my family's. Everyone absolutely loved it. Will definitely become part of my "turkey dinner" repertoire!
Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I too substituted 1/2 the call for white sugar with brown sugar. I'm glad I did it too. And thank God the dish turned out to be perfect--not too sweet. Cut your sweet potatoes at least 1/3 inch thick or they are sure to break when turning them. Delicious side dish made just the way grandma used to do it,

Fantastic.  I didn't add the spices except for the salt.  Usually I just wing it when making these, but not any more.  This was perfect.

The recipe was OK. My sauce didn't candy, so I had to add a bit of cornstarch at the end.  But by that time, they were so soft, that they mushed a bit when I tried stirring in the cornstarch.  I cut sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white.  The nutmeg was overpowering even though I used less and I suggest omitting it completely.  I will be trying another recipe next time.

A great recipe that was simple to make.  I made a few revisions after reading the reviews, reducing the amount of sugar and butter, and using brown sugar instead of white.  My daughter, who has never liked sweet potatoes, really enjoyed these.  I will be making these often!

Have used many different recipes over the years, but this was the best of all.  I don't care for sweet potatoes, but these weren't bad.  My husband thought they tasted just like his mom's recipe and they were similar, just not as time consuming, or fattening.

Good but it made way too much syrup. I used 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar instead of two cups of white sugar. Next time I will use 3/4 cup of each. Otherwise nice flavor and aroma.

Mine needed to cook much longer than an hour, and they turned out very soupy, not carmelized.  I put them in a baking dish and cooked them an additional 20 mins in the oven to cook down the sauce a bit (this after cooking on the stovetop for 1 1/2 hours).  The flavor was nice, and they didn't fall apart, but it took too long to cook.

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have nutmeg on hand so I just left that ingredient out.  I don't think it made too much of a difference.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Believe it or not, I microwaved the sweet potato to speed things up. I actually only had one left in my fridge so I didn't want to wait to cook an hour. It worked out fine! Next time with more sweet potatoes I will make it correctly. But even this way, I would rate it a 5 star.

very good. I just cooked mine a little different only b/c I had 3 large yams and had cut and was boiling them with the skin when I decided to look for a quick recipe and followed this one just 1/2 the amounts. after yams were done boiling I just dumped the other ingredients back into the pot I boiled them in and stirred it up and cooked for a few minutes.

I made this recipe last night and while it was really delicious, the next time I will do it a bit differently.  I think there is way too much butter.  1/3 cup is too much and I believe 2-3 tbsp. is enough because otherwise it is too greasy.  I would also bake it in the oven next time.

My potatoes turned out mushy, not candied or crispy/hard around the edges. There was a lot of sauce left after an hour of cooking and I made a point to use very large potatoes after reading some of the other reviews. The flavor wasn't bad but overall it was too mushy and too sweet for my taste. I don't anticipate making them again.

My mom makes sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving every year, and I've never liked them before, but these were awesome!  My dad hollered from the kitchen when he was getting more, "Michele did you make these?"  I hollered back, "Yeah," and he said, "They're actually good this year!"  I guess you had to be there, but boy these were good!

After making these I will never used canned potatoes again! They were so wonderful I could have served them for dessert! I don't like nutmeg so I used 1/2 tsp of cloves instead and used about 3/4 C white sugar and 1 1/4 C brown sugar and left out the salt.  I also had to add some canned chicken stock to keep them from sticking and burning. They still candied nicely. THE BEST D_MN Taters I ever et!

Great recipe. I always look to cook something traditional in different ways. I received quite a few compliments and some wouldn't even believe I made them. I was being lazy and used canned sweet potatoes, so I reduced the amount of sugar. I'll definately be making this again.

Awesome! I love candied yams and these are even better than Grandma's. I loved the nutmeg flavor it gave this a nice spicy warmth. My guests raved over this dish. I used brown sugar instead of white because of tradition, canned sweet potatoes and did mine in the oven. I used real butter since this was a holiday dish and not an everyday meal. Thanks for sharing this, I could eat the whole dish of these they are so good!

GREAT!! I made these the other night and like other viewers used brown sugar instead of white sugar and they tasted great! My husband actually suggested for me to transfer the potatoes from the pan to a baking dish and toss some miniature marshmallows on top..I think I'll try that next time!  This was so easy to make and tasted great..thanks for the recipe!

Thank you Pam for submitting this recipe, it is as close to what I remember my great grandmother making, it is absolutely delicious, I did use brown sugar instead of white, but I am sure it is great either way.  Finally a recipe without marshmallows and nuts!  YUMMY!

Almost perfect, but guess what! I add a small handful of cinnamon (red hots) candies to the sugar mixture.  You will love the red color and extra cinnamon flavor.  Try it, you'll love it.
Goes so good with a ham dinner.

Turned out great!  I didn't have trouble with burning at all, in fact I think I was being over cautious b/c I had to turn up the heat to thicken the sauce and cook the potatoes slices more.  And you would not believe how easy it is to forget the vanilla!!  Still turns out great nonetheless.

Nice change from the way too sugary marshmellow stuff!!!!  This focuses much more on the sweet potato flavor and is not super sugary!

This recipes tastes WONDERFUL!!  But it is a lot of work.  It is very messy, peeling fresh sweet potatoes is sticky and it stains everything.  It was delicious when it was all said and done but I can't bring myself to make it again because of all the work involved.

I have to tell you, after years of eating sweet potatoes/yams out of a can..I have found 
a recipe that is easy, fast, and tasty.  I served them at Christmas dinner and everyone
could not get enough.  My husband loved them so much, I am going to make it again 
this week!  Excellent recipe, Pam.

Like some reviewers, I cut the sugar amount  and used more brown sugar  than white.  Thanksgiving guests said best  sweet potatoes they ever had.  This is the way I grew up having them and will now go back to making this way.

I made this as an alternative to the candied sweet potatoes that my mother used to make with butter, brown sugar, and OJ.  I wanted something different, and this recipe looked fairly simple and good.

It turned out very well, and reminds you of the taste you get with the sweet potato casserole topped with mini marshmallows.  The vanilla definitely adds to that flavor.

I made these in a Dutch oven on top of the stove, since I already had a turkey in the oven.  I also used cane sugar, simply because I had a lot of it to use.  And I prefer it to white sugar.  Take the time to slide the sweet potatoes the same thickness and size.  I did fairly well on thickness, but some of my slices were twice the diameter of the others.  And they did not cook through completely.  I ended up cutting them in half to let them finish cooking.

I definitely recommend this recipe.

I have made this several times now. Initially I followed the recipe exactly, which is delicious. This Thanksgiving, I substituted light brown sugar instead of the white sugar, added a pinch more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and cloves, and added (accidentally, but worked out in my favor) a splash more vanilla than is called for. That, and I made it in a slow cooker instead! Worked beautifully and was amazing!!

This is like dessert I don’t feel guilty about- I mean it’s a vegetable, right? Yum! You can’t go wrong. Like another reviewer said, put half the sugar and butter. I cover it a bit while cooking  then let it caramelize/thicken with the cover off for the remainder of the time. You really can’t mess this up. It will come out great.

Like most of you, my family has been making this forever. But with a few differences. I substitute white sugar for brown, I mix it all in a skillet but then I will finish in the oven with marshmallows.  I am going to put some cinnamon and vanilla in next time though. Thank you  to all the reviewers, I get the best tweets from you all!!

This turned out great. It was a lot faster than the casserole recipes and I had everything needed on hand. I didn’t have as many potatoes so reduced the recipe. I made it with a pork roast recipe and it was the perfect side.

I wasn't sure what "Large Sweet Potatoes" meant...I had 2 that seemed pretty big,(like very large Idaho's)  so I halved the rest of the ingredients. I had to uncover after 45 min to get the darker color and thickness. The kids devoured.....obviously, very sweet and great for a dessert...not a side, in my opinion;)I will make them again for the kids, but with a little less sugar;)

This is the only recipe needed for delicious candied sweet potatoes.  I use all brown sugar and a little extra cinnamon, otherwise I pretty much follow the recipe.  Comes out perfect every time!

Made two pans, doubled the servings for each, of this for a family get together. The 1st followed the recipe exactly as written; the second pan I made changes (half white sugar, half brown sugar, reduced vanilla and omitted nutmeg). 

Both were equally delicious and there were no leftovers of either.

These turned out great. I had a Thanksgiving guest state that this was the best part of the meal. I combined regular and brown sugar and tossed in some candied walnuts but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.

Everyone loved this. I accidentally put the vanilla extract with the dry ingredients. I also added halved pecans after I cooked the yams.

Yummy! I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup of water, 4 tbs. butter , 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 1 (40 oz.) can Bruce’s Yams Cut Sweet Potatoes, drained but I did reserve about 1/4 c of the syrup,  1 tbs. bourbon.
Over medium high heat, I cooked the water and the sugars until the sugar was completely melted. I added the reserved syrup, and vanilla, return to a boil. I shut off the heat and added the bourbon.  Then I turned the heat to medium  in order to allow the alcohol to burn off. (a couple of minutes.) I then added the sweet potatoes and stirred gently to coat evenly. Simmered for 5 to 10 minutes. You could also whip them. I whipped them the day after  Thanksgiving. Yum!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I used brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe. I was worried it wasn’t going to be enough sauce for 6 large sweet potatoes but when it cooks, it spreads further than you think. Like eating candy!!! Will definitely make again!!

I have made this recipe a few times and it is always great!!  I have changed it just a little...I double the amount of butter and once the potatoes have cooked, I transfer them to a baking dish.  I take about a half a cup of pecan pieces and mixed it with the candied sauce and then using a slotted spoon, I spooned the pecans out of the original pan and topped the potatoes with it.  I also added mini marshmallows and broiled it for a few minutes...SOOOOO YUMMY!!!!!

I loved this! I was skeptical of the white sugar but it worked. Second time around I changed my method. I bought canned sweet potatoes. (already cooked) Adjusted the recipe for 20 servings.  Made a syrup out of butter, sugar and spices added a can of sliced pineapple.  (drained out the juice)Simmered it into a yummy syrup and candying the pineapple slices~ approx. 20minutes. Add the cooked drained canned sweet potatoes and gently coat them in syrup. Place in the oven on low heat. Once dish is hot put some marshmallows on top and toast.
 PS I always add more cinnamon than the recipe calls for.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I've made this three times and every time the potatoes are super mushy. I followed the recipe exactly, and got the same result- mushy potatoes. Three stars because the few potatoes that were more firm were actually really good. If only the whole batch was like those miracle potatoes. I'm lucky my boyfriend prefers mushy potatoes, so at least someone is happy.

I made this, using just 2 potatoes and cutting everything down to ratio. I used Splenda blend brown sugar instead of the sugar and I forgot to add the vanilla, but otherwise went by the directions. I then added some marshmallows and browned for about 2 minutes in the oven, as that was how my husband wanted it. It was very good. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I cooked it just 20 minutes and the potatoes were very tender. I think at an hour they would have been mush. I wouldn't think the difference would be just from the smaller quantity, but I suppose it could be.

I always use Cast Iron pans.  I've switched to Brown Sugar instead of plain Sugar.  Sometimes I use Olive Oil instead of Butter.  I use my coffee spice blend of Cinnamon, Nutmeg & Cloves (mixed in a 2/1/1 ratio). I usually add 1 Tbsp (or more) of  Vanilla Extract. I have also added fresh sliced Carrots to this mix.  You can also make Carrots by themselves in this fashion.

Super easy!! Cut into thick slices and cut in half for easier eating. Mine took far less time to cook than expected probably because I sliced the potatoes pretty thin. This is a 20 minute option if you cut the potatoes in smaller pieces.

LOVED IT! This is the first time I've made sweet potatoes that turned out this way. Even my father, the Soul Food King, ate without a negative word - which is nothing short of MIRACULOUS! I used 1-3/4 cups of sugar instead of two; I plan on trying 1-1/2 cups next time. Also, I squeezed a small lemon (Meyer) - great taste! Finally, I added a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves, a personal touch, but altogether, the flavour was PHENOMENAL! I wish I'd cut my potato slices a little thicker because once everything cooked down, it was really mashed looking overall, just a few slices of potato survived.

I had been boiling the potatoes & adding the seasonings. And they were ok. I guess I was boiling the flavor out. Cooking them in the butter made quite a difference. Thank you

I always add a cup of water or so. Comes out just as delicious. I just don't like the stickiness of just the sugar and spices on the potatoes.

I make candied sweet potatoes every Thanksgiving. This is a good recipe to follow. I bake the sweet potatoes for about 40-50 minutes or until a potato slips from a fork. I use light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also use a tablespoon of maple syrup if I don't have vanilla. I will sometimes add pecans to the baked dish. I also use real butter. The last 10-15 minutes I add marshmallows of course.

My husband said for me to throw away all the other sweet potato recipes. I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate it. I used the ingredients as written. I did not have time to follow the cooking directions so I cooked the potatoes in water in the microwave for about 12 minutes --until they were semi soft . I then followed the directions as written simmering the potatoes in a skillet on the stove for about 15 minutes. This cut the cooking time in half and still yielded a very tasty side dish.

These were the best sweet potatoes that I have in my 50 years on this planet! They were perfect in that they were tender (but not too soft) in the middle and perfectly crisp around the edges.  No more mashed yams with marshmallows in the top for this family!!

This was an excellent basic traditional sweet potato recipe.  Delicious!  Cooking on the stovetop saved precious oven space, too.

Excellent recipe! Needed this Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. One hour maybe a little bit too long, so next time I’ll cut the sweet potatoes into larger chunks.

I've made these at least a dozen times and we all LOVE them!  Can't believe I was eating the canned yams for so long!  These are fantastic and the recipe doesn't need any tweaks, exact amounts of these aren't super important.  Three jumbo Sweet Potatoes (not yams) fill my largest 18" sauce pan so that's what I use.  Sometimes I can get 4 in, they will kind of shrink down a bit as you cook, but no way could I fit 6 in one pan.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Super good! A bit too rich to have a generous portion. This would be a great side to eat with BBQ.

Perfect recipe! A cast iron skillet is the secret for crispy candied edges that aren't scorched.  I prefer sweet potatoes, because they are heartier for the long cooking time than yams. Splurge on real vanilla, and be heavy handed with it and the cinnamon!

This was amazing!! I used half white sugar and half dark brown sugar. I also only used 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I always use a few fresh slices of oranges or pineapples or about 1/4 cup of orange or pineapple juice. this recipe is definitely goi g to my favorites.

I’ve made this for a few years and it has become a Thanksgiving Day staple.  I cook it as is with one substitution.   Instead of white sugar, I use brown sugar.  All other ingredients stay the same.  I never use salt, but I could see using a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp to balance the sweetness.

Awesome recipe ... I made this with only one change ... I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar instead of two cups of white ... it came out perfect ... I would suggest cutting the potatoes in thick chunks so they do break apart too easily or become mushy !!

I boiled the sweet potatoes for about an 1 hour to soften them up. This is my second time, so I also used 2 extra sweet potatoes to help absorb some of the sweetness from the sugar. Enjoyed!

Instead of using 2 cups of white sugar I used one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar and the rest stay the same and it came out perfect.

I normally used the canned yams and doctored them up and put them in the oven. This recipe was far more easy than what I used to do because i didn't have to constantly take the pan out of the oven to stir the potatoes. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was gone in a matter of seconds.

I was hoping to replicate the side dish made by my sweetheart's aunt, what I didn't anticipate was that she would think that it tasted even better than her aunt's sweet potatoes. This one gets added to the yearly list, we love it! Cheers!

I made an early Thanksgiving dinner for my boyfriend and me this past Sunday. I used this recipe, and they were the best sweet potatoes I've ever tasted. My boyfriend is very picky, and he even said they were the best he has had. Excellent recipe. I did use 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. That was the only change that I made.

I never liked sweet potatoes until I tried this recipe.  I don't use the spices or vanilla (personal preference), but do everything else the same.  My family raves about these sweets (even others who always disliked sweet potatoes)!  I have found that they only take about 2/3 of the amount of time to get soft.

I sliced the sweet potatoes sliced thinner to help them caramelize better and have some consistency in cooking time, and I don't use as much sugar and butter, and caramelize them first then add sweet potatoes. I use a non stick skillet, which helps. If you have kids that do not like sweet potatoes try this recipe.  Plus it's a step in getting kids and adults on their way to liking sweet potatoes if they don't already.

Oh my gosh - Best sweet potatoes ever! I. Followed one of the reviews and used brown sugar instead of white. Although I have used cinnamon with sweet potatoes before, I think the nutmeg really made this recipe! This will become a family favorite!

So for those of you who don't want to wait a full hour allow me to tell you a secret. Keep recipe as is, just turn the fire up to 7 (between high and medium) and bring the liquid to a boil. While boiling, add a lid and cook about 15-20 minutes or until caramelized. Turn heat to low, remove lid, add vanilla and simmer until ready to serve. Great recipe!

I made it using half brown and half white sugar. I had to cook in 2 batches cuz even my big pan wouldn't hold them all. My only problem is they began to break apart a bit after only about half an hour. Still tasted great though. I also added marshmallows and baked just to melt.

This has become my favorite way to prepare sweet potatoes.  I add a little less sugar than the recipe calls for (it can become too sweet for some).  This recipe is also good if you use a replace regular butter with a vegan alternative for people with restricted diets.  It's easy to tweak and always a crowd pleaser.

I also peel and slice my potatoes it gives it a texture when eating....I also add brown sugar usually put in oven on low but putting on the stove top I will try I take it that its faster to cook that way.

I used brown sugar instead of white because I just happen to like the flavor better. This was a perfect dish. And it also was the first time I ever tried sweet potatoes. Glad I found this recipe!

I've made sweet potato casserole before, but I really prefer candied sweet potatoes.  This recipe was so easy and tasted great.  The cooking time was shorter then the recipe called for but that's probably because I cut my yams smaller.  I made my sugar mixture a couple of days in advance and cut my yams the day before and stored them in a zip bag with as much air removed as possible.  This was my first attempt at candied yams and I'm saving the recipe, everyone love them.

I just made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they all went. That's unusual because my group doesn't typically go for this dish and I only make it because it's a traditional Thanksgiving dish. I had read over quite a few recipes before I settled on this one so I decided to go half granulated sugar and half (dark) brown sugar. I used 8 big yams but it was still very saucy, not that anyone seemed to mind! I prepared them stovetop in a really big skillet so they weren't at all overcrowded and stirred about every 10 minutes, they were done in about 30 minutes. I transferred them to a glass serving bowl and kept them in a warm oven for about 3 hours before serving. Since they were so easy and such a hit I will probably stick with this recipe. Thanks!

Cooked yams in crockpot for about 3 hours on high with 1 cup water.  Cooked sauce on stovetop, added to crockpot and cooked for another hour. My new favorite way to make sweet potatoes - loved the cinnamon & nutmeg flavor.

I always feel pressure to cook for my mom and sister because they are amazing cooks.  I tried this recipe and didn't change a thing.  They were both doubting me the whole time it cooked saying there was not enough liquid in there but they all loved it in the end.  Even my teenage nephew said how good they were and wanted to make sure they got to take the leftovers home.  Phew!!

Love this recipe! I usually use canned yams just to eliminate a little bit of time, and I also add brown sugar in with the mixture, about the same amount as regular sugar.  After adding vanilla, I pour it into a serving pan, and set my oven on broil and still top with marshmallows for the 'traditional' twist and brown the marshmallows for a couple seconds, then serve! Love the candied yams more than any other cook style of yams!

This was the EASIEST recipe I've made for sweet potatoes  and they are sooooo delicious!  It makes a lot, so next time I'll make just half, however, they are just as good the next day!  This is my absolute go to from here on out for a "dressed up" sweet instead of just baked in the oven whole.

Made for Thanksgiving 2014.  Be sure to peel the potatoes well--if you leave any of the gray stuff just under the skin the finished product will be very gray and unappetizing looking.    I had to throw out 1st batch because of this!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was the best sweet potato dish I have ever had.  Very much like you would find in a all southern food restaurant.  I did mine in a French oven on the stove but followed the recipe as is.  I will make this again.

Followed the ingredients in this recipe to a "T" and it came out very good!  The only thing I changed was that I cut the sweet potatoes into chunks instead of slicing them to make stirring while cooking easier.  Great for Easter dinner!

I used brown sugar in place of white sugar and only the butter as I don't care for cinnamon/nutmeg in my potatoes. I really liked the texture of the potato as I've been looking for a dish with the sweetness and original texture of the sweet potato. I do have to say I used Sugar Twin brown sugar and there was a funky aftertaste so next time I'll use regular brown sugar

This dish was simple and perfect. My family and I love sweet potatoes. But a lot of time they would purchase the canned sweet pirates and prep that way. I'm actually making a second batches because the first was devoured in one day. I chose to omit the nutmeg and use 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar as previous review. #Delish definitely a staple side dish for our family holidays. Thanks you!

Loved this recipe! Made it for my family Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I was even surprised it turned out so tasty. I was fearful of having my potatoes crumble or be underdone, so I did stick with my usual method of washing and boiling the potatoes first. I monitor them by pricking with a fork for doneness. I cook a lot at a time, so softer ones get used for pies since they will be mashed anyway and the firmer ones I use for the recipe. Boiling first means once they cool, I can peel almost all of them by hand, the skin raises up and just comes right off. It's stickier, but easier than peeling raw. I used half sugar and half dark brown sugar like some of the other comments. I put the sliced potatoes in a baking dish, poured a little of the melted butted over them, the rest of the butter went into the sugar mixtures. I then gently incorporated the sugar butter mixture into the potatoes so that they were covered but not handling them too much so they wouldn't break up. I then covered with foil and put them in a 350 oven. I'm not sure of timing, maybe half hour then I uncovered for nother half hour or so. Mostly I just "eyeballed" it. I removed when the sugar was brown and bubbly. There may be small clumps of unmelted sugar coating, but it makes a nice addition and texture. This is especially good if you have to heat it in the microwave because it will then melt down more. I love vanilla, but forgot it! No problem...these are sweet and flavorful. My new go to recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday for our Labor Day cookout today. Let me tell you what I did right off the top because I sensed 2 c of sugar was too much for my liking. I used three medium sized sweet potatoes and reduced the sugar to 1/3c brown and 1/3 white. I cooked them in the oven in a casserole dish covered with foil for one hour which allowed the lightly sweetened, yet delicious syrup to penetrate each quarter inch thick sweet potato, making them nice and yummy . Aside from that everything else I followed to the letter.  These are by far the BEST candied sweet potatoes I've had in my 42 years on earth! I will be making this recipe my default for all upcoming holidays and I am so thankful that I found this recipe that uses common cupboard items. I wish I could rate it 10 stars because it is truly worthy.

It's so good. My daughter loved the sweetness of the sugar. I didn't have two cups of white sugar so I used a bit of brown I love it so much.

this is a wonderful recipe, I've made it twice now. After reading a few of the leading reviews, I did reduce sugar and butter significantly. Next time I will reduce even more! You want just enough butter and sugar to coat the bottom of the pan; more than this boils the potatoes vs candying them.  I am cutting down butter and sugar to 1/4 what the recipe calls for. Simmer covered for 20 minutes to soften the potatoes, then increase temp to low uncovered stirring frequently. Be extra careful not to burn the sugar - doing so will ruin your dish.

For the most part, I followed this recipe; however, I did incorporate some changes. First, I peeled, sliced, and boiled the sweet potatoes until they were tender, but not falling apart. Second, while the potatoes were boiling, I cooked the sugar mixture in a pan on the stove (btw, I DOUBLED the sugar mixture - my family likes SWEET potatoes). When the potatoes were finished boiling, I drained them and placed them in a metal sheet pan and poured the sugar mixture over them. Next, I covered the pan with aluminum foil and let it sit for a few hours so that the potatoes could absorb the sugar mixture. Then, I baked the dish on 350 for 20 minutes, removed the foil and poured some marshmallows on top, put the dish back in the oven and set it to broil 400 for five minutes. It was a HIT at Thanksgiving so I'm making again for Christmas. Thank you!!

Just made these for Thanksgiving 2013.  But I changed recipe a bit... used 1 stick butter since I was using 8 yams... and totally skipped the white sugar. Instead used 1 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup real Penna maple syrup  with the other listed ingredients!   My 8 guests just raved over them... even my adult son and brother who never liked candied yams or sweet potatoes liked them a lot.

Super easy, super yummy. Mine were still pretty soupy after an hour so I just took off the top and let the syrup reduce. Definitely my go to sweet potato recipe now. Oh and I did half white half brown sugar. Sooo good!

Made for Easter. Everyone loved them. I reduced the sugar a bit and added some marshmallows...not because it needed them but because the family threatened to throw me into the insane asylum when I told them I wasn't going to use them!

I make mine like that except for the spices. I also brown them a little bit in "bacon grease" before adding the sugar. Add sugar then put on the lid, turn fire down to simmer, let simmer for about 20 miniutes.........and yummy. THanks for the recipes, i will try the spices.

This is wonderful! I cut back on the amount of sugar and used brown instead of white. By adding the vanilla, it was still sweet enough for us. No changes other than that. My husband had seconds. Definitely added to my recipes.

I made these tonight. They were very good! My 84 year old Mother even ate seconds, which is rare because she is SO picky. I forgot the vanilla, but will definitely make these again (& add vanilla) since they are so easy & good.

This recipe turned out perfectly. It was my first attempt at making homemade candied yams and it was definitely worth the work!!!  I slightly modified the recipe by adding a tablespoon of dark brown sugar.  Everyone loved them at dinner!

Yummy, and we forgot the vanilla at the end.  I scaled it down to four servings and decreased the sugar a little.  I also used half regular and half brown.  It came out just as described in the directions.  We'll make it again.

I made Thanksgiving dinner (minus the turkey!) and Dad requested candied yams... in my 26 years we'd never had them before in our house.  Though this wasn't what he had in mind (it wasn't like my grandma's I guess), he and the rest of us enjoyed it very much.  Easy, and very sweet and tender.

My family LOVED these potatoes and could not get enough. Even my husband who usually doesn't like sweet potatoes had some.

Oh so yummy!! I made them last night for our late Christmas party. Everyone loved them. I used 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar. I think next time I will use 1 or 2 more potatoes (mine may have been smaller?)as I seemed to have a lot of extra sauce. Luckily I had some left overs-so I had them for lunch today-still just as yummy as yesterday!  Thanks for the recipe!

Although I couldn't get them to 'candy', or harden at the edges as described, these were, as my husband put it, better than a roll in the hay, or words to that effect. I must have had too small a quantity of yams, or too much sugar mixture. But boy, were they good!!

a little overly sweet (but I liked it that way), make sure not to cut the potatoes too thin like I did, it gets gooey, even though it cooks much faster. just as good reheated

I found out why this recipe got such good reviews. Very, very good. As a kid I didn't care much for sweet potatoes but decided to make them for Thanksgiving because they are a favorite of my fathers. Everyone was impressed. It will be a regular every year from now on.

The flavor was awesome and the potatoes were so tender. I do like the sauce a little sticky maybe I'll try adding a little more brown sugar next time.

Delicious. It cooked down more than I anticipated so I would've used more sweet potatoes, but the flavor was divine. Huge hit!

This is a great, easy recipe.  The sweet potatoes do not need par boiling or pre-cooking.  I forgot the vanilla at the end and don't really think they need it.  The dish is very sweet and yummy!

These are great.  Very easy to make and very tasty.  The only problem is that they are rather sweet so I can't eat too many at a time.

These candied sweet potatoes were wonderful!  I didn't use the vanilla, but followed the recipe except for that exclusion and my family loved them. I did put a few marshmallows on top, but they really weren't necessary.  Just made the dish prettier.  I will definately make this many more times.

I did it!  No more dried out recipes!!!  I finally have a candied yams dish to share with family and friends.  I've made it twice in three days, using 1/2 brown and white sugars.  I also added pineapple chunks out of habit. Thank!

Absolutely the best I've ever tasted. I used yams (maybe its the same thing). I never made candied yams/sweet potatoes from scratch, ever. I thought it would be too difficult. After it was done cooking, I added marshmallows and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. I will make this over and over again.

These were a hit - we had two guests who had never had sweet potatoes before - what a great introduction...and my husband (who loves sweet potatoes) said they were the best he's ever had.  This will be a part of our thanksgiving meal from now on.

Excellent side dish. My whole family loved them. Didn't have nutmeg so used allspice instead. If you like soft potatoes like us, slice thin.

delicious! I loved the fact that it cooked on the stove top.  I did cut down on the sugar and used brown instead of white.  I used about a cup of sugar instead of two.  otherwise, I followed it to a tee!!

This was an easy break from regular Russet Potatoes. The only thing I would have done different was to slice the potatoes a little thicker. I used the side of a grater and they were too thin. I will certainly make this again.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  The result was wonderfully tasty, but when the sweet potatoes were done, there was still some runny liquid in the bottom of the pan. A slotted spoon solves the problem easily.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  The result was wonderfully tasty, but when the sweet potatoes were done, there was still some runny liquid in the bottom of the pan. A slotted spoon solves the problem easily.

These are so good! I've tried other sweet potato recipes but this one is certainly a keeper.  I omitted the nutmeg because I didn't have any but the end result was still fantastic.  I received lots of great comments on this dish Christmas day.
