I have this exact recipe that I got from the lady I used to babysit for when I was 13 (I'm 40 now...yikes).  It's only different in the way that the marshmallows are not added to the batter.  I suppose it has morphed like tons of other recipes...but adding the marshmallows to the batter makes it a lot more gooey (although it is called "mud" pie).  For this recipe, in my opinion, it works better if you put the marshmallows on top after it's baked and cook it for 2 more minutes until the marshmallows melt.  Then let it cool and frost with chocolate frosting and sprinkle with nuts when the frosting is soft.

If you need a chocolate fix, this is it!  There is more sugar than needed in this recipe.  I cut it down to 1-1/2 cups for the brownie (the flour/sugar ratio should be the same).  Instead of mixing the marshmallows into the batter I just scattered about 1 cup of them on top and then baked as directed.  Don't add 4 cups of confectioners' sugar to the frosting!  I used a generous 2 cups and it was plenty sweet. These were a huge hit in my house.

Wow!!  Very rich, and very good!  My family has had this recipe for years.  The only difference is that we cover the brownies with the marshmallows after they've baked (as one reviewer suggested), so that they have their own layer.  Very pretty when cut and served!  Thanks for the recipe!

Eeeyikes!  This recipe is waaaay too sweet.  2 cups of sugar AND a pound of powdered sugar AND marshmallows!  I took these brownies to a gathering and was embarrassed as it wasn't a hit. If I ever make this again, I'm using 1/2 the sugar!!

These are dangerously delicious!  I made the brownie with 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups and made 1/2 the frosting and they were still perfect for flavor.  They are a little bit messy to serve but the taste is well worth it!

These are deliciously sinful! The recipe comments indicate they are sweet, so I don't understand the surprise of the critical rater. Couldn't you figure out from the list of ingredients before you made these that they'd be really SWEET??????

I'm not allowed to make any other desserts... This one is in very high demand. I've made it 4-5 times already and it actually turns out a little different each time....

This dish was devoured by my health conscious sister-in-law and her boyfriend before and after they hit the slopes. It had such an impact that they even dream about them! I omitted the nuts, and they were just as good.

This recipe was good. Left out the nuts due to allergies. I did omit 1 cup powdered sugar from the frosting. It would've been way to sweet otherwise. Not my favorite brownie recipe, but my father-in-law said that these were the best brownies he has had in a long time and he is the king of sweets here, so he would know. I'll be keeping this recipe just for him.

Theese are really sweet, but they are good. 

i tried it to duplicate a brownie that i had in a resturant and it was really close. 

i really suggest halfing this recipe because it it too much unless you have a lot of people to eat them.

Wow, was I disappointed in these.  I'm really sorry to do this, because I have never left a bad review for a recipe, but these did not work.  I am a regular and experienced baker, and I followed the recipe as written.  What resulted was a gooey, sweet mess.  I gave it two stars because the kids ate them, but they were impossible to cut, did not look very good, and dit not have a great chocolate flavor.  All you taste is sweet melted marshmallow, and you never get chocolate.  If you like extremely sweet things, plan on scooping these out with a spoon, because they will not cut.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  Excellent flavor but very sweet----just the way I like it!  I tried it different ways.  It works best by adding the marshmallows and letting them melt on the top for just a few minutes before the the brownie is done.  When cooled then add the icing.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this recipe for the holidays.  Very disappointed.  I baked longer than the directions called for.  Still didn't seem done.  Also, the picture shows like a marshmallow center, but that can't happen then the marshmallows are mixed in the batter.

Liked but didn't love.  I decided to not mix the marshmallows into the batter, but put them ontop of the baked bottom.  That worked out fine and so did the topping but for some reason my bottom did not bake entirely so I was left with mushy uncooked goop.  I even baked for 5 minutes longer than needed.  Not sure what happened.  Maybe someone else has a pointer for me so I can give them another shot.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 the sugar in the brownie and 1/2 the confectioner's sugar for the frosting so it wouldn't be so sweet. I chose to mix the marshmallows into the brownie mix. It was delicious! I've made these twice now and the second time turned out better then the first!

Just the brownie recipe was really easy. I did increase the cocoa powder to a half cup. I'll update how the family liked it after dinner.

These are so yummy!  I don't want to gain 10 lbs. so I cut the recipe in half.  I only used 2/3 cup sugar in the brownie part and a little less than 1.5 cups in the frosting.  They are still super sweet!  Very good though.  I substitued 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour.  I also put the marshmallows over the top of the baked brownies and let them melt down in the oven a little, instead of putting them inside the brownies.  I spread the frosting over the marshmallow layer.  I only needed a TBS. of milk for the frosting.  They are so delicious, my kids and I couldn't wait to dig in!  For anyone concerned about the nutritional info on the recipe page, keep this in mind: the recipe says, for some reason, that it serves 6, down near the bottom of the page where it says "Customize this recipe".  On the top of the recipe, it says it serves 20, so I don't know what's going on there.  Anyways, if you cut a 9x13 pan into only 6 servings, yes it would be really bad, but I'm guessing most people won't do that.  So enjoy, in moderation!  ;)

These turned out very good. It was my fault that I undercooked them which made them a little messy when serving. But the next day the were PERFECT! Great flavor! I made these for my dad and served them with French Vanilla ice cream and he loved them. Next time I will cook them a little longer, and allow them to cool a little longer before serving. Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend says these are the best brownies I've ever made.  I've never made bars w/ marshmallows before, but I will again.  Yum!  These were rich enough for me without the frosting, but next time I will add more cocoa or even chocolate chips for more chocolate flavor.

My husband made these and we thought they were AMAZING! We had to put them into the fridge over night, so we could cut them in squares. When we cut them an hour after we made them they weren't hard enough, we ended up eating them with spoons in a bowl. Still very good! The next day they were firm, but still very moist and they tasted great! The sweetness was perfect for us. ANOTHER DAY: So we decided to put the marshmallows on top instead of mixed in. DON'T DO IT!! It didn't work well for us. Mixed in is the way to go.

This is an awesome recipe! I make this for my work. They call it "chocolate crack" LOL It is so sinful. I have changed the recipe slightly but the main thing is I only use Ghiraldelli chocolate and cocoa.

My mom used to make a recipe like this when I was little.  I thoroughly enjoyed the recipe, however I felt there was more sugar than needed in it.  While it was very very good, I feel I could have added about 1/3 less sugar and the recipe would have been even better.  I also added the marshmallows after the initial baking and baked them an additional 2-3 min and let cooled.  Overall, this was a hit.  I omitted the pecans and thought it was great without.  I would make again, with the noted adjustments.

Wow, these were so gooey and good.  I added chocolate chunks and white chocolate chips o the batter.  I followed the advice of some others and layered the marshmallows on top, but I don't think I'll do that again.

Yum, yum, yum!!! Sooo sweet and chocolatey...the only thing I noticed is that it took less milk than called for in the recipe for the icing.

Added the marshmellows on top per another's suggestion.  Boyfriend and I were not crazy about these the first day (more of a cake than a brownie to me), but both agreed it was better the next day.  It was a hit when I served it day-old.  And the frosting is delicious if you are looking for a good, fudgey frosting!

Very good but very gooey.  I don't really like rocky road ice cream because of the marshmallows and felt the same way about these brownies.  Will definately make again but without the marshmallows and without pecans.

This is the best brownies I have ever tasted.  In one month I have made it 2 times already.  It is very rich and if you like your brownies more like fudge then this is definately a recipe you will like.

These are definitely delicious!  Yes, they are super-gooey and wet, so that is why they don't get the full five stars.  They are hard to manage or serve to a crowd other than family.  They were wonderful without the frosting.  I will make these again!

I made these for a bake sale for my niece.  They were a big hit.  The only problem was that even after spraying my pan with Pam, it still stuck to the pan.

very sweet, true, but it's been a big hit in my family. It's good eaten warm and it's good eaten the day after. Don't know about many days after, as it didn't resist so long:-)

This was very good.  I actually preferred it a little warm.  It tasted a lot like Texas sheet cake to me.  I halved the frosting recipe and found that to be just right for our tastes, and we like sweet things.  I had no idea that marshmellows would melt into the batter like that and be so good!

I made these last night and was very dissapointed. While the flavor was ok....they did not hold up well at all. I let them cool completely and then tried to cut them but they basically fell apart. I am soon to be starting a catering business and with one of the small jobs that I had for today...they were one of the things that I used and being that our power went out last night...there was not time to make anything else. I tried to refridgerate them and they seemed to have held together a little bit but once they have sat out for a while...I am hoping that they do not turn into a soggy mess. Obviously...I will not be making these again and I just wished that I would have tested them first before deciding to put them on the menu.

I guess there's different ways you can make it,  picture shows marshmallows on top, or you can mix the marshmallows in the batter,  I  mixed in batter cause I like them melted, mmmmm,,  they was pretty good!

Followed the recipe to the letter, except for subbing Can't Believe It's Not for the butter. (Kind of like ordering a Diet Coke with fast food. I know.) Like other reviewers, I second just spreading the marshmallows on top -- just to make it look prettier, because I mixed the mallows in the batter and now my brownies look a little, er, stretchy. Also, really only make half the recipe as posted. Which leads to my next point: the poster wasn't kidding about these being rich. You'll really only eat a 1x1 inch piece before feeling like your head might pop from a sugar overdose -- this is not a dessert that goes quickly.

I took the advice of another user and halved the sugar since a lot of reviews said they were too sweet. I don't know if that's exactly was went wrong, but these brownies came out bland and hard as bricks! I took them to a potluck and was embarassed to say I had made them. Certainly won't be making these again.

I'm not sure exactly what went wrong. My brownies turned into a cake-like mess. My marshmallows melted into it and became flaky. The brownies took forever to bake. The inside was raw and the outside was crunchy. The frosting was a little dry, so I added more milk and there was way to much powdered sugar. However, after tasting the frosting recipe if one uses half the powdered sugar, adds more butter and less milk and refrigerates for 30 minutes, it makes a quick and easy fudge recipe.

Oh, wow that is sweet!  I remembered these from my childhood, and these really hit the spot.  Even if I can only eat them a little tiny piece at a time.  I followed the directions exact, but next time I will listen to the other reviews and put the marshmallows on top.

These were not good. They didn't come out right, and they really didn't taste good.
