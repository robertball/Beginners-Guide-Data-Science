Wow! What a tasty meal! The only difference I made was to use cut up chicken breast instead of boni- in pieces and it turned out great. I can't wait to make this for my friends.

This was really yummy! My whole family loved it so much! Instead of the brown rice i used jasmine rice and put a dash of cinnomon(sp?lol) and tumeric(sp?again lol!) in to give more flavor and it was seriouly amazing! I also used chicken breast rather than the pieces and it was great! I would recomend this dish to anyone that likes to try new things (:

Followed the recipe exactly to the letter. Produced a lovely exotic taste (marinated 24 hrs). Could have been a '5' but I blew it by: not having a tight-fitting lid on the skillet and cooking too long - sauce was cooked off by the time I served..

THIS DISH IS AMAZING!!!!! I am 13 and I LOVE to cook. I wanted to try something new and this was perfect. I actually made this for my class of 31 students and they ate a whole large crock pot full of it I have to admit it looks disgusting... but it's one of the best things i have EVER had!

My husband made this for dinner and it was FANTASTIC! Easy to do and tastes great! I recommend this to everyone. We didn't have sherry or dried oregano so we used apple-cider vinegar and a couple of drops of oregano oil from my DoTerra oils. We also diced the fruit so there wasn't big chunks to deal with. It had very good flavor and a nice sauce. Can't wait to do this again!!

Very good but not 5-star good. The flavors in the marinade did blend very well. I usually don't like dried fruit in savory dishes but I added the apricots and prunes anyways and it actually worked okay. If you like dried fruit in these types of dishes then you'll probably love this.

I think that perhaps the few who said this lacked flavour might have been using old spices that had lost their punch. This turned out beautifully for me love the kick from the acid from the lemon especially. I used chicken legs might try skinless thighs and/or drums next time to cut down on the fat.

I was disappointed. Mine tasted a bit grainy from all the spices and mostly just soy sauce. It was aesthetically unappealing. I'm going to try to doctor it a bit today by adding some sugar to balance out the flavors.

I was excited to try this dish because of all of the interesting spices. Unfortunately it just tasted like soy sauce over chicken.

This was very tasty just as others have said. It did look kind of gross but very tasty. I let it sit in the marinade in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours before I cooked it. Thank you.

Delicious! Don't be tempted to add extra fruit to the recipe though. I tried this and it makes the sauce a bit too sweet. My notes on the recipe: http://fluffernutters.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/moroccan-chicken-sann-1-21-2010/

Liked it. I increased the curry by half and added two jalopenos to the marinade. If I make it again I will decrease the soy sauce by about a third. Overall good easy recipe.

Exotic and delicious; a great change of pace. I used chicken cutlets cut into chunks and marinated them for over 12 hours - that ramps up the flavor a lot. I didn't have brandy so I subbed with one part apple cider vinegar to one part water and a spoon of sugar. In order to stretch this and give it even more flavor I started the cooking by sauteing three onions until translucent and then added the chicken and fruit. The onions were a great addition. Thanks for a winner.

The citrus content is rather high. I could feel it in my throat when I was done eating. When I make it again I'll decrease the lemon by 1/3 in an effort to retain the flavor but lose a little of the pucker.

Good, but WAY too sweet. Half a cup of honey would have been plenty.

I made this and I could tell by the ingredients it was going to be one of my favorites! It turned out perfect! I didn't use the apricots & prunes though but my family still loved it!

Let me start by saying this recipe is fantastic! I made this exactly as stated (marinated for about 8 hours) and the only thing I was not a fan of were the prunes. They were a bit too sweet for the dish. Other than that I love it. This is what I cook when I really want to impress my date.

As far as I know I followed the recipe exactly all of the great reviews had me excited to make it! Unfortunately my version tasted extremely pungent soysaucey overpowering with sodium flavour that I could not get around even after draining the sauce and trying to thin it out. My only guess is maybe I did some steps wrong because I can't imagine people enjoyed as much as they're saying.
