We use a LOT of Cavender's in this house, and this seasoning blend is just as good-- in fact, it's better! Per the optional instructions, I blended the mix into a fine powder (using a food processor). Freshly blending the dried herbs and spices in small batches makes for a wonderfully pungent and flavorful seasoning for just about anything. I considered making a large batch of it, but I like the idea of making the suggested amount as needed; it'll last about a week in our kitchen, and it's totally worth making a new batch every few days in order to get that "just ground" flavor.

I used this recipe as a seasoning for grilled chicken breasts today, and the flavor was fantastic. I'm fairly confident we won't be buying the big "C" again any time soon. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for something close to the blend at one of our favorite local restaurants, and this is wonderful! Put a few pinches of this on a plate, and add some olive oil, and swirl to mix together. Use as a dip or spread for some homemade crusty sourdough bread, and you have a treat!

Yum! I realized half way through making Kalamata Lemon Chicken that I was out of Greek seasoning, and after going to the market only to realize they don't carry it, I thought I was SOL. Thank you All Recipes and the cook who submitted this recipe. I made this seasoning true to the recipe, didn't change a thing. This recipe saved dinner! ;) Everyone loved it!

I needed Greek seasoning to make 'Greek Pulled Pork' from AR.  I like making my own seasonings as I can control what goes in them.  This worked nicely on the pork and I have some left for other recipes.  I did not blend in a grinder for a finer texture.  I just mixed everything together and put in a shaker spice jar.

I made this for another recipe on this site "Greek-Seasoned T-Bone Steaks with Cucumber and Tomato Salad".  Not only was it easy, but it was so good!  I highly recommend this in place of a premixed one any day!   Thanks for the recipe :-)

I'll never buy the pre-made stuff again! This was really easy. I had everything on hand but the dried parsley - didn't miss it. I do think that the cinnamon is overpowering. The next time I make it, I will cut that in half. Otherwise, this is a keeper!

This was... Odd. Very odd. Made it as directed. The nutmeg and cinnamon were by far the dominant smells of this before using and after cooking.

You know those Greek fries that you order at restaurants, but can never seem to replicate at home? This is your solution. Make a batch of this and you can use the mixture anytime you're craving delicious Greek french fries!

Was awesome on a pork tenderloin. Mashed it all over the loin, seared it on high heat with olive oil and then roasted it until done. Rave reviews!

YUM! I used this blend for a chicken dish that called for Greek Seasoning. I will never buy the stuff from the store. I added much less salt (maybe 1/2 tsp) just because I don't like adding extra salt to my dishes until I am ready to serve them. The spice blend was outstanding!! My husband came home from work and immediately said 'It smells good in here - like a Mediterranean or Greek restaurant!' Thank you so much for sharing!

Super easy to make w/spice cabinet staples when a recipe calls for "Greek Seasoning".  I'm looking forward to getting lots of use out of this, starting w/a Greek Pulled Pork tomorrow!  Thanks for the recipe, Misty!

Just like the Greek spice I usually use! Except....only cost about 50 cents to make. I mostly used bulk spices or dollar store bottles, total investment $10 but have enough spice to make the equivalent of at least 10 cans...yes, I use this a lot!

I started about half amount of the cinnamon and nutmeg, just because it sounded a little odd, but it was quite good!  Not sure if I'll go full strength on those two things next time, but was pleasantly surprised!

Left out the corn starch, as I cannot tolerate corn ANYTHING, and substituted fresh rosemary & basil for the dried, at a 1/4 to 1 ratio. Turned out fairly close to the original so, yes, I will make it again!

This was FANTASTIC! The only spice/herb I didn't have was marjoram, which I will use next time I make this. I substituted dried mint for the marjoram, and it was still amazing. I pan fried some chicken and used just some lemon juice, and this spice mix. Thank you Misty for sharing this!

This is a very wonderful blend.  I will keep it in my pantry to use for many things---from chicken to pork.  It's really good.  It was especially good on the Greek-Seasoned T-Bone Steaks with Cucumber and Tomato Salad that I made from this site.  You should try it!

Excellent!  I’ve never used (or heard of)  “Greek Seasoning” before, but my recipe called for it. I scoured the spice shelves of Harris Teeter, Winn Dixie and Publix and it was nowhere to be found. I made my own using this blend and it was amazing!  I will continue to make this and keep it on hand!!  Thanks for the help!!!

Used this recipe as a rub for chicken. Horrible doesn’t begin to describe the final flavor. I followed the recipe to the letter. This is a cinnamon recipe not Greek. Searching for a different recipe and throwing away the leftovers.

I used half the amount of cinnamon, as a matter of preference.  It's EXCELLENT.   The picture is our 'sand art' prior to mixing ;-)

I was cooking a Greek dinner when I realized I had no prepared Greek Seasoning. This recipe saved dinner and was as good as pre-packaged.

Loved it! Making my 2nd batch. I tripled the measurements and made a jar labeled Greek Seasoning.  I use on chicken and pork.

This was extremely easy to put together and the taste is great. I ground mine with a mortar and pestle to get a finer mix.

I needed a Greek seasoning for a pork dish and didn't have any on hand. So, I made this since I had all the ingredients in the pantry. I'm not sure if this the flavor of the pork recipe had intended, but it was AWESOME! Even the picky husband liked it. Will be making more to keep on hand.

Very good however I cut the cinnamon in half and still found it to much.
Next time I will cut it back even more and also use less nutmeg .

This is an absolute gem! I combined everything, then ran it through my spice grinder until it was a uniform powder. Used it in a gyros loaf and it was brilliant.

Love IT... I'll probably never buy the pre-made Fix available in stores... since I found this recipe... I much prefer homemade over store bought any day of the week....just wish I have thought ahead when I got done making a single serving size of it... and actually done the whole 8 servings last night.... Now I have to make more so I not only have it "readily on hand" but need some for tonight's dinner. However, when I make it this time... I am going to use the full recipe on serving size and I'll take a pic of it.... will post end result pic at that time.

This worked out perfectly.  I stuck to the recipe--but I will have to triple the recipe because I generally make all my own "Nationality Seasonings" and keep them in those wonderful lidded see through jars with labels and display them.   This recipe just barely came up to the 1/2" mark on the jar.  But definitely a wonderful addition.

OMG this was awesome!  followed the recipe but without the cinnamon and nutmeg - persona preference.  ground it up in a mortar/pestle.  Marinated presliced "sirloin steak for stir fry" at room temp for 1 hour before a quick stir fry.  served with tazicki.  Excellent!!

Make this often and we use it on everything.  Love using dried herbs from our garden!  I leave out cinnamon and salt (add that to the dish) but otherwise it's the same as the recipe.  Quadruple it and share a bottle with a friend!

I may not be the best one to review this because I have never even tasted Greek seasoning before. However, I loved it in the Greek pulled pork recipe and have been trying it on everything else, even popcorn. This is yummy.

Added great flavor to my Pan Seared Swai. Even though the amount was not significant, I substituted almond flour for the cornstarch due to dietary concerns. Can't wait to try it on other items!

Great blend of flavors, even though they may seem an odd combo. I didn't have marjoram so as 1 suggested, I added mint, but just pinch of  dried peppermint. I have fresh rosemary so I didn't add the dried, just added the fresh to the chicken dish I made. With this & other ingredients from a Grecian Chicken recipe  from a magazine, my husband liked it & wanted to know what kind of meat it was!

This recipe is a very pleasing blend of spices. My husband kept commenting on how good the house smelled when I was cooking. The end results where FANTASTIC!! He said he knew it was a beef dish, but it tasted like lamb with the spices I had used!! Very pleased and will definitely be using often!!!

Although the cinnamon and nutmeg are very strong scents in this mix, the taste of them isn't very strong when cooked with something. I used this for chicken cooking seasoning for a Greek salad and it was great!

so much better to make own seasoning than buying it prepared. Able to add a bit more of a spice that you want to emphasize.

I was looking specifically for a Greek seasoning blend, because my grocery store doesn't carry anything by that name.  I figured that I could mix one up myself.  That's how I came upon the seasoning blend recipe. I do have to say, that I often us many of the seasonings listed, with the exception of cinnamon and nutmeg, as I don't use those in my dinner foods.

This is great!  I make a recipe for souvlaki that calls for Greek Seasoning and inevitably my husband has use it all.  We don't like savory dishes that have cinnamon and nutmeg, so I just added the smallest pinch of both.

This will be a staple in my panty.

I love this stuff! I make ground beef/lamb kebabs by making a long skinny patty around the skewers and rolling in the seasoning mix. So good! Also great on roasted chicken thighs/drumsticks! I make it with tablespoons instead of teaspoons, and measure straight into a jar, screw the lid on and give it a shake to mix!

I made this exactly as directed for a Greek chicken & potato bake, and it was incredible.

I was out of Cavender's couldn't find any anywhere and had my heart set on making my favorite chicken recipe so I gave this recipe a try. I had almost everything on hand, just needed to grab two spices. It's good but all I can taste is the nutmeg. I think if I made it again I may not use the nutmeg or use less. Worked in a pinch for me though!

I skip the cinnamon, marjoram and cornstarch when I make the mix but it is still amazing flavor to me! Love this!

I put this spice mix together this evening to use on some chicken breast. It was absolutely delicious! Really fresh tasting with a bit of sweetness. It was a huge hit in our house.

I love being able to make my own seasoning at home. This was easy and tasted good. I dialed back cinnamon and nutmeg since I'm not a huge fan of using these generally in savory cooking.

Made the recipe exactly as listed.  Followed preparation instructions as stated. Did not use a food processor to finely grind the spices. Liked the texture of the spices.  Wonderful aroma.  A great way to use up pantry staples.  Love the process of blending my own spice mixes.  Am planning to use this on the AR recipe for Greek Pulled Pork.

I used this to season some frozen cheesesteak cuts as a quick fix for gyro meat... Straight awesome... Straight legit.

I used this instead of store bought seasoning and it worked very well! Used it to make the low carb beef and cabbage soup. Delicious!
