This was a great simple pasta that could accompany just about anything!  All of my guests loved it & it's so simple!  I only had about half of the chicken broth it called for so I substituted water with chicken bouillian for the rest.  I also used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and it still turned out great!

Very bland.  Needs more seasonings.  Not sure what kind but needs more taste.
