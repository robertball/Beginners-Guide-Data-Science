Delicious.  This is a great recipe to start, but has a lot of room for you to make it your own.  I had to add 5 cups of water to the final product to finally get the consistency I was looking for.

I really liked the idea of this soup, it was really, really thick though. If we try this one again I think I would use half the amount of potatoes and carrots. Kudo's for originality! what a great idea, thanks for the recipe. :)

I used beef broth instead of water and added shredded cabbage, diced zucchini, less potatoes,shredded spinach. can diced tomatoes, marinara or spaghetti sauce, light red or white beans. To make it thicker I added some refied beans. The rest was fine. Just a thought.

great way to get those who don't like them to eat their veggies! I added a bit of sugar because I like it.

Excellent! My whole family enjoyed this soup. We liked the thickness of it..very hearty! It would be fine as is, however I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and a bit of olive oil. Thanks for a great healthy and delicious soup.

We really enjoyed this soup.  I do not have a food processor so I used my blender instead.  The kids liked the taste and with it blended together they couldn't see the vegetables to pick them out, that was the best part!!

I added some ground Hot Italian sausage to this soup to give it more substance.  It was even better the next day!!

Really bland.  I think it needs some acid (lemon juice or vinegar).  My husband put Sriachi in it after I served it to him, if that gives you an idea of how bland it is.  Might be a good base recipe but definitely needs some adjustments.

I don't have a food precessor, so I skip that step and leave it chunky.  It is a great healthy soup.
