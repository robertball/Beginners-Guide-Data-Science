People that change the ingredients and then say it was not as good as they thought it would be make me crazy.  Make it like it is or keep pour comments to yourself.  This was very good just as it was.

This dish is fabulous. I changed a couple things, of course! I used fresh green beans and made this in my slow cooker. I added a lot more bacon and a little bit of sugar to cut the bitternes. Also added mushrooms and onions. The tomatoes make a nice stew with the green beans. Very comforting and very healthy.

Don't change a thing in this recipe - it's wonderful!  Great flavor and easy to prepare!  Thank you for a terrific recipe!!
NOTE TO KBOK - it's unfair to give this recipe only 3 stars,  you made 4 changes so yours is a different recipe from the one posted - it was yours that got the 3 stars not this one.

This recipe is the bomb. I did make some minor changes first I scale the recipe to serve 4 . Instead half can tomato I use the whole can  roughly 1/3 cup chop onion and 2 small clove garlic chop finely added the last minute of sauting onion. I also added sugar about one teaspoon to help loose the can taste. My dad a picky eater said taste as good as fresh green beans

This is delicious on its own, but I thought it was better the second time I made it because I added a clove of minced garlic to the onion. I also use frozen green beans, not canned. If you have any leftover diced potatoes, be sure to toss them in, they are delicious!

Very good recipe. I did change it slightly. I used fresh green beans and they were taking a long time to cook so I added chicken broth at the end of the recipe and cooked for quite awhile to soften the beans. It turned out fantastic and everyone was raving out them.

Different, yet very good. The addition of the bacon and stewed tomatoes add a nice stew-like taste to the green beans. It enhanced the taste and cut-down on some of the bitterness that green beans can have. We will make this again.

I'm not a big fan of bacon, so I left it out.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written and really enjoyed it. 

Will make it again for sure.

Honestly, these weren't anything special. I've made green beans with bacon and onion before that were AMAZING; even with the tomatoes, these weren't anything to rave about. Rather mediocre.

A bit bland for my taste. I added garlic and fresh mushrooms and some dried basil to give it more flavor and the basil helped a lot.    .

i was slightly disappointed with this recipe. instead of stewed tomatoes, i used fresh tomatoes, as well as fresh green beans. i added black pepper, chopped onions and garlic as well, and i felt like the veggies still could have used more flavor.

I told my friend about Allrecipes.com and she found/made this when my husband and I went to her house for Easter.  I was leary because it only had one rating.  I've learned my lesson.  This is absolutely DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Others need to make it too!

As in some of the previous reviews, I also added onions and garlic to this fabulous recipe. My family and me appreciates different flavors and the two additions "kicks it up a notch". This is now my #1 choice for green beans.

These were alright, I wasn't blown away or anything but they tasted good. I added some canned mushrooms to mine and that turned out pretty well.

Fabulous easy recipe! This is the second time I have made it. This time it was my mother-in-law that requested I make it again. I used fresh beans this time and also minced a large clove of garlic. Everyone loved it especially my toddler. Thank you for this great recipe.
