These are OK but the cooking time or temp or something is off. The outsides cooked but the insides stayed mushy. It is tricky to time it right so that it does not burn and you can still cut them into squares. They did not set up into cookie form very well for me.

These are great! Even my peanutbutter-hating-husband likes them. They didn't last long around here!:) I did have to increase the cooking time to about 40 minutes.

These cookies were enjoyed by the adults but not too much by the children! I used peach preserves as no suggestions were made for the type of jelly. The cookies were very moist and delicious especially when warm.

I expected these to be really good. They are just average. I don't know if I will make these again nobody is eating them. I thought they would be bars and could be cut and put on a plate instead you have to scoop them out of the pan and eat with a fork. I also had to cook longer then it stated.

Good a little too sweet. I'll make it without the sugar next time. Thanks.

The kids love it but I would note letting it cool to the touch then chilling in the fridge until set before cutting!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I really wanted a pb&j sandwich for breakfast but I'm out of bread at the moment. I used old fashioned oats halved the ingredients and baked in a 9x9 dish. My oven runs pretty hot so I didn't have a prob w/ the cooking time like other reviewers. Next time I will def use better preserves this time I had to just use what I had on hand which was a mixture of strawberry preserves and my son's grape jelly.

I thought this recipe is great! It's easy to make and tastes great! My kids love it and everytime I take it somewhere I leave without any left! I do cook it alittle longer than stated. Great recipe to get kids involved!

This recipe tasted alright but it it took much longer to cook than stated. i also was unable to cut it into bars so we had to eat it by scooping it out of the pan and eating it with a spoon. Tasted decent just a little disapointing as it's not what i was hoping for.

I wouldn't say that  421 calories, 17.3 g of fat and 61.6 g carbs is very healthy

I took these to work and they disappeared in less than an hour. I work in a small office with only about 10 ppl! I did have to cook these about 5 minutes longer and think that they would be best if chilled for a little while to harden. But they did still stay in bar form somewhat without chilling. If I make these again I will probably use a little less jam. I also want to try these with honey instead of jam.

I had a lot of issues with this same as several others. It was ok but the amount of sugar was overwhelming and it was crumbly instead of a bar. I made a few adjustments that worked for us and figured I'd share...still tweaking though.
