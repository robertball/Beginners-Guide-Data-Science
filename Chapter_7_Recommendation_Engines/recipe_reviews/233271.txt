This was a good recipe. It needs something though. Next time I will try an onion and some garlic. Very quick, little prep, a must try.

Holy mackerel delicious.  I made it from the video, so there were no measurements yet - and I don't think there's a way to mess this up. I am trying to avoid eating the entire batch now before I use it on dinner.  It's highly acidic, but amazingly fresh tasting and creamy. I will be making this regularly.

I doubled the recipe, but next time I will quadruple it.  Tastes great on any Mexican dish,  chips and chicken.  It has a very refreshing taste.  This is my new favorite salsa.  It is perfect just the way it is.

This was fresh and delicious!  I changed it slightly, as I had a LOT of tomatillos, so i used 8 instead of 6 and then used 2 avocados instead of 1.  I added a tablespoon of minced garlic (roughly, who actually measures garlic), and half of a sweet onion.  Alas, I did not have any peppers, so i added about a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce (the jar with the rooster on it), and the sprinkle of salt, lime juice and 1/4 cup of packed cilantro.  I did make two batches, and in one batch  i added some green chilies i had left over in the fridge.  That batch came out good, but not as thick and flavorful as the other batch.  I think this is a great starter recipe to doctor with your own preferences.

It is good, but I agree with some of the other reviews that it is missing something. I will add an onion next time and let everyone know if it is even better!

So good! I doubled the recipe and added a clove of garlic. Used it to spice up leftover turkey tacos. It's easy to make and scrumptious. I used it again in the morning on my eggs.

I Love this recipe.  Nice change from regular salsa.  I added a little onion and some garlic.  I didn't have Serrano peppers so I used jalapenos instead.

This is as delicious as it is easy. I couldn't resist adding  chopped onion (about 1/4 cup) and minced fresh garlic (1 large clove), and I was completely satisfied with the results. It disappeared fast!

This comes out to be tasting like a variant of guacamole, more than a salsa. Overall really tasty though!

I'm sorry but I didn't have the same excitement for this salsa as the others did.  I will say it does taste better by itself then with chips.  This might be good on tacos or used as a sauce on meats for us, other than a salsa for chips. Has too much tang, maybe too much lime.

Easy tweaks to make this better. Blanch the tomatillos, onion, and Chili's for about 4-5 minutes first before for processing. when combining, use the juice of a full lime to taste.

Perfecto.

Pretty good. I added 2 serranos and I think it could have been even spicier, but that is just me. Good taste.

It's okay. I'll probably look for one with more flavor. I added an onion and garlic as well as some black pepper, but my husband said it was still too bland.

This was really yummy!  Cooking the tomatillos and chile made the flavor mellow and cut the acidity a bit.  I did not put cilantro, because I HATE cilantro, but I did add some coriander powder and fresh garlic to give it a little extra oomph.  Another reviewer mentioned it was lacking something, and I agree.  Just can't put my finger on what.  I will definitely make this again, and try to maybe add chopped green onion on top.

It's a good base for a salsa. As other reviewers noted it needs some additions. I doubled the amount of time juice and added:
1 small shallot
1 large clove of garlic
1/4 to 1/2 tsp  freshly ground corriander (this was done to taste)

These additions made it just about perfect.

Pretty good although I’ve had better.  It’s very easy to make and cheap.  I would use a little more lime and a tad more cilantro next time.  Still great with chips and used on my breakfast tacos.  Tomatillos will be a regular on my grocery list moving forward!

Really quick and easy to make.  We used this on steak tacos and it was excellent.  Next time I would use a little more avocado but overall a nice recipe.

This tastes so fresh. I had perfect fresh tomatillos from our CSA, and I just couldn't bear to cook them! The ingredients emulsified into a beautiful fluffy salsa that keeps well in the fridge. We used this for chips, and it was also great as a salad dressing.

I had this made at table side in a restaurant in San Antonio. Only the guacamole was chunked. Had a "cleaner" feel! Just avocado, tomatillos,  fresh lime and a little salt. The best!

Made it exactly as Chef John advised- tinker with amounts.    Did add an extra avocado.  Is closest I've found to a salsa we had in San Jose,  Baja, Mexico.  Wonderful flavor!

A bit bland for my taste. But it froze really well for weekday lunch snacks. Would have liked a bit more lime and salt.

It was good but think that it would have been better with some onion or garlic.

Very good and mild sauce. I added a clove of garlic and a small handful of chopped white onion for flavor.  I also substituted a jalapeno.

I made this to serve with Venison Barbacoa tacos and it was great with the dish!  I did add a little chopped green onion only because I had it, but honestly, it was negligible.  I de-seeded the Serrano peppers, and used about 2.5 of them without measuring.  Other than that, I was faithful to the recipe.  While I was tempted to add garlic, I resisted.  And I'm glad I did.  The Barbacoa was already heavy on garlic, and this was a bright contrast!

I fixed it!  I tripled and fire roasted, peeled the Serrano chillies, then seeded them.
Added one fresh white onion to the mix.
Finely chopped it all in food processor except  for the avocado.  I used two avocados and diced them into 3/8" cubes.
Added garlic salt to taste. 
Chill in fridge covered for 24 hrs for flavors to meld. Stir and serve cold. OLE!

I've made this same recipe before, but for a deeper flavor I like cutting the tomatillos in half and roasting them in a hot oven until they start to blister.  I also added some onion for additional flavor

I didn't really care for the taste of this dip. I will try it again just to be sure when tomatillos are in season.

will cook boil the tomatillos before adding other ingredients.
