I used the lavender cream mixture with the basic truffle recipe found on this site.  I let the mixture steep 6 times instead of 4 just to make sure the lavender flavor was strong enough.  The flavor was unbelievable!

The truffles are amazing. The texture is perfect, the chocolate and lavender make a great combination. Truffles are pretty simple and easy to make, but I will put the chocolate mixture in refregirater more than for 1 hour, because it was a little sticky. I didn`t microwaved the cream, just cooked over low heat until hot. I used dried lavender and I didn`t coat the truffles, they looked beautiful just dipped in chocolate. My only complaint is that this recipe makes only 12 truffles.

I made these for valentines day. I misread the directions and didn't separate the melted chocolate so everything was rolled and mixed together. They hardened well and it was a fairly quick recipe. I also rolled a few in coconit and some chopped nuts.  I will try to make them again but do it right this time!

I messed this coating for this recipe up, didn't use butter and they still turned out great!  Center filling is perfect texture and very rich.  I had a few white chocolate chips left over and dipped a few in that delicious!!

Tip: If you don't mind flat bottoms, use a small disher-style scoop for the filling and save a mess.

A little too elaborate to make them, but the taste is absolutely amazing. Will make again for special occasions.

Excellent! These truffles are so creamy and tasty. Just a hint of lavender makes the truffle unique. I made them twice and the first time I used lavender buds from my garden and they were a little bitter so the next time I used lavender that I bought at Sprouts in the bulk spice section. I used 1 oz per batch and they were much better. Food grade lavender in bulk is the way to go. These are amazing. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!

This recipe sounds really good. Could you use Lavender extract instead of Lavender flower heads. And the recipe still turn out right?
