I've been making these for years but had lost my recipe. This is identical to what I'm used to making....absolutely delicious! A few hints for bakers trying this the first time....use real butter, not margarine. Not only will the cookies  bake better but part of the wonderful flavor they have is how buttery they taste. The butter flavor does intensify a bit after a couple of days. Also, the easiest way I've found to coat each cookie with the powdered sugar is by using a covered plastic container. Pour powdered sugar in the container and add a few cookies at a time. Shake them gently to coat. They don't look too coated after the first time, but the second coating will give you the beautiful snowball look that these cookies are famous for.

This recipe is snowball perfection! Reviewers who don't follow this to the tee are missing out. I sell these in my shop and they fly out the door. Suggestions - Use cookie scoop #60 and bake until just golden, approx 11 - 12 minutes and immediately toss in generous amount of confectioners sugar.  Lift out by the bottom with fork, tap, and then place into 8AA cupcake liners.  Wonderful!!!

I have made this cookie many ways.  I always come back to this variation as I think it is the nicest looking. I keep my cookies well chilled prior to baking. I also bake these at 325 degrees for 20 mins.  Now when making the balls for the cookies I incorporate the whole  familys help.  With Christmas such a busy time you can relax with these as they are simple ( balls a little time consuming) taste great and go over well.  Thanx for a nice recipe!  I almost always add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and a half of almond or rum flavoring.Sounds like alot of flavoring but taste yummy!

This recipe definitely needs more vanilla; I soak the nuts on vanilla a bit before adding them. I saw some comments about the cookies being hard or dry, this might be because the butter is not at room temperature or not well creamed, the butter needs to look like mayonnaise before adding the rest of the ingredients; if the butter is runny or semi melted the cookies turn out hard, on the other hand if the butter is cold or firm the cookies crumble and turn out dry.

Note that these don't spread or rise, so you can bake a bunch on the cooky sheet, which makes the preparation time for these balls much less than the average cooky.  This is such a classic, it's hard to think anybody couldn't find them in a comprehensive cookbook.  I've got some old books from the '50's, and they have it, too.  The nuts, I've found, are best if ground almost to a powder; small chunks can make them crumble even as you roll them.  You need not restrict yourself to almonds, either; almonds are wonderful, especially if you add about a tsp. of almond extract, with, or instead of, the vanilla.  Here's a tip:  chill the dough before forming balls.  It makes it a bunch easier.  Also, if the dough wants to stick to your hands, keep them dampened with clean water when rolling the balls.  Oh, and don't forget the second dusting with confectioner's (10x) sugar.

My recipe for these cookies is very similar but after 40 years of using mine, I am switching to this recipe.  These were by far the best I have ever eaten.  The buttery taste of real butter is so much better than the margarine I have been using.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

PERFECT!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  This cookie just melts in your mouth and it is SO easy to make.  A little messy with the confectioner's sugar + candy cane powder, but once you establish a system, it's not as awkward.  I felt it was easiest/cleanest to do it with tongs.  I even made a batch with white whole wheat flour, and it tasted wonderful; just added to the nutty buttery taste but made it just a tad healthier!  =P  I found smaller balls baked more like balls.  If the ball was too large, it would start to flatten slightly into a mound.

my mum made these wonderful cookies every Christmas when I was a child. We loved them!!!! I had lost the recipe, and was THRILLED to find it here. It is perfect, as is. I made them yesterday. I expected my 4 children might like them, but I thought they would prefer other cookies, because these are not that sweet. When I asked them tonight, which cookie they like the best, they all agreed. This is the BEST Christmas cookie mum has ever made (and I usually bake at least 20 different kinds!!!) Thank you, thank you, Thank you.

This is a very festive cookie for Christmas.  It's a great cookie for people who love nutty cookies or shortbreads.  It's almost exactly the same as a Russian tea cake recipe from Betty Crocker's web site.  The only variation is 3/4 cup finely chopped nuts instead of 1 cup chopped pecans.  Also, the baking instruction was 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.  Next time I will try 350 degrees for 15 minutes to see if the cookies turn out even better.  Also, I made another batch of dough using 3/4 cup toasted coconut instead of chopped nuts to put in the freezer for later use.  I think that will yield delicious cookies for coconut fans.

These cookies are awesome, a real throw-back to when I was a kid!  I sized them exactly as the recipe directed - one tablespoon - and I got about 4 dozen cookies.  I am quite meticulous about cookies and weighed each dough ball out so every single cookie was exactly the same size...15 grams each.  I rolled them into balls and spaced them about 1.5" apart on parchment paper, they do not spread much at all.  They have to come out of the oven before they look done, I baked them for 12 minutes at 350.  THE KEY TO THE COOKIE IS THIS: as soon as the cookie has cooled enough to handle but still hot, they must be rolled in powdered sugar.  I used a container with a cup or more of powdered sugar in it; I placed several cookies in the container at one time, put the lid on, and gently turned the container over and around until the cookies were coated.  I took them out of the container and put them in a single layer in a 9x13 pan to cool entirely.  When completely cool, I put the cookies into a gallon-sized ziplock sealed with plenty of trapped air (so it’s like a pillow) and I gently turned the bag over and again to re-coat the cookies with powdered sugar.  COATING THEM TWICE IS A MUST!!  Those people who complained about the cookies being dry (you overbaked them!!) or bland (you didn’t coat them twice with powdered sugar!)…you must follow the directions exactly as written and you will be rewarded with a delightful, tasty, perfect holiday cookie!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

This is absolutely fabulous!  My husband says that this recipe is better than the one his mama made!  Ssshhh!!!  Don't tell her!!  The only thing that worried me is that the dough was crumbly...For those who are worried about that...DON'T!!!  It's the way it's supposed to be!  I learned that!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent, Excellent! A keeper in my recipe book! I found if my butter was slightly melted the dough was not crumbly at all. I also took a cup of chopped pecans and put in a plastic ziplock and rolled with a rolling pin to crush even more. The smaller the nut the better in my opinion. I baked only 10 minutes...much better under baked. Store in air tight container or they will dry out quickly!

These are my favorite holiday cookie!! I followed the recipe as given excluding the candy cane.  I only baked mine for 12 minutes instead of the 15.  Also I would like to note that I tripled the recipe and only got about 110 not the 180.  My cookies were small in size so I would just make sure you at least double the recipe.

Love this cookie! We've had a blizzard here in Missouri and my kids wanted to make something that was like a snowball. These were perfect and my kids ages 5, 3 and 2 all helped roll them so we were done in no time. Thanks so much!

This is an a very nice easy recipe.  I searched specifically for a cookie without eggs (I didn't have any!) and this was among the results.  I didn't have pecans on hand so I used almonds and it was just as well.  I halved this recipe thinking I would get 2 1/2 dozen.  As it turns out, I only got 20 cookies out of it.  I'll make the full recipe next time and count on 40 cookies.  I baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect, crisp yet light.  Thanks for the easy recipe.  I think it's going to be my go to cookie when I'm looking for a cookie that's not too sweet!

These are delicious. I'm a chocolate fiend so don't usually stray from chocolate desserts, however, this is probably a favorite cookie over any chocolate! I only wish I could find a recipe where it wasn't so crumbly. I added some water and still they were crumbly. The only reason this recipe didn't get a five star.

Trying out some new recipes for the upcoming holidays, and this recipe was delicious! I had all the ingredients on hand (left out the candy) and it mixed up quick and easy! I did use 1/3 cup of confections sugar, for a slighty sweeter cookie...This cookie is definitely getting put on the holiday cookie rotation!

A huge hit of my Christmas cookie platter. Easy to make vegan by using Earth Balance instead of butter. I made them without the candy canes.

One of my favorite cookies. If only they weren't so messy to eat I'd make them a lot more often. I have found that for this recipe it's important to use real butter and a good quality pure vanilla extract. I once made them with imitation extract and the difference was very noticable.

Followed this recipe to a tee, and WOW these are great. I haven't had a chance to take a picture because my family keeps eating them straight from the oven! I was worried because the mixture is crumbly, but I used a melon baller and packed the dough in. After they came out of the oven I rolled some in the peppermint/sugar mixture and some just in confectioners sugar, either way these are melt-in-your mouth delicious!

This is an execellent recipe for snowball cookies. The full recipe makes 40 cookies. I could fit 1/2 of them on each cookie sheet. Instead of an ungreased cookie sheet, I just lined it with parchment. I ended up needing 3 times the amount of powdered sugar suggested or 1 cup. The ground candy canes were a nice festive touch. It took about 2 candy canes. I just sprinkles a little on top, but will try mixing it with the powdered sugar, as suggested, next time. These will make a nice addition to the Christmas cookie tray. Thank you. : )

These are great with a little extra vanilla (doubled) and a little extra Pecans that I put in a heavy duty ziplock bag and crushed with a meat hammer/tenderizer.
Only problem is I cant stop eating them!!!

These came out perfect.  Roll them in little quarter size balls and you can fit a bunch on a cooky sheet.  The dough came out really crumbly, but I just poured some in my hand with a big spoon and squished it, moving from hand to hand until I formed a little ball.  You have to be delicate with them, let them cool just a bit and then put them in a rectangular container with powdered sugar, about 4-6 at a time.  Shake the container to move them around and place on wax paper on the counter until cooled.

These were great - just like I remember my grandma's. I added a tsp of almond extract and a tsp of butter flavoring which was really nice. I recommend making them very small so you can pop a whole one in your mouth. The small ones were more fun to eat!

Great recipe!  The russian teacookies were just moist enough to not crumble when you bite into it.  Only suggestion is make sure you mix the flour and salt in a second bowl before adding them to the creamed sugar, butter, and vanilla.  Then add the nuts to mix in.  I added the salt, flour, and nuts in at the same time, and it was hard to mix evenly (some cookies were saltier than others).  Other than that, they were great and super easy!

Great recipe! Modified it to add 1tbl vanilla and 1/2tsp rum extracts like recommended for my Christmas cookies... But was foolish enough to use "light butter" (silly me).  Works well enough, but lacks the rich taste I prefer and doesn't get golden brown when done. (very intelligent to note as you don't want to over cook as they will crumble).

Stick with the tried and REAL butter! Imo

These were pretty good. I used almonds in place of pecans in one batch, and orange peel in another batch. The orange peel cookies were more popular. The cookies looked very pretty after being rolled in the confectioners sugar, but they were much too sweet, in my opinion. Overall a good recipe.

WOW! That is all I can say about this.  Thank-you for the recipe.  These mexican tea cakes were even easier to make then the lemon bars I just made.  I thought I had pecans, but soon realized I had walnuts and used those instead. I put the cookies in for 17 minutes and THAT IS IT.  Listen to the person that made this recipe as she said DO NOT OVERCOOK THESE.  If they still look undercooked after 15 minutes, then you did it right.  THANKS!

I made these for my daughter's classmates and teachers for Christmas, and got rave reviews! I added crushed peppermint to the dough and rolled it in pure peppermint candy after rolling it in a powdered sugar/peppermint mixture. I'm in LOVE with these because they're buttery AND minty! Two of my favorite flaves!

These came out great! I used 50/50 Smart Balance butter for baking and used half wheat flour. So good! I've made these before with a different recipe and the only difference was that it used a tiny bit less flour. That recipe was less crumbly, and therefore easier to work with. However, the taste is identical and they're an instant favorite. Be sure to chill your dough before rolling out the little balls and keep it chilled between batches. I used 2 tsps of dough for each cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful, and not-too-too-sweet, despite the powdered sugar coating.  But be careful how long you cook them.  One cookie sheet got left in a minute too long, and it made them too dry. The others were absolute heaven, though.

These are one of my all time favorite cookie and this recipe is the best.  The only thing I would add is to let the dough rest in the refrigerator for a half hour before forming into balls.  This helps the cookies from tasting like flour and keeps the balls rounded because they are chilled.

Taste just like the cookies I grew up on two hours north of the Mexican border.  Did not use the peppermint as I was going for a more authentic taste.  Put pecans through a nut grinder so they were more "flecks" than nuts.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting!

These were ok. I added the suggestion of using candy canes for the final dusting, and it made the cookie a little awkward.

These are wonderful. I crushed the candy canes in a gallon ziploc baggie then added the powdered sugar and put the hot cookies in to gently shake and coat. Worked wonderfully! One coating was plenty for us and they looked festive.

After devouring a pecan tea cookie at Specialty's over the holidays and finding out they were for a limited time only, I scoured the internet looking for a recipe similar to the buttery concoction at Specialty's! 

This, by far, is the closest I have come to recreating that confectionary treat! 

Tips: Like other users have stated, use real butter and it is better if the butter is at room temperature. I also substituted the vanilla extract for a bit of maple extract to intensify the pecan flavor and it was delicious!
To powder the balls, I used a large ziploc bag filled with powdered sugar and tossed in about 5 at a time (while still warm) to get a nice coat. Once cooled, I tossed them back into the ziploc bag for the second coating.

These are my favorite cookies! I'm so glad I came across this recipe. Thanks for sharing!!! :) The ONLY thing I did differently was that I used 2 tsp vanilla extract instead of 1... and I'm not a fan of mint so I didn't use the candy canes.

Big hit at a christmas party!  I didn't roll in peppermint, but otherwise followed the recipe.  These would be fun rolled in red or green sugar too!

Dont alter anything!  These are perfect as they are!  We dip the raw dough balls in red and green sugar before baking, or we use a vanilla glace after baking. These are simply delicious!  Everyone's favorite!

OMG! Need I say more! I have made this for the last three yrs. at Christmas. I omit the Candy cane and they are melt in your mouth butter pecan snowballs. I have two friends who want me to make them for them as a gift every Christmas. I use a mini food processer and grind my pecans down to what looks like pecan paste. Its worth the extra work doing so as it just makes forming the balls so easy. I roll in powd. sugar 2 times after they are out of oven.

I've only had these out of a box, once, and this is one of my new favorite cookies!!  The only thing i changed was doubling the vanilla (i love it).  These are definately worth making again and again.  I know they're supposed to be dusted, but next time i am going to try a powerdered sugar and water glaze and see what the difference is, to cut down on mess.  Yummy!

I don't know what happened here.  These simply did not come out the way that I hoped they would.  The dough was crumbly, even after I added extra butter, and so I had to pack each little ball much like you would "pack" a REAL snowball.  The taste was only so-so.  Bummer.

Loved this! I toasted the pecans before adding to the mix. (Let them cool first) Also, when packing I added a little extra powdered sugar to the bag/tin to absorb any moisture and they never stuck together.

A very tasty, melt-in-your-mouth cookie.  They're best rolled about the size of shooter marbles and baked for only 12 minutes.  I also added some colored sugar in place of ground peppermint in the final dusting.  Freeze beautifully and come out tasting fresh baked.

Followed exactly and crumbled apart when tossed in powder sugar?  I remade the recipe again, and the same thing??  I can’t find it,  but my old recipe said to toast at 275 for 90 mins...this one is really different??  Oh well, glad everyone loved it!  I’m sure it’s something  I did wrong, both times?

UPDATE:  I’m not a quitter and kinda hard headed  so I had to try it again!!!  This time I cooked them till lightest of brown, not white.  That took 30 minutes.  Then I did NOT toss them in sugar while hot,  just warm, enough for sugar to get sticky on the cookies.  This time they stayed together.  I’m in a new house with a fancy oven so I guess my old oven worked perfectly with this recipe??

Would I recommend?  Yes.  But for me, way too many adjustments for five stars.  Sorry

Perfection.  I halved it and found that I needed a bit more butter to keep the balls together. The tip about underdoneness - VERY useful. My oven tends to be hot so I took them out at 6 Mins for the first batch then turned it down to 350 and baked them til 8.

I've been making this for years (it's in the old version of the Betty Crocker cookbook - from the early 70's and probably earlier)  My aunt would make these when I was girl and shape into crescents -- I make them like the recipe calls for (balls) and often use Walnuts (cheaper)!
Even though these don't spread - DON'T crowd the cookie sheet - if you do they won't bake right - (dry or undercooked) ... follow this exactly and you will have a melt-in-your-mouth morsel of yummy!  Love these!

This recipe made 30 cookies.  An hour after they were finished cooking, my wife and I had eaten all but 11 of them.  That tells you just how great these little gems are!

I followed the recipe to the letter except for the chopped pecans which we didn't have.  I thought the cooking time might be a bit high, but as it happened 15 minutes @ 350 degrees was just about perfect.

In short, this is a VERY yummy cookie recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

These are really tasty.  They are also really easy to overcook.  I would recommend an air bake pan, and also, don't make the balls smaller than the recipe states unless you are prepared to check them every minute!

The recipe doesnt make the stated amount. I cut the recipe in half so expected 30 cookies but only got 18. I measured out a tbsp of dough for the first one and made all the others the same size. For the future I would recommend not reducing the recipe. Other than that they turned out great. I also didn't cook the full 15 minutes. More like 11.

Made them for a first time - i did´nt even know how doughy or soft they should be in the end, so was kinda worried that they will turn out too "raw".

Honestly i´m not a big fan of them but they turned out pretty ok (as the "expert" said:). Indeed, don´t overcook them. 

Was using the powdered coconut as the final touch with a powder sugar but it did´nt attach well. Would put it in the next time tho.

I didn't really pay attention to the recipe and ended up throwing the crushed peppermints into the cookie dough.  They still ended up delicious!

Loved these!  I used walnuts & put them in the blender first so they were super minced...much better that way.

I made a batch last might. My friend usually makes them  and brings in a bagful for my 'Christmas' present..which I look forward to every year.
 I decided to try for myself..so EASY. I only used 1/2 C chopped pecans. I don't want 'pecan' cookies. They came out GREAT. The dough is supposed to be crumbly, but sticks together when you shape into a ball due to the butter. I baked them at 350 for 15 min, no problems, not underdone or overcooked. I made smaller ones, less than a tbsp each and cooked those for 12 min. I think the smaller the less time you need to bake them. I would recommend everyone make these they are easy and delicious. 
Hopefully my friend keeps making them for Christmas I do not mind receiving them! :)

Perfect recipe! It took a little while longer to bake (perhaps because I like to have mines a little brown around the edges) but it makes for a perfect holiday treat.

They were very good, kind of a dry type of cookie though, I dipped mine in icing and rolled them in coconut to make them look more like snowballs, but also to give them a little something extra to take away the dryness.

This was a wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe to the T but i added 2tsp of vanilla extract and then 1 1/2 tbs on Captain Morgan Spiced Rum. Im sure any run would taste good, but spiced rum has a vanilla flavor so i only thought that would add the to cookies. Also the recipe says this will made 5 dozen, not sure if that's correct but i made mini ones and was 1 shy of having 2 dozen. Other then that this recipe will stay with me forever.

These showballs are wonderful. I made them last Christmas with my mother in law- she said it was just like her mother's old recipe that was lost... this is a keeper. Everyone loved them- i'm making them again for next Christmas :)

Well, yesterday was a "Snow Day", everyone stuck in the house!  So I figured why not give these a shot.  Everyone (including myself) was super happy that I did.  They were a huge hit, and very easy (using ingredients I had around the house).  I will be making these again and again, they will surely be on our Christmas line-up! Thanks

Very tasty and easy to make. My 4 yr old helped. I didn't add the candy cane. I added a bit of almond extract. I should have doubled the batch. These will be gone today.

These are wonderful! People who don't really like peppermint loved these! I ground the candy canes in my food processor and that worked really well, but it didn't add much in terms of appearance - it just tinted them pink a bit. The amount of peppermint flavor was perfect, but these are great without the peppermint, too!! Just melt-in-your-mouth wonderful.

These cookies are perfect as the recipe is written.  In fact, being my favorite holiday cookie, I was delighted to find this recipe because my grocery store ran out of these holiday favorites weeks before Christmas.  I didn't use the peppermint candy canes because I desired the original recipe, but I will try the peppermint the next time I make these.  I did only one thing that was not in accordance with the recipe, I made my cookies just a smidgeon larger than the recipe called for, which meant a "three bite" cookie.  These are so delicate, I would make them no larger than one tablespoon before making into a ball.  A giant thank you for such a fantastic recipe.

I make these every year and every year I misplace the recipe!  I have finally set up my recipe box and added this recipe to it.  My Mom loves these (though she does not need all the sugar but can have a couple a day) and this is the perfect recipe.  I shall never again have to search for these exact ingredients.  Thanks much!

These cookies were so delicious. My one issue is, I just wish I could figure out how to make them so they're not sticky. I rolled them in powdered sugar twice as directed, but the sugar just absorbs right in. This obviously has no affect on the taste, it simply makes them less pretty to serve.

Melt in your mouth...yummy.  These typical butter cookie ball rolled in confectioner's sugar.  You can use pecans, walnuts, or even black walnuts (stong flavor (acquired taste).

These are pretty much a more solid, rolled form of a shortbread cookie. Pretty good. I'm giving only four stars because when you take a bite it tastes like you're eating a mediocre shortbread cookie and I found it a bit disappointing. It was yummy though. They were gobbled up at a party.

The flavor was really good but a little too crumbly. I dusted one by one with powdered sugar and some broke apart while I was dusting them.

We always use this recipe at Christmas. They're just like the ones Mom used to make :) The crushed peppermint added to the final powdered sugar coating makes them extra special. Thanks for sharing this classic recipe!

I followed the recipe as is with the exception of using finely chopped pecans.  I love the subtle peppermint taste.  This was an immediate hit with our cookie exchange group!

These were good.  I like the candy cane idea, but the topping didn't stick well with the candy cane bits in it.  I would either make them very FINELY crushed (i.e. candy cane dust) or maybe try putting the crushed candy in the cookies...

My decades old, passed down recipe calls for walnut extract and walnuts, instead of vanilla and pecans.  They were originally made into a crescent shape, but I started rolling into balls about 10 years ago, as it was way easier!!  These are my absolute favorite cookie that I bake for Xmas (and my mom baked them  for my wedding 30+ years ago)

We were looking for a cookie to carry out an Antarctic theme.  These fit the bill and really  did melt in your mouth!  I found it to use more powdered sugar than was listed for coating the baked “snowballs”.   As suggested, I gently shook 4-5 cookies at a time in a covered container to coat with sugar. I then placed cookies on a cookie cooling rack with a big brownie pan beneath.  It caught the powdered sugar and made clean up easier.   Several requested the recipe.  I’ve already made and served 2 batches this week.

These are perfection.  Because they are made with so much butter, timing can be tricky as they will go from barely brown to quite brown within a minute.  Depending on your oven, try 12-14 minutes at 350.  I use tongs to pull them off the tray immediately and drop them in a bowl of confectioner's sugar.  For those who found the batter to be too dry, a couple of possible issues:  Make sure you aerate your flour and gently shake it into the measuring cup, never pack flour or your measurement will be off (too much).  Use an electric beater to cream the butter and sugar/vanilla but hand mix in the remainder of the ingredients and keep mixing until it completely comes together.  Finally, I use a mini chopper to chop my nuts very fine as they are traditionally for these cookies.  I start with slightly more than a cup of pecan halves.  I follow the remainder of the ingredients/amounts exactly.  No need to change this recipe-5+ stars as it is written!  A #60 cookie scoop, level will produce exactly 4 dozen cookies.

My kids love these however I have one child that is allergic to nuts so I omit the pecans.  To do this I subtract 1/4 cup flour and add two table spoons milk to the dough.  They are really great this way.

I made these cookies for a wedding and they were more than delicious. I had a professional baker approach me asking  for the recipe. These cookies have a rich buttery-nutty flavor and just the right amount of sweetness to compliment taste. My suggestion is to cook at 350 for 9-10 minutes..NO MORE. Enjoy! I still have people calling me for this recipe 6 months later. BTW-I did not use candy canes. In my opinion it takes away from the deep, rich flavors that make this cookie very special!

perfection.  I've been making these for years from my BH&G Christmas cookie book.  I think basically the difference is that other recipe calls for a few tsp. water to the dough.  i like this one better.  beautiful crumb.  the only thing I do is grind my pecans on a rather smaller chop in my food processor and toast them first in a dry pan on the stovetop.  toasting the nuts will enhance the flavor.  I doubled the recipe and using a small pampered chef cookie scoop, i was able to get 80.  I did use salted butter but still kept the salt in the recipe and it was perfect.  buttery nutty goodness.  I love this dough; it is a synch to bake these up because they don't spread so you can get a ton on a cookie sheet.  the dough was wonderful to work with and using the small size cookie scoop, they were so uniform.  beautiful recipe.  thank you.  15 min was perfect in my oven and the bottoms were just a beautiful light golden brown, thanks to use of the Silpats.  I always sift my confectioner's sugar for the dusting; they present much prettier.  I do think they taste better after they have set for a day.  The pecan flavor seems to come out.

The few changes I made was adding 1/2 tsp almond extract, and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. Can also add 1 tsp cinnamon, and that compliments the crushed pecans very nicely. Am shipping to relatives for Christmas in a tin.

These are super. My Christmas variation, which is the most popular cookie I've ever made:

Add 1 tsp of mint extract and replace pecans with good quality chocolate chips.

This is identical to one my late granny had given me and left to me for our entire family.  I haven't been able to make them in years because of a bad military mover's messup *sigh*.  But here it is, and I can bring her bit of Christmas love to our family once again.  Bless you!
She would always give each individual family their own tin of cookies to share...they never made it long...disappeared within minutes :(  I took to scrooging my individual take away somewhere like a squirrel putting nuts into hiding, so I could savor them throughout the holiday!!

This was the first time I ever made these cookies. They came out delicious! I think I might have over baked mine because my oven is weird, but they still came out great! Definitely roll them in the powdered sugar after they fully cool, they coat much better. I also did half almond, half vanilla extract. Very easy, great recipe.

Easy and good.  Had to add some color - so melted candy melts and spooned onto the tops after dusting with powder sugar.  I brushed the tops a bit to allow the candy melt to stick - then topped with crushed peppermint candy.  Looks pretty and taste great!  Thanks for the recipe and tips!!

This recipe is perfect.  One helpful hint, to get the right size ball use a 1/2 teaspoon (measuring spoon) to scoop up your cookie dough for shaping into a ball.  Use a slightly heaping 1/2 teaspoon full.  You will get a nice size ball and they will all cook evenly because they are all the same size.  I cooked mine for about 9 min.  If you make them bigger then you will have to increase your cooking time, if you get much bigger than a full heaping teaspoon you may start having trouble with the bottom browning too much and the inside not as done as it needs to be.  Great recipe just used it and made about 3 doz cookies. Experiment to get the size of ball you want and the cooking time that is needed to satisfy you.  Once you get it down you will forever have great results!

An all time favorite of mine. The only change I made was to cut the baking time from 15 minutes to 12 minutes.  I do recommend doing this.

I make these every year however I add a new twist.  Try wrapping the dough around a cherry before baking.  I have used well drained cherries if cookies are to be used quickly or used candied cherries also.  They are wonderful!

This was excellent. My family and friends loved it. So simple. Just be sure to watch so it doesn't cook too long and burn. Great.

Awesome awesome awesome.  Mixing with a fork and a sturdy spoon takes the most time and the dough with crumbly like pie crust.  Rolling into balls with warm up the butter and make it all stick together.  I store mine after cooling (instead of doing a second dip) in large storage bags with the leftover powdered sugar or extra powered sugar. I'm a traditionalist so I don't use the candy canes :)

This is the very best recipe for snowballs my family has ever had!  Thank you all so much for your extra tips, I followed them;  using real butter, chopping the nuts very fine, and refrigerating the dough.

I dipped in melted white and dark chocolate, drizzling the opposite cholcolate to trim.  Placed them in foil cuplets.  Not only beautiful, they were lovely, melt-in-your mouth shortbread treats for the holidays.

Love these cookies! Famous as a Chirstmas cookies, I made them in July because they're my favorite. I sometimes add a dash of cinnamon the spice these up, otherwise this recipes is perfection. I just want to add a note that these aren't supposed to be light, fluffy cookies-they're dense. And scrumptious. I can't help but eating at least one with my morning cup of coffee too!

These were easy & I had all the ingredients, but seems like they weren't quite sweet enough.  Just kind of bland and I did add extra vanilla and some almond extract.

Like others, I made these cookies for years from my mother's recipe. So when I couldn't find the recipe I came here. This one looked the closest, and when I tasted the first one I said to my husband, "Oh yeah, this. is. the cookie!" In my oven the 15 minutes was a little too long, more like 12-13. It's also a good idea to let them cool a bit before the first coating in powdered sugar. They're very tender when hot and can easily break apart. But a few minutes on the rack and they're ready to roll! Oh, and ditto on the real butter. Not only will the flavor not compare with margarine, the texture of the dough won't be right either. Margarine has too much water in it and will have adverse effects on the consistency of the dough. Thank you so much, Lori. When you bite into a cookie and it takes you back to childhood, well, you just can't ask for more!

There are no words for how good these cookies are! I've been searching for a "Mexican Wedding Cookie" recipe that I love for years, and now I've found it! I decided to try it because of the ratings, and am SO glad I did. I made a batch and as they were cooling decided to mix up another batch, they were that good.  Perfect as it- love the addition of candycane dust.  This one is going in my permanent cookie file and I am DONE looking for a recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I followed the recipe exactly. I did however use chipped walnuts instead of chopped pecans. They turned out delish! This was the first time making these so I was a little leery of how they would turn out but so glad I took the chance and tried. I will surely make them again.  Yummy!!!

I can not tell you how many times people asked for this recipe when I took them to a Christmas party.  They were such a hit!  Not to sweet & the perfect consistency.  Would give them ten stars if I could.  The only thing was that I had to shake them in a ziplock bag multiple times to get them coated fully with the sugar...but well worth it.  Great for a Christmas gift as well!

These were SO easy, but incredibly delicious. My family ate them all in a day. I didn't add the candy canes, i didn't think they would really go with the recipe. You might want to double them, it makes a small batch.

After making these for decades, i've found that I can wait for about 15 minutes out of the oven and place the cookies in a gallon ziplock with a cup of confectioner's sugar.. i GENTLY turn the bag over a few times. I remove the cookies to a rack to cool completely. I then load all the baked cookies into the bag and mix gently again, place in the freezer and take out as needed.  I put together gift containers full of cookies just before gifting.

12.2.06  I lost my recipe and came to allrecipes to find a replacement. this is it!  always a hit during the holidays (or anytime) love these cookies.

These are delicious - delicate melt in your mouth balls. I used walnuts and they worked great. This is quite a dry cookie, if you want something chewy, this isn't it.

Wow!!  These cookies are the best.  I got a little creative and added a few ingredients for a little variation.  I added about a cup of toasted coconut and a half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.  Yumm!!!  Obviously you would omit the peppermint candy.

My Grandma makes these cookies every Christmas, and this recipe tastes just like hers.  They are very good.  I only used 1/2 cup of pecans because a full cup seemed like too much.

These cookies are soooo good.  I remember making them a few years ago, but couldn't find the recipe.  These were just like them.  Thanks Lori!

I didn't have pecans,  but I did have walnuts! I fine cut/minced the walnuts in my small blender.  I  followed the recipe, but instead of adding vanilla extract I added almond extract. The snowballs turned out wonderful and were gone almost immediately! Will definitely make again.

Thank you, Lori Dehn, for explaining the difference. . I always called them "Snowballs" myself, even though I knew they were called Mexican Wedding Cakes. I didn't know they were also Russian. I love them nonetheless.

Made twice. First time as directed except baked at 325 18 min. Second time I used 3 tsp vanilla and added 1 tbsp. water. With these slight changes they stayed together much better and had a little more flavor.

I made a double batch today with these changes:

Instead of powered sugar in the cookie mix someone had suggested granulated sugar and that's what I did about  3/4 cup for double batch. 

Used toasted walnuts instead.

Used very fine chopped toasted walnuts and very fine  chopped butterscotch chips (2 TBS of each) in the powered sugar that the cookies were rolled in. DELISH

Cut the cook time to 14 minutes.

This is a keeper in my book!

Very similar to my own recipe however, instead of adding salt I just use salted butter (never margarine), 2 Tablespoons of Organic Honey instead of Candy Canes which not only add more flavor but also help the cookies to stick together nicely. A little more Vanilla and either Orange or Almond Extract for some added flavor and of course plenty of Pecans because they have the best flavor! Everyone's oven is different and depending upon where you live (altitude) oven times and temperatures vary so just bake according to your nose;)

I followed the recipe exactly and I must say these cookies were absolutely delicious!!  Like little bits of heaven in each bite!!  I always made a lemon snowball cookie as part of my Christmas baking list, but these pecan snowballs are far better.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!  I will definitely be making these again and again!!

These don't taste exactly like the snowballs my Lithuanian grandma used to make with lard and walnuts, but it's very close and I like the butter flavor.  

For those who found them dry or tasteless I think they may have put too much flour.  After the first cup I hand mix it till it's comes together but doesn't fall apart when rolling it into a ball.

Change the confection sugar in the batter to granulated sugar and this recipe works. Land o lakes butter is the best for this recipe.  I find that I increase the granulated sugar two 1/2 cup or just a little less than 1/2 cup they are sweet enough. . The confectioner sugar is used to roll the cookies in while they’re warm. If you use confectioners sugar in the cookie it’s going to taste like nothing. These are amazing cookies! I no longer eat sugar but I made them for a cookie exchange and I remember clearly how wonderful they are. If you double the recipe you’ll get about 50 cookies.

I’ve made this twice this week. Really liked how smoothly all the steps went in making it. I used a small cookie scoop then form that  into balls before baking. I really appreciated the previous reviewer that said she uses a small Rubbermaid plastic container with lid to powder sugar the balls three at a time and shook the bowl lightly to cover balls. This recipe is a keeper!

Yep! This recipe is a keeper!  My family prefers walnuts to pecans. But, we have made them both ways and they are always good. Thank you.

These cookies are outstanding.  I used finely chopped walnuts rather than almonds.  And I did not add the crushed peppermint candy, although I'm certain that would have been a nice addition.  But the delicate texture and buttery flavor of these cookies is just as good three days after baking!  Very easy to make and with simple ingredients.  Seven of our neighbors were so happy to receive these cookies as part of our Christmas goody platter we gave them.

Based on some of the reviews, I increased the vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp almond extract.   The dough was rather crumbly -- maybe I should have mixed it a little longer?   They are delicious!  I baked at 350 for 12 minutes.   (That's when the bottoms were golden.)  Some of them just fell apart when I rolled them in powdered sugar.  Those I just had to eat, right then and there.  I also saved a few that I didn't roll in powdered sugar.  They were also delicious.  I will make this again.

I love this cookie and so happy I found it because the ones I've been buying at the bakeries do not compare (too dry and bland, and expensive).  I've made it 3 times again within the last 4 weeks because they're so good and easy to make.  Brother-in-law who is all ITALIAN when it comes to food gobbles them up.   Sister (a very picky eater) and teenage son loves them too. Not a fan of peppermint so I opted out along with salt because who needs more salt?  Tried baking at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and it came out too dry.  Then tried 325 minutes for 15 minutes (and 350 degrees for 11 minutes) ---> undercooked.  Finally, best result was at 350 degrees for 13 minutes exactly. Another important modification was to not roll/coat in powdered sugar when cookies are hot as many people suggested.  Let them cool a bit first.  Did that the first time and the heat from cookies melted the powdered sugar making it difficult and messy to handle when I coated them the second time.  Almost discouraged me from making this again. So, wait about 15- minutes after taking them out of the oven before initial coating. The only real fault with this recipe is that I'll probably gain so much weight from eating so many cookies!

I just made these and they are delicious! They are everything I’d hoped they would be. I did not have any nuts so I just made them without them. They were still delicious but I do look forward to using nuts next time.

I will try this again next Christmas, but I think the butter to flour ratio is wrong. I will try 1/2 # butter to 2 1/4  Cups of flour next time.

This is a wonderful recipe.   I would definitely recommend using salted butter in addition to the salt in the recipe. That simple tip may resolve the "bland" findings some bakers encountered. Coating them with a second powdered sugar dusting is a must. These keep well for up to 5 days in a sealed container, though not eating them will be the biggest challenge as they are wonderful! Perfect with a cup of coffee.

Yup.  This is the one.  My grandma used to make these and called them Mexican Wedding Cookies.  Every time I ordered one from a bakery, it was flavorless flour with powdered sugar.  This is the right one.  Thanks to original poster and my Grandma Clydie.

These are so good. Just like the ones my great grandmother use to make. My oven cooked a lot faster. I took mine out at 9-10 minutes. 2 coatings in the confectioners sugar is a must.

I am not a baker...but they turned out perfect for me.  If can do them anyone can!   Will be serving for dessert on Christmas Day.  Dinner will be rich (lobster and prime rib) so we felt something light and tasty would be in order.

I made a variation by substituting ground toasted coconut for the nuts and coconut extract for the vanilla.  They're excellent & well worth a try if you love coconut or can't eat nuts.

These came out dry and unedible! I looked at other recipies after making these and they used less flour- I think this recipes is flawed, in the proportion of flour used to butter!

Pretty good. I didn't properly cream the butter or crush the nuts  which is probably why it didn't result in the instant melt in your mouth reaction I'd been hoping for. Still yummy though. The prep was very easy. The batter ended up being very crumbly, but I just pressed it into the balls and the shape stuck. Though not as amazing as I'd hoped, they are very addicting!

This is a great recipe.  For the holidays I like to substitute peppermint extract for vanilla in the dough and sometimes add finely chopped peppermint sticks along with the pecans.  That just makes the chopped peppermint sticks in the powdered sugar coating pop even more.  They are very popular.

When I was a kid,  my mom had a tradition with me and my siblings over our weeklong Thanksgiving break. We always did “Cookie Day.” My cookie of choice was always the Mexican Wedding Cookie. This is exactly what I made! Now I share my tradition with my family. My kids love it! And my husband can’t stop raving. Thank you for sharing

These are excellent cookies!  My family and friends can't get enough of them.  The only change I made was in not using the peppermints.  I left those off.  I used real butter in this recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe. It is perfect!

These are a Christmas staple at our house.  I make more than one batch as they are my husband's favorite Christmas cookie, and we always give some to all our neighbors.  They are so easy to make and they never fail.  I've never used the peppermint candy, and I like them without the powdered sugar.  They're very flavorful and one cookie is satisfying (if you can stop at one).  Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea in the morning (or anytime).

As suggested by previous reviewers, I added extra vanilla extract and a little almond extract. Grinding the pecans into a semi powder state was a great tip. Also, putting the freshly baked hot snowballs straight into a Ziploc bag with confectioners' sugar and tossing them inside the bag, coated each snowball with tons of confectioners sugar. Also chilling the dough overnight was another great tip since the little dough rounds did not spread on the cookie sheet and held their round shape while baking. . I did 350° for 15 minutes which was perfect. Great recipe!!!

These were fine. I made them a couple times this holiday season, but will probably look for a different recipe next year.  They were very dry and powdery (and I read the reviews first, creamed the butter well, checked for other tips, etc...)

I had a happy accident with these snowballs.  I was making some other cookies that had unsweetened cocoa powder.  Some of the powder along with some icing sugar got on the snowballs fresh out of the oven.  The cocoa melted on the snowball.  My husband took all of those ones for himself.  He loved them.  So...I added cocoa to the rest.  I did not use the peppermint as it's not too popular in my house.   I followed reviewers feedback and baked for 12 minutes and liked the results.

Best recipe I've found that's like my mom made. I did add 
very fine chopped pecans. I made two separate batches, and my first one was better than the second, and I believe it's 
because I accidently melted the butter, and I went ahead and 
made them. They rolled in a ball easier! Thank you for this recipe.

I pressed the dough into a Wilton snowflake pan, with 12 individual snowflake cookie designs.  I used chopped walnuts, because I like walnuts.  :) Worked out great, everyone loved them sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.

These turned out great. All my friends wanted the recipe. It was weird making the balls since my dough was crumbly like pastry dough and I had to press it into balls which I made a bit larger than I should have. But they were excellent. So I guess I did something right.

Wonderful, melt in your mouth cookies. Just a tip about chopped nuts... if you want them super fine, use your coffee grinder. Pulse a few times and check out the results. It beats chopping! Diane Stadler

How did anyone manage to form a cookie ball from such a high ratio of flour (too much) to butter.  I kept adding more butter, then had to add more flour....  They came out ok.

This is the PERFECT snowball recipe!  Instead of rolling in powdered sugar, I bake mine on parchment paper and then use a sifter with a find mesh screen to sprinkle the sugar on right out of the oven.  When cool enough to handle, I scooch them around to get the bottom coated and sprinkle again.  They are always better after sitting in air-tight container overnight.

Never made snowball cookies before. Tried those ones and they have been a huge hit. So much so that I need to make more. Kids, hubby everyone loves them. Only change I made was using finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans.

I only rolled them in confectioners sugar once. Twice? Too much of a good thing, imho.
Tasty but not fantastic.

I made this according to the recipe with no changes.  Today was my 2nd batch. They turned out very good but a little on the hard side, so ma baked them a minute too long. Guess I'll have to keep making these until I get it right!  My hubby loves them..

Delicious!  
Reading the reviews helps.  I chopped the nuts in the food processor so they would be fine.  The result-the cookies didn't crack.

Very easy, delicious and crumbly. Instead of pecans and vanilla, I used walnuts and maple extract. Will make again for Christmas, with peppermint extract and crushed candy canes in the dough (I think that will be easier than getting crushed candy canes to stick to the cookie).

Great recipe.  Very easy to make.  it browned a little on the bottom but it didn't affect the taste.  I substituted 1/4 cup of miniature chocolate chips for the nuts.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!  Make sure your hands are warm to roll the dough into balls and don't skip the second dusting of confectioners sugar. I put them into little paper cups for a nice presentation.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made these two years ago with this recipe and they were great, but I'm diabetic and no longer eat sugar or white flour. So this year I substituted Swerve sweetener for the sugar and almond flour for the regular flour. I doubled the recipe (got a family) and added 1 more cup of almond flour because almond flour doesn't absorb fats the way regular flour does. Well, the cookies spread a little, so next year I will add another cup of almond flour to the recipe for a total of two extra cups of almond flour for a double recipe (almond flour is a whole lot more expensive than regular flour). The Swerve powdered melts away on the cookies, also due to the fats (butter). We'll see next year. I'm still giving five stars because these cookies are still incredibly delicious and any flaws were of my own making in experimentation. I didn't care to do the math for the carb count, but compared to the original recipe, the carb count is definitely negligible.

My entire family loves these cookies. For those of you who don't want to add the nuts, replace them with  1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. Not only delicious made this way but smell wonderful too...kinda smells like chocolate covered cherries.

I loved this recipe. I didn't make any changes the first batch. The second batch I did add another 1/2 tsp vanilla. Also, make sure your pecans are chopped very fine. It helps make the cookie melt in your mouth! I can see where some people say that it lacks a bit of flafla; to solve that problem I used salted butter and still added the salt that the recipe recommends. The cookies tasted fabulous!

Something has to be left out of this recipe to make snow balls (i.e. chill the dough maybe).  very sticky dough and very difficult to roll into ball.  Also had issue with the cookie keeping form as they flattened out even though cooked for only 12 minutes.  Even tried batch at lower temp, still no luck.  Cookie taste like Sandy should so gave 3 stars.

This is a pretty standard recipe for Russian Tea Cakes (or Snowballs), but there is a reason for that - it's delicious! You just don't need to tamper with perfection. For tender cookies that do not crumble, make sure your butter (and real butter truly is the key to this recipe) is room temperature. Not melted, and not chilled. Room temperature.  And cream it well before adding other ingredients. Perfect every time and so delicious they will disappear off the the cookie tray faster than you can put them on there! :)

I made the dough exactly as the recipe stated. I snuck a pinch for a taste test  and ended up adding  2 more Tbsp of confectioners sugar. I needed just a little bit more of a sweet taste. 
These are about the easiest cookies I've ever made and the taste is divine. My neighbors wanted the recipe after I (reluctantly) sent a plate of cookies hot out of the oven.

Ground the pecans fairly fine.  Used salted butter.  Doubled the vanilla.  Rolled into 1" balls and baked them at 350* for 12 mins.  Double rolled in confectioner sugar.   NICE!!  Second batch I added a Chai Spice blend to the cookie dough and that was especially yummy!

Thanks for posting an old fashioned favorite Christmas cookie to add to my holiday collection. My neighbor lady growing up always made these.  I put mine in a shallow round tupperware container to store and shake the confection sugar on them. For those with crumbly cookies, could be the ingredients.  Real butter and real vanilla is a must for best flavor and consistency. Nearly powder grinding the nuts makes for easy to ball cookies.  We aren't peppermint fans, so I just went with the usual confection sugar coating, once rolled while hot, another time when cool.

I would take the flour down to just the two cups. The dough was a little crumbly to make into balls, but using just the two cups of flour, they were perfection! :)

Just made this today.  Very similar to one I made  years ago.  I took the hot cookies and carefully dropped into a large ziplock bag with CS, about 5-6 at a time and rolled them around.  Not nearly as messy when coating.  Clean up was much easier.   Great recipe.

I've tried this recipe twice over last couple of weeks- I did not use the peppermint candy as suggested (I don't like it on my cookies) and both times I used more of the powder sugar (I didn't even measure).  The first time I mixed it by hand, the second time I used my counter top mixer much easier the second time. The 1st time I used only pecans & the 2nd time I used 1/2 pecans & 1/2 chopped almonds. Both times the cookies came out perfect. 

You do have to be careful when you take the cookies out of the oven - lost a few when my oven mitt crushed a few the first time. I was more careful the second time around. 

Thanks for sharing so much! :)

Best recipe for Snowballs that I have tried yet.  They didn't spread at all and kept their nice round shape.  I did keep the dough in the fridge until ready to use.  Then as soon as it was soft enough to work with I shaped it into balls and baked for 15 minutes.

Everyone in my family loved it. I just made it for the first time 11/2013 and I altered one little thing. I used candied pecans instead of plain pecans.  I would have made them sooner if I'd known they were this simple to make and so delicious.  I am keeping the candied pecan version however.

Delicious cookies. However, using 1 Tbsp of dough per cookie, this recipe only makes 3 dozen... not 5

I have not made these cookies for several years and did not have my original recipe available.  I never criticize or review allrecioes.com, but I was very disappointed with this one and felt I needed to ask a question.  The dough was very dry and difficult to form into balls.  It seemed like there was too many pecans.  Is there a liquid or an egm missing for this recipe?

been baking these for years. Delicious... only adjustment is that I used WAY more powdered sugar to coat than was indicated. Double to triple but I like them to melt when I bite into them. :)  Happy baking!

My husband requested 1 cookie this year for Christmas and it was these. I had never made them before, but found this recipe, and boy was he happy. I got so many compliments. I am not a huge cookie lover, but fresh out of the oven these are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, with no candy cane, my husband hates mint. Real butter is a must, I used salted butter, but I am not sure if that matters.

tasted great, even tried it with the candy canes, they were different but good. When I made them according to the recipe it only made about 40 cookies though not 5 dozen.

My son said these were the best cookie he's ever had. High praise indeed from our cookie monster!! Adjusted the recipe to make two batches and came out with just over sixty cookies, so keep that in mind when serving to others. One is never enough!

I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using walnuts instead of pecans. The dough was crumbly but was easy to work with. I easily made the 1 inch balls using just a little pressure to squeeze the dough together. These taste just like the recipe I grew up having. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks.

My family, (especially my husband), love these cookies! I looked throughout the internet for the recipe and found many. However, this one worked perfectly and is so easy to make. It is best to dip them in confectioner's sugar straight out of the oven & again after they've cooled off. I place 3-4 in a gallon bag filled with the sugar and gently maneuver them around to coat evenly. ENJOY!!

Made this with only 1/2 cup of ground pecans and thought they were just perfect. Splattering these with chocolate would be a delightful addition to be sure. Melt in your mouth treasures!

I misplaced my old recipe for this, but this looked pretty similar to it. They turned out so fantastic, I did a little dance. My boyfriend highly approves also. They definitely achieve the "melting in your mouth" effect. I do wish I would've doubled the recipe, though, because it didn't yield all that many.  I also baked them for about 13-14 minutes and they came out perfect.

I've been looking for this recipe for ever after I tried them one X-mas. The recipe is so easy even though I don't have much experience with baking. I halfed the amount of the recipe and they came out gourgeous. Been eating them straight from the oven with my husband who said this is too much for me and to stop eating them already. Thank you for the recipe!

I decided to remake these again, after horrible failure the first time because I recalculated the recipe. That is my only advice - do not recalculate unless you know what you're doing. Otherwise - following this recipe exactly, they turned out so DELICIOUS! Perfect! I can't make these again because I'll eat them all!

I was a little unsure how these were going to taste since the pastry/dough was very crumbly compared to others. However I was pleasantly surprised when I bit into one. Absolutley delicious, and so easy, this one I will definitley make again.

Although these were a little to crumbly and were hard to roll, I will make these again. They tasted great and were worth the extra time.

These are really good.  They did not turn out dry like other Snowball cookie recipes.

Sooo good and sooo easy! Made these for a cookie exchange and everyone said they were very good. 
The confectioners sugar coated very nicely on them. My mom will love these..can't wait for her to taste them. :)

Very good. My first ever successful homemade cookie. Added a bit more powdered sugar to the cookie mix and put the crushed candy cane in the final dusting. They taste great.

Lacked some ingredients, so i substituted peanuts for walnut, brown sugar for confectioner's, and used 1/2 of the ground see's peppermint candy in the cookie.  The butter really is essential in this recipe.  

Everybody raved about the texture of the cookie.  Made them in shapes of stars, moons and hearts and my balls got squished together, so I had snowmans instead of snowflakes.  =]  Still, incredibly adorable.

These are just like my mom used to make at Christmas time.  After she passed away I couldn't find this recipe in her recipe box, but these taste just like hers!  One thing that she used to do, and I did to these, was put a Hershey's Kiss candy in the middle of the cookie before rolling it into a ball.  Thanks for this recipe, it reminds me of mom!

The cookie part of these are a bit bland.I would have liked them a bit more sweeter.They were ok but not as good as the store bought wedding cookies (in the pink boxes).

I made these for my x-mas work party, and everyone loved them.  Make sure the butter is VERY soft before using it - it makes rolling the cookies a lot easier.  Awesome recipe, thank you !

This was a very nice cookie. I had to bake them a little longer than 15 min but not much. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was excellent!  I made it for a cookie swap, and the cookies were a big hit.  The peppermint added a nice touch.
