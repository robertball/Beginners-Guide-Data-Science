I made a half recipe of this--one loaf. I used my KitchenAid mixer to make this recipe. I used warm buttermilk instead of water or plain milk (if you add the 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup water=one cup buttermilk) and proofed they yeast with the sugar and warm milk in my mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the butter, potatoes, raisins and flour. I needed a touch more flour to get the dough into a solid ball. I switched to my dough hook and kneaded the dough with the hook for five minutes. I set the dough ball to rise in a greased plastic bowl on a warm heating pad, covered with saran wrap, for an hour. I then rolled it out, spread the butter on the bread, then sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon (I doubled the filling--it seemed like I had a lot of dough and not enough filling) over the butter and rolled the dough up and smushed the ends in, then set it in a greased loaf pan. I covered my loaf with plastic wrap and set it in the fridge overnight. This morning, I took my loaf out and let it sit on a warm heating pad for an hour or so to rise again before baking it. Just under 30 minutes baking at 350 degrees was just right fgr me. We really liked this bread, I think the mashed potatoes were really what made this bread good, combined with the buttermilk I added. I'm glad I doubled the filling. As is, it really would not have been enough. Nothing of this bread remains, my husband and kids ate it all so I would say that this recipe was a hit.

When I first read the recipe and the list of ingredients I was a bit put off by the potato. However, this bread is moist, sweet and all around yummy. I made some slight modifications to suit my dietary needs. I added 1/3 cp splenda baking sugar instead of real sugar and I added 6 tbs apple sauce instead of margarine listed. I still ended up with a absolutely wonderful bread I am proud to serve to friends and family. This recipe is a keeper.

yummy!! I made pretty much as indicated. Used golden raisins instead of the dark kind. Mine baked for 40 minutes, and I put foil over the top for the last 10 or so to avoid over-browning. Not sure why it says this recipe can be ready in 1 hr 10 min, because it took me about 3.

I had never made bread with potatoes before. I found the potatoes gave the bread a nice “meaty” texture to the bread that was very satisfying.  The flavor is very good with the right amount of sweetness, however next time I would add extra cinnamon – just a personal preference.

Everyone loved this bread! I only had one loaf pan, so I did one loaf in that pand and one free-form loaf... it turned out great! My only advice is to make sure you roll it tight. I will make this many more times!

This bread recipe is very good. The only things I did different was before I did anything , I soaked the raisins in boiling water a few minutes, then drained them to plump them up. And also when the dough was all mixed I put it in the fridge to slow rise and develope its flavor for about 6 hours. Then I just took it out and went on to the 2nd rise. This Bread Is GOOD!

light, fluffy and delicious, used golden raisins and craisins, because that is what I had in the pantry, great for breakfast o with coffee or tea, with all the butter it will be a once in a while treat:)

A masterpiece!  Very simple to make, and came out of the oven looking beautiful, and smelling great; and the taste was magnificent!  I saved about 1 Tbsp of the sugar-cinnamon mixture and sprinkled it on the top before baking.

This was my 1st bread recipe and I tried it the 1st time exactly as written, it was really good. Then I made it again yesterday and added a little vanilla to the mix, more raisins, I dusted the top with cinnamon sugar, and when I rolled it out I added more cinnamon and sugar than called for. It tastes just like the store bought just fresher! Love this recipes!! My family thanks you!!

Very good.  Used buttermilk instead of plain milk, but made no other changes.  Only thing I will do differently next time is to be more careful about rolling the loaf up more tightly...my swirl in the middle might not have been as pretty as I wanted, but still tasted great!

I'm giving this 5 stars because the taste and texture were exceptional!  Like another review I read, I was skeptical of the potato, but it really made a big difference in my dough from other recipes.  I used agave in the dough itself and the only thing I will do different next time is to use probably 1/3 cup sugar (I used regular sugar for the cinnamon swirl) between the 2 loaves instead of the 1/2.  It was a little too sweet for me, but absolutely delicious!!  Thanks!
