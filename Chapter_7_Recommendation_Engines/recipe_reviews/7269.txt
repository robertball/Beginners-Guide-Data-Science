I've made quite a few chocolate cakes from scratch and this rates up there as one of the best(flourless chocolate cake is the best-I am a HUGE chocolate lover!)
I took others advice and used more unsweetened chocolate-more like 6 ounces(I used Ghirardelli-spend a little extra on a better quality chocolate-it makes a difference) and I only used 2 cups brown sugar- and also I used 1/2 cup sourcream and a 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of one full cup of sourcream.  I baked in two 9inch pans for 43 minutes.  I used buttercream fudge frosting from this site and it was soo yummy.  Always make chocolate cake a day or two in advance because chocolate cake taste better with age-the great chocolate flavors come out.

I own my own bakery and I am always looking for a great chocolate cake recipe.  I made this cake just to try it out to see if it was something that I would use for my customers in the bakery.  The cake was too bitter, too dense and I found that it didn't have a good taste.  The taste testers (my employees) have tasted good and bad cake and we were all in agreement that while it wasn't the worst cake, it wasn't good either.  Sorry...I will try again, but I am not holding out hope.

This cake was excellent.  I used triple the amount of chocolate, as recommended.  I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, so I reduced the amount of sugar.  I also used coffee instead of the boiling water which added a nice taste.  I split the recipe in half and made one 9" cake and had enough batter left over to make 6 cupcakes.  The cake was very fudgey and yet was not too heavy.  It was also very moist.  I served it with white chocolate mousse and strawberries and everyone loved it.  I would definetly recommend this recipe.

This is a good, dependable chocolate cake that doesn't require a lot of monkeying around with to make it so.  I did use 4 ounces of chocolate rather than 3,  but only because I used a Ghirardelli 4 ounce bar - since it was unsweetened, I couldn't exactly eat the remaining ounce!  It's kind of middle of the road in color; not too milk chocolatey light, but neither is it deep, dark blackish brown - it's just a nice chocolate brown with plenty of good, chocolate taste, perhaps in part because I used hot coffee rather than the boiling water which makes the chocolate bloom.  It's very moist, with a more sturdy, compact crumb - in other words, it's a little heavier than what you might contrast with that of a boxed cake mix.  I was quite happy it.  I baked it in two 9" layers, filled it with chocolate ganache and frosted it with a marshmallow buttercream.  Dare I say, it almost tasted like a Hostess Cupcake?  (Four stars rather than five, only because there are a couple of other chocolate cake recipes on this site that would trump ANY other chocolate cake recipe)

Okay, I think I've finally found the BEST chocolate cake recipe EVERRRR!!  I increased the chocolate to 10 oz and reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  This cake came out soooo thick and moist and fluffy.  Don't be afraid of the caramel frosting--I was hesitant about it at first but I'm glad I made it because it tastes so so good (I did decrease the powdered sugar to 1 cup because we don't like overly sweet things).  Try this cake!!!

AWESOME sums it up!  It is a heavier textured cake, with the best flavor!  I am not normally a chocolate cake lover, I made it for my husband.  I can't leave it alone!  I took the advice of putting in five squares of chocolate, I wouldn't go any less.  I didn't have all unsweetened chocolate so I used three semi-sweet and two unsweetened, which worked perfect.  I also used the Buttercream frosting found here instead of the Caramel Icing.  I wouldn't change anything else!  SPECTACULAR!!!  Looks like no more cake mixes for me, this is WELL worth the little bit of effort it took to make. :)  Enjoy!

A)Instead of 3 eggs, I used just 1 (it made the cake denser, less cake-like and more brownie-like). 
B)I replaced 1 cup of the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour. 
C)I used fat free sour cream. 
D)I increased the chocolate to 5 squares. 
E)I used a bundt pan

Also, instead of the caramel frosting, I made a cream cheese frosting. The cake is outstanding.

Absolutely FABULOUS chocolate cake recipe. I had been using the Hershey's chocolate cake recipe for a couple of years now but this one beat it out hands down. From now on this is the only chocolate cake recipe I'll use. I had 6 different people taste it and they were all amazed at how rich, moist, and delicious it was. It is also to be noted that I made this cake without eggs and it was STILL great. I replace the eggs with Ener-G Egg Replacer and it worked out perfect. Thanks so much for a great recipe. :)

Although the cake was moist the chocolate flavor of it was off. The sour cream gave it a bitter taste. If your looking for a fudge tasting cake this is not it.

This cake WAS fabulous, moist, rich dense... it was good. I used cocoa and oil instead of baking chocolate and it was still rich. I did increase it to the equivilent of 5 ounces of chocolate, like some reviewers suggested. Instead of the caramel frosting, I topped it with my own caramel pecan topping which was awesome. Cook 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, 2 T. flour and 1 egg in a saucepan until thickened. Stir in 3/4 cup chopped pecans and 1 tsp. vanilla. Thanks for the recipe.

I totally get this cake. Bravo Charmaine Brooks! When you take a bite of this cake the magic happens in your mouth. This cake melts in your mouth into fudge, that's right a big ol' bite of the homemade fudge you make at Christmastime. The silky, soft chocolate cake mixes with the buttery, sugary, creamy frosting and your mouth is full of fudge. The texture of the frosting mixed with the cake is pure fudge just like you buy squares of at the candy shop. I used semi-sweet chocolate squares and swapped strong brewed coffee for the boiling water. The batter is thin but do not fret it bakes into a soft, fine crumb, silky cake. This recipe made 24 cupcakes and one 9 inch round cake. For me the cupcakes did not dome they were flat but nice and moist. They did not stand up to the liners being pulled away as they were so soft. The round cake was very pretty with the frosting poured over it.

This cake is absolutely AMAZING!!!  The other reviews that stated it tastes better as each day passes are right, it does taste richer with age.  I did not follow the recipe exactly because I substituted one cup of plain non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, simply because my system does not agree with sour cream and I have made the same substitution sucessfully in other recipes.  I also used five ounces of semi-sweet baking chocolate instead of unsweetened.  The semi-sweet was all I had and other reviewers had mentioned using it as well.  The cake was definitely not too sweet, I couldn't imagine how it would've turned out had I not used the semi-sweet chocolate.  I do have to say that my boyfriend ABSOLUTELY DISLIKES chocolate and he ate two generous pieces of this cake lol!  That's saying alot!  I didn't use the last four ingredients listed in the recipe to make a frosting, but I used the chocolate buttercream frosting on this website to frost it and it was delicious!  I have recommended this recipe to my friends already!

My favorit chocolate cake recipe! Just made this for a birthday and everyone loved it so much that it was completely gone! I took the advice on substituted broiling water with coffee and it sure added more flavor. The caramel frosting sounded weird to me at first but it went so well with the cake. The cake was moist, dense and fudgy. This is a simple recipe and the outcome is amazing.

OMG! this cake is fantastic! When my daughter told me she wanted  a chocolate fudge cake for her b-day, -- i was kinda leery because i've tried several that were just ...eh. But this one is absolutely perfect! its thick, yet moist and OH so fudgy! I did add extra chocolate like other people had mentioned, i used 7 squares of Semi-sweet instead of unsweetened and it was just right i think! I used Caroline's chocolate fudge frosting w/ it and it turned out terrific!

I must say this is the most moist chocolate cake I have ever eaten! Everybody absolutely raved about this cake! At first I thought it was too sweet so I didn't make the caramel frosting. It smelled so good while baking but when I opened the oven door, There wasn't much smell anymore. I even pinched at the corner of the cake, it tasted bland to me, so I decided to make the caramel frosting. Thinking it was a failure of a cake, I made cupcakes out of the extra batter to taste it. Lo and behold! IT TASTED GREAT! Even without the caramel frosting! Everybody at work loved the cake which has the frosting, and people at home loved the cupcake with/without frosting! It's an absolute hit and people can't get enough of it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I registered as a member of this site SIMPLY so I could review this incredible cake. Based on the very favorable reviews, I knew that I had a decent cake recipe on hand, but I had no idea the extent of this cakes deliciousness! I made it before a get-together with a few friends, and every SINGLE one of them professed that this was the best cake they had ever had. In fact, they even sang "For She's a Jolly Good Fellow" in honor of my bringing this wonderful cake to their home! The only changes I made to this recipe are as follows: 1) I used 6 of the 1oz unsweetened chocolate squares, and 2) I used 3/4 a cup of sour cream, simply because that was all I had on hand. And my my, how marvelously it turned out. I paired it with an incredible chocolate fudge buttercream frosting that I found on this site. Baker beware- once you share this cake with your friends, you will be hounded to make it again and again as long as you know them!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Cindy.

Awesome cake! First time making one from scratch and it turned out perfect! Used 6oz of chocolate like others suggested. Also, baked in two 9" round pans at 375 for 35 minutes. Also used recipe for Chocolate Buttercream Frosting. Couldn't have been more perfect!

Let me start by saying that I'm not much of a baker.  But this cake was a breeze to make & turned out GREAT!!  I only made a slight change purely by mistake I used semisweet chocolate as opposed to unsweetened & used about 8 onces instead of the reccomended 6.  I bought a pound plus bar from Trader Joes I was in a hurry & didn't notice the semisweet on the label & unfortunatly nowhere on the wrapper does it say the wt. per sq., so I used 1/2 the bar.  Long story short (too late) it was delish.  But let the cake come to room temp before serving & it's crazy moist & fudgy!! Oh used a buttercream frosting I also found on the site instead of the caramel.

Yummy!  This cake turned out awesome.  I took it into work for a co-workers birthday and everyone loved it.  I baked it in a bundt pan, used 5 squares semi-sweet chocolate and reduced sugar.  Thanks for the gr8 recipe.....I will use this one again!

Simply Ah-Mazing! Easy to cook, not complicated, and tastey. It's very rich and delightful, I made this for my fathers birthday and he loved it. Instead of the caramel frosting I used chocolate and filled with a chocolate fudge inside. Hrmm Also cooked in a bunt pan and filled the inside with strawberries and topped with nuts.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had, because I prefer a denser, moister cake in the chocolate flavor category.

This cake really is All It's Cracked Up To Be, although I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the amount of chocolate I used. Not like chocolatey like fudgy brownies - more like luscious, fruity, dense and moist chocolate cake.

with some alterations I found that this is the absolute best recipe for chocolate cake but I made MANY changes. First, I cook with a digital scale because I find it more acurate so I changed it to metric. 2nd, 24 servings is HUGE so I halved the recipe to 12 servings.  I reduced the flour to 120 g,  reduced sugar to 100g white sugar &100g raw sugar,  2 eggs (instead of 1.5),  increased chocolate to 60 g,  and used 30 g mayonaise instead of 115 g sour cream.  I iced it with home made whipped cream as a base to black forrest cake but it could have been eaten plain. It was light and moist at the same time (which is REALLY hard to find). With the revised recipe 8 people can have small but satisfying pieces.

Yum! Great recipe, you do need a MASSIVE bowl as it makes so much, I was brave and tipped all the batter into one large round baking tin, i had to give it another 20 minutes in the oven but it did cook through eventually and it was GORGEOUS!! I put rasberry jam (jelly) in the middle and frosted it with chocolate fudge icing...ooohhh it was good.

Delicious! Even though I had a horrid time making this it was not the recipes fault! I forgot to add the cup of boiling water so I hade to take the cake out of the oven (had only been in there a few seconds) and pour it back in the bowl and add the water in! Anyway, despite that, it was delicious. Moist and soft! I used a butter cream icing from this site and then sprinkled crushed chocolate chips on top. I made them into cupcakes. For the chocolate squares I used cocoa because I did not have the squares. It worked perfect because the back of the box told me that for one square of chocolate use 3 tablespoons of cocoa and 1 tablespoon of oil. I used the equivalent of 5 squares like everyone said. Great recipe!

This cake is worth every star.  I used a simple chocolate icing. My co-workers went crazy for this cake.  I love the texture.
I listened to the other reviewers and followed their advice of increasing the chocolate squares.  Don't think of using less than the 5 squares if you are a chocolate lover.  
Very enjoyable for the chocolate lover.

This cake is wonderful, and there aren't many kids that don't like chocolate.  Next time I would leave out the carmel icing, much better cake without it.

I really enjoyed this cake. Mine turned out nicely moist while not too dense. It does appear a very slight bit lower in the center, but it's not an issue at all. Not "sunken" like some have commented. I like that the chocolate called for can be increased per other comments. I like to see people's tweaks...that's what cooking is about. I've always found it interesting the extreme differences of opinion on recipes I guess. I didn't find this too time consuming or hard to make at all. It's not a box mix so it takes more than 3 steps. I typically assume that any radical differences from other outcomes is due to my oven, over-mixing, etc. I would advise trying others' tweaks and get to know your oven, this is a good little cake and honestly I'd rather use this instead of a mix any day. I'm sure the icing could be easily halved, not everyone can stand that same level of sweetness. I sprinkled a pinch of sea salt on top on a still warm serving of my first piece...DEElicious!!

I wanted a chocolate cake to make for my sons 8th birthday and based on the reviews, chose this one. I have to say, it was a pretty bad cake. It was entirely too dense, actually sinking in the middle once the cake cooled. 

I though about lessening the eggs and maybe not putting in so much sugar, but thought I should at least follow the recipe before I began tweaking it.

This recipe as it's written is too sweet and flavorless.  The sweetness is almost sickning. I have made it as written and with changes (more chocolate, coffee etc) and either ways it just not good. I also found no "fudgyness" in the cake at all. There are much better recipes out there.

This was not to my liking. The middle of the cake sunk in and the edges were burnt really bad. When I took it out, the middle was soupy. It tasted pretty bad and nearly inedible because of the raw center. Never making this again.

I believe the person who found this cake to be "bitter" must have had some bad ingredients.  I just made this today and it is THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever made (and I'm 62!).  I love allrecipes.com because of the reviews, and I invariably follow some of the advice. For this cake, I used 4 oz. unsweetened and 1 oz. semisweet (because that's what I had), took the brown sugar to 2.25 cups, and used 2 eggs instead of 3.  I love, love, love this cake.

I used 6 squares of chocolate, as I had seen some other reviewers suggest. I also used semi-sweet chocolate, as it was the only kind I could find at the store when I went.  I thought it was too sweet and not chocolaty enough. Next time, I think I'll reduce the sugar, maybe increase the chocolate a little bit more, and try harder to find unsweetened chocolate. But then, I personally like really bitter chocolate products.  The cake was still very good, and had a really interesting texture to it. I was afraid of the sour cream because I don't like it, but you can't tell it's in there at all.  Also, I did not make this icing, but instead threw together a chocolate butter cream icing without a recipe. Mmm.

This cake is fantastic!  It is very moist and easy to make.  I read the other reviews and added more chocolate (three ghiradelli bars) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I even used light sour cream (it was all I had) and it turned out great!

I doubled the amount of chocolate squares and used only two cups of brown sugar.  I forgot to add the cup of boiling water and the cake still turned out pretty well.  It had more of a brownie consistency.  I'll probably make this again...only next time, I'll include the boiling water!  Oh, and I frosted it using Chocolate Frosting I (also from this website).

This is the BEST chocolate cake I ever had.  It is very moist and mine was a little bit too sweet as I didn't realize the last four ingridients were for the caramel sauce :) In addition to adding all the extra sugar, I used 10 oz of semisweet chocolate.  Even though it was a little too sweet, it was still the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  The caramel sauce was so delicious... I can't wait to make it again... I am so thankful for this recipe, thank you allrecipes.com.

This was really good, the only problem I had was getting it out of the pan.  It was super moist...so much it stuck to the pan.  Will try greasing it differently next time.  Otherwise it disappeared in one birthday sitting :)

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews before I made this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Needed lots more chocolate!!  The icing way overpowered the cake, which had very little flavor.

WOW!  What an AMAZING cake!  This was my first "from scratch" cake, and as long as you follow the directions as written, this is a cake that will come out perfect!  I also made my frosting from scratch (the reason I decided to start making cakes from scratch) & found that I could eat this cake without the frosting!  Don't let the color of the batter when it's mixed fool you... it was as dark, and tasty as the picture showed!  Oh!  I used two 9 x 1 pans, so I want to say it took a little less time to cook.  I started really watching after 20 minutes or so.

This is the best cake say I and everyone I've made it for. The only thing I do differently is I don't put in the 1/4 cup milk or 1 3/4 cups confectioner's sugar. I throw in an extra handful of flour if batter seems thin, and sometimes I put in 4 squares of chocolate instead of 3 for darker chocolate taste. 

See Carol's Maple Butter Frosting for an ideal one to go with this cake. I make it into a chocolate frosting recipe by not putting in the maple extract and adding 6 squares of melted chocolate and 1/4 cup cocoa to offset sweetness of confectioner's sugar. Together they are heaven!

I followed other's advice and used more chocolate, but I used 8 oz bittersweet chocolate chips instead of 3 unsweetened, 1 cup coffee instead of water, 2 eggs for a more dense cake, and 1.5 cups of brown sugar because the chips are sweet.  Came out great!  Used ganache on top and whipped ganache between layers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't the chocolate cake I was looking for.  Kids didn't think it was that great either.  I increased the chocolate but still wasn't chocolatey enough.  I will continue looking for the perfect chocolate cake recipe.

Oh, my this is good. My 11 yr old son (first time making a cake) made this tonight. It was better than any cake I've made. Only problem was with the  icing. It must have harden to fast and had crunchy chunks of caramel (but eh, what's wrong with that).

Made this for a co-worker for her birthday.  This cake was awesome and it got rave reviews.  The only change I made was I added 6 squares of chocolate instead of the called for 3.  It was a moist, dense cake that was loved by all.  Topped it off with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting I got from this site.  Will definatly make this again.

Its really FUdgey! My cake came out really dense, like a brownie. Only alterations I did was to put in 5 blocks of chocolate and threw in 200g of chocolate chips. Found the caramel too sweet. Maybe I'll pass the caramel frosting and do a normal chocolate one instead.

This cake was really good, light and fudgey. The only thing that I didn't like much was that it is not very chocolatey, and I doubled the chocolate! I think 5 squares of chocolate is not enough for such a big recipe.

Cake is moist but is much too sweet - have to cut down the sugar on both cake and icing and it will be great.

this is the bestest chocolate fudge cake I have ever tried in my whole life. but I made some changes to the recipe. instead of adding dark or milk chocolate, I used white chocolate which made the texture of it even more velvety.... yummmmm!!! I think that everyone should try this. its absolutey irresistible!

I did not care for this recipe. The cake fell in the center and would NOT come out of the pan despite greasing and flouring. I also made some cupcakes with it (they also fell in the centers), they were in foil baking cups also greased and the cake still stuck. When I tried to peel them out they just fell apart and were completely un-usable.

this was a pretty good cake very moist... almost too much so it fell apart a little getting out of the pan.5 min to cool in the pan was not enough. I didnt realize untill after i started making it that I only had 2 1oz squares of chocolate so i used some cocoa but it wasnt quite chocolatey enough. if i made it again I would probably take others advice and double the chocolate. I didnt make the frosting I used it to make a black forest cake and it worked well.Yum!

i'm very disappointed after all this work and shopping for special ingredients that I don't  regularly have in my kitchen like sour cream and unsweetened chocolate. The  only change I've made is using 2cups of sugar and doubled the chocolate , so even after I doubled the chocolate I felt like it's not very fudgy  besides I baked it only for 30 mins and on oven temperature 325 and it was done . Any way it came out very dense and not very moist as I was excepting . i'm gonna stick to my recipe which calls for less ingredients and less effort and the result is way much better

I added some extra chocolate to this recipe and also lowered the amount of sugar. I made this recipe earlier this year for Valentine's Day and my husband and I LOVED it! I then later caught my father finishing it off right out of the fridge. He requested it for his birthday :) Definitely recommend this recipe!

All around great recipe!  The cake turned out moist and had a nice flavor.  I do wish it had a bit more chocolate flavor.  The topping was awesome and went really well with the cake...it was eaten quickly in our house!!!

I would give this 3.5 stars.  Of the cakes I have tried this one is definitely in the lower half of choices.  I did try it with the extra chocolate still to no avail.  The texture was so-so, the flavor was decent, but I won't make this one again.  When I take time to make a cake from scratch, it needs to beat one out of the box or I've wasted my time, this one didn't pass that test.

This is my second time making this cake and it sunk in a little bit this time. It was still fabulous and yummy! I increased the chocolate to 8 oz and used 3/4 of water with instant coffee dissolved in it. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter.

Blissful. Divine. Supurb. I really liked it. A lot. Can you tell? I'll never make any other chocolate cake again. This was rich, fudgey, dense, moist and cut so easily and cleanly, which was really nice for serving it. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe (hands down the best frosting I've ever tasted), which is also found here on Allrecipes. I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could! (I DID double the amount of chocolate that the recipe calls for!)

this is one of the best recipes i have tried from scratch because its moist and rich - i added extra chocolate and 1/4 cup sugar to enhance the chocolate flavour so it was not too bitter.  Overall very great and almost like a black forest brownie fudgy cake!!

This cake came out very good and moist and fudgey. It got stuck to the top of my mouth and I def. needed something to drink with it. To me that is a good thing. It is very rich. I made it and frosted it with Hersheys Perfectly Chocolate Frosting and topped it with chopped pecans. The only thing I did different was add 10 ounces of unsweetened chocolate as other reviewers had suggested.

This stayed moist for nearly a week! I shared it with the ladies at the laboratory and they absolutely loved it. One even requested that I bake it for her nephew's birthday party next month! Excellent cake that I can't rave about enough. I increased the chocolate to an entire bar but that was the only change I made.

This cake is wonderful! I did take many suggestions already mentioned like: 6 squares instead of 3 of the unsweetened chocolate, low fat sour cream, and instead of the caramel icing, I used the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting also found on this site.

Excellent cake.  I used 7 squares of Chocolate and added some coffee grains to my boiling water, this made it sweet, dense and a fudge like consistency. Thank you for this great reciped.  This will be the only Chocolate recipe for me!!

wow. this was fantastic. and easy to make! I made it for my mom's birthday and everybody loved it!   I tweaked this a little by using a little less sugar (1/2 or 1 cup less.. i eyeballed it) and more chocolate (sweetened, because I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate)  turned out to be just the enough amount of sweetness overall, with the icing. when I spread icing in between layers of the cake, it soaked into the cake and made it moist and soooo good.

I liked how easy it was to put together. But I think the next time I try the recipe I will splurge and buy a better quality chocolate. The end result was too close to a boxed cake mix for me.

This cake was just wonderful....perfect for a birthday cake.  I made two layers with almond frosting and it tasted great.  The texture was perfect.  We're making another one today!

Yum! So rich and good and delicious. I did use an extra ounce of chocolate and 2 eggs instead of 3. Don't really know if this changed anything but this cake turned out really well.

Made this for a birthday, it tasted great.  The only changes I made were to up the quantity of chocolate and I used semi-sweet.  I also used 2 round pans and it came out just fine.  Iced with the creamy chocolate frosting found on this website.  It came out very rich, great for chocolate lovers!

I am olny rating this a 4 becuase I took all the advice from the previous reviewers.  Substituted some 1 cup cocoa for flour, added more chocolate and accidently made it semi-sweet, 2 eggs instead of 3, and substituted 1/2 cup heavy cream for sour cream. I put a vanilla ice cream layer between the cake layers and crushed de-creamed oreo coated in chocolate syrup and drizzled with hot fudge between ice cream and cakes.  I then iced it with the oreo cream frosten from the oreo cake recipe!  It was amazing.  My family loved it and were amazed at how good it was and very decadent but, this is not for people who do not enjoy rich foods.

Delicious cake. Only change I did was use Star Buck house blend coffee in place of the boiling water. I frosted cake with Carolines Fudge frosting from this website.

we tripled the chocolate as suggested by other reviewers and it was great.  we used a chocolate icing recipe from this site.  only suggestion would be to use a loose icing or glaze, as the cake was crumbling during application of icing.  we ended up freezing the cake to ice and all was well.  thanks

What a shame! The batter was DELICIOUS! :) Then I cooked it...
I feel bad rating this so low because it must have been a mistake on my part. Perhaps I put it too high in the oven... 
Anyway, The outside and top went rock hard and the middle stayed completely mushy! I just couldn't eat it, my dad good-naturedly gulped down his portion but it was pretty gross. No offense to the origional author, though...

This was good but it had sort of an odd taste to it, I suspect it might be the brown sugar.  I think next time I make it I'll decrease the brown a little and add some white sugar. Otherwise very good!

My family loved this cake. It was super moist and tasty. I change 1/4 cup of flour for 1/4 cup of cocoa and it worked fine. I was a little scared about the running batter, but it worked just fine. I really recommend this recipe!

This cake is excellent. It is very straight forward and easy to do. I used the buttercream frosting as well and gave it as a birthday cake- it was such a big hit.

This was a home run.  I,like many others added extra chocolate, 6 squares. I thought I overcooded it because it wasn't done in 35 min., so I added another 4 min. and the edges looked a bit too done.  I always make my cakes the day before and sure enough the next day it was wonderful.  My family loved it.  I will definatley make this cake again, and again, and again.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this last night for a baby shower. The caramel frosting was a huge hit. Like some other reviewers, I used more than 3 oz. of chocolate. I had 2 oz. of a Nestle Dark Chocolatier bar and added 4 oz. of unsweetened chocolate to it. It was amazing! I'll definitely be making this cake again.

This cake came out great. Like others, I used 5 pieces of chocolate, which I think was the perfect amount. Also, I didn't make the caramel frosting but a coffee butter frosting (found on allrecipes), which everyone just raved about. The icing and cake really complimented each other. Definetly will make this cake again.

This was good but I took advice of others and added 5 chocolate squares. I also didn't have enough sour cream so I substituted w/ 1/2 cup non fat plain yogurt and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream. It still tasted really rich! Also added some extra chocolate chips. I split the cake in half and used Ganache filling and smothered the outside w/ Ganache...mmmm!!! good

This cake was awesome. I made it for my brother's 10th birthday and everyone raved about it. I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and it added alot. I topped it with chocolate icing m and ms, and gummy worms and it looked great and tasted fabulous, though I would not make without chocolate chips!!

Wow!  I have tried many chocolate cakes in my years with doing wedding cakes and I would have to say that this one outrates all others!!!

Thanks so much for sharing your receipe!!  #1

I made this yesterday for my son's birthday.  It was wonderful!  I used 5 squares of chocolate and made 2 round cakes.  I didn't use the caramel topping, I instead made the French Buttercream frosting from this site. This will be the cake I make all the time now!

I made this cake for my chocoholic husbands' birthday and was he a happy fellow!  I used five squares of chocolate instead of three.  When I was making the caramel icing, I didn't sift the confectioners sugar - it remained rather lumpy.  So I added a couple of heaping tablespoons of crunchy peanut butter - my logic was that if it looked lumpy, then maybe some of the lumps should be there on purpose!  Boy, did that taste delicious!  This was the fudgiest cake I have ever eaten! Charmaine - you described the cake perfectly!  Thanks!

I made a smaller version, doubling the chocolate, reducing the sugar by a third, forgoed the icing and replaced the hot water with Bailey's.  Nice and alcoholic with a hint of coffee. YUM (^_^)

I read all the reviews before i made this cake and i decided to add a few things. To the batter: I added an extra square of unsweet chocolate. I mixed in a cup of pecan peices, a cup of coconut flakes, and about half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chunks (ok ok ok .. maybe a little more then half). Then i decided it was proboboly going to be VERY rich and i chose a whipped cream topping instead of the caramel which didnt really appeal to me in the first place. I used the Stabilized whipped cream iceing from this site. To decorate the cake i toasted the remaning coconut flakes as well as about 1/3 of a cup of pecans (i crushed them a little bit) and i used that mixture to coat the cake by just patting it gently into the iceing with my hand. IT LOOKED SOOO PRETTY!! and then i melted some of the semi-sweet chunks in a plastic bag and drizzeled a thin stream of chocolate all over the top! It looked and smelled soooo amazing! its the best cake i've ever attempted! thanks for the recipe!

Lovely and moist. I did a smaller version with half the amount of sugar but some extra chocolate, and served it with sour cream rather than icing, making it feel quite grown up!

A delicious home-made flavor cake.  Fills up the 9" x 13" pan.  I recommend this recipe.

I loved the cake. The very first time I made it, I accidentally used only 1 ounce of chocolate, and well it was good, it wasn't very chocolaty. After that, I have always used 1 ounce unsweetened, and 3 ounce semi-sweet. The caramel icing is definitely a plus. All in all, I adore this recipe

I'm from the caribbean and always looking for famous recipes with a twist. I love chocolate cake and this one is indeed worth the time. It was solo moist that it broke when coming out of pan. I added pureed strawberries in cream cheese frosting. My friends came by just to the it out. Big hit. Thanks again!

I've tried this twice, and both times the center of the cake remained gluey, no matter how long I cooked it. I followed the recipe exactly both times, and it was a complete and utter disaster. Never again.

Wow, I  was more than a bit surprised by how good this cake was.  We were snowed-in on my son's birthday and I was determined to find a recipe that I had all of the ingerdients for so he could have his chocolate cake. This turned out to be one of the best cakes I've had in a long time. The texture was great, dense but not too heavy. I used 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate ( because that is what I had ) and the flavor was nice,but I would think the more chocolate, the better. I used "rick's special buttercream" which is my go-to frosting. This made a great treat for when we came in from a long day playing in the snow. Will definately make this over and over again.

This was the absolute best cake I have ever had or made. (I used 5 squares of baking cocoa and also made homemade buttermilk chocolate frosting). I feel that with this recipe if you follow the directions well your end result will be a delicious, rich, moist cake that you would find in a fine bakery shop. Definitely a new favorite love!

Pretty good recipe, a lighter and tasty chocolate cake. Next time I will try something with berries or brandy for instead of the caramel. Ok just too sweet. I followed th suggestion of 5 squares of chocolate; two un-sweet and 3 semi sweet. Perfect sweet and flavor mix.

How disapointing!!! Lacks in flavour! I added the extra chocolate but still - and surprisingly not sweet enough either! It also tasted too buttery! I thought it was going to be almost as good as black magic cake as the recipe is similar - but no! I`ll definitely be sticking to the other recipe! For all the work this cake took to make... not worth it.

My son, 13 years old, made this almost all by himself.  He followed the recipe exactly, though he was unnerved at the end when the batter was so liquid.  We split it into two cake pans and it cooked up great.  Also, we used freshly ground pastry flour and it was still great.  The taste was even better after letting it sit over night.

I upped the chocolate to 6 squares per other reviewers but hubby said it wasn't all that chocolately but was still good.  Will make again sometime in the future...but will use 9 squares.  For the first time in 5 years, I regret not having a blender...my arm sure hurt the next day but the consistency of the cake was great.

This was awesome.  I want to mention that the batter is very runny, like soup, but don't be alarmed.  It should be like that.  I was skeptical as I've never seen runny batter before, but it baked up soooo beautifully.  Made this for my stepfathers 50th birthday and already got a request from my brother in law for his birthday. I baked in two 8inch pans, used chocolate ganache filling with sliced strawberries, and iced it with chocolate fudge buttercream (from this site).  So good, rich and fudgy.

This really IS the most fabulous cake!  I unfortunately didn't realize I was out of sourcream until half-way through mixing. Rather than drop everything and run to the store, I used two individual serving cups of key lime pie yogurt (I was desperate)and it turned out amazing!!!! This cake must be fullproof because I noticed many others had to make various substitutions and theirs all turned out tasty too. I also used the chocolate buttercream frosting (subbing hazelnut spread for the hot fudge) and my guests were so impressed they took two more servings home with them!  This will definately be in my recipe box for all time.

No more cake mixes for me!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Almost forgot the boiling water. Just thought the batter was REALLY thick.  In the end, I got it in the over in the recommended pan.  YUMMERS.  My 20 year old son cut a hunk off and ate it hot.  He LOVED it.

This cake is great, fudgy, dense, and delicious.  It has a lot of fans in my house, and gets made for every chocolate lovers birthday.  I make it with the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting from this site, and it is awesome.  Definitely up the chocolate to 6 or so ounces, like everyone else says, however I don't recommend reducing the sugar.  I've done that a couple times, and it comes out too dry.  I also beat the egg whites and fold them in at the end, and I add a quarter cup of mayonnaise.  With those changes, it comes out a bit lighter, very moist and tender, and just wonderful.

I didn't care for the way this turned out.  There was way too little chocolate and far too much egg.  Although it was pleasantly sweet, it did not resemble a chocolate cake in consistency or taste.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday, and it's AWESOME! I increased the unsweetened chocolate squares to five, as recommended by another reviewer, and baked it in two 9" round pans. It came out high, dense (but in a good way) rich and delicious! Raves from everyone in the office, even the non-chocolate lovers - thanks!

This is an excellent, moist cake. One of the best I've tried. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it was so moist, it stuck to the pan in spots (I used a Wilton specialty pan...Tinkerbell)

This recipe is amazing! I made it into cupcakes for a party and everyone loved them. I'm not normally a chocolate cake fan, but this one is exceptional. The only thing I changed was 5 baker squares chocolate (instead of 3).

I cannot imagine why there were any negative reviews on this cake.  It was a big hit and I got many compliments.  I used the 6 oz. of Ghirardelli. Both the additional ounces and Ghiradeli were a definite plus. Be aware that when it says use a large bowl, it means a LARGE bowl!  I was using a 8 c. and it was full and I had difficulty stirring in the boiling coffee (I also took this substitute suggestion).  Be aware it is a lot of batter as I made a 2 layer (9") cake and 9 cupcakes.  I frosted with the White Cake Frosting 1 which is fantastic - not too sweet and easy to work with. PS It is now 2018 (1st reviewed in 2008)  and I am, once again, making this cake for my daughter-in-law's birthday!  Everyone loves this cake.

This was a very good recipe. It is a little on the heavy side (similar to a banana bread) but delicious anyway. I also added more dark chocolate than recipe called for (I used Dove brand). I think I might have forgotten to add the baking soda, but it turned out great. I plan on making it again. It definitely outshines any boxed cake mix! For the negative reviews, I can only think that these bakers did not follow the recipe exactly. NOTE: I also decided to use frosting for this cake, the exact name is "Chocolate Frosting I" submitted by tianne. I love Allrecipes! This site is fantastic!

Yummy! Hubby was real happy when he walked in the house to smells of this cake! The caramel icing is good, but I think I will try a chocolate buttercream next time. Thanks!! Just what my sweet tooth was looking for this evening.

Very good. Thick and rich.  I also added some extra chocolate and frosted with Whipped Cream Cheese  Frosting from this site.  Not too sweet, very adult cake. Pretty easy to prepare.  I would make this again.  Use softened butter.

I used this cake recipe to make a horse cake for my daughter's birthday party.  The cake was fabulous and so moist - everyone raved!  I didn't use the caramel icing, but instead used the Chocolate Fudge and French Buttercream Frostings on this website, which were both to die for.  Will definitely put this in my recipe box!

Excellent cake! I did a 2 layer cake instead of a sheet cake, and it turned out perfectly. The frosting sets up too quickly for frosting a layer cake, so I suggest using the carmel frosting in the receipe between the 2 layers and make a chocolate frosting for the top and sides of the layer cake as this frosting receipe sets up too quickly to ice anything other than a sheet cake.

Maybe I am a dad cook or the  weather conditions were just too cool! The  melted chocolate didn’t seem enough to turn the cake into a chocolate cake and turned the chocolate into clamps when mixing -thank goodness I added the extra coffee in the hot water at least I’ll have chocolate cake with chocolate chips in it!

I’m a cookie baker but never had success with cakes from scratch. I’ve been determined to make a cake from scratch and have it turn out, so decided to try this one based on all the good reviews. The only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon of espresso powder. This cake is AWESOME!!  Adding the espresso powder or 1 cup of brewed coffee is definitely the way to go, coffee always amps up the flavor of chocolate without it tasting like coffee or mocha. I just pulled it out of the oven and couldn’t even wait for it to cool, hub and I ate a small piece of warm cake without any icing and it was simply delicious!!! I think the brown sugar in this recipe really adds depth.  You will not be disappointed in this cake!!

I usually only make cake from a box but after purchasing a new mixer, I decided I needed to make one from scratch. I chose this recipe and I’m glad I did!  It wasn’t too difficult to make, especially for a non Baker like me. And the taste is outstanding!  It is a little heavy, but very moist and tasty. I definitely will make this cake again.

It is delicious but....it isn’t cooked after 35 minutes. The center is very liquidy. Ten minutes more and a toothpick comes out clean but....the center sinks as it cools.  Every time. Not sure what to do

Sift the icing sugar to avoid lumps.  Work fast spreading icing as well, because it seizes up quickly.

Added  hot coffee instead of boiling  water. I didn't find It at all bitter but I used à high quality chocolate ( Cailler Swiss baking chocolate 64% cocao). I made cupcakes instead of cake (25 min. Instead of 35) .

This was a hit! Very easy to make, I made half the recipe and baked it in a glass loaf pan. I cut the oven temp to 325 because of glass pan and then it took 55 minutes to fully bake. I did increase the unsweetened chocolate as other suggested using 3 oz for half the recipe. When the cake was fully cooled, I sliced it lengthwise to make it a 2 layer cake then frosted with this website's Chocolate Buttercream frosting. Everyone raved.

Love the cake!  It is so moist and tasty.  I will be making it again.  I didn't care for the frosting, it was too sugary.  I will choose a light frosting to go with the cake next time.

Every time I make this cake, every one just comments on how good it is.  It's my favourite chocolate cake hands down!  I have tried many and this is my favourite...it's so good, especially a couple of days old.  I add extra chocolate into it(a mixture of dark and milk) and add like 1/2 cup of cocoa powder for a deeper flavour.
So good with chocolate ganache, or chocolate or vanilla frosting.  I never add the caramel icing to it, it doesn't need it!  Makes it way too rich and disgustingly sweet.

I had to resist temptation.  Temptation to use 2 eggs (instead of 3), temptation to use half white sugar and half brown sugar (who ever heard of a chocolate cake recipe with no white sugar), and temptation to substitute milk for  some of the boiling water.   But, I stuck to the recipe (except for the chocolate -- I used 4 oz of Ghirardelli 100% cacao unsweetened baking chocolate, instead of the 3 oz. the recipe called for), and the results were fabulous indeed.  Moist, dense (yet soft and supple) chocolate cake.  No disappointments here...

I used only 1.5 cups sugar, swapped sour cream w plain yogurt, used coffee instead of water, 5 oz of unsweetened chocolate  and made chocolate ganache instead . Was very successful! Came out great! Not overly sweet, dense and moist!

I have been making this fabulous cake for years and always get rave reviews. I use 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and only 2 cups of brown sugar.  I freeze the cake a little before icing it because the crumb is very delicate (not so delicate that it falls apart when cutting, though). I make chocolate ganache for filling between layers and chocolate buttercream for the outside. People always rave about the nice chocolate flavor that isn't overly sweet.  Yesterday, I realized when the cake was in the oven that I forgot to add the boiling water. The cake came out more dense but not as dense as a brownie. My husband and kids actually preferred the cake this way. It was a little too dense for me, so maybe I'll try a half or quarter cup of boiling water next time.

This is the first chocolate cake I've ever made, and I have to say I won't search another recipe!! This cake was just sooo good. I added three times the amount of the indicated chocolate, added hot milk instead of boiling water and whipping cream instead of sour cream. Totally recommended!

I added a few teaspoons extra cocoa powder to make it extra chocolate. I found that this cake was only okay the day I made it, but the next day it tasted fabulous. I froze the leftovers and even thawed it was amazing. So heads up- I think it tastes best after it sits for a day or two. It is super moist and fudgy- a nice dense cake.

We loved this cake! I didn't have enough sour cream so mostly used softened cream cheese in place. Otherwise, did just as the recipe said. Big hit!

The amount of chocolate stated in the recipe is small. I added around 4 - 5 times the amount stated to use. It still wasnt chocolately enough. The texture of this cake is light and velvety. I prefer a cake that's really dense and rich.

I made this cake as a special request, and i royally messed up when making it. That step about adding the boiling water? Yeah... I wad so busy yakking that I forgot.  I ended up with a thick batter, but it was working, so it didn't click until the cupcakes were halfway done baking and I opened the microwave to find the water. Crud.  I mixed a little water into the batter I had left, so those cupcakes came out normal and quite perfect and yummy. 
As for the first 3 dozen... This recipe was so awesome that they were totally salvageable! They had fallen in the middle and overflowed out the sides, and they were more like thick, fudgy brownies. So after they cooled, I flipped each over and cut off the edges. Then, I filled them in with chocolate buttercream icing. No one knew any difference!  Yummy! 
I uploaded a photo of the near-catastrophe; look for the side-by-side with Christmas cupcakes on the right.

I found it to be bitter with a dry texture. There is a lack of chocolate flavour and richness even though I used good quality chocolate.

Wow, just wow!!! I am an avid dessert maker & this was just what I was looking for!! It was dense , but not too dense, moist & fudgey! What I won't do again is use parchment paper to line the pans (I did two rounds) as it made the sides dent in on parts around the cake. I could have cut the edges, but my 12 year old daughter told me not to. The icing I used was horrible (Fudgey icing on this site) -it was more like a thick glaze!! The deliciousness of the cake itself saved the day!! Try it exactly as is, you won't regret it!!

There was not enough chocolate in the recipe - the finished product bore no resemblance to the picture displayed!  Cooking time was so very inadequate - at 35 minutes the very outsides of the cake were cooked but the inner 3/4 was still raw and wet. I have since made it again in a 23 x 28cm rectangle pan (line with foil/baking paper and spray with oil) without the boiling water but with the addition of 250grams choc chips, and by increasing the temperature and cooking time to 30 minutes at 175C then increasing to 200C for 10 minutes.  Pour the icing on when still warm and leave overnight before slicing. The outsides of the cake will be light and cakey and the inner parts will be denser and "fudgier".  These changes resulted in the cake being a hit at work - although it was still seen as overly sweet.

The cake itself was delicious and I took people's advice and substituted one cup of coffee for the one cup of water. The only "complaint" I have is that the frosting was extremely sweet, but the cake itself will soon be a staple and go-to chocolate cake recipe in my house!

I'm not a huge cake fan, but this was pretty good. I made a half batch in an 8x8. Instead of using a half egg and half chocolate square, I followed others advice and used 1 egg and 2 oz of chocolate (instead of 1.5 of each). I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because it's what we had.

This was my first time making this yummy chocolate cake on a snowed-in day. Couple changes: mayo instead of sour cream, semisweet chocolate instead of unsweetened, little less brown sugar & hot coffee in place of water. Frosting: A white chocolate (Ghirardelli), cream cheese frosting was used instead of the suggested caramel icing. Very delicious I must say.  My husband added..."Save this recipe, I like it a lot." Yes, we'll keep it.

I needed a heavy cake as I wanted to fill it with a decadent fudge filling. This was perfect. It was moist and flavourful and supported the fudge (and a thin layer of raspberry preserves) exactly as I was hoping. I iced it with white chocolate icing and sprinkled crushed candy canes over. It was the piece de la resistance of Christmas dinner. Labour intensive, yes, but it was a special cake for a special occasion and well worth it.

this cake was okay, it is really moist which i like. I added the coffee as suggested which gave it a nice kick. Mine cooked longer than 35 minutes, close to 45. although the cake was okay, I think it needs a different icing than the one this recipe recommends. Another thing to note, do not let the icing completely cool because this makes it hard to spread nicely, my mistake was I left it to cool for too long and I ended up with a not so presentable spread.  I am going to try this recipe again and use a different icing.

A good, basic chocolate cake.  Five stars for the cake, three stars for the icing.  I used 4 and a half squares of baker's chocolate (instead of the recommended three) and it turned out very chocolaty (I'm glad I used more than three squares).  It took 50 minutes of baking before the toothpick came out clean, but it was still moist and delicious (the very outside edge of the corners got a little dark, but still very edible).  Instead of greasing/flouring the casserole I lined it with parchment paper (with flaps drooping over the edges of the pan) and the cake came out beautifully.   Huge cracks appeared in the surface of the cake, but those can be hidden by frosting.  I'll definitely make this cake again (it would be perfect for a kid's birthday party), but I'll use a frosting rather than this recipe's icing.

A little disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. I find it a little bland even after adding extra chocolate and substituting water for strong coffee. It also fell apart coming out of the pans after sitting for 15 mins, but that could be my fault for not waiting longer. It did taste better the next day for sure, but not any better than a boxed cake.

Didn't really like it.  I bake quite a bit and this cake just did not match up.  It was bland and really needed more chocolate.  The icing was good though; tasted like fudge.  I gave this recipe two stars because it is a very moist cake and the icing is okay, but that is where it ends.

Excellent recipe - straightforward, richly chocolately!  Super moist and well balanced in terms of sweetness.  Note that I didn't use the caramel icing though, because I preferred a vanilla icing that I have used in the past. Baked it in a 10" springform pan which took 25 min longer in the oven.

Very moist.  I made it according to directions for my friend's Birthday and it was a huge hit.  However, I must confess that I did not try the icing in this recipe because I used a whipped cream mousse  posted by another member.  I also have decided since making this according to directions to improvise.  I did this with white chocolate and then improvised the whipped cream mousse to a pistachio flavor and it was sooooo good.  The only thing I changed slightly when using white chocolate was minimized the vanilla by a 1/2 teaspoon since white chocolate is already sweet I figured the vanilla might be too overpowering.

I used this to make a cake for a bridal shower recently, and everyone loved it! I also increased the amount of chocolate as others suggested. I didn't make the carmel sauce- I used buttercream frosting, but the cake itself was great. As a result of making this cake, I still have people asking me if I have baked lately. I wonder if that's a hint???

My 12 year old daughter made this cake for her little brother's birthday and it turned out pretty good.  I wish I had read some of the other reviewer's suggestions to add more chocolate, because it wasn't chocolatey enough for my taste.  It was moist and tasted good though; we'll try it with the extra chocolate next time.

it was a great cake. i decreased the sugar content by about half a cup. i used the "creamy chocolate frosting" recipe and that made up for the lack of sweetness. for a treat, heat a slice on high for 30-45 seconds and top with vanilla or chocolate ice cream. soooo good

This cake was good but by no means was it a 5 star that the majority of the people seem to think. I didn't use the caramel icing because I ran out of brown sugar and used a vanilla glaze from this site. The next time I make it I will use the caramel icing and see if my  assumption of the cake changes.

This recipe makes a huge cake that was fantastic!  It was moist and had the perfect texture.  We loved the icing.  (I reduced the sugar in the cake to 2 cups and used 4 squares of chocolate instead of 3.) It is THE BEST.
