I followed the directions (without a candy thermometer) and this came out great!! Cook till it boils.  Add ingredients..cook till it boils again.. Bring to rolling boil..then cook for 18 min (set your timers) and stir occasionally. I will DEFINATELY make this recipe again! What a nice change from ordinary fudge! Thanks!!

Here's a tip for those of you who said your tin foil stuck to the fudge. DO NOT USE a cheap thin tin foil. Reynolds brand even makes a heavy duty NON STICK FOIL that worked perfectly for me. For those of you who ended up with pumpkin caramel....you didn't cook it long enough...end of story. I used a candy thermometer, and cooking it on medium takes about 25 to 30 min. to get to the softball stage. If you cook it long enough then this recipe is foolproof. I did use an entire 12 oz. bag of the chips and the pumpkin pie spice. I have gotten rave reviews on this.

Nice texture, but has better flavor with 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Once it comes to a boil, turn the heat down so it's just enough to maintain the boil and stir *occasionally* as the directions say, for 18 minutes.  You do not need a thermometer. I checked the temperature after 18 minutes and it was not up to soft ball stage.  I chose to follow the directions rather than my thermometer and the fudge is perfect. It is also good with chopped walnuts.

This recipe is not like traditional chocolate or peanut butter fudge. It's not creamy, but pumpkin isn't creamy. So it should be expected. However it is so tasty. I made this a couple of days ago and had multiple requests for the recipe. Very easy. The changes I made to the recipe were adding a full bag of vanilla chips and adding 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg so that way it would have more pumpkin pie taste. I didn't use a candy thermometer and the fudge wasn't dry or gooey. It set up perfectly. I highly recommend this recipe for a fun Thanksgiving treat.

WOW!! All I can say is that this fudge is fantastic tasting. It's not too sweet and it has a nice even balance of flavors all centered around the pumpkin. It took me three tries to get this right because I had never made fudge before---but once I used a candy thermometer (234 F) for the final boil, this was easy as can be.

Tips for those just trying it out: I replaced the cinnamon with Pumpkin Pie spice, and I just sprayed my pan with a non-stick butter spray instead of using the foil. Other than that, use a candy thermometer to get this right on the last step.

Mmmmm!  First time making pumkpin fudge.  A nice change from chocolate and peanut butter.  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  Use a candy thermometer to ensure that your fudge reaches the soft ball stage (232Â°F).  I also recommend a wisk for combining the ingredients and stirring in the pumpkin, marshmallow creme and chocolate.

I, like others, ended up with a pan of sticky goo. DO NOT USE FOIL to line the pan! The "fudge" sticks to the foil and you cannot remove it. I tried freezing it, heating it up and tearing it out. Nothing worked to get it out of the pan without pieces of foil stuck to it.
I'd rename this "pumpkin caramel".

FANTASTIC!!!  I was so pleased with the results!  I divided it up and asked for reviews from my parents, sisters, & their families, and all of them called me to say how much they enjoyed it.  I did cut the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp.of pumpkin pie spice and it really seemed to bring out the wonderful flavor.  I also was sure to grease the foil with butter and had no problems.  This will definetly be a keeper!

This recipe is awesome.  We had it at one of our fall get togethers and everyone loved it.  So yummy and smooth.  A must for any one to try.  I had no problem getting this to set-up.  Just make sure you do what the recipes says. You have to Stir the mixture the whole time you boil it and must be boiled for the entire 18 minutes. Well, worth all the work.

Just follow this recipe exactly and it comes out perfect. (I substituted carrot puree for the pumpkin just because thats what I had) I use a high quality,heavy pan that is made for even heat conduction. I used a Le Creuset, porcelain enaml covered cast iron pan.I use high quality ingredients. It matters! Especially with the flavor chips. I think it is important to start the 18 minute count AFTER the mixture has reached a true rolling boil (meaning you can stir it and it doesn't stop boiling). This is critical especially if your not using a thermometer. I never try to make candy on a rainy day or if the humidity is very high if I can help it. If you have to you will need to extend the time of your final boil and reach a temp of 236-240. I always have everything ready before I start by putting all the ingredients on the counter and having the pan prepped. That way I will not have to rumage around, chop nuts,line pans etc once I get going - there isn't time for that. Turning off the phone is a good idea, too :) Hope this helps any beginers. This is truely a wonderful recipe that makes an excellent and unigue candy.

This didn't turn out for me. I am the fudge queen, I don't even know how many batches of fudge I have made, but it has been A LOT! This turned out like runny caramel. 1 tip for those who can't get this recipe to turn out, do not make it on a rainy or very humid day. I made it on a rainy day, I think that is 1 big reason why this fudge didn't turn out. I was so frusterated that the fudge didn't turn out, as I have never had fudge turn out that way! I searched for another recipe and tried it the very next day. I have never made fudge where you put the marshmallow creme in while boiling, I have always put it in after removing from heat. So that is what I did for my 2nd attempt. Boil the sugar, milk, pumpkin and butter together. Boil until reaches 234 F. Remove from heat, add chips, marshmallow, vanilla & spice. This turned out perfect!! It is delicious! Good luck!

Absolutely fantastic!  I followed the directions *almost* to a "T".  Only difference is that I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon.  It turned out to be the best pumpkin fudge I've ever had, even from a confectionary.  My mother raved over it, and she's a die-hard chocoholic.  I never thought she'd prefer the pumpkin fudge to the chocolate.  Best advice I can give is FOLLOW THE RECIPE.  Don't worry about candy thermometers and soft ball stage and all that.  Oh, and line the pan with parchment, not aluminum foil.  It doesn't tear as easily when you remove the fudge for cutting.

AMAZING!  I followed the advice of a few reviews the first time I made it, and reduced the amount of sugar- BAD CHOICE! It was sticky goop that never set up. Delicious goop, but not fudge. It sounded so amazing that I couldn't give up. I tried again a couple days later, and followed the recipe to a T. PERFECTION! It's so sweet, so rich, and so pumpkiny! My sister is the eternal fudge critic, and even SHE raved about it. This is definitely becoming a permanent fixture in our holiday season!

The directions are wrong.  You need to add the fluff AFTER removing from heat along with the chips.  The recipe says to bring back to boil for 18 min. once it's been added.  This counteracts the effects of the fluff!  I ended up with Pumpkin Spice Molasses!

I'll start off by saying I'm not a cook by any means.  I'm a girl of convenience.  But I wanted to make some pumpkin fudge for a friend of mine.  Let me tell you, this was SUPER EASY!  I modified it a bit though...

--> I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin spice.  (Instead of all cinnamon.)

--> I added the marshmallow creme AFTER boiling for 18 minutes.

--> I melted the white chocolate before I added to the mixture.

--> I used both methods...the 18 minutes of boiling and a candy thermometer.  Both were spot on.  Just make sure it's a true rolling boil (a.k.a. when you stir it doesn't slow down the boil).

--> I used non-stick foil.

With these modifications, everything turned out amazing!! Highly recommend!

At first I thought that 18 minutes was a long time to boil for, but since I do not have a candy thermometer I had to trust it. Bad move, as soon as I added the white chocolate chips  the mixture was pretty much set before the chips melted(which they didn't completely melt) I was left with a solid block that crumbles when cut and does not even remotely taste like pumpkin. To bad I was so excited. :-(

I made this recipe following it to the letter.  I set my clock to 18 min.  I didn't end up with a hardened product.  It was more like taffy.  I tasted it, and it was good, but not a usable.  I made 3 other batches of fudge that day using different recipes, and they all turned out perfect!.

This stuff is very good. I nice change from normal fudge. I didnt have a problem with it thickening at all just FOLLOW the the instructions and you will be fine. In fact it was already hardening before I got it out of the pan so I had to work quick.

First of all, I have to say this is a wonderful, yummy recipe.

I did everything exactly as the recipe stated and I wonder if people become confused regarding the rolling boil. Do not lower the heat and maintain the rolling boil for the eighteen minutes! This is key.

I should note that as I live in the UK now, I couldn't find marshmallow paste or canned pumpkin. I used a real pumpkin by baking it in about a half inch of water at 500F, removing the rind and blending the flesh. For marshmallows, I simply mixed the butter and a bag of marshmallows over heat as you would do for Rice Krispie Treats. I used this for the marshmallow mix.

All in all, everything turned out great. My advice would be to proceed cautiously and accurately. This was my first attempt at fudge too. :) Good luck!

This recipe tastes fantastic, but, unlike the other two fudge recipes I made the same day, did not set up despite following the directions and using a candy thermometer.  After reading all of the reviews, I'm wondering if it's a certain brand of some ingredient that causes problems for some - it would be interesting to see a comparison of what every person used.  I think I'm going to serve mine in mini-muffin cups with a toothpick, because there's no way our business can afford to throw it away and try again.

I just made this fudge this morning for Thanksgiving tomorrow and it's really good, just follow the directions.  I didn't use a thermometer--just a clock and timed to the 18 minutes.  I think the difficulty with fudge that others also share is defining "rolling boil."  You truly have to cook this 18 minutes once it's rolling, meaning that you stir it and it continues to boil at nearly the same rate, despite the stirring.  My fudge did begin to scorch slightly with 2 minutes left, so I had to stir constantly at that point forward.  It did not impact the taste.  And the chips took surprisingly long to melt.  But it set up well and is very, very good, unlike some cloyingly sweet pumpkin fudges.  I did use pumpkin pie spice in lieu of cinnamon.

I have made this fudge a dozen times and, if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. The only time it didn't turn out is when I tried to refrigerate it before it was cooled and set. It will turn out like carmel if you try to get it to set in the fridge. I agree with other reviews that it takes longer than the directions to reach the soft ball temp. You do have to stir constantly to keep it from scorching. Everytime I have made it, people devoured it!

This recipe was great.  Yes, a little less creamy than some traditional chocolate or peanut butter fudges -- but it's such a unique flavor that it doesn't much matter.  For those whose fudge came out too gooey, I'd suggest using a candy thermometer. Rather than just boiling for 18 minutes, I used the thermometer to make sure the mixture reached about 235 degree F (for fudge consistency).  It came out great, but it took much longer than 18 minutes.  I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg & 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to enhance the pumkininess. I am giving the fudge as gifts and will definitely make it again (and again and again).

This recipe was a disaster! It came out more like pumpkin caramels than any fudge I've ever eaten before.

I couldn't even get it out of the pan. I had scoop it out with a spoon.

I followed the directions exactly as written.

Nowhere in the recipe did it ever say to cook to a certain temperature!  After reading other reviews, I now realize the ones that turned out used a thermometer and cooked it to a certain temperature.  Mine didn't set up either--it was like a pudding!  I agree that this is a very expensive recipe to have to throw away!  Please change the recipe accordingly.

DO NOT wait until the end to add the vanilla!!! I think that's why people are having trouble with this recipe. Add it in the beginning with the milk and sugar and it should be alright.

When making candy like fudge, the boiling time is less important than the temperature achieved during the boiling.  This recipe should be edited to tell cooks that the temperature needs to reach 230F, also known as the soft ball stage in candymaking.  Depending on altitude, this will be in 18-25 minutes.  I consider this a major shortcoming in this recipe and downgraded accordingly.  Frankly, since all posted recipes are juried, I would have expected the editors to catch this error and correct it.  Without this direction, many cooks will end up wasting a whole pan of expensive ingredients.

This is a really great recipe!  The only thing I really changed was the chips--I used butterscotch instead of white chocolate.  Great recipe and so much easier than others I've made.

What a wonderful recipe!! Made exactly as described and it turned out perfectly both times. First time I added nuts to the top but many of them fell off, so this time I put them in the bottom of the pan, along with a dusting of kosher salt (I like salty and sweet!). Everyone who tries this fudge goes crazy for it! Thanks for the recipe!!

I give it 5 stars because the recipe worked perfect, I didnt use foil, just lightly buttered a glass dish. I however didnt like the fudge all that much, but I am a fan of peanut butter fudge, and wanted to try something new. everyone else loved it! for those wondering, the tiny cans of condensed milk are exactly 2/3 cup, that way you arnt guessing at the store.

awesome dessert with coffee!  i followed the recipe exactly, used a candy thermometer, added pumpkin spice and more cinnamon, its like a melty explosion of creamy pumpkin goodness!  POINTS OF NOTE : foil not necessary i used a non-stick pan and a light coating of spray no problem, the initial mixture boils down so don't be concerned you are making too much after adding the mellows, candy thermometer reached right temperature exactly at 18 mins on full boil so i'd say thermometer not necessary, i hesitated it was cooking too hot but it turned out perfect, choc chips took forever to melt so i finally just gave up and let some of the chips stay chunked but tastes just fine

Way too sweet for my taste.  I usually make PB or Chocolate fudge, and they are rich, but definitely not this sweet.  The flavor past the sugar was good.  Will try again, just maybe use 1/2 cup less sugar.

OMG, great! First time making fudge and it was phenomenal! I didn't use a candy thermometer but just followed the instructions (boiled for 18 min) and it turned out wonderfully. I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon but otherwise followed the instructions to the letter. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe last night for a work event. I normally make chocolate and peanut butter fudge, so I wasn't afraid to give it a try. It's definitely not the same consistency of my normal fudge. It's not as creamy. But it wasn't dry and it wasn't grainy. The white chocolate has a strong flavor in the fudge. You actually don't taste the pumpkin until after you swallow it.  I used pumpkin pie spice. I think next time I might add a 1/4 tsp of ginger to kick it up a notch.  I followed the directions exactly. I didn't need a candy thermometer. I might use one next time to see how hot it gets at 18 minutes, b/c maybe if I would have taken it off a few minutes earlier it would have been creamier.  I placed the foil in my pan. Filled the pan. Let it sit on my counter for about 30 -45 minutes. I then placed the pan in the fridge overnight. I do this with all my fudge when it is setting. This morning it was ready to go and came right out of the foil using a gentle hand. It cut nicely.  Just follow the directs exactly and you'll be fine making this.

Tasted excellent. I had to use marshmallow fluff instead of marshmallow creme because I couldn't find any and it still came out just fine. I was in a rush that morning so I put the fudge on aluminum foil (it's not TIN foil, people) inside a 9x12 bake pan and put the whole thing in the fridge while still hot. Came back hours later and it removed from the pan and foil just fine. The foil stuck a little, but nothing I couldn't handle. I cut the fudge with a large knife right on the foil and removed it in chunks, maybe that's why it was so easy? I would definitely make this again.

I like this recipe. Thank you all for the tips you have given. The candy thermometer is a definite must if you have never made any type of candy before. It will give you confidence that you are doing it right. Mine had to cook for a little over 20 minutes to reach the right consistency. I lined a 7x7 pan with foil and gave it a light coat of cooking spray and it worked like a charm. Some people said to add extra white choc chips, but I say it makes it too sweet...stick with 1 cup. Also, I love the suggestion of 1/2 tspn cinnamon and 1/2 tspn pumpkin pie spice, it gave it perfect flavor.

I'm not huge pumpkin fan but made this for my kids.  It is wonderful.  It literally melts in your mouth.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  I've never made fudge without a thermometer so I checked and it was registering 234 degrees at 17 minutes.  I cooked for 18 and it set up wonderfully.  Have a piece while still warm.  You won't be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing.

I wish I had read ALL the reviews before I made this recipe.  It sounded very good, but my batch turned out to be a thick goo that was impossible to separate from the foil.  I tried putting it in the refrigerator overnight, but that only made it thicker, but not fudge.  I finally got it out of the pan and into a well buttered bowl, and now I don't know what to do with it.  I'm going to search for recipes that call for caramel and see if I can save this mess,

Sorry, but I too had problems with this one.  I specifically followed the recipe directions and used a candy thermometer (at the advice of others) just to make sure the temperature was right.  However, after cooling it had almost a "taffy" consistency that stuck to the foil, and I was not impressed with the flavor.  Guess I'll just have to keep going to Helen, GA for good pumpkin fudge!!

I've made over 150 batches of fudge in my lifetime because my mom prohibited candy in the house, so I learned to make my own. What I've learned is 1) cook fudge too long, and it becomes like cement  2) cook fudge too little, and you get toffee.  I followed the directions for this recipe, and I used a candy thermometer, a timer, and a cold cup of water to test the cooking time. Drop the mixture into the cold cup of water to test to see if it makes a soft ball.   I panicked, though, when the timer went off at 18 minutes but the thermometer wasn't at soft ball stage yet, so I let it cook another 4 minutes. It was probably fine at 19 minutes because a drop in the cold water made a soft ball.  Make sure to stir every 30 seconds to a minute so it doesn't burn on the bottom.   I've never made fudge that instructed me to put the marshmellow cream in the pan while it was boiling, but I followed the directions, and it was ok.  I also waited a bit before spooning it into the pan because it was still runny.  The result: a good batch of pumpkin flavored fudge!

Okay, first off, I need to say that I'm reviewing this recipe based on the fact that 1- it was my first-ever attempt at fudge, 2- my stove top is of poor quality and heats up very erratically, which makes it hard to judge cooking time, and 3- I got distracted while making it so I think I overcooked it by about 2 minutes. Needless to say it was therefore not as creamy as it could have been, and tasted more like a divinity-fudge kind of confection. I may make it again sometime and thus give it a better review. Still, it was good and looked pretty enough (I cut it into small diamonds and presented it in a glass jar) that I served it on Thanksgiving day as a little treat. It was easy to cut and I had NO PROBLEM removing the foil, even if I had not used the heavy-duty kind. Do make sure to have all ingredients pre-measured and set out at the ready before you start cooking as it starts to boil pretty fast. I did mess up with the cooking time, but it needn't be this way for you. The kids liked it, while I enjoyed the spicy pumpkin flavor, but it was slightly too sweet for me (well, I guess fudge IS sweet). My guests didn't mention it, so I don't think they loved it that much. Someone said it was "different but good" (another way of saying, in short, "this one bite was alright, but I'm not going to be begging for more" LOL). Would probably try again, though.

I over bought pumpkin puree and was looking for creative ways to use it up.  This recipie was such a hit.  I will become one of my staples for the holidays much like my pumpkin roll.  I did use a candy thermometer and cooked to soft ball stage..... just perfect

Needs more pumpkin flavor and spice. This is the first fudge I've made on the stove top. I had to keep it at a rolling boil for 18 minutes and it set up just fine. I added the marshmallow at the end with the chocolate, and it all melted together without problem. The 3 stars came from lack of pumpkin flavor. It also needed more spice in it.

Perfect pumpkin fudge! I used pureed fresh pumpkin instead of canned, and added pumpkin pie spice-- a very easy to follow recipe with a great result.

I think the original creator of the recipe needs to update it. I made the fudge (and have followed plenty of other fudge recipes before, without fail) and ended up with pumpkin caramel. I followed the directions to a T: 18 minutes and all. I let it sit out over night, and when I checked it in the morning, it was still soft. Popped it in the refrigerator for another 12 hours and it's still caramel-y. I didn't bother reading the reviews beforehand...which I will now do each time I use a recipe from this site. What a waste of money, time, and ingredients.

This is a terrific recipe! I'm far from an expert fudge maker, but I had no trouble making this. I read some of the other reviews and I can't figure out why anyone would have a problem with this fudge setting-mine set almost immediately after being poured into the pan. Follow the directions EXACTLY and you'll have no problems. I have a candy thermometer but I trusted the recipe and it was perfect. I used the whole bag of white chocolate chips as some others suggested and for my taste, it took away from the pumpkin flavor. Definately follow the ingredients and directions just the way it is and you'll love it!

I followed the recipe exactly and felt like it tasted too much like the marshmallow creme.  One friend said she didn't think it was worth the calories and I agree.  Others ate it but didn't think it had enough pumpkin.

Excellent fudge!  I used fresh pureed pumpkin, instead of canned.  I also added some very finely chopped walnuts.  I did use a candy thermometer and followed all the directions in the recipe.  It hit soft ball state with :10 left on my timer.  Adding this one to my recipe box!

This turned out great for my first time making any type of fudge.  I used already spiced pie filling and omitted the cinnamon and crushed pecans and walnuts on the base before pouring it in.  Delicious!

Wonderfully easy to make.  I had no trouble at all.  I added a layer of chopped walnuts on top and pressed them into the warm fudge.

Delicious!!!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and my fudge came out perfect.  I cooled my fudge before all the white chocolate chips melted so I had some chunks here and there.  YUM!  I will be making this again.  :)

Followed other reviewers advice and used a full bag of chips, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and no foil, just Pam spray on the pan - it is delicious! No problems at all. It was my first time for fudge altogether and I found it a tasty and great experience!

So I had tried the quick and easy pumpkin fudge which was WAY too sugary! Then I decided to try this one even though it had more ingredients and directions, but I have to say it was well worth it! This was only my second try at fudge, and I was really impressed with how it turned and it was a hit at my work place! I do think I would love to experiment a lil with the recipe though, maybe add some pumpkin spice to it just for a lil more pumpkin flavor although I loved this recipe... and possibly more chips for extra creaminess (which I see several other reviews has suggested!) 

But it really was fool proof, although I didnt have to cook it the entire 18 mintues, which I did use a candy thermometer, so I knew when it was ready to be removed...

Really good! The white chocolate chips won't melt of you kill the heat too fast. Maybe melt them partially in the microwave first. It hardens FAST, so get it in the pan!

AWESOME!!!  This recipe turned out so well.  Like someone mentioned in the comments I used a whole bag of the white chocolate chips and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and the rest of the recipe was followed exactly.  It turned out WONDERFULLY!  Not to sweet like alot of fudges and the perfect texture.  This will be a new recipe I will use during the holidays from now on.  Thank you so much!

I didn't have a single problem with this recipe! I read the reviews, and I will say that I was somewhat nervous to make it. However, it set up perfectly and when I tested it on my 6 year old son he said that it was great. Not knowing the type of fudge, he guessed that it was pumpkin and even asked me if there was cinnamon in it! Out of the mouths of babes!! I would agree that a dash of pumpkin spice would add a litlle more pumpkin flavor. Overall, I was very pleased!

I, like so many others followed the recipe exactly and wound up with a mushy, sticky, paste-like substance. It was a shame because the taste was really good. If yours ends up this way you can re-heat it to make it a bit more fluid and put it on ice cream.

I found the key to making good fudge is cook it slow, over medium heat, use a candy thermometer and be patient.  Follow the directions too!  
You can't rush making fudge or it will not turn out.  I used this recipe with a combination of another recipe on this site and my pumpkin fudge has been perfect each time.

This fudge is very yummy and makes a great holiday gift. After pouring the fudge into the foil-lined pan, I allowed it to set up for about five minutes, then placed pecan halves in rows, one to top each square. Made a beautiful presentation. Once cool, I cut the squares with a pizza cutter-- came out perfectly. Very easy that way. I didn't have any problem getting mine to set up and the end result was a creamy fudge. I did add more spices than just the cinammon (nutmeg, cloves, and ginger). Hope this is helpful! Good luck!

Gave it 5 stars because of ease and speed of preparation. I made this twice in as many days. First I used some reviewer tips (cooked to 240F before adding chips), but it didn't satisfy my taste panel (family)--too hard and barely any pumpkin taste (too much spice and sugar taste). Second time I followed basic cooking instructions (only 18 minutes w/out thermometer) but used 1 cup of pumpkin and omitted vanilla. Got more orange color, texture was smoother and it tasted more like pumpkin. The white chocolate chips already have vanilla flavor, so you don't need to add any extra vanilla flavoring.

This fudge is like taking a mini bite of pumpkin pie!  I did what others recommended and cut back on the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of ginger.  This was the first time I tried it and it turned out perfectly by following the directions exactly.

I just made this recipe today and it turned out wonderfully.  I love how the pumpkin flavor is front and center--it's the perfect treat as we transition into fall.  This was my absolute first time attempting to make any sort of fudge (or any sort of candy for that matter), but I just followed the directions (without using a thermometer as others have suggested) and it turned out perfectly.  It really is as simple as bringing it to a rolling boil and leaving it there for 18 minutes, stirring occasionally.

After following the recipe exactly, I was stuck with fudge that refused to set. Further research revealed that a major instruction was missing- the use of a candy thermometer to get the mixture to the correct temperature (237*F) where it would set. Other recipes have this important step.

I am not sure what I did wrong, Im a novice fudge maker. Like other reviewers, I added a whole bag of chocolate chips, my fudge did not spread, in fact it was very crumbly. So was it too many chips or did I do something wrong in the cooking process. Thanks for the help!

The flavor of this fudge is awesome.  The texture is a little soft but I'm blaming that on me (and maybe the Houston weather).  Will try again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm only giving this one star b/c it tastes really good but other than that nothing is right. I made it exactly as written allowing the full 18 minute cook time. First of all it turned out more like caramel or a sticky taffy than fudge. Secondly, It is stuck to the foil used to line the pan. I managed to peel the foil off of a couple of little pieces to try it but cant peel enough to be able to serve it to anyone. Sorry, but I wont be making this again!

I figured this would be a perfect recipe for me to try beings I have never had luck with fudge of any sort.  I read the reviews and figured it must be fool proof after the one snotty review about people needing to just follow the recipe and directions.  Well, to that person-  I followed the recipe exactly  - including the instructions - and my fudge came out more like pumpkin caramel.  I cannot get it off the foil, cannot cut it at all.  It does taste really good if you want to stand at the pan and lick off the knife as you try to cut it.  Not sure went wrong, maybe next time I'll try the candy thermometer like some of the other reviewers suggested.

So good!! I followed the ingredients and directions carefully, and it turned out great! I greased an 8x8 pan (no foil), and had no trouble getting pretty fudge out of it. Also, while I do have a candy thermometer, and was nervous about all the debates in the comments/reviews, I followed the 18 minutes (which by the way, were cooked at more like low/medium low because I was worried about boiling over, as it does puff up, but was still definitely boiling), even though it never quite reached soft ball temp. Added bonus - a good friend with a "why ruin something perfectly good by adding pumpkin" attitude LOVED this, he was shocked, haha.

I have been making all types of fudge for over 20 years, so I thought this one would be good, since we love pumpkin pie.  I have NEVER had a fudge not set up completely, until now.  It did NOT set up at all, even though we followed the recipe exactly.  We boiled for 18 minutes, and my son even mentioned that it looked like caramel, when it was completely finished.  It's gooey, but not fudge.  It's a pumpkin caramel, completely stuck to the foil.  If the taste were spectacular, we might try it again, but it isn't.

The first batch I made I didn't cook long enough and it came out like a caramel. Not being one to waste food, specially something so tastey, I used it as a filling for my cookie tarts. Delicious. The second batch I made turned out perfectly.

First attempt: boiled to 234 degrees, as suggested by reviewer; didn't time it but it took a long time.  I knew as it was boiling that it was going to turn out hard.  Removed from heat and added white choc chips and vanilla; took a long time for chips to melt.  The mixture was too thick; knew it would not turn out, but I like to follow the recipe exactly when I try something new.  End result: very hard and crumbly.  Second attempt: boiled for much less time (didn't time it; just tried to judge from the thickness); removed from heat and added white choc chips; they take forever to melt.  This time the result was much too thin; it did not set up.  I make fudge and sell it at a local market, so I'm very familiar with the process; giving up on this recipe tho.

Amazing!!!  The only thing different that I would do next time is kinda double the recipe.  By this I mean I would use a 12oz can of evaporated milk, 15 oz can pumkin, and 18oz jar of Fluff.  Only because I was left with you cans of stuff that I really couldn't use for anything else, but I was willing to do that to try this recipe. YUM!

This is a wonderful recipe, with a strong pumpkin flavor, without being overly sweet. Very creamy. The only changed I made was to cook the milk and sugar on low until the sugar was well disolved, then I turned it up to med low until it reached a boil. We love pumpkin in my house so I had been eyeballing this recipe for some time. I went out and bought all the ingredients, and then my family went to the local pumpkin farm where they had pumpkin fudge on sale. I bought a piece to see how I should expect mine to turnout because I had never tried it before. I was upset that it was rather grainy and overly sweet. My husband liked it so I went ahead and made this recipe. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! So much better than the stuff at the pumpkin farm.

I'm going tho give this recipe 5 stars because mine didn't turn out right and I'm sure it was my fault. This was my first ever attempt at making fudge....I couldn't find canned pumpkin only pumpkin pie mix but I just so happened to have little pumpkins in the fridge I used as decorations around Halloween...so I used those. My fudge wasn't smooth and creamy.it was more crumbly than anything. The flavor was good and it was very rich. I just didn't get the consistancy I wanted.

I followed the directions exactly and it never set. Regardless of that, it tasted amazing (although it did have a slightly overpowering marshmallow taste). I decided to use the Easy Sugar Cookie recipe from this site with my not-quite-fudge as a filling. Absolutely amazing!

This was very good, however I wish there was more of a pumpkin taste. I took this to a breakfast for a group of people and did receive alot of compliments. Very sweet but soooo good is something I heard alot.  Some people said you could really taste the pumpkin but I would have liked it to be a bit stronger.  Stirring this occasionally for the 18 minutes did seem like FOREVER but I think it was worth it. Overall this was really good but gave it four stars because I would have liked more of the taste of pumpkin.  Maybe next time I will add a bit more pumpkin and see how it works/tastes.

I went exactly by the recipe and it turned out perfect.18 minutes was perfect also. I will say that I think you could cut back on the amount of sugar and it would come out fine. 1 thing I recommend is DO NOT walk away during the 18 minutes, stay with it and continue to stir the whole time. Also when it says rolling boil, you do not have to have a hard,fast, rolling boil, just a slow steady rolling boil will do. If you have a hard boil it will splatter all over you and turn to caramel fast.Other than these recommendations I think it is a great little recipe and can't wait to let everyone try it and see what they think.

this was VERY good fudge. i had no problem with the way it set and it was a big hit when i took the extras to work.  my reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that it was a bit too sweet. the marshmallow flavor was very strong (which is good if you like marshmallows and i do)   i think next time i will do more like 4oz of the creme.   i doubled the cinnamon like some reviews suggested and am glad that i did.  i plan to remake it for thanksgiving and add pumpkin pie spices to make it a bit more festive.  i would definitely recommend this recipe.

OH MY GOD!  Pumpkin Fudge bliss!!!  This recipe was phenomenal!  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I just followed the recipe and went by feel.  I didn't have any of the set up problems described so often. I boiled on each of the steps as directed and then did 20 minutes instead of 18.  I left the heat mostly on medium the whole time (a slight adjustment when the bubbles got too big), when it was almost done there seemed to be a little bit of a skin on the top (not much, but the beginnings).  I used parchment paper as one reviewer suggested...worked like a dream.  I also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, & 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I added about 3/4 cup of chopped pecans when I added the chips and then topped with larger pecans.  I think they make ALL the difference, they are SO good!  Also, I would suggest having all of your ingredients pre-measured and ready to put in the pot, the boiling steps go very quickly!

My 10 yr old daughter made this and followed the directions to the letter and it turned out fabulous.  18 min boiling is perfect.  The only change we made was adding finely chopped pecans.  I took it to work and everyone loved it.  Like my co-workers, we had never heard of pumpkin fudge so it was a nice change to the normal treats that people bring.   We plan to make again with variations (ie: using pumpkin spice and fat free milk).  Overall a great recipe!

This recipe tasted great (I was sampling as I stirred) up until I added the white chocolate chips.  Now the pumpkin flavour is gone and all I can taste is the white chocolate.  So disappointing.

WONDERFUL!  Very creamy and perfect consistency!  I didn't use a candy thermometer, but it couldn't be any better!  I sprayed heavy-duty aluminum foil with Pam, and it just peeled right off; sliced perfectly and tasted FANTASTIC!

First let me say this was my first attempt at making fudge. So easy. My family and co-workers absolutely loved this fudge. I followed the directions exactly, and it was perfect. The fudge is almost starting to solidify when I was pouring it into the dish, so keep in mind, when you pour what it is looking like "visually" on top, cause it is hard to even it out once it starts getting solid. Very yummy and creamy fudge. Rich as fudge should be and it is nice having the orange color and uniqueness for Fall.  A++++ recipe and I will make again!

My grandmother (fudge master)and I made this recipe and one for peanut butter fudge. The other fudge came out great... this one came out more like taffy. I'm not sure what the problem is. It tastes great, the constistency is struggling. I'm trying to figure out what to do with it now.

I made this and used my students as my test kitchen; they are now calling this fidge "pumpkin crack" because it was so addictive! I thought it was a bit too tough and crumbly so I will probably add about twice the amount of pumpkin next time. Also, I skipped the aluminum foil step and just greased the pan and it worked quite well.

The vanilla chips overpowered the fudge.  Even if they didn't, this is more of a pumpkin cream taste instead of pumpkin pie.

It was very good! I substituted milk for white chocolate. My husband and sister loved it. It takes a long time to get the temperature above 220 F, but don't give up!

Made recipe as written.  Absolutely love the flavor! Love that it is not too sweet. Set up beautifully. Used parchment paper for lining so sticking was not a problem. I will definitely make again.

I was about to give this a really poor rating.  I made this exactly as written.  After 4 hours chilling, it was a large sticky mess, with the (heavy good quality) foil stuck to it.  I planned to serve this at a party, so painstakingly removed the foil, piece by piece.  I was able to cut it somewhat, but my friends and I laughed about it and called it "pumpkin poi" because you had to scoop the gooey caramel-like substance and eat it with your fingers. The next morning, inexplicably, the leftover poi had turned to fudge.  You could cut it and pick it up and it was lovely.  Important advice:  make this one day ahead of time!

This was great. So easy and great taste. My kids were asking me to make more as soon as it was gone. I did use a pumpkin cookie cutter and they came out super cute.

Made it twice, very easy, had only made fudge once before.  Extremely delicious and everyone loved it. 
I followed the recipe carefully but also : 
Sprayed foil with pam
Used 1/2 t cinnamon and a couple dashes each ginger, cloves and nutmeg
Increased white chips by 1/4 c to total 1-1/4 cup
After chips melt, beat fudge hard as long as I could (about ten seconds, hah!) before pouring into pan
Really helps to have everything measured and ready before starting.

Very rich but with a nice pumpkin flavor. I did the 1/2 pumpkin pie spice 1/2 cinnamon alter which turned out good. Like others say its not creamy and mine was kind of hard- not like a soft chocolate fudge- but was still very good in small quantities due to the richness.

I want to start by saying that I make dozens of batches of fudge every fall, so I'm no newcomer to the fudge scene.  This fudge has a wonderful flavor, but I found that I had to boil the mixture for longer than the 18 minutes the directions call for.  My first batch didn't set up, so the second one I used a candy thermometer for and let it get to the softball stage (THE fudge stage) before pulling it off the heat.  I think the 18 minutes probably worked for the specific stove the original author used, but probably the time will be different depending on the stove being used.  I recommend using the candy thermometer and boiling it to the softball stage.  Otherwise, wonderful recipe--very flavorful.

It's different that's for sure but it is creamy and delish! Just follow the directions and you won't have any problems with it coming out perfect.

Went to a lot of work to fix this - and it never hardened.  Thought I'd serve it for an after dinner treat for Thanksgiving tomorrow - will use another recipe for fudge.  The chips never melted either - Ghirardelli white chips.

I tried twice, following it to a T cooking for 18 minutes after adding the pumpkin and it turns into a brick! I am so depressed this is the third pumpkin fudge recipe I tried and I promised to make it for my boyfriend to send in a care package as we are long distance. But I am giving up hope on pumpkin fudge it's just not gonna work.

Not sure what happened but I tried this fudge twice and couldn't get it to set up. Was a yummy gooey mess we ate in bowls with a spoon. The first time I followed the directions exactly, cooking for 18 mins. Second time used a candy thermometer and boiled until soft ball stage.

I did use quality ingradients and make fudge enough to know what I'm doing and it has always turned out, until this one.  I've noticed other pumpkin fudge recipes call for shorter boil times, so I'm going to try that next time.  This one is dry and crumbly and as with other posters, when we put in the white chips it became instantly dry and hard and the chips did not even get to melt into it.  Also the taste is okay, but not enough of a pumpkin taste.  Was expecting something creamier and instead it's more like granola.  But my family is still eating it, so it's not all lost.  :)

My mom and I really wanted some pumpkin fudge... my mom is a great fudge maker, BUT this recipe isn't really clean cut. We followed the recipe EXACTLY.... the whole cook time, exact ingredients...etc.   When we removed from heat and added white choc chips and vanilla, it turned to a powdery  consistency. We had to add 1/4 cup water and 1 TBSP butter to get it back to creamy and back on the heat. Not sure what happened. The taste it ok... we added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cloves but overall this recipe was just ok.

I've never made fudge before - tried this even after reading some of the scary reviews. Mine turned out perfect. I do have to say - those whose got like carmel possibly put in the fridge - I made a double batch and put one container in the fridge. It never set - just got like carmel. The batch I let set on the counter top turned out perfect!

Fudge turned out wonderfully. It had a creamy texture not grittty. It had a wonderful flavor as well. I added some pumpkin pie spice and cloves for more flavor. Definitely a keeper for fall recipes.

This didn't turn out right.  I followed the recipe, and it came out really runny, and never set up.  I have made fudge so many times before, and never had this happen...not sure what went wrong.

I made literally pounds of this last year, and will be again this year (just getting online to see what I need to stock up on). Everyone loved it. If you need to make a lot, I wouldn't suggest making more than a double batch at a time, because the chips won't melt enough, and that will keep it from setting. I found that little bits of the chips unmelted was OK, but not much bigger than match heads. (One of my batches never did set, and I traced it to the fact that the chips didn't melt. I did reheat the goo, melt the chips, and got it to set, but the pumpkin scorched.) I also do half cinnamon and half pumpkin pie spice.

I completely forgot the choc chips and vanilla until it was just warm. Luckily the chips did start melting and I got them incorporated ok before the fudge hardened. I ate what was on the spoon and WOW, VERY nice. Will definitely make again and NOT forget the choc chips :)

I think the taate is wonderful, following the recipe as posted. Mine, however, turned out hard :( Very sad about that since it tastes so good! It still crumbles and melts in your mouth. I have ingredients left over so I'll be sure to try again soon! YUM!

I took the suggestions from the other reviews. It turned out perfectly! I did use a candy thermometer, but it did not hit the correct temp. after 18 minutes, so I trusted the recipe and it worked! Follow the recipe instructions and you will not go wrong! Also, I did use pumpkin pie spice and used 12 oz. bag of chips. I will be making this all season long!

I can't believe I'm just now commenting on this wonderful recipe! I made it three times last fall, once just as a trial, and two other times for cast parties. Everyone loves it and I've given the recipe out to so many people. My only suggestion is that if the 1 tsp of cinnamon is over-powering, try 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 pumpkin pie spice which worked well for me. And don't let the cooking time scare you, I watched the candy thermometer like a hawk the first time because 18 min seemed so long but it was perfect! I definitely want little fall cookie cutters for them this year!

This was good, but VERY sweet. Almost too sweet. I couldn't eat very much of it at once, but that is kind of the point of fudge right?

I'd give it 10 stars!  This is the tastiest fudge ever!  I did mess up by not cooking it long enough, I didn't have a thermometer so I ended up with pumpkin caramel... that didn't stop us from eating it all with a spoon though.  Second time came out perfectly as I bought myself a candy thermometer... this is a keeper!

Had some leftover pumpkin from another recipe and wanted to use it up. Came across this recipe and thought it would be perfect since I was starting my holiday baking. I found it to be very easy to make. The flavor was very good and the kids loved it! I used the white chocolate chips, but for some reason they didn't melt completely. Next time I think I will chop them with my food chopper then add them. But overall a great tasting fudge!

Delicious!! Everyone loved it. And it came out perfect. I did ruin my 2nd batch by not letting it cook long enough, but every other time it came out great! I used the whole bag of chocolate chips and added pecans to one batch. Thanks for sharing!!

Eightteen minutes is way too long to cook this.  The mixture was too thick to be able to mix in the remaining ingredients, and smelled burnt.

Love it!  I used heavy-duty foil, buttered so that it wouldn't stick.  And being that I had never made fudge, I borrowed a candy thermometer so that I could make sure it reached the "soft ball" stage.  I used 1/2 t. of cinnamon and 1/2 t. of pumpkin pie spice.  It is VERY sweet, but I guess that's how fudge is!  A tiny square is very satisfying!!!!

I had the opposite problem from many of the reviewers - mine was as hard as a rock.  I used a candy thermometer and boiled it to soft ball stage (235 degrees), which took 28 minutes instead of 18.  So I can't give the recipe 1 star because if I had followed the recipe exactly instead of reviewers' suggestions, it might have turned out better.  As it is though, it's inedible.

The first time i made this fudge, i didnt read the recipe clearly. instead of adding 3\4 cup of pumpkin i added the whole can, and in doing so i ended up having to add the whole can of evaporated milk. This was a disaster, the fudge was spitting all over and burned my cheek and arms. Still i poured it into the pan and let it cool. it sat in my fridge for three days before i ended up throwing it out, it was too sticky, But it tasted great. So today i re-made this fudge and followed all directions to the dot. IT TASTES GREAT! my family loves it and i know that i will definately be making this again soon. :)

This unique fudge recipe gets five stars and two thumbs up! It was not difficult to make, no modifications were needed and although I plan on going for a long run after I finish typing this review due to the ridiculous amount of calories in the confection, the taste and texture were absolutely spot on! If you follow the directions exactly, stirring about once every minute, this fudge is no fail delicious!

I tried this recipe 4 times and it only came out once.  That's the difficulty with fudge, it won't always turn out due to the weather and temperature you cook the fudge to.  With that said I won't make this again due to the fact that it tastes like white chocolate more than pumpkin.  I was looking for a pumpkin fudge that tasted like pumpkin!!  Plus it was gritty every time I made it even when it did set up.  Hope everyone else has a better time with it!

I love this! It's delicious and doable. I will probably use this one every year now.

Stirring for 18 minutes is not my favorite thing, but the result is really yummy.

The only adjustment I made was to add a 1/4 tsp each of clove and nutmeg.

I first made this a few days ago following the recipe. It turned out awfully ! Would not set up and was just goopy. I tried it again today using suggestions I read here. I boiled the milk, sugar, pumpkin together. Then added a full bag of white chips, marshmalow creme,vanila and spices. I added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 half teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. It turned out well this time, although it still doesn't have much pumpkin taste. Maybe a bit more spice next time will help.

I was one of the unlucky ones.  My fudge was more like and icing until I put it in the refrigerator.  I did get firm enough to pick up but was still too soft.  It tasted good.

This does not have the same texture as regular chocolate or white chocolate fudge but is is really good.  I followed the directions but I did use a candy thermometer because I'm a chicken.  I reached 238 around 15 minutes of boiling for me. However I think another three minutes would have been ok too.  If your looking for something different and tasty try this.  Oh also I used 7oz of mini marshmallows because I didn't have any cream and I used a whole bag of chips like others had suggested. Tres Bien!

OMG I love this fudge!!  I made 2 batches.  The first one I put in the fridge, but then took it out as soon as I read the reviews saying not to put it in the fridge.  It didn't harden as fast or as well as the second batch did, but it is still amazing.  I'm trying to learn to cook unique things so that when I get married next year, my future children will have some traditions and recipes to look forward to, just like I did with my mother and grandmother.  This recipe is definitely going in that collection!

Wonderful flavor.  Cooked as directed and it came out perfect.  Although I did add 1/2 t ground clove, 1/2 t ground nutmeg, 1/4 t ground ginger and used the entire bag of white chocolate chips.  Will make again next Christmas.

I wish this was more soft and creamy.  It was good but very hard and dry like some previous reviewers mentioned.  It was still good but not the greatest texture for fudge.  I followed the directions exactly.

This recipe was simple and tasty.  I don't know why a lot of others seemed to have a problem with it, mine turned out great!  the only things I did differently was I replaced the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice, and I added a whole bag of white chocolate chips instead of half.  Everyone loved it.  The day affter I made it, I came home from work and half of it was gone!  I am turning this one in for my recipe swap this month.

I also don't know why so many people had a problem with this recipe---it set up like a dream--1st try.  And not to add insult to injury, but I'm not particularly great at confection cooking--so I really don't know what the problem was for others.  I didn't even use a candy thermometer--just the 18 min directions at a rolling boil.  Worked great.  I added a little clove too.  Only thing I'll say is that this fudge is SSSWEEEEEEETTTTT!!!!!  I might try reducing the sugar amount a bit next time, and maybe a pat more butter or a little heavy cream.  But it was very good as is, and was very popular at work.  Perfect accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee!

Before I attempted to make this recipe I read over all the reviews so it would come out right the first time.  I followed the recipe exactly how it was written with 2 exceptions: instead of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon I used 1 & 1/2 tsps pumpkin pie spice + 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and I used a candy thermometer to ensure it was right at the soft ball stage (about 20 minutes).
The fudge firmed up in the pan within minutes and so far my boyfriend and my coworkers have enjoyed this great recipe!

This turned out great.  My kids loved it.  I was trying to duplicate some pumpkin fudge I had at a local gourmet store.  This fudge was really good but not quite as good as the store's.  I had no problem cooking it and having it set up but it reached the soft ball stage (using the method of dropping a small amount in a bowl of cold water to test) and was ready in about 10 minutes instead of 18.  I guess it depends on your pan and stovetop.

I've made  fudge since I was a teenager.  I've tried this recipe twice, and used a candy thermometer to measure the heat, and it still hasn't turned out. It has AMAZING flavor, but is very soft and doesn't set up like fudge. I absolutely love the flavoring, so I will keep trying, but this is a mess.  Maybe I need more chocolate. Somewhere along the way I'm making a mistake as a lot of people have had this be very successful. And I wish it had worked for me.

I followed the recipe for all but one ingredient, I used vanilla syrupe instead of vanilla extract, only because I did not have vanilla extract and my fudge came out creamy and tasty but did not hold together very well and I think it's from the syrupe I used.

18 minutes on the stove turned this into a brick.  We laughed when we were trying to cut this up and dig it out.

Thank you to Amandams27 for your review! I was sure to bring my mixture to a boil each time as stated and set my time! My husband said this recipe took him home to the Dominican Republic as it resembles "dulce de leche" but with pumpkin. My only issue was burning my hand with some of the mixture transferring it to my dish. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!

I tried this recipe for the first time and got the gooey stuff some of you were talking about. I went to a website that discussed how to fix fudge. Apparently I didn't get the mixture to the right temp during the rolling boil stage. The website suggested I put the gooey stuff back in the saucepan with a little evaporated milk and get a candy thermometer to a temp of 230 degrees. I immediately saw the difference the second time. Once I reached this temp I added a little powdered sugar, pumpkin spice, and wow! It began to set once I put it in the pan. Skipped the foil and lightly sprayed a pan like you all suggested. I wasnt going to give in because the gooey stuff tasted so good. Hope this helps, great recipe.

If there was a rating higher than five stars I would give it.  Amazing!!! I do like to substitute pumpkin pie spice for half the cinnamon but that's just personal preference.  I could eat the whole pan myself.

Fantastic flavors, just started trying to make fudge and had some success and some horrible failures.  This recipe is foolproof and easy to make if you stick to the directions.  Everything went according to the directions and fudge set perfect.  Great pumpkin taste and texture.  Will try adding some pumpkin pie spice or nutmeg next time for a little more complexity in the flavoring.

I followed this recipe exactly step by step, exact measurements, exact times etc. despite my better judgement because it seemed like an awful long time to cook sugar products, and sure enough it was. I'd suggest people use their judgement on the cooking times, not the recipes times.  It isn't always user error like some would like to claim just because theirs came out fine.  Some stoves may burn hotter than others and different brands of the ingredients could make a difference.

The flavor of this fudge was excellent, but it was the texture that I didn't care for. The cook time was entirely too long. As soon as I poured the fudge into the pan, it began to set, and it set so hard that when I'd cut into it, pieces would crumble. Eighteen minutes of a rolling boil is excessive and brings the temperature up way higher than 234, where it should be. I would be willing to try this recipe again with cooking adjustments.

Very good, not so sugar sweet like most fudge. Used super chunky peanut butter because I prefer nuts in my fudge. Also added a tsp of almond extract and drizzled melted chocolate on top. Delicious!!!!!

I followed the recipe to the T, even used a candy thermometer as the print version in the magazine suggested. I ended up with something between soft-ball taffy and fudge. Too sticky to roll into taffy and wrap in waxed paper or parchment, after being cut, it re-melts back into a blobby mess. I'm going to try heating it enough to reuse it on some "turtle bars."

Mine came out soft and stuck to the tin foil and these ingredients are not cheap! It should have been specific on temperature and what to do, it makes fudge loom too simple when there are so e intricate steps.

My whole family liked this fudge. My 2 year old keeps asking me to make her some more. It was gone within a few days with 4 of us eating on it. I think I'll make it for Christmas as well. It has that creamy pumpkin flavor that you get with some pumpkin pies. It's a great alternative to chocolate. I made this following the directions exactly as written, and it turned out wonderful! I had no trouble with the fudge sticking to the foil or being too sticky. I will definitely make this again & again...&again.

First time making fudge ever and this turned out great! My fudge boiled well before the soft ball stage on my thermometer (boiled at around 225) so I went with the instructions. I found this to be almost painfully sweet, but I don't normally eat fudge. The pumpkin flavor is awesome, and I might add more cinnamon next time. It helped to have everything measured out and ready to pour. Next time I will stir everything before even adding to the pot, or use a whisk. It also took longer than expected to get the white chocolate to melt. I sprayed the foil and the fudge came out easily. Overall a great recipe for a first attempt at a new method.

I made 6 batches of this recipe yesterday for Holiday gifts.  I DID have trouble with the first batch because the following is not clear.  "Bring to a rooling boil. Cook....".  I didn't know what was meant by 'cook'.  After reading all the reviews again, I tried again with success.  After it came to a rolling boil, I turned the heat down to low and let it sit and bubble for 18 mintues.  Then it turned out perfect.  I also found it easier to use a wisk to incorporate the new ingredients to the pan.  I used the wooden spoon to stir it during the 18 minutes of cooking time.  I didn't change any of the ingredients and it turned our smooth and delicous.  The only thing I might do next time is drizzle some white chocolate over the top just to make it look pretty.  The color of the fudge is not a 'pumpkin' color.

I loved this recipe! I did not use a candy thermometer, just followed the directions. The only change I made was that rather than lining my pan with foil, I used "pan lining paper." That's the stuff with foil on one side & parchment paper on the other.

This is soo good!  I love pumpkin everything, and I could eat this all alone!  Better than pumpkin pie!  I will definitely be making another batch because everyone wanted the first one. My kids ate it, and they don't eat anything when I say its pumpkin. I did use the foil, it made cutting much easier. Very impressed, thank you so much for sharing this! For those who are having trouble with this recipe, it may help to make sure you have everything measured and ready ahead of time, it boiled much quicker than I thought it would so be ready with the other ingredients. Definitely worth another try!

I just made 2 batches of this. The first batch did not turn out so well. Too thin. For the second batch I boiled a little more aggressively and stirred a little less frequently, and it looks amazing!

YUM!  I made this fudge for the first time this week, and it is SO GOOD!  I did use pumpkin pie spice instead of just the cinnamon, and it turned out beautifully.  I spray my foil with a bit of Pam, and the fudge came right off.

YUMMY. I made two pans of this for my wedding reception. The first pan I didn't let cook for 18 minutes. It turned out fluffier than the second pan but still set up fine. I got many compliments and it was EASY.

When I read this recipe I thought well why not!  It was either going to be really gross or to die for.  I am happy to report that this pumpkin fudge is to die for!  Literally everyone that tries it raves about it.

After reading all the reviews, I chose to make this using the directions for Easy Fantasy Fudge (from the marshmallow creme jar).  Basically, the change involved adding the pumpkin and spices, boiling to 234 degrees, then stirring in the marshmallow creme and white chocolate chips.  Sadly, this tastes mostly of white chocolate, which I am NOT a fan of.  Hubby liked it, though.  If you want to have it come easily out of your pan, use the release-type foil.  It's a little expensive, but WAY better than picking bits of foil out of your candy.

Don't double batch this! Both times I doubled this recipe it came out like pumpkin caramel: Delicious, but not very presentable. ;) If you follow this recipe exactly(that means using a wooden spoon as well)it should turn out great!

I love this recipe!  Made just a couple of changes to the recipe, substituted marshmellow fluff for the marshmellow cream and in addition to the 2 tsp of cinnamon, I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Cooked it for the 18 minutes as stated without the thermometer and it came out perfect!!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Recipe needs to be revised to indicate the temperature the fudge mixture should reach before it's taken off the stove at the last step. Cook times should *always* be an approximation, to account for stove differences, despite what the other reviewers say that "if it doesn't set up it's your own fault". Mine never set up, but without a thermometer reading to rely on I had to trust that 18 minutes was enough. So now I have a pan of fudge I can't cut to give anybody, and am hoping it will work as a fudge ripple sauce in ice cream.

Any reason people aren't using a light coat of Pam just to be on the safe side? After reading many reviews I decided to lightly spray half of the pan as an expiriment.... The fudge didn't stick to either sprayed or non sprayed foil so I don't see why people be freaking out... Also 2 recipe variations... I couldn't get my hands on any regular fluff, all I could find was "Ricemellow", made from brown rice syrup and it worked just like regular fluff (Wholefoods is the closest store to me and they aren't allowed to carry the regular stuff) and I used all 12 oz of white chocolate which was stupid of me since I don't like white chocolate... Texture was unaffected but its a little too white chocolate-y for me...

Easy recipe, but mine came out a bit too chewy/mushy so I must not have boiled it long enough.  Was really, really sweet...  I also added a few spices.  See details and photos at valsway.blogpot.com
Overall, easy, tasty recipe :)

This turned out perfect. As some of the more recent reviews stated, if it is gooey, you didn't cook it long enough. I did not use a thermometer and had no problems. The only change I made was using pumpkin spice instead of plain cinnamon.

I agree, if this didn't work for you it's not the recipes fault. I bake a lot but have never made fudge. This was SUPER EASY. all it takes is the patience to stir occassionally and test your mixture often. No thermometer used -just cold water and my own judgement. I cut the cinnamon in half, added 1/4 tsp (or so -I just eyeballed the measurment) of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground ginger.
It was devoured at work before lunchtime hit and the people who missed out (I didn't have 2 or 3 pieces per person as wound up happening) are disappointed so I'm dipping into the ones I kept for myself so they can try it... 4 stars because I thought it would be even better than it was...

Delicious and easy recipe. I really like the texture of the cookies. They come out moist and soft, and 20 minutes was the perfect amount of time. I also like the fact that they are not too sweet. Drizzle just a bit of the icing on top for a slightly sweeter cookie, or dip the top of the cookie in the icing for those of you who have a sweet tooth. I added 1 cup of walnuts to the batter before baking. Yum!!

Easy, easy, easy. Followed directions all the way through and it turned out just right. Excellent fall treat. I misted my Reynolds foil with spray butter then wiped it off with a paper towel, just in case...worked perfect.

If I can make this recipe...anyone can.
It is terrific..
I used parchment paper that has foil on one side, didn't stick at all. When using the little candy cutters I sprayed them with Pam, and it worked t great. Followed the directions exactly..perfect!

It tastes good! BUT mine also became a pan of sticky goo...I accidently poured to much evaporated milk into it, which could be why, but others have had the same problem. It was my first time making any kind of fudge ever so I do believe it was something I did wrong. But it does tastes good....wish i could figure out why it didn't set

This was really yummy. I added nutmeg and cloves and an extra dollop of pumpkin ( i used a large can for a few recipes and didn't want to waste any pumpkin) the extra pumpkin made me need extra time for the fudge to set, about a day and a half. i might try making some of this fudge into balls and coating with white or dark chocolate for an extra decadent treat!

The flavor is nice but mine came out a little hard, like a bar of candy that's been in the fridge.  Not soft and melt in your mouth kind of fudge.  Not sure if that was the result I was supposed to get or not.  But still a good flavor.

This was very good and easy to make.  My only complaint is that I taste more sugar than pumpkin, so I think next time I will up the canned pumpkin to 1 cup and add a little pumpkin seasoning.

From what the other reviewers are saying, guess I didn't cook long enough. I did exactly what the recipe said, it's been in the fridge for 12 hours now and it still hasn't set up. I will most definitely use it for something, since it's consistency is like caramel.

I need more info I think.  Having never made fudge before I didn't know what temp to cook at.  It said a rolling boil so I had it on med-high to high and after about 14 minutes my entire house was filled with smoke and I had a black mess in the pan that was like a burnt pumpkin sucker or something.  I still can't get my pan clean.  I'm guessing my temp was too high, but I am too scared to make this again without some better directions.  I've read many of the reviews and maybe if I get a candy thermometer I could try, but since my problem was the opposite of most I don't know what to do.  Glad I only made half a batch at least.  Hopefully the smell will leave my home soon.

I bake frequently.  I followed the recipe and my fudge turned out like caramel.  It had an OK flavor but was gooey like caramel.  Hmmmmm  Not sure what happened.

Great recipe, I just followed it to the letter and it came out perfect.  I used wax paper instead of aluminum foil and that worked very well.

This is some GREAT fudge!  It takes like a very creamy pumpkin pie!  I did use the candy thermometer and cooked it until it was "soft ball."  It turned out wonderful!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out good.  Trick is to stir to your lil' heart out.  Used pumpkin spice and cinn.  Good flavor and texture.  Chopped nuts would be divine in it.

Yummmm! This fudge was sooo delicious and tasted just like Christmas! I was a little apprehensive at first, after reading all the reviews (and this was my first time making fudge!) , so I did end up making some alterations to the recipe. First, I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon, and instead of cooking the fudge for 18 minutes, I cooked it for 25 minutes instead because I was worried that it would turn out like, as the other reviewers have said, "caramel". Luckily, the texture was almost perfect after I let it cool for a while, albeit just a little dry (my fault. next time i'll cook it for 20 min instead), but otherwise, smooth and creamy. I also used an entire bag of white chocolate chips. Oh and MAKE SURE TO GREASE THE FOILED PAN. I did, and the fudge didn't stick to the foil at all. Overall, it was a GREAT recipe, and I can't wait to make it again.

I have NO idea what I did wrong. I followed the recipe word for word, minute for minute and it turned out SUPER hard. I literally could not break it apart with a Wustoff knife! I didn't even get a chance to mix in the chocolate chips and vanilla before it hardened. Threw the whole batch away. I was SO looking forward to pumpkin fudge too! :)

I had a little problem with this recipe, it turned into caramel.  Perhaps I did not do something rights over boiled underboiled.  The taste was out it of this world, and there were a lot of things that I could actually use the caramel for.  So it did not go to waste.

The form and color of this was very nice. It has an excellent flavor. Although  I would definitely use less sugar next time. It doesn't seem like it HAS to have that much sugar in it. It made it kind of crunchy with the granules and all. But over all- very nice!

The recipe did not work for me as written.  I also had a gooey mess that would not set up completely.  So the next day I managed to get most of the candy off the foil into a pan and cooked the ingredients to 260 on the candy therm.  Once it reached temp I removed from heat and added another cup of white choc chips,a cup of miniture marshmallows and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Stir until melted and poured into a lightly buttered pan.  I put it in the refrig to cool for 2 hours and then cut into squares.  This saved the candy and everyone enjoyed it.

I also ended up with a sticky goo after following the recipe to a tee. However it was a very good tasting goo. I agree with others that using 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice would make this taste better. From now on when I try this I will cook it for more like 25-30 minutes and probably use 2 cups of white chocolate chips as suggested by others. I will try it again only with these changes. And AMANDAMS27, a recipe can actually be wrong depending on altitude and the weather outside for fudge, so although it may not be the fault of the recipe maker, the recipe itself really should allow for these differences within the recipe itself...or use a candy thermometer.

My family thought this recipe was very good.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover pumpkin, and came across this one.  I was very pleased with how easy this recipe was.  I didn't use a candy thermometer, but I was careful to follow the directions, especially for timing.  Since it was Thanksgiving Eve and the food stores were packed, I opted to try mini marshmallows because I forgot the jarred kind.  I estimated the same ounces and it worked perfectly.  This fudge is not too sweet and somewhat reminiscent of a maple sugar candy.  Very good--Thanks!

Well I don't think mine turned out the way it was supposed to, but it still tastes good.  I could not find a candy thermometer anywhere in this town, all sold out! So I bought a meat one that went to 220 degrees. I might have cooked it a little long, and I think I added a little to much canned pumpkin, thats why it probably took longer to set up. it feels hard on top, but when you bite in its good, my husband doesnt't like real soft fudge anyhow. So he says its good! oh and I also added pumpkin spice too.

The first time I made this fudge I followed the directions to a "T" and it came out rock hard with little flavor...I decided to try it again, and took the advice from other reviews and this time it was perfect! Here's what I did...

I used an entire bag of white chips along with 2/3 cup of sliced almonds...I also did the 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice instead of 1 tsp cinnamon...I let the sugar and milk come to a boil very slowly and made sure I used a candy thermometer this time...after all the ingredients were in I watched the thermometer like a hawk and as soon as it reached the soft ball stage I removed it from heat (boiled about 13 min) and added the chips, almonds and vanilla extract.

It set up perfectly this time and is sooooo tasty! I really do think it is important to use the candy thermometer ;)

Good luck everyone!

If I make this again - I agree with the reviewer that is the "fudge queen" and will put the marshmallow creme in when I remove it from the heat.  Not an extremely strong pumpkin flavor...so don't be expecting that.

For all you beginner fudge makers like myself I have to strongly encourage a candy thermometer. I tried and failed miserably at this twice before I got a candy thermometer and what a difference! It came out perfectly! The first two times I cooked it way too long and could have used the finished product as a door stopper...

OH wow this recipe is awesome. It is a little bit of work, I followed the directions to a T, only substituting milk choc. chips for the white choc. (all I had on hand), and I had no problem with it setting. I did line my pan with wax paper instead of foil, it came out perfectly, no sticking. THis fudge is melt in your mouth good, oh and I do NOT have a candy thermometer. I simply did a soft ball test every couple of minutes after 14 minutes of boiling. Thanks so much for a definite new addition to my recipe box!

Made this for the boyfriend, who is a pumpkin fiend.  Satisfied his pumpkin craving (as well as the cravings of his 4 other roommates!) without the hassle of baking a pie!  I'll definitely be making this again.  I used heart shaped cookie cutters for cute shapes and ate the scraps myself :-)

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I've never heard of pumpkin fudge before and was a little hesitant to try it, but my whole family loved it. I did add some pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon to make it taste more like pumpkin pie, about 1 tbsp. It was fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very good fudge especially for the Holidays!  I added chopped pecans to make it even more yummy.

The only downfall to this recipe is that there is no mention of a candy thermometer. Anyone who has ever made fudge knows how important it is to get to the right temp. Otherwise it is very tasty!

I am not quite sure why so many people had difficulty trying to get the fudge to set up. I had no problems each time I made it. It really is a hit, and an interesting alternative to traditional chocolate fudge. Personally, I made myself sick on a few pieces. It is really rich!! I don't know if I can eat it for another year or so... but if you like pumpkin, you'll love this recipe!

Very creative recipe.  I made people that hated pumpkin love this fudge.  It's great!  I used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I also used a $4 candy thermometer from Kmart.  I stirred it constantly while watching the thermometer til it reached 235 degrees (soft ball).  It turned out great!!!  I placed the fudge in squares on a pretty plate and took some clear wrapping paper and set the plate on it.  Then I gathered the wrapping paper together over the fudge (like a ponytail) and wrapped a pretty ribbon around the "pony tail" It looked so pretty.  And my co-workers loved eating it too.

I have never done a fudge recipe where you add the marshmallow fluff and then cook it. I have always stirred it in last. I think that is why it is not a creamy as I thought it would be. Kind of makes the whole purpose of adding the fluff pointless. This fudge does have a wonderful rich pumpkin flavor. I found that it needs to be stirred more "frequently" than just "occasionally". Mine reached soft ball stage in 14 minutes. Like other posts, I recommend a candy thermometer.

I am not sure what happened with this, but it did not turn out at all...it was all gooey.  I have never made fudge before, so it was a first for me.  Next time I will read the reviews first before making the recipe!!  However, I will be trying this again, maybe I'll have better luck next time, because the "gooey" confection had great flavor!  :)

It has great flavor. I did a half teaspoon each of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice based on another review. But it did not set up like fudge. It will have to be eaten with a spoon lol. I followed the recipe exact so not sure what happened, Iâve never had a problem with fudge before.

I made it two times. Once doing the apx time to boil and the 2nd with a candy thermometer. Both times the mixture got past the softball stage too fast. It was a waste of money, all organic, and time.

This recipe is great if you like to waste money and throw food away! 18 minutes is way too long and 239 degrees in the editors note is way to high.  First batch followed to a T, turned the whole batch granular, TOSS!  Second batch used accurate candy thermometer to hit 234 degrees.  Did not set fully and was able to repurpose as frosting.  I am a proficient confectioner/candy maker and I also use precision instrumentation as I also make my own soaps and need temperatures to always be just right.  I think this recipe needs a bit of refinement but I have already wasted the time of two failed batches and this review so if I chance happen upon what you have wrong here, I will post with corrections.

I followed the recipe exactly, and NOT only could I NOT get the temp above 200 degrees (I even double checked with a meat thermometer), but it never set up.  It tasted awesome, but what could I have done wrong to have it not (even close) set up?

Followed the recipe exactly but it turned out more like taffy than fudge. The pumpkin spice flavor was ok but mostly, it was just sickeningly sweet. I had to throw it out. Very disappointing.

I could only get the temp up to 210 degrees, so I made sure to stir for 18 minutes exactly and I stirred like a mad man the whole time.  It failed!  As soon as it started cooling it turned hard and crunchy.  I think this needs less heat and less time boiling.  It would have been good to have another indicator to tell when it was done cooking.

I worked really hard on this recipe.  It seemed to take forever to heat, because every time I turned up heat, it wanted to scorch.  There is just such a small amount of liquid vs sugar, it was tricky.  The white chocolate morsels took entirely too long to melt, even after I tried leaving everything in the pan (instead of taking it out as directed) and turning the heat back on the low. Next time I will warm the morsels first.  I was afraid it would end up being "over stirred" but it seems ok.

The flavor is not bad, but just ok.  I used fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned so maybe that had something to do with it.  I used an 8x8 pan and barely had enough to fill it. 
I will try again, because I always have a lot of pumpkin on hand, and maybe mix up the seasoning a bit, possibly using pumpkin pie spice or nutmeg.

Flavor seems to improve as the fudge sets, so we will see.

I just made this and haven't tasted it yet. However, it would have to promise to be the fountain of youth for me to make it again. How can you stir this for 18 minutes, getting it to 239 degrees, without it splattering all over you and burning your skin? There must be a way because everyone else did it. I cook 7 days a week... I'm not new. This was a pain to make. Sorry.

I've made this twice, and it still has yet to set up right. It remains kind of sticky and shiny, more like marshmallow cream than fudge. I swear I followed the recipe exact and it's just not working. any tips?

I  followed the recipe exactly but it did not come out looking like the picture.    it was too soft.   I dont make fudge often and should have know better.  I picked this recipe because it didnt  use temperatures.  but now i realize you really need a candy thermometer to make decent fudge.  Also, I love sweet, but this was entirely too sweet even for me.  maybe less marshmellow fluff would have made it firmer.

It's fudge, but it's like pumpkin pie-scented marshmallow fudge. It wasn't the pumpkin pie-flavored pumpkin treat I was really looking for.

Excellent recipe! I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! The only change I made was I used my own pumpkin purÃ©e because I grow my own sugar pumpkins.

I just made this recipe, I followed the directions and yes I know what a rolling boil is.  It's cooling now but I can tell that it didn't turn out right, first of all the white chocolate chips wouldn't even melt all the way even though I boiled the mixture for 18 min and checked it with a thermometer.   The flavor is great but it has a grainy texture.  I will make pumpkin fudge again but not this recipe...

Followed directions exactly and the 18 minutes seemed way to long, consistency seemed about right around 8 minutes. The minute I added white chips it firmed and started to harden while I tried to stir in vanilla.Then it was unworkable crystalized and hard.

I love this fudge... stumbled across the recipe a year ago and it became my favorite. I followed the recipe and its really easy and fun to make and the house smells divine while I'm cooking it. I've  never had a problem with it yet, and if I did its so yummy I would still eat it...

I made this as listed, but with the addition of a couple smidges of pumpkin pie spice, a extra large handful of white chocolate bits & a little over a cup of chopped walnuts. It was a hit as a Thanksgiving dessert.   The added white chocolate helped the fudge keep from melting in a small kitchen that had an oven running for over 5 hours.  The consistency was still perfect after having sat in that hot room for over 3 hours.

Oh yeah, & I used foil under it & it did not stick at all!!!

I've made this several times with other recipes. This time it turned out delicious but for some reason it bound up when I added the chips and vanilla. Followed the recipe to a T,  not sure where I went wrong.

It was a bit time consuming with how long you have to watch and boil, but then again I did not look for a quick/ easy fudge recipe.  The only thing I changed was the cinnamon. Instead of 1 tsp of cinnamon, I did 1/4 tsp cinnamon and then 1/8 tsp each of ground clove, ginger and nutmeg.  I felt that gave a little more of the pumpkin pie type flavor.  Also, I did find that just taking the fudge off the heat to add and melt the chips took an extended amount of time, so I will maybe next time put it back on low heat to melt the chips a little faster.

Had a friend who made this fudge just last night. She told me where she got the recipe and like a lot of reviewers, had the same problem with gooey/sticky fudge. She followed the directions, however upon reading the recipe above, it lacks a serious piece of information that would aid people in cooking a delicious batch of pumpkin fudge. Particularly for those who are new to the fudge making process. The recipe should include after adding the marshmallow creme, bring to 220 - 230 F or to the soft-ball stage if you have a candy thermometer. That would greatly aid people in not having gooey fudge like my friend did, had she known to get it to the right temperature. Otherwise, it was a yummy fudge even gooey. Though if you do want something more pumpkin pie flavored, I would recommend adding some nutmeg and clover into as well.

I love it. I did use a candy thermometer, and had to cook it longer than the 18 minutes. I also added ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice, and used the whole bag of white chocolate chips.

The direction to "Bring to a rolling boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 18 minutes." ???? Holy Cow.  Made the candy brick hard. Did she/he mean "8 minutes"?

This did not set for me. I followed the recipe and did not change a thing. The only difference I can see is that unlike other ppl I did not use a candy thermometer. Maybe it just didn't get hot enough? It does turn unto a pumpkin caramel and might be good for dipping apples.

This came out great. I was completely intimidated by this recipe but then figured worst case it goes down the sink if it is yucky. I followed the cooking instructions exactly. I have a weird stove so I had to play with the flame so the boil was steady and not burnt but it worked great. I also took the advise and nixed the cinnamon in favor of Pumpkin pie spice and put about a teaspoon and a half. I can see how the pumpkin makes the texture just a smidge less cream than I'm used to with fudge but I do not care. This stuff is already cut and packed because I will sit and eat all of it. Thanks for the reviews and tips.

Absolutely phenomenal!!! I brought these to a potluck at my work and got several compliments ranging from "now that's what pumpkin fudge should taste like" to "its like taking a bite out of a pumpkin pie"! Be careful with how much of the white chocolate chips you use, otherwise it tastes a bit caky.

I love this recipe. I used a thermometer and cooked it to 230, which takes quite a bit longer than 18 minutes on my stove. Although it set quick it came out slightly dry. I have also made this recipe with 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and prefer it that way actually.

Delicious but mine did not turn out as orange as in the picture.  I wonder how to get it to come out a little bit softer.  It was hard to cut and usually fudge is a little softer than mine.  Not sure if I cooked it too long, I cooked at a roiling boil for exactly 18 minutes.

Very easy recipe!  I followed it exactly (hit a little snag with the 18 minutes cook-time: it took me 4 minutes to get all the Fluff out of the container!  So I adjusted the boiling time to 18 minutes after the last ounce of Fluff went into the mixture).  Took a good amount of whisking at the end to make the mixture creamy & uniform but it set perfectly in the pan, at room temperature left out on the table.  I used regular Reynolds wrap & it came out just fine.  A couple hours after it cooled I cut it into 1" squares & left them on the foil.  Can't wait to bring it work.

I made a batch for a pumpkin recipe contest at my church and I won! Everybody raved about how good it was and that they had never heard of pumpkin fudge.

I make a lot of candy; in other words I should know how to make this recipe and even using a timer and candy thermometer it turned out a goey disaster and never set up properly. I am disappointed as the idea was a nice one just poor in practice.

Tastes like pumpkin pie! I followed the directions exactly. The boil was not a hard and fast boil and not a soft rolling boil, I kept it in between and stirred only occasionally. I had no problems with the fudge sticking to the foil because I used the foil to lift the fudge out of the pan, then peeled away the sides. Easy! I have a history of not being able to make fudge, but this turned out perfectly. Everyone at work today is raving about it. The flavor improves if it's allowed to set a few hours after cooling. It's a keeper!

This is the best fudge I've ever made and I've been doing fudge every holiday season for years. I substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate (we're not fans), and it came out perfect. Not a bright orange, definitely a darker color but once you taste it this makes no difference! Oh, and like some other reviews mention, you HAVE to boil the mixture for at least 18 minutes for this to thicken enough, otherwise you will have caramel.

The reviews were right, it did not set and would not come free from the foil. Use the release foil and maybe it will work. White choc did not melt so use small chips or chop them. So I had to cook it more to melt chips and it did not harden up. What a waste. I found better recipes!!

I also got goo, which I'm trying to figure out a good use for.  I used Reynolds Wrap and all name-brand ingredients (no generics), and followed the directions carefully.  Disappointing, but am encouraged by the other reviews to try it again - if the goo is any indication, it'll be really tasty fudge.

I'm horrible at making fudge and this turned out perfect!!! It's pretty much fool proof so if you're trying to learn, this is a great start. I used the pumpkin spice the second time and it was just as good, better for me personally based on my taste. If you messed up somehow go through directions and FOLLOW them! Thanks for the recipe!!! I loved it!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I felt confident all through the process. It smelled great, set up great, the foil was no issue. But when I tasted it it tasted really sugary and not creamy at all. Quite a disappointment!

I was able to get the the pumpkin fudge to a fudge consistancy, but I won't be using this recipe again.  The taste wasn't as good as others I've had.  I'll be looking for another recipe to add to my recipe book.

This didn't turn out for me the first time (I guess I didn't cook it long enough?) but I plan to try again AFTER I buy a candy thermometer.  Following the directions made it turn out chewy and thin--definitely more like caramel.  It did taste good, though, if we could get enough of the foil off to enjoy it.

I had no problems making this, I have made fudge many times. Only problem was it did not taste good at all. I love pumpkin but did not like this. I also took this to a Halloween party and brought most of it back home with my dish. Some people said it was good.

I made this the 1st time last year and was very surprised at how it turned out. This was my 1st time making any type of fudge and it worked up just like if you had bought it in the store. My family and friends all love this fudge and I will be making more of it this year. I hope every enjoys this recipe the way me and my family does.

I had difficulty with this fudge.  The first time it was more of a carmel, and the second time it was hard as a rock.  The tast was great both times, but I was trying to get a fudge like candy.  any way I tried the spiced pumpkin fudge from this sight with much better success - it turned out creamy, and the first time it worked.  good luck

It was my first time making fudge and I went through all reviews, therefore, I decided to boil it longer than the recipe says. It turned out to be very dry, hard to cut. It seems 18 minutes boiling time would have been just enough. Otherwise it was too sweet for my taste, but I will definitely try this recipe again.

ok, I have never cooked fudge before.  Tastes good, but I think the recipe needs to indicate how to rapid boil.  I am a good cook, just did not know how to make fudge! Plese add something here about how to check to see when the fudge is done.  I think I may have boiled the fudge to high or something! Help.

This was wonderful!  I did as another reviewer suggested and doubled the amount of the white chocolate chips.  It was tastey but I think next time I will just follow the recipe.  It set up wonderfully and I just used the timer as the recipe said...no candy therm.  Thanks for the recipe.  Loved it!

Tried this today.  It was very easy to make.  Very rich, but good.  It would make a great gift for neighbors/co-workers/family.

This recipe was great and easy, got a little tired stirring but 18 minutes was enough. Will make it again and again. Loved it.

This fudge is ssoo yummy! I'm a huge pumpkin fan and this is a very unique way to enjoy the flavor. The reason I gave it a four is because of the minor adjustments. I didn't add nearly as much sugar as called for and put in a bit more white chocolate. Besides those few things this is a keeper.

Loved the flavor but I bombed this recipe miserably.  It came out more like pumpkin butter.  Put it in little cups with animal crackers on top and people seemed to like it (better than throwing it away).  I may purchase a candy thermometer to get this one right.

First of all, I love fudge and make different kinds every year and have been doing so for awhile now. I made this exactly as stated, with some reservations, and it failed miserably. Undeterred, I tried again making it more like I usually prepare fudge, which is adding the vanilla, marshmallow cream and chocolate after the fudge reaches soft ball stage.  This resulted in a thicker fudge, but still not like I like it.  The taste is wonderful, but I did use pumpkin pie spice.  I am going to try another recipe I located because really fudge should not be this hard! I do have some yummy mistakes to eat!

I read most of the reviews and attempted this recipe twice.  I cook, I follow recipes often, and I was shocked I totally screwed it up the first time!!  My fudge didn't set, I don't think I boiled it long enough (I did 18 minutes but I don't think my heat was high enough, I kept it more like a low-medium b/c it was boiling and medium heat seemed too high and I was afraid I was going to burn it)  More importantly, I didn't have a full cup of white chocolate chips for the first batch so that could have been part of it too.  The second time, I think I got it right, kinda.  I was afraid to under-cook it again so I cooked it for like 21 mins on medium heat.  I might have overcooked it a little bit but in the end it set fine, its just a little dry...probably b/c I over did it by the three minutes.  The taste is really good but I wish it was a little smoother.  It feels a little grainy in your mouth unless I did something else wrong?!  Overall, its decent and I will be serving it to guests!  I might attempt it one more time.

This fudge was awesome!  Every time I make fudge I boil until it reaches the soft ball stage.  My fudge reached that stage at around 16 minutes.  My grandpa was the king of fudge making & he always beat the fudge for several minutes after with a wooden spoon so that is what I did with this fudge as well.  I didn't mess with the foil.  I just buttered a serving platter & poured it straight onto the plate.  It turned out so good!  I'm sure I'll make several more batches this year!

The marshmallow creme should NOT be boiled, it should be added when the fudge is done as with other fudge recipes that use it.  I ended up with a sticky mess, but it did firm up after a few days on the counter and tasted great!

This was my first attempt at making fudge, and I've got to say it turned out rather well.  The fudge set decently and I didn't have any of the problems with it turning into a sticky pile of goo that other reviewers seem to have had.  The finished product had a pretty decent flavor, but was EXTREMELY sweet, so if there was a way to scale back slightly on the sweetness, it would make this even better.  Additionally, the texture wasn't exactly what I was expecting, which isn't a complaint, but if you're expecting and extremely smooth and creamy end product you're in for a little bit of a surprise.  Like other reviewers, I used nutmeg and cloves in addition to the cinnamon, and added an extra little dash of each of the spices, since a teaspoon in total seemed like it would leave the fudge tasting a little bland.  Overall, I was really pleased with how this turned out, but if there's a way to cut back on how sweet the fudge is, I would go for it as I couldn't have more than a small bite or two before I felt I had my fill of sugar (though really, one probably shouldn't be having more than a bite or two of fudge anyway, so I'll credit the recipe with having built-in portion control).

I am going to try and make this fudge, I made the Easy Fudge recipe and lined my pan with foil. When it is done you simply grab the foil by the sides and pull gently up and put on a cutting board and cut. No muss, no fuss.

My pumpkin fudge was a huge flop!! I give it 3 stars cause I think it was more my fault it didn't turn out. I didn't have a temp gauge to see how hot the fudge was. I just eye balled it like I do everything but I have now learned the hard way that this is not one of those recipes you can do that with. I will most likely try this recipe again after I purchase a temp gauge!

I took this to Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon as suggested.  Although I did use a candy thermometer, it hit soft ball stage (230 degrees) at exactly 18 minutes which is what the recipe says.  I'll definitely be making this again.

It was a big hit for us.  Just the right amount of Pumpkin Flavor and I did use a candy thermometer and made sure it hit the 230 degree mark before taking it off the stove.  It get's 4 stars only because I added a little extra pumpkin pie spice for flavor and because it was kind of tricky to make, I burnt my hand pretty bad trying to stir in the marshmellow while it was boiling, but even so, it's great!  I've had two people try it so far and each of taken some home after saying it was really good!

I've had pumpkin fudge before and although the flavor in this is great it needs a little help on the texture. Next time I will add more wh/ch chips as others recommended. Great for the season. Thanks for sharing!

My daughter loves anything pumpkin so I made this for her, but I really enjoyed this.  Instead of just the cinnamon I wanted to use pumpkin pie spice, but I was out of that so I looked for a recipe for pumpkin pie spice and it made the fudge amazing.

This turned out great. I was very nervous while making this as I did not have a candy thermometer but used the soft ball stage water test. I will now be purchasing a candy thermometer so it will make my life a little easier. I will definitely be making this again. They actually wanted $10.99/lb for this fudge at the store and this is just as good if not better!

I messed up and followed a suggestion that the 18 minutes was enough and ignored the fact that my candy thermometer wasn't at 230 yet. It worked great as an apple dip but didn't set up for fudge. I am definitely trying again and getting up to full temp. The flavor is out of this world. It will make awesome fudge just make SURE you are at soft ball stage!

Those who failed at this recipe should invest in a candy thermometer. Fudge must be heated to the "soft ball" stage which starts at 234 F on a candy thermometer. If you over heat or under heat fudge it will not turn out. As for this recipe, I added nutmeg, allspice, ginger and cloves. It turned out as I had expected. I would have liked a little more pumpkin flavor but with only 3/4 cups of pumpkin it was only a hint of pumpkin flavor. The pumpkin also makes the texture slightly grainy. It will not turn out as creamy as chocolate so just be prepared. Overall the taste was very pleasant and a very nice change from the ordinary.

I added chocolate fudge frosting to the top of this when it cooled, I did not care for it, but my hubby loved, it so it gets a 5! He is very peculiar about 5 and he took it to work to share, so it is definately worth a 5 for that!

I expected a creamier fudge.  It is almost wet; more like an ice cream topping but set up.  I did not have a problem with it setting up but I couldn't get the white chips to melt.  I must have stirred for 15-20 minutes after adding the chips just trying to get them to melt.  I'm going to keep looking for a creamier fudge.

I found the flavor not very 'pumpkin-y'. I added pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon but that didn't improve the flavor.

This was wonderfully different!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did use a candy thermometer as suggested by numberous others.  The ladies at work loved it and I already have requests for the recipe! Thanks for a great new recipe!

It was hard to give this a star rating as I think I boiled mine a bit too long. It set up very fast and as a result is very dry. I should have used the suggestion of boiling only 10 minutes or purchased and used a candy thermometer (I suggest doing this and will do so in the future). I want to try this one again and get it right...it sounds so good. Thanks for the recipe, Cathy!
