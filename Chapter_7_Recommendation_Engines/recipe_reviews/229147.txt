I made these for church coffee hour and they were a great hit.  I had no fresh basil, so used dried, and it was fine.  I would soften the cheese spread a little more next time.  Meg

I was out of fresh basil so I had to substitute for dried. This was good and filling.

I made this tart tonight to go with poached salmon. It was fabulous and quite easy to put together! Would definitely make again. Thanks!

These take a little effort, but are definitely worth in the end!  Next neighborhood get together I plan to take these.
