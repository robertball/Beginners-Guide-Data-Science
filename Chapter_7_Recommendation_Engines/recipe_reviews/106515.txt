Very simple to make although with a long preparation time. The soup, if cooked as directed will result in a very tasty soup. It's worth the effort, a real homemade recipe.

It's a keeper!  Very good as is; but we're tinkerers and we:
-added small chunks of 1 avacado
-1 cup of cilantro
-drained the onion mix of excess oil before adding the other items (the soup has a significant layer of oil!)

This is super popular with everyone I've made it for. However, I do make my own chicken stock, and I shred the chicken instead of using pieces - also, I make the rice separately - because if you store it all together, the rice sucks up the stock and your leftovers are kind of gross and soggy. Also, a little less potatoe.

This is my favorite soup when I go to Peruvian restaurants and I was hoping the recipe came out well.  It was great!  I doubled the cilantro because whenever I've had aguadito before, it's been super green with tons of cilantro.   (I added half at the beginning like the recipe said, and then saved the rest until a couple of minutes before the soup was finished) I also used bone-in chicken and shreaded it off the bone at the end.    Next time, I'd probably use more broth...  Serving suggestion:  add some lime, and if you like spice, try making the aji sauce that is often served with it.  MMMM...

Delicious soup! Very authentic recipe. I just added some celery in with the onion to cook, and little more garlic. I feel like I'm in Peru eating this soup. Tastes and looks just like it's supposed to.

Hangover, colds, flu, getting it back together recipe!!  it tasted like home! however I substituted the "minced serrano chile" mainly because as a Peruvian I had no idea what it was, with aji amarillo available frozen in big chains. This made it more traditional and extra delicious. Just make sure you handle the aji with disposable gloves or plastic bags in your hands while you get the veins and seeds of them, rinse and cut into medium slivers.  Another note, don't chop the stems of the cilantro in your mix.  They are bitter, however difficult try to use leaves only.  Scissors helped.

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it.  I skipped the rice to save on a few carbs.  My adult children even took home the left overs.  I will definitely make this again.  I cut the chicken and potatoes into smaller pieces and it saved a lot of time.

Very good soup.  I want to try a couple of changes however.  I will use a little less rice and use brown rice.  I used one serano pepper and will use two next time and probably add a few seeds for a little pepper heat.

I shredded my chicken because I do not like a soup you have to cut up before eating. I used the whole serrano because I wanted the heat and I threw some shrimp in that needed used up (loved that addition). This would have been a 5 star (with or without the shrimp) except the cook time is off. I shaved 10 minutes off and my rice was still overcooked. Great soup and one I will make again.

Absolutely Fantastic! Thank you for the recipe. I used a home made chicken broth with garlic, onions and celery. I love chicken soup and this one is a keeper.

I'm a HUGE soup fan and this get's the top star for me.  It was so delicious and hearty. It says to just cut the chicken breasts in half but then I had these "huge" chicken breasts sitting in the pot when the soup was done.  Next time I will cut these into bite size pieces - same goes for the potatoes.  GREAT RECIPE.

This is a great recipe and I have gotten a lot of requests from the staff at school.  The students did cut up the chicken and the potatoes for the class but that is the only changes we made.

I enjoyed, of course I take the jest of the recipe and do my own thing. I added more spices, cut things smaller to cook more uniform. but truly enjoyed.

this was absolutely delicious! i didnt have serrano chile so i put one jalapeno chile and one habanero. for most people a whole habanero would be too spicy in the soup but if you like spicy, which both my husband and i love, you will love this flavor (try half an habanero just to be safe :) 
i also used only 2 potatoes, 2 breast halves of chicken, half cup peas and half cup corn. which was plenty and i had to add 4 extra cups of broth as the uncooked rice and potato's starchiness reduced the amount of liquid. (i added organic vegetable broth bullion cubes mixed with water since i didn't have any more chicken broth. it added amazing flavor). also, i only had to cook it for about 30 minutes. i would have cooked it for 20 but had to let it cook longer because the rice was not fully cooked. next time i will try making this with half the amount of rice that has been slightly cooked before adding it in the pot. 
i served it with a wedge of lime squeezed right into the bowl and fresh chopped cilantro. my husband and i loved it!!! i will definitely be making this recipe again. thank you!

Here is a delicious soup that is simple to prepare. I used a whole jalapeño because my grocery did not have serranos and I used quinoa rather than rice. I used low-sodium chicken broth and "no-salt-added" corn to reduce the amount of sodium.

My inexperience with quinoa led to the "mush" other reviewers have mentioned, but the result was still very tatsty. I'll add it a bit later in the process next time. The chicken breast halves come apart with a spoon, but I will try pulling the chicken apart per other recommendations.

I was looking for a unique chicken soup recipe and happened upon this one. I followed the recipe exactly and was so pleased with the outcome. This is a delicious, hearty soup. Next time I'll add an extra serrano or two and leave some seeds for a little more kick. But overall, my hubby and I loved it! Yum!

Riquissimo! I served this at a family dinner two days ago---everyone LOVED it!  I increased the recipe ingredients by half, as I needed more servings. I was wondering if potatoes and rice might be a bit too much starch, but it was not, and the combination of all the flavors was delicious! Thank you, Jose!

I stated out by making homemade broth, boiled a whole chicken with celery, onion, garlic, cracked pepper and a bay leaf. Then strained the broth, shredded the chicken and sat aside. I then sauteed the garlic, onion and chiles (I used 2 and it still wasn't real spicy) in only a 1/4 cup of olive oil   1/2 cup seemed like too much,then added the shredded chicken, broth etc and continued on. It was really quite good on the cold rainy night we were having here. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe deserves 5 stars! I made it last night for sick hubby. He loved it. I loved it. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. I really love the flavor of the fresh cilantro. I did use the less expensive bone-in chicken breast and par-boiled first, then picked the meat from the bones. Also saved the cooked broth and combined that with chicken broth, which cuts down on what you need for store-bought broth. Pre-cooked Basmati rice added last - which is good because I don't like overcooked rice or pasta in a soup. So easy to make and yummy ... bravo on this recipe!

I'm peruvian and grew up eating rice and potatoes in the same meal so this recipe appealed to me!  This soup is great!  I made it just as the recipe said to, except with brown rice instead of white.  Would be great for a crowd, since it makes a lot. I'm going to remove the potatoes and freeze the rest (potatoes don't freeze well).  I bet its great leftover.

This needed more "zip" for me.  Also, there was way too much oil.
Next time I will leave the seeds in the Serrano chile, add more garlic and only use about 1/4 c olive oil.

I remember whenever my mother's family would make this, and it always seemed more "aguado" more watery, and not as stewed as this ended up turning out. Maybe I did something wrong, but I think next time I'll add more water and cooked the rice separate, so this doesn't turn mushy as this did when I reheated the leftovers.

So good. Tastes likes a burrito, but in soup form, and not too spicy. Well worth the effort.

This was so delicious. Next time I will try to use homemade chicken broth as mine was a little too salty, but the cilantro flavour was great. Like other reviewers said the rice absorbed a lot of water and the leftovers were sort of mushy but it still tasted great. Will definitely make again, and next time I'll double the serrano since we could barely taste it!

This is the second time making the recipe - first was great. I'm making it for my 5 year old's bd so I am halving or less the seranos. I'll post again on how it went over.   Also, to someone below, consider that you are not cooking chicken 1/2s, but you are halving 1/2s - could you have purchased whole chicken breasts? Also, crosshatching the breast will let the flavours enter and allow the chicken to dissolve into the stock a bit better.

A nice variation of basic chicken stew.  Made this for my wife's bridge group and they loved it.  Leftovers are great.  I cut chicken and poratoes into smaller pieces---a 1/2 chicken breast makes for a big spoonful.  I thickened broth with corn starch the second day and liked it even better.

Excellent. I didn't have all of the ingredients (no red pepper, only 2 large chicken breast halves, which I cut into bite-sized pieces and only 8 cups of broth and very finely minced cilantro), but it was fabulous. Just like my local Peruvian restaurant's. I will make this again. The large amount of olive oil scared me and I checked to see if it was a mistake, but it cooks into the soup and is barely noticeable.

As written, the recipe is boring.  It needs another serano chili (at least), cumin, half the rice, the whole red bell pepper.  Cut the potatoes into smaller pieces and cook only 25 minutes, then shred the chicken.  Garnish with cilantro and wedge of lime.

I was surprised to see this on here. My mom is Peruvian and makes this dish many times a year.  She was surprised to see it actually doesn't look like real aguadito, its a lot thicker. In traditional aguadito, you use a whole chicken chopped up and you blend the cilantro, green pepper, green onions and parsley in a blender and add to it. It's actually supposed to look more like a stew than a soup. Mabye I'll post the traditional recipes, it's delicious!

Interesting soup, and it was actually pretty good.  However, the cooking time definitely needs to be shortened when using white meat and cooking it into the soup. 40 minutes would equal very dry chicken.  I chopped the potatoes smaller to cut the time down to about 25 minutes.  I LOVE the heat from the serrano peppers, and the cilantro is tasty.  This soup is a keeper, but with some tweaks.  I think next time I'm going to try less rice and a mix of white and dark meat.  Thanks!

Loved this! Only change I made was to use one cup cooked quinoa instead of potatoes and rice. (I cooked it seperately, then added.) Delicious and pretty...thanks for the recipe!

Very good on a cold night! I have made it twice now. I cooked it in the crock pot the first time I made it and put the rice in too early. The second time I just added some leftover rice at the end. Such a good flavor to this soup.

This is a nice hearty soup, with both rice and potatoes...almost like a stew!  I had my husband make it and he put in BOTH the serrano chili's i had bought along with their seeds.....yikes!!! very spicy.  next time it'll be just one, with a few seeds...and i think the flavour will come through better.  It's great on a colder day  :)

I was so excited to make this.  I really enjoy the flavor of Peruvian cuisine.  This didn’t live up to what I’ve had before. I made as written but subbed one thing and added more of the others. 
Here are the changes I made: for some reason I thought it said one Serrano not one TBS ( using double the amount of Serrano it still was not spicy enough). Two garlic cloves. Subbed carrots (had some left over)   for the potatoes and I cooked a cup of rice separate bcause I used the instant pot to sauté and then slow cook the soup. I added the rice (which was way too much) before serving.  I also put a whole bunch of cilantro tied with twine into the soup (this is such a delicious flavor) so I could take it out and add fresh for serving.  I added 2 tsp of rouge pimento. There was hardly any flavor.  This soup needed a bit of brightness. maybe lemon juice?

So happy I found this recipe! Made some adaptations — seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and Caldo Del Pollo and used boned chicken with skin for extra flavor. I added a LOT more garlic, took out the red bell pepper, and used less potatoes. Used one carton of chicken broth and a few cups of water. I could tell adding the peas and corn so early on was going to make it mushy, so I saved half the corn and peas to add with the rice at the end. Garnished with some fresh cilantro, some fresh lime juice, and aji sauce.

When I moved from the Los Angeles area I was so sad to leave my favorite Peruvian restaurant, El Pollo Inka, behind.  This soup is very close to their chicken cilantro soup and is delicious.  Now I just need their green sauce (Aji) recipe.  I haven't found anything close but I'm not giving up!

We found this soup fairly bland, to be honest.  Felt that it needed more "flavor" - like maybe some kind of spice or herbs.  Perhap that's the way it's supposed to be, but it's not our taste.  Followed the recipe with only a few minor changes - cooked the rice separately as many reviewers had suggested; increased garlic; and used two serranos.  Plan to  work on it more in leftovers.

I have made this several times, but lost the recipe.  So thankful for this site and that you still have it!!  I am making it again this weekend.  A little spicy, but you can actually make it extremely spicy or just flavorful, which ever you prefer. Great soup!!

Super! Travelled to Peru last year and was haunted by this soup. First, used chicken broth cubes #2 instead of stock (stock was too greasy on first attempt). Then, skipped the potatoes and green peas unintentionally, so I used garbanzo beans, garnished with Haas avocado and a squeeze of lime??

This was easy to do.  Didn't have peas or cilantro.  Used other spices.  Turned out great.  Cooked rice separately.  Used more garlic.

This soup is wonderful! My husband took some to work and everyone in his office wanted some! The only thing I did different was use regular patatoes. This is perfect for a cold winters night!

Delicious!  Used poblano and anaheim peppers instead, and still turned out great.

I've made this a couple of times now.  I've never had Yukon potatoes before so decided to get the "proper" kind & try them.  I still prefer red but they worked.  I left the chicken and potatoes as bigger pieces for cooking as I was afraid if I strayed that the chicken might dry out while waiting for flavors to blend or whatever.  And then once everything was cooked I cut things down a bit smaller.  Couple of minor changes like leaving out the red pepper as they really don't do anything for me.  All that olive oil was a bit much too.  In the end, pretty good stuff with an interesting semi-tangy flavor.  I didn't go wild crazy over it, but it's good, and reasonably easy to make.

The only changes I made were to cut the chicken into small bite-sized pieces, and I used two jalepeno peppers. Oh, and I coooked the rice separately. The soup turned out well but I thought there was something missing, not sure what though. Anyway, nice recipe, Jose. Thanks!

Cooked it up for Thanksgiving. Crowd liked it very much. Not fancy by any stretch but very tasty - people wanted left-overs.
