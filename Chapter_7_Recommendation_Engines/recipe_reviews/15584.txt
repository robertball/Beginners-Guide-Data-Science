I love this pie! It is always a hit when I make it and a local dinner serves it as their specail one day a week. I like to try walnuts or pecans to give it a different flavor and mini-chips work best for me.

I think the cooking time is long since it would have burned in my oven if I hadn't been watching, but otherwise a great tasting pie.  My 2.5 yr old helped me make it for Christmas eve and we had a wonderful time.

This recipe is great,  but the thing is, this recipe is originally from Kentucky.   It is called Derby Pie,  and has always been from the Ky. Derby.

I've been making this for decades! Always a winner, exactly as written! Wonderful with gobs and gobs of unsweetened whipped cream to cut the sweetness. Amazing served warm!

This is not the same as derby pie.  Derby pie has bourbon --   Grandma was a teetotaler. :)  But this pie is exceptional -- rich, chocolaty and the perfect way to end a holiday meal, and this is a great version of it!

This was close enough to "awesome" that I'll give it a 5-star rating instead of just 4 ("Liked it"). I made it exactly as written, noting that for the nuts I used about 1/3 pecans, and 2/3 walnuts. It's a bit different for a pie, but tasted great, and I managed to make it last for 5 or 6 days. It's just like the recipe description says: like a  "giant soft chocolate chip cookie."

This recipe performs as expected but I have to agree with other reviewers regarding white sugar vs brown sugar.  There are other recipes with brown sugar that I prefer.

Holy cow I would give this 10 stars if I could!  Absolutely amazing.  Left the nuts out because I don't like them.  Otherwise made exactly as written.  I started off in the oven for 50 minutes, but mine did take a full hour.  Delicious!

I have a convection oven, so I loweredthe temp to 305 for 55mins. I also used brown sugar instead of white. It was perfect! Definitely making again!
