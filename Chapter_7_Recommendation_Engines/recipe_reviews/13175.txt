I loved this recipe, but I modified it slightly because I thought it was too bland at first (I tasted it after it came to a boil).  I cooked 4 slices of bacon (as per another reviewer suggestion), and then I sauteed the onion, green pepper, and a bit of garlic in the grease.  I did everything else according to the recipe, only I added a bit of Worcestershire (maybe 2 tsp.), about 1/4 cup sherry, garlic powder, onion powder, and chili powder (all to taste).  My husband and I couldn't get enough.  I still gave the recipe a 5 because it really is so simple, and the base is still good but easily modified to taste.

This is similar to my old Pa's recipe, but he always started with frying 4 slices of bacon until crisp, crumble & reserve the bacon, use the bacon grease to fry the onion & peppers, then proceed as the recipe states. Like another reviewer, Pop used clam juice (or started by boiling the clam shells to make the broth)too, rather than water.  (I have recently found clam base, which is very effective. Adjust salt if you use this.)  He also added 2 well rounded TBSP of paprika - add the crumbled bacon to the soup at the end.  This chowder blew out at his restaurant - you'll see why!

I generally prefer Boston clam chowder but since I didn't have many of the ingredients I opted for this one and BOY, am I glad I did!  I followed previous reviewer with the bacon idea but about half the paprika. Also since the only suitable bread I had was a couple days past its best, I turned it into croutons, frying in the same bacon grease. I only had canned clams and yellow rather than green pepper and only a little green onions so I added regular onions. This was a HUGE HIT with my husband.  He raved and raved about it. Thanks a million for the ideas and input!

I made this recipe to feed a few friends when I was married.  Several months after we were divorced, my ex-husb called me to ask me to make this, freeze it, pack it in dry ice and ship it overnight to him!
I've tweaked to my taste over the last few years by adding more onions, using diced new potatoes, canned clams and extra hot sauce!  It's one of my signature dishes now!

I used a bag of mixed seafood in addition to the clams. Put in 2 stalks sliced celery and 2 sliced carrots in place of the bell pepper. Also used fresh chopped parsley and 2 tablespoons of " Old Bay" seasoning to spice it up a bit.This recipe was so easy to make and came out great. I will definetly make this again.

This chowder has real character. Using bottled clam juice instead of water will enhance the clam flavor slightly. I prefer "sopping" with warm French bread instead of chowder crackers.

This is a great base for a very good manhattan chowder. With the addition of other reviewers revisions it is great! I used three reviewers suggestions combined. Added celery, garlic, yellow onion, worscestershire, sherry, paprika and old bay seasoning. Also used clam juice instead of water. Also used the bacon suggestion saut√©ed all vegetables except tomatoes in bacon grease. Added great flavor.

The delicious and easy way of making Manhattan clam chowder. This is very tasty! I usually end up using freshly shucked clams, and adding in a half bottle of clam juice. The end result has turned out great every time. Thanks for sharing, Corwynn!

My first attempt at making Clam Chowder. I think it could be a bit thicker. I basically doubled the entire recipe..used two cans of fire roasted diced tomatos, more potatos, and i took the advice of the chili pepper seasoning and the bacon. Serve with some oyster crackers or saltines. Really great way to use up the clams before they go bad and have lots to share with your friends.

***A TIP***   If you are lucky enough to have fresh clams or better yet Quahogs, for this recipe, try freezing the clams before using them.  They will open once they are frozen.  Just remember to thaw them over a container so you do not lose any of the juice...happy eating!!!!

Very tasty recipe.  It was quite easy to prepare, and goes very well with toasted bread.  I couldn't wait to reheat left overs the next day for lunch.

Outstanding!  I added the above listed items and it was amazing.  I doubled the recipe, and also added about 8oz of crab and a pound of small shrimp.  YUMMY

I added a nice little twist to the suggestions made by Music_Minx.   Instead of 2 tablespoons of Paprika, try 1/2 tablespoon of Smoked Paprika - it really goes well with the tomato base of this recipe.

Every time I go to visit my grandparents, my grandma and I cook together...this is one of our absolute favourites! SO good. To make this more economical but still keep up the flavour, we use canned clams (about 2-3 cans) but add extra Clamato juice and the bottled brine, in addition to 4 strips of fried bacon, carrots, and celery.  The extra liquid does thin the soup out a bit, but if you mash up the vegetables a bit as they cook it turns into a lovely consistency.

I guess I should not have tried this one.  I'm not a fan of Manhattan clam chowder, but my spouse is.  Made it for him. The spicy clam juice gave him instant heartburn, so I had to eat almost the whole thing! Flavor was good, okay for rainy day company, but only a bowl full for me. Should have frozen it, used it slowly.  But smart I am not always! If you like Manhattan chowder, this is a nice recipe. I flame-roasted/peeled/chopped the red bell pepper.

First I saut√©ed a little onion, celery, and carrots together, then added the potatoes.  Then I followed the rest of the recipe but added some tomato paste at the end to thicken it up a bit and added fresh parsley.  Will definitely make again!  So easy!

This came out great!!  Well, I've tasted it as its cooking now, lol.  Its a perfect day for this too.  This recipe is exactly like my late Italian mil, used to make.  Very tasty.  I think she put some fresh garlic into hers.  The bacon idea was a nice touch.  I'm known for making great New England Clam Chowder.  We are huge fish and shellfish people in my family, so I wanted to try this for a change.  Am I glad I did.  Super easy and very delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

Was well liked by my husband. Didn't measure out clams. He's a clam lover so just added them. Will make again
