This was pretty good.  It has potential. I am going to try it again but add  some fresh vegetables like brocoli, red bell pepper and onion. I served it over rice.

Although I changed some of the ingredients, I still gave it a 5 b/c my husband was whooping and raving about how good it was.  I've spent hours on some recipes and have never gotten this reaction. Here's my variation (only because I didn't have some of the ingredients):  	Used thighs vs. breasts b/c they absorb flavor better and I'm not particularly fond of breast.  Used soy sauce substitution (didn’t have soy sauce – recipe below). 	¼ cup honey vs. pineapple juice (didn’t have on hand).
Tennessee Whiskey – would use 2 Tbs next time or cook a little longer to burn off alcohol. 2 Tbs brown sugar, maybe a tad more.
* Seasoned chicken with salt and sautéed, adding a small sliced onion halfway through and cooking until chicken was no longer pink and onion soft.
* Added a chopped carrot and sauce mixture and brought it to a boil.  Turned off heat and let it sit for 30 min (almost like a marinade) because I was waiting for hubby to get home.                             *Cooked for 15 minutes and added cornstarch to thicken.

Served over mashed potatoes - loved it!  and better yet, hubby loved it

 
SOY SAUCE SUBSTITUTE   

1 1/2 c. boiling water
4 tbsp. low sodium beef bouillon
Pinch pepper
1 tbsp. dark molasses
4 tbsp. cider vinegar
1 tsp. sesame seed oil

Combine all ingredients in a bowl, stirring to blend thoroughly. Pour into jars. Cover and seal tightly. May be refrigerated indefinitely. Shake well before using. Makes 2 cups sauce

I agree with MOLSON7 on this one all the way!  I have to admit, when I first put it together, and "taste tested" it, my reaction was less then impressed.... then, I served it over rice and as I made my way through it, it seemed to get better and better... almost like an "acquired taste" sort of thing.  I personally added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the "broth" to thicken it a bit.  I will be making this one again, but think it can be much improved upon by using chunked pineapple in heavy syrup along with red and green bell peppers cut in strips.

As a busy college student, I greatly appreciated a recipe that was this quick, easy, and delicious.  After taking the chicken out of the pan, add a touch of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken, then cover the chicken and serve with rice.  Very yummy.

I like that you can throw this together at the last minute, no marinating. Next time I would cut the pineapple juice in half, add one more tbls of bourbon and I had to add one tbls of cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken.

I thought this was a really great recipe. My Mom, Dad and I all loved it. It was easy to make and very tasty! I served it with green beans, salad, rolls, and mashed potatoes (with the sauce as the gravy for the potatoes). It was a good meal, and I will definitely make it again. I say to try it and experiment with it to your taste (more pepper or bourbon, etc.) With a jazzy Harry Connick CD playing in the background, you'll feel like you're eating on Bourbon Street.

We thought this dish was fabulous. Added a few more seasonings including ginger and added broccoli to the chicken. Served it over orzo pasta. Thanks so much Jamie!

This turned out well although I changed the baking method. I cooked my chicken on a griddle in some EVOO just to get it browned up and then transferred to a 13x9 pan. I stirred about 2 Tbsp. cornstarch into the sauce mixture and poured this over the chicken and baked it at 350 until the chicken was cooked through, about 30 minutes. The sauce thickened up nicely in the oven. You can definitely pick up the whiskey flavor a bit but it was not too overpowering even for the kids.  served with mashed potatoes and peas.

I don't know what I did wrong here, followed recipe to the tee and was not impressed.  The whiskey was overwhelming, it was all I could taste.  I know the recipe is called whiskey chicken, but I thought it would be like the Bourbon chicken you get at those Chinese places in the mall.  IF I make again, I will use less bourbon whiskey.

I would recommend this to anyone, but I did "cheat" a little - my chicken breasts were frozen, so I dumped a tablespoon each of water, honey, and single malt scotch on them, crushed some small garlic cloves, and let them "marinate" in the refrigerator for a bit.  I also used Johnny Walker (scotch) instead of bourbon, because that's what we had in the house.  When I sauteed the chicken, I added the garlic that was in the marinade.  And an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, and about 1/8 tsp cornstarch.  It needs at least 15 minutes to simmer, I think.  I thought this was fabulous served over yellow rice.

I doubled the sauce, poured some in a container and the rest joined the chicken in a zip bag; both spent the night in the fridge. Later discarded the zip bag of marinade, browned the chicken to a slight blush of brown and baked in the oven @ 350 for 30 min, using saved sauce as a baste. I also used a trace of sauce to simmer mushrooms, diced red and green peppers. Add the veggies to a compliment of your favorite pasta and dreamy creamy Alfredo sauce really sets this dish among the fine restaurant ranks.

I followed this recipe perfectly and even used top of the line whiskey.  I didn't like it at all.  So much that I couldn't even finish what was on my plate.  My husband eats everything and he didn't like it either.

I agree with many other posters...this recipe has great potential. I did add onion and chopped pineapple along with minced garlic to the chicken as it cooked. I didn't have any bourbon whiskey so I used an Irish whiskey. After simmering for 20 minutes I also had to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This will definitely be made again and will experiment more with it.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I cooked it exactly as stated served over rice and it was so-so (3 stars) but my husband liked it so I gave it a second chance.  The second time it was definitely 5 stars. I added 1 extra tbs of whisky and another of sugar and 1 heaped tablespoon of very finely chopped red chili.  In the morning I mixed up the sauce ingredients, pierced the chicken all over with a fork and then marinated it until it was time to cook it.  I scraped off the marinade and cooked it as given in the recipe and it was much nicer.  We served it the second time with green salad, couscous and a dollop of sour cream on top and it was totally stunning.

I liked this.  The whiskey and pineapple juice went very well together.  I think the next time I make it I'll add a little more pepper and probably some more garlic, maybe some fresh garlic along with the powder.

A big hit with the whole family!  I doubled the recipe for the sauce, added some ginger and Frank's Red Hot, increased the whiskey (used Canadian vs. Bourbon)by 1 TBS.  I used half (or one original recipe) for a marinade and put in the fridge for 1-2 hours before dinner.  As others mentioned, I did add a little corn starch at the end to thicken.  Unanimous vote from the family to add this to the regular rotation.

very good esp if you cook the chicken in the liquid..it brings it down to more of a sauce and it makes the chicken more flavorful and tender.. We like it with the mashed potatoes as well..Its even better the next day>>

This was ok. It really was just sweet and sour chicken. Was disappointed that the taste of the whiskey didn't come through more. Next time I'll marinate in whiskey. Also, not nearly as dark and carmelized as the picture. Sauce woudn't thicken so I had to add corn starch.

I made this for dinner tonight expecting to have what I saw in the picture but it did not look anything like it.  The sauce was very light and I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding broccoli. I'm not sure if maybe I needed to use dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar or if I needed to use a dark soy sauce.  Even though it didn't like the same it tasted great!  Next time I might try a dark soy sauce

Very good! I took the advice of many of the other reviewers and first sauteed onions and 1 clove of garlic in two tablespoons of olive oil and then during the last few minutes of cooking the chicken in the soy sauce mixture I added broccoli and red bell pepper. Lastly, I made some brown rice and poured it on top. Deliciousness!

This was a pretty good meal, but it wasn't overly memorable.  I was expecting the whiskey to really give it a distinct, different flavor- but between the pineapple juice and brown sugar, really just ends up tasting like a generic asian chicken dish.  We even added extra whiskey to give it more of a kick... ultimately I just felt bad for using up the Jack Daniels... whiskey is an expensive ingredient to have such a anti-climactic result.  Like I said, it was good- just not much more interesting than the next chicken dish.

This was a good base. As is it's 3 stars.  To me, it needed some tweaking. This is just my opinion.  I added less that a cup of pineapple juice--1 cup would have been too sweet. I also added the whiskey by CAPful to desired taste. Also added chopped garlic, more pepper, broccoli, onions, corn starch, a pinch of salt and a heap of crushed pepper flakes. I also cooked the meat first (whole pieces) in a pan, poured all the ingredients into a baking dish and baked until done. I read where the smell of the whiskey cooking was not so good, so I baked it to burn the alcohol off. I then transferred everything bake into the pan I cooked the chicken in , cut up the chicken and added more of the above ingredients to taste. With a little tweaking, it's quite good. Some people like more of a sweet taste, some like spice. If you are going to go follow the recipe as is, mix the sauce together in a bowl and taste it, you can always add more to it. We loved it.

I really liked it alot. I would have given it 5 stars but it really just tasted like sweet and sour chicken. Maybe I'll add more whiskey next time.

my husband loved this.  We had no left overs.  I added cornstarch like a previous review said to do and I added some broccoli. Delish!

WOW!!!!!!! This is a million times better than any restaurant could make!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except:  -replaced pineapple juice with syrup from canned pears (no pineapple juice handy) -sauteed chicken in chicken broth to keep some moisture in -added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper THE BEST!!!!!!

Sauce is ok in flavor, but pretty thin. I used cornstarch to thicken it, and also added some broccoli, red pepper, red onion and garlic to the recipe.

i must say that i wasn't sure what to expect from this dish. It was interesting to try, but i probabaly will not try this recipe again. I found it a little on the bland side. i was hoping for a little more spark in the dish ( because of the whiskey). I feel that there is something missing in the dish, and i cannot figure what it is.  i beleive that this could be a a very good dish ( if i could figure out what the ingrediant is)

We really enjoyed this as did our friends - there were NO leftovers.  I doubled the recipe, went with extra garlic powder and added 2 T cornstarch to thicken the sauce, served over rice.  Thought that it smelled great while cooking. Thank you for sharing!

I'm sorry, but I truly did not like this dish.  I would suggest that if you are not a fan of bourbon, you stay away.  I am so-so about bourbon, but cooking it really brings out the pungent smell, which I couldn't handle.  Other than that, I liked it, but the bourbon was so overpowering....

really didn't care for this.  I used crushed pinapple and southern comfort.  It seemed to be a bit bland still, even with the changes, as suggested from others.  I don't think I will try this again.

Smells awful when it's cooking; the bourbon will make you gag, but when it comes off the stove it's delicious. I added a little bit more brown sugar than the recipes asked for to make it a little bit more carmelizzed.

Delicious, only difference was I had no pineapple juice and so used honey and water instead of the 1C pineapple juice. Also, left the breasts in fillet sized and it made a great gourmet-tasting dinner.

This recipe was easy to make, but I didn't really like it. For anyone who thinks it may, it does NOT taste anything like TGIF"S. Although the chicken was really tender, the taste wasn't so great. All I could taste was pineapple juice, and I had to cook it for a lot longer than 15 min. to get it to reduce and to get the alcohol burned out of the dish. Sorry, but I probably will not make this again.

I read many of the comments before making this dish. I used 6oz. of pineapple juice and 4 tablespoons of whiskey. I also substituted Splenda for the brown sugar and threw in mushrooms and red & yellow peppers. Instead of serving it over rice, I steamed fresh green beans and put it over those. This is a great recipe and I will definitely use it again!

I had to sub out a few ingredients. Instead of pineapple juice, which I didn’t have on hand, I used apple cider. Also, had to use Jack Daniels Rye cause I was all out of bourbon. Nevertheless it came out alright.

I didn't have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I doubled the marinade and added red bell pepper and broccoli. Baked in glass pan covered with tinfoil for 35 mins at 375. Served over wild and long grain rice. Very tasty! Will make again

I had some honey crisp apples that I added to the recipe, so I didn't use pineapple juice.  I cooked the apples in the pan with a few tablespoons of bourbon.  Once they were softened, I took them out and cooked the chicken as directed.  I used minced garlic instead of powder and used chicken stock for liquid since I didn't have pineapple juice.  It was an easy dish to make. I will make it again.

This was one of the few times that I followed a recipe with the exact proportions listed, and I was slightly disappointed. I'm giving it four stars based on the modifications I made the second time around. For a two serving meal, I used 4 T whiskey,   2 T brown sugar, 1/2 t garlic powder and 1/2 C of pineapple. I added 1 T of corn starch, dissolved in chicken broth, towards the end (this thickened it up nicely). After simmering for 15 minutes, I put it in the oven and broiled for about 5 minutes. Perfect! I will most definitely make it again.

So this right off the bat was delicious though i did end up adding a couple of things to suit mine and my husbands personal taste.  To start with I used 1/4cup of Clover honey instead of pineapple juice because I didn't want to go to the store and i used a low sodium soy sauce. I only used one chicken breast but added a cup of broccoli, a cup of carrots and some yellow onion which i threw into the pan when i was cooking the chicken. In the sauce I ended up using Jack Daniels as my whiskey  and i added some cayenne pepper for bite and some smoked paprika for  just a bit of smokiness. I stirred in one teaspoon of all purpose flour at the end to thicken the sauce just a bit. Overall it was delicious. Will deffo make again.

I made this meal almost exactly as described. I did use chicken thigh instead of breast, but that's the only tweaked ingredient. I also did have to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce as even after 20 minutes it was still mostly liquid.

It was amazing though, and is quickly one of my new favorite meals.

Super easy, but I think next time I'll marinade it instead of letting it simmer. The flavor was excellent, but somewhat chewy due to letting it cook in the sauce like that. Just IMHO.

This was slamming!  I cut back slightly on the whiskey and sprinkled a little more brown sugar in the sauce. The wife is now telling all her friends about the dinner I made. I'm sure the requests for the recipe will be coming soon. Great recipe and thank you for sharing JLLYBEAN24!!

excellent tasting recipe. I did it exactly as listed, but let it cook until the sauce was thick enough to cling to the bottom of a spoon.  Served over white rice, it was delish.  4 stars because I believe some more flavor would make it over the top.

Love, Love, LOVE this recipe.  I only tweaked it a little. I like one dish, whole meals very easy for a busy family of six. I added fresh broccoli, stem included along with chunks of pineapple. I also did not add the heads of the broccoli until the stems had had a chance to soften. Cook up pasta, your favorite, separate and add right before serving. There are never any leftovers.

We liked it but my sauce did not thicken at all. I should have read of couple of the reviews first before making this cause the sauce was like a soup and the chicken looks nothing the picture. I am going to add corn starch and cut down the pineapple juice next time.

This recipe was very good. I was looking to make something different with chicken breast and definitely found a great recipe to add to one of my regular dishes. I did add double the sugar and replaced the pepper with red cayenne pepper that gave it a nice bit of heat with the sweet, delicious!! =Patti from NJ

Thank you for the recipe, my wife loved it. I added green, yellow, and red peppers for colour, some onion, pineapple chunks, and doubled the brown sugar. Delicious.

Was good, but not great.  Will try again.  I was expecting the sauce to be more of a glaze and it was not...We did eat it all including the leftovers, but it needs something.

This recipe was edible (or at least for myself and my daughter), but that's about as good as it got. My husband hated it. I wish I had read all of the reviews before I made it. I'm not sure if I'm going to try it again. There are so many changes we would make to it that it wouldn't even be close to the original recipe. I'm not sure this is worth the time.

Very tasty; a flavorful and easy meal.  I did not find the amount of whiskey to be overpowering, though I could taste it in there. (Which is the point - otherwise, why bother?) I did use cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and like some other reviewers I felt that it didn't smell very good while cooking. It was yummy though and smelled good once it was finished and served over brown rice.

Sauce never thickened up, it smelled bad when cooking and was barely edible even when served with rice as someone else suggested would improve the taste.

Yummm... my family loved it! The only ingredient I left out was the whiskey because we didn't have any, but even without it I liked the flavor. Sort of sweet and savory! This is actually the closest I have come to the sesame chicken recipe at our local restaurant. I cut up the meat into thin strips cooked them in canola oil because I didn't have olive oil. Added the sauce a few mintues after the chicken. I also used about a teaspoon of cornstarch. Served it with Chinese Mie noodles and sugar snap peas!! Next time I'm going to use the whiskey and add more cornstarch because I like the sauce to really stick to the chicken.

We took suggestions of other reviewers & added 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1tsp. fresh ground ginger & a shake(or 2)of LA Gold (hot sauce). We also sautéed 1 sliced onion along w/ the chicken pieces.  All of the above, we highly recommend.  We steamed fresh carrots, broccoli & mushrooms & added to the sauce.  I think this was a mistake as it watered down the flavor of the sauce.  Next time, we’d serve over basmati rice (again), add the steamed vegetables & THEN the chicken w/ sauce mixture.
