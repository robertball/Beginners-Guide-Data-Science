I made this tonight as a side dish to go with chicken pot pie and it was pretty good.  I did skip the first step of salting the cabbage though and just omitted salt from the dish entirely (salt draws out moisture from the cabbage and then if it sits too long, the dressing becomes watery).  I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for 3 people and followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I added about 1 tbsp of honey to the dressing mixture.  The end result was a very interesting tasting coleslaw and we will likely make it again.

Hooray! This recipe is a keeper! I used half a medium cabbage, sliced fine, in place of the coleslaw mix and red cabbage. I kept everything else the same and my  2yr old gobbled up a half cup of the mix before it hit the table. It's perfect; sweet, tangy, crunchy and HEALTHY! Thank you, Carolyn!

I LOVED this recipe.  I am not afraid of fat, so used full fat mayo and sour cream and couldn't have been happier with the outcome.  The nice tang of the apples was a real bonus to plain old slaw.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Easy and sweet with no extra honey. Didn't have shredded coleslaw or celery seed and it was still delicious.

Too easy to be so tasty & health-conscious! I made a couple substitutions due to necessity/curiosity. I only had about 1/4 cup mayo, so I added a 1/4 c thousand island dressing. It seemed a little bitter, so I squeezed/squoze in some honey -- but that was b4 it set up and flavors melded. I wondered about salting the slaw -- thought maybe it was to maintain crispness and color. I need low-sodium, so I will omit this step next time. And there WILL BE a next time! Thanks, Carolyn!

Wilting the cabbage is a good idea, but I couldn't get enough of the salt out.

I also skipped the salt like a previous reviewer and substituted dill for the celery because I didn't have any. I like a sweeter coleslaw and am trying to cut back on refined sugar so this recipe was perfect!
