I made the recipe as written and this was super fun! I do not care for cornbread but made this for my husband. I did take a nibble but left the verdict up to the husband. I didn't care for the corn but he liked it. The one thing we agreed on is that it could use a tad bit more sugar. Other than that, this was perfect! These are super fun and make a wonderful presentation.

This is an excellent savory waffle recipe.  I did mix all the ingredients together and then fold in the egg whites instead of starting with the whites because that's how I think waffles are made.  I used my waffle bowl maker and served a waffle bowl buffet with bacon, chicken, cheese, etc.  Delicious!
