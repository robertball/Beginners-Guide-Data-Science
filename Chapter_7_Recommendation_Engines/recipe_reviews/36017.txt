I had this dessert recently in England and it was delicious so thanks Clinton for posting it.  Because I'm on Weight Watchers, I changed the recipe by using 6 cups of mixed berries, and 1/2 cup Splenda in place of the sugar.  It also took 7 slices of bread.  I used a slotted spoon to remove the berries from the pot into the bowl and then saved the reserved juice to pour over top of the pudding before adding a tablespoon of fresh whipped cream.

This is very odd looking when set and turned onto plate, yet sooooo wonderful, a real taste treat. I realized too late that the reason for a weight on top was to encourage the top slice of bread to soak up juice, and my weight (a small plate) was not heavy enough. Oh well, juast a speed bump on the road to a heavenly dessert.

This is great.  I used a mixture of fresh raspberries, blackberries, red currants, blueberries and strawberries. The sugar content may seem large, however it is used to give the fruit a jam like consistancy and helps the desert set up.  If you are not wanting to use as much sugar, substitute some of the sugar with gelatine or vegetarian equivalent (follow the packet directions), remembering that you will need to add some water as the sugar does provide some liquid once disolved.

Easy to make and uses ingredients that most people have around the house, with the exception of the fresh raspberries.  I used frozen raspberries, which I think created too much juice.  Also, the amount of sugar seems high, especially if served with sweetened whipped cream.  But all in all an easy and delicious recipe.  I had to dig into it before it was done because I couldn't wait any longer to try some!  I haven't even dumped it out of the bowl yet, so I don't know what it will look like.

I was a little hesitant about the slices of bread but this was very tasty and really easy to do.

I used buttercrust homestyle white bread  from the bakery (the best white bread ever IMO) and refrigerated the pudding overnight weighted down with two cans of veggies.  I trimmed the crust off of the bread for appearance sake, so I added an extra slice of bread to compensate for that.  There was a lot of raspberry juice puddling on the top, and the pudding did not release from the bowl when inverted.  I'm not sure how this pudding should be presented, but I was hopeful that I'd be able to slice it.  However, the only option I had was to spoon it into a dessert dish.  I think the excessive juice affected the appearance of the dessert, and I will reduce the sugar to 1 cup next time to see if that helps.  Perhaps just draining off a little of the juice before pouring it into the bread shell might help as well.  Unusual recipe with an incredibly intense and sweet fresh raspberry flavor.  In spite of not being able to unmold it, it was fabulous (and easy, too)!

I also used whole wheat bread (it was fresh ground, whole wheat bread that was a bit crusty).  WOW,it was delicious!  I could not stop eating it, and even my kids gobbled it up.  Easy, delicious, and mostly healthy, this recipe is a keeper!

I didn't have fresh raspberries, so I used 1 1/2 cups of strawberries and 2 banana's with whole wheat bread instead of white then added a little cinnamon.  Everyone LOVED this. Reminds me of bread pudding

I love this pudding!!! So easy to prepare but so fresh and original. I lived in England for a long time and I know they use black currants, red currants and raspberries to make it. I used raspberries, black berries and strawberries instead. It was delicious and the shape of the pudding came out  perfect.

This was very easy to make and set perfectly. The flavor was all right, but it did essentially taste of berries, sugar, and bread. Serving with vanilla ice cream or some sort of cream is a must, to cut the sugary sweetness.

My husband is not a dessert eater, but this is the one dessert (other than my tiramisu) that he requests and loves! The first time we had this was at our best friends' house. They lived in England for many years, and she treated us to this authentic English dessert. I scaled this down to 2 servings and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup (instead of 1 cup for 2 servings). I made these in (2) Corelle ramekin bowls (I think they are 8 oz), lining the bowls with plastic wrap before lining them with the bread. This makes inverting them onto a serving plate much easier, as you just need to pull a bit on the plastic wrap to get the pudding to release from the bowl. They turned out perfect! We shared one for dessert tonight, and have one left for tomorrow night. Thanks for sharing this delicious, unique, recipe!

I've had summer pudding in Britain and loved it, but this was not very popular at my house. It was way too sweet and I had to make extra raspberry sauce to have enough. Luckily I was using raspberries from my garden, so I had access to more. Won't make this again.

My granddaughters and I are trying different recipes with black raspberries since mine are producing while they are visiting. This recipe was so easy! The 12 year old made it by herself and it was delicious! They called it a bowl full of awesomeness!

This was a little too sweet for our taste.
