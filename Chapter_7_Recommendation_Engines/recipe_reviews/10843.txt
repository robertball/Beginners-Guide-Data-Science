Since I gave sweets up for Lent I couldn't try these so I have to go by hubby saying they were good but they were "missing something." He's a big peanut butter/chocolate fan so I guess there just wasn't a "wow factor" here.

These are too good!! I've made these twice. They are easy different and totally delicious. Everyone I've served them to agrees. I use pecans in place of walnuts. I use mini peanut butter cup baking pieces (find next to regular baking chips) and obviously don't chop them. I fold half the bag in with the nuts and press the rest on top as the recipe says. The drizzle is just extra yummy-ness! But I only use 1/2 cup chips 1 T. butter and 2 T. peanut butter for the drizzle and it is plenty. These bars are awesome thanks for the recipe!

We loved this PB Bar!! The only thing I had a little trouble with was the baking time. I baked it 23 minutes and when I went to slice it they were VERY mushy. I put them back in the oven frosting and all for an additional 10 minutes. Who knows it might have just been my oven. We still ate the whole pan in a day and a half!

Absolutely wonderful! The outsides were a little cakeish for me but the middle's were TO DIE FOR! Definitely do not overcook.

Yum. I was in a hurry so I pressed the Reese's cups into the batter whole without halving them as the recipe says. I also frosted the bars hot then let them cool with the frosting on. They turned out great! Hard to stop eating them! I was careful not to overbake them after reading these reviews and took them out with the edges light brown.

Both my husband and I thought these were very good. I thought that the chocolate chip topping could be reduced or even left off but he liked it just as written. Since I didn't have a full bag of peanut butter cups (Easter candy left-overs) I made just a half batch in an 8x8" pan and ended up baking a good 10 minutes longer than called for since they were still jiggly at 25 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very very good. Quite easy to make also. I did not put chocolate on top though - they were sweet enough without it. Will make again and again!

Amazing! I omitted the walnuts (not a big nuts in baked goods fan) and jammed in as many peanut butter cups as possible. The first time I cooked it for the minimum reccomended time and the centre was not completely cooked. Since then I have cooked it for an extra 5 minutes until it is golden brown.

Not peanutbuttery enough for me. They were thin and needed longer to cook than recipe stated. Sorry - nothing special.

I dont know what i was thinking but i completely forgot to top these with the chocolate. I didnt even realize it until i was posting the pic.(I must be tired)The reeses cups is what made these bars good. Without it i dont think it would be that great.A lil on the crumbly side. i think this "bar" should have a crust of some sort like the other bar recipes i have made. This is more like a cross between a cookie and a brownie.

These are really great. Our friends have a little boy and he is very shy and will hardly ever talk to me. I took these to their house for a get together and within about 30 minutes he was sitting on my lap and saying "Auntie can I have another cupcake?" The big "kids" enjoyed them too.

These bars are one of the best cookie recipes ever. If your sweet tooth isn't very big than beware they are incredibly sweet. If you don't have peanut butter cups on hand it honestly doesn't matter because they are amazing even without them.

I made these because I was tired of looking at the miniature peanut butter cups in the cupboard. At first I thought it was too many peanut butter cups but the batter puffs up around the cups nicely. Good and easy. I used three egg whites instead of two eggs and I didn't even bother to put the chocolate on the top.
