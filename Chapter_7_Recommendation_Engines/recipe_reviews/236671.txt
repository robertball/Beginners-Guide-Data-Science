This is not worth making.  There is no sauce to it.  Veggies tasted great, but did not enhance the  pasta at all.

I thought this a strange combination but thought would give it a try! the sprouts had gone off so substituted them for peas.
I roasted the veg, which probably gave it more flavour.
it was ok but it didn't have the wow factor, may experiment with it for a bit more flavour as was rather bland

Solid Fall flavors. For the last few minutes I did crank the heat all the way up, but that's only because I like a hearty sear of brown on my veggies. Added in a little fresh thyme with the parsley as well. Had to add in a bit of butter to final dish because it was a tad dry. Great way to use up the Brussels sprouts I got on sale at my local farm stand. Made some roasted sweet potatoes with cinnamon and honey as a side. :)

Based on the comments, I added pasta sauce, and it was great!
