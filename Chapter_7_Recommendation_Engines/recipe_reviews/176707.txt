I made this for a Christmas get-together and it was gone in no time, with request for the recipe. After browning the sausage I did transfer it to a slow cooker on low a few hours before the party, I think it helped all the flavors blend well. It wasn't hot enough for me with just the 2 dashes of hot sauce so I added about 6-8 dashes and it was awesome. This recipe is a keeper for the perfect appetizer for parties.

Excellent! My MIL taught me 20 years ago to make a very basic version of this (just kielbasa and bbq sauce and some tabasco) which I have wowed crowds with in the past. This recipe takes a good thing and makes it even better. Bringing it to work tomorrow for a pot luck.  Thank you abrusky, for an easy, spicy, hearty delight of a recipe.

I only used half a sausage so I cut the rest of the ingredients to fit that. My brother ate this as his midnight snack, he said he liked it and asked me to make it again.

Only problem with this recipe?  Not enough!  Quite the hit at a recent potluck.  I toned down the heat just a little for that, but as is, this is excellent.  Second time I made it, I didn't have maraschino's or grape jelly, but I did have cherry jelly and chopped up a handful of fresh cherries.  (Cmon.  I live in Washington.  People look at you suspiciously if you buy maraschino's...) Just as savory sweet.  Also very good with meatballs, and there's actually enough sauce to handle the 2 pounds of Kielbasa and a couple dozen meatballs as an appy.  With just the kielbasa, this would be a great meal over rice with a fresh salad on the side.  Thanks, abrusky!

This recipe was such a big hit with my family. I made it last night and they LOVED IT! Now the only thing I did that was a little different was that I used about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and caramelized the pineapple, then added the BBQ and other ingredients to the pineapple, simmered sauce and then added it to the Kielbasa that I had started to cook in a larger frying pan.... Was sweet yet the after effects you could feel the Heat, served over white rice and was a homerun with family, Thank You for the Recipe

I scaled this way down because I only had a small piece of kielbasa that I wanted to use up and enjoyed this as a light supper with brown rice. For the BBQ sauce, I used 'A Very Popular BBQ Sauce' from this site. I also used one of those individual cups of pineapple tidbits that come in the 4-pk. I opted not to use the cherries at this time. I can see how this would be a hit to serve for a crowd, using a crockpot. Very nice recipe!

Delicious, quick and easy dinner.  I had fresh pineapple, so I used that in place of the canned.  Otherwise, I followed the stovetop instructions and it thickened up nicely.  Served this over sticky rice and added a simple green salad.  We enjoyed a nice dinner.

FAB-U-LOUS!  I browned the sausage on the stove first, cut the cherries in half and caramelized the pineapple in brown sugar. I added on large clove of garlic, minced and one small onion, sliced. Only put in 1 tsp of red pepper and it was perfect and still very much heat. I put everything in the crock pot on low all day. Serve over rice.

As is the recipe is a 4-4.5/5 but with your own tweaks it could definitely be a 5/5! As far as meat appetizers are concerned, this is a go to recipe for me - much better than cocktail meatballs. My recommendation is to reduce the amount of sauce, make the day before and let simmer in a crockpot for a few hours before serving. Yum!

I made this for dinner last night and the family LOVED it! The combination of sweet and spicy is fantastic. I only used one Kielbasa sausage and cut the recipe in half, but next time I will definitely make the full recipe because everyone wanted more! I served it over rice. Delicious!

Only thing I did differently from the recipe as written was that I included the juice from the canned pineapple instead of discarding it, and cooked it for a few hours in a slow cooker on low as another reviewer suggested. The result was a confusing mix of flavours that really didn't taste like they should have gone together (and I'm usually one who appreciates savoury-sweet dishes). I feel that adding a bit of cornstarch with water could have helped the sauce be more substantial, but it wouldn't have saved the dish. It's edible but that's about all I can say for it.
I'll finish the leftovers because I can't stand to waste that much food, but I definitely won't be making this again.

Easily the most delicious way to enjoy kielbasa. Made it for church lunch once. A few found it too spicy but everyone else loved it. Since then my family has had it many times- I don't think we will ever go back to plain old kielbasa and sauerkraut ever again.

I'm going to try this with chili sauce instead of BBQ sauce and a little brown sugar. I'm trying it first without browning the kielbasa. Thank you for this recipe!

I made a half batch as a trial run before a holiday pot luck figuring I'd add it to the final if I liked it. I kept tasting, and tasting, and before I knew it, it was gone! The second batch, I used half ketchup and half bbq sauce and thought that was less cloying. Also used fresh pineapple chunks instead of canned. YUM!

Took it to work & very few liked or even tried it. My guess was the texture & knowing the odd combo of ingredients.  If the cherries & pineapple had been chopped fine, I think it would've been better accepted as the flavor was ok.  Those of us that did try it liked the meat but thought the whole cherries were strange. I'm still eating the leftovers two days later and next time I will go back to my old hot weenie recipie that they all love.
