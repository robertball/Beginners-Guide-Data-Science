This recipe turned out really nice for me. I only made half the recipe though and got 9 buns in an 8x8 sized pan. I used my candy thermometer to measure the water temperature for proofing the yeast and since my yeast was a couple weeks past the "use by" date I decided to throw in some baking powder for good measure. I have to agree with other reviewers about the dough being hard to cut in the pan but it came apart easily after baking. I brushed some butter on the top of it and the bread was pillow soft. When I tasted the bread, it sure does lack any sort of flavour but with a little cinnamon honey butter it was so good and really does melt in your mouth. I stored my rolls in an airtight container in the fridge overnight and they were still quite soft this morning. After I toasted it up and spread some butter into it, I thought it might have lost that melt in your mouth goodness because it definitely wasn't still soft to the touch after toasting. Boy was I wrong. These are some good rolls. I would like to think the baking powder made a difference because my yeast had proofed just fine from what I noticed.

Because of reading reviewers' "lack of flavor" comments, I changed only one thing: instead of 1 tsp. salt, I put in 1-1/2 tsp. salt. A good basic bread roll. I put most of the dough into an 8x8 inch square pan. Prior to doing that, I buttered a wax paper rectangle that fit in pan, then removed paper & dough so that I could easily cut 9 squares with a buttered knife. The bread was tasty & soft for several days. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I have made & had many better breads. ~~ To see what the dough was like, I also tried a dough ball as a roll (rather dry from too much surface area), and a small pizza that I partially pre-baked. The pizza was good if you like soft, bready crusts. (I prefer thick chewy crusts with a crisp exterior on the pizza's edge.)

Cutting the dough in the pan was a pain, I used a very sharp knife that is new so I know it was not that. I would suggest that if you make this you just separate into individual rolls. They dried out very quickly and lacked flavor. No one finished a whole roll and my family usually will eat bread very quickly and I rarely have any leftover.

made the dough for this in my bread machine, than rolled out made rolls, let rise again and baked in the oven.  They were very soft but lacked a little in flavor for me, I think they would be good with honey butter on them.

I thought that these were pretty good, but like Rae thought cutting the dough was sort of a pain & next time will just form into rolls.  My mother & I both commented that this dough would be excellent as pizza crust.

My family loved the Virginia Box Bread. After reading a few other reviews I divided my rolls up into balls instead of cutting in the pan. Worked wonderful. We ate these plain. With honey and butter, and with chicken salad. Between basically my husband and I we ate the whole pan in a day. (Lunch and Dinner and Dessert.) I am not a bread maker and these were so easy. I used my breadmaker dough setting to make the rolls. These will be made again, and again.

These are delicious! I made these as instructed with no changes except a dash of black pepper & switched out 1/4c.AP flour for 1/4c. whole wheat flour. I had no trouble cutting mine in the pan as I used a glass baking pan & a steak knife to cut with (serrated edge). I like to use buttermilk powder where recipes call for buttermilk and I think I will use that in this recipe in the future for a flavor boost; the flavor is great to me right now, plain, and hot; but later in the day they will require butter, I can tell. I think buttermilk powder will remedy the need to use additional butter on the reheated rolls even. Thanks much for a delicious recipe, this is almost surely the easiest roll recipe I've used yet, although I confess I usually don't  make recipes that have me kneading dough with raw eggs in it as I'm squeamish. I'm making an exception for these :)

I don't make much bread, and I was really looking forward to this one, thinking it might have an egg-y taste, which I like in bread. It was disappointing. It needed more rise time than the recipe said (although it was a cold day here in Wisconsin so that's probably why) and it just didn't have much flavor. The process was nice and simple, so I might play with the flavor side - but I'll probably just keep looking.
