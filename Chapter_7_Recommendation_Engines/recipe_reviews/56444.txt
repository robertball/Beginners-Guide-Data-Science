Super easy, really tasty. Takes the pressure off pulling together a punch. Will definitely make again.

I thought this punch was great...as a person who needs to watch sugar intake I used diet sprite and raspberry sherbert and I didn't have a big spike in my blood sugar after having a small amount. Usually I can't drink punch. It WAS super easy to make and tasted great. I made it for my parent's 50th anniversary party and it was gone by end of the party!

We made this for my daughter's 4th birthday party and it was so easy and so good!  Everyone loved it and she loved that it was pink.  We did use strawberry sherbert instead of the raspberry, because thats what my daughter wanted!  Will definitley make this recipe again!!!  Maybe for my son's party next month we will use blue raspberry or something like that!

I make this every year for my student's recital. I use raspberry sherbet and cranberry ginger ale. It's a beautiful color, delicious and refreshing.

everyone has to have this at their babyshower or at a babyshower you host.  it's just good manners.  make an ice ring out of hawaiian punch or cranberry juice,just to jazz it up.  i've also used rainbow sherbert and ginger ale.  then add vodka to the leftovers after the mommy leaves.  now THAT'S a party.

This is so easy to make and so yummy!  This is a great punch for kids but at the party I brought this to, it ended up being drank by the adults as well...with a shot of vodka added.  It was very tasty and a big hit.  Highly recommend!  Thanks for the simple recipe.

Great, used raspberry sherbert and Sprite Zero for my daughter's 5th birthday and the girls all loved it.  I made an ice ring from fruit punch too.

I made this punch exactly according to the recipe. Sorbet makes a thinner, less intense tasting punch than raspberry sherbet does. It's also more expensive than sherbet. While it was good, I do prefer the taste of sherbet.

This is great with any sorbet. I use lime sorbet and the lemon lime soda and make "Hulk Punch".

I had to change out the raspberry for orange because it was a boy's birthday party, but it was so yummy and every last bit was drank. I garnished it with oranges and it was so amazing looking!

All of my guests and I truly enjoyed this punch. Make sure to pour the carbonated beverage glacially slow so it doesn't foam right up (as mind did). I would suggest after pouring about ?, break up the sorbet with the back of your largest spoon as best you can before pouring the rest in. I couldn't find just raspberry sorbet so I used raspberry, blueberry and blackberry sorbet. I also added an ice ring made with cranberry/raspberry juice, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and fresh mint leaves and added some berries to the punch itself as well. It was spectacular! Thank you for such a simple yet awesome recipe!

I made it for a 50 and older group Christmas party today and the people loved it! I used raspberry sherbet and generic lemon lime soda. So easy to make this. I will use it again when I make punch.

I made no changes to the recipe. Punch was great. Not sweet at all. No one believed it was just sorbet and Sprite Zero!

I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was great and so easy.  It was even a hit with the adults at the party. Thank you!
