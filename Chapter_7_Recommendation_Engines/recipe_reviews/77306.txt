This is a fairly good recipe, but it can be better. I find that the resulting truffles are too sweet. I prefer to use heavy cream (brought to a boil) instead of the sweetened condensed milk--this will give it that "melt-in-your-mouth" texture. I also use chopped Valrhona chocolates (milk or dark, depending on the flavoring) rather than chocolate chips--you want to go with the very best chocolate that you can afford, especially with gifts. Some flavor combinations to try: candied ginger (ground to a powder) and saffron, amaretto, kahlua and espresso powder, bailey's irish cream or rum, green tea (steeped in the cream during boiling time), or peach schnapps and orange zest. The possibilities are endless! I prefer to roll these in a dark chocolate coating, than topped off by a sprinkle of cocoa powder. powdered sugar or crushed nuts also work well.

This recipe is very simple & results in a delicately textured, creamy, rich and decadent truffle. The only reason I gave this 4* instead of 5* is that chilling resulted in the truffle mixture being so rock hard I couldn't roll it. Instead, I suggest leaving the truffle mixture on your counter for an hour or so, until the mixture is firm enough to handle, then perhaps put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  Your hands will melt the truffle mix a little when you roll it, but that's ok -- you want it to be a little moist so that the coating ingredients will stick. I left some plain chocolate, used butter flavoring with some and rum flavoring with others.  Rolled them in crushed pecans, almonds, walnuts, chocolate jimmies, crushed vanilla wafers, powdered sugar, coconut & cocoa.  These store well & can be frozen too.  Great gift for the holidays and parties.

These truffles will be as good as the chocolate chips you use, so use a good brand like Ghiradelli!  I make these all of the time, and everyone always asks me to make them again.  I also roll them in chili powder (without onion/garlic) and that creates a rich, dark flavor.  I have also found that letting them sit out until the mixture is ready to be rolled is sometimes more effective than chilling - chilling can make everything too cold and hard.

This is simply the BEST truffle recipe out there! It is certainly the easiest too! But be sure to "Whip" the flavorings in or else the chocolate will take on a "broken" or grainy and oily look. Once you whip more air into it it will pull together just fine. I would recommend this for anyone of any culinary expertise. Do remember that chocolate likes it slow and low as not to be scorched and constantly stir. Have some friends over and make it a party with different toppings stations!

these were so yummy I just made these and they were so easy.The only trouble I had was with the cooloing process I didn't freeze them I left them on the counter for a little bit then put them in the refridgerator they were kind of hard to scrape out of the pan so my next batch I am going to pour the mixture in a glob on wax paper then leave on counter that way it's not stuck on the pan.

A very easy AND very, very tasty chocolate truffles recipe! I used bourbon with finely chopped and toasted pecans. My favorite, so far, is orange flavored which I used triple sec liquer, coated with cocoa powder. Great idea from another reviewer to freeze these.  I'm giving that a try so I have them on hand for the upcoming holiday.  I look forward to trying other flavor variations.  These are gift-worthy treats.  *if mixture is too hard from chilling, leave out to warm to room temperature.  Your hands when rolling will melt chocolate well enough too, for coatings to adhere*

I usually don't make the brand recipes, preferring to go with reader submitted, but this was a great recipe! I had milk chocolate on hand that needed to be used, and I hoped that this would turn out okay. Well, I didn't have enough! I bake a lot and had some leftover semi-sweet and butterscotch chips. So, I used 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate, 1 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate, and 1/4 cup buttercotch. I used the standard "coatings" as well as dried blueberries, raisins, and cinammon. These truffles were wonderful! Every last one disapperaed at our party. The recipe was extremely easy, and I highly recommend this one.

This is my first time making truffles. I used semi-sweet chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips. They turned out great! I coated them with crushed nuts and powerdered sugar. They tasted wonderful. Next time, I would try different coatings, add peppermint extract instead of vanilla, and maybe use a little bit less condensed milk. (since the truffles were too sweet for me, but everyone else LOVED them)

These were wonderful and my daughters and I had so much fun making the Truffles.  My 6 yr. old daughter thought of taking crushed graham crackers and rolling the Truffles in it, what a wonderful idea.  The graham cracker version almost tasted like smores.  My daughters and I will surely make these again.  Thank-You for the recipe.

These truffles were extremely quick and easy to make. I made a double batch and took it to Advent Night at our church. It made for a fun activity as people were able to shape into balls and roll their truffles in their choice of toppings. I used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 dark chocolate for a deeper flavor.

This recipe is good and it was pretty much fool proof and so easy to do, only reason I am not giving 5 stars because the truffles weren't the "melt in your mouth" creamy truffles that I was hoping for, but they turned out nice and flavored them with orange, mint, and vanila and look nice too!

Soooo easy and yummy! But if you are going to add rum or any other kind of liquor you need to add more than 1 tbsp. I had to liquor up the second batch! I added 1/4 cup of rum to the batch.

I made these last night, I never used choc chips, I just used 10 oz of plain choc broken up into pieces then put in a bowl with the condensed milk and microwaved for couple minutes and stirred it, needed another min then I mixed smooth with an electric mixer after adding the vanilla. I rolled them in powdered sugar, cocoa, and sugar and cinnamon mix, the cinnamon went down very well. I bought small xmas boxes from the card shop that holds 12 truffles in two layers. I used petit fours cases (tiny cup cake cases) I will give a couple away in the boxes this xmas. People at work loved them and couldn't believe I made them.

This was super easy. I didn't want all my truffles to have the same flavor, so I poured half into a separate bowl. I mixed half with vanilla, the other half with 1/8 cup of rum and coated them with chopped pecans, powdered sugar, sprinkles, unsweetened cocoa and coconut. I'll keep a batch frozen at all times for quick gifts! Inexpensive, easy and tasty!

These were really rich. Too rich to enjoy them. I took the leftovers home from the office, melted them down with heavy whipping cream and stirred in crushed Thin Mint girl scout cookies. That was delicious. But this? I won't make it again...

Easy to make and very rich tasting. People will think you slaved all day! The only thing I would mention is to stir the mixture while it's firming because after two hours there was still some moisture in the bowl from the condensed milk. It really needs to be completely firm before rolling otherwise it's too wet. It can be a bit difficult to spoon the mixture out and  can be a little messy depending on what toppings you use. I had a wet paper towel on hand to clean off in between coatings!

I've used this recipe in the past, but I've found an even simpler recipe. Simply melt 8 squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate in the microwave, mix in a 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and stir in 8 oz. of thawed cool whip. Refrigerate this mixture, spoon out, and roll into balls (coating them with powdered sugar, sprinkles, cocoa powder, coconut, nuts, etc).

These are very easy to make and they made nice gifts.  I thought that they were a bit dry after a day or two so I suggest putting them in an air tight container right away. I used dark chocolate chips for a rich flavor. I rolled mine in nuts, powdered sugar, coconut, coco, chocolate flakes, YUM!

Sooooo easy and yummy.  I used almond extract (I love almond flavoring) and rolled them in toasted, chopped almonds.  Delicious!   We ate a lot of them, but I froze a bunch and then sealed them in Foodsaver Vacuum bags (single layers) and am keeping them in the freezer for a special occasion.  Will definitely make again, probably try with   amaretto or hazelnut liquor as a flavoring, or will try using mint chips.

I love these truffles. They are so easy to make. I roll my truffles a bit smaller and then sandwich them between two white chocolate wafers. You can get white chocolate wafers in all different colors, so it’s easy to match any occasion. I’ve even used white chocolate instead for the main ingredient and peppermint oil to taste instead of vanilla (just don’t go crazy with the peppermint oil because you don’t want too much mint) to make a mouth watering mint white chocolate truffle.

Super easy and a "can't fail" recipe. A little too sweet for me, but certainly worth making. Handy to have in the freezer--dip or coat when you're ready to use them. Seal well, chocolate absorbs other flavors very easily! This recipe scaled to one-third filled a quart freezer bag. A lot of truffles!

This recipe is great and so versatile!  I made milk chocolate, milk chocolate amaretto, and dark chocolate with orange liqueur.  I will definitely make these again.  It's fun to try the different variations then roll them in all kinds of things.  I used crushed hazelnuts, toasted coconut and granulated sugar.

A very easy recipe for delicious truffles.  I found them to be very sweet, but then, they're supposed to be that way.  Will try adding a little peanut butter for a variation the next time.  They are very soft so I recommend using a baller/scoop to make the balls, then put them in the fridge for a few minutes before the final shaping.  Enjoy!

this was perfect!  it's so simple, takes some time, but it's so worth it! i changed it a little by using milk chocolate and went further by melting semi-sweet chocolate(with 3/4 cup skim milk) and dipping them!  they are exactly like store bought, in fact they taste better than some kinds; and trust me i know, i eat a lot of chocolates!

Very easy and yummy. I did 1/2 the batch with mint extract and rolled those in crushed candy canes and the other 1/2 with rum (YUM) and coconut. I thought the batter for the mint 1/2 was a little dry and crumbly, but they came together fine and didn't taste gritty. However, after taking a suggestion from another review, I whipped the rum batter and it is sooo much smoother (thanks for the tip! :) ) Over all a great recipe.

Yummy!  I did read the other reviews that said these truffles were too sweet, so I used half semi-sweet and half bittersweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips.  These were perfect!  I rolled half in chocolate sprinkles and half in cocoa powder and these disappeared quickly!

These are wonderful! The only thing I will do next time is, 1) line a sheet pan with wax paper or foil so getting the batter out will be easier, and 2) will use a mellon baller to make the balls. I made the mistake of leaving the mixture in the sauce pain to set for 3 hours then had a heck of a time getting it out with a spoon and then as I rolled the balls, I had a lot of melted chocolate on my hands. Other than the lack of handling ease, these are wonderful. I rolled some of mine in powdered sugar, some in chopped pecans and some in unsweetened cocoa. I'm making these again tomorrow and this time I will try them rolled in coconut too. Some didn't care for the unsweetened cocoa, so I won't do that one again. This recipe was very easy to make otherwise and tastes great! Everyone loved them.

This recipe is fantastic and so easy. I use it for christmas and easter presents. I also added a handful of raisins and a teaspoon of rum essence to half a batch at easter, omitting the vanilla essence. This way is perfect if you happen to have friends who are pregnant. I'm in australia so I used 400g can condensed milk (skim so feel less guilty..).

This recipe could not be more simple to make. I think I may futz around with it a bit, though and perhaps halve the condensed milk and add some heavy cream. The truffles end up a bit too sweet for my taste ~  and maybe that's because I'm not the biggest fan of semi sweet. I may also try to mix in some milk chocolate chips. I do agree you should use the highest quality chocolate you can. I used Ghirardelli since I like it so much. I'm going to try a peanut butter version dipped in nuts also. We'll see how everyone else likes them tonight at my neighbor's solstice party.

So sweet and good. Any chocolate lover will love these. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet (personal preference). And I rolled in a variety of toppings - colored sugars, chocolate sprinkles, colored sprinkles, coconut, powdered sugar and nonpareils.

This was a fabulously easy and tasty recipe. The people I served it to were half-joking that I should make these to sell! I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, 2 cups unsweetened and 1 cup milk chocolate, rolled in either cocoa or powdered sugar since I was in a rush. I left the batter out for a bit before refrigerating it for 2 hours, which left it very hard. Microwaving for 1 minute softened it up just enough though. As I said, I was in a hurry, so I wound up putting the finished truffles in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes so they'd  harden fast enough. (I also had a ~30 minute travel time during which they could get back to room temperature, though.) I would definitely make these again.

We loved these.  Used different flavorings (liquors) and rolled in cocoa powder, chopped nuts, and conf. sugar.

GENERIC AT BEST – Served at a holiday party with two dozen chocoholics and ended up with a million of these suckers left over.  They paled in comparison to the smooth chocolaty Oreo Truffles next to them. The chunks tasted like they were microwaved, lacked a desirable texture, and dried out by the hour.   ~N~

So good!  I made mine with Kahlua and put one coffee bean on top of each truffle.  It was fantastic!  The bean added a nice crunch and great taste, plus it looked so fancy.

Really pulled my butt out of the fire with this one!  We make truffles every Thanksgiving and this year I lost my recipe.  This is our new recipe from now on!  We rolled the truffles in coconut and they were fabulous.

I made these with 8oz bitter chocolate, and 1oz semi sweet. And instead of vanilla I used Malibu. AWESOME! (I only had Malibu, Whiskey or Beer. SOOO happy I chose the Malibu!!) I rolled some in colored sprinkles and some in icing sugar. It woulda been even better if I had toasted coconut...but I didnt. I will try for sure! SOO great! I am going to make some with baileys now. Maybe crushed candy canes would be good!! I will let you know...

I had a blast making truffles!  I never thought I'd ever make candy, especially my favorite chocolate truffles, but here I am.  I love truffles but they are so expensive that I only get them on very special occasions.  That's over now.  These are delicious and so easy to make.  I made three batches!  One with white chocolate chips and vanilla extract, one with semi-sweet chocolate chips and almond extract, and one with butterscotch chips!  I am using these as last minute Christmas gifts.  Thanks a million for the wonderful recipe.

Very good. The hardened chocolate softens in your hands while rolling it into balls. This makes for easier coating (cocoa coating went on easiest). I made the rum variation. The rum flavouring was a little strong for my mom, but she said the truffles were still really good. Warning: Do no eat and drive.

These aren't gourmet, but they're awfully good and easy... and easy beats gourmet when you're a mother of 4 looking to make something good for your kids' teachers for Christmas. I rolled these (after cooling on counter and then refrigerating briefly) in coconut, cocoa powder, and crushes pistachios. I need to make a second batch (these didn't make 72--more like 55) and think I'll add a little chili powder next time and then roll in the cocoa powder. There are all sorts of ways to doctor this recipe. But in the meantime, sweet and simple does it.

Excellent, easy recipe. My 13 year old daughter made a batch (which yielded about the listed 6 dozen surprisingly enough), used a variety of coatings, and gave them away in decorative tins for the holidays. They were a hit!

Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly these truffles turned out fabulously!  I dind't have semi sweet chocolate chips so I used white almond bark as well as chocolate almond bark.  I also used half vanilla extract and half rum extract.  I was feeling lazy so I poured the melted chocolate into a baked pie shell.  Talk about yummy!  Next time I will make the truffles and roll them in differet toppings.

I have made these for years, but lost the recipe. Sooo easy and delicious. Use premium chocolate chips for the best flavor. I like them best rolled in unsweetened cocoa.

Easy recipe - good truffles (it's the same type of recipe as fudge - but still very good)!  I used some Amaretto for an extra kick of flavor.  I used 2 types of toppings - powdered sugar and red sugar - they looked festive and tasted great!

Very good but I don't know what the heck I did wrong.  I followed the directions exactly as written and I could not keep the truffles in a ball, they were too goopy.  However they tasted fantastic.  I used Irish Cream maybe that was the problem?

Very intresting. I liked the recipe. It was easier then most and used ingredients I had in my closets. I made orange truffles and coated them in tempered chocolate. 'Twas easier then I though which was nice. However I shall try my next batch with brandy. MMMM a nice chocolate treat.
