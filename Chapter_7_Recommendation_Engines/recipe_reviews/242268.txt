Great exactly as posted.  Made some changes the second time I made it based on my family's preferences.  Cooked bacon with onions & jalapeño with a little molasses to carmalize.  Also used a combination of cheddar, Colby, jack and cream cheese.  And put crushed potatoe chips on top.  Amazing!  My hubby is not a fan of Mac and cheese or gluten free but he went back for seconds!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe with a small exception; I used GF bread crumbs in the topping. I made it for our family Christmas lunch for my cousin who is gluten intolerant. I ate it as well and it was as good as our regular mac and cheese. This is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious. I did add MacLarens sharp cheese to the recipe to make up some of the cheese in the main dish and also some worchestershire sauce (1 1/2 tsp.) I will definitely make this again. Everyone loved it.

The cooking/prep time is accurate if you set out all of your ingredients. I used Barilla Gluten Free Elbows (the best GF pasta in my opinion).  Will definitely be making it again and may be adding bacon bits, onions, and tomatoes just to change it up. Still delicious as-is! Highly recommend.

Excellent, easy recipe for someone that used to make the boxed stuff most of the time. From scratch was too long and too much. I halved this recipe (as the main dish for two servings) and it was so easy! I made it in my cast iron skillet... melted the butter, added the salt (omitted the mustard powder) and per other reviewers I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups from the listed two cups (half of the recipe.) Added 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch to the milk, whisked and poured in the skillet. Took less than a minute for it to thicken, probably because the skillet was already hot. Added some onion powder and paprika and 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar (saving the other 1/2 for the top.) Sprinkled with just a little bit of paprika and put in the oven. Took less than 8 minutes to get ready to go in the oven and only 20 minutes to bake (convection) so super quick! Didn't use any toppings other than the cheese, but I plan on making this for Thanksgiving in a bigger stainless steel skillet and I will put the cheese in the middle and surround that with crushed plain potato chips. Sure to be a hit!

We have a family of six, so I multiplied the recipe times 1 1/2. It worked fine. I also used gluten free bread crumbs instead of the toast and omitted the mustard powder and paprika. The entire family loved it! You could not even tell it was gluten free. It was an easy and delicious  dish for all!!!

I would give it 4 1/2 stars if possible.  More the inexperience of the cook (me) than the recipe itself is why I can't give it another star.  Even with that it came out quite good - I was actually surprised.   I would make it again.

This recipe is a keeper!  I only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 was because it lacked a little creaminess.  I stirred in 4 oz of cream cheese and it was wonderful!!!!  Better than other recipes that use flour!  The whole dish was devoured!

This is a nice mac'n cheese.I opted for the bread crumb/paprika addition and am glad I did. It really sets it apart from the regular taste. I was worried about cooking the pasta first and then baking it knowing that GF pasta tends to turn to mush after overcooking. It didn't. It held up and was whole when I put my fork into it. I did cook it al dente though, this is an important step. I felt 190°C was too high though. I turned it down to 180°C about 5 minutes into the baking process and left it in for the thirty minutes. It was nice and crunchy on top and oozy-gooey in the middle. I wouldn't call this super easy though. It dirties up a lot of dishes and requires more work than what I consider super easy. It is quite tasty though so it is definitely worth the effort. Thank you kokodiablo for the recipe.

I was anxious making this for Christmas but I read some tips about gf pasta and the large amount of liquid seemed appropriate- so I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I used rotini gf elbows and I think I only cooked them 5 minutes. Topped the macaroni with shredded cheese and baked it- definitely a success.

After adding the cheese sauce to the pasta, I, too, found that there was way more sauce than needed.  Fortunately, my husband suggested I use a baster to siphon off the extra sauce, which I added to some pasta I had left over from chili I had made. 
 I added sautéed onion and well-drained, diced, fire roasted tomatoes to the mac and cheese and it was a huge hit at the potluck I brought it to.  I used Rotini corn and rice pasta and cooked it for 6 minutes instead of 8 and it held up beautifully through the baking process.

It was good, but needs to be creamier!  More milk is needed in the  recipe.

First time making this and made a half batch. It has good flavor but excepted it to be creamy and it was a little mushy. Next time I will cook the pasta al denta and a little less time in the oven. But the kids liked it so it is a keeper.

I made this for our youth group meal. Most of the group are very picky eaters, but this mac and cheese got rave reviews and seconds for most.  No one knew it was GF.  I made it as directed except used crushed potato chips in place of bread crumbs.

I've made is a couple times baked, but have since found the correct cheese to pasta proportion to eat is unbaked. Only make half the cheese sauce and cook the pasta fully.

Made this for my sister-in-law who's GF.  It was amazing!  I'll make this from now on, maybe not with GF pasta, since we eat gluten!  It was super, super easy.  I didn't have GF bread to make the crumbs, and it was fine without it.  Thank you!

I made it with penne and pre-made gluten-free breadcrumbs. It seemed a bit liquidy. If I make it again with penne, I'm going to use more noodles, and maybe more breadcrumbs on top. The addition of bacon bits and caramelized onions sounds like a great idea, too!

Very tasty and will serve as a good springboard for me to tweak. I think there was too much butter in the sauce, and will use less milk so that the bottom of the mac and cheese browns up a bit. Took way more than 5 minutes for the sauce to thicken. Overall, though, really good!!
