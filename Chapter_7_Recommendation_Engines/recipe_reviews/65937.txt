This is a wonderful recipe. 

By the way...Giving a recipe a bad review because it didn't instruct you to wear gloves while handling habaneros is like giving a bad review for not telling  you to wear oven mitts while removing a hot pan from the oven. It involves some level of common sense.

I thought these were really good.  I took them to a cookie exchange and while some of the ladies were fond of them, their husbands are the ones that raved about them.  Yes, they are pretty hot.  And, no, I am not going to take away stars because of a lack of glove language.  If so, I'd have to deduct stars from every recipe that involves a knife that doesn't remind me not to cut my fingers off!  Thanks.

We've got a ton of habaneros in the garden, so I thought this might be an interesting way to use them.  The taste reminded me of a bland sugar cookie with the flavor of a green pepper.  Not exactly what I'd hoped for. I was, however, glad to learn the milk trick to cooling down my peppers for use in other recipes.

GREAT cookies. My review of this recipe gets 2 stars, however, because it didn't warn readers to WEAR GLOVES or something protective while preparing the peppers. My hands burned for hours. I made the cookies yesterday evening, and this morning my hands still burn. The recipe was delicious, will definitely make it a again, but just wanted to give out a word of warning. USE GLOVES.

These cookies are a perfect combination of sweet & a slow hot after glow for your mouth!  They're addictive too!  I made them twice last week & will be making them again. Everybody wants the recipe!  I need to stress, like another reviewer, it's an absolute must to wear gloves to protect your skin from the Capsaicin, the irritant that makes the peppers hot.  It's also a good idea to ventilate your work area so not to breathe in the vapors.  Especially if you use the footnote suggestion on how to take some of the hot out of the peppers before using them.  The vapors are pretty wicked when you open the microwave door & also while rinseing them with warm water.  I followed this recipe exactly  & they were perfect each time.  The footnote says you can repeat the process with the milk if you like but I found that just one time was sufficient to take any overbearing heat out but left a perfect amount of burn effect!  My husband normally doesn't like anything hot but he loves these cookies!  He can't seem to get enough of them.  Thanks again for this keeper!

This is a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet!!! I was tempted to cut down on the habanero peppers but it was great according to the recipe!

I did not remove the heat - why use habs then? - and oh my gosh, that's a hot little recipe. Used 10 largish habaneros with seeds removed, and raw sugar, because that's what I had. Compellingly fiery and sweet. But holy tamoley, they've got a kick. Not for the faint of heart or stomach in their unaltered state.

Yep, they are hot.  I use the milk treatment twice, everyone loves them except my granddaughter, she thinks they are hot. HAHA  EVERYONE loves them.  This year they are making it to the cookie baskets per requests of friends.

I was very surprised. We used 4 very fine minced habaneros and did not soak them in the milk. They are very tasty and everyone who we shared these with loved them. You definitely feel the tingle at the back of the throat but for me it was not uncomfortable. Other people who do not do heat at all did not like that part but still liked the flavor of the cookie. To give you a marker my heat level is a mild to low medium. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made them exactly to the recipe.  They turned out great!  My family loved the taste.  Just the right combination of hot and sweet.  Don't breathe in the vapors from the habanero seeds and pulp, though, it's like tear gas!

I brought these to work, and the miners LOVED them! I made them last night, and I threw some diced dried mango into the mix, because.. duh. mango goes great with habanero! anyways, there are some other store bought cookies here, havent been touched! haha. I wanted to let everyone know that because of the high butter content (awesome) they do melt out a bit IF you spoon them onto a hot pan. Spoon the batter onto cool sheets, and they will stay nice and round through out the baking :)
I used the milk treatment on half of my peppers, and to be honest I won't next time.. they arent hot enough lol. They cool off a LOT after they are fully cooled. just fyi. great recipe!

These are addicting! I made them for my husband, not expecting to like them myself, and I have to say I love them. I didn't see any reason to use so many peppers and then take the heat back out with milk, so  I followed the advice of one reviewer and used 4 peppers finely minced and they are perfect. The heat is evenly distributed, and there aren't any little hot spots. The cookies don't taste like peppers. They are chewy, butter cookies with  a nice amount of Hananero heat. They didn't need it, but I added  chocolate cookie buttercream frosting from this site, and they are delicious.

Whew! These are the taste treat of the year!! Made them for my son's visit,as he likes HOT stuff. I don't even like cookies,but am afraid if he doesn't get here soon there will only be crumbs left. One problem- oven temperature, I had to set mine higher. These are a very moist fruity delicate cookie,sounds lady-like,but is no weak lady cookie!!! Love them!!!

Excellent Cookie!  I made the batter a day ahead and refrigerated it so it was firm.  I also keep it in the fridge when not scooping out cookies.  The only variation I made was to reduce the butter by half and supplement with margarine, I like the cookie texture with margarine - I used Smart Balance.  Per the supplemental instructions in the recipe, I soaked and rinsed the habaneros (once).  Be extremely careful, wear gloves, glasses and a mask or bandanna over your nose and mouth would not be a bad idea either.  I believe the baking temperature is incorrect at 325, my first batch took nearly 20 minutes, but that could have been because the dough was cold.  Subsequent batches worked great at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes (until lightly golden).

These are outstanding!  I used 7 Habanero peppers and did not do the milk bath. I wanted them to have some hotness but not be so hot that people only talked about the heat of the cookie rather than the taste.  I also put a chocolate frosting on top to add dimension and give different levels of taste. I will make these often!! Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

Yum. YUm. YUM!!!  I was a major skeptic, but was won over after one nibble!  I took a few down to my favorite watering hole and had a few guys actually "order" some - I have to make 8 dozen of these bad boys tomorrow!

I did not use the heat reducing method, mostly because you just don't do that to a habanero.  It's supposed to be hot.

The only critical remark that I have to make about the recipe is that my cookies took more like 15 minutes to bake.  Otherwise - perfection!!

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to rate these...the sugar cookie part is wonderful (though I added a bit extra vanilla and rolled in raw sugar) but the habanero part is just too much!  I doubled the recipe and used 15 habanero's instead of 20, I did the milk bath twice (thanks for that tip, very helpful).  I love the bites I get with the slow heat, but I get bites with the overpowering heat that just ruins it for me.  I minced the habanero's super fine too.  Its a fun idea and I was excited to try for a "fire" themed party :)  I'll see how they go over with everyone else.  I think they'd be 4 star with 1/2 or even 1/4 the amount of peppers.  I topped mine with a lime glaze in hopes the sour/sweet would help a bit with the heat...haha, tastes good but didn't help!  Be sure everyone knows what they are getting into when they eat one of these :)  OK - one day later and I took them to a class, they went over very well!!  I wish I could give this 3.5 stars - definitely worth trying if you are thinking about it!

Amazing! I only used seven habaneros because a few of mine were rather large. I also didn't do the milk bath...I wanted a little kick. With the seven habaneros I didn't find the cookies too spicy. It was a perfect "creep up on you" heat that dissipated shortly thereafter. I think I might use one or two more habaneros next time. Great recipe!

We used 4 small habaneros and the adults loved!  It made 32 cookies about 2.5" in diameter.  Too spicy for kids and we all love spicy!

While I love the concept of these (sweet w/a bite), I don't really care for the actual cookie base.  My cookies spread quite a bit and were quite flat.  I followed the recipe to a "T", with the exception of halving it when I didn't have 10 habaneros.  These are definately a nice something different and are absolutely worth trying.  If I make them again, I'll chill the dough and see if that helps eliminate the spreading/flat cookies.  I did the milk bath once and the resulting cookies had a nice bit, but I would not call them "hot".  THANKS for the recipe, RALEIGHL!

A little disapointed. I was expecting the habanero flavour to marry with the cookie, but instead, it just felt like little pieces of very spicy habanero inside a sweet cookie instead of choc. chips. It felt kind of weird and out of no where. No one who tried them thought they went well together, and we LOVE spicy! So that was not the issue. I used orange habaneros. I am still giving them four stars because the cookie part was nice.

I'm still fanning the flames after this. I did find myself altering the recipe a bit to purposefully leave out the step of antagonizing the pepper's heat (and therefore use fewer habaneros). It's also of note that you *must* wear gloves and maybe protect your face while handling the peppers. Capsaicin (the irritant that makes the peppers hot) can be extremely bothersome if you don't protect your hands!

I admit that I skipped the milk soaking step, but the cookies were really good!  I used 4 peppers instead of 10.  

The guys at work gave them good reviews, too.  The cookies were not as light as a regular sugar cookie, so next time I might just put the peppers into a regular sugar cookie recipe.  Even my 2 year old liked them!

This is a great recipe!  I was skeptical at first. Just trying to imagine hot peppers in cookies, but I'm so glad I gave it a try!  My Habanero bush is producing like crazy this year, so I'll definitely be making these again. I did not do the "pre-soak" and I'm glad I skipped it. Using my food processor to mince the peppers made it quick and easy. What a wonderful little "warm tang" you get from these. The full recipe yield was 40 cookies, and as another reviewer mentioned, the bake time @325F needed about 20 minutes to brown. I increased the temp. to 350F, and baked for 15 minutes. Perfection!

These were very good.  We have a habanero bush in our backyard (I live in AZ) and we get tons of peppers off of it.  I was looking for a way to use them and found this recipe.  The cookies are wonderfully buttery and have a slow heat on the back end.  I only moderately like spice and I thought they were delicious.  I soaked the peppers in milk to take some of the heat out, as others suggested.

I only had a few Habanero peppers and since it was Christmas, I threw in a few Jalapeños to give it the Green and Red color...   I also rolled the dough into sugar to coat it before baking....turned out great!!!

Sweet and Spicy :)  
I loved it and made a variety after reading the review...as is, with mangoes and pecans, with coconut, with chocolate chips and also with a chocolate drizzle.  I also used 1 c white and 1/2 c brown for variation.  When I added the other items, I cut down on the peppers and used 6-7; Idid the milk soak and they were perfect.  Surprisingly more people volunteered they loved peppers!

Definitely worth fiddling with. I made two batches - first, followed recipe to a tee but found they had no heat at all. Second, didn't do the milk bath at all and found they were too hot for my taste. Next time I will do the milk bath for about two minutes. Only other change is I think it needs some kind of glaze...possibly cayenne pepper glaze or sriracha glaze...

I made these for a few parties I had to go to over the holidays, just for something different.  I chickened out and used 5 peppers instead of the recommended 10.  I should've followed the recipe!  They were still awesome, and Everyone Loved them, however I was told several times they could use a bit more heat.  Definately will make again, and follow the recipe exactly!

I had so many habaneros come out of my garden this season I had to find something to do with them  all , this was it ! 
I followed the recipe and glad I  did not reduce the heat of the pepper. I was expecting a bit more heat but am happy with the final result

For a novice, these cookies were easy to make and tasted great. Stuck to the recipe exactly and the heat was actually mild and appeared as an afterthought. Don't let the name of the pepper scare you away.

Make sure you’re butter isn’t too soft, ie melted. Also make sure to refrigerate the dough for 15-20 min most so as not to be so thin.

I made these 2 weeks ago,  I did a double batch and used 31 very ripe peppers.... great flavor but not HOT enough.   Next time i'm going to add powdered ghost chilies to the flour on top of the fresh peppers.  That should light up my life!! 
The cookie itself read wonderful.   In going to do it with fresh vanilla bean,  toasted walnuts on one batchand toasted crushed almonds on the other batch.

I was looking for new Christmas cookie recipes and thought this looked interesting.  I made them today and they were delicious!!  I followed the recipe as written, removed the seeds and didn't put them in milk.  They weren't to hot and my husband who likes hot/spicy food thought they needed a few more peppers. I baked them in a convection oven at 350. The first batch 14-15 minutes and I thought they were too crispy. Since I like mine a little softer, I found 12 mins at 350 just right.  I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

I'll probably make these again. They are quite tasty! I did bump the oven to 350 degrees and cook for 12 minutes. Next time, I'll probably cut back the salt a touch as well.

made exactly as directed. Interesting flavor and a total throat punch of heat. Next time I'm going to finish them with pralined bacon bits. I think a bit of sweet & savory texture is all it's missing.

A strong 4.5 so I decided to round up. I only had 3 habaneros so I used a Scotch Bonnet and one red chili.  No milk bath and I was very pleased with the heat
Love the idea of putting chocolate on top so will try that next
As to all those sitting in judgement about wearing gloves, and how it is so obvious. There are a lot of new cooks who may never have worked with fresh peppers before so I see nothing wrong with suggesting a note being put at the bottom.

Made these as written for a group of fifteen people. The ones that liked the spice SAID they were good but I noticed nobody took more. I enjoyed the concept of the spicy cookie, but the execution was off for me. The overall flavor was a bland dough with green peppers chopped into it. I might try this recipe with a different pepper or adjustments to the cookie dough.

I doubled the recipe but only used fifteen peppers and the heat was very tame but still definitely noticeable. I would use more peppers and/or skip the milk bath for part of them. I added dried mango and chopped milk chocolate with almonds after the first tray as they were a little plain without but still very tasty. Doubled made more than fifty 2-3" cookies. Did need almost twenty minutes in a 350 degree oven. Would definitely make these again!

These are incredible, I didn't soak the habaneros in milk; but I did add white chocolate and macadamia nuts.  They are especially good for leaving unattended at work for those people that like to grab food without asking.

Family loved these even though they don't like spicy food.  Tastes like a plain sugar cookie and then your mouth/throat get eerily warm.  It is so odd!  Can't believe there are 10 habaneros in there.  I put mine in the food processor (didn't do the milk soak) and needed to cook them much longer.  Next time I'm going to up the oven temp to see if that helps.  Was my first time using habanaros and I was pretty nervous - great recipe!!

Had an allergic reaction to the Habanero. The cooked cookies left blisters on my fingers and removed top of mouth.  I liked the cookies, but will never be able to make them again.  I have no problems with other peppers (Serrano or Jalapeno).  Total surprise. Son-in-law loved them. Too hot for daughter.

These are basically sugar cookies with heat.  I really liked them ...  I gave them to friends for the holidays and they loved them.  I really suggest eating them with a glass of milk, because the heat is substantial. I didn't do the milk bath portion of the recipe, so they were pretty heat-in-mouth-and-throat-inducing which was was a double bonus for me as it kept me from devouring more than one in a sitting!

Absolute hit!!! Family loved them, even my 10 year old enjoyed them. Too some to the office and they were a hit there too. They have this warming heat to them. Not too intense. A great savory sweet combination.  I'll be making them again!

Thought they were awesome, a big hit with everyone that tried them. I altered it some, used organic sugar, butter and flower, lessened the peppers by half and added some dried cranberries & mangos and pecans. Turned out delicious. Happy to find another good recipe to use my habaneros. Thanks!

I love hot stuff and different stuff so this recipe apeeled to me in several ways.  I did milk bath the peppers once because I was planning on bringing these to work.  Once people got over their surprize these cookies vanished.  Later people told me they had even taken extra home for their families.

Very hot but they don't burn the mouth and lips like hot salsa does.  The cookies themselves were just ok tasting though. I don't think I softened the butter too much or added too much vanilla but my cookie dough was too moist and my cookies flat. My first batch was unusable as they stuck to my air-bake pan and crumbled when I tried to remove them.  I assumed that the amount of butter in the cookie would make them not stick. For my next batch I used a nonstick pan and they worked just fine.
The recipe should have a warning about using gloves as others have stated. I am accustomed to cooking with hot peppers but everyone who uses this website is at a different level of skill and experience. Recipes should include helpful tips and instructions on making food without incident so that we can all learn from each other rather than from our mistakes. If you take a good knife skills class you will learn how to cut and chop peppers without getting the hot on your hands. That said I still used gloves on this recipe just in case, mostly because I wear contacts and removing them with pepper juice on my hands is the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
Similarly, the footnote on removing heat from the peppers using milk should be in the recipe instructions as an optional step. I use the app on my iPad while I am cooking, and footnotes don't show up there so I had to go to the internet to read what it said. I wouldn't even have known it existed if I hadn't read the reviews.

Delicious recipe!  Made them and took them to work.  After coworkers got over initial surprise of peppers being in the cookies, I got great feedback.  They were a huge hit.

I saw this recipe after I found some overstock Habanero's at my local supermarket for cheap. I really didn't know what I was going to do with all these peppers till I ran across this recipe.  I also didn't know what to expect. I love them however I didn't use the "cool down method" and they were spicy.  A little too spicy for my wife..  But I loved them....

Yes!  everyone is so surpised when we make these cookies.  We have been making them for about 6 years now.  We also soak the peppers twice.  3 times is too much.  Love love love these cookies, but make sure to have a side of milk.
