This was great! To cut down the fat a little, I used 4 cups of half & half instead of 2 cups half & half, 2 cups heavy whipping cream. Thanks for the recipe.

This has amazing flavor. The consistency was a little too icy and very hard to scoop. I will have to experiment with this further to see if I can change that. Thanks for sharing a delicious ice cream!

This recipe was delicious! The brown sugar really gives it a richer flavor. I used whole milk instead of half and half, but I don't think it would have made a noticeable difference. Will definitely make it again!

YUMMY!!  I used 1 cup of 2% milk and 3 cups of heavy cream as I didn't have half-and-half.  My only other change was to use vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla extract.  This is as close to sticking to the recipe that I could get without running to the store.   I packaged it in a freezer container and presented it to my mother for Mother's Day along with a batch of homemade ice cream cones from this site.   She absolutely LOVED it!   How do I know it was good?  Don't tellâ€¦.I snuck a scoop!  I will be making this again soon.  Thank you Brandee for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!

Just a thought...try adding 2 cups International Delights Irish Cream and only 1/8 cup Irish cream liqueur. Of course sub out the Half-and-Half

This is hands down my new favorite ice cream! I used 3 cups of whipping cream and 1 cup of 2% milk and it turned out really well. Will definitely make this over and over in the future.

Make this a day ahead. It takes a while to set up with the alcohol in it. Huge hit as our (adult) dessert for st. patty's day!

This was great. I used 1.5 cups cream, 1.5 cups half and half, and 1 cup skim milk.  We also usually drink the mint chocolate Baileys, so we used that and added a dozen crushed Thin Mint (Girl Scout) cookies.  We loved it!  Also, we stored this in a freezer that typically makes most ice creams too hard, but for this ice cream it was the perfect texture.

Made this ice cream as one of several desserts on Easter Sunday.  Hands down everyone's favorite.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.  Add the chocolate chips after you put the ice cream in the freezer for about 20 minutes or the chips will just drop to the bottom of the container.

Delicious. Served it at a pool party and everybody raved. It needs to spend some time in the freezer to harden, so make it a day ahead.

Very yummy. The amount of alcohol in this keeps it from freezing as well as plain ice cream, but it is still very good. Be sure you don't add it until the end, as the recipe states. For that same reason, the leftover ice cream stays nicely scoop-able after days in the freezer. I might try this again with a reduced alcohol content by boiling down the Irish Cream by 1/3 or so. I think that might retain the flavor, but make it a  little firmer.

Excellent! I made this recipe exactly as stated, and it was wonderful! So rich and delicious, with the perfect texture of homemade ice cream! That's not even mentioning how easy this recipe was - I saw one other recipe that wanted me to reduce down the cream, etc, etc... this was much simpler!

Wow, this was so good.  I tried to eat it right out of the ice cream maker but it was too soupy.  But after it is frozen, it has awesome flavor!

WOW was this GOOD!!!  I made it for dessert for St. Patrick's day and everyone LOVED it!  Funny that the taste is even better at the bottom of the ice cream container.  I will definitely be making this again and not just for St. Patrick's Day.  I am going to try it with Bailey's Salted Caramel Irish cream.

This was a huge hit at a St. Patrick's Day  party. The day before I mixed all the ingredients together and put them in the stainless steel ice cream container and refrigerated it for several hours before churning it. This eliminated the longer preparation time due to the alcohol in the mix.  I will make this again !

It was very good and EASY.  It could have had more flavor with the vanilla bean thing, but that's more work.  No pans no mess. It will go great with my Guinness brownies tonight!!
