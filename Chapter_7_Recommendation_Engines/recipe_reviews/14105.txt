While reading the reviews I thought it was interesting that people either loved or hated this recipe. I thought it sounded good, but I also misread the recipe. In my head, I thought these beans went into the oven. When I realized my mistake, the recipe no longer appealed to me. I could see why the one reviewer said it tasted "sandy green beans". Maybe if the bread crumbs were sauteed in butter first and them sprinkled over the beans it would be better. I didn't use canned dry crumbs, but threw a couple of pieces of white bread into the food processor, along with fresh garlic and the cheese. I sprinkled the crumbs over the beans and poured melted butter over the dish. I put them in the oven for about twenty minutes and they came out very good. Kids and hubby loved them.

I made this on Thanksgiving - what a great alternative to green bean casserole!  I used a bag of steamed green beans to cut down on time and hassle.  I drizzled about a tablespoon or two of olive oil, no need for all that fat. The herbs and spices give it the flavor.

This was pretty tasty.  I'm not a vegetable fan so it was nice to find a vegetable recipe that didn't load up on fat and cheese.  BTW--I cut the oil back to about 1 T.  My husband and I enjoyed this so I'll make this again.

I fixed these for our “Italian” themed Christmas dinner.  They were a HUGE hit with everyone.  I blanched the beans and mixed everything together several hrs before I was to serve dinner.  Kept in the fridge then popped in the oven @ 350 for about 10-15 minutes.  I think since everything had time to set and mix together, I didn’t get that “crunchy” effect other people were experiencing.  Will definitely be making again!

As is I don't think this recipe would be great, so I gave it 3 stars.  Ten minutes is way too long for green beans, they'd turn to mush and there is too much olive oil and that wouldn't help with the mush factor either, so it's no wonder that people are complaining about the bread crumbs being soggy.  However I found this recipe to be easy to adjust & it turned out to be the best dish on our holiday table!  I steamed the green beans with some sliced garlic until they were just slightly under cooked.  Then in a saute pan I cooked 4 strips of diced bacon, and when they were almost brown I added some quartered mushroom and the herbs (I used fresh, but dry would still work great).  Instead of adding the olive oil, I sauted the steamed beans and garlic in the bacon mixture (which I hadn't drained) and then added the bread crumbs & parmesan.  Next I put the whole thing in a baking dish, sprinkled it with more breadcrumbs & parmesan, and put it in the oven for 15-20 minutes (just long enough to finish cooking the beans & mushrooms).  The parmesan didn't really melt, but it browned up with the bread crumbs and made a nice crunchy layer on the top.  It was incredible!  It's the only thing that I made that had no leftovers!  I have never served green beans at the holidays before, but I will from now on!  5 Stars for the finished product!...But I never would have gotten there without this recipe!

This is a fool-proof recipe and a crowd pleaser.  Very easy and quick to make, one I will use repeatedly!  I don't understand the negative reviews, especially concerning "grit."  Perhaps they didn't clean the beans properly, use the proper oil, or combine the marinade with the beans while they were hot.  A guest for dinner also thought that the marinade in this recipe would work well with other veggies, and be even tastier allowed to marinate longer.

These were sooooo easy to make and really awesome!  I made a few minor adjustments:  I steamed the beans in the microwave, and used about 2tsp of butter instead ofthe 1/4 C of olive oil.  To keep the olive oil flavor though, I drizzled about 1/2T over the beans.  Kids ate em up, and asked for more.  My husband said the only bad part was that I didn't make enough!!!!!(I made a whole pound!)  Will make over and over!

Hmmmmmmm.  I agree with Linda, I was intrigued by the like/dislike issue.  I leaned more toward the dislike.  It needs to be less oily & gritty.  Just my taste though.  Sorry Marie ;)

Sorry, no one in my family liked this recipe.  The bread crumbs become soggy after a short while and we all felt there was way too much cheese in it.  Probably will not make again.

My kids eat green beans now! (with this recipe).  Yum.  Had a friend over for dinner and I think he ate a whole pound of these himself! LOL .I used a little less oil the second time and tried it with both butter and EVOO the third time I made it.  Delicious.  A great way to watch your bountiful bean harvest dissappear.

So simple, flavorful and healthy! The oil held the seasoned bread crumbs to the beans nicely. My 12 year old daughter, who won't touch anything green, ate these right out of the bowl! Great the way it is and we added a bit fresh squeezed lemon juice to add a bit more zest.

I used frozen, whole green beans for this.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a go because I was looking for something easy with Green Beans.  I used less olive oil - about 1 T. and about that much butter.  I can't imagine how oily it would have been with an entire 1/4 C. of EVOO.  I can't say we were much impressed - it was edible but not great.  The side dish did not look particularly appetizing with the bread crumbs clinging to the beans - not soggy and not sandy - just, well, boring.  I won't be making this again.

I have been making this for years. I have always sauteed the breadcrumbs first. It gives the dish a pleasant toasty flavour. I have also used these same toasted crumbs on cauliflower, delicious.

These may be the best green beans we have ever had. This is so simple to make and has a great flavor. My mother generally won't even try anything green and she loved these.

Pretty good.  I put it together and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and put it in the ovenfor 15 before dinner and I think that helped everything meld together well.

I love this recipe!  Every time I make it I get complements on it.  I actually made it for a bridal shower this past weekend and have to send it to about half the people at the shower!    I do a few things differently.  I use shredded Parmesan cheese and I often use about a 1/2 cup of the cheese and the bread crumbs.  It's better with more crumbs!

Just made these for xmas eve dinner and everyone loved them, "mmm, these green beans are great. What's in them?"  I changed things up a little as recommended in some of these reviews.  To minimize the crunchy factor, I sautéed the bread crumbs and other seasoning prior to tossing with the beans , substituting butter for oil.  I also crushed the spices in a grinder.  Worked great.

I just used what I had to dress the beans: wheat panko bread crumbs, grill seasoning, dried thyme, and bit of a dried herb assortment (lavender, basil, thyme, etc), olive oil.  And I steamed them in the microwave in one of those zip loc bags.  Even my toddler who's been on a veggie strike liked them!!

I do one thing different, I just throw all the ingredients into a frying pan and cook them like that.  This helps with the gritty bread crumbs, they soften up and the flavors are cooked into the beans.  Otherwise, delish!

Very good....I will decrease the amount of crumbs next time. Thought it was a little much. As another reviewer had suggested, I heated this in the oven to release the flavor of the herbs. Tasty. Served with Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. Will make again!

These tasted fine, but my son (who loves green beans) didn't touch them. I did add some fresh garlic, but if I make them again, I'll add more. Also, my bread crumbs were homemade, so maybe store-bought would hold up better? It was nice and fast though!

This was an easy side dish to prepare.  I also added some sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up.  I added a bit more garlic powder to my liking. I found that 1/4 cup of olive oil seemed to much, so the next time I will use less.

I made these last night and they were delicious.  I used frozen green beans and cooked them according to the package label in the microwave.  My husband even liked them and he is very picky.  I will be making this again and again.

Love the idea. I used a bag and a half of frozen green beans (prepared as the bag recommends). To season, I used about three TSP of smart balance butter, white pepper, a bit of cracked black pepper, salt and a few dashes of garlic powder, all to taste (gave it a slight kick, which I enjoyed). Used crushed seasoned croutons mixed with some Parmesan cheese as a topping. No oven time needed and these reheated very nicely. Will return to this simple side dish often. Thanks for sharing!

This is great!  The only change I made was to mix it all up (minus the bread crumbs) and put them in a casserole dish.  I topped them with the bread crumbs and more cheese and baked them for 15-20 min.  Very good!

Can you say YUMMY?  This recipe was simply delicious!  Everyone in my house raved!!  I used a bag of Trader Joe's french, thin, green beans, which in my opinion are better than "regular" green beans.  After steaming them, I coated them with the olive oil first, and then tossed them with everything else!  So easy to make, and yet it looked like a fancy dish in a nice restaurant!  This would make a wonderful side dish for thanksgiving dinner, or to bring to a potluck.

This was pretty good.  I did make it with frozen green beans, as I had no fresh, but imagine it would taste so much better with fresh beans.  The only change I would make is to reduce the oil and breadcrumbs, and increase the herbs.  Served as a side with beef, and the 2 dishes worked well together.

I really didn't care for this side dish.  I served it with the Garlic Parmesan Chicken recipe (on this site and in the "Favorites" cookbook) to my bf and our friends.  They all liked it (I think they were being nice...).  The beans and bread crumb mixtre became soggy (beans limp) after sitting on the dinner table.  I'd make broccoli or pasta to go with the chicken parm next time.  This  did NOT make it into my "keeper file", which is too bad b/c it sounds yummy.  Sorry.

This is a great way to jazz up the plain green bean.  I have made it several times for my family and they just love them.  A squeeze of lemon juice gives it a fresh taste.  A definate keeper.

These are fantastic!  My husband isn't much of a vegetable eater, but he called these 'gourmet beans' and devoured them----there wasn't a bean left in the dish.
I also used frozen beans, since I didn't have fresh on hand, and they still tasted great.

'Guess this one is like Prince - either you like him or you don't.  :D  I didn't.  No one in this house did.  Soggy breadcrumbs with green beans.  What's the attraction?  I do not know.  :)

This was delicious!!! However, it was only because I followed the suggestions of others and omitted the bread crumbs.  I used 1 1/2 pounds of fresh green beans, steamed them then tossed them in olive oil and spices, and sprinkled them with parmesan cheese. very nice.

This was very good, one trick I learned from my father in law was to use ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs and salt.  You just smash the crackers down add italian seasoning with a little bit of butter to soften the crackers.  This recipe looked very fancy and was very good.  I will be serving this again.

i thought these were excellent!  the spices were in perfect proportion, although i think i added quite a bit more cheese than the recipe called for (i just sprinkled away on top without measuring!)  even my 2 year old liked them and that says a lot!

This dish has been a huge hit every time I've made it. I use unsalted sweet butter instead of oil, and I mix the cheese in along with everything else (instead of just topping the beans). Once it's all mixed up, I pop it all in the oven at 350* for 10-15 minutes. Yum! :)

This recipe was ok. I changed it up a bit to get better results. I sauted fresh minced garlic in the olive oil before tossing the green beans. Much more d-lish. I also used far less bread crumbs.

These were just ok as is.  The flavor is pretty boring and I really think it needs to be heated all together to bring out the flavor of all the herbs and the italian bread crumbs.  Also since the parmesan was cold it brought down the temp of the beans even though I moved them to the bowl straight from the steamer.  Next time I will either bake or saute everything together and see if that makes a difference.

I served these with a turkey tenderloin and red potatoes last night. I have never made green beans in my house, but have eaten them other places. I put some on my husband's plate (who REFUSES to eat green beans) just to see what he'd do. He tried one of them, and finished off the rest!!  I enjoyed them, but the bread crumbs got kind of gloppy and stuck together, almost giving a consistency of brown sugar. Next time I think I will use less bread crumbs and less olive oil. Overall we liked them!

Very tasty!  I just drained some canned beans, tossed them in all the ingredients, and put on a baking sheet for 15 mins at 350!  What a nice way to liven up a boring side dish.

This is a delightful way to "kick up" green beans.  I used Bird's Eye Frozen Beans and Carrots Medley.  I used Italian spice (Oregano, Sage, Thyme) in place of oregano alone.  I used half the bread crumbs and half the cheese.  This gave it a lighter flare for a summer time dish.  I completed the dish with a splash of lemon juice.  I LOVE vegetables and these were wonderful!

Will make again and rate since I did not follow the directions exactly.  Did not have fresh green beans and substituted canned which just happened to be in the pantry.  Big mistake.  We did not like the texture at all but the taste was decent.  Can't wait to make with the real thing.

What a hit at Christmas dinner!  The family members who don't like green beans loved them.  Much better than a traditional green bean casserole.  I didn't add the bread crumbs.  I thought that would be too much.

I love this recipe. I prepare it a bit differently though: I gently saute the beans (usually frozen thin beans from Trader Joe's) in olive oil and fresh garlic, then add the crumbs and the rest of the ingredients. I cover and let the beans steam. This softens the bread crumbs and blends the flavors nicely.

This was a perfectly flavorful sidedish to another recipe online for easy beef tenderloin. I took some suggestions (e.g. used frozen green beans, a liberal amount of fresh parm cheese, and NO breadcrumbs at all--too much controversy). Accidentally, due to a time crunch, I forgot to add the olive oil to the mixture. I think the parmesan cheese alone added a rich flavor. As a final tip, I mixed all the dry ingredients in the bowl with the grated cheese before tossing in the green beans.  I could tell by all the "mmm"s from my boyfriend that it was a success.

i teach students and used this recipe for a class.  It was nice and simple and tasty.  I had comments like  "I hate green beans, but this is really tasty and I love it!" i changed it a little, used seasoned croutons and sprinkled them over the beans with the freshly grated parmesean cheese.

It's always hard to find ways to spice up a meal with vegetables but this did the trick.  Used this during the holidays and everyone loved it.  Had to print out multiple copies of recipe to hand out to guests.  Looking forward to spring when I can try with my own fresh herbs.

What a great twist for green beans!  Thought it was excellent, and not at all gritty like some said.  I made this with the Fried Pork Chop recipe on this site and it was a quick and filling meal, perfect for the middle of the week!  Will make these again for sure, only next time I will be using fresh green beans instead of canned!

Very simple and tasty. (And *not* gritty!) I don't care for dried spices so I used fresh garlic, basil, and oregano. I will make this again. Even the children liked it, and they don't like much. :)

I was skeptical of this recipe!  Didn't think these ingredients together would taste good, but I had several cans of french-style green beans and needed a veggie side one night.  Other than substituting canned for fresh beans and heating till most water evaporated, I followed the recipe exactly.  Pleasantly surprised!!

I've made this recipe a few times for family gatherings, and they always get rave reviews! More than a couple of people have asked me for the recipe. You do have to make sure to not overcook the green beans, but even if you do, it still tastes good. I add in some onion powder and double the garlic powder (or add in minced garlic). They do not make good leftovers because they get soggy, but they taste so good that there are usually no leftovers.

Good as is, but much better if you fry the bread crumbs.  Here are my revisions. Boil and drain the beans. Put 3 T olive oil and 3 T of butter in saute pan. Add 1 c. Panko bread crumbs, 1/2 c. dry parmesan and a generous amount of garlic salt. Mix and brown over medium-high heat. Stir in green beans and stir to coat. Delicious!

Made these with some fresh green beans.  I only made one change and that was to boil the green in low sodium chicken broth.

After cooking, I drizzled them with olive oil and tossed.  I then tossed with all the remaining ingredients which I combined earlier.

My dinner guests loved these.  Recommended!

These were okay. Dry. I didn't care for the olive oil flavor. Good idea, but I'd like it better with butter instead of olive oil and less bread crumbs. The parmesan was good with them. My son liked these, my husband and I did not.

This is a great recipe, though you can't mix everyhting together like it says...what I ended up doing after reading the reviews was spinkled the cooked green beans with the olive oil then mixed until coated.  Then mixed all the dry ingredients and sprinkled just enough on the coated green beans.  If I had added all the bread crumb mixture then it would be gritty, etc....but just a small amount makes it just right.

Nice change for greenbeans, didn't add cheese. FRESH minced garlic is key! I found that if I coat first with evoo then mix in the crumbs it doesn't get soggy. We make these once a week, these are a hit with guests and are for whatever reason 'manly greenbeans' the mans they love'em!

This was so good, I just made a few changes to it.  Once I put everything together I put them in a baking dish with extra cheese, bread crumbs, and pepper on top and baked it at 350 for about 8 to 10 mins.  It might be a few less or more depending on the oven.  The cheese was melted and oh so good give it a try.  I also didn't use that much olive oil.  I only used 2 Tablespoons and it turned out fine.

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my husband. I don't think it tasted sandy but I did cut back on the breadcrumbs just a little bit. It was nice for a different taste.

Very Good! It is better if you heat the oil until very hot in a pan. Season the greenbeans and put them in the pan let the fry until crispy turn and continue to fry. very easy and good. the flavor is wonderful.

Sort of bland.  Maybe I didn't add enough salt.  My mother-in-law liked them but for everyone else, I'll stick to my bacon, onion, red pepper version.
Thanks for the recipe.  It's always nice to try something new.

These were the hit of the dinner party we went to last night! As soon as I realized the mixture was basically the same one used for filling stuffed artichokes and meatballs, I knew I'd love them. We mixed everything together and it sat in a covered dish for about 20 minutes before serving, which let the breadcrumbs soften and the flavors blend. The texture was perfect and I'll definitely be making these again.

I've made these twice now once following the recipe, and once baking the mix in the oven for 15 minutes.  We do like them better baked.  Cut the olive oil back to 2 tablespoons also.  Great flavor!

I didn't really like the texture of the breadcrumbs in this recipe. It seems like this would taste better if the green beans were baked with the greenbeans and olive oil so they'd be crispier. Instead they were a bit soggy.

Made it for a party with fresh green beans from the garden and everyone liked it.  Only gave it four stars as no one asked for the recipe (my quasi-indicator for a 5-star rating!).  Was quick and easy to prepare, though, which is always a bonus.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. It is quick and easy and a nice change for steamed beans. I prefer using fresh beans (usually a mix of yellow and green) but have also used canned when that's all I had and it is a nice way to dress up canned beans. Husband and kids (1 and 3 years old) also love them. The only change I make is mixing the cheese into the bread crumb mixture and tossing everything at once. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box.

I don't think I'll be eating plain green beans anymore! I'm a fresh fanatic...but my boys (husband and stepson) prefer canned vegetables. This recipe actually made canned green beans good! That's high praise from me. Well done!

I first made this from the Valentine's Day Recipe menu posted by allrecipes.com on Valentine's Day evening 2005.  My boyfriend and I had reservations at Ruth's Criss in Northern Va., but got home from work late and decided to cook together rather than go out.  We had a great time drinking champagne and talking as we prepared the meal together.  Cooking on Valentine's Day together has been a tradition ever since.  This is a great veggie side dish to any meal and we continue to make it to this day.

Loved it!  Served for Christmas dinner and everyone raved.  A little less oil would probably be better.  Tasted very "Italian" and flavorful.

My son tried the recipe and told me I had to try it.  Thank you Mark for the suggestion and thank you Marie for a great recipe.  I don't actually like frozen green beans but didn't have fresh available and it was still great.  Using fresh for New Years Eve Dinner at my home.  BREAD CRUMB MIXTURE MAKES A GREAT BREADING FOR CHICKEN BREAST. I BROWON THE BREADED BREAST IN OLIVE OIL AND BUTTER AND TOP WITH SWISS CHEESE.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I overdid it on the garlic powder and salt (my own fault), but I can tell that if I had done it right, it would have been very tasty.  Next time I might mince some fresh garlic and saute it in the olive oil until tender, then pour that over the beans.  For those who think the bread crumbs were soggy, maybe stick the beans under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up?  Anyway... it's a nice variation on regular green beans, and I'll definitely try it again.

I thought this recipe was a little dry. Though I liked the bread crumbs & typically enjoy all the requested seasonings, I felt it just didn't compliment the green beans.  Dry & unexciting.

This was very easy, especially when using the prepackaged green beans and was very tasty.  It was a big hit for Thanksgiving.

My kids LOVE this recipe!!!  It was the first time in a long time I could get them to eat GREEN FOOD.  They particularly like mixing up the seasonings with the green beans.  It has caused them to actually eat green beans in every form!

In the words of a famous Food Network chef..."YUM-O"!  This was such a yummy recipe.  Lots of flavor and the instructions were to a "T"!  I used fresh green beans and not canned.  However, can you even get the same flavor from canned?  ...there's nothing like fresh!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

the bread crumbs seemed to take all the flavor from the beans, and made it pasty and bland.  I had to add a lot of salt to make it edible.

FABULOUS! I was surprised at how the taste of the olive oil came through (I used extra virgin olive oil) which is why I loved this recipe so much. The seasonings are also just perfect. The bread crumbs and parmesan cheese add a nice finishing touch. I am not normally a fan of fresh green beans (I was raised on canned so prefer those), but this recipe may just become one of my favorite vegetable recipes!

Fantastic recipe!!  My whole family loved these!!  Even my 2 yr old.  I changed it a little bit ... used all of the ingredients but sauteed the green beans in EVOO, basil, oregano & crushed red pepper.  I also added a half of a small onion.  After they were fully sauteed I added about 1/4 cup of low carb bread crumbs and about 1/3 cup of parm. cheese and tossed.  Really ~ really ~ yummy!!!!  Thanks!!

I made this for my Easter dinner.  It accompanied the ham very well and my husband and I thought it was a nice alternative for a side dish - we both enjoyed this dish.  My children didn't want to try them, but after they did, they said they were just o.k. - I think they ate too many chocolate eggs! Thanks for sharing a good recipe!!

Quick & easy...nice change instead of plain green beans. I didn't have parmesan and I had PLAIN bread crumbs instead of italian (made this at last minute) but I added italian seasoning.  I also added garlic salt because it tasted sort of bland. I'm sure it'll taste even better when I make it again with the parmesan.

This was very good.  I nuked frozen green beans in an oven-safe casserole dish until they were slightly tender.  After mixing in the oil and spices (doubled the garlic powder), I baked it for 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven (stirred it once) to allow the flavors to blend.  Then I topped it with the Parmesan.  This recipe made very large portions, so next time I would make a bit less green beans, but keep the spices the same (to make it a bit more tasty).

This was a nice change to plain old green beans. I used frozen instead of fresh and they came out just fine. My kids didn't care for them at all, hence the 4 stars, but hubby and I enjoyed them.

I microwaved a can of french-cut beans (drained) then added the breadcrumb mixture (cut this part of the recipe in half -- and I'd cut it even more next time).  Didn't have any parm left so went without (would have been a tasty touch, though).  A nice new way to make green beans.

As others have warned, the breadcrumbs did not hold up very well, but the parmesan cheese compensated nicely.  I served buffet style on a big platter alongside a roasted pork loin and caramelized shallots.  They were especially good the next day as leftovers.  Next time I will mix with everything but the breadcrumbs.  I will add the breadcrumbs only as a garnish.

This did not do it for me.  I can relate to the sand comment made in a previous review. The consistency of the bread crumbs with the green beans tasted grainy.  If you were making a green bean casserole, then having the bread crumb mixture on top would be great. But just not in this presentation.

I had a little trouble with the consistency after I added the bread crumbs, but then I added just enough spaghetti sauce to coat the mixture and it was FABULOUS!  I really enjoyed it (with just a tad of red sauce.)  Thanks!  I never would have thought of putting these ingredients together.

The only thing I didn't like about it was how soggy the bread crumbs turned out when you use ready-made bread crumbs.  The 2nd time around I made my own bread crumbs and they stayed a little crispier, which we liked.  (I made the bread crumbs by putting french bread in the food processor, heating olive oil in an oven-proof pan, adding some minced garlic, pinch of salt/pepper, and then placing the pan in the oven to toast the bread crumbs).

I'm sorry, but we hated this. I thought it sounded great, but it didn't turn out that way. It looked absolutely disgusting from the pan, but we tried it anyway and it literally tasted like beans with sand on top. Good idea I guess, but EW.

It was unaminous.  This one's a keeper.  There wasn't a bean left in the bowl.  I steamed the beans til just tender and used half the amount of olive oil.  Can't wait til my herb garden is ready for harvest.

This was excellent!  What a nice change from plain old green beans.  The garlic added an extra zing!  I made them as a side dish with Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed them.

A different twist on green beans!  I normally just use canned beans, but these fresh beans were really good and easy to make.

I made this for a potluck at my son's preschool.  By the time I got to the dish it was 
just about gone.  I overheard on lady  say to her friend, "Get the greenbeans, they are great.
Definitely a keeper.

The only time-consuming part of this recipe is snapping the stems off of the green beans.  Otherwise, it was a wonderful side dish.

Very good, even with frozen beans (although not as good as with fresh, obviously).  This amount of oil was too much for me--I cut it in half.

Very tasty. Be sure to serve it IMMEDIATELY after preparing. It does not reheat well at all. The bread crumbs get soggy & the cheese melts. Only cook it if you're sure your significant other will be home on time!

This was a quick and easy side dish that we liked. I poured the olive oil on the beans and stirred until they were coated
 Then I added the crumb mixture and stirred again.  I only had plain bread crumbs. I think the seasoned  crumbs are a must.

I thought this was worth a try rather than regular green beans with butter, salt and pepper or casserole.  This was a hit two times that I made it for a not so veggie friendly crowd........I must confess, I do not measure when I cook all the time.  Use your common sense as far as boiling them.  You do not want them mushy, but not raw either, a little crunch.  The oil and breadcrumbs blended nicely.  As far as a "sandy" taste, I have no idea why this would happen.  I did not experience that one bit.  As one of the reviewers did, I am also making them this Christmas and will be putting them in the fridge and will heat up in the oven before dinner.  5 stars on this simple easy recipe.

Didn't knock our socks off. Followed the recipe- the beans were too hard and the bread crumbs didn't help. I might have to go back and read some reviews and see what others did to rate this so high. I'll give it another shot though.

I followed the recipe But found that in my saucepan more than 1/2 cup of water was needed for the beans.  I think it depends upon the pot.  Other than that the beans were very good.

Family enjoyed these green beans served with my spaghetti so I think I will be using these whenever I have an Italian main dish..  

I'm not a big fan of olive  oil for flavoring so I substituted the same amount of butter and doubled all the spices.

I make this, but I only blanch the beans, than I saute them in olive oil and a little butter sprinkling the breadcrumbs on top and this way they get coated better.    I also make them with yellow beans.  Yum.

I thought that these were great. Hubby was a little less enthused but he'd give it another try. I did accidentally add the parmesan into the mix instead of adding it on top. Regardless, make sure you don't over-cook the beans.

We make these regularly and love them.  We love parmesan so usually add extra.  I think a combination of 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 melted butter helps for people who aren't crazy about the olive flavour.  Very unusual, but my guests always love it!

These were ok, but I didn't have a full pound of beans and so I think my ratios were off which in turn made me not love them.  The olive oil especially was way too strong.  I think they have great potential though, so I'll definitely make them again.  I think I'll just stream the oil in slowly until it's just right.

Eh....not my favorite by any means. I make green beans so much and so I wanted to use a different recipe than my own. The bread crumps were not good at all. Everything else was ok, but the bread crumbs were so grainy and gross. I even browned them a little bit before tossing it all together.

Yuck! The bread crumbs were mushy and completely unappetizing. I hardly ate mine, and my husband took one bite and threw the rest away. Definetly will not be making this again.

My family loves this and it is super easy to do. I will sometimes lay it in a casserole after I have added the olive oil and the italian bread crumbs and seasoning, then sprinkle the parmesean on top - bake in the oven for a few minutes and it's even better :-) kids request this once a week.

Very good.  I did steam my green  beans just bc that's what I'm stuck on doing.  I just eyeballed ingredients and didn't think anything was too gritty or anything.  I do like the idea of baking just bc grated parmesan cheese doesn't melt as easily as other cheese, and I would've liked the cheese to be melted.  I'll try baking next time.  Otherwise, nice blend of seasonings and ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with asparagus. My husband LOVED it. I thought it was ok - I am not a big Parmesan person and my husband is. Maybe that was the difference. I will make this again so thanks for sharing!

Don't hate me but I am reviewing this even though I pretty much made up my own recipe from this. I took the green beans, steamed them then put them in ice water. After draining them, I tossed them with a mixture of bread crumbs, olive oil, seasoning salt and parmesan cheese. Then I put them in the oven at 375 for about 20. I thought they were great! Kids wouldn't eat them and hubby said they were OK but he doesn't love veggies so that's pretty good. Sorry for ripping this recipe apart but I did come up with something yummy so thanks for the idea.

My family is always looking for new ways to eat vegetables. This seemed easy enough so we decided to give it a try. I used frozen green beans because that is all we had. Also, based on other reviews I only used a sprinkle of the bread crumbs to avoid sandiness. Great flavor. Pretty sure it would have been better with fresh beans as the frozen were a little wetter than I would have liked. Will make again everyone liked them.

These were really good! They might have a little too much topping (there were some clumps left in the bottom), but no biggie! Everyone was snacking on them as they were waiting for dinner to finish.

My daughter loved these. The mistake I made reading the recipe however was I combined all the ingredients in the bowl awaiting the beans. When the beans were done, the mix had conformed together to make a crumbly mixture. So...learn from my mistake and drizzle the ingredients on one at a time after the beans are ready. I will try again because of the good flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I forgot to add the olive oil and the parm cheese and it was still a hit! Very easy to make as well. Can't wait to try it again with all the ingredients.

These were delicious!  I only had plain bread crumbs so I had to use those and also didn't have any parmesan cheese and the recipe was still A+!  Thanks so much for the idea!

After reading the negative comments on the bread crumbs, I just made it without them and I thought it was super!
I just used canned green beans too.
It kind of tasted like spinach fettucine alfredo.

Nice way to do green beans differently.  I tend to just steam them, but this way a nice change of pace and everyone ate them up.

I really enjoyed this, but the flavor didn't seem to sink into the green beans much. Next time I will try baking it for 15 mins as another review suggested.

My family and I did not care for this at all. No one took more than a bite. The seasonings mixed with the oil just made a big gloppy mess and stuck to the beans in big chunks. It made them taste gritty and oily. I will not be making his again.

Very easy and very good!  I upped the spices and parmesan a bit, and used several different types of bread crumbs (used homemade whole wheat).  I've tried it again and lowered the amount of oil and it still worked very well.  This is now a staple in our house!

I thought it was ok, but too bready and lost the fresh, healthy flavor of the beans.  Kids loved it though, but probably won't make it again.

Everyone raved about this recipe! I took it to my lunch club at work and everyone wanted the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. Actually, I made two batches. I forgot the olive oil in the second batch and it was just as good. This is a definite keeper. Thanks!

I used a 1 lb. package of frozen whole green beans, heating them in the microwave prior to mixing with the other ingredients. After mixing I popped them in the oven for 10 or 15 minutes. We really enjoyed these and I will make them again.

Loved it! I served this with Modenese Pork Chops from this site. I told my  husband about the mixed reviews that people either loved it or hated it, & he said that the people who didn't like it prob overcooked the green beans. I will be serving this again. Thanks Marie.

It's allright.  I'm not used to eating bread crumbs in that manner, but it definitely makes the appeal of eating green beans much better for me.  I'll use a little more seasoning next time, and maybe I'll pop it in the oven like another person did.

This was ok. Edible, certainly. And at twist on "normal" green beans. But, all in all there wasn't anything I found spectacular about it. I would have liked plain green beans just as well. ... I'm not sure this receipe is worth the (very light!) work.

Healthy and delicious!  I used frozen beans and unseasoned bread crumbs and it tasted great.  I'm sure it will be even better with fresh beans and seasoned crumbs.  Lots of compliments!

I doubled this recipe, and three children and three adults ate nearly every bit!!  I increased the olive oil by a teaspoon or so, just so the crumbs would stick to the beans better.  It was very tasty.  I used bags of pre-trimmed beans, so it was extra easy.  This is a keeper!

My whole family LOVES this recipe - including my 3 year old and 1 year olds.  There is no other vegetable that they so willingly eat.  We even have to cut them off so they'll eat other parts of their meal!  

We make the recipe as is, but do not add the Parmesan cheese (to make it just that little bit healthier).  It's great!

This was a pretty good week-night side dish. The bread crumb mixture had a nice flavor, but didn't really stick to the green beans.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Marie!

I tried something different. I sautéed about 1/2 cup of diced beacon with some chopped sun dried tomatoes and lastly added the bread crumbs just before adding it to the beans. I served it immediately. It was a tasty alternative.

Loved this! Made a version of it. Very simple! I used a bag of frozen french cut beans, cooked in a sauce pan w/ a cup of water and a handful of baby bella mushrooms for 10-15. Drained  - Tossed with EVOO and breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Left out all the other spices. Sprinkled with parm cheese and baked for 15  at 350. Would serve to guests for sure and will make again1 Thanks!

We didn't like this at all.  The spices didn't seem to go with green beans and the bread crumbs got all soggy and goopey.  Plus they just didn't seem to go with the green beans - texture or taste wise.  Of course, mine turned out nothing like the picture, so maybe I did something wrong.  But we won't be trying again to see.

I used canned green beans and omitted the parmesan since I didn't have any.  This is a great alternative to plain green beans, very flavorful.  I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, just sprinkled it on after cooking.

One of my most favorite ways to eat almost any veggie.  Sauteed in butter instead of oil, and then I use crushed ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I also put a dash of sugar in just for a smidge of sweetness.  I love my veggies this way and so does my picky 2 year old!

I'm always looking for something to do with green beans and I like this. Very easy, and tasty. I use just enough olive oil to cover the beans and than toss with the bread crumb/herb mix.

I have an ABUNDANCE of green beans from my garden already and needed something different to do with them.  I found this in the AllRecipes cookbook that I got out of the library and made these last night for dinner....Making them again today for my father's noontime meal.   They are really terrific but I added a bunch more garlic because we LOVE garlic.   Definitely a keeper!

Good-but will leave out the breadcrumbs next time. They didn't add anything to the recipe. I will also use less olive oil. My daughter enjoyed the herbs with beans. Going to serve again (with changes) for company.

This recipe rocks!!!  There is no need for rice or potatoes when serving these beans!  They are flavorful & plenty satisfying with a grilled chicken breast over the top and a crusty roll!  I did omit the spices & used Italian Bread Crumbs.  Thanks for sharing!  So so yummy!!!

I am not sure why everyone thinks this is so great - it was ALRIGHT.  It was very easy, so I would suggest that you try making it and see for yourself what you think.  My husband and I both thought, "Ah, it's ok."  The bread crumbs gave it a gritty texture that was not so pleasing to us.

I served this for Easter brunch and thought it was a delicious change from just regular green beans. Easy to prepare and ingredients were already in my cupboard.  Very good and will definitely make again.

Fabulous.  I had to cover them and put them in the refrigerator so I wouldn't eat the entire dish before the rest of the dinner was ready.  My only suggestion would be to use less breadcrumbs and cheese next time.

I thought that this was just ok. I did use the suggestion of other reviewers and baked this for a few minutes in the oven and thought that it was still just ok.  I definitely understand the reviewers who commented that it was gritty (and it has nothing to do with not washing your green beans.)The breadcrumbs almost seem a little unecessary for this recipe. Thanks for sharing Marie.

I didn't think these were that good.  But my guests said they liked them.  The bread crumbs threw it off, a little too grainy.

Finally green beans that taste really good.  Because we are on a diet we only use 1 tbsp each of oil and bread crumbs.  It is still fabulous.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Outstanding.  Grocery store was out of fresh beans, so I used can beans.  Still had a tremendous flavor.  Good for leftovers too - but got a little soggy on day 2.

I thought this was good, but you really want to eat it with something complementary to Italian flavors because it is very Italian!  Very quick and easy to make, too.

A nice change from plain old green beans! And so easy! The kids loved em'! Didn't have any parmesan so I just left it out and they were still very good, but will definitely use it next time as I'm sure it adds some great flavor!

These were edible, but I would not make again. I used Ritz crackers, instead of bread crumbs, as one user suggested. My family enjoyed the flavor, but the bread crumbs got very soggy, very quickly, and were almost mushy. Glad I scaled down the recipe, because leftovers would have been even soggier, I'm sure.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The second time around, I added twice the amount of Parmesan cheese suggested and it made the dish that much more popular.

very good and easy to make.  I used frozen green beans instead of fresh and it turned out fine.  Don't quite understand the sand comment because I thought the bread crumbs added a nice texture.

Made these for a potluck dinner and got compliments on them.  I omitted the Parmesan cheese since I didn't have any on hand.  I also boiled the beans in a full pot of water, just because that's how I'm used to cooking them. :)  My husband thought these were good, not too exciting, but he said that it's hard to make green beans really tasty unless you cover them with cheese or something fatty.  All in all a good recipe that I would make again.

I liked these, but I think I put too many crumbs and olive oil in there to compensate for the larger amount of green beans.  Next time, less is better in this recipe.  I'd make it again. :9

This was a good alternative to regular old green beans! I think next time I will use less bread crumbs- it seemed to be a bit too much. Good recipe overall! Thanks!

I thought this recipe was tasty, but I wasn't inspired to take a second helping, one of my own criteria for giving a four or five star rating.  I had half of a leftover tomato that I also chopped up and threw in for extra color.  I think my biggest problem was that the bread crumbs I used were slightly stale.  Next time, I'll try using fresh bread crumbs.  Also, I tried to cut down on olive oil, but the bread crumbs didn't cling right to the green beans.  I will probably try making this again one more time.

I made this for some company last week and it turned out pretty well.  It didn't blow me away, but it was pretty good.  Definitely something different to do with green beans.  I will probably make it again sometime, but I'm not in a big hurry to and it wasn't something that all the guests were asking for the recipe.  My husband was kind of neutral on them.  He doesn't like "different" that often and said he didn't care for them that much, but he did eat the leftovers the next night.  I went ahead and gave it 4 stars because I did like them.

Although I liked the crunchiness of these beans, they were not a hit at my Easter dinner table.  Everyone liked them OK, but not enough to make again.

I served this at my son's baptism celebration.  Usually I have lots of vegetalbes leftover, however this was the first thing to go!  I cut down on the olive oil by using a Mr. Misto sprayer.  It worked great.

Delicious! A great twist on the usual green bean recipes. This will be a welcome dish in the summer when green beans are so plentiful.

There are a number of variations depending on what is in your cabinets at the time.  We tried it with summer savory and it tasted great!  Looking forward to new variations for this simple green bean treat!

So simple and delicious.  I made them without adding cheese to omit calories and chlorestoral.  Everyone loved them and asked for more.  These will become a regular at our house.

I was asked to bring green beans to Christmas dinner (not being a big fan of green beans) - I needed to find a recipe.  The dish received rave reviews by everyone at dinner, myself included!

I found the recipe on Thanksgiving eve and made it for my family the next day.  OIt was very easy and used items already in my cupboard.  I think it tastes best made just before serving, otherwise the bread crumbs get a bit soggy.
