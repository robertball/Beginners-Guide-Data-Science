Excellent! I was in a hurry, so I made the corn in the InstantPot (steamed for 2 mins), but this came out delicious! The lime and chili powder aren't overpowering and add so much flavor! This will be a regular recipe in my house!

Very good! I completely forgot the chili powder, but I'll try it that way next time. Even w/o it, this had great flavor and we really liked the lime, which was not too overpowering. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
