I went ahead and made half this as meatballs and half as hamburgers. I made several larger meatballs. They will brown really fast so keep an eye. Can't go wrong adding more ingredients to the meats flavoring.

These were ok. They weren’t particularly tender. Everyone thought they were quite bland, too. Next time, I’ll use half the meat for the same amount of other ingredients.
