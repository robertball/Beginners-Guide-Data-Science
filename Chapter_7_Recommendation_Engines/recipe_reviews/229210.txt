Ok: I totally "get" this...a twist between Mexican nachos and typical tater tot hot dish. Made as directed and pretty good. My mind couldn't quite process the upside down (or reversed) baking of this casserole but it was good. I totally plan to try again with the following changes. 1) place beef on bottom per normal. 2) in place of your typical green beans (as the 2nd "layer" I will try...maybe a can of chili beans or black beans...we'll see what's in my pantry. 3) pour half the sauce over the meat/beans, layer tots and pour remaining sauce over all. Bake for the normal hour or so as I am used to but will still achieve the Mexican twist goal.  Fun and worth a try. Thank you for the great idea.

My kids and husband loved it.  The only thing I did differently was used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce because it's what I had on hand.  Will make again!!!

Hubby really liked.  I didn't have nacho cheese soup on hand, so I used a cheddar cheese soup that I had instead.  I also added a can of chopped green chilis and black olives.  Pretty good, may become a regular item for our dinner menu.

I kept all the ingredients it called for as listed, with the exception of adding a cup of frozen sweet corn to the hamburger/tomato soup mixture as it was simmering.  Other than that, the one major change I made was to flip this casserole upside down from it's instructions.  I have OCD...seriously...and my mind could not deal with the tots being on the bottom.  The concept literally drove me insane (anyone with OCD will understand) and I couldn't build the casserole the way it was instructed.  So I placed the hamburger/tomato soup/taco seasoning mix with the corn I added on the bottom, topped it with 3/4 of the nacho cheese soup mixture, then the tater tots which I crisped beforehand, then drizzled those with the final 1/4 nacho cheese soup mix.  Baked for 15 - 20 minutes, then topped with the shredded cheese and diced green onion. Placed back in the oven another 5-10 minutes until cheese was melted and golden brown.  This was DELICIOUS.  Rave reviews from hubby and one that will definitely go into rotation.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This casserole was pretty good. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I just felt like it was lacking something in flavor, I think next time I will add more taco seasoning.

Very tasty but incredibly salty as directed. I'd need to find lower sodium ingredients before making it again.

Awesome.  I didnt season the meat seperatly (didnt see the point).  I just poured the whole package of taco seasoning into the soup mix (plus a little more)  Only used about 3/4 of the bag of tater tots.  Will definatly repeat.

Love this recipe! So good. I use a white onion instead of the green onion as my grocery store always seems out of them.

I forgot to bake the tater tots before adding the rest of the ingredients and it still was delicious. Next time Iâ€™ll bake them first for the crunchiness. Also used salsa instead of tomato soup because I was out and it worked well. Will definitely make again!

4 stars because it needed a little something extra. I used green and white onion. Added fresh tomatoes  and sliced red pepper strips. I only had cheddar soup so I used it.  Having the fresh tomato and pepper helped offset some of the "tinny" taste of the canned soups. I also used a recipe on here for taco seasoning. It makes a difference in the overall taste.

It was pretty good, but it was a little heavy on sauce and too light on hamburger. Want to try again making these adjustments.

I agree with JED901...WAY salty.  I don't think there is a "non-seasoned" version of tater tots....if there are, my local GIANT doesn't have them.  Anywho......I used the burger, cheddar cheese soup, medium picante, milk, a can of mexicorn and a whole pack of taco seasoning low sodium and onion powder(I didn't have fresh onion) and it was STILL tooo salty.  Next time I will use either veggie tots or cut the taco seasoning in half.......no need to add to the soup mixture.  With that being said......my "picky" BF LOVED it...had 2 servings!!!!

I made this for dinner tonight with some minor changes based on what I had in the house.   I used ground turkey instead of beef, a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup since I didn't have the other kind, and two cans of Rotel tomatoes (mild with diced green chilis).  I didn't cook the tater tots first as suggested in the original recipe.  I just mixed the soup, tomatoes and browned ground turkey together and poured it over the top of the tater tots in the casserole dish.  Baked it on 350 for 25 minutes, added some shredded cheese to the top and let it melt before serving.

My family all liked this I made it as written.. I thought it would be to soupy but with putting the tatters on the bottom they really helped to thicken it. Nice change.

It was great,  it took longer than it said in recipe...I cranked up the temperature to 400Â° to crisp up the tater tots and once adding the rest of ingredients it still took longer....than recommended.

This was a nice change from our regular hamburger dishes and we really liked it. For ease, I browned the beef, adding the diced yellow onion during the last bit, to soften. Added at that point a can of pinto beans and the taco seasoning packet. Poured that mixture into a 9x9 pan (perfect size, as it turned out); topped with shredded cheese; poured the mixture of soups and milk over the top, sprinkling with a bit more homemade taco seasoning; and refrigerated until 30 minutes before dinner time. 
At that point, preheated the oven while covering the top of the casserole with tater tots, which required less than the amount called for here, and also no bottom layer of tots. Cooked about 25 to 30 minutes, as it started out cold from the fridge. Easy and quick. Hubby like as is and I did too, but found it even tastier with sprinkles of Tobasco sauce. 
 We found the layer of tots as a topping to be more than adequate and don't think either of us would have liked it half as much with an additional layer on the bottom. Yum. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe pretty much like directed. I added some white onions also into the hamburger as it was cooking.  I added a can of corn, drained, into the soup mixture. I didn't brown the tator tots first, I just put soup mixture on top of frozen tots. I crushed some fritos on top of the melted cheese.  Yum!!!  Its a keeper.

This turned out great! I think it'll be a new favorite. Incredibly filling and delicious! My grocery store doesn't carry the condensed nacho cheese soup, so I used two individual cups of a 4-pk of Chi-chi's nacho cheese dip and a can of Contadina tomato sauce. I omitted the milk because we only had almond milk on-hand and that didn't sound too appealing for this recipe.
