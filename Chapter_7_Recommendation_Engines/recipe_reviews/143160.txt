These are really tasty! For the seasoning, I poured 3/4 cup salt into a measuring cup and filled it up to the 1 cup line with garlic powder, garlic salt, mixed up salt, Emerils seasoning, and a little cayene pepper. 

I don't like them too mushy so I just let them boil for about 3 hours. The trick to the right degree of saltiness according to your taste is to let them soak in their brine after they boil, and taste one every 15 mins or so until they are the way you like them. I let them soak for about another hour. Then drain them and rinse because they're really messy otherwise. Then I dried them a little in handfuls with paper towels and put them in a big tuperware container.

These peanuts had a really good taste, but they were too salty for me. Next time I make them, I'll cut all the ingredients except the peanuts in half. Anyone who loves boiled peanuts, this is definitely worth your time to make!

I think the last person who reviewed this recipe meant to give it at least four stars.  She said, "this is definitely worth you time making." So, I just wanted to boost the rating score a little bit.  Oh yes, I made it and it is very good.

My family loves boiled peanuts, but unfortunately, we live a little too far North to enjoy them very often.  This recipe brings the South a little closer to us!  The onions and garlic in this recipe make them less salty, but just as flavorful as the traditional boiled peanuts we have had.  They were delicious!  They are not difficult, just a bit time consuming.  I do suggest a good rinse before eating.  The garlic and onion boil down to little bits that make eating them even messier.  Just rinse them while they are draining in the collander and then enjoy!  For those who haven't had boiled peanuts, they have a texture similar to a bean - which isn't surprising as they are part of the legume family.  They just aren't quite as soft as a cooked bean.  Try them, they are addictive!
