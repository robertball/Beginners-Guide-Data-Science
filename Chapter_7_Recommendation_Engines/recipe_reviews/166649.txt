I couldn't get the sunrise affect, my whole drink was just orange. Also you really have to like your drinks veeeeeery strong, all I could really taste was tequilla. But of course for some people that's a good thing :)

I love this drink. it covers up the taste of the tequila very well. and it has a sweet, but not too sweet taste. I recommend to have someone sober to mix them for you or after a few you will mess them up- lol
