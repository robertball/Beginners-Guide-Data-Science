This is the BEST salad ever but after making it a few times I will say that you can do all these variations and it will be terrific but do NOT put the dressing into the fridge, leave it on the counter!  It will not be good, it will get creamy and stay on the salad like PASTE.  You can get the spinach (baby spinach is the best) and slice the strawberries with an egg slicer and toss ahead, in the fridge...but let the dressing sit on the counter, trust me.  Then toss immediately before eating.

We loved this salad. I made it twice this weekend.  I added candied sliced almonds...  just add almond slices to a frying pan and lightly sugar the almonds,  add a few drops of water to this slowly and let it cook for a few minutes..  caramelizes to a crisp, sweet.  Very hot, be careful.  I also added the blue cheese, mentioned by other readers.   also..instead of using all that sugar, I substituted some honey for the sugar instead, which helped the dressing stick to the salad

Just made this salad for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  I will make this salad all the time now.  I also halved the sugar like others recommended and substituted Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar for White Vinegar.  Also, left out the seeds(I couldn't find them in the store) and used sliced almonds.  Delicious.

Excellent Salad that brought rave reviews. Per others suggestions, I decreased the sugar by half. I only had red wine vinegar, so I used that. Dressing was tasty with just the right amount of sweetness for the salad. I served the dressing on the side. I added mandarin oranges, red onion and pecans!!!! Great salad!!!! Thanks Jerry.
Update: I tried the dressing with the raspberry balsamic vinegar and it was wonderful. I did increase the vinegar to a half cup and reduced the sugar in half. I think it could have used more sugar, but it was still a wonderful dressing and salad. I continue to add mandarin oranges, pecans and red onions. Great Salad!!!

I hate to be the critic...  But I'm going to be completely honest.  The taste was a 4 star, but I could only eat a few bites of this salad.  I followed the recipe exactly.

First, it wasn't until I got into the recipe that I realized that this recipe took everything that was healthy about raw spinach and strawberries and turned it into a complete heart attack equating to McDonald's food on a bad day.

Literally, you are putting 1 full cup of super high fat oil mixed with sugar all over some healthy raw spinach and good healthy sweet fruit.  

Normally when I eat spinach salad, which is daily, I can eat a full plate of raw spinach with about 2 teaspoons of Italian dressing.  The whole thing is under 200 calories.  This recipe is immensely high fat and high sugar.

 Anyhow, I could only eat about 4 bites until I felt like "ugg".  I'm laying back now with my sugar rush feeling bad.  If I eat plain raw spinach with Italian, I feel like a million bucks.

I would highly consider re-doing this recipe.  The strawberries are a very nice touch, but all the sugar is a nightmare.

This is my opinion, and I do feel that we as a society eat way too much sugar.  This recipe is an example of how something very healthy is turned into a completely unhealthy meal.

I'm sorry, but I did think the flavor itself is 4 to 5 stars, but then again, oil + sugar taste good with anything.  Just like fried anything tastes good.

I have made this for years and it is always a huge hit.  For the dressing I use 1/4 cup oil, 2 T. sugar, 2 T. vinegar, 1/2 t. salt, and ground red pepper to taste.  I often add mandarin oranges and fresh blueberries.  Sugared almonds are a great addition as well.  Great with grilled steaks and chicken.  Thanks for all the great ideas for other variations!

This is an excellent salad.  Instead of regular vinegar I tried Balsamic vinegar and it turned out fantastic.   Also the recipe doesn't tell you to let the dressing refrigerate before serving.  That is necessary to blend the flavors.

Not what I expected at all!  Even my boyfriend, who was making faces the entire time I made this, liked it.  I used half the sugar, red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added red onions and pecans.  I will make this again!

Excellent salad - light and delicious. I forgot to add the sesame and poopy seeds and it was still great. Sounds funky but everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Great recipe for kids as they scarf it right up and don't realize it's good for them! *** Spinach leaves wllt quickly so make it as close to serving as possible! ***

A friend introduced us to this about a year ago, and I use variations on this recipe all the time to "wow!" guests.  In addition to the recipe shown here, I've mixed the baby spinach and salad dressing with fresh mandarin oranges and toasted almonds - a nice classy dish to cut the taste of an accompanying spicy meal.  This is a sure-fire winner!

Great recipe, and it's the first I've save to my recipe box ;).  Here are my adjustments:

1. I used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar

2. I used half the amount of sugar based on others recommendations

3. I added candied almonds... who doesn't love a little nut added to the mix?  I followed the recipe suggestion from another comment.

4. I added red pepper flakes... I like it spicy

5. I halfed the salad dressing recipe and added balsamic vinegar to the other half so that I could experience both... I preferred the one with balsamic vinegar

6.  This recipe is nothing without the poppy seeds ;). I had this sort of recipe at my wedding with a creamy poppy seed dressing and it was a hit!

And just to add... for all of the people that comment and say they hate when people adjust the recipe, I'm one of those that lives in the comments.  I'd prefer to see how people adjust, change and make the recipe their own.  It's what makes this site and the recipe soooo much better!

Enjoy.

I didn't have the sesame seeds so I doubled the poppy seeds.  Delicious.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and add some muddled strawberries to the dressing so there's some strawberry juiciness in addition to the strawberry chunks in the salad.

I used equal parts sugar, vinegar and oil and it was PERFECT! Definitely use Raspberry Balsamic vinegar and olive oil for the best taste. You can even add a dash of sesame oil to enhance the sesame flavor. I don't like Poppy Seeds, so I omitted them and it was just fabulous. I've also added grilled chicken and shredded mozzarella to make it a whole meal and WOW! I've made this for everyone I know... Yum yum yum!

Yummy, but it got soggy after a while at my work's potluck. I would put the dressing, strawberries and spinach in a separate container and refridgerate them... then combine them right before serving.

I made this salad for a dinner party the other night and it was very tasty.  This makes alot and as others stated, it does begin to wilt once you add the dressing, so next time I make this, I will use only one bag of  baby spinach.  I also added some fine sliced red onion, gorgonzola cheese, and honey roasted walnut pieces.  I also used olive oil and only 1/4 cup sugar.  Makes a nice presentation.  I also think this would be good to eliminate the spinach and use romaine lettuce instead.

Acutally we've been eating this for years; it is soooo delicious. My recipe varies slightly: it adds a few dashes of Worchestershire and some minced green onion in with the dressing. I like to use sesame oil and rice wine vinegar to give it an oriental flair. Mix the dressing in a jar and refrigerate, and you can use it as you need it. It's also great on field greens or if you use mandarine oranges instead of strawberries.

I already loved spinach salad, but could not believe how much better it was witht he strawberries.  This is great and a slightly lower fat recipe with the bacon left out.

Simply Delicious!!!  I cannot begin to tell you how good this salad was.  I love fresh fruit in my salads, so I tossed in some fresh diced pears along with the strawberries. Instead of spinach I used a bag of gourmet salad greens. I didn't have the sesame seeds so I left them out and added a tsp of onion powder to the dressing.  I sprinkled a bag of roasted parmesan almonds on top (you know...those new almond toppers that you can buy at the store), and they were TERRIFIC with this salad.  I highly recommened this one.  Can't wait to make this again when I visit my mom back home.  Great recipe Jerry!

My favorite!  I love this!  We had it for Easter dinner and our company thought I was a gourmet cook!  It was so pretty in a clear glass bowl.  I heat the dressing before adding the seeds to melt the sugar and then cool it in the freezer.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This salad has great flavor.  The sweetness of the strawberries is really great.  The only thing is the dressing is VERY oil based.  Maybe next time I make it I will use a 1/3 cup of oil instead of a 1/2, or maybe try olive oil instead of vegetable (or actually the canola oil I used. )  Overall though this is really great salad with dinners.

Delicious salad.  I prepared this for a dinner party earlier this week and it was a HUGE hit!  I took the suggestions of others, and used balsamic vinegar and the dressing was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this one!
**Update 12/03-I made this again for a Holiday Party and used mandarin oranges and walnuts instead of the strawberries.....soooo good.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  You cannot go wrong with this!  You can "Healthy it Up" by using EVOO and Splenda, just as good.  I don't always use all the dressing.  Just enough to taste.  Otherwise, it can get a little too soggy.

When I first saw this at a party I thought, "what a combination, yuck!".  I love strawberries & like spinach so I gave it a try.  I am now a hugh fan of this!!!  Now I think, "WHAT A COMBINATION, YUM!!"  I use balsamic vinegar & it's even better!  Give it a try!!

This was ok, but I probably wouldn't make it again. I added toasted walnuts. Used the Brianna's blush dressing instead of mixing up the one in the recipe, but I did add the sesame seeds & poppy seeds to the dressing.

I made this salad a few times and I think it turned out great! A lot of people wrote saying they used rasberry basalmic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, but I used the white wine vinegar and I think the salad still turned out awesome. I also didn't use as much sugar as it says to in the recipe because it seemed like way too much.

Very easy recipe. I didn't have paprika so I used cloves, I switched the vinegar to balsamic and used olive oil. So I made it a little more italian. I have had this original recipe though and it is terrific. Thank you!

I shared this salad with a friend who is fighting cancer.  She is working hard to avoid sugars right now and this salad was adaptable.  She enjoyed her own dressing and her family enjoyed the recipe dressing.  And the strawberries gave it just a touch of sweet for her enjoyment.

I have never taken this anywhere that I have not been asked for the recipe.  The only thing I do differently is melt 1/2C white sugar and brown almond slivers in it to add to the salad for an extra kick and some crunchiness.  The only downfall to this salad is it must be eaten just after dressing; it's not good leftover.  Great for summer potlucks or patio entertaining!

I cut down on sugar as I don't like things too sweet. Only change I made. I thought the dressing was "flat". Wondered what all the fuss was about. Finally I realized it had NO salt in the dressing. The next time I made it I added some salt and what a difference!  Loved it. I read many reviews and no one mentioned adding salt, so maybe it's just me.

I made this for a family holiday party, picking it because it sounded healthy and because it was mainly green & red... and it was a huge hit, even with family members who usually turn their noses up at my healthy vegetable contributions. It was really delicious!

If you want to be the star of the party, take this salad!  Best of all it is so adaptable to taste and ingredients on hand.  Make it a meal with chicken or steak.  I've added gorgonzola, bacon, red/green onions, almonds/walnuts, the list goes on.  As far as the dressing I like to use only 2 packets of splenda and a tablespoon of sesame oil.  Thanks for the post, Jerry!

I loved this salad, it is such a nice change.  I used the advice of others and added walnuts, feta cheese, and red opnion rings.

I also took the advice of others on the dressing and used balsalmic vinegar (I love it), and chose to omit the sesame seeds, and poppy seeds as I did not have any.

The dressing was a bit too granular for me so next time I will use less sugar.

This is a great summer recipe - a wonderful change from a normal salad.

This was simply fantastic...the perfect summer salad!  Here are my tweaks:  1) Cut the amount of sugar in half  2) Skip the seeds  3) Use raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and 4) add sliced toasted almonds and feta crumbles

DELICIOUS!!!

I made this for the work potluck.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't bring enough!  Vinegar nice contrast to strawberries.  I only used half the spinach. BIG mistake.  It made it a bit soggy in the end.  Definately use 2 bunches.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I took out the sesame seeds and the poppy seeds and added in freshly toasted pecans that I did a quick maple syrup glaze on. (Very simple - put pecans in pan and toast for 1 minute then add in a bit of maple syrup to coat. Stir  to combine for 1 minute and let cool). Everything else was the same as the recipe called for.  Everyone LOVED it!!!!

Since I did not follow the recipe exactly, I probally should not review.  I used the recipe as a start and only changed a couple of things.  I did not add the paprika, but used balsamic vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  I also added fresh cut up oranges and walnuts.  this salad was to die for.  Such a refreshing change to have with a meal.  I was so pleased with the outcome I am making it again for Easter.  I made the dressing the night before and just let it set covered on the countertop and then drizzled it over the individual salad right before serving.  You really must try it, but be ready to be hooked.

Nice to have a spinach salad recipe without a lot of bacon and cheese.  Way too much sugar in this one tho; I don't really think it needs any, maybe a tablespoon or so.

I made this exactly as posted. However the dressing was horrible. The sugar was WAY too much and it wouldn't mix or dissolve whatsoever. I ended up remaking it myself.  The listed recipe was useless and gets 2 stars.  I was almost out of the white wine vinegar however so I used half white wine vinegar, half white cooking wine. I also used agave nectar instead of the sugar. Didn't measure it out just added it, tried it then added a bit more. MY version of the dressing was great and everyone loved it!

Onion and pecans were added to this first try.  There's a little bit of cheese crumbles and balsamic dressing.  I had this once and thought it tasted delicious.  Croutons round out the flavors.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I did change it abit our family doesn't like poppy seeds so i took those out of the dressing and just add some sunflower seeds to the salad. In the dressing I only used oil, apple cider vingar and white sugar and it turned out amazing!

Excellent!!  I do reduce the sugar to 1/3C as others have suggested;  just a little too sweet for me.  I did use canola oil instead of vegetable oil and substituted red wine vinegar for the white.  I also added sweet candied pecans and chunks of blue cheese.  One of my favorite salads!  It's a simple recipe that can be altered to suite anyone's personal tastes!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I had girlfriends for lunch and they couldn't get enough of the salad.  We could have just made this our lunch!  I'm going to try and cut up some rotesserie chicken and add it to the salad next time.......Try it you'll love it!

Really good. Recipe makes a lot of dressing ( in my opinion).  I could've added more spinach to soak it up.

This recipe is good and the poppy seeds are a nice touch.  It uses a lot of sugar and I just ended up substituting honey for some of the sugar.  Would be good with lemon juice instead of vinegar in the dressing.

This recipe is amazing!! I didn't use the seeds, but instead used crushed pecans. I used the full amount of sugar for the dressing (though many reviewers said not to) and thought it was perfect, but I do have a major sweet tooth! ;) I also used balsamic raspberry vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.
I tossed together organic baby spinach, the sliced strawberries and pecans. I put the dressing into a bottle so we could pour it on our salads right before eating. I think that works better than mixing it all together, that way if there is some leftover it will last awhile in the fridge. I think next time I will try EVOO in place of the vegetable oil to make it a bit healthier!

This is such a delicious salad!!!  My whole family loves it, and it's great for holidays or just any day.  It's incredibly easy to make too.  Though once I cut the sugar in half and it didn't taste as good, but made the way it's shown, it's really an amazing salad.

This is a tasty, refreshing salad.  Next time, however, I will cut the sugar in half as others suggested.  It was just a little too sweet.

This was a lovely looking salad.  I did change it quite a bit though.  I added toasted slivered almonds and thinly sliced red onions.  And I used a balsamic vinagrette for the dressing, as I didn't want it to be too sweet.  The final result was delicious.

I used only 1/4 cup oil, sugar, and vinegar and left out the seeds for the kids.  I cut the strawberries in half instead of slicing and added chucks of watermelon and blueberries.  Fantastic!

I made this today to bring with me to a baby shower. It was gone before I even had a chance to taste it. I have never made it before, thought I would try my luck, and it was perfect.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.  So, I have extra strawberries left to try this myself. Based on a empty dish, I would say definately 5 stars, didn't change a thing. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a GREAT salad!  I have been making one very similar with a few exceptions.  Add blue cheese!  I know it dosen't sound great...I don't even LIKE Blue cheese, but it is so good in this salad!!!  Also, add  crushed walnuts.  In the dressing, I only put 1/4 cup sugar, everything else the same, and added 2-3 dashes worcestershire sauce.  Please try this, you'll love it this way!!!!!!!  I made it for a gourmet dinner (very pretty presentation) and also took it to a tennis match.  Everyone will ask for the recipe!

Great salad!  As others recommended, I halved the sugar, used balsamic vinegar, omitted the poppy and sesame seeds and added chopped pecans.  My husband and I both loved it.

This is delicious and simple. I hate when people rate the recipe based on a ton of modifications; however, I did decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup, which seemed just right to me. I can't imagine it with the full amount in the recipe. 

When I made it a second time, I further decreased the oil by half (calorie-counting) and used olive oil (a "healthy" oil on my Weight Watchers). I also used balsamic vinegar rather than white due to personal preference.

In conclusion, I think the recipe is wonderful as it is (with half the sugar), but it's easy to make modifications and still come up with something terrific.

Excellent salad! I took this salad to Easter dinner as my contribution to the meal,and it was a big hit. The dressing was so easy to make-I used Raspberry Champagne vinegar.It gave the dressing a gorgeous red color and the sugar in the dressing really brought out the sweetness in the strawberries. I didn't used the poppy seeds, but instead used sliced almonds,which added crunch and texture.Also, I used 1/2 baby salad greens and 1/2 spinach.I've already made a 2nd batch of the dressing for my family to eat here at home, and its just great. I plan to make this again and again. Thanks for a wonderful,easy and colorful salad thats also good for you! :)

Followed the recipe exactly.  Not a fan.  Most reviewers modified this recipe.  Should have done the same.  Don't like the vegetable oil in the dressing.  I tried the dressing with half the sugar as suggested first and the vinegar taste was too strong, so then I added the full amount of sugar and it was an improvement.  The salad was somewhat bland.  Maybe feta cheese or goat cheese would have helped.  Will substitute olive oil and possibly balsamic vinegar if I try this again.  Maybe add toasted almonds.  Bottom line: I recommend modifying the recipe.

I didnt care for the dressing with this salad.. used red wine vingerette.  But, the hubby was the opposite, he loved the dressing!  Made the salad and tossed with the dressing right before serving.  Did not refrigerate the dressing based on other reviews.  Probably wont make again as its not to my liking.. but the husband really did like it!

Great recipe.  I also add blueberries and blackberries if I have on hand.  And sometimes some feta cheese.  The dressing is amazing.

I've been using this recipe for several years as my standby salad recipe.  I usually don't have sesame seeds on hand and I flip-flop the oil (I use olive) and vinegar (red wine vinegar).  I make the dressing ahead and let the strawberries marinate in the dressing...unsweetened frozen strawberries can easily be used when you make it this way.  Just pour the dressing over the spinach immediately prior to serving!

I made this salad for the first time tonight and took it to a BBQ where I did not know half the people. This salad was a huge hit. I had several people ask me for the recipe and the host informed me that many others were asking her for the recipe as well. I followed many others tips. I used two bags of bagged spinach leaves that I tore into smaller peices,a 2 pound container of strawberries, a handful of both feta and blue cheese chunks, 1 bag of real bacon pieces (in the salad topping isle),1 bag glazed walnuts (I chopped them up), 1/2 a red onion chopped, and I used balsamic vinegerette(sp?) in place of the white vineger. I had to use double the dressing and I poured it over the top and tossed it a good hour before the BBQ. Great Salad!

What more can be said?  This is a wonderful taste combination that is easy to throw together and helps get you to that 5-a-day goal!  I used red wine vinegar and it was equally wonderful!  My husband, who "hates" veggies raved about this one to his friends (who all looked at him like he was crazy...)

I did NOT have good luck with this recipe. I've made it twice now, and the same thing happened.  The spinach  got very soggy, even though I added the dressing at the last minute.  I think it might be a problem I have in drying the spinach leaves. I bought fresh bunches of spinach, and washed them thoroughly and dried them in a salad spinner.  I tried to dry the leaves, but they never got really dry, rather they became wilted. I added the sliced strawberries, candied sliced almonds, minced red onion, and poppy seeds.  Then I added the dressing.  I must be doing something wrong, because I seem to be the only person with this problem. If I can't figure out what I did wrong, I will not make this salad again.  What a shame, sounds like everyone else has not had the same experience. I'd love to hear from anyone on this.  Thanks.

Excellent!!!  I have made this several times now, for a couple different sets of company, and everyone has loved it!  Very easy to make, pretty presentation, so wonderfully nutritious, and absolutely delicious!  Spinach and strawberries are SO healthy!  I feel so good eating it!  The only thing I do differently is I serve the dressing on the side, in a gravy boat with ladle, so the salad doesn't get soggy.  This makes it much, much better for leftovers as well (I always make a double batch now, as it is great to eat for days after, though the dressing must be mixed up again before each serving).

I made this for dinner last night - with a few revisions- and my family went wild for it!  I only used 1 tbl. of sesame seeds and no paprika (didn't have any on hand).  I added 1/4 vanilla to the dressing (I'm not sure what inspired that!)and added 2 chicken breasts (boneless, skinless) that I grilled and sliced thin.  Served the salad with warm foccacia bread and a chilled white wine - yum! Made a great summer meal.

This salad was excellent!  I made it for a party, and everyone loved it.  It was perfect for a spring/summer salad.  I cut down on the oil and sugar and used balsamic vinegar and it worked great!  I also sliced the strawberries the night before with an egg slicer and it made them a little softer and sweeter.  Thank you!!!

I have heard of salads like this but have always been a little skeptical of trying them.  BUT, I made this one for a family gathering and I loved it as well as all of my family!!  So sweet and refreshing and such a switch from your everyday garden salad!  Loved it!!

this is a light lunch or a side salad. I liked the combo. I sprinkled the poppy and sesame seed directly on my salad. the dressing had nice flavor but I used 0 calorie sweetener. I also crumbled a couple pinches of feta, just for a flavor contrast
I will make that again.

Very tasty and easy to throw together but way too sweet. I would halve the sugar next time like other reviewers had suggested and perhaps try raspberry balsamic vinegar also. This recipe is a keeper with the above tweaks.

You won't be sorry! I am very funny about fruit being mixed together with food but this was DELICIOUS! I did not have sesame seeds or poppy seeds and I ran out of sugar so I didn't use quite 1/2 cup and it was to out of this world! I can't imagine what it would taste like if I had all the ingredients. To make up for not having the seeds I added sugared pecans to the top. Made this for church and people were scraping the bowl. One man said it was more like dessert than a salad. Those of you who are concerned about making things healthier, use less sugar or use the dressing on the side. This is definitely a must especially now that strawberries are in season. Excellent!

Can I give this 5 stars, even if I did make a couple small changes?  I sure hope so, because this was fantastic!  I used only 1/4 c sugar, balsamic vinegar, and used a combination of spinach and arugula (maybe 1/4 arugula).  The combination of the sweet taste of the strawberry with the slightly peppery taste of the arugula, topped with that fantastic dressing was to die for - and that is from my husband, who doesn't like sweet dressings!  I do think I will decrease the sugar even a tad bit more (maybe a couple tsp to start?), as my son (who definitely has a sweet tooth) commented that I should try less sugar next time.  Thanks for a wonderful addition to the recipe box!

Well, this was good.  What’s not to like?  But it really lacked pizzazz.  I thought the salad could use some green onions, which I added.  But additionally next time I would add maybe some feta and definitely something with crunch, perhaps toasted almonds or pecans.  I noticed that most reviewers who gave this 5 stars added their own embellishments, which I agree it needs.  I also don’t think the dressing needs quite so many seeds, next time I will reduce.  And be sure to toast your sesame seeds (350 degrees for about 8 minutes, until golden) to increase their flavor.

Made this for a church potluck. Delicious! It was a big hit. Didn't use the sesame seeds because I didn't have any and used regular white vinegar but it was perfect. Next time will reduce the sugar.

Nice fresh salad. Great for summer. The dressing was mild, had a nice little tang from the vinegar. I liked the crunch from the poppy and sesame seeds. The dressing seemed a bit too oily though so maybe next time I'll use half and see how it turns out. I used balsamic vinegar because it was right in the very front of all the other vinegars in my pantry and it sounded good.

This was just light and yummy!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, though.  I used olive oil, balsamic vinegar, splenda, and a drizzle of sesame oil.  I didn't have the seeds, so they were omitted.  We have never had anything like it, but we all thought it was good.  Even my carnivore husband liked it.  He wasn't crazy about it, but he said it was good.  LOL

only 3 stars cause - it's a salad that you can make at any salad bar.  the dressing was to sweet for me and the suger never really dissolved so was a little gritty - i'll just stick w/ my balsamic vinegrette - but don't get me wrong - this was a great salad - just...not really a recipe

We LOVED this salad!  I didn't have poppy seeds, but it was terrific anyway. :)  Served it with a spicy glazed salmon and they complimented each other well.

I like salads that look fresh.  The first time I made this, I made the mistake of adding the dressing right away.  By the time I got to work, I had an unsightly bowl of mush that was unfit to serve because the vinegar and oil wilted the spinach.  Now, I make a point to add the dressing right when I'm ready to serve it or even leave it on the side and let people add their own.

I found this to be a little on the sweet side. It wasn't bad but I would prefer it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and cutting back on the sugar to a couple of tsp (or to taste) since the balsamic is sweet enough on its own. I also added a little worcestire sauce for a little kick. I let the dressing sit on the counter for a while and occasionally stirred it till the sugar dissolved.

This salad is quick and simple but has big taste! Cut the sugar in half and feel free to sub red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar. I have even substituted cider vinegar with out regrets! Easy, summery and delicious!

Absolutly delicious! I made it without the sesame and poppy seeds because I didn't  have any and followed the advice of others on adding caramelized almonds and blue cheese. Definatly add these to the salad! I also substituted white wine vinegar with balsamic vinegrette and used a mix of greens instead of spinach (just 'cause that's what I had at home).  If you're not into sweet just skip the caramel. I will be making this salad very often for sure and I can't wait to make it for my friends who will be coming for Easter.

For Easter dinner, if I had just made this salad instead of the ham and the million other things, no one would have noticed.  HUGE HIT!!!  The only change I made was that I used balsalmic vinegar  (a little more than was called for) and I added feta cheese.  Had to print out the recipe twice as it was repeatedly requested.    The next day, since I had extra dressing, strawberries and spinach, for a different taste, I added blue cheese crumbles and bacon.  OMG... delish!!  Could also add mandarin oranges...   One more thing... I made the dressing a day ahead of time to made sure that all the flavors marinated together.  FABULOUS!!

Prepared this on the weekend for 60 people. We used a greens mixture of romaine lettuce, baby spinach and spring greens that was left from a dinner on Friday evening. We also added fresh blueberries, dried cranberries and almond slivers. It was one of the popular salads at the luncheon.

I made this last night and my family loved it.  I did cut down the sugar as others suggested as well. I didn't have sesame seed or poppy seed and no one seemed to miss them.  I will definitely add some type of nut next time.  Great recipe thanks!Update 6/9, I have made this several times now, always a hit!!!!  I add 1 can of drained mandarin oranges as well as 1 cup of nut topping, never disappointed!!! Update 5/8  added craisons this time was great once again!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I use apple cider vinegar instead of the white and added about a teaspoon of onion. For the dressing, the easiest way to mix is to put everything in the blender. The extra dressing I store in a mason jar in the fridge. When I'm ready to use it again, I put it in the microwave for 10 seconds to bring it back to the original consistancy (won't be paste-like anymore).

Delish!  I made the dressing with 1/4 cup of sugar because 1/2 just seemed toooooo much.  Even with 1/4 c sugar- it was still too sweet- next time I'll cut it down further.  The salad itself was DELICIOUS!  I put a little bit of red onion and a little bit of feta cheese into the salad and it was beyond yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!
YUM!

This salad was delicious!  I used honey instead of sugar, added 5oz of crumbled feta and half of a small red onion.  The flavors were wonderful together.  I did not have poppyseeds so I did not use them when I made it.

Yum!!!! But I made a few changes of course.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because I don't like wine vinegars.  I also added some mango slices.  
And I can't understand why anyone would want to make such a refreshing and delightful salad and then drown it in oil.  I followed the recipe for the amounts for all the dressing ingredients except for the oil.  I only used 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil and that was just fine.  I'll probably only use 1 tablespoon next time.  I also used splenda instead of sugar.

GREAT!  Didn't really measure the spinach or strawberries, just put together what seemed right for the amount of guests I had, (what is "2 bunches" of spinach anyway?)  I think I used about 13oz. spinach and 2 pints strawberries and that served about 8 people.  The dressing was more than enough, even using half the amount of oil, (I used 1/4 cup olive oil.)  For the vinegar I used raspberry vinegar, followed the rest exactly.  I made the recipe for "Glazed Nuts" on this site, as suggested in another review- great advice!

This salad was fabulous!  The only thing that I did differently was I added Honey roasted almond slivers for a little crunch!  My husband is not a salad fan and he said "A salad should not taste this good."  Well said honey!

I have made this recipe a bunch of times and it's always VERY well-received!  You can substitute other summer fruits for the strawberries -- I've used peaches, and they're great too.

I thought I would love this recipe since I am a huge fan of strawberries, spinich, AND vinigarette type dressings. Although I followed the recipe to a T, I didn't like the taste of the dressing at all. It tasted rancid (I used FRESH ingredients bought from the store since I didn't have them), and chewing on raw spinich gave my mouth a chalky feeling. Spinich is good in a salad if it is not used as the primary green source. It was a pretty salad though...

This is a terrific salad and it is very pretty also. I've made a similar one that calls for a bit of asian sesame oil in the dressing which really pushes the flavor up to 5 stars.

This is great for the holidays! I use craisins instead of strawberrys and some fine minced red onion, also some crumbled feta or goat cheese, this bowl is always empty! It does make more dressing than you need, so you have extra for a salad with all the leftovers.

I doubted that this recipe would be good but once I tried it, I can’t stop eating it! I invited my girlfriend and she loved it!. Thank you!!! I'm 19. At my age spinach isn't popular... But you did a great job.

Excellent salad, but a bit sweet, so I cut the sugar to half. If you mix the sugar and strawberries beforehand, and let them chill, the sugar brings out the flavor of the strawberries a bit. Fresh strawberries are best, frozen ones just aren't the same.

This is great in the summer. Refreshing and delicious.  I do not use paprika and I stir in toasted slivered almonds into the salad to give it an extra kick.

Fantastic. Hubby was skeptical but ended up loving it! Used balsamic vinegar, left out the seeds and added about 1/4 of a large onion, diced. We loved it and didn't think it was too sweet.

I made this today for Easter my son said it was the best part of the meal and  he does not eat raw spinach. The whole family loved it. I only use 1/4 cup sugar and delicate olive oil. It came out amazing. I will make this weekly.

Fantastic salad. I used store-bought poppyseed dressing and it was still great. I also added walnut pieces on top, along with a mango and pear.

This is so good!  Seconds were had by all.  I used raw brown sugar turbinado, and added some chopped smokehouse almonds.  Sweet and salty is a winning combo.  Next time I'll add some thin sliced red onion, maybe a dash of cayenne to the dressing.

I make this weekly and keep very close to the original recipe, excet I add 1/4 t of lea and Perins worst. Sauce.
(It's adds a depth and seems bland with out it)
A wonderful protein to add is boiled shrimp. The sweetness of the shrimp works really well.

This is a favorite of mine during the summer and is always a hit at every party I bring it to.  I use balsamic instead of white vinegar and have added feta cheese a few times for a twist.  My only big suggestion is that this salad wilts VERY fast so do not put the dressing on until you are ready to serve.

I liked this salad; the dressing was a little sweet for my taste and it got very thick after I refrigerated it. I ended up adding a little bit of Newmann's Own Balsamic Dressing to it, and the combo was terrific. I also added some chopped red onion and feta cheese - they went great with the other flavors and kicked the salad up a notch. It would also be nice with almonds or toasted pecans added. You can really suit this recipe to your own tastes - keep it simple or jazz it up. We'll make it again.

Very easy and absolutely Delicious!  I used 1/4 agave syrup (low glycemic index)  in place of the sugar, added almond slices, and garnished with blue cheese.  I also followed another review and used raspberry balsamic vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.  It turned out very sweet and tangy.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is a really good salad!  A little too sweet for me as written - I usually use about half as much sugar.  Also, toasted almonds sprinkled on top (about 3/4 cup) takes away some of the sweetness & really makes this salad.

Excellent salad.  I used a light olive oil as I wanted monounsaturated fats; the dressing was not at all overpowering and the spinach and strawberry flavors are excellent.

Fab salad, was a big hit.... used majority of ingredients except for I added sliver honey roasted almonds, black raspberries, and artisian salad. I used Kraft light Rasp Vinegrette, then added paprika, poppy seeds and sesame to it. SUPER EASY, SUPER GOOD!

My family practically licked the bowl clean!  Made this for Easter dinner, and even those who usually refuse to touch spinach with a 10 foot pole gobbled it up!  I even brought some to work for breakfast the next day and made my co-workers jealous!  It looks so fancy, yet is super simple and can be put together in the time it takes you to slice the strawberries.

Couple of things I changed - lowered the sugar by half (with the strawberries, it needs a more tart dressing, not so sweet).  Then sprinkled candied almonds (adds much needed crunchy texture) and crumbled feta cheese on top!  Also, tried balsamic vinegar in lieu of white wine vinegar - gave a totally different flavor to it.  

In the end, this salad is addictive!  So good, so healthy, and so easy.....  no reason you can't make it once a month... once a week?.... is once a day going too far??  :)

Made this for my family on Easter, so good! It's a perfect spring/summer time salad and so much better than a boring plain salad. I used a little less sugar than the recipe asked for & I added mandarin oranges & toasted almonds. I will definitely be saving this recipe!

I omitted the sugar, oil, paprika and instead used store bought raspberry vinagrette dressing.  The brand I bought had slivered walnuts in it.  Also added small chunks of feta cheese.

Made this for lunch today.  It was awesome!!! Instead of homemade dressing I did use store bought Litehouse Raspberry Walnut Vinigarette and it was perfect.  I added some grilled chicken, a sprinkle of feta cheese crumbles, a little red onion, and Diamond brand sweet coated walnuts for crunch and flavor. I've found my new favorite salad for warm weather!

I loved this salad, my husband thought it was a little too sweet but still ate a HUGE portion! I made it with Balsamic Vinegar since that was all I had and added red onions and it came out wonderful! Great for summer with something grilled!

I just made this for Easter Dinner.  Family and friends LOVED it!!!  There were no leftovers.  I wasn't sure how much "2 bunches" of spinach was, I used a 10oz package of fresh spinach and it worked out great.

Loved this! During the summer (when strawberries are sweetest) it is a fabulous salad to take to work for lunch or add chicken, onions and walnuts and it's dinner.

I have a bit of a dislike for salads but this came out great...I used baby spinach leaves whole instead of torn up and a little less sugar for the vinegrette. I toasted some walnuts in our conventional toaster and used some cut up apples along with the strawberries for a little bit of a frutier taste
Great Summer Salad!

Perfect! I made it for 12 servings and it was way more than enough for a buffet for 30 people. Next time I will keep it at 8 servings. (Our pot-luck family gatherings have tons of food.) I think some people would just not try it because of the strawberries. They missed out!

One of the best salads I have ever had. Everyone at Easter wanted to know what was in the dressing. I used splenda instead of sugar and it was plenty sweet. No other substitutions. Will make year round!

i found the salad per the recipe to be OK, but the dressing is fantastic!  very easy to make and really good with any greens.  to perk up the salad part, i add dried cranberries, almonds and grapes - combining more flavours makes it more interesting

I will agree with everyone else that this is wonderful!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was still great!  I wish the supermarkets would sell regular fresh spinach instead of the little baby leaves, but that's just me.  Very nice salad!

This is excellent.  I  make this often now.  Its a great way to get kids to eat spinach.  My five year old asks for it.  I throw in unsalted sunflower kernels too for a nutty taste.  Love it.  I do cut the sugar in half and have made it with 6 packs of splenda instead too if you are watching sugar.

Hubby who had a phobia about raw spinach gave this 5 stars!!!! I used a spring mix and baby spinach.  Wonderful!!! He had roasted some peanuts earlier in the day and we added the peanuts to salad.  I used a balsamic vinegar.  Could not find raspberry balsamic vinegar as someone else had suggested but will keep looking for the next time I make this.  Will definitely add chicken and almonds also.


Update: I have made this so many times now.  Just made the dressing with the raspberry balsamic vinegar.  So good.  I also added walnuts this time.  I made enough dressing that I have some on hand in the refrig for future eating.  This dressing is sooo good I could drink it.  It is addicting.  I did cut back on the sugar and used half Splenda and half sugar.  I also used frozen strawberries tonight and blended in the blender and it came out wonderful.

I thought this recipe was good. I did  make a few changes though.  I toasted the sesame  seeds and decreased the sugar to 1/4 of a cup and used raspberry wine vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  And I toasted sliced almonds to put on top. Yummy!  Thank you.

I served this, along with several quiches, for a Christmas luncheon for 12 elderly ladies.  They raved about it.  The only thing I changed was that I added glazed walnuts, another great recipe (Glazed Nuts) from this site.

This was absolutely delicious, light, and so healthy.  The colors were so vibrant and made for a beautiful salad.  I halved the recipe.  Thanks for all the helpful reviews.  I did add a couple of strawberries to the dressing and whipped it all up in the food processor.  I added slices of red onion, and toasted walnuts, and toasted the sesame seeds.  I kept the spinach seperate and made each salad.  There was no wilting of the spinach at all this way.  Per the reviews stating that the dressing was too sweet, since I halved the recipe, I used 1/4 cup EVOO, and 2 tbsp. of balsamic vinegar.  I like balsamic for its mild acidity and sweetness.  I added the sweetener last and added enough just to my personal taste.  I used sweetener in lieu of sugar and couldn't tell the difference.  This is so refreshing and the colors are wonderful!  I suggest adding the sugar at the end to taste.

I added strips of grilled chicken and almond slivers.  Overall EXCELLENT!!!  I would recommend not putting on the dressing until just before serving.

I substituted frozen blueberries for the strawberries and added some of the juice from the blueberries once they thawed to the dressing.  It was delicious and I got a lot of compliments.  The salad overall was on the sweet side but it certainly wasn't sickening and I thought it was a perfect balance with the spinach.

I used balsamic vinegar and Splenda vs sugar.  This is a great salad and each time I've served it for guests, I've gotten great reviews!  Quick and easy to prepare.

I used 1/3 cup of oil (canola oil was all I had)...and cut the sugar down to a 1/4 cup.  I also used white basalmic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  I threw in a small package of slivered almonds (would of been better if I'd toasted them, but I was lazy)...like about 1/4-1/3 cup.

This was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Totally Awesome Recipie!!!  I made as directed except substituted Splenda for sugar, balsamic vinegar for white wine vinegar and walnuts for the sesame and poppy seeds (due to diet restrictions) and it turned out great!  I can't believe how absolutely wonderful it tasted...For those of you who think this sounds like a weird combination of ingredients, you need to give this recipe a try...I'm so glad I did! I will be making this recipie a lot this summer!

Everytime I make this recipe a HUGE HIT...don't dress the salad in advance- I bring the dressing seperate..and dress RIGHT BEFORE serving...everything is DELICIOUS and not wilted....always get asked for the recipe...the only thing we add is a little red onion - it helps cut the sweetness a little...bring it to parties a lot....Thanks!!!

Great blend of tastes. The slightly bitter taste of the spinach was balanced by the citrusy sweetness of the berries.  used 1/2 the sugar called for in the dressing and only used 1/2 the dressing. More woudl have overwhelmed it.

This recipe is absolutely outstanding!  The only thing I changed was the amount of oil.  I used only 1/4c in the interest of a "lighter" salad.
This salad has traveled to every backyard BBQ this year, and it gets alot of compliments.  Excellent!!!

I've made this with romaine lettuce or a spring mix salad and both are very yummy.  I also like to add sugar-toasted sliced almonds, a couple green onions, and mandarin oranges to this tasty salad.  I always get lots of compliments and it looks so beautiful in a wood salad bowl or on individual plates.

Loved this salad. The salad dressing was very good. I put all the ingredients in a blender and the consistency was perfect. Only addition I made to baby spinach and fresh strawberries was a small thinly sliced onion and some toasted almonds. Add the dressing just before putting it on the table. Looks beautiful too. Leftovers (which are few) get too soggy.  Will make this again.

Made this for a dinner party and I'm glad I made a double batch - WOW is this GREAT!!!.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and bagged baby spinach leaves - otherwise followed the receipe - and it was fabulous.  Took longer to stem and clean than to mix everything.  New favorite at our house! YUM!

Beautiful presentation and delicious dressing. The recipe "Strawberry Spinach Salad"(from this site) with the same ingredients then adds slivered almonds and chopped onion is even better!

Give me more, give me more. My family went nuts over this. Next time I am going to cut the sugar down a bit because my husband and I thought it was too sweet. The kids said keep it the way it was. Finally a way to get my daughter to eat spinach! She even wanted to take this in her lunch this morning. Think I am going to make it again tonight because it was so well received.

This is awesome!  My 2 year old and hubby who both say they don't like spinach gobbled this up.  OK, so my daughter did eat more strawberries than spinach, but hubby had 2 helpings!  Don't prepare this too far in advance, because the spinach shrinks down a lot (like when you cook it).

My husband is in the strawberry business, so I'm always looking for recipes that include
strawberries.  This salad is wonderful!  We invited another couple over for dinner and I thought
I'd try out this recipe.  I added sliced red onion, toasted pecans, and gorgonzola cheese.  I also used balsamic
vinegar for part of the white wine vinegar.  I didn't have poppy seeds so I left that out.  The couple we invited over
for dinner are gourmet cooks, and they said this was the BEST salad they've ever tasted.  I will definitely be making
this salad on a regular basis!

I made this salad for a Fourth of July party. EVERYONE loved it. I handed the recipe out to almost everyone their.  Some of the quest didn't even know they were eating spinach until I told them. They were in shock. Although, I did make some changes to the recipe. Instead of the seasame seed I used 1 can of manderian oranges(drained) and I used the red wine vinegar.  Wow!! What a great hit!   P.S. I also skipped on the paprika. Thanks Again!  Brenda Fodor

This salad is excellent. I used almonds in the salad because my family is not fond of sesame seeds or poppy seeds. I also used 1/2 the sugar as suggested by others. I could eat this salad every day!

I love this recipe. I make it at least once a week during the summer. However, I cut the sugar in half at least. I have found blueberry and cranberry goat cheese at the grocery store and that adds some amazing colour and flavour to it. I also toast some sliced toasted almonds which makes it even more delicous.

WONDERFUL SALAD!!!! Added thinly sliced Jicama, small cubes of cheddar cheese and some fresh raspberries along with the strawberries. Also served the dressing on the side so people could use the amount they wanted. Offered it along with a main dish of beef stroganoff and rice at our football party yesterday and there were NO leftovers!!!! Enjoy!

I have spent all summer eating this recipe. This is the absolute best salad recipe ever. I followed the recipe exactly except I always substitute raspberry balsamic vinegar for the rice wine vinegar. If you have never tried this recipe make sure you do. Thank you JerJer this has become a family favorite.

A great side dish for brunch. As other reviewers suggested, I used a raspberry balsamic vinegar and only about 1/4 the amount of recommended sugar. I admit that I actually considered buying store-bought raspberry dressing, but I'm glad I didn't. The dressing only takes 5 minutes and is delicious.

Just call us "Popeye the sailor man"! Toot, toot. Even my husband liked this recipe! I followed it exactly except for the poppy seeds, since I haven't found any in Korea yet. If only strawberries were available year round, then I would make this salad all the time. Who would have ever thought that strawberries and spinach are good together? I might try cutting the sugar in half next time just to try.

This was okay. It would make a pretty salad for a party, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste enough to want to make it regularly. Also, it called for far too many poppy and sesame seeds. You could probably cut that in half.

This salad is amazing...even my kids ate it and asked for more. I substituted extra virgin olive oil in the dressing for extra richness and healthy fats. 

To the person who wrote " I could only eat a few bites of this salad... I realized that this recipe took everything that was healthy about raw spinach and strawberries and turned it into a complete heart attack equating to McDonald's food on a bad day....This recipe is immensely high fat and high sugar. Anyhow, I could only eat about 4 bites until I felt like "ugg". I'm laying back now with my sugar rush feeling bad..." ::  YOU ONLY NEED ABOUT 2-3 TEASPOONS OF DRESSING ON AN ENTIRE HELPING IF THIS SALAD. ALL IN MODERATION, JUST AS WITH ANY SALAD DRESSING.

I just made this for my granddaughter's 5th birthday at a park.  I made the dressing with 1/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup raspberrry balsalmic vinegar, toasted sesame seeds, 1/4 tsp paprika and a little bit of vanilla.  The salad I used 2 bags baby spinach, 1 bag spring mix with spinach,  2 containers strawberries, 1 container blueberries, 1/2 red onion sliced thin and 1 package of honey goat cheese that I froze for 15 minutes that made it easier to cut into small pieces.  I also did the sliced almonds toasted in a hot pan with sugar and a little water.  It was really delicious and special, the dressing is amazing with paprika! It does something unique to bring it all together.   I read many of the comments and kind of used what I thought sounded good so thank you to those that posted feedback for your help in making it perfect for me!  :)  I layered it, bag of spinach, sprinkle of berries, cheese and almonds, repeat with spring mix, then one more layer of spinach, berries, goat cheese, almonds on top.  Served the dressing on the side with a little mason jar so the salad wouldn't get soggy.  Next time I will add the poppy seeds, just forgot them at the store this time.  Will make again and again, and share this one for sure!

The first time I made this, I followed the instructions exactly except for adding thinly sliced red onion. I give the original review 4 stars. Everyone liked it. I thought the dressing was a bit sweet and I like a bit more of a vinaigrette bite. The next time I made it, the only things I changed were to use apple cider vinegar and olive oil instead of white vinegar and vegetable oil. Kept all other measurements the same - now it is definitely 5 stars!! Yum!

We Loved this recipe! WE could not use sugar so instead we used agave... Which was great...Also i put chia seeds in it instead of sesame seeds.  And I put in nuts for a fun topping. Defiantly the best! If you are looking for a good spinach Strawberry Salad... this is the recipe....

I make it a point to try these recipes as written the first time, and then make my adjustments there after. Well, I didn't have regular vinagar and had already started so I used Balsamic in its place (making it an hour or so inadvance and fridging it). No other changes needed. Well Balanced, Light and oh so Flavorful!!! After the Wife's fourth bite she looked at me with a smile and said of this recipe "It's a keeper". Enough said!

The salad was great, bigger hit than I expected.  I added red onion to it.  The dressing makes ALOT way more than what we needed.  I also thought there was too much sugar.  I ended up adding some honey and lemon juice.  It was really good, just wasted alot of dressing.

Delicious! I brought this salad to easter lunch and it was a hit! Everyone thought it was good, even me and I don't usually like fruit in my salad. I would just suggest adding almonds or walnuts for some crunch. Oh and the dressing looks a bit gross to me so I was iffy to try it but it tastes amazing

1/3 cup sugar is the magic amount! Made this yesterday for a potluck and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as some reviews said it was too sweet at 1/2 cup yet others said 1/4 cup wasn't enough. It was perfect! Used baby spinach, canola oil, balsamic vinegar and only sesame seeds as I didn't have poppy.  Added a large can of mandarin oranges and a kiwi as I didn't have quite enough strawberries. Well, I had NOTHING left to bring home with me yet others were leaving the potluck with gobs of left over food. I received many compliments and numerous persons asked for the recipe.  I'm making it again today for my family. This is an excellent, easy and healthy recipe that I will be using a lot. Thanks so much for sharing!

I love trying new recipes on holidays.  No, that probably isn't the best time to do that.  However, this one is great I did it for easter and the family loved it.  Would not change a thing!!!!!  As for the ones that would not normally try this because of the spinach, they loved it.

I served this salad at a BBQ. I am a dietitian, so I substituted canola oil for vegetable oil as it is a healthier oil.  This recipe was a HIT!  Three people have asked for the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it for Easter brunch, and everyone loved it. I did have outrageously good strawberries, so I'm sure that helped, but the dressing itself was awesome. I also added a package of glazed pecans (found in my produce section) and it gave it an awesome crunch. Very, very good.

I subbed balsamic for the white wine vinegar and added chopped pears and toasted chopped walnuts and sliced almonds. I also subbed honey for the white sugar and cut the amount. Delicious!

This was so delicious.   I brought it to a barbecue for a nice refreshing salad.   I just brought the salad dressing, strawberries and spinach in separate containers and put it all together just before eating.   It was going in a New York second.

I kept the dressing in a cruet so that we could pour what we wanted on our salad , and to prevent sogginess.  I added slivered almonds.  This was really good and company-worthy!

I made this tonight for father's day dinner.  I used bagged baby spinach with red leaf lettuce..  (2 bags).  I used about 2 pints of very yummy sweet strawberries.  As others had suggested, I cut the sugar (splenda I used) in half.  Also, on the suggestions of previous reviewers, I added red onion and feta cheese..  OH YUMMY!  My company was begging for the recipe..  A definite must make again!!!

Excellent recipe!  My family LOVED it.  It's nice and fresh and perfect for summer.  I omitted the poppy seeds from the dressing, though, as a personal preference , and added a little more vinegar.

I'm not sure I should rate this as I added and subtracted quite a bit but even if I hadn't, the combination of strawberries and spinach and oil and vinegar would rate a 5. I took it to a potluck and I saw people go back for seconds and thirds. I added some romaine lettuce, walnuts, feta and red onion. Used balsamic instead of white wine vinegar and used less seeds and less sugar (all per reviews). Next time I'll use more vinegar and less oil. It was fantastic!

My family thought strawberries and spinach were a funny combination, but the salad together works wonderful!  Reviewers said it was on the sweet side, but that's partly because of the strawberries.  Its on the menu again tonight by request!

I was looking for a great salad that included strawberries after I took my children strawberry picking (a "must-do" in NJ). This is salad perfection! I made no changes to the recipe.  If I am taking it to a dinner party I bring the dressing in a seperate container and add it right before serving.

Overall a good salad. A bit too sweet for my taste. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and sub. Splenda for the sugar as others suggested. I would definitely try again with less sweetener.

I relaly liked this easy recipe but my kids gave it a thumbs down. They did not like the "sweet and sour" taste. Use the best quality, ripe berries as possible, and do not make more than you'll eat, as the leftovers are just yucky (wilted and soggy).

YUMMY!!! i substituted Bsalmic vinegar like some other reviewers did and used canola oil instead. also added some slivered almonds. i used frozen strawberries and they were pretty good if you don't have fresh on hand. i also used Splenda instead of sugar and cut back a little. no complaints! this is a very tasty, very simple salad.

I made this for a group of friends and they all liked it. The sesame seeds in particular provides a very good flavour. Next time, I think I will reduce the quantity of sugar and the vegetable oil by a little bit.

I was not a fan of this dressing at all. It was sticky sweet. It tasted like syrup poured over spinach. My husband however said it was 'ok I guess' so I gave it 2 instead of one star.

This was wonderful. I did half veg. oil and half conola oil just to cut down on the amt. of trans-fat. Next time, I would also toast the seame seeds first. And, I think some toasted/slivered almonds added to the salad would be a great addition as well! Yummy as is, though - no doubt about that!

I have made this recipe for years thanks in part to my sister-in-law. A couple of variations on this are: to add sunflower seeds to the salad in place of sesame seeds;when strawberries are not in season, use red skinned apples (I like gala), chopped with skins on, and in place of sesame, chopped walnuts. Either way, this is the most appealing salad, both in taste and presentation, when entertaining.

This recipe is even better with toasted, sugared slivered almonds (or probably any candied nut), and worchestershire sauce in the dressing. A co-worker brings it to department potlucks, and now the rest of us make it often. A friend substitutes romaine, and her family loves it. Great recipe.

I brought this once to a potluck at work. It was the star of the show! Now when the potluck list comes around my name is already added with this as my contribution. Where has this recipe been all my life? I have been making spinach salad with bacon dressing forever. This is much easier and a little healthier.

I have been making this same salad for years and it's always a hit. Having TOO MUCH dressing is a plus for us, we just use what we need and refrigerate the rest for next time! I sometimes add mandarin oranges and red onions if I have them.

This was a GREAT last-minute, easy-but-impressive salad option!!!  I am a cook for 50 in YNP,and this recipe definately saved the meal last night.:)  I had to make some substitutions, but it still turned out awesome:  reduced the s.berries to 2 cups, increased sugar and oil a bit, and substituted balsalmic mixed w/ a little straight up distilled for the wine vinegar.  Sounds a little funky, but got absolutely RAVE reviews!  Thanks Jerry!

I just got done making this for Easter dinner.  It was INCREDIBLE.  Every single person asked for the recipe!  Thanks, Jerry, for helping me make the meal special.  P.S.  I made the recipe EXACTLY how it said with the white wine vinegar, etc.  It was WONDERFUL!

Spinach, strawberries, bottled raspberry balsamic dressing and, perhaps, walnuts or pecans make an excellent salad.  Easy !

Also tried this, as recommended by others, with Balsamic vinegar. Outstanding recipe. Don't mix all of it on the salad. I only drizzed some of the dressing on the salad, and it was wonderful.

Made this salad for a dinner party of 6 last Sunday.  It's SOOOOO GOOD!  Everyone loved it and the wives asked for the recipe.  A truly amazing yet simple salad.  Added toasted almonds because we love nuts, and only used half of the sugar.

I love this recipe and have made it for many years, adjusting the dressing to no sugar and use honey, to seeds, no seeds, sprinkle with all kinds of nuts, use mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries, thin sliced apple, beets and it is always very good  To me a recipe is a guideline and I chose to make changes, so be it.  It is not the fault of the recipe.  If you don't like it, don't complain, loose the recipe and don't make it again.  Happy eating of a wonderful, versatile recipe that is good for you.

It was super easy to make.  I did use extra virgin oil rather then vegetable oil and the taste was still superb. It was a side dish with these adorable mini meatloafs.

I followed the suggestion to use equal parts of vinegar, oil and sugar as well as using a raspberry balsamic vinegar. So I used 1/4 cup of each using olive oil for the oil. I also followed another suggestion to add blueberries. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. OMG, this salad is terrific. We're eating it tonight for the third time in four nights. It's great, and I'm not that much of a salad person! Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent.....you must try this. I made this for my daughter and I we loved it. I brought it to a family get together it was a hit. All of my family members were commenting on it. We tried it as written it was good but felt we wanted to try these changes and we love it. I added blueberries and glazed walnuts. My daughter will add some craisins to her salad. Either way it is darn good. The dressing I make &  store it in a jar in the fridge the ingredients do separate  so you will have to stir it. We make individual salads when we want one using the amount of dressing we want.

Very good as written. I tried the homemade dressing but must say that in the future I'll just use Vinaigrette Raspberry Lite dressing. I'm trying to watch the calories and besides that it makes this recipe even easier to put together. I did add a couple of things for even more flavor. First, I had to add mandarin orange slices. The second addition was slivers of almonds. All went very well together and I'll be making this several time throughout the summer months.

Ok, so spinach and strawberries go together... but the oils are a bit extra.  Especially being a light spring fruit salad, it should not have such a strong dressing, in my opinion.

Wonderful, but can be made even better. I macerated the strawberries in the dressing first (2 T honey, no sugar). Tossed the spinach leaves in dressing, arranged them on plates, then put the berries on top. Kept one berry whole to garnish each plate. The second time, I added salt and pepper to the dressing and it was even better. Next time I may add a little dry mustard.

Delicious!  Used olive oil, added candied almond slivers, blue cheese crumbles, halved the sugar & no poppy seeds.  A little dressing goes a long way, pour about half and see how it looks to you before pouring out the whole amount on your salad.

My husband and I really loved this salad. He is not a huge greens eater, but he did like this one. It was sweet and tart (from the strawberries). I used coconut oil, which solidifies when it touches cold strawberries. I fixed that by letting it get to room temperature, and it was glossy again.

I was excited to serve this salad at the Easter dinner I attended.  I always want to find a way to give five stars, but in this case I find I cannot.  I followed this recipe exactly!  In fact, I made a special trip to the supermarket the night before to buy every ingredient fresh, not just the spinach and strawberries, but also the paprika and both sesame and poppy seeds, because I did not want to rely on what had been in my spice cupboard for a while.  I even made sure to get white wine vinegar, and not white vinegar.  On the side I had mandarin orange segments and sugared pecans available for anyone who wanted to add them to the salad.  I mixed the dressing well and added it at the last moment.  The final result?  The salad was ok, just not great as I was led to expect from reading the other reviews.  I won't be making it again.  Sorry.

This salad is okay as it's presented here but there's far too much oil for our taste.  As this was to be a main course for dinner, I added 1 ounce of toasted almonds, 1/2 cup goat cheese, 1 cup blackberries, and 1/2 cup blueberries.  Still far too much oil and I will cut the oil way down next time, for I feel the healthiness of the salad is diminished by all of this oil.  However, the spinach and the strawberry combo is fantastic.

The combination of Strawberries and Baby spinach is  super! I only gave 3 stars, as the dressing is way too overwhelming. 
I  prefer a much simpler dressing of Balsamic vinegar , Olive oil and a good grinding of Black pepper.  This is all that is needed to bring out all the flavours beautifully!!!

I figured it out!  Wash and cut and slice strawberries first. Then mix up the dressing and set aside. I used honey instead of sugar. Wash the spinach gently and shake off excess water.  Spin any additional water off in a salad spinner. Then carefully mix the strawberries and spinach together in the salad spinner. Add just the amount of dressing you think that you will need to moisten the salad.  Then spin the strawberries and spinach again in the salad spinner to shake off any unneeded dressing.  Add poppy seeds, sesasme seeds and almonds and toss.  The salad will NOT be soggy and because you likely will not use all of the dressing, it will not be overly sweet!

Fantastic recipe.  Everyone LOVED this salad.  Did make some "sugared" sliced almonds by spraying a small fry pan with PAM, adding a handful of almonds to lightly toast and then sprinkling with sugar.  Only cooked about 3-4 minutes shaking all to mix.  Made a perfect topping after salad was tossed in dressing.  LOVE this recipe!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the dressing is a little too sweet as is. With half the sugar though, it was amazing. I recommend doing half the sugar. Throw some feta cheese, purple onion, and chopped pecans. Marinade some boneless skinless chicken in italian dressing, grill it or backe it, chop it, and throw it on top. This recipe will be 5 stars with the modifications.

I enjoyed this salad.  However, I reduced sugar, but it was still a bit too sweet.  Also, the poppy seeds could be omitted.  The dressing was good, just use less sugar.

Delicious salad! I cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet. I think I'll add some toasted almonds next time for a little crunch.

Oh me, Oh my this is wonderful.  My grandson called and said, "Im bringing some steaks over and I had seen this recipe in my daily email that morning so made this for a side, my first time to eat this salad and it was great.  My grandsons wife told me to add feta cheese to it next time and I will try that next time I make this wonderful dish. Maxine

This is the bomb!  A friend made it and now I'm making it...use Splenda instead of the sugar and added slivered almonds.  The poppy seeds really make the dressing special in flavor.

WOW! For once I didn't have to hold down my kid and force him to eat his vegetables! He gobbled this up like it was hot fudge cake and ice cream. TRY THIS RECIPE... you'll love it!  Heck, I had some yesterday for lunch, and I'm having it again today! It's THAT GOOD.

I made this for a very large gathering this Memorial day. It was a big hit. Even the kids loved it. I will be making this salad as long as there are fresh strawberries. The dressing is to die for...LOL. I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used my champagne vinegar. Was a good substitute. Thanks for this awesome salad recipe. Can't wait to eat it again!!

Very good!  The dressing is a perfect match for the flavors of the strawberries and spinach.  Did not add poppy seeds and I did toast the sesame seeds to bring out the flavor

I dissolved the sugar by boiling 1/6 cup of water on the stovetop and adding 1/3 cup of sugar to make a syrup (8 servings-sized salad), and cooled it in the fridge before adding to the salad dressing.  This worked out fine.  I also used extra virgin olive oil in place of vegetable oil and added a large can of manderine oranges (drained), and two sliced kiwis and lots of strawberries.  It was a delicious salad and a big hit with our family.  I'll be making this for guests!!

This was super yummy other then the dressing had way to much sugar so much that it was crunchy sugar. I used a raspberry vinagerette that didn't blend well with the veggie oil.  I will cut the sugar down and exclude the oil next time

We fixed this for dinner last night.  We added the caramelized almonds and blue  cheese.  We used Balsamic vinegar since we didn't have white on hand--still tasted fabulous.  In the future I'll make this for a ladies luncheon.

Fantastic salad! Both my boyfriend and I loved this salad! MMMM! The dressing is amazing! I did add a bit more viniger though because it was too oily. I also added slivered almonds but did not add the poppy seeds! MMMM!

I added a few items to this salad but overall it was DELISH. I had everything for the dressing on hand which was a plus.  I added cubed medium brie, pecans, red onions, dried cranberries and alfalfa sprouts.  Sooo yummy!

My husband thought I was insane making this he was sure he wouldn't like it! He loved it!  Everyone I have ever served this too LOVES it. I like the addition of Avocado and use balsamic vinegar in place of the regular kind.

This is a pretty good recipe but can be made outstanding with a few changes and additions.I added chopped walnuts (in place of the seeds)and crumbled feta cheese to the salad for extra crunch and flavour. For the dressing, I used balsamic vinegar in place of the white vinegar to give the dressing more tang and used 1/3 a cup of sugar so the sweetness in the dressing did not overpower the sweetness of the strawberries.

This is a great recipe.  I have made it many times and it's always gone.  I do change the vegetable oil for Olive oil and also add almonds..they give it a great crunky taste.  Thank you for sharing..my kids also eat this salad when I make it.

This recipe is amazing! But anytime a recipe requires modifications I have to deduct a star. Like others, I used Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar instead of the vinegar the recipe called for. I cut the sugar in half (the full recipe amount makes the dressing too sweet), added mandarin oranges and substituted the seeds for roasted almonds. With these changes the salad is delicious!

This was great- I made it for a playdate and the toddlers kept wanting more, more, more!  The only alterations that I made were to add mandarin oranges and sliced almonds, and to decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made a single serving at a time to take to work - loved it! Added some blueberries too. Going to try substituting peaches for the strawberries, since peaches are in season.

I had my entire family of 6 plus significant others as well as my brother's future in-laws over for Mother's Day and this went over wonderfully.  I have lots of dinner parties with my family and I finally had to give up my source of all my great recipies!

As suggested, I used 1/4 c. sugar. I made a batch for a group of 14 people and had less than one cup leftover, they were skeptical at first, but then it went like hotcakes. Great recipe, fast and easy to make.

Excellent and easy.  I usually add slivered almonds for some crunch and savory flavor.  DO NOT put the dressing in the refrigerator...it gets gooey very quickly.

Wonderful!  I used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar and I added a little red onion just because I love onions.  We loved it, our guest loved it and my husband has asked me to make sure this one gets made often

Superb salad! I used Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar in place of white wine and less sugar, a drizzle of honey, and a dash of soy. I omitted the poppy and sesame seeds replacing them with toasted walnuts. Next time I will add feta cheese to this. Overall this is a great salad.

Very very good.  I made some candied almonds and added them right before serving, which really added a little extra yum to the salad.  I just heated a pan to medium-high and poured in about 1/4 c. sliced almonds and then sprinkled some sugar on top and about a T. of water and cooked until lightly browned and the sugar carmelized on them.

Everytime I make this I get compliments on it... some other variations are adding crumbled feta and balsamic vinegar (heat the vinegar to make it thicker and sweeter). Also, adding cantaloupe makes it even better!!!!

Great! Stuck to recipe, except I drizzled the dressing on instead of tossing with the salad. The dressing is very tangy, which compliments the sweetness of the strawberries. A wonderful mixture of flavors; even my 4-year-old gobbled it up! Plus, it was very quick, took less than 10 minutes to throw everything together.

Very good- made for Easter.  I didn't think there was too much sugar like others did.  I toasted the sesame seeds before i added them to the dressing.  I used one bag of baby spinach and one bag of romaine hearts, 2 cartons of strawberries- equalled the right amount!  I highly recommend this salad, as is!!

Great salad - frequently used for family dinners. I find there is quite a lot of dressing - if you put all that it calls for on, it seems to really saturate the salad. If you like your salads not as moist, add a little at a time.

Very good salad, but a little too much sugar. Next time I will use splenda. 3/03/09 UPDATE: Fantastic! This was my second time making this salad, but this time was excellent. I halved the recipe and used only 1 Tbsp of sugar and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also, I made the dressing a few hours before dinner and kept in the refrigerator, so the flavors blended really well.

I've not tried this particular recipe, but it's VERY similar to one that my cousin gave me (I think it came from Taste Of Home), and we make it every year on vacation.  There's so much you can do with it.  We have used a Romaine/Spinach mix, added some red onion, mandarin oranges and almonds (not all at the same time, but I suppose that would work), and one day I'm going to try this with some cooked chicken to make a complete meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing! Like others, I reduced the amount of oil (and used olive oil instead) to half the vinegar amount, and used raspberry vinagrette. I also used slightly less sugar, primarily because the strawberries were very ripe. This was a *huge* hit and will definitely be a salad staple in our house.

The dressing was good, maybe a little to sweet so I would cut back on the sugar next time.  I added walnuts and mushrooms to the salad and thought the salad was devine!

I tried this recipe 2 or so years ago and everywhere I take it, it's a big hit.  I accidentally bought the apple cider vinegar but it tasted so great with it I haven't changed it.  I use Splenda instead of sugar and no one ever seems to notice and I still get rave reviews.  I am curious if this one is as good as the Spinach & Strawberry Salad II though.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was a big hit.  I used baby spinach and as other suggested only half the amount of sugar.  I'm sure I'll use this recipe again.

wonderful, healthy salad! I followed other users' advice and cut the sugar by half as well as substituting half honey for the sugar.  I think I will use all honey next time.  I also used regular balsamic vinegar as advised by others (I had no raspberry flavored) and the dressing was very flavorful.  I didn't have poppy seeds, so I just threw in some sliced raw almonds and the salad had great texture and added nutrtion.  I would like to try some pecan-crusted chicken next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great salad! Made it twice now and got rave reviews both times. The only thing I changed was that I added feta cheese.

What a great summer salad!  I served it with pulled pork sandwiches and a corn casserole and it was a perfect meal.  The ONLY suggestion I have and something I might try next time is to use a little less sugar in the dressing - maybe only a 1/4 cup next time.  Oh - and I added some finely sliced red onion to the salad also.

Excellent salad.  I leave aout the paprika and only add black sesame seeds. Sometimes I serve it with grilled chicken and fresh mozarella, when I want to eat this as a meal.  The creamyness and mildness of the fresh mozarella goes wonderfully.

Made this wonderful salad for Easter and everyone loved it!!  My boyfriend didn't think he would like it because he smelled the vinegar in it but then tried it and thought it was really good.  The taste was nothing like he expected and actually ate a bowl full.  Everyone else at the party loved it and I only had one small serving left.  I did substitute Rice Wine Vinegar for the White Wine Vinegar as I didn't have any of that on hand. Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

Amazingly easy, delicious and beautiful salad!  Served this today at a birthday party and got lots of raves!  I substituted the sugar with Splenda...no noticable difference.  I did add a TBS. of dried minced onion, a dash of black pepper, a 1/2 tsp. sea salt, and Almond Accents' slivered roasted almonds.  Can't wait to make this again.  Thanks!

I added feta cheese, slivered almonds and a small amount of very thinly-sliced red onion to this and it was WONDERFUL.  EVERYONE asks for this recipe.  I'm going to take the recommendations and try Splenda next time as the dressing is a little sweet.  I also use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Excellent!  Very light, a great compliment to any meal.  I used a sugar blend for baking Splenda and a a light olive oil with excellent results.

I took this to Christmas with the family.  My sister and brother-in-law loved it.  Sent the large quantity of left-overs home with them. I love strawberries and salad, but didn't make a good combination for my taste.

Excellent! I've tried this as is, but it's also very good if you substitute in a fruity vinegar (I used rasp. white balsamic vinegar.)

Way, way, way TOO SWEET.  This was more like a dessert than a salad.  It did not compliment the rest of the meal. I will try the cranberry spinach salad instead.

Very good.  My kids are picky and don't like the spinach, so I substitue Romaine lettuce and reduce the sugar.  I sometimes substitute dry roasted sunflower seeds if I don't have sesame seeds on hand.  Seems to work out fine.

I, like others, was skeptical of the ingredients but I was drawn in by the reviews. This salad was yummy. The sunflower seeds gave the salad a nice touch. My whole family, from my parents to my 3 and 4 year old daughters, loved it.

Very pretty and tasty.  Used less oil and less sugar as others had mentioned. Next time I made it - Also used some honey, and sliced, sugared almonds.  And I went with the Rasberry basalmic vinegar.

I served this at a party and everyone loved it.  I didn't put quite as much sugar in the dressing as it called for (1/4 cup to 1/3 cup) and it was still sweet and tasty.  Make sure you use vegetable oil and not olive oil like I did the second time I made it.  The flavor of olive oil didn't go well.

This was an awesome salad.  I made this for all of my in-laws last night.  They loved it!  My father-in-law who usually does not eat salad even liked it.  I served it with "Angel Chicken Pasta".  I got that recipe from this website, too.  It is very good and went great with this salad.  You might want to check that out, too.  If you are worried about your weight, use Splenda instead of real sugar.  It is still good.  I put 7 or 8 Splenda packets.
Thanks for the great recipe.

EXCELLENT FOR A FUN CHANGE!  When I fix it next time I'll wait to mix the strawberries and spinach until just before I serve it. They sort of wilted down after waiting an hour to be served.  Will also try adding the toasted almonds, and sunflower seeds as some have suggested.  This was really a nice change1

Great change of pace from ordinary salad! I found pre-packaged spinach with almonds and dried cranberries, then added the strawberries and dressing. Made it so easy. I did substitute balsamic for white wine vinegar and would advise to cut back the sugar a bit. But overall, wonderful!

This instantly became one of our favorite warm weather meals.  to a 1/2 recipe I simply added about 6 crumbuled bacon slices and a cup or so of sliced mushrooms and both wife and I simply loved it.

This is a delicious salad.  My husband has been making a similar one for quite some time, only he uses Splenda instead of sugar & balsamic vinegar (for a much lower calorie dressing).  You can also add blue cheese for a nice touch.

This is a salad that is very appealing in a salad bowl and the taste is exceptional.  I added walnuts and mozzarella cheese and I used prewashed spinach.  A great addition to any meal and just sit back and get ready to receive lots of compliments.

I like this recipe a lot.  I have made this salad a few times already.  The amount of vinegar and sugar is just right, not too sweet.  I made a jumbo shrimp salad using this dressing:  pan seared jumbo shrimp, mango cubes, and mixed greens.  Serve it with this dressing.  It's excellent.  I think it's elegant enough to be the first course if you have a formal dinner party.  I'll make it over and over again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a truly delicious recipe.  The dressing recipe makes ALOT but that's good as I saved some for another time.  I made the recipe exact the first time.  The second time I made some personal changes.  I used half white vinegar, half blasamic and cut down slightly on the sugar, added finely chopped red onions and toasted almonds to the salad.  I suppose you can be as creative as you would like.  This is definitley a keeper.  Thanks for sharing

What more can I say Jerry? Again, this was a part of my daughters' birthday party dinner and it was loved by all. I had a TON of food going on, so I cheated and used bottled poppyseed dressing. Not only is this delicious, but beautiful too!

I make a very similar salad that everyone in my family loves. I omit the sesame seeds and paprika and add one cucumber, peeled/seeded/very thinly sliced, and chopped red onion. Also, for the dressing, I add 2 Tbsp of fresh lemon juice and refrigerate overnight.

TERRIFIC recipe! I made it just like the recipe said to do. I bought bagged spinach so I didn’t have to mess with cutting or cleaning it. I used 1 bag and tossed the dressing on top right before serving. It got MANY compliments, and I will defiantly make it again!

This recipe was quick and easy.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  Thought about making it with cranberries, but didn't.  I think the strawberries in it were great.  Just the right seasoning.  Great!

Wow! I made this for a barbeque and this salad was the first item gone.  I suggest to follow the recipe exactly, but you may not want to use all of the dressing.  Add it as necessary and save leftovers for the next batch - trust me, you will want to make another batch once you try this.  Thanks!

After reading the reviews, I used 1/3 cup of vegetable oil instead of 1/2 cup and substituted 1/4 cup of Splenda for the 1/2 cup of sugar.  It still was quite sweet.

This is just a wonderful salad for something different...I cut the sugar in half, used balsamic vinegar and olive oil, added chopped walnuts and red onion slices and crumbled in a   blue veined goat cheese...everyone at the beach club loved it and said it was their favorite salad ever!!!!

Excellent!!!  I am trying to watch my sugar and fat, so I reduced the oil (alot) and used Splenda instead of sugar.  It did not compromise the taste.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious, and different!  I only used 1/4 cup sugar, and it was plenty sweet.  Also, don't know that the sesame seeds really added much to the flavor, so may want to eliminate if you don't have them anyway.

This is a very good recipe, but I would recommend using less sugar.  I used less than the recipe stated but still had comments that it was too sweet.  I used a raspberry wine vinegar and it turned out delicious.

Also great with shallots in place of onions. I found that the oil used can be reduced without a loss in taste.

Since it's December and strawberries are outrageously expensive, I used canned Bosch pears (the ones in "light" syrup).  I also added a handful of cranberries and slivered almonds.  Oh yes, and I did cut the sugar in half.  Perfect.

This recipe is so good, and even better, it is so quick and easy!  Instead of using spinach, I used a Spring mix salad mix pre-packaged from the grocery store.  There seemed to be a lot of dressing so I only used half, which was more than enough.  I can see lots of options for add-ins and substitutions with this salad and I will definitely make it again!

WQW! This is the best salad ever. I drizzled a little lemon juice over the strawberries before hand as I have found that it brings out the flavour of the berries.I substiuted maple syrup for the sugar.

This salad is wonderful. The presentation alone makes this salad a hit, but the dressing makes it a grand slam.  Be prepared when you serve it to have extra and a few copies of the recipe; Everyone wants it!

My two-year-old and five-year-old sons couldn't get enough and I've never been able to get them to eat spinach before.  They loved it!

great salad!! my family really enjoyed it!! I substituted hazelnut oil for the veggie oil to give it a slight nutty flavor. I also used 1/2 spinach leaves and 1/2 butter lettuce. It was superb!! Since I didn't actually mix the strawberries with the salad, and just made separate servings I was able to experiment the next day with pears!  It was just as good!  Great salad recipe jerry lynne!!! It's definitely a keeper in this house!!!!

This salad is absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making it often.  I didn't have white wine vinegar and substituted red, and it was great.

This sounded like an odd combination,
but I love spinach and I love strawberries
so I thought I'd give it a try. It was
delicious! The sauce is just spicy
enough to give it some zing.

So I decided to add chicken breast and feta cheese. Those two ingredients made the salad even yummier and more filling.

This is such a simple salad to get together, but, it was so good!  The dressing is very sweet, but, a nice complement to the spinach and strawberries.  The only thing I didn't like is that it was impossible to emulsify the dressing, so, you do get a lot of the oil texture.

I have used this recipe for years and love it! I also add red onion which makes it even better and instead of pecans i used hazelnuts, cook a piece of Salmon and place it in the center of each individual serving.  Very elegant meal.  BUT this time used pecans like she says in her recipe and loved the feta on top. Simply delicious!!!!!!!

I just made this for the first time tonight.  Since it is only my husband and me, I cut the recipe in half.  He doesn't like spinach but said he would give it a try since the strawberries looked good in it.  Much to my surprise, he loved it.  He actually ate more than half of it.  I followed all of the measurements but used balsamic vinegar.  I didn't have any paprika so had to omit it.  It was absolutely delicious and I am excited to make it again.

This salad is one of my favorites and I make it a lot.  I need to cut back on the sugar & fat, so I use half of the oil and splenda to taste.  I sometimes add red onion, reduced-fat feta cheese or chicken breast for a main meal.  I've made this with and without the poppy & sesame seeds.  Both are great.

Turned out great but wait until last minute to put dressing on, otherwise spinach will be soggy.

Delicious! All I changed was almond slivers in place of the seeds and I used coconut oil. We love strawberry season and even my children (4 & 2) ate some of this salad.

I halved the sugar, as suggested by others, and used olive oil and balsamic rather than vegetable oil and white wine vinegar.  I also added pecans, mangoes,and feta.  Really tasty.

Eating my 2nd plate, holy cow!  I was completely skeptical, but this is so slamming that my keyboard is going to need a cleaning after this rate session!  YUMMO! :) I did cut back on the sugar (2 T sugar + 2 T honey) but as is was awesome!  Will serve dressing on side, as I don't like as much. Thank you!  Glub glub, yummy!

QUICK, SIMPLE, DELICIOUS!  I'd probably cut back on the sugar in the dressing a bit if you have sweeter strawberries as it's almost candy-like in quality but it's darn delicious regardless.

We really liked this recipe.  Never crossed my mind to put spinach and strawberries together.  Just made a couple changes as other reviewers suggested subbing honey for sugar and raspberry vinegar for the white wine vinegar.  Also, couldn't find sesame and poppy seeds so I used raisins and other mixed nuts.

I made this for company last night and everyone loved this salad. It was drowning in the dressing though. Next time I make it, I'll cut down on the vegetable oil and vinegar.  Other than that, it was great! I plan to make it again.

This is a wonderful and quick healthy salad but only if you cut the sugar in half for the dressing.  I have a tremendous sweet tooth, and I couldn't eat the salad using the original measurements for the dressing.  Cut the sugar in half, and you'll love it!  Also, consider adding in some candied pecans.  They would be a wonderful addition.

This salad is absolutely amazing!!!  I added Feta cheese and candied pecans.  Everyone loved it!  There was way too much dressing so I will cut back next time.  I also plan to cut down on the amount of sugar.  I will be making this often though as it was a huge success!!

This salad is amazing! I used 1/4 cup agave in place of the white sugar and a mix of 1/4 c extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 c canola oil in place of the vegetable oil. I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar instead as I had it on hand. Also I had a bag of slivered almonds in the pantry, so I toasted some and topped the salad with them.  I noticed one reader mentioned that when she put the dressing in the fridge it hardened to a paste - I have experienced that myself when I have used only extra virgin olive oil in dressings ( it is so annoying!) but didn't have any issues with the lend of half canola half evoo, stayed nice and liquidy after being in the fridge overnight.

Subbed the white wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar.  Everyone loved this!  I will definitely cut back on the sugar next time.  Half a cup is waaayyy too much for a salad.  I won't put in the entire dressing either.

OMG FABULOUS! I made this but only a small amount as my husband is basically a carnivore, especially when it comes to salads. Not only did he like it - he LOVED it and asked for more! My jaw dropped. I too found it delicious and the perfect salad. Will definitely make again!!!

I made this salad for Easter, and I won't make it again.  A few people really liked it, but I felt it was too oily.  I prefer using olive oil, and the vegetable oil was bland.  This was just a sweet oily dressing without much else.  Not bad, just not great.  I followed directions exactly… I don't like changing recipes and then reviewing them.  I can't recommend this one.

Excellent mix. I was skeptical about the seeds but they gave the salad a wonderful nutty flavor. Sweet, but refreshing. Perfect spring salad.

Yum! I added some balsamic vinegar while reducing the amount of white wine vinegar (because balsamic and strawberries are delicious together!) and also threw in some candied pecans. Kept the dressing in the fridge for a little while, then added it to the salad & strawberries right before serving. Be sure not to put too much dressing on the salad because then it'll get soggy quickly. (Even soggy it's still delicious though!)

This salad turned into a big mess.  A few minutes after dressing the salad the spinach wilted into little globs in the bowl.  The sweet sour taste was not appealing to our palate.  Maybe it was the vinegar?  Not going to try it again

I made this for father's day. My husband loved it!  I made a few modifications.  I used red whine vinegar, and sesame oil for my oil substitute.  I also did not have any poppy seeds and used only the sesame seeds in which I toasted.

This salad is FANTASTIC.... I make it all the time.  We love it in my house.  The amount of seeds is a bit much for me.  I always add less when I make it.  Most salads are not good the second day, but this strawberry spinach salad actually tastes better the next day after the dressing has been sitting.

Such a great Salad.  One of my favorites.  Very simple to make. I agree with the person that stated not to put the dressing  in the fridge.  It makes it thick like a paste. I used balsamic vinegar instead and liked it a lot more. I also used almonds in place of the sesame and poppy seeds.

Great salad!!  Even the kids loved it. The only thing I would change is the actual amount of "dressing" that goes on the salad. We thought it was a little too much. You decide for yourself! :)

Excellent salad!! I will definitely make this impressive dish again. Husband loved it too. I used a mixture of balsamic and red wine vinegar because that's what I had on hand. I added toasted hazelnuts and feta and used less sugar. Delicious!!

The dressing for this is awesome!  The only thing I did differently was add some lightly toasted pecans to the salad.

As written it was too sweet. I made again halving the sugar and using balsamic instead of white vinegar and loved it! Thank you for a good starting point!

To say this is good is an understatement, we love it! I used honey glazed almond slivers in place of seasame seeds as I didn't have any seasame seeds on hand at the time - actually liked it even better with the almonds.

This is an excellent spring/summer salad recipe. I love to make this for gatherings and everyone really enjoys it.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds so I omit those, but I also like to add mandarin oranges and some sliced red onion for extra flavor.  Great Recipe!

Love it!  It has become my standard luncheon or potluck recipe.  I do have to cut back the sugar a bit - we just can't have that much.  But otherwise great!

Great salad!  Took it for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar.  I added 1/8 cup sugar and 1/8 cup Splenda.  I found the 1/2 cup sugar a little too sweet for my taste.  I also added some red onion and sliced toffeed almonds (just a few).   It looks beautiful and tastes fantastic!

I took this salad to an Easter family dinner as my dish to pass.  I LOVE this salad and I don't like many salads at all.  My husband doesn't like spinach and I think he was back for thirds.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I will definately make this again and again.

This was a great salad! I did add some things to it though, I added walnuts, cranberries, feta cheese, and some red onions...It was amazing! Took it to our annual Easter dinner, and everyone loved it! Oh, I also left out the sesame seeds and poppy seeds and just pureed some raspberries and made that into a vinaigrette.

We are a family of ranch dresing eaters. NEVER like vinagrettes(sp?). I wanted to try something different for our Easter dinner and this was a hit. I added just a tad more sugar than called for because we like sweet but everyone loved it. Will for sure make again and add mandarin oranges and some candied nuts. Very much a keeper.

I did the suggestions--added a touch of balsamic vinegar, played with the sugar. I also used white wine, per recipe. The whole dressing was amazing. I received rave reviews from the guests. I soaked my strawberries in the dressing, as per one suggestion. I also added mandarin oranges and caramelized almonds. It was a lovely, yummy salad.

The best salad I have ever eaten.  It is so pleasing (tangy, hint of sweetness, complex nuttiness from the seed mixture) that I make it for the taste, not for the health benefits.  (Never thought I would say that about any vegetable salad.).  The lefover dressing is a great marinade for grapefruit slices.

I add a little fresh squeezed lemon juice, substitute honey instead of sugar, and leave out the sesame seeds. It's a hit.

This was an excellent salad. I used one bag of spinach and one bag of baby arugula.  I poured too much oil on the greens, but that was my fault.  The arugula added a nice touch.

Take it from someone who typically dislikes salad...this is a great recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because I made some changes to the recipe. I didn't have sesame or poppy seeds, so I made some candied pecans and almonds (throw them in a pan with sugar and a little water). I also did not have white wine vinegar, so I mixed half apple cider vinegar (all I had) with some red wine. I also replaced the 1/2 cup sugar with about 3 T honey. I didn't think the sugar would mix very well. The result was very delicious! I wasn't too sure about my vinegar/wine concoction, but it turned out great! Definitely will make again.

My 7 year old son, who refuses to touch anything green, gobbled up two helpings of this salad! I used half of the sugar, and omitted the seeds because I didn't have any on hand. I also added some crumbled feta cheese. Excellent!

Yummy! I also served this with candied pecans, and blue cheese.  Both on the side.  I didn't add the dressing, that way no worries about soggy salad. Guests just added as much as they wanted. For the dressing, I too used less sugar, and changed the vinegar to balsamic and red wine!!!  It was a hit...in fact my Auntie just asked for the recipe for July 4th.

This salad is FABULOUS! I made it for the wife one night and she was amazed as well. That's a grand slam in my book! I added some candied almonds that I made myself (that was a hassle, let me tell you...) and served it along side some baked tilapia fillets with some wine. This is a great salad for a romantic dinner for 2. She made it again for the family and, surprise, the kids loved it too! A wonderful multi purpose recepie. Thanks!!

Great flavors, very easy to make. I use red wine vinegar and 1/3 cup sugar and less oil (olive). I also add fresh cracked pepper and salt.  As written, with all that sugar, I'd find it too sweet, so hence the 4 stars.

I took this to a pot luck and everyone fell in love with it. Great and simple recipe.  However, I do have to say that I made it again but used splenda instead of sugar and it still tasted great but less calories.

Perfect! I tought this recipe was fantatic just the way it was. I made it last night for a group of nine and even some who raised a lip and only took a bite size amount (just to be polite Lol) absolutely loved it. Sure, you could change it, perhaps make it a little healthier, but with men that don't cook and hate spinach asking for the recipe so their wives can make it at home, why would you want to. Excellent! Plus simple and quick.

Very simple and healthy salad. Great summer salad. Used a light raspberry vinegarette dressing and sliced almonds. Everyone loved it including my 11 year old niece who didn't even realize she was eating spinach!

This was the best salad I've ever had! I didn't have to make a single change! It was a huge hit and my familys dinner party! Even all the little kids loved it! They ate every bite, greens and all!

This is a family favorite!  We like to add some sliced, toasted almonds to it also.  Just pop the sliced almonds in the oven 10-15 minutes at 350 to bring out their flavor!  My dad and my husband love this!

We love this delicious and sweet salad! I halved the dressing and used about 2-3 tbsp. olive oil instead of the regular oil. I too refrigerated the dressing a while before using it - the ingredients blended together nicely and it became a thicker dressing - requiring the need to use less of it!

So good.  I now keep the dressing on the side, because I always tend to use too much.  Just be sure to mix it up well before use.
I add some feta when I make this recipe.  YUM

While I really like this recipe, I think that it makes too much dressing. But I generally don't like a lot of dressing on my salad. I omit the poppy seeds, opting for a toasted walnut or almond in the salad. I agree with the other reviewers that you should add the dressing at the last possible second.

Absolutely incredible.  Both my kids loved it as well as my husband.  I waited until the last minute to mix the strawberries, spinach, and dressing so the spinach wouldn't wilt.  It was delic!  I will definitely be making this again.  I seved it with the Pasta Strega Nonna from this site.  They went well together and provided a colorful meal.

I absolutely *love* this salad. I have made it many times for friends and family and everyone just raves about how good it is. The only thing I really do differently is add feta cheese (sooo good!) also I usually leave out the poppy seeds, just because I never have them on hand. This recipe is great, so easy and so yummy!

Wow...this is awesome.  On my third bite as I write. :)  I added slivered almonds and meant to substitute honey for the sugar but forgot.  Forgot the paprika, didn't have poppy seeds (but I know that would have made a really nice difference).  Subbed regular vinegar.  This is definitely a keeper!

I didn't give it a 5 star rating as I'm not sure how this would taste as it is. I had a very similar recipe but it included feta cheese - wouldn't be to everyone's liking but I think a creamy feta cheese goes wonderful with this. 

I have a mortar & pestle I use for Asian cooking. Crushing the poppy seeds so their flavour can meld in the dressing is better. Many people have no idea poppy seeds have a wonderful flavour & just use them as decoration. Crushing them will release their flavour into the dressing. Other than a few changes, the recipe for this salad would get 5 stars.

This salad is very good, but we have a few extra additions that we enjoy in our version: some slivered purple onions, a few pineapple tidbits, and a handful of crumbled feta cheese.  Since this salad is also at it's best in the summer time, we also serve it with either grilled chicken or shrimp on top.  Add some good garlic bread, and you've got an easy, delicious dinner!

I'll give it four stars because my kids liked it, and that's not common for a salad.  Maybe I should have tried it exactly the way it was written, but I used some reviewers suggestions, I used raspberry vinegar, and less sugar, and I don't know it just wasn't that special.  It was okay, but not a better alternative to a nice garden salad, in my opinion.

This is my favorite salad recipe! Sometimes I make it just like the recipe calls for and sometimes I switch up. I like it best with romaine, strawberries, gorgonzola, walnuts and the dressing! Also, I have used blueberries instead of strawberries!! Enjoy this recipe, it rocks!

Great salad. Like some others suggested, I substituted honey for the sugar (about 3 tablespoons), and added red onion and slivered almonds. I will make this again!

Very good recipe.  I followed the lead of other reviewers and used half the sugar.  I also added half a red onion for color (I don't even like red onion!).  I would like it with goat cheese crumbled in, but didn't think my audience tonight would like that...next time.  Even my picky, "Don't mix fruit with my food" husband commented on it several times.

This is a great salad that my godmother has been making for years.  I suggest making the dressing ahead of time and let is sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.  It will thicken the dressing and really improve the salad.

I accidentally made a really yummy salad using this recipe as the base. I started off making a salad with romaine lettuce. I had too much spinach for the supper dish I was making, so I mixed some of it with the romaine. I added cucumber and sliced vidalia onion, and that's when it occurred to me that I should have made a spinach & strawberry salad, seeing as I have a basket of berries in the fridge. Well, I decided what the heck -- I added sliced strawberries to what I already had on the plates and made the dressing from this recipe (minus the seeds because I didn't have any, and with half the olive oil). I also added some cashews and crumbled goat cheese to the salad. And the final result was DELICIOUS!!!!!

The dressing really makes the salad -- but the flavours and textures of the other ingredients I added to the salad really worked well together.

So delicious! Make this salad- you will not be disappointed. My husband asked me to make a batch of the dressing to keep in the fridge so he can use it instead of his favorite bottled salad dressing. There were no leftovers when I made a HUGE bowl of this salad for 6 people. The only thing I changed was the sugar content. I used about a quarter of the sugar called for and a few packets of splenda. Oh, and I mixed romaine and baby spinach.

I love the combination of strawberries and spinach in this salad. I also added rasberries and blueberries to the mix. The dressing was okay, but I found it to have too many seeds for my personal taste. However, the salad is soooo good that you don't even need a dressing for it! I served this at Easter dinner and had lots left over. Selfishly, I kept most of the leftovers for myself. Thanks for the suggestion.

Loved it!!  Used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of white wine, used about a 1/3 less sugar and didn't use the poppy and sesame seeds because I didn't have them.  I had bowls of feta and blue cheese on the side for those who wanted it.  It was a huge hit.  Delicious!

I thought this was terrific.  I have the biggest sweet tooth of all time but I did but down the sugar by maybe a third.  But I added sugared toasted almonds, chopped red onion and a little blue cheese as well.  Really really good!

I brought this salad to a potluck yesterday and it was a hit. People were skeptical about the strawberries first but once they tasted it, they really liked it. giving 4 stars because I added half a teaspoonful of salt in the dressing. Sugar only didn't quite do. Salad looks very pretty. Try it!

This is a wonderful salad.  The dressing is just perfect.  I packed the salad separate from the dressing and mixed them together at a pot luck, and it was a big hit.  So colorful and just right for warm weather.

For someone (loke me) who is not too fond of spinach, this salad was amazing!!  My family and friends LOVE it.  I would recommend it to everyone.  The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar.  It was a little sweet for us, so I used a little less.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is really a great salad!  I add slivered almonds to the lettuce and berries and in the dressing, I add worcestershire sauce and minced onion for more flavor.  Olive oil is great instead of vegetable oil too.

I thought this was a great salad, but the reviews of my guests were more mixed.  Those who loved strawberries thought this was fantastic.  Those who tolerate strawberries were much less impressed.  Overall a winner if you know the tastes of your guests.

This was good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the spinach and apple salad on this site.  The dressing was too sweet.  I tasted it before I put it on the salad and added more vinegar.  It was very good then.

This is unbelievably good.  What a weird combo, but it really works.  I use rice vinegar instead of white wine, olive oil in place of the vegetable oil and omit the paprika.  I've had friends who usually avoid vegetables in any form devour plate after plate of this salad.

This is a true winner for a salad recipe.  I took it tonight to a Christmas party at work and everyone loved it, wanted the recipe.  It looks gorgeous for Christmas in a large glass party bowl.  I was able to find fresh strawberries.  When it was all gone, they wanted more! This is a keeper for all year round.  Thanks for sharing.

My family LOVED this and the recipe is so flexible! I didn't have sesame seeds, so I just added a little more poppy seeds, and I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. We didn't have spinach, so I used fresh baby field greens. I tried adding a few sliced strawberries into the dressing and pureed it quickly in the food processor. It was GREAT! We will definitely be using this recipe again for our summer salads.

Try it with raspberry vinegar and a bit less sugar, U will never forget the experience!! I love poppy seeds, but I did not appreciate them on spinach, cause they make me feel like they are not properly washed. But that’s just me. I used the same dressing with other leafy greens and raspberries...it was all excellent!!!

I always get asked for this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is add more fruit - raspberries, blueberries, blackberries - and I also add sugar coated pecans or walnuts (from this site). Thank you for a great keeper!

I made this salad for a Spring Lunchean with some friends!  I served it with chicken salad on croissants, and then had this salad on the side.  It was Very colorful, and it was a great hit. Many of the girls asked for the recipe!  Bravo!

I have made this several times and it's always a hit! Last time everyone asked me for the recipe. It's the perfect blend of sweet and tart, and is very light too. I usually make 1/2 the dressing, which is still more than enough.

I was leery of the dressing since it was mostly oil, vinegar, and sugar so in addition to it I made one that I make with raspberry perserves,olive oil, and red wine vinegar. My boyfriend and I both hated the sugary poppy seed dressing. I ended up throwing most of it out. With my dressing the salad was OK but we both agreed we'd rather have a salad that had veggies in it.

I really liked this recipe but my family was reluctant to try it. Hubby liked it but the girls said no way. It seems like the kind of thing you would find in a tea room - very classy. I would only make one change and that would be to use less berries, maybe half as many. After all of the spinach was gone I was left with a bowl full of berries.

Wonderful salad!  Very refreshing for hot weather.  I didn't have any white wine vineger so I used red wine vineger.  I also tossed in a handful of thinly sliced red onion.  Not only is this salad great tasting but it is very pretty too.

This salad is foolproof.  I didn't have sesame seeds, but I added slivered almonds to the spinach and strawberries.  I also didn't mix the dressing in but left it on the side for my guests to use as they pleased.  Awesome side dish, I will be adding this to my repertoire!

I did alter the recipe a little bit.  I followed the reviews and cut the sugar in half (actually used Splenda) and I didn't have poppy seeds so I left them out.  I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce (per a different recipe) and it was an absolute hit!  I was supposed to make a Greek salad for a shower last week and they said..."or you can make this one again".  LOL  I would have never put strawberries in a salad but this is a keeper!  Thanks!

The dressing is wonderful.  It matched so well with the spinach and strawberrys.  The second time I made this I added a little shredded mozzarella cheese and sunflower seeds to my salad and it tasted marvelous, but then it tasted just as great without the additions.  Wonderful recipe Jerry Lynne, thanks for sharing.

Sorry, I didn't care for this at all.  The combination of the spinach and strawberries didn't work for us at all. The dressing was nice though.  I would use that on a green salad, or spinach salad.  I'd just skip the berries.

This is a keeper. I made it for a potluck & everyone looked at it skeptical till they tasted it, & we all know the rest of the story. Now everyone asks for it to be made all the time. I was shocked to the person who thought it was horrid, I guess some of us are just not open to new tastes.

This was sooo good!  My sister made it for me and I had to ask her for the recipe.  The only thing I do differently is that we don’t add the paprika, sesame or poppy seeds and we use red wine vinegar and it’s still wonderful!!!  I’m sure it’s great with the seeds, but I love it without.  Also, to save on time, I use the bags of pre-washed baby spinach leaves.

A delicious salad!  My hubby - who doesn't even really like strawberries - loved it enough to have seconds!  I left out the poppy seeds from the dressing and used regular white vinegar.  Added some toasted almonds to the salad before serving - and it was a hit.  This will become a regular salad at our house! Quick and easy - looks good too!

I used my friends as guinea pigs at the last Super Bowl.  I heard nothing but RAVES!!!  It is so easy to make.  I followed the advice of others and used the bag spinach and a little over 16 oz container of strawberries.  I will definately use this one over and over again!

Yup! It's everything its cracked up to be!  You can cut the sugar in half if you like a more tart dressing.  Beautiful and delicious salad!

I have made this salad for years but have also added toasted sliced almonds (just bake sliced almonds in the oven until lightly toasted - be careful they burn quickly!) - adds a nice crunch! When strawberries are out of season in your area(or out of your budget) substitute a can of mandarin oranges. It is great too! When fresh strawberries are available this time of year the red and green make it a perfect holiday choice!

This was one of the best salads!!  My best friend has a similar salad but that dressing calls for one cup of sugar!!!!  This is much better.  I love spinach salad but I did use romaine.  Came out wonderful!!

Wow!  This was incredible!  This is better than restaurant quality.  I followed this recipe exactly except that I substituted balsamic vinegar for white wine vinegar.  It was so tasty that I could drink this dressing.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

This was wonderful!  I made this for a family BBQ this weekend and got rave reviews!  Everyone wanted the recipe before they left.  As suggested by others, I added thinly sliced red onion, mandarin oranges and halved pecans.  I also served the dressing on the side instead of tossing it together and actually had a bunch left over.  Yummy!  I will definitely make this again!

Simply the best salad I have ever made. Made it on Easter for the first time and have prepared it about 10 times since. The only substitute I used was roasted sesame seeds, which gives it the best flavor.

One of the best salads I have ever had!  Extremely easy to make, and serves beautifully.  I used white cooking wine once instead of vinegar, and it came out fantastic as well.  Balsamic also worked well.  The combination sounds strange but it is a delightful, sweet but not overpowering salad that is very refreshing!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this because of all of the good ratings, it took about 5 minutes to make so I thought that it couldn't live up to the ratings (too easy, not enough ingredients-- just to simple). Boy was I wrong!!! It is WONDERFUL! I did not refrigerate the dressing as suggested. I'll make this over and over and over again. THANKS Jerry Lynne for a great recipe!!

This salad is very easy to make and a sweet change from the standard green salad.  I didn't have poppy seeds, but the dressing was fine without it.  I did add some finely chopped red onion to the dressing before adding it to the salad.  Next time I may toast the sesame seeds before adding them.  My family really liked it and I think this is a great dressing for any salad.  Thank you!

This salad tasted much better about an hour after I had tossed the dressing with the greens.  Next time I make it I will:  make it a day or at least a few hours ahead of time and decrease the amount of oil and sesame seeds in the dressing.

This was very good. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I added some salad shrimp which made it even better.  I may play around with the dressing some - maybe add some pureed strawberries and cut back on the sugar.

I made this for a party this past weekend and it is superb!  I had major reservations about this salad but I can't recommend it enough.  I followed other's suggestions and halved the sugar.  It was perfect that way...I can't imagine it being any sweeter.  I also used baby spinach to save prepping time and used balsamic vinegar.  Perfect, perfect, perfect!  Definitely an all time favorite!

This was so.... good! Instead of all the oil (I used only about 1/4 t.), I added 1/4C. non-fat plain yogurt and I also used Nutrasweet sweetner instead of the sugar. By eliminating the sugar and oil the calories were reduced. This makes for a great lo-cal salad but it doesn't taste lo-cal.

Excellent!  I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and only 1 TBS of sesame seeds along with the 1 TBS poppy seeds.  It was a nice light sweet dressing.  I also used candied sliced almonds which gave it a nice crunch.  Delicious!  I used baby spinach so I didn't need to tear the leaves.  Just mix up the dressing in a jar and use it for whatever size salad you need to make, chill the remainder.  I've tried it with blackberries, and it's also good.

It sounded a little strange, but I thought that I would give it a go. It was a hit at our BBQ. I would probably add less seeds next time.

A bit too sweet for my taste, but still delicious.  I will half the sugar next time and toss in some sliced almonds as suggested. Simply because I prefer a bit more "tang" to my salads.  Might want to try a bit of minced garlic as well. Bet it would add an extra zip to the oil/vinegar mixture.  Great salad! :)

Wonderful salad!  I doubled recipe for a large party and added chopped walnuts, real bacon pieces(Hormel), and shredded fresh Parm. cheese. Add dressing just before serving!!!

This salad was delicious, even though I couldn't find either the sesame or poppy seeds.  It was a bit too sweet for us, though, and I'll reduce the sugar next time.  Still, I'll be making it again and again.

It sounds weird, but it is actually very very good! Sort of sweet, but not too much: just right.  I will definitely make this again!  (I halved the recipe though for our little family of three, and we still had leftovers.)

The dressing was a little sweeter than I like, so I cut the sugar in half.  I also used balsamic vinegar and eliminated the sesame & poppy seeds.  I like a little bite in my salad, so I added thinly sliced red onion and some crumbled gorgonzola cheese.  It was delicious and got rave reviews! Everyone asked for the recipe.  Next time I'll add some chopped toasted pecans.

This is a great recipe. I used Balsamic vinegar, and only a couple of tbsp sugar. Doesn't need much sugar. I also added a lemon juice and a touch of fresh minced ginger. It was very good, and everyone loved it. The cleaned the bowl.

I had an abundance of strawberries from the garden this year and was looking for things to do with them.  I was hesitant to make it because my husband and son are not salad people at all.  However I figured "oh well more for me."  Just like the other reviewers I was pleasantly surprised how much they loved it.  My husband even went back for seconds!  Following the advice of other reviewers,  I also add red onion, crushed walnuts (pecans and almonds were also suggested) and topped it with blue cheese crumbles.  Also I don't use vegetable oil so I substituted olive oil.  I also couldn't find poppy seeds so I used chia seeds.  It was delish!  I recommend tossing in the dressing at the last minute and drizzling it on slowly for your desired coverage (I only ended up using half of it).  This will definitely become a regular on our house!

This salad is amazing.  NOW to make a good thing better (healthier) I sub the Vegetable oil with EVOO and eliminate the sugar.  I use Stevia or Splenda or whatever sweetener.  I added 4 oz. grilled chicken and sliced almonds for texture and had an amazing meal with 353 calories, 7 carbs, 21 g of fat(3sat)35g protein 184mg of sodium... Thanks for this easy recipe. Brought it to work and everyone loved it!-- Next time I may half the oil like suggested.  We had a bit of dressing left over.

As written 4 stars, but as with all salad dressing I add more or less of an ingredient to suit my taste. Flavors go well together.

I make a very similar recipe, however, my dressing starts with a base of 1 Tbsp of strawberry jam (heated to runny), then I add oil (1/4 cup) and lemon juice.  I always add the sugared almonds.  Family favorite - even the teenaged boys love it.

I had no poppyseeds, so I used chia seeds.  My hubby couldn't tell.   Dressing was great.  maybe shave down the sugar a bit..  I added pine nuts.  Walnuts would be good too.

This was a huge hit at my Easter dinner.  I added candied pecans and feta cheese as recommended in the video.  So, so good.

I'm the kind of person who doesn't like spinach, but this was incredibly delicious. Served it at a family dinner and everyone loved it. If this is a way to get the greens in me - then I'm all for it! And so easy to make too!

I was out of white vinegar, so subbed rice wine vinegar ( from the oriental food section ) and it was excellent! Added some candied almonds as well.

I made this recipe using smart balance oil and also using evoo.  I usually love olive oil, but did not like it in this dressing - it gave it a heavy flavor that didn't go well with the sweet berries and spinach.  I have a heavy hand when it comes to dressing my salads (would you like some lettuce with that ranch) and only used a fraction of what the recipe makes - it could easily be halved.  The first time I tried it with just the berries, spinach and dressing.  I felt underwhelmed.  Will try to add some other items next time (goodness knows I have plenty of dressing left!).

New stand by salad.  I did use 1/2 half virgin olive oil and 1/2 vegtable oil.  As suggested did use less than half the sugar.  Toasted almond slices and put on top after mixing dressing with spinach.  Nice and tasty.

We love this recipe.  I only use 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also add toasted almonds and have feta and blue cheese on the side.  It's a hit at family dinners and potlucks.

My family loves this salad!  My 8 year old asks for it all the time.  I add thinly sliced red onion and crumble gorgonzola or blue cheese into the salad.  For the dressing, I use raspberry vinegar and decrease the sugar.  Yum!

I liked this salad the flavours are good and the dressing is very nice. I didn't need to use all the dressing though, I saved some of it for another day.

I did not read the reviews prior to making and probably should have. I used the serving size and changed for 1 person. Following recipe exactly, I was left with a super-sweet (think teeth-achingly sweet) dressing that could have coated three times the amount of spinach and strawberries. Next time, I will definitely reduce the astronomical amount of sugar and increase the 'salad' amount.

It is sooo good! I was hesitant about the vinaigrette because I tasted it alone before putting it on the salad, and I wasn´t impressed.  But once it´s tossed onto the salad, it makes the perfect combination, and it was so delicious! I didn´t have poppy seeds but it didn´t matter.  I am concerned about all the oil and sugar, so I will try tweaking the amount of these ingredients next time.

Simple and delicious! Brought it to a dinner party last night and it was a huge hit....the host joked that the salad was the shining star of the meal!  Based on other reviews I cut the sugar and oil (I used olive oil) to 1/4 cup each and omitted the poppyseeds (personal preference).  I served the dressing on the side along with candied pecans and blue cheese.  Will definitely be making this again...and often!

I did not care for this recipe. The dressing was awful right off the bat and got worse with each bite. I removed the strawberries from the spinach to freeze for a smoothie and used the spinach in another recipe. At least I got the great idea to slice strawberries with an egg slicer from another reviewer. Just kidding. It broke my egg slicer.

This is a great easy salad that tastes delicious. Took it to a pot luck supper at church and nothing was left in the dish afterwards. I have made this several times and each time is delicious! The more strawberries the better in my opinion! :)

Great recipe. I added toasted almonds, and extra sesame seeds. ALSO IT'S BETTER TO USE OLIVE OIL INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE, IT TASTES SO MUCH BETTER! The paprika is essential to give it a nice kick. My kids were picky about it though. Maybe someday they will learn to like it.

Made this for Easter Brunch. It was a hit! I listened to some of the reviews and only used 1/4 cup of sugar and two table spoons of honey. I threw in a little bit more sesame and poppy seeds.  Very easy and very delish.

If you're looking for a sweet spring/summer salad, this was very good. Only thing I changed was I added a little Feta cheese (at the table, so it was optional). For me the Feta offset the sweetness just a bit.

I will definately make this again, especially the dressing.  I made it for an Easter gathering and those that ate it, loved it and requested the recipe.  Thanks so much.

My Mom and I make this salad all of the time. We do it as directed but leave out the sesame seeds and sometimes the paprika. We have used plain white vinegar instead of the wine vinegar. Last time we made it with the white wine vinegar and I did not like it as well. Just a preference, was to winey or tangy with it so we prefer the regular white. Love this salad!! Even kids like it! Great way to get them to eat spinach.

I made as directed with the exception of the poppy seeds (since I didn't have any) and this was wonderful!  Can't wait to make it for company...such a pretty salad to make a nice impression, yet so simple to make.

I tried this recipe with Balsamic vinegar, as another reviewer suggested and that is what I had on hand, well as much as I really wanted to like this recipe I just didn't....at all! The vinager is too over powering. This was to be my office lunch, looks like I'm running out to grab something else.

Amazing.    I've made it at least 3 times, and everyone LOVES it.   I use balsamic vinegar since I never have white wine vinegar, and it works just fine!  Super tasty.

I wouldn't worry about refrigerating the dressing; just take it out about 10 minutes before serving the salad and it warms enough to pour well.  We make extra for all types of salads and so I have to refrigerate it.  This is an awesome salad!

Excellent recipe.  I added a few drops of balsalmic vinegar to give the dressing a pretty brown color and served the dressing on the side.  I took it to a party and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly but I agree with the others who said the dressing is just a bit too sweet (and I love sweet!)  Next time, I will cut back to 1/3 cup sugar as another viewer indicated.   Using only strawberries, it seems a bit plain, but was still delicious.  Next time, though, I will add a few mandarin oranges, a bit of feta cheese, and maybe a few toasted almonds. The dressing, with a bit less sugar, would make any combination of toppings work. Thanks for a great recipe! Update: Just made this again using 1/3 cup white sugar and added mandarin oranges, feta, and toasted almonds. Perfect!!  Since I bought so much (10 oz) spinach, I doubled the dressing because it keeps so well.  We were able to eat this salad with two meals.

When strawberries are in season, I love to find new recipes to use strawberries in.  I did alter this one a bit because I didn't have white wine vinegar or sesame seeds.  I used 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 2 T poppyseeds for the dressing and I added 1 cup chopped walnuts with some mix of spinach and Romaine.  The Romaine gives it a good crunch.  I carried it to a ladies banquet and it was a hit.  I'm rating it a 5 even though I haven't made it exactly like the recipe given.  I'm sure it is real similar in taste.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I made it again and added 1 tsp. sesame oil and a tbsp. of minced red onions to the dressing. It got rave reviews both ways. I also added mandarin oranges the second time which made it look really colorful! Next time I will try adding the candied almonds and feta suggested by another reader. This is a GREAT recipe by itself or with additions.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't even have any white wine vinegar on hand, had to use red wine vinegar, but still wonderful!  My boyfriend will never turn his nose up at spinach again.

Made this (with all the improvements) for a dinner party of 8. It was the only 'leftovers' I had. My husband asked me the next morning if I had noticed the salad leftovers; which is his way of saying, 'don't make this again'. Not sure how to make any further improvements. I will keep looking for the perfect spinach and strawberry salad.

Very good.  I am thinking that it would be better if the sugar was disolved in hot liquid and then chilled and I will try this next time.  Made it for Eater dinner very pretty salad.

Yum!  I made this to bring to an Easter BBQ and it was perfect! I added the glazed almonds and had blue cheese on the side. No problem refrigerating the dressing. In fact since I tripled the recipe I had plenty of dressing save to use on other salads for later. The dressing is great just how the recipe states to make it  : ) The sugar brings out the flavor. Just use only a small amount of dressing on the salad. I served the dressing on the side as well so the leaves wouldn't wilt.

This salad was the hit of Easter dinner..Simple yet elegant and delicious! I sugared about 3/4 c pecans using 1/4 c white sugar and 2T water heated in a saucepan stirring constantly untill sugar melted and nuts were coated and dry, let them cool and sprinkled on top..Awesome, I will be making this as long as strawberries are in season!

Awesome!  No poppy seeds or sesame so added a skotch of sesame oil to dressing and chopped almonds!  It was a huge pleaser.  Next time will use balsamic instead of white wine, and a little less oil.

Everyone raved, served at Easter!  Used honey instead of sugar, raspberry instead of white wine vinegar, left dressing out at room temperature as another user recommended.  I also used candied almonds instead of poppy seeds, and everyone loved the crunch.  My husband avoids vinegrette dressings, but he loved this whole salad.  Used a egg slicer to cut the strawberries, great idea.

Today is Easter Sunday, 2010.  My d-i-l made this salad for the meal along with an Easter cake she also found here.  Both were quite delicious and she is delighted that she found this site.  We're all happy!

Took this to an Easter dinner, got great compliments! Excellent flavors and dressing consistency.  Fresh strawberries really make this a fun salad. Next time I make it, I'll be sure to get baby spinach. The flavors and textures really deserve a more delicate leaf than the leathery old regular spinach I used this time.

This is easy and simple. Perfect for Easter. I topped it with walnuts. I also substituted sesame (allergy in the family) for flax seeds and it turned out great.

This was a hit for Easter dinner. I added my own things, such as red onion and toasted almonds. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and replaced half the sugar with honey. Used olive oil instead of veg. oil to be a little healthier. Husband suggested adding bacon - will try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

It tastes really good and I'm a sweet tooth. It was my first time making this and I would definitely put less oil in. It didn't seem like it would be enough to cover the whole salad but trust me a little oil goes a long way. I made it about five minutes ago and its already drenched and wilting- but it tastes good!

This is such  a versatile recipe that you can do so much to! I like using 1/4 cup honey to 1/2 cup or so plain or flavored low fat yogurt as a dressing for those who don't like the vinegar based dressing.  And the dried berries/fruits you can add are limitless!

Awesome salad!  This was one of my favorite recipes for our Thanksgiving meal.  I've had it before at my sister-in-law's house and thought it was really good.  I followed another's advice and added part sugar, part honey; let it sit on counter (never refrigerated); and what really made it were the candied sliced almonds!

I keep coming back to this recipe for the dressing. It is delicious and simple, and goes well with almost any salad!

Excellent, and a perfect pairing with fish recipes.  I would recommend cutting back on the sugar a bit.

This salad was excellant as stated but the next time I made it I left out the sesame seeds and substituted 1/8 tsp. sesame oil and toasted almonds to the top and it was really outstanding. One of the best recipes I have tried on this website.

So good so fresh.  Do not refrig the dressing.  It gets hard, so only make what you are going to use right then.  I did not mix in the dressing until ready to serve.  It gets real broke down real quick.  Beautiful and great flavor when fresh.

I fried a slice of bacon (turkey for us but regular is GREAT) per serving and crumbled one of top of each salad.  Then for those who like it (not me) I added some sliced red onion.  My husband said it was the best salad I ever made him - and I've made him a lot of salads!!

I love this salad and everyone who's had it loves it as well.  I usually add about half of a red onion which is really good, and this last time I added some roasted almonds.  Super good adding the crunch.

I made this while I was on vacation with family.  Everyone thought this was great!.  I did add toasted sliced almonds and mandarin oranges.  I also substituted the white wine vinegar for a raspberry vinegrette from the store.  I also bought a premixed lettuce with many types of lettuce in it.  I also did not put the seeds in because not everyone likes seeds.  If I make this again I will probably try honey instead of sugar and maybe less oil because it was a little oily for me.

This was wonderful and held great reviews from the family. I did change the sugar to splenda and cut it down to 1/8 of a cup. I have also used organic mixed blend of lettuce instead of spinach. It was very good both ways and I would make multiple times over.

this isn't anything I would ever think of making but SO GLAD I did! It is so yummy and perfect for a Spring/Summer side. I brought it to last year's Memorial Day picnic and everyone wants it again this year!
Update: once again I have been asked to bring this salad to a family gathering. This time, I cut the sugar in half and used tarragon vinegar instead of white wine. It was a HUGE success! Also, depending on your mood, this salad can easily be custom-made to include bacon, mandarin oranges, feta cheese, onion, etc.

THis recipe was a hit at a dinner party.  I agree with other posters.  Definately 1/2 the sugar.  I thought it was really sweet..  Also make sure to pour the dressing on and toss just before serving.

This is so tasty and nutritous.  I don't like to add so much sugar to the dressing so I substituted liquid Stevia, a natural sweetener and it was delicious. I will make this salad often, especially this summer...may also substitute mandarin oranges and pecans.

This was very good, and reminded me of the salad that is served with the grilled salmon at Mimi's Cafe.  I did add a 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar for some additional flavor.  Next time, I'll cut the sesame seeds back as that flavor was a little too prominent for me.  I would also recommend doubling the dressing, as there was barely enough for our family of 7, particularly if you want leftovers!  Overall, a very good recipe.

What a delightfully unusual salad.  The dressing is esquisite.  Didn't think my family would like it because of so much sugar, but they really liked it!  We did use romaine instead of spinach, and it was very, very tasty.

Excellent!  I made this for a BBQ 3 weeks ago and it was a big hit.  I used a huge container of Baby Spinach from BJ's and there was PLENTY of dressing.  I also added sliced almonds, nice change of texture from bite to bite.

Excellent recipe for a nice summer salad!  Everyone loved it!  I agree with the previous review, since you have oil in the recipe it will congeal in the fridge if left in for long!  I still refridgerated the dressing but didn't leave it in for too long and took it out before serving.

This salad is so easy and so tasty, who could pass it up!  My family, even the kids, loved it.  Next time I might add some nuts (almonds or walnuts), but it's great as is.

A very simple, easy salad, but very good. Very sweet! Doesn't even need that many strawberries because the dressing is good. This one is a keeper.

This is a great, simple salad.  I toast the sesame seeds before putting them in the dressing.  I also toast walnuts which add a really nice final touch.

YUM!!!  I was hesitant on making this salad.  It just didn't sound like a very good combination.  But I was extremely pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is.  My whole family - kids included - loved it.  It's a definite Recipe Box addition!

I made this for easter and it was a big hit, for some reason I didn't care too much for the seasame seeds, personal choice.  Great dressing though, will make again.

This was good and very simple, but I think I'll stick with fresh fruit for breakfast; it turns out I prefer dried fruit in salads. I don't like overly sweet dressings, so I reduced the sweetener to the equivalent of 1/3 cup of sugar (I used 1/4 cup agave). I used olive oil, and I added some arugula because I had some that needed to be used. The texture was great, and the dressing complemented the salad perfectly.

Made this dressing for Easter dinner and we loved it.  I liked the absense of onion and garlic, which is commonly added to this dressing.  It was perfect!

Made this for our family's Annual Easter Egg Hunt.  WOW - It was fantastic!  I did cut the sugar by half & used the Raspberry Vinegar.  I also used toasted sesame seeds.  The strawberries were soo sweet & the baby spinach leaves to tender.  I can't wait to make this again!  It will be great to take to the swim club this summer!  Thanks RobinV

I made this for my husband's family for Easter. They are not very adventurous (very meat and potatoes) but this received rave reviews.  I did have goat cheese crumbles for those who wanted to add to their salad.  I also tried it with candied pecans - Delicious!!

Delicious and easy.  Even my 16 year old son liked it.  I did modify it, though, for speed and to cut sugar. Just used bottled Italian dressing, added splenda instead of sugar, and the rest of the recipe the same.

This dressing is delicious - it makes you eat more salad so that can only be a good thing. As other reviewers suggested, I used a lot less sugar - about half a tablespoon - and a couple of tablespoons of honey.

Very good recipe!  Will probably cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup next time and only one tbsp sesame seeds instead of two.  But that is just personal preference.  Cool and refreshing salad.  Loved it!

Way too sweet, and I only put in half the sugar of the recipe. Next time I will only put in maybe 1 or 2 table spoons sugar. I also added red onions and pecans. I didn't have any feta to add, but will do for next time. Yummy tho nonetheless.

I make this dressing all the time for any salad with greens and dried or fresh fruit.  Keep some on hand in the refrigerator.  The taste is wonderful.  And if you do serve the spinach, your kids will eat it!

Absolutely awesome recipe! I didn't have wine vinaigrette but I had regular vinegar and the strawberry white Zinfandel wine cooler from Arbor mist. I added that instead, and squeezed a bit of lemon juice on top for the tanginess.

Next time, I plan to add some finely diced onion and some crumbled cheese. This was a hit with even my 18 month old!

EASY!!! As is, we gave it a 4, but add red onion & more raspberry balsamic vinegar & it's a 5. We used bag spinach & tore because our store didn't have any fresh. Next time we'll add feta cheese just for a change.

I used to make this recipe all the time, but a lot of my extended family members are not able to eat seeds. So instead,this year, I used melon balls instead of strawberries and left the seeds out of the dressing. I did add finely minced onion to the dressing as suggested in the reviews. I then threw in a little feta and some crumbled bacon and it was delicious.

Other than cutting back on the sugar and using balsamic vinegar I made this as is.  OUTSTANDING! Even my 'not crazy about salad' teenage boy could not get enough of it! Made this for Valentine's Day and just bought the ingredients today to prepare it for our Easter dinner. Thanks a million for this one!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made this several times and it was a big hit. 
Use sesame AND poppy seeds for the best results, they really add to the taste.

A MUST TRY!! I made this past weekend for my 4th of July Party, everyone loved it.  I omitted the poppy seed (didn’t have any) and used two (2) bags of baby spinach,  1-pint of strawberries and followed the dressing exactly and it was an absolutely great salad, I would definitely make again and again.

This is a favorite of mine. I can't wait until fresh spinach appears in my garden and fresh strawberries are in the produce section, so that I can make it with the very best ingredients. It's both easy and delicious.

Very easy to prepare & tasty!
I didn't care for the combination of poppy & sesame seeds so next time I make it I will just use the poppy seeds.  I also added feta cheese & slived toasted almonds, this recipe is a keeper, a nice change for a different type of salad.

Delicious!  I added toasted slivered almonds and thinly sliced red onion.  I've made this one a couple of times now and initially was left with quite a bit of dressing afterwards. Recipe makes a large batch!! I recommend only using half of what is recommended so you won't be left with too much dressing.

I tried this recipe for the first time last year and I have made it several times since then.  People are always asking for the ingredients.  I use slivered almonds instead of sesame & poppy seeds.  It is very easy and scrumptious!

Very good..my husband was skeptical at first but he enjoyed it. I scaled it down to 4 people and the amounts were perfect. I think I may add walnuts the next time and try red wine vinegar. Thanks for the recipe.

I have to admit I was skeptical, at first, of the ingredients but I've made it for two functions now and everyone raved about it. The only thing I added was some thinly sliced red onion and once I used baby spinach. Absolutely wonderful either way!!!

Now I see what everyone was raving about! This was fantastic, quite to my surprise. My self-proclaimed spinach-hating husband even gobbled it up. I used distilled white vinegar because it was all I had on hand, but it still tasted great. I think next time I will cut down on the oil/vinegar/sugar mixture just a little, because it pooled in the bottom of the bowl and made the spinach wilty. Otherwise, perfect! I can't wait to make this for the next get-together!

Great!  Used baby spinach for a faster recipe.  Added fresh blueberries too!  Used  a raspberry vinagrette from Trader Joe's and some chopped walnuts.  Nice combination!

So delicious.  I did make a few adjustments.  I didn't have any white wine vinager so I used red wine vinager.  I threw in a little piece of a sweet onion, ommited the sesame seeds and used Splenda instead of sugar.  I put all the ingredients for the dressing in a blender and processed it for a minute.  It helps keep the oil and vinager together.

This is an excellent salad.   I did change the sugar to Splenda to cut down on carbs and calories as I'm on WeightWatchers.  I served it to friends and family and the raves were the best.  As one family member said "Who"d a thunk it spinach and strawberries together, Yummy". Quoted verbatum, this person is college educated.

Great taste, but the sugar makes it very grainy in texture.  I didn't have sesame or poppy seeds laying around, so chopped up dry roasted peanuts work great.  Salty nuts work best because they cut the sweetness nicely.
Also, the salad needs more stuff on it than just strawberries. I added some chunks of cheddar and dry roasted peanuts.

Very easy and adaptable.  i like to add walnut pieces, and toast the sesame seeds. Easy to turn into a main course by adding cooked chicken.

EVERYONE IS RIGHT! This is a fabulous salad! My husband, who doesn't care for spinach, says this could be a "restaurant" salad, and my daughter who hates every one of the ingredients except strawberries and sugar, said it was quite good, but she didn't LOVE it. I toasted the sesame seeds first and they got away from me a bit so some of them had a kind of burned flavor. The only sesame seeds I could find in the store were raw and the recipe doesn't specify toasted or not. I used Splenda instead of sugar and if I do that again I will use a little less. It took a bit of a search to find white wine vinegar, but it was worth it. I didn't want to mess with tearing the spinach so bought baby spinach which worked well but I was unsure about the amount to use. I served this salad to a group of 10 people and was delighted when the one with the most gourmet taste liked it the most.

Five star - definitely!  Didn't have poppy seed, so subbed toasted slivered almonds with the sesame seeds.  I added a little bit of very finely minced shallot, because it goes well with the sweet dressing.  The spinach wilts/softens *very* quickly, so mix in dressing JUST before serving!  Ate this salad one night, and went back to the store the next day for more spinach as I HAD to have it again the next day.  Not amazing or exotic in flavour, just very gentle and pleasing.

I served this for my bunco group and they all wanted the rescipe.  The only thing I did wrong was put the dressing in the refigerator and it was to cold and thick and didn't warm up very fast and the sugar was stuck on the bottom.  So leave it out before serving it.

I made this for our Easter dinner; told my 3 boys it was a special kind of lettuce and they all loved it! My husband even took the leftovers the next day for lunch and I made an extra batch for my neighbor because she liked it so much too! I did omit the poppy seeds as all the stores were out that weekend.

This was a great salad. All of my guest were going crazy fighting over the salad. This is a great alternative to all of the mayo salads.  Next time I will add less sugar.  The strawberries were already sweet.  Yum!!

Wow!  I made this salad for company and it was FANTABULOUS!  All three of my kids (ages 3,5 and 8) even loved it!  I used baby spinach, added red onion, and used slivered almonds and sunflower seeds instead of poppy and sesame.  Also used red wine vinegar with garlic instead of white.  I have been craving more ever since making it the other night, and I usually don't even like salad!

Excellent!  I made for a family dinner party last night.  It was quick, easy to prepare and made a beautiful presentation.  I think it might be the best salad that I've ever had.  Loved it!!!

This is probably my favorite summer salad. I have made it often and enjoy it every time. I usually add toasted almonds and often substitute balsamic or red wine vinegar for the white wine. Really yummy.

This was excellent!.  I made this for a party-- and the bowl of salad was empty and My sister was scraping the bottom of the bowl! I mixed the sunflower seeds (instead of sesame)in with the spinach and the strawberries-not the dressing.  For the dressing I skipped the paprika.  There is a ton of dressing--so you may want to cut the amount in half.  Toss on salad right before serving.  YUMMY

I've had this recipe marked for months but never got around to trying it until last night.  I served this at a formal dinner party for 8 of my closest friends...all of them good cooks.  As such, I was a little hesitant but this was probably the hit of the dinner.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Followed the recipes exactly as is and couldn't believe the wonderful flavor melding that occured.  Will definitely be making this great summertime salad repeatedly.  Thanks so much, Jerry.

I made this salad for a cookout this past week and I had everyone asking me for the recipe! I love it when I make something that everyone loves. This is a very sweet, very cool salad to make. And might I add it looks pretty :)

Yummy! I have been trying to find this recipe for ever! Finally I've got it thanks to allrecipe.com...and Jerry Lynne, of course. 
I have had this salad several times at family gatherings, and can't stop eating it! 
Thanks so much!

Followed the recipe to a T, plus added a small package of slivered almonds, toasted in a 300 degree oven for about 8 minutes, and also added 1/4 tsp worchestershire sauce, which added a bit of bite.  I doubled this recipe for a huge teacher appreciation luncheon and it was the first salad to disappear by a long shot!  It's a beautiful dish and certainly is different from the standard fare.  So many people asked for the recipe that they printed it in the teacher's daily memo the next day.   Hint: don't mix the dressing and greens up until just before serving.

This salad had excellent flavor.  I used a bag of spinach and we ended up with too much dressing.  Also, I used probably 1-1 1/2 lbs. of strawberries, much less than the recommended four cups.  I think I will add almonds next time and maybe blue cheese like a couple of other reviewers suggested.  Great salad!

This is great I made it the first time last June and my kids ask for it everytime we have a dinner together.  I use balsamic vinegar, a little red onion, and gargonzola cheese, also splenda instead of sugar.

I took this a barbeque tonight and got rave reviews from everyone.  One guest said that she has had this type of salad before but all you could taste in the others, was the spinach and the strawberries.  She said this had a wonderful flavor, a sort of tangyness but sweet all at the same time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I think that this is WONDERFUL---My husband (who does not like fruit in ANYTHING) thought that it was good also.  I had a REALLY picky friend over for dinner, she was not too sure about the looks of it, but after one bite she was hooked--she went back for seconds, then asked for the recipe!!

This salad was great!  It was gone in a matter of minutes.  I didn't use quite as much oil, and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I don't think anyone knew the difference!  A keeper!

This was delicious and very easy to make!  I waited to toss the spinach with the dressing until right before serving and it turned out perfect.  I served this at a baby shower I recently hosted and everyone asked for the recipe.

This is truly one of the best salads I've ever made or tasted, including those eaten at nice restaurants.  I took it to a family reunion and it was the first item gone out of many, many potluck items.  Even people who typically don't eat "out of the ordinary" food, liked this salad.  Try it!

I love this recipe!  My husband was initially skeptical, but when he tried it, he loved it stating "This is something you'd eat in a restuarant".  To reduce fat and calories, I reduced the oil to 1/3C and left the sugar amount the same to reduce the "sharpness" of the vinegar.

This salad receipe is absoulutely fantastic!  After reading some of the other comments, I too adjusted the sugar just a bit.  It turned out so well and EVERYONE, including my picky husband who dislikes spinach, loved it.

Delicious! I used mixed greens since my husband doesn't care much for spinach and it turned out awesome! So easy and so good!

This was so good we couldn't stop eating it!  I followed directions except used mixed greens instead of spinach.  A keeper.

This is an excellent salad. It’s very elegant looking and the taste is very unique. The best part is that it is also very “mellow”.  I think it can be served with almost any combination of entrees or side dishes with little fear of the flavors “colliding”.

We loved this recipe. Thanks.

Very, very, very delicious!!!! I also suggest to combine the sauce with the spinach at the last minute also, for the spinach will become soggy and weighed down as time passes. I haven't tried adding almonds to it yet, but I can only imagine them being delicious with it! One of my relatives also has a salad that reminded me of this one...I think she uses the same sauce, but instead with spinach and strawberries, she made a complete fruit salad out of it. She used grapes, sliced mandrin oranges, sliced apples, strawberries, sliced banana, and avacado, all combined with the sweet sauce!  It was heavenly!!!!!!

This was an exceptional salad.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, and it turned out great.  My strawberries were a little tart, so the sugar amt was just right.  The dressing really cut the bitterness of the spinach too.  I think that I will use the prewashed bags of spinach next time to cut back on the prep time.  It probably took me 30 minutes to wash and leaf the 2 bunches of spinach.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! What a hit with everyone who tried it. I can't wait to make it again. I used two 6 oz. bags of ready washed baby spinach and a 16 oz. carton of strawberries. It was enough for 6-8 people. I used less sugar, as others had recommended and it was still plenty sweet enough. I was weary about the sesame seeds and poppy seeds but they really added flavor, glad I kept them in. I tossed in some pecans too. Absolutely delicious!!!

I have used this recipe on a number of occassions.  Every time it gets complete RAVE reviews...even from the kids!  I substitute toasted chopped pecans for the sesame and poppy seads.  Yum!  I have also tried it substituting the strawberries for raspberries (yum) and when everything is out of season...even canned, drained mandarine wedges.  Wonderful!  The only thing to be careful of is to make sure you don't combine the dressing with the spinach until the absolute last minute.  It doesn't take long for the dressing to break down the spinach.

Made this with dinner last night-was great.  My husband didn't like it because he doesn't like "sweet" dressing.  I used baby spinach and splenda instead of sugar.  Also tossed in some blueberries.  Yum.

This is a GREAT salad! So simple and delicious. Although, I would suggest that you put the dressing on when you are ready to eat. I added it early and the spinach became very soggy. Maybe keep it on the side and add as you dish it out. -Loved it.

This was a beautiful and delicious salad. I substituted red wine vinegar since I didn't have any white wine vinegar. This is a very impressive salad to serve company or your own family.

I made this salad for a party last night. It was suprisingly good. I was a little nervous about combining spinach and strawberries but amazingly it worked. I followed the advice of others and used white balsamic vinegar and reduced the sugar to a little more than 1/3 of a cup. I also added candied almonds and gorgonzola crumbles. Very nice and refreshing salad.

This is very simple, but has a great flavor.  I used white balsamic vinegar and added chopped pecans to the salad.  Everyone raved.

This is a great salad - I didn't take others suggestions to reduce the sugar - I think it is best very sweet.  Next time I might use a little less vinegar.  I also added some raspberry jam that I had in the fridge.  Turned out great - I had many compliments!

This one is a winner!  I used 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds and 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds- was great!  It was the only dish at the potluck that ended up empty. :)

No one in my family could get enough of this salad and when i took the leftovers to work the next day EVERYONE was begging for the recipe, plus it is a perfect way to get the kids to eat their vegetables. It is seriously a must try.

This is so good. I use white balsamic vinegar. The combination of fresh strawberries and spinach with the dressing is perfect. Whatever you do, don't put any sugar on the strawberries. The dressing has the right amount of sugar...and it's not a fruit salad anyway!:-)

I suggest using stawberries infused in a mixture of Champagne and Confectioners Sugar.  It adds a great kick and an abundance of flavor to mix with the vinegrette.

I have a garden with spinach, 
and the spinach came in the same time as strawberries. 
 The combination is incredible..
The kids finished the spinach !

Very good. Took me a little longer than 10 to prepare(washing and prepping spinach and strawberries) and serve. My husband raved about the dressing/salad combination.  I added pecans for some crunch but otherwise followed the directions exactly.

Very good.  Next time I'd use 1/2 the sugar in the dressing.  It was even really good as leftovers in the morning (yes, with dressing on it from the night before).

I have made this twice in the last couple of weeks, and everybody loves it. The empty bowls tell the story. 
I add slivered almonds, but otherwise follow the recipe.
Keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!! I would recommend stirring the dressing every now, so the sugar won't stay at the bottom.
Always a favorite to make and to eat!

My family loves this salad. I substitute the white vinegar for strawberry balsamic and omit the sugar. I also add toasted silvered almonds.

Great recipe! Like a lot of others, I use only half the sugar in the dressing, and leave out the paprika and sesame seeds. One variation that I make is the Southern-ized version- add a slivered Vidalia onion to the salad. So yummy!

Fantastic dressing just way too much quality for our liking, only used about 1/2. Saved extra for another day, win/ win. We used sunflower seeds also because that's what I had on hand.

Delicious dressing, even though after I started, I found out I didn't have any sesame seeds to add. It definitely needs to chill in the refrigerator before serving!

I used olive oil and cut the sugar in half and used coconut sugar.  The oil was a little overpowering for my taste.  Next time I would cut the oil more.  I also added a little orange juice to cut the oil flavor.

I was a bit nervous about this because I read the reviews about the sweetness, but I let the dressing sit on my counter overnight and had this for lunch the next day and it was simply divine.

One of our favorite salads.  Ever.  It really doesn't need any more reviews, but I would like to add how much we love it.  For those who posted the most *helpful* critical reviews, if the addition of that much sugar is troublesome, cut it by half and it is still great.  I am always amazed by people who say they eat 2 tsp of dressing to a large salad, make the dressing as written and then say it's unhealthy.  Or even better, never make it and criticize it as being unhealthy.    Use your own common sense and reduce sugar/fat/whatever to what you already know you know are your own tastes.  Good gracious.  It's pretty simple.

This is my favorite salad to bring for a summer picnic.  So why the two star rating?  Because I am rating it as it is written.  As written, there is was too much dressing, way too much sugar and not enough crunch.  To make it a 5 star, half the dressing and only use 1/4 of the sugar amount.  Okay, maybe you could use half the sugar if you like it sweet.  In order to give it crunch I added some sliced almonds..  I believe that we should rate a recipe as it is written.  If you have to alter amounts, add ingredients, etc, then you are making a different recipe.  As written...2 stars.

DO NOT USE THIS MUCH DRESSING. This salad is great, simple and easy to make. Easy to add things you like ex. almonds. BUT, absolutely do not use this much dressing or you'll be drowning your salad in oil. It's not yummy. The dressing itself is actually really good - but you don't need to put it all on at once. I put about 1/4 of the dressing on and it was great that way. You can always leave more on the side if people wanted to put on more, but no one will!

This is a simple and beautiful salad.  I would definitely make it again.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I cut the sugar in half and used half olive oil and half canola oil in the dressing.  My entire family liked it and I intend to make it again this week since our strawberries are still in season.

This salad was super yummy and refreshing.  I added crumbled feta cheese and regular chopped walnuts to my salad. I also halved the sugar in the dressing like others had mentioned.  I brought this to a party and got rave reviews from everyone there!  I will be making this again!

This is my no fail salad to bring to events.  There are no leftovers and I always get asked for the recipe.  Guests absolutely love it.
I substituted the white wine vinegar with raspberry balsamic vinegar, I also added feta cheese and praline pecans.  
It is always a big hit.

Delicious and fresh...the dressing is not extremely sweet. 

I substituted the sugar for organic coconut sugar. Everyone at the table loved it!! 
Will definitely will make it again!!

Instead of the white wine vinegar, I used strawberry-balsamic vinegar.  Every single one of the folks that tasted it demanded the recipe...even the guys.

Followed the recommendation of other reviewers and halved the sugar, substituted honey for the remainder. Also halved the seeds. Added caramelized almonds and thin-sliced red onion.  Delicious! Family loved it!

We liked it but with all the rave reviews I'm surprised we weren't just blown away.  I  added walnuts and a little goat cheese.  I  also subbed balsamic vinegar for the white, used light olive oil instead of vegetable and halved the sugar.  It was really good and I could see adding some rotisserie  chicken for a main dish.

This salad was delicious! I made the following changes: added red onions, avocado and goat cheese. For the dressing, I used olive oil instead and used maple syrup instead of sugar (approx. a bit less than 1/4 cup).

7.12.17  Spinach and strawberries are a lovely combination for a salad.  The only modification I made to the recipe was cutting the amount of sugar in half.  I was a bit apprehensive about the paprika, but I really couldn't taste it in the dressing.  If I were to make this again, I think I'd use less oil and more  white wine vinegar (personal taste preference)

This was good, but pretty basic. I thought it could use a little something else, like maybe candied or toasted nuts and definitely some thinly sliced red onion. We did like the dressing. Thanks for sharing. :)

I have to agree with others. This is just too much. I make a similar salad and I don't use any oil or sugar. I make mine with bowtie pasta, almonds, and literally about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar that I reduce on the stove until it self-sweetens and a half cup of feta cheese. Other than that mine is about the same, meaning just the strawberries and spinach.  :)

Quick. Easy. Delicious. I added sliced almonds and only put about half the sugar it calls for and it's awesome.

Great salad, everyone at the party 'really' enjoyed it.   Personally I would not add the poppy seeds again, as iit did not add any taste and somehow focused me on the seeds, instead of enjoying all of the outstanding / complex flatvours.

I guess I should have read the reviews on this. I followed the recipe exactly and put the dressing on about 2 hours before serving. What I got was a completely soggy salad!! (And I used 3x more spinach than it called for.) it only got worse and the next morning the leftover salad was like soup. I might try it again and use way less sugar and try balsamic vinegar.

I love the salad I can eat it all the time. I make variations of it depending on what I have and it's always good. To be the key pieces are strawberries the feta and spinach. And I have been lovely BC Okanogan berry and balsamic blend that I put on it for dressing.

First time trying out this salad! I have a ton of spinach and wanted to try something new with it, so I found this recipe and I couldn't be more satisfied! Just changed the seeds for sunflower seeds and half the sugar! Turned out to be super tasty! And I'm not a salad person btw, but this I love!

Instead of making the dressing with all that sugar and other stuff I usually don't have on hand, I use Ken's Fat Free Raspberry Pecan dressing. Each person can add in their own serving to their own taste. Don't know how much different the flavor is from the original dressing recipe, but it sure is goood!

I followed the directions exactly. The sugar was overwhelming. I had to add some more vinegar to mellow out the sweetness. I'm debating trying it again. Next time I will not use it nearly as much sugar.

Not sure if a 10 ounce bag of spinach is equal to two bunches, but that is what I had on hand. I used regular white vinegar since my young child was eating it. I also used raw sugar instead of white sugar. I did not have enough strawberries for 4 cups worth, but this salad was absolutely delicious and will be making it again.

Amazing! Made it today and was all gone, couldn't find sesame or poppy seeds at my local supermarket so I just followed previous comments and candied walnuts and slivered almonds with red onion...the vinaigrette was delicious even though I was hesitant at first

I didn't have strawberries so used dried cranberries instead. I had a combo of walnuts and naked whole almonds so used those and sauteed them in a table spoon of butter. I was out of poppy seeds and sesame so just omitted that from the dressing and this salad is still awesome! You don't have to use all the dressing if you're using a bagged baby spinach product.

I made this twice this week for family and friends, once with honey the other with 1/3 of the sugar it called for. By far the couple tbsp of honey won! So that would be my only change to make it 5 stars! I also added feta, perfect with any meal!

Wonderful!Made it for dinner last night! The salad fanatic huddy loved it and the kiddo has requested me to make it once a week!! I only gave four stars because I didn't use all the ingredients. I left out the poppy and sesame seeds, as well as the almonds, but I did add mandarin oranges. It still was great and I am waiting to make it next week with ALL the ingredients! TY!

Excellent salad/dressing. Also: Needing a tofu marinade (for grilling) and lacking any other ideas, I used the leftover dressing. It worked beautifully.

One of the parents always make a similar salad for Teacher Appreciation Week and this recipe is almost as tasty!  I added blueberries and pecans because that is the way the parent always makes it.  This recipe calls for a sweeter dressing, which I may even perfer.

Very good. I used olive oil (I love the flavor). Didn't have paprika or poppy seeds and it turned out excellent. I toasted the slivered almonds and sesame seeds on the stove top in a dry non stick skillet (separately). I had two helpings and my 4 yr old even ate raw spinach with the strawberries and dressing! Excellent recipe.

This was so yummy! Of course making it in another person's kitchen proved a bit challenging. I only used the sesame seeds, substituted in Balsamic Vinegar, and added some Mandarin Oranges. I really liked the colors, and the Balsamic gave it a really deep flavor! This will be one I make again and again!

I love this salad, although my version is easier.  I buy raspberry vinegrette dressing and add in chopped walnuts and feta cheese to the strawberries and spinach.  This salad is awesome!!  And I really am not typically one for salad.

Love it!!! Caramelize(put them in a skillet and add a small amount of water and sugar) a nut of your choice (I did almond slivers) and toss it in for some extra crunch.

This is delish!  Very light and refreshing.  I added some chopped avocado and that went really well.  Next time I might try adding blueberries or orange slices. The only problem is that it makes WAY too much dressing.... I have a lot left over and am not sure what to do with it, as one reviewer advised not to refridgerate it...?

Delicious!! My husband said he thinks it's the best salad he's ever had :) I thought it was good, but I enjoy Jamie's cranberry spinach salad more. Next time I would not put poppy seeds in.

It was really good, but I would use waaay less sugar, a little too sweet for our sweet tooth. With that being said, this salad was quite tasty.

This salad is simple and the flavor is great.  I made the dressing earlier in the day so the flavor had time to mix.  I also added toasted pecans, feta and some chopped yellow peppers.  My husband (who hates spinach) finished his salad before I even started mine!

This recipe is very strange so some will like it, some will not. I would suggest less sugar because the sweetness is what makes it so weird. But if you have more of an exotic taste bud, you should try it!

Awesome-I found that we preferred just a bit more vinegar in ours to tart it up a bit. Everyone we've fed it to has loved it.

DELICIOUS!  It is difficult to get wrong, even if you don't have all the ingredients.  To cut down on time I used store-bought Strawberry Balsamic dressing.  Didn't have poppy seeds (5 bucks and change for a little bottle, no thanks), just threw some sesame seeds and honey roasted almond slivers on fresh (MUST BE FRESH) strawberries and spinach and the results were soooooo good.  My husband and I had 2nds.  A definite keeper!

AMAZING! I get asked for this recipes over and over again. I've been making it for nearly 4 years and it never gets old.

Only changes I make; I use red wine vinegar in place of the white, and I use splenda instead of the sugar or 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup splenda, depending on whom I'm serving.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is requested by family all summer.  I love it.  I find it too sweet and cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup (my friend has made it with splenda and liked it).  I also like to add half of the dressing and then toss and let it sit a few minutes before you end up with too much dressing.  I also can't tell much difference the couple of times I've run short on poppy or sesame seeds.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was hesitant to try this recipe, I thought it was a weird array of ingredients, but glad I did.  It is a WONDERFUL combo of flavors.  It does need to eaten up rather quickly and is not meant for leftovers.  I've read some complaints about the high fat and sugar content, so if you're looking for a health salad this isn't it. I know I didn't pick this recipe for it's health value and didn't expect it to be a 200 calorie dish.  Will make again next summer!

Good, but way too much sugar for my taste.  Next time I'll try adding strawberry preserves to sweeten the dressing - saw that recently on tv and sounds yummy!

Yum! Light and refreshing! Great salad to bring to work - toss it up and eat.  I agree with some other posters - I might cut down the sugar and the seseme seeds next time.  I used some mixed greens instead of plain spinach, and added some toasted pine nuts, too, since I will use any excuse to use those in a salad.   Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous!  Made a few minor changes.  Used half the amount of sugar; used balsamic instead of white wine vinegar, omitted poppy seeds (don't care for them), and since it was Easter, added hard boiled egg wedges on top.  Everyone raved!

I really, really enjoyed this, but with a few changes as per other reviewers.  I substituted the white wine vinegar with balsamic and used only 1/4 cup of sugar.  Absolutely delicious!  It did seem a little heavy on the sesame seeds to me so next time I will only use 1 TBSP.

My grocery store ran out of strawberries on Christmas Eve, so I made the recipe with raspberries...equally yummy!  A really beautiful presentation in a clear salad bowl...everyone commented on it before they ever even ate it! I added crumbled blue cheese, too!

An excellent recipe!I only used 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar;
seasoned rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added a little sesame oil along with the vegetable oil; also added some toasted pine nuts. Wonderful! I've been asked for the recipe every time I serve it.

Everytime I make this salad, I get asked for a copy of the recipe.  Instead of sesame seeds, I use almond slices.  Sesame seeds get stuck in my teeth!  I have also tried using Splenda instead of sugar with good results.

I loved this recipe! I reduced fat and sugar (1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup Splenda) as recommended by others. I also used 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, which I felt it needed. Used red wine vinegar instead of white. And lastly added walnuts. Made for rave reviews by all.

A really great recipe you wouldn't expect. I think it is a little heavy on the seeds, but that's easy to fix. The ratio of spinach to strawberries needs to be watched as well.

Very good. I added some almonds. The dressing was waaaay too oily for my taste though, even when I slightly reduced the amount of oil. I'll use less oil and sugar next time, but the combination of flavors w/ the spinach, almonds, strawberries and dressing was great!

the concept is fantastic-i will definitely make agan.  however, as others have warned it is too sweet.  i will cut back sugar to perhaps 1/4 cup (it is that sweet)  or use a rice wine vinegar and simply omit sugar.  i added one crushed garlic clove and one shallot to the original recipe and feel that it needed those flavors.

Great Recipe especially for strawberry season!  I did substitute splenda for sugar as suggested, and reduced that by half and the dressing was just the right sweetness and tart we like.  Also I didnt have the seeds so i tossed pecans into the salad, very yummy!

Awesome summer salad! I make it just as directed, but I don't combine the spinach, strawberries and dressing until right before serving.

I took this to a Memorial Day gathering and although everyone had begun eating already, they came back and got some of this appealing salad.  The flavors are unique and it presents very well. I'd serve it again!

This recipe is quick and easy. My husband loves this salad and would eat it every night if I made it. (I still have not told him how easy it is to make!) As an extra, I threw in some unsalted sunflower seeds! Delicious!!!

This is the best salad I have had in a long time.
The kids love it!  Made it twice in one week. You done yourself proud.

Easy and delicious - I don't usually like fruit in my salads, but the sweetness combining with the sour of the vinegar is incredible!!  Next time I'll use slivered almonds instead of the sesame seeds for more crunch.

I served this with Thai Peanut Chicken, and it was fabulous! What a great combination of sweet and spicy.

This was so good and fresh.  What a wonderful way to get my hubby to eat something healthy, although pretty sweet!
