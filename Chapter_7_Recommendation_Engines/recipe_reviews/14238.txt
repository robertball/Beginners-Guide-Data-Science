I have made this recipe several times and it always gets compliments.  I prefer cooking up the hard chickpeas (over the canned) as I think the texture is better and there is also less sodium.  A little more time consuming but they cook up in less than an hour. I also prefer cherry tomatos cut in half.  Great flavors in this one.....

I love this recipe.  A few things I did differently:  I used cilantro instead of parsley, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar.  It was delicious.

Just delicious, with the perfect ratio of olive oil to lemon juice. And the lemon juice was refreshingly different from the vinegar traditionally used in dressings like this. No need to measure ingredients, just add to suit your tastes. This was a nice change from typical lettuce salads. And it was pretty too!

This was super fast and very easy to assemble. My husband loved it. I thought it was a little bland but I am not a big chickpea fan. It would be a great addition to a buffet table.

This recipe is a real winner... I tripled it and served it at our son's graduation open house. It went quickly and people made a point of telling me how great it tasted. I used 3 suggestions from reviewers:
1) Added about 3T. balsamic vinegar in addition to the lemon juice
2) Added about 2 big handfuls of julienned baby spinach leaves along with the parsley (used Italian flat-leaf)
3) Added about 1 pt. of halved grape tomatoes in place of regular tomato
... also, don't skip the salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Thanks so much for a great recipe I'll use often!

This was very good and easy to mix together.  I didn't have fresh parsley and instead used 4 tsp. dried.  (I'm sure fresh would be better.)  I added an extra clove of garlic (not a large clove) just for more flavor.  It will be made again!  You can't beat it for taste and fiber!

So delicious!! I used a little more onion, grape tomatoes halved, and fresh parsley and it turned out wonderful! Next time I will try using a splash of balsamic vinegar like another reviewer suggested for a little extra kick!

Make sure you use fresh parsley in this recipe -- It does make a difference. This was quick and easy to prepare. I love the fact that it is something different in the old cold salad lineup. Will make again.

I love garbanzo beans and they were a real treat to have in a salad. The flavors blend nicely. I like to put the entire salad mixture on a bed of greens for a little more substanace and color. I made this for my vegetarian boyfriend on our first date years ago and he still remembers how yummy it is.

This was SO good. I substited fresh cilantro instead of parsley, and also used about a 1/2 tablespoon of ground cumin. Got rave reviews at a party.  Thanks for posting!

Super yummy. I used organic ingredients where I could and a handful of Romanita tomatoes that I quartered. I did add three tbsp. of quality balsamic and instead of parsley, I added fresh strips of basil. DUDE, I about licked the bowl, it was so awesome. Noone liked it but me, but I ain't sharing. ;)

GOOD, BUT I SUGGEST LESS ONION, MORE TOMATO.
I TRIPLED THE RECIPE, AND THE ONION WAS OVERWHELMING.

Excellent side dish/salad.... I made this for myself to take to work for lunches and I would definately take this to a potluck or party. Different than a typical "bean salad". It has a nice presentation too

This recipe was great. I prepared it along with the Asparagus Chicken for my partner. I personally ate it with Tofu and asparagus. If I were to add to this recipe I would add more tomatos. This is a personal taste. It was a good recipe and I would make it again.

Tasty recipe, suggest using firm tomatoes to prevent too much liquid. Stores well for several days.

This is so fresh tasting and deliciuos! I used the dried chickpeas because I did not want mushy beans. I brought them to a boil and let them sit for an hour vs. soaking over night, rinsed them, and simmered them for two hours. I used a pint of grape tomatoes each cut in half and a half cup of kalamato olives cut into fourths. I plan to make this several times a year and will cook the beans ahead of time and freeze them to save time.

I made this last night to have for lunch today and it was YUMMY!  I'm on the first phase of South Beach and it fit right in.  I increased the amount of the garlic and used sliced grape tomatoes as recommended by other reviewers.  I added some quartered pitted kalamata olives that were hanging around, and did half parlsey, half cilantro.  I served a portion for lunch with some lemon-pepper tuna mixed in, and squeezed some extra lemon on top.  Perfect healthy lunch!  Thanks for the post, Jen Jen!

So good and SO easy.  Great way for us veggies to get some protein.  I've been making this for a while now and plan to keep on making it.  It's even a hit with my non-veggie friends.

This recipe is delicious! I made it for Christmas dinner as the healthy option and everyone loved it.  I followed a couple suggestions from other reviews.  1) I used grape tomatoes rather than a regular tomato.  2) I used a little more garlic because you can never go wrong with more garlic.  3) I made sure to add fresh leaf spinach...so good!  I also decided to add cilantro to the salad.  Turned out great!! My husband is asking me to make this again next week!

This is an excellent source of Vegan iron because the vitamin C in the tomatoes and lemon juice make the iron in the chickpeas significantly more absorbable by the body. Its also super tasty.

I am certainly not a cook, but I made this and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I did a few things different right from the start... I used Cilantro instead of parsley, and I added a little bit of Red Wine Vinegar.  I didn't have any lemon juice, but it still turned out great!  Be sure to let it sit for a good long time-- it was ten times better the next morning!

Terrific!  I also doubled the dressing ingredients and used two whole 15 oz. cans.  I added a grape tomatoes halved and some crumbled feta and spinach the second time I made it.  Great for lunch or as a side.

Really good salad!  I made a few changes:  I used a basket of Cherry tomatoes, cut in half;  I also added a couple splashes of Balsamic Vinegar; and since my family LOVES Cilantro (I know many don't), added about 1 T. of freshly chopped Cilantro.  It was sooo good.  Very refreshing out on the deck.  Garbanzos (and other legumes) are so healthy and very good to help control blood sugar, as well as adding fiber to the diet.  So a healthy choice!

This was very easy and delicious! I used cilantro instead of parsley (thats all i had) and little less olive oil.  It turned out great.  Thx for the recipe!

The chickpeas were a bit powdery tasting, as they were canned but not cooked. Other than that, I added 1/4 of a red pepper and about 1/4 cup of diced cucumber. My man and I loved it!

I added black sliced olives to this recipe...that extra color and flavor made it even better!  Also, used about 4 medium sized (home grown) tomatoes instead of just one...yummy!!

An easy to make, healthy, light summer salad. Great for a picnic.  Added diced cucumber and red bell pepper and it came out prettier than the picture.

This was a hit on Christmas! I wanted to use raw, dried chickpeas like some suggested but I didn't have the time to soak and cook them so I had to settle for canned. They were still very good! Based on other reviews I added fresh cilantro with the fresh parsley and drizzled balsamic vinegar thoroughly. I would have given it a full 5 stars but I know it would have been too plain without the added balsamic vinegar (I tasted it before adding it) and fresh cilantro. I think those two should be added to the recipe's ingredients.

This is a great vegetarian recipe that I make regularly - try adding 1 diced cucumber, 1 small can of mandarin oranges, and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon for a unique twist. Top with almond slices and crumbled feta cheese if desired.

This definitely needs to be made the day before.  I tried it a couple hours after I made it and thought this is bland, I served it next day and was pleasantly suprised.  It definitely needs time to soak in the dressing. I served it to guests and got compliments on how good it was. I pretty much followed the recipe, just made a few additions, I threw in a medium sized cucumber, and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

This was a terrific salad.  I added some kidney beans to the mix, was a nice contrast visually and texturally.  I loved the taste of this salad.  I did add some tuna to a small bowl of it, and had it for lunch.  I can't wait to try it with some sweet corn kernels!!  Thanks for the easy, delicious, and flexible recipe.

I also followed Diane and Linda's advice and added tuna to this salad and let me tell you, it was absolutely delicious!  My husband is not a fan of chickpeas but even he enjoyed it.  I also added kalamata olives and he threw some garlic pickles in his salad.  This would be nice for an outdoor BBQ because it doesn't have a mayonnaise base.  YUM!

this is a great accompaniment to a light summer meal and a great dish to make ahead of time, like others said - the longer it sits the more flavorful it gets.  its very visually appealing too, its so colorful.  I think there might have been a little too much parsley, but other than that, I have no complaints.  I added in a bit of oregano as well.  I served this with paninis.. I'm sure I'll be making this again this summer.

Delicious!! I doubled the recipe (used 2 16 oz cans of chickpeas) and added some tomato basil feta cheese. My b/f who doesn't care for chickpeas liked it enough that he took some for his lunch. Fresh parsley is key as is chilling before serving. Will definitely make again.

This is an awesome salad. We served it as a side with grilled salmon. Quick...easy...tasty. How do you beat that? We used fresh tomatoes from the garden and fresh parsley. The only thing I would do differently is use cherry tomatoes the next time...maybe try it with balsamic vinegar as well. But, it is great jus the way it is! Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

Soooo good!  I made some alterations that really made this an addictive salad.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, added 2 tbsp of balsamic, used white onion instead of red, organic red plum tomatoes, and to go with it I made a very easy Salsa!  The salsa is just a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, throw that in the blender with some cilantro and half an onion, some salt, sugar, and a tbsp of balsamic and you got yourself an amazing topping for this salad! --Goes great in a burrito too!

With some additions. >2 tbsp balsamic vinegar >1/2 c crumbled feta >1/4 c diced black olives   >only 1/4 c of parsley >sprinkle of salt-free lemon pepper >remove the salt  This may make it a completely different recipe but since I used this as a base I thought I would share my alterations.

I thought this was really good!  I didn't have any red onion on hand so just used white, but the red would really make for great color.  I also added half of a chopped and seeded cucumber and a couple splashes of red wine vinegar.

Great, versatile recipe. This was a bit bland when I first made it, but by the next day, all the flavors had married and it was delicious. You could definitely add additional vegetables, too.

A great little salad! We like chick peas so I knew we'd like this one. Next time I'll have to double it; this won't go far. Would like to add some corn, too, as other reviewers have made note of.

I would love to marinate chicken breasts with the ingrediants minus chick peas to see how it tastes.

I'm very fond of this one! I occasionally switch things up a bit, using some black-eyed peas or field peas with the chickpeas, but the end result is very similar.

Great multi-purpose recipe. Made a double batch and gave half to my dad for a healthy Superbowl snack and brought half to my sister while in the hospital after having her daughter. Super easy prep and clean-up and it keeps well in the fridge for a couple days. I upped the lemon and added a splash of balsamic vinegar, delicious!

good, but I was the only one in my family that liked it.  Course, I love chickpeas.  And, even I thought it was so so.  Maybe I'll try again in the summer when tomatoes are better.

Such a great easy salad recipe. Those who say its too much sodium.,you must first rinse the chickpeas before tossing with the other ingredients.This will reduce the sodium content of this dish. I also added chopped fresh oregano to the mix. Great for BBQ's or potlucks.

Very delicious with garden fresh tomatoes.  Don't dice the onion too big. I like to add a little chopped fresh mint along with the fresh parsley or half parsley, half cilantro. DON"T use dried herbs in this recipie! Try adding crumbled feta cheese and sliced pitted Kalamata olives, if you like them. If not, regular black olives may be substituted.  Prepare a couple of hours in advance for the flavors to marry. I also strongly prefer this served at room temperature.  Yum!

Fairly bland, but I like that it's very healthy and nutritious.  I added a cucumber for some additional volume and flavor.  I will also be adding some vinegar to give it a bit more flavor, but overall it was tastey.  LOVE garbanzo beans.

This was pretty good, especially considering how quick it is to throw together, and I liked that it only made a small amount to try it. Chickpeas/garbanzo beans only come in 16oz cans, so I just used that and it was also low-sodium and worked fine. The only thing I left out was the pepper, because I don't care for it, and we ate it right after it was made. I tasted what was left the next day and I actually preferred it fresh anyhow. With all the garlic and parsley the smell and taste gets too strong, in my opinion, when it sits. So, it did work good for a salad in a pinch.

I made this super quick & easy recipe over & over again.Just love chickpeas!Instead of canned beans,I always boil the hard chickpeas till cooked as this taste a lot better and u can cook them in a big batch,and store in the fridge for future use.For this recipe,I used 2 cups of cooked beans and added extra lemon juice. I sometimes add a handful of fresh chopped mint and a 1/4 green bell peppers,diced just for variation.This salad is very filling and yes,it looks pretty & appetizing :)

Love it, its my favorite way to eat chickpeas.  Makes a great side dish of main meal with some diced grilled chicken.  I add 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar for more flavor.

I just saw your salad and had to try it.  I've just finished making it.  I used a little more onion and added a half a reb bell pepper to it and a pinch of dried dill.  I had to use the dry parsley though.  It tastes great even before the cooling part.  I love to vary a lot when I try things but i'm sure the dill will add a little zest to it. I added a few chopped marinated italian mushrooms as well.

Light, refreshing, easy and tasty.  Perfect weekday dinner side dish.  Used oregano instead of parsley, and added a splash of red wine vinegar.  Nice way to use the Roma tomatoes from my garden.  Make it early in the day and let it in nap in the fridge, the flavors are really nice when given time to mingle.

Excellent salad. Easy, light, refreshing and very healthy. I added red bell pepper for some sweetness and reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon because I don't like my salads with too much oil. Served with grilled marinated shrimp (recipe on this site) and gazpacho. Very very good.

I loved this recipe and will make it again. Use fresh parsley and lemon juice, it makes a big difference. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar, as I thought the olive oil was a little heavy. But I will make this again. Thanks for a great and healthy recipe!

I loved this recipe! Used cilantro instead of the parsley and used grape tomatoes cut in half. I'm surprised there was any left because I was picking it out of the bowl as I was making it!

My family isn't a huge fan of chickpeas, but I had a can left over from God knows when and wanted to get rid of it.  The colors are pretty for summer, but it's really bland.  I make a tomato salad pretty much the same exact way, just minus the chickpeas.  We prefer it without.  Decent recipe though!

SO YUMMY!  Love salads like this, quick and healthy.  Did not add the onions as we don't care as much for raw onion, did add some orange pepper and used whole grape tomatoes.  I added equal parts of fresh lemon juice and olive oil, as I typically change my dressing ratios in terms of the oil/vinegar components.  Really fresh tasting, looking forward to leftovers tomorrow for lunch!

Very good recipe - the garlic was on the strong side for me but everyone else thought it was just right.  I just picked the garlic pieces out of my serving...It was delicious and easy to make.  A great side dish.

Fabulous salad, great taste.  I used two cloves of garlic that were a little bigger than normal & it turned out great.  Next time I make it I'll let the salad sit in the fridge and marinate for an hour or two to really bring out the flavors!  I give this one an A+++!

I followed this as best i could.  I used drained diced canned tomatoes because i was out of fresh.  I also added a green pepper because i had one i needed to use up.  This was FANTASTIC.  Perfect to take places or just to keep in the fridge as a side dish or to top a salad with.  I will make over and over.

Oh my goodness, this receipe is fantastic!!
I prefer lime instead of lemon - and I add a ton of crushed red pepper because I love everything spicy.
This chickpea salad is out of this world.  I could eat it everyday.
Thanks so much for such a great recipe!!!

I can't get enough of this stuff at the moment. The only thing I do differently is to add way more red onion than called for, and I also use dried parsley because I am not a fan of fresh. I agree that this definitely gets better sitting in the fridge overnight. Thanks so much, Jen Jen!

easy delicious recipe! I used yellow sunburst cherry tomatoes, and yellow onion. Fresh basil, parsley, thyme, and oregano all from my garden. I also used olive oil and red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice.

I give this 5 stars for being both healthy and delicious. I also used regular chickpeas and soaked it overnight instead of buying the canned ones. You can adjust the lemon depending on how tangy you want it to taste. I would make this over and over again.

OK, but bland, as is. Took it up a notch with balsamic vinegar. If you really want to take it up two notches, put on balsamic vinegar and Sriracha chili sauce.

So good! Simple ingredients combine for a wonderful flavour. I used sliced grape tomatoes instead of a whole tomato, and dried parsley since I didn't have any fresh. Delicious!

I added cumin and tumeriic for both health and flavor. Also, cut back a bit on the red onion, so as not to overwhelm the other ingredients.

This was amazing!  We like a little more tang in our dressing, so I juiced two lemons for this, and added a splash of balsamic.  It really does taste even more incredible once you let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours.  We literally drunk the "dressing" in the bottom of the bowl after we ate all the salad.

Super yummy!  The only thing I would have done differently is to add more lemon juice, I would have liked more acidity to the dish.  Very vegetarian friendly dish!  Hardy salad with great combination of flavors.  Loved it!  Will make it again.

I made this for a potluck where it was well received. Used 3 cans of chickpeas (didn't measure most ingredients as someone else suggested) and added some balsamic vinegar, an additional small clove of garlic and a bit of cilantro along with the parsley. My husband gives it a five star rating, I say 4.5 but let's not quibble  ;)  We are looking forward to the little bit of leftovers today.

I think this is a good base recipe, but found the flavour pretty bland and too garlicky (and I LOVE garlic). I ended up adding Greek dressing to it for flavour as I didn't have time to find another recipe. In the future I will use the main ingredients but find another dressing and not be adding garlic.

My husband and I really like this. I made it with parsley, exactly as written the first time. Made it again with cilantro, because I didn't have fresh parsley. We liked it both ways, but I added 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and some fresh spinach to the cilantro version because the dressing didn't seem strong enough. I think the cilantro may have a stronger flavor than the parsley, and it needed more flavor in the dressing.

I liked this, however the hubby didn't care for it at all.  Neither did the children. I was the only one who would eat it. Apparently none of them care for the beans. I suggest to others to do a survey of who in your family likes garbanzo beans before you fix this. Apparently the beans aren't as mainstream as I thought. If I make it again I will use a whole carton of grape or cherry tomatoes. I also like the balsamic suggestions. I will try that as well if I make again. This is NOT date night food. Major garlic breath with this one.

Very good! I added chicken for my (ahem) NON-vegetarian husband, a few extra chick peas and he really liked it. Next time I make this, I'll use a bit less oil--mine was a little too oily.

My whole family loves this recipe! I usually sprinkle in dried Italian seasonings instead of fresh, easier and faster for prep time for me. Everyone that tries this recipe loves it, even the picky eater in my house.

This is one of our new family favorites! I great way to get my boyfriend to eat his veggies, too. I've made it along with the recipe and I've also made this with whatever veggies I needed to use up, adding cucumbers, green peppers, etc. It's my new go-to dish when I need to bring something to a picnic. It's different from anything else and keeps well all day.

This is a great salad for picnics and camping! Lasts in a cooler. Since my family doesn't like tomatoes I just omit them and it's still yummy! One of our standard salads year round. Thanks Jen!

This recipe is a great base to add to, but by itself it seemed a bit lacking.  I added some balsamic vinegar and pepper to taste and some chopped kalamari olives for a little more flavor as well as some cubed cucumber to fill it out a bit. Fresh and filling!

Delicious! I cut the oil to 1 tbsp and, like other reviewers, added 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar. The result was excellent! The fresh parsley really makes this dish!

Pretty good, although I hate to say there is just a little too much garlic, which I never say. I had no parsley but added some dried basil. I will see how I feel tomorrow after it chills longer. Edited to add, that I ate one more time and haven't touched it since. What a waste of good ingredients.

This was quite good.  Added some fresh cilantro since I had some on hand.  Served this as a first course with mulligatawny soup. Put it in a lightly toasted pita pocket with a little sour cream.    Just edited this to bump it up to 5 stars.  After a few days in the fridge it just keeps getting better.

I thought this was really good. Simple yet tasty. I personally dislike raw onion, so ommitted it and threw in some cucumber and peppers for some crunch. Delicious!

I thought this seemed a bit boring when I made it as directed.  I added some more garlic and lemon and a few shakes of smoked paprika and cayenne.  I also added half of a roasted red pepper.  

I hope it tastes a bit more lively tomorrow!

This is delicious and so healthy.  I am always looking for ways to get more fiber in our diet.  I did add more lemon as I like that more tart lemon flavor.  Next time I make this I will add tuna and corn as some have suggested and make a main dish salad for dinner.  I live in Texas so the suggestion for half cilantro is out right now.  Hopefully I can add some of that in the future.

This recipe yielded a delicious and light side salad.  Would be a great salad to bring to a bbq.  Yummy yummy!  I would make it with just a little less parsley next time, I found that taste to be overwhelming at times.

Love chickpeas and love the recipe, although I will reduce parsley a bit next time.

Awesome! I used a little extra lemon (fresh squeezed). I will definitely make this again. It is great for a warm day :)

Great side dish with summer meals-nice and light.  I thought it tasted better the second day!

Myself and my kids absolutely loved this salad, I will make sure I make it at least once a week.

I added some bell pepper but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I Loved it and it got rave reviews from my friends.  I'm planning on keeping a batch in the fridge all the time.
