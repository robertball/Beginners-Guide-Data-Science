very yummy bread. I found though that I had to put some of the batter into another pan because it was more than my bread pan would hold. I will for sure be making this again!

Very yummy and super easy to make! It's very moist and I even slice it up for a quick toast before eating!

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. It was so easy to make and came out super moist. My whole family loved it. I placed it in a 9X13 inch pan and it only took 30 min. to cook. The raisins were a great addition (I soaked them in warm water for about 5 minutes before I added them.) But I think cranberries would be a great also.

The baking time for this is wrong. I baked it for an hour(as told) and it was not done. Had to bake it another 45 minutes was very dry but done. If I make this again I will split it into two baking pans.

My family had gotten tired of my Banana Bread IV (from this site) so I made this... I've been asked to make this over and over. With the nuts (I used pecans) and raisins and small bits of apples throughout the bread its a great dessert bread or as toast for breakfast. Thanks for posting!!!

This was big enough to spread into a 9x13 baking dish! I used apple pie spice added two small drained cups of diced apples and omitted the raisins. I think I might frost this with the Caramel Frosting from this site but I'm not sure if that'll be overkill. Smells divine. EDITED TO ADD: Meh. Seems to be lacking IMO.

I used 1/2 cup butter for less liquid-still doughy and NO flavor. I doubt I will try this recipe again. Sorry Amber.

Really good flavor but cooking it for a hour did not do the trick. The loaf was really heavy and still gooey inside. Next time I will split the batter between two smaller pans or something. It needs a longer cooking time. update: take a good look at the picture that goes with this recipe- it isn't a loaf pan. It is a 9x13 casserole dish. That is what makes the recipe go from thick gooey mess to an actually edible bread. spray a 9x13 casserole spread the batter in and bake- beginning to check after 50 minutes just to be safe.

Very minor alterations the first being a loose 1/2 cup of brown sugar rather than packed (I ran out). Also I added a dash allspice nutmeg and cloves. I also used dried cranberries rather than raisins. It smells SO good while it's baking!

Made this 2 days ago and it's gone now. I split the dough into 2. One loaf had no add-ins and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. A very nice quick bread. The other loaf (as pictured) had dried cranberries ground pecans and a quick streusel topping. This was much more like a special cake/dessert. Both were moist after 60 minutes in the oven. Next time I will either use 2.5 cups of flour or 2 cups of bread flour to get a slightly stiffer bread to slice and toast. I did put a slice of the bread that is pictured in the toaster but the apple to bread ratio didn't allow it to really toast up. It was simply warmed from the toaster but not sturdy enough to put some butter on. If that makes sense?

After reading the reviews I made the following changes: 1. baked it in a 9" pie pan as other people said there was too much batter for a loaf pan 2. Lessened the butter to 3/4 c and added 1/4 c applesauce 3. Left out the raisins as It was already going to be sugary enough 4. Used 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 c white sugar no brown sugar. 5. Substituted 1/2 c instant vanilla pudding and pie filling for 1/2 c flour. The flavor was great and it baked very well in the pie pan.

This is a delicious bread! I baked it in two bread loaf pans and it turned out perfect. Was so moist and yummy! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for posting.

I read the reviews first; then took the advise of many... make this in two pans. I used homemade apple pie filling and skipped the raisins. Made the house smell wonderful while baking on a cool Sunday morning. Thanks Amber for sharing.

Very good And it smelled sooo good while baking! I followed the recipe for the most part except I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and omitted the walnuts.

I used caramel-apple pie filling pecans and diced a few caramel chews. It was delicious! My family was thrilled. Apple pie bread has been requested since I prepared this. It was moist and decadent.

Thank you love that this recipe is still out here! Perfect for dessert! I needed something bigger (9x13) than a loaf & after all the "too much batter" comments I went for it! I only changed the spice (Hub loves apple pie spice) raisins out due to allergies & sub for walnuts with pecans for same reason. Wonderful light moist squares that I topped with warm apple butter...thought I was gonna have to fight just to get a piece! Shared website with 4 guests so they could have! This is a keeper!

I used a 9 x 13 metal pan and baked it for 30 minutes.  Turned out moist and delicious.  The next time I make this -- and I'll definitely be making this again--- I would add a cup of chopped apple pieces.  That was the only complaint....everyone wanted more apple inside.  This is more of a cake than a bread.  I did add a cinnamon glaze on top which I will do again.  Love this!

Easy to make.  I added one chopped granny smith apple to it.  I baked it per instructions, in two smaller loaf pans.  It was not done at all.  I did like the flavor.  I might try it again, but in a 9 x 13 pan or a jelly roll pan.  There is a lot of pie filling for just 2 cups of flour.

I had a can of pie filling and it was a cold rainy night I stumbled upon this recipe I am glad i did! Recipe was a big hit with my family! 3/4 of it was gone by the next morning. I used the 9x13 aluminum pan and it cooked in 30 minutes. Not sure anyone was using glass to bake in but they tend to take longer to cook. Only thing I might do next time is put more apples in because my teens likes them. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you!

Great recipe. I used a Bundt pan. I only used a 1\2can of pie filling.  I used 8T butter.  I added 1cup mashed bananas to compensate for the reduction in pie filling. (I had a half can left from another recipe and wanted to try this recipe so I improvised ) baking time in Bundt pan was 45minutes

So delicious! Changes I made: Used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c applesauce instead of 1 c butter. Omitted raisins (just because I didn't have any). Baked about 1 1/2 hours. This was very moist even with longer baking time.

I just tried this recipe (i noticed the other reviews were fr 10 years ago) and followed it exactly, except, I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan (as the other reviewer said) and baked it for 35 minutes. I turned out good and moist.
I also drizzled it with cinnamon glaze and it was a perfect bread for fall.
My son loved it so much!!!
