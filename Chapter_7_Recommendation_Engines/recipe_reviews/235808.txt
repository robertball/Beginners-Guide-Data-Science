I tried this tonight as a side dish for my family of four. We had some leftover butternut squash soup that I was looking to use and this fit the bill. It came out with a nice mild taste and pleased both of my kids. The only modification I made this time through was an addition of breadcrumbs to the top but that was due to those being a personal preference of my own.
