This turned out pretty good. Prepwork is super fast, love that slowcooker! Now mine was full to the brim, barely fit the zuccini in and it yields a whole lot of veggies. Next time I'll use a slightly smaller amount of vegetables. I did sear the roast before adding it to the veggies and cooked everything on high for four hours. Meat came out juicy and tender. I don't like gravy with cornstarch, so instead I drained the liquid and added some of the veggies, everything in the food processor and out comes a nice thick sauce that tastes delicious. You can add less veggies for a thinner sauce. Served over pasta and had left overs the next day.  Will make again.

Used a beef roast.  Made the "italian dressing mix" from this site as the dry rub called for.  Very moist, tasty and extremely easy.  Will be making again and again for sure.

This was absolutely delicious, everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of searing the meat first.  I used my dutch oven to slow cook it at 325 for 2hr then added the zucchini (had to try my new dutch oven! :)  We'll have this again!!  I served this with Garlic Parmesan Orzo, so delicious!

Made this minus the peppers (as I had none at hand). Tasted so yummy!

I'm not a big roast fan so I was surprised when I loved this dish.  Definitely a keeper!

Really great, especially with extra added veggies.
