Great recipe! Although I did make a couple of adjustments: I added a bit extra green curry paste (only 'cause I like it real spicy) and anyways, I think it has alot to do with what kind/brand of paste you buy, some are just spicier than others. I also added julienned red and green bell peppers(1/2 a pepper each), omitted the corn, added a little extra ginger, added fresh squeezed lime juice of 1/4 of one lime, and 1 1/2 tablespoon of white sugar, and I used a small handful of fresh cilantro leaves instead of the basil. It was remarkably close to the taste of the green thai curry dish at my fave thai restaurant! DELICIOUS!!!

My favorite food is green curry, and this dish was DELICIOUS! I recommend using less green curry paste to start off with, like the other users said. Thanks to them, I used only 1/2 tbs. of the paste and it still was pretty spicy! This recipe was about 18 dollars total if you do not have any of the ingredients. I also suggest getting jasmine rice from an asian grocery store and cooking it over the stove for about 15 minutes. The water level should be about 1 inch above the rice and cook it covered. Hope this helps! Definitely try it.

Great taste, Really really lovely taste. The dish lacked colour. I think I would add a bit of red pepper and/or carrot strips to it next time. And adding a bit of lime juice and a couple tsp of sugar reduces the hotness but retains the flavour. A little trick I learned in Thailand.

This was pretty good, and pretty easy to make.  I made it with pork instead of chicken, and it turned out great, though I'd recommend cooking the pork in a separate wok first, with the garlic & oil.  I also added potatoes to this, which I think worked out great, just make sure you boil the potatoes first to even out the cooking time.  I'm not a fan of eating bits of ginger, so I put in 5 very large slices, and fished them out later.  I also used fish sauce instead of salt, much more authentic.  And I'm confused by previous reviewsthat said they had to cut down on the spiciness; this was actually very mild curry, by any standard (wusses! LOL... either that or a huge variation in different brands of prepared green curry pastes).  I had to add in some fresh chopped hot peppers & ground pepper to really get it going.  I'm not a frequent cook, so it was a welcome relief to have such a simple recipe turn out so good; made lots and shared with others in my building, who loved it too; and then froze the rest.

I love this recipe! It's sooooo good!! Don't feel threatened by the unusual ingredients. You can improvise in a lot of ways if you want. I mix it up regularly. You can even use a different curry paste, too, but I think the green is the best. My favorite Thai dish ever! Thanks so much, Paintercook.

This recipe is decent.  THe lemon grass is a nice touch.  This recipe is missing three essential ingredients.... FISH SAUCE, chicken stock and brown sugar.  I always add 3 tbspoons fish sauce, 1/4 cup chicken stock and 2 tbspoons dark brown sugar.  I find that with these additions, this recipe really does taste like the green curry I find in local thai restaurants.

This was a great recipes to combine with the one I already use.  The additions that I made to what is posted is some of the straw mushrooms that you can find in the asian section.  They are canned in salt water. I also added a cup of chicken broth, we like the extra juice and it adds a little more flavor. A Tablespoon of brown sugar, some sliced bell peppers and fresh celantro.  We also use Japanese short grain rice or sushi rice.  Just a better texture for us.

my husband likes HOT.  i toned down to 1 tbsp of green curry (shrimp free)with a small extra squeeze, and it was very hot, to me.  he was left with a gentle tingle and probably would have enjoyed the full extra half TBSP, so those with high heat tolerance take note.  i added a tin of bamboo shoots, and used the light version of cocomilk.  dieters alert:  lite coco milk saves about 70 cals per portion and more than 8 grams of fat.  this was nice with basmati rice.   good recipe, my first ever curry.  two cleaned plates.

I followed this recipe exactly, but I wasn't too excited by the results. It was tasty enough and easy to make, but it didn't come close to the richness and complexity of green curries in Thai restaurants. Granted, I've been spoiled because I've always lived near excellent Thai restaurants, but I've never found a green curry recipe that comes close to approaching restaurant quality -- this one included.

Good, but a little too spicy if you follow the recipe. I use 1-2 tsp. of the curry paste instead. This recipe is also good if you use red curry paste.

The best thai curry I've ever made.  This works with red curry paste as well as green curry paste.  The only change I made is using fish sauce instead of salt.  The basil adds such a fresh flavor!

This was a great recipe...just a little too hot for my taste.  Next time, I'll reduce the amount of green curry paste.  My husband loved it too!

Tastes Great.  Very flavorful.  I used pork instead of chicken and added yellow and orange bell peppers, zucchini, broccoli, corn and some pineapple.  Topped with lime and cilantro like the other reviews suggested and what a meal it was!! served over jasmine rice.

Great thai curry flavour, but the vegetables didn't seem to blend into it nicely and detracted from the rest of the dish.

Pretty good. I'd cut down on the paste and add some oyster sauce for flavor. I'd also skip the salt and use fish liver oil instead which is what they use at thai resturants.

This was my first attempt at making Thai food, and I was pleased.  I must have not had a very strong green curry paste, though, because I put in about 2 tablespoons of it, and it still came out kind of bland.  I will make it again, and add more, though.  Excellent over jasmine rice, and I will try varying the veggies and adding different things.  Thanks!

This was good BEFORE I put the coconut milk in. Afterward it was very bland so I tried putting more and more seasoning to compensate, but it just didn't taste authentic. I'm going to either seriously adjust the coconut milk or scratch this recipe altogether.

Very good recipe.  Small changes I made - instead of chicken breast 4 skinless chicken thighs & 1 small bok choy, 1 green chili pepper and 2 Tbsp green chile paste. I've added to my recipe box since we'll be making this one again.

Excellent - I make it with tofu instead of chicken, reduce the coconut milk to about a third of a cup, and augment it with chicken stock.

I cut the green curry paste down to 1/2 TB and that was plenty for us. I also served this over rice and with the Thai Cucumber Salad recipe from this site and it was a pretty good dinner.

Absolutely fabulous.  Better than this same dish at your local Thai restaurant.

I added a can of bamboo shoots.  I also keep an extra can of coconut milk handy.  If you reheat left overs of this, add a little more coconut milk and it keeps it smooth and rich.

We serve this with Jasmine rice.  Simply delicious!

Delicious meal, and easy and fast to make. I had a hard time finding the right "thai" fish sauce, but all the effort paid off. A family favourite for sure.

excellent!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with sliced cucumber to clense the palet and cool down between bites, I also used jasmine rice because I prefer it to ordinary rice.  It was a welcome addition.

I've made green curry lots of times using Thai paste, coconut milk, an onion and maybe some vegs and hoped this recipe would give it restaurant quality. Didn't happen, I actually added about 21/2 Tbsp Thai Green Curry paste and still it wasn't hot. Fish sauce was a good idea, thank you. On the whole it was pleasant, satisfying but a bit lacking something and I think just reading the instructions on the paste can can give very similar results.

Very good--but don't let the nice gentle aroma fool you--it's VERY spicy (in a good way).  I actually ended up over-doing it with the curry paste...I added more than called for and couldn't finish it because my mouth went numb.  But I REALLY wanted to finish it!

this was an excellent recipe but too spicy for us.. I will cut the green curry paste way down next time.  While trying to cool it down a bit I added pineapple juice and bits and it was delicious but still too hot.  I learned that sour cream cools it down a bit but alters the flavour too much.  I will make it again with less spice otherwise a gem!

I use this recipe on a regular basis, very easy to make and if you don't have all of the ingredients it's easy to adjust.

Maybe I did this wrong, but I followed the directions as best as I could and made a green curry that was "okay" but not 5 Stars.  I was expecting a curry like we get at the thai resteraunt with a creamy flavoursome green sauce.  however this recipie looked a bit like a green curry, but tasted more like a jungle curry.

Great recipe that I’ll definitely make again! I substituted onion for shallots, used zucchini, carrots, bell pepper, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts, and heated my coconut milk and added 1/4 C coconut sugar to it. It gave the dish a lovely light sweetness that paired perfectly with the spiciness and aromatics of the Thai basil.

This is an ok base recipe.  I thought it needed more flavor - I added fish sauce, lime juice and brown sugar and that helped.

Good recipe, but I had to make mods to it.  I didn't add sugar. Also, with a corn allergy, I substituted extra broccoli.  Extra spices were kaffir lime leaves and lots of basil vs cilantro. And I brown the chicken in a 2:1 melted combo of coconut oil and butter (which I use for everything)  I liked the addition of shallots and fish sauce, which added another dimension to the meal.  Thanks.

Made as written, this would def not be fit for my king or the queen for that matter. Doctored up as mentioned by others it was wonderful. Three stars as written and five stars with changes made equals my four star rating. I made as directed and realized quickly that this needed some help. I added about a quarter pound of fresh green beans to the chicken saute step because my fav thai restaurant always does. After tasting the completed dish, I added 1 Tablespoon fish sauce, 1 Tablespoon packed brown sugar and 2 Tablespoons lime juice. I did NOT have thai basil so I added a handful of cilantro. The embellished recipe was delicious and I will edit and save this according to my taste. BTW I am a heat wimp, but my curry paste was mild (they vary in heat) so I used the full amount of curry paste gradually, tasting after each addition. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good! I can't say that I prepared it exactly as it's listed because I added another tablespoon of green curry and a 8oz can of bamboo shoots as well.

The only thing keeping this recipe from 5 stars is the lack of Prik Kee Noo.

Delicious and easy! This was my first time making Thai curry (even though I've had it many times in restaurants) and I was surprised at how well it turned out. I would recommend squirting a little lime and garnishing with cilantro right before serving because it makes it taste really fresh. I also reduced the amount of baby corn in it because a full 15 oz. can seemed like a lot.

Pretty bad.  Too many spices and way too spicey.  the curry stunk up my house for days afterwards, and I normally like curry and love Thai food.
