If you like watermelon you will enjoy this drink. Great tasting as is or add a touch of Midori Melon for another yummy taste. I did not bother double straining the drink because I don't mind bits of watermelon floating around. (I just picked out any of the little white seeds that made it through.) I also chilled the shaker in the freezer and added a few ice cubes to the liquid in the shaker. Can't wait to share this one with friends.

This is just what I was looking for.  I needed a recipe that did not call for frozen watermelon since I had not planned ahead.  I just did not know how much watermelon to add - I needed a bit more - I think about 2 cups of pieces might be okay.  It was wonderful after adding a bit more.  Thank you!
