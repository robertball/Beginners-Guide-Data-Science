This is a great recipe.  I was in a huge hurry, so instead of cooking bacon, I used an entire bottle of real bacon bits.  I also used an entire bottle of "Hidden Valley" ranch dressing, which ended up being 16 oz.  I dumped an entire bag of shredded cheddar cheese, which is about 2 cups and mixed it all together.  I was only able to refrigerate it for about 2 hours and it was still delicious.  I'm sure it will be even better after it has set overnight.

I doubled the bacon and the green onions and I used my own ranch dip. I didn't have time to refrigerate it overnight but I did make it early this morning before it got hot and stuck it to set in the fridge all day until dinner. This was good but I think it all depends on how spiced up your ranch is. Make sure you taste test it to make sure it dosen't need more spices before you serve it.

Very easy to make. I halved the recipe and didn't have time to let it sit overnight, and it was still very tasty. I will be making this again!

This was pretty good. May have been better with a better quality ranch dip. Next time I will use Hidden Valley.

At first I was worried but once I tried it after it chilled for awhile....YUMMMMMM!!!  I really hope everyone likes it because if they don't I'll eat it all. Very easy and quick to make!

This is a huge hit with my family.  Been making this potato salad for years.  Although I have never put cheese in the recipe. And I used a pound of bacon in each salad. Yum.
