Full disclosure - I made a lot of changes, but I'm still reviewing. I was looking for an interesting pasta dish for dinner and had to use what I had on hand. That said, using this recipe as a base, I kept to the general flavors and principles...verdict: yum! The concept is really good. I had 2 poblano peppers and 2 jalapeno peppers, which I roasted in the oven rather than pan-roast. Same effect. I added a 4-oz can of chopped chilies as well. I used half a brick of light cream cheese and half a container of sour cream, fat free half and half, and just enough pasta water to get the consistency I wanted. Added more salt to taste. Next time I might add cumin as well. I used whole wheat pasta, and this ended up being a little more healthy and delicious!

I made a few adjustments for lack of ingredients, but still came out very delicious!
I did however roast the chilies outside on my grill a couple a days before, cleaned them by removing the seeds, membrane  & peel, then refrigerated until use. I don’t like the smell of roasted chilies in my home.
I only had one (1) jar of crema as that’s all my husband purchased, I thinned the chilies, crema, garlic with milk in blender until well blended.
I topped my dish with cotija cheese & husband chose Parmesan. I have to say.. I thought my dish was better tasting. I also thought it needed a little more salt but is preferential.
