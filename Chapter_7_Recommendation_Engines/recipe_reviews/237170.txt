This is a very basic salad to which so much more can be added, but which if left simple, is still quite tasty and healthy. I added my favorite dressing - golden balsamic vinegar. Other times I add strawberries and shredded chicken for a heartier lunch. But any way you fix it, this salad is delicious!
