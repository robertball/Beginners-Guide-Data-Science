I thought this was good and it was even better the next day. Only change I made was cutting the red peppers and onions in half and I used red onion diced small. Next time I would just cut back the onions only. I would also probably add more green beans. I used canned and they worked very well with this dressing. I liked the green beans more than the beans. This is a basic and good all purpose recipe for a classic bean salad. I might experiment with other beans also as suggested of a smaller type. I got about 4 servings.

I liked this recipe and my family did as well. I changed the lima beans, which we don't care for, to Edamame (frozen shelled) which adds a lot of protein.

This recipe was okay. I forgot to add sugar, and estimated the amount of ingredients because I was too lazy to measure them out. It was easy to make, but not the tastiest salad I've ever had.
