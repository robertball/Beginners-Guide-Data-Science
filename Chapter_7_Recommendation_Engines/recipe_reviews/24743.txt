I have to admit I wasn't sure about this recipe, but I needed a side dish and I had printed this one a while back.  I thought the 2 envelopes of onion soup mix might be too much, but boy was I wrong.  This was very good.  It has a nice blend of flavors and textures.  The crispy noodles on top and the water chestnuts add the right amount of crunch.  My husband told me he wouldn't mind if I made this once a week!!

Loved this dish! I left out the water chestnuts because none of us care for them, and I used vermicelli, broken into small pieces instead of the thin egg noodles. This recipe is going to be part of my regular rotation for sure.

I have made this twice now for dinner guests, and they always rave about it.  My family loves it as well.  They call it my 'homemade Rice-A-Roni', and will not eat the boxed version anymore!  This dish is MUCH better!  When making it for a dinner party, I make it the day before.  I under cook it by several minutes, let it cool, cover it, and stick it in the refrigerator.  An hour before I am ready to serve it, I take it out of the refrigerator, and let it get to room temp. Then I pour about 1 cup of extra broth all over the top of the rice to moisten it.  Cover with foil, and cook at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Check for heat and doneness, adding more broth if needed.  Comes out perfect every time!

This rice has a mild but delicious flavor  It is a great side dish when you're serving other dominant flavors.  The recipe as followed makes a very large amount enough for a big crowd.  Enjoy!!

Really tasty side dish if you don't mind the high-sodium content. :) I halved the butter, used jasmine rice instead of instant, & added 1 lb fresh mushrooms (sauteed). We loved the results! The rice cooked up perfectly fluffy & flavorful. This was a great addition to the Christmas table. Will be making it again! Thank you for the recipe! :)

This is a great side!  I just happened to have everything on hand for this and was looking for an easy side to make.  The only thing I changed was using rice vinegar instead of the soy sauce (I was out of soy)  We all enjoyed it.  Thanks Ryan!

I was surprised at what a hit this was at our house.  I hardly ever use instant rice, preferring the real stuff in both taste and texture, but there is so much additional flavor going on here that I didn't even notice it was instant.  I did add too much soy and that taste was a little over powering.  The soup mix was a nice touch and I will make this again for sure.  My picky husband even liked it and he hates rice.  Thanks Ryan for a great easy recipe that isn't from a box.

I halved the recipe.  I used homemade dry onion soup mix in which I used low sodium beef bouillon (see this site for recipe).  I added diced carrots and I think it would benefit from fresh mushrooms.  I subbed water for half the broth and used beef broth.  I used thin spaghetti, broken up and instant brown rice.  I did not add extra salt and even with the low sodium bouillon it was mildly salty.  I most likely will be making this recipe again.

I'm glad I came across this recipe.  If you like Rice-A-Roni, this is your home made version of that dish. I happen to like it and my favorite part about this dish were the different textures.  The rice, the noodles (I used Vermicelli) and the crunchiness of the Water Chestnuts provide that.  I did cut down on the butter and used 5 tbs. instead. The area that I feel could be improved upon is the flavor, the dry onion mix gives it a subtle flavor but I think that it could be better by adding diced celery, parsley, and/or other herbs and spices.  Be careful with the salt!  I used 1 1/2 pkg. of Onion soup mix.  I'm interested to play with that part of the recipe next time because it has potential to be great but this is still extraordinary as it was written.

Used 1 T light butter to sautee the angel hair in and it still turned out awesome.  I could have eaten the whole dish.  Hint: you can buy broken angel hair in the hispanic sections of most grocery stores.

My family loved this side dish.  It was really tasty.  I used quick brown rice instead of the white rice.  I, too, could not find thin egg noodles so I used angel hair pasta that I broke up into short pieces. Almost everyone had two helpings of this dish.  One of my daughters does not like onions, so she said she would make it with beef broth and just one package of onion soup mix if she were going to make it.  I will definately be making this recipe for company.  Thanks Ryan for sharing it.

I am making this right now, and some other reviwers said it was too salty so I only added one packet of onion soup.. but I just tried it and it wasn't cooked enough/nor nearly flavorful enough, so I added the second packet and some extra water.     I added one small chopped onion and some chopped baby carrots for more veggies and I didn't have noodles or water chestnuts so they got left out.   I think this will be an interesting side dish that can be altered in cool ways!!   I will continue the review in about 20 min when I retest it :)   ok... so with the extra packet of soup, AND liberal soy sauce.. this finally has some flavor..   I don't know if I will make this again, but maybe!  I think this would be better with the noodles..

This turned out perfect. It was so tasty. I used Beef Broth instead of Vegetable Broth and I added half a can of crushed tomatoes because I had an open can in the fridge. I also only used one package of onion soup mix. Next time I might add more tomatoes.

The rice (I used brown rice) did not cook through, so there was a crunchy gross texture. Did I just not see something in the directions about the rice? I was hoping this would be as I remembered ricearoni...very displeased. If I missed a step, please advise, I'd like to try it again. I followed it to a t.????confused.

My whole family loves this.  Does well at potlucks.  I used about 1/2 or less of the butter.  Full amount is too much, leaves a greasy feeling in your mouth.

My family liked it.  I did not have the onion soup, so I just put in some spices and I put in mushrooms.  I served it with ribs.  It was a nice change from normal rice.  I will make it again.

Not usually fans of Box-a-Roni type side dishes, the family enjoyed this recipe.  Scaled down the measurements by half and found the rice was done after 30 minutes.  Next time I'll add some frozen peas and/or mushrooms.  Tasty!

This recipe is soooo good.     It actually makes a lot more than 6 servings (but the leftovers are great!)

I use 2 cans of French onion soup instead of the dry soup mix and 2 cans of chicken broth.     

Enjoy!!!

I thought this was too salty and I wasn't a big fan of the combinations this dish put together. My boyfriend on the other hand loved it.

Like so many others, I found it too salty, even though I left out the soy sauce.  I refrigerated the left overs with a cut up raw potato mixed in and it was fine the next day after the potato absorbed some of the excess saltiness.  Next time I will add less onion soup mix and put in more spices such as onions, celery, etc. and it should be fine.

Great!  My husband really liked this; next time I make this I will exclude the water chestnuts.

This was good and better than the packaged flavored rices but really nothing to rave about. We found it too salty, even though I used low sodium soy sauce. I think maybe 2 packages of soup mix is just too much. It was also quite greasy. I might try this again using only 1 package of soup and 1/4 cup of butter.

Tried this last night. The family liked it but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I thought that it was a bit too buttery. If I make this again in the future, I will cut down the amount of butter. I used broken spaghetti as another reviewer suggested and used instant brown rice and it worked fine.

This is one of those dishes that is really good for 1 or 2 servings, but it's so strong that you get sick of it FAST.  I got compliments from my family, but no one ate the leftovers.

I was not impressed with this dish.  The flavor was okay, but the texture was odd.

Fabulous recipe and I gave it  4 stars only because of the changes I made. I used regular long grain white rice with about an extra 1/2 cup of water,  half the butter, no soy sauce, vermicelli  instead of egg noodles, and added a few sliced baby Portabellas and sliced carrots. The kids raved about it and I thought it was better than my  go-to pilaf recipe I've used for 35 years.  Thanks for the recipe!

So much to love about this rice.  Wonderful flavors, crunch and it is pretty.  The leftovers are even better.  I do need to be low sodium so instead of the rice mix and dried onion soup mix I mixed wild and long grain rice, chopped onion, parsley and used low sodium beef boullion to reduce the sodium content.

I'm sorry I let this recipe sit in my box so long without making it. This was excellect. My picky middle child went back for fourths!!! I didnt have thin egg noodles so I used wide and really liked the difference in sizes. I also left out the water chestnuts since I'm really not crazy about them. I prepped and added it all an hour before I popped it in the oven so it took less time. I also covered it because my oven burns anything I dont. 100 stars all the way (per my 3 kids). This does actually make about 10 normal servings. Next time I will cut it in half for out family of 5. This went well with baked jerk chicken.

I was hoping this was going to be good, well we didn't like it at all. I think it was salty and my noodles didn't stay crispy. To bad because it sounded good.

This was very good.  I liked the textures and the combination, but I found the onion soup to be a little overpowering.  I think next time, I will either cut it in half, or completely leave it out and use a strongly flavored chicken or beef stock instead.

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. It was not terrible, but it just wasn't on the money, could have been better.  I have eaten something like this at a brunch before and it was much better.  But I did eat it so it wasn't horrible and it def. is an inexpensive recipe that makes a very large quantity.
