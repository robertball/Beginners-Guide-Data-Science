This was a great hit at a party I had last summer.  Since then, any party I am invited to, everyone requests that I bring this sangria.  So easy to make and really hits the spot in the summer time!

I made this for a girls' night party, and loved it!  It was a bit strong, but we added some diet Sprite and that helped dilute it.  I will definitely make this again.

great recipe I used a cheap Burgundy and a little less sugar ... make just a few hour ahead and chill so flavors meld...not good leftover even one day

This sangria was okay. The reason why I decided to make it was because it did not require overnight chilling. It was a good sangria to make on the fly for a spur of the moment dinner (that's what I needed it for) but wasn't the best sangria I have ever had. Very easy to make though...

As much as I love sangria, I didn't think it'd be a good idea to use a full gallon of wine for just the two of us. I ended up scaling this down for 1 bottle (1/5th of recipe)of wine. I love the use of pineapple juice and pineapple chunks. I ended up adding in the full 8oz can of pineapple chunks, otherwise, 1/5th of the can only had me adding 3 chunks to the whole sangria! I also found it to be a bit too tart, so the full can of pineapple took care of the needed extra sweetness.  A simple and tasty sangria. I'd recommend adding in more pineapple and letting it sit for an hour or two for the flavors to blend. I didn't like it as much when I first mixed it, but after it sat for a while, it really developed a nice tropical undertone.
