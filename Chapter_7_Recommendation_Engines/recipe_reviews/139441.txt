Very good, and very quick and easy.  I could not bring myself to add the mayo--it could be wonderful with it and I wouldn't know.  I'm just not a mayo fan, and I wasn't brave enough to try it tonight. However, with the other ingredients it was very nice.  A bit sweet, but not too sweet, and I like the use of grenadine in this dip.  I certainly wouldn't have thought of that myself!  We ate with strawberries, but I think would be good with other fruit too, especially apples.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've tried this twice, with and without the mayo. And I must say that the mayo does "weigh" the flavor down - the distinct mayo taste comes through even after melding in the fridge overnight. I tried adding more (powdered) sugar, but that just made it more sweet. I tried a touch of white balsamic vinegar, and that helped. However, the second time I made it without the mayo it came out quite great, much "fresher" and light. The grenadine is what makes this dip.

I was too busy to make this for a party, so I farmed it out to an idiot friend of mine who was actually able to follow the simple directions.  It was an absolute hit.  Everyone commented that they liked it because it was delicious but also different for a change.

I only made 4 servings since it was just for me and I only had 1 apple to dip. I used fat-free plain yogurt, 2 tablespoons each grenadine & sugar and instead of the calculated amount of mayo I should use I only used a slightly heaped teaspoon. There was no mayo taste, it just made the consistency perfect for dipping. Easy and tastes great, so will make again!

Yummy! Cheap to make, kids love it. Don't go buying that garbage that they sell in plastic tubs at the produce aisle. Make this just the way you like it. Tastes fine with lite ingredients too.

I wanted a fruit dip asap for last minute invitation.  Only had yogurt, cream cheese and sugar on hand. Used strawberry yogurt instead of vanilla yogurt. Gave it a nice strawberry taste, and made up for no grenadine. Wouldn't have added mayo anyway (yuck!). I made less than recipe, so basically mixed half more yogurt than there was cream cheese. As yogurt was flavored and sweet enough, just added approx. 2 tsps. sugar. Whipped it all up, put in fridge approx. 1 hour and it was ready to go! Delicious!  And big hit with my mixed fruit tray.
