My husband and I now live in Ireland. This was excellent! I no longer own a food processor, so I simply "cooked" the dates until they were smooth. Having read lots of Sticky Pudding recipes, I desired a thicker sauce. I cooked the sauce to more of a caramel. Removed the puddings from the pan, placed a small amount of sauce in the individual dishes, placed the puddings and poured the sauce over them and let them sit. They were placed back into the oven prior to serving to warm them and the sauce. Exactly how they are "done" over here. Next time I will serve them with a traditional custard as well. Thank you for sharing an easy and great recipe.

Delicious!  I've been searching for a sticky toffee pudding recipe like the kind I had in Edinburgh and this is pretty darn close.  Definitely 5 stars for taste, but 3 stars for the process and amount of dishes you get dirty.  As others have stated this would be great for dinner parties since it makes 12 individual servings but if you have some leftover like me, refrigerate the puddings with some sauce on top of each one since it thickens as it cools.  Microwave an individual portion and it's just as good as straight from the oven.  I served mine with vanilla ice cream.  Very, very good but will make only once in a while since each pudding is over 500 calories.

This was absolutely amazing!!  I made it just to get rid of some dates that I had and was VERY pleasantly surprised.  I don't think I would only make half of the sauce, as one reviewer suggested.  All of the sauce will be used up.  I invited my critical neighbour over to try it and his face lit up with joy when he took the first bite!  I'm pretty sure eating this put him in a better mood. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and light margarine instead of butter in the sauce.  The taste was great but I'm sure the thicker sauce that would have resulted from using the heavy cream would have been amazing. I will definitely be making this again!

A great recipe, YUMMMYY! I did few alterations, I replaced dark choco (didn't have any) with coca powder and I have cut back half of the sauce. I HIGHLY recommend it.

This was FANTASTIC! I made mini cakes as well as muffins and they turned out soft and fluffy!  I haven't tried the sauce. Just made the cakes.   I did make a few changes *cut the sugar down, (out of 375g -> 200g)  *1/3 of the flour, I used wholemeal flour  *used self raising instead of adding baking powder *1/3 of the liquid added to the pot with the dates was orange juice [got that from other recipies] *used margarine instead of butter cause thats what I had [ can't tell the difference ] Note:  I found the mixture after cooking, was too thick to be blended successfully but was already so mushy the blending wasn't really needed.   In the future I would:  completely use only wholemeal flour for a more gritty earthy taste? Maybe add some nuts.  Will make again.

Wow, what a winner.  I made this for a group of mates for an after bbq pudding, and went down a treat as it was a really cold night and the guys were frozen. Having individual servings was fantastic and made a double recipe so have frozen the few that were left over.  They are very sweet and rich though so cant eat too many (which is probably a good thing!!).  Just divine, thank you so much for a fantastic recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  Didn't change a thing besides reducing the sauce part by half.  Family loves them.  All the ladies at ladies night raved. The guys at work couldn't get enough.  And me ... I would say this is one of my favorite puddings.  If your concerned about it tasting like dates, two of my children don't like dates but loves this. Also don't be concerned if the mixture is a thinner consistency than muffins.   Thanks Lian W for sharing.

I baked this last night for a dinner party and everybody loved it. It was light and moist and the muffin portion was the perfect serving size. I made exactly as the recipe stated. Definitely will make it again.

This was a surprise!  Cannot taste the dates but makes a lovely moist chocolate muffin which is excellent with the rich sauce.  I would make less sauce next time (3/4 recipe) as I thought really too much... but it WAS delicious!!

A 5-star recipe for no doubt. My husband, my two friends and I just came back from Australia. We all fell in love with this dessert, which we could find in almost every restaurant. We ordered it from different restaurants but we love our first experience the best.  The texture of the pudding from our first trial was very moist and tasted more dates. I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is worth 5. Everybody raved it. However, I'm going to experiment with more dates and try to make a 6-star recipe for myself. We'll see.

My bf took one bite and declared it the best date dessert I ever made, and getting dates by the kilo several times a year, I make a lotta date recipes. This made 24 mini cupcakes (cooked for 12 minutes first) plus 5 regular sized cupcakes and fearing all the fat I cut the butter down to 1/2 C for the sauce, it wouldda been too much with a full cup. Soo good!

Incredible texture -- light but chewy and moist.  I made this without the sauce because we do not like over-the-top sweetness.  I used chocolate chips (because that's what I had on hand) instead of shaved dark chocolate.  To incorporate the chocolate into the batter, I melted the chips into the date and water mixture after turning off the heat but still hot.

This cake is AMAZING!  Everytime I make it, I have people raving and asking me to make it again (mind you, I'm only 13). I use orange juice instead of water for cooking the dates in and replace the chocolate with 2 tbsp of cocoa powder/hot chocolate powder. Definitely make the cakes in Ramekins (I use 2 or 4 oz ramekins). Also, cook the toffee syrup a little longer for something thicker. Great cakes!

It turned out well; I like the suggestion of other reviewers, to melt the chocolate into the dates water, and also the muffin size helps tremendously when you have company. I baked them just for family and omitted the sauce, so I cannot vouch for it. But I'm sure it will bring them over the top.

This has turned into one of my favourite recipes ever. Soooooo tasty! I bake the puddings in muffin forms, then serve them with vanilla ice cream and frozen cranberries - they make the whole arrangement look very pretty!
Making half the sauce is definitely enough, like others before me have stated.

This was good and light-tasting, however, it's not the sticky date pudding I'm used to back in OZ. The sauce needed to be thicker in my view and perhaps next time I'll add a lot more dates. Also, recipe back home did not have chocolate. This was a decent substitute and it's a keeper, but I'll continue to search for the perfect Sticky Date Pudding. Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great! I had some fresh dates that we received for Christmas, so I pitted them and reduced the water to about  1/2 cup. I also added a little salt and about 1/4 tsp of rum flavoring to the sauce. We will definitely make this again.

This wasn't really a sticky date pudding. This is more like a chocolate caramel sauce pudding? Could hardly taste the dates and doesn't taste anything at all like what we're used to when tasting a sticky date pudding.
