We made this today and it is really good tasting.  It blends together really smooth in our blender and reminds me of pepperkakor cookies we like, without as much sugar.  We ate it on cornbread and look forward to eating on it for a while, if it lasts.  Followed the recipe just as written, well pleased with the results.  An excellent use for lots of acorn squash from the food co-op!

Tastes very similar to apple butter.  I broke my blender in the middle of the process so mine came out a little chunkier than intended I think but it was really good.

There is NO getting around the fact that this is squash!  LOL!  It was a nice change from apple butter and mine baked up nicely and was extremely smooth.  I omitted the clove as I didn't have any and substituted spiced apple cider for the apple juice.  I made 1/3 of the recipe and needed a bit more than 4 oz of liquid, but no big deal.  It would be fantastic on pumpkin bread.  Thanks!

It was a little rich, but still pretty good.

I enjoyed this recipe. I had a lot of acorn squash after they were on sale and did not know what else to do with them. I made this recipe and put it in freezer bags so I could have it over time. I thawed it out, put it into a jar and have been having it on toast in the morning. Even shared it with family as a gift and they are all loving it as well. They like that it’s a veggie instead of a fruit butter since it sounds healthier. I like the taste and the apple juice in it gives it a good flavor. It does not make it taste like apple butter of course but it is good. I really like it. Now that I have given it all out I want to go buy more acorn squash the next time it’s on a good sale again. Thanks for the recipe.
