Well, I liked it, and my family raved tonight.  I like the way the potatoes absorb the lemon juices & the spices.

I added onions.  Next time I make it I'm going to put a good bit of the rub under the skin and let it marinate for an hour or two.

THANKS

This was delicious!  I ground all the spices fresh (I had whole of everything) after toasting them. I also tossed the potatoes and carrots in a bit of olive oil & salt to help with seasoning and browning. I also cranked the heat to 400 for the last 30 minutes to help with browning. Delicious!

This was fabulous...and easy too! I did get a little paranoid and poured about a cup of warm chicken broth over the bird half way through cooking as it looked like it was getting dry, but it was not, (broth did not ruin the recipe either). Next time I think that I will let the chicken marinade a bit for a fuller flavor.

Excellent. we really enjoyed this recipe. Not a fan of mint or fennel I dropped that out and dropped the salt to 1 tsp. Put two stalks of celery in cavity with lemon to ensure moistness (it did!). Put halved onion and some whole garlic cloves in pan along with other veg. Took Tent off and raised heat to 400 for last 15 min.

Very interesting mix of spices and herbs. Never thought of mixing them up. I tried it on quails though, you should try them, they're more tender than chicken.

Pretty ordinary.  I've had authentic Moroccan food and this doesn't live up to it.  Pretty bland.  For those wishing to try it, plan in advance to gather the large list of spices.  I did like the idea of stuffing the bird with lemons and will try that in another dish.

I did it on the BBQ at low heat 275' for 1 hour 15 mins. I doubled to herbs and loaded it on to the bird with a brush every 15 mins. Was amazing!

This was absolutely delicious, and the lemons inside the body combined with the foil tenting rendered the juiciest bird ever!  I doubled all the spices since I was using an 8-lb bird, but the only change I made was to add turmeric to the mix.  The vegetables soak up all the spices and are incredibly savory and satisfying. The next time I make this I will probably rub some of the spice mix under the skin before roasting.

This was very good. The chicken was juicy and tender. However we had to cook longer than the recipe stated to get the chicked cooked all the way through. I also think that this would be better made with butter and a dry spice rub.

this was very good.. i just mixed everything together and used it as a marinade for 4 chicken quarters.. only difference was using dried mint, garlic powder for fresh, and a little less salt 2 tsp.. we put this on the grill and loved the results.. i'm sure the potato/carrot mixture would have tasted awesome underneath.. ty for the recipe

I used fat free yogurt to make the spice paste, but did everything else according to recipe.  We very much enjoyed this moist flavorful chicken with a very predominate lemon flavor.  If I made again I would cut back on the juice to let the other flavor out a bit more

I loved it. The flavors were a wonderful balance; nothing overpowered. The lemon added a refreshing accent to the mixture of spices. I thought the chicken would be hot spicey, but not at all.

Flavorful combination of spices & easy to make. I made a large batch of the dry spices & used 1T of the blend to add to the paste. Not a ‘hot’ spicy flavor or as strong as I had expected. The lemon helped keep the chicken juicy. The vegetables didn’t brown or absorb the flavor as much as I had expected, however the family really enjoyed it.  Will definitely make it again.

I baked it at 375 for an hour and 15 min.  We loved it! Such great flavor with a crispy skin.  I will definately make it again.

Made this recipe on a lark. It was amazing! We didn't have the cardamon on hand, but the recipe still turned out delicious. It was very much worth the prep involved.  As recommended, we threw in potatoes and carrots, as well as mushrooms. The seasoning was perfect for those additions also.

I was quite disappointed in this. Although the spice mixture smelled good, it didn't transfer to the chicken. DH ate the dark meat and liked it but the breast meat didn't pick up much if any of the spice paste. Perhaps if I had spread the paste under the skin as another reviewer suggested that would have helped. The lemon in the cavity did infuse the breast with lemon flavor but that completely overwhelmed any flavor from the spice paste. All in all too much work for too little flavor.

Made as written.  Served it for a Sunday dinner.  I was told multiple times how good dinner was.  This is a keeper.  I used drippings and white wine which  made a wonderful tasting gravy.

When I moved away from my favorite Moroccan restaurant (Ali Baba in Newark, DE), I longed for the taste of their wonderful spicy roast chicken. This recipe is as close as it gets. Moist, tender, flavorful. My mouth is watering just thinking about making it for company next week.

Second time making this. I love it. i plan on making this once a week till we get tired of it. i brine the chicken overnight using the "savory brine" recipe so I skip the salt in the rub. I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because 1/8 teaspoon measurements for a whole chicken really bugged me. i rounded the spices to 1/4  teaspoons or whole teaspoons.  I don't like how i have to mess up my grinder and blender just to get a chicken in the oven but it is worth it.  The first time we cooked it for longer on a lower heat and that was delicious.  I might try this rub with boneless chicken breasts.
