I spent a lot of time this year, trying 5 different kugel recipees. By the time I'd tried them all, I finally figured out the main problem with all of them was: no directions to cover the darn thing while it was cooking. If, after the pudding is set, you want to brown the top, then turn the broiler on for a few minutes (2-3) and remove the cover. However, all of us came to the conclusion that the best was simply to leave it covered the entire time. This recipe had a particularly a nice taste, even though I had reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. However, since I was making it for Passover, I didn't put in the graham crackers -- and don't ever remember having a Kugel with this in the past. This recipe, though, did give me the most important information to finally develop my own kugel which is what I was after: trying to recreate the taste and texture from my Bubbe (great grandmother). I did make quite a number of changes in the end, but without this one, I would never have figured it out at all.

This is sooo easy to make & it's sooo good to eat!  I add black raisins for a change & it seems the kids compete for how many they get per serving!

Every year we try a new noodle pudding and I usually do something to make it my own.  With hardly any variation (I just had to change the topping due to shortage of graham crackers) my family said I had found THE ONE!  Thanks for the great recipe!

A wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe as written except that I used Angel Hair pasta (which I broke up into at least 1/3 pieces) because that's what I had) and it turned out great. A very nice offering when you're in a pinch. (I've only made this once so far, so I'm not sure, but I'm thinking that next time I make this, I'll omit the sugar and incorporate some thinly sliced onions as well as some shredded carrots and zucchini -- perhaps even some bell pepper slices, mushrooms (?) and sliced sausage -- and serve it either as a side dish or as a main meal, even. Smothered with cheese(s)? Sounds even better. JMTs

This is most like the kugle I grew up with, seemingly a family recipie as I recall it from Aunt Flo's. We had halved marischino cherries distributed throughout as well as raisens. It was never topped with anything..served with brisket or chicken and as dessert drowned in heavy cream.

This was my first attempt to make noodle pudding and it came out really well. My husband, who has been talking about his grandma's noodle pudding forever, was very happy with it. The only thing I will change next time is probably increasing the sugar.

Came out really good. I had some leftover sweet korean noodles from dinner the previous night; they had their own light sweet flavour and with the cheese come of the recipe it came out really good! You can use this recipe as a base for anykind of sweet cheese noodle dish you desire to make.

I was disappointed.   The cottage cheese stayed in lumps, the filling was sweet in between the noodles.  It wasn't a dessert, and it wasn't a side dish.  Thankfully, we halved it, and we still had a lot to throw out.

I expected to love this. Never having had noodle pudding before, I wanted to give it a shot. After all, it had everything I love. It looked like the ingredients for a kick-butt cheesecake, plus pasta - SWEET!! I adore all the components, but amazingly, I was completely underwhelmed with the finished product. I whirred the cottage cheese in the food processor to ensure a smooth finished product, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Nothing wrong with it per se, but it was just remarkably unexciting. Perhaps noodle pudding/kugel is an acquired taste...

This is perfect did not change a thing.  Took it to a covered dish and it was the only dish that was empty at the end.  I had been looking for something like my Grandmother's and this is it.

Ive been making this recipe for years since I first found it. It's a family favorite for sure. My now grown children also make it. I always add  maraschino cherries and raisins to mine. I tend to make extra Graham Cracker topping, everyone loves that. Ive even mixed some into the noodle mixture. 

Definitely the best I've ever made or had.

Absolutely delicious! I did make minor alterations. Very minor. I added 1 tsp of kosher salt. 1 tsp of lemon juice and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. Just those minor additions really made the flavor pop. It came out absolutely incredibly firm and congealed at the recommended baking time and I didn’t change anything else. I think it’s really important to note that mixing the cream cheese and cottage cheese very well before you add the rest is crucial. It really helps set the stage for the rest of it coming together. When adding the vanilla, that’s when I added my few additions (salt, cinnamon and lemon juice) and then gave it a good taste before adding the eggs last just to check the flavor and wow. So good. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe. It was loved by all.

If you love a sweet, dessert like noodle pudding, this recipe can not be beat.  I half it and it serves 6 or 7.

My family loved this recipe and the amount of kugel made allowed for leftovers. Needless to say it did not stay in the fridge for long. This will become a family favourite.

We did not know what to expect with this recipe, and unfortunately we were disappointed. I don't know what flavor we were expecting, but this sure wasn't it
