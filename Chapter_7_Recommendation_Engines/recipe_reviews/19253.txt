I just made these for the first time today! I cut the recipe in half, as I didn't need such a large batch. I found it difficult to get the dough rolled into logs as it is very wet and sticky, so I dropped the dough in teaspoons like normal cookies on the sheet and baked for 25 minutes. They came out perfect and got harder as they cooled! They tasted GREAT!!!!

I'm reviewing this but not photo-ing. My moonkid decided to take on a faceless recipe as I was doing my own. I saw her having difficulties with the recipe when she tried to follow the directions about rolling the batter out into logs the length of the pan. Can tell you it didn't work and became a mess for her. There is no directions stating needing to use flour. As I tried a little flour on the board and it absorbed right in. Using a piping bag was my only thought to make use of the log forms for baking on the cookie sheet. It worked out really well for her when I showed her what to do. BUT as they baked and I further read the directions and realized these should be more like biscotti cookies. So we followed through with the recipe. Flavor and texture were really good. I really loved the flavor. Both us decided that possibly if we took half the batch divided the batch onto 2 cookie sheets, it might work out better. And I agreed the cookies really should be made again because they taste darn good! However, there is a miss step in the recipe.

They turned out lovely, when the directions stating to roll the batter, the batter is thick and gooey and spreads. There was no way you could roll the batter, I used a piping bag to pipe it onto the cookie sheet, which worked out beautifully. however the cookies turned out small and inch and a half wide. Next time when I make these which will be a next time because the flavor and texture were wonderful but I will divide the batter in half and place half the batter on one cookie sheet to make wider cookies.

Here is a tip for biscotti.....the dough is very loose & your hands need to be wet to shape them into logs on a parchment papered cookie sheet...They will spread out but that is okay. When slicing...bear down on the knife, do not saw them.
