Great idea!   I had no bacon bits so I uses some frozen soy sausage that I chopped up instead; also added some cheddar cheese as well as the creole seasoning.

A nice change of pace from the usual sweet oatmeal. This reminds me of grits, just a different texture. I went easy on the seasoning (I used about 1/3 tsp) since I find it can be a little salty. I'll definitely be making this again!

This is great! I've never found additions to oatmeal until now that I loved.

Holy crow, this is so good even without the bacon bits!! Will definitely make this again with the bacon next time, and perhaps some shredded cheese as well for  a nice additional flavor boost.

It took a few bites to get used to this as I have never had savory oatmeal.  It was delicious once my taste buds adapted though.  What an excellent idea.  I just can't handle all that sugar in the mornings now that I'm old, but I do love oatmeal.
