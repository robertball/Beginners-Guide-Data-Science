I usually stay away from recipes that only have a few reviews. After looking at the ingredients I thought, why not. I went by the recipe but added 1/2 c. black beans and replaced the rice with quinoa.  OMGoodness it is amazing. The best part...my husband loved it. Thanks for sharing mireffey.

Made this pretty much per the recipe. This is a good blueprint for adjusting to taste or what is on hand. We did a chicken on our rotisserie and used part of that. We did add black beans, which was a really good addition. I sauteed red and yellow peppers with the corn and added the meat half-way through since it was fresh off the grill. I heated the beans with the salsa and mixed it all together and added on top of brown rice. Our only complaint was it was a little dry. That's easily fixable. I just had leftovers...added more beans and salsa and a little water. Sprinkled with cheese and re-heated...liked it better the 2nd time (more moist). This will be something we will keep in the rotation for a quick meal in a bowl. Thanks!!!

Bland and very tiny portions as written. I doubled everything except the red bell pepper. Also I added 1 Tb of my own blend of taco seasoning. With those alterations this wasn't bad and it was enough to give us two decent sized portions. I seriously do recommend doubling all ingredients and adding spices to your own taste.

Great recipe, wonderful one  bowl meal. I changed some things though, I marinated the chicken pieces in soy sauce vinegar and brown sugar for two hours. Added a small onion, and then followed the recipe.. turned out very good, chicken was moist and the flavor excellent . Spicy hot salsa and cheese really set it off for me. Will make again very soon.   thanks for the recipe

This recipe is pretty good.  I just made a couple of changes to make it more natural.  Instead of salsa, I made my own pico de gallo and instead of brown rice I am using quinoa.  Quinoa topped with chicken mixture, pico de gallo, avocado and cheese.  Very Yummy

This was a great and healthy recipe, I used frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. I cooked it with chicken seasoned with roasted bell pepper seasoning and salt/pepper, and threw the frozen corn in the pan to cook. And, it goes great with a scoop of sour cream! Great for left overs too.

Delicious and easy to make. We used Spanish rice and added avocado. Adding Pico di gallo to the chicken/corn/peppers was a great suggestion. My husband loved it too!!

Really easy recipe to make.  I used brown rice but think quinoa would be better.  I ditched the salsa and added some mango habanero marinade instead.  A little sour dab of sour cream was the perfect addition.

I used a mild white fish instead of chicken and it was delicious.   My husband asked if there were any more so he could have seconds but unfortunately I hadn't made a double batch.

Absolutely delicious!   I took the suggestion of others and added black beans and onions to the sauté of peppers and it was delish. Very tasty and I’ll definitely make it again and again.

I did make this dish and very good for lunch. However; I didn't use brown rice I replace it with Farro. 
Farro is a food composed of the grains of certain wheat species, sold dried, and prepared by cooking in water until soft. It like a rice but Farro and Kamut are types of wheat often referred to as “ancient grains,” and nutritionally, they outperform brown rice and whole-grain pasta.

I added the salsa in while cooking. I also mixed the rice in with it as my fiance prefers his rice that way. Had some leftovers so the next day for lunch, I wrapped some in a tortilla. Yummy

Almost a five star.  For us, our favorite ingredient was the cheese really.  It's a nice easy, quick dish and is something I'll make again.

I made as directed, but cooked the salsa in with the chicken and peppers instead of as a topping. I used quinoa and not brown rice. A really tasty, simple weeknight meal. Will use again!

In my original review, I did forget to mention that I use hot habanero salsa, and as another reviewer mentioned, top it off with sour cream.  And again, as another reviewer suggested, I cook the salsa in with the chicken and veggies, and let it simmer to infuse the flavors.  A simple and delicious recipe.  Perfect for when you need to get something on the table quickly.  Cooks in the time it takes to cook the rice.

Really delicious.  I added cilantro and onion.  Didn't have brown rice so I added cilantro to my white rice just to jazz it up a bit and because I love cilantro.  Made some black beans with............. cilantro!  Very good!

I gave it five stars after adding the extras others mentioned. I sauteed the onions and peppers a little first, then threw the chicken in to cook (I used raw breasts). I threw in parsley, adobo, a poblano pepper (we like heat and smokey flavor), and also added the black beans. I put it on top of rice with a dollop of Greek yogurt (didn't have sour cream), some salsa, and a little shredded cheese. Five starts for flavor and speed. Great weeknight recipe when you just don't feel like putting a lot of time in to dinner but feel guilty about not cooking.

I used the basic concept, but made my own changes to our likes/tastes.  Used some leftover Spanish rice from a previous meal, added black beans and a dollup of refried beans and sour cream to the bowl.  Spiced up the chicken with some of the typical seasonings I use when making Mexican food: garlic and onions powders, cumin, cayenne pepper, etc.  Served with a warm flour tortilla on the side.  Topped with cilantro. Fresh Mexican...nothing better!

I added a little taco seasoning to mine when cooking the chicken.  I added black beans and made Pico de Gallo instead of the salsa.  I doubled the recipe, too.  It was very good and I am ready to make it again!  I want this every week!

Super easy, fast, DELICIOUS recipe. I added a dash of garlic powder and cumin to the chicken for a bit more flavor. Used whole grain rice and Mexican four cheese blend instead of Monterey cheese. Yum,yum, yum. Definitely going in My Favorites as a go to dish. Next time I’ll add black beans and maybe some green peppers.

Recipe assumes that you have cooked chicken and brown rice. I had neither. Had to stir-fry chicken and cook rice. Total time 45 minutes. There was not enough food for two men.

After reading some reviews, did use creole seasoning, while cooking chicken. Used brown rice, trio of peppers, corn and added black beans. Tasted and seasoned as needed. Did add a little chicken broth, didn't want it to dry. Came out amazing!!

I gave it only 4 stars, because it's a great "base" recipe.  I add black beans, corn, onions, and have put this on as a regular in our household.  We use our own home-made salsa too.  It's quick, easy, inexpensive.

I sautéed the chicken in olive oil after tossing it with smoked paprika, cumin, garlic, and seasoning salt. We sprinkled chopped tomatoes and avocado on top after putting warm ingredients together. So fresh tasting! Adults and kids enjoyed it.

This was a little plain until I added more salsa and subbed plain greek yogurt (in place of sour cream.)  Good, but not great.

I thought this was pretty good, but seemed a little bland.  I did double the recipe because it didn't nearly seem like enough for 3 people.  The only thing I changed was I added some yellow pepper slices in with the red and added about a cup of black beans.

Usually I do make the recipe as is the first time, but had a couple of ideas to change it up. 
I did add a can of rinsed black beans and let the chicken marinade in a lemon vinaigrette dressing for a little while before adding to the other ingrediaents.  
Instead of just rice, I served it on a mixture of rice and quinoa.
Anyway, the whole dish was delicious and I'm glad I made the changes.
I would definitely make this again.

We had some leftover roast chicken so this was quick and easy to make. We added onion and cooked with the salsa for more flavor. This is a good basic recipe (kid friendly) that you can easily customize and spice up as you like!

Very bland on its own. I'm not a "purist" like some, I like a lot of spice and flavor. I added jalapeño, some dried red chili peppers, garlic, and seasoned the chicken with cumin, salt, pepper, and oregano. Dollop of sour cream on top, and I'll definitely make again!

I made this a second time with salmon and it was delightful! Used cotija cheese instead and the salsa I had had corn and black beans. Love this recipe because it's easy to mix it up with whatever you have in the fridge.

My husband and husband loved this dish.  I was worried that the chicken might be a little too bland so I added a tablespoon  of teriyaki sauce and a garlic clove.  I also doubled the  vegetables as I knew it would probably not be enough.  I also had a half a leftover tomato so I threw that in near the end. Don't forget that brown rice takes much longer to cook, a good 40 minutes.

This was quick, easy and yummy. Followed the recipe pretty well. I did chop up a chicken breast and sauté it with some homemade taco seasoning (just a light dusting)  and use that. I also added some pinto beans since I'm on a high protein diet. It's definitely a keeper.
