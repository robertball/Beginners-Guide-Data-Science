I have been making this same exact recipe for years. It is a 10-star recipe in my family's opinion. I always have to double this recipe. The recipe I've been using called for frozen/thawed hash browns, but since I don't like to wait for them to thaw, I use "Simply Potatoes" hash browns in a bag usually found in the dairy section of the grocery store. They're already thawed. And they have a "southwestern style" type, too. Love love love this recipe.

Super easy and great for picky eaters. We have been making this for years and everyone loves it. It goes quickly at potlucks, but also keeps well for leftovers (if there are any). My only suggestion, is layering the ingredients & adding about 1/4 cup of milk to the soup/sour cream mixture (which is otherwise VERY thick). I place a layer of hashbrowns first, then spoon a layer of the mixture on top, repeating layers. Seems to hold together better and cook more evenly. It can also be quite bland without adding some extra spices, so I usually add some garlic powder, onion powder and whatever else to taste into the soup/sour cream/milk mixture. And for cheese lovers- sprinkling a layer of cheese on top, over the crushed cornflakes is a nice addition. This is a great recipe to make ahead of time and bake when ready- very hearty comfort food.

@iLuvpastry...Boy are YOU on the wrong website.  I think most people can read and have figured out what the ingredients are.  The editorial you offered had nothing constructive in it so kindly control yourself....Idiot

My family loves these potatoes and we have a big pan of them for every holiday and family get together. I followed the recipe exactly and then for a twist, instead of the cornflake mixture  I used one roll of crushed Ritz mixed with one stick of melted butter. We love that version too. We are looking forward to this dish on Sunday for Easter dinner!

I've made this many times for my family or large groups. I do, however, substitute diced lightly sauteed sweet onion for the green onion. This is always loved by all for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  As a great twist for a breakfast version, try adding some precooked crumbled bacon!

This has been a family favorite for at least the last 20 years.  It is totally expected at Chrismas and Easter.  My main variation is that sometimes I make it with "O'Brien" potatoes instead of the plain hash browns.  But over the past few years I have had to vary the recipe for members of my family with either dietary limitations or simply are very limited to what they enjoy in their dishes.  To make it low-cal, I use fat-free cream of chicken soup , fat free sour cream, and low fat cheddar cheese.  I make the crushed crackers with smart balance instead of butter .   I think it tastes just as good as the "fully loaded" version.

I came across this  casserole, years ago, at a get together a friend threw at her house and my gosh IT'S DELICIOUS and ADDICTIVE! haha 
Easy recipe to make and it's going to be a total hit in your home! I've read recent reviews how double batches are always made... it's the same in our home. lol Happy Cooking ya'll! You won't be disappointed! P.S. a 16oz. container of sour cream is 2 cups. Don't stress yourself out by measuring it. lol

I didn't think it was anything special.  With this much fat and carbs, I need it to be 5 stars for taste, and this wasn't.

I sprinkled cooked bacon on top of half, and that half was better.  I read another recipe on here that included ranch dressing mix in the potatoes, I'll give that a try next time instead, or maybe make this again and swap the ranch mix for the salt.   Definitely needs the bacon though, either way.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years. Always take it to church functions, funeral lunches, etc., but I double it. I do change it up sometimes: cream of mushroom soup, don't use cornflakes, use fiesta cheese blend or Italian cheese blend as well as cheddar cheese.  I also put half a stick of butter in the mix and the other half drizzled over the top before topping with remaining shredded cheese.  This dish is always a favorite...true comfort food!

Tuned out good considering it's the first time I've made it.    I just added more cheese and 2 teaspoons of Lipton Onion Soup to the mixture.

Easy to make, friends and family loved it. Only change I make is I use Southern Style hash browns, they are cubed rather than shredded, the texture I think is better. 

Highly reccommend for big get togethers.

I did not put the corn flake topping on the casserole.  Otherwise, I followed the directions as written.  I did, however, put chopped green onions and bacon bits on top when I served it.  My husband loved it.  He is definitely a meat and potatoes man!  We will definitely be having this again.

I made this using two 20ounce packages of the southwest style simply potatoes in the refrigerated section. I followed the directions to a T.  At the end I wanted to brown them under the broiler for approximate 10 minutes which browned the top nicely. They were very rich and didn’t go over as well as I thought with my company. Needless to say I will not be making this again!

My co-worker made this but added crushed fresh bacon pieces so I did the same. I made it for my daughter's sleepover this morning and it was a hit!! I used Frosted Flakes instead of plain corn flakes and you could taste the slight sweetness of it but it wasn't bad at all and everyone enjoyed it.

These are  "Funeral Potatoes". That being said it is always at every family function of mine. I add a bit of seasoning salt and more cheese but other than that I keep it 100%.

Yes. I incorporated diced green peppers and onions & used an alfredo sauce instead of mushroom soup.

My mom makes this dish for every holiday and it’s always a hit. If you’re like me and are always looking for a way to cut through the fat of dairy products, I suggest using shredded pepperjack cheese and jalapeño peppers as an acid to balance out the flavors. It’s amazing both ways!

This is my new favorite!  I didnt gave green onions so I used dried chives and onions and oh my gosh was it delicious. I used to love Betty Crockers sour cream and chive potatoes and with my changes that is what it reminded me of. I will definately make this again and again.

Made it for dinner last night to accompany roast pork loin.  Was a big hit with my boyfriend.  Used some of the leftover casserole to make potato pancakes for breakfast.  Am forwarding the recipe to his sister.  Made it exactly as the recipe says.

I followed angelinamarie3’s review advice to a tee (seasoning with salt, sage, garlic powder, &  poultry seasoning to taste, adding milk, and layering the ingredients- I used a little more cream of chicken than the recipe called for). After 55 minutes of cooking, I added half a pound of cooked bacon pieces on the top and cooked the bake for 5 more minutes. Delicious!

Yummm!  Made it as indicated except didn’t have the corn flakes so I used crushed Ritz crackers with butter.  My husband really enjoyed it too and it lasted for three meals for us.  Will make again.

I love this recipe!  Both of my picky kids like it as well as friends and extended family.  I have made it many, many times and unfortunately there usually isn't much left for leftovers :)

Very easy to make as well.

Good.  My mother said it wasn't cheesy enough.  Perhaps because I only had 4 oz swiss cheese on hand.  Other than that I made as instructed.  It was  for a potluck and there weren't any leftovers so it had broad appeal.  Left off one star because I know this can't be good for me....

I've been making this Ore Ida Hash Brown Casserole for over 20 years. I'm always asked to make this for our large family Christmas Eve dinner and Easter dinner every  year. It turns out perfect every time.  I always triple or quadruple this recipe so that  I can freeze it in containers to have later for other meals.  This casserole freezes very well.

This was so delicious!!! We added mild and sharp cheddar. We also crushed flaming hot ruffles instead of cornflakes to a little corner to try it out and it was an amazing combo!!

Loved it!  But it took me at least 20 minutes to prep. Probably a little more. I don't think I'm super slow.  

I added some dried chopped onion - a dash or two. Yummy recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Even my 9yo daughter who is not a fan of casseroles loved it!  I used O'Brien style hash brown potatoes and minced onions because that's what I had on hand. I also had to make a cup of buttermilk to substitute for one cup of sour cream.  I also used Ritz crackers instead of corn flakes for the topping. This turned out REALLY good! Thanks for sharing:-)

I used this recipe as a base but made some significant changes. First, I shredded my own potatoes and added poached and shredded chicken breast for some protein (Poaching the chicken helps keep it very moist. If you use a hand mixer to shred it afterwards, it's fast and the perfect consistency). I also added cooked bell peppers and some broccoli pieces, and omitted the cornflake topping. Overall these changes were successful, but in the future, I'd cook the whole thing longer on a lower temperature (perhaps in a slow cooker) to allow the potatoes to get a little softer (my slices were a bit thicker than store-bought hashbrowns, I suspect). As for the original recipe, we did find the sour cream was a little overpowering. Next time I will cut that in half and try replacing with a different canned soup (cheddar cheese?), a cup of chicken gravy, or perhaps some chicken stock. I will also omit the extra salt. Overall my picky family liked this dish, and with some tweaks to the sauce, I think it will be a great base for building up weekday meals.

My family loves this recipe.  We make it for all our big gatherings. They like it cheesy so I use cheddar cheese soup and don't use the cornflakes. It is so easy. My sons have a friend who loves it and acts like i am a genius for making it. I'll never tell!

Very good and fairly easy recipe. The mixture was a little thick so I added about a half cup of milk. I added more cheese and onions and layered a little extra on top before the corn chips but slightly burried beneath the surface so it wouldn't burn but the top would still have a little something special to it. 
2 cups of Sour Cream seemed to make it a little thick so maybe I'll go a little light on it next time. 
My only complaint is that upon reflection, this didn't seem all that potato-y. I'll try it with cubed potatoes next time instead to see if that helps at all.

I made this for a breakfast potluck at work and everyone loved it!  I used yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked great and no one noticed the difference.  It was a little creamier than I would've liked but since everyone else loved it, who am I to complain?

I thought I would save cleaning an extra bowl, so put all ingredients right in the 9x13 pan and tried to mix up that way. Next time I wouldn't do that, really hard to get mixed and messy. My husband doesn't like corn flakes, so sprinkled parmesan cheese on top instead. YUM YUM!!
