This was really good! But I changed several things and I liked it allot so I'm going to list what I did for 2 reasons: So you can see what I did and I want to remember this when I go to make this again (I will make it again!)  Also for those of you with the thought that if you change a receipe up too much, you might as well post your own...well, I've tried that for yrs and have yet to have one of my submissions posted.  So, this is my outlet:
I used 12 oz. of lrg elbow mac and 4 oz. of a mix (which included Shells, Penne, and Spirals.) I liked the variation that some of the other shapes provided as they all hold the sauce a little differently. I wouldn't do the whole thing in a mix, but this way you ran up on another shape every other bite or so.
I didn't use spag sauce, but used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of petite diced tomates and seasoned it myself with basil, oragano, parsley, white pepper and a few red pepper flakes (maybe more garlic than called for). I let that simmer for about 1/2 an hour.  I also cooked the meat, onions, and garlic all together then added my tomatoe's, seasoning, and mushrooms. This made for a really tasty sauce, which I think is a big factor in the overall recipe.  After I completed the layering process, I topped it off with a little bit of grated - extra sharp - cheddar cheese.  The boldness of the cheese, but not overwhelmingly so added a nice finish to the pasta dish.
If you don't like cheese - this isn't the dish for you.

This recipe goes into my "comfort foods" list!  Makes a huge batch...the leftovers were almost better than the first time around!  I am going to try this recipe again soon and add some zucchini chunks to the sauce.  The sour cream layer adds a touch of sweetness...great recipe!

my mom makes a similar recipe except she adds chopped pepperoni to the ground beef and uses provolone or mozzarella in place of the jack cheese.  those changes add more flavor to the meat and less tang from the cheese--it is much better.

We thought this was pretty good.  I decided to make it easier on myself and just brown the ground beef, onions and mushrooms all together in a Dutch oven (which meant I could skip the oil).  I used 1 lb. ground beef and 8 oz. fresh, sliced mushrooms.  I also subbed a can of garlic and basil Ro-tel for the tomato sauce.  It took a little long to prepare but we thought it was a good, filling dinner.

Potential. I did as other suggested, and cut back on the sour cream and used mozz cheese. It tasted like a boring lasagna. I will make again, but next time  I will follow the recipe exactly. I may add more tomato sauce next go around.

My whole family loved this recipe.  Everyone had second helpings even my son who had already eaten.  It even made enough for a couple lunches the next day.  The only changes I made were to cook the onions with the ground beef and to use ridged elbow macaroni.  As my eight year old said, "This one's a keeper!"

OMG! A few modification because I didn't have the exact ingedients a viola...5 stars!  I didn't have any tomato sauce but I did have Mrs. T's Bloody Mary mix (slightly less than called for).  I also only had various cheeses to equal the amount necessary (pinconning, provalone, mild and sharp cheddar shredded and slices of Munster for the top layer. I also used a penne rigate pasta instead of elbow.  Holy smoke WOW!  I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.

This was really good. I did make a few changes. Instead of stewed tomatoes I added a can of diced italian style tomatoes and I left 1/4 of the juice for the flavor, this added to the sauce made it even better. And at the end I removed the foil to let the cheese get golden brown on top. VERY GOOD!

There are so many variation to this recipe.  I've tried them all!  I love them!  This is a pretty good one.  If you need something to feed a crowd, this is it!  I'd say it makes more like 12 servings, than 8.

This was pretty tasty. Because of the sour cream and the Monterey Jack cheese, it has quite a tang (but not too much) to it. I think next time I will use a more strongly flavored sauce, maybe roasted red pepper or something similar.

You can vary this recipes ingredients and still come out with a delicious casserole. Instead of all sour cream, I combine 1 cup sour cream with 4 oz. creamed cheese and only 1 lb of ground beef. Instead of the tomatoes and spagetti sauce I use two 8 oz. cans tomato sauce seasoned with garlic, salt and pepper. This is a great husband pleaser and the kids love it too!

overall this was pretty good! I left out the mushrooms (husband doesn't like mushrooms), and used tomato sauce with spices instead of a jar of premade sauce because I didn't have any on hand. 
The only criticism was that it was a little dry ... i probably would have added even a little more sauce to the mix. 
Still a great recipe though! definately a keeper

This has become my husband's favorite. Sometimes I make it the day before because we always think it's better the next day. Made two pans of it for a birthday party, and everyone loved it!

We just made this tonight.  It was so-so.  I read the reviews before making it and halved the recipe but I misunderstood the amount of pasta and cooked too much pasta.  Because of that, the dish turned out rather... dry and in need of more sauce.  My family does not eat mushrooms, so we left that part out.  We all ate it, but I don't think I will be trying this recipe again because it took a long time to prepare and didn't "knock our socks off."

This was okay, but the sour cream taste was a little over-powering.  Other than the strong sour cream taste it was pretty good, but I don't know if it would be too dry without it.  Also, after layering it all in the pan, I wished I had used a deeper one; it was a tight squeeze!  I had to squash it all down because it makes a lot!

I thought this was excellent but my husband wasn't fond of the mushrooms in it and my kids wouldn't try it. I liked it though and I will let you know that I added a dash of tabasco to it for some added spice. Good luck with it and perhaps your family won't be as picky as mine!

Very good meal.  I added italian seasoning to the meat and sauce mixture for added flavor.  Seems to make much more than 8 servings--the way we eat, we definitely got at least 12 servings out of this.  Will probably halve recipe next time.

Great recipe!  Definately a keeper.  I used rotini instead of elbows, and doubled the spaghetti sauce and nixed the tomatoes.  Kids loved it.

Tried this last night and it is yummy!  It took a bit longer to put together than I expected but the end results were worth it... my daughter likes it better than my lasagna, which was always her favorite.  I used Emeril's Kicked-Up Tomato sauce which added a nice punch... I had to add some salt to my serving but otherwise, very good.  I will make this again.

This is a great comfort food.  I used rotini instead of elbows and also per a previous suggestion added zucchini (due to a bumper crop this year zucchini goes in everything!)  I really enjoyed it, and my husband had 2 HUGE helpings!

I had some leftover homemade spicy spaghetti sauce that had ground beef, mushrooms, onion, celery & spinach,  and was looking for something different other than chili. I found this recipe and it turned out great! I added a layer of frozen corn in the middle to add some sweet to my spicy sauce. This will now be an excellent option instead of always making chili. Thank you!
