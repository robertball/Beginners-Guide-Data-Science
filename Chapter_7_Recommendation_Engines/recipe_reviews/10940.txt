I made these and MAN were they good. Yes please cook these for 8 to 10 min. I put cream cheese frosting on some of them and my family went wild. Basic recipe and so easy.

Thanks for posting this.  This is a cookie my grandmother made, back when we ate the dough before she could cook it!

If I hadn't been able to taste the shortening, these would have been 5 star.  They come together easily, bake quickly and are easy to frost or glaze.  So I would make them again but with real butter.  Thanks, Susan!

Love it each bit! We made these cookies today for Christmas and they where great! Everyone loved them. I went bold and added 1 cup of blueberries and I must admit, the flavor remains or it even becomes more noticeable. Really good recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!
