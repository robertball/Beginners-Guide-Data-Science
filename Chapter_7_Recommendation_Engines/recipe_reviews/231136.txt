We loved this side dish! There was a lot of flavor and would make a great side to a holiday meal. I did make these ahead and kept them warm in the oven like recommended. This will definitely be made again!

I agree with Bonnie about the MSG, you've got to be joking. Here in Australia they've banned it from use for health reasons. I make a similar peas, bacon and mushroom sides, but healthier without the cream and of course that rotten MSG. I did try this, but only the once and that was enough for me. I'll stick to my recipe, thanks.

I doubled the recipe for a potluck at work and everyone loved it.  I used canned mushrooms and yellow onion.  There was no oven available so I just heated it in the microwave right before serving.

As always I am looking for recipes that use up what I have. So I hesitate to give 5 stars since it's not the same recipe as written nor do I want to give it too few because if you are like me you look for how many folks like something  and this is great even w/o the cream...Today what's in the fridge is peas and fresh mushrooms and cooked bacon. However I already made some creamed corn off this site and did not want two creamed dishes in one meal. So I simply left out the MSG (allergic and morally adverse)and the heavy cream. Tastes wonderful. Thanks!

This was so good. Use seasoned salt instead of MSG though.

12/11/14  Really good!!  I added a little Tony's and garlic powder along with what they suggested.  Didn't use whipping cream, kept it a broth mix, but next time I would try milk.  Lot less fattening :)

Did this for Thanksgiving, doubled the recipe, used pearl onions and portobello mushrooms, otherwise followed the recipe. Well received by all, will make again.

Cream never thickened.  I had peas swimming in cream that made the crisp bacon all rubbery.  Ewww

I didn't use MSG or mushrooms and found it to be surprisingly bland. I won't be making this one again.

Followed the recipe to the letter, except used pearl onions.  Next time may add a little nutmeg to give it another dimension.
