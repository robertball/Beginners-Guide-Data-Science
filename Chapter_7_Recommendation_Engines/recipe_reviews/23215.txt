Awesome chili recipe - DH would eat this every night!  I make it in the slow cooker & it works just fine (I cook & drain the beef first, but that's it).  I've made this many times for groups, and it always disappears.  It's a great all-around not-too-spicy but not-too-bland chili.  If you want more heat, add some cayenne pepper or some diced pickled jalapenos.  Or just use hot salsa and hot taco sauce.  I've done several substitutions with this recipe and it's turned out well as well.  I've subbed several different kinds of beans, I've subbed a can of green chiles for the red pepper, and I've subbed tomato sauce for the spaghetti sauce.  All have turned out great.

This is a great chili recipe.  I had to add about 1 cup water to get the right consistency for my family.  Will be using this recipe many more times in the future. Absolutely fabulous.

This chili is the perfect level of spicy for most palates if you use medium salsa and medium taco sauce. Tobasco or other seasoning can be added to individual servings for those who like it even hotter.

Great recipe.  Made a few adjustments to suit my family's taste.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I only added 2 TBSP of chili powder rather than 3.  We had my father-in-law over for dinner and I wasn't sure how spicy he liked his food.  I thought it was the perfect amount.  Cooked in slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  Simple recipe that was delicious.  Perfect dinner for a snowy night.  Will definately make again.

this recipe is excellent, and almost exactly my recipe however I add a can of quebec maple beans and a slice of cooked crumbled bacon to the recipe.  I use chili powder and just a teaspoon of hot chili flakes.  More chili flakes can be added later if someone prefers their chili hot!  I leave it in the slow cooker all day on low.  It is even better the next day!

Very tasty chili!  All of my family and friends liked it.  I used a larger can of tomatoes (28 oz) and it was still very good.  Add or remove ingredients, as you like.  I'm sure that I will make this again!

Delicious recipe. I made a few changes using the ingredients I had on hand. I used the veggie meat crumbles from Morningstar Farms instead of ground beef which greatly reduces the cooking time (30 minutes). Instead of spaghetti sauce, I used a can of tomato sauce. This chili was outstanding! My husband is a die-hard carnivore and didn't notice the meat substitution. This is a keeper.

I've made this chili over and over. It's not a bad recipe. The first time I made this recipe it was to saucy for for taste. So I made some changes to make this Chili thick and hearty with flavor. So I took out  the tomato peels. I added more large can of kidneys beans, 1/4 pond more beef, peppers, mexican seasoning, and salsa. Trying different flavor of the taco sauce and salsa. I can't get enough of the last time I've made this chili. I added the Goya authentic salsa. And the ortega mild taco sauce. Which really takes away the italian spaghetti sauce flavor. It adds that authentic texan/mexican chili taste. When I tasted it after 6 hours of slow cooking crock pot. OMG!!!!!!!! It was perfect and balanced with flavor. It turned to be the best chili I've ever tasted in my life. It was so good that it tasted better than my parents chili. My father was impressed because he makes everything from scratch. My wife and my father tried to clean the pot out that night. It's a must add fritos scoops and and mild cheddar cheese with it.

We have a bbq cook off team & had a cook off this past weekend. We hadn't been placing in chili lately so I searched for a new recipe and decided to try this one since the reviews were so good. Out of 15 teams, we got 2nd place! I did do a few modifications, such as cut the bell peppers & beans. (I can't eat bell pepper & no beans in the competition chili.) Once everything had simmered for a while, I did find it was a tad sweet from all the tomato, but some cumin & cayenne took care of that. It still had a light sweet taste at first, but then the chili flavor came through. I doubled the recipe to have plenty to serve to our guests & everyone that tasted it raved about it! There wasn't a drop of it left. Thanks for a great recipe...and in helping us win a trophy!

I used this recipe for a chili cook-off and won as did the other fellow below. It's delicious but I did add a little cumin, a hot chili powder pack from McCormick to spice it up, eliminated the bell peppers, and added a secret ingredient. Honey! Yes, I added just enough honey to make it sweet at first and then a spice aftertaste. Be careful on add a little at a time or you could make it to sweet. Everybody raved about it and asked me for the recipe. This is a winner in my book!

This is a very good base recipe!  I added some chopped sweet yellow and red peppers and one more can of beans.  I also cooked this all in a crockpot...cooking the peppers and hamburger together in a pan before adding to the mix. Thank you very much!

By far the best chili I have ever tasted. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! The only thing I modified was -- bought diced tomatoes with olive oil and garlic, substituted the kidney beans with actual chili beans (mild), added 1 can of tomato soup to tone down the spiciness some & 1/2 soup can of water to give it a little more soupy consistency...YUM, YUM, YUM!

Such a yummy chili and loved by everyone. It's easy to make and still tastes great even if you don't have all the ingredients in your fridge or pantry. I like using the crock pot - I'll cook the meat, onions & peppers and then throw everything in the crock pot.

Quick and easy! My family loves this recipe. It's full of flavor yet not too spicy for myself and my son.  My husband on the other hand loves it hot so to please him I chop up a little bowl of jalapeno so he can add as he much as he likes to his bowl.   I pretty much follow the recipe. I do however start it in the morning and throw it in the crockpot and heat it on low all day.  The flavors and aroma are...YUM!

First time making chili this was a great starter recipe.  I did read reviews and let it cook in slower cooker for 5 hours after browning ground beef and onion. Used a can of Rotel instead of bell pepper.  YUM!!  Very simple and easy to make.  I will be making chili a lot more.

This recipe was super easy to make thats why I gave it the 4 star rating. As far as flavor it was pretty good not great but good. Instead of the spaghetti sauce I used tomatoe sauce. I'm thinking about adding corn next time. I also think this would be good as a dip.

Made this yesterday, with some modification, and was informed that it is a keeper. First mod. was I added 1/2 lb. of 'hot'Italian sausage (bulk, not link) to the ground beef. Next cut the chili powder down to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of Cumin, in place of the pasta sauce I used an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce. And instead of Kidney beans (we don't like them) i used 2 cans of Bush's Pinto Beans. I browned the beef and sausage together,then sauteed the onion and garlic together, put all the ingredients into the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 hours. Will definately be makeing this again.

This was quick and easy and pretty good. Would probably look for better recipes if I'm not in a hurry but this one's pretty handy to have for after work dinners.

Pretty Good, especially if you love sals.   I got one vote for the chili cookoff, not bad.  I added more kidney beans and black beans as well.

I picked this recipe at first because it was so easy, I had to make chili for a chili dump we are having and I thought it was to easy to taste that spectactular, but it would be mixed with others anyway.  After letting it simmer for an hour or so I had to try it and I was blown away, it was declicious.  For such a simple chili recipe it was so good.  I was disappointed that I had to give it away so I will be making it again.  I did use chili ready diced tomatoes and spaghetti sauce seasoned with garlic and peppers, which might have added some spice, but it can be tweeked to individual tastes.  Thanks for an EASY and DELICIOUS recipe!!!!

I sauteed the onion, red pepper and garlic in a bit of canola oil separately and added 1/3 lb hot pork sausage to the hamburger. Also added an extra half can of pinto beans, a cup of frozen corn.

This is not the best chili I ever tasted, for sure, but not bad.  It would definitely been to spicy for us had I added all of the chili powder, maybe because I also used medium heat salsa and taco sauce.  I think to me the spaghetti sauce gave it a weird flavor.  I won't be using this recipe again, there's others I like much better.

I assume this chili was wonderful because when I came home from work in the evening, the whole crockpot of chili was GONE. My family raved about it. I just haven't been able to get the right chili recipe lately when I make it but this one is "it". The only changes I made because it was what I had on hand was to use "mexican chili beans" instead of red kidney beans and "chili ready diced tomatoes". I also used black bean salsa and since the beans and tomatoes were already seasoned I cut back on the chili seasoning to 2 Tbsp. Thanks for a great recipe, next time I'm making it when I don't have to work so I can have some!

It was quite good, but I found it to be a little bit too acidic for my liking.  The salsa added a little bit too much of a tomato flavor.  My guests agreed that it was a little bit too much.  It was definatly edible, but I won't be making this again.

I tried this recipe for an office party & it was big hit!!! I was a little concerned the night before because it seemed bland and the spaghetti sauce flavor was very strong, but once it sat in the fridge & was re-heated, the flavors had mixed really well and the spiciness was just right. I'll definitely use it again.

Really good!  I made 4 batches to give to family.  Then I modified the recipe because we are vegetarian.  We used veggie crumbles instead of beef, very delicious!  Yummmy!

Very good - even better warmed up the next day.
I cut the chili powder to 2 Tblsp and I was glad I did but some may like it hotter and I only simmered for 45 minutes.

My new favorite chili recipe!  I have made this a half dozen times now and love it.  My only change is throwing it all in the crock pot after browning the ground beef and cooking it for 4-8 hours depending on my schedule.  I even brought it to work for a chili-off and won by a landslide. Thank you for sharing!!

This chili was okay, but not memorable. I followed all the recipe directions.  Took this to a chili cook off at work.  It did tie for 3rd place out of 6.  Don't know that I would make it again.

THE BEST DARN CHILI EVER! It didn't let it heat through, next time I will cook it longer. Amazing Flavor! I used less chili powder for my kids sake, but will add more next time. Also, my kids loved it, and they don't eat chili. I will make a double batch this weekend for company.

Spicy & Tasty!  What's so great about this is you can tailor it to your own tastes as to how hot you want it.  To make it mild, use mild salsa & taco sauce.  Or use mild or hot chili powder, whichever you want.  I used mild salsa, mild taco sauce and 2 T Chili powder, part hot & part mild.  Also you can serve this over spaghetti.  Thanks, Susie

Great recipe!! Used green bell pepper, because that's what I had. Still turned out great.

This is an easy recipe for great chili.  I put all the ingredients in a crockpot and just let it cook for 5 hours and my family loved it!  I didn't think it was too hot or spicy, but was actually missing that extra kick.  I'd make it again!

This was a good chili recipe. I liked it. My 2 year old liked it. My husband asked me to add more spice next time. He likes his chili way spicy. Other than that he thought it was good also.

Easy and tasty!  I used black beans instead of the kidney beans.  Had neighbors over for chili night, and this got raves!

I tried this recipe and it was a big success. The second time I threw in some xtra heat using jalapeños and hot rotel tomatoes. Dont think the bay leaf was necessary so I havent used any.

awesome...I added two cans of brown beans, can of mushrooms and used extra spicy salsa as I didn't have taco seasoning...and used the chili "accents" diced tomatoes.  Easy, quick and enjoyed by the whole family.

Excellent!I left out the taco sauce and red pepper.Added more onions and chili powder.Substituted pintos for kidney beans.Served the beans on the side,as since my wife had her gall bladder removed,she avoids beans,cause she now has gas of the gods.She doesn't need the extra power.

My husband and I love this chili.  I have made it twice and it is so good.  I am pregnant with my second child and I am craving spicy food like crazy.  This really does the trick.  The only thing I do differently is to add a can of chili beans as well as the kidney beans, because we prefer a lot of beans in our chili...yum yum!

Really was not impressed with this recipe I was expecting a lot more from it, it didn't taste that different from my old recipe and the spaghetti sauce was a huge turn off in this one.  I ended up adding half a jar of salsa con queso and serving it over chips and hot dogs.....THAT was delicious!!  But the recipe by itself wasn't that great.

This recipe worked great.  I made a few changes.  I used a cubed venison roast and cooked it in a slow cooker for a few hours. I also modified the spices to match my tastes.

An extremely good recipe for its simplicity. It sort of cheats by using a number of things that already have complex flavors to them. I added a bit of cayenne pepper to increase the spice, added a smallish can of cut yellow corn, and mixed white beans and kidney beans instead of only kidney beans.

Incidentally, I also added 2 tsp. garam masala. Really good. Next time will add more red pepper.

Ok, so I'm not a hardcore chili lover, but chili is GREAT! My husband volunteered us to bring chili to a meal with friends.  I groaned, "oh no", when he told me.  That's the one thing I really have a hard time making!  So I immediately searched for a recipe and found this one cause the reviews were good and it seemed fairly simple!  What a great surprise!  This chili is really great and it was a big hit!  Only thing different is I used less chili powder and I would even use less next time.

Great chili! The spaghetti sauce makes a great family chili. We’ve had this several times, and it’s always good. This time I didn’t have taco seasoning, so I used Ranch style beans instead of plain kidney beans.

This is my go-to recipe when it comes to Texas chili.  I do kick it up a notch though.  Things I add: fresh green chile (blessed to live 30 minutes from Hatch, NM), I use canned whole tomatoes in lou of the spag. sauce, a bit of dark chocolate, and a can of guinness.  I have never had anyone disappointed in my chili!  Note... cornbread is a delicious addition as a side :)

Having won several chili cook offs, I know good chili. This is good chili.  However, most chili needs to be tweaked for individual tastes. I added 1 tsp. Adobo (dry seasoning), 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 Tbsp brown sugar, and salt to taste. It was perfect.

I made the recipe as written. I just doubled the ingredients for a bigger batch. This was not a very good recipe for me personally. I like a more juicy kind of dinner chili like Wendy's chili used to be before they apparently changed the recipe. This recipe is more of a taco sauce type thickness. Really different. But kids liked it okay. But I probably won't make it again.

I made this in the crock pot and added chipolata diced tomatoes and green chili tomatoes instead of plain.  My family loved this and did not notice I didn't make it from scratch like I generally do!
