My friend and I made these for a dinner party and everyone raved. Even the skeptics were won over. Delicious! We did substitute actual creme fraiche for the whipping cream. I need to get back in my kitchen and make these for everyone I know!

Absolutely awesome Recipe - so unique and fun for the holidays! I made these during Halloween & Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it.  I used olive oil intead of canola ...and to make it healthier I used fat free greek yogurt instead of both sour cream and whipping cream.

Wasn't quite sure because I'm not the biggest pumpkin fan, but these were DELISH! I also used real Creme Fraiche because it was local, as well as some rasberry balsamic that I bought at the farmers market.  These were SO good.  Will be making quite a bit over the holiday season!

Very easy to do and tasted great.  I actually bought a cooking pumpkin and cooked it in oven until soft and then smashed it up.  Didn't have sour cream so didn't make the dip but thought they tasted great without it.  I also added a dash of red crushed peppers for some spice.

I am one of those people who make a recipe once, then make it completely different the next time so it's better. This recipe, however, needs NOTHING. I made them for Mother's Day brunch and they were DELICIOUS!

Very tasty.  I was expecting more pumpkin flavor, and these reminded me more of stuffing, so maybe I'll cut down the bread crumbs and add a bit more pumpkin next time and hope it keeps its shape/texture.

These were a creative substitution for stuffing.  They didn't taste at all like pumpkin but they were easy to make & tasted very good.  These balls are very small so if you want to double the recipe, I suggest not making more creme fraiche to go with it.  The dip was ample for at least 2 batches.

Mmm. GOOD. I mean, eyes rolling back in the head good. Even the 10 year old loved it. Can't wait to make it again!

These are fantastic, my kids can't stop raving about them. You can certainly make everything a few days in advance and just reheat. We are calling them foxy cleopatras, as it sounds a bit more appetizing and exciting.

These were so easy to make!  The dipping sauce had a wonderful flavor.  I didn't change a thing.

These were really good. Reminded me of Thanksgiving, probably because of the sage.  I loved the dipping sauce!

These were great!  I was very curious as to what they would taste like and the best way to describe them is stuffing!  American comfort food at its best!  I used a very expensive and gourmet balsamic vinegar and i thought the sauce was pretty good, but not out of this world.  I thought it kind of took away flavor from the pumpkin ball.  HALVE the sauce, it makes too much!! These are great appetizers, I will keep this recipe!!
