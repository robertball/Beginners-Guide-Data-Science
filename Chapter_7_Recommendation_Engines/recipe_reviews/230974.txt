My oldest boy likes to make this for dinner once a month when Mom's working late. I taught him to add more spices to the cracker mixture (onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, italian seasoning mix) but other than that he sticks to the recipe. This also works with adding dry ranch dressing mix to the cracker mixture and dipping the chicken in either melted butter or egg wash. Automatic kid pleaser.

It's the mark of a good recipe, when it's gone in seconds. I have teen boys . . . . need I say more? Easy & a great snack.

Loved this recipe, but made some slight improvements based on what was at hand, and it also made it a little healthier. Instead of cheese crackers, I used bread crumbs (the ingredient I had on hand), and used thin sliced chicken breast, was really quite tasty. Everyone loved it.

Tastes surprisingly good!  I made it because it cooks so quickly.  When I turn on the oven, I like to cook several things. This fit well into the time frame.
