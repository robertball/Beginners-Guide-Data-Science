I've got to tell you, that this is the worst recipe for an apple crisp that I've ever tried. I agree with one of the other reviewers, that this recipe should not have made it to the "All Recipes Tried & True Favorites. I've learned the hard way, that one should check the reviews.  But I thought that since this recipe was in All Recipes "top 300 recipes" that I was safe and didn't need to check the reviews...boy was I wrong. I knew there was a problem when the recipe said the topping was supposed to "spread evenly over the apples", because what I had was a congealed ball of dough, that I had to rip into little bits and drop on the apples.  And when it baked, they turned into little rocks.  My Husband, being the sweet man he is, didn't complain, but he had to drown it in milk, to make it edible.  I now know, to always and I mean always check the reviews before trying a recipe!

The apple crisp was very good. I did not notice any of the previous complaints; I cooked it for the 30minutes and although the crust was "golden brown" it was a light brown and I could see the apples bubbling so I considered it done. The crust was soft , not hard like others complained, maybe they cooked it a little too long? If you eat the crust by itself I guess I can see why it was called "bland" but if you eat it like your supposed to with an apple it is delishous! I still like the traditional oat apple crisp better but this one is a very tasty desert. It is a little sweet, but apple crisp is supposed to be! Plus I used Gala apples.

I can usually salvage almost any recipe, but there was no saving this one.  The topping was a cakey, insipid mess.  Not crunchy and not "too sweet".  I did use granny smiths and maybe they were too tart.  But just the consistency of the topping makes this a "no-go" for future attempts at this recipe.

I hate giving bad reviews but I thought this sounded and looked good, however i ended up with flavorless, mushy apples with a rock hard blanket of dough on top, I'll stick with apple crisp III

I made this Sunday for my family.  The topping was so hard once it cooled that we could not eat it.  Unfortunately, I will never cook this again.

This was WAY too sweet and the topping wasn't to die for either.  I would halve the brown sugar and use another topping, but if you're going to do that, you might as well look for another recipe.  Won't be making again.

Thanks for the great recipe Olga!  This crisp was very tasty.  I used macintosh apples and added a bit of water to the apples as I like it saucy.  The crumb topping was the best I ever had - I was a bit leary on the egg use in the topping but it turned out wonderful.  I scaled the recipe for 12 servings and probably added more apples as I did not measure the apples.  Enjoyed by all at my dinner party and even though everyone was stuffed from supper they could not resist cleaning their plates of this apple crisp with icecream on top!  Definitely will make over and over.

This is an easy EXCELLENT recipe.  The complaint about the crust is an understandable one however.  I found that if I used a fork to stir and fluff it, then crumbled it over, the end result was a sparkly crunchy topping that was delicious!  When you mix it like dough, it comes out like a bland cookie topping that wasn't very appetizing.  So now you know!  Just keep the topping crumbly and it is an amazing crowd pleaser that I make every fall :)

I had a bunch of apples and wanted to make apple crisp, but I had no oats, so a google-search later I found this recipe. 

Basically, it was really good. Really easy to make and satisfied my desire for some apple-y goodness.  I was worried because I read the reviews while it was in the oven, but if it turned out as bad as some of you say, you obviously did something wrong. I followed it step for step and it turned out fabulous. As good as something with oats? No. But you get what you make.

If your topping wasn't easy to spread or was kind of like a batter, you did it wrong.  There was very little amount of liquid in ratio to the dry ingredients of the topping.  What you got was more a moistened, crumbly thing of flour and sugar, rather than anything like others describe.Thanks a lot, Olga, I'll be keeping this recipe in mind!

This is a great apple crisp.  To the people that said the topping was hot, you put too much liquid in it.  I made it once and had that problem.  Best to use a large egg, not jumbo.  Also, for those that said it was too sweet, just like in an apple pie, you have to use a tart apple to start.  I used honey crisp or granny smith, or a combination, comes out nice and tart.    When mixing the topping, it should be very dry and crumbly.  It then cooks down to a nice, crunchy topping.  Try adding a bit more cinnamon if you think it doesn't taste good, and don't forget the salt.

Wow! About half way through i read the reviews and got scared, but i have to say this was absolutely delicious. The topping was just crunchy enough and the filling was warm and gooey. My family can't wait for me to make this again! Thanks Olga!

At valley forge we struggled for days to keep our muskets clean, our boots dry, and our bellies contented. WIth our tar heel baked by the one armed devil we called The Liberty Chief our moral and stupor of the men was as low as the virtues of a confederate . The men were threatening to turn in their cotton blues and march back to the comforts of their Boston mansions.   I was depressed at my efforts to keep the men in line and fight for the preservation of the union under the almighty GOD. As all was seeming lost as the heavens assaulted us with the fury of her torrential angst, the leader of our beloved union came to me in a dream with a plan to defeat the confederate dogs.  The war would not have been successed with out the ailment and power from GOD through the everlasting support of our beloved apple crisp.   This recipe wasn't that good. But not bad. Just okay.  My fellow brethren in the pursuit of liberty and justice and apple crisp. I salute you for your unheeding call to the preservation of the Great Union that we have been born into service to defend. GOD SPEED GENTLEMEN.

Dee-licious!  

I couldn't find my normal recipe for Apple Crisp so I decided to try this one. I am glad I did!

SO EASY and SO YUM!

My stepson even begged to take some home when heading back to his mom's place.

I thought the topping was excellent and it was NOT dry or hard as others have suggested.

I thought it was even better reheated the next day.

I have a trillion apples off my neighbors tree and plan on making this one again tonight!

Oh, P.S....REDUCE bake time!  Start checking at 25-30 min!

Ick! One Star is too many.I didn't even get to the baking part! The topping was gooey and unspreadable. The directions call for you to STIR in the egg and melted butter whereas the description says it's poured over the top... Either way, forget it! Stick with the Maple Crisp recipe (which I made after throwing away the goo from this recipe)- awesome!

Well, I thought this recipe turned out great!  Not to sure why others had trouble, but this recipe is very delicious - turned out just like the picture. The crust (even once cooled) was nice and crumbly, easy to eat and blended wonderfully with the sweet apple filling.  I will probably mix the flour with quick cooking oats for the topping the next time, only because I like oats.  Follow the directions and you will end up with a delicious apple crisp.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Not nearly as bad as other reviewers say...I didn't read the reviews before I started this and when I came back to this page and started reading some of the negative reviews after it was already in the oven, I was a little nervous.  So I covered it in foil for about 20 minutes of its cooking time so that it wouldnt become dry, then removed the foil a few minutes before taking it out and turned the broiler on to crisp just the very top.  Turned out just fine.

Also to note, I used a loaf pan instead of a square pan because I like a more even helping of apples and topping (obviously did not have to use all of the topping...more like 2/3 of it).  Additionally, I used half white flour and half wheat flour and honestly could barely tell a difference in the taste.  I also used an apple corer/slicer, then cut the slices in thirds.  Made it more manageable to eat and I felt like it allowed the apples to spread more evenly.

This was good, but I made a few adjustments to my apple crisp. I didn't melt the butter for the topping. I used room temp butter and added a bit more than what was called for. I also used less white sugar (-1/4 cup) and doubled the salt. Very good. :)

Perfect recipe. All of these bad reviews of how it came out horrible, it must be the people cooking it. I did exactly as the recipe said, and I have never had a better apple dessert. I made this at 2:45 in the morning. Easy as pie. Delicious. My fiance is an incredibly picky eater, and he ate the entire pan. c: Fantastic recipe, will make again. Perfect for Holidays, too.

I read a lot of reviews who said this recipe is too dry. I myself rarely ever follow recipes to a tee. I usually read them before cooking or baking for guidelines and do what I feel works best. Its just the way I work. Anyway, after taking a look at the apple crisp 3/4 through the cooking time, I noticed it did in fact look a little dry, so all I did was open up a little apple juice box and poured about half through the cracks. It worked wonders! I'm going to be doing this from now on! The apple juice thickened up and almost caramelized the apples, plus, it tastes better then if I would've added water.

The apples came out too sweet, and the topping was hard and pasty.  It's true this recipe is easy, but you can tell when you taste it.

I thought this was great!  I can't have sugar so I used a sugar replacement and whole wheat flour.  It was a huge hit!

I'm not a big fan of outmeal apple crisp. this is crunchy and good. Added a bit more brown sugar and used fresh apples. I'm so glad I didn't read the reviews before trying this one. Good job!

This was wonderful! I used a mixture of apples, and found the spices and sweetness perfectly balanced. I had no problem with the crust. My crust was crunchy and delicious, though not as crunchy as an oat and nut crust would be. With neither on hand and a craving for crisp, this was a fantastic alternative.

Delicious!  I used 4 of the biggest apples I had ever seen, so I made 1.5 times the flour mixture.  My flour mixture was still dry after baking, but the apples and brown sugar made such a wonderful syrup when baking, that I tossed it all together after so that the flour mixture would soak up all that good syrup.  It was DEVINE.

Why was egg added to this recipe? I have never seen egg added to this recipie. It could be the reason why the topping came out hard for those who used it. Just making a suggestion.

I cut the recipe down to 4 and followed the recipe exactly.  However... it did not turn out well at all.  The topic was clumpy (not crumbly) and because I couldn't spread it evenly it became hard and lacking in flavor.  When I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes, the apples were hard, so stirred up the apples and topping(which I tried to break up) and put a little more brown sugar on and baked for 10 more minutes.  The apples were delicious, but I think I will stick to my oatmeal version.

The topping did not get crisp and the flavor just wasn't there, very bland. I can't believe this made it into the Allrecipes Tried and True cookbook.

I would add a little lemon juice to aples and brown sugar if not using really tart apples. I will also try adding a little cornstarch to the same part of the recipe, as the apples were watery.

I'm a Grandma & have made several apple crisps over the years.  I loved this & will make it over & over.  It is different than a regular apple crisp, so maybe that why many complained about it.  It is more like some of the pies with crumb topping.  I like it better than the pie recipes as it is less fattening.  Really really good.  I'm making it for my daughters & grandkids for Sun.  Yum!!!

Edible, but definitely NOT the best apple crisp ever. Tasted mostly like sugar, even though I used tart apples. The topping did not look anything like the photos. In my opinion the recipe calls for way too much sugar in the topping and not enough cinnamon as I thought it was bland and the topping too sweet. I should have know when I noticed that almost every other apple crisp recipe I've seen adds cinnamon in with the apples, and not just in the topping. Like I said, it was edible with a scoop of ice cream on top, but I am disappointed as I was having a hardcore preggo craving for apple crisp and this left me wishing I would have tried a different recipe. I guess I should have read the reviews first.

This apple crisp is delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste. I think you could easily cut the sugar in half and it would still taste good.

I made this and then read the reviews. I do agree that its a bit sweet (i would cut down on the sugar) but i found that spraying the pan with a non stick cooking spray before putting the apples in, fixed the issue of having the pastry stick too much. Oerall, simple and tasty!

I used this recipe for the first time ever making apple crisp and i have to say that it turned out great! I made it for my boyfriend and he has me make it for him all the time. It was a little confusing when it said to spread the mixture over the apples because, the other reviews are right it doesnt spread very well, but if you have a bit of patience and evenly coat the apples with the mixture it turns out wonderful!

I loved this recipe, but I added another apple to create a deeper dish and mixed cinnamon within the brown sugar to bring out the sweet apple flavor a little bit more.  At the end of spreading the flour mixture, I sprinkled a white and brown sugar mixture on top.  Great recipe though!

This was just OK.  I wish I had added more spices, like maybe some nutmeg or cloves.  The topping wasn't as good as oat based toppings I've had on other crisps.

The bottom was really watery and the apples didn't seem to cook long enough.  If I had cooked it longer, the top would have burnt.  Next time I'll try another recipe for sure.

Absolutely delicious! I used granny smiths and let them sit in the brown sugar for a few minutes and then sprinkled some nutmeg over the top and stirred.  The top did get hard after cooling off.  I served it upside down and topped with whipped cream.

This recipe is great but one thing to note...i believe it could use some butter to coat the pan on the bottom.  Mine became stuck somewhat at the ends, otherwise delicious!

Although not an "apple crisp" we took the apples out and added cinnamon chips. It turned into a cookie cake.

this was one odd recipe for Apple crisp. The topping was the consistency of cookie dough, I sort of crumbled/spread it over the apples and skeptically put it in the oven. It took a long time to bake because I was waiting for it to brown, which it never did.
When I took it out, I served it to my husband - he ate it without comment, which is unusual, and then as he put the plate down, said, "that was good".  He is a polite, appreciative man, and usually raves over Apple crisp when I make my usual recipes with oatmeal. This did not evoke any more than a polite comment. My teenage son of course liked it and gave it a "4" but he has a strong sweet tooth which accounts for the extra star.
I will not make it again.  It was certainly not inedible, but it was bland and lacked the buttery crunchy crispness of other recipes I've enjoyed.

Made this today and it looks exactly like the picture. Will have husband give it the official taste test tonight and let everyone know what he thinks... We loved it! Made it from apples from a tree in our yard, so we don't know what variety they are, but we both thought it was very good.

It's not a good recipe.  Cut flour to 1/2 cup. I always use more nutmeg than cinnamon because it makes my recipes stand out from all the cinnamon that usually takes center stage in desserts. 1 cup instant rolled oats. Butter should be 3 tbsp. You need to cover it with foil to steam cook it and then remove towards end to brown. 
I'm adding cranberries into my apple and brown sugar mix.

Watch the video! Make sure you mix the dry ingredients; mix the butter & egg and then hand mix the egg/butter into to mix.  Form crumbles by hand; makes a GREAT crisp.  The only thing I change is use half white half brown sugar in the topping and add some vanilla. YUM!

This topping was flavorless, dry, overly sweet and lacking in the typical oats and caramel flavor associated with Apple Crisp.

I'm afraid I must agree with some of the other reviews.  I ended up with a petrified crust on top of mushy apples.  Thank goodness I tried this out in advance ... I had planned to serve it to guests.  Luckily, we have an abundance of apples from our trees this year so I can try a different recipe.

Read a lot of the reviews AFTER I made this--just to get a sense of the direction the reviews took. It seems like the sweetness is an issue with many; also 'dry', 'crumbly' & so forth. 
So I will just say what I did for a DOUBLE RECIPE a) coat the rectangular glass pan thoroughly with coconut spray, b) substitute coconut sugar for brown sugar, and use organic granulated for 'white' sugar--these are both less 'sweet', c) half AP flour/half freshly milled hard red wheat flour--this gives it an interesting depth of flavor, d) add a T of ginger powder to the flour mix, also for complexity of flavor.
The mixing of the butter/egg/flour combination accomplished more by scattering the 'liquid' over the 'solid' and folding it until evenly clumpy, if that makes sense--this allows some small lumps to form, but overall the effect is of 'moisturized', not in any way doughy or wet. 
Bake for ~35 minutes, then turn off oven and leave for another 10 minutes or so. Very crispy.
Hubby LOVED it; raved for about a half an hour & upset that I gave some away to my mom & brother to take home ;-)
I believe if I make this again, I will put more apples: this had about 10 small ones from our neighborhood trees.

This apple crisp was fanta-bulous!i got a little nervous when I saw alll the bad reviews, but it worked wonderfully for me. i don't know if they cooked it for too long, or what...I did substitute the flour for oats, because I like the oatmeal flavor in it. the topping went very well with the apples. I only cooked it for 25 minutes, and it turned out perfect. This is my new favorite recipe! Thank you so much for posting this!

I used Macintosh apples because they are juicier and I like a little nutmeg in mine. A little oats in the topping makes it crisper and a couple pats of butter on the apples. Slice the apples thin if you like it moist.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly.  (The only thing I did differently was blend the egg and butter separately into the dry mix, since I was afraid of scrambling the egg.)  It turned out great!  And so easy!

I never write a bad review as I have never had a failure in the recipes at AllRecipes.com but I feel compelled to warn others to avoid this recipe. How it can be labelled the best apple crisp ever is a mystery. No one liked it. I agree with the comments by the other reviewers that had a failure.

Pretty good, I havent had apple crisp in a few years so Im not sure if this is what it is supposed to taste like. I added half of a banana, a little bit of vanilla, and fruits and nuts granola cereal on the top. I thought it was too sweet so I would recommend putting in less sugar.

Although I prefer the oat apple crisp, this version of the recipe was not bad. Instead of 1/2 a cup of brown sugar I would recommend a full 1 cup instead. Also add 1/2 a teaspoon more cinnamon in the topping and it should be fine :)

I love this recipe!!! However, I did double the cinnamon, and added some nutmeg.  I used fugi apples, and it helps to coat them with some flour before adding the brown sugar to avoid it being watery. And I only baked it for 30 minutes. I saw that alot of people are getting mush for thier toppings.  You need to add the egg miture a little bit at a time and lightly toss it with a fork so it forms small clumps.

I made for my husband tonight. I wish that I didn't. For a Apple Crisp this one is not good. My husband said that it had no flavor at all. The topping reminds him of Grape Nut ceral with no sugar. We bland, no flavor. He asked to to never make this one again. This tells me something is wrong., Because he LOVES APPLES and Cinnamon.

Sorry, I really didn't like this one.  The topping was to hard and didn't taste great.  For the calories, I need more flavor!

Fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about. My husband raved about it. Definitely will be making this again and again.

The taste was good but it was very chewy.  I think adding the egg is what did it.

I disagree with the bad reviews. Recently I found out I was allergic to oats and can no longer eat them.  This is the best oat free apple crisp.  Even my picky hubby liked it.  Nice and crispy - very good.

While this dish was really good, the crust on top needs a bit xtra sugar and cinnamon. My husband loved it, as did I.

I'm 15 years old, and love baking. But i must say that this is the worst thing i have ever made. Like the other reviews, my topping was so hard that it took forever to spread on top. It didn't have that good of a taste either. My "Best apple crisp ever" turned out way too mushy on the bottom and way too hard on top.

I made this and then realized the terrible reviews... however, it turned out pretty good. As someone else mentioned, I think I may halve the brown sugar next time, but it was delicious! Add some ice cream to it - mmmm!

This did not work out. Most of my stuff turns out  but I think my kids summed this one up best.  "Too sweet, too sticky and too hard to scrape the uneaten remainder off of the plates and pan without an hour's soak in hot water."

This recipe was really easy. Mine turned out great. The topping is a little tricky because you have to spread it over the apples. I altered the recipe to yield 3 and I added 1/4 tsp of cloves and nutmeg as well. Perfect for just a couple people wanting an after dinner treat. It is delicious!

I love this apple crisp. the only thing is I doubled the eggs and the butter in the topping. but the first time I made it I did it the right way and that was really good as well. My puppy absolutly loved it too when he got in to it while it was cooling. so very good. I will be making it for thanksgiving.

This was a very good recipe. I used mcintosh apples, but I used more than the recipe called for because my apples were small.  The crust was sweet but not too sweet. Very tasty! Highly recommend!

Left out the egg and used more butter to make a 'crumbier' topping, tossed apple slices with a capful of lemon juice while they rested then sprinkled apple slices with a little extra cinnamon and sugar. Used HoneyCrisp Apples - lots of juice so it came out a little googey but served with vanilla ice cream very yummy!

Not what I was expecting...like many of the other reviewers, I had a crumbly situation with the crust.  That said, I was in a hurry and wanted something apple-y and cinnamon-y and this recipe fit the bill.  It was pretty quick to make and had a great flavor.  In a pinch, I'd make this recipe again although if I was having a pre-meditated apple crisp urge, I'd go with one of the more traditional recipes calling for oats.  Pretty good for what it is, thanks for sharing!

I made this without the egg. I, also, sprinkled a tiny bit more melted butter, (I actually used Smart Balance margarine instead of butter), and a little water to the dish before putting into the oven. This coated the mixture just a little since I didn't use an egg. You can adjust the sugar to your taste. I'll use a tad less next time. I received compliments on this, even more than I do on the apple crisp I make with oats. I made this into a no cholesterol, low-fat dessert because of no butter or eggs and it came out tasting just superb.

A perfectly adequate recipe, though hardly anywhere near the boast of "best", my family ate it without complaint. It certainly was easy to make. Just be sure to use a pastry blender to blend your egg and butter into the flour mixture and you'll have no trouble.

I am surprised at the negative reviews, the first on on the list for example.  said that the topping was like a dough having to rip appart...  perhaps the recipe was not followed corectly, also,  I used a pastery blender and the topping came out perfict.  I sliced the granny smith apples thin and only cooked for just under 30 min and it was a hit! everyone went back for seconds. I will be making it again.

This recipe was fairly good. I agree with other reviewers that the oat topping is probably better. I cut the white sugar from 3/4 c to 1/2 c but would cut even more if I make it again. I was also careful with how I mixed the dry and wet ingredients. I "folded" the mixture just enough to get the ingredients mixed thoroughly. This kept it from getting doughy and rock hard like some people experienced.

This turned out great!! After I spread the topping I added a little water to dampen the topping,a sprinkle of white sugar and dabbed it with softened butter. This made it not so hard or dry. Browned very nicely with the addition of sugar and butter.

I hate to rate recipes poorly as well, but I did not care for this.  I don't know how it made it onto this website.  The egg and large portion of flour makes the topping hard and not crunchy sugary at all.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this recipe at all.

Was told that it tasted good but that it was more of a cobbler than a true crisp as it's missing the much-needed oatmeal that makes up a crisp.  I did not know as I never had apple crisp before...

I found nothing wrong with this recipie and would recommend it to others.
Suggestions to make it much better.
I did not use the recommended cook time.  I used 25 minutes no more.
I also added to the apples 1/8 teaspoon Nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. Nutmeg and cinnamon are our family Favorites.

This was a very easy recipe and was very tasty.  I added the cinnamon to the brown sugar so it was with the apples and I put crushed walnuts in the apple mixture. I also added a handful of quick oats to the flour mixture. I do not know why anyone had problems with the topping going on the apples, I melted butter in micro then added beaten egg and when I put it into the flour/sugar/salt mixture it crumbled up just like normal crisp recipes do. It covered the apples wonderfully. I added some roughly chopped walnuts on top.Have added it to my recipe box. Thanks.

Okay so I have NEVER made apple crisp and had to go to a Mommy & kids brunch and bring a dish to share. I had 4 apples (3 Granny Smith & 1 Gala). I found this recipe and made it (and it was super easy to make). The moms who tried it said it was YUMMY!! My picky 4-Year old said don't forget to bring it home. (She loved it!!) This will be made again & again!! Thank-You!! :)

I'm still stunned that I found a recipe that my husband AND son both love, and why wouldn't they? It's fantastic! No, I didn't get the topping to "spread evenly", but I did get it distributed evenly, and the only complaint I have is that I didn't think to double the recipe.

Loved it!  Kids enjoyed helping.  Husband made it Sat night and when asked to bring a dessert to a Sunday dinner made it again.  Wasn't sure of  the egg but it was good.  I like a substantial, crunchy topping and this recipe delivered.  I didn't find it too sweet either.  Very good!

Wish I would've read some reviews first. It was super sweet and watery at the bottom. That being said, my 11 yr old son made it so it was a fairly easy recipe and my apple crisp hating husband said it was good! If I were to make it, I'd cut back on the sugar and maybe use Granny Smiths - we used Galas.

I took the other reviewers' advice and cut down on the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar and added freshly grated nutmeg.  I buttered the baking dish before adding the apples and brown sugar so there was no sticking.  I also added 8 cortland/ida red applies instead of 6.  I found I had to use a pastry tool to crumble the topping before adding it to the apples.    It looked great coming out of the oven and tasted pretty good.  The crunchy topping was definitely different than the oatmeal based.  Not really better or worse, just different.  It's a good recipe but I like my old one better.

I have never made apple crisp before, but I have eaten plenty of it and know what I like.  This recipe was superb, and very easy.  Now I know the difference between the crunchy cinimonny top and the soggy oatmeal top.  I never much cared for the soggy oatmeal topping.  I always loved it crispy and sweet.  My apples were on the sweet side so I added a Tablespoon of lemon juice as one reviewer suggested.  I would not change a thing, I just loved it! It's a keeper.

Thought this was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was a little too sweet so I will probably use less sugar next time but otherwise it was a hit.

This was really easy and really yummy.  I used Jonathan apples from a local orchard.  The tartness of the apples contrasted nicely with the sweet, crunchy crust.  This is excellent served warm with vanilla ice cream.  My son loved it!  I also saw this same exact recipe demonstrated on Zoom, a PBS kids show.

I made this right by the recipe and THEN read the reviews.  I was thinking, "Oh, great.  Wasted time."  I got it out after 30 minutes, let it cool a bit, and then tasted it.  Mine was perfectly baked with great flavor.  I used 4honey crisp apples and baked it with the foil liner in the pan.

The flavor of the apples was good, however I knew there was something wrong when the consistency of the topping was more like a sticky cookie dough.  I should have known that melting the butter would not make the topping crumbly.  So I added more flour and cinnamon to try to make it more crumbly....no go!  The  topping was rock hard and lacked taste!  I will go to my old stand-by recipe where it calls for cold chunks of butter mixed into the dry mix to create that "crisp" yummy topping.  I won't make this again.

If you overwork the topping you will over develop the gluten and it will end up rock hard, just like it does with biscuits. Some types of food, like bread, need the gluten developed but it is very bad for others, like biscuits, pancakes and this type of recipe. If you have trouble over working it, you might try a low or no gluten flour, like oat or nut flour.
 I only gave this 3 stars because I haven't made it, I just wanted to give this tip. It looks like it should work fine and you can always add more spices if you think it is too bland.
 Also, keep in mind that it would need less sugar if the filling is very sweet, but on a filling that isn't very sweet, the sweetness in the topping might be just what is needed.

Other than slicing the apples the recipe was quite easy. The topping of flour sugar and egg was different for me ,but I didn't mix it up quite enough and so the mixture left some loose sugar that didn't mix in for a good appearance. Very tasty. I will make this again but add more apples and mix the topping up better and cook it less as around the edge the juice and brown sugar harden up on me.

This might be the world’s worst apple crisp recipe. It’s unlike every other apple crisp recipe I’ve ever used and could not possibly yield a proper apple crisp.

Hint: if you get to the part where you make the “crisp” aka not a crisp just a garbage mound of congealed sugar, flour, etc, you can salvage it by mixing the whole mess together with the apple brown sugar mix and turn it into an apple pudding. Like a bread pudding but with apples.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was not that good.  The apples and flavoring were good but the crisp was so crisp you'd need a hammer to crack it.    But as I said, the apple part  is good.

My fiance hates oatmeal of any kind... So this was perfect for him! Everyone that tried it loved it. I made a double batch and had no leftovers whatsoever, lol.It's even better with vanilla ice cream on top!

Excellent apple crisp. A couple changes, as I Never totally  *follow* a recipe. Added to the topping, 1 tbsp vanilla extract &  a touch of water ,maybe 1/8th cup.  Cooked for an additional few minutes until golden brown. My husband loved it, and so did I.

You can add as many as 10 apples and as little as half the sugar. This way it's 3/4 apple and 1/4 yummy topping. This is a great alternative for people who don't like oats.

I loved this recipe! I was nervous when I was mixing the ingredients because it was very clumpy but it came out great! I doubled the recipe and I used gluten-free flour! I used a few different kinds of apples (Gala, Empire, Red Delicious)

As I type, my husband just called out "I know what you mean Elaine, edible but kinda strange."
I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly except I used Johnathon apples from my tree. I did not overcook it; I actually took it out early and the crust was already hard, but not good hard. Put it back until the apples were cooked and the crust hadn't changed. I spooned the liquid (because my apples are a softer apple) over the crust and it did not help, it made it a different form of bad. I honestly couldn't have believed with flour, butter, egg and sugar you could get something unpalatable but the crust really was. Interestingly, my crumble looked exactly like the photo of the recipe BUT bakers beware. Sorry to be negative :(.

This is a really good apple crisp recipe, decided I wanted to make one spur of the moment and just happened to have all ingredients on hand (that never happens lol). The only suggestion I might add is that it's really good to add an element of crunchiness to it.. In my case that was walnuts. I really wanted to add some oats to the flour mixture but didn't have them, so I'll try that next time. But otherwise a great dessert and easy to make. :)

I made this tonight. It was quick and easy. I wouldn't say it's "the best ever" but it is very good. I don't know what happened to the people who reported it to be one or 2 stars. I had no problems and made the recipe as is. Great hot with cool whip!

This was pretty good, ours didn't look like the picture and had a cake like texture but it was perfect that way. I used a little less white sugar. I will make this again but I may cut the butter in instead of melting it. I also made applesauce in the crock pot and we used the juices on top of the crisp. All we were missing was some pecans and ice cream!

I always check reviews but while looking at allrecipe on my roku streaming box I came across this one I follow directions. Mix topping with hands. Topping was very hard and thick. 
I thank I will stick with the oatmeal topping.

I just finished eating a piece of this apple crisp, I left it in for a little extra time, it turned out okay, the topping was crispy and crumbely,and not dry, apples were cooked, the only thing wrong was it was so sweet, cutting down on the sugar will help this recipe. I will make it again. but less sugar next time, outside of that it was very tasty.         Thanks Olga

With no oatmeal around, decided to try this version with some apples that needed to be used.  It turned out really well, though the apples were a tad sweet and too juicy.  I mixed the topping up with a fork and it was crumbly when put on top.  Once baked, it was crunchy and delicious.  I would definitely make it again, though prefer the oatmeal based crisps.

I tweaked a bit - used gala apples, skipped the brown sugar and replaced it with a mixture of white sugar/cinnamon of threw in a half cup of raisins and crushed pecans.  I also used an extra egg in the topping mixture, made it more spreadable.  Baked for 40 minutes and it is nice and syrupy, not at all dry like some of the other reviews.  My family devoured it.  It'll be a main dessert dish at my family Thanksgiving this year for sure.

Not keeping this one. Too much to change, like someone else said, you may as well just find a different recipe. Very strange. Edible only because I have little kids who will eat anything.

I really liked this recipe, and while I haven't made that many Apple Crisps in my life, I've eaten plenty and really liked this, and so did my three friends who I shared it with. I'm not sure what kind of apples I used, but they were definitely on the less sweet and watery side.  Best part is that it wasn't as overly sweet like so many others are, and it was super easy to make!  I used whole wheat flour as my only alteration.

I started making this recipe before I even read the reviews.  I'm not sure what everyone was having problems with but the topping came out great and the crisp was not dry at all.  I did everything according to directions (except my family cans apples like crazy in the fall so I used those instead of slicing my own apples.  One of our jars equals 4 apple slices).  I did not have a problem at all with the topping and I did not use a pastry blender, just whisked it all together and poured on top and came out great!  My husband and daughter loved it.   Goes great with french vanialla ice cream!

I was excited about this recipe b/c it was so easy but when i got to the topping i knew it wasn't going to turn out good. One other review described the topping to a tee.  I tried to spread it over the apples and it was stuck to my hands and spoon and it was so gooey there was no way that it could be poured over the apples.  I left it in the oven b/c the dough would not get crispy but the apples were drying out.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!  By far the best apple crisp receipe I have found and tried.  I would decrease the amount of water slightly, but not omit altogether and yes add a dash of nutmeg like one 'baker' recommended.  Thanks for sharing this 'keeper' of a recipe!!

Really good apple crisp recipe. Less butter   made the topping crunchier. It was fantastic. I ate all of it in 2 days.

The flavors were great, but the topping is definitely too hard. Next time I would use a recipe with rolled oats to break it up.

It was good. It isn't like a 'regular' apple crisp. I added a little bit of vanilla and some water to the crust. We really enjoyed it.

This Apple Crisp was delicious! I used "honey crisp" apples and they were a perfect compliment to the crunchy crust. Look forward to making this easy dessert once again.

This apple crisp was simple (quick and easy) to make and it tasted very good.  I will admit, the crust was a little harder than I expected but a little whip cream softened it right up.  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this again.

Easy and tasty, but a little too sweet.  Next time I will try using more apples (at least 6) so that it is thicker.

A tasty treat on a snowy winter afternoon.  Picky eater liked and non-pickey eater didn't eat that much.  But will keep and make again.

The taste was awesome on this one!  This is my boyfriend's favorite dessert, and he absolutely loved it.  One thing though--my apples came out really watery (at the bottom of the pan)  so I used a slotted spoon to scoop it out--but I'm wondering what I did wrong.  I used Fuji apples--a mistake?

Anyway, they came out GREAT!  Thanks for sharing Olga!

This was a great tasting apple dessert. It was easy to make and the kids really enjoyed it. I didn't try it with a scoop of ice cream on top of my apple crisp but, there is always next time. I will make this again.
