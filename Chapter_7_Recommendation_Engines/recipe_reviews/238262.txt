The recipe was deeelicious !: although because I love to cook, I changed things just a cosh.  I added sweet gherkins because I couldn't find cornichons, which worked and I also added 3 tbl. of chili sauce  with a dash of white pepper with more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for.  Use your own taste levels.  I chopped all the capers instead of chopping 1/2 of the capers according to the recipe video  This is a keeper.  Thank you Chef John

I made this sauce to go with our fresh caught Halibut from Alaska. We had a big crowd of people over for grilled Halibut. This sauce was phenomenal!! Absolutely everyone loved it. We'll be using it in place of tartar sauce from now on!

Unfortunately we didn't enjoy this at all.  The flavor wasn't good.  It wasn't like any remoulade I've tried before and was quite a disappointment.

I substituted Sweet Gherkins because I couldn't find Corichons. It was still delicious this way.

This recipe is over the top in flavor.  I will never buy tarter sauce again.  Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe with us.

I am trying to replicate the Boar's Head Remoulade, which is no longer sold (story of my life). It was NOT Cajun style and therefore not spicy. I eliminated the cayenne pepper, but it still didn't taste like the Boar's Head. Too vinegary for one.

I really liked this.  Added more dill and cayenne pepper.  I put it on portobello stuffed mushroom with crab.

Chef John does it again! I’ve always done store bought but it’s Christmas Eve, Ive got a house full and the crab cakes will be ready in 10 minutes.  Did everything but the Cohnicorns, or whatever they are and it’s perfect. Thank you my friend , for yet another, easy masterpiece.

It was good, although more like tarter sauce, not remoulade.

This was just ok to me.  Made as written and it just didn't wow me for a remoulade or tartar sauce. My husband felt it was too tart and a little too dilly. Used this sauce to go with Connie's Zucchini "Crab" Cakes.
