This is NOT hash. It tastes okay, but is not hash. It's more like a beany shepard's pie. If you dislike corned beef, you'll like this recipe because it is nearly impossible to taste it because the bean flavor is so strong. 
I'll stick with my traditional skillet hash.

I was looking for a way to use some left over beef brisket and mashed potatoes and found this great recipe. I sauteed some onion and green pepper to start then added the beef and baked beans.  I used powder Worcestershire and 1/2 cup salsa and a touch of brown sugar to make get the beans just perfect then topped off the casserole with the mashed potatoes. I only had Monterrey jack cheese on hand and it worked great.  It browned beautifully and tasted fabulous.  I never would have thought to put beans and mashed potatoes in a casserole but it was great. Thanks!

4 stars only because my picky 9 year old ate 2 helpings and no moaning!  Fast and easy to put together but not something I will make again.

I didn't enjoy this as much as I had hoped I would. I suggest putting the beef mixture as the bottom layer, then add the beans. Also, it needs something as far as flavor because it is bland. I think I'll use Sriracha or adobe sauce with chipotle instead of tomato sauce next time. I also advise to avoid using the bland, canned corned beef. It will be nothing but texture here. This would be a great recipe for leftover, homemade, corned beef.  It needs a flavor kick to get the next star for us. Thank you for the recipe.

I was looking for a way to use up corned beef from St. Patrick's Day, and chose this since I had all the ingredients. None of us had ever had potatoes and beans together and were pleasantly surprised. This recipe is a keeper even if it is just for using leftovers. It is also a keeper because it is so easy and fast, thus making it great for busy evenings. My family liked it enough to have more often than once a year. As for those who found it dull, I wonder if maybe the beans were the problem. Since they are one of few ingredients, their flavor matters. I used beans we all like a lot with red peppers, etc...I think by Bush's. The definitely say "Grillin'" on the can. Thanks for the recipe! I cook a ton and never would have thought to put baked beans and potatoes together in a casserole. Just goes to show you CAN teach an old dog new tricks. ;)

So I searched for a corned beef hash recipe, this was the first one I saw. Without reading carefully I started making it only to releize that it called for corned beef and I was using corned beef hash from a can. I used Bushes onion baked beans, corned beef hash & cheddar cheese.  Not bad but I prefer my corned beef hash crispy.
