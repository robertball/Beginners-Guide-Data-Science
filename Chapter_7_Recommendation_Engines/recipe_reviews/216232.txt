Love, love.  I had so many spaghetti squash from my garden this fall that I tried nearly every recipe and this is the first one I'm making for the second time!

I'm sorry to say I didn't like this recipe, and I was sorely disappointed because it has such great ingredients. I like spaghetti squash plain, so I was really excited to try it dressed up, and I've tried GREAT recipes before, but this recipe didn't taste good to me. Sorry that I wasted money on ingredients I wont even be able to eat now.

Really liked it. It's hearty comfort food without being really heavy. I didn't have truffle oil and it tasted just fine.

Excellent recipe! The Truffle oil gives it a real kick. I also decided to "bake it" into a casserole type dish, to fool the kids. After pouring the sauce over the squash, I added breadcrumbs and some more cheese and popped it into the oven. 350 for about 10 minutes. It was a big hit with a nice green salad on the side. Next time I will drain the squash a little better (I baked them the night before -- I used olive oil to grease the baking sheet instead of spray) and let it back a little longer.

I Lalalalalalalalove this! Yay. I think what made it so yummy was cooking the garlic until it was golden to the point of almost brown. It was browned in places, and I had to use red onion because I am out of shallots. I cooked them both together, and used about 2-3 tbsp of the chopped onion. I added 1/4 c of parm to the mix. I salted the squash with No Salt, it works as good as salt and better for me, before adding the mixture on top of the squash. Topped it with a little more parm. I placed the squash and pumpkin mixture back into the shell of the spaghetti squash and baked it a little more until the cheese was melted. After it came out I grated a lil bit of nutmeg on top. Black pepper would be good too. But this is so good! Nutty and the rigth kind of creamy. Thank you.  The rest of you gotta try it.

Prefect for broccoli, but when I used it for macaroni, it came out a little mellow for my family's taste. Did away with the wine, mustard seed, and paprika. Upped the salt to one table spoon and added a cup of cheese. Extra points for the recipe being so flexible!

I brought this to a potluck and it was gobbled up with requests for the recipe.  I didn't have shallots so I substituted 2 tbls. of finely chopped sweet onion.  I also browned the butter which adds a nice flavor.  No truffle oil on hand.  I will definitely make again for a crowd - I liked it as a side dish.

This was really good. I did skip the truffle oil, and used a mix of other white cheeses as I’m not a fan of Parmesan. But easy and delicious, a very different flavor. I’m a huge pumpkin fan and always looking for new non-sweet uses. Non-fat plain yogurt worked well for this.

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out. I love pumpkin and glad I finally got around to making this. I did use a butter/olive oil mix for the shallot and garlic and added extra garlic-I always add extra garlic! I also substituted goat cheese for the Parmesan cheese to give it a little more creamier texture and flavor.

I only used half of the called for yogurt and pumpkin and it was still too much, they drowned out all flavor of the squash. Overall pretty flavorless unless you add more salt and cheese.  I won't be trying this again.

Super easy to make, super tasty and decadent. Forgot to add the truffle oil at first...really rounded out the flavor profiles once we drizzled a tiny bit on each of our plates...also grated a little extra Parmesan cheese on top and served with broiled bacon wrapped scallops. Yum. My husband thought it looked “funny” but then practically licked his plate clean no more than 5 minutes later. It was THAT. GOOD.

This was only okay. I havled the recipe to make with 1/2 of a spaghetti squash . To me this dish needs something other then salt and pepper..perhaps some Italian seasonings or something else savoury.

I didn't have any truffle oil, and I used regular onion instead of a shallot, but everything else was the same. This is the first time I've made spaghetti squash and it was a success!

A meal to impress. I loved it except the garlic was way too overpowering. I plan on making it again except using half the called for amount. I used a full can of pumpkin hoping to dilute it some but it was still too heavy with it. That being said, it was still good and I plan on saving this recipe to make again. Thank you for sharing it!

This was a nice Fall dish and very enjoyable.  I added smoked paprika, since it wanted a little spice for our palates.  Also, served with fried tofu as the main course, but would make a delightful side dish as well.  I put the whole can of the pumpkin in and was generous with the yogurt and parmie, too.  Also, I didn't have truffle oil, but it was still tasty.
