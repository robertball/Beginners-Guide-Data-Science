Used 2 zucchinis sliced,, 1 big yellow squash cut into quarters, 1 onion, 1 green pepper, no mushrooms, and lots of garlic!  Sauteed in olive oil instead of veg oil.  Used some kind of tube pasta and seasonings as listed.  Had cooked shrimp so just threw them in at the end to get warmed up.  I loved it and my husband did too once he spiced it up with more red pepper flakes.

A nice flavor! I doubled the veggies and used linguine instead of rigatoni. If you can use rock shrimp it makes it very simple. I would make it again!

Came out delicious.  No changes were made to the recipe.  Just make sure to choose a pan large enough to hold all of the veggies and shrimp.

Out of rigatoni, so I used ziti pasta. Otherwise, made it exactly as recipe called for, and it came out great.

A few changes I made to this recipe included 4 tomatoes fresh from the garden, in substitute of the canned tomatoes, along with a can of tomato sauce. I didn't have any mushrooms or zucchini but the yellow squash and green bell pepper were perfect. It's a bit of a spicy dish but the whole family still loved it. Also, instead of rigatoni noodles, I cooked casarecce pasta.

I cooked this dish and substituted can crushed tomatoes with three chopped tomatoes and three cans of tomato sauce.  Dish turned out delicious.  Definitely will make again.

I roasted home grown tomatoes with garlic, herbs and olive oil for 2 hours to replace the canned and I left out the red pepper flakes since I was cooking for my elderly mother.  This is a fabulous recipe and will be made often.

I used zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes from our garden.  I also used only 1/4 tsp of red pepper.  I used small shrimp instead of medium size.  I also used thin spaghetti noodles. Family loved it.  I will be making this again.

I'm a novice in the kitchen so when I found this recipe I was very excited.  I made it as directed except I added some asparagus I had in the fridge already.  It came out great and my husband really liked it too.  The only thing that we didn't care for was how watery the sauce was.  I'll definitely make it again but maybe drain some of the juice from the crushed tomatoes. One other thing, I used frozen (peeled/deveined) cooked shrimp but forgot to take the tails off before I added them to the mixture so we had to take each shrimp out by hand and eat them that way.  LOL

I cut the red pepper flakes way back, but we both still thought it was too much. I will make this again, but leave that out, and may very well change my rating then.

Didn't have any squash, so left that out. There was plenty of veggies with out that.

Very good recipe!  I followed another's review & added more heat (more crushed red pepper & Hungarian hot paprika) and would chop veggies instead of slicing.  Other than that, it's a keeper!

I have made this several times and even for my Mom on mother's day. Just realized I've never reviewed it. It's fantastic and I've always made it exactly as written. However, one decided I'd like to try different tomatoes.. fresh diced maybe. The crushed are a little strong. But that has no bearing on this dish.. it's still awesome and worth trying.

I only omitted the red pepper flakes because my family just doesn't deal well with spicy. I also made it with red shrimp as a opposed to white shrimp. My family loved it.

This was one of the tastiest dishes I've ever tried from this site. I scaled back on the pasta and shrimp; actually cut those two in half, but left everything else pretty much the same with the exception of using two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes and some of my own marinara sauce. I also used olive oil...after all, it is an Italian dish, and who uses vegetable oil in an Italian dish?

We still had 6 ample servings and the leftovers were even better than the day I made it for the first time.

My family loved this dish!  I made no changes and they've asked me to make again.  In fact, they want it added to the favorite list.  I can't wait for my garden to begin to reap vegetables that I can use when making this dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe, except didn't use the oregano, used red pepper& 1/2 green..  Added more veggies, then used fresh Parmesan cheese.  Very colorful. This is a keeper, will be so good come summer with our fresh veggies from the garden.

This was very yummy!! The combo of veggies was superb. I used great value organic crushed tomatoes with basil. The only thing I did differently was to cook the shrimp separately in a little butter and drain it before adding it to the sauce. My family really liked it ??

Delicious. I used fresh Roma and compari tomatoes. I used baby bellas & red & orange peppers and half poblano. I wasn’t really thrilled about mushrooms as an  ingredient, however, added to the flavor. .I used Italian herb blend for simplicity. Fresh cilantro and parm regg on top. Bellisimo!

Made according to recipe.  It’s good but not great, we will have it again.  Some of the family sprinkled grated Parmesan on top and liked it better that way.

Smells as good as it looks and tastes. Not a huge squash and zucchini eater but this will be a repeat. This was easy to prepare and good for a picky eater

We are on a liver cleanse diet. I used olive oil and whole wheat pasta. It was excellent!  The family loved it.

I LOVE the fresh vegetables in this recipe!  It was so simple to make and add more (or less) of veggies that you like.  I did omit the mushrooms as we do not prefer them but could see how they would enhance the dish.  Our crushed tomatoes are a little more "crushed" than the photo - maybe used diced to have tomatoes you can poke - ours came out more like a ratatouille but it was delicious!  We also preferred to use rice with our dish instead of pasta.  Our teenagers ask me to make it again!!!  This may have to go into the record books!

It was delish. Will probably add sausage next time for a little extra something. Also used cayenne in place of red pepper which gave it a nice kick.

Excellent recipe.  Used 1 pound of shrimp and 10 oz. of pasta, but all the sauce.  Served with crusty bread and side salad.   Will definitely make it again.

There is NOTHING about this that makes it a primavera. Other than that, it is OK. A little lacking in flavor.

This was delicious and very fresh tasting with all the veggies!  I did make a couple of subs based on what I had on hand......no mushrooms or yellow squash so used lots of zucchini and some red peppers in addition to the green.  Only change I would like to try next time would be to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Really liked this!!

I made this tonight using most of the ingredients listed, minus the mushrooms. I diced the veggies instead of slicing them, and sauteed them in olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used homemade canned pasta sauce and used spaghetti noodles. It was delicious!
