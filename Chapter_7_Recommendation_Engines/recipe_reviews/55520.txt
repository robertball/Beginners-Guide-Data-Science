They were DELICIOUS I never thought that French toast with Chocolate chips in 
the middle would be so good.  Everyone should try these.

My family and I loved this recipe!  I made some substitutions.  I used a loaf of texas toast bread, used only cinnamon chips and doubled the eggs, milk, etc.  It was delicous!

Delicious! I used cinnamon chips in the middle and it came out so good, I can't wait to make this again.

Taste and consistancy great, especially with cinnamon chips - definitely 5 star taste.  I only gave it three stars because of the preparation and baking problems I had. It was very difficult to stuff the bread slices with the chips (especially as indicated with the heaping tablespoons) also I had refrigerated overnight and put it in the oven for specified time and it burned so that we had to scrape off bottom layer of bread.  Maybe someone has some tips, I would love to hear them.  I would love to make it again because it tasted so good!  I added extra real vanilla and some nutmeg and cloves too!

Yuck...  what a flop this was.  I had a half a pan left and literally nobody had a second piece.  I washed a lot down the sink on peoples plates.  Never again!  The flavor was alright but it just ended up being nice on top and a gooey mess on the bottom.

This was a big hit at Mother's Day Brunch.  I baked it about 30 mintues to get the chips to melt.  I thought there should be a little more liquid, next time I'll add one more egg and splash of milk.
