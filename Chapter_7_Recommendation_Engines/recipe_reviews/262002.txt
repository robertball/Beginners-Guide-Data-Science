This was excellent and super simple to boot. Made as written and I do not feel any changes are necessary. I did grill the thighs whole but next time I might cut the chicken up prior to putting it in the marinade and then pan fry it. That way it would be already cut up and easier to incorporate into a stir-fry. Then again, I might grill them whole again. Why try to fix what is not broken?

It was moist and delicious.  It might be a little spicy...so go easy the first time (that's the only reason I didn't give it 5).  I would also suggest..baking it as suggested...and then broiling it for like 3 minutes or so to make it crispy on the outside (turn over on both sides)

Easy and tasty! Baked it this time - will try grilling next time (if the weather cooperates!)

We cooked it on the oven instead of grilling only because it's winter but still, very flavorful yet easy to make!
