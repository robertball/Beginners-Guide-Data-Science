This recipe was much appreciated by my Bible Study friends!  The low(ish) amount of butter in the recipe left me enough to make my own crust.  I used Golden Syrup instead of corn syrup and it tasted lovely.  I also decreased the butter just slightly because I was running out of it.  I used SMOOTH peanut butter which worked well.  This is a simple recipe that is simply good.  It was delicious with caramel icecream!

This is a great, easy peanut butter pie! I needed a recipe without  cream cheese so I tried this. I wanted to make with ingredients on hand, so I substituted creamy peanut butter and 1/2 cup pure maple syrup for the dark corn syrup. Served warm with whipped cream and did not make the caramel sauce. Very good. I will try again with ingredients listed above to see the difference!
