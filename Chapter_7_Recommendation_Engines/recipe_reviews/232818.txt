Thank you for the recipe Jessica.  The cooking time can certainly be increased, but it is normal that different ovens have different baking temperatures.  I used coconut oil in place of the applesauce and the butter - because I didn't have any applesauce and prefer coconut oil to all other oils when baking or cooking.

A nice frosting that I tried out recently that is great on the cupcakes - is 1 cup coconut oil, 3 cups powdered sugar, 5 teaspoons coconut milk.  Whip it up (I just used a fork and didn't bust out the electric mixer, but sure that works too) and spread on the cupcakes - will intensify the tasty coconut flavor even more.

These were delicious! Moist with good flavor, but needed a little something more. First time I made exactly as instructed. Second time, I didn't whip the egg whites first, it seemed like a waste of time, and it was! I just folded in whole eggs, and they turned out exactly the same! Third time I made same as second time, but added chocolate chips in some and sprinkles in others for my sons birthday party. By far the best version! And a hit with all the kids and parents at the party.

My nine-year-old daughter and I made these. We used a little less sugar because I think most recipes call for too much. We over-beat the eggs whites but the cupcakes still turned out fine. We also substituted 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat. Wasn't sure how much coconut milk to use so just "eyeballed" the 1/2 can measurement. Made 15 cupcakes which baked for 22 minutes. Good cupcakes now. Probably perfect tomorrow after we lightly frost them!

The only thing I did differently was using oil instead of applesauce (didn't have any) and instead of using the mixer to combine the coconut milk and coconut...I folded it into the egg mixture. This cupcake is so moist and light. The bake time was 20 minutes even...no longer. This is a keeper. I even doubted myself for making it lol.

Really light, moist, and yummy.  I made a few changes based on my tastes and what I had on hand.  I used cinnamon applesauce.  There was a mere hint of the cinnamon in the cupcake.  I thought I had coconut milk on hand.  I didn't so I used whole milk and added coconut flavoring.  It worked out just great.  The other change was using sweetened coconut.  I frosted them with Wilton's Caramel Macaroon buttercream frosting recipe.  It was an amazing combination.  Despite not being a big coconut fan, I thought these were marvelous.

I read the review that stated that the cooking time was way off and they had to cook theirs for over 45 minutes! That is insane!  They must have made it into a cake or their oven temperature is way off. I left mine in for 25 minutes instead of 20 just to be safe, and they turned out great!  I think next time I will take the suggestion of putting my coconut in a food processor first. The texture is unexpected and a little strange to me, but otherwise very tasty.  One weird thing that I did was, because I didn't have any coconut milk, I used a can of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk and 1 tsp of almond extract with 3 oz of flavored coffee creamer. Sometimes you have to make due with what you have. lol  Lucky for me, they turned out very nice.  Thanks

These were delicious. They required about 4-5 more minutes than the recipe suggested so no issues there. I have no complaints, neither did the husband!

The bake time is WAY OFF. I cooked the cake for 45 minutes and it was still not done in the middle. The flavor is good so I give it a 2 star rating.

I iced them with coconut buttercream and topped that with toasted coconut for a triple coconut delight. They were a huge hit!

I really like these. I didn't have applesauce, so I substituted it with coconut cream. I also didn't add shredded coconut to the batter because I don't like that texture. I was kind of in a hurry, so I didn't take the time to separate eggs either. I simply added one egg at a time, and beat the mixture really well to add air to it. These still rose nice, but I'm sure they would be even lighter had I taken the time to separate the eggs and whip them.  The coconut flavor isn't overwhelming, but it's there; and these are very moist cupcakes too. I iced them with a coconut buttercream and added toasted coconut to the top. I will definitely make these again.

I looove coconut, and I was craving for something healthy too, and voila, here it was!  (didn't make the frosting). These muffins came out nicely, didn't change a thing and I'll be making more for sure.

I subbed just the apple sauce for canola oil and the batter tasted phenomenal, though once baked it lost the flavor. 
I was pleased how moist it was, and the baking time was just right! Will make again by adding more flavor.

This was an excellent cupcake BUT I did make a couple changes. Firstly, at the advice of another reviewer, I substituted  coconut oil for the butter and applesauce.  I didn't have applesauce, and besides, the coconut oil enhances the coconut flavour of the product, which I think most people want. Secondly, I halved the amount of sugar in the recipe, and the cupcake was just right...and still quite sweet.

I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of 1/2 cup.  I love coconut and this is a very tasty cupcake.  Thank you for the recipe.

So delicious and moist!  Flavor is fun, and far as homemade cakes go, relatively simple.  People always ask for the recipe.  It's fun to tell everyone that the cupcakes are made with applesauce instead of oil - moms love that.Thanks for the yummy cupcakes!
