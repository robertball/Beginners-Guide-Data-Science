Great recipe! My family loved the sauce.  The texture was great, good amount of tartness and not too sweet or bitter.  Couldn't find star anise, but I didn't miss it once I tasted the sauce.  Very easy to make as well.

Loved it and followed the recipe... tangerines, too.  I was surprised how it thickened up by morning.  Delish.   Next time will try it with Splenda and dial it back just a bit (Hubs isn't supposed to eat sugar).  This was like thick, tangy candy.

Chef John, I did not reveal this is an EASY PEASY recipes per directions in the video.  The poppin' berry was a great detail, reassuring me that all was right in the pan.  And yes we did ENJOY.  Thanks bunches.

Made for Christmas dinner with ham - delicious, and did not change a thing!  Next time would probably use only 3/4 c. sugar.

Everyone totally loves this recipe. A few things I have learned. Put the cloves and star anise in a cheesecloth bag. Helps you from having to sift through the dish looking for those little buggers. Also, I kicked this up by adding fresh squeezed tangerine juice. Muah!!

10 out of 10! Delicous and easy. Will never serve the canned stuff again. I could not find star anise so I substituted with anis oil 1/4 tsp was a bit strong but still scrumptous. Made the second batch with 1/8 tsp of anis and doubled the cinnamin and cloves..... even better!

Very good! Even though I had to use ground cinnamon (I had ground up all my cin sticks previously) and used a few shakes of 5 spice (didn't have star anise) AND grated in fresh nutmeg vs cloves...this turned out really well. Only did half the recipe (for 2 of us). As good as it was then, I realized I had 1/2 C of crushed pineapple I wanted to use up so that got incorporated too. Also, did half sugar & 1/2 honey. If per chance you have leftovers, I used mine (about 2/3 C) for a sweet n sour sauce base (added water, then strained) and it was an interesting way to create something else from this. Probably would be good for a pork roast glaze also. Just some ideas. Thanks Chef John!

YUMMY! I made this sauce to go with our Easter ham and everyone loved it. I used frozen cranberries, dried Cherries and orange juice, because I didn’t have any Tangerines. Also, I didn’t have the Star Anise, so I just used Cinnamon and it was still very good. I will definitely make this every year, for Easter, from now on. It was a huge hit as an accompaniment with the ham. Very easy to make too. I highly recommend this sauce.

I did not care for the spiciness licorice flavor of the star of anise and maybe also the cloves? Not a fan this time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome! Loved the dried cherries as it gave it a nice texture. Tangerines are a nice suprise since Oranges are  used in so many recipes. I would definetly make this again....I may even add other dried fruit as an addition to the dried cherries!

Used orange juice because I had it on hand.  Didn't use anise because I didn't have any.  Used half brown sugar.  Tasted great.

I don't care for cranberries except in breads but most members of my family do.  This was a big hit with them. In fact I sent all of it home with various family members. I've had numerous requests for this for Christmas. Looks like I've found a new family fav. Thank you!

I made this today for Thanksgiving meal and it was a hit!! My sister who is visiting from Canada loved it, so did my 13 year old grandson and my daughter.  I made it with clementine instead of tangerine because I couldn't find tangerine in the supermarkets...  It was delicious.  I will definitely make again!!

This was an easy side with great reviews.  I added a little vanilla vodka at the end.  The bowl was clean by the end of the meal.

If you have any left pour it over some goat cheese and you will be treated to a wonderful treat. But be warned you may have to make more.. yes it is that good.

I stuck to the recipe, minus the star anise as I do not care for the taste. This turned out amazing! The family loved it and asked that this be the go-to recipe for all Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. I even used the leftover sauce for breakfast muffins the day after, which were also fantastic!

With the Star Anise and Cloves in this recipe, that flavor was very overwhelming...next time (I will make this again) I probably won't add one of these spices.

Used orange juice, no star anise, a little less sugar and clementine zest. This was pretty tart and even though I thought it was great, I think others thought it to be too tart. Will use all of sugar next time and look for tangerine juice.

Followed recipe using satsumas in place of tangerines. It was a little too spicy for me.  I think the star anise overpowers it a bit.

I made this as written except for one thing. I did not include the star of anise (don't like the flavor, not even a mild one). Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was delicious. Everyone was impressed and, of course, I did not tell them how easy it was to make it. Another keeper from Chef John. Thanks for sharing.

Everyone loved it.  The kids and the adults.  The cherry, tangerine, cranberry combo is a hit.  I did not have anise, so I used allspice (I'm sure totally different) but it still tasted great and had high raves.  I couldn't find the three cloves, so we offered quarters to the little ones if they could find them.  All happy and none left the day after Thanksgiving!

I love these different twist on cranberry sauce that turns ordinary into extraordinary. I have tried several of Chef John's cranberry sauces. It is so hard to pic a favorite. This one ranks right up there.

I made this ahead of time and it does get better with time. The flavors mesh nicely. It was easy to make and came out great. Both my daughter and my husband (who aren't cranberry fans) liked this sauce. It's a little on the tangy side but that worked with my other dishes.

Tangerines weren't in season at my grocery store, so I used clementine oranges. So easy! No more canned sauce for Thanksgiving dinner!

I make it every time since the first time. Everybody loves it. No going back to ordinary cranberry sauce again. It comes out perfect exactly as the recipe instructs.

Tried this for the first time this weekend, and absolutely loved it.  There were actually no leftovers, so am getting ready to make another batch.  Wonderful balance of sweet, tart, citrus and zing (anise) at the end.

This is the BEST cranberry sauce I've ever had - and my cranberry addict husband agrees.  He wants me to take it to every potluck I ever attend from now on and wants me to learn how to do canning so we can have it all the time (will I be getting a canning kit and book for Christmas?).  I agree.  The first time we had it was on Thanksgiving day - I served it warm and thought the flavors a bit too strong (he loved it).  Friday we had leftovers and I tried it again - and I loved it.  Today is Saturday and we ate the last of the cranberries - I am in love.  Can't say enough.  I think the flavors continued to meld together as time went on.  Oh, and I dream of eating it on ice cream!  Wow.  Thank you for the recipe and the tutorial on the Roku channel (which is how I found it).

Great recipe!  Tried this at Thanksgiving and making this again for Christmas dinner.  I was never a fan of whole cranberry sauce, but this one is incredible!!  I could eat this be the spoonful.

This is a very tasteful dish.  I used fresh tangerine juice and the flavor really came through.  This is now our tranditional holiday crandberry dish.

I am not a huge fan of cloves, but this is still pretty excellent. It allowed me to use up some dried cherries I had on hand. I was looking for a new twist on the standard cranberry sauce in a can, and this recipe did the trick. It's a little labor intensive, but worth the time. It's a good side dish to bring if it's a potluck type gathering, but if you are trying to cook the rest of a big meal, may be a little too distracting (though you could make it ahead since it will keep in the refrigerator for awhile).

yummy!  I LOVE cranberry sauce and have had my own secret recipe for years...very similar to Chef John, but the addition of Star Anise is new.  I also add a splash of Cointreau after it's finished cooking.
