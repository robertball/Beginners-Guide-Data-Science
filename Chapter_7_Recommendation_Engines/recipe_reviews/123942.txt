With the following changes, I was able to make this in 10 min. flat, which is a good thing, otherwise I would have been late for church!  I used a store bought crust, 12 oz's of cream cheese, and a full 8 oz container of cool whip instead of taking the time to whip the cream.  I used splenda instead of sugar and I only used 2/3 cup since the cool whip is already sweetened. It was such a nice refreshing dessert to have right after church! And no one guessed it was reduced calorie dessert!

I used store-bought pie crusts to save time!  This is an awesome treat and yes it doesn't take long at all.  If it seems too thin even though you went by the directions, just wait!  When it sets in the fridge awhile it will be just fine!

I had orange juice concentrate I had to use up and this recipe was just perfect. I used reduced fat cream cheese and because I had some "free" whipped topping to use up, I used a little over half of an 8 ounce container of that in place of the whipped cream. I cut the sugar back by half. Small substutitions that didn't change the pie much at all. Very creamy--the taste is like a Dreamsicle/Creamsicle, though a little on the sweet side. I might cut back the sugar to a quarter cup next time. We all enjoyed this very much.

While this has cream cheese in the recipe, it is more like a fluffy cream pie.  I used a store bought crust but did buy and whip cream.  Nice flavor but probably not a staple in my recipe box.
