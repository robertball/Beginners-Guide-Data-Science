The grand kids gave these a resounding 5 stars and thoroughly enjoyed making them. Gather up the kids, these are so easy to make.

We have been making these for years.  My 4 kids age 18-24 still want them every Halloween.  They are also known as Skeleton Teeth and Witch's Teeth.  If the apples get too moist pat them dry or the peanut butter will not stick. Don't worry about getting an exact amount of peanut butter on each side.  Easier to eat without the top 'lip'. Have fun.

Who doesn't love snacking on apples and peanut butter? And how fun are these little Halloween treats? Kids will love these! I used sliced almonds because I never have candy corn in the house. Fun!

We switched things a bit and turned out great: green apples instead of red, marshmallow teeth
, and added candy eyes
