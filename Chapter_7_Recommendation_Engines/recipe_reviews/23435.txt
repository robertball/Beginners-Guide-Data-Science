This does not have the depth of flavor that true onion soup should have.  Without slowly browing the onions, it just taste like weak beef broth with a nasty onion taste.  Also, classic French Onion soup does not have beef in.  Sorry, I will try again for a better soup.

Tasty soup! I used all white onions instead of red onions and it turned out great. Will make again.
