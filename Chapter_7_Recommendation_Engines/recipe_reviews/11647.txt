I love this recipe but it's missing a step.  I made this yesterday and my recipe (from a different site) calls for one additional step after it's removed from the oven.  I think you'll find it makes a huge difference in the finished product.  Topping: Spread each warm pastry with about 1/3 cup of jam or preserves. (Any flavor is fine, but our favorites are raspberry and apricot.)  Do this while the almond puff is still warm but not hot from the oven.  Then you sprinkle with the toasted almonds and drizzle with the icing.  I can't imagine this recipe without this step as it would seem very bland to me.

This is the same as Kringler (some call it Danish Kringler, some Swedish Kringler).  I grew up in a little town with TONS of swedish heritage.  This was my favorite thing!  As soon as I was an adult, and moved away, I had to hunt down the recipe for kringler, as I love all things almond.  =)  This is exactly like the recipe that I have.  I agree that for the first time it may look a bit complicated, but it really is so easy.  For the crust, I just put it all down in a baking pan..I don't do the 2 rectangles.  Also, before stirring in the eggs one at a time, I stir the flower/butter mixture a bit to let it cool down a little.

(side note, this is not an overly sweet pastry.  The pastry itself is a choux pastry, made like a cream puff almost.  the sweetness really mostly comes from the icing)

very easy and delicious!!I wasn't sure how these would turn out, the first two layers having no sugar and 3 eggs.They are wonderful!! The only change I made was using almond extract in the glaze instead of vanilla. Will make again! Thanks  Megan!

5 stars plus!  This is a really delicious pastry.  I used margarine instead of butter as indicated in the body of the recipe.  Don't let the lack of sugar scare you.  It's perfect.  The glaze recipe is missing 1 T of milk to thin it down properly.  Add that to the glaze.  I sprinkled mine with red and green decorator sprinkles to make it look festive for the holidays.  Yummy!  My favorite of the Christmas cookie plate this year!

This is a favorite of our family, especially around the holidays.  It's sweet (but not too sweet) and light without being too much work, and it is a nice change to the regular dessert fare.

This reminds me of growing up, my mom used to make this all of the time.  The wonderful aroma, when it is baking, still brings back fond memories! :) I have made this several times & it is always a big hit!

I add some crushed pineapple to the puff filling layer. It's good for a change.

This recipe is in my mother's old PTA Cookbook from the 1970's and I've been making it for serveral years now.  It's worth making and is amazing if you like a pastry with just a touch of almond sweetness.  I use almond extract in the frosting for more almond flavor. Yum!

A friend of mne reluctantly gave me this recipe years ago, saying it was a "secret family recipe." I guess the secret's out! It's more like a cream puff than a kringle, but SO good. It's a nice change from cake and cookies.

This recipe is good tasting but kind of bland like it's missing something. Have checked many recipes for this and all are exactly the same. Does it need maybe salt to bring out the taste and the sweet?  Any one else experience this?

This was ok but not great.  I took it to a cookie exchange and it was the last thing to go.  The almond puff filling portion had kind of a wierd texture/consistency.  I wont make it again but i would tell anyone considering making it to add a little sugar to the filling part..  i think this might help.

This makes a great brunch item but is good anytime.  Excellent with coffee or tea.  It is an old favorite that is just slightly elegant and wonderfully different from the usual fare.  I have been asked for the recipe many times.  It is only good for a day but there have never been any leftovers anyway so not a problem.

These rock... Everyone always loves them. I love almond flavoring. If you don't care much for it, I doubt you'd like these.

The top never really browned, but I made this for someone who likes marzipan and they loved it!  Used almond extract in glaze instead of vanilla to keep with the almond theme.

I made this recipe years ago and then lost it. There's an ingredient missing from the glaze (I finally found my original recipe from a 40-year-old Betty Crocker Cookbook). The original recipe calls for 1-2 tbsp. warm water. Other than that, it's the same.

I only gave it 3 stars because of the missing ingredient.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always the first to go at potlucks! My friend made this delicious variation -- she placed fresh blueberries on top of the dough and covered them with the custard mixture before baking. Yummy goodness!

I did not like the flavor of this at all!  I didn't really understand the need for the two layers that were not all that different either.  The dough was not very good, and if it hadn't been for the glaze, they would not have been sweet at all.  I was disappointed after reading the other reviews, but I will not be keeping this one in my recipe box!

I'm so excited to find this. We had a sweet, elderly lady at our church who would make these for every bake sale and every staff birthday (for staff birthdays, she made two, one to take home and one for the office to share). I absolutely HATE almond extract - this is the ONLY way I will eat it.
I have been dying to find a recipe for this  - but it will always be called "Gladys almond puff" in honor of her!

This was a big disappointment.  I have made Almond Puff years ago but misplaced the recipe.  I am hosting a ladies coffee tomorrow and thought this would be a hit.  Now, I am embarrassed to serve it.  A crisp cookie that looks nothing like the photo.  I followed the recipe exactly!

Was so excited to make this. I love almonds but having not any sweetness to the pastry was bland. I couldn't add enough sweetness to the top to balance, even added raspberry jam!

I made this as directed except for the glaze (I forgot to add the melted butter & subbed almond extract for the vanilla).  It's quite good but where the puff part is thin around the edges it tastes very pie-crusty.  I think I would prefer the puff part on something more like a sweet roll dough.  I read many reviews that mentioned a jam layer but didn't want to alter the recipe that much since I hadn't tried the recipe previously.  The 1st time I ate it, I had it plain & it was good.  The second time I ate it I spread some Polaner cherry preserves over the glaze & sliced almonds.  That made it VERY good though I would still prefer something a little less pie-crusty  with lower calories, fat & cholesterol so that I can have it more often!  Incredibly easy to make.  Thanks!

It looked great when it was done, but it needed some sugar in the pastry part.  It was like eating pie crust to me.  I did add some preserves on the top to try to sweeten it up, but it didn't do the trick.  I won't be making these again.

Excellent!  I lost my recipe, so glad I found yours.  My recipe didn't have a frosting recipe, it called for a can of white frosting.  So if you are feeling lazy or time is an issue...  I will try your frosting recipe to see which I like better.  Thanks for sharing.

I've used this recipe (or one just like it) for twenty years.  I have yet to serve this - either at home or a party - that's it's not completely gone in minutes. It sounds complicated, but once you've made it, you'll realize how easy it is!  Enjoy!

This is my go-to for anytime I need a dessert dish to share, also a family favorite.  Always one of the first to go and have frequently shared the recipe. The no sugar added is a plus but it still satisfies the sweet tooth.  Super simple, yet so elegant looking and delicious

I made a few changes...
I omitted the crust (first 3 ingredients)
ISubstituted Gluten Free Bisquick and coconut oil. I also omitted the frosting, and put 1 cup of sugar in the mix with the flour.  I then pressed the slivered almonds into the soft dough before cooking it in the oven.

I was so glad to find this recipe - the cooking times were wrong on the copy I have from my grandfather and I almost ruined it!
Swap out the vanilla in the icing for almond flavoring, and add a pinch of salt, and it's perfect.

I'm new to baking so I'm not 100% sure how these should have turned out. But you MUST ADD milk to the glaze in order for it to combine correctly. I liked it and even added almond extract to the glaze. Very tasty and crispy and the glaze was pretty good.

This is my family's Christmas breakfast but I lost the recipe the other year. This is almost an exact replica but we use 00 pastry flour (or Wondra), almond extract in the icing and chopped pecans on the top. Really nice! The sweetness comes from the icing but it's my absolute favorite tradition.

I tired this recipe on a whim because I had a craving for an almond dessert. I was not disappointed!  I skipped the sliced almonds at the end in favour of almond extract in the icing. This is a not overly sweet dessert and something I will be adding to my recipe book.

Nothing like the pic my pastry could not be seen and super thin, how much filling was to be layered on? one inch or two also had lots of filling left over a waste of my eggs

My mother-in-law showed me how to make this. She called it Kris Kringle Koffee Kake (sic) I've looked high and low for this recipe but nobody else calls it that. I found it by accident, looking for cream puffs.  Thanks for posting it!

My Mom used to make this and I had lost the recipe, so was happy to find it here.  She used almond extract in the glaze and chopped walnuts instead of almonds on top, but I think almonds carries the theme better.  They are wonderful!!
