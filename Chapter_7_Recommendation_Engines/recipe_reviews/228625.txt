Oh my goodness!! This recipe is TERRIFIC!!!  My kids and I are licking the spoons, and pots as I write this :)  I followed the recipe exactly, except I decreased the sugar to 4 1/2 Cups.  I used very ripe pears and the jam is REALLY sweet. I could have almost used even less sugar and it would have been sweet enough.  But it is still very, very good.  Thank you for this keeper!!  Now I am hoping our pear tree will produce as well next summer so I can make this again!!! :)

So easy to make, all my cans sealed! I did reduce the sugar to 3 cups. Once I tasted it with the 3 cups in it, I didn't need it any sweeter. I also reduced the spices in half, per one of the recommendations. I like that the spice doesn't overwhelm the pear flavour.

Give it  4 1/2 stars. Was alittle sweet but the flavor was there with the spices.Did not have powdered pectin and had the liquid version. Used 1 package (3oz) and added it last after it started into a full boil. I continued to cood for another 1min. Turned out well. I had alot of pears and was looking for recipes. I made pear bread and used the pear jam over it. It was delish.

My whole family loved this!  In case you're wondering, the recipe requires 6-8 pears.  If you half the sugar and spices you'll still need the 1/4 cup of lemon juice, 1 tsp of butter, and 3 tbsp of pectin.  This recipe yields around 8 jelly jars worth.

I made two batches of this recipe.  I only used four cups of sugar and suited my sweet tooth just fine!
This recipe reminds me of Apple butter.  On the second batch I used only four cups of sugar and cut each spice in half.  Could actually taste more of the pear flavor in this batch.  This recipe is so easy and delicious.
It's a "keeper" in my cookbook!

This recipe turned out great!  I used low sugar pectin and only added 2 cups of sugar and it is still plenty sweet.

This is a fantastic jam that has become a family favourite, and have given this gem of a jam to many friends and family. 
There were no changes to make as I have with many recipes. An absolute must to try with no disappointments from anyone who's tasted it. Also makes a fabulous glaze on any meat dish.

Reduced sugar to 3 cups and cut spices in half which, along with having very juicy pears this year, meant that we got sauce instead of jam. Which is perfect on the Acadian Vanilla ice cream we get from a local ice cream factory. I did simmer for at least twice as long too. Mostly because I liked the smell. Our pear tree was very prolific this year so, I’m going to try for another batch.

I only changed the amount of sugar to 4 cups per other's suggestions. It turned out wonderful!
I used starkrimson pears which is why my pears are more red compared to other photos.

Excellent recipe! According to my daughter "tastes like Christmas!". Only adjustment required - add only half the sugar.

I love this recipe. The kids, husband, and grandparents all love it as well.  It tastes like fall.  I did reduce the sugar to 4.5 cups, but didn't make any other changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with 3 times the everything but only twice the sugar and it turned out  more like pear sauce than jam, but I have to admit that I don't have proper canning equipment so i just pour the hot goop into ball jars and let them cool to vaccuum seal.  This time I am trying it with more pectin - 1tbls per cup of fruit and a 16 oz package (approx 3 cups according to my pyrex cup measure) of organic Coconut sugar. Fingers crossed. :)

The taste is absolutely amazing!!!  I was worried that the recipe didn't call for enough fruit pectin.  The jam is still a little warm and a little thin.  HOWEVER, I put a small bowl of it in the frig and it set up wonderfully!!  I'm being impatient. I would absolutely recommend this recipe to everyone.  Best jam recipe ever!

Don’t substitute sugar with Stevia (Diabetics) unless you have a sieve for straining after adding it and boiling. Stevia floats around in clumps. I substituted 3 C. Stevia + 1 C. Honey because Diabetes IS an issue. Like another, the powder pectin called for wasn’t enough; used whole packet. Hoping it sets up better when jars have cooled.

I did like the others, I used 4-1/2 cups of sugar and half the spices. It was great, but next time I will use 4 cups of sugar and will use the the entire box of Sur-Jell, There was about a tsp or so left over when I used 3 tbs that the recipe called for. It wasn't as thick as I would have really liked.

Yum! I played with portions and used the crockpot. I'm not a cook, so I miscalculated on the pectin since I had more pears than the recipe. Anyway, YUM

It's such an easy recipe and the spices are delicious but way to sweet. I will make it again but will reduce the sugar and boil longer to thicken. I also added done apples and 1 1/2 times the spices. I also added 1/4 cup crystallized ginger. Either way you can baste this on a pork toast, jam on toast. Very nice recipe. It's a keeper.
