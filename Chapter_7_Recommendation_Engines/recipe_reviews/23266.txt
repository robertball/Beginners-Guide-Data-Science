I have made this cookie for 4 yrs. and it is still everyone's favorite. It even won 2nd. place in a charity contest! It is a little involved to make, but well worth the effort. I use a wine bottle cork dipped in a little flour to make the "thumbprint" and I have found that seedless jam really does work the bset.

Great, and an even better thing to do is make them in a mini muffin pan and use the bottom of a wooden spoon to deepen the hole.  The end result is that you have cute little mini tartletts!

OH MY GOSH!  I have found a new favorite cookie recipe!  These are awesome!  I saw the same recipe in my Taste of Home cookbook, so when I saw it here, too, I just knew I had to try it.  I did make a few changes: 1. I used vanilla instead of almond, simply because I didn't have any almond extract...they were still superb.  2. Due to reviews, I added a tablespoon or two more sugar and a few tablespoons less of flour....they were not dry at all and rolled very easily.  3. I did not have "seedless" jam, so I used regular kind (with seeds)....just fine....I can't see a reason to use seedless, unless you have dentures :)  Sidenote:  The cookbook recipe called to chill the dough for an hour.  I was impatient and did not do this, and they were great.  It did say, though, it would make the dough easier to handle, so if you're having trouble, maybe trying the "chilling thing".  I just can't get over how outstanding these cookies are....must try this one people!

These cookies have been a Christmas family favorite since they first appeared in a Pillsbury Classic cookbook many years ago. Nothing to change or tweak...buttery and tender cookie that just melts in your mouth. Every year I say I'm going to try a different flavor jam but always continue to make them as is, with the raspberry.  This is simply a delicious cookie that makes a pretty presentation on a Christmas Cookie platter.

This is a DELICIOUS cookie that I have been making for the past several holiday seasons.  It is delicate and flaky.  Great served with a cup of fresh brewed tea.  The "other" Raspberry Almond Shortbread Thumbprints recipe on this website, is the "exact" cookie base as this recipe.  The only difference is the measurement of glaze ingredients.  My family will be making several dozens this holiday season!

These cookies are wonderful! I am forever making them! If you don't have any jam, then just bake without they still taste great! Also feel free to substitute the almond extract for vanilla.

Wow!  What a terrific cookie!  Everyone that's tried them today, LOVES them.  Just to reinforce...it is best to chill the dough and I used the tip from someone else about using the 1/4 tsp. spoon to make the "thumbprint"....kept them uniform and the jam melted well to fill in the hole.  I am not an almond fan so I used vanilla extract and they are REALLY good!  I'll be making more of these for my holiday trays this year.

My gosh these area excellent cookies.  These cookies melt in your mouth.  I really didn't think they would be "that" good...but...wow, they were.  I used sugar-free raspberry preserves only because I picked up the wrong jar, and it worked out fine.  I also used the frosting drizzle.  Wonderful recipe.

Yummy recipe!! I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla instead. Also I added 1/2 cup blanched finely ground almonds to the dough. I halved the recipe, what a huge mistake!! Next time I'll definitly double.

These cookies went really fast. My boyfriend doesn't usually care for sweets, but he liked this recipe a lot. I made half with rasberry preserves and the rest with black cherry. Both were delicious. Next time I'm going to make a double batch and try freezing the dough for a fast treat.

Yum!!! A little more work than I'm used to with cookies, but definately worth it. One of the best cookies I've ever had. I received rave reviews and a few people thought I picked them up at the bakery.

OH MY GOSH!!! If you only make a single recipe, you better hide these fabulous confections. These are one of the best cookies ever. Don't change a thing, the recipe is perfect as is. Need to allow for some spreading room on the baking sheet. Used all-fruit (seedless) instead of jam.

Wonderful recipe! The almond glaze makes it unique - I received many compliments at a recent Christmas party.  It is SO INCREDIBLY EASY!  Thanks again.  They will be a holiday tradition.

I've made these twice... The first time I wasn't pleased with the appearance, but it tasted good. The second time, I used a melon scooper for perfect sized cookies, then with the 1/4 tsp I made the indent instead of using my thumb. Now i had a perfect space for the right amount of preserves but it still melted weird. Afterwards I melted down the preserves and poured it over the baked cookie to clean up the look. I'm rating it 4 stars because I think that melting the preserve should be done - otherwise it is a great recipe!

we love love love these cookies, my husband is a huge fan of shortbread cookies. We make them for friends and family all the time now because they request them. I guess the only complaint I have is, it doesn't make enough in each batch. Other than that, they were yummy!

These were the favorite cookie this year at all Christmas functions I attended.  I did 1/2 blackberry and 1/2 raspberry.  I used seedless jam in a baggie with a snip in the end to fill them.  I made the hole with a wine cork (I have plenty of those!) dipped in flour.  I thought they were very easy and beautiful.

These cookies are awesome, I made them and they came out great! However I changed up the recipe...Take a white chocolate baking bar and melt half of it! Dribble that over the cookie instead of the sugar glaze, honestly one of the best cookies ever. Try it you won't be dissapointed!

These were very, very frustrating to make.  5 stars for taste, but 2.5 for ease of preparation.  I followed the cookie recipe to a tee, except that I doubled everything.  After chilling the dough for an hour they were SO crumbly it was impossible to shape them into balls and make the thumbprint without them cracking all over the place.  I have now made 4 different batches, varying the size of the ball and the thumbprint to get them perfect and the "prettiest" ones were when I used one level tablespoonful of dough, rolled into ball, indented using the end of a wooden spoon and baked for 11 minutes.  They remained ball-shaped and the jam stayed put.  All others turned out really gross-looking and I think presentation is important (that being said, the appearance of these cookies can really be saved by the icing drizzle).  If I make these again I will NOT chill the dough before shaping and filling the cookies... perhaps after.   Again, they get 5 stars for taste!

Eh, these were ok. I consider myself a great baker, but these just did not turn out. They did not hold their shape at all during baking, so I tried another reviewers suggestion of baking them in a mini-muffin tin. Those ones turned out a little, but they were all still hard as rocks the next day.

Loved this recipe, I did chill the dough in the fridge for 1 hr and then chilled for a further hour after shaping them as I wasn't in a hurry for them. I just wish I had put a bit more jam in them as when they baked they spread ever so slightly and the indent was then only half full of jam, but looked and tasted great. Will definately be baking these as xmas gifts for friends and neighbours, much nicer than any store bought muck!

Simply put, this is an excellent cookie. They are easy, attractive and delicious.   I made 16 different cookies last Xmas and this was my personal favorite. If using as gifts or for important company, it is best to serve same or next day. After that the cookies become soaked and the icing takes on a pink hue; they still taste good, though.

These are delicious!!  They are by far the best cookie I have ever made.  I didn't change the recipe at all and they rolled up fine.  I did add more rasberry jam than listed, but that's because I love the taste.  The cookies don't need the frosting for taste, but it sure does look pretty when added!

Butterery crumb texture with nice almond flavor. Wasn't so adept at drizzling with a spoon. Will try the plastic bag w/ corner hole method next time.

These are fantastic cookies!  I made some with the jam and some without for my jam-hating boyfriend.  I love the buttery almond taste.  These are very pretty and I will plan to make these at Christmas for years to come.  This made about 36 cookies for me.  I had no problems with the dough being dry, and I only refrigerated mine for about 30 minutes.  I used my 1/8 tsp spoon to make the indent instead of my thumb and pressed deep so I did not have a problem with the jam spreading.  Also, I had to cut the cooking time to about 12 minutes as these browned up really fast.

Some of the best cookies I have ever made. I substituted Amaretto for the almond extract in both the cookie and the glaze (2-3 tbsp Amaretto for 1/2 tsp almond extract) as I love Amaretto.

Excellent, easy cookie.  Too easy to be so good actually!  This would be a great Christmas cookie.  I'll make this again and again.

The only thing I did differently was that I sifted powdered sugar over the cookies and didn't do the glaze.  They were still great!

I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  These are the best cookies ever!!  I love the flavors together.  The recipe is also very easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand, so no shopping was needed.  I took these to an office party where they were all gone in seconds, and several people asked for the recipe.  I plan on making these to add to a gift basket with some wine and cheese and bread.

These cookies are ok, but a little too crispy . I'd prefer a more tender cookie.

I made these this year for my cookie platters and they came out great! I didn't have any almond extract (oops..left it off the shopping list!) so I just used vanilla. I'm guessing they will be even better with the almond extract. My husband likes these so much that he said we wouldn't be giving any out because he was going to eat them all!!  Definately a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely divine.  I added an almond sliver at the edge of the thumbprint (for aesthetics) and drizzled melted white chocolate instead of powdered sugar.  Heavenly.

This was just delicious. I think I gained a few pounds because I couldn't stop eating them. I made them with apricot jelly instead of raspberry, and it was delicious. They came out a lot bigger than I wanted, though. Next time I'll make the balls of dough really small.

5 stars for taste, but 3 for the final appearance. I had no problem with the prep (no crumbling), but they really spread out and flattened in the oven. I did have the dough in the fridge; did use a cork for the hole. I used strawberry preserves and also apricot. The glaze helped but it wasn't as pretty as I would have liked. I would still try this recipe again.

These are one of my favorite cookies. I've been making them for years, mostly during the holidays. They are absolutely delicious. I usually use raspberry jam, but I have tried homemade choke cherry jam as well, which was just as good. I noticed some reviewers had problems with it after chilling the dough. This recipe works best if you do not chill the dough. When the butter is soft it is easier to shape the cookies. I usually have a lot of glaze left over, so I've started cutting the glaze recipe in half or doubling the cookie recipe if I need more cookies for company.

i'm deducting a star for presentation....mine turned out very flat, nothing at all like the posted photos (recipe does not call for baking soda or powder), so these are not cookies you could give away or bring to a friend.  taste will put you into an immediate diabetic coma -- very buttery and sweet.  i used raspberry preserves for half and peach for the rest.

These were delicious! I loved the almond & raspberry flavor combination. I formed the cookies while dough was still a little soft (easier to work with) & then put them in the freezer for a little bit to firm them up. I didn't use the glaze this time because I was mixing with other cookies & was worried it would be messy but may try next time. They tasted great without them anyway. Everybody thought they were delicious!

These cookies are insanely good. I took a batch to work...you have never heard so many primal sounds! Made these for my mom during her Christmas visit, and she just couldn't get enough of them. This will be a family favorite for years to come. Nobody can eat just one!

This was the worst and dryest thumb print cookie I ever made. I don't know what I would sugguest to make them tastier. May less flour, more sugar, vanilla. In any case try another receipe.

These're all right... but not what I was looking for.  They came out very dry and crumbly (although maybe it's different if you're not in the desert).  I'd recommend Jam Filled Butter Cookies instead, because they still had a bit of a chew to them, were tastier too, I think.

What a great cookie for a cookie exchange!  They were simple yet extremely tasty.  I did not use the glaze, just dusted the tops with powdered sugar.  I got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipie.  Definately will make a repeat appearance next year!

These are a must have addition in your cookie trays!! SOOOOOOO YUMMY!!  Made as is but added more like 1/2 tsp jam to the cookies.  Glaze needed more like 3-4 tsp water to make a good drizzle consistency.  Such a delicious thumbprint cookie.  I suggest doubling the recipe beacuse I don't think you get 42 cookies per batter and they go quick.  If you are not a almond fan-add any liquer, vanilla or lemon extract.

I gave these 5 stars for the combination of the ease of the recipe and the good flavor of the cookie.  I used 2 tablespoons of Amaretto in place of the almond extract (next time I will use 3 tablespoons).  Perhaps because of this substitution, I had no problem at all with the dough being dry.  I filled them with blueberry jam and lemon curd.  Both tasted wonderful, but the lemon curd ran a bit and the cookie wasn't as nice looking as the jam filled ones.

The cookies were great right from the oven, but after they cooled they were super crumbly, and rather flavorless.  I guess I just like "BIG" flavor.  I will still make them again, I just will have to play with the recipe a bit. Thank you!

I noticed that some people mentioned having trouble with the dough.  My tip is to use a small cookie scoop (with the squeeze handle)..no need to refrigerate the dough, the size and shape will be perfect.

These cookies are soooo yummy!  I try to put them in the freezer and save them for company, but they don't stay there very long.  The jam does spread, so make sure to make a deep thumbprint or it may spill over.  I also find they brown quickly so I only bake mine about 9 mins.

The taste of this cookie is a tiny bit too sweet for me but its still so good.  I'm supposed to be on a diet and still ate at least 5 a day until they were gone.  The jam spreads out a little too much, next time I'll try to leave the dough in a ball shape and press a deep thumbprint to see if it might be a little prettier.  Even if I can't get it to be prettier I'm still making these for Xmas this year. :)

Great tasting cookies.  Very rich in flavor.  One batch does not make very many cookies.

Really good and buttery, however I tried the jam and it didn't work. Used chocolate kisses/hearts instead. Good buttery taste.

They tasted good, but were hard to form because they were too dry. I would reduce the amount of flour next time.

This is now my favorite Christmas cookie edging out the traditional sugar cookie ever so slightly.  I grew up with my mother's thumbprint but honestly, I don't think her recipe is as good as this one.  The raspberry and almond are a perfect combination in this easy to make cookie.

The dough was very soft & sticky. I couldn't even make a hole in the centre because it was very soft & stcky. In the end i made pineapple tarts with the dough.

Great recipe!  It received many raves at a work party I took them to.  The only thing I changed was I used cherry jam instead of raspberry (it was what I had on hand).  Also, I let the dough chill all day...and it was rock hard and impossible to work with when I took it out of the fridge.  After it thawed a bit, it was fine.

After reading all the great reviews for these cookies, I expected them to be as good as everyone else claimed. I was very disappointed, especially with the glaze. It overpowered the cookie and tasted too strong. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband hated them, and he'll usually eat anything!

My newest favorite cookie recipe!  These have it all.....taste, texture and a very showy appearance...they turned out perfectly.  I used jelly rather than jam but otherwise followed the recipe carefully and wouldn't change anything else next time.  The taste of shortbread, raspberry and marzipan ....YUM!

These cookies are delicious.  Am making a lot of cookies for a special occasion and had already made some with rasberry jelly so I used Baker apricot fine dessert filling instead of the rasberry jelly with excellet results.  I refrigerated the dough overnight.  I find when making many different batches of cookies it is much easier to mix up many recipes one day refrigerate them and do all the actual baking the next day.  The only thing I will do different with this recipe the next time I make it is to double the recipe and reduce the almond flavoring in the glaze to 1 tsp.

Great tasting cookie with good texture.  Beware of putting too much jam/jelly/preserves as it runs in the oven.  Make the "thumbprint" deep enough to contain your topping (my main problem).  The colors are nice and if well made, are quite impressive looking.  I'm sure I'll get rave reviews when i take these to work!

These were really good tasting cookies.  I made them MUCH smaller.  The dough spreads really thin if you make them too big.  I also used apricot preserves and they were even better than raspberry.

Great cookie, I wasn't sure at first, however the thought of raspberry & almond together sounded good. Every time I make these (about once a month now) I get another request for the recipe.

Everyone loved these cookies.  I had to add water to get a dough formed, but it didn't change the consistency or taste.  (works great as a valentine's cookie with the rasberry, could change the filling for other holidays)

These were very tasty and easy to make.  I found that scooping the jelly with one of those little skinny metal baby spoons into the "thumbprint" makes the process go a little faster.
