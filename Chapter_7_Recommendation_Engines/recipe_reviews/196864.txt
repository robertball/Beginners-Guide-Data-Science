First Timer here. Never canned or jarred a thing in my life. Tried three different pickling recipes from this site and this recipe ROCKED! I couldn't find the schezuan peppercorns so I used 3 dried chili peppers per jar, waited the WHOLE week, my God they were good! Fear not! This was so simple and better than anything you pay $4 or $5 a jar for in the store. Thanks for the recipe and the confidence to try more!

This was so-so.  I really love smoked paprika, but it really does not complement the okra.  Next time I'll leave it out.

Excellent recipe. Usu I'm not a big fan of okra but the smokiness of the paprika really brings out its best flavors. Madly rocks!

This is the best recipe for pickled okra I have ever tried, they turned out perfectly. My mother ate the first jar we opened almost completely by herself! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I did not add the peppercorns. My son loves spicy pickled things so I made this for him. He really liked it. He asked me to lower the vinegar in the recipe a little bit and add more garlic so I did. After that perfection!

Great recipe! Thats exactly how I make mine but I never thought of adding smoked paprika. I'm going to try that tomorrow. Thanks again! OH yeah, I also use toasted mustard seeds with the peppercorns.

I made this but I think maybe 1/4 c paprika was a typo. I used about 1 1/2 Tablespoons and it was great! Also 1/4 c red pepper flakes was way too much for our tastes. I used 1 Tablespoon flakes and it was the perfect about of heat. My liquid was also very red like someone else commented but it was AWESOME! Will be using this every season.
