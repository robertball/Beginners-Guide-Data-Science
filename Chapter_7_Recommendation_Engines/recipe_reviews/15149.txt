Let me start this off by saying I hate making sugar cookies. I hate the rolling, I hate the crumbling, I hate the chilling, I hate everything that makes sugar cookies what they are. I'd only make them when I couldn't get out of it. And my 6yo DS has the most convincing big brown eyes. Anyway, this cookie has made me a convert. 

It doesn't need much chilling (1/2 hour to 45 minutes does well for me), the texture is GORGEOUS and doesn't get dry or sticky between rollings. I actually make these willingly. I'm making 3 pink batches, one for each of my kids to take to school for Valentines Day. I'm using the Easy Valentine Sandwich cookie method from this site to make them sandwiches (along with the frosting). I think they're truly fantastic. Laura, you ROCK to have restored my faith in easy cookies.

Great recipe... very easy.  I rolled them out on parchment paper, removed the excess and baked on the paper on cookie sheets.  Much much easier than moving them to a cookie sheet and risking messing up the shapes.  FYI, the parchment paper can be used several times!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This dough is very easy to work with IF you chill it overnight.. And, for those of you who say the flavor is bland, remember to use PURE vanilla. Don't waste your time with the fake stuff, you will be disappointed after all your time spent. I also use 2 tsp. not 1 tsp. as called for. Try them again--Chill overnight, use PURE vanilla, and double the amount of vanilla.. This is the easiest dough to work with and the taste will be much better.. (also, make sure you beat the butter and sugar for at least 3 minutes, add eggs and beat for another 3 minutes.Add flour mixture and mix only till incorporated in, don't over mix)

This recipe made an excellent dough for cutouts - very easy to work with.  (Not one of my cookies broke!)  They taste good, too, and were easy to frost and decorate.  Tip:  When the edges are JUST turning brown, take them out.  I found that rolling out the dough to about 1/4 of an inch, or a little higher, worked better than making them thinner.

This was a GREAT recipe!! and do I have a tip for you!  I used 1C of "Splenda" and added another 1/4C cream and made them sugar free!  They rolled like a dream.  My mother is diabetic and was 107 after eating them. I also live on the east coast and found that in my electric oven using 335 degrees for about 18 - 20 minutes gave me more control on how they turned out.  I also switch the pan on the bottom with the one on the top rack.  It makes them more even. Finally, (not the diabetic ones)I frosted them with a sugar cookie frosting from this website.  A perfect pair!

I had a difficult time choosing a classic Christmas cookie recipe and am VERY glad I chose this one... not too chewy, not too crunchy, great taste, not too bland or too spicy, and very easy.  The dough rolled out great, as long as we kept it refrigerated the whole time and cut off a hunk of dough to roll one batch at a time.  The "scraps", we rolled into a ball and chilled in the freezer, and then rerolled.  I will be using this one again!  Thanks!

Out of four sugar cookie recipes from this site that I experimented with, this was the best by far!  I made over 200 cookies for an open house, decorated them simply with small amounts of buttercream frosting, and they were all gone!  My dad and I have been looking for a new sugar cookie recipe - this is it!  Thank you, Laura!

This is a great recipe, although I tweaked it. I doubled the vanilla, added 1/4 tsp. almond extract, and only used one teaspoon of baking powder. I did not have time to refridgerate dough, but cookies rolled easily and held their shape well. There were a lot of us in the kitchen, and everyone was pleased at how easy this recipe was. Definately a keeper.

The taste was ok but it wasnt really a very soft cookie... not something to really decorate. Definitely not something to make masses of. I would make it again but i would roll the cookie 1/2 inch thick instead. I tried this with a few and it made it better. Be sure to take them out before they really start browning otherwise they will be crispy.

Used this recipe with toddlers and with a LOT of supervision!  They did great!  Dough was easy enough for them to work with - not too soft and not crumbly at all.  Following previous comments, I didn't roll this out too thin, and removed when edges began to brown.  Very easy to frost.

This has to be my favorite recipe for sugar cookie cutouts! Dough does not stick at all to the rolling pin. Just made a box mix to compare and did not even match the quality.

My Tips for awesome cutouts using this recipe:
*Double the vanilla 
*Might need a bit more sugar
*Make sure to chill dough overnight
*Use parchment paper for rolling, chilling and baking. Do not move cutouts.
*Very little flour is needed when rolling.
* Let cutouts relax and chill after cutting with cookie cutters for at least an hour in the fridge (just transfer parchment paper with cutouts still on.)
*Bake for 10 minutes.

I made these last year and everyone devoured them! I forgot to post pictures and review though until now. I really recommend using parchment paper to roll and cut on. You just peel off the extra dough around the cut-outs, lift up the whole sheet of paper and place it on the cookie pan. This way you don't ruin the shapes by picking them up individually. Also, be sure to roll no thicker than 1/4" or the cookies will get puffy.

I just tried this recipe, and it is the BEST sugar cookie cutout recipe I've ever tried!  I added about a teaspoon of almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon of salt (since I use unsalted butter for baking) and they were perfect.  Easy to work with, great flavor.  Many on here have mentioned their lack of sweetness, and it is true - this is not a super sweet cookie because it is intended to be frosted.  In my experience, cookies that taste sweet enough on their own are sickeningly sweet once you add the frosting, sugar sprinkles, etc.  So if you are wanting a cookie to eat as is, look elsewhere.  But this is a perfect base for yummy frosted sugar cookies!

These are the only sugar cookies that I have made which do not spread out so much to where the cookie cutter shape is not clean. These are amazing!

Very good, not too sweet, crisp cookie that everyone loved! Easy to make, though I ended up mixing this up with my hands, because it was very thick. I got less than 5 dozen cookies, though, and didn't use a very large cut out. I will most certainly be doubling this recipe in the future.

wonderful recipe - took Valentine cookies to the doctors office staff - they were goobled up!  I used 1/4 more sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and added 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Rolled out on counter top using powder sugar - crunchy on the outside - soft in the middle

I love this recipe.  I have used it for about 17 years.  I do divide the dough into 2 - 3 portions, wrap in wax paper and form into a ball before chilling, so it is ready to roll out.

This is a GREAT recipe! I have never made sugar cookies until today. I made the dough 2 days ago but was unable to roll/bake the cookies until today. Once the dough warmed up it was super easy to roll out and cut. I tasted one from my first batch and it was delish! Not too sweet, had a little tiny bit of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. I'll be using the sugar cookie recipe from now on. I actually can't wait to make cookies again!

Amazingly good!  The tip to use sugar to help roll out was a stoke of genius!  It added a crisp sugary crust to a sedately sweet cookie.  My grandson and I will use this recipe every Christmas for the foreseeable future.

I was expecting something much, much better than the actual end result of this recipe. After reading so many "wow" reviews, I was sure this was going to be the ultimate sugar cookie, but I was quite disappointed. These cookies were edible but nothing I would bother making again. While the dough was heavenly to work with, the flavor was lacking. Doubling the vanilla or using another flavoring, such as almond extract, would have helped, but still wouldn't have made this a "five star" recipe. The texture isn't quite right either, I prefer a much softer, dense, and moist cookie. These turned out dry and somewhat cake-like, despite the fact that I didn't bake them too long. I experimented with rolling the dough out at different thicknesses and found that about 1/3 inch yielded the best results, but still, only a merely "edible" cookie. Definitely not worth the calories, sugar cookies should at least be somewhat sweet and these are perhaps the blandest cookies I've had in quite some time. I think that this recipe has received a misleading number of positive reviews simply because the dough is very workable and the ingredients are simple. May seem like an excellent recipe to those who are not very experienced with baking for these reasons, but anyone who is an experienced baker will be very disappointed. I made about 3-4 dozen cookies with this recipe and while we did consume the majority of them eventually, everyone agreed that they weren't even close to "irresistable".

A really tasty cookie and one that keeps it's shape when baked.  We frost with a butter cream icing and decorate with sprinkles, etc.  These are our best selling cookies.

I found the dough easier than most to deal with. Was a little concerned after letting it chill overnight because it didn't want to come out of the bowl and it seemed very hard.  However after removing it from the bowl I was pleased. Also I followed someone's suggestion of adding some sugar to the flour when flouring the rolling out surface. It kept the cookies from getting to floury a taste. Overall very pleased.

I followed the instructions to the tee, and it didn't come out right at all. The dough was wet. And when I baked them, it had a hollow texture to the cookie and it didn't taste sweet at all, it was a little salty, and I didn't even add salt to this recipe. I don't know how the others got theirs right, when I followed everything it says for me to do. :(

I'm on the hunt for a great sugar cookie recipe, but I don't think this is it. Though the dough was easy to work with, they just weren't as flavorful as I would like.

This makes a great sugar cookie.  I made them for my Mommy & Me group to decorate cookies and multiple moms asked for the recipe.  Making them again I might reduce the amount of baking powder.  They rose a lot, making some of the more intricate shapes lose their definition.  But very yummy!

I wanted to make my family a bunch of Valentine's cookies & chose these because I wanted to cut them out in heart shapes. This dough was very easy to work with. I do think it either needs more sugar or needs frosting though...it is a little plain tasting just aprinkled w/ sugar even though I added almond extract...next time I will inncrease both the almond & the vanilla extract. I made some as sandwich cookies w/ raspberry filling (yum!), some w/ sugar sprinkles (OK), some w/ a thick frosting (good)& some w/ raspberry liqueur added to the frosting (My fave...the flavors were light & really good). I also made some teeny tiny heart shaped ones for my dogs that I left plain w/ no additional toppings. Since this recipe isn't very sweet I thought it would be OK.

My kids love these cookies. They made them twice in the last week. They are just like the bakery kind in our town.We made clover shapes for the 4-H and pumpkin shapes for my daughters kindergarden class.

Without the frosting, we thought these cookies weren't very flavorful.  Once the frosting was added, they were okay.  Probably won't make this one again :(

Agree with the reviewers who said this cookie is not sweet enough.  I could taste the flour and even royal icing + colored sugar did not make up for the bland cookie.  While the cookies were not crispy, they also were not very chewy...more of a dry but soft texture.  They did roll very well, even after only 30 minutes in the fridge.  If you are looking for a cookie that is not too sweet, this will work for you.

makes a very nice dough! easy=peasy to roll out with kids. Would have liked them to have a tad more flavor- but I guess thats what frosting is for, right? Thank you for this "keeper".

What an agreeable dough! It's like rolling out play-doh. Mine was well-chilled and softened to a good consistency as I worked with it. If you don't have any heavy cream, melt 1 1/3 tablespoon of butter and mix with milk, filled 3/4 of the way up your quarter cup. You may need to heat it slightly to re-melt the butter after adding cold milk to it. I also added some almond to this recipe out of personal preference. Baking them on an airbake makes them cook up completely without even turning slightly brown.

Very, very good sugar cookies. Stayed nice and soft even after they were frosted. Took to work - they sure didn't last long - and everyone wanted the receipe!! I took the advice of one review about rolling out in between parchment paper - that worked great and then baked them on parchment. This is definitely a keeper!!

My family has now voted this their favorite sugar cookie recipe, topping my Granny's treasured recipe. Not sure how I feel about that, but this recipe does yield a very workable dough and a soft, not-to-sweet cookie that is adaptable to a number of flavorings and spices. I added nutmeg to my dough, and it was perfect--it was not bland and was plenty sweet with or without icing. I rolled these a little thicker than 1/4 inch to make them nice & soft and frosted with Buttercream Frosting, from this site. Excellent recipe, Laura!

Didn't work for me.  I was excited to read all of the positive reviews for this recipe & thought this would be the recipe I was looking for. My cookies did not hold their shape well.  I used 4" cutters & made the cookies thicker than traditional cutouts.  I so wish it would've worked.  I guess I'll have to keep searching :-(

I was fairly surprised by all the positive reviews. I found these cookies to be very dry and they had hardly any taste. 

I'll be choosing a different recipe in the future.

THE BEST sugar cookie recipe!  They keep their shape EXACTLY how you cut them, does not stick to your baking surface (I used foil and they still just slide right off) AND it allows you to bake more cookies at once because you can basically stick them right next to eachother and not worry about expanding and sticking to eachother....will never use another recipe again!

These were great, all the good reviews were true.  Easy to make, easy to work, the least annoying cut out cookie dough I've encountered.  Agree with everyone that doubling the vanilla works

This sugar cookie held it's cookie cutter shape so nicely and it was a nice tender cookie, but I was disappointed in the lack of flavor. They were very bland even with icing. The texture, shape and ease of rolling, make it worth trying again, however, so I'm not casting this recipe aside just yet. I'm going to try them again with a little more sugar and see how they turn out.

I haven't made sugar cookies in years! This year, I wanted to make them for the neighborhood children. This recipe was perfect! I chilled the dough for 2 hours. It rolled out beautifully. The cookies tasted great....just the way children like them! My thinner ones were crisp, and the thicker ones were chewy. They're not too sweet, either. I may try a tiny bit of lemon extract next time. This recipe is a keeper!

These were very easy to work with, and not one broke. But they were very floury and felt unpleasant in the mouth. They'd be great for making with kids or hanging in a tree. Not so great if youér looking for a tasty cookie.

They held together beautifully when rolled out and when they baked they kept their shape.  Not too sweet, so when you added the buttercream frosting for decoration, the cookies didn't taste sicky sweet. Perfect recipe.

i love these cookies. i've used this recipe numerous times. i'm a preschool teacher and i used this recipe with my 5 year old students  and it was very easy to work with and roll out- never sticky!!! i also make this for my family for the holidays and use different cutouts for each holiday. i have to add that i HATE using butter because of the unhealthy fats that it has. i ended up using 1 cup of oil instead ( specifically smart balance omega oil) and it came out just as great as if i used butter. i also cant have dairy and i used non-dairy coffee creamer/whitener. i would definitely recommend this recipe!!!!

I agree that this is just about the best sugar cookie I have ever made.  I made them for Christmas and now I'm making them for Valentines Day.  The only thing I did different was to leave the dough in over night.

Excellent recipe.  Tip: Roll only small portions of  dough at a time, keeping the rest in the cooler.  Yummy flavor.  My favorite "Sugar Cookie Dough".  Everyone raved about the flavor and the tenderness.

NEVER TRY ANOTHER SUGAR COOKIE CUTOUT RECIPE AGAIN!!  I've read and read and experimented and thought I had finally found "my" scc recipe last Christmas...needless to say, I second guessed myself, read the reviews and tried this one immediately with the sugar cookie frosting.  I finally have found the perfect sugar cookie!  I live in Arizona and only had to chill the dough about 30 minutes and did double the vanilla amount.  I even added pure almond extract to one batch.  These were actually so much fun to roll and cut-out.  No difficulty batch after batch, excellent tasting, and most importantly these are still soft days later!  I did only cook them 12 minutes and would even try 11 minutes for small cut-outs.  I look so forward to my kids being old enough to help me with these during the holidays.  This is forever our sugar cookie recipe.

Thanks so much for the recipe, these cookies were excellent. This is the best recipe I have ever tried for cutout cookies. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only refridgerated the dough for about an hour because I was short on time. They turned out perfectly. I will continue to use this recipe whenever I make cutouts.

Excellent basic recipe for cut-out cookies that will be frosted or sprinkled. I suggest adding a little bit of salt to the recipe for extra flavor. Holds its shape well and melts in your mouth!

Wow! I am a professional Cake Decorator and cringe when clients ask for sugar cookies cause I have never found a receipe that meets my expectations, but this one is the BEST EVER! The cookies were perfect! Everything from texture to taste! I also really apprieciated the Review that gave their parchment idea... I rolled the dough out on the parchment like they suggested and it was so much eaier then moving the cookies, I didn't break 1 and thats a big deal for me! Thank you, thank you!!

Very good sugar cookie.  Kind of plain, but I mean that in a good way.  It was a very sturdy sugar cookie...perfect for making cutouts with two year old twins!  We didn't end up with any broken cookies, which is something of a miracle!  Thanks for the recipe!

i loved working with this recipe, it was so easy and the cookies tasted great.  i would cut the baking powder in 1/2 becuase it did leave a slight taste.  i also rolled the dough 1" thick and cut the baking time by 2 minutes.  i made homemade buttercream frosting; they were a hit.

Yummy! Prior to cooking, I brushed with egg whites and allowed my children to decorate with sprinkles and decorating sugars of all sorts. The dough is easy to roll and taste just great. Thank you for sharing! I will use this over and over again.

Thanks Laura for a great recipie.  Easy to work with great taste.  I do a lot of baking and this is a keeper.  Adding 1/2 t. almond extract also enhances the flavor.  Barby1

Very nice dough to work with and the cookies were so good at Christmas that we're making them again for Valentine's Day! Made a great thick cookie that's easy for kids to decorate. Not only did they disappear quickly, I got requests for more!

They stuck like glue to the racks and the ones that didn't, broke apart.  In pieces, they tasted good though.

I completely agree with MAMASHAKE in that I hate sugar cookies because they're always so sticky and finicky, and I have tried several of the more popular recipes on this site without much success. Because of her review, I tried this one and was not disappointed. I find this recipe 10000 times easier to work with than other sugar cookies, while still tasting great. Thanks GLJCAT!

I have never submited a review before but these cookies are absolutely amazing.  With frosting or as is - this is definatly a family favorite and one we will make over and over.  This is the easiest sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried.  We left the dough chilling overnight and it was perfect the next day.

These are great cookies!!!  It took a little more like 3 hours for the dough to be solid enough to make cutouts that didn't tear, but I just stuck the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes to finish up quicker.  These cookies are so soft and tasty!!

so, tried to make this with 3 kids ages 3 and under...wound up putting the dry and cream before the eggs and this my be why it turned out very dry. Many fell apart on the cookie sheet. I also found that putting sugar on before baking runs the risk of it being more sticky. Taste is decent. I also need to say that this is the first time I've made sugar cookies so perhaps chalk much of this up to inexperience.

This is the perfect recipe for frosted sugar cookies.  I think they are too bland to eat without frosting.  They're so easy and almost impossible to screw up!  I follow the recipe exactly.  No changes necessary.

Superb and easy cutout recipe!  I let the dough chill overnight and then split it into four sections, rolling out each section and leaving balance in refrigerator until ready.  Otherwise, dough will become too soft quickly and that is where others had problems.  I used very little flour to roll out on.  Cookies held their shape and are DELICIOUS.  Makes 5 doz.

This was a great recipe. A cute idea is to take smaller cookie cutters and cute out a shape into the cookie and fill it with mashed hard candy and bake it. The candy melts and provides a new texture and makes it even more cute!

This was a pretty good cookie recipe! I didn't have Heavy whipping cream so I used 5% cream. I did not over cook it- rather I undercooked it- 10 min. max so that the cookie would be a little soft. I did what someone suggested- rolled it out on parchment and then slide the paper on cookie sheet. I didnt get 6 dozen - I got about 3-1/2 dozen, if that. I also with held some of the doe rolled it like a log and plastic wrapped it and put it in the freezer for an hour- then sliced it and baked it and it turned out great! The cookie rose nicely and will be easy to frost it and decorate it. My 2 sons loved it! No need to buy them at the store!!

Loved this recipe. I chilled it for two hours and it was perfect for cookie cutters. I did tweak it and add a second teaspoon of vanilla. That made a difference and they came out delicious!!!

If I can do this, anyone can.  My only problem:  I roll the dough too thin.  Once I figured that out everything went great.  Started using my hands to pat the dough rather than my pin to roll it.  Guess I get too aggressive with that rolling pin!

Very disappointing! I made a patch for my easter cookies. Flavor was bland, and they puffed up with an unpleasant cakey texture. Could barely be rescued with creamcheese/coconut frosting.

I agree - rather dry.  I try to half a new recipe so I do not get a lot.  Easy to make, easy to roll.  cooked up fine.  But I agree with the other reviews - dry and kind of tasteless, even with a thick layer of crushed candy canes they had no flavor.

These are tasty cookies that are perfect for cookie cutters and decorating.  They are strong and won't break when you decorate them. But they aren't too hard!  Especially good when doing cookie decorating with kids who can be a little rough.  This is my go-to recipe from now on.

I've never had good luck with sugar cookies, but this is the best recipe ever. I followed it exactly and my cookies turned out awesome. I found that the thicker we cut them the better they turned out. Probably closer to 1/2 inch thick than 1/4 inch, but some of our cookie cutters had thin little legs and arms. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, we will use again and again!

Wow, I never really liked sugar cookies but these were delish and easy.  I thought they were more like shortbread than the sugar cookies my mom made.  I added the almond extract as someone suggested.  We didn't have the heavy whipping cream so used half and half.  Will make again but I need a good frosting recipe now!

Dough was easy to work with (I chilled dough overnight) and cut-outs kept their shape very well. However, cookies were very bland-tasting. I used a simple mix of powdered sugar, butter, milk and vanilla to make an icing that tasted well with the cookies. May make again with addition of more flavoring.

What a wonderful recipe!  The flavor is fantastic, the dough requires just a bit of tender care but the results are well worth keeping it cold while rolling out a batch.   Sprinkle with sugars before baking or decorate with your favorite frosting after they've cooled--my new favorite sugar cookie recipe!

This receipe works great for cookie cut-outs!  Making sure to refrigerate the dough for a couple hours before rolling ensures they aren't too sticky on the cutters.  I also add 1/2 tsp of almond extract for a great flavor to the cookies even if you don't frost them.  My only problem is if I make them too early before Christmas, my kids eat them all and I have to make more last minute! :o)

Very easy cookies to make.  Great texture and strength...a little weak on the flavor though (very bland). Next time I make these, I will add additional extracts and/or juice/flavoring.

OMG! This is the most wonderful sugar cookie recipe.  It was easy to make,cut out perfectly, and took about 12 minutes to cook. Everyone in my family loved them.  I am baking some to give out as gifts this Christmas for my neighbors and friends.  Loved them :)

Wonderful! I completely avoid baking, especially cut-out cookies. SO many bad experiences. I have tried many, many sugar cookie recipes in the past, all ended in frustration as I tossed the recipe in the trash. This year I promised my kids I'd bake again, and I went on a new recipe hunt. I found this recipe, poured over the reviews, and gave it a try with little hopes of changing my attitude. I was so happily surprised. This is, by far, the best roll-out sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. The dough seemed sticky as it came out of my mixer, but after chilling, it was the easiest dough I have ever worked with. It rolled like a dream from start to finish. I made two double batches. The first, I refrigerated overnight. The second, I refrigerated just a couple of hours. Both rolled out exactly the same and baked up the same. Just make sure they are chilled thoroughly. I separated the dough into smaller section and made the lumps of dough kind of flat after I wrapped them in plastic wrap. I laid them directly on the glass shelves in my refrigerator to chill. The dough needed little flouring and released from my plastic cutters wonderfully. The cookies taste great. I cut the cookies 1/4" as recommended, and I baked each sheet of cookies for exactly 12 minutes, just until the edges began to turn brown, and they were perfect. I decorated them with a sugar cookie glaze (also found on this site), sprinkles, and piping, and they taste even better. You won't be disappointed.

I've been searching for the Best cut-out cookie recipe for years, and I think I've found it.. Doubled the vanilla, as recommended by others, and added 1/2 t salt.  Only chilled 2 hours. Made half the recipe and was not standing there all night cutting out cookies.  Love that they're not too crisp, nor too chewy. Maybe perfect. ??

Made these sugar cookies yesterday for my daughters' Valentine's Day tea and they turned out great! I am not a fan of making cut out cookies normally because the dough is either too sticky or cracks or the shapes lose their shape, etc, but this dough erased all of those problems for me. It was an absolute breeze to work with, baked perfectly and held its shape beautifully. I am not sure why this dough came out sticky for some reviewers, because mine was only refrigerated for one hour and was not sticky at all. I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper, but honestly probably didn't even need to, and did not use one bit of flour or powdered sugar for rolling, because I just didn't need it. My cookies baked in about 10 minutes and came out firm but chewy not crunchy, if that makes any sense. lol I did make a couple of modifications: I used butter-flavored shortening in place of the butter, substituted half and half for the heavy whipping cream (because I didn't have any) and added 1 tsp of salt and some extra vanilla. I do not think any of those changes would have dramatically affected the way the dough turned out, though, so I am still giving the original recipe 5 stars. This is now my go-to for sugar cookie cut-outs. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this using my stand mixer, which worked out great! I baked them on the lower end of the suggested time, when they were just starting to brown around the edges. They turned out slightly crispy on the outside with a little fluff on the inside. My only regret was not doubling the recipe!

These were amazing! Really easy to make, and with just the right amount of sweetness. I added some cinnamon to boost the flavor. Didn't have any problem when rolling, even if I didn't wait for the full 3 hours for the dough to chill.

The best recipe I've found by far. Not overly sweet so that when you ice them you're not puckering over the insane sweetness in some cookies.  I make the dough the day before and wrap in wax paper in small work balls. When I'm ready to roll and cut the cookies I rotate between the balls of dough so I can reform the dough in the fridge quickly between batches.

These are the absolute best cutouts EVER!!!  They are so moist and soft, they melt in your mouth.  The texture reminds me of the Lofthouse sugar cookies. I added 2 tsp vanilla as others suggested and also 1/2 tsp salt.  They turn out perfect every time.  I have even made them after chilling in the fridge for only one hour.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!!

This is the best recipe I have found for cut-out cookies.  I doubled the vanilla based on what others had said, they've turned out lovely.  With the icing/decoration they will definitely be sweet enough.

I've been trying lots of different sugar cookie recipes to find a go-to recipe and although these were pretty good, I still haven't found my favorite yet.  It was lacking some flavor and sweetness.  On the plus side, the dough was easy to roll out and the cookies maintained their shape once cooked.  It was a little sticky for me because I was limited on time and couldn't refrigerate the required time but I floured the board well.  I might tweak this one to perfect the recipe to my liking.

Ok.  I left the dough, as suggeted in other reviews, in the fridge over night.  I did not find it easy to work with at all...maybe I had too much flour? The taste was 'ok' too.  Not really worth the effort.

I have been baking sugar cookies for most of my life and these are by far the best.  We even did a bake-off this year and in taste tests this cookie won.  I did add additional vanilla (total 1 tsp.) and a bit of almond extract (.5 tsp).

These cookies were defenetly not made to roll out and cut.  We tried doing them over several days first I think my Mom rolled the dough too thin making them very difficult to cut.  IN the baking process they spread out and lost there shape.

Followed the recipe exactly.. chilled for about 3 1/2 hours. This was my first time making cutout cookies and these were super easy! But I agree with others, they were pretty dry. I was so disappointed :( I found that baking them for 9-10 minutes instead of 12-14 helped a little. Not sure if I'd make these again unfortunately.

They sure tasted great, but the dough was killer to work with.  I made a double batch and ended up making half cut-outs and half "snowballs" haha.  I am thinking next time if I make the normal size batch it will be a lot easier to work with.

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever made.  I could taste the cream and that I think makes all the difference.  Very easy to work with, even working with two toddlers, whom inevitably handled the dough enough to make it very soft.  They cooked up perfectly, even with different sized cookie cutters, came clean off the pan with and without cooking spray (I forgot on the first batch and was a bit nervous), and were so delicious!  We sprinkled colored sugar on some and cinnamon sugar on others, and both were great!  I'll be making these for chrismas gifts this year for sure!  I made up a half batch, but I'll easily make a few batches again before the holidays.

This is a great recipe!  However, I had to tweek it a bit.  I realized that the dough is super sticky- so I only take out of the refrigerator 1/4 of it at a time, I have to use a pastry cloth and a rolling pin cover.  I also increased the baking powder to 1 Tablespoon.

FULFILLED MY SUGAR COOKIE CRAVINGS! 12 weeks pregnant, and suddenly craving those sugar cookies with icing that you see around the holidays, I set out to find a recipe that would satisfy my hungers. THIS IS IT! Better than the store bought stuff, and absolutely the most perfect consistency you could imagine let alone TASTE, this is the best sugar cookie I've ever had...I used the recipe  "Sugar Cookie Icing" also posted on this website, and together, they are a match made in heaven (just make sure to use vanilla extract instead of almond if you do that icing). I'M GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER 3 DOZEN TOMORROW!!

This was an excellent cookie recipe! We made ours a few days ahead of time, and the dough was too stiff and cold to work with, so we let it sit out for about 30 minutes. Then it rolled out beautifully! And they tasted delicious, even without frosting.

These are THE best. I've made them a number of times, and the only alteration is extra vanilla. I use the 'Sugar Cookie Frosting' (tinted pale pink) to ice the cookies and then sprinkle them with colored sugar. My girls love the 'sparkly' effect.

I have never had so much success with a sugar cookie recipe!  I rolled out the cookies to about 1/4 inch, but even those that were rolled out a bit thinner didn't break.  They were very easy to decorate and were gobbled up at a 4 year old's birthday party.  The cookies didn't even break after being handled by a bunch of pre-schoolers!  I added 1/4 tsp of salt and a little extra vanilla as suggested by others.  This isn't a very sweet cookie, so it can easily handle the sweetness of the frosting.  I was able to make 30 cookies that were 3 inches by 2 inches.

This recipe was great for cutouts.  None of my cookies broke, but I thought the recipe could use some salt.  This is the second time I've ever made cookies without salt, and I'll never do it again.

I TOOK THE ADVISE FROM ONE OF THE REVIEWS AND USED 2 TEASPOONS OF PURE VANILLA. COOKIES TURNED OUT EXCELLENT BUT NEEDED SALT. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD 1/2 TEASPOON OF SALT THEN THEY SHOULD TURN OUT 100% PERFECT. GREAT RECIPE, THANKS FOR SHARING IT.4 STARS ONLY BECASUE THE RECIPE NEEDS A LITTLE SALT.

I have tried a few recipes this holiday season and this is the best one. I'm sticking with this one. The only problem I found was that my first batch burned a little, but I think that might be my oven. I knocked the temp down to 325 and took off 2 minutes of time and the second round in the oven was perfect. Sadly, one elf cookie lost an arm while disembarking from the pan and had to be sacrificed to my tummy while still warm. :) Yummy!

I've only given this 3 stars but it isnt a reflection on the recipe more on my ability to make it work. These spead all over the place and lost their shape completely even after chilling in the freezer my dough was too soft. They tasted great and still went down well. I will make this again but I will use more flour to make it a little stiffer. So again I was probably the reason it didnt hold like it should have done. Thank you for the great tasting recipe.

This was a very easy recipe and perfect for cutouts that are going to be iced.  Next time, though, I may add some lemon extract or lemon zest to make the flavor more interesting.  Will make again, definitely!

i found this recipe crumbly  and hard to roll out even after sitting 3 hrs in the frig to chill. It was terrible so i just rolled into balls flattened and baked this way . I was very disapointed.

We actually made two different recipes for sugar cookies and taste tested them.  This dough was very easy to work with.  However, the flavor was bland and the cookies were dry--not a pleasure to eat. We will not use this recipe again--definately not the winner.

I made these last night to freeze for Halloween. This was an outstanding cutout recipe! Chilling the dough made them easy to work with and the cookies came out incredible ~ nice and thick.  I added a little extra sugar which was suggested by another user ~ it worked well.  I will be making these for Christmas!!  I would frost these for extra sweetness.

Very easy to handle, even for my 5 yr old. Could've been a tad sweeter, tho, so they aren't absolutely perfect, but still, the easiest dough ever, so I'll probably make them again, with a little more sugar.

This cookie dough was easy to work with and held it's cut-out shape amazingly well (no spread out blobs) The taste was given rave reviews by family and friends who received them at Christmas!

This dough is super easy to work with, but the cookies' flavor is lack-luster, even when sprinkled with sugar, and a little on the floury side. I will still make these because the dough is so easy to work with and I want to ice the cookies with a flavored icing. Mine cooked up nice and soft and held their shape well. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the sheets. Finally, I was pleased that the yield was accurate--I got 75 cookies with various shapes of 3-inch cookie cutters.

Ok. I have to admit that I was a little sketchy after seeing the cream in this recipe. I decided to give it a go after having read some of the reviews and after several other recipes from this site turn into a total fail. I followed this recipe perfectly and the results are amazing! They are soft but still hard enough to frost, they have a nice texture on the top after they are baked, and my favorite part is that they actually taste great too! Usually I feel like a good cut out sugar cookie lacks in the flavor department, but these definitely do NOT disappoint! Happy to share these with friends and neighbors on our Christmas goodie plates!!

Reliable basic recipe. I did add 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to add some flavor. I also used 1/2 cup less flour so it wasn't as flaky when rolling. Simple and easy to use for any occasion! My Maple Leaf cookies for Canada Day turned out great!

Just made and iced these cookies.  What a great cutout recipe. I only left it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and it was good to go!  I did follow other suggestions of adding more sugar and cutting down the flour.  No cracks, nice and evenly puffed and no spreading while baking. Very pleased with the results and will definitely use again.

Dough was very easy to work with. However, I felt the cookies themselves looked perfect once baked, but tasted a little dry. More like a shortbread than a cookie to me.

These were very yummy and worked quite well for cutouts after being chilled.  
Here is an idea for those that want to decorate with/for kids, but don't want to use frosting.  You can use food coloring put into an egg yolk wash.  For two eggs, separate the egg yolk, mix it up, and split it into two small containers (small coffee cups), so that you have 4 containers.  Add food coloring and paint the cookies with a brush before you cook them.  It is still fun for the kids and does not have quite so much sugar.

Awesome recipe. I didn't crack a single cookie!! I took the advice of several other reviewers and made it a little thicker and used real vanilla.. amazing.. coming from a working mom who has no time, it was easy to put together, chill overnight, then roll out. it made over 40 cookies for my daughters class. i did top it off with cookie frosting (also from this site) and added some decorations for the visual stimulation of 7 year olds but the cookie on its own is great!!

This is the first sugar cookie recipe I have found that kept it's shape while baking. Made exactly as per recipe.  Not too sweet before they're iced, but perfect with sugar sprinkles or icing.

This is now my go-to recipe for cutout cookies. I have made these twice in the last couple months, once for a big birthday party and another time for a wedding. Each time I made four batches. Even though I usually hate the fuss of rolling out dough, this recipe makes it a breeze. One of the keys is to refrigerate the dough for at least an hour or overnight. Each batch yields about three dozen cutouts. For beautiful and easy frosting, I mix powdered sugar with a little milk and food coloring until I get the right consistency. Then I dunk the tops of the cookies in, and let drip-dry on wire cookie racks. Many people have asked me for the recipe. Thank you!!

I'm wanting to start my own cookie business so I tried this recipe.  The texture is soft, but firm enough to work with.  The flavor is very yummy. I followed the recipe, but added 1/4 sugar and doubled the vanilla.  My children AND husband really liked them!

Third time making these wonderfully easy sugar cookies.  This time I added a little lemon juice.  Yum. Make the cutest cutouts.  I always make cookie bouquets for grandchildren and nephews and they look forward to them.  Thanks a bunch!

I'm terrible with cookies, but these were absolutely perfect.  The dough was easy to put together and rolled out and cut beautifully.  Even in my wonky oven they cooked right at 14 minutes.  Easy peasy and I'll definitely make these again.

LOVE IT!  I have tried many sugar cookie recipes from this site just within the last few days - this one is the easiest by far for managing cutout cookies.  I didn't have one break (and there were some delicate ones - a cowboy boot with a spur).  I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, refrigerated the dough for about 35 minutes before working with it.  While rolling the dough, I sprinkled sugar on top of wax paper and also on top of the dough while I was rolling with a floured rolling pin.  These cookies are not super sweet, which is why I give them a little boost with the extra sugar while rolling them out.  This will be my go-to sugar cookie recipe from now on.  I have always hated baking sugar cookies because of the constant struggle with the dough consistency.  These were GREAT!  Thank You!

These are very, very good cookies--if you add either more vanilla, or in my case, I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  The cookies are very moist and cake-like.  And they were easy to roll out.

I didn't have cream, so I substituted evaporated milk and it worked great.  My favorite thing about the cookies is that they stay soft.  I don't like crunchy sugar cookies and these stay soft and cake-like.  Not quite as much flavor as I would prefer, so next time I may add almond flavoring or more vanilla.  Great recipe!

This is a great cutouts recipe.  The dough was not too sticky, and the cookies kept their shape while baking.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the amount of vanilla, and I'm glad I did.  This is not a sweet cookie - probably why some reviewers did not like the taste.  But I prefer this type of cookie, since I almost always add icing or decorative sugar, and sometimes the level of sweetness can get out of control.  I will make these over and over again.

These are the best sugar cookies ever! I made mine a little thicker than 1/4 inch and underbaked them slightly (just till firm when touched, not brown at all) and let them sit on the pan for a few minutes and they were super soft and chewy and froze very well, really yummy right out of the freezer. I'll never make another suger cookie recipe again!

This is a great recipe because every batch was consistently perfect in appearance.  The cookies came out of the oven almost exactly like the shape of the cookie cutters used and they did not burn or spread like past recipes I have tried. The chill time was short and not much extra flour was needed for rolling them. In my opinion the flavor was somewhat bland.  Frosting of course changes this and all in all it's a great recipe that I will use again. I couldn't eat these plain though.

Best sugar cookie I have ever made. I made them for a Ladies Christmas dinner, and everyone raved. They even asked for the recipe....could not be easier; just go the Allrecipes..

Yummmmmmyyyyyyyy !!!!  These cookies are awesome, the first batch I made they were good but could have used a little more of a sugar taste so I made my 2nd batch using 1 1/2 cups sugar & much much much better.  These are definitely staying in my recipe book.

I don't get the reviews on this, the dough was hard to work with, the cookies bloated when baked, and they didn't taste good. They tasted kindof eggy.   I bake a lot, but can not find a good sugar cookie recipe. I'll keep looking...

A great basic recipe.  I didn't understand the random addition of the heavy cream, but I just skipped that ingredient.( I assume it was going to be for a frosting)  I did add  twice the vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of salt. Salt is always a good idea in sweets because it rounds the flavors and make it more than just sweet.  If you don't have the counter space to roll out your cookies, you can do what I did. Shape your dough into a cylinder, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and hang in your fridge. The you can cut coins and have round cookies ready. This method is not for those who want to use cutters.

This recipe was good-with a few tweaks. The first time i made these-the dough was sticky no matter what i did, and the flavor was lacking. The second time i made them, they turned out great because of what i did differently. I a.) used more sugar and a couple dashes of cinnamon, b.) refrigerated them overnight, and c.) cut down my baking time (on my oven) to 10 minutes. My family loved this recipe, and i would make them again. Overall, this is a good staple recipe to build on for cookies.

I am so very happy with this recipe.  I am just learning how to bake and this recipe was fool proof.  The dough was a little sticky before I refrigerated it, which concerned me (like I said i'm learning).   After chilling it the dough was great and not at all sticky.  It rolled beautifully and the cut outs were easy to transfer to the baking tray.  I did have to cut the time in my oven to nine minutes, so watch your cookies.

I have tried many sugar cookie recipes and this one by far was the easiest to roll out and cut and the cookies have great flavor.  I do all the baking for 2 families at Christmas time and sugar cookies by far were my least favorite to do, but these turned out great!

These cookies were pretty good....but I do think they need a little more flavor. I think a little almond or more vanilla extract would be awesome. They did keep their shape very very well and I was extremely happy with that!

These turned out perfectly, I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I used coffee cream (18% mf) instead of heavy cream (it was what I had on hand) I did not take the time to chill the dough, but it rolled out very well and I had no problems transferring the cutouts to the pan.  My 7 year old daughter helped me to make these and she had a great time.  I took the butter out of the fridge several hours earlier and it was soft enough to spread easily on bread.  thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first experience with Sugar Cookies, and it was fantastic! The recipe was very easy. I refrigerated the dough overnight, and didn't have any problems with them being sticky. They came right up off the pan after baking and not a single one broke! My kids had a blast frosting them and they tasted great. I'm making more today to give out as holiday gifts.

Good cookies. For some reason (even after overnight refridgeration) my dough was a very very pliable. I was able to make the cutouts but once I picked them up, the kind of stretched a bit. Added a bit more flower on rolling the dough and still stretched a bit when i picked them up. Also I followed the other reviewer's instructions and made it 1/4 inch thick and took them out as soon as it browned on the bottom edges. But I think I should have made them a bit thinner and cooked it a bit more. I was expecting a crunchy cookie, but it ended up rising a bit too much and being a bit more soft (biscuit-like). Next time I'd add a bit more flour and make them a bit more thinner. Good basic sugar cookie though. Added with the sugar cookie frosting and tasted good without being too sweet.

These didn't taste good without frosting, but paired with "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting" they tasted just like those commercial sugar cookies that they load with frosting. Very delicious.

Really a delightful sugar cookie; not too sweet, and so tender.  I used an organic butter and the buttery taste shown through brilliantly.  Even after several days in a covered tin, the cookie is still tender and flavorful.  I didn't have time to cut them out; I just rolled into a log, refrigerated, and then cut into slices.  Dough spreads, so bear that in mind.  Doesn't need any kind of icing, though the next time I make these, I'm thinking a simple icing with a touch of lemon in it.  These cookies received rave reviews from all who tried them!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe is so great. In an effort to take the advice of others to not make the dough too thin, I think I actually made it too thick, but they still tasted amazing! I love how easy to handle the dough was....just the perfect consistency.

This recipe was incredible.  I did decrease the cooking time to 8 minutes and it came out perfect.  I used homemade buttercream to decorate them, but they were great even without the frosting.  My daughter got a kick out of making cut out cookies for Santa this year.  Definitely a keeper!!

I made this recipe for a bake sale-  They were very easy to make, I even dyed a batch pink.  My only grief is that they have a (mandatory glass of milk) texture to them.  Sort of dry and could be a little sweeter. 

Any ideas other than frosting them?  I need to mass produce and I'm fairly lazy

These cookies are awesome! Very quick to make and the dough is smooth and incredibly easy to work with, no breaking or tearing when using cookie cutters. After they are baked they are wonderfully textured and taste great! I iced them with some Royal Icing and put sprinkles on them too, fabulous!

This recipe is excellent.  I have used it several times to create wonderful holiday creations.  The recipe is simple, I add a little bit of lemon and it turns out so yummy!

Very good basic Sugar Cookie recipe following the directions as written.  And you're right, Laura!  Good even without the frosting.  I had to make an additional batch because my family ate the first before I could frost them for the Valentine's Day celebration.  :)

Update:  for those that may not have or afford 1 cup of butter - you can substitue 1 cup + 2 Tbsp of water for the butter.  Just beat the shortening and water together before you beat with the sugar.   The taste of this fine cookie is still there!

I'm sorry to say that I just baked these cookies today, and they did not turn out as good as I'd hoped they would.  They were pretty dry (I kind of choked on some crumbs after taking a small bite) and they tasted pretty plain.  I might try it again, but only after I try the other sugar cookie recipes on this site to see which one is the best. Thanks for the recipe anyway!

the dough was extremely dry and crumbly...which made for a really dry cookie.  but the cookies did keep their shape and tasted surprisingly good the next day!

I have never made sugar cookies before, but found these dry and hard to work with when cold.  I think I'll try making them again without refrigerating.

Made these for our exchange student/foreign son’s play. I followed recipe except used 1 tablespoon Watkins double strength real vanilla. Best & easiest sugar cookie recipe ever! Rolled out super easy after 3 hours chilling. Had no issues rerolling scraps! Baked up to perfection & did not lose a single cookie after baking! These cookies got rave reviews from hubby, son & a school friend’s dad! This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

When I made these cookies, I added everything according to the recipe, and by another reviewer's suggestion, doubled the vanilla, and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. They came out of the oven really puffed up. Their texture is more cake-ish than a cookie consistency which wasn't what I was expecting. If you're looking for a crunchy cookie, make sure you add less baking powder, or use a different recipe. Also, it wasn't very sweet, like barely sweet at all. Not nearly enough for a sugar cookie. Next time if I make it, I'll add 1 1/4 cups of sugar.

This dough is easy to roll. Good plain, decorated with granulated sugar, or iced. Easy to roll thin for crispy cookies or thicker for chewy cookies. My go-to recipe for sugar cookies!

I made these twice for Christmas and everyone loved them.  The dough was easy to roll out, I personally like these cookies rolled out thin and they come out a little crispy.  These also freeze well.  For those that like anise flavored cutout cookies (my husband's family is Polish), substitute 1 1/4 tsp. of anise extract for the vanilla.

This is the best cut out cookie recipe I’ve tried. The cookies held their shape when cutting and don’t puff up and lose their shape. The cookies aren’t sweet, which I like because we put fronting and sprinkles on top which is sweet enough. My cookies baked perfectly at 350 for 11 1/2 minutes.

I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly and got great results.  I found the dough very easy to work with and about as flavorful as any sugar cookie recipe.  The cookies do not brown at all when done, so watch them carefully.  You could turn the oven down to 325 for a larger margin of error.   I did a couple of thinner batches and a couple of  thicker batches, both were good.  These were softer cookies, a little more cake-like than most I've made.  I plan on keeping this recipe but doubling the vanilla and chilling the dough for longer than an hour.

1st time ever making cookies! I’m used to bake cakes but never cookies. So I changed the heavy whipping cream for milk ( heavy whipping cream is expensive in my country), the same amount that it was called. And I only used 3 1/2 cups of flour.  It is a grrreat recipe. Thanks a lot!

I wasn't crazy about these. The cookies were not sweet or soft/moist at all. Thankfully we planned on icing them so that should give them the sweetness they need. For some reason the dough came out a little crumbly/coarse. I had to spend extra time working the dough to overcome that. I even mostly melted my butter like another reviewer suggested but I don't think it would have made a difference. Ultimately I had a beautiful looking dry and bland tasting cookie.

This is the best  dough I have made.  Easy to work with and holds it shape when baked.  I did add extra vanilla  and almond extract for more flavor after reading reviews.   I have always made sugar cookies with my grandaughters and never was happy with the dough.  This year I feel that my effort has paid off.  The cookies are great.  Thank you and Merry Christmas

I haven't rolled and cut cookies in years because I was simply terrified.  These were SO EASY!  I followed the recipe exactly, didn't have heavy whipping cream, panicked, found a recipe to make myself,  and the dough turned out perfect.  I did chill overnight just to be on the safe side.  Rolled on parchment paper using flour w/some powdered sugar mixed in.  I did find rolling out thicker than 1/4 inch worked out much better.  The flavor is a perfect match for my sweet royal icing recipe.
Thank you!

Okay, two teaspoons vanilla and I threw in an extra yolk (because of someone else's recipe - not sure that made a difference) but these turned out GREAT!   Followed recipe closely.  chilled dough etc.  let chilled dough rest on bread board an hour before attempting to roll out.  No one ever says that!  Cold dough just won't roll out easily.
Anyway, 350 degrees, 12 minutes.  Whaaaa Laaaa!  Nice!
Oooh, frosted with a powdered sugar +  milk glaze with a couple drops of vanilla and orange flavor added.  So good!

The cookie itself tasted very good and had a great texture to it! I put my cutouts on parchment paper on top of the cookie sheet and in the freezer for about 15 minutes prior to baking. They held their shape very nicely. My only complaint/warning is that these cookies double their height/thickness while baking. In many cases this would be just fine. However, I used this recipe for stackable or "pinata cookies." One cookie requires 2 thinner cutouts and 1 thicker cutout with the middle carved out of it. You then "glue" the thicker cookie with the middle carved out to 1 piece of the whole thinner cookie, fill the middle with sprinkles, then "glue" the 2nd thinner cookie on top. I rolled them to them to the thickness I wanted and was taken aback at how much taller they had become during baking! Therefore, after all of my assembling, I had very tall stacked cookies, lol. This was my first time making them and they were for the kiddos, so I had no complaints! I would just roll them a little thinner in the future! Overall, very good recipe!

This recipe is super easy for kids to work with!  I made this recipe with 4 kids ages 6 to 9.  I also rolled out some myself.  One set of kids used gluten free baking mix and the other used the regular all purpose flour.  These were great!  It didn't seem to matter how long the kids worked the dough.  All of the cookies seemed to turn out well.  I chilled the dough for just over an hour-  1/3 of each batch went to each child.  My favorite bunch was the cookie sheet baked on the top rack ... they were slightly more crispy than the others.

This is a great cookie recipe. The only thing to remember is to make the dough ahead of time, wrap it up, and let it sit in the fridge for more than an hour. Overnight is the best. Not a good last minute idea. I made these for a party, but I started after they had gotten here, and trying to roll out my dough was a disaster, because it was so wet. Also, don't add excessive flour when rolling out the dough. The flour flavor will come across in the cookie. great recipe overall though!

I'll keep looking.   Tasty, but puffed up too thick.  A good cookie but maybe just for frosting and not conducive to semi-detailed decorating that I intend to do.   1/4-inch thick was too thick after cooking, for me.   I doubled vanilla, added 1/2 tsp almond extract, and subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for white in the mixing.   I used powdered sugar to roll out.

I used half and half instead of heavy cream, added a tsp of almond extract and chilled the dough about 1 hour.  They rolled out like a dream.  I baked them between 10-11 minutes and iced them with royal icing.  I will make these again and again. They're delicious!

I will make this again.  However, I took others advice and doubled the flavoring, added a bit  more sugar w/half of it powdered,  added a bit of cr. of tartar,  and half of the baking powder listed.
Dough was great to handle.  It's important that the dough is rolled out to the same depth for a good even bake!

It was extremely dry and wouldn't stick together.  It  crumbled as I was wrapping it up to refridgerate.  Let it "set" for over an hour  and it still fell apart.  Was going to put it in a cookie press but all it did was compress it so it wouldn't come out of the cutter.  Tried using a knife to just make round cookies but the dough just fell apart.  There was also no taste what-so-ever. Won't use this one again.

I love how easy this dough is to work with. It's very easy to roll, cut and move to baking sheets without losing it's shape. I will most likely use it again but I have to find some way of adding more flavor to the dough. The cookie, as-is, has no real flavor at all. Maybe more vanilla or some spices in the dough would help? Icing and decorating sugar makes them better and it is an easy dough to work with so thank you!!

Cookies tasted great and the dough was easy to roll out two or three times.    I used powdered sugar instead of flour for dusting before rolling and cutting out.  Cookies didn't break.   Thank you

First time making sugar cookies and I was nervous because people write about how tricky they are. Well, these were super easy and turned out so cute and tasty! Only change was to add 2 teaspoons of Pure Vanilla instead of one per another raters recommendation. Happy Halloween!

Never tried making sugar cookies from scratch before this. Very easy to roll out the dough. Cookies tasted light and were firm enough to decorate. No need for me to find another sugar cookie recipe.

I cannot believe how nice these cookies roll out. I made exactly as stated except I added I extra tsp of vanilla. I had them in fridge for about 5 hours before I rolled them. I rolled them on lightly floured parchment paper and  baked them for exactly 12 minutes. These will be my Christmas cutouts from now on but I will add anise during that holiday.

This produced a dry and crumbly cookie with bland flavour even after I increased the vanilla and reduced the flour. Thank-you for submitting the recipe, but I will not use this again.

This cookie is not as sweet as many other sugar cookie recipes...which made the cookie popular with some folks, but not so much those with a real sweet tooth.  I liked them, though.  The dough definitely needed to chill for at least 2 hours to be able to roll it out without sticking.  I also followed the hint from another reviewer about rolling out on parchment paper, removing the excess, and then putting the whole sheet of parchment with cookies on the pan to bake...this was a GREAT tip for keeping the cookies' shape.

Before I was even done mixing this dough I knew it was going to be fabulous. Smooth, easy to roll, and smells divine. This recipe puts the fun back into cookie making. Cooks up quick with no rising so cookies stay true to form. This would be the perfect dough for 3D cookies. Not too sweet, they are perfect for frosting.

Perfection!  I added 2 tsp of vanilla, per the other reviewers suggestions.  These dough was the perfect consistency for rolling and cutting.  I let the dough chill in the fridge for 2 hours and then took it out of the fridge about 5 minutes before I was ready to roll.  I also put the pan of cutouts in the freezer to chill for about 3-5 minutes to help them retain their shape.  Great flavor and perfect for decorating!

I have tried a few different recipes from this site and have had to tinker with them all. I will say that this one, was the easiest to work with after chilling over night. I feel that it is very bland by itself and the cookie from this recipe must be frosted. But I overall enjoyed the cookie.

Loved this recipe!! I reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp and increased the pure vanilla extract to 2 tsps. I also increased the sugar to 1 1/12 cups. That made the cookies have great flavor even without frosting and have just the right amount of softness. I also chilled for 8 hours in the fridge in 3 separate balls. You may want to even let them chill over night. Other than the chill time, the cookies were amazing! This is my new go to sugar cookie cut out recipe! My 6 year old loved making these and eating them too!

I actually really loved this recipe! They tasted good, and the texture was decent. I even made them gluten free and they turned out fantastic! I was thrilled when they didn't crumble when decorated. They frosted quiet nicely.

This dough is excellent for cut outs. The cookies keep their shape and size while baking. For that I would give the recipe 5 stars. But the flavor was a little lacking. And they were very dry.

I refrigerated the dough overnight like other suggested.  It was very easy to work with.  The flavor and texture of the cookies is very good but they do need icing.  I baked the first batch for 12 minutes and they were too crispy so the next bath I baked only 6 minutes and they were perfect.  My tip is if you are using dark non stick pans to either lower the temp by 25 degrees or bake for a shorter time.  You can get crisp cookies if you roll the dough out thinner and more substantial cookies if you roll our a little thicker,  I would make these over and over.

OMG!!!!!! These are the B E S T!!!  Normally I hate, with a passion, to make sugar cookies...but this recipe is so easy and cut wonderfully.  Usually the dough falls apart on me between rolling and the cookie sheet, but these stayed solid all the way.  I did chill them overnight, so the dough was good and firm.  Rolled them to a 1/4 inch like it said with no problem what so ever.  Sprinkled with the colored sugar and off to the oven they go.  Made balloons (which, yes are probably the easiest...but remember my first statement) for my son's housewarming party, so will be outlining with some royal type frosting for a little more festive look.  And yes we did try a couple to make sure all was good...and Yes...Yummmmmy!!!

I added extra vanilla after reading the reviews and it turn out to be quite ok. I rated it 4 stars because it was easy to roll out and doesnt stick to the rolling pin. My hubby and kids loved the cookies. Taste wise I find it slightly on the bland side but I guess since these are going with icing on top, the recipe works fine. Will make these again.

I really wanted this recipe to work. It seemed to have gotten enough good reviews to give it a try.  I am so sorry I did.  I was not able to roll this dough to save my life. No matter what I did to it I couldn't get it to work. I ended up just rolling it into balls and flattening it with a fork. One positive thing, though, is that by adding the extra vanilla and cinnamon they tasted good.

Easy to make and dough was great to work with.  However, the cookies were bland and needed more flavor, even after decorated.  I will make again but will try adding more flavor such as almond extract or more vanilla.

I love this site but have to admit that I have never wrote a review.  This recipe forced me to come out of hiding.  After much time, energy and ingredients, I tried this recipe and have to say that you are better off buying store bought dough.  Very disappointed.   They were cakey and flavorless.  I tried rescuing them with frosting and opted to toss the cookie and eat the frosting instead.  I was looking for a recipe that could possibly replicate store bought Pillsbury ready made dough, but this is definitely no cousin.  Not even related but merely the red headed step child of cookies.  I love baking and do quite well as my mom owned a bakery for over 16 years where I helped.  I know your flour would beg you to please make it into something else.

This recipe is awesome!  The dough was really easy to work with.  The cookies are very tastey.  If I had to make one suggestion, I'd say to add like 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of butter extract, as well  as the vanilla. I'll be using this recipe again, for sure!!

Good and easy recipe. Turned out just like I remember when I was young. The only downfall is they needed to stay thick or they lost shape when you go to cut them out with your cookie cutter. I also kept needing to add alot of flour when rolling and cutting, they were a tad to sticky.

HUGE HIT! I made them last Christmas and made my own frosting for them. It made a mice big batch, but my guests still wanted more! They told me they want that to be the new Christmas tradition! I chose 4 different cookies from this site, and I was lucky that they were all wonderful!
Thank you so much!

Great taste and had no problem cutting the cookies out.  Usually I give up and 
vow never to make cutouts again.  With this recipe, I will make them again and again.  Thanks Laura!

These cookies turned out great!  My mom and I used a few different sugar cookie recipes today, to see which one was the best, and this one was the best!  It's the perfect cookie for icing!  The best tasting "roll out sugar cookie" I've had, we will make these again for Christmas!

We made these and they were the best dough to use for cookie cutters. It was much better than the store bought dough! I also liked that the taste was not over powering with sugar. Good taste and a nice crispiness to it! We will definitely make these again!!!
