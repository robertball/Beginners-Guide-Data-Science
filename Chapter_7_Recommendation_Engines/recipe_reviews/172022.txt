incredible!!! the only thing i did different was use dijon mustard instead of honey mustard. my husband said that he didn't think that he could have anything as good as this sauce in a fancy restaurant. i will be making this recipe for years to come.

This is hands-down the best main entree I have ever made. It is my new standard for serving to guests. Moist, flavorful and elegant, but easy to make and hard to get wrong.

The pork was tender, flavorfull and looked beautiful with the almond crust when sliced.  Maybe I did something wrong, but the chunky white sliced apple sauce did nothing for the looks.  The onion and apple flavors cancelled each other and the rosemary out. It was bland.  Will fix the tenderloin again, but not the sauce.

made as written. asked the hubby what he thought. He didn't like the apples or the sauce, but the pork was good....then he said, but I didn't like the crust on the pork..so next time you can take that off...in other words, he liked the pork only, and nothing else. i thought it was ok, but not real great. sorry, won't be making this again.

This was excellent.  Even the grandkids liked it - especially the apples!  I forgot to get heavy cream so I mixed milk with flour - it was still good but next time I will use the heavy cream.

My family loved this!  My husband is not a huge fan of pork, but this he loved.  I used basil instead of rosemary, because I prefer the flavor.  I did not make the sauce; I had a cranberry-orange relish on hand, and that worked really well with it.

Thanks for sharing a greast recipe. I didn't have any apples in the house, so I couldn't try the sauce recommended, but it still turned out well, and I enjoyed it. I endd up making another type of Rosemary sauce using the juices from the pan. I couldn't give it a five only because I used the calculator to adjust the serving size, and I ended up with too much of the almond mixture for the amount of meat I had. In any case, this recipe has great potential for modifications,and i'll definitely be trying it again; next time with the yummy sounding apple sauce!  I also cut up some zucchini, and coated them in bread crumbs, and stuffed the tenderloin with it.  I rubbed the extra almond mixture inside the pocket before stuffing it.  Yummy!

Very good.  I didn't have all the cream called for in the recipe so I used a cup of cream and and the rest I substituted half and half.  It still was very good, but I think it would have rated 5 stars with just cream.

Incredible! It looks great, it smells great and the taste matches.  Only downfall for me was that the sauce didn't really thicken up as much as I had hoped.  Makes a good leftover as well.

It was an easy recipe and DEEEE-Licious!  As recommended by other reviews, I subbed Dijon for honey mustard.  I also used half & half rather than heavy cream.  Crust turned out great!  I only had to bake the 2 pork tenderloins for ~45min.  Glad I set a time to check their temps! I skipped the sauce because didn't have apples on hand.  Sounds tasty tho!
