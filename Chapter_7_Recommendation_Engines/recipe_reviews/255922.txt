Excellent.  I followed recipe only omitting Cajun seasoning
because I didn't have any.  I see another reviewer used Old Bay
Seasoning.  I will use that when I make it again.

I used boneless thighs which I prefer to breasts; didn't have Cajun seasoning so subbed Old Bay, otherwise followed the recipe.  Was really good, tasted like Shake and Bake with more crunch.  The meat was tender and juicy, marinated overnight.  I had no problem pressing the coating on, was easy. I didn't have a rack but turned out fine; thighs only needed 25 minutes baking.  Too much poultry seasoning though.  Will make again with bone in thighs, less poultry seasoning and more BBQ sauce in the marinade.  Thanks for the recipe, made a great meal.

We really enjoyed this! The buttermilk made the chicken SO tender and perfect. My opinion is to ditch the poultry season and the garlic powder. It really doesn't need it and they get lost. The other thing is to lose the oil in your breadcrumb mixture too. I'm assuming that step is so that you're breadcrumb mixture will brown however that bit of oil makes it difficult for the breadcrumb mix to stick to the chicken. The buttermilk marinade is the perfect amount of moisture to get the breadcrumb mix to stick so all you really need to do is spray your coated chicken with some non-stick spray to get that browning affect. This was excellent, I was impressed, and this is one I will make again!

No Changes are necessary. I'm just experimenting with trying out different recipes. I will keep it for a family favorite or as a Church Potlatch staple. :)

After reading the reviews I also left out a few things. I did not add  the breadcrumbs, Italian dressing mix, or the Cajun seasoning. I soaked the chicken in lactose-free milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to make it buttermilk . I also left out the vegetable oil, it does not help the coating stick to the chicken actually does the opposite as another reviewer said. I used chicken legs, and they turned out very nice and tender, and had a nice crunch.
Thank you for the recipe.

Cooking time was waaay off. Planned to have dinner at 6, but the chicken wasn't done until 6:45. :/
