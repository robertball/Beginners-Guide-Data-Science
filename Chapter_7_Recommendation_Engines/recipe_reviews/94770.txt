Excellent pie.  Easy to make.  I used a deep dish frozen pie shell and had too much filling, so be careful not to over flow.  I also had to increase baking time to 55 minutes.  This pie sliced up nicely and tasted great.  I've already been asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe for my family and everyone thought it was really good. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that the custard overflowed the pie crust once it was in the oven and I had to put cookie sheet underneath it to catch all the overflow. So, a little messy but still good.

the end result was good, however the cooking time was longer than what the recipe called for---when i was pulling the pie out the oven, the center was still very much liquid and spilled...completely unexpected---definitely had to bake it longer.  overall, i enjoyed the pie...it's delicious :)

Would have given this a 5-star rating had I not modified it based on reading so many earlier reviews, but it is delicious!  I skipped the crust altogether and just sprayed a pan with Pam.  Then I baked it in a bath or pan of water for almost 60 minutes.  It turned out like a flan.  One reviewer thought that it lacked in flavor, so I added 2 tablespoons of dark rum as I had no bourbon or brandy on hand.  Thanks to the other experienced bakers out there for so many forewarnings for my consideration!

I made this just the way the recipe said to, and it was wonderful. I took it for Christmas dinner and received a ton of compliments. It tasted just like eggnog!

I wasnt thrilled with this pie. I am a HUGE egg nog fan and the pie turned out more like a sweet egg keish. It tasted fine but I knew that the only people that would like it would probably be my mom and I. I also cooked it for an hour and it still didnt have the right texture that I wanted. I ended up just throwing it away. This recipe may work for others it definatly sounded good to me but just didnt turn out in my favor. Also be sure that the people you are serving it to like egg nog. I may someday attempt it again just to see if it was something I did wrong or its just the recipe (I did fallow it exactly).

Great Recipe!  I used a 9.5 inch pie to avoid the run over that other reviewers complained of and sprinkled the pie with nutmeg prior to baking.  I also used a hand mixer to make sure that all of the ingredients were beaten together extremely smooth.  The pie was perfect. Next time I'll back it like a creme brulee in a waterbath without the crust.

I made this recipe of eggnog pie for a New Year's Day open house. I made 1 minor change---I added 1 1/2 tsp of rum flavoring. This pie was the hit of the party and was not difficult to make which made it a hit with me.

I made this pie for the first time for the Thanksgiving holiday. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. I used a 9 inch deep dish pie crust and baked it on a baking sheet. It took approximately an hour and not the time stated in the recipe. We really enjoyed it! The texture and the flavor were spot on. It was however, just a little too sweet for my tastebuds.

I found this recipe extremely bland. I added rum and nutmeg and it still came out very tasteless. Many of my party guests really enjoyed this pie, however I did not. Also it takes much longer to cook than 30 minutes; because of this I burnt my crust because I thought I would be able to make a buttery crust without the chance of it burning. In reality it had to stay in the over for about 50 minutes before setting, and by that time my crust had burnt.

I made this last night and everyone loved it.  I'm making it again today in a gluten free version for my husband who REALLY wanted it.  I just subbed rice flour in the crust and arrowroot(or cornstarch) for the flour.  It's true it does need to cook longer.

In my opinion, this was just ok. There was not a ton of flavor. It was better with whip cream but still not worth repeating. Also the cooking time for me was at least 75 min. I lost track after reseting the timer over and over. It took much longer than called for here. I did follow the directions exactly.

This is an easy recipe. Though I question the amount of sugar used. It taste good though! Everyone mentioned how it reminded them of a custard. Another thing to note: I cooked it for the 40 minutes it called for, and it was still liquid, so I would recommend another 25 minutes.

We found this pie to be too heavy and too sweet. I made as directed and I would reduce the sugar by half since the eggnog is sweet. I would also double the eggs to make it fluffier, more like a custard. I added nutmeg too.

This was an easy pie to make! Took it to a holiday party. Not too many raving comments. It was a pretty pie, tasted like eggnog and was easy! Great for a holiday party! Did have to leave it a bit longer than stated in the oven. I knew that according to the reviews so I put aluminum foil strips around the crust to keep it from darkening too much. It turned out fine with 12-15 extra minutes.

Amazing recipe and I loved the consistency. I used 1/2 a cup less sugar since the eggnog I used was sweet on itself.

This pie got rave reviews at Christmas. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup since eggnog was sweet. Used a premade Oreo crust and served the pie chilled. It was more of a light cheesecake than eggy pie

I had to increase baking time to almost 1 hour! My oven cooks faster too! I don’t understand how a recipe cooking time can be that “off” when baking? When I pulled it out at 35-40 min it was completely wiggly in the center. Now that it “set” and it’s very firm...I’m wondering if the directions should’ve told us that “pie should be firm” OR “pie should be loose in Center” when Done? We’ll see how it tastes tomorrow when we serve it for Xmas. I added a lil’ bit of coconut to the top before baking. Looks good.

Followed the recipe fairly closely.  Used salted butter, reduced sugar , poured into two premade 9” pie crusts. Grated some nutmeg on top.. Baked for 40 minutes. Served with very lightly sweetened whipped cream. Super quick and easy, well-received.

Loved this pie it was delicious, has a very nice egg nog flavor. I added a teaspoon of rum extract it gave good  flavor without real alcohol, definitly use a deep dish pan or 2 regular size pans. Takes longer to cook in the deep pie pan as everyone else explained, also Served it with whipped cream on the side.

Tried this recipe for Christmas 2016.  My husband (an eggnog lover) and I were both disappointed.  It was too sweet and too thick & grainy.  I think if I ever make another eggnog pie I will just use our favorite custard pie recipe and substitute 1/2 of the milk with eggnog.

This is so easy and wonderful.   Cooking time is more like an hour.  The top will be browned.  I added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the mix and then sprinkled on top before oven.  I beat the eggs before I mixed into flour and sugar.   I think people who had a struggle may have not beat the eggs enough.  I made my own butter pie crust and cooked on bottom rack.  custard firmed and crust was flaky.

EXCELLANT, use a 10 inch pie pan, check time, little longer cook time is normal, very much like Magnolia (buttermilk) pie but with eggnog. I used our favorite eggnog Southern Comfort Spiced Vanilla and I used the amount of vanilla the recipe called for. I didn't make any other changes. Currently trying in a hot water bath with no crust since the 5 year old doesn't care for crust. Family fav, one to print for the recipe box.

This pie has become a new holiday tradition at our house. The bake time is closer to an hour, but this recipe is perfect otherwise. I make no changes if using regular eggnog, but if you use "light" eggnog, just add a tiny bit more flour (maybe 1 Tbsp) to help it thicken up more during baking.

Yes, I made this for Thanksgiving.   Filling did overflow. Next time will use deep dish. also decrease vanilla if using flavored eggnog.

Even with 1/2 cup flour and 90 minutes baking, it is still runny in the middle. Very disappointed.

The taste is very nice however the cooking time for this recipe needs to be adjusted significantly! For the pie to set I had to cook it for approimately 35 - 40 minutes beyond what the instructions called for. I did make this with reduced fat eggnog and it still tasted rich.

This is a subtle custard pie that takes care of the carton of egg nog sitting in your fridge. (My family seriously hearts custard pies and isn't big on rum/bourbon.) I'll make this again next Christmas, but as others have said, the recommended baking time and temp are wildly optimistic. My underachieving oven took over an hour and I cranked up the heat to speed it along. I think 375 or even 400 is a more realistic baking temp. I also did a partial prebake on my crust, but ended up overdoing it, so might not do that next time.
