This is delicious!  We made the following changes:  We did not baste the chicken or cut it onto bite size pieces.  It was wonderful!  Not too sour at all.  It had just the right tartness to really add to the italian seasoning.  This is my new favorite!

I didn't have time to marinade this for the full hour - the chicken marinated for about 40 minutes - and it still turned out delicious. The ingredients are things I keep in the kitchen at all times, so this is a good last-minute dinner. I served it with couscous and salad.

I really liked this recipe, however I made some changes/additions for personal preferance.  I increased the lemon juice to 3/4cup, and added 3 minced garlic cloves to the marinade.  I marinaded it for a hour in the fridge, placed it on the broiler pan and added pepper to the seasoning.  Turned out fantastic.  Will make again.

This was too sour for my taste but my 14 year old loved it. Be careful with the hot water in the pan as it can slosh out when basting the chicken. I would add some honey to the sauce if I made it again.

Very tasty! The marinade didn't smell great at first but once it was in the oven it smelled really good. I did tweak it a little based on some other reviews and what I had on hand. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Quick and yummy!

Wow yum!  I only used lime juice and wow!  I used it in fajitas but it really should be eated alone, too good to be wrapped up with other flavors.

This was a nice quick and simple dish to make.  I only marinated the chicken for 20 minutes and I am glad I did because if I did it for longer I think it would come out too sour.

WOW. I cannot stress to you how much I love this recipe. My boyfriend and I practically make this every week. We use a whole bag of frozen chicken breasts (about 7-8 breasts) so we double the recipe and eat it all week long. We usually eat it with rice or quinoa and some vegetables. We like to put some of the marinade over our whole plate of food too! It can be sour and definitely has a kick, but it's still delicious!! I have told my mother about this recipe and she loves it as well.

I really enjoyed this chicken. I lemon-lime juice really gave it a kick. I mixed the italian season and season salt together with some parsley then sprinkled on both sides of the chicken. Be careful not to cut the chicken in to small of pieces because they will burn. I like this recipe so much I'm going to make it again tonite.

Made this last night and absolutely loved it! I tried sprinkling parmesan on top when it was done cooking and made it even better! The flavor of the marinade and Parmesan go well together.

The chicken came out OK, but the marinade was way too sour to make a good sauce out of.  It didn't have much flavor beyond sour, either.

I think this would have been great without my additions, which is why I'm giving it a 5 even though I modified. First, LOVE broiling chicken instead of baking. Gives it a different texture. Not as good as grilling but close! Not sure why the recipe calls for cutting up into pieces if you're going to broil. Weird. I didn't do that. Second, I made as directed with the addition of minced garlic and some hot pepper paste to the marinade. I did NOT find it too sour at all. It was wonderful! I made extra so that I could cut up the extra and use on salads for lunch.

This was very good, I followed the recipe with the exception of broiling, I grilled. Great flavor. My chicken also turned out very moist.

Fantastic!  I made this tonight, exactly as described, and it was phenomenal!  I don't have a wire rack, so I used a broiler pan and put water in the bottom of that and it worked well.  This dish is so versatile, I'm planning on using the leftover chicken in a cold pasta dish tomorrow night.  Thank you for a great recipe Marilyn!

Very nice, easy way to prepare chicken.  I can see how some might think that it was too sour, but neither I or my husband minded.  While it didn't knock our socks off and probably won't be made in my house regularly, we both liked it.

I did not make this recipe as stated, I pan fried it instead of broiling. The chicken was delicious and I have used it in a variety of ways since making it. This is a great recipe that can flavor your meat for Mexican, Italian and stir fry meal ideas.

Added water and cornstarch to marinade so sourness was decreased and sauce thickened. Cooked on stovetop.

A nice, tangy taste. I had to cut the marinading short, so next time I'll leave them in longer. I used olive oil and whole bone-in breasts, they came out great. The seasoning mostly washed off with the basting, so keep some out to re-apply before serving.

This combination of ingredients makes this absolutely delish!  So moist and juicy and flavorful!  

I grilled them on the bbq and they came out fantastic.  The whole family loved this!

Great for hot summer nights (except for the heat of the broiler).  Nice and light with a twang.  We will try this on the bbq next time to try and avoid some of the heat in the kitchen.

Great recipe!  Yes, itâ€™s tart but thatâ€™s the appeal.  If you donâ€™t like tart this recipe isnâ€™t for you. Served with a couple sauce options... Dill yogurt sauce and a homemade pico.

It's not really fair for me to rate this because I made so many changes my result is not close to the original recipe. But it was good as an inspiration to start from, and my customer (wife) loved the final result, so I'm giving it five stars.
Changes:
1) I used chicken thighs because we both prefer the taste of thighs over breasts. 
2) I had more lime than lemon on hand, so I more or less reversed the proportions.
3) I added a couple of cloves of garlic, as others recommended.
4) I put the salt and Italian seasoning in the marinade itself, rather than adding it while cooking.
5) The big one: I grilled the chicken on my barbeque rather than broiling it in the oven. I did baste the meat a couple of times, as recommended.

Did the recipe exactly like it said  It was ok. Lemon had a strong taste.  I marinated it over night and maybe that did it? Loved the method it was cooked, but it was messy with the water in the pan.  Messy when I had to flip the chicken and pulling the pan out of the oven. That chicken would be really good maybe in a casserole dish where the lemon flavor would add to he dish.
