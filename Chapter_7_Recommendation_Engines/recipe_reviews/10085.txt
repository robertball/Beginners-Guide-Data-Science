I am not sure if your mother's friend is missing some main ingredients...but I have lived in Cyprus for almost 10 years and have traveled to Greece yearly.  Kourambiedes is my favourite Greek dessert.  I added the following to give it a bit more kick :

- Nutmeg ground spice ( to add a bit to the batter )
- Cloves ground spice ( to add a bit to batter )
- Icing sugar for sprinkling ( I also added a bit of nutmeg and cloves to the icing sugar mix )
- Vanilla essence
- Toasted almonds ( chopped coarsely )
- Very little almond extract ( or else it will taste " synthetic " )
- 1 tbs. of cognac or brandy

It was way too dry to shape into crescents. Hard to work with.
