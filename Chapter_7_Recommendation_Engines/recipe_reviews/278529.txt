I only put in half of the yogurt because the whole container sounded like it would be too much. I think it's de;licious. I will save this recipe.

I make 2 because kiddies want some. I only have 1 yogurt for 2. But we like it like that.

Ive been making a similar smoothie for a while now and love it. I use Kefir instead of soy milk and yogurt. Sometimes I throw in a cube of frozen spinach (or fresh). I only gave 4 stars as the one I make is slightly different  and it truly does taste like a creamsicle!

Easy recipe and tasted good. I made orange juice ice cubes. Great way to get more protein. I will be making again.

A little too pulpy, but pouring it through a strainer got the big chunks out and made it much more pleasant. To be fair, not liking pulp is just a personal preference and overall, the recipe is absolutely delicious
