This was so smooth, creamy and delicious! I only made one change out of necessity - instead of a vanilla bean, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Mexican Vanilla. This is a little bit of pumpkin heaven in a ramekin! Thanks Chef John!!

My son found this recipe and I finally made it for him.  It's very good.  The taste is right on.  Not heavy like a custard with heavy cream and half and half , and the taste is not sacrificed.  Thank you, Chef.  P.S. my son loved it!

First I want to say that I am a spaniard and have tasted many a flan. I know my flans because I have grown up eating them my whole life. Your recipe has completely impressed my Spanish family and this is the third year we will be using this recipe to celebrate autumn. It is AMAZING! Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it is delicious and we will always keep this recipe as our number one go-to recipe for autumn.

Have been wanting to make this for years now, and finally did today. It was wonderful!!! The only changes I made were: 1) didn't include mace because I didn't have any; 2) substituted coconut milk for the low-fat milk to make a dairy-free version; and 3) used a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract in place of the vanilla bean because I didn't have  any. Outstanding! Turned out like a dessert served at a high-end restaurant!!!! Once again, THANK YOU, Chef John!

My first batch was a flop because I burned the sugar! Yikes! Second go round I didn't wait for the bubbles on the sugar I just cooked it until it was a beautiful clear amber color; pulled it off the burner and quickly poured it into the ramekins then continued to follow the recipe to the letter. Well, except that I served the flan warm. I couldn't bear to wait yet another four hours. Success! The flan has a wonderful flavor and terrific mouth feel--even warm. Another fabulous recipe from Chef John!

Very nice and impressive. Everyone enjoyed it. I used homemade butternut squash puree because I already had it :) also regular, full fat milk and homemade vanilla extract. Thanks Chef John, God bless you too! :)

Instead of canned pumpkin, microwaved a 1# sweet potato.  Instead of sugary/caramel top, used dark Karo syrup.

I made this just as directed but I personally found this a little too "pumpkiny". Everyone thought it was great. I guess I am a traditionalist when it comes to flan.
