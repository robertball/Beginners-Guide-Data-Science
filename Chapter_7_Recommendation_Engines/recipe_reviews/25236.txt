Good beginning recipe for enchilada sauce but I found it bland on its own. I grew up on the authentic stuff in Latin America with the Mole style type. I think that you would have to adjust this to your own personal taste for sweetness, salt, spicy etc. I added extra cumin and made sure that I used a good (excellent?)quality Chili powder. If your chili powder doesn't really taste good this recipe won't either.

Can I say.... AUTHENTIC??!! This was very good, tastes alot like the nicer restaurants version, not your fast food mexican chains. It doesn't seem to thicken on the stove, but does in the oven. Only thing I reduced on was the 5 TABLESPOONS of HOT chili powder.... I decreased this to 5 TEASPOONS. Which was spicy and bold enough for my husband, but mild enough for me and our 4 kids. Thank you Anna Marie! This is a keeper!

Very authentic!! I will NEVER buy canned or packet sauce again!!!I sub half the chicken broth w/beef broth & add 1 cube beef boullion for beef enchiladas. I add chili 1 tbs at a time and adjust spice level depending on taste (5tbs was good for adults, maybe not for kids)... i would also suggest using wondra flour instd of reg. white flour to reduce lumps. if you are impatient like i am, you can add a little corn starch mixd w/broth to thicken.

I have made this recipe several times and have made afew changes I make the recipe on the stove top until right before I add the chocolate.  I also add 5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 1/2 cups.  After adding the chicken broth which I add very slowly to keep a nice consistency, I add it to a crockpot with bone in skinless chicken breast and thighs, I then cook the chicken on low heat in the sauce for 10 hours, after this I take chicken out take off bone and shred, add 1/2 cup cold water mixed with flour to sauce mixture and after whisking this in to sauce, I then add chocolate to the sauce mixture, after this is done I set about 2 cups of sauce aside and then mix the rest of the sauce with the chicken meat.  This is by far the best mexican style enchilada sauce that I've ever had!   and it freezes and reheats nicely as well!

This is an excellent recipe!  I LOVE IT!  BUT beware!  This is more of a MOLE sauce for enchiladas (chocolate & cinnamon) - NOT your typical red sauce.  Be prepared to also adjust the chili used.  Go slow and add as you like for your taste.

My wife and I just made a batch of this sauce today.  Although we were hoping to have enough to make 8 to 10 enchiladas (and have extra sauce to pour over the top)...it didn't quite work out that way.  BUT WHO CARES!!  It was delicious.  We actually ended up making a second batch so we could pour on top AND freeze some of it for later.

The one thing I did do on the second batch was take a hand blender and smooth out all the "chunks" to make a smooth delicious sauce.  Thanks very much for sharing...GREAT recipe!!

This was wonderful! I cut the chili powder down to 3 Tbl and it was plenty. I ended up simmering it for 30 minutes until it was to the thickness I desired (but I think it just enhanced the taste). I was concerned after tasting it before the chocolate went in - was thinking it wouldn't taste very good at all but the chocolate made all the difference. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet. I used it on beef enchiladas (used left-over roast meat). I sprinkled some Mexican blend cheese on top as well as some chopped green onions while they were baking. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe.

I use coconut oil to be more healthful, and it tastes just great!  I also use organic, unsweetened cocoa powder.  It makes it less sweet, and just PERFECT!  I also puree the onions for a better texture.  I've added it to my arsenal of "secret family recipes" ;) Yum, yum, yum!  Even my foodie brother asked me for the recipe, which is HUGE!

This sauce was SO delicious.  Although you really have to have mature taste buds for this one.  It was delicious and rich, the chocolate and cinnamon make it divine.

Very yummy!  The whole family loved this sauce for our chicken enchiladas.  We used Mexican chocolate for an even more authentic taste.  Will make again.

This was really good...I cut the recipe in half, but also added red pepper flakes for a little more spice. Served this with sweet potato black bean enchiladas. Will never buy canned again! Thanks!

This sauce is superb.  I made some minor changes that seemed to suit our family's palate.  I reduced the amount of chili powder to 3 tablespoons with the idea that I could always add more if needed.  I used a combination of New Mexican chili powder and regular chili powder.  I also added approximately 1/4 cup of Negro Modelo beer (dark beer) to give it a bit of a bite.  My family loved it!  I used it over enchiladas filled with chicken, spinach and ricotta.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made shredded beef enchiladas with it - everyone loved it.  It is tangy and different. I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate squares, so I used unsweetened chocolate squares and 4 tsp. of sugar.

This was so fabulous! I live in England now, and can't get decent enchilada sauce anywhere, but all of these ingredients are readily available. It reminded me of my favorite Mexican restaurant's enchiladas from back home... Thank you!!!

The sauce is amazing. The taste is close to what I assume authentic could be. I'm not a fan of the tomato based sauces. However I would recommend a low saute to lock the flavor in. I tried it the first time on Med-High and it scourched the sauce. Too hot. If your doing electric 3 or 4 is fine, if using fire a low steady flame is key for the flavor. But otherwise it was great.

This is fantastic. Made it tonight and served it over some homemade beef enchiladas. It is going into the keeper pile. Next I'm going to try and make some to freeze. If it works I can make enchiladas anytime we want. Yum!

This was an easy recipe, but took a very long time to cook down to an acceptable consistency. The next time I make it I will start earlier to allow the cook down time. I'm not sure what hot chili powder is (isn't it all hot?).  I only had plain, but I still started with 3T just to be safe.  I worked up to 4 1/2 T before it was spicy enough for my family.  If there is such a thing as hot chili powder, 5T would have been WAY too hot! I also added about 1/4 tsp of black pepper. Salt was not necessary.  The chocolate really added to the flavor.  I used the sauce over spinach enchiladas from this site.

I rated this recipe 4 stars because I had to tinker a bit with it.  To take care of the bland taste, I added 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper along with the other spices and used 5 chicken bouillon cubes (Wyler's chicken flavor with herbs and spices) dissolved in 4 cups of hot water (instead of using the 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth) and added 6 oz of tomato sauce before reducing the recipe.  I liked this recipe because it was easy to play with.  The end results were fantastic.  My kid's cleaned their plates.

Great!  you can leave the cinn. and choco. out for a different flavor.  As the recipe reads it tastes similar to a mole sauce.

This was delicious! It looked a little grainy and wasn't too smooth due to the onions and herbs, but it was wonderful. I used powdered garlic and added a tsp of sugar to cut the bitter from the peppers. I only had regular chili powder so I added a hefty pinch of cayenne. I subbed cocoa powder. Fabulous recipe!

This sauce was awesome.  However, I am giving it 4 stars because I was totally blind sided by the heat.  Five tablespoons of chili was way too hot for me (and I like spicy).  I thought I would go into cardiac arrest for a minute there :).  This recipe with 5 tbl spoons of chili is for those who want their tongue ripped out!   I had to make a whole nother batch using no chili powder.  I then combined the two batches, which came out perfect.  I'll freeze the extra for next time.  There should be a table guide for spicy levels.

I've been making this sauce for years.  I bake the "Mild Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas" in it and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't love it.  It doesn't matter to me whether this is an authentic enchilada sauce or a mole sauce - it's good.

Wow.. I really enjoyed this sauce!  I followed the recipe but just added more cumin and oregano to taste, but stuck to the recipe.  I didn't have any "real" chocolate on hand, but I had some Hershey mini's that I bought to take to work...  one semi sweet dark chocolate mini did the trick!  I wasn't sure about the chocolate and cinnamon at first but thought...  give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  For other readers, if it is too runny for you.. just let it simmer, it only gets better.  Thanks Anna Marie for a sauce that doesn't have tomato sauce in it.  Great!

I have another sauce recipe that have used for 20+ years but thought I would try this.  It was wonderful - the cinnamon gave it a very nice " bite".  I tried the sauce before and after the addition of the chocolate and what a difference!  I tripled the batch and froze the left overs in 3 cup portions.  Just used my first frozen batch and it was even better than the first time.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good! Wanted something to go with mexican eggrolls (rice, black beans, corn, and cilantro) and this looked promising. Made according to the recipe except left the chili powder out since we're not fans. Went perfectly as a dipping sauce. Will definitely make again and even use as an enchilada sauce for actual enchiladas :)

Made this sauce iin a pinch with what i had on hand and I must say it was very good. I used garlic powder since I had no garlic and left out the chocolate since I had none. I did stir in some cocoa chili powder with a little sugar in place. The sauce does thicken in the oven. I also used just 3 cups of broth as I was in a rush and didn't want to wait forever to reduce. For a rush job it was very good and will probably be my go to sauce from here on out.

I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm certain the failure was something I did. Either way, it didn't turn out good. Enchildas with no sauce tonight!

Great enchilada sauce, very tasty and authentic. Note to others that may want a more traditional enchilada sauce: when you add the broth, add an equal portion of tomato paste. While cooking, you can add more broth or water to thin it out if necessary.

This is the BEST enchilada sauce I've ever had!! I always make a double batch to have some in the freezer. My husband and kids (10 and 13) love it, too, and brag about my amazing enchiladas to everyone. This is one recipe I don't add my own "touch" to- it's perfect as is! Thanks, Anna Marie!

Yum Yum Yum.  I was looking for a non-tomato based sauce and this was it!  I made this sauce to go over my chicken enchiladas instead of a sour cream sauce.  It is a great healthy alternative.  My husband, brother & sister in-laws loved it.  I reduced the chili powder to 4 tablespoons.  I had to add 2 extra tablespoons of flour while simmering to help thicken the sauce.  (It will thicken some when you bake it)  The roux isn’t traditional.  It is a dry mixture…to get the flour to blend right, just add a bit of the chicken broth.  Overall it was perfect and I will definitely use this over and over and over again!

I made this as written, except I didn't realize that I only had a small amount of chili powder.  I substituted paprika instead and it was very good.  I only made 1/2 of the recipe as I was using it for wet burritos and needed a smaller amount.  I loved the hint of sweetness the chocolate gives this sauce...like adobo sauce.  This one will be made again and again.

The recipe is pretty good. I decided to leave out the chocolate, and I decreased the amount of chili powder to 3 tablespoons, which was still quite spicy. I also slightly reduced the amount of cinnamon. Next time I plan to try adding a bit of tomato sauce.

Incredible!  But I added one 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  It made enough sauce for two 9 X 11 pans of enchiladas.

This had a great taste, very easy to make, and will make again. I used less Chilli Powder worried that it may be too hot for us. But next time will put all 5 tablespoons. I will also make it cook a little less, it was a bit too thick by the time it came out of the over as I used it for Enchilada Casserole. Thanks for sharing Anna Marie.

The only reason this is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipe is missing salt (which it needs IMO) and not quite specific enough re: chili powder (are we talking the stuff you use to make chili, or powdered chili peppers)?  I used the stuff you use for chili, but a top quality, robust version (from Penzeys).  I can't figure out how anyone found this to be bland.    I tried this because I forgot to buy sauce and didn't want to go back to the store.  Glad I made that choice! I was out of oregano and chocolate, but it was still good (put in a little cocoa powder).  I did add a smidge of tomato sauce because I had a little bit left in an open can.  This will be a go-to recipe.

I rated this lower simply because I wouldn't call this an "enchilada sauce".  It's much more a mole sauce, so the name can be misleading.  I thought it was very good as a mole sauce, but definitely be prepared for more of a mole taste, rather than true (tomato) enchilada taste.

This is definitely more of a Mole sauce than enchilada sauce, but it's very good.  Lots of flavor (I add a little more spice to it with cayenne pepper), and goes very well with beans in flour tortillas.  We pour it over our vegetarian enchiladas, then add cheese and bake for about 20 minutes on 350.

This is a good sauce if you include "mole" in the title. Reviewers that stated it was "off" or "weird" were probably expecting something different. The sauce is good, I'll make it again.  But my husband commented that he was thinking we were having Enchiladas for dinner. I asked him what he thought we were eating and he said, "It's good - but it isn't Enchiladas!"

I do not think I could have screwed this recipe up more than I did, so it is a real testament to the recipe that it still turned out AMAZING!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, until I got to the part when you add the flour and chili powder.  I was multi-tasking in the kitchen and accidentally grabbed the cinnamon instead of the the chili powder.  Add I added two tablespoons before I realized my mistake!!!!  Oh my!  I almost tossed the whole thing, but I had just made chicken broth and had quite a bit, so I thought what the heck, maybe I could fix it.  I don't have ANY idea what measurements I used after that point...only that I used the exact ingredients called for, with no additions.  I added and stirred and tasted, over and over again until that "Eureka" moment finally came!  I am so, so glad I stuck with it.  This is absolutely wonderful!  Very authentic, and the flavors are much more sophisticated then anything you will ever get in a can!  A quick note- I added the broth very slowly and whisked constantly and did not have a single problem with lumps.  This deserves way more than 5 stars, and I can NOT wait to decide what I most want to cook with it.  Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you Anna Marie!  This is tremendous :)

I was very skeptical about this--even after it was cooked! It's not your typical canned enchilada sauce. However, it was spectacular on the chicken enchiladas I made! I put in 3 Tbs of the hot chili powder and it was plenty! You have to stir constantly until it's thickened. Then I simmered it another 30 minutes to let the flavors intensify while I assembled the enchiladas in the pan. Awesome!

Awesome!  I will never buy enchilada sauce again!  This is much closer to the mexican restaurant enchiladas I like than anything else I've found.  It can be too salty if you use regular chicken broth so I would recommend reduced sodium broth. (I am a salt-a-holic so this is something coming from me!)

It was ok... Not as good as what you can get in pretty much any standard Mexican restaurant. It was good enough to use, but I'm not sure I would go out of my way to make it again. The recipe makes tons of sauce. I recommend making half the recipe unless you want to keep a batch fot the freezer.

This was pretty good, but after reading all of the other reviews, I expected something more of it.  I found the cinnamon flavor to be a little strong at first and the aftertaste to be somewhat acidic.

4.5 stars. If you want  a "green" enchilada sauce...dont go nuts with the chili powder and half the chicken broth/stock with 1/2 a good tomatillo style salsa (or use a can grn chilies) . I use Goya brand. I also add about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro as well. I don't care for the chocolate for a grn sauce. Only use a touch of cinnamon as it can overwhelm the final results. Instead of white onion I go with chopped green onions when I have them. I tblsp chili powder w/same amount of cumin works for me. Add some salt & grnd pepper too. Couldn't find a green enchilada recipe so tweaked this one.

Very good, a little bit sweeter than I would have liked but the family loved it.

This sauce is amazing!!!!  It is so much better than anything in a can and it is VERY easy to make.  I tweaked the recipe a bit (like most cooks do) but the base was the same. I highly recommend this to all lovers of authentic mexican cuisine!

Used this with the Spicy Chicken Enchiladas form this site.  Considering that this was the first time that we have had Enchilada it was o.k. but nothing to write home about.  This sauce tasted fine.  I have nothing to compare it to.

Best recipe I have found here! Authentic yet simple. This is just the sauce so you can make your own variation of enchiladas using this sauce.

Great sauce! I added some fire-roasted green chili peppers to it and it really added to the flavor.

This was a good base, various spices were used, but it was missing something (besides salt) The end result was almost more of a mole rather than enchilada sauce.  It definitly did taste authentic though.

I'm never buying enchilada sauce again!  I reduced the chili powder to 3 TBSP and dark cocoa powder instead of the semisweet chocolate.  I also love spicy food so I added 2 minced canned chipotle chilis.  Awesome!

Awesome!  I used a lot less chili powder because the type that I have is super hot.  Also some confusion might be in chili powder for chili and chili powder like ground up hot chili peppers.  I am using the hot chili pepper kind and it is way too hot for me.

this mole sauce was delicious, especially since I had cheap dollar store chili powder and still got great results!  I read that chili powder can be anything from straight ground chilis to ground chilis with added spices and salt, so I can imagine recipes will vary.  I used all 5T and it really wasn't very spicy.  I also used semisweet chocolate chips since I didn't have squares, which came to 1/4 cup for the 1 ounce that was called for.  then at the last minute I added more chocolate chips because my mom thought it wasn't sweet enough.  I thought the cinnamon was right on.  I just stirred some cooked chicken into the sauce, served over rice, and garnished with cilantro... so good!

My family loves this sauce.  It really adds a nice flavor to even packaged frozen enchiladas for a quick weekday meal.  Great idea to double it and keep some in the freezer.   I follow this recipe as is with great results.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I poured it over my chicken enchiladas and  everyone raved.  I did cut the chili powder almost in half and was glad I did - it was perfect like that. It does have that 'mole' taste, very deep and rich. 
My jaded, New York City  and Santa Fe, NM taste buds were thrilled!  If anyone thinks this tastes 'wierd' they're probably inexperienced with Mexican flavors. 
I teamed it up with Mexican Rice III, Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread, Guacamole and Burrito Pie - WOW!  My husband said it was the best Mexican meal he's ever had - including in restaurants.
I'll never make another Enchilada/Mole sauce!

This recipe won’t work unless you use more than 1 tablespoon of oil. You need ¼ cup to make it blend properly. Also, it tastes much more authentic if you use New Mexico chile power. It was way to spicy using chile power. For all the trouble of this recipe, I’m going to stick to the “10 minute enchilada sauce” on this site. It’s easier and tastes just as good if not better.

LOVE IT!  I was making Beef Enchiladas II (from this site) and needed a sauce.  I didn't have any on hand and to be honest had never tried enchilada sauce before.  Anyway, this was really nice and I will for sure be making it again.  I did tweak a little and halved the recipe but added a little less chili powder and a tablespoon more flour.  Superb!

Wow!  Incredible - you'll never eat canned sauce again.  I had another recipe that I had been using, but then decided to try this one and I'm so glad that I did.  I did have to let it simmer for about 30 to 45 minutes to thicken up, but it did it on it's on without cornstarch or flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

FABULOUS!! Instructions were a bit misleading at "reduce", meaning reduce liquid by cooking NOT reduce heat. As this is a roux based sauce, reducing the heat means it wont thicken.
Suggest using authentic Mexican semisweet chocolate for just the right traditional flavor.

This sauce is excellent and authentic Mexican -- in Mexico it is called Mole.  It is derived from the Aztec Indians before the Spaniards arrived.   Anyway,  Absolutely delicious.

I highly reccommend this recipe!  I have never used anything besides the canned stuff (but am trying to improve my culinary skills) and it was super easy and had great flavor.  It is almost like a mole sauce, everyone I've made it for has loved it, except for a couple people who said they just don't like mole sauces.  Much better than your typical red sauce, I have made this dozens of times and it's always excellent, must be the chocolate!

Excellent sauce!  It's more of a mole sauce versus a typical red enchilda sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but added some crushed red pepper flakes since I didn't have hot chili powder.  Thanks Anna Marie!

What a great recipe.  Although the second step seems to be slightly confusing, it's easy to improvise.  The chocolate and cinnamon give the recipe a nice mole sauce flavor.  Definitely recommended!

I made this as written and then put the recipe in my nutrition calculator. Sodium is not 35 mg per serving as you say. It is 182 mg per serving, so I can't eat it.

I've adored this recipe many times and do use an emulsion blender to smooth it out.  It makes so much I could put the leftovers in a squirt bottle and use on other dishes or tortilla chips as a snack. I don't like to read reviews giving accolades to a recipe that they have tweaked, but a couple of times I did not have ingrediants on hand and this recipe is very forgiving. I've used a pinch of Italian herb seasoning or 5-Spice mix when out of oregano, a few splashes of beer when not enough chicken stock on hand, a dash or two of Shirracha sauce if chili powder is not spicey, etc. But the old tried and true comeback to recipe is this one. Kudos to you.

OMG!!!  I almost didn't try this recipe after reading the reviews saying things like this is for a sophisticated palette only, or this is a far cry from the tomato-base you're used to, but none of the tomato-based sauces had quite the same reviews, so I came back to this one.  SO GLAD I DID.  HOLY SMOKES this stuff is amazing.  I kept spooning some out of the pan to taste it because it was so amazing.  It reminds me of the enchiladas I used to eat at this truly authentic Mexican eatery (not the Americanized one most of us are used to).  There is such depth of flavor.  I'm sure some kitchen enthusiasts would cringe at this, but I didn't have any semisweet chocolate left so I sprinkled in a bit of cocoa powder instead.  I also didn't want it to be too spicy for my 3-year-old, so I cut down a bit on the chili powder and tripled the cumin.  I just tossed together some ground beef, green pepper, and spices for the insides but the sauce truly made the enchiladas.  My picky toddler gobbled this stuff up, as did my picky grown-up neighbor.  DELICIOUS!  You won't regret this one.  It's not your traditional tomato base, true, but so much better.

This is a very tasty recipe! I was concerned about it being chunky from adding the chicken broth into the flour, so I added the broth first and slowly added the flour with whisking. I think the biggest mistake I made the first time I made it was to over-reduce it. The chocolate really thickens it a lot, so if it looks like enchilada sauce before you add the chocolate, you're going to have to add more broth.

I am a firm believer in making things from scratch.  I did not care for this, and I had everyone try it befor I put it on the enchiladas and no one wanted more than the taste.  I then ran to the store for a can of enchilada sauce.  I have to say it was MUCH better after I put in the chocolate.  I went over and over the recipe thinking I missed something, if I did, I can't figure it out.  This is not something I will even attempt again.  I wish I knew what happened, was SO looking forward to trying this based on the reviews.

This was awesome, got rave reviews from the entire family, will definitely make again. Only used the 32 oz. box of chicken broth (4 cups) and came out fine.

Great sauce out of all I have tried for my search for my untimate red sauce.  I eliminated choclate and cinnamon.  Lowered the cumin and oregano to 1/4 teaspoon.  That's my taste..Good recipe!!

this actually worked out better than I thought it would. I used it as a base for a mole sauce and added chicken. Used more flour to thicken to a nice sauce so it was very good.

Excellent sauce.  My husband is Mexican and is used to authentic Mexican food and he loved this.  We changed the serving size to 6.  We used this with "Tacos in Pasta Shells" by  grannycancook  on Allrecipes.  It was the perfect Mexican meal.

This turned out to be delicious!  I used chocolate chips instead square just to $ave a little in the store.  I really wouldn't change anything otherwise.  My aim was to find a perfect enchilada sauce that was MSG-free.  Looks like (smells like, tastes like) we were successful.

I had to leave out the chocolate and substitute V8 with a little added water for the chicken broth. Believe it or not, it worked. I've been meaning to try this for years and I'm so glad I did. It was excellent. Of course, I did heat it up with some cayenne and extra cumin. Want to make more soon!!!!

Excellent.  Great flavor and depth - I needed something without tomato sauce and it was a hit with the husband and kids.  I'm going to make cheese enchiladas with it sometime.

I can't give this recipe 5 stars because I modified it.  I added only a dash of cinnamon and a tiny half square of chocolate because I'm not crazy about sweet mole style sauces.  With those modifications, the sauce was AMAZING, not too sweet and perfect for my taste (I like spicy/salty/flavorful).  It also thickened perfectly with the recommended amount of flour.  Tlavor was unbeatable and it only took a few minutes to make.  I will never use canned enchilada sauce again.

I didn't have any semisweet chocolate on hand so I used 1/2 oz of unsweetened chocolate and 1t of sugar.    This recipe makes the perfect spicy/sweet sauce to go with chicken enchiladas.  Yum!

First attempt at making my own enchilada sauce and it turned out very, very good.  I ended up using 2 Tb Hot (New Mexico) and 2 Tb Mild (California) Chile powders and it was plenty spicy and had good chile flavor.  Only complaint was that even after extensive cooking, both before and after adding the liquid, it was still a touch grainy.

Only four stars because I never actually measure spices into sauce, I just add & taste and repeat until I like it.  The only ingredient change I made was using a heaping tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder 'cuz I didn't have any baking chocolate.   Used this with the Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas found on this site, and that meal gets five stars definitely because of this sauce!
     ?Como hacen usted dice DELICIOSO?! The dinner was surely a winner!  The BF came home from work the next day and heated up the leftovers for himself immediately.  The only other meal he does that for is lasagna...

this was my first attempt at making a brown sauce and it was really good. Had to fight through the beginning with the strange texture. Just keep stirring and add the broth and it will turn out fine.  I reduced the cinnamon after reading other reviews and was glad I did. We froze the other part and just used it again this week to make turkey enchiladas (had to use up the thanksgiving turkey!)

Great sauce.  The more we ate, the better it got. Cannot believe the difference by just adding that little bit of chocolate. Don't even think of trying it without the chocolate.

Oh my gosh, this is sooo good! If you are looking for the taste of canned sauce, go elsewhere. This is a very rich sauce with a Mole edge.

This was alright.  Not great.  I reduced the chili powder to 3 TBS which seemed about right for us-spiciness wise.  Maybe it would be better if we used a higher quality chili powder as others suggested.  Also, I would use a little less chocolate.  We didn't care too much for that taste of it.  It thickened up nicely after simmering for about 15-20 minutes.

By far the best homemade enchilada sauce I've ever had.  Highly recommended.  (I did, however, reduce the chili powder to 3 Tbsp.)

The flavor is great, and I will definitely keep using this recipe. I am only giving four stars because the recipe calls for you to add "flour and chili powder, stirring until sauce thickens" before you are instructed to add liquid. Hard to get a sauce without liquid. Also, because the sauce is fairly dark brown, its appearance is unattractive. (Especially to folks who grew up on tomato-based sauces).
But like I said, the flavor is GREAT!

I was hesitant about no tomatoes in this sause, but it was excellent! I used 3 tablespoons (instead of 5) of the chili powder and it was still plenty spicy. I'm a vegetarian so I made it with veggie broth instead of chicken and it tasted great.

This was an incredible surprise. I was wanting to make enchiladas and did not have sauce...I live a good 25 miles out of town so a quick trip was not possible. This is so easy and it is off the charts delicious. I will never buy sauce again. Thanks for sharing this!!!!!

Be careful on the cinnamon.  I put a little too much and you can take it in the dish.  Otherwise, not a bad recipe to use without tomato sauce.  Served excellent with Spanish Rice.

Not tasty by my standards - do not like TexMex style and this is TexMex!  Tastes burnt to me.  Perhaps it's the type of chili powder???  or too much chili powder?  not sure - I had to doctor it up with tomato puree and more spices: however I and my husband still did not like it.  But gave to my neighbor who thinks it will taste great if reduced once more with chicken stock.  I like Ortega's Enchilada Sauce and would like to find a recipe that is similar to it!  Any suggestions?

I doubled this with the chicken broth I had in freezer from chicken I boiled a month ago for another enchilada dinner.. This recipe surpasses any enchilada sauce I've ever purchased. Hooray for a great Basic Recipe.

I'm not a big fan of enchildas, but this recipe has unique flavor. Tastes like a combination of enchilda and a hint of mole sauce together. It works, we thought it was great. I've used it on beef enchildas and cheese,onion and jalapeno enchildas. Can't wait to try it out on the in-laws (who are hispanic).Thank you so much for this easy, AWESOME recipe.

Good recipe to balance out other spicy foods you may serve with it.  It was great baked over the cheese & onion enchiladas.  Would make again!

Great sauce!  I cut back on both the garlic and the hot chili powder, but it certainly deserves five stars in my book! I won't be using the canned sauces ever again!  Thanks for the post, Anna Marie.

Made this tonight because I didn't have my usual packets of  seasonings on hand.  It was just a blessing that I happened to have a package of semi sweet chocolate chips in the pantry. I followed the recipe until it came to the semi sweet chocolate. I threw in a small handful of  semi sweet chocolate chips. Also, the chili powder, I added 3 heaping tablespoons, and 3 very heavy handed shakes of Cayenne pepper. This was tasty and after I rolled the enchiladas (mixla tortillas from HEB) Poured the left over sauce over the tortillas, (I had 12) topped with shredded hatch pepper cheese, chopped tomatoes and green onions and served with a blended salad of romaine with tomatoes, cucumbers and red onion. Hubby and I loved it and that's what's for lunch and dinner this tonight! Thank you for a great recipe!

I'd make this again but with only 3 Tbs of the chili powder (used N.M. style). Based onreviews I used less and was so glad I did.  My daughter and i were panting for something cool to ear with it but it was still delish.  My husband and son thought the spice level was perfect.  Only other change was that I used leftover jarred mole in place of the chocolate chips.  The sauce thickened perfectly as it baked.  I was worried that it was a bit thin. 4 stars to warn about the spice level. Thanks for recipe!

I made VERY minor changes to this recipe... I used Better Than Bullion with water instead of already made chicken stock and I used my emersion blender at the end to make sure the consistency was  smooth. We loved this sauce over our veggie enchiladas. This recipe is a keeper.

Great!  Not a spicy fan and seeing all that Chili Powder I was hesitant.  After  cooking it for awhile I tasted and thought I would have to throw it away as it was too  hot for us.
Chilled it down over night, and put back on the stove to add the thickener.....the taste has mellowed overnight and is just perfect.  I'm following other suggestions by blending the vegys to make a smoother sauce, yumms, and that makes it better.  Best sauce I've ever tasted, will never use that nasty canned stuff again.  Glad I doubled the recipe and will freeze for later.  I'd serve this to anybody and be proud of it.

I made a half recipe, added less chili.powder, added in a little curry powder as well (all I had on hand) and used gluten free flour blend. It took a bit to whisk together. 
Then I reduced 50%. Then, I stirred in a tablespoon of dark chocolate melting chips. Then I made cheese enchiladas with 4 Mexican cheese blend. I cooked until bubbly and cheese was melted, about 20 minutes. Super easy to make the whole way through. 
This was FANTASTIC. The spice was just right. The flavor was rich and layered. It was gobbled right up and seconds were served.
I'd say this was a hit. I'll definitely be making this sauce again. Probably in like 3 days when they beg for more.

Simple easy sauce. I love mole which this is similar to but added a little tomato paste to sweeten the harshness of the mole flavor.

Good base recipe!! Definitely adjust seasonings to your taste (I decreased the onion and increased the cumin). Be sure to use a good quality chili powder! This was a hit with my fiancé!

I had to make some changes because of things I didn't have, but it still came out delish! Used water and increased all the spices to make up for my lack of chicken stock (I only had 1/4 of the recommended amount), but I definitely still loved it. The recipe made a little more than I needed for my enchiladas, so I used the rest to stew some black beans! SO good!

Made it as written.  It did taste a little bland.  It was a simple process to make this, and it did produce a dish full of enchilada's, but I've learned to appreciate more what goes into making true authentic enchiladas via the long traditional process.  This is an ok substitute if you just have to have enchiladas and you don't want to put a lot of time into it.

GREAT recipe! I used slightly less broth and chili powder, and cocoa instead of chocolate. But it turned out great poured over beef enchiladas!

I live in Panama and we can't find this sauce here so I broke down and made it.  It was so easy to make and got raves from all my dinner guests.  Will for sure make this again.

This sauce is phenomenal!!!!!   I live in Arizona where there's a mexican restaurant on every corner. But this is the best sauce I have ever tasted. I cooked it for about 30 minutes and then let it cool.  It thickened up just right. Enchilada sauce is not supposed to be thick, more like a loose gravy.  The only thing I added was a little more cumin. Delicious!!!

It does take a while to reduce.....we ended up with about 1/2 the initial liquid (after making a double batch).  We also have some really potent chili powder from Taos NM & only used about 1/3rd of the recipe amount.....still had a nice burn but you could taste the other flavors too.  Love this recipe!!!

This was delicious! I gave it four stars instead of five only because it was more of a rich mole sauce than an enchilada sauce.

Had to add more flour to get it to thicken. Used ONE THIRD the amount of Chili Powder called for & was perfect! Also added a T or 2 of tomato paste. DIVINE! Will service this to company!

I added some salt, about 2 tablespoons of sugar, and about 2 tablespoons more flour during the cook time. Next time I'll use less chili powder. The taste was a little strong for my family.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce. Not bad, all in all, though

I liked it a lot, but gave 4 stars because I adjusted the heat by adding a can of diced tomatoes and 1\2 block of cream cheese. Everyone raved about it.  I will definitely make it again.

A little too bland. If the enchiladas you're making already call for onions, I'd cut back on the amount you put in the sauce.

OMGoodness! This is good stuff & really easy to make. I was craving enchiladas & didn't have any of my regular canned sauce - boy am I glad! I did use a little (maybe 1-1/2T) of abodo chili sauce that I added with the other spices, other than that I stuck to the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

My family loved this!
My husband went on and on about how good it was.
My kids are 8 and 10 and they both devoured the enchiladas I made.
I made a simple Meat and rice mixture inside some soft gluten free wraps. Put sauce on the bottom of the pan and covered the enchiladas with the rest of the sauce.
I also made the sauce with a gluten free flour blend. It turned out great!
We made this with and without the chocolate, everyone's prefers it without.

Really good! I used The Spice Hunter New Mexico chile pepper. Left out the chocolate since I didn't have it. Used with ground turkey, onion, garlic, flour tortillas, and Monterey jack cheese. Super yummy! My husband and daughter prefer the tomato-based sauce in the "Beef Enchiladas with spicy red sauce" recipe by Vicky Boozer on this site.

I was in the mood for tortlilla soup and didn't have enchilada sauce. Thought about doing a sauce that I make with steak enchiladas... But although amazing, I needed something quick since the soup is done in a crock pot. I was shocked with how simple and quick this was... Not to mention AMAZING! it was great without the chocolate and then I added 1/4 of an oz and was was surprised about how great it was, (never got into the secret of the chocolate) ended up throwing the rest in ;) I cut chili power to teaspoons from Tbl... Couldn't even begin to imagine how that would over power the sauce. But I did 4 tea reg chili powder and 1 Tea ancho chili powder. The last I did was throw in all in a food processor only because I was using this for tortilla soup and since it has zucchini, squash, onion and tomato chunks in it, just wanted a smooth sauce!!!! Never ever will I buy canned again! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Deep rich flavor with a lot of complexity.  We made enchiladas from another all recipes recipe but added my home-made salsa verde and a can of green chilis, plus garlic powder, salt, pepper and some Lawrey's seasoning (but not too much).  The salsa verde gave the enchiladas a bit of spice which complimented the sauce.  Definitely a make again!!

Tried this for the first time tonight and it was very good. I did as one poster suggested and used beef broth along with the chicken broth. Also, using an immersion blender made the sauce lovely and smooth (after simmering for about 1/2 hour). Adding the juice of 1/2 lime (squeezed gently) and changing the chocolate to semi-sweet gave it a nice tang. Measuring isn't something I do and did not do so with this recipe. I just taste-tested along the way and it turned out wonderfully. It was a hit with the whole family.

Pretty good, although I had to add more cornstarch so this wasn't completely runny.  I tasted after simmering on the stove for 30-60 mins and I wasn't a huge fan of the taste so I added 2 tbsp. salsa and pureed it with a stick blender.  So much better!

I liked this recipe but it was not thick like the canned enchilada sauce.  I only used a pinch of cayenne pepper as my kids would hate if if I added as much as suggested.  I added some salt.  My husband said he did not like the cinnamon.  I think it was a nice tasting sauce.

Look no further! This is the recipe you are looking for. This sauce is rich and delicious. Followed the directions to a T and used it for shredded beef enchiladas. This may have been the most delicious dish I have ever made, and I cook A LOT (it could be bias due to extreme Mexican craving after moving to England where no Mexican restaurants are available :)  ). The only negative is that it gave me some pretty hellacious heart burn, but that is probably my fault because I absolutely inhaled this!

I've made this twice and I'm ready for a third time.  I love the flavor!  There was one adjustment because I like my sauces a little on the spicy side.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of ground red pepper for some of the chili powder.  I use this to top bean burritos, enchiladas, and scrambled eggs.  Thank you for this recipe.  Yes, I know this is similar to a mole' sauce (because of the chocolate) but it's what I like and isn't that what food is all about?

This was OUT of the world!  I made it to gone on enchiladas made with home made canned taco chicken, onion, cheese and flour tortillas.  My husband was VERY sceptical at first, but finally agreed we should at least try it.  He was nearlly sobbing with happiness when I served it and knocked the kids over to get seconds.

Made exactly as recommended, tho I did cook it much longer then 30 mins to reduce it to a consistancy I liked.  (I wanted it a bit thicker.)

I just finished whipping this baby up and it was delish! I didn't have a few ingredients on hand so I substituted and it came out wonderful. I only added 4 cups of chicken broth, and only had 2 tablespoons of chili powder. I didn't have oregano, but I did have 'italian seasoning' flakes which worked fine. Then I added few good squirts of Siracha chili hot sauce (yep the thai kind). It filled in the missing 'chili' flavor. Lastly I added some chicken bullion instead of salt to round out the flavor, but it probably would have been fine without. I loved the complex flavors. Thumbs up!

I tried this recipe and thought that it was different from the flavor of the mexican food restaurants here in AZ but we liked it anyway.

This came out kind of bland, maybe because I used my own stock which was light so I added some salt; normally I would make this with just oil and water and all dry spices.  I decided to add just a TBSP of tomato paste and it came up nicely.

I love this sauce!  I've tried several home made enchilada sauces and they are good but this time I was looking for something different.  This one fit the bill and tastes so good and has such a depth of flavor that I haven't had in other sauces.  It does taste similar to a mole and I loved that it didn't have tomato sauce since I was looking for one without it.  I will definitely be making this sauce again.

Excellent as written.  I used and immersion blender at the end, prior to adding the chocolate, to really smooth it all together.  The chocolate mutes well after cooking.  Very very good.

i followed this to a t but used chocolate chips instead of squares which obviously didn't change a thing.  the chili powder i used was just regular chili powder but this recipe is fabulous.  no need to buy canned/packaged again.  i used half and froze the rest for next time.  fresh and authentic.

Sorry but this one just didn't work right...it came out with a bit of flavor but just seemed flat.  My husband agreed. It didn't cost too much to make.  It did help a bit to add some tomato paste and more cumin, but we just couldn't salvage it into something we liked.  We are spoiled for really good Mexican food from back home but now that we live in London nothing seems to catch up with it.

The whole family liked this sauce.  It did take quite a while to reduce to desired consistency, but in the end it was worth it.  Only used a very small handful of choc. chips.  Turned out great.

We enjoyed this sauce.  I made a double batch and added just a little tomato sauce to adjust the recipe to our personal taste.  My son has a wheat allergy, so I did not thicken the sauce with anything.  It was very thin, but by the time my enchiladas were done baking, it was perfect.

A great sauce on its own; far better than canned sauce. Not too spicy for kids who aren't fussy, and a great launchpad for a spicier sauce for the adults.

We were looking for a quick enchilada sauce that would work with the ingredients we had in the house - so I made a few substitutions and it still turned out amazing!  I ran out of fresh garlic - so I used garlic powder and I was skeptical it would taste good - but it was really good.  Also, I didn't have ancho chili powder, so I used a combination of paprika and cayenne pepper.  We also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of baking bars.  With all that substitution, it was still an extremely good sauce and I'd highly recommend it.  Thanks Anna Marie!

WOW.  Really easy and delicious.  Didn't change a thing, and it turned out rich and flavorful but without all the oil and fat you might expect in a mole.  NOTE - I blended in a food processor just before spreading in the pan and over the enchiladas. Gave it a really smooth texture.

I didn't really like this sauce. I was hoping for more of an authentic enchilada sauce, this sauce had more of a mole taste to it.If you're looking for a more traditional enchilada sauce, I would try another recipe.

This was delicious! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. My only complaint is that it was really salty, and I will try to use a reduced sodium broth next time. I'm making this again this weekend and I can't wait!

I have not put this on anything yet, but after tasting it, I love it!!!  My onion mixture was very dry when I went to add the flour and chili powder so I added a small amount of broth first. I doubled the recipe, but did not double the garlic or the chili powder. Probably used 1 less cup of broth.  This is really good!

Grew up here in texas and used to the tomato sauce type but this is a very nice alternative, similar to mole' sauce.  The recipe does need more oil to make the roux and I had to simmer it a very long time to get it to thicken up.  I'll definitely make it again but add more flour.  I went very lite on the cinnamon and heavy on the chile powder, personal taste. Great with the cottage cheese chicken enchilada on this site and you can use the left over broth from stewing the chicken breasts to make this sauce, save a couple bucks.

My husband and I LOVED this sauce. He had no idea that the secret ingredient was chocolate. I attempted to make my own sauce because store-bought is always too spicy for my kids. I only put 1 tsp. of Chili Powder. It was spicy enough for us and too spicy for my kids. I guess my Chili Powder is really fresh and really hot.

This was great! VERY HOT.  Also, might want to cut back the semi-sweet chocolate a bit.

I loved this sauce.  It had way more flavor than any store bought sauce.  Reminded me of authentic mexican food.

this is a great enchilada recipe and with a little tweaking -- more cumin and cayenne and some cheese -- you can make it the the way your favorite mexican dive makes it! thanks for sharing anna maria. my whole family loves it!

Sauce was very tasty but a bit too overpowering.  I only used 3 tablespoons of chili powder and that was still too much.  Will make again but will tone down the seasonings, esp. chili powder.  Good overall taste.

Super easy to make, great flavor.  Our family does need it MUCH less spicy though.  I only used 1/4 cup mixed with diced tomatoes to serve it.  Will make many more times just using less chili pepper.

This was a very easy sauce to put together.  I didn't have the chocolate so that was omitted, but it still received raves from my family.  Will use again.

I really liked this recipe. The whole family thought it was great!
I used chicken/tomato boullion instead of chicken broth. I also left out the chocolate chips because I used too much cinnamon and thought it was sweet enough without them. Will use the chips on the next try. Loved it!!!

Well this sauce got mixed reviews in my family.  My daughters really liked it, hubby said it was ok, and I was very disappointed...maybe because I set my expectations to high?  I may try it again and revamp it some like cutting back on the amount of chili powder and using a different brand and adding more cumin.

Could you give this recipe no stars? I can't even begin to describe how awful it is. It doesn't resemble mexican cuisine at all. I'm so glad that I didn't pour it over the chicken and beef enchiladas that I made from a  recipe from this site. Those were delicious.

I loved this sauce!  It sounds scarey, but it is excellent.  Hubby is not sure it is better than the stuff out of the can, but he'll just have to adjust.

This was very good.  However, the sauce did not want to thicken much.  But, when I baked it with the Enchiladas (by Donna on this website) it was just the perfect consistancy.  My only complaint is this was a little time consuming & much more expensive than the canned sauce, which is very close in taste.

Very good, very authentic.  I live in S. CA and am very picky about Mexican food.  I have been looking for something like this forever.  I too added an extra chocolate.  It was perfect!

This was the first time I have ever made enchiladas.  I made half the quantity of this sauce and my husband loved it.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make.
