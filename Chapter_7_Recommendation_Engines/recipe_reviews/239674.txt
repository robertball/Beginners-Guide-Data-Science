They have discontinued this soup, so added cilantro, a can of black beans, beef consume and cheddar soup.  Turned out tasty and very filling.  Used the small empanada discs.  Will make them again!

I couldn’t find the soup so I used a can of La Costena black beans and fresh cilantro.  I added the cumin and a seeded jalapeño to the beef when it was browning. Everything else was basically the same.  It did need salt since I wasn’t using a condensed soup.  

I enjoyed them. They filled the craving. Next time I might add some crushed tomato. 

I served with sour cream, sliced avocado and Herdez roasted salsa verde.

I omitted the Campbell soup and instead created a tomato sauce using 1 small can of  crushed tomatoes w/ jalapeños, cumin, 1TBS of molasses, chill powder, garlic powder, black pepper and 2TBS of tomato paste blended in food processor.  I added this to ground beef after draining fat.  Also I added cilantro and corn.
