I love Scandinavian cooking, so I couldn't wait to try this loaf cake. I could not find cardamom flavoring and so used 1 tsp. cardamom spice instead. I have made this three times. Once according to the original recipe, once with an extra egg yolk, and once with candied orange peel instead of raisins. All turned out really well. The cake keeps well and can be toasted or used to make "Poor Nights of England," a Brit version of French toast served as dessert. I use golden raisins instead of regular ones.

Wonderful cake!  I was just in Iceland and had a cake very similar.  Thanks for sharing!

One tip: don't worry about trying to track down cardamom extract - just use 1/2 tsp cardamom powder instead.

I wanted muffins, so I added a 1/2 t. more baking powder and added milk until the consistency was a little less thick than the original recipe made.  I also used currants soaked in tea instead of raisins.  They came out perfect.  The flavor is unique and delicate.  It was just what I was looking for, something light, refreshing and different than your usual muffin fare.  I would use this recipe again.

Great recipe! I have made a few times! I used 1 tsp ground cardamon and the grated rind of 1 lemon (I can not find cardamon extract) and it tasted amazing! Thank-you!

But I added apricot and walnuts and doubled the amount of raisins, I wanted it to be rich.

Used my basic recipe for the basis to this but used the flavourings and it was oh, so yummy! Made cardamon extract by soaking about 5/6 crushed green cardamons in hot water and added this. Will use this as an idea again.

This cake is delicious, tastes just like Christmas cake should! However, we cannot find an 11 inch pan, used a standard 9 inch and cooked it a little longer. Still had a gooey center but we ate it anyway!

Very nice. I ground some cardamom just before adding it. And instead of using dried fruits I just added a handful of roasted almond pieces. 

The batter tasted very lemony, but I couldn't taste much of the lemon after baking. I think next time I will just leave out the lemon and substitute vanilla instead. 

Took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake to a moist consistency.

This made the house smell wonderful! I didn't have lemon flavouring so I added orange zest. Also had only cardamon spice so followed what others did there. Comfort load for sure!

Wonderful recipe, goes great with brie cheese (appetizer)! Also, I used ground cardamom instead of the extract, gives a nice little appearance/color to the bread instead of plain white ... one more change I did was to use craisins instead of raisins, adds a very nice red color to the bread, festive!

I was excited to find a cake recipe with cardamom but overall was disappointed with the end result. It smelled wonderful baking but came out too dry. I too thought the raisins didn't go well with the texture or the taste of this cake.

Fairly easy cake to make, especially for how mouth-wateringly delicious it is. I have made this cake at least 5 times, and it never fails to impress me and everyone else! I can never find the cardamom extract, but it seems the ground cardamom makes quite a satisfactory substitute. I have and will continue to recommend this to anyone looking for a new dessert for any holiday, or any reason at all, really.

Baked it for the first time today. Absolutely lovely combination of flavors. A winner!!! I used orange extract as I did not have lemon extract and used 1/2 tsp. of ground cardamom seeds, decreased sugar by 1/4 cup, increased raisins and added dried cranberries to = 3/4 cup of fruit and 1tbslp. ground flax seed. This is superlative!

This cake reminds me of the German cakes my mom used to bake. A welcome change from the heavily frosted cakes. I made it for Christmas exactly to the recipe with the exception of adding pecans because we all like them. I can see that adding more fruit might add to the flavor. I'm giving it five stars because everyone said it was very good and I'll make it again.

Great flavor, but what a mess! The very center was still a tiny bit gooey, and the rest was quite crumbly. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves. Maybe I shouldn't have.

This takes quite a while to bake, but it is well worth it. I was amazed that this was one of the more popular cakes I have ever made! More popular than rich chocolate cakes etc. You will be surprised how wonderfully it turns out and tastes!

Wonderful cake! Thank you!

Made thses for holiday gifts. It is a very good recipe.  I loved the slight cardamom flavor.  I did not have extract so I simmered a handful of pods I had on hand in the milk.  Loved this recipe!

I was really excited to make this, but found it disappointing.  The bread was too dense for me (you can sort of tell in the picture) and dried out rapidly.  I made it for a potluck Christmas brunch and it was not very popular.  If you're craving something similar, I recommend finding a yeast bread that calls for cardamom.  My husband's (Swedish) family makes an excellent braided bread, they call it "Coffee bread."  If you google "Swedish Coffee Bread" you'll find many options.

At first I was only going to give this 3 stars because it was crumbly... But then I refrigerated it and it sliced wonderfully. It must be completely cool or you will have a mess. Nice flavor - I increased the lemon to 1 tsp, personal preferance. My husband loved it, so I guess I'll be making it again!

This quick bread is simply amazing and very forgiving.  I've made it at least 10 times, once with only half the butter, and every time this unassuming cake gets all kinds of praise heaped on it.  And it's a fantastic alternative to banana and zucchini breads, and even easier.

My 5th grader did a report on Iceland and made this cake to share with her class.  It's delicious and tastes like pound cake with hints of lemon and cardamom. It's the first time we've baked with cardamom, and we really enjoyed the flavor. I used golden raisins and 1 tsp. cardamom spice instead of the flavoring.

Very Lemony and Moist. I did the cardamon powder. The extract can be found in large INDIAN stores as I am going to travel next week to get. I am going to try orange peels next time. I was pleased with cake.

Not sure why people have had problems with this cake..................maybe didn t follow directions.  Anyway, love this type of cake the only snag being here is that we do not like cardamon and had to omit it.  Add the rind of a lemon instead and gives a lovely flavor.     When it comes to baking time for cakes I always check long before the time supposed to be used is up because ovens differ.   Only makes and this is also a suggestion to new bakers.

This is a good recipe, however, lacks a little something.

Made this exactly as recipe. It has a very good flavor and had no problem slicing it. I also used grated cardomum.

The flavor was great, but the dough was so thick my boyfriend decided to add unsweetened apple sauce to thin it out a bit. We ended up baking it for about an hour and a half (covering the top with tin foil to prevent burning the crust) and the center was still under cooked when we cut into it. Next time I'll stick to the recipe to see if that helps.

This was more like a coffee bread than an actual cake. It was drier than a loaf cake such as banana bread. I would make it again but add more fruit and nuts.

This is an update on the recipe:  I have made this cake multiple times over the last several years.  I am struck by the number of bakers who complain of poor results.  Only one time did I have a big problem with how this cake turned out.  The critical difference for me was in the size of the loaf pan used.  An 11" pan works really well to get a good bake that is not dry and, just as importantly, isn't soggy in the middle. For those who have had issues with their bakes,  perhaps this one factor will make a positive difference.

Also, if you can locate cardamom extract, it is worth using in my opinion.  I have tried both the extract and the ground spice and while each yields a delicious result, my family and I really prefer the extract -- it seems to have a subtler flavor that balances nicely with the lemon extract, without over-powering it.  

Original review: Loved this cake!  Like some other reviewers, I couldn't find cardamon extract, so I added some ground cardamon to the batter and that worked well  I have also served this cake iced  with a confectioners' sugar glaze. Delicious!

I gave it three stars cause it's too much of baking powder in it. When I eat it, the only thing I taste is baking powder, and little bit of lemon
