I love this recipe. I thought the mayo was a strange ingredient for a dessert but it's so good! I've made this about four times now and it's a hit every time. The only thing I ever do different is to use mixed berries instead of just blueberries and I use frozen berries instead of fresh. When I use the frozen berries I toss them with a little bit of flower so it's not too watery. Try this recipe and you'll be pleasantly surprised!

This recipee has few ingredients, is easy to make and is delicious!!  I loved it!  Here's what I did that made it even better:  I doubled the topping amount and it was fantastic!  The top came out thick and crispy and some of the topping slid down into the berries which made it soft and gooey.  I LOVE this blueberry crisp!

Amazing! I was so afraid of the mayo, I only made a quarter of this recipe (baked it in a mini bread pan), but it was great. Note that the quarter portion is the perfect size if you're doing dessert for two.

Recipe was very quick and easy to prepare.  We enjoyed it very much!  I used last years crop of frozen blueberries and it worked fine.

So Easy and So Good. I used three cups of frozen blueberries and the topping as listed in the recipe. I mixed some of the topping in with the blueberries and put the rest on the top. It took a little longer to cook but I am sure it was because I used frozen blueberries. I asked my husband if he could taste the mayo and he did not know what I meant. I said there is mayo in the blueberry crisp - he said he would have never known if I did not tell him. It was yummy !!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe

We thought adding mayonnaise was wrong on so many levels and only made a half recipe because we were skeptical.  It not only tasted fabulous but was extremely easy to make.

We grow blueberries and have an abundance of them in June...I have to say, this is a terrific recipe...we've already made it 3 times in one month!!  It's great with whipped cream on top, or served over vanilla icecream (or both!) Tips: Don't worry about how many blueberries you use...just fill your casserole dish (leaving room for topping)...if you have 4 or 5 or 6 cups, it doesn't make a difference, and MOST DEFINITELY double the recipe for the topping....you won't be sorry!  I run some of it through the berries and then put the rest on top. I also sprinkled the top with a few tablespoons of sugar before baking...gives it a nice crispy top. LOVE this recipe for the taste, and the simplicity. A KEEPER!! Thank you!

This was super easy and delicious!  I doubled the topping, as others suggested. Also for those who ended up with a paste rather than a crumb topping, you may have mixed the topping too much. I made two batches - one came out pasty and the other crumbly (and much better!). Stop mixing the topping when you have crumbly chunks even if there is some topping left and just pour the whole thing over the berries. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Wow, I can't believe how easy it was to assemble this dessert.  I used frozen blueberries, and it turned out great.  I'll be making it again trying different fruits!

This was GREAT! The mayo is really an interesting ingredient but it crisps up better than butter.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and tossed the blueberries with a bit of flour. I also mixed in 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of lemon extract in with the blueberries. This dish was eaten up very quickly!

I wasn't afraid of the mayo - have an awesome chocolate cake recipe that uses mayo instead of eggs and oil.  :)  I did add 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 c oats, and 1/4 c more mayo to compensate for that.  Also, I used 1/2 c brown sugar and only 1/4 c white (instead of all white).  Baked at 375 for 40 min.

Nice, But I do think it would be even nicer with a doubled "Crisp" topping.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times now and have wowed everyone that's tried it.  I especially like it because I'm not a fan of oats in my crisp.  It's even wonderful cold--which so many crisp toppings are not. I always double the topping. I like making it because the mayo is so much easier to mix in than butter.  (Just make sure you don't overmix and end up creaming it all together.)  One time I didn't have enough flour and used Jiffy mix instead--it tasted great, and now I use half flour and half Jiffy mix.  Also, I dust my berries with cornstarch--just my preference.

Amazing!  I had the whole thing ready to be baked in less than 5 minutes!    I saw a poor review stating that the 'crumbs' were not crumb-like.  So wrong!  I mixed mine with a spoon and had no problems.  My guess is that if you mixed it with your hands and squeezed it too much you would get what the other reviewer described.  I didn't not use my hands until it was time to sprinkle the crumbs on top - results were perfect crumbs!

I wish there were more stars to give this recipe. I never in a million years thought I would be using mayonnaise in a dessert. I only did a couple of minor things different. I doubled the topping recipe and added another 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I baked at 375 degrees for 40 minutes. Perfect recipe. My husband said it's the best crisp he's ever had, and I would have to agree!!

This is actually very good, with a few tweaks.  If you double the crust like someone else suggests, it does take quite a bit longer, about an hour and a half total.  Otherwise, the center is still doughy, good, but doughy!  I did sprinkle sugar and lemon juice on fresh blueberries and then added the dough!  Very nice alternative w/o eggs or butter and if you use EVOO mayo, it's even healthier!!

Wow, I never would have thought to put mayo in a crisp topping, but it actually worked!  One advantage of mayo over butter is that it is much easier to get the crumbly consistency.  WIth butter, I always forget to take it out of the fridge early, and it is too hard to mix properly, or I try to soften it in the microwave and it ends up too melty.  This is foolproof.  We served it with whipped cream on the 4th of July and everyone loved it!

I wasn't sure I'd like this, and hoped I wasn't wasting this summer's frozen fresh blueberries.   It was so quick and easy tho, I had to give it a try for tonight's supper.   It's delicious.  Miracle Whip has always taken the place of mayonnaise in my house, and because I probably only had 3 cups of berries, I cut down on the M.W. using a scant 1/2 cup, but leaving the other ingredients the same.  I left mine in the oven for 50 minutes.  I hope noone asks for the recipe, because I know they will be turned off when I tell them how much M.W. is in it.  I'll definitely make it again tho.

Wow.  This dessert was wonderful.  My picky husband, who doesn't like mayonnaise, ate it right up!  I used 4 heaping cups of fresh blueberries and added about 1/3 C Quaker Oats and a splash of vanilla to the flour, sugar and cinnamon mixture.  The dessert was not as runny as I expected and the crisp was still crunchy the next day out of the fridge!  Delicious served alone but even better with cool whip topping or a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Great dessert, and easy! I changed the topping the second time I made it and it was even better. I add 1/4 cup brown sugar and only 1/2 cup regular sugar. I also added 1/4 stick melted unsalted butter. Wow! I didn't think it could get better but it did.

Perfection! I made it for brunch, and - as I was hoping - it turned out to be not too sweet, and had just the right amount of tart. I used frozen blueberries, but only had 2 cups on hand, so I added 2 cups of frozen cherries. I do think this would be a great recipe with almost any kind of fruit you'd like to use.

I used half as many blueberries (2 cups) but retained the amount of topping and this was delicious. It didn't last long enough to take a picture; that's a good indication of its popularity!

Do not make this with Light Mayo!  At least, I hope that's what made the top a doughy chewy gloppy  mess.  Ended up scraping off the crisp and using the berries alone on top of ice cream.

This didn't work out all that well for me. The topping formed more of a paste rather than crumbs, and baked kind of tough. Blueberries were ok but not quite sweet enough. I will stick to my faithful blueberry cobbler recipe from now on.

maybe it was something I did which was to use 1/2 splenda, 1/2 sugar. The mixture never did get crumbly. I ended up using only half since I was more or less pulling apart a sticky dough in lumps to disperse on the crisp. I tried adding a little bit of oatmeal to make it crumbly..i don't know... don't think i will make again.

This is delicious! I doubled the recipe and used half brown sugar (because I like the richness of it). I also only had miracle whip but it still turned out and you can't even taste it. Like someone else said, I also dusted the blueberries with cornstarch and would definitely recommend doing that. Really good recipe though.. thanks for sharing!

I, too, was worried about using the mayo.  When I mixed up the topping, doubling it as someone mentioned for extra crumbs, seems all I could smell was the mayo....hmmmmm.  But I need not have worried - no mayo taste after baking, and the results were WONDERFUL!!  I did add a dash or two more cinnamon, but that's it.  I started with big, plump, sweet berries, and the extra topping sort of mingled down among the blueberry juice and make it extra good.  As I made it this morning before it got too hot in the house, my hubby had a sample dish with his coffee, and pronounced it YUM!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is great! I tend to double the topping as others have suggested because it is so good. I usually use frozen blueberries since I can keep them on hand for whenever I need them and just mix some of the topping into them to thicken it up. Serve it up warm with vanilla ice cream and you have a delicious, easy dessert.

I expected great things after all the reviews. This is a simple recipe for sure but definitely not anything worth making again. No mix ins to the berries means if you use frozen berries you are going to get soup. Topping is not exciting either. I even tried adding nuts but overall this is not a keeper.

This was delicious!  Mine did not crisp up too well but probably bc I used light mayo and whole wheat pastry flour.  Will try again with regular mayo to see if that makes the difference.  It was still delicious - just more batter-like on top rather than cripy.

To be sure I would not have a doughy crisp, I added 2 tablespoons each of corn meal and oatmeal to the original recipe.  That took care of the problem and I think made it even better!  Delicious!!

I despise mayo, but thought I'd try it because of an ingredient shortage.  I'm yet another believer.  Can't detect the mayo and it was scrumptious!  But that is most of all because of the blueberries.

I am an excellent southern cook, and I did not enjoy this....the topping came out almost doughy, but definitely not crunchy as I would expect Crisp to be. The taste was fine, but the texture was not right. There are better recipes for crisps

Like many others, I was skeptical about the mayonnaise, but it worked out superbly!  A delicious crisp, especially with frozen vanilla yogurt.

Made this today and if I could give this 10 stars, I would!  I doubled the topping, used brown sugar and white 3 to 1 and also added 1/2 cup crushed pecans.  I used chopsticks to mix it to get a good crumbly consistency. Doubling the topping is a must since there is no added sugar in the blueberries. So quick and easy, anyone could make this.  I was done with the topping before the oven was preheated. Out of this world plain, but next time I am pairing it with french vanilla ice cream. Thank you for my now favorite blueberry recipe!

I tried this after reading the reviews and wish I had tried something else.  The "crisp" has a weird "twang" to it, must be the mayo.  I followed the recipe to the letter and will not make this again.

I didn't have any mayo so I substituted Miracle Whip.  Not a good idea!  The topping was gooey and never really cooked.  I'll try this one again with the right ingredients.

This was amazing! I think I had about a pound of fresh bluberries left that I needed to use up; they half-filled an 8 inch square baking pan. This couldn't have been any easier to make and it came out just right; the top was crispy and the blueberries thickened up perfectly. I've substituted mayo for eggs and oil before, but I never would have thought of this; pure genius! I may try other recipes out of curiousity, but this will definitely be my go-to fruit crisp recipe from now on. Thanks ESCAPETONH, this was wonderful!

SORRY but this was more like a cobbler than a crisp. My topping was not crisp but kind of doughy / bready.  I will use COLD margarine or butter next time.

Husband and kids liked this topped with vanilla ice cream.  I was not as impressed.  The topping was like eating way-too-sweet sand, and even with fresh blueberries it was very watery.  Not a keeper, but thanks anyway!

Wow!  I am not a blueberry fan but this crisp is wonderful!  I followed the recipe but cooked mine in individual ramekins (for about 20 minutes) and after reading other reviews made double the topping.  I served them hot with vanilla ice cream and they got devoured by everyone in my family from ages 2 - 55.  So quick and easy to make...definatley a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out.  The topping was just kind of greasy balls of dough that didn't cook through (even though I baked it for an extra 10 minutes).

I feel bad about giving this 3 stars, but the recipe did not work for me.  I triple checked my ingredients and did not make a mistake, but the topping was not crumbly. It turned into a sticky dough. I still tried dropping it on the blueberries, but it never crisped.  I cooked it for 45 minutes and the blueberries were so hot and bubbly.  The topping was still sticky and made it not that appealing.  I'm glad to see others had success because I was really excited about this dessert.

Very easy.  One review said to double the crumb mixture.  I made the recipe as stated then added another 1/2 of the crumb mixture and thought it was too sweet.  Next time I'll make the recipe just as is.  Excellent for a quick dessert.

I used miracle whip light because that was all I had and it made it into more of a batter.... it still tasted good just needed to bake quite a bit long... next time I will try adding oats to the crumb and maybe a little less miracle whip... if this does work it could be a very very low fat dessert

This was wonderfull! You do not taste the mayo at all. I read other reviews and agree you need to have more topping, so I did 1 and 1/2 the topping, which was perfect. My berries weren't wild, so they were a little sour, I just sprinkled a TBS of suger over the berries and let it all bake a little longer than the recipie called for. Turned out perfect, ate with vanilla ice cream and the whole thing was awesome.

Liked it a lot! Very easy. Picked some blueberries and decided to treat myself. I did double the topping and added a tablespoon of butter to mayo. The topping should be sprinkled and then smoothed out. Do not press down which might have caused doughy texture.

Easy!  At a recent family reunion (20 people) we each had an assigned night for meals.  The food kept getting more and more elaborate and I knew I needed a fresh idea for dessert for my night...this recipe was a hit!  DON'T be afraid of the mayo!  I used frozen blueberries and it was fabulous!

I tried this out on family before making it for guests. I wanted to make sure the mayo did not make it taste odd. Wow--very yummy and easy. Definitely a keeper. I didn't change a thing.

This recipe is a keeper. I was so surprised by the flavor because I expected to taste mayo. I devoured the blueberry crisp I made and had to make another one shortly after. Thanks!!

I've made a number of crisps in my lifetime, and this was the worst. I suppose it's an option for those who need to be dairy-free, but for the rest of you, use the Triple Berry Crisp recipe, it's the best. I followed this recipe exactly, other than adding a bit of flour and sugar to the berries. The top turned out granular, like sand. And because there wasn't much sugar mixed with the berries (if you follow the recipe, there is none), it didn't taste sweet enough. Mine was not runny because of the tbsp or 2 of flour I added with the berries. I had to cook this about 70 min. for the top to slightly brown.

I was very scared of the mayo, but I LOVE IT! I will def. make it again! I used brown sugar and added a little oatmeal, but I like the simplicity and the crumble topping mixed really deliciously with the warm berries.

Delicious!  I took my kids to the blueberry farm and wanted something 'quick' to put together for dessert - this was perfect.  Quick and easy....yes I was curioius about the mayo - but it was so good - my 2 y/o said 'yummy in my tummy' - dad and sister said 'you're right about that'.  I've been asked to make it again tonight - I have never made a cobbler twice in a week!

The blueberries weren't sweet without anything added to them, the topping was alright, but as I suspected, I could taste the mayo & it just didn't fit. had to stir it up to make it palatable. I'd much rather use a normal crumble recipe with my precious blueberries...

Made it and loved it! Made a few changes--I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo. I used 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar since I ran out of white sugar. I also added 1/4 c. chopped walnuts in the topping mixture. Plus I sprinkled extra cinnamon and nutmeg on top! YUMMY

VERY EASY and very yummy. I used frozen blueberries and some frozen raspberries, so yummy, I also used light mayo. The topping wasn't crumbly but it was still good, it was like cookie dough so i flattened it across the top, worked just fine. Thank you for sharing this recipe :)

Simple and delicious! Of course, I messed it up a bit by not spraying the pan with canola oil cooking spray. I decided to dump it all out so I could spray the pan. When I did that, much of the topping got mixed in and never got crunchy. The parts that were crunchy had great flavor. For those reviewers who had trouble with the topping coming together, I suggest combining the mayo with the sugar and flour using a pastry cutter. Made quick work of it and I had nice crumbles. Will make again, making sure to keep the topping on top next time.

Really nice! I also used frozen blueberries - defrosted, drained and sprinkled with flour to soak up more of the juice. I could have used more crumble for the top, even though when I was sprinkling it I thought it was too much... Yummers!

My husband hates mayo and most foods with mayo in it.  He loved this crisp!  I needed to satisfy a sweet tooth and had a can of blueberry filling in the cupboard, so I used the canned filling in this recipe and we all really enjoyed it.

This is an extremely easy recipe with most of the ingredients things I had on hand.  As another reviewer suggested, I changed the topping a little; I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added a little (1/4 stick) butter.  Next time I make this (and I will!) I will add something to the blueberries themselves; maybe a pinch of nutmeg or a little sugar.  The topping was great, but the blueberries needed just a little something more.

This is good, but there is not enough topping here! I followed the recipe to the letter and only got about 1/2 the amount of the topping in the picture. This is very good and creative and I will make it again, but will definitely double the topping next time. I used fresh blueberries and it came out nicely.

I had just picked tons for fresh blueberries and I looked up this recipe. I thought I would try it, and it was so wonderful I made it again. I agree that it does need more topping than you make, so add a bit more flour and sugar and it will cover your berries nicely. WONDERFUL and EASY

While I did not detect any special "tang," this tasted good -- and, truly, not like there was mayo in it.  We only had 1 cup of fresh blueberries, but with 1/2 of the topping in a the pan it still served three.  I added a little extra cinnamon as well as one tablespoon of vanilla sugar in place of one tablespoon of white sugar.

Yes, don't let the mayonnaise deter you.  It was a hit at our family barbecue.

We agree that putting mayonnaise in this dessert sounded too wierd.  However, the recipe was too easy to not try it. We love this recipe and have made it twice in a week, once with blueberries and another with blueberries and peaches together. WOW! You must try this with ice cream on top!

I just made this for a dinner party tonight.  Thank you to the author of this wonderful recipe and to the other reviewers for their tips.

I made the following changes/additions:  I used vegan mayonnaise, 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/2 c. white sugar, I added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and I tossed the berries with flour and  2 T. lemon juice.  I think the next time I will add in 1/3-1/2 c. rolled oats.

Thanks so much for the great recipe!

this was really good but I think I needed a little more mayo because my crumbles were a little  dry I did not double crust. I added a little butter on top. Definitely a do over ! I added a pinch of salt to crumbles.

I’ve made this incredibly simple dessert many times and everyone loves it! As others have suggested, double the topping, even though you might have  a smidge leftover. I also add a teaspoon of ginger to the mixture and I always generously top the topping with some cinnamon-sugar for a sweet crunch. I typically get the 2 lb container of blueberries at Costco, and they’re always fresh...and inexpensive. This delicious dessert only takes a few minutes to throw together. Highly recommend!!

I was fixing a dessert for a potluck that was easy and saw this recipe and read some of the reviews. Interesting, but I wasn't sure but decided to try it and the reviews that I read were so true. I changed the cinnamon spice to apple pie spice and also added very thin slices of a juicy apple that I hadn't used. I also had leftover oat flour and date sugar that I added and it turned out superb!!! I just wish that I had made more topping like the reviews advised! Already have plans to make another batch! Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy and tasted great!. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup and I also used 1/2 cup brown rice flour and 1/2 cup regular flour instead of the whole cup regular flour. I used 1/2 tsp xantham gum since i used the brown rice flour. It was still sweet enough. I will have to try this with other fruit.

We loved this! I baked it closer to 45 or 50 minutes. The tang of mayo was perfect with the sweetness of blueberries. One of the easiest and quickest desserts I've ever made! Next time, I will add lemon zest to the filling and maybe increase the topping amount.

Wow! So easy and so good. I will admit that I've never had blueberry crisp before until this because, well, I don't like blueberries. But this may have changed my mind. I will mention that I don't like mayo either. I made this exactly as the recipe read and served with vanilla ice cream for my husband's birthday. It took no time at all to put together and everyone (even my picky kids) were enjoying it so I decided to try a spoonful. Then another spoonful. Then another spoonful. You get the idea. Highly recommend!

Wow!  Fabulous idea and I love mayo.  I will admit that mayo sounded a bit odd but I will never ever ever use a new crust again.  We have since made it with all kinds of fruit and like it best with cherries or a mixed berry blend.

I doubled the crisp portion of the recipe as others suggested and was glad that I did. My husband and I could taste the mayonnaise in some of the bigger crisp chunks. It was a turn-off. We couldn't taste it at all in the smaller chunks, though, and mostly really enjoyed this, especially with vanilla ice cream. He asked that I experiment with an ingredient other than mayonnaise next time. I appreciate the suggestion for using EVOO mayonnaise from another reviewer. I'm going to try this recipe with that change soon!

I love this easy idea of topping and as others I had a messy glob on my hands and did it twice because company was coming like NOW. The topping came out beautiful and the house smells yummy..I think the problem would be solved if I smoothed the mayo before using..Duh, will definitely do over!!! Oops..I hear em knocking, Thanks for sharing! SK

I love this recipe! I had only 3 cups of blueberries and forgot to lower the sugar and it was a bit sweet. Also next time I may adjust the sugar if the blueberries are sweet too. But we still loved it. My grown son, who doesn't like fruit or berry desserts ate all of it!

I was skeptical about adding mayonnaise to the topping mix but it tasted fantastic! I also used a splash of vanilla and extra cinnamon. To flavor the blueberries I put a small amount of sugar and lemon juice over them before adding the topping. Doubled the topping and it was perfect. I served this to company and the LOVED it!

I've made this recipe countless times. It's delicious. Works with any fruit. I usually make a pear one, but I've done blueberry, cranberry, and peach! I don't use as much sugar but I do that with every recipe :] Plus, it was fun to make it for a holiday and after the rave reviews reveal the secret ingredient!

I made this recipe exactly as written. So easy , and the end product was excellent. Mine was not doughy.came out crispy. I was going to add lemon zest but I didn't. And it was not overly sweet.which I like .and I like extra topping so I did make 1.5 times the topping .. My husband liked it but was more excited over spooning extra juice from the pan :)

This was so good that I made it again 2 nights later.  The second time I made it I doubled the crumb recipe and pressed 1/2 into a 9x9 pan, then added only 2 cups of blueberries, and sprinkled the rest of the crumb mixture ontop.  Was delicious!

You have to give this recipe the credit it so deserves. Mayo in a dessert was scary but wow you won't even know it is in there. I used fresh mixed berries. When I think of a crisp I think of brown sugar for some reason. Because of that I did sprinkled some in my topping. This recipe tasted great. You could go with or without the brown sugar and it would taste just as good. Someone said they doubled the topping depending on the texture you are going for that would make for an interesting crisp that I will try next time.

Delicious!!!!  We always have more blueberries than we know what to do with.  I make this with fresh and frozen berries.  I toss the frozen ones in a little flour so it doesn't get to runny.  My husband was really skeptical about the mayonnaise, but like everyone else, he was pleasantly surprised.

Only change I made was using frozen blueberries. I cooked it for an extra 10 mins. VERY good! Simple, nice flavor. I will definitely be making double the topping for the next batch.

Absolutely heavenly! I made it following the instructions exactly and everyone LOVED it. Made it again the next week, doing half brown sugar and half white as some of the reviewers suggested but I preferred it the original way. So scrumptious and easy! Although my husband was semi-grossed out when I told him after he ate it that it contained mayo. :)

Great recipe!!!! So very easy and delicious. I wanted to make a small one so only used 1.5 cups of frozen blueberries but used the entire topping and it was great.  Topping was moist with just the right amount of crisp, I did toss the berries in about a tablespoon of flour first because they were frozen.  This is a keeper!

Delicious and oven-ready in less than 5 minutes. I tried this recipe with no modifications, using fresh blueberries, and it turned out great. The fruit/topping ratio was perfect, the topping was crisp and crunchy and sweet. Best yet it takes only a few pantry ingredients and blueberries. I took a pan to work and it got rave reviews. Excellent warm with some vanilla ice cream.

Simple, delicious. Possibly could be even better with double the crisp topping.

Made the recipe as is, just added a teaspoon of vanilla sugar.. will definitely make it again, but will a) add some flour and sugar to berries so its sweeter and not so wet..  and it could use more crust.. I already ate 2 portions and it came out of the oven 10 minutes ago :) YUMMY!

I have a blueberry crisp recipe, a favorite, that I've been using for a long time.  When I stumbled upon this one, I was intrigued and very curious when I saw that mayonnaise was listed as an ingredient.  I had to try it!  Well . . . it is now my NEW favorite blueberry crisp recipe.  I made it tonight and was totally pleased with the outcome!  Very quick and easy to prepare - and the crisp topping is out of this world.  I won't go back to my old favorite . . .this is a KEEPER!  I used 2 pints of blueberries and doubled all the "crisp" ingredients exactly. It was perfect!

Wow this recipe was surprisingly easy and good.  I used half frozen berries and half very ripe fresh berries, and since I didn't want it to be too watery, I tossed them in a little flour.  

The second time I made this I used less sugar, and it was much better for my taste.  The mayo is surprising, and great since we are lactose intolerant, no butter!  

The topping was not exactly "crisp" but it is a good, quick, and easy dessert.

This is a very easy but wonderful recipe!  I used blackberries since they were on sale, and I was very happy with the results. I might sprinkle a little sugar and nutmeg on the berries before I add the topping next time.

I wanted to surprise my boyfriend after working a long day with a dessert. I happened to have frozen blueberries on hand and decided to give this a try. After reading many of the reviews I decided to double the topping. I added 2 tablespoons of flour to 7 cups of berries in a 9 x 13 pan. I had this ready to go and in the oven by the time the oven preheat signal went off. This is so delicious and so simple to prepare. We topped off ours with chocolate icecream we had in the freezer. Thank you for a fabulous recipe! 10 Stars!!

This dessert is Awesome!!! I was weiry about the mayo, but you would never of guessed it was even in there. I made an extra half of topping instead of doubling and it was just enough, this is a Blueberry Crisp that you will want to make over and over. The only change with baking is that I had to bake it way longer than recipe calls for, I baked about 1 hour and 15 min, the top took a while to brown...

it was definitely good and easy to make.  i doubled the toppings like a few of the other posts said except it wasn't a good idea. the topping was very thick and didn't really "bake" all the way through. it was very doughy and gooey and chewy...and not in a good way. next time i'll just follow the recipe exactly.

I followed the directions except I used a round pan rather than a square pan and all I had was light mayo.  The end result left much to be desired. The overall taste was good but the consistency and look was less appealing. I too got the mushy. very sticky top (not crumbly) that when cooked was, for lack of a better word, hard. Not mushy or crisp. Either of which would have been better.

I tried this recipe to satisfy a midnight dessert craving using only ingredients I had on hand (no eggs, no milk). I am not a fan of mayonnaise - I found it difficult not to gag when measuring it. That said, this blueberry crisp was AMAZING.    The only things I did different - I used frozen blueberries, tossing them in about 2 tbs of flour to absorb some of the excess fluid. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used apple pie spice because I had no plain cinnamon, and the nutmeg in the apple pie spice went really, really well. I sprinkled the top with a cinnamon/sugar (okay, apple pie spice/sugar) mixture, and when drizzled it with caramel ice cream topping when it was on the plate. Absolutely delicious. Probably not the best thing to eat in the middle of the night, but absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I each had enough to satisfy us, and there's still some left for tomorrow.

When mixing the topping, it turned into a cookie dough consistency, so it was hard to spread and never baked through (even after 40 minutes).  The taste was decent, but because of the topping it was more like a cobbler than a crisp.  Hopefully someone can figure out what I did wrong with the topping, so other people can avoid the same mistake.

I did not like the "crisp" part of this recipe - tasted delicious but ... took almost an hour to cook the topping so that it browned a bit.  Might be that I used fat free mayo??

This has to be one of the easiest desserts I have ever made.   Made as written.  Wonderful flavor and light crunchy topping.  Something that you can throw together quickly if company drops by.   A definite keeper!

I made this dish exactly as the recipe states, and while the top did look nice, it was way too sweet and did not compliment the blueberries well. I too, feel like I wasted some precious fresh-picked blueberries on this recipe! I am planning on scraping off the top and using the berries as a sauce on an angel food cake (with a few additions). I will stick with buttery crisps.

I was skeptical but tried it after reading so many positive reviews. I made it exactly as written. This was delicious! The crust is sweet and crisp and the blueberries are perfectly sweetened. My family loved it! This is irresistible with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on the side. I'm saving this  recipe to make again. Thank you!!

thought that mayonaise was a different idea, but decided to try it before I made any comments. It was delicious. Am making two more batches tonite for my neighbors, and am going to try it with cherries. Will let you know how it turned out. Best of all this was quick and easy and I used the berries I had picked and frozen.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The ratings were good and so I made one for dinner.  I found it quite dry and with little taste.  It was salvaged by warming it up and serving with vanilla ice cream. This is a first for me on this site. Will not make this desert again.

I made this for a group camping event.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not change a thing.  I used 'light' mayo.  This was AWESOME!  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and everyone raved about it.  It honestly took 5 minutes to throw together, so easy and yummy!!

So easy to make and delicious! I've made this for a few years now.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe.  A great dessert to make if you need to make something at the last minute because it's so quick to make and I usually have mostof the ingredients on hand.

I have used this recipe for blueberries and for apples.  My hubby did not like it too much, but my 6yr old loves it warm and topped with vanilla ice cream.  I think it is easy to make and tastes great with any kind of fruit.

Very good and easy. I used frozen blueberries and added peaches with them. I did accidently toss in the cinnamon with the blueberry/peach combo itself, but it worked out good. Also used a bit of flour and sugar b.c I used frozen fruit. Me and my husband actually thought it was a little sweet for our prefernce, but that could just be us! Next time I will cute down on the sugar a bit. I also added a touch of ginger to the recipe, too. I made this for a group of ladies and was complement at many times and even asked for the recipe. They couldn't believe it had mayo! I used light mayo, too which turned out fine. others may want to double the topping if they want the entire crisp covered. I will make this again!

I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 AP flour and doubled the quantity so I could put half on the bottom and half on top of the berries.  When I make this again, and I will, I think I will omit the AP flour and add oatmeal.  Who knew mayo could taste like this?  Thanks for a great recipe.

For a super quick dessert that doesnt use eggs, milk, or butter- this isnt bad. But... its not the best either. I am not sure why it had such great ratings. To me, this is more of an "just ok" cobbler and not a crisp. I used fresh mixed berries from the farmers market and they saved the dessert. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it because i had a ton of berries- i also cooked it in a 9x13 pan. I also used low fat mayo (maybe this was the problem??). The topping just sort of stayed doughy and never really crisped up. It was sort of like eating dough balls on the top of really good berries. I think there are better recipes out there for crisps and cobblers and will keep searching....

I love this recipe!  Have made it three times, 1st with blueberries; 2nd with blueberries and blackberries (both were tart, tossed the berries with 1/2 c. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon); 3rd with peaches (tossed with sugar and cinnamon) - every time the results were excellent.  I believe this recipe will be perfect for any fruit.

Not sure if I did something wrong, so I gave this recipe ***, when I really want to give it one.  Really bad.  I followed the recipe 100%, but my topping was never coarse crumbs, it was more of a pasty batter that I just had to blob on top of the blueberries.  It was so thick I could not spread it.  Topping never browned, even after 40 minutes in the oven.  I couldn't even salvage my freshly picked blueberries, the topping just melded into the berries.  Like I said, I followed the recipe exactly, don't know if it was that I used low fat mayonnaise, but others said they did also and it turned out fine.  I would not make this again, total waste of wonderful blueberries.

I made this for a BBQ yesterday and it got lots of compliments! I used 6 cups of frozen blueberries and doubled the topping mixture. I also used light mayo to cut down on the fat. I ended up baking it in a 9x13 dish for 50 minutes. It came out great and I will definitely make it again. One word of warning- don't expect blueberry crisp. This is much more like a cobbler... kind of gooey, which is what makes it so good!

On a scale of 1 to 10, this one rates a 12! Made this yesterday with some modifications recommended by others:  doubled the topping (excellent); added some melted butter (good); tossed the berries with a pinch of flour (not so good - too thick); added about 1/4 cup of sugar to the berries (too sweet) and baked in a 9x13 pan. Overall results: delicious! Next time, I will not add flour and sugar to the berries and will keep everything else the same. This is a very quick and easy recipe that the whole family will enjoy. The topping has an almost cookie-like consistency, which we loved. Hubby could not stop raving about it! And no, there is no way anyone can tell it's made with mayo unless you tell them!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I will make this often.

Who knew mayo could be so easy? I used a low fat version and it tasted great! I used brown sugar per other reviewers suggestions, and next time I might mix in a tad bit of sugar with the blueberries. But I like sweets a lot!

Great recipe.  I used Hellman's Light mayo and used 1/2 cup of sugar as well as 1 teasp. of cinnamon.  This tasted wonderful and wasn't overly sweet.  It takes about 10 minutes to putall the ingredients together.  This one goes into my recipe book

Wow - getting all of my picky family to agree is quite a feat!  Thanks!  I did have to use 1/2 apples and 1/2 blueberries as the blueberries are just too expensive.  It was still wonderful.  The crisp part doesn't brown or get really crispy, but it definately tastes more like a crisp than a cobbler.  I'll be making this again.

I actually think you can definitely taste the mayo in this, which I did not like at all. Also, the crisp part never turned crisp enough in the oven. It sort of stayed mushy. Not a fan. There are much better blueberry crisps out there, with just a little bit of extra work to make a proper topping.

Very easy! Very Tasty! I served this right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. This is a really great dessert if you are short on time.  Or just want a yummy treat!  I thought the mayo was kind of a weird thing to put in here but...this was an all around great dessert.  I will be making this often.  You could really use any type of berries that you wanted and would be great.  The ONE thing I would do differently is make extra topping! It so good with ice cream.Thanks for sharing! "Yum-O"!

I too was very skeptical of the mayo but I have made a chocolate cake that used mayonnaise and it was great so I thought I'd give it a try with a crisp.  I followed the recipe as is and tah dah....what a hit!  It was super easy to prepare and tasted fabuolous!!!  I'll be making this one again.

I was surprised how easy and tasty this was. I made twice the number of topping, added some topping in the blueberries because of tartness, and left everything else as is. It tastes wonderful right out of the oven with whipped topping or vanilla ice cream. 

PS-Blackberries were a hit. I can't wait to try other fruit!

I was sceptical about the use of mayonnaise in this recipe, but believe me, it really is great. Other reviewers had said they thought the topping was too sweet, so I reduced the amount of sugar, and instead sprinkled a little over the blueberries, but next time I'll just leave the blueberries as they are, as they were quite sweet enough. This desert is quite rich and needs the addition of a little liquid cream to help it down. I'll certinly use the topping again, next time perhaps over rhubarb.

When I tasted this it seemed way off balance. The topping was super sweet and the blueberry part was kind of blah...should have added lemon juice and half the sugar from the topping to the blueberries and maybe even vanilla. I'll try it again with these changes and let you know.

This was a no-brainer and so yummy. The only thing I did differently from the author of this recipe is that I made 1 and 1/2 times the topping. Glad I did! Goes to show the best recipes are the simple ones!

All the family loved this! I didn't change anything except use double the topping, as previously suggested. It did make a lot and so next time I will make only about half as much again (not that there were any complaints, just thinking about sugar consumption!)

This tasted like it was so much harder to make than it was - definitely a remaker!

It was good and simple, but was looking for a more complex flavor for my hand picked fruit.

Easy and tasty, used half oatmeal and half flour instead.  Topping turned out like a thick dough instead of crumbly, so that's why I gave it four stars.  It ended up more like a blueberry cobbler.  Next time maybe I'll have to add more flour to get it to crumble.

This was very good! Couldn't taste the mayo one bit! Loved it! I doubled the topping and felt that it was too much. Next time I will make 1 1/2 the topping. Wonderful recipe! Very easy!

I gave this 4 stars b/c I don't think it *quite* compares to a "real" crisp using butter & everything else, however, this was the easiest thing I've made in a long time, such a snap & I always have the ingredients on hand! The mayo freaked me out but I trusted the others & tried it anyway, and my husband was shocked after he ate it & raved about it & I told him there was mayo in it... It was delicious over vanilla ice cream! yum! Will definitely make again!

I used a mix of demerara sugar and raw sugar.  Tripled the topping recipe, but doubled the blueberries.  Turned out perfect!  Sprinkled 1/2 cup of sugar from the topping recipe onto the berries.  Will definitely make again!

This was so wonderful.  When I first made the topping however I didn't get crumbles, I got oooey-gooey paste that was kind of gross.  I started over and for the second batch of topping I used my Kitchenaid mixer and ta-da perfect crumbly topping.  Excellent.  I will have to try with raspberries since I have an abundance of them.

What a surprise!  The mayo really threw me and I'd never have tried this recipe without all the reviews.  It's great!  Have made it twice in the past two weeks ... only thing changed is that I upped the sugar (one-quarter cup) because berries were tart.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Fantastic!  Made the entire dessert in less than 5 minutes.  Put it in the oven and then took it to a friends house for dessert.  I "pulled" it from the oven about 10 minutes early and then baked it off after dinner.  It was warm and served with vanilla bean icecream.  Everyone loved this warm summer dessert!

THIS WAS AMAZING!  I often cook with my two young children.  (5 and 2).  They are great helpers but I try not to use recipies with too many ingredients because it tends to get a bit hectic.  My 5 year old daughter loves blueberries and wanted to bake with them one rainy day.  I found this recipe and was very sceptical because of the mayo.  (She doesn't like mayo!)  But it fit the 5 or less ingredient rule I have!  Well let me tell you I was amazed!  IT WAS AWESOME!  I used frozen blueberries but it didn't seem to matter.  The only thing I would change was I felt there was not enough crisp on the top.  I think I'll make a bit more next time we make it.  This recipe is a keeper with our family of little bakers!  Thank you!

While the mayo in the recipe is what really caught my eye, the taste was superb! It makes sense to use mayo-- after all, isn't it mostly made out of egg yolks & oil? This recipe is also so easy and oh so~good, you'll be trying it with any fruit you can think of!

I only had three cups of blueberries while the recipe calls for four cups, but the recipe still came out fine.  This is one of those recipes that surprises because one doesn't expect such great flavor to come from so few ingredients prepared so simply.  To the contrary, the flavor is just great.  Here's a couple of ways you might benefit from my experience with this recipe:  1) make sure all the water is wiped from the blueberries ... they retain a lot of water and there will be enough liquid in the dish from the water that comes out of the blueberries that you don't want to inadvertently add any more, and 2) when serving the blueberry crisp, mix the topping together with the blueberries ... it provides a better texture and disperses the sweetness even more.  And as others have suggested, you will not sense even a hint of mayo.  I was concerned too, but found out that it's not a problem.  I have had better blueberry crisp but none that tasted this good with so little effort.

This is very good and so easy.  The crumb topping is really good, don't let the mayo scare you off.  I used part Miracle Whip when I ran out of mayo and you couldn't tell at all.  Even better with ice cream!

So good. Doubled the recipes in 11x13in dish and baked for 40 min. Not too sweet like some crisps and I could not tell there was mayo in it. I was scared to add so much but turned out great.

Reduced quantity to 4 servings and used the ingredients to what was listed.  The topping was not crumbly, rather it was paste like. I smeared it over the top and baked accordingly.  It didn't get terribly brown, so I cranked the heat to 370 and left it in the oven for an additional 5 minutes.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and we loved it. I'll make it again but may adjust ingredient amounts.

OMG!!! This was absolutely the best and easiest recipe EVER!!! And like everyone else I was very skeptical about the use of mayonnaise. And like everyone else I discovered that this turns out awesome! Next time I’ll follow some more advice and actually double the topping! It’s that good. Thanks for a great recipe. P. S. Vanilla ice cream on top sure doesn’t hurt either!

I absolutely love this recipe exactly as it is. It is the perfect dessert to serve with coffee for an afternoon get together, can be doubled for a larger group, or can easily be cut down to a smaller portion to have dessert for one or two. I have made it as written, have used frozen blueberries, I have subbed brown sugar for white sugar, and I have doubled the topping... but have never left out the mayo! It may sound weird, but trust me, it’s fantastic!

Ok, I saved this without believing I’d ever really try the *mayonnaise option*. But I found myself needing a pie fast, and had no butter softened for a traditional crumb. Mayonnaise started looking like an obvious option. Unbelievably good (and I never told my mayo-hating teenaged boys anything!). Definitely do put just blueberries in pan first—I thought they’d be too juicy and put them in a graham cracker crust... too dry, and too much ‘crumble to fruit’ imbalance. Great flavor though. Clearly one to make again!

Needs a bit of salt, lemon juice in berries and toss berries in flour or cornstarch before topping so the   the juices will thicken as it bakes. I loved the mayo topping but cut back on sugar by a half cup the second time and served warm with ice cream. I'm going to try adding pecans next time.

I was highly skeptical of the mayonnaise as an ingredient. There were no issues at all! The crust is crunchy and tastes great! I did add 1tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1/2 tsp. I added about 1/3 cup of rolled oatmeal and 1Tbl. soft butter for the oats. This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. Can’t ask for anything more!

The mayonnaise initially scared me, but all the reviewers who said you can't get detect it were absolutely right. And the recipe couldn't be any more simple and foolproof. The only change I made was to double the topping, at the suggestion of many reviewers. It was still ready in 40 minutes. This will definitely become a go-to recipe for me!

I made this for my daughter and son-in-law. My son-in-law had surgery recently and he loves blueberries. My daughter told me they loved it, and it was so delicious with vanilla ice-cream. I mentioned that the crisp had mayo in it. She said she wasn't going to tell her husband. because he hates mayo...haha! Definitely a keeper.

This was pretty good.  The Mayo seems weird but you couldn’t tell there was mayo  in it when you were eating it.  I took it to an ice cream social and had several complements. Next time I will double the topping and cook a little longer.

This was SO EASY and turned out great!  I used 4 cups of frozen blueberries.  Since some folks found there was too much juice, I used the "bakers joy" nonstick spray (contains flour).  Also, I mixed the dry ingredients first and then put half the berries in the pan, sprinkled them with a tablespoon or so of the dry mix, topped with the rest of the berries, then used a little less mayo in the dry ingredients to make the topping.  Over-stirring the crumble causes clumps.  35 minutes was perfect even with the frozen berries.  Truly a find!

Delicious! This crispy, crunchy crumble topping is the perfect compliment to the soft berries. I used a frozen triple berry mix from Costco, thawed. I tossed the strained and rinsed berries in flour and the dish turned out perfectly!

I found that doubling the crumble ingredients was too much for an 8” square pan—increasing  amounts by half again is about right. Don’t skimp on the mayo; however! Also, I was a cup sort of the wild blueberries from our summer home front yard, so I edged two sliced peaches and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Yum!

The fruit portion was way too liquid. I used fresh berries, and even sprinkled on 2 teaspoons of cornstarch before adding the topping.  It was still way too runny.  Tasted good but did not present well.

This Blueberry Crisp was on point! I doubled the crust recipe as other reviewers suggested and swirled the topping throughout the berry mixture. One other thing I did was butter and sprinkled with sugar the bottom of the dish prior to adding the blueberries... Also had about 8 frozen raspberries so I tossed those in too.... Delish??

I've made this several times and each time my family loves it!
I love how easy and quick thIs recipe is to put together. Only four ingredients  that mostly everyone has on hand plus the fresh blueberries. I've used two pints and it works out ok. 
Changes I've made over the course of time?
Make a little extra crumb topping. Maybe just a little more than the recipe, cause who doesn't love the crumbs?
I've also used the Truvia Blend for baking and if I didn't tell you, you wouldn't know.  Simply, good!

OH M.Y GOODNESS. Fast and easy recipe. used about 3/4 of a pint of fresh blueberries While reaching for the cinnamon, I saw my Chocolate Caramel powder and used it instead. Used about 3 teaspoons. Mixed it all together. Was a little leery of mayo, but it was EXCELLENT. Hubby never knew. Mixed up fast. Put blueberries in a aluminum pie pan and  used the full amount of topping. Browned it just a little under the broiler. YUM. Will make whipped cream for topping. Will use this for all fruit crisps!

I did not measure the blueberries but I am sure it was close to 4 cups. I made the crumble exactly as the recipe said and it turned out perfectly. Some reviews said the crumble was like pudding, I used a fork to blend and it was nice and crumbly. My husband absolutely loved it. Will make this again for sure!

I did exactly what reviewers said NOT to do.  Stirred it until it was creamy.  They said stop stirring when it gets crumbly.  Well, it never got crumbly...just a creamy sticky mess.  Anyway I cooked it and we are eating it as to not waste 4 cups of fresh blueberries.  I won't try this one again.

Delicious.  I was looking for a recipe for a last minute dessert that was super simple and didn't require much. I was worried because this recipe didn't call for butter or eggs,  but the mayo took care of that.   I doubled upon the ingredients for the crisp and used fresh blueberries. Mycrisp was perfect.  I will definitely make this again!!

Great recipe, but as I cannot eat eggs, I substituted 50/50 unsalted butter and sour cream.  I also added lemon rind to the crisp for a brighter flavor and cut the sugar down as well.  Came out lovely!

I WILL NOT make this recipe again. What a waste of beautiful blueberries that were hand picked at the farm. I made the recipe exactly as stated. My impression was that the crisp ingredients should not be over mixed, but left as coarse crumbs. If left that way, half of the sugar and flour were sitting in the bottom of the bowl. I mixed it thoroughly and what was left to was similar to cookie dough. I baked it over 45 minutes and it still didn't brown. The blueberries were so runny and the topping was NOT like a crumble or crisp but more like a hard crust on top. What a huge waste of beautiful blueberries!!!! Don't make this one...can't understand the great ratings. As far as the taste goes...it was average...nothing great.

Sounded strange - tasted great! Could probably have put a little less sugar as the blueberries were already very sweet.

I doubled it and baked in a 9x13. I took the advice of others and made extra topping, one and a half because I didn't have enough mayo to double. I also baked 55-60 minutes. This was excellent. So, so easy. I will definitely make it again.

I add more oatmeal for the crunch. I also add cardamon and coriander  as extra spices to the blueberry filling. Don't forget the ginger to the blueberries for flavor.

Like many other reviewers, this recipe does not work for me.  The topping does not form crumbs with the amount of mayo added, it more resembles a batter.  Too much juice from just throwing 4 cups of berries into the bottom with nothing else.

Something went wrong with this recipe. The topping did not resemble course crumbs at all, but was creamy like frosting. I had to double the cooking time to get the topping to resemble crispy. Not sure where I went wrong, but I will not be making it again.

I have made this many times, it's baking right now in the oven, and thought it was time to right a review.   This is absolutely delicious and is a huge hit  with everyone that eats it.  The only thing I change is I make one and half times the topping, I think to double it might be too much for me but strictly by the recipe it not quite enough.  Love this recipe!

I didn't read the recipe very carefully and added all of the mayo at once to the flour-sugar-cinnamon mixture.  Ended up with a moist dough but just put blobs within the berries and on the top.  Turned out very well after all.  Crispy top and moist berries.  Very delicious and lots of compliments on it!

Great recipe!  I only had 3 cups of fresh blueberries.  I chopped up 2 apples and added in the bottom of my dish, then added blueberries and then topping.  I used brown sugar instead of white.  Only challenge was the cooking time was too long with my oven.  Will definitely make this again - an easy great dessert.

Simple and tasty. I cut the sugar a little (for me, I could probably cut it even more). I also made my crumbles on top fairly small; this allowed for some crunchy goodness.  I eyeballed the amount of cinnamon. I also think adding a little vanilla to the crumble mixture might be nice. Very easy to make and really good!

I have made this twice and both times there has been nothing left.   After looking at all the reviews I am glad I doubled the crumble and mixed some in with the blueberries.  I will continue to use this recipe.

The topping was so easy and quick - so much less trouble than using chilled butter and cutting it in. I used an 8 x 8 glass dish with a little more than 4 cups of blueberries, and thought the topping amount listed in the recipe was the perfect amount.

Super Amazing!!!  I used tips from the various reviews, added nutmeg in the crumble as well as half white and half brown sugar, layered the bottom of the pan with fresh & frozen berries and then put double the crumble mix on top with an added sprinkle of brown sugar.  YUMMY!!!!

Nothing wrong with this recipe.  I just prefer a cobbler (or a crisp with oatmeal).  The mayo simply replaces the fat and egg in most recipes.

This is so, so good, as written.  I also made it with whole wheat flour when I was out of regular, and it was so good.  A great way to use my Michigan blubes.

This recipe was excellent!! I used a gluten free flour mix from Sam's Club in place of the white flour, and xyliol in place of the sugar. My husband and I both loved it! In fact, I think I'll be eating some for breakfast this morning... :)

Yummy and incredibly easy!  Short on  butter to make a 'real' crisp, I took a chance on this recipe.  I added in 1 cup of rolled oats, an extra cup of berries and some vanilla --without adjusting the amt of mayo.   While the crisp isn't totally crumbly, as it would be with butter,  I liked the texture and the flavor.  Everyone had seconds.    A keeper.

I, too, was leery of the mayo in a dessert recipe, but decided to trust the other reviewers. . .   Not fully committed,  I halved the fruit and made a full recipe of the topping.  It went together quickly and was delicious hot with vanilla ice cream. Keeper!

Tips:  
- Double topping recipe if u like more of a substantial crisp topping.
- Use real mayo, not miracle whip.  They are NOT the same thing.
- Remember mayo is eggs & oil.  Nothing should be shocking about this ingredient.
- Coat frozen berries in flour or cornstarch to absorb more moisture.

This was fantastic! Followed the ingredients and directions as listed. Wouldn't change a thing. The mayonnaise was great. Made the dish super easy to mix together quickly. My husband laughed when I told him there was mayo in it. I liked how some of the crumb topping settled into the blueberries making them thick like pie filling. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I'm going to share it with my MOMS Club right now!

I baked this for 45 minutes and doubled the amount of topping.  Unfortunately, it never seemed to completely bake through.  It was runny and doughy.  I'm not sure if this is how a blueberry crisp is supposed to taste, but definitely not crispy!

I used half the mayonnaise and about 1/4 cup butter. I also doubled the crumb mixture and used 3 cups blueberries instead of 4. My whole family loves it! I'm not much of a baker but this is easy and yummy!

I love the element of surprise. Had to try this just out of curiosity with the mayo, and I'm sure glad I did. Excellent crisp (and I do mean crisp) just plain delicious. Filing this one away for future use. I used real mayo in this.

This is such a fast, easy, and delicious recipe.  I understood the mayo concept, as it is just oil and egg, so it replaces the usual butter in a topping. The tang of the mayo replaces the need for lemon.
I only used a scant cup of flour, scant 1/2 c. brown sugar, and scant 1/2 c. of mayo. 35 minutes was enough baking time for a delicious dessert.

Delicious. The only changes I made were to sprinkle some fresh lemon juice over the blueberries, add a tsp of vanilla,  and double the topping. I mixed some of the topping through the blueberries, and spread the rest over the top. Delish!!

This was surprisingly good.  I followed to the letter, but next time will cut back in the sugar as the crust, after it sits was a little too sweet.

Very very good, 
when i saw mayo in this recipe at first I was a little uncertain about it but it had a great effect
only thing i didnt like about it was so sweet it gave you little bit of a sore throat other wise it was amazing!

Great taste! there was too much mayo though,so next time I well use half butter and half mayo for the topping.Instead of white sugar,I used brown,and cooked the crisp for 3 minutes longer than what the recipe stated. The topping was dark golden brown, crisp, and crunchy.Will make again!

I doubled the topping and then increased the baking time to 90 minutes as suggested. It came out dried out and the topping wasn't the consistency I associate with Blueberry Crisp.  Won't be keeping this one.

I really didn't like this recipes, and it may be because I had to use Miracle Whip instead.  It was pretty bad.  I gave it 3 stars because the recipe does call for Mayonnaise.

5 stars-this was my 2nd time making it. I used a 16 oz bag of big frozen blueberries 1/2 thawed.One can of Lite Cherry filling,sprinkled some flour and white sugar in that mixture.Did the flour mixture using a pastry cutter to crumb it and stopped when it got to the pea crumbs, and in that mixture I used brown sugar.I doubled this topper mixture.It gave me a good size pan.Yummy! Whipped up some real whip cream! Yummy-yummy!

I am not a huge blueberry person, although we grow them (I end up giving them all away) but I made this for a cookout this summer and everyone LOVED it.  It was gobbled right up, so on that I am giving it 4 stars.  I will make it for guests next summer :)

I love that this recipe is super simple and easy... However, I felt that it could have used just a teensy bit of lemon juice and perhaps a touch of vanilla.  The mayo made it have a lovely tang.  I doubt anyone who didn't know there was mayo in it could tell.  

Like others, I too doubled the crisp portion of the recipe.  Didn't need all of it, (I'd say 1.5X the recipe for the crisp) so made another mini crisp for a friend.  

My children and husband all devoured this recipe!  It is definitely a keeper, and I think I'll try a splash of lemon and maybe a hint of vanilla next time...

Great recipe, but for four cups of blueberries, double the topping or else you end up with lots of berries and hardly any topping.

This was simple, and awesome! I only had a pint of blueberries so I substituted fresh cherries and it turned out great. I cant wait to try this with other berries, I am thinking a blue and black berry mix.

Like other cooks, I thought the mayo was an odd ingredient, but I know it makes things very tasty sometimes, so I thought I'd try it. My husband is gluten free, too, so I thought I would change it up. So here's what I did...

I used frozen blueberries because that's all I had. I dusted them with corn starch (couldn't use flour because of the gluten), and put them in the dish. I used 1.5 times the topping because that's my favorite part! So, I used 1.5 cups gluten free all-purpose flour (Bob's Red Mill), just over 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 3/4 cup canola mayo. I baked it for 35 minutes and it turned out golden brown and WONDERFUL! I think next time I may try adding a touch of tapioca to the filling to make it a little but more firm. It was still a little runny because of the frozen berries.

Ugh! Sorry, the taste was decent but the "crisp" was heavy and doughy. Even more so than a cobbler.

I thought this crumb topping was a good choice with blueberries as it is not as crunchy as some, like the one I use on my peach cobbler which has oatmeal in it. This recipe was liked by all who ate it and I will be making it again.

I.ve made this several times now,  and I absolutely love the crumb topping.   Very unusual ingredients,  but delicious.  It was delicious over blueberries,  but  I also thought it was equally good on apples.   I suppose you could add oats of you like that in a topping.   

One word of caution,   I tried using light mayo in an attempt to lower the fat content,  but I couldn't get the crumbly texture I needed.   Use regular mayo only!

I found the "crisp" came out doughy and did not have a great flavor to it.  I think it would have been better to just do a standard crisp recipe with butter, flour, and sugar.

This is so easy to make! I didn't use mayo,  but instead used plain, fat free greek yogurt and whole wheat flour instead of white. It turned out great! Husband LOVES the texture of the "crust".

So Yummy!  I've made this several times; as written and also with some variations.  It's ALL good.  Definitely double the topping as so many others have suggested - even if you don't use all of it, you'll probably want more than the original recipe calls for.  Here are a few other suggestions that worked well for me:  1) for a slightly healthier version, use whole wheat flour for all or half of the flour,  2) you can cut back on the mayo and sugar by 2-3 tablespoons without anyone noticing,  3) vanilla sugar is a nice touch, or just add a teaspoon of vanilla.  All in all - this is a super easy, super quick recipe that you can customize to your liking, and it's delicious.  I'm going to make one today to bring to dinner at my brother's house!

Like many others, I was shocked how delicious this was! I may double the topping next time per other reviewer's suggestion. Paula Dean may be right about the magic of mayo.

LOVED this! No need to change a thing! Don't be deterred by the mayo, this dessert is wonderful. Great warm with some vanilla ice cream. My whole family loved it, even my daughter who isn't a fan of cooked berries.

Yum, so easy and delicious. Fresh blues are amazing, but I'm sure frozen would work, too. I didn't have quite enough mayo and substituted with some coconut oil and it came out great. Next time I'll add crushed walnuts.

I had some blueberries I wanted to use but didn’t have the ingredients for a pie, so I gave this one a try. I made only a half recipe because the mayonnaise sounded too weird to be good. But it was delicious!   At my husband’s request, I’m making it again tonight. I decided to read through the reviews and noticed all the negative reviews were from people who had decided to make changes to the original recipe. This seems terribly unfair. Make the recipe as written. It’s yummy!!

I didn't find this had a typical "crumble" topping, but it still had a thick crunchy top that I enjoyed. Because I didn't have enough mayo I used some fat free vanilla yogurt, and I also added 1/2 cup of oats to the topping. A very tasty and delightful recipe that I would make again. Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious!!! I added half a cup of rolled oats, that's just a personal preference, and used frozen blueberries - I baked for about 15 minutes longer just because I had the extra time. It worked out great! So quick and easy and impressive. Thank you!

Oh my goodness!  I love the crisp on this. The mayo gives it that just right flavor.  I didn't have enough blueberries so I used a combination of fresh mulberries and frozen blueberries & raspberries.  It was awesome.

I was skeptical as well about this recipe given the mayonnaise, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  My husband liked it, but he is generally easy to please.  I did not like it at all.  I followed the steps exactly, but I felt the mayonnaise taste was too overpowering...I wasn't expecting to taste it at all.  It was too weird of a combination for me.  Maybe if I try it with some ice cream, it might be better.  However, I won't be making this again.

GREAT recipe AS IS! That's hard to find! I've made it over & over again - especially when we have company over. My guests are amazed when I tell them there is mayo in the recipe. You'd never know! I love to serve this with ice cream for one AMAZING  dessert!!

I followed recipe to the Letter, except i didnt just crumble the mixture on top of the fresh blueberries, i mixed it all together.     I agree with other readers on DOUBLING the Crisp Mixture; unless you choose to add ice cream.  Nevertheless, my husband Loved it!

I followed the directions, but this did not turn out for me.  The topping was just some greasy lumps and the berry part was really runny.  I don't plan on making it again.

I followed this recipe exactly but doubled it as I was feeding a larger crowd.  It was SO sweet it actually gave me a sore throat.  I used frozen blueberries and it looked delicious but it made your teeth hurt it was so sweet.

Wonderful! I used a 8x11 dish, and put 6 cups of fresh blueberries, and doubled the topping. But I don't think it needs the double the topping.  One and a half times would have been fine with the extra blueberries. Awesome! So Easy! Thanks!

My boyfriend loved them, me....not so much. We had picked the blueberries from his parents garden a week or so before but had frozen them and when they cooked up they became super tart. You couldn't really taste the mayo but just knowing it was there made it a mental issue for me. If I make this again I'll definitely put some extra sugar in with the berries & I'll probably opt for a more traditional crust. Never hurts to try.

Easy and delicious, what more could you want?  Wondering if anyone has tried it with a light mayonaise?  I thought about it, but then decided to follow the recipe as is.  I think those who had doughy topping might have used a light mayo or miracle whip (which is not mayo).  Anyway, am interested if someone finds a way to do it with light mayo.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe to a "T".  The topping is so yummy I believe I will double it next time.  I don't know if I would call it a crisp but it is awesome you must try.

Probably 4 stars on taste, but this was so easy, therefore 5 stars. Come on, who doesn't have all the ingredients on hand?!?!

This did not turn out the way I hope it would. The topping NEVER resembled coarse crumbs!  I could have turned the dough out and patted or rolled it out! Once done, the topping was hard and extremely crunchy on the top and doughy inside.  The blueberries were swimming in juice.  That is my fault ... I should have realized that and added cornstarch to absorb the liquid.  I am very disappointed!!

This is a great recipe and very simple. The mayo shouldn't scare anyone away! Good mayo is simply egg whites and a good quality oil emulsion and we use these in cakes and baking all the time anyway!

I made this recipie today and it was great!I used freshed pick strawberries and blueberries and I doubled the topping. With thr first taste my daughther and boyfriend both said MMMM Good!My daughther even went so far as to say More Please! They're both picky eaters too, so coming from them that was a great compliment.He and I were both skeptical about the mayo at first but it only adds to the delightful taste. We loved it!

This crisp is fantastic! I had 3 cups of blueberries so that's what I used. I did not double the topping, but I would have if I had used more blueberries. My husband complained that there wasn't enough topping, but I thought there was plenty. I mixed the fresh blueberries with about 3 T. sugar and dotted the top with butter (about 2 T.) before crumbling the topping on top. You cannot taste the mayo, and the topping is very easy to mix and absolutely divine - this is the recipe I'll be using for all my fruit crisps; it would taste great with apples too!

This was super easy to make, but I did find the "crumble" on the top was a little more like a cobbler than like a crisp.  The taste, however, was excellent, and I will make this again.  Probably using brown sugar instead.

This recipe was great! It was easy and soooo yummy with icecream. I baked it for longer than 40 minutes to make it a bit more crunchy. I also used frozen blueberries and it turned out great!

Made this today , went right by the recipe , except didn't measure the blueberries, just used what was in the freezer bag , it was so easy and I loved it . Had to put it in a larger glass pan . Was worried it would spill over in the oven, It didn't.  I will make this again . I'll try this with fresh peaches and Necturines this summer.

I used Plums because I had a ton of them and i didnt like any plum recipes... I too was afraid of the mayo and used half butter half mayo. The tang of the mayo is SO good with the fruit I am sorry I didn't use the whole amount even though every rating said it was good. Lesson learned to trust the ratings! :)

I made this recipe for a church picnic and got lots of great comments.  The only difference I made was adding a thin layer of sliced strawberries on top of the blueberries.

WOW!  Anyone who says they can taste the mayo must have put too much in!  This was fantastic!  We were cooped up in the house today, and hungry...  I did a search for a fruit recipe that needed no milk, eggs or butter (I'm out of all 3!) and found this!  I mixed together some frozen blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, used a little extra flour and turbinado sugar instead of white.  I also added a dash of ground ginger to the topping- placed it all into a 9 inch pie plate.  Turned out fantastic and my bf had no idea there was mayo in it- he loved it!  Will def make this again, and I can't wait to put it all over vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This stuff is great, very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had only light mayo and it came out great. Next I tried using whole wheat flour, extra blueberries, and a bit less sugar and it came out good, but not as great as the first time. If you're on a strict diet the healthier version is definitly edible but the original is definitly the best! Good, easy, very tasty recipe!

This was really good.  Since my husband and I are watching what we eat, I think next time I might try wheat flour instead of white.  My husband loved it!  The only suggestion I would give is maybe double the crisp, or add butter to make it crumble more it is kind of dry.  But other than that VERY EASY and GREAT recipe!  Thank you

I thought this was amazing.  I was able to mix it up and have it in the oven in 5 minutes.  I used part fresh, part frozen(thawed) blueberries.  This is definately a keeper!

I had some extra blueberries so I quartered the recipe to make a single serving size for myself. It was beyond easy and pretty good. I wouldn't serve it to guests though. There are better fruit crisp recipes out there.

Have to agree with others - this is a GREAT recipe!  It is so quick and easy to make - great for a summer night.  Brought it to family members - they loved it.  Was a bit nervous about the mayo - but you cannot taste it at all!!  Will become a summer favorite in our house.

This recipe was so quick and so easy and SO good!  My family agreed that the mayo in this recipe is undetectable, unless you've put too much in, or have psyched yourself out too much about mayo in a dessert and are therefore looking for it. :)  This was probably one of the best crisps I've made and I'll definitely be making it again.

Great way to use up frozen blueberries (or any type of berries).  Very easy to make.

This recipe is super easy and tastes yummy!  I used my "fake" Smart Balance mayonnaise because it's all I had in the house and it still came out great.  I took it to my mom's and everyone loved it. Highly recommended!

has become a quick & easy favorite of ours.  We seem to have a never ending supply of frozen blueberries in our freezer and this turns out great every time. (though it specifies "fresh" berries, it works great)

My kids liked this dessert however I don't have much of a sweet tooth and felt there was to much sweetness and to many blueberries. Even though it was liked by my kids it wasn't liked by all chances are I won't be making this one again.

Defintely double the topping recipe.  I only had 2 cups blueberries so I used 2 cups mixed fruit and I think it made it taste even better.  Super easy and very good.

Very good!  I used 1/2 cup rolled oats and 1/2 cup flour.  I also used only 1/3 cup sugar.  The flavor was great! Thanks for such an easy dessert recipe!

I substituted and doctored this up quite a bit and it still turned out great!  I like more fiber in our food, so used several types of whole grain flours (oat, whole wheat, & corn flour) for half of the white flour.  Also, used half brown, half white sugar (and decreased the amount of sugar by a 1/3.)  Added a good shake of salt and tiny pinch of nutmeg (to compensate for the blandness of the oat and whole wheat flours.)  The reason I decreased the sugar in the topping was that I tossed my frozen blueberries with tapioca and sugar (to be sure the filling would set up a bit) and the juice and zest of one lemon (to make sure the blueberries had enough zing.) Anyway, point is, the recipe turned out fantastic, in spite of my many modifications.
