Made this for dinner in order to avoid turning on the oven in the heat. I made it per the recipe, except I used toasted sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil. It was a good amount for my husband and me. Yummy!

this dish turned out tasty.  The corn starch glaze wasn't the most attractive thing and I will cut the sugar to at least half next time as it was way sweet.  It was definitely tasty enough to give another try though!

This had a very bad flavor.  I think it was the housin sauce in the lo mein.  It tasted like black licorice.

Very good recipe with ONE exception.  It tasted too sweet for me (but good), so I would suggest about HALF the sugar it says to use.

Very good, quick and easy.  I agree with cutting the sugar, and I used Teriyaki in place of the Housin sauce.  I added a stir fry vege mix...  perfect!

The sauce is spot on for takeout shrimp Lo Mein! I used vegetable broth since I don’t eat chicken, and I added some frozen “stir fry” veggies with the shrimp to make it more like the takeout place’s recipe I was craving- It is a perfect takeout substitute.

I sautéed an onion instead of using green onions, used Splenda accidentally in place of the sugar, and added snow peas. We liked it, sauce was a little sweet , maybe because of the Splenda, so will probrably cut back a bit.

This was great! Increased to 6 servings except hoisin, only used 2 Tbls, added broccoli, carrots and celery and used low mein noodles instead of spaghetti. I also added a dash of ginger and sesame oil and used 2 Tbls of honey instead of sugar. 3 of us ate the whole thing :)

Delicious. I cut down the sugar and did not add cornstarch. I added about a tablespoon of the sauce to the cooking meat to add flavor. Then i added chopped broccoli, carrots, and some snap peas.

I cut down the sugar to 1 tbsp and it was still too sweet, but SO tasty! I drizzled some sriracha on it as well and threw in a bag of stir fry veggie mix. I will definitely make this again (with probably 1 tsp of sugar) and it would also taste great with steamed rice instead of noodles.

I made this twice in one week when I told my grand daughter I made this on a Tuesday she came over on Saturday so she could make it with me, both times it came out great, the only thing I changed was I did not use as much oil as the recipe called for because  I used my copper pan and I skipped the cornstarch it was perfect

I made this recipe as is. My kids love lo mein and they did not like this at all. It was way too sweet; the sugar was unnecessary. It could have benefited from some sesame oil.

It was great! I used angel hair pasta and cut back a little on the sugar as suggested by others. A definite keeper and it's been a long time since I've found one on this site.

It was very easy to make.  I added too much sauce and it was a little soupy.  Next time I will add to taste.

Tried this recipe and added French cut green beans and 3 cut up chicken tenders.  Tastes great just like my favorite take out. Just one serving was very filling.  I will do this again.

This is a tasty little dish that has a nice, clean flavor.  I would probably use a little less sugar the next time but it was still very good.   Everyone enjoyed it.

I used less noodles and added steamed broccoli and carrots.
