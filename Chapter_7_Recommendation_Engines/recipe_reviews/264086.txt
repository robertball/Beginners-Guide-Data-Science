This was really good.  Due to adding the soy sauce at the end, I would recommend not salting prior. Add some crunchy chow mein noodles and delicious!!!

This will definitely be added to our regular menu. Very versatile. Used cocoamino instead of soy sauce. Came out great. Served with an over easy egg on top, and we loved it. Scrambled eggs for the kids mixed in well.

As written, I'm sure this recipe is still as amazing as the one I made with my modifications. These were minor.  I substituted liquid aminos for the soy sauce (1. I had it on hand; 2. slightly lower sodium content), and I could only find a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix so I added the whole thing. Otherwise, to the letter on this recipe. I served it with cauliflower rice and sauteed mushrooms. Sprinkled a few sesame seeds on top. Heaven! It went together very quickly. Holds well in the refrigerator.  My mind is whirling with ideas on how many different ways I can serve this - over cauliflower rice with a poached egg, in lettuce cups, in coconut wraps, over zoodles, a little egg and some almond flour for binder then cook them up in patties....oh my! Go make this. Thank you Chez Gnar.

Delicious! I used pork and topped it with a tiny bit of fried wonton strips -which I know isn't Keto! Don't yell at me... But it was very tasty. It was just the right amount of spicy and I will make this again.

Super easy and delicious! Full of flavor. I used fresh ginger (since I had it) and added a little extra Sriracha to the top of my bowl. So good!

This is an absolute!  I had pork roast leftovers, exactly 1.5 lbs - all fat removed. I made sure it was “chopped” but followed the recipe otherwise. Absolutely incredible!!!  I will DEFINITELY do this again!

Fixed in 20 minutes for lunch.  Delicious.   I didn’t have Sirachi so added Fish sauce.   Next time I’ll add Sirachi and definitely add Fish sauce.   Reminded me of the first time I went to a Vietnamese restaurant!

We substituted shredded cabbage, carrots and celery for the coleslaw mix, since we had them on hand.  This was excellent and we will absolutely make it again, maybe with a different meat for variety.

I had to leave out the chopped onion since my picky granddaughter was with us and just sprinkled the green onion on our servings. We served it over rice (I wanted quinoa, but kiddo didn’t) and all liked the dish. It was a little too oily so I’ll reduce the amount of sesame oils next time. It was also missing a little of the Asian flavor I was looking for, so I’ll also add Hoison sauce next time. The soft egg over the top suggested by other reviewers sounds delish too! I’ll try that with the leftovers.

Decreased to 1lbs of beef since that's what I had on hand, but this is a great base recipe! I think next time I'll add some shredded carrot  and toasted sesame seeds too.

*edit* Made this recipe a second time, still using 1lbs beef, but instead of using pre-packaged coleslaw mix I shredded my own cabbage. Trust me, if you have 5 extra minutes, shred your own cabbage! It's cheaper per ounce and the texture was almost buttery but still had crunch! This is such a simple recipes that subtle changes like that can really elevate the quality

I will certainly be making this again.  I did make a few changes only due to what I had on hand.  I was a little short on green onions, I also used 1 Tbsp of fresh ginger instead of 1/2 tsp. ground, I also only used 1 lb. of ground beef, which was more than enough.

Not bad, not great. I gave it 4 stars because it was tasty but just a little bland for my liking. I prefer having ground beef and throwing together my own spices, and veggies. Was worth trying out though

This was absolutely delicious. I have tasted the inside of egg rolls before and this was way better. I never thought a keto recipe would taste this good. Even my kids liked it. I made the recipe exactly as written. Perfection.

I made it as published. Absolutely going in my favorites box. The recipe doesn't specify, but I used toasted sesame oil and used it liberally.  Served it with some hot mustard on the side.

Delicious! I made a few changes. I used shaved beef instead of ground beef and served it with a fried egg (runny yolk) on top similar to a Korean burrito. So good!

I didn't use the sriracha as I do not like spicy foods. I also did not use the ginger because I did not have any. It was absolutely amazing. I ate it for dinner a few times and lunch. Definitely will be made again.

Good base recipe.  I didn't have any hot sauce, so I ended up putting in a splash of balsamic vinegar and about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I'll make this again.

This was very good. I used 1 pound ground beef and 1 head of cabbage, which I fried separately and then added to the beef . I also doubled the ginger. Hubby loved it!

This dish was great!  While on Keto, I've been looking for food alternatives and this is one of those.  I've made it twice now and loved both versions.  Everyone in my household loved it.  The first time I made it was the recipe as written.  The second time I used pork and beef, and also upped the Sriracha and the soy sauce just a tad.  The second one was outstanding!  Don't be afraid to experiment with these recipes, you might make a masterpiece.

I made this dish, added some ingredients suggested by other reviewers, and it was delicious. I simply added sesame seeds and hoisin sauce. I used ground turkey meat, 80% lean. It was simple to make and I like that you can play with the recipe. I will definitely make this dish again. Enjoy!

I love this! I made a coupe of minor adjustments- rice vinegar instead of apple cider, cooked a bit longer - but I dig the flavors and it’s now on rotation on our meal prep planning. I serve it over chow neon noodles for my husband who wants a little heartier meal and it’s perfection.

I added a can of chopped bamboo shoots at the end and used rice vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar and added a little more than the recipe. Next time I will make it with more cabbage. The recipe did not mention draining the fat from the meat after cooking but I always do that. Will definitely make it again.

Easy to make and taste was nice. Hubby thought sriracha made it a  little too hot. I liked it and didn't think it was too spicy. Definitely needs the egg on top to make it good. Will probably make again.

This has a lot of flavor! I'll make a larger batch next time so we have more leftovers. I think I liked it even better reheated the next day for lunch. I used olive oil instead of sesame and used half ground turkey and half sausage instead of the beef. I would like to try beef next time. I will also add more cabbage next time. The only complaint was from my daughter because she thought it was too spicy. I might cut the amount of Sriracha in half for her sake.

I am a vegetarian but made this for my husband he liked it a lot. I sautéed celery with the onions and garlic to make it go further & added water chestnuts. It was fast and easy. He added more siracha to his taste. If you prep all your veggies the day before could have supper on the table in 30 minutes.

The first time we made this we used ground turkey. The next time we used ground pork and tonight we are using ground chicken. We are so happy to have found this recipe. It is definitely a family favorite.

This was fantastic! I substituted the cabbage slaw with power slaw. For our non-keto kiddos, I will serve over rice next time. 

I think you could also add water chestnuts for non-keto and sesame seeds or peanuts if you wanted to add a little crunch to it!
This really was super tasty as is, very easy to make, and we will definitely be making this again.

11.9.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/264086/keto-beef-egg-roll-slaw/ ... For this girl, too much vinegar.  I used rice wine vinegar, unseasoned.  Easy fix - well, for next time.  :D  'Had leftover cooked chicken so added that.  Stir Fries are flexible.  I'm glad I tried.  The more I had, the better I liked.

We loved it!  Very delicious!  My only complaint was that mine came out a little more oily than I liked.  I probably should have used a leaner ground beef.  Other than that, it was awesome! :-)

I used 2 lbs of meat.  No specific reason other than they don't sell 1/2 lb packages at the grocery store.  And I mistakenly picked up the beef and pork mixture.  It still came out awesome.  Will make it again.

this was pretty tasty and very quick to make.  I didn't use full soy sauce(no soy allowed strict Keto), so I used Tamari(ok for dirty keto.)  I didn't saute' in the sesame oil but added it for flavor at the end.  i thought 2 tbsp seemed like a lot so against my better judgement I went ahead and added it but would definitely suggest to add slowly to taste.  By adding another tbsp of ACV, it helped balance it out.  Don't skip the ACV; it really lends something to the whole recipe.  used fresh ginger; fresh so much better than powdered for the true flavor to come through.  I could easily see this as a vegetarian dish by meat omission.  I personally want to try it with shrimp next time.  will definitely make again when wanting something quick, yet getting the fiber from the veg.

I added a small jalapeno the second time I made this recipe. Even my hard to please 87 year old mother like it both times I provided it.  The first time I made half the recipe in case I did not like it.  Since I am considering a Keto diet this is a first effort towards that goal.  I'm emailing the recipe to my sister. Oh, I bought wrappers to make spring rolls the second time around.  I think next I would like to try the actual egg roll but of course that would negatively impact the Keto aspect.

This was fantastic 
For extra carbs could put over rice or use for taco meat or even wontons.
Will make again!

Very delicious!  I added a little sweet chili oil on the top and it was fantastic.  It gave me the "egg roll" taste without the fried wrapper and extra oil.  Will definitely be making this again and again!

Very good, but will add a bit more seasoning next time. I used ground pork, and will try with ground beef next time.
