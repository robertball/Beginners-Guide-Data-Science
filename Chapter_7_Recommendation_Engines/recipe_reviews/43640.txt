I am from New Orleans and this is exactly the way we make stuff bell peppers in the Deep South.  This recipe is great - excellent, excellent, excellent!  To help out some of the folks who is saying that the stuffing is dry do not drain the fat when you brown the ground meat.  This is what makes it moist.  If you do not want the fat included then you must substitute with another liquid (i.e., beef broth) before adding the stuffing mix.  Remember to slowly add the amount of stuffing mix for the texture or consistency you prefer your stuffing to be.  I hope this helps!

Flavor is terrific!  To fix the dryness, try a few of these (you don't need to do them all):  boil the prepared pepper halves for 2 or 3 min first, and let them dry while you prepare the rest (this prevents them from simply being sponges).  Second, leave out the file -- THAT is a sponge, and adds little flavor anyway.  Third, I mixed in about 3/4 can of Campbell's Tomato Soup (condensed) into the mix before stuffing (you could also use a small can of Zesty V8).  Fourth, if you place the halves in a 9x13 dish to bake, just add about a half inch of water to the bottom of the pan -- that keeps things moist.  I used options three and four, and loved it.  Thanks!

I think this recipe has alot of potential.  We made it last night and the stuffing mixture was very dry.  I reread the recipe and there is no liquid at all to bind the stuffing mixture together ie chicken broth, eggs, etc.  Next time I will add some liquid.  Also it would be great with a creole cream sauce or a spicy tomato sauce as a base.  It is definitely worth another try. Thanks.

This one is a keeper. I changed a couple things. I changed it for 2 servings and still had a ton of stuffing. I omitted the file powder, and 1st I browned the hamburger, when almost browned, I added the celery, green pepper and I used shallot instead of onion. I used cornbread stuffing...just what was in the cupboard, and halved red peppers to stuff...topped with shredded cheddar and the bread crumbs. Oh and I added beef stock to the stuffing for moisture.....it was soooooooo good! I served it as a side to Creolized Stuffed Chicken Breasts...a recipe on this site that I highly recommend.

This was a great meal.  After reading the recipe twice and reading the 1st review I paid extra attention to the end of step #2 (Stir in the stuffing mix) and what it says in the notes below step #3 (The stuffing is fully cooked before putting the stuffed peppers in the oven.  Be sure to pre cook the stuffing before mixing it in and this is a very moist delicious meal.

This is a wonderful recipe. I did make a few changes to "cut down" the servings. I also used very lean ground beef and Italian Sausage (50-50)The sausage comes in reg,mild, and spicy. I used spicy. I also cut the tops off the peppers at an angle close to the stem, remove the seed pod and when I finish stuffing the pepper I take a slice of cheese and seal the hole just under the edges of the hole. Then I replace the top and cook. The cheese keeps the juices and mix in the pepper and adds a little flavor as well. It also makes for a plesant presentation. I also cooked them on the stove top making a little more sauce to set them in and cover the pot until done. place the pepper in the middle of a plate, pour sauce over the top. Enjoy.

Made this tonight and have to say it was *much* better than the run of the mill hamburger/tomato mixture.  I did change a few things though:  I added extra celery, 3 TBS of garlic(the kind from the jar), 4 tsp of creole seasoning and instead of the stuffing I added cooked rice in chicken broth - prior to cooking it was 2 cups)  Then I added almost a cup of water so it wouldn't be too dry and 4 eggs for a binder ---- it was so YUM!  It was a definite do-over!

OK!  i have used this sight for years,  i always thought that i should comment on some of the recipes, but never did.  This recipe changed my mind.  WOW!!  It was easy and quick to make, the flavor was excellent!  My personnal taste i would add kyane pepper to give it that southern zip.  i used also used cornbread stuffing mix. and the ham gave it what it needed.  Great Job!!

I was born & live in New Orleans and was looking for a good recipe.  I gave the recipe a good rating because it was a great GUIDE for me to make great stuffed peppers.  However, I had to add my New Orleans touch.  I added crabmeat (claw)  to the recipe and MORE season than requested (creole season, onion powder, garlic powder, I did not use salt & pepper). Taste your stuffing mixture to see if you have enough season to your liking.  DO NOT drain the fat from the ground meat ( It will cause your stuffing to be dry ..if you do, add some chicken broth to the mixture to give moisture or if you blanch the peppers use the water from that. Here in New Orleans, we do blanch (boil) our peppers first before stuffing them.  I also add a tiny bit of water in my baking dish then place the peppers in to bake. Next time, I will add     Jimmy Dean's breakfast sauge to the recipe. That is a SECRET ingredient we add to our peppersin N.O.  I followed this recipe and it was great guide.. ***If you add Jimmy Dean breakfast sauge you may not want to use as much groundmeat because it will make a lot more stuffing unless that is what you want :)

This was a great recipe. Wait until you have a hungry crowd or scale the recipe down. This made more than 12 servings for me. Here's a few tips my mom gave me on my final product.  If you're looking for more flavor, you can half the amount of ham and use smoked sausage instead.  Don't add all the stuffing, add what you need and balance it with a little beef broth and water. Also, play with your seasoning blend according to your tastes.  Boil you peppers before baking, because some people may eat the pepper also.  Lastly, toast your bread crumb in a little butter before topping you final peppers.  It will make them nice and brown on top (I didn't do this and they looked blah and uncooked on top).

These Bell peppers were awesome, the only thing I did different is boil the bell peppers before stffing them so they would be tender enough to eat.

I had to doctor it up a bit. I also am from south Louisiana, but we make them a little different. The mix had a decent flavor, but needed some moisture. I added rice (as we always do in my region for stuffed peppers), extra garlic, a little tomato sauce, a little chicken stock (didn't have beef), and a lil extra bread crumbs (as I didn't have bread stuffing to start with). I took others' advice and blached them ahead of time, then topped them before baking with a sprinkle of bread crumbs and some cheddar cheese crumbles. The family liked it, but I wasn't very impressed.

I've made the peppers on two occasions now and both times my husband just loved them.  However I find not use file powder and I sub'd the stuffing mix for white rice. I also added cayenne pepper to taste.

My bf is from New Orleans, and I knocked his socks off with this one!! He says they are the best peppers he has ever had!! Be sure to blanch the peppers before suffing them, and add an inch of water to the bottom of the pan while cooking to ensure they will be very moist. AWESOME!!! THANKS!!

Thanks for adding this recipe. I too am from New Orleans and was in search of a Stuffed Bell Pepper recipe and this one popped up. I made it and it so reminds me of home. Instead of halving the peppers I kept them whole and it made 6 portions instead of 12.

Made this dish and they were gone in minutes -- really, minutes! I had a version  of this in New Orleans for Thanksgiving and this was as good or better!  This is a great recipe with a few modifications: 1) use only 10 oz of cornbread stuffing; 16 oz is too much; 2) Use spicy smoked sausage instead of ham; 3) do not pre-cook the peppers - they stand up better when filled if uncooked-no one eats the peppper -just cut the top off instead of cutting sideways; 4) added 1/2 can beef broth and 1/2 can cream of chicken soup for moisture; 5) used 3 cloves of garlic; 6) used cayenne pepper instead of file (didn't have file); 7) used season salt and italian seasoing instead of creole; 8) eliminate extra salt and pepper; 9) used 1lb beef and 1.5 lbs medium shrimp.  Outstanding recipe!! Will make again this weekend.

I read that these come out a bit dry as written so I added some broth to the dry stuffing.  I also omitted the beef and ham (I don't like meat) and file powder (what is that?).  But otherwise...a substantial sidedish with a nice kick.  Thanks!

That took care of the dryness. when it came out of the oven .perfection!!!! thanks for the recipe, N'Awlins in the house!!!!

Bravo! Great recipe, and love that you can pretty much substitute amount/types of meat/stuffing to suit your taste. Husband LOVED it. It took some effort to prepare it all, but it was worth my time...not ALL lengthy prep meals are worth it...this was. Took advice from others and blanched the peppers so the bake time was shorter.

I love this recipe! It was simple yet delicious. Instead of using ground beef I used ground turkey. I also added green onions to the veggies at the beginning. Before cooking in the oven I topped the peppers with bread crumbs and a little sharp cheddar cheese. Blanching the peppers was a fabulous suggestion, these were ready in about 25 minutes! Will definitely try again!

Very tasty!  We were eating the "stuffing" right out of the pan.  I did add water to moisten the stuffing mix in the recipe and it helped with dryness.

Great flavor combo! These are pretty dry as written. Consider cutting back on the amount of dry stuffing and/or adding broth to moisten it. I did both and added a wee bit of parmesan under the breadcrumbs. I made these with red and orange peppers, but I did add green pepper to the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I changed a few things. I love shrimp but I am the only one in my family who do.  So I used ground turkey as my only meat.  For more filling inside I used cabbage and rice and cheese.  I also used homemade bread crumbs that I keep in the freezer for when needed.  I didnt use just green peppers either I used all colors. It was great.

I didn't care for this recipe. I'm from South Louisiana as well, but these aren't like any stuffed peppers I've ever had. The flavor was an odd mix, like the cook couldn't decide whether to make stuffed peppers or gumbo. I won't bother to change it... I'll just start over.

Loved this!! Made this for a group of friends and they raved about it! 
I used 12 oz. of stuffing so it wouldn't be as dry, blanched the peppers before cooking, and baked it with about 1/4 in. of water in the bottom. It was definitely moist, and perfect when reheated for leftovers. 
I paired it with some Cajun Dirty Rice and cornbread... a new favorite meal!

The stuffing was dry. Added some chicken broth about 1/2 way through the baking. Good for leftovers. Will make again.

I only had 2 peppers on hand, so I cut the recipe by half and put the extra filling around the peppers in the casserole dish.   Hubby gave thumbs up! :-)

I was looking forward to making this dish because I love stuffed peppers and thought that it would be delicious. I'm sorry to say that it turned out to be dry and not very good. I followed the recipe exactly and even tried to recover it by adding more olive oil, but it didn't work. I would give it another go but it was a bit costly and time consuming to be experimenting. Thanks for sharing anyway. :)

This recipe is really good; however, for added flavor I used Italian Sausage instead of ground beef. I did not use File. I blanched the peppers and did not drain the stuffing which did reduce the cook time and added a bit of moisture to the peppers.

My DH loved these peppers. I used fresh parsley instead of dry parsley which bought out the flavors tremendously. I added medium shrimp instead of baby. I used ground chuck but i think 80% ground beef should be used for more of the beef flavor to stand out. The salt isn't really necessary. I also used a half of can of cream of chicken and a half a can of chicken broth just for moisture. It was awesome.

Made this tonight and it was a hit!  AND this is such a great recipe that it's good even if you're missing a lot of main ingredients.  I didn't have Ham, didn't have Shrimp, didn't have celery or the File Powder.  Still delicious.  This one has been printed and is now in my "keeper" book.  Next time I'll plan ahead and purchase all called for ingredients.  I can't wait!

Lots of potential, but needs a little "fixing up".  The stuffing was dry, and the amount of bread crumbs is too much, maybe about half is good.  I "remade it with a blend of a creamy white sauce and a tomato based sauce, and it was really good then.

These were awesome!!  Much better than the usual beef and tomato pepper I've always had.  Surpised at how moist they were considering the amount of breading used, but they were delicious.  Great recipe and will be making it again.

I cheat with Stove top stuffing. I enjoy that flavor and it's quick and easy. For the meat I use crabmeat, baby shrimp and Jimmy Dean pork sausage. I blanch my peppers before stuffing and reserve the liquid for the stuffing mix.

If you follow the directions and cook the stuffing first [as moist as you like it].Blanch the peppers. Season to your liking ,this is much better than the hamburger, rice tomato stuffed peppers everybody makes.

Reminded me of stuffed crab rather than stuffed bell peppers, I guess because of the shrimp and I think if I make this again I will leave those out.

These were great!  I made a few changes.  I had half the stuffing mix, so I supplemeneted with mashed potatoes.  I used Campbells Creamy Tomato soup to add liquid (having read other reviews).  Next time I'd like to add some corn.   I will definitely make these again.

I was truly looking forward to this based on the reviews and it was ok.  Thanks to others I used only 1/2 the stuffing and moistened it first.  I ended up using a lot more Creole seasoning.  It is dry and needs something but was a good start.  Also the prep time of course is longer than 15 minutes.

I thought these peppers were delicious! I made them for about 20 people, and although next time I might spice them up a bit more, I thought they tasted great. I read a review that said that the stuffing needs to be made (meaning cooked) before adding to the meat and veggies, and that made for a moist filling, because you can make the stuffing as moist or dry as you want, depending on how much water you add. I also used the seasoned stuffing mix because I couldn't find the plain. Also, I flash boiled the peppers before baking and only baked them for 30 minutes.

OMG!!! This was amazing and EXACTLY what I remember from home! Since relocating to Huntsville after Hurricane Katrina I search the web constantly for "Nawlins" style dishes. 

This year my husband and I hosted Thanksgiving. My husband and my in-laws are all from up north so I had to represent my culture (Creole) and city. This was a GREAT, the ONLY change I made was draining the fat from the beef and replaced it with beef broth (I tried to cut calories anywhere possible). I didn't measure, just eyeballed it. Well... I did add a cap full of Zatarian's Garlic and Onion Crab Boil for a little kick. EVERYONE loved them...

I loved this recipe so much I will make it for company next time. It is definetely going to become part of my family's cookbook.
I used 6oz instead of 16oz of dry seasoned stuffing mix. I assumed it was a print error since stuffing comes in 6oz or 12oz packages not 16oz. Next time I will add some liquid to it to make it more moist.
I used Emeril Lagasse's Essence recipe for the creole seasoning (you can find that on his website). The recipe had a lot of flavor and I loved it just the way it came out. But if you like things spicy you should add a little more Creole seasoning or spice it up some other way.

This recipe is very accurate to how we make stuffed peppers in New Orleans.   To fix the dryness, cook the meat half way before stuffing the peppers.  Allow them to finish in the oven.  Freezing the cleaned bell peppers helps the pepper cook better. The oils in the meat and moisture in the peppers will make them the perfect texture.

Absolutely loved this dish! I'm an amateur when it comes to cooking so I am always looking for simple dishes to make.  This recipe proved just that for me.  I substituted andouille sausage for the ham, added extra creole seasoning, added rice, and topped with cheese and these peppers were PERFECT!  I will definitely be making these again!

This is a great recipe. The only thing that was left out was that the water you boil your bell peppers in should be use to pour in the stuffing to make it moist. Then you stuffed the peppers.

The recipe was amazing, but I definitely wished that I had read some of the reviews first. I think that adding either the chicken or beef stock would have avoided the "dryness." Otherwise, seasoning was perfect and all my housemates loved it! It will be my contribution for the next potluck I attend.

I made this recipe exactly per the instructions and it was so bland and void of taste. The seasoning recommended is not enough and the stuffing mix made the entire filling mushy and tasteless. I'm sorry to say I would never recommend this to anyone....:+(

It was a hit!  I used ground turkey and turkey sausage in place of the beef and ham to make it a little more healthy and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

These peppers are delicious. I didnt add the file powder but I kept everything else pretty much the same. I used Chicken Flavored Stove Top for the stuffing mix but I didn't add all of it. 'm from New Orleans and this is pretty much how we do it. 5 stars.

These are awesome! The stuffing alone makes for pure deliciousness...I am going to play with it and add some andouille next time and maybe some other things...not that this needs any changes! Try them once & you'll love 'em!

This were good, but not quite as good as other stuffed pepper recipes I have used, and I'm not sure why. Maybe I prefer them with tomato. Not sure. Anyway, like others, I added the dry stuffing until the mixture had the consistency I wanted, and then I added some canned beef broth for a little moisture. Not bad. Thanks!

I have to agree entirely with Kathi's review- too dry.  While preparing this recipe I was thinking what holds it together and where's the liquid?  As I suspected, the end product was dry and crumbly.  Taste was great.  Since I froze 1/2 of the recipe, I will include at least one egg in the stuffing add a tomato-based sauce or something else to make more juicy.

I am from New Orleans and I was afraid I wouldn’t find a recipe online for the way we make stuffed peppers, but this one was perfect! I don’t eat stuffing so I didn’t want to take any chances of ruining the dish with the taste of stuffing, so I used whole wheat bread (about 6 slices broken up into small pieces) and the plain breadcrumbs inside the meat mixture. For my creole seasoning, I used River Road Creole Seasoning (this one added a lot of flavor) and Tony Chachere’s. The mixture was nice and moist as I did not drain the fat when you brown the ground meat. As another reviewer mentioned, remember to slowly add the amount of bread/breadcrumbs for the texture or consistency you prefer. I have saved this recipe because I will definitely  be using it again!! LOVED IT!! Thank you =D

I am not normally a fan of stuffed peppers, but my husband and I love cajun cuisine so I thought I would give this one a try since I have a bumper crop of bell peppers right now.  I did not have fresh parsley so I sprinkled some dried into the mix, and my husband cannot have ham so I substituted with pastrami.  I will be making this again.

Delicious!! I made a few changes. I used crab, shrimp, ground turkey and tomato paste. Besides those alterations, all other recipe ingredients and directions were followed.  It turned out better than I imagined.

I am from New Orleans and have never seen bell peppers made in this way.  Shrimp and ground beef don't mix well together.  You either do one or another.  It was very dry with the bread mixed in.  There are better recipies for southern style stuffed peppers than this.  Don't waste your time.

I added more seasoning and other seasonings to jazz it up a bit. My main thing is when using the bread crumbs, it would be better to first moisten the bread to soften it up, then put into the filling. I believe this is how my family have always done it to get the filling perfect and not too clumpy. I added Creole seasoning and a bit more salt and pepper to it. Other than that, I think this recipe was a very good starting point for me to perfect my N'awlins stuffed bell peppers in the future. Nonetheless, you did a good job :).

I made these yesterday for a "southern style" Christmas party and they were a hit with the whole crowd.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but probably used twice the creole seasoning that it called for.  I also followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added broth - I used a vegetarian broth though, because I had to split the recipe to please the carnivores and vegetarians as well.  I used a vegetarian substitute for hamburger on that side of the stove, and stuck to the burger / ham / shrimp combo on the other side.  I doubled it up (9 peppers, 18 halves) and not a single one is leftover as of this morning.  Thanks!

Good change from the traditional!  I always steam my peppers first; used Andouille instead of ham and added beef broth to prepare the stuffing before combining with remaining ingredients.  Also ended up using more creole seasoning as a personal preference.

I used diced sausage instead of ham and cornbread stuffing. I also blanched my peppers prior to stuffing (incidentally, 20 minutes was too long - they split and were floppy).  My family loved them, even with my mess-ups and substitutions. Great recipe!

Everyone loved these!  Store was out of stuffing mix, so I made a box of couscous; also out of file', but didn't miss it either.  didn't add the bread crumbs on top, but did put a slice of provolone for the last 5 minutes.  Excellent!

Thank you for the nice recipe. It was very good. I omited the file powder,parsley and bread crumbs(didn't have) and celery(don't like). I had a box of seasoned corbread stuffing still left over from Thanksgiving.I think next time I won't buy all the peppers, bc no one ate that part, but rather just use the one pepper chopped and make the stuffing into a casserole kind of dish instead. I used some ham leftover from Thanksgiving. I think you definately have to have the right flavored ham, not just cubed package ham or lunch meat ham. I chose this recipe and also the awesome ham and potato soup so that I could use up all my Thanksgiving leftover meats. I like that the recipe is very versatile. I usually dont change the recipes but I tried to use up what I had already at home so even with all my eliminations was still very good. Thank you so much for the recipe.

This recipe turned out great! My 22 month old baby girl loved it along with the rest of the family. I made a few changes though...Instead of using plain bread stuffing I used seasoned corn bread stuffing, so I didn't need any salt for extra taste. I also added two med. eggs after I cooked the meatveggie mix and added the stuffing mix. IT turned out GRRREAT!!!!

My husband loved these peppers.  I did boil the peppers before stuffing them.  It was quite  a bit of work to prepare all of the stuffing, but it was worth it!

Loved these, and stayed pretty much with listed ingredients, with a tweak here or there. The only major change was to use cooked barley, which I had, instead of stuffing, which I did not.  I think I will use the barley all time, as it was very good.
