I followed this recipe almost exactly. I decided to make bang bang shrimp soft tacos instead.

For 1 serving
Eyeball the amounts of each ingredient to taste.

Added:
chopped green onion
cucumber
rice vinegar (half a teaspoon)
lime juice (a quarter of a lime squeezed)
salt & pepper

Combine lettuce, green onion, cucumber, rice vinegar, and lime juice.
Add the shrimp to the tortilla (and extra sauce if you have it), add lettuce and the mixture you just combined on top. Then top with sesame seeds, salt and pepper.

For 1 person: I used 8 jumbo, peeled, deveined pre-cooked shrimp, dipped in egg wash and then in corn starch. Fried in a couple tablespoons veggie oil until golden ( a couple of minutes) and drained on a paper towel. My sauce was 2 T mayo, 1 T garlic chili sauce, a squirt of Sriracha and a squirt of honey. Toss shrimp gently to coat. OMG delicious! I thought it was as good if not better than anything I've had out. I will make this again!!!

It turned out delicious.   The only change I made was I dredged the shrimp thru buttermilk then thru corn starch back thru buttermilk then thru Panko crumbs.  The result was identical to the Bang Bang Shrimp from Bone Fish!!

Made recipes as stated.  Way too sweet for me.  Used a couple tips from a reviewer(past employee) on adding lemon juice and white wine.  This helped the dish a lot.  Next time I will use far less sweet chili sauce.

I'm honestly disappointed. It tasted good but not great. It was pretty similar to the bang bang shrimp from Bonefish grill, but it definitely wasn't it. I will keep trying until I make it the same as the Bonefish grill. When I do, I will post it.

Made this a few times and after a couple tweaks it tasted exactly like the bang bang shrimp at bonefish.
A little more Thai sweet chili sauce a couple mores dashes of Sriracha hot chili sauce.
Delicious

So yummy! I usually double the recipe so I peel 2 pounds of medium shrimp, place in a zip lock and coat with cornstarch. Heat some oil in a pan, fry shrimp for about 3-4 minutes. Then I make the sauce.... 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup thai chili sauce, couple of dashes of hot sauce and stir all together. Then I toss the shrimp in the sauce. I usually make tacos with lettuce, the shrimp, and tortillas!

Mine didn't taste exactly like Bonefish.  Probably because I used an oriental chili garlic sauce rather than Sriracha. But it turned out fabulous all the same.  Two thumbs up.

Too much Mayonnaise--reduce Mayonnaise to 2 Tab per 12 shrimp.  Keep ratio of remaining Chile sauce and hot sauce.

We made this and loved it! The only thing we did differently was to use Korean chili sauce since we didn't have Thai sweet chili source in our pantry. We had to use a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to sweeten it. We also served it in a flour tortilla with a bit of  mixed greens and green onions and extra sauce on the side. We 'll make this again!

I make this all the time after finding the recipe here. I don't even measure anymore. I just add a few squeezes of lemon to the saucyness. We eat it on salad or on basmati rice. Good either way!

I have made these many times and we love them but I use much more Sriracha sauce - probably more like an 1/8th  of a cup of Sriracha sauce or more.

Great recipe. 3-5 minutes cooking the shrimp was a little long, I only cooked for a minute and a half. I cooked them in a cast iron skillet.  Leave sauce on side so everyone can put how much they like!  I cook this at least twice a month. My husband loves them!

I have never eaten Bang Bang Shrimp so I cannot compare and am probably less biased about how it tastes, but my family loved this. It is ridiculously easy to make and I can think of all sorts of things to do with this recipe now.

Def enjoyed this dish. I dusted the shrimp in almond flour and next time will probably then add a step of dipping shrimp in  eggs before adding to the oil. 
The combo is great for the dressing, and I put it on lettuce also to enjoy with the shrimp.

I did put more hot sauce than the recipe called for because we are a family that love hot! I made it as directed the first time and it was good but not as spicy as we like so I doubled it the second time and it’s amazing. I’ve made this many times and it’s always great.

I’ve made this recipe multiple times as both bang bang shrimp and bang bang chicken (cut up chicken into tiny, bite-sized pieces and toss in the cornstarch).  Not a bad replica of the commercial branded item, but I usually add more sweet chili sauce and Siracha.  I also substitute broccoli slaw (no sauce, straight out if the bag) for the lettuce leaves...that way the sauce also mixes with the slaw...makes a good partner to the bang bang.

Recipe needs only minor tweaks.  In addition to the items mentioned, I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of garlic chili sauce, seasoned my shrimp.  The sauce will evenly coat 2lbs of large shrimp.  I also followed other reviews by adding panko breadcrumbs and fried in peanut oil.

This was delicious. The change I made was to mix the sauce with cole slaw, added a drizzle of honey and made them into wraps/tacos! Wow!

The recipe as is-I rated a 4. After some changes, I’d rate it a 5. For the shrimp I mixed bread crumbs into the corn starch to give it a better crunch. For the sauce, I did 1/4 cup mayo instead of 1/2. I kept the sweet chili 1/4 cup (so proportional to the mayo). Served it with a side of white rice and drizzled the sauce on top-and it’s Perfect!

I made this sauce and put it over some fried popcorn shrimp. Then used in a taco with slaw and zesty lime cilantro sauce.  I also did this with coconut shrimp for a appetizer when I had some guests over for dinner and they loved it !! It was really pretty too.  Oh and they had never had "bang bang Shrimp" Thanks

I've made this dish several times. It's great and easy to do. Watch the temps so you don't burn the cornstarch that accumulates in the skillet.

This was yummy! Though next time I think I will try to use something other than cornstarch for the shrimp, it was good with it, but not my cup of tea. I like them with a fluffier light crisp. It’s all about preference anyways when it comes to cooking no? :)

Obviously this isn't bonefish, but it's pretty good! I added about a tablespoon more of the sweet chili sauce and a teaspoon more of chili paste. (We use the Sriracha paste instead of sauce). I recommend frying in a deep fryer if you have one! I barely coated the shrimp in the sauce just in case it wasn't great, but we all ended up getting more! I served it over white rice and my husband loved it! (He's the picky one) I have permission to make this again lol.

I followed this recipe and it tasted good, but using solely cornstarch produces a chalky aftertaste...maybe I didn't shake of the excess enough. However I will try the recipe with half flour half cornstarch and see how things go. The sauce was perfect in taste though

Instead of tossing the shrimp in the sauce, we used the sauce as a dip. A bonus with the sauce was that it tasted really great on the broccoli we had with the meal.

Really good.  I served them as shrimp tacos, with lettuce, tomato, green onion, jalapeño slices and spritzed with lime juice. Served with Chinese fried rice.  Yum. I also added the juice of about 1/4 of a lime to the sauce.

I did make this and I am not really to keen on frying things. I want to make again and would like to just sauté the shrimp in a pain and then coat them. Also think that I didn't use enough siracha so will try again.

I had to make the Thai sweet chili sauce.  Found a recipe here that was super easy!  I used an electric deep fryer.  Even though these were sweeter than the restaurant's version, they were DELICIOUS and quick and easy to make.  When I make again I will either cut back on the sugar in the homemade sauce, or will try a jar Thai sauce.

Sauce on the side or drizzle or double the amount of shrimp. I used coconut oil and doubled the sriracha sauce. Really good!  Hubby loved it!
