The recipe is indeed very light and good!  I used fresh nutmeg and added cinnamon and a touch of ginger to give it a little more depth.  I didn't have fresh bay leaf so I omitted that.  Love the less fat of the almond milk!

Pretty good recipe.  I did it a bit differently.  I used frozen cooked squash and cooked it down with the apples so I didn't have to puree it.  It left a couple little chunks in it and made it a bit thicker, which I like.  Also I didn't add the water.

Wow - finally a creamy soup that is tasty and healthy. I used almond milk but might try soy next time just as a variation.

I loved this soup.  Once of the best soups I have ever made!  I made a few modifications based on other reviews. I only used about a cup of water, and I precooked the squash in the microwave (stab with a fork, 8 minutes for a small one) because they are just too hard to peel and chop up. I only had a very small butternut squash, so I only used 1 cup of almond milk.  I used a whole apple.  I skipped the lemon juice and only had dried thyme, and I added a little cinnamon.   I pureed the soup in the pot with an immersion blender and it was still fairly chunky, so I put it in my Vitamix and it came out so smooth and almost fluffy.  It was fantastic.   My husband loved it too.

I love this soup.  I used 2 apples, chicken broth instead of water (and a bit less than it says).  I didn't have fresh thyme, I used a small amount of cinnamon.  I thought the almond milk gave it a nice richness and was still calorie friendly.  I didn't puree it, just mashed it as I like a thicker soup.  I will definitely make again.

this was delicious, although I used a couple of pears instead of apples.

This recipe is great BUT why use water when chicken broth adds so much more flavor? Thanks for posting:)

I tried making this soup, mainly because it takes almond milk, and is low fat. No one liked it except me, and I didn't love it. It felt too thin, and watery, and not a lot of flavor. Now, this is my first attempt at a low fat creamy soup, so it might just be that we were hoping for the thick, creamy richness of full cream soups. The flavour was nice though, just wasn't enough of it!
