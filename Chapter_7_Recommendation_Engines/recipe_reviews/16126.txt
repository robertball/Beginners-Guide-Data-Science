This is delicious as a salad or a dessert.  I found Snicker "pop-ables" (little bite-size Snicker balls) in the candy isle at my grocery store.  I leave them whole and just toss a bag of them in the salad.  It is a lot easier than cutting up the candy bars!!

Made this for a church event and got RAVE review and requests for the recipe, and brought home an empty bowl! Changes to the recipe: I used more grapes (about a cupful), and I used French Vanilla pudding instead of plain Vanilla, and I added 4 oz. softened cream cheese (yum), and I added about 1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans. I made it the night before, so overnight the sauce got a little creamier (it was very thick when I first made it) and it had just a hint of chocolate flavor from sitting overnight in the fridge. It was great when I made it, and just as great (but a little different) when we ate it. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

This recipe was a huge hit.  I used butterscotch pudding instead of the vanilla and it was wonderful.  I didn't even need to use all of the snickers bars because of the extra flavor from the butterscotch.  I just crumbled 2 snickers bars over the top of the salad for a mouth watering finish.  Everyone raved and wanted the recipe.

Everyone really liked it and went back for seconds. I'd make it again. After a nasty cut on my thumb years ago from cutting chilled snickers, I've learned DO NOT cut them chilled or frozen. Let them chill while the prepared salad is in the fridge, trust me.

This stuff is pretty good.  I was skeptical at first but, my family really enjoyed it.  I accidently made the pudding and also added the 1 cup milk and the still liked it.  I think next time though I will maybe cut back on the snickers and add a bananna.

Oh my gosh! This is delicious. Its is better when it sits overnight and the caramel from the snickers combines with the apples. Oh my gosh!

I took this recipe to a "salad party".  I cut up the snickers when they were at room temperature and froze the pieces(it went a lot easier than trying to cut them frozen.  Great recipe!

I made this for our class potluck and people were skeptical in trying it at first. After word of mouth, many people will and tried it and were pleasantly surprised at this "innovative" and "new spin on salad" dish. Great recipe and a delightful treat for all! (A lot of people thought it was potato salad at first glance!)

I never thought eating grapes and Snickers in the same bite would be delicious- but I was wrong.  This salad is so good- a huge hit!  I will make it again and again for parties, events, or even just for snacking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This salad is soooo good! I didnt put the grapes in it because it didnt sound like that would taste very good with the other ingredients. I suggest letting this sit in the fridge over night that way the apples soak up the whipped topping and vanilla pudding. I didnt freeze the snicker bars. I dont know why you do. I just cut the candy bars into small pieces and threw them in the bowl. It turned out great!!!!

I served this at an open house and had many requests for the recipe.  I made a couple changes in the recipe by adding an 8 oz pkg softened cream cheese and using cheesecake instant pudding.  I used extra apples as mine were not large apples. I mixed in 1 Tbsp. of lemon juice before adding whipped topping to prevent the apples from browning. To make cutting the Snickers bars easier, I let my strong husband cut them!  Caution, don't chop the Snickers bars too fine or you loose the whole idea of putting them in.

This had no redeeming qualities, it was too sweet, bland and the flavours did not meld together, I even let it sit overnight and it was still terrible, I had to throw this away

I love this salad/dessert.  I did as another suggested and added  4oz of (low fat) cream cheese.  I also used skim milk and the light cool whip - it was just as good, and you don't feel quite so bad about eating it!

I wanted a new salad for a potluck of various salads.  What a great idea!  Its a great recipe for a summer picnic/potluck.  Instead of coring and peeling the apples, I just cut them up into bite size pieces.  Forget the kids liking it, its a hit with adults!

I made this for a potluck.  I found it to be a little messy, but easy to make and went over very well.

Could us sugar free pudding.

Maybe putting snickers in a food processer for a minute may cut down on messiness and give it more flavor.  I don't have a food processer so I just cut the Snickers up very small.

Wonderful salad, I have made numerous times without the pudding (just cool-whip) and left out the grapes!  Very refreshing!!  (Great with milky way instead of snickers, for those who can't have nuts.)  Also great with a sprinkle of cinnamon!!

I made this recipe for work and again for my daughter's school "Teacher Appreciation Day".  It was a hit!!  I have been asked for the recipe several times.  I used the advice of others and froze the Snickers bars and then smashed them w/ a hammer inside the wrapper -- worked perfect!

I received compliments on this "dessert".  The flavor was good and the kids really liked it.  I gave it only 4 stars because I thought the amount of pudding was too much.  I ended up adding a lot more grapes, snickers, and apples then it called for.  When making this again, I would add all ingredients, then slowly add the pudding to create the consistency I like.  Or, I would add more of the grapes, snickers and apples.  With these tweaks, the recipe is great!

My 9-year-old son liked this.  But I found it very hard to make...chopping up six Snickers bars made my arms hurt!  I would advise not to put them in the fridge before-hand.  I probably will not make again unless he asks for it.

Took it to a family function and it was the only salad that was completely gone! I definately added more apples and grapes and used poppables snickers. I'm taking it to a graduation party tomorrow. Fun and people love to talk about it trying to figure it out.

This was an interesting blend of candy and apples. I tried the poppables, but feel that the chunks are too big. Next time I will go through the mess of crushing candy bars.

This was a hit at a holiday party.  Everybody loved it.  Instead of adding milk to reconstitute the pudding, I used buttermilk, adding an extra layer of tanginess that complimented the sweetness of the apples.

My family loves this salad.  For a change I like to replace the vanilla pudding w/white chocolate pudding - very good.

I took this recipe (doubled) to a family reunion. I took the recipe with me to show what was in the salad as it looks kind of funky. Once people tried it they loved it. Will definately use for potlucks and reunions again.

I make this with only apples (usually Granny Smith),Snickers and whipped topping.  I have found the easiest way to "chop" the snickers bars is to freeze them first right in the bag.  Then take them onto some concrete surface (my back porch) cover with a towel and hit with a large hammer.  I find that this leaves some large chunks and some small ones.  Then open the wrappers right over your bowl.  They tend to thaw out pretty quickly in the salad.  It tastes like a chocolate, caramel apple.

What a dessert should really be: Healthy because of the fruit; Low-Fat if you choose to substitute low-fat pudding and whipped 'cream'; SINFULL and just a little fattening with the addition of those tiny Snickers bars.  Light enough and extremely delicious:  try it for Thanksgiving Dessert! mmmmmmm--good!

Awesome recipe. Used sugar free pudding, fat free milk and lite cool whip, so the only "guilt" associated with this dessert was the Snickers. Using lite ingredients didn't compromise this at all, as the snickers and the apples are the stars of this recipe, that's for sure!

This is easy.  Didn't go over as good as I hoped, but it was still good.  I used Snickes Poppables instead of cutting up the candy bars.

This recipe was fairly good. It was an inventive way to use up the leftover snickers from Halloween. I do suggest to use very firm apples such as fuji and granny smith. And I also suggest to use 2 packages of the pudding and at least 8 apples. Otherwise there is just too much cool whip pudding mixture.

this recipe is AWESOME!  i forgot grapes, but the salad was still fantastic!  i also used half granny smith and half red delicious apples for some color and tang.  i also did not peel them because i'm lazy.
another reviewer said to make it the night before and that was a super idea.  it allowed for the snicker bars to melt slightly and for the apples to soak up the cool whip.

Everyone loves this recipe! I have made it for several different family gatherings and everyone asks for the recipe. I have used Mars bars or Milky Way instead of Snickers and it still is great. I put in a 1/2 cup of grapes that I have cut in half so the bites aren't so big. :)

I love this recipe and make it often.  I do use different types of pudding, white chocolate is the best.  I also add a jar of marshmallow creme and leave out the grapes.

Took this to a picnic and to a pig out at work.  Everybody loved it and wanted a copy of the recipe.  The snickers seemed to be the winning ticket.  I also added more seedless grapes than what was called for.

Took to a graduation party and even though I made a double batch it completely disappeared. The only changes I made was elimated the grapes and added 4oz creme cheese, and 1/2 cup cocktail peanuts, and used granny smith and red delicious apples. Will definetly make again.

OHMYGOSH!  My husband, who doesn't really have much of sweet tooth, had to be tackled in order for me to get a helping of this!  First time I made it, I used fat free whipped topping & Gala apples, white chocolate pudding & left out the grapes.  Unfortunately, it turned out kind of runny, as did another salad I used the fat free topping with.  Next time, I used light & it came out great.  I also made this w/one 3 oz box of french vanilla & one box of butterscotch instead of the 5 oz. vanilla & it was really good too.  It doesn't really look that appetizing, but when I take to a potluck I put a tag on it that says "Snicker Salad" & the bowl gets cleaned out!

Well, because of what I had, I modified things.  Left out the grapes.  Only used 8 oz of cool whip and just 2 apples.  I cut them up and it seemed like the mixture wouldn't take more than the two.  Of course I used the 6 Snickers - can't skimp on chocolate.  I took this to work and everyone loved it.  Will make it again for sure.

My family just loved this recipe.  We had one that was similar when we lived in WI, but I had never made it before.  I used Granny Smith apples, not frozen Snickers bars and omited the grapes.  Was wonderful and refreshing!

Reading the reviews, I am seeing interesting comments about the candy bars. I chill mine in the fridge before cutting, rather than freezing, making them solid enough to cut into nice pieces, but not so solid they can't be cut. Also, I make 7 cuts across the bar and one lengthwise down the center, making 16 little cubes of each bar. It's really not that much of a chore. I've also never peeled the apples... I use my corer/wedge and then cut the wedges in bite-sized pieces.  Again, not a huge chore.  My family likes the original recipe so well that have never made any substitutions, but using cheesecake flavored pudding would be the first change I would try.

I skipped the grapes, used 4 larger sized granny smith's and for the pudding I used one 3.4 oz French vanilla plus half of the same size package butterscotch pudding (idea I got from another version of this recipe). The result was creamy, caramel appley, divine deliciousness!!!

I accidently put the cooking kind of pudding in the milk. It worked, the next morning it thickened up and I added a tad more whipping cream. I used heavy whipping cream , because I think it tastes better. I cut the candy bars at room temp. and had no problem. I will make it again.
