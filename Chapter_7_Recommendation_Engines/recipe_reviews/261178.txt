During our snowstorm in Seattle I made this soul warming dish and it was a hit! Even drove up to Bellingham to deliver a pot to my daughter’s snow-bound apartment. She loved it!
Just finished doing an even better pot of the same, I added 4 more pepppers though, and we’re all just loving it!

I made the recipe as is and my family really enjoyed it.  The next time I make it, I am going to try to convert it to an Instant Pot recipe to cut down on the cooking time.

I cooked this for dinner today, and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was thoroughly season my pork cubes with adobo. Everyone loved it, thank you so much for sharing:)
