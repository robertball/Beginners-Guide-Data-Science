I can see why people like this recipe. I proceeded to make my own twist by adding chunks of veggies after I completed the original recipe. I also added Gardien meat-less chik’n (as seen in the two photos I posted). It’s pretty good and more Importantly Vegan!

Doubled the recipe. . . . Used 10 potatoes.  All 6 of us were happy with dinner (which Is VERY unusual) .  I am the vegan of the group,  so I love being able to cook just one meal for all of us.  My "I will never give up steak" husband said it was excellent!  He did top it with some cheddar cheese and bacon crumbles.   It was easy and fast enough to make on a school night.

My husband has many food allergies, so I subbed the almond milk for coconut cream (the fattier part of the can of milk). Ohhhh em goodness. So delicious! I used 2 bouillon cubes to make the water half water half broth. It's super delicious. I am a huge milk fan, it breaks my heart he's allergic. So if a recipe without cow's milk makes me happy I definitely will make it again! Saved in my cookbook, thank you!!

I liked this recipe allot very tasty easy dish.  I used vegetable broth instead of water. I ended up only using 1 Tbsp of salt but it still came our extremely salty probably due to the vegetablvegetables broth

I made this soup today. It was amazing!!!
I did not have fresh garlic on hand so I used Adobo seasoning instead. I did not use any salt because Adobo has salt in it. I did use the pepper and the almond milk I used was unsweetened. I will definitely make this again.

I baked the potatoes at 425 for 60 minutes, took them out of the oven to cool for a short time.  After removing the jackets and dicing the potatoes I then added them to the vegetable mixture that had been simmering for a half hour or so.  No need to purée the mixture.  I used vegetable stock instead of water.  My vegan daughter loved the baked potato flavor of the soup and my non vegan husband loved it as well.

I made this for my daughter who is vegan, and she liked it a lot. I omitted the celery, as she doesn’t like it, and made up for that by adding a 1/2 cup more of onion and carrot. I also didn’t completely purée until smooth, as she likes a chunkier soup.  Was so relieved to find a potato soup recipe that she can eat!

Also I recommend not doubling the black pepper as it’s more than enough with the 1 teaspoon.

Super easy to make and palatable even if I'm feeling nauseous. It reminds me of the cheesy potatoes my grandma made when I was little, but without the guilt. It was too salty for me so I recommend 3 tsp salt total.

This is a very good soup.  I only changed two things- I added chicken stock instead of water to the soup.   I also added some smoked sausage after I pureed the soup.   My family loved it.

I made this pretty much as written with just a couple of ingredient changes .  I used soy milk instead of almond because of allergy to almonds and red potatoes instead of russets because that’s what I had. I didn’t measure the salt, just salted it to taste.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious!  My husband loved it too.  It makes a lot.  We happily ate it for three days and I froze a bunch of it too.  It’s good topped with some grated Parmesan and bacon bits.  I used vegan bacon bits (made from beans) that I purchased on Amazon.  Thanks for this terrific recipe!

I will definitely make this again. Its very good. I didn't peel the potatoes. I mashed them by hand and left some chunks in the soup. I also didn't add celery and subbed ground celery seed instead. I added some parsley and only used about 1 tsp of salt if that. I did use vegetable broth. I also whisked a tablespoon of flour into the milk before adding it in. I simmered and stirred until thickened.

Wow!!! Delicious!!! Very filling!!! Will definitely be making this again! I don’t have an immersion blender and hot foods make the rubber on my regular blender melt- so I just used beaters which was a little messy but got the job done. Also- this almost taste like cheese. I’m vegan so it’s nice to find these types of recipes.

I made it with protein almond milk and left out the celery. It was simple and yummy. I’m sure I will use this recipe again and again.

My first time using almond milk in a soup. It turned out creamy and delicious. I’m really happy with the results. I used leftover breakfast potatoes that had already been seasoned with onion, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic salt, and black pepper. I added red pepper flakes as an afterthought. I didn’t add salt because the potatoes had been salted. It definitely needs the salt that the recipe calls for, so I ended up adding the salt in the recipe. I didn’t add the water. I left it thick and creamy. I also left a few breakfast potatoes on the side to add back in to make it a chunkier soup, but it’s such a beautiful purée on its own, it doesn’t need the extra potatoes. I will definitely make this soup again.

SO good! I reduced ground pepper by 1/2 but stuck to the original recipe for the rest.  Daughter said "this is amazing, it tastes like potato chips!"  We really enjoyed it, thank you for sharing!

I did not keep this vegan as I used cow's milk in place of the almond milk (mostly because I realized our almond milk is vanilla flavored) and I added cubed smoked pork chop.  Great soup!  See my photo with the green onion garnish.

Simple and delicious....all five of my kiddos like this soup and will eat it without complaining.  Hubby likes it a lot , too,  though he is not the type to fuss about anything I make.  :)
