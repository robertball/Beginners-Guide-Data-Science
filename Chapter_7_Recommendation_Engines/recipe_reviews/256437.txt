First time making pastry cream and it was delicious!  I chose this recipe because the instructions were clearest and easiest to follow.  If you don't have all the ingredients on hand, substitutions are fine since that's the situation I found myself in.   I don't carry kosher salt at home and only table salt; used 1/4 tsp and it came out fine.  I also only had 2% milk and not whole milk but followed the same measurement of 2 cups; came out fine.   Don't have vanilla beans at home so I added 1 tsp vanilla extract into the milk on the stove; came out fine, too.  This recipe is a keeper!

I don't know what I did wrong.  Are you sure the recipe needs one whole teaspoon of kosher salt?   I followed the recipe EXACTLY with fresh ingredients and it seems too salty.

Chef John is the best. Let's just get that right out of the way. But unfortunately 1 tsp kosher salt in this recipe completely destroys the pastry cream. 1/2 tsp at the very most, perhaps even less.

IN REGARDS TO SALT AND BUTTER: This recipe uses *COARSE* salt and *UNSALTED* butter, meaning you should use 1/4 TSP REGULAR TABLE/FINE SALT if you don't have coarse salt and make sure to NOT use salted butter. If you only have salted butter, then use even less salt!! 

Very delicious! I was extremely skeptical of this initially. When I tasted it on its own I thought it tasted too much like vanilla pudding. It wasn't until after I finally chilled it for a few hours and piped it into some choux pastry puffs that I found it very good! 

I didn't have actual vanilla beans and used 2 TSP pure extract and it still came out ok. I think that next time I will definitely use either beans or paste. This is a recipe where you will really taste the vanilla you add to it so a better quality one is necessary. 

I also did not follow the note to add whipped cream to the pastry cream when piping into cream puffs. It was fine in my cream puffs without the whipping because I didn't cut the puffs open (just piped the cream straight in). If you want the pastry cream to be visible/outside you might want that whipped cream for structure. Otherwise it jiggles around like pudding!

This recipe really is easier than others. To anyone who is not a big fan of stirring for what seems like an eternity over a hot stove, this recipe is for you. It comes together literally in just a few minutes. I plan to make this again and again. Thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly. The 1 teaspoon of kosher salt was way too much.  Half a teaspoon would have been plenty.  
If I make it again I will also add a few drops of vanilla for a bit more flavor.

I followed exactly but I, too, felt it's too salty. I will no doubt make it again but reduce the salt.

I only did a pinch of salt BUT this turned out really well. I ended up whisking step 1 much longer than it states. It was easy enough to make too, just show no fear like Chef John says!

Creamiest and richest tasting pastry cream I have ever tried so far. I didn't use regular sugar, instead I used coconut sugar and it gave almost like a carmel taste into the pastry cream. Also, I used a pinch of regular salt for I found a teaspoon of Kosher salt to be way too much in any kind of pastry for such small serving. One thing that did bothered me was the fact that the butter separated in the mix after cooking. Is there an explanation to why it caused that reaction? But overall,  this is an amazing recipe and keeper for books. Therefore, it deserves five starts.

Is there an error in the salt? Please revise this recipe down from 1 teaspoon! I used a scant teaspoon of coarse Kosher salt, and was so disappointed that I had not read reviews. Even the 5 star reviews recommended halving the salt, and quartering if you use table salt. I was going to give still 4 stars for texture and body, but then decided that cooks need to be forewarned before they serve guests a mountain of saltiness. Otherwise a 5 star recipe.

Will cut salt back by one half next time.  Other than too much salt, very good, smooth.  Very easy to make.

This is a good recipe for pastry cream albeit with the caveat that if  written with instructions to use unsalted butter ( which I knew was appropriate) and 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon free running salt, I would have given it 5 stars. I've made many, many gallons of pastry cream in my career and think that this must have just been a lapse in writing the recipe. Chef John's recipes are delicious and I use many of them.

I used the recipe as inspiration since I didn't have whole milk, unsalted butter, or a vanilla bean. My version was ok in the cream puffs I made but would've been so much better if I had used whole milk and higher quality extract or a vanilla bean.  So my advice is to stick to the recipe as written, go figure.

It’s me again. I’ve not made it but I want to but I no longer use refined sugar and instead use Blue Agave. How will this affect my cooking, my baking? I do so much pastry. It hadn’t occurred to me until I just read the recipe. Perhaps there’s something I can read? If you know of anything please pass it along. Many thanks, Samantha

this was my first attempt at making pastry cream, but the video and recipe were really easy and helpful! since I used salted butter, I omitted the extra salt entirely and got a perfect result. this is now my go-to pastry cream recipe! thank you for making an intimidating dessert really easy and absolutely delicious!
