This pie was awesome.  It was so easy.  I didn't use any of the crumb mixture for the crust.  I used a ready made crust and cooked it before adding the filling to it. The crust stayed really crisp.  I also added one finely chopped peeled granny smith apple and a cup of sliced strawberries to it and one tablespoon of flour to thicken the filling.  I put about 2/3rds of the crumb mix on the top and over the edges of the cooked ready made crust so the edges wouldn't burn.  I cooked it for about an hour, until the filling bubbled over.  It is definitly a keeper as my husband is very fussy about pies and he loved it.

For my first attempt at making anything with rhubarb, I'd say this recipe was the easiest.  Just an FYI though....I suggest baking the pie shell a bit before you put in the ingredients so that you have a crispier pie in the end!

This was a great recipe and the crumble is supertasty. I would double the filling if I made it again as there just isnÂ´t enough fruit as it is.

I have made this now two summers in a row, and really like this recipe! As someone who is somewhat pie crust impaired, this crumble type crust is a good alternative. The only things I have done to change the recipe is to add more rhubarb, if I happen to have a larger amount--and to add a pinch of nutmeg when putting in the cinnamon.Thanks for a really quick and great tasting rhubarb recipe!

This recipe appealed to me since it does not have a rolled crust- so easy, so good. I baked longer than called for so juice bubbled through crust.

Recipe is good... I too changed it up a little bit though... I never put a bottom crust and I used brown sugar for the crumble rather than white.  Also, I threw in a few strawberries just for added flavor... it was a hit with my guests!!

Yum!  Oats are nice and crumbly like you would expect.  I didn't MELT the shortening, just softened it; the direction to melt and then to "cut in" is a bit confusing!  That turned out OK, with a lot of patting down dough.  It is not neccesarily "crisp" but it is a "crisp" if that makes any sense; if you do really want a crisp crust, bake the bottom seperately first.

Very good, I added 1 cup frozen blueberries along with 4 cups of rhubarb & 3 cups strawberries, a delightful combination. I also added cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the topping. Yummy

I ended up making quite a few changes to this recipe because it seemed too dry and too plain.  I put nutmeg and cinnamon into the crumble as well as using brown sugar.  I also used firm butter for the crumble.  It was very good this way.

Rhubarb is difficult to find - but when you do, grab some and make this dish.  My wife and I both love rhubarb, but due to the difficulty of finding it we have not had a pie in over 4 years.

Being the adventurous cook I am, I found this recipe, tried it - needless to say, this is a winner.. It went down a storm, and the dessert my wife had purchased went to the garbage.

I had never tasted rhubarb, but my British husband loves it and wants to grow it in the garden, so I chose this recipe to try it out.  Extremely easy recipe and very tasty.  Will definitely make this, again.

This recipe was very dry, too many dry ingredients and not enough wet ones.  Way too much sugar, but I guess it suits for an obese society, such as ours.

Ohhh my this is awesome. I didn't even like rhubarb! This is so easy and so delicious.  I did use a deep dish pie crust so I added an additional cup to cup 1/2 of the rhubarb. I didn't need to change bake time either. YUMMMO!

I made this for my birhtday party, and everyone loved it, i had to give away the left over pieces to the guests so they can also enjoy them at home. I try to substitute some things with healthier things always. I used spelt flour, and unrefined can sugar and some maple syrop in this recipe. I found though with the substitution it needed extra 20 min in the oven. It was very good though!! will be making again when spring comes and rhubarb grows in my backyard.

This is very good, I changed the recipe just a little... I changed the 3 cups of rhubarb to 1 cup each; rhubarb, Strawberries, and Granny Smith Apples.  This turns out so good it get ate right up.  My family loves it.

Excellent flavor, very nice consistency.  I wanted to make a pie but was too lazy to make a crust.  This recipe worked out great - like a 'crisp' in a pie plate.  I cut back my sugar slightly only because I didn't have the full amount of rhubarb.

wonderful! so easy and good. since i used frozen rhubarb the first time i made this, i did not add the tablespoon water. i plan on using real rhubarb next time. i also added more butter on top to brown up the crumble. the whole thing was gone within 10 minutes at the family get together. even my picky father liked it!

I agree with others that there need be no bottom crumble, it all should go on the top. And I added cinnamon to the crumble mixture. Serve warm, with cream. Lovely.

Great fast easy recipe!  I always have so much rhubarb, and I never know what to do with it. Now I do!  I'm going to try adding some other fruits next time, like strawberries and blueberries that someone else had suggested.  YUM!

Very very good! I made two pies, this one and another from this site, "Rhubarb Cheesecake Pie," and I liked this one better. Even though this one uses less sugar in the rhubarb mixture, it wasn't as tart as the other. I used a prepared, pre-baked pie shell, and I only made half the crumble (except I forgot to halve the butter, but I didn't even realize it until I re-read the recipe just now). I used 1/4 c Splenda on the rhubarb, but used the called-for amount of white sugar in the crumble. I also threw in a few strawberries with the rhubarb. I will definately make this one again. Easy and good!

Husband is from Ireland where rhubarb grows wild, its his favorite. He really liked this and so did the rest of us. Now that I made it twice I agree you can adjust the topping amt according to your taste, and less butter and more rhubarb sounds like a good idea. I used frozen rhubard as I live in the desert, I didnt drain it, just let it thaw and omitted the water.

I would make it a 10 if I could.  I love rhubarb and always make pies and cakes in the Spring when it is available.  I have never made anything with rhubarb that either my husband or I liked better.  I am going to make it for the third time this season tonight with the last of my own rhubarb.  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

I did not melt the shortening, as the directions said to "cut it in" which typically needs hard shortening.  I also doubled the fruit according to others, and made 1.5 times the topping and used all of it for the top, skipping the bottom crust.

I've made rhubarb crisps and crumbles in the past and thought I'd give this recipe a try as it seemed to have some good reviews, but I feel as if this recipe falls a little flat. 

While it is simple to make and I liked the idea of having a 'crust' on the bottom, the overall flavor of the crumble was rather bland and not as crisp as I would've liked. The flavor could've been greatly improved by substituting brown sugar in the crust/crumble and possibly even some cinnamon or nutmeg in the crumble mix as well.
The warm crumble pie tasted good with ice cream, but I probably won't use this recipe again.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  Too dry and not flavorful.  It may taste better if a typical crisp topping mixture, like apple crisp, was used with more rhubarb.  Won't make again.

This wa delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I also added 1 cup of strawberries.  Served warm with ice cream - yum!  Making for the 2nd time in 2 days due to my abundance of rhubarb in the garden.

Like Grammasue, I used the crumb mixture as a topping  and put the whole thing in a regular pie crust.   The only other change I made was that I only used  1/4 cup sugar over the rhubarb instead of 1/2 cup.   Excellent!

This turned out quite good...I had to add extra butter to the crust mix to get it to the point where I could pat it into the pan.  Also added a touch of vegetable oil for the same reason.

Turned out good. Kind of like a Rhubarb crisp. A good recipe to make when you want a pie but don't want to deal with the crust.

I made this for my husband after recieving 10 quarts of frozen rhubarb. MY pie was actually only a 4 star, but I know it is because I used frozen than fresh. DH loved the crust, and wants me to use it with other pies too.

Deicious & simple to make. I increased the amount of rhubarb by an extra cup. Probably could've done 2 cups with a deep dish. Yummy!

I baked this with the following changes: Used 5 cups rhubarb with 3/4 cup sugar for the filling;  Pre-cooked rhubarb, sugar, water, and cinnamon in microwave for 5 minutes;  Second time I baked it, put all the crumble on the top;  Sprinkled topping with cinnamon sugar;  After baking, I topped with 1/4 cup caramelized almond slivers.  PERFECT!

I have a new love for rhubarb so I'm always looking for a good recipe and this one is VERY good. I like mine a little sweeter so a little extra sugar and cinnamon makes it perfect for me

Very yummy. I used a little more rhubarb than called for since I did not want to waste what I had on hand. The cooking time was longer for me as well. I kept it in the oven until it bubbled. This recipe is very adaptable. You can add a little more sugar, water, or cinnamon and it still comes out great. The result was more like a crisp rather than a pie though. If you want this to be more like a pie then you need to at least double the rhubarb and add a couple tablespoons cornstarch to the sugar water mix. But recipe is excellent as is!

I was very dissapointed with this recipe. I thought it was very bland. It lacked A LOT of flavor. I agree with another reviewer to subsitute the white sugar with brown sugar. I also added strawberries to mine and that helped with flavor. The berry mixture was good, however I don't think I will make this again.

Yummy! I doubled the rhubarb after reading the reviews and used brown sugar instead of white for the crumble. It was delicious. I actually baked it on the timer for 30 min and then let it sit in the oven for 2 hours, as I had to go out unexpectedly. I was expecting a disaster because of this, but only the very, very outside edge was ruined. The pie was wonderful! I have a ton of rhubarb in my freezer and intend to try this again and see if it turns out as good with frozen rhubarb as it did with the fresh.

Great recipe. I added a jar of homemade strawberry jam instead of the sugar with the rhubarb and it was great.  I cooked it for 50 minutes so it would bubble up over the top crumble.  I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I did not cook the bottom crumble part as others have - it didn't need it.

This was easy to make but I can see why many reviewers added ingredients.  I thought the flavor was bland and the crumble was too dry (not crispy) It also didn't have much "eye" appeal to serve to guests. I won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe, however mine was under cooked and the middle was soggy.  I would recommend tenting for at least 20min.  during cooking so your crust does not over brown.

We made this recipe Sunday with a couple of minor changes.  We put a half cup of chopped pecans in the crust and instead of water on the rhubarb we stirred about 1/3 cup of sour cream into our bowl of chopped rhubarb before putting it in the baking pan.   We used 4 cups of rhubarb because that is how much we had and because we had a 9 by 9 pan instead of a pie pan.     We also baked a rhubarb coffee cake, which was also good, but this was more rhubarb intense.
Excellent!   thanks!   (I apologize to those who only want reviews using the EXACT recipe, but I like reviews with extra tips too, as long as they don't change the ENTIRE recipe.)

Used frozen rhubarb. Final result way too dry -- because of the frozen rhubarb? We'll never know, because I don't plan to try this again -- sorry.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Did I say Yum? I wouldn't necessarily call it a pie, at least mine didn't cut like one, but if you like a fruit crisp with lots of crisp, you'll love this!  And the rhubarb remains tart instead of over sweet.  The only change I made was using unrefined sugar instead of white just because that's what I bake with. YUM!

I didn't care for this recipe as written.  Not enough fruit even though I used more than required.  I didn't care for the "crust" - and pre-baking it didn't help. If anything a regular pastry crust would be better but I won't be making this again.

Loved this so much I made some of the crumbly topping in place of a top crust for a traditional strawberry-rhubarb pie. It was great both ways.
