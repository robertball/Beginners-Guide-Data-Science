I made this with vegan (Trader Joe's) Chorizo.  I was out of the sausage and the seitan.  I also only had diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano.  I added the dry rice with two cups broth because it looked like the rice would use up all the juices if not.  Otherwise everything was the same.  It was fabulous.  My husband and I ate the whole recipe as our dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice meal for the winter. It's not very spicy, though. Add more seasoning and some red pepper.

Tasty and easy recipe. I didn't precook the rice though based on someone's review and it didn't fully cook in time so I recommend precooking.

Excellent!  Limited groceries so I substituted Miso Soup for paste, balancing with vegetable broth, and had to skip seitan.  Family loved it - it has become a repeat favorite!

Loved this recipe. Was in a hurry, so made it as is without reading reviews first. We love spicy food, so in the future I would add more Cajun spice plus red pepper flakes. I cooked the rice separately, rather than in the crock pot. Had home made seitan on hand which held up fine after four hours in the crock pot. Easy recipe and easy to customize to your own preferences.

Great recipe. I cut  the tomato sugesstion in half and substituted brown rice. I also added three diced jalapenos. The parsley garnish adds tons of flavor and compliments everything.

If you do not saute the onion first this will be unpalatable.  Rule #1 with soup making: ALWAYS saute the onions otherwise you will have a bitter and very overpowering oniony flavor.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I could get hold of some of the ingredients so used Quorn for both the sausages and chunks and it was gorgeous.  I added the rice to the dish as per the instructions but would add a little more liquid next time. I would definitely make this again.

This was DELICIOUS with a few revisions. I used vegan spicy chorizo and chicken strips instead of the seitan and sausage.  Also chose fire-roasted diced tomatoes, and subbed the bok choy for celery as someone suggested (but think both would work fine). Finally, I also cooked the rice for close to an hour. YUM!!!

Great recipe for the slow cooker!   I followed everything as exact except I used homemade seitan sausages and added it near the end.   I used brown rice, but it needed well over 1 1/2 hours to cook.  I imagine it might take somewhat longer than 30 minutes with white rice (if that's what the recipe is implying).

I accidentally used spicy vegan sausage the first time - VERY spicy results I added diced apple to sweeten and help with the heat. But it was so good I made it a second time and loved the results using a milder smoked vegan sausage.

Will certainly make this again!  Did not have Seitan so I used a full pack of veggie Italian Sausages.  Very yummy dish!

Substituted tempeh for seitan.  Used harissa oil.  Very good and will definitely make again.
