After frying a test batch and adjusting seasonings, I used: 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 teaspoons (at least) salt, 1/2 teaspoon each black and white pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, 1 tablespoon garlic salt. With all those additions, they were okay but not great. Found it hard to fry them until cooked through without burning them (even though they were small), and ended up finishing them in the oven. Next time I might sautee the leeks with an onion for added flavor instead of boiling them.

We had leftover leek to use up and I saw this recipe.  They tasted like meatloaf patties... and just ok ones.

These were really good...very nice flavor! We didn't use as much oil--instead we almost cooked them like hamburgers, but let them really cook until they get a nice crunchy outside with a moist outside. I dont think that much matzo meal is needed, and we didn't use that much. Needed more salt, though. Very nice served with greek yogurt on top!!!

I made these for Passover because I they sounded so tasty.  Unfortunately, I did not heed the other reviews which stated they the fritters turned out bland.  Could definitely use more spice!
