I loved this and so did my family! It's really good especially if you are a veggie lover. I didn't quite like all of the cooked veggies but that is just my opinion. :) A good recipe for the family!

The only change I made to this recipe is instead of garlic powder, I used fresh garlic cloves. My husband seasoned it with lawry's seasoning salt. We both really loved this recipe! I second another reviewer's comment, thank goodness for pregnant women and their cravings! :)

Thank goodness for pregnant women and their cravings!  This was wonderful!  I think next time I will drain the tomatoes first, as it was a little too runny.  I used flavored couscous.  This will be on my dinner rotation now.

My family loved this meal, even my four and two year olds!  I did add some cumin and chili powder for more flavor.  I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe was excellent!  I gave it four stars simply because I had to add cumin, just to give it a little more flavour.  It was 'almost there' in the flavour department, but not quite.  It felt like a spanish dish, so the cumin was all it needed. My three year old son loved it - and he's a picky eater!

AMAZING... i have never cooked cous cous so i was having doubts about how this dish would turn out but to my surprise, it was delicious. i strongly suggest adding grated cheese and hot sauce on top.

Blah! So bland... And I like healthy eating but this had nothing to offer. Tried to save this by adding cumin and lime but it couldn't be rescued. Unfortunate as I made enough to freeze for a second meal and it will probably never get eaten.

This is a great recipe if your pressed for time on dinner. It has all of you dinner, meat, veg, and side combined into one. I used plain couscous and it turned out great! I will definatly be making this again

Nice way to eat couscous. I added cumin and chili as other reviewers suggested. I use a similar recipe to make mexican rice, which also includes coriander, curcuma and paprika powder. Maybe next time when I want to eat couscous, I would try adding those spices as well.

Our family of five all liked it!  (Kids 10, 2.5 and 1.5).  We did have to add spices, and agree that it could use salsa or something as well for added flavor.  But overall a great recipe, i love ones using stuff i always have on hand.  Will make again.

It turned out very well with a few changes. For the meat I used several cloves of pressed garlic instead of the powder. I omitted the peppers & added diced roasted tomato to the chicken instead of the couscous. For flavor I definitely added the cumin, then salt, pepper, oregano, chili powder, a splash of white wine, & Italian seasonings (Mc Cormick in a grinder). To the couscous I seasoned the water, (next time I will use homemade chicken broth), with salt & Italian seasonings. After it was done I added CA Olive Ranch olive oil, (otherwise a bit dry & added some great flavor), & some Kerry Gold butter (this stuff is amazing, from grass fed cows), more Italian seasonings, splash of white wine & sliced BLACK OLIVES!! Oh my I think the black olives made the meal! But I love black olives :) I also used kidney beans because I had it on hand. I think next time I will add some chopped green onion as well. I just topped the couscous with the meat mixture instead of mixing it all together. I think it turned out wonderful! My husband loved it too!

I had never tried or cooked with couscous before, and I wanted to try it out. Delicious recipe!! I will definitely make this recipe again, and couscous is going to be the new staple grain at our house!

Overall not a bad dish.  Added more seasoning as suggested by others, still found that it could use something else.  Next time maybe a little bit of salsa.  Not a fan of canned tomatoes so I used fresh grape tomatoes, worked out nicely.  I also added some zucchini, although I think corn would have been better.
