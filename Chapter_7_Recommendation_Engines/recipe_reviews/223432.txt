Great shots ~ so easy and straight forward to make.  I did add 1 packet of Knox Gelatin to the mix.  Made for a large event I am hosting tomorrow (If there are any left ~ I just can't help being a Margarita girl). Thank you for sharing the recipe Janice. ~ Maybe I should add that I made the shots in wilton silicone molds, once set they just peeled out ~ so easy and everyone loved the shapes instead of the plastic cups!

2.20.18  Whoa, be prepared because they are “boozy,” but oh so good!   I was wondering if the margarita flavor would come through using cherry Jelll-O...and well, it does.  As a suggestion, if you plan to cut them into shapes, be sure to use a shallow dish.  My dish was a bit too deep/too small, and made cutting the hearts a little difficult.  I definitely can see this for St. Patrick’s Day, varying the recipe by using lime Jelll-O, cutting into shamrock shapes, and sprinkling some flaked salt on them.  JaniceL, thanks for a fun recipe.

Pretty good recipe.  I like the fact that you can mix it up with other flavors.
