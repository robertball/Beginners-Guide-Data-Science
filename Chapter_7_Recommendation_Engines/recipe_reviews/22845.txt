The seasonings are perfect for this recipe and that's the trick.  I prefer to add mashed potatoes to the mixture for use as a stuffing so when I finished the saute, I used a potato masher to further crumble the meat and that brought it to the right stuffing consistency.  Thanks Loretta.

My boyfriend made this for Thanksgiving Day.  He said it was easy to make and I found it to be delicious.  It was one of my favorites for the day!  The recipe and boyfriend are both keepers!

I sautéed the onions in butter and hsve also added chopped celery, also sautéed in the butter as well, but if I don't put it in its still good. I also par boil my potatoes in water and chicken broth  before I add them to the meat mixture and I use the water from the potatoes. After it's finished on the stove I place it in the oven at 350 for about 30-40 minutes to make the top a bit crusty. This dish always goes fast!

This was good. I made it as a main dish. Needs a little more seasonings. I did not need to thicken it with flour and butter at all.

I omitted the nutmeg and added 3 pinches of both dried rosemary and sage. Also added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I've made it twice. Next time I may add corn and mashed potatoes to make a shepherds pie. I love the way these flavors mix!!
