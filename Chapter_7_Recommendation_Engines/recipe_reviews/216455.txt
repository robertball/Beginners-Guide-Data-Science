I served this as a Christmas Day appetizer.  I did not have any dry sherry, so I substituted 1/2 dry vermouth and 1/2 sweet vermouth which worked out well.  People really enjoyed this appetizer.  It is a bit expensive to prepare at $10 per duck breast...but worth it for a special occasion.

Made this as a Christmas appetizer. Really enjoyed the contrast of flavors. The fat from the bacon was a great compliment to the lean duck meat. Would definetly recommend!

Good recipe.  Unfortunately for me I could not find peanut oil and used sesame seed oil instead.  Not sure if that was a good thing or not.  The duck was cooked perfectly and I liked the water chestnut texture.
