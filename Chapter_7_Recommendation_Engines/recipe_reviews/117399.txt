Great recipe!  I made mine the night before and let the mixture sit until dinner the next day...not sure of that improved the flavors or not but this was a hit.  I grilled the chicken - lightly seasoned. I wish I had "flavored" tortillas on hand, which would been better than the bland flour ones but still, great recipe and will add it to my summer collection! Thanks!

I used a sun-dried tomato basil tortilla, provolone in place of cheddar, added 1 leaf of boston bibb lettuce and chopped roasted red pepper, used onion powder in place of raw onions. Quick and tasty lunch!

These were good the first day and great the next day. The vinegar tones down a bit the next day. I served these up on a tomoato basil tortilla and used shredded mozerella cheese. I also did not have any honey mustard on hand but used a dijon mustard and added some honey to the mix. I used lightly seasoned baked, diced chicken. Next time I may add some tomatoes and lettuce to the wrap!

Very tasty.  I marinated the chicken in honey mustard before grilling for more flavor.

I have made this twice once with grilled sliced up chicken and once with canned chicken making it more like a chicken salad it was very good both ways.

I cheated, as I was making this as a quick dinner, and used 3 cans of chicken instead of fresh.  It was probably just as good!  Tasty recipe.  Thanks!

These were really good! I made them exactly as written and the only thing I would change next time is I think I'd do half honey mustard and half regular mustard, but thats just my taste. They still are great as is. I know I'll be making these a lot, easy and delicious!

Love these.  I like some romaine leaves and a little Sriracha on mine for heat and flavor.  Wrap them up in foil and send them in the lunch pails.  Always a hit!

I made these for a recent dinner party as an appetizer and they were a hit!  I used romaine lettuce leaves instead of tortillas, I cut them in half to make mini wraps and served them.  People ate them up and 3 of my friends asked for the recipe!  I of course, gave them the print out from the website to give credit where its due!  Thanks!!!  Will def. make again soon!!!!

Awesome wraps! I had my doubts about the dressing right up until I actually ate one of these.  My kids are going to love these..and will go into summer rotation.

This was quick and easy to make.  I didn't have time to grill, so I just thawed the chicken in the microwave and then broiled in on the stove top with some water so that it would be moist. I too made this a little ahead of time and let all the ingredients marinade in the fridge. Will surely make again!

Yum! I used this recipe as a jumping off point for stuffed pitas. I used the dressing, and added avocado, sprouts and toasted cashews along with leftover cubed chicken. Mixed and stuffed in a pita and you have a great, quick lunch!

This was really good! I used to like the chicken wraps at Wendys that had chicken, honey mustard, and cheddar cheese. So, when I was recommended this I had to try it. I made 1/2 recipe and used large tortillas at least the 10 inch size. I used all of the ingredients but the cashews. I used low fat cheese and lite mayo. I also made my own honey mustard using the lite mayo, dijon, and honey to taste, and added leaf lettuce to the wrap. The 2 sandwiches were a very generous size. I cut them each in half and got 4 servings with half the recipe. They will make a great lunch tommorrow. Thank you!

First, I followed the recipe exactly, no alterations at all.  My entire family enjoyed this, even the picky 6 year old asked for more.  I personally enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite, but to be fair I am not a huge fan of honey mustard.  My husband said it was perfect and so did the kids.  Super easy too, SO thanks for the recipe.  This will be a go to recipe for when I don't have a lot of time or energy to cook dinner!

Tasty, and certainly a keeper.  I used light Mayo and added about a 1/2 tsp of hatch chile powder (green).  Would prefer to have it on something other than tortilla's since I don't like most store bought tortillas.    Liked the cashews and celery in the mix.

I LOVE wraps, and this light, easy meal is a keeper.  I made one with Morningstar Farms Chik'n strips, an d the rest with cooked chicken.  It was a hit both ways.  If you like your food spicy, however, you may want to add something to bump it up a bit.  Fresh herbs would be nice, or try making a honey mustard sauce with spicy mustard.  Otherwise, it is a kid-pleasing meal that is ready in no time.

I thought this was very good but I followed the recipe to a T and I thought the mix was too strong in onion taste, so I will reduce the amount of onion in the recipe next time I make it! Great for making ahead of time, so you can eat these wraps for lunch a few days straight!

These are amazing! I have added more mayo/mustard/cashew & cut the red wine vinegar back a bit, but a huge hit with anyone I have made these for.

Two thumbs up (well, four if you count the fella's :) ).  I grilled the chicken on my george foreman (seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder).  I used light mayo (and probably less than the recipe calls for), went a little lighter on the celery, added extra cashews (my fave!!), and added some mixed greens to the wrap.  I used whole grain tortillas, but would like to try it with flavored tortillas.  If you don't have cheese- just go ahead without it.  I thought it was pretty unnecessary.  Overall, this was a great chicken salad recipe that I think would be yummy on some whole grain bread.  Will make again for sure!

Yum!  I really liked this recipe!  I used pre cooked garden herb chicken tenders and cubed them up.  I didn't have an onion on hand so I sliced up scallions and used pinenuts instead of cashews.  I also added a hint of jalapeno powder for a kick.  Very good and perfect for a light, summer lunch!

I left out the cheese. I used Low Fat Honey mustard dressing instead of the mayo and honey mustard. I added asparagus as well. It was delicious!

I didn't have honey mustard dressing or tortilla's so I improvised and used dijon mustard and whole wheat bread.  I also added tomato.  I've had better chicken salads but this one was fine.

These where good. I think they even tasted as good or better the second day.
