Before I decided to try this cake I read every single review, paying careful attention to those who did not like the cake very much. Though the overwhelming majority, of which I am now a part, liked this cake very much I understand that you learn a lot more about something by learning what people did not like about it. So, after having made the cake I have a few suggestions for those who didn’t like the cake. Most of the complaints where that the cake was too heavy or that it was too moist or “pudding like” A solution to this might be to strain the carrots and pineapple more before adding them in to the cake batter. I know the recipe doesn’t specify but I strained the carrots and the pineapple until they where almost dry and added about 2 – 3 tablespoons of the strained liquid back in. I also hydrated the raisins a bit by letting them sit in a cup of warm water while the carrots sat in the brown sugar. Also I made 3 - 8” rounds instead of the recommended 2 - 10” rounds. This will shorten the bake time to about 30 -45 mins. and may also help solve any underdone cake problems… I thought this cake was very good and well worth the effort. Everyone I have served this to has loved this and I certainly plan on making it again.

2009 edit: Use cheesecloth to strain the carrots! Wrap 1/3 the carrots in a cheesecloth pouch, twist it shut and squeeze.

 I've finally figured out how to make this moist without sogginess. My family loves carrot cake so I’ve made this recipe many times since I first found it. First, do what you can the night before and store ingredients in ziplock bags/tupperware. Grate the carrots, strain the pineapple, sift the dry ingredients, etc. The only things I added: 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves, added 1.5x the vanilla and cinnamon, ½ tsp baking POWDER, and the zest of one lemon. I nuked the raisins in equal parts of the drained pineapple juices and rum. The raisins absorbed most of the liquids and were really plump and delicious. Save a few tablespoons to add to the cake. I didn’t want to risk a dry cake so I compromised. I drained the carrots BEFORE I added the brown sugar. After the carrots sit for an hour, there will still be some liquid; add all of it. My cake ended up moist, flavorful, and TALL. Don't over-mix or let your cake sit too long. Baking soda reacts immediately so if you over-mix or leave it around, the gas will escape and your cake will be flat. Use the good pans. Line the bottom of your layer pans with wax paper or parchment paper. Better safe than sorry!  To make a bundt, bake at 325 for 75-90 minutes. Use a cream cheese glaze: beat 4oz cream cheese with 2tsp vanilla and 2c powdered sugar. And 1-2tbsp milk/rum to get spreading consistency.

This carrot cake is the absolute best that I have ever made.  I had many compliments on this.  The cake is large and serves many.  It only took 40 minutes to bake.  I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe which I think is much better and has a richer flavor.  It is as follows 1/4 lb. soft butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 lb. confectioners sugar.
Combine butter, cream cheese and vanilla, mix till blended.  Add sugar and mix til smooth.  Enjoy I do not think you will be dissappointed.

I got rave reviews on this cake ("you should sell this for $8.00 a slice"), but I did mess with the recipe.  
First, I scaled the recipe to 12 servings because of the comments about how huge the cake was.  I used 2 9" baking pans and it made a pretty regular sized cake.  
I used about 4 cups grated carrots, which was all of the carrots in the bag I bought and 1/2 cup less than called for.  I replaced half of the oil with apple sauce and I replaced half of the pineapple with apple sauce.  I also used wheat flour for a little less than 1/2 of the flour.  I left out the raisins and I added about a tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, ginger and dried orange rind.  I also doubled the cinnamon.  
For the frosting I used 1/4 lb butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 2 tsp vanilla and 1 lb sifted conf sugar.  Should probably have refrigerated it to let it set more before I transported it because it got a little slippy but not disastrous.
I took it to a 4 person dinner party and brought leftovers to work.  People could not get enough.  I was pretty happy since I not only never made carrot cake before, I had never eaten it so I wasn't sure how it should taste!  Thanks!

My husband said this was the best carrot cake he has ever had!!  It was extremely moist and delicious.  Here is a little tip:  I bought a five pound bag of carrots because I had no idea how many carrots I needed for 6 cups grated.  It averages out to about 10 carrots, if that many.  Overall, this was an excellent cake and a keeper in our home!

This is the carrot cake recipe I have been searching for.  I made the recipe exactly how it was written, and I was able to make 12 cupcakes (35min. at 350degrees), and one 9inch cake (50min.).
Thank you Nan.

Wow, this was fabulous! I read a lot of reviews first to see if there were any changes I should make. This is what I did. 1. Used a 13x9x2 glass casserole dish and baked for 55min. 2.Only used 1/2 c. oil along with 1/2 applesauce. -terrific advice!!! 3. Used 5 c. carrots (I used my food processor)4.Added lots of Allspice and nutmeg. I think I added about 1/2 cup extra of flour because the batter looked a little too runny. The end result to this recipe was MMMMMMmmmmmmm!!It truly lives up to it's name. "Best Carrot Cake Ever"

I just have to say I initially signed up to review this recipe! It really is the best carrot cake ever! I made this cake on a Sunday afternoon and it was gone by Tuesday morning! Everyone loved it!! The only things i did differently was i strained the carrots  before putting it with the brown sugar also i strained all the juice from the pineapple reserving about 3 tbs for the cake mix! I also hydrated the raisins in warm water for about 45mins. I made a lemon cream cheese for the middle and topping and decorated with chopped walnuts and bits of lemon zest! Yummy!

Great cake! I have gotten so many compliments on this cake. Very dense and stays moist for days after cutting (Providing I ever have any left)
Try this variation. Add 1C drained manderin oranges in place of pineapple and 1C grated coconut in place of walnuts. Yum Yum. My family loves it  either way. It's always requested  at every carry in dinner for work, church, or family reunions. The name says it all! BEST CARROT CAKE EVER! And a hint on the carrots...By hand takes forever, The food processor takes a while too. So I buy the already shredded carrots and toss them in the food processor for a few spins. Works like a charm.

My wedding cake was a carrot cake and each anniversary for the last 17 years, I have been making carrot cake recipes. Through the years, I have tried many recipes but none of them were "THE" recipe - until now!! With the exception of baking the cake in 3 9" pans, I didn't change a thing and the cake was definitely "bakery" quality. The cake is also a very pretty color. A food processor definitely takes the burden out of the grating! I also used 1 1/2 recipes of the cream cheese II frosting recipe and that appeared to be a sufficient amount of frosting.

This recipe is - as it stands - the best carrot cake ever.  It has replaced a local (and very good) baker where we used to buy our carrot cake (I now make it for my family).  I've baked this at least 5-7 times over the past year (every time after the first time was upon request of my family).  I don't think the recipe needs to be modified at all, it's moist, flavorful, and has so much substance as is.  I use a food processor to grate the carrots, so prep time for me isn't that lengthy (I wouldn't want to grate those carrots manually).  Also, I use the baby carrots that are already peeled and pre-packaged, simply for ease of prep...no adverse impact on the cake.  One note: I tried one time using whole wheat flour (I wanted to see if  I could get same great taste with a bit of a healthier flare) and it didn't work out...the whole wheat sacrificed some of the moisture, and the cake ended up being a bit too dry.

This is a good carrot cake, but not the best ever.  Waaaayyy to much oil.  It was very dense, and this may sound wierd, but it was too moist.  Almost like it wasn't cooked (& yeah it was).  Thanks anyway Nan. ;)

Quite definitely the Best Carrot Cake Ever!  I used to buy my Mom a carrot cake, but now this is officially my traditional recipe for Mother's Day, topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  The first time I made this, I used 3/4 c. oil & 1/4 c. applesauce, and I thought it was a little too heavy & greasy.  This last time, instead of 1 c. oil, I used 1/4 c. oil & 3/4 c. applesauce.  It was perfect.  My other changes were minor...added some nutmeg with the cinnamon, and per another review, I soaked the raisins in water while the carrot/brown sugar mixture set.
My mother has always loved carrot cake, and she says mine is the most delicious (ok, she may be a bit biased, but I also think this carrot cake is the BEST ever)

Best carrot cake I've ever had.  I did not change any of the ingredients.  I add the raisins in with the carrots and brown sugar to soak. (6 cups of carrots = a 2lb bag)  I use pineapple tidbits instead of crushed.  I pour it all into a 9 x 13 pan and bake for an hour, sometimes 5-10 min longer if needed.  Everyone requests it, everyone raves, you are the hero of the day even with people who say they hate carrot cake.  That simple.

This is awesome!!  I made a few changes and I'll never make another carrot cake recipe again.  I used only about 5 cups of grated carrot (use a food processor-very quick) and only 1/2 cup of oil.  It turned out more cake-like, not overly wet like some others I've tried.  I didn't use any raisins or nuts (want to make for my baby's 1st birthday).  I also added a dash each of the following: nutmeg, allspice, ginger and dried orange rind.  The flavor is incredible and full. The cream cheese frosting makes it too!!  I used regular cream cheese and no nuts!  I'm so happy!  Try this recipe! I used two 8" round pans it it came out wonderful. I'm going to make cupcakes next time!

Carrot cake is my weakness and this cake was amazing easily adaptable to be healthy. I cut the recipe in half and  made a 2- 8 in layer cake. I used all whole wheat flour, half oil and half applesauce (I think it would taste just as great with all applesauce). With the whole wheat flour, I did use all the liquid from the carrot and added about a 1/4 cup juice from the pineapple. Perfect moist texture. I also like a spicier cake and added more cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. I made half the cream cheese frosting II from the site to with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 2 T butter. Covered the whole cake with filling. No problems in frosting melting or cake layers sliding. This cake tasted like an old recipe that required 2 cups of oil. I made it for my brother's birthday and my whole family loved it, despite their misgivings about making everything healthier. One word. Decadent.

This was AWESOME the best carrot cake I have ever made or tasted!! I didn't have time to make this but I wanted to and I don't have a shredder to shred carrots because I have cut my knuckles too many times making carrot cakes in the past so I had the idea to blend all the ingredients up in my Vita Mix.  I just stirred in the chopped nuts at the end so they wouldn't be blended.  I also started with all the wet ingredients so it would blend easier and added flour before nuts at end and just made sure it was mixed.  I also added a little nutmeg.  It turned out so good and my prep time was 10 minutes instead of 1 1/2 hours and my cook time was 25 minutes because I have a convection oven.  Also, I cut the recipe in 1/2 because I only wanted a 9x13 cake.  I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe on this site under "Paul's Pumpkin Bars" I just can't rave about it enough.  My parents loved it and my mom is switching from her long time homemade carrot cake recipe to this one!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This is a FANTASTIC carrot cake recipe.  Everyone LOVES it.  It is somewhat time intensive, but worth it!  I have 2 modifications, though.  First, I add the raisins to the carrot/brown sugar mix & let all 3 ingredients sit for 60 minutes.  Second, because of the massive amount of cake mix, I use 3 cake pans instead of 2.

I made this for my hubby and he agreed with the title--it was the BEST carrot cake he had ever had! I used 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, soaked the raisins in warm water first and I also dried the shredded carrots with paper towels first before mixing with the brown sugar. Mine baked in about 50 minutes and it was perfect.  It takes a little more time to make, but it is so worth it!

I like tweaking recipes. I've made this recipe exactly a couple of times, this last time I made these changes which made it even better. Added two cups of pureed carrots + the 6 cups(I used already chopped julienned carrot which added better texture) To the carrot/brown sugar mixture I added 1/2 cup of Bailey's and marinated for 2 hours instead of 1 hour. I also included the juice from the crushed pineapple instead of draining off. I increased the flour by 1/2 cup and added approx. 1/8 tsp each of black pepper and nutmeg. It went from very good to WOW!!!!! Everyone loved it,even people who said they normally did not like carrot cake.

This absolutely deserve 5 star recipe.

this was my 1st carrot cake trial so i decided to try a smaller version by taking half of every ingredient and making it in one pan...just to test the results.

1)i have added 1/2 tsp of each nutmeg, ground clove, and ginger.
2)i didn't pat dry the carrots and i added them with the drained brown sugar liquid but i made sure pineapples are drained perfectly, and the cake was moisty but not soggy at all.
3)i soaked the raisins in warm water till they became soft (and this is really important as you don't want hard chewy thing in this mosity cake)
4)in one of the reviews they called for NO over-mixing and that's what i did, i mixed the ingredients until just combined and directly took it to the oven.
5)it took 50 mins exactly in the oven to be completely done and very moist.
5)made the cream cheese frosting of 8oz cheese, 2 tbs butter and 1 cup conf. sugar and covered the cake, colored part of the frosting in  orange to make the carrots and part with green to top the carrots and the result is ...YUMMY

Okay, I haven't made this cake yet, but it sounds fabulous.  I want to make it as a layer cake -- any warnings for me?  Should I change any amounts or anything to make it hold up/stand up better?

This is a really moist, dense, and flavorful cake. And not too spicy, since some carrot cake recipes call for nutmeg and allspice. I added unsweetened shredded coconut too and made it in a 13X9X2 inch pan, which made it super easy but added about 10 minutes to the baking time.

First attempt at 'from scratch' carrot cake and it was FABULOUS!  Made into 3 8" layers, and only other things I did different from recipe was to drain off the excess juice from the carrots after sitting in the brown sugar (no need to get all technical, and squeeze, etc, just tip the bowl with a plate over the edge and let most of the juice go right down the drain) and I soaked the raisins in the juice drained off the pineapple to plump a little while the carrots were soaking in the brown sugar.   This cake was very moist, but not mushy or soggy.  I loved it, only thing else I might change next time is maybe add a little nutmeg. Great recipe!

WOW. This is AWESOME. I took the advice of several other reviewers and made the following changes: cut white sugar down by 1/4 cup, cut oil down by 1/4 cup, doubled the vanilla, and added TONS of cinnamon and about a tsp of nutmeg and cloves. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and half AP flour and added about 1/2 tsp more baking soda. I made 3 8" pans expecting to make a triple layer cake, but they cooked up so big that I think I'll make a double layer and then freeze the third cake. I am making this for a dinner party and was nervous about bringing an awful cake, so I also took one ramekin and made myself a little cupcake to taste before I officially committed to bringing the whole cake. MAN. It is TASTY! Mine came out very spicy becuase of all the extra cinnamon and other spices, and I plan to use Cream Cheese Frosting #2, which I expect to be smooth enough to compliment the spiciness a bit.

Delicious.  This is my new carrot cake recipe.  I followed a couple of the suggestions: adding about 1/2 cup more flour, some nutmeg, and a tsp. of baking powder.  I did everything else exactly according to the recipe, and the result was a dense, beautiful, amazing cake.

This cake was the best! My fiance asked for a carrot cake for his birthday and I looked at him dumbfounded "why would someone ask for a carrot cake for their birthday?" Turns out to be the best decision ever! I had never made a carrot cake before so it was a learning process but it turned out amazing but here are a few tips.   MAKE THE CAKE THE DAY BEFORE!  I made 3 8in layers so the time to cook those was about 30 minutes. Also, I only used about 4 and 1/2 cups of grated carrots and grated them in the food processor because it takes forever to hand grate them. I drained some of the carrot juice because of some of the reviews I read about it being mushy but when your only using 4 and 1/2 cups you really need the juice (mine wasnt as moist as I wanted it but it still was moist). I also only soaked the raisins for about an hour in pineapple juice and pineapple rum (execellent). Save a little juice for the cake. Also, I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 extra tsp of cinnamon and vanilla just a sprinkle of the nuts because I used the rest to decorate the sides. If you love pineapples like me use a little more than the recommended amount because you can bearly taste them in the cake. Also, I homemade the cream cheese icing. It was kind of annoying but here is my recommendation. 1 thing of cream cheese, 1 stick of unsalted butter, and a splash of milk (heat over med heat in sauce pan until stirable). Add a pinch of salt, 1 tsp vinalla and 4 cups of conf sugar. stir well. PUT IN FRIDGE so it c

This really is the best carrot cake ever. Not too spicy, not too sweet, just perfect. The first time I made it I didn't soak the carrots in the brown sugar or add the pineapple and it wasn't that good. This time I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. I frosted the cake with the cream cheese frosting II. Perfect. Tastes like the carrot cake at Whole Foods which is my favorite.

Excellent flavor (not too sweet and multi-dimensional) and texture. Thanks for the recipe! Frosted with Philadelphia Cream Cheest frosting found online. I picked up a few tips from earlier reviewers, like straining the (measured) shredded carrots in cheesecloth, increasing cinnamon (to 5 tsp) and adding 1/4 tsp each of allspice, clove, ginger, and nutmeg. Served cupcakes to a crowd of 22, aged 3 to 86. Every single one yummed it up!

I found this recipe about a year ago, and made it for a friend's birthday.  She LOVED it! In the past year I have  made this probably 10 times, and have had people offer to pay for the ingredients so I can make it again and again! :)  While, I LOVE this website, and have found MANY wonderful recipes, I have to say this is one of the BEST recipes I have come across.  Thank you so much Nan, for sharing this fantastic recipes with all of us!!!

I left out the raisins, pineapple and walnuts. But even without those ingredients, this cake was amazing! I baked it twice so far for my family, and then I baked one for one of my friends, and EVERYONE loves it! It's mouthwatering and moist, and so good. I will continue to use this recipe. Thanks!

This was a good recipe, however, I compared this to the one I usually make, Carrot Cake III from this site, which I think is somewhat better.  Carrot Cake III is a five star with over 3,000 reviews.  Look it up, you may like it.

Wowser! This is one is a doosey! I read the reviews and followed the advise not to keep all the liquid after the carrots were macerated. Also I pushed the pineapple into a seive to drain extra juice out. It still came out incredibly moist with alot of flavor. I added coconut to the recipe, adding 1/2 cup coconut and reducing the raisins to a 1/2 cup. I also put coconut between the cake layers with the frosting and people loved it. Thanks for the great recipe.

This sure lived up to its name.  I made it for an Easter meal with friends.  Everyone loved it.  I layed the cakes and used the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe with real cream cheese. I shredded my carrots in a food processor.  This was and awesome cake.  I can't wait to make it again.

Super moist and very tasty.  I suggest using more spices like other reviewers.  Definitaly use at least a tsp. of nutmeg and at least 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves.  The pineapple is a nice touch as well and you can't even taste it (for those who are wondering).

FINALLY...after a long search for the perfect carrott cake recipe...I've found it.  As the name says this is "THE BEST CARROTT CAKE" recipe I have ever tasted.  Definitely worth the work getting 6 cups of grated carrott.  (I used a mini food cuisinart, and it saved me quite a bit of time)  The cake is so moist and delicious.  It is dense, but I love it that way.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.  I topped it with a cream cheese frosting recipe found in this website.

So delicious. SO very moist. I've been looking for the perfect Carrot Cake recipe, and this one has undoubtedly ended my search. Makes great cupcakes too; add a standard issue Cream Cheese Frosting on top and you're in HEAVEN. Also, to save work grating carrots, bust out the food processor and feed the carrots through on the "Grater" blade...reduces the work to mere seconds!

Update: I made this cake a second time, and again it was really soggy in the middle and completely undercooked. It had the consistency of a brick. I brough it to a potluck dinner for work and almost no one ate it.  I had to throw most of it away, I am no beginner baker! Will not be making this again!! This thing has way too many ingredients, it is so dense, but in a bad way. Very brick-like.

The 6 cups of carrots made me a bit nervous, but I went ahead and followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous, just like the reviews I read.  Can't go wrong with this one.  It's just me and my husband so I made this into 3-9inch pans and froze 2 of them and frosted just one to eat...works out great.

Substitutions for the health conscious ----- The cake was excellent!!! However, I think that it was a little too sweet for my taste even without any glaze or frosting, this was my first time baking a carrot cake and it was super yummy! Ok, so I made it with white whole wheat pastry flour, instead of all purpose flour. Instead of vegetable oil I used organic  coconut oil (warmed for 30 seconds in the microwave to get a liquid consistency) I used half organic coconut sugar and half white, but next time I'd use only coconut sugar and I will use at least 25% less than the recipe calls for, because it was too sweet, the ingredients themselves are sweet, the pineapple, the raisins and of course the carrots are sweet, so for my taste it was too sweet, but still excellent. 5 stars.

I made this recipe earlier today, pared down to 8 servings. Made cupcakes rather than a cake and they turned out well.A couple of changes: cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup applesauce; I also cut the salt to a scant 1/8 tsp. and added dashes of nutmeg and allspice along with the cinnamon. Carrots were shredded in my little chopper yesterday; I let them soak overnight with the brown sugar,forgot to add the raisins so threw them in right as I was doing the batter. No pineapple or walnuts,didn't have either. I didn't drain what liquid there was from the carrots as the batter was pretty thick and after I put the carrots (etc)in and mixed them, it seemed just the right consistency. It made 22 cupcakes, I baked at 350 for 25 minutes. A nice result, I would make this recipe again, not only is it yummy,it's easy! Before I did the frosting,I heard the party these are for has been postponed til next week due to the wonderful rain here in California, so I let the c.cakes cool completely and then popped them into the freezer. At least the ones we haven't eaten already!

I never made this before and after reading the reviews, I made this recipe with minor alterations and my finished product got RAVE reviews.  My husband said it's the best he's ever had!  I made 1 and 1/2 of this recipe to make 2- 9x13 cakes and 6 cupcakes.  This was for a birthday cake which I frosted with a cream cheese frosting and used in between the layers.  I chopped walnuts and stuck them to the sticky sides of the cake. Turned out beautiful and everyone loved it.  I used a cheese cloth and squeezed out excess water from shredded carrots. I drained the pineapple juice and added 3 Tbsp back into the shredded carrots for flavor.  I greased the pans and used wax paper for the bottom of the pans.  They practically fell out of the pans, perfect for making a birthday cake.  I 1.5 times the vanilla and cinnamon. I reduced the baking soda by 1/2. When it came time to mix the dry ingredients into wet, I mixed just until it was incorporated, I did not over mix.  Once baked, I took the cakes out of the pan and let them cool completely on a rack.  I made this 2 nights before I needed it for the birthday party.  So I wrapped the cakes in plastic and stuck them in the fridge.  Day before the party I took them out and assembled and frosted the cake, back in the fridge for the actual birthday.  Day of birthday I let it sit on the counter all afternoon at the birthday party.  I swear, the cake weighed 10 pounds.  The cake was dense, but moist and tasted PERFECT!!! You've got to try it!!

Hi, I just want to share my experience with this wonderful recipe that I found wile researching the internet looking for the perfect carrot cake, as many of us here at the site I read quite a few of the reviews and then I decided to try it myself, many of the reviews called for squeezing all the juice out of the carrots, well I didn't, after the 60 minutes with the sugar I squeezed the shredded carrots with my hands added them to the batter and then I add half of that liquid to the batter, from the dry ingredients I halved in half the cinnamon to two teaspoons then I added one teaspoon of allspice, one teaspoon of ground ginger, one teaspoon of cake spice and a cup of toasted coconut, bake it in a twelve inches pan to prevent any risk of undercooked spots in the cake, and decorated with cream cheese frosting two from this site, I'm going leave you with the first thing that came out of the mouth of the first person that try it: he said: honey this cake is first price cake contest!! I want the recipe exactly the way you did it!! It was the perfect deccert for our Thanksgiving dinner, thank you Nan.

Definitely NOT the best carrot cake ever. I already have a great carrot cake recipe but wanted to try this one expecting it to be so much better than my usual one, how disappointing!
I followed the recipe exactly and came out with a cake that was basically burnt in the outside and undercooked on the inside. I had to cover it in foil and stick in the oven much longer for it to cook thoroughly. 
This is a very dense, heavy cake, and the flavor was just ok, nothing extraordinary. I will not be making this recipe again; it was a waste of ingredients and time. Still trying to figure out if I missed anything... Very disappointing!

Very good but I think I should have kept with the original recipe.. I listened to others and drained off the carrot liquid...I know it would have been better if I left it as is and hadn't drained off the liquid

Read reviews first then followed ingredients as written. Used pre-diced walnuts instead of chopped. Shredded carrots with Super Salad Shooter (quicker than grating). In separate container, soaked raisins in one cup of warmed pineapple juice for one hour. Using stand-alone mixer on low setting, beat (rather than stirred) flour mixture into combined white sugar/oil/extract mixture in 3 portions. Added carrot mixture and nuts reversing Nan’s method; poured wet over carrot mixture - easier stirring with large spoon. Batter was a bit thick (adding 1/4-1/2 cup of juice would have made a difference, but it went down the drain). Poured batter into one bundt pan and one 8-inch round pan, filling each 1/2 full; baked 45 minutes. To use bundt pan, I first grease with veggie shortening making sure all crevices are thoroughly covered. I cut small pieces of cold butter and put 2-3 in narrow crevices on bottom/sides of pan then dab a very small amount of almond extract on top of butter. Cake does not stick to “bottom” when turning upside down on platter. Left icing off, cut cakes in pieces and placed each piece into separate quart size zipper bags. Lined medium-size box with aluminum foil to avoid freezer burns then boxed pieces and froze. Recipe/some reviews placed inside separate zipper bag and taped to box top. Texture is moist and taste is great; in 2-3 days it will be better. Thanks, Nan, for sharing your recipe.

This is an excellent carrot cake recipe.  The cake is a moister, denser cake, so it you are looking for a light, cakey cake then this is probably not the recipe for you.  

I wanted to make a smaller amount so I halved the recipe and baked it in a 13 x 9 baking pan and subtracted approximately 10 min from the baking time.  I chopped the carrots in the food processor until very fine instead of shredding them and added 1/8 tsp of ground cloves.  I also used the recommendation below to soak the raisins in the pineapple juice, which worked out really well.  I then iced the top of the sheet cake with the equivalent of 1 8-oz cream cheese package worth of cream cheese frosting.  If you like a very spicy carrot cake I would definitely add more spices.

The sheet cake turned out to be about 2 inches deep and I thought it tasted better the next day so this is an excellent recipe to make a day ahead or travel with.  It is a very easy cake to make and I will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

This came out AWESOME!  Perfect amount of batter for the two 10" cake pans.  It was moist, slightly dense and held together when decorating and serving.  A big hit and added it to my retail cake recipe collection.  For some more body, try adding a little bit of fresh coconut... yum!

I tried this recipe and was excited by all the great reviews. Boy! Was I disappointed when I tasted the finished cake. It's way too many carrots. I even reduced it to 5 cups. Too many to use with a hand shredder, that's for sure. The cake was too dense and rich. My batter was so orange and full of too many carrots, pineapples, nuts, and raisins. And the cream cheese recipe I found on the site to go with it , was way too sweet. I WOULD NOT recommended this recipe to anyone, it need's alot of reworking to improve it. I 'm glad other's enjoyed it. My family was disappointed. I couldnt give it a way with the way it tasted. I could have bought a store mix and added raisins and nuts and had a better tasting cake.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it for a ladie's birthday at work and everyone loved it. One lady told me that I am now the official cake maker for our office. It is rich moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing (I did use a 9X13 pan instead of 2 10" pans).  I highly recommend this recipe!

Nan,  this truly IS the best carrot cake recipe EVER! It is sublime in every way! Ever since my friend made a "from scratch" carrot cake for me the year my son was born, (30 years ago now), carrot cake has been my absolute favorite cake. The heck with chocolate or some fancy torte or well... pretty much anything and everything.. even red velvet! Give me a good carrot cake and a fork and let me at it! My daughter made this recipe for me last year, and I swear, I've never had any better, not even from the fancy Carytown bakery, Jean Jacques! She makes a couple of tweaks to it though! First, she soaks the raisins in rum, she uses fresh pineapple, and she toasts the walnuts. I was in heaven at first bite! Thanks so much  Nan! This year my darling daughter is repeating the performance and I am sure that it is now my "birthday tradition." In fact, a friend of mine once said that after 50 you don't have to have birthdays anymore. If it weren't for this carrot cake, I'd take her up on that one! Thanks so much~

this was a HUGE hit!  i made it for my husbands birthday and he can't stop talking about it.  i followed the recipe exactly as it says except i used 2 9x13 cake pans and i thought maybe the layers would be on the thin side but that was not the case at all.  this recipe makes 2 huge 9x13 cakes that would be plenty big on their own but stacked they make a HUGE DELICIOUS CAKE!

I followed the modifications/advice of other reviewers... draining carrots, pineapple; adding spices. Only down side was the amount of time it took. Makes me think I really do need a food processor... Didn't bother making frosting. Good & sweet enough without it!

I found this to be an exceptional carrot cake recipe! So moist and delightful, you cannot say enough good about this recipe. I would cut back slightly on the amount of grated carrots, but even if you follow the recipe exactly, it will be a keeper!

Very  good! I cut recipe down to half and baked in a 9 inch square pan. I added 1 tsp of baking powder in additon to  baking soda and it rose high.  I added a lot more spices like others suggested. I soaked  golden rasins in some brandy and drained pineapple juice.  When I  drained this I reserved 3T  to put back into the  cake batter. This is a very moist and dense  cake with  excellent flavor. It has a wonderful homemade taste.  I make my own cream cheese frosting ( I do not use a actual recipe as I just dump in the ingred.  and beat,then  taste as I go  (I put lemon juice in my frosting  too) I  will make  this cake again for sure! I just wanted to add that after  a few days this cake gets more moist and delicous as it  ages.

WOW!!! Yummy! I scaled this down to 12 servings because I didn't want to overflow my pan. I used whole wheat flour because it's a dark cake anyway, who's going to notice? and I cut the sugar back by about 2/3 cup because I don't like my cake insanely sweet. Also followed other reviewer's advice and used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. I toasted the walnuts before using them and it gave them a great flavor. If you like citrus flavor, it might be a good idea to add some grated lemon rind to the batter. Anyway, sorry to ramble, but this really is the BEST carrot cake ever. Texture and taste is perfect. And if you are seeking a perfect cream cheese frosting recipe, I recommend Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

I made this cake a day ahead of time because I believe cakes taste better the next day. It was wonderful! I will say that I added 1/4tsp of ginger in addition to the cinnamon and I squeezed a good portion of the juice out of the carrots prior to adding the brown sugar. Once the carrots rested for the hour there was just a little juice that accompanied the carrots and I wasn't afraid to add the entire content of the bowl to the cake. The texture was wonderful and I don't see why I would need to make any additional changes. This was a moist and flavorful cake that would satisfy any carrot cake craving.

This carrot cake was very moist! It was almost like the melt-in-your-mouth experience biting into this fine use for veggies.! Now, I must inform you reader-of-reviews, I am a very hard critic of carrot cakes, it being my favorite, and this, despite the very high remarks and reviews, was not my favorite. I found it hard to be able to even identify the spices that I so dearly love in this cake. If you are not that in tune with nutmeg and cinnamon and all things spice, then I would highly recommend this cake for you!!! It is very mild in flavour and maybe even a nice cleanser for your palate after a very robust, flavorful meal. The frosting is very light and cool. I even mistook it for the ever-so-common Cool Whip or Whipped Topping. I would have liked to be able to taste more of the cream cheese, as this too is my favorite frosting. Overall, this cake is good and very eatable but I would have liked to find more flavour. Very good still, just not my favorite.

Couldn't resist trying a recipe with so many 5 star ratings.
Made a couple of adjustments due to my personal preferences.
I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the cake batter.
I used  CRYSTALLAUREY's suggestions to drain off the excess liquid, and hydrating the raisins, but instead of just using water to hydrate, I used 1 cup warm water, 2 tbsp rum, 1/4 tsp of Grand Marnier and simmered for 15 mins.

I also used MelanieDC increased spice amount, since I love heavily spiced cake.

And finally, I used  DESSERTMAKER2's cream cheese frosting recipe, except I added 6 ounces of melted white chocolate.
Finally (as if this wasn't enough decadence, I used the rum sauce submitted by KDA949, but used 3 parts heavy cream, 1 part 2% milk and added 1 tsp of Grand Marnier.

I tasted the cake by itself and it is worthy of eating it that way.  Simply fabulous!
When the remaining ingredients were added, it simply elevated it beyond my expectations.
I made this cake for a co-worker who was going through rough times; one of those "life's curve balls" that we do not expect and fortunately things will be just fine.  I just wanted to make something for her to remind her that she has people at the office that are also thinking about her.

I never knew I liked carrot cake until I made this. It's REALLY good and if you were hesistant about making it, I recommend you'd just do it.
So here are some things that may help you out. Firstoff, cut the recipe in half and you have exactly one cake (I put batter in 2x 10 inch pans) I used almost 2 lbs of ungrated carrots to come up with approx. 3 cups of grated and drained about 80% of the liquid as per suggestion of another reviewer. I wasn't sure how this affected consistency because this is my first carrot cake, but it was just the right moistness. If you haven't yet, try some golden raisins. These taste so much better than regular and it'll really help to have them in the cake. I used the  cream cheese frosting II on this site and that frosting complements this cake perfectly.
The only bad thing about this cake is that it does take lots of effort/time to grate, but the end justifies the means so I'm sticking with 5 stars.

Wonderful recipe.  Very hearty (as a good carrot cake should be).  I made mine in 2 9" rounds and sliced each one in half horizontally.  Layers one and two and two and three were seperated with cream cheese frosting.  Between three and four I made an pinapple orange marmalade (just heated smuckers marmalade, added crushed pinapple and corn startch to thicken).  Once it cooled, I sppread it between the final layers.  The entire cake was then covered in the c.c. frosting and it was truely to die for.

This has become my go to carrot cake recipe over the past several years...with a few edits.  I always use pecans instead of walnuts as a matter of personal taste.  Add the raisins to the carrots and brown sugar and let them sit for a good hour. The raisins plump up, and the carrots aren't overly wet. What liquid is left, I do try to leave in the bowl; it's only a couple of tablespoons.  Make sure the pineapple is drained and instead of oil, I use unsweetened applesauce.  The cake never turns into a gooey mess, but is perfectly moist.

Ok so I've never baked a carrot cake before but I decided I was gonna try to do one for a birthday cake! But there's a few things I removed for allergy reasons and not liking, I didn't add the raisins and the walnuts and I bought grated carrots from the store and soaked them over night in the brown sugar with Jamaican rum for a little ummph,and in the morning I removed them from the liquified mixture of rum and brown sugar and threw the soaked carrots in the blender for a few turns so most of the carrots were extremely grated and some we're not so there was actual pieces of carrots in the cake and the pineapple I threw into the blender also so it was more of a mush.I didn't have the problems of the cake being too moist it was perfect cake consistency.However I had to bake the cake for a little over an hour cause at 50 mins the middle still wasn't completely done and I only used one pan overall and also didn't use the icing cause my family couldn't wait to taste it because it smelled oh so delicious

This was a MAJOR YUM!.  But I did make one change. Instead of using 1 cup of oil, I used the drained pineapple juice and oil to equal 1 cup.  It was almost equal parts. I had 2 nine inch pans so I also made 6 large cup cakes.  Next time I'll make 3 thinner 9 inch layers.

The best carrot cake ever...though I recommend to read reviews on straining the carrots and pineaples thoroughly so that your cake doesnt get so soggy in the center after baking..I kept it longer by 10 to pass the tooth pick test

Absolutely delicious!  Marinating the carrots and raisins in the brown sugar is fabulous!  The reaction is always the same when I make this cake, "You should open a bake shop!!"

Wonderful cake!!! I followed the recipe exactly instead of baking it in the two pans I baked it in a 12 inch springform pan and separated it into two layers. I used a cream cheese recipe I found on the site and it was a wonderful compliment to the cake! LOVE IT!!!

I added dried cranberries (1/4 c) & 1/2 coconut.  Two layers is much too heavy and makes for ridiculous serving.  9 x 13 much more sensible.  Unless you're a glutton.

Yum, I will definitely make this recipe again!  After first reading many of the reviews, I decided to make cupcakes on my first go around.  I used 5 cups of carrots instead of 6.  Since I was making cupcakes and wanted them to be a little puffy, I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder with the flour mixture.  I strained the carrot - brown sugar mixture reserving 3 Tbs,  which I then added back into the batter.  I had pecans on hand which I used instead of the walnuts.  I will definitely be sharing this recipe with all friends and loved ones. This recipe netted me 14 large cupcakes.

I rescaled this recipe to 12 servings to make two 9" layers which needed to bake about 40-42 minutes.  I used applesauce in place of half of the oil.  The cake turned out very good, but I am not sold on the process of the carrots sitting in brown sugar for an hour.  My observation was that the carrot shreds went from plump to shriveled, tougher pieces in a pool of their juices.  I thought the texture of the carrots deteriorated by doing this.  The recipe depends on the liquid that is extracted from the carrots so that cannot be modified in this recipe.  No one else seems to comment on this, so maybe it's just me?  Otherwise, it seems like a nice cake that could use just a little other spice besides just cinnamon.

This cake is amazing; very rich and dense. I cut down on the oil and sugar by using half applesauce and half Splenda. Definitely drain the carrots with either cheesecloth or strong paper towels. I find it best to not squeeze all the moisture out; this leaves the cake moist. The first time I made it with a white chocolate buttercream frosting. 2nd time I just used powdered sugar. I really don't think it needs frosting; it is that good. This cake is a real crowd pleaser. Next time I will try it with all applesauce (no oil) and stevia instead of white sugar.

The name says it all with this cake. I made these into cupcakes along with my own cream cheese frosting and decorated them with marzipan carrots. I halved the recipe, because I only had enough carrots for 3 cups. It made 18 regular sized cupcakes. My husband took them to his office and said they were gone before the morning meeting. It received nothing but rave reviews. It is a very dense, moist, flavorful cake, which I love! Other than halving it, the only thing I did different was to add a couple more spices to it, like nutmeg and allspice. Follow the mixing instructions, and you won't be disappointed.

I bake regularly, so don't think it was just me, but this was not good at all. Way too many carrots and wasn't sweet enough. My son loves everything I bake and he didn't like it at all. I was totally disappointed. I did look up other recipes and compare and they only called for 4 cups instead of 6 cups of carrots. I wish I would have went with my gut on that and cut back the carrots. The cake looked really pretty when I was done though.

I have to give this recipe the full 5 stars.  One of out guests actually said (without any prompting) "This is the best carrot cake ever"! There were still raves a few days later. I thought I already had the best recipe but having misplaced it, had to go on a search for another - this recipe was the result.  I needed carrot cake as it was our birthday person's favorite. I've never liked the idea of putting pineapple in carrot cake but it worked perfectly with this recipe.  I don't use walnuts and subbed with very finely cut pecans.  The author's note said it made a lot of cake - and it does - so I baked it in a bundt cake pan and had enough left over to also make a small loaf, which I iced and put in the freezer for another time (always good to have extra for emergencies).  This recipe is the one I will go to in future.

This is a fabulous recipe.  My twist on it is to soak the raisins in rum, halve the cinnamon and add a teaspoon of nutmeg and one of allspice.  After chopping the walnuts and separating out the larger pieces to put in the cake, I was left with a good amount of powdered nut. Normally I would keep it to add to my apple bread recipe, but I decided to swap two tablespoons of the powdered nut for the same of flour.  I figured it couldn't hurt and you can't let a good nut go to waste.  I used Kitchen Aid's cream cheese icing, which is great; in the future, though, I will use a lot of icing between layers so it bulges out the side and just a dollop on top, but place a bowl with the remaining icing alongside the cake for hardcore icing lovers.  The cake itself is just so good on its own and I think it's overkill to cover it completely.  Again, a great recipe.

Excellent carrot cake.  Much better than Carrot Cake III.  Everything you expect in a carrot cake.  I made it in 9.25 in pans in three layers and it, of course, baked quicker and made a beautiful cake.  This cake replaces all other carrot cake recipes that I have used in the past.  I made it exactly as the recipe called and had no problems with it being too moist or not cooking evenly.  I think making it in three layers helps remedy this problem.

OUTSTANDING! This cake gets rave reviews. I am allergic to walnuts, so I used pecans and it's wonderful. Notes: 7-8 large carrots is about 6 cups; and it fits perfectly in a 9 x 13 pan, baked at 325 for 50 minutes; use half of the recipe for the frosting if making a single layer in the 9 x 13 pan. You will love this cake!

Since some of the reviewers had mentioned they thought it was a little bland, I added 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. mace. (This last one is optional.)  I baked it in a 9 x 12 lasagne pan at 350 degrees for an hour.  My husband and I think it's the best carrot cake we've ever eaten!  Carole from Monroe Twp., NJ

This cake deserves 5 stars.  I have made this cake at least 10xs. Once I got as far as shredding the carrots with the added brown sugar and then had to stop. I placed a lid on the bowl and put it in the frig.  I wasn't able to continue til the next day. From that time on, I started marinated the carrots overnight.  I soak the raisens and add with carrots and brown sugar.  The rest is history, I just follow the instructions.  The first time I made it, I swore I'd never make it again.  It was so much work.  I call it labor of love.  I use 9"pans because I don't own 10" pans.  It would be good as a 3 tier as some have suggested.  No matter what size pans, the cake is the best.

Made this for my dad (carrot cakes' biggest fan). He loved it! I ended up making a few changes, mostly because I was so short on time. I used a bag & a half of "matchstick" carrots - about five cups. Gave them a rough chop & soaked them with the raisins in pineapple juice, brown sugar and about 1/4 cup rum for an hour. While everything was soaking, I prepared the batter. Added a 1/2 tsp of baking POWDER and substituted 1/2 cup apple cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil, as suggested. Omitted walnuts b/c my dad can't eat them. The batter was so thick that it was slowing down my mixer! I added all the liquid that was left in the carrot-soaking bowl (about a cup), which made the batter quite runny. Folded in the carrots, pineapple & raisins. Baked for about 50 minutes in two 9 inch rounds. Came out perfectly. Super moist & full of flavor. I also had enough batter to make six (heaping) cupcakes. I baked those for about 20 minutes. Used the cream cheese frosting recipe found on this site for the frosting. Will make this again & again. Thank you!!

Loved it!! My husband practically ate the whole thing within a few days. Carrots do take awhile to grate by hand but I dont think I will do it any other way. I like to grate them super fine. I am making it again today

This was my first carrot cake.  I researched many recipes and tips before deciding on this one, and it came out beautifully!  Here's what I adjusted from the original:  for 2 9-inch cake pans, I scaled the recipe to 12 servings; by request, I omitted the raisins and nuts; I added ingredients this way: to the carrots & sugars, I added a 20-oz. can of barely drained crushed pineapple (I did not squeeze out or dry the pineapple...I pretty much poured off the extra liquid on top and kept the rest), spices (cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger), and vanilla; I did not drain or strain any of the wet mixture before adding in the eggs, oil, and flour  mixture (dry ingredients).  I also used a regular buttercream frosting, again by request.  The cake's density, moisture, and taste were perfect all the way around, and it was very well received.

I made this completely as directed... it was the most delicious Carrot Cake i have ever tasted, and it recieved so many compliments on my mum's birthday from all the guests. If you are not looking for a really super dense moist carrot cake, then look elsewhere - but for those of you that can't resist the heavenly moist cake that this recipe will give you - then go for it! You wont be dissapointed by the result. Seriously, i cant give enough compliments! Thanks for the great recipe!

My son wanted carrot cake for 19th birthday.  Always look at this website for new recipes. This was a great recipe.  Time consuming but well worth it.  To make it easier baked in 9 X 13 pan and used Cream Cheese Frosting II.  Do not need to use all the frosting as it can take away from the great taste of the cake.

Very moist, quite tasty.  A bit too much oil, though.  I made the cake again with just half the oil and it was still plenty moist.

This is a very dense rich cake that easily serves 16.  I reduced the raisins to 1/2 C. and chopped them because my husband doesn't like whole raisins in cake but he likes the flavor.  I increased the vanilla to 3 t., added 1/2 t. ground cloves, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/4 t. allspice and it turned out great.  It's excellent with Cream Cheese Frosting II (the one with 2 C. powdered sugar) from this site. This recipe is definitely a keeper and very appropriately named!

This is one awesome cake. It is always requested for family gatherings and everyone raves about it. I like tall layers so I make it in 2 8" cake pans and use the allspice cream cheese frosting that I found on this site. Excellent!

This cake is wonderful!  Everyone loved it, including my kids who don't like most of the things in it.  I followed the suggestions in previous reviews, and only added 5 cups of carrots instead of 6.  I also cut the veg. oil back to 2/3 cup.  In addition to the cinnamon, I added 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves and ground ginger.  
The only thing I found confusing was wether or not to add the liquid that came off the carrot and br. sugar mixture after sitting for one hour.  I decided to add half of it, and the cake could not have been better!  Frost with cream cheese icing, and decorate with some extra chopped walnuts....YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

The title says it all!  I made this recipe for Easter, and my entire family couldn't stop raving about it (or eating it!)  I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and didn't add the raisins.  I also used a lighter cream cheese frosting so it wouldn't cover the flavor of the cake.  Absolutely delicious!  This has become THE family favorite!!

I made this recipe as written except I halved it (only 2 of us in this household!) and I baked it in a ring pan so it would be like my favourite coffee shop's carrot cake. And it really was like the coffee shop cake - amazing! This cake is rich and dense and so delicious. It is even better on the second and third day.

I've been making carrot cake for years and this is the first recipe I have found that uses LOTS of carrots.  My family loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to double the cinnamon and add small amounts of nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  Very moist, heavy and wonderful!

Excellent...definitely the "Best Ever". I made it exactly according to the recipe, less the raisins, and it was perfect.  
Over the years and the many times I've made it, I've altered it to be more healthy: I do half whole-wheat flour/half white, cut the white sugar down to 1 cup, use olive oil, and put the crushed pineapple on the bottom, covered by the batter.  Any way you do it, this is a GREAT recipe!

I love this cake! I have made it several times for birthday's and holidays and it has always come out moist and delish! I did change a few changes.. For the oil I did half apple sauce and half melted coconut oil... and for the spices I added a dash more cinnamon, also about a teaspoon each of ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. I also did not add the raisins. And if you want to get really fancy I made maple covered walnuts! 
But all in all, best carrot cake ever!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly with one exception; I poured the batter into three 9" pans to make a 3 layer cake.  Turned out perfectly.

I made 2 changes : 1) left out the raisins, and 2) drained the pineapple. It was not necessary to squeeze out the carrots. I used 2 round 10" cake pans. If you can buy finely shredded carrot, do it, as grating 6 cups is really a lot of effort.
The cake baked perfectly. This is a wonderfully/delicious cake, and has become my husbands' favorite (who does not have a sweet tooth).Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Went the healthy route and substituted 1/2 C honey& 1/2C molasses for sugar.  used 1/2 wheat flour instead of all while flour.  Used 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce & only 1/2C oil (Canola).  For the icing, used 8 oz. 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 4 oz regular cream cheese. Turned out perfectly and we didn't feel guilty eating second helpings!

I tried this even though I didn't really care for carrot cake. That changed after the first bite. So many people complimented me even a chef friend of mine whose mum is well known for hers. I soaked some raisins in rum for a few hours. Thanks for this one

Hands down the BEST!! I do tweak it a little. I really squeeze all the liquid out of the pineapple and  for spices I add ginger, orange peel, cinnamon and allspice. I also use toasted pecans instead of walnuts.

I made this but left out the raisins and walnuts. I followed the rest of the directions exactly, and it was fantastic! Everyone that ate it was impressed, and I've had several requests for the recipe. For the frosting, I used 1 stick of unsalted butter, 2 oz bricks of cream cheese, and about a cup and a half of confectioner's sugar.

An excellent cake.  My first time cooking it I was mindful of some of the reviews suggesting straining out more fluid to keep the cake from being to puddingy.  Second time I tried the cake I still strained the fluid moderately well but added back 2 TBL of the carrot juice/brown sugar mix.  Tremendously moist, just shy of puddingy.

This was the best carrot cake I have ever made.  It was extremely moist, and flavor was just awesome!! I am getting request to make this over and over.  The only thing I did different was not add the raisins, but that was just due to preference.  The Cake was the best!!!!

Worth the time and effort!  I used my food processor to grate the carrots which saved me quite a bit of time.  The cake turned out so moist and yummy!  I didn't have enough raisins, so I used some cranraisins, diced prunes and figs.  I also substituted a 1/2 cup of the oil for 1/4 cup mashed banana and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I made a cream cheese frosting that was on another recipe from this site.  It was 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups powdered sugar.  In addition, I added about a 1 tsp. lemon juice and a little extra powdered sugar.  I whipped it until fluffy.  After frosting the cakes, I zested some lemon on top.  The cakes looked so pretty and tasted fabulous!  I used 2 spring form pans and cut parchment paper to line the bottoms.  I think I will bake this in spring form pans again as it made cooling and removal so easy.  Oh, I also took the suggestion from another review and added 1/4 tsp of each ginger, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom.  Loved the extra spices.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made this cake for my mother's birthday and I was really disappointed. I should have listened to my instincts and added more leaving agent.  It was dense and very sticky. It tasted good but I'll go bake to my trusted Betty Crocker recipe next time.

The best carrot cake I have ever had. This is my go to recipe for most occasions. The first time I made it for Thanksgiving - everyone had this cake and ate no pie for dessert. I bake in 3-8 1/2" pans for 40-45 mins.

be sure to strain the pineapple very well if you want the cake to be fluffy.

This cake was just ok.  It was heavy and dense and not light and fluffy like a cake should be. Folks giving this recipe 5 stars have no idea how good carrot cake can be.

Following the directions exactly, you will end up with a very moist and delicious carrot cake. A couple mentioned it's a little TOO moist for their liking, but overall it was still a huge hit. Only change: used pecans in place of walnuts. I really appreciated that the cake used more carrots than other recipes typically do--very nice!

I soaked the raisins in the drained pineapple juice and a quarter cup of RUM.  I drained the liquid from the carrot brown sugar mixture.  I added a little nutmeg, cloves and ginger and baking powder per other reviews. The spices were good, but I honestly dont think the baking powder made a difference.  NOW, the way to make this extra good- I split each layer in half and before frosting spooned the liquid used from soaking the raisins over each layer. Needed a little extra rum at the end to finish the last layer.  This makes it moist and gives the perfect ratio for frosting to a good dense, moist cake!!   Definitely top resturant quality.

I'm a college student, and didn't have a grater when a friend and I decided to make carrot cake. We took a trip to the grocery store and finally decided to used the kind of carrots that are sold for salad. We got a 10oz package and I just chopped them pretty thoroughly until the pieces were quite small. I used that instead of grated carrots, but followed the recipe otherwise... excepect NO RAISINS! The batter wasn't that pretty, but when it came out it looked great. I really liked the texture from the small pieces of carrots and it didn't effect the taste at all. I would definitely recommend carrot cake with the matchstick cut carrots, and might even prefer it over grated carrots.

I made these as cupcakes for a bake sale and they came out so good. The recipe made about 35 medium sized cupcakes and I baked them at 350 for about 25 minutes. I made some modifications based on other reviews. I soaked the raisins in warm water for an hour. I used canned pineapple and drained the juices. I used my food processor to grate the carrots, it saved so much time. I drained the juice from the carrots and sugar after they were soaking for an hour. I added about 2 tablespoons of each, pineapple juice and carrot juice back into the batter. I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp nutmeg. I used a cream cheese icing which included melted marshmallows in the recipe that I have used before and liked.

This was a very good recipe.  Since I am not particular about raisins in my carrot cake, I substituted the raisins for 1 cup of shredded coconut (sweetened).  Absolutely delicious.  I used a 9X12 pan and it took about 1 hour to cook.  I didn't have the problem with the liquids being too much and the cake rose to perfection.  This recipe is a keeper!

It really is the best carrot cake EVER. I've tried several other recipes and this one is the best. Cut the recipe in half and made 18 cupcakes. The carrots do take a little time to grate (used a cheese grater) but asides from that, it was a simple recipe. I read some of the other reviews and I couldn't figure out what to strain. In the end, I strained the pineapples but not the carrots. Substituted pecans for walnuts and added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. Used Cream Cheese Frosting II to finish it off. Absolutely delicious and moist!! Lasted a single day at our house!

After reading through most of the reviews for several of the carrot cakes on this site, I chose this recipe.  I never had much luck with my previous carrot cakes--it seemed they always turned out either like pudding or too oily or just tasted funny. This cake was perfect--with a few changes.  First, although this was not a change, I made sure that my eggs were creamed VERY well. Second, I exchanged half of the oil for applesauce to prevent it from becoming too oily. Thirdly, since it seemed so heavy, I divided the batter between three pans instead of the two pans and increased the oven heat initially to allow a higher rise and then decreased the heat to let the center cook without burning the edges.  Dividing into three pans not only allowed the cake to be done sooner, but also provided more "drama".  (It just seems more elite to have three layers instead of two.) This cake turned out very moist and yet still have a nice crumb to it.  Despite adding 4 tsp. of cinnamon it really wasn't very spicy.  If using a butter cream frosting, it would be perfect, but if using a cream cheese frosting or if you are looking for a spicy cake, then I would add more cinnamon and possibly some nutmeg and allspice.  Try this recipe, but I would suggest dividing it into three pans instead of two to prevent it from becoming too heavy.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out fantastic. I had a carrot cake recipe (which I lost) that the family always loved, but they like this one better, this is not as oily as my last one. Instead of making a cake with this recipe. I made muffins - baked @ 325 in my convection oven for 23 minutes. It made about 30 muffins and they were awesome with the cream cheese frosting also from this site.

This was pretty darn good...I subbed applesauce for the oil, though, to save calories & fat. Soaked the carrots in brown sugar in the fridge overnight. I added 1/2 tsp. each of nutmeg and cloves, too. Also cut the recipe down to 12 servings from 16 (and baked in 9" pans not 10"), as it was just me & my honey for Valentine's Day dessert. Made this with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, turned out really tasty. Watch your baking time if you reduce the recipe, I overbaked mine on accident and the edges of the cake were on the dry side. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Awesome cake. I halved the recipe, used a bundt pan and added a bit (with a fork) of frosting. Dense and moist and rich with all the goodies. For sure going to make it again, probably add more baking soda to make it rise a bit more, try using less oil and adding more spices. But that is for personal taste. Reminds me of the truly best ever vegan carrot cake I had.

I think this is missing the step of draining the liquids.  I made this cake before as directed and everyone hated it.  It really was the Gas station variety but, worse.  If you add the carrots and the brown sugar as directed there is way too much liquid.  I drained the liquid throughout preperation, measued it, and (no joke) it was +3 c. I modified the recipe by taking out 2 c. of carrots and adding 2 c. of zuchini. This time I made it,  it was perfect.  I used a 12 X 15 inch pan instead of two pans. My method also reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.  The cake was 2" thick after cooking. I grated the carrots and zuchini and set them aside for 1 hr.  Then I drained them.  I added the raisins and brown sugar, stired and set them aside a 1/2 hr.  Then I drained them and added the pinapple to this and immediately drained it again by pressing into the mixture with the back of a spoon inside a colander.  Then I added it to the badder and added back 1/2 of brown sugar (but next time I would use the whole cup). I would make this cake modified again.  Everyone loved it.  My mom who really hated it the last time I made it couldn't believe it was the same recipe. It was dense but fluffy and with the cream cheese frosting my mom said, "when I die and am going out of this world I am going to think of this cake."  I'm sure she was kidding.  But it is a GREAT recipe if you take out the liquid.

Made this cake and the other highly rated carrot cake from this website (Awesome Carrot Cake...) one weekend.  My husband and I liked this one better - although the other was quite good too. I did follow the previous suggestions and added less oil and less carrots. It works out better too if you only slightly drain the pineapples.

The very first time I made this recipe was probably close to 7 years ago.  When I was searching for a recipe because I had never made carrot cake before, I googled "best carrot cake ever recipe" of course this is the first thing that popped up.  It's not a lie, it really is the best. The only thing I have ever done to tweek it, is that after I mix the carrots and brown sugar together I soak my raisins in super hot water mixed half with alcohol.  Tonight I am using brandy because it's what I have. Six cups of carrots is a lot to grate by hand with a grater, if you have a food processor I recommend using it. My hubby and I grated carrots until our knuckles bled the first time and after I bought my food processor this is the first thing I made.  Cuts prep down significantly, by at least 85%. I've also never rated anything before, so let that say something about this recipe. I want the world to know that it is amaze-balls!!

I have tried this recipe and it is the bomb. I lost it for a while but I just found it again and I have added it to my recipe box. I will not lose it again. This makes the best carrot cake. I think its the way you have to soak the carrots in the brown sugar. I usually soak the shredded carrots in the brown sugar for 30 minutes, then add the raisins and soak all that for the last 30 minutes. This is the bomb recipe.

Thank you, thank you, thank you --- a thousand times, THANK YOU!  A year or so ago I loaned one of my favorite cookbooks to someone and they,  (sadly), lost it. This book happened to have my go-to carrot cake recipe in it. If I could've remembered it, it wouldn't have been an issue, but the ol' mind just isn't what it used to be, y'know?  Anyhooo, your recipe appears to be the same one I've used for years and lost, so, again, Thank You!!!! Can't wait to make it this afternoon for a dear friends birthday. Also, as others have mentioned, I also strain my carrots & crushed pineapple - but only slightly, as I prefer a very moist cake.  I also omit the walnuts ... just not a fan of them, although I *sometimes*ssubstitute with toasted pecan pieces.  Often, I simply omit the nuts altogether ... this cake is still excellent without them! Mmmmmmm, carrot cake, cream cheese frosting ..... yum! I better stop before I start drooling on my keyboard lol. PS: If you prefer a spicier tasting cake nutmeg (not too much!!), works well in this and I sometimes add pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon .... I like a spice-y taste to my carrot cake. As a side note, pumpkin pie spice & cinnamon work really well in Oatmeal Raisin cookies too!

Giving it 4 stars as I made multiple changes after reading the reviews.  Drained carrots (grated them large) and pineapple and batter was still very moist.  I also used 3 sifted cups of white lilly flour and added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, and ginger as well as 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Left out raisins and used pecans as I don't like walnuts. Baked in three 9 inch pans for about 35 min. Used cream cheese icing (5tblsp butter, 8oz cream cheese, 2 1/2 c. confectioner's sugar, 1tsp vanilla, lemon zest).

Cake was DELICIOUS.  The 80+ year old matriarch and reigning baker of the family proclaimed it tasted "like a professional had made it."

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I felt like it was carrot bread more than carrot cake.  As is, the recipes lacks.  The flavors mingle well together, but the bread like texture was a total turn off, for me at least.

Have tried this recipe and it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. I added 3/4 cup browned coconut in the recipe and it enhances the flavor.

This really and truly is the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. It is delectably moist and has just the right amount of sweetness. It is very, very rich, however, and extremely dense. My husband made this cake for my birthday and, had we known how thick and dense it was, we'd have halved the recipe. Our family of four couldn't finish an entire cake ourselves!  I'd definitely recommend this recipe to anyone but if you're making it for a small, home gathering, half the recipe. As is, this recipe would be great for a large potluck or family reunion!

i only made one tiny change to this (cut the vegetable oil in half and substituted apple sauce for the remainder). it was awesome... i was reluctant to present it to my father who loves carrot cake, but he raved about this version for weeks. Thank you so much!

This is my first review, but I felt the need to defend Nan's recipe.  I was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the negative reviews.  I needed to make a Carrot Cake for a birthday at work (we pay the cake forward), and I was attracted to this recipe because it made a large cake.  Everyone LOVED it.  All I could hear were the ooohs and aaahs.  It was moist, but not soggy, as some said.  I had to use 9-inch pans, but it was not a problem. As at least one other person said, this is the carrot cake recipe I have been looking for. Thank you, Nan!

I LOVE this carrot cake. It truly is one of the best I've ever had.
The only thing I did different was soak the raisins in pineapple juice. I think it would have been the best I've ever had, had I taken the time to make frosting, rather than using canned. But I was feeling lazy after grating 6 cups of carrots!!! 
All that said, I will say, it IS a dense, heavy cake. But that's how carrot cake is supposed to be.

I agree this is the best carrot cake.But I found that the recipe was to much so I cut the recipe in half.And baked it in a bundt pan.
Cut the cooking time to 45min. Perfect.

ill have to say make it the day before and refrigerate. I tried it the day i made it and i was initially disappointed, tasted like a carrot salad and kinda crumbly and grainy. The next morning i tried it again and it was great. i guess the flavors needed to meld together and it was moister. i will make this one again

Based on the other reviews, I was expecting this cake to be out of this world good. I followed the recipe exactly, without the walnuts, and I strained the carrots as others suggested. I thought the cake lacked flavor, was heavy but not moist at all, and was too crusty on the outside. Next time I won't strain as much, will add some applesauce or something, and won't soak the raisins. I don't think soaking the raisins added anything at all.

This cake is SO moist and SO delicious! And I don't even really like carrot cake! However, it's my mom's favorite so I made this recipe (sans raisins) for her 60th birthday party and it was a HIT! Everyone raved about it and wanted to know how I'd gotten it so moist....must've been the pineapple! My only tip is to make sure you strain the carrots really well in cheesecloth. Oh, and I used baby carrots.

I took the advice of crystallaurey listed here in the reviews!!!  I made sure all liquids were strained.  In fact, I have a great tip: use your juicer for the carrots!!!  I have an amazing Breville juicer and so I juiced all the carrots needed - they were super dry and shredded.  Then I added 3 tablespoons of the liquid back to the carrot/brown sugar mixture.  I also drained the pineapples in a strainer with only 1 TbS of liquid back ---- Amazing

I first  followed this recipe to the letter and has been ever since .I made sure that the grated carrots and the pineapple were completely squeezed of all liquid beforehand.
I also paired this with the Wilton Special cream cheese frosting recipe that adds orange juice to the cream cheese frosting..and now it's a major hit with my customers.:-)

This was a delicious cake. Thank you for whomever left the tip on soaking the raisins; I did. Also, after the carrots sat with the brown sugar, I drained most of that off, drained the pineapple well and it was a HIT.

i'm not a fan of carrot cake, but my husband loves it.  i made this one, thinking that it would make 2 layers of cake, but it made one 10'' layer.  a very dense one at that, but everyone loved it.  i made it for his birthday today, and it was a success!  i made it without the raisins and nuts (his request), but it worked well with the cream cheese icing.

great  recipe...I brought this to a potluck dinner party for someone who does not eat dairy and I used a simple lemon glaze instead of the cream cheese frosting. after a very full dinner when the cake was served folks just could not stop eating it. I was kind of surprised by the reaction but the cake was really good!

I loved this recipe! I made this for my boyfriend and family. Everyone loved it! I was a little bit worried while I was making this but it turned out amazing!(: I read some reviews and changed some things. I didn't add any pineapple. I only added like 3 and a half or 4 cups of carrots because I know some people in my family don't really like carrots. I only let mine bake for 40 minutes and it was done. I loved this recipe and so did everyone else. I will defiently do this again soon!(:

I made cupcakes with this recipe. I followed the recipe but I drained the carrots, didn't use pineapple, and only let the carrots rest with the brown sugar for about 20 min. I baked the paper lined cupcakes for 21 min at 350. So yummy! It made about three dozen.

Hands down it's the best; I've been baking carrot cakes for years with very involved, multi-ingredient recipes and I was skeptical as this one had so few ingredients - well less is more!  Everyone has said this is the best carrot cake ever so there is little use in making any other  Naturally I paired it with a cream cheese frosting and made a three 9" layer cake.  I did however soak the raisins in the pineapple juice with some rum just to make the raisins a bit softer.  Simply the best.

I made this for Easter and it was fantastic! I have 9" pans so I reduced the servings down to 12 and baked for 45 minutes. I followed others by doubling the cinnamon, soaking the raisins in the drained pineapple juice, and making sure the baking soda didn't sit and mix with the other ingredients too long. I was a little unsure when it came to adding the carrots and brown sugar mixture. After reading many comments I decided to squeeze most of the liquid out by the handful, but didn't go so far as to use a cheesecloth. The result was a moist cake that wasn't soggy or oily like carrot cake can sometimes be. Many family members said it was the best carrot cake they have ever had. I will definitely be making this one again without changing a thing.

OMG...soooooooo good!!!  I made two 10" layers which I cut in half and frosted with cream cheese icing and topped with coconut to make a 4 layer cake.  It was HUGE!!!!!  Very nice presentation and amazing flavor.  It impressed everyone for Easter and I will  definitely make again.

Best is actually the word to describe it! I omitted the pineapples (really don't like them in any of my cooking) and used honey instead of sugar in the batter. Turned out so yummy and moist, perfect! Also thanks to some reviewersfor the cream cheese glazing, although I did reduce the sugar there (maybe a typo?). I also added some lemon rind to the glaze.

This cake is amazing.  I made it this last weekend for my daughter 14th birthday party.  We made a simple cream cheese frosting for the cake.  The kids, and parents were all talking about how good the cake was, and my wife declared this the best carrot cake she had ever had.  We did take the suggestion and soak the raisins in the pineapple juice while the carrots were sitting with the brown sugar.  We also used whole wheat flour.

Excellent.  A true gourmet carrot cake, dense, delicious and full of flavor.  I did not make major changes, only alterations to make it a little more healthy (save a few fat grams when you're eating something so decadent).  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and replaced half the oil w/unsweetened applesauce.  I also threw in some unsweetened coconut.  The "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this sight was perfect to frost the cake.

I have to agree with the name, this was delicious and I can't seem to stop eating it. I didn't change the recipe but I did put my raisins in with the carrots and brown sugar for the 1 hour. I didn't work hard to try to squeeze all of the liquid out of the carrots but just used a spoon to transfer them to the batter along with whatever liquid happened to go in. I used 3, 9-inch round pans (based on some other reviews) and baked for 30 minutes. My cake turned out dense and moist the way I think carrot cake should be. I used the cream cheese frosting II from this site (but added 1 extra cup powdered sugar for sweetness). I made this for my neighbor's birthday and he and his wife each took one bite and said it was an excellent recipe. I can't wait to make this again and plan to offer to bring it for Easter.

Made this cake again this time for a baby shower and it was a hit (again) with guests begging for the recipe. 5 stars each time! I wouldn't change a thing.

I do wedding cakes, and whenever I have a request for carrot cake, I use this recipe.  By far the best ever!  I just don't add the raisins and add 1 and a half teaspoons baking powder as well and the cake comes out perfect every time!  If you haven't tried this recipe, you haven't had carrot cake!

WARNING TO POTENTIAL BAKERS!! Please disregard 5 star ratings from people who have CHANGED the recipe ingredients or proportions!!!!! it is VERY deceiving and misleading for the people, like myself, who would rather not read through hundreds of slightly altered versions of this recipe. That being said, the FLAVOUR is fantastic, but i followed the recipe with no substitutions or changes to amount of ingredients (i did drain the carrots and pineapple very very well to avoid added moisture, i dont think that is mentioned in it) and the cake was still very dense, NOT at all a fluffy moist cake, which is what i was hoping for. I'll keep looking for a carrot cake recipe that is great on its own.

really, this is great cake... but I skip raisins, so it doesn't turn up anyone's nose from the get go... I only lightly sprinkle nuts on top so they are easy to scrape off... my husband thinks all dessert should be "female"...

YUM, this recipe is WONDERFUL!  I have baked this now several times for family birtdays, I always get compliments on it being moist and substantial.  It is a real crowd pleaser.  I recommend frosting with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site.

I'm definitely not the bast baker but decided to give it my all and make my dad a carrot cake for his birthday, his favorite.
I followed the modifications from CRYSTALLAUREY review (minus the pineapple, because i forgot, but later added to the center filling!) everyone loved it, and they weren't just saying it, this cake is amazing! Follow CRYSTALLAUREY recommendations and you've got a winner

i can't even describe this...it really is the best!
Suggestions: plump the raisins in warm water (previously mentioned), drain the pineapples + 2 tbsp of pineapple juice liquid, used pre-shredded bags of carrots (contains little to no water content). We used 1/4 cup walnuts (this was plenty for us...i think a cup would be too many)

White Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting Recipe I made up:
1 8oz cream cheese softened,
1 sugar free White Chocolate Pudding Mix,
1/4 cup confectioner's sugar,
3/4 cup cool whip,
1 cup milk,
1 tsp vanilla extract, and blend all ingredients together and chill for 30 minutes

This cake was wonderful. I made a few changes like so many others. I added fresh pineapple and saved the juice when I crushed it. Then I used the juice to soak the raisins with a little hot water and 1 tbs dark rum. The raisins were so plump and tasty.When it came time to add carrots I just dumped out a splash of the soaking liquid. The cake was perfect. I have had rave reviews by all who have tried it. Thanks for the recipe

This is an excellent carrot cake recipe! My only suggestion would be to make this as a sheet cake - it's just too rich to serve as a layer cake.

Tried the recipe today and it came out okay. I read 2-3 pages of the reviews and tried some of the variations that were made and I have to say, 1.use all of the 1C of oil, drain the pineapple but not completely,do reduce the white sugar and add nutmeg. I'll have to make this one again trying some different variations, but for the most part cake was good.

You definitely need to DRAIN the liquids off, like every last little drop. I LOVE to cook and usually can make any recipe work...but this cake came out like a soupy pudding!  I have it in the oven to try to see if cooking it longer will fix it.  Follow the recipe to a "T".  Maybe I didn't drain off my pineapple juice enough. The batter was tasty though.

Instead of making a full cake, I made this into 36 cupcakes and they turned out wonderful.  I had men and women both complimenting them.  I did add some nutmeg and I used the cream cheese whipped frosting which was great.  I also used Splenda instead of white sugar which turned out great, not too sweet as others had mentioned, but just right!

Yum-oh! This cake was fantastic. Excellent firm cake-like texture; packed with carrots, raisins, and delicious pineapple.   Instead of using 1 cup oil, I substituted with 1/2 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce. I also added 1 tsp nutmeg! I frosted this cake with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" by JJ and I must say, what an excellent pair these two make. Delicious and hearty cake. Not only did this cake taste marvelous, but the presentation is simply beautiful; a double-decker beauty she was...before she got eaten! Will be making this again so soon.

Not very good.  This recipe is proof that a cake can be too moist.  The batter did not rise hardly at all, the cake was incredibly heavy and a little oily on the surface.  The cake toothpick tested clean after 45 minutes and I let it cool completely before frosting it. Upon cutting it, I was disappointed to find that the inside of the cake was not cake-like at all; it was much more like a pudding and was way way too heavy.  It also needs more spice. I will not make this again.  I gave it two stars because it is not quite bad enough to throw away-not quite, but almost.

This cake truly lives up to its name.  Preparing the carrots does take a long time, but it is worth it.  I love how the liquid from the carrots plumps up the raisins and makes them extra sweet.  I added all the liquid from the carrots into the batter, then an extra 1/4 cup flour because we live at a really high altitude.  It came out perfectly.
I made this cake for my daughter's birthday party and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  I omitted the nuts (for all the kids that were there) and used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe found on this site.  Everyone loved it, and the little bit we had left over was delicious for breakfast.  Thanks for a great recipe, this will definately go into the regular rotation!

I made this as a birthday cake for a colleague of mine. The cake was gone in about 5 min. One co-worker, who insists he doesn't like carrot cake, had two pieces.  A moist,sweet cake (even without the rasins and nuts!) Top it with a cream cheese frosting and you can't loose.

this was pretty good.. i agree with other reviewers that this was very dense.. and i even subbed half the oil with applesauce.. i think it could have used some extra spices (nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and/or cloves).. we like spicy though.. i made sure to thoroughly drain the grated carrots and used chunked pineapple that i squeezed the juice out of and chopped up.. i cut the recipe in half and it made 14 good sized muffins.. this was a nice standard carrot cake recipe, but nothing over the top.. so i'd have to disagree with the title.. either way it was still pretty tasty and i'm sure bf will enjoy these.. ty for the recipe

The batter was extremely watery so I added more flour to it as I was not trusting enough I guess.  I did use cake flour instead of regular all purpose flour and I don't know if that would have made a difference or not, but it did turn out very very good with a lot of compliments.

I never made a carrot cake before and after reading all of the ratings wanted to try it.  I made it for my family on Easter and everyone raved about it.  I did what some other people recommended and I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce.   Yummy!  I frosted the cake with "cream cheese frosting II", also on this site. I will be making this again and again.

I tried this recipe for work. I didn't use the rasins. it turned out beautiful. I followed the recipe to the T.  it I grated the carrots using the thin side of the grater. This make the pieces nice and small. However next time I would try it chunkier.  Used the cream cheese icing and it was amazing! heaps of compliments that it was the best carrot cake ever and that it tasted store bought!

I thought this cake was VERY tasty. It was rich and decadent...just like a carrot cake should be. YUMMY! Of course the most time consuming part is grating all those darn carrots. Next time, I might look for some pre-grated ones. I dressed it up with pretty decorations and attached a picture. ;)

Perfect cake, rich and dense and flavorful. After the first few times, I began using a little extra cinnamon,  and bake in two 8'' square pans for 45 minutes. After MANY times baking this cake it is still incredible every time and my most requested dessert.

I made this cake for the second time today.  I love the cake.  I add 1 cup of chopped, flaked coconut.  I bake the cake in a 11 x 15 pan, which is so much easier than dealing with multiple pans.  I am still working on finding an icing that is as good as this cake!

Everyone loved this cake! Some said it wasn't the best one ever. My vote is one of the best. I did not have any problems with a heavy or pudding like texture. I did read a lot of the reviews and I followed some of their advice. I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I kept the soda the same. I squeezed the juice from the pineapple. I put the shredded carrots on a paper towel for a bit before I went on to the sugar adding step. I put in 6tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of each:  cloves, nutmeg. 1/4 tsp of ginger (didn't smooth out the top). I used the cream cheese frosting I recipe to put between the layers and top. I had no problems with the bake time. I was surprised when it was ready when it supposed to be since I used 9 inch pans that were really full.

Very yummy recipe. I added some coconut, and microwaved the raisins in a bowl with rum and brown sugar. My son requested carrot cake for his birthday, and I'm so glad I used this recipe.

Made this recipe over the weekend and loved it.  Cake was moist, delicious and gone in a day. 

I made sure to strain the pineapple very very well.  When I was ready to use the carrots after adding the sugar, I didn't use all of the remaining liquid.  Used my hand to strain the carrots as I added the wet to the dry ingredients.  Worked perfectly.

I didn't care for this. I found it to be too heavy and lacked flavor. If it wasn't for the icing there would be no flavor. I, like many others, read the raving reviews so this was my first choice. It took a lot of ingredients and time. For me, it is way too bland and heavy. I won't use this recipe again.

First, I wasn't baking for a ton of people, so I halved the recipe and had just enough for 2 dozen small cupcakes, which i baked at 350 for about 18 -22 minutes. Now, I hate an oily cake, so i substituted a little more than half the oil for applesauce (a tiny bit less than 1/4 cup oil to a full 1/4 cup applesauce) like some of the other reviewers here and it still came out perfectly moist. I also didn't completely drain my pineapple, but rather added just a couple splashes of the juice the pineapple was packed in. Finally, I topped my little cupcakes off with Cream Cheese Frosting II and garnished with walnuts. The end result was AMAZING! My fiancee and his coworkers loved them! No doubt, those cupcakes deserve 5 stars, however this recipe doesn't with all that oil- it's unnecessary. If I had followed this recipe exactly, I think my cupcakes would have had a very tragic and soggy outcome.

Awesome! Followed the recipe exactly. Did not change a thing. Did not drain the liquid off the carrots as others suggested. Why on earth would you do that?! I made two dozen cupcakes and one square 9 inch cake out of this recipe. Very moist, very delicious cake.

This is the FIRST cake I ever made. I followed the recommendations of the fist two reviews and it turned out AMAZING =) I used 1/2 tsp baking POWDER and used a cheesecloth to strain the carrots BEFORE I put brown sugar in and I strained the pineapple. BEST CAKE EVER REALLY =)

Hi All,
I made this one but I made a few changes to it. I removed the raisins and nuts (my husband does not care for them I however do but it was for his Birthday). I added 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and a 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg and Allspice I will say it was a big hit such a big hit he gave me a taste and took the rest to work LOL.

This is a delicious recipe! It doesn't pop out of the pan like a sponge cake does.  When I took it out of the pan, 3/4 of the bottom, remained in the pan.  I ended up scooping out what was left and putting it on top, then putting it into a glass pan and serving it that way instead of on a cake stand.   Overall, I would make this again! It is delicious.  Sometimes the best desserts are the messy ones!

I usually don't make cakes and sweets because it's really not my specialty, so I read almost every review before making this cake for Easter.  After reading the reviews, the only thing that I did differently was add in a little nutmeg and allspice to the cinnamon mixture and I sifted the dry ingredients to make it fluffy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is.  It turned out so well, and my father, the biggest food critic ever, LOVED it.  Thanks for the great recipe, and I will be making this cake again

Honestly, this truly is the best carrot cake I have ever made. I had a can of pre made icing on hand, so added cream cheese to it and Voila! perfection! Everyone loved it and it was easy to make.

After reading reviews I was torn on whether or not to drain the carrots as many reviewers recommended. I finely grated the carrots with my food processor's grating attachment. After sitting, they render a lot of liquid. I ended up squeezing them out by the handful (no cheesecloth) and added back 8-9 Tbsp of the carrot liquid to the cake batter. 
I increased the cinnamon to 5 tsp and also added 1/4 tsp each of allspice and nutmeg. Next time I wod do 1/2 tsp each. 
I left out raisins and walnuts (preference).
I did 12 cupcakes baked for 23 min and a 7 1/2"x11" glass pan for 34 min. 
For frosting: 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) undated butter, 2 cups conf. Sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. PERFECT!!
Everyone said it was moist and fantastic! Will make again.

It was average, to me.  Not bad, but nothing special either.  It seems like it was missing something to perk up the flavor.  Perhaps citrus zest?  I don't know.  But, what I do know is that my mother's carrot cake, which she makes from a box and then doctors, is a lot better so I was really disappointed with my results from this scratch recipe.  I made mine by dividing the batter into 3 9-inch pans.  After reading the reviews about it being too wet, I took some of the advice and made sure I drained my carrots well using a ricer (this technique works great for draining things like spinach and grated carrots).  And, I plumped my raisins in the pineapple syrup - although I don't think that really added much, if anything at all, to the flavor.    Next time I get the hankering for carrot cake I'm going to try Sam's Famous Carrot Cake from this site.

Excellent! I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, so I ended up making just 1/4 of the recipe. I had no problems whatsoever doing so. I followed the recipe except for using golden raisins instead of regular raisins and using pecans instead of walnuts. I made cupcakes and used a vanilla cinnamon buttercream frosting that I came up with at the moment. I wish I had written it down because it was fantastic. I know I used 1 stick of unsalted butter, about 1 1/2 c confectioner's sugar, about 1 teaspoon vanilla and quite a bit of cinnamon until it tasted the way I wanted it. They were just perfect!

I made it 3 layers and added a tad more flour to make it more solid because I didn't drain the liquid from the carrots after they sat...cooked it the same time and it was moist and delicious !!! Definitely making this again. I topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was a great combo but next time I will make 1 1/2 the batch of frosting because I had the 3 layers.

After reading reviews I decided to make certain the carrot mixture & pineapple were very well drained.  I served the cake about 4 hours after making  and thought it was good, but a little dry, so decided next time I wouldn't drain the carrot mixture.  I used a cream cheese frosting, refrigerated and the following day - viola, it was nice and moist and flavorful, as most cakes with spices seem to be after a day.  Decided next time I'll make it a day before serving.  I had to give half the cake to neighbors or I would have eaten it all!

This cake measures up to it's name. I made this cake for my mothers birthday and it was a hit. I followed the recipe and it came out great. Instead of making it layered I did a sheet cake so to feed more and truly this cake is so rich that with the frosting small portions is all you need. This cake has made me famous in my family and this is what I will probably be known for.

I baked this cake for Christmas and it was a success! Even my grandfather who was a cook said that it was VERY good. 
I followed the original recipe and a few comments as well: 500g of well carrots, 11g of baking soda + 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar, half a banana instead of the pineapple (I've never tried pineapple in carrot cakes, maybe I'm wrong) an finally only a pinch of salt.
I baked it in a single large tin for nearly 1h30; filed it and covered it with cream cheese frosting, a few sugar mushrooms and a lovely deer.
AMAZING!

The best carrot cake I've eaten - Simply superb. 

I used pecans in place of walnuts and also substituted 1/2 fresh pineapple from the food processor in place of the canned crushed.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. I used 8 in. pans instead of 10 and ended up with 4 layers. You could cut the recipe in half that way if you want a smaller cake. My step dad whom i made it for said it was the best carrot cake he has ever tasted. I made the simple cream cheese icing that a previous reviewer included and it just turned out so good! Thank you for sharing

This is hands down the best carrot cake recipe OF ALL TIME!  You can halve the sugar without much damage and it must be added to the carrots in order to render the liquid, but that's it.  

Be sure to print out little recipe cards if you bring it to a party, as people will undoubtedly ask you for them.  (You could be sly and hand write them to make it look like your own recipe.)

This recipe is a real name-maker, an instant heirloom!  I'm making it for the 3rd time this year and everybody LOVES it.  
Thank you AllRecipe!

I have to give five stars because it was my fault of why it didn't turn out perfect.  Mine was waaaay over cooked.  It seemed as though it was unclear on how long to cook it with the different pans.  I read some other reviews but the 9x13 glass pan at 375 for 50 minutes was too long.  I will attempt again to get it just right.  Everyone still loved it anyway.

This was so good, I made two of them in 3 days! My grandson inhaled the first one. The only problem is that the layers, while dense & wonderful, do not rise very high. I solved this by making 1 1/2 recipes and a 3 layer caker. Yum!

The title is right!  Without any alterations, this is a great recipe.  I made this a while back and was just now searching for it to make it again.  I'm going to serve it for a birthday cake for my brother.  I think I'll try the half applesauce half oil this time.  Now I just have to figure out which ice cream to serve with it.

Excellent cake. I love carrot cake and found if I use the bags of "matchstick cut" carrots rather than grating my own, I avoid the problem of having to drain out the carrots. I do chop them up a little because some of the cuts are rather long. I baked mine in 3 smaller pans since I don't own 10" cake pans and adjusted the time and it turned out great.

This turned out to be a delicious birthday cake for my mother's 53rd birthday!  The only thing I did differently was sub 1/2 oil with sugarfree applesauce.  The recipe didn't mention anything about draining the carrot/br sugar mix after an hour, but I did it anyway because there was almost 2 cups of carrot juice in the bottom!  So I got rid of it and it turned out beautifully.  Iced with basic homemade buttercream icing (pink, leftover from Valentine's Day cupcakes!)

I made this luscious cake a few days ago and it is GONE... Instead of layer cake pans I made it in my jelly roll pan and was able to share with my neighbors, and grandchildren. It made a nice big sheet cake. I would change nothing in this recipe. I am gong to make this for an upcoming dinner at the club we belong to as they always need baked goods...Thank you Nan......"cookin'mama"

Great cake!  It was the first time I made carrot cake and it was a huge success.  This recipe makes three cake tins, perfect for a really nice looking cake.  I made the following changes, as per other reviewers suggestions: squeeze out the liquid of the soaked carrots before adding them to the batter; added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to the mix; added 1/4 tsp. cardamom to the mix, and next time I will add more; used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  The cake baked in less time in my oven, but rose beautifully and was moist and a great hit at my dad's 75th birthday party!  YUM!  Oh - next time I might try using currants instead of raisins - currents are more expensive but I think I might like their smaller size in this cake - but now we are really gilding the lily.

This is the same recipe I have been using for awhile(slight variations) and I have to say it's stupendous! I add 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and minus the veg oil to 1/2 cup.  I also add 2/3 cup coconut and 1/4 tsp ground cardamon. It's a nice chunky style carrot cake. Moist.  This is NOT a light airy cake.  This is a typical decadent carrot cake.

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had...I used the extra spices recommended in other reviews...I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil...added the 1/2 tsp. of baking powder...and I soaked the raisins in coconut water with a tsp. of vanilla...lastly, instead of a heavy frosting...I combined whipped cream with 12 oz. of cream cheese and slightly sweetened it.

Great cake, I used mascabado sugar for the carrots and an extra 1/4 cup of oil or apple sauce and it turned out great, moisture and delicious.

This recipe, as previously stated here, WILL make a tremendous amount of batter, and is a little more than required for a little cake for a family of five.  The next time I make it (and I will make it again, since my husband loved it), I will soak the raisins for a period of time in rum or some other kind of alcohol, for although it was moist, I found it a tad bland for my taste.  I did substitute 2 cups of carrots for 2 cups of zucchini.  Other than that, I left the recipe unchanged.

This recipe is foolproof!  I proved it.  First, I used the pulp left over from juicing carrots (I had to put in all the pineapple juice to re-moisten it), then I tried to use brown sugar that had gotten hard and had to leave the pulp overnight to melt the lumps.  The batter was really thick and heavy (probably because juicer pulp is a lot denser than grated carrot) so I used a 9x13 pan, I really doubted this would bake through.  Then... well, when the cake had been in the oven for fifteen minutes I just happened to walk by the counter where the recipe was and idly, just sort of obsessive/compulsive, I looked over the recipe ingredients and realized !! I had left out the sugar.  After I got over the shock I checked the cake - it was already partly cooked.  But, I thought, what the heck!  It probably wasn't going to turn out anyway -- I pulled it out of the oven, dumped the hot batter into a bowl, mixed in the sugar, threw in a serious three teaspoons of baking powder and popped it back into the oven.  It was great!  No leftovers.  Loved it.  Thanks Nan.

I have been frustrated with carrot cakes in the past, they never quite taste as good as i remember carrot cake tasting in my head....this recipe far exceeded my carrot cake desires.  I scaled the recipe down to 12 servings and baked in a 9X13 pan with no nuts (never did like them). The result was moist and delicious with delectable chunks of pineapple, plump raisins and a sweet cinnamon aroma. Now the only problem i face is how to keep from eating the whole thing myself

My husband normally lets me have the run of the kitchen, but when my birthday rolled around, knowing I LOVE carrot cake, he decided to surprise me with this one. For that reason alone, I would say it ranks "best ever" status. Plus, even for a relative novice baker, the cake turned out just perfectly. He even implemented a few of his own "creative touches" (chocolate chips and craisins). And while I'm not entirely sure I'll keep the changes, I'll definitely be keeping him!  (and this recipe!) Thanks, and love you Babe!

Great recipe! It has the perfect amount of sweetness, not too fattening; it was moist and tastey. I added an extra tbsp of cinnamon, a half tsp of nutmeg, ginger and cloves and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. I'm sure it would have been great without it but the extra spices gave it something. I added walnuts instead because I had them. I put it in a bunt pan cause it is nicer, and added powdered sugar insted of frosting the first tiem, because my family does not like creamed cheese frosting that much, and they could do without the extra calories. I also made it again with the frosting for a party to make it more glamorous, but nobody really liked it much with that frosting. But I think the frosting would be good perhaps if you were making it for children because they like the extra sweetness.

Excellent Carrot Cake.  I used a 9 X 13 pan and it worked well.  I also would add a little more spice next time.

I followed this exactly with one exception, I soaked my raisins in rum overnight as one reviewer suggested. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site. The cake was very flavorful and we loved the texture with the pineapple and walnuts. The cake was very dense and heavy. Would have given it 5 stars if it were a bit lighter. I would, also, recommend using 9-inch cake pans, it would add a nice height!

I made this last night for a co-worker's birthday, as she requested carrot cake specifically.  The only changes I made was to soak the raisins in (pineapple flavored) rum.  Woohoo was this cake good.  I didn't use walnuts - none on hand.  But still the moistness level, flavor and texture of this cake were right on!   Definetly adding this to my recipe box.

This is an awesome cake. I wanted to add that if you want to make the icing carrots use a #12 tip and start at the top applying a lot of pressure. Hold bag at a 90 degree angle to the cake. Bring the bag downward easing pressure as you get to the tip of the carrot. Lift slightly to end. Then take a #233 tip to make small green sprouts at the top of each carrot.

I wanted a carrot cake recipe with a LOT of carrots in it. The first time I used the exact ingredients. The result was an extremely moist cake, almost pudding-like in consistency. The second time I shredded the carrots instead of grating. That created, in my opinion, a perfect carrot cake.  1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and cloves were added just for a little extra zing. By the way, I used a bundt pan and baked it for 65 minutes. (There is no way that this amount of batter will fit into 2 10-inch pans) After tasting this carrot cake everyone asks for the recipe!

For people who juice I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used 2 cups of pulp (carot, apple, spinach) and cut the sugar in 1/2.  Pecans instead of walnuts, soaked dates instead of pineapple.  So it holds up fantastic to adjustments.  Cooked 40 minutes even though 1/2 the recipe.  Perfect texture.

This was wonderful the first time I made it!  It was light, moist, and delicious!  I finely shredded my carrots, then let them sit in the brown sugar.  I squeezed out all of the excess juice before adding it to the mixture.  I also squeezed all of the juice out of the pineapple before adding it.  I also increased the baking soda to 2 teaspoons, instead of 1 1/2.  I decreased the cinnamon from 4 teaspoons to 2 teaspoons.  The total bake time was exactly 40 minutes in my gas oven.  I checked it at 35 minutes, because it was a very golden brown, but it wasn't quite done, but at 40 minutes it was perfect.  I used a cream cheese frosting, 1 8 oz. package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of margarine, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 4 cups of powdered sugar, to frost the cake.  I doubled this recipe and had more than enough.  I would suggest this cake to anyone!  It was wonderful!!

Gave this recipe to a girlfriend to try and she didn't take the time to "marinate" the carrots and the sugar and it turned out awful... so ALWAYS take the time!!!  :)  This is a wonderful cake recipe.  MUCH better than any box.  Well worth the time it takes.

Soaked the raisins in warm water, but otherwise made as directed and it was perfect!  I saw there were several reviews about how the cake was too dense... My preference is that a carrot cake should be heavy as opposed to light and airy.  The cake was definitely dense but I wouldn't say it was oily.  I think it was perfect as is.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I found this recipe quite a while ago and have made it many times. It always gets rave reviews and I also love it. I have tried many carrot cakes(it is my favorite) and this one lives up to it's name. I also soak the raisins along with the carrots and sugar, but next time I am going to try the rum based on the other suggestions. I have never drained off any of the liquid and have never had a problem with the cake being soggy or too moist. I usually add just a bit of rum to my cream cheese frosting and that tastes great and is very popular with anyone who tries the cake as well.

I found this recipe in this site many years ago. The first time I made found it too big but the best carrot cake I've ever tasted (and I've tasted my share, trust me). So I got on the mission to downsize it. I halved it and still got great results- moist, flavorful and worth every calorie. I've moved 3 times since I found this recipe and about 2 months ago I wanted to make it and I couldn't find my copy!!!! It took me a good 3 hours to find it again and so I don't lose I saved it in my email and sent it to a friend too!! If you think its too much work, just halve the recipe, buy the carrots grated and bake away! You will be rewarded with a delicious treat, and anyone that you present with it will love it - and you for sharing it!! I don't like raisins, so I use Craisins instead and nobody has picked them out yet! GREAT, FABULOUS CAKE**

I received ENDLESS compliments on this recipe! I am a carrot cake enthusiast, and I have tried PLENTY of different carrot cakes.

This recipe beats all. I made them into mini muffins/cupcakes, and my brother had about 20. Enough said :)

This is just what I was looking for! The cake has perfect taste, like it was made at some fancy cafe. I made the recipe with only 4 cups of carrots, and I only put about half of the juice from the carrot/sugar mixture in the batter. If you love good carrot cake, this is for you...and it's very easy to make! Thanks!

great cake but if you are from high altitudes and the batter is extremely droopy.  Add about 3 cups of flour so it can rise...

This IS the best carrot cake ever! The one and only recipe I use. I get rave reviews everytime I make it, and if I'm not making it- I am always getting requests. Very thick, dense and heavy. Full of flavor. I soak the raisins for 1 hour, drain the pineapple for 1 hour, add 4 tsp of vanilla and have used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesause. I make mine in 3 10" pans and make it a three layer cake. This cuts down on cook time, plus makes a great appearance. I use the cream cheese frosting ll for this recipe. Exceptional!!

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I make it using all whole wheat and dark brown sugar.  I don't add pineapple, raisins, or walnuts (personal preference).  Cooking time depends on what I'm cooking.  I make a high birthday cake for my kids with 3 8 inch rounds which take about 40 minutes.  I use the whipped cream cheese frosing (also on this site) which, good as this cake is, almost makes the cake a vehicle to eat the frosting!

This was amazing. I always thought carrot cakes were hard to bake even though i never baked any before and prayed and hoped the ones i made would taste good.

Well mine turned out perfect (i hardly ever say that about anything i make). i decided to make cup cakes instead of cake so that i could give them away. the texture is just right. the moistness is just right too!

grating the carrots took me half an hour. i was so tired i used 1 cup less of carrots recommended. Ommitted the raisins so in place of the raisins i used more crushed pineapples. for example recipe recommended 1 cup raisin i added half a cup of pineapple instead.

there have been mixed comments about whether draining / not draining the juices.

what i did was mix the carrots with the brown sugar, when i was about to add the carrots to my mixture i added half the water left in the bowl and threw the other half away. as for the crushed pineapple, i did strain it. i could have used a wooden spoon and squeezed even more juice out but i didn't. that for me was the moderate steps i took that i felt worked well to my advantage.

definitely try this out in cup cakes and bake about 20 minutes. i used cream cheese frosting 2.

Yup, recipe title says it all! This makes an amazingly moist and delectable cake. The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of nutmeg, I just love the combo of cinnamon and nutmeg together. This recipe is a definite keeper. My family says thanks.

I made this for my husband's birthday last year after looking over dozens of carrot cake recipes.  I plumped up the raisins in warm orange juice, drained the carrot mixture and added a teaspoon of cloves (I love the smell).  It made a huge three layer cake.  It was absolutely delicious but so much work that I vowed to only make it once a year.

I followed directions fairly well with the exception of draining off every last little bit of liquid. I thought the batter looked kind of thin when i put it in the oven, but thought it would be okay - It would be nice if the recipe indicated how thick the batter should be so readers could compensate with extra flour if needed.   Unfortunately, the cake didnt rise and formed a dense carrot brick.

I read a lot of the reviews and so I drained the carrot mixture and the pineapple very well, and used golden raisins.  Since I used King Arthur organic white whole wheat flour, I think I should have kept a bit of that extra moisture, but the end result was very good.  The cake definitely improved after a couple of days in the fridge, so I will keep it in mind as a make ahead dessert for entertaining. I frosted with cream cheese frosting II from this sight, the perfect compliment.

I've made this carrot cake many times, and people agree that it is truly the best carrot cake ever. This time, I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so I tried some substitutions, and decided to share since the alternate ingredients turned out just as well. Instead of using pineapple, I used 1/2 cup of fresh mandarin oranges (take off all of the fibrous white skin as well) and 1/2 cup of fresh raspberries. Instead of all-purpose flour, I used whole wheat white flour. The cake didn't change dramatically, but the orange-raspberry flavor came through for me, and I preferred that to the pineapple. Also, the whole wheat bread flour gave it even more of a hearty texture, yet the cake remained moist, and I loved that. Thanks for a wonderful carrot cake recipe!

This really is the best carrot cake ever!  I've made it twice now and everybody has raved about it.  I like that there are alot of carrots, raisins, and nuts in it.  I made it in a 9x13 glass dish though because I didn't have 2- 10" rounds like the recipe suggested so mine was more of a sheet cake which worked out just fine.  My oven is circa 1929 (no joke!) so my cooking times were extended (and because it was a larger cake).  I bought a bundt cake thermometer from this cooking store that you just stick into the center of the cake for 15 seconds and it the tip comes out red, the cake is done.  I highly recommend getting one if you don't have one already and you are inexperienced and nervous like I was . It works great for any cake and because this recipe has strained crushed pineapple in it, the toothpick test was hard for me to judge. Draining the crushed pineapple was a little bit of a chore too but I took the advice of other reviewers and drained it well. This was the first cake I've ever made that didn't come out of a box!  It required a little bit of time and work but the end result was well worth it!

Excellent!!  Even my hubby who doesn't like carrot cake said this one deserves 5 stars.  I paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II and they complemented each other perfectly!  I now make this every Easter.  My kids love to help grating the carrots. :)

This recipe turned out just as expected. It was very moist, full of flavor and better than the version I usually prefer from a local chain family restaurant. I followed the recipe and a few suggestions from the reviews (re-hydrating the raisins in warm water before adding to carrot mixture). Also, I made sure the pineapple was drained completely. Hint: drain pineapple thoroughly while the carrot mixture sits for an hour. It will be completely dry when it is time to add it to the rest of the ingredients. The only trouble I encountered was finding a good cream cheese frosting, I used the one submitted by Jani but altered it (it needed more sugar and then I added sour cream) to suit my needs. The family loved this cake! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME !!!! Made this for our family birthday celebrations.I  did the carrots in the processor, then I let them sit in the brown sugar for about 3 hours (was doing other stuff).  Did a 9x13 cake and iced with the cream cheese frosting.  Definitely a repeater!!

Perhaps didn't cook for long enough but it came out doughy. I would have prefered a moist cakiness rather than  a moist denseness.

I tried two others before this recipe and failed miserably... This is hands down the best carrot cake ever!  When reading the instructions I was unsure if I should strain the carrots after letting them sit in the brown sugar, there was a lot of liquid in the bowl when it came time to add them to the batter.  I strained them and reserved about 1/4 cup of the liquid and added that to the cake batter.  I followed all other directions to the letter, baked in 3 9"round cake pans and my cake came out moist and delicious.  I took it to church to get some other people's opinion and everyone loved it!  Many remarked that it had the perfect ratio of walnuts to raisins, I agree.  I am making this for a family celebration next week and can't wait to share it (and eat more of it)!

um um good...  wife love it & me too plus the kids.  I have added nutmeg, 2tsp baking soda plus 2tsp. baking powder. Changed 1 cup brown sugar to 3/4 cup & 1 cup of white suger,  reason fund to much sugar in total (for me). I also mix walnuts with cashew 1/2 & 1/2. I also added like the other reviewer 3 tbsp. of the juice from the tropical fruits.(reviewer: Crystallaurey.)  I was out of pinneapple so I  substitute tropical fruits.  
 The only thing I miss was the cream cheese recipe... 
Tahnk you Crystal for pass it on....

AWESOME!  I used three 8-inch round pans.  I could have poured out some of the batter and still had a giant cake.  I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe as recommended, plus I added a can of Duncan Hines vanilla frosting.   Everybody who tried it said it was wonderful.  I will save this recipe to use every time I make carrot cake.

This cake is awesome!  It was filled and frosted w/ cream cheese frosting.  I used chunky applesauce instead of the oil, and didn't use the raisins.  I also chopped the carrots very fine w/ a food processor and "marinated" them in brown sugar for about 2 days.  The cake was VERY moist and was great even a week later!!

I tried making this recipe 3 times, and it did not work out.  The batter did not rise even though I tried increasing the temperature or even discarding some liquid from the mixture.  The other recipes call for 4 eggs per 3 cups carrot.  I may try one of those.

I love carrot cake and have made several different recipes over the years.  What I found is that this is the best Carrot Cake Ever!  I recieved rave reviews on it!  I made exactly as stated!  Easy to make and a very big hit.  I followed someone's advice about the frosting.  I also used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting found on this site and it was devine!  Great recipe Nan.

I made this last night for a work function today and it came out beautifully.  I also bought the pre-shredded carrots (2 bags) and just ran those through the food processor to grate them up a little finer.  This is much easier than peeling and shredding the carrots yourself and less of a mess since carrot juice stains almost everything it touches.  I made cream cheese frosting with chopped pecans - I also used pecans instead of walnuts in the cake - and I toasted the pecans before to enhance their flavor.  I left out the raisins because I know a few of my co-workers aren't fans.  The cake itself was very moist and dense and the layers came out perfectly.  My only complaint is that I feel like the cake was missing a little something... Maybe it needs a little more cinnamon or some nutmeg?  It could also be a tad sweeter in my opinion.  Even so, this recipe is definitely going in my box.  I'll just play aroungd with a it a little more the next time I make it.

I am a steward ( cook ) offshore in the gulf of mexico, I cook for the men drilling for oil and gas. This cake is the best cake i have ever made, and so simple. These guys love it and i have to make it every monday. thank you !!! also do not squeeze the juice from the pineapple and add 2 Tbs more of the juice, It will add moisture to the cake and more flavor.

This cake lives up to its name.  The only problem I have with it is that I eat too much, so I like to make it in cupcake form (it makes about 30).  Also, if you want to make it lighter, use a 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, and use 2 eggs and 4 egg whites instead of the eggs.  I have also substituted coconut for the walnuts, which worked out really well.

After reading many of the reviews, I made some minor changes to this recipe and it was AWESOME! People said it actually was the best carrot cake ever. I used about 5 1/2 cups of carrots and did not drain them before adding them to the batter. I also increased the cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger. The cake baked well in two 9-inch pans (for the same amount of time) with batter left over for half a dozen muffins. This is a big cake; to have PLENTY of frosting, combine 14 oz softened cream cheese and 1 1/2 sticks softened butter, then beat in 5 C confectioner's sugar and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Delicious!

This cake lives up to its name! Carrot cake is really the only kind of cake I like so I decided to make it for my son's 2nd birthday (that way the kids are getting veggies too and I can eat the leftovers!). Since it was my first time making it I changed very little. I did leave out the raisins as not everyone likes them.I made a train cake so I used mini-loaf pans. The recipe makes 6 mini-loaf pans. I cooked 4 pans and then 2 and both times it took about 45 minutes. The cake was super-moist and really wonderful. Making it in mini-loaf pans also makes a great gift for the holidays. I may substitute applesauce for the oil next time and see how it turns out. If you do not have a food processor you may want to reconsider this reciple because it will take a really long time to grate 6 cups of carrots by hand. In case you are wondering how many carrots to buy- I used an entire 2 pound bag of carrots and it made just under 6 cups (about 5 3/4).

Great & I made it all in the Food Processor!
Grating the carrots and crushing the fresh pineapple! Here's how..   Add dry ingredients and spin, remove to a separate bowl. (this lightens the flour) then mix eggs briefly till light, add sugar briefly spinning, then  oil & vanilla  Spin 40 sec. Stir in Pineapple do not over process. I used fresh pinapple I crushed in Processor and drained.  Place the flour mixture  over the wet ingrediants in processor  pulsing briefly.Remove to large bowl and finish mixing by hand  JUST till incorporated. Do not overmix at this point.  Stir in the carrot mixture and nuts, by HAND  I Cut the oil to 3/4 cup..white sugar to 3/4 cup, brown to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut & 3 dashes Alspice. Baked 13x9 for 40 min and did 12 mini muffins  baked for 20 min. Really wonderful.  For those who had trouble with the recipe..you may not be measuring your flour correctly..using too much or too little radically upsets things. If you use a scale, 11ozs.  total flour worked best for me.

This is amazing.  Substitute apple sauce equally for oil and 2 egg whites per whole egg to decrease fat content with all the same taste and moistness!!

Very, very good. Everyone who tried it fell in love with it. My friend took one bite and decided to use this recipe for the cake she was going to bake for her parents' wedding anniversary. It makes a big cake, but not big enough for my family apparently; it was gone in a day. I used a 9 x 13 inch pan, and it took about 15-20 more minutes to bake. The only problem was that it was a bit too wet, though it tastes less pudding-like after you leave it overnight. I'm going to leave out some oil the next time, and add more walnuts, and put less white sugar.

The cake was good, but it is very tedious to grate 6 cups of carrots.  A bit too sweet, dense and chewy.  Perhaps the brown sugar should be eliminated.  Three out of the eight people I served this to did not care for it.

I have made this cake 3 times and our friends love this. I used a 10 inch springform pan this time and I will slice the cake very thin as it is very rich. I also make the lemon, cream cheese frosting for it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to bake, but it it time consuming to put together.

I think this cake was great.  It was moist and the pineapple, raisens and nuts gave it a great texture in your mouth.  My co-workers said that they didn't know a carrot cake could be that good.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of allspice.  This recipe also makes great mini-muffins.

Terrific cake!  I omitted the pineapple, raisins, and nuts at my husband's request and the cake STILL came out very moist and flavorful.  It had a good "carroty" taste and was not too sweet.  I divided the batter into 4- 8"round pans and baked for 40 minutes.  After they cooled, I iced two of the layers then wrapped the other two and put in the freezer to enjoy later.  Just the right size for our carrot cake lovin' family of three!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful recipe.... grating the carrots by hand is a pain, but worth it.  I cut the two layers in half, and layered them with jarred orange curd. Frosted the whole thing in cream cheese frosting, and covered the sides in chopped walnuts and toasted coconut. DIVINE!

I made this for a birthday cake for a co-worker and EVERYONE loved it.  It was so moist and flavorful.  The only problem is shredding 6 cups of carrots...but if you have time time.  It is really worth it!  Serve with cream cheese icing!!

This is the absolutely best carrot cake ever!!  My sister is a student teacher, and I made this cake in cupcake form for her 3rd grade students and they loved it.  And now all of the teachers at the school want the recipe.  If you like carrot cake, you have GOT to try this!

Outstanding! 
I did drain a little juice off of the carrots, after they sat for the required time.Perfect recipe!

For the frosting I used to bars of cream cheese, and one stick of butter, add confection sugar to taste./texture It was more than enough for a two layer cake.

This is the second time I made this cake. This time I baked it in 2, 10 inch cake pans. As it was baking, I started to read the negative reviews. I must say, I was a little afraid. I did not drain the carrots and with all the problems everyone had, I really wasn't sure how this was going to turn out. I removed it from the oven and it was perfect. It baked in the least amount of time, color is beautiful, cake is moist. Did not fall in the center, was not gloppy. I had a lot of liquid from the carrots and I added all of it. The first time I baked it, a couple years ago, I baked it in a 13x9 pan and I think it was fine or I would not have baked it again. I would have deleted this recipe from my favorites. I would bake it again. I drained the pineapple as stated and put the raisins in with the carrots and liquid. No problem with this recipe at all.

I "found" this recipe and since it had the most carrots of all the ones I looked at I figured this is the one to make. I had offered to make a carrot cake for a friend so I was taking a chance that this truly is the Best Carrot Cake Ever. It has yet to disappoint. I even made this for a friend that has an allergy to pineapple and I used 1 Cup grated Granny Smith Apples and this cake is still a winner. I love the pineapple and the nuts I think this is the same cake that I used to get at a long closed sandwich shop, people would line up for the cake.  I have played with reducing the oil and increasing the carrots or the pineapple and it still turns out great. 
This is a very dense moist cake so if you are looking for a lighter cake this is not the one you want.  but if you want a dense, flavorful no doubt about it being a carrot cake this is the perfect recipe.

This cake was awesome to say the least. I didn't use raisins because my family doesn't care for them, but it was just as fantastic! I didn't have 10" cake pans so I substituted a bundt pan instead which required a longer cooking time; about an hour. I started checking the cake at about 55 minutes. Then after the cake cooled, I cut it in half horizontally to give myself two layers and frosted it as if it came from two cake pans. This cake will now be a permanent fixture in my recipe box.
Don't second guess this recipe.....make it. Be prepared for endless raves.

Personally, i'm not 100% in love with this cake. I decided to make it because we had 2 full bags of carrots in the fridge and didn't want to waste. My husband loved it saying,.. "this is the kind of cake you would buy at Starbucks",and his sister agreed. I cut the ingredients in half because I wanted to be sure that it tasted good. I still got a lot from that batter and would only recommend making the full recipe amount if you are planning on feeding a lot of people. Otherwise, everything was followed to a T.

Simply delicious! I tried the same week another carrot cake recipe and there is simply no comparison with this one. This one is moist but not greasy, with great flavour where you can really taste everything.

I followed the recipe as it was except for the brown sugar... didn't have it and used normal sugar.

Made this cake for a friend's birthday today.  I rescaled it to 12 servings and that worked nicely in a bundt pan (75 minutes in my oven.)  I used my food processor to grate the carrots and while they weren't grated as finely as the video suggests, they worked very well.  Didn't drain the carrot/sugar mixture, but did drain the pineapple.  I made a cream cheese glaze and used some of the remaining pineapple juice instead of milk - good choice!  Next time I'll add some orange zest and might try a little whole wheat flour, but this cake got rave reviews today!

Tried the recipe for the first time but used applesauce 2 small 4oz cups instead of veg oil also didn't have raisins and add a few prunes to substitute ... This carrot cake still came out  delicious ! Followed the rest of the recipe  as follows ...  The cream cheese icing was delicious !
This carrot cake was very heavy , dense and moist. The cake was really sweet maybe due to the prunes. Anyway froze half in the freezer and ate the other half with family and  friends. 
Everyone enjoyed it but next time I will have raisans.. The photos are nice.

I received great reviews from my husband and co-workers.  Everyone loved it, including me! I did leave out the raisins and I added pecans instead of walnuts. The cake was very moist and not too sweet.  This recipe is a keeper:)

I adore this cake. I've made this cake several times the folks in my church love it. I get orders for it all the time. I added a small variation to it. I use part shredded carrots and part baby food carrots.

Delicious!  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars just because I made a few adjustments and it was actually too moist for me, almost soggy.  I reduced sugar by 1/2-1 cup, added some nutmeg and cloves, and substituted applesauce for the oil.  Wonderful recipe that I would definitely recommend- next time I will add a little more flour to make the batter slightly less wet.

Love this recipe!! Turned it in to cupcakes by reducing the baking time to 18 mins, makes like 33-35 cupcakes. Left out the nuts since they were going to a school building (allergy awareness), and honestly none of the teachers missed them. Many weren't raisin fans either so I cut that amount in half. Even with these changes they were an instant hit that I have been requested to make many times over.

Excellent carrot cake!  I made this cake somewhat differently though.  I substituted the pineapple for some chopped dates as that is what I had on hand, and it was to die for finished off with cream cheese frosting.  Yummo!!!!

Hands down THE BEST carrot cake recipe ever. Others may claim to be the best, but those bakers and their friends and family have clearly never had this version. :-) I've had people contact me years after having eaten this asking for the recipe because they couldn't find any to match. Well done, Nan. I always follow the recipe as written.

This is easily the best carrot cake I have ever made.  Moist is the best descriptor and adequately huge and impressive dressed up with cream cheese frosting and walnuts for a large crowd.  Make 3 rounds to get this effect.  Have drained the carrots and pineapple but not dry and have been very happy with the outcome.  Highly recommend this even with the extra effort and time required, the input definitely makes the end product so very worth it.

The first time I tried this recipe was because my daughter had a about 10 pounds of carrots given to her and 15 pounds of bananas and didn't know what to do with it, so I looked at it and thought, carrot cake and banana bread!  So I downloaded this recipe and of course being me changed up a few ingredients, like I used white raisens & craisins, I used walnuts and cashews, Vietnamese cinnamon, I added pure vanilla bean and it turned out great!  All my friends love it.  I actually made it later - the original recipe that is, it was very good and moist too, but I love my additions.  I encourage you to play with the recipe - that's the fun in cooking!

This was so good!  I didn't have any pineapples or raisins, so i experimented and used apples.  Your probably thinking "Carrots and apples?!?!"  Well everyone in the house loved it!  I made it in a bundit cake pan, and coated it with homemade buttercream frosting.  To add a little decoration, I dyed the little bit of coconut i had left to a bright orange color, and sprinkled it over the top.  Came out wonderful thanks a lot :)

I cut the servings down to 4 so I can use only one egg.
I made 7 mid size muffins.
They were moist and yummy. Did not taste like baking soda like some other muffins "I" baked did!!!!
I used a little less carrots and banana instead of pineapples.

This is my first carrot cake and I will definitely be using this recipe for years to come; this is one of the moistest carrot cakes ever! I tweaked this recipe only because I didn’t want raisins or nuts so, I put ½ cup of crushed pineapple(drained) and I used 4 cups of carrots (instead of 6 cups) with 2 cups of shredded coconut. Note: This recipe makes a lot of cake. I will be making this again for Xmas...I love this cake. Thanks Nan!

Grated the carrots and added the brown sugar and raisins the night before and refrigerated it.  Used only 1/2 cup of oil.  The moisture drawn from the carrots by the sugar, along with the traces of juice from the pineapple (and the eggs) provided enough wet mixture to moisten the batter sufficiently. I decided to make 2 loaves rather than 2 10 inch cakes so that I could freeze one.  Because of reports of the cake seeming to be too "wet" and based on a banana bread recipe that I love, I baked both loaves for 55 minutes (baked both at the same time).  I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  The cake turned out moist and the family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made it first for a competition at work.  Didn't win anything, but what do they know?  It was delicious as evidenced by how many times I've been asked to make it and how many people want the recipe.  If you love carrot cake, you will love this recipe.
I added 1/3 cup of coconut and listened to the other reviews about moisture.
The first time I made it I left out all the moisture from the carrot-brown sugar soaking.  Since then I've used 1/4 cup of that liquid and not been fussy about draining the carrots.  The added liquid keeps the cake moist for day 2.  
I changed the spice a bit, too.  I used 3 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg.  (I tried 1 tsp allspice once and did not like the results.)

This is the first cake I've made from scratch since the early 1980's when I failed badly.  I love, love, carrot cake.  This IS the BEST Carrot Cake I've ever tasted and It came out of my own kitchen.  The only thing I changed was using Golden Raisens.  Thank you so very much for this recipe.  I will make this time and time again.  The flavors are amazing and the consistency is perfect.

Great cake! But i would suggest baking it longer because it turned out lumpy. Also you should add less sugar and raisins are not a must.

Wow! Incredible cake. Made it for my husband's birthday and EVERYONE loved it. I've had many requests to make it again. Family states it's better than our local shop's carrot cake (which is quite expensive). Thanks for the recipe

After losing my Grandmother's amazing recipe to Alzheimer's, I have to say that THIS is a very close match. My recipe yielded 12 jumbo cupcakes and an 8" round cake of amazing texture and flavor of the carrot cake. Thank you!

I made this carrot cake this past Easter with a cream cheese frosting.  It got nothing but rave reviews from my family and co-workers.  I was worried it was a bit too dense, even for carrot cake, but everyone who tried it waved away my criticism.  Excellent!

I followed the directions exactly as given. Used three 9" round pans.The layers came out so high that I almost didn't use all three. It was very impressive served for Easter dinner. I used cream cheese frosting ii from this site but added one extra cup of powered sugar. Absolutly moist and delicious.

I did this as it is, but put it as cupcake, and bake for less time. It tasted good, but for me still a bit too heavy, not moist enough. Maybe next time I'll use more eggs. Overall, very good carrot cake!

WONDERFUL cake!!!!!!! I received a TON of compliments on this cake; will definitely make again. My husband was skeptical when he saw that there was pineapple in the recipe, but you can't taste it, it just adds to the moisture of the cake. Cake makers beware, you will have extra batter. I made a loaf as well as there was too much batter to make muffins!

Very good; a little too dense.  Made for hubs' birthday, and he loved it.  Grating carrots is a huge PITA though.

It really is the best carrot cake ever.  I used 3 9" pans instead of 2 10" ones.  Because my family likes cream cheese icing so much, the amount given was just enough for these two layers.

This recipe is excellent.  It yeilds a very "chunky" traditional carrot cake.  I always subtract the pineapple without making any additional additions.  My guess is that it would be even better with the pineapple...but, I have picky eaters.

I have been very loyal to a carrot cake recipe handed down through the family.  But .... this is better.  A rich, moist, dense cake that tastes like carrot cake in a good restaurant.  It's a keeper.  Sorry Grandma!  p.s.  I put the pineapple in a strainer above a bowl with the raisins so that the juice would drain in while the carrots and sugar were sitting.  Added a TB of brandy to the juice/raisins too.  Drained before adding in to recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and the cake lived up to its name. It's perfect with or without raisins or walnuts.  My husband loves it each time I make it and a few family members who "don't like carrot cake" love this cake.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I followed the entire recipe except I did not use the walnuts or raisins.  

Usually I make cupcakes with cake mix and add instant pudding mix to create a slightly denser cupcake.  For this recipe I split it up and did a batch with and without.  In the end both taste great - but I personally preferred it with the instant pudding for the texture.    

I have my own recipe for cream cheese frosting and used that instead.

This recipe made 42 cupcakes.

For those who thought it was too heavy/dense...add 1-tbsp baking powder and its light and perfect!  I give this cake 5-stars with the addition of baking powder :)

I read the reviews carefully,  The only problem I found and like one other person found , it wasnt sweet enough. I guess if your use to store bought carrot cake this will not be a good recipe for you. store cake is very sweet and rich. Maybe if my icing was sweeter it would even it out. texture was great.

This was the first cake I ever made.  I made it for my mom's birthday and she loved it!!  I liked it alot too.  I would suggest cutting the raisins in 4, but other than that the recipe rocked!!  Thank you!!  Also, I would add 1 tsp allspice.  Makes the cake!!

I thought it would have been fantastic given the reviews. I did not change a thing. The cake is not to my liking and it did not rise in the middle -- I wish I had read the reviews before I made this and I would have seen some of them that said the very same thing I ended up finding.

This is a phantastic recipe! I did change a few things... I used whole wheat flour, added an extra .5 tsp of baking powder, used pecans instead of walnuts and soaked the raisins in capt. morgan for about an hour before adding to the carrot mixture. This makes the most dense, moist, delicious cake EVER! (with the cream cheese icing as well) THANKS for the recipe!

Yummy.  I used carrots out of our garden and made sure to drain them after shredding per other reviews.  We tried the cake without frosting and loved it.  Maybe next time I'll frost it.  :)

This is the best carrot cake ever! My son who is 2 years old loves it. If he sees the cake he yells “Cake, Cake, Cake!” I omitted the nuts, put ½ oil ½ applesauce. And sometimes I add a ½-1 tsp of nutmeg for more zing. 
It freezes very well, and you can make cupcakes as well.

It's a wonderful recipe, I changed it though. I used half the oil and added a half cup of cinnamon apple sauce to it. Trying to make it a bit lighter, and of course less oily. I would make this again!

Either way you make this it's really good. I've tired it as is and it tasted great, similar to what you would get if you ate out. With all the suggestions it was really good too, but had more of a homemade taste to it. I've been asked to make this for everyone's birthday  on my husbands side, including him and he hates sweets. Thank you so much for the great recipe.

FAN-TAS-TIC. I omitted the raisins, and added 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I used 3 8" rounds to shorten the bake time. The cake was HUGE so I shared it with my neighbors. Hate I did that! They LOVED it, but so did I....and I wished I had more. Making it again this weekend. I used a modified version of 'Cream Cheese Frosting II,' adjusting the consistency with more sugar, a little heavy cream for more fluffiness, and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I can't wait to have another piece. OH MY GOODNESS!

Used paper towels to squeeze carrots a bit before adding brown sugar.  Cut white sugar to 1 cup.  Used crasins instead of raisins.

Terrific carrot cake! I made a couple of changes and it still came out wonderfully. I substituted 1 mashed up banana and enough chopped apple to make up the volume for the pineapple, and used whole wheat flour for 2/3 of the flour plus adding an extra 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to help counter the extra density that using whole wheat flour brings. Delicious!

I made this for my grandma's birthday and she loved it.  I took the advice to soak the raisins, but I only soaked them as long as the carrots (1 hour) in the pineapple juice and in some coffee.  I recommended this recipe to my neighbor and she took it to a church party that week.  After the cake was gone, people kept coming back just to eat the crumbs!

The first cake I made was a wreck I took it out too early I guess. I immediately made a second cake cutting down on the amount of time the carrots marinated to 15 min. and pressed the liquid out of the pineapple. This time it cooked perfectly. Now, I can't wait to go decorate it!

OH MY WORD!  This cake was wonderful! My family loved it. The only thing that I would do next time is use less raisins, it was a bit too much for me although I didn't get any complaints.

I baked this cake for my son's 38th birthday in Sept. 2008. It was asbsolutely terrific. I made one addition to the menu, and that was 2 tsp. of Allspice - just because our family loves the flavour of allspice in things like bran muffins, banada bread and carrot cake. The cake and the cream cheese frosting were excellent. My son loved the cake. I highly recommend this recipe!

I work off this recipe every time I make carrot cake, although I've made quite a few adjustments and experiments over time: currants and cranberries instead of raisins, more brown sugar than white, butter rather than veggie oil, add some coconut and hazelnuts, etc.

This definetly is the best carrot cake i ever tasted!....Even though it wasn't really moist....Because i was paranoid about the cake being too soggy so i strained more than i had to i guess but overall the flavor was so good that it really didn't matter!....Everybody loved it!....Definetly will make it again!

I gotta say I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I made cupcakes and they came out perfect! 

I soaked my raisins in warm water while the carrots and brown sugar sat (I saved that liquid from the carrots & brown sugar to add to the batter later),  I chose to use canola oil instead of veg oil for a healthier option, and I toasted my walnuts before chopping them for an added "gourmet" touch! 

Overall this recipe is mosit, scrumptious and of course DELISH!!

My friends and family loved this cake! The only modification that I made was to soak the raisins in rum (I used bacardi white) for about four hours.  It keeps them from drying out and gives a yummy taste to the cake.

I made this carrot cake for Easter and it got rave reviews from everyone. It's easy to see how it got the name because people kept saying, "this is the best carrot cake!"
I read many of the reviews before choosing to make the cake.  I grated the carrots in a food processor for ease, mixed them with the brown sugar and after an hour, drained a small amount of liquid out of the bowl.  For personal preference, I omitted the raisins and nuts. I followed the remainder of the recipe.
The mix made 24 nice-sized cupcakes. I baked one (12-count) cupcake pan at a time.
I made the frosting suggested in the review by MelanieDC but only got half of the sugar mixed in and noticed the taste of the confectioners sugar overpowering the cream cheese. 
I was a little disturbed by the amount of oil in this recipe. I generally eat somewhat healthy and although the cake tasted great, I kept wishing I didn't know the ingredients.  Next time, I will probably substitute 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.

This cake turned out very well! I added extra cinnamon and 1/2 tsp baking powder as other reviewers suggested.. I used 3 8" rounds. I took out a little moisture from the carrots but next time I would leave it in.

I only used 4c shredded carrots (which I shredded in the food processor to be quicker) and it turned out great. I also omitted the raisins for personal preference but still very yummy overall.  Its a keeper

This carrot cake is very delicious. I didn't ice it, and even still it was perfect. I found that it got better over time, I guess leaving it for one night allows the flavors to get together.

I made this cake for Christmas 2007, and it was a Big Hit. I bought the 10 inch pans, this was a VERY BIG cake! Not only is this cake big but it is also very filling, because of this I have a lot left over. I used a frosting recipe that I saw posted under the cake. In case it isn't there anymore it is : 1/4 of butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 lb. of powdered sugar. This made enough frosting for the whole cake. Also, I strained the carrots using cheese cloth to get out all of the liquid. After soaking the carrots in the brown sugar, there was alot of liquid left in the bottom of the bowl, I added this to the cake not knowing if I should or not, thankfully it didn't make the cake too mushy. Also, I used parchment paper to line the bottoms of the cake pans, this was an insurance policy to make sure that this moist cake would come out of the pans. It worked. The last tweak that I made to the recipe was to substitute the walnuts for pecans, and omit the raisins (my family doesn't care for them.) All in all this recipe was great, and will be a Christmas staple from now on!

This is a perfect carrot cake, although a bit sweet. I took away 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added 1/4 cup extra raisins so it would be a little sweeter. I also substituted the eggs with applesauce with baking soda and flaxseed egg substitute. Therefore, this recipe turned out vegan.

I followed the recipe exactly and although the cake tastes good, it is heavy and dense and I felt like you needed a chainsaw to cut it. I am going to look for a recipe that has a good flavor but is a bit lighter in weight and texture.

This really was the best carrot cake I've ever had.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and drained the carrots and pineapple really well, adding about two tablespoons of the pineapple juice back when I mixed the dry and wet ingredients together. I also soaked the raisins in pineapple juice and a little warm water and then drained them before adding them. I left out the walnuts since I had some picky eaters to serve and added a dash of nutmeg.

The end result was well, well worth the  effort. I made it for a birthday party and while we usually have quite a bit of cake leftover after birthdays at our house, there were arguments over who would get seconds and every slice was gone by the end of the party.

This definitely is the best carrot cake ever. Actually, this is the FIRST carrot cake I've ever made.  I didn't have 10" pans, so I used 3 - 9" pans for a 3-tier cake, smaller layers and cooked them for 40 minutes.  I think 30-35 minutes would be enough.  I used cream cheese frosting.
This cake is so moist and is full of goodies.  I hit the jackpot when I used this recipe.

Up until this recipe I have never made carrot cake, and will definately be making it again. It wasn't super sweet so I was still able to add cream cheese frosting (my favorite part) it was a huge hit.

I gave this recipe 5 stars but it deserves 10.  I originally needed to bring a carrot cake to work for a friend's birthday.  I tried this recipe and my co-workers literally licked the platter clean.  Since then, I had a several month-long bake sale to raise money for a charity that my friend's and I are involved with.  I made this recipe into muffins and raised about 800 dollars off of this muffin recipe and a few others.  This is probably the best recipe that I have ever gotten from this site.

Very good!  Just make sure the carrots are finely grated and use a lot of icing (two tubs of store bought icing).  I made it a two layer cake with icing in the middle.  Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted raisins for the walnuts. This made 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins for me. They were very tasty, but I would cut the amount of oil used and substitute apple sauce in.

I've tried several carrot cake recipes and this one has earned its title in my cookbook!  It is not too greasy, has nice flavor and a nice texture that is not too dense.  This is a staple recipe.  Thanks.

Fabulous cake, although I will cut back on the oil next time.  I used a 3 inch high 10 inch round pan, baked for 1 1/2 hour, turned out great.

NO joke why it is called the best carrot cake ever!! yummy. I did use peacons instead of walnuts and I used 1/2c apple sauce and 1/c of oil instead of 1 c oil. I also used the cream cheese frosting II as recommended by others. It was perfect made the cake twice in one week both times......gone.

This is a very rich, pudding-like recipe. I made it for my mom's birthday luncheon and everyone enjoyed it. I did have to increase the baking time by 20 minutes and added ground cloves, allspice, and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I would probably decrease the white sugar by 1/2 C next time. Thank you for a tasty treat.

Excellent recipe.  I used golden raisins; however, it's not possible to make this cake even better.  MAKE SURE YOU USE THE CRUSHED PINEAPPLE.  It's what makes the cake moist.

Good, but not the *best* carrot cake. This may be due to me not waiting the hour recommended to leave the carrots and brown sugar mixture. I would definately leave it for the full hour. This maybe doesn't have enough spices, it lacked a little flavor. But, overall, good. I left out the pineapple and used cream cheese frosting. Thanks!

I was looking for a new carrot cake recipe that was layered but yet different in its making. This is it! Wow! delicious. Well worth the extra time it takes to make. Note* I made mine in two 9 in. cake pans and it worked out just fine. I did however split the layers in half as they were tall. I frosted with the whipped cream cheese frosting posted on this site. Yumm!

I'm not rating this yet because I think I messed up somehow. I've been told that I'm a pretty good baker. I followed this recipe exactly, but it turned out VERY dense and not very tasty because of it. I added an extra 10 to 15 minutes baking time because my oven is a microwave/oven in one and it seems to take extra time for things to bake.
The only thing I did differently was using butter instead of oil because I didn't have any on hand. I also used a few of the others advice and used a 1/2 cup of butter (I had no oil) and then used 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I would have just added the oil if I had any on hand.
I'm pretty sure I measured the flour correctly. Maybe I should add an extra 20 minutes to the baking time next time around since it wasn't anywhere near burning with the added 10-15 minutes baking time. It was kinda chewy/dense. Bleck!
I was really looking forward to this recipe since I just moved overseas and my boyfriend had never heard of carrot cake before and has never tried it. I don't want his opinion to be turned off of carrot cake so I'm not even going to let him try it. He's VERY picky.
Anyhow, any suggestions would be great. Since 95% of the reviews are extremely positive I'm going to take it as a hint that my changing the recipe around has to do with it. I'll try it again in the future and make sure I have oil on hand and cook it longer.

Made this cake for the future in-laws. I was at first worried about how much carrot was in the cake, but it came out beautiful and everyone raved about how moist it was. Will definitely make this again.

Wow.  Really wow.  Fantastic recipe.  I had to adjust it slightly and it was still amazing.  I don't like raisins in carrot cake, so I left those out and my father-in-law is allergic to walnuts, so I used pecans.  Still absolutely fabulous.  Everyone thought I spent hours in the kitchen.  :-)  Thank you!

I cannot believe anyone would rate this anything less than  stars! This was out of this world! I served it to a bunch of Army wives, and everyone said it was the best Carrot Cake they ever had. My kids loved helping me make this. When I asked them what they thought, they said, and I quote, "It's a keeper"!!!!!

My Mother just came home from the hospital from having a stroke and the family was having a celebration dinner in her honor. I was hosting it at my house and I wanted to make a special cake for her and I chose this one. I am so Happy that I did! It was a perfect cake! It was so easy to make too. Who ever made this one up should be very proud! When I made this cake I didn't know if I should pack down the carrots in the measuring cup or not. So I did but not to tight. Then I was surprised to see that when I put the brown sugar on the carrots that it draws out a lot of water out of the carrots. I wasn't sure if I should add that water to the badder or to drain it off. So I added it. This cake could not have been more perfect! It was so moist. I made it the day before the party and I frosted it with a cream cheese frosting and I kept it cold in the refrigerator. I will make this again and again! Kudos to the Mamma or Daddy of the recipe.

This is an amazing cake!  I used this cake for the bottom layer of my wedding cake, and five minutes after we cut the cake, it was gone.  Everyone was raving about it!  I have made it for several occations now, and it has always been a hit.

This was okay...followed the recipe to a tee but the cake turned out a little heavy and chewy.  Just did not have a light cake texture at all.  I know carrot cake is always a little heavier...but not like this.  A little disappointed in myself and in the recipe??  But, it is good the next day and it does have a good taste!  We will be eating it, but will not make it again.

I love carrot cake, and I think this IS the best I've had. I usually play with recipes but stuck close to this one because of all the good reviews. The only thing I did differently was change the sugar to 1c sugar plus1/2c pure grade B maple syrup. So moist and delicious. Thank you Nan.

Pretty awesome carrot cake.  I also made 3-8" layers.  My suggestion for good presentation: when using the cream cheese frosting spread generous amounts in between each layer, then let the frosting set up in the refrigerator before adding another layer.  Regardless of how it looks though, it will taste amazing!

Definitely a 5-star recipe! I have no complaints and made no alerations (difficult for me!). It simply didn't need any. I brought it to work and got rave reviews. For the topping, I used a whipped cream cheese frosting that is also on this site.

I have been craving carrot cake for quite a while so my wife sent me to this site.  I took the recipe with me on vacation to California and make it for my in-laws.  I made it in a 9X13 pan and the five us ate half of it at the first sitting.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was not thrilled with the results of this carrot cake. It was not bad- but not a 5 star in MY book. It was VERY dense! Reminds me of the little carrot cakes that you buy at the gas station -wrapped in plastic wrap with the sickeningly sweet frosting. Do you know the ones I'm thinking of? I did not change the recipe much- I used about half the raisins (there were still PLENTY) and threw in a small handful of coconut and a dash of nutmeg. I do have one helpful hint to anyone handgrating the 6 cups of carrots- don't be lazy like I was and use the baby carrots in the fridge instead of running to the store for the big ones! It took me a good 1/2 hour and a few fingernails! But that was my own fault. I will not make this again- I like my carrot cake lighter and fluffier than this dense, thick, like a rock in my tummy type.

This was truly a wonderful cake!  It does make a HUGE cake, though!  I did not have two 10-inch baking pans, so I ended up with too much batter.  It is a bit labor intensive if you have to manually shred the carrots like I did, but definently worth it.  I frosted it with the Allspice Cream Cheese frosting from this site.  Thank you!!

OK, First off.  I'm an amateur baker.  This was my first carrot cake, and I made it for a friend's 40th B-day party because that was his favorite cake.  The author of this recipe made me look really good last night and I'm very thankful.  Additionally, the party was at a local "trendy" restaurant and I brought the cake along with us (Of course, I checked with the restaurant first). Everyone FLIPPED over the cake, especially the B-day boy and even the waitress.  She decided to try a piece because I told her it was homemade.  Apparently she really liked it because the owner of the restaurant came over and asked if he could have a piece as well. I had provided her with a large enough sample to provide a decent sugar rush to most of the staff in back.  Apparently she freely shared it becuase waiters kept coming by and saying they "loved the cake".  This cake definitely lives up to its name.

This carrot cake really is the BEST EVER!  It is awesome with the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting from this website.  I made it for my dad's birthday, and he loved it, as did everyone else.  The pineapple really makes it moist.  I cooked it at about 340 degrees, so the outside wouldn't get too dark.  It also turns out beautiful in a bundt pan.  I will make this again and again!

I already have a carrot cake recipe I like, but since this got rave reviews I decided to try it.  The crust was dark and thick, I had to trim away 25% of the cake to get rid of it.  Dry and chewy.  A terrible cake!

Awesome.  This cake earned rave reviews from everyone who tasted a slice.  I did sub. 1/2c applesauce for 1/2c vegetable oil, just to cut down on fat content a tad.  Still excellent.  Thanks Nan!

Dense and moist, like everyone has said.  I scaled the recipe down to 1/4 because I just wanted to make enough to use up a little bit of cream cheese frosting.  Now I wish I'd made the original amount, used three cake pans, and just frozen two of the layers.  I substituted applesauce for about half of the oil, and added handful of shredded coconut.  What's great is that it's not overly sweet, and at one layer it seems like a nice, fairly healthy snack cake.

My mom requested carrot cake for her birthday and after asking her what she likes in a carrot cake, this recipe was the closest.  Dense, lots of carrots, pineapple, nuts, raisins, not too spicy.  I only made a few changes.  I used pecans, whole wheat pastry flour, 5 cups of carrots, 1 cup of brown sugar to replace the 1 1/2 cups of white flour, and as I always do with cakes, I replaced the oil with nonfat plain yogurt.  It was exactly what she wanted.  I made it in a greased 10x15 glass baking dish and only had to bake it for 35 min.  Delicious, Nan.

This is the BEST carrot cake I've EVER had. It's moist and has a GREAT flavor. I served it at a dinner party for 6 and they raved over it.  I also took it to a family reunion and they were complaining because I only brought one!  I reduced the carrots to 4 cups, used about 3T of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, ground the walnuts finely, and added the juice w/ the crushed pineapple.  Use the recipe for Bourbon Cream Cheese Frosting and it's a HIT!!  Just use 2T of bourbon instead of 5T or you'll be drunk before you eat half a piece of cake!  It's wonderful and I make it all the time now!!  Tastes gourmet!!!  I hope this helps!

I use the batter for this recipe to make muffins and the kids absolutely LOVE them!  And on days when I'm feeling particularily health concious I substitute whole wheat for regular flour, and brown for white sugar...  They're just as amazing.

I must say that the name *does not* speak for itself.  Way to much carrot flavor and so dense.  I'm glad I only made 1/2.  It's edible but the orange cream cheese frosting I made covers some of the overwhelming carrot taste.  Will not make this again.  I'm kind of sad I've had such luck on this site with other recipes.  I guess u win some and lose some.

I thought this cake was average at best :\ It was sort of bland, and the pieces of pineapple were a little weird. 

I don't understand what the majority likes so much about this cake.

Truly the best!!! I made a few changes though which made it even better: I omitted the pineapple and added an extra cup of grated carrots, used only one tsp of cinnamon and instead of the walnuts I added 1/2 cup ground hazelnuts and 1/2 cup finely chopped hazelnuts. YUMMY! Very moist and excellent with the allspice cream cheese frosting!

I've made this a few times now.  My minor changes:  add 1/2 tsp. each of ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice along with the cinnamon; 1/2 cup extra flour and 1/4 cup shredded coconut.  This cake is the winner of all carrot cakes.  For the cream cheese icing, I make a very fluffy version with grated orange peel and OJ, lots of butter and a block of full-fat cream cheese., and as little powdered sugar as possible--not sweet but very flavourful.

WOW! I can't say enough about this amazing carrot cake. I made it exactly as instructed. It was the biggest hit at the annual fundraiser dessert table. It's a frequent request by family and friends. My knees get weak just writing the review. What a fantastic indulgence.

I used 3, 8", square cake pans, to make a triple layer cake. I added crushed pineapple & walnuts to a basic cream cheese icing recipe. Family says it IS the best carrot cake ever! Will definitely make this again!

I made this cake for the first time this morning for work colleagues as it was a request to have a carrot cake. It's a HUGE success! And it makes A LOT. I was surprised. This will become a stable in my books. Thank you for sharing, it's made a lot of people happy (even the ones that said they didn't like Carrot Cake ;) )

November 2, 2018
This is the third time in one week I’ve made this cake. The last time I used sweet potatoes shredded. I did tweek the cake after reading other reviews. I used 3/4 of a cup of coconut oil creamed into my sugar and eggs till fluffy. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white. The pinejapple I drained very well then added some back if my batter was to dry. Please note, this is a dense cake so if you test with a toothpick it very likely will come out clean while the cake might not be finished cooking. My last cake was a double batch, I baked in two ovens at the same temperature and the one oven took 10 more minutes then the other. Why three in one week? My son’s building business is renovating a house down the street from me. I like to show up once in a while with food. The guys cannot get enough of this cake!
BTW.  I used Six cups shredded carrots or 4 cups shredded carrots packed.

Only because I ran out of time I combined and refrigerated overnight the shredded carrot, brown sugar, and raisins. The raisins absorbed the liquid from the carrots and plumped up nicely by the time I got back to it the next day. The batter was thick and lovely and baked up beautifully. I made a mascarpone cream cheese filling and a cream cheese buttercream for the top. YUM! I will definitely make this recipe again.

I used golden and regular raisins. I put them in hot water from my hot water dispenser right away so they could soak while I did everything else . I bought shredded carrots, dumped them in my Kitchenaid, and added the brown sugar. I mixed them up and that also chopped them into smaller pieces and released some water. When it came time to add them to the mix, I drained all the fluid out and only added about 3 tablespoons of it back in. I did not drain the pineapple but I also didn't allow much of the juice when measuring it out. All the rest of the recipe was followed and the cake turned out amazing. Very moist but not like a pudding as some described.

This is an exceptional cake. Full of flavor, moist, and not too sweet. I will say that the reason I love this site so much is because of the handy dandy tips other bakers/chefs who try the recipes and give their accounts. I did drain my carrots, pineapple and also my raisins that I plumped. The moisture level was on point because of this. I also used room temp eggs and mixed all ingredients as little as possible while still getting it all intergrated. For my first time making this, our guests (and my man) were blown away!! I can't wait to make again honestly.

My family loved this recipe but I had to take out the raisins and pineapples because of picky eaters in my family. I also had to add another cup of carrots to substitute the missing ingredients and it still turned out great and moist. For sure will cook this again.

This has been my husbands birthday cake every year, the only change I made was to not drain the pineapple, just dump in the whole can. It is always a hit.

This is the only carrot cake I make and that is requested by friends time and time again. The comment usually being......she makes the best carrot cake. Granted I have to cut back on the servings and if someone wants is healthier, i.e. less oil and sugar it still comes out perfectly.    Also it is very easy to make and sometimes I do not even ice it.....it is very moist and a little heavy but then carrot cakes are not supposed to be light.   Great recipe which I highly recommend.   Do not be afraid to makes adjustments (within reason) to personal taste.    I would not substitute all applesauce for oil because you are going to not have satisfactory results.

For a gluten free version I used NAMASTE perfect blend flour and a little extra  baking soda. It took longer to bake even in a convection oven and using a ceramic baking dish. It made the best gluten free carrot cake I have tasted. Just a little sticky as is common with gluten free flours.

I have made this cake over and over again!  It is delicious.  Everyone absolutely loves it and raves about it every time I make it.  It is tradition now that I make it every Easter.  My mother even requested that I make it for her birthday cake.  I omit the raisins since I am not a fan, but other then that I stick to the recipe.  5 stars for this cake!  I finish it up with my cream cheese frosting.

I love this recipe... I definitely tweak things based on what I have in stock, but love love this one!  I think I used grated apple instead of crushed pineapple once- worked out great, although the pineapple would have been better, of course!   I also use pecans instead of walnuts, but that's for personal reasons!

Rave reviews from everyone who tasted it, including my brother who doesn't even like cake! I modified by draining the pineapple and carrot combination. Did not even add the liquid back to the batter. Just delicious!

I made this for my husband today and it turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe word for word and didn't have any problems with the cake being too mushy/heavy/dense or it falling in the center like other reviewers. I don’t remember ever liking carrot cake, so this was the first I have made in a LONG time, and it is the first one I remember actually enjoying. This was great by itself (as I munched on the scraps I trimmed off) and it is also great paired with the Cream Cheese Frosting II, also found on this site.

I tried this recipe at the same time I tried another.  I actually thought the other one, which included buttermilk would be better.  I was surprised.  This definitely WAS the best carrot cake ever!  The brown sugar pulling the moisture out of the carrots was brilliant, and increased the moisture of the cake as well as how well it stayed together.  I used large peels of carrots and did cupcakes so that I could give them away and get everyone's opinion.  My husband and I try not to eat a lot of sugar.  With only one exception this was the winner.  It was a bit of a project getting 6 cups of shredded carrots - but I think for a big  hit, it was worth it!.   So delicious.  I used a common cream cheese frosting found here on allrecipes.com but I used coconut oil instead of butter in ALL of the recipes.

This recipe is great as is.  My husband LOVES carrot cake and he always gets excited when he sees me buying a big bag of carrots because he knows im about to make this recipe!  The only thing I ever do differently is occasionally make cupcakes instead of a regular cake.

LOVED this recipe! I made it for my son's 1st birthday party and it came out perfectly moist and delicious, (I didn't add nuts of course)just made a few alterations to my liking:

1 cup coconut (adds the perfect sweetness and texture!)
1/2 tsp Allspice
1/2 tsp Nutmeg
Dried the carrots very well in a paper towel and used half of the juice left over in the bowl after it sits for 1 hour.
Plumped raisins in pineapple juice for 1 hour while carrots and brown sugar set, as another reviewer did, great idea! 
Used another reviewers cream cheese frosting below.

I took the left-over half a cake to my husbands work the next day and not a piece was left and everyone loved it!

OMG clearly the best carrot cake recipe EVER by far! I made 36 cupcakes in convection oven at 180*C for around 25 mins, just delicious. In fact I think they were even better the next day after being enclosed in an airtight container, I've now passed this recipe on to 3 other friends and it will be my one and only carrot cake recipe from now on.

Lovely. my second trial for carrot cake. I've made a couple of changes. 1) i used only half recipe; 2) i only used 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp ginger powder; 3) i omitted the nuts; 4) i didn't use crushed pineapple, but i chopped off 1 big pineapple, squeezed out the juice and give it to my husband; 5) i squeezed the carrot to almost dry only and i didn't bother leaving it for an hour with the sugar. baked it for an hour, and frosted it cream cheese frosting II from this website. it was a hit. together with my Japanese cheesecake, it was gone within seconds from the dessert table. everyone said that this is the best carrot cake they ever had.

I was so nervous while this was baking I could hardly stand it.  I read lots of reviews.  I drained the liquid from 3 cups of the carrots (I had about 5 1/2 cups total...GEEZ that's a LOT of carrot).  I put the grated carrot into a paper towel and squeezed out the juice before putting it together with the brown sugar.  I drained the pineapple the same way.  I used an 11x15in sheet pan.  The batter was fairly thick.  There was so much carrot it looked like a carrot casserole! Luckily I am baking it on a Wed night for a Fri Night party so I plan to refidgerate it 24hrs...then frost it and then refridgerate it another 24hrs. Based on other reviews...it's better the next day so that settles my nerves a little.  But STILL NERVOUS because it just looks like sooo much CARROT!  Will formally rate the outcome in 48hours.   After 50 min of baking the toothpick came out clean. It didn't rise at all so was a very flat cake. It felt like a solid heavy brick.  It came out of the pan perfectly after 15min of cooling.  I let it cool completely and wrapped it up and put it in the fridge for 24hrs.  Frosted it with cream cheese frosting and put int he fridge for another 24hrs for the big event.

Awesome cake. I bake it a day or two in advance, wrap the layers in plastic wrap and take it with on long drives to relatives. Then I ice it when we arrive. The time in the wrap lets it "mellow" and it's extra moist. I come out the star!

Super moist, and delicious!  I didn't have pineapple, so I used fresh peaches.  I also forgot the cinnamon (I know, who forgets to put cinnamon in carrot cake?), so I added it to the frosting.  It worked like a charm!

Thank you! I have looked for a recipe like my mom's for a long time, and this is it!  The brown sugar and pineapple in this recipe were the missing items from others. This is a wonderful dense, nutty, spicy, carrot bread-weight cake. CRYSTALLAUREY's suggestion to squeeze out some extra moisture from the carrots and pineapple was helpful.

I made this cake in two 10 inch pans instead of a 9x13.  It was firm, dry and heavy.  I would prefer a lighter - fluffier cake.  It cannot cook 1 minute longer than suggested.  The ingredients seemed good so I will try it again in a 9x13 dish.

I made this for my bosses 60th birthday and it was an absolute hit! I did what was suggested from others... more pineapple juice than water. I didn't have the 10" pans so I used three 8" instead. The only problem with this is the cake was so tall I couldn't fit the cake cover over the cake! This recipe is a keeper!

The cake was so good!!  I did take suggestions from other reviewers and drained everything really well.  I did not add the walnuts becasue of my daughters allergies but did everything else exactly as the recipe said!!  Everyone raved over this when we served it for Easter dessert!!

I liked Sam's carrot cake better (on this site).  This one was more "walnutty" and had 2 more cups of carrots than Sam's - but I LOVED THE OTHER ONE'S FLAVOR!  Also, I made 3 7" layers with this cake - it was beautiful!

Turned out GREAT!  I used shredded carrots and ran them through my food processor real quick to get them chopped down to about the size of rice.  Then squeezed the carrots out in cheesecloth to remove excess carrot juice to prevent the cake from becoming soggy.  Only ended up with about four cups of carrots, but it was perfect.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled nutmeg and a tiny bit of raw sugar (adds a little sparkle!) on top.  Delicious!

I used cake flour instead of regular flour.

I loved this recipe with a few modifications. I used all organic ingredients.  I soaked the raisins in water while the carrots marinated in the brown sugar. I strained the raisins and added them to the carrot mixture. I then strained the carrots/ raisin mixture. I also used a 14 oz can of crushed pineapple instead of 2 eight oz cans. I strained the pineapple also, and poured the juice over the carrot mixture so it coated the carrots and raisins but then strained out also. I saved the brown sugar carrot pineapple juice from straining and added a little more than 1 cup of it back in at the end while mixing the batter. I also substituted coconut sugar for white sugar to stay a little on the healthier side. I ended up making cup cakes with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" in which I also used all organic ingredients and used powered sugar to taste, as another reviewer recommended. These were seriously delicious!!! Next time I will spice the cake a bit more with some chai spices though!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was very good. I even used white wheat flour which gave the cake a different but great flavor. I have made many carrot cakes and this is one of the better ones I've made. It's a moist but dense cake. I didn't have pineapple so I used applesauce, added finely shredded coconut, and some extra spices. Great recipe.

i love this cake, and get requested to make it often! I use only 1 cup of oil because it's already very moist and the less oil makes it a little less dense. I also used dried cherries instead of raisins, but that is because I don't like raisins.

Best carrot cake ever! I read most of the comments and followed the other readers' suggestions (soak raisin in water, drain most of the liquid out of the carrot and sugar mixture) and the cake turned out really well-- both the texture and taste are perfect! The frosting is amazing too!

very excellent carrot cake.  I made it as cupcakes and I think would be better as a cake in 9 x 13 pan or definitely a layer cake. It was moist and delicious. Mush better than Carrot Cake III. Add the raisins next time!! (Didn't have any on hand.)

Moist, rich and perfect!  I forgot to marinate the carrots in the brown sugar but it still turned out beautifully. I didn't find the cake overly moist and made it as a bundt cake instead of 2 cakes.  Had enough left over batter to make about 10 cupcakes.  Lemon cream cheese frosting was the perfect topping.

This is indeed the best carrot cake recipe ever.  I made it last night and even without the frosting everyone ate it up!  It's moist, delicious and just perfect in every way.  I'm usually not a big carrot cake fan but this recipe is making one out of me.

I made this recipe once before and it was a sensation. I was sick to my stomach when I couln't find it on the web today. Every recipe for carrot cake I could find used between 2 and 4 cups carrot. I truly believe the secret to this recipes success is the 6 cups carrot. I had no problems with it at all. I did ommit the raisons and pinapple though but only because I dislike raisins and had no pinapple, too lazy to run to the store. Still came out fabulous. Just make it already. LOL!

WOW. This is one heck of a cake. It is a meal in itself! We made it with 3 layers because there was too much batter for 2 pans. It's just perfection with some cream cheese frosting! Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving since everytone else made the Pumpkin Pies. It turned out great and everyone loved it! The one thing that I did change: I did not add the pineapple. I did replace it with 1/2 cup of applesauce instead. The flavor of the cake was wonderful and it was very moist!

Great cake. Soaking the raisins in brandy or rum first enhances the flavour and plumps up the dired fruit.

I have made this cake at least for or five times and every time it is just like the title "Best Carrot Cake Ever."  This is what I am told by everyone and I have to laugh because that's the name of it and I tell them that.  It is the absolute best ever!!! I really don't like to give out the recipe, it's my secret.  Great cake!!!

Excellent cake, but this is the heaviest cake.  I made it for my sister's birtday and everyone loved it.  I really never realized how many carrots 6 cups is.  It took nearly an hour to grate carrots!  Unless you have all day, this is a two evening process.

I made this exactly as the recipe described but I used three cake pans and made a three layer cake so that the cake would cook faster and more evenly. I have not tasted it yet, but the consistency is perfect. I iced the cake w/ cream cheese frosting 2 recipe. It is the best frosting I have ever made.

Awesome! I made this into mini carrot cake "loaves" for my neighbors. My neighbors asked me to do this for them every Easter from now on! They all want the recipe! Only cook the mini loaves for about 35-40 minutes. This recipe will make 10 mini loaves. I just bought the aluminum mini loaf pans at Wal-Mart and sprayed them with cooking spray and they popped right out.  I made a simple cream cheese frosting, spread it on top of each, wrapped them in plastic wrap and tied a ribbon around each. I loved it!

I cannot say it is the best ever carrot cake because this one was the second one I have tried, but it was SO GOOD that I will not try any others! I did not use nuts and used less sugar as I was afraid it will be too sweet. And it was perfect! And we did not need any icing :)Three people who tried it asked for the recipe!

Simply the Best!! I, too, soaked the raisins along with the carrots and brown sugar and halved the oil with apple sauce. I made 2 cakes, one being finished the next day at a retirement party and the other one saved until 3 days later. Kept it refrigerated and iced and was a hit and still very moist.

WAY too dense and heavy, even after cutting the oil by a third.  good flavor, though, and my friends liked it.  i'll stick with my standard recipe.

This cake is delicious! My husband even had 2 slices and he doesn't eat cake. Easy to make, my son helps me each time. I have made it many times now. This last time I did a 9X13 pan and cooked about 30 mins. You can't go wrong with this carrot cake!

I made this recipe for my Mother's birthday last year and she told me that instead of a present, I could just make her this cake every year. Her birthday was this week and so I made it again. Everyone that ate it claims it was "Super" delish! I did drain my pineapple and carrots and I added 1/2 cup of Rum. This cake didn't last the whole day, everyone that ate it came back for seconds!

I think this really is the best carrot cake ever. What I did: I drained the pineapples very well. I didn't use all of the liquid from the carrot/brown sugar mixture. I maybe used 2 tbsp of the brown sugar liquid. 
I omitted the raisins (by accident). 
I baked in 2 9" cake pans (don't now why everyone says this makes so much cake -- it was perfect in two 9" pans) for 40 minutes. 
Everyone LOVED the cake. I frosted it with the bourbon cream cheese frosting from this site.
I will definitely be making this again!

What more can I say? I warmed my raisins in water in the microwave and then forgot to add them to the cake, lol. But none-the-less the cake came out wonderful.

Overall, this was a good carrot cake. But, I would not add as much vanilla next time, I thought it made the icing excessively sweet. I would reduce it by atleast 2 teaspoons. My only other complaint would be that I had 1-2 cups of leftover icing.

I made half the amount for a 9'' round cake. Used Cream Cheese Frosting II (fabulous!), left out raisins and used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon (instead of 2) and 1/2 tsp ground mixed spice. Didn't drain carrots as suggested by others, cake was very moist, perfect!

This was pretty good.  I think that I went a little overboard draining the fluid from the carrots and pineapple because it was borderline dry.  It still tasted good.  I'll make it again but maybe keep a bit of the juice.  I only used 2 9x9 square pans and baked for 40 minutes.  This is my very first carrot cake and I am new at this so, obviously I made a small error somewhere.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was really good.

I've made this cake, exactly as is, more times than I can count and it's always fantastic!  The best carrot cake recipe I've found.  Friends and family always ask me to bring it to parties and get-togethers.  It's best when topped with Whipped Cream Cheese frosting which can also be found here on All Recipes!

This was my first carrot cake--and it was awesome. The kids helped me make it, which was fun. I bought 2 bags of grated carrots instead of attempting this myself. I'm sure this cut down on the time. This is a heavy cake but sooooo good! My husband took half of it to work, where it received more rave reviews.

This cake is the BEST! I made it for a birthday party at my work and everyone went crazy asking for the recipe. I did make some of the changes that the other reviewers made. I made (3)8" rounds and layered them. I drained the pineapple and the carrots. Cake came out perfectly moist! I also followed the recipe for the icing from dessertmaker2 and it came out perfect! I will make this cake from now and forever!

It was requested that I make a carrot cake one year for Thanksgiving, so I came here first and found this recipe, which looked like a winner. It turned out so well that my family now begs me to make this every Thanksgiving. A humorous incident: I shelled my own walnuts (we had a bunch in the house) and left a piece of shell on entirely by accident. My nephew's girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on my cake, so now every time I make it  everyone's cautioned to not break their teeth on my cake!! :)

Very yummy. Definitely my favourite carrot cake recipe ever. I make this all the time now and am always asked for the recipe. It keeps well refrigerated for days and still tastes great.  
I love nuts, and I think the walnuts are a great touch. Unfortunately my family don't like nuts very much so I half the amount of walnuts, which seems perfect. You can't really taste them, but you still get that nice bit of texture.

Wow, the name says it all! I originally made one for Easter, and received rave reviews from both my family and my boyfriend's family. I brought in some extra to work, and everyone loved it. Since that, I have been requested to make this cake for two birthdays and a baby shower! It is a big hit, I think the crushed pineapple really adds to the moistness and flavor. Also, I shredded my carrots by hand and let them mix with the brown sugar overnight, just so I don't have to do all of the work in one day. Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe!

After using this site for years, I registered so I could rate this recipe!  I followed the recipe to a T and it is DELICIOUS!  I made it on Mother's Day for the first time and my family liked it so much that my brother basically begged me to make it for his birthday this week!  I HIGHLY recommend this cake!

Excellent, made it for a work potluck.  Baked it in a 12" inch cake pan and it baked up perfectly. Used with cream cheese II icing.  I used the golden rather than regular raisins as others have recommended. Perfect cake.

This was very moist and got great compliments with cream cheese frosting. I ommitted the raisins and nuts, and it still turned out. It took a LONG time to grate the carrots, but it was worth it.

I deviated only slightly from the recipe:  I only had 3/4 cup of oil, so I added 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also omitted the raisins and nuts.  This recipe made enough for 2 8-inch cake layers and 3 cupcakes (one of which I claimed).  I used store bought cream cheese icing and I found the cake to be very tasty with a nice moist texture.  I did find that it baked faster than the recipe stated.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the outcome and I'm looking forward to sharing the cake with my family!

THE best carrot cake ever!  I didn't add nuts because it was for children but it was fantastic anyways.  The nuts would be even better!  I did use only 1/2 C. oil and 1/2 C. applesauce.  This is a very moist cake and I would definetly make it the night before and serve it the next day as the flavors and moistness take over!  A hit with everyone!

WOW--that is always the reaction I get when I make this recipe (and use cream cheese frosting II).  I've been asked to bring it again this year to Easter!  I make it exactly as is and it is perfect (although, I do use baking raisins---soooo moist).

I am not a nut person, so I put a few extra raisins in instead. This cake is rich, moist, delicious, and I don't feel all that guilty eating it. For a smoother texture, it's worth the effort of shredding your own carrots and not buying the pre-shredded ones at the grocery store. They come out crunchier. This cake has become a staple at our Easter lunch.

A bit of a pain to make, (more time consuming than anything) but, well worth the effort.I added alittle ground nutmeg and applepie spice to add more flavor. I frosted it with the Cream Cheese II frosting and took it to work. The response went something like this...awesome, great, fabulous etc.. Anyway, I will make this again (per request) for a coworkers birthday this month. This time I may cheat and buy the already shredded carrots in the veggie dept.to cut down on time.Yummmmm!

This recipe was just what I was looking for in a carrot cake!  It was moist, dense (in a good way), and so delicious; everyone just loved it.  A healthfood/organic friend of ours even went for seconds!  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting 11 from this site - PERFECT!

This was so good.  I wasn't sure why I had to marinate the carrots in the brown sugar at first, but then realized that it made a kind of "juice."  I left out the nuts, added more cinnamon and a bit of pumpkin pie spice, left a little of the pineapple juice in, and baked as cupcakes.  Got great reviews from the entire family at a party.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

use about half the sugar!  brown sugar works well for both parts (also substituted a little honey and maple syrup).  i also used ground oat flour... trying to make it a little healthier.

This is a great recipe!  I had to adjust for altitude (-2T white sugar, + 1T pineapple juice, + 2.5T flour, -1/2tsp b. soda) because I live at 5,000 ft.  I also liked it better when it wasn't cold, so I would recommend frosting it right before serving it.  Just a thought.

Good and peasy to make.  I only used 5 cups of carrots and that seemed just enough.  Its very dense cake, not light and airy at all.  Not the best carrot cake i've ever had, but pretty darn good.  I used the cream cheese frosting website on this site - the frosting really makes the cake!  I had extra walnuts, so I chopped them fine and added them to the sides of the cake after icing - they really made for an impressive looking cake.

Young and old loved this moist cake.  Many said it was the best they have had.  This will be my recipe from here on out.  Used Cream Cheese Frosting II as suggested.  Changes: Did not add nuts.  Next time I will for the nut lovers.  Enjoy!!!

I made this recipe for Easter.  It turned out perfectly.  There was enough batter to make three 9 inch layers.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe & there was plenty to frost it all.  BUT...I had trouble slicing through the finished cake.  It is so dense that the pressure of slicing a piece made the icing come out of the layers.  (It was even refrigerated overnight.) The density also makes this cake VERY filling.  I believe it would be better overall to make this into a sheet cake with no layers & ice only the top.  It is very tasty, but not the BEST I've ever had.

I made this for Easter.  It is a VERY rich, dense cake.  I should have grated the carrots smaller.  I did cut back on the oil as others suggested with good results.  I'm not sure I'd make this again for the amount of work that went into it.  My family said they liked it, but I had a lot of cake left over, so maybe they were just being polite.  The pineapple adds a unique flavor.

This is an excellent cake, moist, spicy & flavorful.  A note to those who haven't made carrot cake before (like myself): make sure you either grate carrots into very fine, short strips using a box grater, or use a food processor!  Silly me, I used a regular hand peeler thinking the pieces would be small enough, and ended up with stringy carrot cupcakes :(.  Still tasty, but weird!  I also used Cream Cheese Frosting II (made with neufchatel cheese) and it was wonderful.

I made this cake for my Dad's birthday and forgot to add the pineapple, but it was AWESOME just the same! SO moist! My husband says it's a keeper.  Thanks Nan and everyone who has rated this recipe before.  Fabulous!

I first made this cake in June 2004 and have made it numerous times since. I always get rave reviews! It is the best carrot cake! I use brown sugar cream cheese frosting (recipe also on this site). Delicious!

This was my first time trying out a carrot cake and it turned out pretty well. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I found that it was a bit too sweet, however I did not make any icing to go with it so perhaps it didn't have the sourness of a cream cheese ising to balance it out.  Next time I am going to use only 1 cup of white suger, instead of the 1 and a half.

I am not a fan of carrot cake...the 'vegetable cake' thought pops into my mind...but I made this for a coworker's birthday. I was pleasantly surpised at how well it turned out. I substituted the oil for applesauce and I think this helped keep the cake moist and less dense. It rose perfectly. I read some other reviews and added the cloves, nutmeg and allspice. It was delish!

My mom did however get diabetes so this year for his birthday I used splenda for the white sugar and I can't believe it's not butter for the butter - no one noticed a thing!!!!! so good for you to know if you want to make it more low cal. Def. the best carrot cake EVER

This was the first carrot cake that I have ever made and it turned out great!! I didn't add the raisins because our kids don't like them, but everything else stayed the same. My husband took some to work to share and he was going back for another slice and it was gone!

It really is the best carrot cake!  I did change a couple of things to make it a little less fattening.  I used half applesauce and half oil and used eggbeaters instead of eggs and no nuts.  I also added a heaping teaspoon of nutmeg for more flavor and I had friends raving about the cake.  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting recipe on this site also and used confectioners sugar instead of regular sugar and I could have eaten the frosting by itself it was soooo good.

This is great!  I halved the recipe and made it in a bundt cake mold.  I used a little more of grated carrots than was called.  Microwaved the cream cheese a little to soften up a bit and drizzled it on top.  The cake was moist and had the just right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Being a beginner baker, I was a little nervous making this the day of my mom's birthday party, because if it didn't come out well, I was stuck. I was relieved to find that this recipe is as easy as it is delicous and I've gotten nothing but raves. I'd make it again in a second!

i made this recipe for my moms birthday she found this site and recipe and i made it for her. she loved it and so did my dad.  i did drain the pineapple juice for the cake but saved it and put it in the frosting. it was delicious. i did not use raisins or walnuts either and it was delectable, or so i was told. im not much for carrot cake but i tasted the batter before i added the carrots and brown sugar and it was delicious as just a pineapple cake. i plan to make the pineapple cake this week. yummy yummy yummy, you have to try it. thanks mom good find.

This was the first carrot cake I ever tried to make.  I partnered it with the recipe "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this sight.  The cake was simply fantastic!!!

Listening to some of the other reviews on here, I only put half a cup of oil (canola) and did not drain the pineapple juice out.  It turned out perfectly being the equal of the best carrot cake I have ever had.  As others said, its a lot of work but well worth it!

This really is the BEST Carrot Cake EVER!  I wanted to make a special Carrot Cake for my friend (Carrot Cake is her favorite) and don't know ANYTHING about Carrot Cake...took title's advice and made it!  It was awesome.  I topped it with a store bought Cream Cheese icing (I know...shame on me), but it WAS AWESOME!  I 1/2'd it and just made ONE round pan and omitted the raisins (on accident)...it truly was the BEST Carrot Cake EVER in friend's opinion :)  She didn't even KNOW it had pineapple in it.  I found a few recipes that don't have pineapple, etc. in it and didn't know which one she really liked, but this one was PERFECT!  ~Thank you, Nan :)  Oh, PS, regarding "a lot of work" on some of the ratings...nah...just used food processor...took longer to get out the food processor and clean up the mess than it did to shred the carrots :)  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was delicious!  I loved the walnuts in it.  I ran out of oil and used only a little less than a cup, and it turned out fine.  It seems like it would've been too greasy with the recommended amount, I think another reviewer did the same thing.  Another thing about it was that it was SO EASY and QUICK!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but in light of all the high ratings, I will have try this again.  I do like a dense cake, so I followed the recipe as written instead of modifying it as others did, but it it turned out WAY WAY too dense, like a brick.  I baked it in loaf pans since the recipe appeared it was going to be dense.  It was oozing with oil when it came out of the oven, although it turned out a little less oily after cooling. The flavor was super and I love it loaded with carrot, so when I try it again, I will reduce the oil to half and not sub out the other half and drain off juice from the carrot mixture. The sweetness level was good, as I do not like desserts too sweet. I may even cut back one egg. Even when I make these modifications, I do not think this will turn out 'cake' like and will turn out more like carrot bread as it was with my original attempt.

This cake was a huge success - everyone loved it.  Great texture - moist and the perfect consistency.  As a matter of personal preference, I will add more spice the next time I bake (definitely more cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg).  I also did not drain the pineapple.  Rather than round cakes, I baked two 8X11 cakes, frosted with cream cheese frosting, and served as carrot bars.  Half the batch was gone in 6 hours!  Highly recommend this recipe.

Foolproof cake! I make this as a 9x13 cake, and top with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site. ALWAYS requested at family get-togethers by accomplished cooks who know a good carrot cake when they eat it! Have used pecans rather than walnuts with equal success. Thanks for making me shine!!

This was an excellent recipe, especially after letting the cake set up in the fridge overnight!  I used two 9-inch rounds, and the amount was perfect (some people have been saying this recipe makes a lot batter, maybe they used different pans).  Also, I used a little less than 1 C of white sugar instead of 1.5 C.  For the oil, I used 1/4 C instead of 1 C and substituted with 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce.  To make a not-too-sweet frosting, I used 16 oz. regular cream cheese, 4 tbs butter, 1 C confectioner's sugar, and 1.5 tsp vanilla extract.  Cake and frosting together make this a definite 5 star recipe!

Pretty good, I lost my ususal recipe so this was the first one I came across w/out baby food in it >:-P  It was pretty good, a little too dense and a little too moist, but I think that is just me, Everyone at work loved it. I don't know if I will use this recipe again, I think I will keep looking for something a little more cakey. I would reccomend trying it, since everyone else went nuts over it.

I really liked this cake with a good cream cheese icing recipe.  This recipe makes a lot of cake so you may want to cut the recipe in half.  I used the extra batter I had to make muffins. Mmmmmm.

I made this cake for a baby shower.  It was good and moist but has a very dense texture.

Excellent choice in cakes. I put a little less carrots and 3/4 cup raisens and used self-rising flour. The cake was very moist and very flaky, better than a pastry chef. I have found a winner. I also doubled the icing for my own preference. thanks nan

Good but something was a little off. I will try it again, but next time use more walnuts (use more and bigger pieces if you like chunky carrot cake) and more cinnamon which it absolutely needs. It needs to be served chilled - much better.  Carrot cake is my favorite dessert - so I've tried a lot - this one left us a little disappointed.. I don't think it lives up to its name but it's good and I will try again w/ those adjustments to fit my personal taste and see what happens.

I made this cake to bring to my parents' house, and impressed them with my first attempt!  Very good.  I might reduce the raisins a bit next time, though.

Oh my goodness. This is on my top ten dessert list! I used "baking raisins" instead of regular ones. Takes a long time to prepare the carrots but its worth every minute!

I'm not sure what the people who said it was too moist did wrong. This cake is abfab. Just the right texture and sweetness, tasted nothing like the Wawa kind. I followed the recipe to a tee, got nothing but raves, and will surely make this again in the future.

Hmm, how do you rate a recipe after making so many changes to it?  I thought it was wonderfully moist and flavorful, though I did follow some suggestions from other reviewers, mainly reducing the oil to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup applesauce.

This cake is delicious! I made it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out wonderful. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes and it was perfect. It is very moist and soooo good! Lots of compliments from friends. The worst part is shredding the carrots, but I used my food processor and the carrots were more like mush. I was afraid that would make a difference but it didnt!

Great recipe! Easy to make and very tasty.  I don't usually cook or bake anything, but this recipe was a success, even for me.

I don't like food that's too sweet, so I cut the amount of sugar in half, and the cake still tasted great.

Everyone can't stop talking about this carrot cake. I made it for my mother's birthday and she has had different friend's over for the last few days to try it because it is so good. I made a few changes here they are....
I used butter instead of oil, I stopped using oil in all my baking and it really makes a difference. 
I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. 
I added nutmeg and allspice to taste. 
I will definetelu make this recipe again.

This was an excellent recipe.  I had never made carrot cake before and I actually loved this with some homemade buttercream icing.  My neighbor loves carrot cake and I gave him this one and he said it was the best he had ever tasted.  Very moist and delicious and easy with a food processor.  Made 3 8 inch round cakes.

Fantastic - though I left out the pineapple & nuts as my kiddies don't like them, and added some extra raisins.  My picky toddler devoured entire cupcakes at a time! (I made a one layer cake and the rest cupcakes for the kids.) Very moist and tastey!

I think I will never so much as look at another carrot cake recipe EVER AGAIN. Great recipe, Nan!!! My whole family loved it... even better than store-bought. I used it with Janni's recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II (also from this site)- and it turned out PERFECT!!! I will definitely be making this over and over again... and I doubt that we will ever even BUY carrot cake from a bakery again, either. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

Mmmmm, very tasty. My arm feels like jell-o after grating all those carrots though. I substituted 2c macadamia nuts for the walnuts and it was delicious.

THIS RECIPE IS BEYOND 5 STARS!  I love the taste the combination of pineapple and carrots, so I've tried many other similiar recipes on this site and elsewhere, this is the BEST BY FAR!  I chose not to add nuts or the coconut, and it was a hit!  I think the key is to make sure you let the carrots really sit in the brown sugar for a good while.  This recipe is perfect.  Follow the instructions to a "T" and you won't go wrong!  If you like the tast of ginger, you could add a tsp or two of grated ginger.  Thanks for the best cake recipe ever NAN!  Roma..

This recipe is fantastic.  I drained the pineapple VERY well using paper towels to get out all of the juice.  I also used 3 8" cake pans and baked it for 30 minutes and it tested done with toothpick.  I used my Pampered Chef cheese grater since I don't own a food processor and it was easy to grate all of those carrots, saved my knuckles.  My first attempt at carrot cake, and I won't be searching for other recipes, this one is perfect, thanks!

Thanks for the best carrot cake.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I change was the baking pan.  I used a muffin pan (baked for 20 minutes)for individual servings and it came out great.

I have been using this recipe for about 2 years and have never been disappointed. I just made it again yesterday for my sister who was graduating. It was finished within 10 minutes. People have been offering to pay me to make it for them. They cannot believe how good it is. Others have asked for the recipe. I have baked the cake in 10" and 9x13" pans and it comes out great all the time. I have frosted it with a cream cheese frosting but I think it taste great just plain.It is by far one of the best carrot cakes that I have eaten and made.

I quadrupled this recipe with two minor adjustments(added a bit of nutmeg and reduced the sugar by 1/4cup) for a church reception and the reviews were glowing. Several people came asking for seconds and for the recipe. Definitely A+ in my books.

After reading the reviews and making this cake I was disappointed.  My expectations were probably too high.  Way too many carrots for me.  It was good but very dense.  I think it weighed 5 lbs.

The overall flavor of the cake was good,but i found it too be a bit dry.  I used a 13x9 oblong pan and by 30 minutes, it was a little bit overdone. I guess because i pre-heated oven for over an hour since i was baking other things prior to this cake.  Next time i will not strain the juice from pineapple and add it to batter maybe it will make the cake a little more moist. I made the whipped cream cheese frosting submitted from Tom in this web site, It was so wonderful that it made up for the cake's dryness. With a bit of changes this cake will be great.

Nice taste and incredibly moist.  I added nutmeg and subsituted apple sauce for 1/2 the oil.  I also use bread flour and put in pans for carrot loaves great muffins, too.  It seems best suited for loaf.  So moist you need not frost.

Great moist cake.I have made this cake 3 times in the past year.I use all 6 cups of carrots- not too moist- not too oily. I do not use the pineapple, raisins or nuts (nuts on frosting).I do add 1 cup coconut.  Grease pan well. I have used 3 9 inch rounds and also have done muffins. This cake tastes even beter the next day. I frost, freeze and eat it all month!  Cannot say enough about this great recipe!  Enjoy. Thanks Nan.

The name says it all. This truly was the best carrot cake I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out wonderfully. My father whose known as the "dessert king" was in heaven. Great recipe.

This cake is wonderful!  I made it last night and used the Awseome Carrot Cake Cream Cheese Frosting.  Made a wonderful combination because the frosting is light and not too sweet and the cake is sweet and slightly spicy and very moist!  I will make this cake again!

Great recipe - although I made it healthier by subsituting honey for all the sugar and also used whole wheat pastry flour. My wife was sceptical about me changing the specs but she loved it.

I thought this cake was too heavy, but my family and friends love it.  I made it for Thanksgiving and they really rave and rave about how good it was.  They were so disappointed that I did not make it for Christmas.  As I said earlier, I really thought it was heavy, but since they really enjoyed it -- I would give it a 10.

I loved how moist and delicious the cake came out. I made half the recipe and baked it in a bundt pan. I didn't even add frosting. It was perfect.

This is awesome!  Very rich and filling, so it serves a lot of people.  Had one request to make this for someone instead of giving them a Christmas present!*Update* I had someone ask me to make this again.  His wife said he had not stopped talking about it in 3 years!

I've made this recipe so many times and each time it turned out just perfect!  This last time there wasn't any pineapple around (applesauce makes a pretty good substitute too), so I just left it out and increased the oil by about 2 tbsp - it's a bit moist but soooooooo tasty!  I also use only half the brown sugar to soak the carrot.  Thanks Nan.

Fabulous carrot cake!  The nuts were omitted due to a family nut allergy, and it still turned out perfectly.  It was very moist and dense, and went perfectly with the allspice cream cheese frosting from this site.  I think perhaps the next time, I would use half oil and half unsweetened applesauce to reduce the fat, but hey, it was Thanksgiving, and calories don't count during the holidays!

I made this cake as one of my boyfriends b-day cakes at our recent garden party. We had about 25 people who gave it rave reviews. One man claimed he doesn't eat carrot cake but THIS TIME. . . The recipe was also requested by others. It did look as delicious as well. It wasn't TOO moist, which is good. I chose this one for the two round cake layers that produces but used the cream cheese frosting recipe by Tracy Kirk but added pistachios instead of pecans - the hints of green and taste worked out well. This is a keeper!

I made this cake for my husband on Father's Day. Carrot cake has always been his favorite, but I have never found a recipe that he was crazy about. I thought I'd take a chance with this recipe and I am glad I did. He said it was the best he ever tasted. I loved it, too and carrot cake was never one of my favorites. This cake is so moist and flavorful, but not heavy. Thanks Nan for a fantastic recipe. I will be making it again.

This is a good carrot cake recipe. The pineapples make it very special. You just need to use a cream cheese frosting too.

This is a very tasty recipe. I made two mistakes and it still turned out very well! I added my entire can of pineapple without measuring first (14 oz!) and baked the entire recipe in an angelfood cake pan. It took 3 hours to bake!! I will not do that again! It is still a bit moist (my own fault!). I made it with the Allspice Cream Cheese frosting and it tastes divine!

Wow, what a cake!  I had never tried making a carrot cake before, and this was perfect!  I grated the carrots by hand, which I think is fun to do, and I baked this in three 9 inch pans so I could take one to work. The ladies in my office think I am "the best baker that has ever lived", and they all must have the recipe.  I took the advise of another reviewer and used 5 cups of carrots and a bit of nutmeg. I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe from Janni.

I was craving carrot cake and decided to try this recipe.  I cut the white sugar by 1/3 and used half applesauce and half oil.  I added a little allspice, nutmeg, and ginger.  I wish I had added more spices, it is not as spicy and flavorful as I hoped.  This cake is indisputably best served room temperature.  (I made cupcakes and tried them hot, cold, and room temp.)  I think "Best Ever" is a bold claim as I don't think there is anything particularly unusual or unique about the recipe, but it is a nice, moist cake.

This carrot cake would have been much better if it were a little less moist...  i suggest draining the carrots first before adding to the brown sugar.

This is the same exact recipe as my grandmother's delicious carrot cake- I'm not big on carrot cake, but this one is soooooo good, especially the frosting!

Well, thanks to this recipe, my jeans are feeling a bit snug today, but oh well, the taste of this cake far surpasses my feeling of dread of gaining a pound or two!  This cake is amazing.  I agree about the time involved with shredding carrots, but it is ever worth it-the end results are incredible.  I ended up with 3 9 inch layers for this cake and iced it with the Allspice Cream Cheese frosting recipe on this site.  It was just so awesome, I can't get over it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've been making carrot cake for years with a recipe that my family loves. This one sounded so good I just had to try it, despite my husband's protestations. I'm so glad I did! It's so wonderfully moist and delicious and makes a huge cake and is by far the BEST carrot cake I've tried. and my family LOVED it!.....3rd time around I left out the raisins and it was just as good!

I am a professional taster when it comes to carrot cakes.  I have tried a few recipes that were very good, but this one tops all of them by far.  Not only is it easier to make,and tastier, but it also has an authentic taste.
The only change I have made is putting half the pineapple requested to make it the original flavor yet to still provide the moistness.

This is a very moist and flavorful cake. It tends to be rather rich and large for a smaller crowd, so I suggest it for more company (10 or more) or as a dessert for a potluck. It's sure to go over very well and there will be plenty of people to eat it up. Also, make sure you get baking raisins (regular Sunmaid raisins will do) as natural raisins absorb too much of the moisture and overtake the flavor of the cake.

This cake is a lot of work but worth every minute.  This is the only carrot cake I will make from now on.  I use the All Spice Cream Cheese Frosting on it.

I one and a halfed this cake for a Women's Club Meeting.  It made one sheet cake and a 9x9 square cake (I added a few more spices and after baking topped it with Cream Cheese icing).  The only thing difficult about this recipe is that the carrot shredding is time consuming.  I used a mini processor that I have and it cut the time considerably.  It was a hit at the meeting and several wanted the recipe.  It is very moist and the pineapple really makes it yummy!  Well worth the effort.

I tried this recipe with a few small additions for my sister-in-law's birthday and at first bite I heard comments such as "Oh my word this cake is good", and "this cake is absolutely divine".  I had many requests for the recipe and for a repeat of the cake on other birthdays.  It is a wonderful cake and one I am sure will now be at many, if not all, future family gatherings.  The additions I made to the recipe are:  the zest of one orange, 1/2 tsp. of ginger and 1/4 tsp. of cloves.

This receipe is great! I never knew making a carrot cake is so easy! I've never been good at cake-making but I find this recipe so easy to make. It was a little time-consuming to grate  6 cups of carrots but it's worth it as the cake tastes so yummy!!

This is a great recipe! I used an 11” springform pan, and the recipe as written (16 servings), was the perfect amount for that size pan. I took the recommendations of others, and soaked my raisins in the pineapple juice, left over from draining a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple. That made the raisins plump and moist. I drained the carrots and brown sugar mixture prior to adding the carrots to the batter, and that probably eliminated another cup of liquid. I added the extra spices recommended by others (1/4 tsp of allspice, nutmeg, cloves and ginger). I doubled the vanilla, which was also suggested. I added a tsp of baking powder. I cut down on the oil by 1/4 c. 
I lined the springform pan with parchment paper, and baked the cake in a 350 degree convection oven for 30 min, then dropped the temp to 335 for the last 25 min. 
I decorated the cream cheese frosting by dying some leftover frosting orange and green for ‘carrots’. It easily makes 16 good sized pieces of moist, flavorful carrot cake. I’ll make this again. It’s a big cake tho, so make sure you have a lot of hungry guests!

I think this a great recipe and I did not have the problems with sogginess that some other reviewers mentioned (I drained the pineapple well but did not drain the carrot liquid). However, I wondered if there was a typo when it said that all that batter should fit into two 10" cake pans. After filling my two 10" pans as full as I dared, I still hade enough batter left over to make 9 cupcakes. Putting less batter in the pans affects the cooking time - I found my ten cupcakes were done to perfection in 20 minutes and the 2 round pans took about 30 minutes.   I would say THREE 10" pans with an appropriate adjustment to the cooking time would be perfect.

This was the first time making this recipe and it was followed exactly.  I found that it had too much oil - the cake was too "wet" yet crumbly, and when I was putting the frosting on top, the top cake layer just peeled off as I spread the cream cheese frosting.  I also think there is too much "stuff" in the cake and not enough batter for it to solidify.  Carrots, raisins, pineapple nuts, etc..... just too much.   I would take out at least 2 cups of carrots and cut the oil in half.  There is enough moisture from the pineapple.  You don't need all that oil.  It tasted good, but I did not like the consistency of the actual cake.

This really is the Best Carrot Cake Ever!  The only things I did differently were:  I added 3/4  cup of coconut with the pineapple, substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts, made three eight-inch cakes which I piledhigh with cream cheese frosting!  Just delicious.

I made a couple changes and this cake was a hit for my daughter's birthday.  I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup and cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup (not TO 1/4 cup). I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe. Very moist, very heavy cake. I suggest letting it sit overnight before frosting it. This recipe also makes for a great breakfast muffin.

I’ve always wanted to make a carrot cake from scratch, so I finally searched a recipe and did it.  This is one of the best carrot cakes I’ve ever had!  I absolutely hate raisins, and wanted something the kids would eat, so I eliminated the raisins and nuts.  With just the “basic” ingredients, this cake turned out amazing!  Didn’t have round pans so I made it in a 9x13 glass dish for 45 minutes.  Couldn’t be happier and now I have finally made my own real carrot cake!

This recipe is Amazing! I always substitute applesauce for the oil and put the raisins in the carrot mixture to hydrate. I’ve made it so many times! This time I looked through the reviews to get the cook time for a 9x13 and decided to add more spices. 1 tsp nutmeg, allspice, ginger, cloves, and 2x vanilla was a great addition. Everyone loves this, even none carrot cake lovers! FYI I used 2lb of carrots & 20oz of crushed pineapple, well drained.

Best carrot cake ever is right! I've made this many times, as a triple layer 9 inch cake and as a 10 x 14 sheet cake. I add the nuts to the carrots, brown sugar and raisins. I also add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and ginger, 1 teaspoon nutmeg. Everyone loves this cake.

I’ve made this twice now for the nurses at work and they love it! I don’t know how many copies of the recipe I’ve handed out. Thanks for a great recipe. I did have to cook it for almost 60 minutes in my oven but the toothpick test was spot on!

I love this carrot cake. It is nearly the perfect carrot cake for me and the perfect carrot cake for my husband. The amount of everything is just right. It’s not too sweet and not too oily. If I were to change anything, I think I would add a little nutmeg to add a bit of spice to the cake.

This cake has become my family's favorite cake. I followed thr recipe exactly as given.  The next time I make it which will be for Christmas  it was suggested that I  add a little rum to the raisins. Will this change the taste of this cake dramatically.  I  love love love this cake.

I made this cake twice this weekend, once as written, and then again with my changes. I gave it three stars because it was good, but very dense and didn't rise very much. It sounds crazy, but I thought it had too many carrots. When I reduced the carrots to 4 cups and added 1.5 tsp of baking powder, it was fluffier and rose significantly higher. It still had plenty of carrots with only 4 cups of finely shredded carrots.

A relatively easy recipe and I had great results.  I followed the advice from a few of the reviews to reduce the sugar and also to mix in the raisins with the grated carrot and sugar which helped plump up the raisins which worked very well.  (I might try a different variation next time as suggested by one of the reviewers to soak the raisins in a bit of rum.)  It is a very rich cake, so I managed to get 18 servings from this recipe.

This was the 1st carrot cake I have made. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it !!  This is a keeper and my daughters have already asked for the recipe.

 I looked at the notes and decided to drain the juice from the carrot and brown sugar as suggested. I didn't squeeze the juice out just drained it. I also drained the juice from the pineapple as the direction.  It was perfectly moist !

I made this cake for the first time and people loved it. It does come out quite moist but that’s precisely what I was complimented on. Mine was not soggy and I think it was because I cooked it at a very low temp and that helped it bake to perfection. Highly recommended recipe for a large crowd but if you are looking to make something smaller, cut the recipe in half.

I highly recommend this recipe! The cake was sweet, moist and delicious. However, I did a few things differently. After shredding the carrots, I squeezed out the excess water but next time I’ll skip this step because I heard the excess water makes for a moister cake. I used golden raisins and mixed it with 1 tablespoon of flour (so they wouldn’t sink to the bottom of the cake, while it baked). I used two 9-inch cake pans, which resulted in 2-layer cake and made my own frosting. For the frosting, you’ll need butter (1 stick/8 tablespoons), cream cheese (8oz), powdered sugar (4 cups), and vanilla extract (2 teaspoons). Make sure the butter and cream cheese are both at room temperate.In a medium size bowl, mix the butter and cream cheese. Personally, I recommend holding off using a hand-mixer until everything is combined because you’ll have a mess on account of the excess air from the hand-mixer. In its place, I recommend using a baking spatula or big spoon. Once the butter and cream cheese are mixed, add in 2 cups of powdered sugar followed by 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Once properly combined, add the remaining powdered sugar and vanilla. After all the ingredients have been combined (using a spatula or spoon), feel free to use the hand-mixer until everything is fully mixed and the frosting is smooth. Make sure when you frost the cake it’s cool and the frosting is at room temperature.In all, I highly recommend this recipe and everyone who ate it, LOVED IT!!!!!!!

After reading it made a lot I did the resize for 6. DON'T do that! The cake is the best carrot cake ever!  I did, however, make a couple of switches and changes. I used stevia instead of sugar and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Instead of cream cheese icing, I took philly cream cheese (2) and mixed a bit of whipped cream, making it more an almost like a cheesecake icing. Served with leftover crushed pineapple (leftover from the can) and a few dried cranberries on top. Huge it!

Made the recipe exactly as said, turned out wonderful! Even people that don’t normally eat cake after taking a bite still ate more!! I made it with cream cheese icing and it was delicious.  But I feel it’s such a moist and hardy cake with all it’s carrots, pineapple and nuts you could serve it with out icing as a snack! It’s that flavorful! I feel the only extra step would be storage, I would cut up the cake and individually wrap each piece tightly with plastic wrap to store.

I made this for my husband's birthday. It was a big it. It was absolutely delicious. I went exactly by the recipe with one exception. I baked in a 9x13 pan and increased cooking time to 1 hour. I then iced with home-made cream cheese icing. I will definitely make this again. It was perfect and lives up to it's name.

This is the first time I have made a carrot cake from scratch and it’s the only way I will make it from now on. The cake came out moist and delicious, the cake is a bit heavy so I will try to drain the pineapple better next time and maybe press the grated carrots to try and get a bit of the excess moisture from them as well. Next time a different frosting recipe maybe I didn’t like how the one I made this time piped it didn’t hold a rose well but it all tastes terrific. Happy baking all.

My dad loves this cake I make it every year for his birthday.
I put coconut oil, instead of veggie oil, and add an egg.

Based on the reviews I figured I would give this a try for my husbands birthday. Followed the the recipe with only one change did not use oil used apple sauce and melted butter in place for required amt of oil. Used 10” round pan as stated, oh my goodness WAY to thin each layer only 1” thick in my opinion to thin had to add a 3rd layer. Perhaps some baking powder would help! I will give this one more try but will add baking powder.

I made it in a rectangular tin, no frosting for a Mothers'day event at Church. Was moist and delicious. Everyone enjoyed it. Will be making it again this weekend. Good recipe, easy to follow. Thanks.

Moist, delicious, very dense. I'm not a big pineapple fan so I was hesitant about this recipe, but you dont actually TASTE pineapple, it just adds some sweetness and moisture! 

I did add ginger and cloves and almond extract to the recipe because I like those flavors, but I'm sure it would still be great just as written!

Did follow suggestions and used applesauce for half the oil.  Also strained the carrots in cheesecloth before adding to brown sugar. Did not add any of the strained juice back in as a few recipes stated how wet it was. Used a buttter, cream cheese, and confectionary sugar recipe as this has richer flavor than just cream cheese and sugar ones. Excellent.

Pretty good and standard ingredient list. Flip flopped the sugars for taste.  Adj oil and pineapple, again for taste.

Best carrot cake ever indeed. Made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit. My wife, who makes her own recipe carrot cake, said it was delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the raisins and substituted some tossed coconut. Made a three layer cake with classic cream cheese frosting. Yum!

After carefully reading notes and gathering what to do (and not do), I went for it- and succeeded!  Like others- I did tweak it minimally. 1) I used golden raisins, and soaked them in warm spiced rum for the hour that the carrots/brown sugar were set aside in the first step. 2) I strained the carrot/sugar mix and reserved the “juice” and added to the batter as needed (I think I only ended up using about 1/3 to 1/2 of it in the recipe), and yes- DRAIN the pineapple! 3) I almost overheat the eggs just to the point of being thick and creamy, then stirred in the other ingredients. 4) I used 2 floured 8” cake pans and put the extra batter in cupcake forms, after the cakes cooled, I did use a simple syrup coat prior to icing the cake (Cream Cheese Frosting II- I added cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract). I went out on a limb and took it to work for about 20 co-workers- they ALL gave their thumbs up!

I made this recipe for my nephews wedding. It was very moist and flavorful. I got so many compliments and request for the recipe.
The cake also had layers of chocolate, vanilla and red velvet. We ran out of the carrot cake portion of the cake. I highly recommend this recipe.

It is truly delicious carrot cake. And I don’t mind the heavy consistency that some on here said others complained about. I do think that it is a bit too sweet for me once I add sweet sweet cream cheese frosting; I got my frosting recipe from a different site and it along with this cake was just TOO sweet. I may look for a less sweet cream cheese frosting next time I make this carrot cake.

This is the 4th & 5th time making this cake.  This time For a double shower — so I made made it in two 9x13” pans — to make two layers...twice!  About 30 minutes baking at 325 degrees.  That was lots of carrot grating and measuring and mixing and baking x 2.  It was, as usual, a total hit.  Folks even asked for seconds AND/OR to take home a piece for their spouse.  Heavy is what makes a perfect carrot cake to me.  I always add the raisins about 20minutes into the brown sugar soak.  And I never drain the carrots.  PERFECT with cream cheese frosting II.  Sorry, I added the baby shower Beach Boy picture twice.  See the bridal shower cake in the cream cheese frosting II review (also added it twice there!  Expected it to show within the review)...

I omitted the raisins and walnuts because I don't like them in my baked goods. I omitted the oil and used unsweetened applesauce and instead of white sugar I used a cane sugar and brown sugar. 

I also made it in a bundt pan. It came out moist and delicious.

I have made this Carrot Cake numerous times. Once I made it and entered it in the local county fair and won a blue ribbon. Then I made it and took it to a group meeting and served it for  desert. And got a lot of compliments from the members.

They got the name of this recipe right... it is the best carrot cake that I have ever made or tasted. I multiplied the recipe by half again, as I was cooking for a larger group and it turned out perfectly. I made a simple cream cheese icing for it and served it still warm from the oven. This is definitely my carrot cake recipe from here on.

I made this cake according to the recipe which is hard for me because I’m a creative cook.  Ok so I added some coconut flakes but not sure it really added to the flavor.   The only thing that went wrong was that I baked it -a little too long.   It was a little dry which is the worst thing.   After a day or two it did moisten up.   Next time I will check the cake earlier while baking in oven.   I will also add some pumpkin spices and or some ginger to experiment.   This is a great recipe!

I followed someones else's direction and drained the juice away from the carrot/sugar mixture then added 2 tablespoons of the juice back to the entire mixture until I thought it was the right consistency for Carrot Cake.  I substituted the Cinnamon for Allspice because I wanted the clove zing.  I also cooked it in three different containers; xsmall muffins, small muffins, and a tray that has 6 small loafs (purchased in Walmart baking section). Adjusted the time accordingly. 20min for the first xsmall batch, 40 for the  small muffins, and 45 for the loaves.  It came out wonderful.  I set my food processor on a regular grating size because I like the carrots to be very visible. :-)  Hope you enjoy.

This cake did not last very long in my household, lol. It was rich, moist and yummy. I used pecan pieces, and cocunut flakes, the whole shebang and it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again!

I spent 3 hrs on this. And the cake sucks. Too much sugar. Too much cinnamon. “Best ever,” no. It’s going in the garbage.

this cake is so moist and the flavor is out of this world. I made this cake for my husbands birthday and also my brothers birthday. So now I am going to make it again today for the super bowl game, this time I am going to make cupcakes, easier for a bigger crowd.

This cake was a disappointment. Decided to try a different carrot cake than my tried-and-true usual carrot cake recipe for my husbands birthday. Followed the recipe to a T and it was so dense and over- moist it was just way too heavy. What a disappointment. I was glad it was just for a family gathering and not a potluck! It was so over- moist, I had to bake for way longer then the recipe to just get it done. I am an avid cook and baker, try new recipes all the time, but this one was totally not a winner in my book.

I love this recipe, it was dense and moist and you could taste every ingredient separately but mingled as well. The only changes I made was to add one cup of shredded coconut, and I use dried cranberries which I soaked ahead of time rather than raisins, but raisins are great too. I appreciated reading many of the reviews and I did crush half of the pineapple and left the other half in chunks, it was great!

I went with this recipe because there were so many good reviews and it was the best decision ever!  This is easy to make, flavorful, moist and with 6c of carrots has to be a good way to sneak in fiber.  I  made per the recipe no changes but I did make 2 loaves and served the frosting on the side.  Everyone loved it, I will be using this recipe again and again!

Thanks Nan, for providing this recipe!
I made this cake following your video instructions.
I modified it by adding a pinch of orange zest to the frosting and to the mixture  as well as one capful of  Myer's original dark rum to the carrots and raisins mixture.  Drained before adding to the dry mix.
Cake was moist and delicious .

This cake turned out great.  The best advice in the comments and very important is to press out the excess moisture from the carrots.  The cake is pretty big so if you like lots of icing, increase the recipe 50-100%

Such a yummy recipe, well worth the time! I soak the raisins and nuts overnight in water, then drain them before adding to the recipe. Makes the cake nice and moist.

It was a hit at my job’s Christmas party! The only change I made was to use a bundt pan. It took an additional 10-12 minutes, my bundt pan is heavier than regular cake pan. There was frosting left because I only drizzled it on, but it can be used for cupcakes!

Served this at a dinner party.  Super moist and delicious.  I omitted the walnuts due to a nut allergy, however it was still so yummy!  Had my friends calling me today asking for the recipe.  I didn't change a thing.

If you follow the directions precisely you will have wonderfully dense, moist but not soggy carrot cake! Mixing the brown sugar with the carrots is a great way to draw out the moisture in the carrots. Once it has sat the allotted hour, strain or use a slotted spoon - don’t just dump it all in. Also be sure to drain the pineapples very well.  My husband is SUPER picky about his birthday carrot cake and gave this rave reviews.

I doubled the recipe and cut back to 1/2 the white sugar, and made two 9”x11” cakes without icing.  I froze one and the second one was gobbled down by the 4 adults living in my house by the second day.
It was moist and chocked full of healthy good components. Everyone commented on how it was so nutritious it was like a healthy meal within its self.

I use the precut matchstick carrots... it is not as wet.  Go by the weight of the bag vs the weight of 6 carrots. I do not strain the juce from the pineapple, and cut the oil down to 3/4 cup (1/2 cup veg oil and 1/4 cup hemp oil). Hemp oil adds omegas 3, 6 and 9. don't use too much or it will taste like a fresh cut lawn.
Pecans taste better in it than walnuts.  >personal opinion.

I have made this cake numerous times with great results.  It is routinely the hit of the party.   If there enough people to eat it,  I always take home an empty plate.  It is a very hardy cake, so it feeds lots of people! It truly is the best carrot cake ever!

I've made this recipe many times.  Do not drain the carrot and brown sugar mixture to avoid getting a dry cake.  Be sure to drain the crushed pineapple well, used canned pineapple.  I cut the amount of cinnamon by 1 tsp and add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp allspice.  I also substituted raisins with craisins.  Regardless of these changes, this is a great recipe just the way it is.

I'm not a huge fan of the walnuts so I dropped those, and sometimes drop raisins as well, but it's still a delicious cake!

I made this and EVERYONE loved it! I did strain the pinapple and pressed most moisture out of the pinapple and carrots.  
I added ratios of 1/3 of Ginger and 1/4 of nutmeg to the cinnamon and it tasted like fall in your mouth! (Thats 1 and 1/3 tsp ginger and 1 tsp nutmeg ) you can totally customize ratios to your own individualized palette. 
I will make this again soon!

I made this cake many times both as directed and more diabetic friendly by substituting the white and brown sugars for 3/4 cups  truvia cane sugar blend and  1/2 cup brown sugar blend and adding 1 1/4 cups non fat dry milk to replace the missing volume of sugars. It was moist and delicious both ways

I have been making this cake regularly for years now.  It is amazing as written. I get asked to bring this cake to every function, and am always asked for the recipe!  I have never modified the ingredients, just one of the steps.  I toss the raisins in with the brown sugar and carrots and let them sit for the hour.  I have never been disappointed by this cake, and have actually been told I’ve ruined someone’s go to carrot cake at the local bakery by introducing them to this one.

Oh My, YES!! My husband loves carrot cake.  We have tried so many recipes and none have been worth repeating.  This recipe is pretty involved, meaning it does take a while to put together (being organized and doing one step at a time will help). It’s also a large and dense cake. All that being said, it will be soooo worth it if you love a good carrot cake. THIS IS IT, LOOK NO FURTHER. We are not big cinnamon fans so I used a third of the amount in the recipe, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, black pepper, cardamom and ginger. Other than that any other alterations I made were mostly insignificant. As far as the cream cheese frosting, I combined 3 different recipes from this site.  I want this frosting to taste a bit more like cream cheese than a mouth full of sugar.  Mine came out kind of thin and had to keep frosted cake in fridge but the flavor was perfect for our taste (I’m willing to give up the perfect look for the perfect taste). My alterations were adding both lemon juice and plain Greek yogurt to 8oz cream cheese and powdered sugar.

I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour, but I believe it would have been just as delicious...and I omitted the pineapple.

I love this recipe. I would not change a thing. What I like most about it is that is works will with self rising flour. Also you can add anything you that you like to it such a raisins, pineapple etc. 
What I would change thou is the frosting, I would use 2 - 8 oz packs of cream cheese frosting 1/2 cups butter , 2 cups of confectioners sugar and 2 tsp of Vanilla extracts, Dash of lime or lemon (optional). I like a cream cheese frosting that I can actually taste the cream cheese. 
Happy Baking !!!

Best carrot cake ever.  Has anyone tried to make this cake as gluten free?  I tried substituting the flour  for almond and coconut flour, but it fell apart, I need to tweak it a little more.  Any suggestions?

First time making homemade carrot cake and it was good. We weren't a fan of the raisins. I substituted applesauce for the oil so it might have been why the cake was on the heavy side. You can't see or taste the pineapple. I didn't read the recipe directions fully before I picked it so make sure you account for the hour of time you need to wilt the carrots.  : )

This is a delicious cake. I’m glad I read the reviews though, because this is a very moist cake even with straining the carrots and pineapple. I used golden raisins instead of regular raisins, because I think they taste so much better. I was going to leave it naked, because I don’t think it even needs icing. It’s delicious as is. The guys in my house wanted cream cheese icing though so I obliged. Super tasty cake. Bravo

This was my second attempt ever at baking a carrot cake. The first time I broke my hand mixer so what does that tell you about that recipe. I was excited to make this recipe for my husband's birthday.  It is a little time consuming, however, the outcome was well worth the effort. I also used cheesecloth to get rid of the excess water from the carrots, and soaked my carrots, brown sugar and raisins together for the 60+ minutes. I also cut the recipe in half - for a family of four it was the perfect size. I baked it in two 8" round pans.  I made my own cream cheese icing, which was the perfect complement. The cake was moist without being overly moist and not as dense or heavy as other carrot cakes I have had. This was the perfect density!

It was good tasting, but more dense/moist than I was looking for. I wanted a light/fluffy consistency like boxed cake, but homemade.

I left out walnuts but left the recipe as it was. The cake was delicious and because it was such a large cake, I shared it with everyone in my building. They said they want more and asked for my recipe!

Everyone loved it but it wasn't sweet and spicy enough for me.  That may have been because I increased the amount of carrots and fruit so the spices and sugars weren't right.  It needs more careful measuring.

Straining the carrot mixture made all the difference where the batter wasn't overly wet and baked up nicely.

I made this a few months ago...friends I made it for said it really was the best carrot cake ever!  Changes I made to the recipe based on other's reviews were:  hydrated raisins in warm water for 45 mins. before adding; used fresh carrots and diced in mini bullet, rather than having extra moisture from canned carrots; reduced the 1 cup veg oil to 1/2 -- believe me it was still plenty moist!  Lastly, I added a dash of nutmeg, ginger and allspice (one reviewer specified 1/4 tsp of each; omitted walnuts as we do not care for them -- no one missed them!  Also baked this in a 9x13 pan and it came out perfect!  Getting ready to bake again next week!

This is my "go-to" carrot cake and my family adores it.  Nan outdid herself with this one.  I'm one that doesn't like changing recipes and then rating it.  However,  I will say that I always make only one change to this recipe.  I do not care for raisins, so I replace with a cup of dates.   For those who are fans of raisins, I'm sure it's just as perfect!   Non raisin fans, try out dates, you'll be pleasantly surprised. 
This recipe is the absolute best, in our opinion.  It is a wonderfully dense cake that holds up well to a nice thick cream cheese icing of your choice. Don't be afraid of the amount of oil, it makes the cake!

Awesome carrot cake recipe! Made this for a surprise party, the only change i made was doubling  the recipe to make a half-sheet cake. it was moist and flavorful. Everyone raved about this cake, even had people who don't like carrot cake tell me they loved it. Keeper!

This cake is super delicious. Everyone loves it. Dense and flavorful, but still very moist. 
I strained the carrots before adding them to the mixture and the cake still turned out incredibly moist. 
I used 5tsp of cinnamon rather than 4.

This was a seriously good cake! The shredded carrot brown sugar mixture lets out a lot of liquid, be forewarned. I added the carrots and enough liquid to thin out the batter into pouring consistency. Other than that, I didn't change a thing. It was perfect.

I read Crystallaurey's review (under the most helpful positive review) and followed her suggestions.  Because I didn't leave enough time to soak the carrots for 60 minutes, I mixed w/ the brown sugar as directed and heated them in the microwave for a minute or so (not to cook but to simulate the effect of time).  Also used frozen cut pineapple and let it  defrost.  I strained the carrots and pineapple after about 10 minutes at room temp and then cooked the raisins in the liquid and drained it off, reserving it.  Then I followed the recipe (I did cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and did half white and half brown) and added 2 TBSP of the reserved liquid to make the batter looser.    I also followed the suggestion to make a three layer cake--I used 9 inch pans as I didn't have 8 inch ones.  The cakes baked in less than 1/2 hour at 375 (my oven is exceptionally slow so I had to bump up the temp).  The cakes were perfectly moist but not overly so and unbelievably delicious.  I will make this again no doubt.   I made my own cream cheese frosting but be sure to double the amount because the layers and the outside deserve adequate frosting!!

I am a sous chef. I've made it. Without Pineapple, Carrots crushed in the mixer with brown sugar, cinnamon, pine nuts (optionally), walnuts, and most of all OIL. Yes, I thought it would be Better if I had carrots mixed with oil directly. And it was so :) Try to believe. 5 stars recipe .

I followed the recipe exactly minus the vanilla because I completely forgot - it still turned out very good. This is personal preference but I think next time I'd reduce the raisins to half cup because there seemed to be too many, but otherwise the recipe was great and everyone loved it. It was even better the next day!!

I've made this cake a few times now without changing the recipe at all. Today, I made cupcakes for the first time, though, and found it to be too oily. Next time I will use half the oil and replace with apple sauce. When making the cake, I leave the recipe as is. And grating all those carrots by hand is not THAT much of a chore. Someone complained about six cups being too much and to use an appliance to do the job. Pfft.

Awesome recipe! Except for not adding raisins, it appears to look very delicious! I used Chef John's cream cheese frosting, only thing was I couldn't get the frosting to stiffen up more....I had already used nearly 3 cups of powdered sugar and I didn't want the sweetness to overcome the cream cheese & lemon flavor, next time I'll have to look up a different cream cheese frosting recipe. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure that my family and friends will enjoy the cake!

This IS the BEST carrot cake ever!!! I drained the pineapples as directed. At first it does seem very wet, but it cooks well and is a very moist great tasting recipe. We made a half recipe because it seemed like it would make to much for us. We also baked them as cupcakes/muffins for 25 minutes. Each cupcake/muffin is only 140 calories and half a batch made 18. 
They are awesome for dessert or a snack, whenever you need something sweet but not too sweet. I love that it has carrots, pineapples and raisins. This makes it a little more healthy than your average snack cake.

This is literally the best carrot cake ever. I was a little intimidated with the amount of carrots it calls for but man o man I am glad I followed the recipe. It does make a lot of cake so have the right amount of pans ready. This recipe is amazing, make it and you won't be disappointed. Goes great with cream cheese frosting.

I've made this cake for years and everyone raves about it whenever I serve it.
I follow the recipe with the exception of replacing the eggs with egg replacer and the oil with applesauce as my family is plant-based and we don't use oil.  I use a vegan cream cheese icing recipe.
I made it yesterday and used two 8" pans and made 8 muffins too.
Once again it was delicious

I don't know what i did i followed the instructions accordingly, my cake came out wet even though i let it stay in oven more time than was allotted on recipe.  Maybe i will try again, the frosting was fantastic.

This cake is really delicious, moist and full of flavor. I used about 5cups of grated carrots instead of 6 but it was still enough. I did not use raisins as the family does not care for them. I would make this again for sure!

This cake has a great flavor. I was a little thrown by the pineapple, but it helped give a moistness and bring out the flavor. However, next time I will chop them up a bit more to avoid having chunks of it in my cake, but it was alright. I also added vanilla pudding to the mix that made it EXTRA moist... So delicious! I haven't had a carrot cake that good since grandma. I'll definitely make this again and next time I'll take pictures. I made this with Janni's recipe, Cream Cheese Frosting II, found on Allrecipes.

I made this cake with 3/4 cup oil, one cup white sugar, 5 cups grated carrots and baked for 70 minutes. Even after a week the cake is still delicious!! Make sure you dry the carrots and esp the pineapple (I dried them with paper towels). And when you test if the cake is done test it in the middle of the cake as the outside bakes fastest and might be done but the inside still soggy (this happened to me first, but then I baked the cake for a second time (same cake) and it turned out perfectly even after baking twice.

So excited to make my first carrot cake with this recipe.  Only changes I made was that I eliminated the pineapple (allergy) and I added allspice and ginger with the cinnamon .  Also, after leaving the carrot and brown sugar sit for an hour there was a large amount of liquid in the bottom of the bowl. I added only just enough of that liquid in the last step to make the batter seem correct.  It yielded 12 cupcakes a deep 9inch cake and a think 9 inch .  I hope it will freeze well.

Good recipe! I'm not a good bake myself so when I saw the amount of fluid in the carrot bowl after adding in the brown sugar I was a little shocked. Read through all the reviews and found the best way to avoid it being too moist is to scoop up only the carrots (after soaking for an hour) into the bater. Just discard the brown sugar-water briefly, and add about 3-4tbsps of those back into the bater. 2)added a pinch of nutmeg. 3) soaked raisin with squeezed pineaple juice for 45min 4)lastly i took the advice from some reviews to only use 1/2 cup of oil and replace another 1/2 with butter.

This is a simple and great recipe. This is my first carrot cake and it came out amazing. I reduced the white sugar due to personal preference but the recipe itself is great as it is. For us its a massive cake though! and I personally would half the overall quantity in the next one.

Loved the recipe. I did drain the carrots and brown sugar and it was perfect. We didn't add raisins since no one here likes them. We followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was delicious and not too moist.

I made this cake for Father's Day.  It was a hit.  I did make adjustments to the recipe as some had suggested. The carrots soaked in the brown sugar for more than an hour so I did drain and press out the liquid to prevent the cake from being soggy.  I also used half apple sauce in place of  half  of the vegetable oil. The cake is very heavy and rich.  I made homemade cream cheese icing and then decorated the cake with a fondant Father's Day design.  I rolled the fondant extremely thin so it practically melted into the icing.  It is so delicious!!

Everyone who ate these cupcakes loved them! Also many of them asked me for the recipe. Best carrot cake they ever had, they said. I only made three minor changes. I mixed the raisins into the carrots and brown sugar to sit for the 60 minutes. This plumps the raisins by absorbing some of that juice being made. I squeezed the juice out of the can of crushed pineapple, not just drained it. I poured the batter into cupcake pans with paper liners and baked 18 to 20 minutes. I put cream cheese frosting on half of them and caramel sauce on the other half. Before putting the toppings on I put half of the cupcakes in Foodsaver bags  and put them in the freezer. They were in the freezer for three weeks when I took them out and used them. They were as fresh as the day I made them. Very very happy with that!

This is a perfect carrot cake...the only change I made was to add a bit more oil, vanilla, and a cup of sweetened coconut. I used a food processor for all the grating & chopping, so it was a cinch!  Thanks for the recipe--I had lost mine in a move last year--groan!!

I made a few changes. I substituted Stevia brown sugar for regular brown sugar and I left the orange juice out of the frosting recipe. I also baked in two cake pans. The cake came out moist and light and flavorful--not too sweet, which I prefer. Frosting is yummy. I froze one cake (unfrosted) for later and added ground walnuts on top. Love it!

I am 13 years old and I love baking, although this was my first attempt on carrot cake. The taste was definitely delicious ( moist, flavourful and mouthwatering). I frosted the cake with my cream cheese frosting, which made it even better. My parents were so impressed and proud that I made this delicious cake so perfectly. Now this is a recipe you must try!

It was very tasty thank you very much for this wonderful recipe. I made some alternations as I have a few fussy eaters and they loved it.  I halved the recipe and made 12 muffins. I omitted the pine apple and walnuts, and used 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of using the oil.  I used the crushed walnuts to dusk the icing on the muffins.

Loved it!! My family loved it too. VERY dense and super moist.  Carrots do take awhile to grate by hand but I don't think I will do it any other way. I like to grate them super fine.

I have made the recipe about 6 times.  Everybody that eats it, tells me that its the best carrot cake they have ever had.  It is now my most requested cake for birthdays.   I followed the directions exactly and it comes out perfect every time.  No soggy pudding like texture at all.  Just Pure Deliciousness!

My family and I love this recipe.   The only changes that I made were I strained the pineapples, left in the liquid from the carrot mixture, and made three rounds instead of two.

Amazing recipe!  Reminds me of Cheesecake Factory's carrot cake which is fabulous.  I added a handful of coconut as well as I saw in some recipes.

I have made this cake for the last 3 or 4 years for Thanksgiving and Christmas and I keep on getting asked to make it again each year. It has certainly become one of my family's favorite deserts.

I used the carrot from my juicer and found it wasn't too moist.  I did add some apple from the juicier as well (remove the core)and cut the oil back to a little less than half with the apple that was added. it turned out fabulous, I will add a little extra cinnamon next time and maybe some dried blueberries.

Before I used the recipe, I read most of the reviews and decided to give it a try. It did NOT disappoint me at all. Best Carrot Cake EVER! It is the tastiest and most moist cake I have ever tried. If you like carrot and nuts, you will love it.

I've made this recipe several times now, and it's a hit each and every time!  I've even adjusted the recipe to make tiered wedding cakes, and this recipe holds up beautifully under the weight of upper tiers.  It stays moist for several days with a crumb coat and leaves me time to properly flat frost and decorate without worrying about the cake staying moist.  After reading the other reviews, I have always drained approx. 1/2 of the liquid from the carrots in order to prevent the cake from being almost soggy.  Highly recommend this recipe frosted with a simple cream cheese frosting!

Rather than stack layers I made two cakes and covered both with lemon icing.  I'll do the same today.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  Making it for the second time today for a community cook out.  The last time I made it was for the local Vet Center.

Bar None, the Best carrot cake recipe ever!!!
We don't necessarily like raisins in my family, so I added coconut instead. This really is a no-fail recipe.

This was quite the cake.... I made it for Easter, it was so very good, but wouldn't make it again, unless I was having guests to help eat it, it is a BIG cake. SOOO good, and it kept for almost a week after Easter in a cake carrier in the frig, it just got more moist everyday. We ate every last piece of it, yumm!! The only thing I did different, was not putting in raisins, we don't like them, and next time I make it, I will put a little more of the crushed pineapple, but that is just my personal preference!

I used this recipe to make my 1st ever carrot cake for my husband's birthday. He wanted me to use his recipe but could not find it so I went ahead with this one. He loved it and so did everyone else. 

I added more walnuts because I like more nuts.

I peeled the carrots (a whole bag) the night before. It took a while. I stored them in a stainless steel bowl covered by a damp towel overnight.

I will make again--especially if I'm having a crowd because this made a really big cake. I frosted with cream cheese frosting. (6 oz cream cheese, 2 tablespoons vanilla, 6 oz butter (unsalted) and then added confectioner's sugar until it was the right consistency and tasted right (about 16 oz)).

Loved this cake! And so did everyone that ate it! Took advice to plump up the raisins in some warm water. Scaled the recipe back to 12 servings and put it in two 8 inch round pans. It was perfect size to slice those in half to have lots of lovely layers of cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake for my mother on her birthday and she loved it.  My dad who isn't much of a cake eater (since most cakes are too sweet for him) loved this cake.  So I made him this cake for his birthday also :).  This recipe is a keeper.
Thank you Nan for sharing the recipe

I can't say enough good things about this cake...it was so incredibly tasty! I did add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon, and a touch of ginger  (the person for whom it was made is a BIG spice fan). Topped with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was perfect!

Turned out great!! I cooked this in a large bundt pan so baking time was increased for about another 20 mins.. just keep checking it. I added sliced almonds (I didn't have walnuts) and I used whipped pineapple (pineapple chunks whirled through the magic bullet). Loved the smell of it while it baked!!!

i ABSOLUTELY LOVE this recipe! its the first time i tried a carrot cake and now my family loves it!i even tried variations of this cake, e.g coffee cinnamon cake and chocolate cake. i tried this recipe as it is 90%, the only things i edited were:
1- make cake for 4 servings, instead of original 16 servings.
2-No pineapple.
3-Added baking powder along with baking soda(because my baking soda it bad quality, doesnt do the job of "baking" :( 
4- mixed in 1/4 cup hot milk to the final batter before baking. made my cake VERY SOFT!
5-bake the cake in a microwave - faster, took me like 4mins to bake? :D

lessons i learnt were: EXCELLENT recipe,perfect texture and flavor BUT use lesser sugar(because carrots in my region(south asia) are the red ones- sweeter and more watery than the orange western ones.plus im not into TOO much sweetness) .

All in all, this recipe gave me the sound ground,a framework, for baking various favored cakes!!! cooking food is all about personal preference of flavors - a bit of "right" tweaks to this recipe did wonders for me!

I bake this cake every year for my sister-in-law's birthday.  She is a carrot cake lover.  This is the best recipe I have found.  It takes and little time, but it is so worth it.  I make it according to the recipe and it turns out perfect every time.

This was a very good cake!!! Too many things in a carrot cake can make it overwhelming and this recipe was definitely not too busy! I halved the recipe and it was perfect!!! I would add a tiny more salt next time, otherwise it was a very good recipe!

I made this cake for a family birthday party and it was a hit! I made it as called for except no nuts. It makes a LOT of cake and there is only myself and my 5 year old at home so today I'm making it again but in 1lb. foil loaf pans. These will do nicely wrapped tightly and we can thaw one out, frost it and enjoy a reasonable portion that won't leave so much left over.

I tweaked the recipe slight. I cut the carrots down to 2 cups and added 1 cup of coconuts. I also didn't let the carrots and brown sugar sit for an hours. I mixed the flour and baking soda and then set it aside. I mixed all the other ingredients together and then added flour mixture. I use an 9x13 pan and cooked at 350 for 60 minutes. Turned out great, moist and tasted good with a really simple cream cheese frosting recipe. And a thick layer of that frosting on to, everybody loved it!

I followed the suggestion of others and added in an extra cup of flour as well as straining the carrots. I also soaked the currents in strong tea until they were hydrated.
The cake is extremely dense- so beware! I would suggest baking it for 50-60 minutes rather than 45-50. I also suggest sifting in the dry ingredients to try to make the cake less dense.

It's a nice cake though, a wee bit bland but that's because I didn't add in the vanilla, cinnamon or walnuts.

This cake was so good- great way to get kids to eat vegis!  We are trying to go very healthy here so I used 50% wheat flour and  replaced the white sugar with 3/4 cup agave nectar.  It was still delicious.  We made a healthier version of cream cheese frosting also using light cream cheese, small amount of smart balance butter, a little powdered sugar and some orange juice.  Yum.

What a delicious cake! Rave reviews from my husband and I. I used pecans instead of walnuts because I don't like walnuts, but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly, and it's moist and delicious! I did, however, need three cake pans to use up all the batter! We're not complaining. More cake for us!

This truly is the best carrot cake ever.  I just made it for my daughter's wedding and it was perfect.  I had to freeze it for a few days before and it was outstanding on the day of the ceremony and is still delicious a few days later.   I used the recipe as it was written and just baked it until the toothpick came out clean.  It's moist and dense and "full of yummy goodness" ( as one of my daughter's friends said).

I love this cake... I have made it several times and crave it. If I bring it somewhere everyone raves about it. If I don't bring it anywhere my BF and I eat the whole thing on our own.. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. ( It's kind of healthy right, there is six cups of carrots). I always make this in a big pyrex lazagna pan and it works perfectly. This Cake is awesome.

This is THE BEST carrot cake, as the name says. It takes a lot of work (6 cups of freshly grated carrots is a lot of grating), but it is worth every minute. I drained the carrots very well (as I read in other reviews) and soaked the raisins while the carrots were sitting in the brown sugar. Other than that, followed as written. Thanks for making me look so good at work, family get-togethers, etc.

Liked that this cake had lots of carrot in it.  Next time I'll leave out the raisins.  In place of walnuts (which I didn't have available in the pantry), I used chocolate chips.  I added more cinnamon too.  turned out great!

This IS the BEST carrot cake ever!  I soaked the raisins in rum (for a little added flavor), then added the rum to the cake with 1/2 c extra flour and it was perfect consistency.  Frosted with Cream Cheese frosting and enjoyed. I made it for my brother-in-law and now my husband wants it for his birthday too!

This carrot cake was OK,  this is my first attempt at a carrot cake -my mom has yet to share her recipe :(.  The flavors of the cake got better over night. I made it last night, in a bundt pan,  and me and my son were so excited we cut it right away.  He, being 8 liked it, but I was a little disappointed.  It is moist enough - I think the only changes I made was to squeeze the juice out of half the carrots, bc all the reviews were mixed and tweaked I wanted to see what the best recipe would taste like.  I put a cream cheese glaze over and that increased the sweetness level - I would make this cake again.

Really good flavor. Only substitution was half applesauce for oil. Use fine grater to prevent "crunchy" cake.

This truly is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted!! All other carrot cakes I have ever tasted seemed to have a metalic after taste. This one did not. It was moist but not wet. The only changes I made was to add more cinnamon than called for as well as some ground ginger. Because I did not have crushed pineapple I used pineapple chunks that I put through the blender. If you are not a carrot cake lover, this recipe will change your mind!

The cake was flavorful, however, I found it to be a bit heavy.  I think I may try a different recipe next time.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever made.  I did make a couple of changes.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of buttermilk increasing the total liquid by 1/4 cup.  I used dates instead of raisins and added 1 cup of coconut.  I also baked the cake the night before and wrapped the layers individually in plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight.  I used 3 9" pans instead of 2 10" pans.  I baked this for my mom's birthday and everyone said they loved this cake more than any other they had ever tasted.  The only recommendation I got was to double the frosting and frost the sides as well as the top!

This was just OK. I thought it was dry but that may be my fault.  We don't like raisins so I didn't add those and perhaps that's why the cake was dry.  Sorry but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I really love this recipe, I omit the raisins and add an extra egg.  This recipe makes a lot of batter.  I've made in several times and I get rave reviews everytime.  I like this recipe because it doesn't taste real greasy/oily and it's very moist.  The last time I made it, everyone wanted the recipe and some didn't even real care for carrot cake before this.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of coconut to the batter.  My DH loved it!  Definitely marinate the carrots in the brown sugar.

Made this recipe as listed yesterday and it was a huge success - only thing I did different was left the raisins out and cut down on the walnuts but it was super moist and had great flavor.

It's a keeper! My mom made this for my husband and I for our birthdays and we loved it. All she could remember was the name of the recipe, this is it! I followed the recipe, just adding a bit of nutmeg and allspice, mostly because I love those spices. Turned out great!

The title says it all.  This carrot cake is moist and delicious.  My family loves it, as do I.  Only change I made was that I mixed the nuts into the Creamcheese frosting instead of putting them in the cake itself.

I've made this cake quite a few times now, and my guests have told me a number of times that it's the best carrot cake they have ever eaten. It is moist and absolutely delicious without changing a thing from the original recipe. My husband and I don't care for nuts, so we just leave out the nuts and add more raisins, which plump up really nicely during baking. I use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site, and it makes for an amazing dessert.

This is very possibly the best cake I have ever had---period.  Thanks to both Nan for submitting the recipe, and to CRYSTALLAUREY  who made it so easy to use all of the best suggestions from reviews by putting them in one single review.  This cake can not fail if you follow the recipe with the modifications.  I had no problem whatsoever with sogginess and the consistency was just perfect! Thanks so much!

Absolutely loved the cake.  We made it for my father in laws birthday (huge carrot cake fan) and everyone went crazy.  We did add less carrots and walnuts, and it ended up being a perfect balance. We also drained the pineapple very well and did not add raisins.  The cake has a slight undertone of cinnamin and brown sugar and is great with cream cheese frosting.  Be sure to change the recipe to how many servings you want, because it does make huge portions!

This was the most delicious carrot cake recipe I've ever used. I took it to work and everyone was raving about it. The only thing I changed was I added a full can of crushed pineapple instead of just one cup. I found that it's very very important to drain the pineapple well as this makes the cake a bit lighter. This was delicious! As always, carrot cake is always tastier the next day so try to make this one day in advance.

The best ever by far. I followed the tips from Foodie71 and my family loved it. I even had orders from some of them for Christmas day.
Definitely add the extra spices, double up the cinnamon and vanilla.

This is the best carrot cake ever! I did it for Christmas and everybody loved it's moistness, I kind of just put 1/2 cup less of sugar than the recipe called for and I think next time I will just make it as the recipe says, but I recommend this to anybody who loves rich dense carrot cake.

This is pretty fair cake. I've made it twice, with modifications.  First time substituted applesauce for the oil, and it was real heavy. Was too much for plastic forks. Next time followed the recipe, but increased baking soda from
1-1/2 to 2 tsp, and added 1 tsp baking powder.  I am still trying to recapture the experience of my mom's whole wheat carrot cake, but have misplaced the recipe.

I have made this cake several times and have gotten nothing but rave reviews, even from those who are don't particularly like carrot cake.  I have even showed my husband how to make this cake so he can make it at the fire station.  This is one of my all time favorite cakes.

It is the Best Carrot Cake Ever.  I made it for my Mother-in-Law's 83rd Birthday and what I hit.  The night before her birthday I baked a cake using my sister's favorite recipe and I wasn't happy with it, so I got up early the next day and made this one.  I did exactly what the recipe said, except we don't like raisens, so I substituted 1 cup finely chopped apple.  Absolutely the Best!

My family's favorite cake.  It is very moist.  I ice the cake with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting (another All Recipe's favorite).

Everybody that taste this cake loved it.  My mother said it was a little dry, and I should have left all the juice in it.  I drained the carrots and pineapples.  I poured half of the juice back in it.  I left out the walnuts (by mistake) and sprinkled on them top of the cake after frosting it.  I made it a 3-layer cake, using 8" pans, and there was enough leftover to make a small baby loaf cake. (My intentions were to sprinkle the nuts between the layers after I spread the frosting.)   

This was my first Carrot Cake and I am very proud of it.  My daughter said she wants me to bake it again and one of the brothers at the church ate some and it made him curse on a Sunday.

Great cake.  I used the blender to shread the baby carrots I used.  Be careful not to blend for too long. This step saved A LOT of time and the cake came out amazing...Also substituted 1/2 oil for apple sauce, added fresh ginger, and some extra spices.  I will try this recipe again.

This is a great recipe.  I use sweet mini-carrots instead which does make it sweeter.  As well, I combine the carrots, brown sugar and raisins, then let it sit overnight.  The raisins plump up from the juice and gets the cake sweeter.  I did drain off the juice from the carrot mixture and it was still very moist without being wet in the middle while the rest of the cake was finished.  This is a winner!  Try the Bourbon Cream Cheese frosting.

This is by far the best carrot cake I've ever made. The sweet pineapple means you use a lot less sugar than some of the other recipes out there.  I used the scale to reduce the recipe by 1/2 and it was still perfect.  To top it off I had to go with simple cream cheese icing. I package of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter (1/2cup) 1 3/4 cup of icing sugar and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.

This was an ok cake for me but I did it by the suggestions from the reviews on draining the carrots and pineapple and it turned out too dry for my taste.  I think I prefer the pudding and moist type cakes.  The batter was yummy and it didn't taste bad, just now know to either do it as the recipe says or to not drain all of it.  The cream cheese frosting II was divine with it, I could eat that stuff straight out of the bowl, oh wait I did!

BEST EVER. Heavy that is for sure. I doubled and served to over 40 people. Cake is so rich you don't need a huge slice. Tastes awesome cold. Will make again and have several requests to make again. Love this recipe!

This is a very good, very heavy cake.  We use unbleached, but not whole wheat, flour and no raisins or walnuts.  I hedged my bets based on some of the other reviews and left all of the juice from soaking the carrots, and I'm glad I did.  We baked in a giant sheet pan (11x14 I think) for about 35 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  Although I don't care for walnuts, I wish I had thrown a few chopped ones in, as the cake could use a little texture.

We frosted with the Cream Cheese Frosting II some others recommended, and while the frosting was good, I found it to be more cheesecake-like then I wanted.  Will probably look for one with more of a traditional frosting consistency next time.

I love carrot cake but had never made it before...just never attempted it...but this turned out awesome!  I wanted to eat the whole darn thing myself...but don't worry I shared.  It was easy, time consuming but easy and turned out great.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I frosted it with homemade cream cheese frosting...just the best!

This recipe was excellent - I did squeeze out much of the juice, and hydrated the raisins (no rum, so used brandy)  Turned out great - and even got the comment of "this is the best carrot cake ever" from two carrot cake lovers that I know.

With so many great reviews, I expected the cake to knock my socks off.  It was very good and everyone enjoyed it, but not the best ever.  I did change it and add a little baking powder and made it in a 9 by 13" pan and baked for the recommended time.  I think it might be better with the layers or cupcakes which I'll try again.  I might also add a little more pineapple.

This cake was very good, but it didn't knock my socks off. I made three layers using 9" rounds. The cakes rose unevenly while baking and I had to cut a lot of cake off the tops to make the layers even for stacking and frosting. I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding the walnuts). It tasted good and I will probably make this every Easter. Our family and guests seemed to enjoy it, so overall it was a nice cake. Though I wouldn't call it the best ever. (Maybe I'm more of a chocolate kind of girl).

I used peeled baby carrots and chopped them very finely with the steel blade in my food processor.  Also, I had pineapple chunks so I prepared them the same way.

This cake turned out awesome.  I divided the recipe in 1/2 and followed it to the T with the raisins and nuts and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this cake again.  Next time I will try to find an easier way to grate the carrots.

This cake was a huge hit at work. I read all the helpful reviews and followed the recipe exactly. I used the pre-shredded carrots to save time. I would suggest chopping them before coating them with sugar.  They tend to be very long. I didn't add the raisins either. (Ok, so maybe I didn't follow it exactly!) I also used 2 8-inch pans and had enough for 5 cupcakes, perfect for tasting. It was quick and easy to follow. I highly recommend it.

Fabulous recipe.  I made it exactly according to the instructions, including baking it an hour, and it turned out perfectly.  This was for work birthday and it is getting rave reviews.  I frosted it with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe on this site and it is a definite "do again!" keeper.

This really was a great cake. Very moist, just the flavor you're looking for in a good carrot cake. Now I just how to figure out how to make it gluten/wheat free.

This cake is awesome! My husband's favorite cake is carrot, so a few years ago I used this recipe to suprise him with a cake for his birthday. I've never used another recipe. He loves it and gets one every year now. I made one for Thanksgiving last year and had a request for it again this year. I also made one for a carry-in at work last week. Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe!  I love the addition of raisins, and the cake keeps very well in the refrigerator.  I only would have preferred a lighter, less dense cake... but the taste is delicious!

This name accurately describes this cake! This is absolutely the best carrot cake ever! I have been looking for a carrot cake for years that actually had carrots in it. I added extra pineapple...this cake is sooooo moist. My husband says it is almost like a pudding! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not have any cinnamon so I used pumpkin spice instead.  I frosted with the cream cheese frosting from this site and dusted the cake with finely chopped walnuts. Oh, and I thought the texture was great. It was dense, like some people said - but that's how I like it....

The flavor was fabulous- loved the combo of carrot, walnut, and pineapple chunks- great texture.  However, it was a bit dense and require 15+ minutes more baking time than the recipe calls for. I also substituted 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil for the full cup of oil- maybe that had something to do with the extra baking time.

This was an excellent cake! My kids loved it. My 90 year old grandma liked it. Lots of great reviews from all of them! I did not add raisins since my kids and I don't care for them but really this turned out very well. I also used the cream cheese 2 recipe that someone recommended in the reviews. Very good!

This is such a great cake!! I am not a big fan of carrot cake in the first place, but I figured for Easter, I'd make one. I did a 2 layer 9 inch cake, and used the leftover batter for cupcakes. I also frosted and filled it with cream cheese frosting. I was amazed at how good it was, and received rave reviews from family. I took the cupcakes to work, and they were gone in no time. The only thing I may do differently next time is back down on the carrots by 1 cup or so. Otherwise, fabulous!!

Very nice. Moist and flavourful. I added much more cinnamon then called for, and I also added some nutmeg. I didn't have walnuts so I used almonds instead.

This really IS the best carrot cake ever. Everyone raved about it at the family Christmas dinner I took it to; it was the first dessert to disappear (and there were 4 desserts there!). I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe found on this site to go with it. A definite keeper.

Dense and moist.  Very good.  Keep in mind when feeding a crowd that not everyone likes carrot cake, but if they do, they will like this one.

I made this carrot cake last thanksgiving and it was a hit! Everyone love it the only problem was I should have made two! When you have this cake you might as well not make any other sweets because they will not measure up. This year I will make two and I'm sure it will be a hit.

This really was the best carrot cake ever.  I gave a huge piece to my mother-in-law and she ate the whole thing.  She said that she now knows who is bringing the dessert to the Christmas party.  Thanks

This was a great recipe!  I did do some changes to the recipe to suit our families taste. I added half a tsp of each ground cloves, allspice, nutmeg and 1 tsp of unsweetened coco.  I reduced the carrots to half the amount and replaced the wlanuts with peacans.  I used a family cream cheese icing and then covered the sides with peacan pieces.  Presentation was excellent and it was tasty too.

This cake was very moist and my kids love it, but it did lack a little of that zing we are used to with boxed carrot cake.  I added ground cloves and ginger and it was perfect.  I also used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site, the yummiest frosting ever.

It would've been MUCH better without the raisins. My advice, skip the raisins, I love them and thought it'd be a good idea, but it just doesn't go together.

Excellent!  I was looking for a special cake to make for my husband's birthday, and decided to give this one a try.  It was perfect - great ingredients, easy-to-follow directions, and fantastic results.  I halved the recipe, and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, then cut the cake in two and made a rectangular layer cake (I put apricot preserves between the layers).  The only two modifications I made were:  1) I replaced half the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce, and 2) I used  2/3 white flour, 1/3 whole wheat flour.  The cake turned out to be very moist and flavourful, without feeling too heavy. A keeper!

Moist and Delicious!  I made just 1/2 the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes.  It was so moist and delicous.  Three days later it is still awesome.  I topped it with a Cream Cheese Frosting made with 1/2 cup butter, 1 pkg. cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 tsp. vanilla extract.

This cake is yummy, but when the description indicated "makes a large quantity of cake" I had no idea how much cake I was actually making.  This cake is very filling and it takes a while for 3 people to eat.  Yummy dessert for breakfast with coffee.

This cake was really moist, but a bit too pudding-like for me. My aunt said she loved it though; she liked the occasional crunch of the walnuts. I didn’t follow the recipe exactly, I had mixed in the flour and the batter was rather thick and lumpy. So I added in about 1/4 c of the carrot juice leftover after I had strained the ground carrots. Maybe the extra liquid is why my cake turned out the way it did. Even though I loved the flavors in this cake I won't be making it again, the 4-1/2 cups of carrots after I had scaled it to 12 servings was too much of a job. Perhaps I will try it again after i get a new food processor. I certainly need one.

Great cake. Was told by many it was the best they ever had. I omitted the raisins and also cut the oil to 1/2 cup. I bought 2 bags of the pre shredded carrots for 99 cents a bag. I put them in the food processor and got almost exactly 6 cups of grated carrot. Much easier then peeling and then grating carrots!

We really liked this cake; the pineapple made it moist and a little sweeter than otherwise. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding extra spices, too: cloves, nutmeg, and allspice. Stacking the two layers with cream cheese frosting made for an elegantly tall cake. I'll definitely make this again, maybe this time with some whole wheat flour.

This is definitely the BEST CARROT CAKE I have ever made! All I have to say is WOW!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  It does make a large cake, I made it a 3 layer cake with 9-inch pans. Then I made homemade cream cheese frosting. Excellent combination!  Because it made so much, it lasted a few days and even on the last day of cake, it was still just as moist as the first day!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This recipe takes some time to make with all the preparation, but is well worth it!

Awesome cake! I used 1 cup white sugar instead of 1.5 C, I also used olive oil & didn't drain all the pineapple juice. Yummy stuff :)

Pretty good carrot cake!  I only added 1 and 1/2 cups of carrots because I found that to be plenty--and I added a cup of coconut for something a little extra.  The flavor and texture are really good, but keep in mind..this is a VERY heavy cake--very rich, but good!

I was asked to make a carrot cake for a friend.  I used this recipe.  It turned out pretty good as a layer cake, but I thought it was too dry.  I made part of it as a 9 x 13 and left out the raisins and nuts.  THAT was absolutely marvelous.  The layer cake was a little dry (probably my fault), and nothing really fantastic.  Making it as a sheet cake really was the best choice.  I will make that again, not using the nuts and raisins.

I really liked it! It was a little dry because I used freshly ground whole wheat flour, but it had a good flavor. It made a lot-one 9 by 13" pan plus six cupcakes!

This cake was amazing! I made it for Father's Day, and since my dad doesn't like raisins and is allergic to pineapple, I ommitted the raisins and substituted the pineapple with 1 c. of applesauce. I'm not sure how the original tastes, but this was great! I also used a cream cheese spread also found on this site, and it was also great! Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this cake.  It was really moist and rich.  The only thing I would do different is grate my carrots finer.  I used white chocolate cream cheese for the icing and turned out great.  Thankyou very much for a wonderful recipe that I'm going to use on a future wedding cake.

This was a really wonderful cake. It turned out beautiful and it was very tasty, although it didn't turn out as moist as I would've liked, but I think it's because I didn't have all the ingredidents on hand (no crushed pineapples!). Overall, it was very delicious. My whole family loved it, and this was my first time ever baking a homemade carrot cake! Thanks for the great recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this carrot cake every year at christmas time for the past three years. Everyone in my family just loves it. I hear it is the best ever. I add a more spice to mine by adding all spice. This is really a great recipe and leave my family asking for more.

This is very good carrot cake.  I omitted the raisins and nuts, but left everything else the same.  The carrots and sugar did have a lot of liquid and I dumped it all in to the batter.  I figured it doesn't say to drain the excess liguid, so why would I?  Used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.

I personally dont like raisins or nuts so I left them out. I thought this was the best cake I have ever made, the pinapple was just awesome in it. The only thing that was time consuming was the shredding of the carrots but I did them the night before with the brown sugar. Awesome Cake!!!

YUM! Made this for a work party and it got major rave reviews!  Used the cream cheese icing recipe (jannis') off this site.  Definitely a keeper!  

Some reviewers said this was a lot of work. I didn't think so. Maybe if you don't use a food processor to shred the carrots?

This was my first carrot cake I've ever made.  Someone at work had requested it for her birthday and I warned her it was my first.  I don't eat cake but everyone loved it.  Used a cream cheese frosting.  Have already made it 2 more times. Thanks.

Perfection! I had my dad rate this recipe on his first slice. He rated it 5 stars after one bite! I halfed this recipe and it baked perfectly in a 7"x11" glass pan. I did shorten the cook time to accomodate. I left out the raisins out of preference. This cake is delicious. Part of the moistness has to come from "marinating" carrots in the brown sugar. That was a first for me. Love this recipe!

This was the very first carrot cake I've ever made... Outstanding!  Rave reviews!  Served it up without the nuts (allergies) and instead of raisins used craisins! Topped with a homemade cream cheese frosting... Bravo!!!  Everyone loved it.  Will definately make it again :)

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers. This cake is VERY heavy and does take longer to cook than stated. It is good but very unhealthy.

Not the best I've had, but not the worst either.  It was very moist...but something seemed a little "off", taste wise.  I did use preshredded carrots, though, which could be what made the difference.  Not bad, overall.

This cake tastes exactly like the ones you can find at Second Cup! Instead of just draining the carrots and the pineapple, I pressed them to squish all the juice up, and the cake turned out a little bit dry :( Also, make sure to make the batter really really flat and even before putting it into the oven because the cake will just stay at whatever shape you put the batter in. I was going to omit the raisins but they actually made the cake a lot tastier! I think this cake is better without the cheese icing; the icing hides all its wonderful flavor.

I used all natural and organic ingredients and substituted stone ground whole wheat flour for half the flour called for.  I was worried it may be too moist so I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and strained a small amount of liquid (3 tsp.) from the carrot mixture after it sat for an hour.  It turned out moist and delicious.  Everyone liked it, even the kids! This recipe is a keeper!

If I could give this three-and-a-half stars I would. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best carrot cake I've ever had either. The flavor was good, but the texture was far too dense. Also I don't think the pineapple added much. We'll eat the rest of it, but I won't be making it again.

What a delicious cake!  I wasn't sure whether to shred carrots coarsely or finely, so I did a bit of both and it turned out lovely. I was tempted not to add pineapple, raisins, or nuts (I'm not a huge fan of any of these) but I'm glad I did, it really added to the texture and flavor. I omitted 1/2 cup of sugar because the sweetness of the frosting (I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site) more than made up for it. I think it would have been too sweet otherwise. This cake is definitely best served CHILLED.  Thanks, Nan for an incredible recipe! I'll never use another one.

This really is the best.  I've been asked to make this repeatedly for friends birthdays.  A bit of work to shred all the carrots, but worth every bit.

Really great cake.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top for decoration.  It was time consuming because I didn't have a grater but worth it.  I got the cream cheese frosting from this site and it was good as well.

This truly is the best carrot cake recipe I've found so far. I mince the raisins for a more even texture.  Since I'm always asked to make this during the holidays I've decided to make carrot cake loaves as gifts!

Very delicious carrot cake!  I omitted the raisins. I halfed the recipe. I am serving this at a work luncheon - I've already had 2 pieces!  Seems like a lot of carrots for the recipe, but the cake came out just fine.

These made very good muffins.  The only thing I changed was halving the recipe, using whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour, and adding coconut.  I will leave out the raisins next time.  Half of the recipe made a dozen cupcake sized muffins.  I can't say it was the best I ever had, but it was VERY good.  (I'm still searching for a recipe that comes close to the best I ever had.)

This truly is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever found.  Moist, fluffy, and delicious.  I added a 4 serving-size box of dry pudding mix (cheesecake flavor, although vanilla would be good too) with the dry ingredients and about 1/4 cup of water with the egg mixture.  I made this for my mother's birthday, and will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did everyone who tried it.  I omitted the nuts and raisins, since I don't care for raisins.  I crushed the nuts and put them on top of the cream cheese icing.  The cake was very moist and delicious.

YUK! Don't let the name of this recipe fool you. Besides omitting the raisins, I followed the recipe exactly. I might as well have poured sugar into a bowl and served it to my family. Also, the cake came out very dense. One reviewer hit the nail on the head when she said "it's like the carrot cake wrapped in plastic wrap, that you buy at the gas station".

Besides having great tase and texture which has been mentioned in several reviews, its also kid friendly to prepare if you have a food processor.  (what the kids make-they are sure to eat!!!) An all around winner for a recipe!

I tried out this recipe and turn out to be great, with some change in reduction of white sugar a bit. as I like less sweet cake.

I made this cake for my father's birthday and he absolutely loved it!  He said that it was far better than any store-bought carrot cake.  Thanks for the recipe!  FYI --- I wanted a larger cake so I used 1 1/2X the ingredients called for in the recipe and it came out great!

I'm not a fan of carrot cake but my boyfriend loves it so I figured I'd give it a try.  From what he said, it was the best cake he has ever had.  I omitted the raisins and pineapple, but I did kick up the amount of cinnamon.  I also drained a bit of the liquid (not too much) I got from mixing the carrots and brown sugar.  Definitely use a food processor for the carrots or you'll be sitting there forever grating!  I also used a tub of whipped cream cheese frosting (great frosting, recommend it) and put shredded cocount on top.  It came out great and he's already asked me for more!  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I 'officially' joined ALLRECIPES.COM just so I could rate this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT I used an extra 1/2 cup of nuts instead of the raisins. (1 cup of black walnuts and half a cup of english walnuts) This is the best carrot cake you will ever eat... moist and delicious. I made 3 square sheet cakes instead of a traditional layer cake and topped with a cream cheese icing also found on this site. I can't say enough about this cake... try it!

I am not a fan of raisins, so I made mine without, and it was really the best carrot cake I have ever had.  It is very moist and has a great nutty consistency without allowing the nuts to overpower the carrots.  I definitely recommend this one for anyone.

For as long as I've been married, my husband from time to time would tell me about the carrot cakes his dad use to make for him. I tried once but it really was a desater. I tried this one and it really made him smile. Much Thanks to the one who shared.

My husband doesn't give many recipes five stars and he says this one is definitely a top pick. I made this for the first time for a huge family function that included my husband's birthday as well. I made half with raisins and half without since so many people have preferences and it was a huge hit. My husband still keeps begging me to make it again. It made a lot of cake and the flavor was wonderful. One bit of advice however; I wouldn't make this without a food processor/grater because it requires so much carrot. It does require some time and effort even with kitchen appliance help, but it's worth it for the final product. Thanks!

I made this for a friend's birthday and it went down a treat. I was a little short for time, so I baked two 8-inch layers and sandwiched them together with a cream cheese frosting to which I added a touch of lemon zest. The only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating is becasue I felt it was a little too dense, perhaps, and it didn't turn out of the tins well. I'd try lining them with greaseproof paper next time. And, although it doesn't say so in the recepie, I thought this was best served from the fridge. The remaining batter I kept in my fridge for a couple of days, and very happily it stayed there, too. For after its wait, I used it to make some muffins, which I topped with a little of the remaining lemony cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with a few chopped walnuts. I baked them at 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes, or until a cocktail stick inserted into the centre came out clean. They were delicious

This cake was very easy to make.  The first time I made this cake the guest was loving it.  I was told that I should make it for every event.  I used icing from a betty crocker cookbook and it was excellent together.  The cake was served warm and I think that made it even better.  I made if for another crowd and receive the same reactions.  I am making it again this weekend for another event.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

FIVE + STARS! This is incredibly good.  This makes a big cake.  I wanted to take this to a dinner party but my family said no way, they want to eat it all.  I had this cake about 6 days and was moist the whole time.

This was the most beautiful carrot cake I have ever put in my mouth.  I have never made a carrot cake before, and was astonished at the moist, flavorful, exquisite result!  My co-workers are asking for a monthly installment.  Thank you.

This truly is the best. Moist, spicy, delicious. I left out the raisins, and used black walnuts. I also added allspice. Other than that, everything was the same.

it's very moist.. maybe the water that is produced by the carrot shold be thrown away n adding more walnut would be better.. overall.. it's quite good as a carrot cake!

i admit I am not a big fan of carrot cake. Found this recipe to be very heavy and moist- to the point of being underdone in consistency. I could have left it in the oven for more than the 60 minutes- the toothpick came out clean. I cut it in half and frosted btwn the layers with a cream cheese frosting. (make sure you cool COMPLETELY before cutting) I give it 3 stars because I was making this cake for a birthday party and was disappointed in how it turned out.

I don't eat carrot cake, but my fiance and his family are big fans of it. I made it as a Thanksgiving Day dessert and it went over incredibly well. I think I'll be the proud recipient of a food processor come Christmas time though - as grating 6 cups of carrots isn't for the impatient or those who don't like their knuckles cut.

Aside from being not too carroty (the pineapple and raisins are very noticeable, it's almost like a fruity cake - NOT a fruit cake heaven forbid), this cake is great.  Moist and chewy, and a lot of "fresh" ingredients.  Give it a go, you should have no problems.

Great cake, but too bad there was no icing recipe included.  Feel free to add more spices - extra cinammon, some nutmeg, whatever you like.

This was excellent! I reduced the carrots to 5 cups and topped with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe. It got rave reviews from my coworkers. Grating the carrots was a pain, but the result was well worth it.

Wow, this recipe is awesome!  It took me forever to prepare the carrots, but I could imagine how quicker this process would be if I had a food processor. The cake was huge, and stayed moist for up to a week.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I ended up making three 9 inch layers.  I love the texture and it is soooo moist!  I made it for Easter and my mom ate 5 pieces that day!  My dad ate 4!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

My wife had to work Easter, so I decided to bake this cake.  It was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  It didn't take long either.  I added a little more vinilia and cut back one half cup of carrots. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe and added some of the pineapple that was left in the icing.  One woman said "this is to die for"  This was so good and the texture, moistness was perfect.  Everyone had atleast two peices, some more than that. You could never buy a cake like this, good.  A kid could make it.

Very moist and delicious and makes a lot!  My family absolutely loved it!  My three year old loved it and ate his whole piece!  My six year old picked out the raisins and nuts...my husband loved it.  Very very very good.

Fantastic recipe!!  I made it for our family thanksgiving dinner this year and it was a hit!  A quick way to grate the carrots is use a food processor, I had to borrow one but it was worth the effort.  I will definately make it again and again!  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe ruled!  I'm a pastry chef and have yet to find a recipe that was as moist as this cake!  I loved the idea of soaking the carrots in the brown sugar!  It was a wonderful flavor!  Thanks!

This cake is incredible...very moist and decadent, yet not too sweet.  I used a cream cheese frosting with a 1/2 teaspooon of cinnamon and nutmeg mixed in the frosting.  It really brought out the rich flavor of the cake!  Instead of making a 10 inch 2-layer cake, I made an 8 inch three layer and it turned out beautifully.  I will definitely make this cake again.

Choose this cake 'cause it had the largest amount of carrots.  Wonderful!  Worth the time grating the carrots!  I used half oil half butter instead of all oil.  Great!  Added extra spices with no problem.  Made for a birthday party with 20 guests.  Had to pass out the recipe.  You won't be disappointed.

My family really enjoyed this carrot cake. This was my first attempt at makeing a carrot cake and it was great. I made this cake Saturday night and it was gone Sunday night. The only "downer" was shredding all those carrots! Will definitely make again. Thanks.

Not very quick only because of having to grate the carrots.  I used a potatoe peeler so the carrots could be seen.  Everyone like it at Frankie's birthday!  Very moist
