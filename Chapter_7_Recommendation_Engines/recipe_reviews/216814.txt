Being Peruvian, I make this for my family all the time. I would omit the 1 cup of oil, water, peanut butter and ketchup these ingredients are not necessary.  Just use maybe 3 tablespoon of EVOO. That should be enough.  Happy Cooking!

This was a hit. I have a very picky husband. I followed the recipe to the tee. However, I was a little aprehensive to adding the peanut butter, I thought it was a little unusaual, and I knew that he doesn't like peanut butter. But nontheless, he loved it and this was a great recipe. Make sure you have enough time to create this wonderful dish. It does take a lot out of you, but it is well worth it! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fun recipe and I love how the flavors compliment each other.  The presentation was great and it was filling.  I used spinach rather than peas and it was a good substitute.

This is a really nice recipe.  My whole family liked it.  Just one change that I made (well two actually).  I added salt to the cooking water in the rice.  This recipe has no salt at all so for people on a low salt diet this is great.  But I think if I didn't salt the rice it would have been really bland.  The other thing I did differently was that I browned the meat in a separate pan and then drained the fat.  The recipe was a little time consuming but worth it.  A really delicious recipe.

This was good but I felt the cumin was too present in the taste. This was really just arroz con picadillo with a pretty presentation. A nice spin on making this look nice though

I loved this recipe, hubby and kids only liked it, so 4/5 from me. It sure is easy, and I think the flavor is excellent! Plus it is a fun presentation and something really different for a weeknight. I often have hardboiled eggs ready to go in the fridge and that cuts prep time down to 'long enough to cook rice and smash it in a bowl,' about 30 minutes. Hubby found this dish to be on the plain side for his taste and ended up adding fish oil and chili oil and stirring it in (ew, but whatever, he had to eat it) and said that made it fantastic. I appreciate the opportunity to try this out and I will love eating the leftovers!

This was an easy weeknight dinner.  I had leftover beef to use up (ground it in the food processor), and many of the ingredients here are pantry staples.  Having said that I didn't have cumin and substituted chili powder.  I'd probably put more potato in next time - I loved the crunchy touch it added.

I used a 9 inche cake pan, and wasn't going to flip it thinking it wouldn't come out.   It did, though - and it was pretty!  I even flipped the leftovers (there are just two of us) back into the cake plate.  Mission accomplished:  something different from beef leftovers!

This was really super good! I added some salt to the rice as suggested by other reviewers. I also forgot to add the potatoes, so I just put them on top. I dont like ketchup so we didnt use that. Really yummy and cool looking recipe. Not very hard to make either!

Something new, fun, & tasty for the whole family!  You can make your own flavorful design with a "saucy" topping, some of us used hot sauce, others used soy...to each his own & boy was it good.

My family loved this. I added beef bullion cubes to the rice and skipped adding the boiled egg. We didnâ€™t have aji powder so I used aji paste from a jar.

My son demolished his. My husband liked as I did as well. Must have great. I made them a little more individual. I did follow the recipe. I had to use a cereal bowl. I had nothing smaller. My husband requested mixed vegetables in his. He also added homemade taco sauce. I added yellow squash, green pepper and zucchini. I would like to add cheese to the top next time. Awesome dish and already has been requested to made again. They were all shocked to learn that it had peanut butter in it...

I really like the idea of this recipe, but the meat was really bland.  I just happened to be making chicken noodle soup at the same time so I kept adding the broth from my soup to the meat mixture, because I also did not want to fry the potatoes.  I added the potatoes at the same time as the carrots. I cut the potato up in really small cubes and added the chicken broth.  I put in some garlic salt and some creole seasoning to give the meat more flavor.  Without adding the broth, garlic salt and creole seasoning the meat would have been really bland.  As someone has already said, if you are on a low sodium diet then this would be a good recipe, otherwise it is better with modifications.

Overall, this was a fun and pretty ethnic dish to make.  I think that because of the amount of rice, the flavor was just a bit bland and that the meat mixture would be better with more peanut butter and maybe some extra spice.

Hi I made this for my hubby so I tweaked it!, for the potatoes, I substituted cooked diced potatoes in a can! I tossed them with Evoo salt and pepper and stuck them in the air fryer for 7 minutes. Came out perfect! I also used 2 tablespoons of Evoo to brown the seasonings, added the hamburger, pored in liquified tomatoes, then lastly, tossed in the potatoes! He loved it!! Eliminate the oil!!

Very good but I am glad I reviewed the reviews first. The rice definitely needed salt.  I also added a bit of salt to the meat mixture.  I didn't have ground beef but I did have some roast beef, which I put through the food processor.   To save time I assembled the dishes and covered them.  About 45 minutes before we were to sit down with our guests, I put the dishes in the oven to heat.  The potatoes weren't crisp by then but it didn't matter.   I will definitely make this again.

I made some changes for convenience:
- Used frozen peas and carrots
- Used frozen O'brien hash brown potatoes (comes with onion and green pepper) 

Cooked ground beef first, removed with slotted spoon and cooked potatoes in leftover grease for more taste.

Definitely need to spice this up.  Nearly doubled all the herbs and spices, tasting as I went along.  Needed salt, so I added Goya adobo.

Came out great!  Peruvian wife and in-laws loved it!

This smelled amazing while I was preparing it, but I was somewhat disappointed in the taste. I drained the fat after cooking the hamburger, so that may have caused a lot of my flavor to diminish. I didn't add cilantro, but if I had I am sure it would help with the bland taste. I may try this again, but try for stronger flavor in the meat mixture. I will also add salt to my rice.
