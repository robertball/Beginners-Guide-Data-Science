Delicious - and this was so easy to put together! Definitely a "fix it and forget it" kind of meal that's perfect for when you don't want to heat up the oven. I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added a jar of marinara sauce along with the tomato paste. Instead of frozen bell pepper strips I used two fresh bell peppers cut into small strips along with a thin sliced onion. I uppped the spices a little bit, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, a splash of wine, and a Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Since I'm not a huge fan of frozen meatballs I used "Starr's Savory Meatballs" from this site. I let this go on high for one hour and another six hours on low. Perfect with a garden salad, warm bread, and a glass of wine!

For something so simple, it tasted wonderful!  I used a can of Hunt's Meat Sauce and a can of diced tomatoes, 1 bell pepper and probably a pound of frozen meatballs.  I also added a package of the thick sliced mushrooms.  Cooked on hi for about 3 hours, low for 2.  I made penne pasta and mixed it in.  Fantastic flavor, just right for us.

This was so easy and delicious and using Pam cooking spray made clean up a breeze too! I used Safeway Italian Meatballs and I also used fresh peppers. 1 green pepper sliced, 1 red pepper sliced and 1 small onion sliced. I added a lot of extra seasoning....parsley, basil, oregano, Herbs de Provence, red pepper flakes, garlic salt and salt and pepper to taste. I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and it turned out perfect. I served mine over mini farfalle pasta because I had some to use up. This took me less than 10 minutes to throw together and yielded some great results! Thanks for sharing!!

Good recipe.  Leftovers can be served on rolls as meatball hoagies.

We all LOVED this! This took absolutely no time to put together, but the finished product tasted like you spent some time making it. I don't care for store bought frozen meatballs, so I used 'Meatball Nirvana' recipe from this site and had them in the freezer ready to go. Using the frozen peppers and onions saved a lot of prep time, which is awesome when you're in a hurry, but still want a nice dinner. Also, using PAM(R) cooking spray made clean up a breeze...a BIG plus in my book! I served this over whole grain penne for a nice, healthy meal, but I know the meatballs and peppers would be wonderful in a sandwich too! I did cook mine on low for 5 hours, but that was my only change. If you have a favorite pasta sauce, you can even use that in place of the diced tomatoes/tomato paste, which is what I plan to try next time. All in all, this was a HUGE hit and a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh wow, I cant say enough about this recipe!  I made this on a week night after work, it was so quick to put together, but tasted outstanding!  I added in some sliced mushrooms and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Everyone in my family loved this!

What a great idea to use Pam in the slow cooker. Clean up was a breeze and this dish was great! I made my own meatballs and used fresh green peppers I seared in a pan before. Wonderful and easy! Will make again.

I have to admit, we didn't expect this to be very flavorful - Boy, were we wrong! This recipe is definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly except he that I added a spoonful of minced garlic (we love it) and a dash of red pepper flakes. You definitely need more penne if you intend to serve the whole pot at once, but the leftovers heat up marvelously for hoagies. Thanks, Pam! This super easy dinner will go into our regular rotation.

What an easy meal to put together! I couldn't find the frozen peppers at the grocery store, so I used fresh.  I came in from an errand and had exactly 4 hours until my husband would be home for dinner. This turned out great!
