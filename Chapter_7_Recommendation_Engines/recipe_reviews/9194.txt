Surprisingly the ingredients really complimented each other! THis went great with Cuban Shredded Pork and crusty bread.

This was awesome!  It went great with our hamburger dinner.  I think it's better than Red Hot and Blue (restaurant in the SE part of the state).  I roasted the peppers in the oven and have to say, they tasted just as good as the roasted red peppers you'd buy at the grocery store.

I brought this to our Family Christmas Party and it was the only dish that was completely eaten. I've given the recipe to several people because they enjoyed it so much.

I only made this to clear out some leftovers but I will hang on to the recipe! It was very good. I cut down the recipe so I could just use one bag of corn (which is about 2C). I also had to make a few subs based on what I had on hand - 1/2 t sugar instead of the syrup, and shallots instead of the green onions. I used jarred peppadew peppers since that's what I had on hand. They have a kick and added a great flavor. I cut the hot pepper sauce (Tabasco) down a little since I was using spicy peppers. I also cut the oil in half since it seemed like too much. Despite all the changes it turned out great.

Very flavorful relish - sweet and tangy with just a hint of heat.  It's wonderful, just as it is, but I may add a bit of celery seed the next time because I think that flavor would compliment the existing recipe and add another bit of color and texture.   This time I made it exactly as written, except for using the recalculating tool to cut the amount down by two thirds.  That would be my only gripe - no way will this recipe (as originally written) give 80 people anything but a dollop sized amount.  I realize it's a relish and a little will go a long way, but trust me, you will want more.

I have only just mixed this up...thought it has not had time to set in the fridge, I can't stop eating it. I have made this for a vegan pot luck and I am sure it will go over great.  I used a jar of roasted red peppers and will use the leftovers for the red pepper humus on this site that is to die for. (Spiced Sweet Roasted Red Pepper Hummus)

This is so delicious!  The addition of the real maple syrup definately puts it over the top in smooth flavor.

Great side. I bought the mixed small peppers from Costco but it was a lot of work to break them down. I didn't have cider vinegar, green onions, or maple syrup. I skipped the onion, used Balsamic, and Agave nectar, canned corn, Adobo seasoning instead of salt, and olive oil. I am really happy with this dish. Thank you!

A wonderful recipe!  We did not add the hot sauce but added a tablespoon of sugar.  It was great with pork chops.

Excellent! I made this for a cookout. My friend's husband went crazy over it and took the leftovers home! I subbed curry for the turmeric because I didn't have any, and used 2 red bell peppers. Thanks!

This is a great recipe for cleaning out the veggie drawer in the fridge. I adjusted for 20 servings (instead of 80) because I only had 1 ear of corn. Weight-wise it only amounted to 1/2 bag of frozen corn, but I eye-balled the rest of ingredients. I used 1 green onion and 1/2 red bell pepper. I also threw in 1/2 green bell pepper (just trying to get rid of leftover veggies before they go bad). A small wedge of red onion was giving me the sad eyes, so I pulled it out, diced it up, and threw it in.  I didn't change the marinade much other than adjusting for 20 servings. But, after tasting it, I decided it needed more heat, so I hit it with 4 drops of sriracha sauce and it turned out perfect!

I was really looking forward to this but found the flavor really underwhelming and bland. I searched around for other recipes with different ingredients I could use as a suggestion to try and kick this up a bit (celery seed, ground mustard, white onion, cucumber, green pepper) but in the end all those ingredients would have been better served making something else.

This was interesting and a nice combo of ingredients. I halved the amount of corn and it came out great! Served it with grilled chicken. Will make again

Love this,
I do make changes, however.  I use only 1 bag of corn. I prefer that ratio corn to pepper to onions... Because that makes about half the quantity I use half of the ingredients for the sauce, except for the turmeric which I halve again, since I'm not a big fan..
The first time I made it I used a can of corn and roasted red peppers from a jar, and still it was so, so, good!
Better with the frozen corn and fresh roasted red pepper,, but I'd make it either way!
Thank you for this recipe! My GREAT Grandmother made a wonderful corn relish and I've never found any that I liked as much.  She'd get a kick out me asking for it when we visited because everyone else just ate it like a relish (one spoonful), where as I'd be happy to eat the whole jar.  :)

I saw a Corn Salsa at Trader Joes and a Cowboy Salsa at Costco, so wanted to make a homemade version; found this recipe and had all of the ingredients except for frozen corn, but had canned (15.5 ounce), so used two cans. We ate this with corn chips like a salsa, used on tacos, as a condiment on various sandwiches, and by the spoonful. I'm a big fan of turmeric flavor, real maple syrup, and roasted red peppers. Delicious!
