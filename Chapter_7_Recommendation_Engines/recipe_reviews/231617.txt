There's nothing special about these, but they're good. I actually came across this recipe while trying to eat from my fridge, pantry and freezer. The only thing I didn't have on-hand was the cream of mushroom soup, so I made my own (2 Tbls butter; 1 large chopped mushroom; 3 Tblsp flour; 1 cup milk and 1 tsp chicken bouillon granules). For the green taco sauce, I used a 12 oz. jar of Herdez Tomatillo Verde sauce (the entire jar) and for the chicken, I actually had some sliced chicken meat that I just shredded in my food processor. I only mixed half of the sauce with the chicken, filled the tortillas, and then used the remaining half of the sauce on top. Served this with some rice and beans and pico de gallo on the side.

Put it in oven right away, still came out great. Took it to my cooking teacher and got an 98% with no changes to the recipe. She said I could've got a 100 if I put more cheese

I used 2 tsp Mexican spice instead of canned chilies; added 1 small can of mushrooms and 1 small can of spinach then covered casserole with a can of red enchilada sauce before putting cheese on top. Everyone loved it.

This recipe is more like an enchilada casserole rolled up.  The flavor was great and I would make again.  I did use cream of chicken as my family does not do mushrooms

Family loved it! I obviously added black olives to half because I’m a fan and my husband and son are not. I also added a can of diced tomato and I shredded the chicken (using the mixer/beater method-it’s soooo easy!) used half the taco sauce in the mixture and half just on the top. We used whole wheat flour tortilla wraps and added a dollop of light sour cream. Delicious!

I liked this. I dont cook with canned soup much anymore, but this made for an easy sauce compared to my scratch recipe. I used Trader Joes Homemade tortillas, their 12 oz salsa verde, and sharp cheddar. I had 2 large chicken breasts, instead of 3, but it was 1 1/3 lbs. I sprinkled them lightly with garlic salt and onion powder and broiled them on a foil lined sheet. They were done in the time it took me to mix up the rest of the ingredients. I used all the ingredients, but the green chilis as the salsa verde already included them and was 12 oz. I covered and baked as suggested, but didnt do the second bake uncovered. I baked the after preparing instead of 12 hours later. I am glad, because the bottoms were already slightly soggy. That wouldnt have been good. I think these taste similar to the pulled chicken enchiladas at Chuys. They are a little salty, but not unexpected with the soup. I would make these again when wanting to save time. I recalculated the calories, as made above, and it came to 216 calories each.
