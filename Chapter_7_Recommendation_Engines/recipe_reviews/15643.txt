Very good if you make the changes suggested in the reviews.  I’m rating this low because if you make it as is there is not nearly enough fruit and the topping becomes like a hard crust because of too much butter.  So, I made the same changes everyone else recommended:  DOUBLE THE FRUIT to 6 cups (I used about 4 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries).  For the topping I added 1 tsp SALT as well as ¼ tsp ALLSPICE.  And definitely use only ½ CUP BUTTER if you want the crumbly topping shown in the picture.  I made it both ways so I feel confident with these changes.  I did not increase the sugar when I added more fruit and it was sweet enough (rhubarb should have a slight sour).  I made this ahead so I could serve a warm desert and it was great.  I hade the fruit mixture refrigerated in the baking dish and I just kept the topping separate until it was time to put in the oven.  I baked it as directed before I wanted to serve it and topped with vanilla ice cream while it was still warm, yum.  I had many requests for the recipe and many rave reviews.  Hope this helps – happy baking!

I made several changes based on other reviews.  I increased the rhubarb to 6C and added an extra tablespoon of flour to the fruit to thicken it a bit better.  I also cut the butter to 3/4C and added a bit of salt and cinnamon to the topping.  Otherwise I left the recipe the same.  It turned out pretty good with these changes...a good proportion of fruit to topping and a nice combination of sweetness and tartness.  The low rating is because the recipe needed to be changed in the first place..."as is" this recipe wouldn't have enough fruit and 1C of butter seemed excessive.  In my opinion if a recipe has to be altered this much then it is not deserving of such a high rating.

I altered this one. I increased rhubarb to 6 cups, the sugar by half a cup and then added a pint of strawberries and a peach, which really adds to the overall flavor. Everyone went nuts over this one. Our house came with an 80 year old rhubarb plant, this was the first recipie I tried for it. Will be making this one, again!

This is a fantastic rhubarb recipe. I own a small restaurant and this dessert was a huge hit with my customers!  I took other reviewers advice and increased the amount of rhubarb to 6 cups and the sugar to 2 cups. The combination was perfect, tart but not too tart and the wonderful sweet topping was just the right balance.

Only gave it 5 stars after following other people's suggestions and it was super delish!  I used 6 cups rhubarb and 1/2 cup raspberries and 1 and 1/4 cup white sugar and it was still PLENTY sweet.  Also, I only had 1/2 cup butter so I decreased the flour to 1 cup and the topping turned out perfectly yummy.  There was still lots of topping compared to fruit, so I wouldn't make it with only 3 cups fruit!

I had to read the reviews again and felt some were unfair,Yes I did add more rhubarb only because I love the stuff and I did lower the sugar because I love the tart flavor of rhubarb.I use to pull it out of my grandparents garden ,rinse it off and I had sour candy before they came out with sweet tarts, The tops are thick and that is a personal thing,as with the amount of butter and sugar,as for adding other berries to it,it then becomes strawbery rhubarb crunch and not rhubarb crunch. When you change a recipe to your own taste and ideals of what you like should'nt take away from someones recipes. There will always be changes in recipes even though handled down from moms to their children.

Carolyn- This is a wonderful recipe! I did read some of the reviews and its unfortunate that some of the 1 star reviews show up at the top. After reading the 1 star review, I believe they should be removed only because this recipe says RHUBARB CRUNCH, NOT RHUBARB STRAWBERRY CRUNCH.  Just a note to people leaving reviews. Rating someone's recipe low because you did not follow it, is just plain not nice. There is no call for strawberries because it is not strawberry rhubarb crunch... Duh! 
We made this and it turned out perfect! The topping was perfect, even like the picture. Not sure why other "cooks" had such a difficult time? Oh well, everyone is a critic. 5 stars all the way, I love the tart with a hint of sweet and obviously by looking at the recipe, this is what it is supposed to taste like. Everyone I shared the dessert with loved it! Thank you for sharing this with us. Wouldn't change a thing on this RHUBARB Crunch! :)

I made this recipe using the some of the recommendations; doubled the fruit, halved the topping, and it turned out great!!  I used 1 1/2 c sugar, and it was tart, just the way I like it.  I would definitely make it again.

All I can say about this one is.....YUM, YUM, YUM! I made it last night for my mom that likes rhubarb and....she loved it! Even my little one gobbled it up. The only changes I made was to use a 9x9 pan and I added an additional 1 1/2 cups of rhubarb and about a 1/2 cup more sugar and it was perfect! I will be making this one....again and again  :)

This was gorgeous, but the only problem was i thought there was too much sugar. next time i will decrease the amount of sugar to half the amount?

i added twice the amount of rhubarb because there would have definately been way too much topping otherwise.

it certainly went down well in my household. thanx for the recipe.

I would have given this recipie 5 stars if it would have had the suggestions from previous reviewers.  As it is written, I have not made it.  I did make this-  I used 4 cups of rhubarb and 12 oz. frozen strawberries, I also increased the flour to 4 T.  I made the crust as is and served it with vanilla ice cream.  It was a huge hit and I am making it again, 2 days later!

I made this recipe a second time using some fresh peaches.  It was great.

As long as you adjust the amounts of rhubarb (double it) and topping (less of it depending on the size dish you use and to your liking) to balance the two, this is 5-star excellent. We love the combination of rhubarb and strawberries, so I used part strawberries in this recipe, reducing the sugar somewhat to compensate.

As written, this recipe is too sweet for my taste, and I also prefer a greater fruit to crisp ratio.  Here are the measurements I use to make a very tasty crisp!  "Inside" of crisp: 4 cups rhubarb, 2 cups frozen strawberries, 1 cup sugar, 4 Tbsp flour.    Topping: 1 cup oats, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup butter, pinch of salt.

This recipe was divine WITHOUT any modifications. I made it at work for a potluck and everyone loved it. It was so easy and the ratio of fruit to topping was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

As written, I would be extremely unhappy with the way this recipe would have turned out.  Luckily, I read others' reviews, and more than doubled the fruit (6 cups rhubarb, and about 1/2 lb strawberries.)  I also added an extra couple of tbsp of flour to thicken, and added some cinnamon to the crumb mixture (which was great, by the way).  Even if you love the topping, (which we do!) making it the original way the recipe states would be way too little fruit.  Either way, everyone at my BBQ loved it served with sweetened fresh whipped cream.  YUM!

I made this exactly as the recipe says to and it turned out great, everyone loved it. If you really love rhubarb then you could easily add more fruit, but I don't think it's necessary.

Oh my gosh!!!  This is Excellent!  I took others advice and used 5-6 cups of rhubarb (frozen, drained), 1 1/2 Cups of sugar, then added about 1/4 tsp. of salt in the topping.  This was the best!  There is plenty of topping....and we love it that way.  I baked it in an old 8 x 12 glass pan that was my Grandmas (she would heartily approve!), and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe Carolyn....my husband, and the rest of my family, say it's AWESOME!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars for MY VERSION. Here are the modifications I made: For the filling, I used about 6 cups of rhubarb and about 1-1/2 cups very ripe fresh strawberries. I used 1/2 c. white sugar and probably could have gone with 1/3 c. I used 4 T. flour. For the crunch: 1 c. brown sugar, 1 c. oats, 1 c. flour, 1/2 c. Earth Balance spread, 1 tsp. cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. salt. I used an 8X8 glass dish and baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  Everyone raved about this!! My 12 yo son, who has never had rhubarb before and is NOT a big dessert eater, loved this. He said that if there had been more sugar, he wouldn't have been able to eat more than a bite. No one could believe it was Earth Balance in the crunch and not real butter.  Don't be afraid to play around with this recipe. I could easily have added more fruit without changing anything else. Use less sugar than you might think and don't be afraid to substitute ingredients. It will still turn out delicious!

Followed other reviews and used 6 cups rhubarb plus 4 T flour, but also added 1 cup blackberries and one chopped, peeled apple. Used the recipe's topping measurements, but added 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, plus used a mix of whole wheat pastry flour and all purpose flour for topping.   I didn't like the blackberries or the apples I added so next time I would just use rhubarb.  **The topping was fantastic after I added the salt, cinnamon, and nuts-I didn't think there was too much butter.  The softness of the butter affects the topping texture.  My butter was not melted, but really soft. Thanks for the basic recipe and thanks to the reviewers for their suggestions!

FANTASTIC RECIPE... if you alter it... which is the reason I only give it one star. Someone should submit this in altered form because you definitely need at least 6 cups of rhubarb and I used less sugar and less butter.

This is a good recipe IF you  make the changes suggested but NOT if you use the full amount of salt suggested in the changes.  It is MUCH too salty that way and my whole family commented that it was tasty but much too salty.

I feel like the ratio of topping to fruit is too high.  This tastes more like oatmeal and butter than rhubarb.

This is so delicious!  I would recommend, though adding more rhubarb or even strawberries and decreasing the butter a bit.  I will definitely be making it again and again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

As with other reviewers, I increased the rhubarb to 6 cups. (FYI, I used frozen rhubarb and it worked perfectly.) I think I could increase it even further next time. You do not need to add any more sugar to the mix. I used the full amount of better suggested in the original recipe and was extremely happy with the crunchy crust it produced. Definitely a keeper.

You need to change it to 6 cups of rhubarb.  I like to double the topping but cut the butter in half.  it is a very wonderful crust with salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  I like to use this topping for apple crisp.

Delicious! I used 3 cups rhubarb AND 3 cups peaches. I stuck w/ the recommended 1 cup sugar & 1 cup butter & it came out beautifully! Perfect amount of topping. I did add a pinch of salt to the fruit mixture AND the topping though (as salt helps to bring out all the other flavors). I baked mine a tad bit longer - 50 minutes. I served it w/ a scoop of low-fat vanilla ice cream - it was heaven in my mouth! Thanks!

I love the fact that the crunch topping is so plentiful!  However, I also increased the amount of rhubarb.  It was a big hit with my family, and I've made it several times this summer.

I absolutely love this recipe for a rhubarb only crisp. 1 cup of butter is too much for the topping. It is much better reduced to 3/4 cup butter.

This was my first taste of rhubarb. I only had enough to half the recipe. I thought it was AWESOME!  Rhubarb is my new favorite. This is a great recipe. My husband asked for more but since I only had half the amount, he didnt get seconds. I beat him to it. Reheats great.

This recipe is FIVE stars with the following revisions:  double the rhubarb, add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt.  Chopped walnuts would also be a nice addition.  This recipe is now in my family's all-time favorites cookbook.

I thought this was good, but like everyone else said the proportions are way off.  I used 6 cups of rhubarb instead of three and that still wasn't enough in my books.  Talking to my mother, she said that she always used twelve, which is what I'll do in the future. There was just not enough rhubarb.  But the topping was good. Next time I'll add 12 cups of rhubarb and probably 1 and half the topping.  If it wasn't for the wrong proportions I would have given it five stars.

I increased the rhubarb to 6 cups like many others and may add even a little more next time. Everything else I followed exactly. This was very good.

Perfect. One of the best rhubarb crisp recipies I've found. Good ratio of fruit to topping (many have too much topping) and topping actually came out with a bit of a crunch (like it should) instead of soft like a cobler.

It was very tasty but I didn't let my butter soften on its own, I put it in the microwave quick and the warm butter made the topping soggy instead of crispy. I won't do that again but I will make the recipe again, in a smaller baking dish because this was really thin. Very good with ice cream and cool whip!

I had to double the amount of fruit and cut the amount of butter in the topping to less than half. This recipe wasn't proportioned very well, but if you follow the adjustments it will be fine.

I give this a four star with changes.  I took everyone's suggestions and cut the sugar in half and added twice as much rhubarb.  I also added about 2 cups of sweetened strawberries. A little cinnamon to the topping is great.  I thought this turned out great!  My husband thought it was a little tart, but he and the kids have been eating it up.  I will definitely make this again!

I ended up with way too much topping, but I had a deep, round dish instead of a long, shallow one.  But this was scrumptious!  It is amazing still warm, with vanilla ice cream, but it is also great chilled.  I doubled the rhubarb, used 1 1/4 c. white sugar and added a pint of fresh strawberries.  I used frozen rhubarb, but thawing it in the oven for five minutes before using it helped.  Good recipe!
Made again: 1 Lb each of rhubarb and strawberries, 1 cup sugar, half the topping...and it is still delicious, though a little more tart.  Yum!

Well -- I upped the rhubarb to 8 cups and added some chopped walnuts to the topping -- it's fabulous and friends think I should bring it to all pot-lucks when the fruit is in season.   A topping of whipped cream or vanilla yogurt adds an extra dimension.

This was very good, I used 6 C. rhubard and 2 C. sugar plus 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I also sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on the top.  My husband loves rhubard so it was fun to try something new.

I spent many summers in Sweden when I grew up and this recipe reminds me of those summers with my grandma!  This is a great recipe, but I did in fact follow the suggestions to increase the Rhubarb to 6 cups and I added just a bit of salt (1/4 tsp) as well to offset the tartness a little!  Fantastic with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.

I used 5 cups of rubarb and almost one pound of strawberries.  I kept all the other ingredients the same.  I though it would be enough for at least two dinners worth of desserts, but it disappeared as a bedtime snack for kids and hubbie.  Excellent cruchie topping!

This disappeared pretty quickly at work this morning.  I took other reviewers' suggestions and used 6 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of sugar.  I'm glad I did that, otherwise the topping would have been too much for half the amount of rhubarb.

This was pretty good.  I took the advise of the other reviewers and used 6 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups of sugar.  I think 1 1/2 cups of sugar would have been enough.  I also think this would be better with some strawberries or something to add some flavor other than just rhubarb.

I followed directions except used 5 cups of rhubarb and extra sugar. My complaint would be that there is too much butter in the topping. One stick is plenty. I could have easily used more rhubarb too.

This is the rhubarb crunch recipe I grew up with.  The only change I made was to cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and add a small package of jello to the rhubarb, I also added a cup more rhubarb.

As the recipe is written, there is a very, very small amount of rhubarb layer compared to the topping.  I tried doubling the rhubarb layer (and only added 1.5 cups white sugar instead of 2), and liked it really well that way.  Though the rhubarb filling would have been fine if it had been thicker.  Honestly, I think the filling could have even been tripled and turned out fine.

This is delicious.  I made it with the suggestions everyone else made.  Next time I am going to make it in a smaller pan. 8X8 instead.  It was a little thin but the taste was excellent!

Never used or tasted rhubarb - but this was a winner for ages 3 to 73!!  I ran short on rhubarb and supplimented with 2 granny smith apples (diced).  Used all other recipe notes, but ran short on butter - only had 3/4 cup which was perfectly fine.  Looking for a way to use this item and it was a HIT!

Just made this again to treat my co-workers, as I had some fresh rhubarb. I used 6 cups of rhubarb as another reviewer had suggested, but didn't change anything else!  Everyone loved it, as usual! Quick & easy recipe!  (BTW: it tastes wonderful eaten warm with a small scoop of strawberry-cheesecake ice cream on top! just sayin'...)

I've not made this recipe and I generally don't like those who rate without the work....but I'm just making a comment in general. I usually never add more than 3/4 C sugar to a fruit recipe and I use cornstarch instead of flour. In a crumble don't forget that you already have sugar in your topping and that ups your sweetness as well. Rhubard is meant to be somewhat tart but everyone to their own taste.

I was given a boat load of rhubarb and decided to try this recipe and donated it back to the person giving the rhubarb. The Crunch was so fantastic they said it was the best tasting ever!  I made a few changes to the recipe...Instead of using refined white sugar I used Pure Cane sugar. I switched the regular flour for Spelt and instead of brown sugar I used Coconut Palm Sugar.  I left all the amounts the same.  The results were purely outstanding! I will definitely make this again. I have some rhubarb left in my freezer. It will make for a wonderful last minute dessert.

The low rating is for the recipe being wrong in the first place, how this ever got approved is beyond me. If you were to make it as is, you'd have barely any fruit and a whole lot of really crispy crust.  As suggested, I increased the amount of rhubarb to 6 cups, added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and an extra tablespoon of flour to the fruit.  To the crust I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp salt (just like my apple crisp recipe).  Beyond adding the spices and salt, I left the amount of butter the same. I think if you were to cut the butter, it'd be way too dry and apt to burn, rather than caramelize the sugar and sort of melt onto the rhubarb.  After reworking the recipe, it tastes great.

Very nice recipe!  I increased the rhubarb from 3 cups to 8 cups, decreased the white sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 cup, and used a baking dish slightly smaller than 13x9.  The amount of topping was perfect.  I'll have fun experimenting more with this one!

Solid recipe, made a few changes. Per other reviews: doubled the fruit (I used 4 c. rhubarb, 2 c. strawberries); added heaping 1/4 tsp. allspice and 1 tbsp. salt to topping. I actually used the topping recipe from Apple Crisp II, so mine was 1:1:1:1/2 oats:flour:dark brown sugar, and I used 1.5 c. each (and 3/4 c. butter). I think in future I'll only use 1 c. each (and 1/2 c. butter). ***UPDATE: I tried the original topping recipe and it came out really powdery with only 1/2 c. butter. If you want the thicker "crunch" topping that the recipe calls for, you really need the full cup of butter to make it work. I also used 5 c. rhubarb, 1 c. strawberry, 1/2 c. sugar and it was nice and tart.

My 'crunch' actually came out fabulous, but I changed it- thus the 4 stars. I used about 2 cups rhubarb and added a small bag of frozen raspberries & about 2 cups of frozen peaches to. I still ended up with about 1/2 the recipe of the crunch 'stuff' that I didn't use! But my goodness, it tasted fantastic! I will now use this new/revised recipe as my fruit crunch! (I can't imagine using all of the flour mixture with so little rhubarb!)

I made this with a couple of my friends and it turned out great!  we did change it a little, we put 4 cups of rhubarb instead of 3, just because thats how much we had, and we wanted to use it all up.  we also added a little bit of cinnomon to the topping.

Deliciously addictive!  I DOULBED THE AMOUNT OF RHUBARB, however, which seems to be a better ratio of smooth and crunchy textures.  This is our family's favorite way to use the abundant rhubarb from our garden...plus it's a fast and easy dessert with little preparation.  YUMMY!!!!

The taste was great--but I thought that there was way too much topping in comparison to the actual fruit. I will make this again--but I'll probably halve the amount of crisp.

I am a huge rhubarb fan and this recipe is an awesome way to use rhubarb!  This was the first time I made this so I didn't change the recipe at all.  There is enough rhubarb, but depending on the mood next time, I might add more.  I'll probably cut the butter to cut some calories and fat down too, but if you're not watching calories, I wouldn't change it.  Great recipe...will be made again and again in my home!

I used about four cups of rhubarb, kept the sugar at one cup, and added a can of pineapple tidbits.  It was good.

Next time I'll put a pinch of salt in the topping.  It tasted a little flat.

This was just ok but I had to make too many changes to it, which to me makes it not such a good choice to make.  Some recipes are made to be tweaked with..adding your favorite ingredients and such, but this one shouldn't have to be messed around with (sugar, amount of fruit, etc.)  I'll look for another similar recipe.

Good!  This is much like something we have been making for years and it is the best (in my opinion) and simplest way to use up rhubarb.  However, I cannot give 5 stars to a recipe that tells you to use half the fruit you really need...I made this in a 8x8 square pan, and the fruit was just enough to make a layer with plenty (though not any extra) topping, following measurements exactly.

Very Good. The first time I added 3/4 cup butter...which was way too much. Second time...1/2 cup of butter (it's in the oven now and smells good :). I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it...because I would of added at least 1 more cup of rhubarb.

This recipe is fast and easy. The only thing I would do differently next time, is add an extra cup of rhubarb or maybe even a cup of strawberries. I found there was too much topping for the amount of fruit used. Other than that it was fantastic, especially when warmed and served with vanilla ice cream.

Very good. I used 6 1/2 cups of rhubarb, threw in a can of sliced peaches (drained), and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups for the rhubarb mixture. For the "crunch" part, I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla (maybe a teaspoon of each), and reduced the butter to about 3/4 cup, which worked out fine. I used frozen rhubarb, and the consistency was nice--soft but not mushy. It's pretty sweet; one could use 1 cup of sugar if they want it a bit more tart. There's quite a bit of the crunchy part, too. Could halve it, depending on your tastes.

I received this exact recipe from my sister-in-law many years ago.  I was always squeamish about rhubarb (remember it as a nasty, stringy cooked vegetable as a kid - or as I remember my dad referring to it as "pond scum") so I was really afraid to try this.  Boy, was I surprised.  I agree with other reviewers, however, that it could use more rhubarb, like another cup or two.  You definitely taste more of the sweet crunchy top than the tartness of the rhubarb.  Definitely a keeper though and an easy dish to whip up.

Really easy to make. The layer of rhubarb seemed a little thin, but it worked out just right.
I added extra flour to the topping which made it crumble better and also a little
ground cinnamon, which gave it a warm flavour. My work collegues definately 
approved! Will make again

I made this recipe with frozen rhubarb and used the whole bag (about 5 cups). I found that three cups of the frozen rhubarb was not enough to cover the bottom of the pan so I used the whole bag. I also used only 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup flour. Next time I may decrease some of the brown sugar as well.  Despite all these adjustments the recipe came out great and I will definitely make it again.

This is a basic recipe that needs some tweaking to your preference. Personally, we love the tartness of rhubarb, I reduced the sugar in both parts. I picked and diced 10 lbs of rhubarb. I doubled the recipe to make 4 cake pans as gifts. The measurements I used were: 3 cups rolled oats, 3 cups flour, 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup melted butter, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp powdered vanilla. For the rhubarb 18 cups (4.5 lbs) diced rhubarb, 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup flour. I baked in my convection oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Served with vanilla ice cream

This was the best Rhubarb Crisp (Crunch) recipe!  I tweaked it a little bit, using 4 cups of rhubarb and 4 tablespoons of flour, and it was delightful.  This one is saved as one of our new favorites!!  Thank you for sharing this one!!

Carolyn, this was fantastic! I didn't listen to any of the other reviewers' suggestions for changes, and I made it simply as you directed. It was exactly what I wanted: a lovely blend of tart and sweet with a perfect crumble texture and flavour! I'm even going to use your crumble ingredients ratio for all of my fruit crisp recipes from now on! I agree with the other reviewer Robert T who thinks it's unfair to give a rating of 1 and recommend adding strawberries or peaches to change the flavour. It's a RHUBARB Crisp, and a darn good one at that! It was the first Rhubarb Crisp I've ever made, and I won't need to look any further for a better recipe!

Loved the  crunchy results! Agree that could use more rhubarb, but I loved it anyway. Since I am a fan of tart, I almost always cut out some of the sugar - reduced 1/4 cup white. Ran out of butter (gasp!) so used 1/2 cup coconut oil with the 1/2 cup butter I had. This added a nice flavor and it felt a smidge healthier.

Waaay too much crisp, not enough fruit, too much sugar. I would suggest at LEAST 6 cups rhubarb, half the sugar in the filling, and don't put the full crust on top. Even if you use 6 cups of fruit you might consider a smaller size pan then 9x13 so the filling is thicker.

Didn't work for me.I think it needs double the rhubarb and In addition I added about 4 cups defrosted strawberries. Top was too crumbly even using a full stick of butter, expected more of a crunchy streusel topping.

I followed the advice from previous reviews ad doubled the fruit mixture. SO good! And I'm not typically a rhubarb fan. I've made this recipe a few times and it consistently turns out delicious. I've also experimented throwing in some raspberries or blueberries with the rhubarb, also yummy!

I made this for a family reunion and received raves from everyone! I did make the suggested changes and used 6 cups fruit and only 1/2 c. butter for the topping. Also added a little salt to the topping mix. No changes to any other ingredients. Made two pans--one was all rhubarb and the other was a mix of rhubarb, apple and strawberry. Again, no changes to flour or sugar amounts. Both turned out awesome. This one goes into my recipe box as a keeper!

Wonderful!  I only had 3 cups of rhubarb so I cut the topping in half and baked it in a smaller pan.  Added a dash of cinnamon and 1/4 c. chopped pecans to the topping.  It was fantastic.  And so easy!

I also used 6 cups rhubarb, 2 cups sugar, 5 T flour. For the topping I added cinnamon.  I put some of the topping on the bottom of the pan. I would use less butter. Maybe 1/2 or 3/4 cup of butter next time.

EXCELLENT!!! I did use 6 cups of rhubarb, increased the flour from 3 T to 5 T and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (part brown because it sounded good).

Next time I'd make with double the rhubarb filling.  I made it with only 1 stick butter, topping a bit dry but still very good.

As is, there is way too much topping for the amount of filling.  Was very tasty though.  I substituted Gluten free flour and it turned out very well.  Next time would for sure double the fruit.

If you are looking for a rhubarb dessert where rhubarb is the absolute star....this might not be the one for you. This recipe is more about the "CRUNCH"! I was short on time so I melted the butter and stirred it in, verses cutting it in, and it still turned out great. If you plan on serving it warm, you might want to add a little more flour to thicken it up. Other that that I thought it was a fine recipe.

I made this and the only change I made was to cut the oatmeal topping ingredients in half. It was very delightful. Thank you so much for sharing it with us all. And thanks to the person who said she made it with peaches. I'm going to try that and blackberries next. YUMMMMM

I agree with previous reviews about not enough fruit. However I did make the recipe the way it is on here. Because I wanted to see what it was like. The verdict is YES needs more fruit. One thing for sure is that the taste is GREAT!!

Very sweet, but good. I followed some suggestions and only put 1/2 C of butter in the topping and it wasn't enough. Maybe 3/4 C would be better. I also added a little cinnamon to the topping and about 3/4 C of sugar. I only had 3 C of rhubarb so I baked this in a 8x8 inch pan. It fit perfectly, but there was a lot of topping - which is my favorite part.

perfectly awesome with rhubarb doubled and an extra tablespoon of flour...don't miss out on this one!  The brown sugar coupled with the rhubarb makes it hard to eat just one portion.

Very good! Like others, I added extra rhubarb and added cinnamon to the topping, but next time I would substitute splenda for probably half the sugar in both the rhubarb and the crust.  I'd also probably try whole wheat flour to make it just a little better. Yummy though!

Apparently the only times I make dessert - is for a church dinner...This got lots of compliments. I didn't have time to go to the store - and just started to use up the rhubarb in my freezer - but I didn't have enough. After reading the reviews, to make up the six cups, I ended up with: rhubarb, strawberries and peaches(2-2-2). Cinnamon and Allspice also went into the crumble. This came out great. It seems like no matter what you throw into this dish, it will come out great! Enjoy playing with this recipe, and thank you Carolyn for sharing!

I thought this was really good.  I increased rhubarb to 6 cups, and 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I could have used a little more sugar, I don't know if it was more sour because it was the first pick of the year or what it was.  I thought this was one of the best rhubarb recipes I have tried.

This was a great recipe.  After reading other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that the ratio of fruit to crunch is a personal preference.  I would say use this recipe as a base and modify it to your taste.  I used 5c of rhubarb made the topping as directed.   The flavor and texture of the crunch part is great.

Remembering that my mom loves rhubarb, though I've never had rhubarb crunch, I knew there had to be such a thing, so I settled on this one from allrecipes. It's awesome! As many reviewers recommmend, go with six cups of rhubarb and only 1/2 cup of butter, which provides more than adequate butter flavor for the cruch level. My only (minor) complaint is that the crunch level turned out thicker than expected. Next time, I may only use enough crunch mixture to create a thin layer, so it is not as thick as it was this time. Great recipe!

My family loved it! I (with the exception of using more rhubarb, because I didn't want to waste the extra that I had) used the exact amounts of each ingredient.  However, because of my daughter having a little softball injury I had to let my topping sit for a while.  This of course because of the butter looked more like plain old dough instead of a crumbly topping and not wanting to waste the ingredients I'd already used spread it on top of the rhubarb and it actually turned out perfect.  For those that mentioned using the amount of butter in the recipe didn't make a crunchy topping this did when mixed more like dough.

This recipe is ok, only one thing, like the others have said, you really have to modify the ammount of rhubarb and butter you put in. It is also a great idea to put in about 1/4 tsp of all spice and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I am not a rhubarb fan, probaly wont make this again.

With the modifications this recipe was great.  I doubled the fruit, and added 1 cup of packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar for the filling.  I should of left it at 1 cup as that is plenty.  I also added about 2/3 cup of butter like some suggested.  Personally I think it needs the full cup as it was slightly dry.  Great, simple recipe and I'll make this one again.

Like the other reviews said, the proportions are way off.  I used six cups or rhubarb, and it I make this again I will double that to 12.  However, I really liked mixing the flour with the rhubarb.  This makes a great topping for oatmeal!

I, too, halved the butter on this recipe and upped the rhubarb (to approx. 4.5 cups) and it was delicious!! Everyone in our family loved it and I will be making this again!

Very good--followed suggestion to use 6 cups of rhubarb. I did not increase the white sugar, but added 1/2 cup of candied ginger to the rhubarb mixture.  Also used 1 stick of butter rather than 1 cup and that was plenty. Will definitely make this again.

I love rhubarb and am always looking for new recipes. For this recipe, however, I didn't have enough rhubarb so I added 3 cups peaches and this dessert turned out perfectly. My family LOVED the way the topping crunched! Great job Carolyn.

i made it first the way the recipe said.. with the exception of adding more rhubarb.. i found it to be alittle bit runny but worthy of a second try.. I used a 10x10 square pan instead of the 13x9, added 3 cups raspberries 2 cups blueberries, with the 3 cups of rhubarb. sprinkled tapioca liberally over the flour and sugar mix with the fruit, added hint.. sugar free black cherry jello mix with the sugar.. didn't run as tasty as tasty can be.. with the zing of the rhubarb tartness..

I think this should be called Major Topping with a little rhubarb.  The recipe proportions are way off in my opinion.  The rhubarb mixture needs to be doubled as others said and the topping mixture halved.  I did not think this was anything extraordinary; I will not be making again.  There is another rhubarb crisp recipe on this site with cooked rhubarb filling that is much better in my opinion.

This is such a great basic recipe: I found that if I altered the ingredients, ie., less sugar, more fruit, various types of fruit -- it always comes out delicious.  A real winner.

Pleasant surprise here.  I didn't have any more than 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb but thought I'd try this recipe anyway.  Instead of the 9 x 13 pan, I used an 8 x 12.5 glass pan and baked at 350 F.  I also cut back a wee bit on all the other ingredients too.  The rhubard looked really skimpy sitting on the bottom of the pan and the topping looked like too much.  But....when it was done, it was delicious!  I can see how using more rhubarb would be nice but it was still very nice with less rhubarb too.

One more review can't hurt, right?  This recipe was very good.  I did use more rhubarb, plus a can of cherries.  Everyone in my family loved it.  My husband thought it was perfect, but I would have made the crust a little less sweet--I found that it overpowered that nice rhubarb tang.

I used a smaller baking dish (10 x 10) and the next time I will probably use a little more rhubarb.  But it was great.  We just moved to this location and found a small rhubarb patch growing.  Great to go out and pick the fresh rhubarb and cook it up right away.  Now I am off to find some more recipes.
This recipe was easy, fun and delicious.

A friend of ours lets me pick rhubarb from his farm for free whenever I need some.  I found this recipe and made 1 pan each for him and his grown granddaughter.  They both refused to share with anyone else!!  They loved it and so does my kids.  I bake each one in a small glass casserole dish so there is more crunchy top for it!!!

This is a great recipe if you just like a little taste of rhubarb.  I think when I make it next time I will increase the rhubarb mixture in the bottom layer.  But overall it was great!

Most people turn up their nose at rhubarb
anything!  I have grown up with it and

Very tasty.  I used a fair bit more rhubarb than the recipe called for (about 8 cups) and it was great!

This is good once you adjust the amounts, or size of pan! I used 4 cups of rhubarb in an 8 x 8. There is no way less filling would 'work' in a larger pan, as written.

As I write this review my rhubarb is plotting to overthrow the squash and tomatoes in my garden. In other words, I have a lot of rhubarb and am always on the lookout for recipes that only use rhubarb. I have made this dessert several times and it is the one crisp dessert my husband requests as he prefers pie. I also double the amount of rhubarb called for in the recipe, use the same amount of sugar, and use half the amount of topping, which is personal preference. The proportions of ingredients in the topping is excellent no matter how much you should decide to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My mother made this all the time when I was growing up in the Midwest. This recipe perfectly recreates the crunch and sweet-tart I remember.  My husband loves it too, as well as the FedEx and UPS drivers, and our letter carrier.  Guess another rhubarb crunch is in our near future!

This was great. I did bake it in a 9 x 9 pan as it was just not that much rhubarb I felt for a 9 x 13. I actually mixed the 1st part the night before and something happened so I couldn't finish it. The next afternoon I peeked at the rhubarb mix and it was quite watery. I figured it'd be fine as the oats would soak up that liquid which it did. I cut the topping part in 1/2 as I was using a smaller pan. Turned out great. Husband loved it.

I saw the surface excellent rating and had nearly finished when I noticed that the first couple of reviews were not strong. Read on and doubled the rhubarb and cut the butter in half. Enjoyed and will make again.

I was working from a printed out recipe but remembered that this didn’t turn out great when I made it last year. Glad I thought to check the comments online. I was already committed on the amount of rhubarb, so I switched to an 8 x 8 pan, halved the butter, and reduced the amount of crumble overall. Now it looks perfect. Just wanted to add this review because doubling the amount of rhubarb isn’t something most of us can do on the fly, so switching to a smaller pan is a good alternative. Only two stars because, well, doubling the amount of rhubarb isn’t something most of us can do on the fly.

This is a very easy recipe to put together. I used gluten free flour and non-dairy shortening.  've served it twice and people loved it. 
I made one change the second time. I drained the liquid that accumulates under the raw rhubarb-sugar mixture, thickened it with a little cornstarch and folded it back into the rhubarb before spreading it on the bottom crumble. This prevented the juice from soaking into the crumble , keeping the crumble more crisp and the rhubarb layer more distinct. Either way, it's delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly and the product was delicious. The topping was thick and crunchy and the filling had a tarty sweetness. The only change I will make next time is to double the filling. With all the rhubarb we have growing we gotta use it up.

My mother made a great rhubarb pie, my pies not so great.  When we sold her house, we transplanted some rhubarb to our backyard.  It grew really well, and we never used it all.  I discovered this recipe a few years ago, and now we always use or freeze all of it.  

I doubled the amount of rhubarb because we love it.  I have also reduced the butter and flour in the crunchand doubled the oats.  As another reviewer said, those are personal preferences.  this is a great recipe!

Sorry, not a fan of this Recipe...Made following the recipe, I found an absence of rhubarb to the amount of "crunch" topping...a bit too much butter, also.

This is a great recipe.  I agree with all the people defending this recipe, it is fine the way it is.  I made mine with margarine instead of butter because I’m lactose intolerant and it still worked out great.  My family loved it and it is now my go to rhubarb crumble recipe.

I made the recipe as written except for increasing the amount of rhubarb (only because I had a little more than 3 cups frozen in the same bag). My husband and I loved the super thick crunch on top and the tart/sweet balance was just right.

This was delicious the only change I made was to cut back to one cup of bleach to 3/4 cup. That's only because I like a more tart flavor and find most any rhubarb crisp recipe to have more sweetness than I like. My whole family prefers more tartness. I guess it's just the way mom used to make it. :) But I do like some of the ideas here and me add a little cinnamon to the topping in the future, maybe add a little vanilla. Just because it's fun to play with flavors sometimes. It's nice that the recipe is flexible enough to allow you to add your own flair and personalize it to your taste.

Family ate it in one night!  Wonderful but I used about 5 cups rhubarb and also used the old fashioned oats. Tasted perfect with vanilla ice cream.

I loved this recipe, and I did change it as some other people had suggested, added six cups total of fruit two cups of raspberries from my garden and four cups of rhubarb. I lowered the flower to one cup only used a half cup of butter and I did use one and one quarter cup of sugar which made it a little too sweet I think so next time it will be one cup and I think it will be perfect! This is a super recipe I've seen many times very similar and is the essence of spring than summer

I loved this recipe and didn't alter it aside from adding cinnamon to the topping.  I used about six large stalks of celery which may have amounted to more than 3 cups that the recipe called for.  I also baked it in a square pan but used the whole recipe of the topping so it was very thick, which I prefer.  It almost was like having a delicious oatmeal cookie on top of the rhubarb.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I am baffled why so many people had complaints about the recipe as it was originally written.  I thought it was great!

Just the recipe I was looking for! Only thing I did differently is add 4 cups of rhubarb. There is plenty of the sugar to accommodate the extra rhubarb and my husband and I prefer rhubarb dessert more tart. Nice crunchy topping.

Super easy to throw together. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the rhubarb mixture. Looking forward to it cooling a wee bit before digging in however, if the smell is any indication it will be delicious.

I followed others' suggestions and added double sugar and double Rhubarb, because I like a lot of fruit in  my crisps, but I think it could have been very good made as originally posted.  I absolutely LOVED this.  Even all of my kids liked it, and typically they are not rhubarb fans.  Probably because it is tart and they don't like tart.  The amount of sugar DOES cut down on the tart (but does not eliminate it) so if you want more tart, just cut back a little on the sugar.  I love a lot of topping, so the fact that this was "topping heavy" made me happy.  Also, the amount of butter in the topping was just fine.  Great recipe and I will DEFINITELY make again.  I have several large Rhubarb plants in the office building I purchased a couple years ago and always looking for good Rhubarb recipes so all that yummy rhubarb doesn't go to waste.

I made this last night for dessert. It was delicious,  however I reduced the sugar in the oat and flour mixture to 1/3 of a cup and next time I would reduce the sugar in the rhubarb mixture by half .. I found it all a bit too sweet. Easy recipe and will make it again.

Turned out wonderful! I've never used rhubarb before but remember my Mom used to make a pie so I had to give it a try. I didn't have enough rhubarb to make a pie so I looked and this recipe sounded good. There was only about 2/3 of the rhubarb required. I cut all the ingredients down to 2/3 and uses a 9×9 pan. The fruit still looked a little lacking. Other reviews suggested several different kinds of fruit to add. I had a can of peaches. I drained the juice and mixed them into the rhubarb. Still using the 9×9 pan. It turned out perfect!

It was very good, with the suggested alterations. I used 6 cups rhubarb,  1 cup sugar, about 4-5 TBSP flour. Then I sprinkled by hand a few small handfuls of brown sugar over the rhubarb. 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 cup oats, about  half cup soft butter, made up the topping.  It was very good with ice cream.

This is the best rhubarb crisp recipe I have found.  But you do need to increase the amount of rhubarb.  I generally use about 5 cups.

It was tasty, we changed it up a bit did 3 cups of rhubarb and 3 cups of apple to cut down on the additional sugar.  Tasted great, I think next time we will make the same amount in a smaller dish or add more fruit to the 9x13.  The seemed to be more crunch than rhubarb.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I melter the butter before mixing it in because my butter was frozen and it came out delicious. I made it in a round glass dish that allowed the topping to be quite thick and remain moist.

I added 8 cups of chopped rhubarb , 6 tablespoons of flour (4 white and 2 wheat) and 1 1/3 cups of sugar to the rhubarb.-next time I might add 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  To the topping I added a quarter teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half cup of chopped slightly toasted nuts. I think you could reduce the butter to 1 1/2 sticks or 3/4 cups. That being said, the topping with the original amount of butter is crunchy like the recipe's name. If you only use one stick of butter you may get a good crumble on the top, but it won't be as crunchy.  The crunchy top also stands up better to the moisture from the rhubarb so the topping stays crunchy rather than turning to mush if you keep it overnight.  Don't forget this does NOT have to be refrigerated if you keep it for a couple of days.

First time using this recipe. I had almost 5 cups of chopped rhubarb. Decided to use it all. Didn't add any additional amounts of ingredients. It was DELISHIOUS!  Hubby & I loved it more than the last recipe I used.  Saved this one.

Awesome! Did the double recipe of rhubarb/sugar, and kept topping ingredients the same. Delicious and thick, almost carmelized rhubarb, and crunchy topping, so good, even with GF flour :) Definitely making it again soon!

I used 8 cups of rhubarb as I wanted to use up what I had available (I used a glass 9 x 13 dish and a small rectangular glass dish) I used 1.5 cups of sugar and 4 tablespoons of flour. For the topping I increased the recipe 1.5 times but only used a total of 1 cup of butter as some of the reviews said the original recipe had too much butter. Next time I will use the full amount of butter the recipe calls for. I put in a little extra oat meal along with cinnamon and nutmeg. Even though I only 1.5 timed the topping there was more than enough for the 8 cups of rhubarb mixture. This had good taste and consistency.

Delicious! I reduced the amounts of both the white sugar in the rhubarb and the brown sugar in the crumb mixture from 1 cup to 2/3 cup. The sweetness was perfect. In the crumb mixture, instead of butter I used coconut oil. The next time I make it I will double the amount of rhubarb and halve the amount of crumbs. It tastes super delicious, though.

I used 4 cups of rhubarb because that's what we pulled out of the garden,  this Rhubarb Crisp is just like the one Grandma use to make.  Glad I found it again.

I know this drives some people nuts, but I am reviewing this based on my changes.  I never ever make a recipe as written, and I think that is the case with many people.  I just started chopping up as much rhubarb as I wanted, which ended up being 5.5 cups.  I mixed with 1c sugar and then probably close to 1/2 cup flour.  I don't think these proportions are that fussy, just wing it until you get a nice coat on the rhubarb.  For the topping, I didn't want to do that much butter so only used one stick.  Added pretty close to the called for amounts of dry ingredients...decreased by 25% maybe.  Once again, it looked like my butter was incorporating well, so I figured good enough.  I baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect.  My first attempt at a rhubarb crisp, and it was really tasty.

I really enjoyed it, and did not make the changes recommended in the comments.  I agree with the other commenters for more rhubarb and less topping (even though it is so good).

This is a great recipe! I cut the sugar down quite a bit  down to 1/4 cup since we love tart in our home. I have used this recipe and added various berries for different variations and required additional sugar than the 1/4 cup

This was a great base recipe. The reviews were helpful, but the only change I ended up making was adding more fruit. I use 4 cups rhubarb and two whole apples diced up. It's definitely a sweet dish, but not overbearing. My topping turned out perfectly crunchy. Pop some leftovers in the microwave and it softens it up nicely.

This is wonderful!  So fast and easy to make!  My husband and teenage daughter fight over who ate more. Served warm with vanilla ice cream is the best! The only change I made was to add about 1/2-3/4 cup frozen mixed berries-just to add some color and a touch of berry flavor.

Awesome! I've made this recipe twice, once following the recipe exactly because I think it's only fair, and the second time I added fresh orange rind, and some juice from the orange. Both times it was delicious! I will make it again with and without the orange depending on my mood.  If you don't like tart, then rhubarb isn't for you - I've even thought about adding less sugar, or perhaps just more rhubarb, since I can't get enough of the tart flavor from the rhubarb:)

This brought back great memories and is a wonderful recipe.  I gave it 4 stars as I felt it was too sweet, even after I increased the rhubarb to 8 cups without increasing the sugar. The topping is great yet I followed other's reviews and cut the butter in half.  I felt it looked a little dry so I drizzled on about a Tbsp. of evoo to moisten it a bit.  It got good reviews at morning coffee clutch, with all believing it was a little too sweet yet.  If the next batch of rhubarb changes my mind (I think bigger rhubarb takes less sugar) I will amend this.  thanks and I will use this again and again.

I planned on following others suggestions to double the rhubarb, but I only had 3 cups.  I ended up following the recipe exactly and I am so glad I did.  If you want a rhubarb crisp, double the rhubarb and use less butter.  If you want a delicious cookie-like treat, follow the recipe as written.  It was scrumptious served with cinnamon ice cream.  We even had it for breakfast!

This was good. I followed other's advise and made in a 9x9 pan and used only 3/4c of white sugar. Since I used a smaller pan, I should have cut the amount of the "crisp", but I usually like more anyway so it was fine. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely making it again!

I give it five stars because with the recommended changes it was so delicious! I doubled the fruit (using some strawberries as well) and yet made the same amount of topping as the recipe suggested. I only used 2/3 cup of butter and did add an extra tablespoon of flour. Next time, I might try some different combinations of fruit but otherwise I would make it the same as I did this time. Loved the consistency and the level of sweetness was perfec.

My husband loved this--he almost keeled over when I told him it was rhubarb I cut from our garden on a whim! I used about 8 cups of rhubarb, tons of cinnamon, a sliver of butter dotted on the top, and a few dashes of Angostura orange bitters. 50 mins. A keeper!

I found that this recipe had weird proportions, for my taste.  It didn't seem like enough rhubarb for a 9x13 pan so I added another cup of rhubarb, and 1 cup of butter seemed excessive so I cut in in 1/2.  Tasted ok but I didn't love it.  Plus I would  use less sugar next time, even with the extra rhubarb I added.

I made this recipe with 3 cups rhubarb, but added 3 cups thawed frozen strawberries, added 4 tbsp flour instead of 3, and used 1 and a half cups of sugar instead of 1.  It turned out perfect! Not too sweet and not too tart (which I love)

I loved the flavor and the texture although I would put more crumbs on the side next time and push it down harder as it leaked out a little on the sides.  I used a 9x13 glass pan sprayed with pam non stick spray.  Cooked on "quick bake" instead of regular bake in a gas oven for 35 minutes.  I tried it hot now and its delicious!!  Saved in my recipe box for sure!  Would be great with vanilla ice cream as someone suggested!

I followed the suggestions that others did - 6 cups of rhubarb and 1.5 cups of sugar...and it was divine!  My husband *loves* rhubarb and said this was a definite keeper!  Ice cream or plain.... it always taste like more!

Delicious! I doubled the rhubarb and the flour it was mixed with, but not the sugar.  The topping was made as written.  Next time I will add some cinnamon to the topping.

I tried this recipe as written and even cooked it an extra 5 minutes but the topping never browned and tasted as if it had not been in the oven at all- 1 1/2 C flour and 1. C oatmeal uncooked. I think it was because the rhubard juice is suppose to bubble up but it never did.  The 3 cups of rhubard cooked down to 1/4" at the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan. After reading the 150 comments on this recipe all adding more rhubarb,

We were given some fresh rhubarb so I tried this recipe.  Before starting… I read the reviews and after I prepared the rhubarb… I agreed it needed more fruit.  So from the freezer I took out 3 cups of sliced strawberries unsweetened  and 1 cup of peaches slightly sweetened.  I added the strawberries and peaches to the rhubarb mixture. Then selected a slightly smaller rectangle baking dish so the fruit would be sit higher in the dish.  The topping I changed and used ¾ C butter (to cut down on fat) and  added 1 tsp cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper and easy to make.  Used the remainder of the rhubarb we have for a Blueberry Rhubarb pie and my husband is making Rhubarb sauce.  Yum!! we have things to freeze until the garden is ready!

I made this in an 8x8 baking dish, mostly using the amounts in the original recipe, with the exception that I halved the butter.  It was delicious served with whipped cream.  I will definitely make this again.

Thanks Carolyn great receipt!  Quick and easy and my wife loved it.  I used the left over rhubarb from the pies and doubled the crumble.  Moved to the top rack of the oven to darken the crumble.  This also freezes well.

I halved the recipe and it tasted great over vanilla ice cream.  I did not use all the crumble and ended up wishing I had used even less.  Little too buttery for me, so I will cut back on that next time.  Definitely a keeper but it won't hurt to do some tweaking.

FYI... 1 pound of rhubarb = approximately 3 cups diced. Agreed with others on amount of rhubarb, butter, and sugar.

This was great. I did follow the other suggestion about adding more fruit by adding strawberries as well as rhubarb. I used 1/2 the amount of butter suggested and a dash of mace and allspice in the crumb recipe. This is a keeper recipe and will definitely make it again.

My first time of doing rhubarb, but my husband loves it, so I was looking for recipes and found this one, and read the reviews and thought I would try it, I used 6 cup of rhubarb and 3/4 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of butter and used a baking dish size 8x11 1/2, it turned out delicious, my husband loved it and my sister and husband came by and thought it was wonderful. I will make it again and it makes me want a rhubarb patch.  My favorite thing about it was the crunchy topping.

I had to do a little more than 3 cups and also I had to add a tsp water to the rhubarb mixtures. Other than that it was a great recipe! Brings the family closer together with every bite. However, when it's almost gone it might be torn apart as siblings fight to devour the last piece. :D

I opted to use 6 cups as 3 is way too little.  The amount of topping is very generous so upping the rhubarb was a great tip.  I made this for a BBQ and it was literally gone in 5 minutes! The kids loved it.

Good flavor, but like other reviewers have mentioned there is way too much 'crust' and too little rhubarb.  We did 4 cups of rhubarb, and probably need to do 6 cups.  I will make again with this change.

The flavor balance was excellent, but the juice from my rhubarb soaked up into the "crunch" layer and made it wet. Next time I think I'll bake the crunch alone on a cookie sheet then sprinkle it generously on top of rhubarb cooked on stovetop and served warm.

This is so good.  I loved it and my husband loved it too.  If you like rhubarb try this recipe and serve it warm with a little bit of vanilla ice cream and you won't be disappointed.

I love rhubarb/crunch/crisp dishes, but this turned out WAY too sweet even after I changed the rhubarb amount to 5 cups!  Plus the topping is so much that it seemed to overpower the rhubarb part of the dish.  Not sure I would use this recipe again.  Unless cutting down on the sugar and the topping.

I love rhubarb, and this is a great, easy recipe!  I used 6 cups rhubarb, 1/4 t allspice, just 3/4 c butter.

I made this recipe 'as is' and thought it was great. I like it really crispy and this was, even df was a fan and ate way more than his share! Will make again (soon).

Everyone enjoyed it, but I think it could use more fruit. The topping tasted great,it had a rich buttery flavour. I can't wait to try it again. I think it would be good with peaches or apples too.

Really good recipe, very traditional crisp (they are supposed to be heavy on the topping) my only change was that I used a bar of butter flavoured crisco for the butter and added a dash of nutmeg to the topping. My family gobbled it up in hours.

I made this a few times and each time it was really good.  I use 4 cups rhubarb, only 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup butter.  It  comes out great!  A really big hit!  I love just about anything with rhubarb in it!

Doubled the rhubarb to 6 cups and the sugar to 2 cups but also added around 5 diced fresh cooking apples.  Tasted wonderful - I am sure you can fiddle with the fruit combination quite substantially and still come out with a great-tasting dish.  The entire thing was devoured by 12 people in one sitting, with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream.

Doubled the rhubarb to 6 cups, added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar (I used vanilla sugar - when you use a vanilla bean throw the vanilla pod into a container of sugar and a few weeks later you'll have vanilla sugar, used a 8x8 pan and halved the topping (added a sprinkling of cinnamon to the topping mixture).  Godd warm or cold!

I found it was cooking it was bubbling more than a usual crisp type dish- i think there is too much butter. Also the cooking time was too long, after 35 min it was mushy... thanks anyways.
Overall i would not recommend this dish.

This recipe is wonderful.  I put it in a 9x9 pan and didn't have to change a thing.  There may have been a little too much topping for a 9x9 pan, but using the whole thing was not bad either.  It was just so tasty.  This is a REAL keeper!!

This was so delicious but I couldn't believe the amount of sugar. It was scary, especially because I ate half of the pan in one sitting!. I didn't have any oats so I used a different crumble topping consisting of 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup butter. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was fantastic, and then I ate the other half cold out of the fridge for breakfast. It was good like that too! I think next time I will add an extra cup of rhubarb and bake in a 2 qt casserole dish because there didn't seem to be enough to fill the large pan.

I can't believe how fast and easy this is!  I have my own rhubarb in the garden, this recipe gets it on the table quicker than the notes say!  I love it, and it is low calorie and high nutrition to boot!

Was not pleased with this recipe.  Rhubarb needed to be triple the amount stated;  crumb mixture was much to much and overwhelmed the rhubarb.  Threw most of the topping out!  I think I prefer plain old rhubarb cooked as a sauce, chilled and then topped with a little vanilla pudding or custard!  Lot easier and much tastier!!!

Very good.... I had made a recipe like this except with strawberries and rhubarb and it turned out so good that I wanted to make it again, except I had no more strawberries so I tried this recipe. Really, it was almost as tasty as the one with strawberries. My husband had his doubts since it was rhubarb only, but was pleasantly surprised. My mother-in-law, father-in-law and sister-in-law also seemed very impressed.

Yummy! Very easy and quick. Although I did find that the rhubarb  mixture didn't go very far - I used an 8x8 pan and  there was a lot of topping - didn't use it all. Quite delicious with milk.

This recipe is a keeper. Extremely easy to make and very delicious with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream. Although, it was equally as good without. I put an ample amount of the crumb topping on and still managed to save some for the next batch. Carolyn, this is fantastic. Thanks.

I would definitely use at least 4 cups of rhubarb.
This is very rich and sweet. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it still seemed too sweet. It's great with vanilla ice cream.

The recepie tasted great and was easy to make even with three extra pairs of hands "helping". I found that the portions were not enough to fill a large pan and so I used a 9" pie pan instead and that worked wonderfully.

Hubby and I both enjoyed it very much, despite the fact that he does not enjoy rhubarb very much!

I used frozen rhubarb & it was fabulous. I also used more rhubarb than the recipe called for. Very easy to make so your left over rhubarb will not go to waste.

I prefer to add some cinnamon...
But, Charky mom might not like cinnamon on it.

I used 8 cups rhubarb instead of the 3 as the recipe calls for, and I will use more next time I make it.  3 cups would barely cover the bottom of the pan if it would at all.
