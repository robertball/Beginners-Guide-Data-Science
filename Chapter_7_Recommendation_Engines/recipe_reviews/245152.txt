This was awesome. Very tasty and so simple. I made a few changes. I cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp, chopped up and added about a quarter cup of golden raisins, and substituted Splenda for the sweetener.  I did not use lemon or cilantro because I liked the flavor without it. Iâ€™ll bet leftovers will taste even better. Next time I might cut the black pepper in half. Planning on having this with Thanksgiving as I think it would taste excellent with turkey. I may chop up a butternut squash or sweet potato to make it go further.

I found it tasted a bit too spicy.  I ended up adding sweet chili sauce and a few choice herbs and it was delicious. Will be trying this recipe again, with the agave next time!
