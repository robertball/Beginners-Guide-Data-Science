followed the recipe as written and it was a hit.  I will make this again and the next time will use less salt for our taste and also cut the recipe in half  or use two frying pans, as the one I nave may not be large enough.  I found it very difficult to get the top cooked without searing the bottom.  Loved it!

I used about 1/2 pound savory vegetables total (including 1/3 mushrooms, 1/2 spinach, remainder green onions.  Saut√©ed that on low til tender.  Brought to med, added remaining butter, and egg mixture: 6 duck eggs 7 tbsp milk and cheese mix (2/3 grated Romano and 1/3 Gouda), dill, parsley, salt, pepper.  At 14 min was too runny in center,  so covered and let sit on hot burner.  Delicious!

The recipe as written needs some changes with regards to cooking times/temperature. Mine came out over cooked on the bottom but the eggs were not cooked in the middle. The taste was good however, so will experiment again changing the cooking style/time/temperature.
