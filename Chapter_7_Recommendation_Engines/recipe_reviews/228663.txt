I had a bunch of "leftover" cilantro and wondered what to do with all of it. This recipe came to the rescue. I am out of fish sauce, so I used lite soy sauce in lieu of that. I completely forgot to add the sugar! The peanut butter I used is this great product made by Earth Balance called coconut & peanut spread. It's creamy and requires no stirring. The hint of coconut was wonderful in this recipe. I immediately spread the mixture on a baguette and had a tasty lunch. It would be great on warm noodles too. This one is a keeper: simple and tasty. Next time I'll try with the suger, but it doesn't seem necessary.

I personally would give this 4 stars, but EVERYBODY else that ate it loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was good, but needed a little bit of brightness to it.  SO I added a bit of lime juice, lemon grass and a bit of lime ponzu (it was within reaching distance) and it lightened it up to my liking.  I love peanut butter, but for some do not like many pesto's that use PB - this is by far the best base recipe for my liking!  ps. - I also used a touch of sambal olek

Yum!  I love Thai food and this did not disappoint.  I cut the cayenne because I have small children, but that is the only alteration I made.  This will be a permanent addition to my kitchen!

Made the recipe exactly as written, and we were pleased with the sharp, sweet and spicy flavors.  I added part of the pesto to spaghetti noodles with shredded carrot and green onion - tasty, but dry (added some sesame oil at the table).  The other portion of pesto I brushed on thin chicken breast cutlets and grilled - amazing!  Pesto had a tendency to burn at the end (and get bitter), so possibly bake instead of grill.

We loved this.   I was worried that the cilantro would be overwhelming, but not so.  There was no fish sauce at our local grocery store, so used soy sauce. I also added a little lemon juice. My partner raved about it.  He ate 3 bowls.  :)

This is great! 

I made a few small changes: 2 tbsp olive oil + 1 tbsp sesame oil, added 1 lime's worth of juice, and a little srirracha sauce to pump up the spice. We didn't have any fish oil on hand, but soy sauce worked as a good replacement. 

This is so great I'm making it for the second time in 2 weeks!

I thought this was good. Didn't have fish sauce so I used soy sauce instead. Only put half the cayenne but would put the full amount next time or maybe a Thai red chili or two. Hubby wants too keen on it but he's not the most adventurous when it comes to food anyway. Will make this again.

I've been using recipes from this site for years and have never reviewed any of them until now.  This is amazing stuff!  I read the other reviews and followed some of the suggestions, just because I knew I'd like the additions. I added the zest and juice of a small lime, a little sesame oil and a healthy squirt of srirracha.  I didn't have fish sauce, so I substituted soy sauce.  Since I didn't have fresh ginger, I used the ginger that comes in a tube that you can find in the refrigerated section in the produce department.  If you're debating on making this recipe, stop reading now and go make it!!

This was excellent!!! I did make a few alterations. I doubled the batch and used most of it on 1 box of whole grain spaghetti. I also added the zest and juice of 1 lime. Omitted the fish sauce. Used a T of seasame oil. A few dashes of sea salt. And a T of tubed lemongrass because I couldn't find any fresh. And I served it with ribbons of carrot and crushed cashews. Let me tell ya, this was deeeelish! It is a bit garlicky so next time I might cut that down a little. Will def make again! Thanks for such an awesome meal :)

This is the Thai taste I've been looking for! Ever since I visited Thailand in 2000, I've searched for that "secret something" that made some of the dishes there my favorite. This is as close as it gets.

I have made this several times and we like it quite a lot. My reason for giving four stars rather than five is that 3 cloves of raw garlic is quite overpowering (and I love garlic!). One clove is sufficient.

I agree with the other reviewer who said this needed to be brightened up, but it was really good. I added a big handful of fresh basil leaves, & felt like it really benefitted from a splash of lime juice. I served this on angel hair with chicken and green peas which was really good. Next time I will also add julienned carrots & sprinkle it with crushed peanuts & fresh jalapeno slices.

Wow, this is a FANTASTIC sauce! I used a gourmet habanero peanut butter so it was extra spicy. I also added maybe 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil because I really like the flavor of it. Was hesitant to splurge on the bottle of fish sauce, but I'm glad I did because I will be making this sauce often.

I substituted almond butter for peanut, and coconut sugar for cane.  Ridiculously easy and delicious.  I tossed it with spaghetti squash, sautéed veggies, and chicken.  This will be a regular at my house!

Though a non-cilantro lover, I loved this!  Doubled the peanut butter for more protein. Also added 1 1/2 t. of sesame oil, 1 lime's juice, extra ginger, much less sugar, no cayenne.  Cucumber and red bell pepper shreds helped lighten up the pasta part. Yum!

This was awesome after adding salt and lime juice
