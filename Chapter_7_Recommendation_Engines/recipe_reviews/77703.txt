Amazing!  I had a sushi party and I decided to print out some sushi recipes for my guests to try. This one was an absolute HIT.  I wasn't sure how the combination of pesto and egg would taste, but it is a delicious combination in sushi, adding an Italian twist!  I also added avocado slivers. I will certainly make this in the future! Outstanding!

This is the best "homemade" sushi recipe I've ever made.  I was slightly leery at first (Eggs + Basil Pesto = Sushi?!), but wow-- excellent choice of flavors!  And extremely cheap to make, which is always a plus!
