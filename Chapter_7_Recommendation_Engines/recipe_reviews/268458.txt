I love this gravy. So easy to make and so tasty. Mine seemed a little too thick, but hey you also can thin it out. Very good. The perfect gravy for lots of things.

Wow! This was a wonderful surprise. Itâ€™s flavorful, thick and creamy as well as super easy. I used it with some tvp meatballs. This would even be good on biscuits. Thank you for the recipe.
