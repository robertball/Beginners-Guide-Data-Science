I gave this 5 stars but did not make it exactly as published.  I cut the recipe in half an made it on the stove at very low heat.  It still took 5 hours.  It did not thicken up as much as I thought it would but I added a little more tapioca.  My tapioca may be a little stale.  I did add the raisins in in the last hour.  Thanks for  the recipe, I will make again

I gave it a 4 because the flavor was really good, but like the other reviewer, my pudding was more like apple soup in consistency.  It could have been my crock pot: I used the kind that doesn't have a heat setting, so maybe I didn't cook it long enough.  I wonder if using large pearl tapioca would make this even more interesting?

This is a simple and delicious recipe; I was looking for an apple dessert that wasn't too full of calories.  However, I always put my tapioca pearls in my blender first and pulverize them so they don't take so long to cook.  Instead of using boiling water I let the tapioca soften in cold water, add all the remaining ingredients and then bring to a boil.  I also cook these on the stove top simply because I don't plan ahead far enough to use the slow cooker.  If I did, I think cooking time would be far less if you broke up the tapioca pearls.  Mine thickened up easily.

I love a good pudding, and for me its largely about the texture. The thicker and creamier the better. This, although to be fair tasted good, ended up as apple flavored soup. Followed recipe to the letter. Sorry to speak ill of a recipe that people mostly seem to like but the texture, or lack thereof, ruined it for me.
