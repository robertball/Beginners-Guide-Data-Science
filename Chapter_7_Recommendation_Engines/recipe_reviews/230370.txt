Oh so good! I melted the almond bark in a double boiler and did not add the shortening and it turned out great.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My kids loved this stuff.  I felt it was too sweet. Will not make again. Like Puppy chow better.

I'm a big fan of the old school Puppy Chow so I thought I'd try the "birthday cake" version for my nieces and nephew. The cake mix and addt'l sprinkles added cost and you can't see any of the sprinkles in the final product. Then the processed flavor just made this a no-go.

Mine turned out great. It is sweet but if it’s too sweet just leave off the powdered sugar. I used mine with nuts, pretzels and red and green M&M’s for Christmas. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I love it

It is very sweet and I thought the cake mix gave it a weird taste. Thanks, but i'll stick with the original puppy chow.

I made this for a girls weekend- it's VERY sweet but delicious and addicting! Everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it! I used vanilla Chex, but didn't realize they are sweetened, so next time I'll use regular. Also- I used white vanilla Wiltons baking melts instead of the white chocolate and shortening, since it has the same texture and sets at room temperature, you just have to be sure to mix it quickly.  I plan to make this again at Christmas with red and green funfetti mix/sprinkles!
