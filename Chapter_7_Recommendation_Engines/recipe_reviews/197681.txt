Sorry, but this one didn't do it for us.  I made it as written and there was just way, way too much garlic powder in it.  In trying to salvage it, I added another T. of mayonnaise and 1 1/2 t. more hot pepper sauce.  That helped.  We used it on burgers, but neither Hubs nor I liked it very much.  If you're going to make this, I suggest adding the garlic powder and the hot pepper sauce to taste.

I have made this sauce countless times. I use chipotle peppers for this and it make a dynamite sauce for grilled fish taco's. Sometimes I add a little sugar. The Best!!  Thank You Spin Disc!

Really simple way to spice up a sandwich. As per another reviewer, I only added half the garlic, and it was enough for me. I used it on a panini with whole wheat bread, sliced turkey, avocado, red onion, mozzarella cheese and tomato and it was delicious!

I thought this was a great change of pace.  I made it exactly as written, but I used it on chicken sandwich with the works.  Loved it.  I have since used it on hamburgers with the works and it is delightful.  Thanks

Great sauce that was enough for 3 large paninis.  It was a nice change from plain mayonnaise and simple enough to make your own alterations to easily.

So good!  I mixed in some sauce from a can of chipotle peppers like the other reviewer.  It gave it the perfect sweetness and heat.  Highly recommend this recipe!

This is a terrific sauce, just make a quantity for "6" and us fit for "3" and used fresh crushed garlic, chill overnight.  Sublime!

I make a very similar sauce that I use in sandwiches and dipping sauce for wings, nuggets and corn fritters. 2 parts mayo and one part ketchup,and as much hot sauce as you want. do not add garlic, but any dry herb or fresh is a good addition (dill, chives, thyme or cilantro)

I combined this with another recipe for making a panini at home and this sauce added a real kick! I've gotta say my panini probably would have come out lame without having this sauce in it! This makes me want to make more paninis and, consequentially, more of this sauce (which is the only downside I think but it is worth it). I think I'll even make paninis for my family! What joy!

I added hot sauce and garlic powder to taste like some suggested and it was perfect on our turkey, cheese and spinach paninis.
