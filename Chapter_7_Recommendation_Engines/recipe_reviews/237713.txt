First time grilling cauliflower since it was too hot to fire up the oven.  It won't be the last.

Thunder storm rolled in just as I was about to grill.  I made this on the stove and it was great!!  My hubby said I can make it instead of mashed potatoes any time!

Tastes almost like candy!  Keep florets on the large side for easier grilling and less time spent turning them. Put smaller pieces in a mesh grill basket but they will take a little longer to char and cook. Delicious!!
