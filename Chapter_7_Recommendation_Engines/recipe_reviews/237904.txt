Very nice! As the submitter suggests, adjust the lemon and sugar to taste. Because I like to eat my sugar rather than drink it, lol, I used equal sweetner in it's place, and that worked out great. It's great to be able to make just one serving...I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is the best homemade lemonade!!!! It's so good!  I did add a little bit more sugar than it said to make it sweeter.  I love this! It's delicious ??

Remember to adjust the lemon juice & sugar to your taste, since we all have different opinions on this.

Super easy and awesome.  I swapped out the sugar for 1 pack of stevia. (T2 Diabetic)  :-)
