Taking some advice from reviewers and working with what I had on hand I added 1/2 c oats (since I only had 2 bananas), reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tbs, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, replaced the applesauce with plain yogurt, and replaced the veg oil with applesauce.  I also made sure to mash the strawberries.  These were SO INCREDIBLY AMAZING.  The texture was perfect, lighter than I expected and they were amazingly moist.  The kept their moisture extremely well and if they hadn't been such a hit with the finace and rommates I'm sure they would've stayed that way regardless of where I kept them for at least a week.  Throwing texture aside the taste of these was enough to make me a fan for life.  (Although for those avoiding sugar I could see reducing the sugar just a tad-they'd still be fantastical) Delicious, filling, healthy, and quick to make!...what more could you ask for?

I use this recipe so often to make banana bread. I omit the strawberries and replace the oil with an additional 1/4 c of applesauce. I also add a tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of salt. I bake each loaf for 50 minutes. 
Even the traditional high fat banana bread lovers in my family say this bread is delicious. My dad told me last night that I make some darn good banana bread.

Wow, how delightfully different and healthy! These make a great breakfast. I used canola oil (healthier fats) and substituted half a cup of the flour with 1/2 cup of wheat germ to up the fiber content. Very moist and full of flavor!

I thought this recipe was fantastic! Thanks Mimi! I usually have a hard time w/making baked goods, but these were easy and they came out great!! The only thing I did different was add blueberries instead of strawberries, and I used 2 large bananas instead of 3. I did read the other reviews, and I dont understand why there was any negative ones--but a tip for future bakers would be to make sure they FOLD the bananas around the dry ingredients. Dont stir the batter, but if you do, definitely dont stir too much--that makes the muffins hard sometimes. Good luck and I hope everyone else enjoyes these muffins as much as I did!!

Fabulous! The best whole grain muffin I've tried. The first time I made them, I used fresh strawberries, but they pretty much disintegrated in the baking process--still tasted great.  The second time, I used blueberries instead of the strawberries and they held up much better and were just as delicious!  They freeze well.  I take one out before bed and it's ready the next morning for breakfast on the go!

I cut the vegetable oil down to 2 tablespoons, and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and large bananas.  My muffins were very moist and delicious, not too sweet.  I also used fresh strawberries, and they worked well.

I was looking for a healthy muffin recipe and ran across this one. I decided to do a little experimenting to make it even healthier by leaving out the sugar, adding another banana, wheat germ and replacing half of the wheat flour with oat flour. I'm happy to say that I was very pleased with the results. I can only imagine how good they would be with the sugar. Thanks Mimi!

These was really good in flavor but sadly i could not give it 5 stars because the frozen strawberries basicly disapeared while cooking :(  I followed everything to the letter and it did not rise at all the parts without berries in it was very dense and was really hopin for a light fluffy muffin. not to mention the holes from where the berries was not happy but will try it again with fresh berries an hope for the best beacause i loved the flavor!!

I had fun making these.  Used mixed berry applesauce, and a little less sugar.  I used frozen whole strawberries, and chopped them in the food processor.  I should have chopped them a little more though, because some of the pieces were too big and were mushy and gooey in the muffins.  Pretty good muffins, but not ones I'll be rushing to make again.

Loved this recipe. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and also made regular size muffins. They were fabulous and the kiddos loved them. Next time I think I will use fresh strawberries though, because the frozen were very tart. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my first review!  And its because this is the first recipe from this site that I have made numerous times, numerous ways and they ALWAYS come out good.  Below Ive outlined my most recent attempt which was the best batch ive ever made.  

Keep in mind, i eat these for breakfast and do not like them overly sweet, so the bananas plus strawberries in the batter provide enough sugar for my taste.  Also, without any oil these are certainly not as moist as regular muffins.  But if you have any familiarity with no-fat baking, you may be amazed at how nice the textures is.

MY CHANGES - 1 egg/1 egg white, all applesauce instead of oil, omitted sugar entirely, 1 cup white whole wheat flour/1 cup oat flour, loads of spices including cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger (1 T each), and 1.5 cups fresh strawberries. 

The result was a perfectly sweet, light, super hearty muffin!  I had 2 for breakfast this morning and they were even better after resting overnight.

One sortof "duh" suggestion:  dont pour this batter into cupcake liners!  Or, should i say, dont do it if you omit fat entirely because they will stick and you will lose half the muffin every time you unwrap one!

Did not like these at all.  I thought the cinnamon overpowered the flavor of the strawberries.  If your are going to make them I'd cut the cinnamon in half.

These were very good and moist.  I looked at some of the suggestions and wanted to keep it low calorie so I replaced the applesauce with yogurt, replace the vegetable oil with applesauce, used two bananas, mashed frozen strawberries and drained excess liquid, and used only 1 teaspoon cinnamon and added 1/4 teaspoon nutmug.  Turned out great.

These are delicious! Perfect for breakfast. To cut the fat even further, I replaced all of the oil with applesauce.

As wholesome as you can get with a muffin. Delicious and nutritious! I double my batch and used blueberries instead of strawberries, they turned out so well! These are a great snack for youngsters.

Other than the slightly-soggy consistency the strawberries leave, I enjoyed the final product.  I used this as a way to have people sample "whole wheat" items and the group seemed to really enjoy them.

i wanted to only give these 3 stars because i really didn't enjoy the 'spice' taste of them but realized that was kind of silly as i knew the ingredients going in; i'm more of a sweet flavor lover. anyway, my neighbor thought they were great and that you could taste the strawberries and bananas (i didn't think so). but they were moist, the 2 cups of fresh diced strawberries held up, the muffins rose nicely and they were filling. i think i enjoyed them more warm out of the oven. only used 2 bananas, added the 1/2 cup of oats and only used on tsp of cinnamon as others suggested. used a 6 oz. cup of lite vanilla flavored yogurt instead of oil since i'd never tried that before. overall, a success. a piece of advice: if you accidentally break your eggs in the bowl before mashing the bananas, don't think you can just mash them in the egg. doesn't work that well...

Very delicious and easy to make.  Subbed 1/2 c. low-fat sour cream for the applesauce and 1/4 c. applesauce for the oil, used two bananas and increased the strawberries to 2 cups, diced, reduced the cinnamon to a 1/2 T and added the 1/4 t. nutmeg as per other reviews.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you!

I loved these muffins! Everyone in the house enjoyed them. They are a great alternative to processed sugar treats. Plus, I am always looking for a way to use overly ripe bananas in the kitchen. Oh, I did use fresh strawberries instead of frozen, still great!

I have made these several times, and we love them with one exception--the chunks of frozen strawberry just turn into big soggy messes.  So I made them again using fresh strawberries diced into fairly small pieces.  This was better.  They were still a bit soggy around the strawberries, but because the chunks were smaller, it wasn't as noticeable and the muffins held together better.  I will still make these again, but next time I might omit the strawberries altogether.

Moist and flavorful - fantastic!  Like everyone else, I made substitutions based on what I had on hand, and found that the recipe adapted easily.  I had cinnamon applesauce, so I omitted the cinnamon.  I only had one banana, so I added 1/2 cup minute oats and an extra 1/2 cup applesauce.  Based on another reviewer's suggestions, I mashed the thawed, frozen strawberries (I don't like gooey fruit in my muffins).  Last, I don't have a muffin tin, so I put heaping spoonfuls of the batter on a cookie tin, and topped them with oats and cinnamon-sugar.  Baked for 17 minutes.  Really wonderful!

I've made these twice now.  The first time, I followed the recipie, and they were good.  This time, I changed it up, and they are SOOOO yummy!!  I used 1 cup whole wheat flower, 1/2 cup white flour, and 1/2 cup oatmeal.  I also used 1 cup of blueberries, in place of the strawberries.  I chopped the blueberries up in the processor, which seemed to work out really well.  (My kids do not like biting into big pieces of blueberries in muffins, so I've learned to chop them up).

Very good.  For the true giant muffins I needed more time in the oven, possibly needs a touch more flour.  But taste was very good.  Just threw a handfull of freeze dried strawberries in.  Next time will chop the strawberries finer instead of slices.

8/11-  Added 1/2 c. ground flax,1 t. cinnamon,  slightly less sugar, chopped the strawberries and added to flour mix.  Made 20 muffins.  Baked 17 min dark, 20 min regular. They stuck to liners a bit, so next time I'll spray.  Delicious, healthy muffins. : )

Not as good as I had hoped it would be. I love strawberry and banana combos but I didn't enjoy these. The strawberries were mushy,maybe because they were partially thawed.I'll probably use a homemade strawberry syrup next time and leave out the sugar.

Definitely taste best with adding an extra cup of strawberries and mashing them with the bananas.  Also add a cup of oatmeal.  Yum.

Thanks for a great healthy recipe! Seriously they smell as good as they taste. I didn't have strawberries so I used the black berries and raspberries that I had on hand and needed to use up. I also made a crumble topping with an instant low sodium reduced fat brown sugar oatmeal packet and a little butter, I just mashed it together with a fork and put it on the tops of the muffins while baking. The whole house smelled amazing and they really turned out light fluffy moist and fantastic! The kids literally were crowding around the oven waiting for a muffin! What a great breakfast or snack. The second time I tried blueberries that also went over very well, and I used the same method for topping with whole grain oats and butter crumble.

I made these as a sugar free recipe substituting about one-half cup agave for the brown sugar.  Turned out great - not too sweet but sweet enough.  I will be making them often.  Lovely texture.

I wanted a banana bread recipe low in fat and made with whole wheat flour and found this one. Of course, I tweaked on it a bit. I omitted the oil, strawberries and applesauce, put in 1-1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1 Tbsp., then I added 3/4 C. of vanilla yogurt. I baked in a bread pan at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. My family really loved this. Very moist!

Nutritious, moist and tasty!   I used only 2 bananas and added 1/2 Cup oats. Cut back on cinnamon to 1/2 Tablespoon, added 1/4 nutmeg as others had suggested.  I mashed the strawberries as some reviewers complained about sliced strawberries' sogginess.  My applesauce was strawberry flavored. Added streusel topping from "Strawberry Streusel Muffins" recipe on this site. Nice moist muffins, the husband and toddler ate them up!  Good with butter but doesn't really need it (unless you're a butter fiend like myself ;)

These muffins were really moist (although the batter seemed overly dry before the strawberries were added).  I thought there was too much Cinnamon and I like Cinnamon.  Will probably make these again using less.

Yum, these are tasty! To make them more figure friendly & heart healthy I substituted in eggs beaters, canola oil, used only a half cup of agave instead of sugar, had fresh strawberries and blueberries in the frig so added a cup of each. As another review suggested, I added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg as well. LOVE these muffins. Hubs had three for breakfast!

Tried this recipe in an effort to eat healthier. I substituted the brown sugar with agave nectar and used fresh strawberries instead. It was delicious! One thing, the strawberries made the muffin a little too soggy so will try dried fruit next time instead. Overall, very good!

I love strawberries and so does my husband, so I made them especially for him.  They were terrific - he actually ate them all in no time flat.  Very flavorful, moist, great mix of strawberry banana flavor. These were a hit!

Tasted ok the first day. They definitely tasted 'healthy' and the strawberry flavor was not at all detectable.  But on the second day, they were dry and hard to eat.  I stored them airtight too.  Ended up being a disappointment.

I made this as written, with two exceptions.  I cut the cinnamon in half and used regular size muffin pans.  Even with halving the cinnamon, it still overpowered both the banana and strawberry flavors, IMO.  Also, I think the submitter means to use standard size muffins cups, rather than minis.  I assumed “large” meant the jumbo cups.  Using a standard muffin pan this produced 12 nice size muffins.  They did rise and dome beautifully.  If I were to make these again, I would cut the cinnamon back even further.

I like the recipe, but I am still looking for the perfect one. They have a mild strawberry banana taste, slightly sweet, moist...but they didn't have the crisp outside I like in a muffin and I think maybe needed a pinch of salt and less cinnamon. The fruit flavor would probably be stronger without the whole wheat but I like it because of the whole wheat. The strawberries do leave holes, but I diced them instead of slicing for smaller pieces. I wonder if this would work better as an apple muffin:keep the cinnamon and add diced apple, which holds together better. And maybe just a smidgen of white sugar for a little crispness on the outside...and a pinch of salt in the batter. Also, I did not have giant muffin cups and was surprised to see this filled my 12 regular muffin cups exactly ??? They baked up without spilling over. It took 15 minutes in my oven.

Very good! I used this as a base - changed the flour to 1/2 whole spelt and 1/2 white (wheat) and used diced and spiced apples (homemade frozen apple pie filling actually) instead of the strawberries. Fantastic! Much better than I thought it would be.

These were very flavourful and moist! My only disappointment was the appearance, the tops flattened and sunk as they cooled. My only substitution was that I used pureed fresh strawberries in lieu of the frozen ones. Next time I will try slicing them instead of pureeing. I also reduced the amount of cinnamon just based on the reviews I read.

Instead of using strawberries all I had were blueberries. Turned out great! And I will try adding oats next time, sounds good. The batter was delicious! Great alternative for white flour.

Following other people's suggestions, I used 2 bananas + 1/2 cup oats, and yogurt and applesauce. I reduced the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. I partially mashed really really cold strawberries (they did not have time to freeze).

Very tasty! I made a couple of changes to make them even more healthy... Instead of just regular canola oil I used coconut oil (much more healthy for you ) and I decreased the sugar to 1/2 a cup. Turned out great! My kids love them!

GREAT! THANK YOU! These are moist and more delicious than any bread. I only made a few minor changes.  I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (1 T would be way too much for our taste), fresh strawberries mashed with a potato masher, and used about 1 cup of my homemade/healthy flour(blended oatmeal and flax seed).  Also due to elevation I remove 3 T sugar and add 3 extra T flour.  It's easy to stir/fold gently by hand in one bowl and makes a huge batch.  I made 16 regular sized muffins + 24 mini muffins.  The kids loved gobbling the minis fresh from the oven.  Make these often and enjoy!!

I used 1/2 c strawberries and 1/2 c blueberries, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It made 10 giant muffins in my pans. Delicious!

I cut the strawberries into chunks.  I sprayed the pans, but I had a problem with the strawberries sticking to sides of the muffin tins.  I guess paper would have worked a little better.  

It went over well at the parents' group I took it too.  Everyone liked the alternative to cookies.

These muffins really are big. Usually, when I bake a recipe for 12 muffins, I use only 9 or 10 tins to have larger-size muffins. I didn't have to do that with this recipe.

To make this healthier and diabetic-friendly, I made some changes: I used 3.5 bananas, fresh strawberries, homemade unsweetened applesauce, Splenda brown sugar (and only 2/3 the amount required), and only a dash of cinnamon.

I was very excited to make this recipe because I had eaten some delicious strawberry banana muffins at a restaurant, but this recipe came up short.

The only substitution I made with mine was to use all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat flour, since I already had plenty at home.

My main complaint with the muffins was that they were too moist and bordering on gooey.  The consistency reminded me more of a banana bread than a muffin.  I was especially disapointed because my tops never came out slightly crust-like the way muffin tops normally do.

I also found them to be rather bland.  They don't have quite the strong flavors that say a blueberry muffin does.

Overall, not a bad recipe but it needs some tweaks.  I might make it again just to experiment and see if I can make it more flavorful and less moist.

Mimi,
Love this recipe - no refined white four and sugar: sweetened only with brown sugar and fruit.

1/4 cup of oil instead of butter or margarine, very healthy!!! this makes a delicious breakfasr on the go, or mid-afternoon snack. 

Keep up the heart healthy eating!!

Very good and moist.  I took other suggestions and used 1/2 cup of Kefir for the applesauce and 1/4 cup of applesauce for the oil.  I also used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar splenda blend.  For the 2 cups of flour I used 1.5 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of wheat germ/oats.  I did not have strawberries so I did 1 batch with fresh raspberries and 1 batch with fresh peaches.    They do stick to the paper liners a bit even with some cooking spray.  They may do better just being made in greased muffin tin without liners.

Delicious!  I made a double batch and made a few changes:  1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour (so they wouldn't be too dense); I substituted flax seed for half of the oil and used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and chopped the frozen strawberries in my food processor first.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

These are INCREDIBLE! Came across this recipe as I was looking for a banana bread/muffin recipe that also used only whole wheat flour. The only thing I may have changed was that I maybe added an extra 1/2 cup of strawberries inadvertently in order to use the entire container I had purchased :) Warm, these muffins taste like a slightly sweeter, fruiter version of a bran muffin (no problem I my book!) But I went to have 2 for a quick breakfast on a busy morning, and WOW! Tastes light healthy banana bread with a strawberry kick- SO yummy! My boyfriend adores them as well, so I have a feeling that I'll def make these again!! I may try and experiment with adding some sort of whey powder or other protein source to these in the future (I'm training & like to keep a strong protein intake), but this recipe is perfect as is! Highly recommend!!!!

For whole wheat, they were pretty good. Obviously not as light as regular muffins; my family said they were good, but wanted my 'other ones' next time. Great if you're on a diet though.

This is a simple and delicious recipe just begging to be elaborated upon. I skipped the third banana in favor of about 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt, minced fresh strawberries (instead of the frozen sliced), and added a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed for increased fiber, protein, and Omega-3s. I think next time I will reduce the sugar by just a bit, because they were definitely sweet enough and that is the only health improvement I can see to make on the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor of the muffin was ok but the sliced strawberries shrunk in the baking process and left my muffins with huge cavities.

Another great healthy muffin! Ran out of coconut oil & I had no applesauce on hand - so based on other reviews I substituted canola oil for the vegetable (read up on good & bad fats - canola oil beats veg oil), and substituted yogurt for applesauce. Used around 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of the 2 cups. Then I used about 1/4 cup wheat germ and approx 1/3 cup oats (I added extra banana & strawberry so my measurements were not exact bc I added more flour/oats/wheat germ as I saw fit to thicken). I also pureed my bananas and frozen strawberries, reduced cinnamon to 1/2 tbs and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Next time will try with 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and maybe blueberries. Used my trusty crushed almond/flour/salt/brown sugar topping. Moist and good flavor. Really loving the strawberry-banana-yogurt combo. Not sure I'll even bother trying it with applesauce. Thank you for the recipe!

My kids love these muffins.  I do not make them giant - I get 2  dozen regular sized muffins.  Put them in an ziplock and into the freezer.  I also subbed yogurt for applesauce and added an extra pinch of baking soda. Regarding not being moist-try adding a little extra fruit.   Thanks for a great healthy recipe.

These were deliciously moist and dense, makes for a great get-up-and-go breakfast. My husband and father-in-law enjoyed them too. I think I'll take note of what another said and make a banana bread loaf like this! Thanks for sharing this.

Great healthy recipe!  Made these for my hubby who never has time for breakfast in the morning...  I omitted the strawberries (only because I did not have them on hand), and another reviewer had mentioned, substituting yogurt for the applesauce - I substituted the applesauce with kefir, and kept everything else the same.  Turned out wonderful.  Next time I will add strawberries and reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.  Delicious and healthy.  Thank you for the recipe!

I did not find these moist.  I like the fact that they are relatively healthy with little oil and whole wheat flour but did not find the flavor inviting.  Disappointed after the other reviews were so grand.

Great muffin.  I used a cup of fresh strawberries chopped into pieces instead of the frozen sliced.  I also added in a handful of wheat germ and 1/4 cup of light sour cream.  My kids loved them and they are healthy...what more could you ask for?

Surprisingly moist for a whole-wheat muffin. Not too sweet, so it's perfect for a breakfast muffin. I reduced the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and I thought that was enough cinnamon flavor.

These were really good. I liked the flavor combination.  I used fresh strawberries and they got a bit mushy after sitting, but they still tasted great.

These were really wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh strawberries, as I was overrun with them. Kids loved them and I loved that I was using up ingredients that were ready to spoil and making a relatively healthy snack for the kids, too! I'll make this one again and again!

I was happy, both my kids gobbled these up. (anything that both of them eat without trouble gets five stars in my book!!) I thawed and sliced my frozen strawberries. Will make again for sure!

These are pretty good. I made them a little extra healthy by using agave & molasses in place of brown sugar and topped them with sliced almonds. They are tasty but probably not as sweet as the original recipe.

These were pretty good.  I made them as written except I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of applesauce because that is what I had on hand and I added 1/4 tsp of salt.  They were very moist.  They could use a little more flavor.  I also had some issues with the strawberries making them soggy in places.  I think I will try leaving out the strawberries and adding another banana and maybe some nutmeg or allspice and walnuts.

My girls made these after school today and really enjoy them.  They followed the recipe exactly.  I did do the slicing of the frozen strawberries though. Smelled so good while baking and very moist when done. My kids loved them and I really liked the fact that they are healthier then most muffins, whole wheat flour,  applesauce, a small amount of oil and the fruits. Great muffins!

The only changes I made was to use a standard size muffin tin (the recipe yielded 16 muffins and they were done in 20 minutes- I used a dark nonstick pan at 350 degrees), halve the amount of cinnamon, and use fresh chopped strawberries instead of frozen.  I thought the muffins turned out great!  Very moist, not too sweet, and a healthy alternative to cookies for my youngest to share in the church nursery tomorrow.

I loved the base recipe but I made a FEW modifications and they were fabulous! I only used 1 very ripe banana, 2 tsp baking powder instead of soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup whole milk. They were moist, tasty and plenty sweet! I also used fresh, diced strawberries....YUMMY!

Superb! I included 1/2cup oat as well. Mistakenly measured oil for 1/2cup, didn't use apple sauce at all, but used 1/4cup sour cream instead. Lightly mashed strawberries, and only used 1/2cup brown sugar. The result is DELIGHTFUL! 
Also picked up the best tip given by one of the reviewers: to only fold, not 'vigourously' stir. Thank you!

Just made this recipe! Delish! I halved the cinnamon as recommended by other reviewers and I used fresh strawberries, since they are in season! I’d recommend making this recipe and subbing peaches and raspberries for the strawberries.

This recipe is extremely versatile.  I used fresh blueberries instead of strawberries and used a flour combo (Spelt, whole wheat, soy, brown rice & flax meal).  So delicious!  My kids love them!  Could they be any healthier??

WONDERFUL muffin recipe!!  This is a keeper!  I used frozen strawberries and mashed them up and drained off most of the liquid.  I was a little scared to use frozen mashed strawberries in case the muffins came out too soggy but they were perfect!  I also found Whole Grain flour in my supermarket and this made the muffins very healthy!  This recipe is a keeper!

Just finished making these delicious muffins! I love the combination of the banana and strawberry together. The strawberries give a nice taste to them. Next time I would probably add a little more spice to them to give them even more flavor. Overall, great recipe and they fill the house with a wonderful smell!

These are really good! I replaced the oil with more apple sauce and put about a tablespoon of oil in the batter just to make them even more guilt free! The strawberries I had were not frozen, but they turned out just fine, I think I could have even added a little more flour because of the extra moisture from them. Excellente!

I made these a long time ago and just realized I never reviewed them. Here I am making them again, because they are so good. I follow the recipe, only using fresh strawberries rather than frozen. These turn out beautifully and taste great. I love the combination of banana and strawberry and I think this recipe would work well with almost any other fruit as well. Great flavor, and moist without being 'pasty'.

These are tasty.  I used cinnamon applesauce, so I cut back a bit on the cinnamon.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt, as I feel salt brings out flavor in recipes.  I had a little topping left from making "Whole Wheat Sweet Potato Muffins" (also from this site), so I used that up on these, and it went well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good! The only two things that I altered from the recipe: substituted Canola oil for the Vegetable oil and used fresh instead of frozen strawberries. I also use Canola oil to "grease" the muffin tins. As has been stated already, these muffins freeze well. They are also moist and flavorful. I have had two other taste testers, and both of them give a hearty thumbs up!

I usually love muffins like this, but these were really not good at all. They looked and smelled wonderful, but they were pretty dense and tasted like straight wheat flour. I was quite disappointed.

One of the best whole wheat muffins I have made. I used fresh strawberries, diced. Instead of applesauce, I used apple butter and left out additional spices. My son loved them too!

These are great as is & even better when I made them fat-free. I used all applesauce & no oil. I used Splenda brown sugar blend & added a cup of blueberries.

Excellent! I took the advice of another user and added wheat germ in place of some of the flour and it was good! I also threw in a few extra strawberries. I might add a little more spice next time, but overall, very delicious!

Yum Yum! Substituted 1 c. of nuts for the strawberries and had to cook them for about 5 minutes more.  My husband didn't even notice they were "healthy"! My two young sons love them too.

These were just ok.  They were moist, but almost too dense for my liking.  Next time I think I would try 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour.

These were great!  Finally a healthy snack I can send with my kindergartener to school that she loves.  I added 1/3 c flax seed and used all applesauce and no oil.  Am about to make my second batch right now!

I made these muffins expecting them to be really good but was dissapointed but my hubby really enjoyed them. I would recommend cutting the strawberry pieces in very small pieces to avoid having mushy chunks of fruit in the muffins. I don't think I'll make these again unless my hubby specifically requests them.

Oh my, wow! The ONLY thing I changed was that I used splenda's brown sugar blend for the brown sugar and reduced the cinnamon, this things are amazing. They are supposed to be breakfast for 2 people for the work week, but I'm not sure they will last until friday.

Tasty recipe! My muffins came out a little soggy on the bottom, could be from the fruit or maybe because I used a silicone muffin pan? Still a very good muffin and healthy too!

Another recipe used out of desperation. I had both bananas and homemade applesauce I wanted to use. Following with some of the other reviewers, I only used two large mashed bananas and cut back on the cinnamon. One tablespoon seemed like an excessive amount, plus there was already spice in my homemade applesauce. I didn't have a large muffin pan, so this made 16 regular sized muffins. They're good, but missing something. They have plenty of moistness, but they are a little bland. I'll be sure to make this again, as there's almost always bananas and applesauce in the house, but I think I'll do half white flour and half whole wheat next time and sprinkle granola on top. I want to change up the berries, too.

Followed the directions to the letter and these turned out great! I was worried that they'ed be dry because of the whole wheat (normally I use half wheat half white flour) but these were just perfect. Moist and flavorful--I just can't say enough good things about this recipe.

These were delicious and easy to make.  I made them for Valentine's day for my husband, and he loved them.  It was nice to find a whole-wheat muffin recipe that wasn't bland.  This was full of flavor and very moist.  Great!  I will make these over and over again.

These were very good.  Moist, and flavorful.  I liked the 'bite' the strawberries give it.  I confess, I am just getting used to the taste of all whole wheat...I am sure my taste buds will adjust.  Thnak you for a recipe I will try again.

These were delicious, great flavour with a nice moist texture, the only change I made was to use Canola oil instead of Vegetable oil so it was a little more healthier. As another reviewer mentioned the key is not to over stir when making muffins just fold in the dry ingredients a few times don't worry about lumps!

This is a great recipe overall.  The muffins came out moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  I used blueberries instead of strawberries.  The only thing I thought it lacked was the salt.  With a little bit of salt added to this recipe, it will probably have a fuller taste, rather than a bit mild sweet flavor.

I used fresh strawberries and no cinnamon (I was out). Very tasty, but it needed the cinnamon. The shelf life of these muffins is very short...the bananas will make the muffins slimy after a day or so. I made them in batches...mini muffins.

These muffins are very moist and tasty. I halved the recipe and it made 7 large muffins. Next time I will try even less oil, since they were so moist. I will definitely keep this as a good muffin base recipe and try it with different fruits.

yummy! The only thing I did different was to use whole wheat PASTRY flour,splenda brown sugar instead of regular, and a little bit of raspberry syrup added to frozen strawberries I processed to a liquid consistency added to the banana portion.

Very good and seemingly healthy.  I think next time I will use 1/4 cup of margarine instead of oil to give a more creamy taste.  Otherwise fabulous --would be great to make for guests or a office breakfast.

Really good! I made mini-muffins, and used fresh strawberries(chopped). Kids and husband loved them.  Make a bunch a head of time for those mornings with no time to eat a good breakfast.

After reading the reviews I figured I would try the recipe as is and make adjustments... next time. I though this was a really good recipe using 100% whole wheat flour. I did use a 4th banana sliced and folded it in at the same time as the strawberries. I thought the recipe was moist and delicious... would definitely make it again.

Oh wow - amazing!  I took the advice of others and used plain greek yogurt for the applesauce and applesauce for the oil.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, the cinnamon to 1/2 tbsp and added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I cut my strawberries up very small.  If you don't, I don't think the mix will cook around the large chunks of berries.  These are really incredible!  So glad I made them!

I followed Ashleyco's advice and added yogurt instead of applesauce and oats, and cut the cinnamon in half and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, and I also added canned pumpkin instead of the oil and used egg whites instead of eggs.  This came out AMAZING!  This is definitely my new go-to muffin recipe.  Although I'm not sure I would say they're "giant" since they didn't rise very much.

Read the reviews and made some changes of my own: only had 2 bananas, so put in some extra applesauce; used 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup oats (after putting them in the food processor a bit); cut back on cinnamon, and used fresh strawberries cut up nice and small. They were delish!

These were amazing! Whole family loved them! Now, as much as I hate to admit I did change two things..used cake flour..and added more applesauce instead of oil. I'm 100 sure that these would be just as fantastic with the whole wheat flour. Thanks!yum!!!

Don't listen to the negative reviews, these muffins are the best I've ever made... And the healthiest. Instead of eggs, I used generic Egg Beaters, instead of oil I used more apple sauce and instead of brown sugar I used generic Splenda brown sugar mixture (1/2 cup). I also added a half teaspoon of salt and an additional half teaspoon of allspice. One other tip: chop your strawberries into tiny bits and mix them into the flour mix BEFORE adding the bananas + wet mixture. This will help ensure that your strawberries don't sink and that each muffin contains an even amount of strawberries. Also, I used really giant muffin tins and got only six (6) muffins, not 12 as the recipe suggests.

I did 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat. I substituted sour cream for the applesauce as that's what I had on hand. I kept the spices as written but found that the recipe turned out a little bland. The strawberries brought a lot of flavor but I think adding nutmeg might be a good idea.

Yum! So good!

I used whole wheat pasty flour, and added an extra 2T, and these turned out nice and fluffy. I also used a peach, finely diced, in place of the strawberries. The result was a bit sweet - I might not put any sugar in next time. I think these will taste good warm with a smear of cream cheese.

These didn't turn out for me (though to be fair I may have mixed too long rather than folding in). I found them bland and boring

Bananas and applesauce are great egg replacers by themselves and with the combination they make the eggs 100% unnecessary.

Kids LOVED it, even made 12 mini muffins too.  Next time I will likely puree the strawberries as I used whole strawberries and then sliced them myself.  I will NOT use muffin liners either, they kinda stick and you lose some muffins.

I followed this recipe with a couple small adjustments. I only put 1/2 TBS of cin., I added 1/4 cup oats and put n a little extra applesauce to keep moist. They were not that great. I won't try making these again

This is my first attempt at homemade muffins & so I followed the recipe exactly.....however I did cook 5 extra minutes b/c mine didn't spring back up after 20.  Very easy to make though!  After reading reviews, I was worried that the strawberries would be soggy but that wasn't the case for me...instead, I could barely see or taste strawberries in mine at all.  I may try cutting larger slices next time!  Very moist though.  Will make again though for sure. Thanks!

These turned out super!! I used butter because I was out of applesauce, half/half white and whole wheat flour, canola oil, and half the cinnamon. I chopped up fresh strawberries and I had enough batter for 24 mini muffins and 10 large ones. They came out moist and delicious.

I wanted to love these, but they were just OK to me. The texture was good and I will definitely make them again, but use a fruit other than strawberry. The strawberries just didn't hold up well in muffins.

I, like ashleyco, used 1/2 tbsp cinnamon. I didn't have nutmeg on hand so I used 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I also replaced the applesauce with plain yogurt, and replaced the oil with applesauce as suggested. I also didn't have brown sugar on hand so I used 3/4 c white granulated sugar. I figured the lack of being packed meant I was using less sugar and I was okay with that. When you make these substitutions it ends up being about 180 calories per muffin, which is pretty awesome. I didn't mash the strawberries, which I recommend and will do next time around. I was worried that I had hyped myself up over these too much and that they wouldn't live up to expectations. They totally did however =D They're moist and super tasty and with the edits, not too much spice at all. Perfect actually - I'd recommend the pumpkin pie spice over nutmeg alone to add more dimension. I didn't find them bland at all. I froze the rest of my batch as someone else said they did- for mine, I wrapped them individually in plastic wrap and stuck them in a freezer bag. I'm excited to have these for breakfast, maybe with some yogurt.

So easy to make.  I used a lot of variations suggested by others: used plain yogurt in lieu of bananas and applesauce since I had neither, and added some nutmeg as well as wheat germ.  Needed a little more sweetness; i might try regular sugar next time.  But super easy and still tasty.

These are really good for using all whole wheat flour.  I actually didn't use banana, instead I threw in some fresh blueberries.  I should have added a little more applesauce to make up for the lost banana moisture.  I was really impressed with these muffins!

These turned out fantastic - I cut the sugar a bit by not firmly packing it (because my bannanas were very ripe) but they are still quite sweet. I think next time I would cut the sugar a little more.

i can't say i'd make these this way again. they were dry (& i was careful not to over mix the batter), and very bland, mostly i tasted cinnamon. i would suggest using 1/2 white flour and maybe even reducing the flour by 1/4 cup, or adding 1/4 cup of o.j.  but my 1 yr old just gobbled up an entire muffin and loved it, plus, they're healthy, and i think they'd taste better with a dab of butter on them, so i'll give them 4 stars.

Made these yesterday.  I give it 4 stars because I found the muffin itself had a big lack in flavour.  If you get a piece of a strawberry in your mouth, then it tastes okay.  But those "plain" parts of the muffin were seriously in need of something more.  I think the muffin overall is not sweet enough.  I would either add more brown sugar or add white sugar.  I wasn't looking for these to be super healthy, so I don't mind adding a little more sugar.  Even another banana or so wouldn't have helped.  I'm not a banana-strawberry lover but I liked these  because you can't taste the banana too much.  Overall I liked these muffins because of texture and appearance.  They cooked for 20 minutes, like the recipe says.  I probably used more than the one cup of strawberries (maybe 1 1/4 cups), and I also used fresh ones that I cut up into quarters.  The strawberries do get mushy after cooking, so I would suggest cutting them even smaller if you don't like mushy in your muffin.

These were moist and yummy...and quick.  Great recipe to make with a little one.  Used fresh stawberries and this likely offset the sweetness, as they were just sweet enough.  Thanks for the recipe, Mimi!

YUM! I just gotta say, I was kinda disappointed when I tried it warm, but this morning, cooled off, they were wonderful! I used all applesauce, and 1 cup AP flour, 1 cup ground oats (oatmeal ground in spice grinder to a flour).  I also used fresh strawberries. Just as other people said, you couldn't really taste the strawberries... maybe I would add another banana or blueberries next time.  Either way this is a great healthy recipe that's helping me keep to my diet! Moist and delicious, and not too sweet!

I followed the recipe exactly (although I did mash the strawberries) and it was AMAZING!  They are sweet- but not too much- and are super moist!  They will definitely become a staple in our home!

They smell excellent, and are easy to make. I only had a little taste, what with the beach coming up and all, but my 17 month old daughter ate 3 and I had to draw the line at 4. Now THAT'S a compliment.

I can't seem to ever follow a recipe exactly. I used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose flour, added 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp strawberry extract, doubled the vanilla, and made a "crumb" topping that I accidentally used too much butter in. It wound up being more of a caramelized brown sugar topping, but, was still super yummy. I wasn't making these with health in mind. ;) Also, my bananas were huge but I used 3 anyway. For me this made 12 regular sized muffins and 48 mini muffins. They are SO yummy! I don't taste the strawberry that much (even with the added extract) but maybe that flavor will come through more tomorrow. I am really happy with these, they taste nice and rich, and have the perfect amount of sweetness. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent muffins! I made up a batch today and they disappeared! The only thing I changed was to add chopped pecans to the mix before the flour, to help break up the bananas and strawberries.  I was also making a batch of Strawberry Syrup at the same time as these muffins, so I just skimmed off 1 cup of smashed strawberries from the top of the cooking syrup and added them to the muffin mix with the bananas.  Yummy, yummy, yummy! I will make these again!  
---Made this a second time: I switched out 1 cup of shredded yellow squash for the bananas and it made a wonderful strawberry squash bread!

Loved this recipe.  My kids each wanted multiple helpings.  It was nice because I have one that is allergic to milk and butter and I didn't have to worry about changing the recipe to accomodate for her allergy! I did add about a half a cup more of fresh strawberries and about a half tsp of salt.

I made these as regular sized muffins, doubled recipe.  They were great!  I changed the baking soda to 1 t. soda + 2t. baking powder and boy did they rise nicely!!!  I also cut the sugar back perhaps a bit too much, I would go with 1 cup.  Also I suggest putting on a middle to hi rack, the bottoms browned (NOT burnt) but became tougher than the rest of the muffins...  I had it on a med-low rack so I think just too close to heat source.  Very moist, and being as I originally cut sugar back to 1/2 c (oops!) we will be eating with honey butter!  YUMMY!

This is a great recipe! We are lucky to have very sweet local strawberries, so we halved the sugar and the muffins still turned out so well. Love them!

Theser muffins really are a great starting point, and per the reviews of others I did make some changes.  Used no oil, less sugar (only 1/4), less baking soda (1/2 t), only 2 large bananas, only 1/4 c apple sauce, and added the following: 2 T ground flax, 1/4c quinoa flakes, 1/2c oats, 1t baking powder, 1/2c strawberry yogurt, 1/4 agave, 1/4t pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4t cardamon (in addition to the cinnamon already in the recipe).  All other ingredients remained the same.  Ate one right out of the oven (yum!) and let the others cool and stored in a lidded container to keep moist.  Still seem to be lacking something... might add a tad more salt next time.

Great Recipe! I altered just a bit for added good health. Added 2 tblsp ground flax seed meal, 1/4 cup quinoa flakes, and 1/4 cup oats (or oat bran works). Added a 1/4 cup extra applesauce due to additional dry ingredients. Reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tblsp plus 1 tsp Stevia powder. Very moist and sweet, so could reduce sugar more. Made with strawberries the first time and they were delicious. Making with blueberries today - can't wait to try them.

the addition of the oats (1/2 cup)makes a less soggy muffin.  I have made it with and without and prefer with for sure!  I like to add a heavy sprinkle of ground flax to the recipe.  Have made using strawberries and blueberries - both came out yummy!

This recipe was delicious. I substituted more applesauce for the vegetable oil and doubled the cinnamon. I would definitely reccommend using fresh strawberries. The last few muffins went bad because the strawberries made them a little more soggy even though they remained frozen until they were baked.

Some changes I made make these delicious AND very healthy: like other reviewers, I substitued nonfat plain yogurt for applesauce and applesauce for vegetable oil. I also just added 3 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs, splenda in lieu of brown sugar. I doubled the cinnamon, added a splash of nutmeg and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder. I also added about 1 cup of chopped walnuts, used frozen strawberries, 2 large mashed bananas. These were DELICIOUS and so nutritious! I highly recommend trying it!

These are really good, a definite keeper! I followed the advice of other posters, adding allspice and fresh strawberries, but subbed oat bran for the 1/2 cup wheat germ, since that's what I had on hand. The finished product flew off the cooling rack, especially after my 17yo DS tried them spread with strawberry cream cheese!

Very yummy! I increased the baking powder to 2 tsp., decreased the cinnamon to just 1 tsp., added a scant tsp. of salt, used whole wheat pastry flour, and diced fresh strawberries.  Turned out great!  With less cinnamon the subtle flavors of the strawberries  and bananas come through nicely.  Made 18 muffins, just a little larger than standard. This one's a keeper!

Really great muffins for being so healthy!!  :) I didn't have apple sauce, so I substituted plain yogurt. I also cut the Cinnamon in half (as others recommended) but did not use nutmeg... I just don't like the taste. They were fabulous! oh - and I used fresh strawberries... we had gone strawberry picking and had so many!

These had a the best texture I have found in a whole wheat muffin so far. I used half oat flour and half whole wheat, 2 bananas, replaced the applesauce with berry yogurt and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup. The strawberries are wet in the muffins, I think blueberries would work much better.

I have made these in the past and enjoyed them, but made some modifications this time around that really made them better - used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour instead of all whole wheat - I think this made them softer.  I used 2 bananas instead of 3 and also added 3/4 c oatmeal.  I also decreased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 2 tsp baking powder.    It is strawberry season here, so I used a cup of fresh picked strawberries.  Holy cow - these were soft and full of sweet strawberry flavor and the oatmeal gave them a little texture.  I also love that they are not too sweet.  I hate when a muffin tastes like a cupcake.

I have made these muffins twice now and everyone seems to like them.  I used the strawberries the first time and they were OK.  I much prefer fresh blueberries which gave the muffins more "pop".  I also used canola oil  This recipe will be in my permanent file

I followed the recipe exactly and found these to be wonderful! My sons are 2 and 4 years old and begged for seconds! Reading some of the reviews about the taste makes me wonder what went wrong- because these are moist with well balanced flavor. Very wonderful, this recipe is staying in my book. Thank you!  **for oil I used canola oil, for flour I used King Arthur Whole Wheat flour, the bananas I used were very very ripe, and the frozen strawberries were some that I had bought fresh and frozen myself.

I altered the recipe to what I had on hand and to make it even healthier.  1 egg, 1/4 cup flax meal + 2 tbls water, 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup non-fat sour cream, 1/2 cup non-fat vanilla yogurt,1/2 cup oatmeal and a dash of nutmeg as well. I also used frozen mixed berries instead of strawberries.   These were delicious with the changes we made, although I am sure they would be great without the changes.

These were fantastic.  I brought them on Friday morning into the office and they were a huge hit. I actually doubled the recipe and added about a half cup of walnuts.  But both with and without the walnuts they were great.

REALLY good base recipe for whole wheat muffins. They are unbelievably moist!  I would recommend cooking for a solid minute less (maybe even less depending on your oven). Definitely needed more spice, but I prepared as directed on my first go around, and my kids (9 months and 2 years) completely devoured them!

Try these, seriously.  Based on other reviews, I swapped the oil for applesauce, and fat free greek yogurt for the applesauce.  I also used fat-free fake eggs and left out the strawberries and just added more bananas, and the muffins were FABULOUS!  they were moist, super tasty, and shockingly healthy.

Made these tonight with the yogurt/applesauce substitution others used.  These were great!  Moist, sweet, very good.  Make sure you drain the strawberries to avoid the gooey factor.  The strawberry banana combo is perfect.

I've been using this recipe for over 2 years now.  It's wonderful as is but now I use it as a starting point for all the muffins I make.  I love to sub wild blueberries and add ground flaxseed.  I make a batch on Sunday and know my kids have a great breakfast for the whole week.  Thank you!

These muffins are good but I also found them a little lacking in the flavor department.  And as other mentioned the strawberries make the muffins gooey, and that's even after I diced them quite small.  But over all they were a good healthy option for a muffin.

These are pretty tasty, but make them your own. I cooked about 25 minutes, pureed my strawberries before I added them, used closer to 1cup of brown suger (and they're still not sweet enough, but some powder sugar on top cured that!), added a few pinches of ginger for an extra kick, a rounded 1/2TB of cinnamon, 2TB ground oatmeal (heartier), and 2TB flax meal (nuttier). Also at the very end I poured a bit of white sugar and then grabbed a smaller frozen banana and mashed it right in to add gooey texture (but not mushy like strawberries might give it) to the finished product. They're pretty tasty and smell suuuuuuper good while baking. But warning, if the batter doesn't taste strong enough, add extra sugar. I used regular muffins and had enough mix for 18 muffins and 12 minimuffins!

These were a huge hit! I made them at the same time as a regular batch of Banana Nut Bread and the in-laws liked the healthy version just as much. I omitted the cinnamon, just because I don't like it. I also went on another reviewers suggestion and used yogurt instead of applesauce. I added about 1/2 cup of pecans. I really liked the tartness of the frozen strawberries. I didn't bother with 'folding' in the bananas, I just beat them with everything else and it turned out better- no large gooey banana lumps. I didn't have large muffin tins, so I put some in regular muffin cups and made a loaf of bread out of the rest. The loaf was more moist than the muffins, but the muffins were fantastic with some butter. I will always make these now instead of the regular bread.

Awsome!  I made these for breakfast this cool, rainy Adirondak summer morning and they were delicious.  I used whole wheat graham flour and had frozen blueberries mixed with my strawberries.  I'm sure any frozen berry or frozen chopped fruit would work well with these.  The kids loved them.

Great healthier muffin recipe. They aren't too heavy, but lighter than expected. I used 2 bananas and the added 1/2 cup oats. Instead of strawberrries, I used a cup of frozen mixed berries. I made sure to mash them up so I wouldn't end up with soggy chunks. It worked out perfectly! YUM!

I made these for breakfasts, since my 16-year old daughter wanted something healthier than cereal or oatmeal. I thought they were so moist and light and tasty. The banana and strawberry combination was perfect and the hint of cinnamon was just right. 

I actually have not made these in a while and am printing this recipe right now to go shopping for the ingredients. I'm craving these for a morning treat. 

I feel comfortable giving these to my 21 month old, as well, as a nice alternative to his usual of bananas and a Nutrigrain Bar.

followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1 cup of frozen blueberries instead of strawberries and they were delicious.  The muffins were both light textured and moist and were the perfect sweetness.  Thank you for a great recipe.

These muffins are so good!! The first time I made them I was having a weekend of no sugar, so I replaced the brown sugar with half a cup of honey, and they turned out really well. I also used frozen blueberries instead of strawberries (later I made a batch with fresh blueberries, WAY BETTER!). When I ran out I decided to make more, but to try it with brown sugar. The brown sugar definitely made them better, but not by too much. I have had a constant stock of these muffins since I first tried them. They stay moist if you leave them out (although I'm not sure for how long, because they never  last much more than a day around here), so there's really no need to refrigerate them. These are the best muffins ever!

This was my first try at baking with whole wheat.  These muffins are fantastic.  Very flavorful and moist.  I used chunky applesauce.  I'll definitely make these again.

Excellent for a low-fat healthy muffin. I made a few minor changes that did not change the great quality of the muffin! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used peachy/applesauce and a tad bit less oil. Still nice texture, flavourful, but not too sweet! Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Fantastic!!  I have long searched for a tasty 100% whole wheat banana bread recipe and this is it.  I made 1/2 the batch with mixed froz. berries and those were definitely very very moist (as pointed out by other reviewers) but I left out the berries in the other 1/2 and they had a lighter texture.  I preferred the denser berry muffins, my kids liked the plain.  Everyone wins:)  Thanks Mimi!

These were just great!.  I used fresh strawberries and just froze them the night before.  Two other ladies at work thought they were the bomb.  Very sweet, and super easy to make!

YUM!  What a great healthy recipe!  I made a few changes... I cut down the oil and sugar and used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  I used yogurt instead of applesauce.  I used fake eggs.  I substituted some of the flour with Wheat Germ.  I used the food processor on my fresh strawberries.  I added lemon zest and juice (for a light tartness) and blueberries.  These are awesome muffins with great flavor and texture!  Thanks!!!

Delicious muffins!  Wonderful flavour and turned out very fluffy for all whole-wheat dough and not too sweet, but sweet enough.  Definite keeper!

I thought these muffins were very good.  They weren't too sweet which I think is perfect for a healthy muffin.  I used fresh strawberries and mashed them which made the muffins very moist.  Delicious!

I needed to use up some bananas so I tried this recipe.  The batter tasted great but next time I would use a different kind of berry.  The strawberries made the muffin soggy and kind of dissapeared, so there were big holes in the muffins.  I was very pleased with how high they rose, so I will be keeping this recipe.  They tasted best fresh from the oven.

I don't like Banana muffins so I used some of the advice left before me and made the following adjustments: I soaked and drained 1/2 cup quick oats to help make up for the density of the bananas and added them to the wet ingredients, I cut the cinnemon down to 1 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. salt. I subbed sugar for 1/3 c. brown sugar & 1/3 c. honey, subed 1/4 cup WW flour for wheat germ, didn't do strawberries, and added 1/2 cup each of dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. TO DIE FOR!! THANKS

This was my first muffin recipe, and I don't think it was a great idea. Not that bad though, but mine turned out a little bit bitter, i'm not sure if it's the strawberries or not. If i'll do it next time, I sure will add more sugar to it.

I've been looking for whole wheat muffin recipes and I really liked this one!  I used all whole wheat flour, and added 60% cacao dark chocolate chips because I didn't have any strawberries.  They turned out very well, and I will be making them again with strawberries!

I have to say I REALLY loved these muffins!  I did sprinkle a little brown sugar on the top before baking.  They are light - healthy - and very tasty.  I am a firm believer that every muffin deserves butter slatheres over it while warm prior to eatting - I can happily say - I never needed a drop.  Wonderful recipe.  My 9 year old son loved them too.  I would imagine this as a great quickie breakfast.

I had sleep-over company and added these muffins to my bacon and eggs breakfast.  They were a hit!  The only things I would change would be to omit the strawberries and use less brown sugar.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Tasty, especially for a lower-fat muffin.  I used peaches instead of bananas.  Mine were a little too wet.  Next time I'll cook them a few minutes longer.

I loved this recipe. I'd been searching for a good muffin recipe, but most came up dry. This one was moist and delicious! I substituted about 3 tbs of wheat flour for wheat germ, just to add a little extra, and I added a few more strawberries to the mix too. I loved these so much that I made 3 extra batches to freeze and pop out later. !!!  thank you.

These muffins are fabulaous - we actually decided not to use the strawberries the second time around b/c they were too mushy for our taste and loved them even more.  Peaches might be good, we'll try that next.

These are so good....just ate 2 hot out of the oven, and I usually have so much more restraint! I halved the recipe, but still used 2 large bananas. This made 5 muffins in a large tin ( each about 2/3 filled). Will make again!

I used 1.5 c. w/wheat and .5 c. white flour because I wasn't sure of the texture.  I also used only 1.5 tsp. cinnamon and chopped fresh strawberries.  I only filled the tins 3/4 full and they needed 25 min.  I'm also at 3500 ft. elevation, so that could have something to do with them needing more time.  They were just less than gooey, I will try baking them for a few more minutes.  Good taste and healthy though.

Very good! I've been making them for breakfast for my kids, and they enjoy them so much they've been asking for them for lunch and dinner, too! Instead of using strawberries, I use blueberries and fold in about 1/3 cup of diced walnuts.

Yum, yum, yummy!! Thank you so much for this recipe. I loved it!! I do have one confession, though. I didn't have any applesauce in the house (I hate the stuff), so I put a stick of lite margarine in place of the oil and applesauce. :-) I don't care, though, they're delicious!!

These were certainly not what I thought they would be. I had used fresh strawberries instead of frozen which managed to turn the muffins into globs of goo, despite the extra baking time for regular sized muffins. Not overly tasty either. But I do like the whole wheat flour and addition of applesauce! Maybe blueberries would work better.

I used frozen raspberries instead of sliced strawberries. My husband gave a 5 out 5 even though he does not like to give 5 star ratings! Next time I will  try reducing the sugar as we are always trying  to reduce our sugar intake.

I have tried many whole grain muffin recipes over the years, and this is by far my favorite as they are so very moist.  Since one of my children are allergic to strawberries, I actually put a little extra banana and some mini chocolate chips.  Probably not quite as healthy, but yummy none the less.

I used apple sauce that had been sweetened, so I cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup. I also used fresh strawberries from the garden - which were delicious!
The muffins turned out pretty good, not too sweet!

Made these muffins  and they did not turn out like many of the reviewer's described. My muffins were very mushy, even though I baked them much longer than the suggested time. I Put one and a half cups of cut strawberries instead of one full cup. This was probably why they turned out mushy. Will try again another time

This was amazing! I had some frozen strawberry compote so I made some modifications. instead of oil I use butter because I love the flavor! I omitted the applesause because there is lots of extra juice to the strawberries.  I also added 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup oats. this balanced the compote fantastically and made the muffins extra big in the pan ? love love love the flavor!

These were great, but I did make changes.  I cut the sugar in half, subbed vanilla greek yogurt for the applesauce and then subbed applesauce for the oil.  I also added some chia seeds and ground flax.  I used white whole wheat flour and baked them in regular muffin tins for about 18 minutes.  They turned out great!  My kids love them!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was searching for a recipe I could alter to make even healthier and to be part of my 21 day fix diet. The strawberries I had in freezer there ended up being freezer burnt so decided to leave those out. I used all Unsweetened apple sauce and only 1/4 cup coconut sugar and 1/4 cup honey. I also added a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla. 
Half I stirred in some dark chocolate chips for my kids and topped some with walnuts. 
They baked up in the 20 mins. I'm interested to see the texture of them tomorrow.. Today they were perfect warm out of the oven.

These were absolutely yummy and incredibly moist.  First of all I must say that out of necessity I had to make some small changes.  I was tripling the recipe but didn't have 3 tablespoons of cinnamon; used probably 4 teaspoons (didn't even measure) and I live overseas where whole wheat flour costs a fortune so I used 3 cups whole wheat and 3 regular white flour.  I didn't measure the frozen strawberries either.  I had a bag and I actually put them a few at a time in my food processor to chop up and then I added them to the flour before adding the other wet ingredients.  I read that mixing the strawberries first with the flour would keep them from sinking to the bottom of the muffins.  It was a bit hard to get it all fully mixed and there were a few spots of white flour but they couldn't be tasted.  The bananas are definitely the strongest flavour but the strawberries can be seen and I am sure they add to the moistness.  No pockets of wetness which others complained about.  Wonderful, wonderful muffins.  My ladies loved them.

Great recipe for those watching sugar intake. I made it with regular flour since that is what I had on hand. It was not a very sweet recipe, but super moist and still delicious. If you like sugary stuff you may want to up the sugar. I used regular sized muffin tins and filled 3/4 full and ended up with short muffins and enough left over for a full size loaf pan.

I followed the recipe as written and it was absolutely delicious! The second time I made it I poured all the batter into a bread pan. I added a smidgen more oil and added a few more strawberries plus chia seeds. And it was even better. Baked in a loaf pan makes this bread even more flavorful and moist. I baked it at 350 deg. for 55 minutes. Everyone in the family loves it.  I'm always looking for high fiber/high nutritional recipes for my husband that doesn't taste like cardboard. And he who despises whole wheat anything eats up this bread like candy. I have not told him that this bread contains all whole wheat flour. Shhhh....it'll be our secret!

I made it vegan by using two flax seed "eggs" and added sunflower seeds for extra health benefits.  Flax seed "eggs" are made by a tablespoon ground flax seed mixed with two and half talblespoons water, let sit 10 minutes.

Made a few tweaks to the recipe by looking at other reviews, and I think these muffins came out very good. I used plain yogurt instead of applesauce, used applesauce instead of oil, and added 1/2 cup oats.  Instead of frozen, I used 1 cup fresh strawberries, diced. When I mashed the bananas, I also mashed the diced strawberries with them. I had a little problem with the muffins sticking to the tins, but I greased them before so it wasn't too bad. Overall, I really loved the fresh fruity taste to these muffins, and will be making them again!

I couldn't find a recipe for strawberry muffins, so I used this one, substituting in three cups of pureed strawberries. I also replaced the eggs and vegetable oil with applesauce. Overall, I am very pleased with the way these turned out despite the changes I made.

I used baby food, half apples and half sweet potatoes in place of applesauce and bananas (4 small jars) instead of mashed bananas. I also used frozen mixed berries since I didn't have strawberries. I agree, use less cinnamon. Otherwise delicious and moist!!

I made this gluten free by omitting the wheat flour, substituting Gluten Free All Purpose flour AND arrowroot as a binding agent...can use xanthum gum as well...
I substituted coconut sugar for the brown sugar. Instead of oil I substituted pureed zucchini
muffins look different when cooking gluten free but are delicious all the same

This is a good base, but I think it requires some personalizing to make it great. I will make these again, no doubt. Next time with a lot less cinnamon, more vanilla, and blueberries instead of strawberries. To each their own; the possibilities are endless.

These were very good and my two boys really liked them, too!  Any healthier options that they will actually eat are much appreciated!  I only had 2 bananas so added a little more applesauce and threw in some oats as another reviewer suggested and I thought they were very tasty.  Will plan to try with blueberries when I have no frozen strawberries as I'm sure that would be really tasty, too--thanks for the recipe!

I was impressed by how delicious these muffins were!  I am usually annoyed by recipes that use applesauce to replace oil, but this recipe has some oil and it actually tastes better with the applesauce (I tried replacing half of the applesauce with oil and it wasn't as good).   I usually double the strawberries, but one time I didn't have enough strawberries to double so I added in blueberries and it was just as good :D

I loved the texture of these muffins but 1 Tbsp of cinnamon is WAY too much.  Next time I'll half the amount and then I'm sure they'll be perfect.  I didn't have strawberries so I used frozen blueberries.

This is a great recipe. I followed what some users suggested and put about 1.5 tsp of organic cinnamon. I also reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and 1 and 3/4 cups of all purpose flour and 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds. Next time I'll do 1.5 cups of flour and .5 cup of ground flax. I used melted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and instead of frozen I used fresh strawberries, sliced. Next time I'll put 1.5 cups of diced strawberries, for a more even distribution. All in all they taste delicious, they're super moist, and not too sweet (just the way I like it!) and most importantly, they're a much healthier alternative to buying a pastry from Timmy's or Sbux!

I am always looking for a healthier muffin and was delighted to find this recipe. I've never had strawberries in a muffin before and was pleased with the results. These muffins are moist and delicious. I used half the oil and next time I think I will use half of the sugar. So glad I found this recipe. Thank you Mimi! p.s, they didn't last long in my house!

I made 24 mini-muffins and 12 regular size muffins from this recipe. Baked the mini muffins for 10 minutes and the regular size for 15, both on convection bake. Love the flavor the strawberries add. I think I'll add chopped pecans next time. Everything is better with nuts!

I have made these muffins several times now and they always turn out great. I cut back on the brown sugar but other than that, I keep the recipie the same. I cool the muffins and then freeze them. I take one out each morning and put in a bag to thaw for a mid morning snack while I am at work. Super moist and very delicious.

This recipe was good however I did make some changes.  I used all purpose flour, all applesauce and no oil, plus I used fresh strawberries.  Not as fluffy as I thought but still great.  I decided to make 24 regular size muffins instead of the 12 large ones

Thought these were just okay. Not especially flavorful but not bad either. Think they would be good banana muffins without the strawberries.

Not too bad for whole wheat--nice texture and taste.  Not overly sweet.  All of my kids (ages 2-15) liked them.  Next time I will try adding more strawberries.

I followed the recipe with the exception of halving the cinnamon (I ran out!) and using fresh strawberries. SO GOOD! I made them for my daughter's school birthday celebration and ate so many I had to immediately make another batch. I made mini-muffins and cooked for 12 minutes.

we love it! diced instead od chopped fresh strawberrys. used 1/3 c.lowfat vanilla yogurt instead of the oil.had cinnamon already in the applesauce so I didnt add more. used 1 1/2 whole wheat graham flour and 1/2 c wheat germ. I think next time I will decrease the sugar amount a tad.

These are really yummy, but I would use .5 ww flour and .5 white. Mash strawberries.  They will make about 16 muffins.

I really like the flavor of theses muffins, but they are kind of heavy.  I guess this has to be an error of mine since everyone else said thiers turned out light and fluffy.  I did change a few things like adding a half cup of oats, using all purpose flour, substituting applesauce for the oil, and fresh strawberries.  I think maybe next time I will just follow the directions exactly.

I made these tonight for a retirement bash in the morning for our Director.  I did change up some of the ingredients.  I added extra applesauce omitting the oil.  I used frozen strawberries as it said, but that was a mistake.  Maybe next time I’ll try fresh strawberries or dried ones and let them rehydrate in the batter.  The muffins themselves came out great, I was able to make two dozen from the batter.  They are pretty dry though.  Maybe a slab of butter in the middle will make them a little less dry?  Couldn’t really taste the strawberry in them either.

Yummy for a healthy treat!  Made these as a b-fast alternative to breakfast bars.      I did make some changes - used yogurt instead of applesauce, used 1/4 C agave nectar and 1/4 C brown sugar (as a few reviews stated theirs were still good with less sugar), added 1 t baking powder, used 1/2 T cinnamon and 1/2 T allspice (as a few reviews suggested) and for the flour I wanted to up the nutrients a bit so I did 1 1/4 C whole wheat, 1/2 C quick oats (processed in a spice/coffee grinder for finer texture) + 1/4 C flaxseed (also ground), used frozen mix berries that I had on hand with a handful of sliced fresh strawberries, and finally added some chopped walnuts.    Turned out great!  The only change I would make next time is mashing/processing the fruit up a bit more or using all fresh...bc they were a little mushy in spots from the fruit chunks...    Would also be great with all blueberries or with chopped apples!    Best part - my little one (2 yr old) thinks they are cookies ;)

With the addition of a little salt (to balance out the sweetness), these are good.  I will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out pretty good. The strawberries gave a strange texture, it seemed like it created a filling and I found it to be a little off putting. Besides that, they were super moist and I would reccomend them, but  would try blueberries or rasberries next time.

These are just delicious!  They will be perfect to throw in a lunchbox or grab for breakfast on the way out in the morning.  I did a 1/2 & 1/2 mixture of vanilla yogurt and applesauce and used some fresh strawberries I had on hand.  I also cooked them about 2 minutes longer so the bottoms would hold up a little better.  I made 2 batches and did the small muffin size - 24, rather than 12.  The only change I might suggest (that would take away from the whole wheat intent) would be to make 1/4 of the flour portion with white flour.  Whole wheat can sometimes be a little heavy.  But they're just wonderful overall - kids are going to love them!

Here is what I did: I did not use oil and used vanilla yogurt instead. Added 1/2 cup oats as suggested by other reviewers. When these came out of the oven they were great, except the batter did not cook evenly; the area around the frozen strawberries did not set. A few hours later the frozen strawberries were plain slimey. My 4 year old was even grossed out. I will try these again with the addition of oats and subbing yogurt for oil, but will not use the  strawberries. I think that nuts, dried  fruit and fresh berries would work really well, or dehydrated strawberries.

These were pretty good. To store these make sure that you refrigerate them. I made the mistake and didn't and the banana from the recipe turned them brown. I thought these were a little bland for my taste though. I will probably not make these again.

Awesome muffins! So much lighter in texture and just enough moisture (I used large bananas)than store-bought muffins. I thought I had frozen strawberries on hand, but I actually had "berry medley"--blueberry, raspberry and blackberry mixture, which worked wonderfully. I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of a tablespoon, and it was just right. I made no other substitutions. The batter made 8 muffins instead of twelve, but that is fine for the four of us. I had never tried this muffin before at Mimi's---I'm a Buttermilk Spice Muffin fan----but I don't need to, now that I have this great recipe! Thanks for posting, MIMI128!

Wow, delicious! Used 1 cup whole wheat and 1 cup regular flour and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup as they were for my 1 and 3 year olds. Used fresh strawberries that I had frozen and they were so sweet! Will definately make again!

These are very tasty!  The only thing I did differently was to add 2 T ground flax meal, and I had to use all oil (went a little short) because I ran out of applesauce.  Also, I did mush up the fresh strawberries that I used.  The one thing these are missing is a little salt.  Maybe that's what the applesauce would have done to help resolve that issue.  These will be great to add to our morning rotation of breads for coffee!

Another keeper. I reduced the cinnamon by half, used apple and peach sauce, and added more strawberries. All purpose white flour works well also. I make them in batches and freeze them. When filling the muffins cups, I avoid placing strawberries at the bottom.

These muffins were very moist and good, but there wasn't enough strawberry flavor. They mostly tasted like banana muffins. I will make again but maybe add more strawberries.

Very moist and rich with flavor. Used more applesauce instead of oil. Used brown sugar splenda instead of normal brown sugar. And blended the strawberries and bananas. Used only half of the cinnamon. Worked great.

These were very moist muffins.  I did take the advice of others and used applesauce instead of oil, brown sugar/splenda, 1egg and 1 egg white, 3/4 tbsp. cinnimon, 1 tsp. allspice, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 cup oatmeal.  I also used fresh strawberries and it turned out just fine.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I took others advice and added tsp allspice, made mine with all applesauce to replace the oil,Splenda Brown Sugar blend, and with egg whites. I made mine into a banana bread and omitted the strawberries another reviewer said she cooked hers for 50 minutes be careful with the temp/time mine were only in about 40 minutes and I almost burnt it. SOOOOO GOOOOOD! Thanx for sharing such a great recipe.

These are very yummy!  My 4 year old thinks they are sour (from the strawberries), but I thought they turned out terrific!  I also put a little less sugar in them.

Yummy!  I made these exactly as the recipe is written, they were very tasty & moist.  My 6 yr old picky son wanted one of these for dessert INSTEAD of ice cream!  I'm making them again tonight and will try some fresh blueberries!

These were soo good... I was afraid they would be a little bland, but they were sweet enough for me even with taking out a tablespoon or two of the sugar.  I put in a little extra banana and put the frozen strawberries in a food processor and was very pleased with the texture.  Light, tender, very moist.

Good, moist muffins were a hit with DH and co-workers. As another reviewer suggested, I added 1/2 cup old fashioned oats. Used blueberries instead of strawberries. Substituted apple butter for applesauce, sugar, and cinnamon. Next time I'll add a bit of salt.

I thought these were pretty good but missing something.  Most baked goods call for salt to bring out the flavors so next time I think I'll try adding some.

My husband liked these though he was hoping for more of a strawberry flavor, which he didn't get.  I chopped the strawberries up in the food processor and omitted the cinnamon since I used cinnamon applesauce.  I put a few sprinkles of allspice in batter.  Good!

I love this recipe.  Always looking for healthier alternatives for the kids snacks.  I sent these in for a birthday snack and the kids loved them !!.  I also mash the strawberries and even throw in some blueberries.  I use Macadamia oil (healthier choice) which gives an additional great flavor to the muffins.  I make smaller muffins too so I get two dozen out of one batch.  I'll have to try some of the other suggestions that others have tried.  I don't think you can go wrong with these.

These were really easy to make and I love the banana-strawberry combination. I made them the night before, stored them in a plastic ziplock bag after they cooled, and had them the next morning.

Good and healthy muffins.  The strawberries sort of leaked and got gooey so the muffins are easier to handle after completely cooling.  But of course, it's still worth it to eat one fresh out of the oven.  =)

Having run out of white flour I went on a search for a muffin recipe using whole wheat flour.  Boy, am I glad I ran out of white flour!  These muffins are, without a doubt, the tastiest healthy muffins EVER!  Thank you for sharing this AWESOME recipe.  My husband said they were delicious and the sweetness was just right.  Not only that but my very picky sister said they tasted 'heavenly'...this girl lives on potato chips and soda pop, she hates fruit and vegetables and refuses to eat anything 'healthy'.  Imagine her surprise when I told her these muffins were whole wheat and good for her!  A couple changes I made were: using sweetened cinnamon flavored applesauce and therefore omitted the cinnamon and decreased the sugar by a couple tablespoons.  I used frozen strawberries (diced them) from a mixed fruit bag and might try assorted fruit next time.  I mashed the bananas as well.  I used 12 muffin cups and these are very large, perfect for breakfasst on the go.  I am making another batch today...I may never, ever make white flour muffins again!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I really liked these. I found them plenty sweet, I may even cut down on the sugar a bit next time. I didn't have any strawberries so mixed in walnuts and dried cranberries. I am looking forward to trying them again with the strawberries.

These muffins seemed a little lacking in flavor.  I used unsweetened applesauce and unsweetened strawberries...maybe I just needed to add more sugar.  If the strawberries are not cut up small enough they make the muffins soggy.

These turned out well and weren't too sweet, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the oil to 2 tablespoon.  I also added frozen blackberries instead of strawberries.

So far so good!  The house smells amazing...I doubled the recipe, and was able to make 16 mini loaves, and 24 mini muffins. I like the chunks of fruit, so I didn't puree the bananas or strawberries.  I did use the vanilla yogurt instead of applesauce, and added 1 cup of oatmeal. I also topped them of with a crumb topping.  These are really good, but even with both fruits, it seems to lack a tiny bit in flavor!!!!  The family will love these when they wake up tomorrow morning, though...:)***and they did...lol***

Changes made:  substituted regular vanilla yoghurt for applesauce, added 1 cup of chopped pecans, 1/2 cup of oatmeal, omitted cinnamon, and only used 2 largish bananas.  Great results!  I love allrecipes.com because I get to read all the ratings and adjust accordingly. Thanks all!

I made them as mini muffins for the kids and they loved them! Very moist and not "whole wheat" tasting like other healthy muffin recipes I have tried. I used half whole wheat flour and half oat bran flour. Yummm!!

Nice light muffins.  Used homemade applesauce (found on allrecipes.com) and added dried pineapple.

Great for what they are supposed to be--a healthy muffin.  I think I'd like them better if they were a tad sweeter.  I did use sweetened applesauce so I reduced the amount of brown sugar.  Next time, I won't.

AWESOME MUFFINS!!
I made these muffins this morning for our Mother's Day brunch.  People that were on diets were eating 2 they loved them so much!  I even gave the recipe to some of our guests so they could make them for their friends and family.  Thank you for the recipe!

Didn't have applesauce so I used crushed pineapple instead. Worked out pretty well!!! The texture is a little off.

This muffin is very good.  I used the Splenda brown sugar blend instead of the brown sugar.  I think these muffins tasted better the next day.  Very good recipe that I will make again. . . just not quite 5 stars.

These were just okay.  I used strawberry applesauce, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  It was okay, and the kids liked them, but they were not grabbing them up, not even my toddler twins who eat everything (okra, lima beans, etc.)

I liked this recipe, but I didn't love the strawberries.  I used fresh, and sprinkled them with sugar to sweeten up before adding them to the recipe.  They tasted great in the muffin but had an unappealing texture and look.  The base recipe is *delicious* and I think I might try it with some sort of other addition.  This made enough for probably 15 muffins and they were very filling!  My children LOVED them (much to my pleasure!  yay for whole wheat!); they are 2 and 3 years old, so very family friendly!
Overall, I'll be keeping this recipe, but adding something other than strawberries.

These are SO good! I used fresh strawberries (probably more than a cup) and added a couple handfuls of blueberries I had frozen. I left out the oil because I thought the batter was runny enough, probably due to the bananas I used-frozen then thawed so a bit runny. They turned out perfect, will definitely make these again! Great healthy muffin!

Great recipe.  Mine came out very moist, made 18 regular muffins.  I did use 1/2 c strawberry yogurt rather than apple sauce and mashed strawberry as another reviewer suggested.  I think these are a good basic recipe, I'm guessing crazins and walnuts would mix in nicely as well (using oatmeal to make up for volume added by bananas).  Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure how this happened, but I ended up with 6 jumbo muffins and 24 mini muffins.  I ran out of whole wheat flour, so I used 2 cups all-purpose and added 1 cup wheat bran.  With all the sogginess reported about these muffins, I figured that the extra wheat bran would take care of that.

I altered the recipe a bit based on what I had laying around. I used finely ground oats, olive oil, blueberries, and vanilla yogurt. I would definitely make them again with the changes I made, they are delicious! Not too sweet, which is good because I don't like incredibly sugary things! Highly reccomend this recipe; you don't feel guilty about eating them!

These muffins were just OK to me.  I used fresh strawberries and they really didn't add any flavor - I would probably leave those out.  I just thought they were kind of blah.  Sorry!

These are excellent! Super moist and tasty.  I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar.  Also, instead of using frozen, sliced berries I used thawed, whole strawberries mashed up a bit.  This is definitely a keeper!

Have to admit - I used butter shortening because we had no applesauce, but MAN, these are great!  I used chopped fresh strawberries instead of frozen and reduced the cinnamon.  I'll be getting applesauce at my next grocery run - I'm sure the healthier version is just as good.  Thanks, Mimi!

great whole wheat muffin recipe. the muffin's texture was smooth and soft, not coarse at all (unlike most wheat muffins). i made regular-sized muffins and added 1/2 cup of soaked and drained oatmeal.  very yummy. the only problem i had was that the muffin was too moist from the moisture of the banana and strawberry. other then that, the muffin was great

I've been looking for a tasty whole- muffin for ages awheatnd this is it! The muffins had a lovely fluffy texture and the cinnamon made them extra-delicious. My changes/substitutions: I used whole wheat pastry flour, fresh strawberries and instead of the applesauce/oil combo I used real butter (it was for a special treat, so I was willing to take a hit on the cholesterol!).

Absolutely fabulous recipe -- I will definitely make these again!

These Muffins are huge!  They are very dense, but that is ok.  I ate one warm and it fell apart easily.  I had one about 4 hours later and they were perfect.  Great recipe!!!
By the way, use the frozen strawberries like the recipe calls for... fresh strawberries didn't work as well.

I absolutely LOVE these muffins. Exactly what I was looking for, and perfect with your coffee. I love them because they aren't too sweet like most muffins. I've made 2 batches already, friends and family all ask for the recipe. These muffins aren't for everyone though, you have to like the taste of healthy food. I played with the recipe and didn't measure the amount of strawberries. I added some blueberries in the second batch and everything you do to this is great!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

I always want to use whole wheat flour, but it sometimes results in a coarser texture than you want for baked goods. Not so for these muffins, they turn out moist and light with great flavor.  I adapted it to what I had on hand - two bananas and some fresh strawberries, plus I added some walnuts.  They were very good!  Thanks, Mimi.

These muffins were wonderful! I used 1 1/2 cups chopped fresh strawberries and I used light olive oil for the oil in the recipe. I will cut the sugar to ~1/2 cup the next time I make these.

These were great!  Didn't have any strawberries so used 3/4 cup strawberry harvest applesauce and no oil at all.  Had only 2 larger ripe bananas but had about 1/3 cup crushed pineapple leftover in the fridge and threw that in.  No vanilla extract so added banana extract and some rum extract.  Also added a few chopped dates.  Didn't have brown sugar so used all white instead.  These muffins were really wonderfully moist even without the oil.  They didn't stick to the muffin tins which I sprayed with Pam.  Only used 1 tsp. cinnamon, as I thought 1 tbsp. would be overpowering.  The 1 tsp. was just perfect and complimented the other flavors well.  I don't use whole wheat flour much so this is a nice way to get rid of it.  The muffins were perfectly done and not gummy at all.  I really in the end couldn't taste the strawberry applesauce.  They just tasted like a very nice banana muffin that was wholesome and good!

Very good and very healthy.  Even my sister, who's not big on health food, loved these.

I love these muffins. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tbsp Splenda & 2 tsp cinnamon. I chopped my frozen strawberries nice & small but next time I'll up the amount to 2/3 cup since I didn't feel like I got enough strawberries. Tip-generously spray muffin cups with nonstick cooking spray & the muffins will come out so easily. I used a normal sized muffin pan & cut the recipe in half & got 10 muffins. Baking time was around 15 min. They tasted so great & thank you!

I used frozen, sliced strawberries and included some of the juice for extra flavor.  They're very good and moist, and I will definitely make these again.

These are great. I made according to directions several times and they were a big hit.

One of the reviewers said it seemed like it was better as a loaf so i tried it and no it is not.  maybe because i live at high altitude now im not sure how to alternate my recipes yet but the middle was completely gooey...i stuck it back in for about 20more minutes until the sides were burned...and it was still uncooked in the middle.  i will try this again as muffins and see how it bakes.  thanks for sharing the recipe it sounds great if i could make it right 8)

This muffin tasted great and I loved the healthier alternative ingredients.  I subsituted 1/2 of the brown sugar with Splenda granular and used fresh strawberries.  The muffins were very moist and tasted great.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I only substitute fresh strawberries for the frozen.  My 3 year old devours them with gusto and my husband who usually avoids anything remotely healthy loves them.

These muffins are the best.  I've already made them twice and will keep on making them.  Thanks for a great muffin recipe.
