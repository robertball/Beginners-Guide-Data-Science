I use vegetable bullion for the stock as it adds more flavor.  This is one of the most versatile wild rice recipes I have made.  I used mandarin oranges, green grapes and dried cranberries for a summer picnic.  For the salt, I used untoasted chopped cashews.  Excellent recipe and one I will use a lot for the different seasons.

This recipe is loved by our family.  We make it for holiday supper.  People are generally hesitant to try it, but once they do, they are hooked.  I always keep my toasted pecans on the side and let people add them on top.  That way they stay crispy.

Excellent!  good as a sandwich or wrap filler, too.  Try dried carnberries instead of grapes.

Wow. :) One of my favorite salad recipes of all times! Have made it on several occasions and everyone has always loved it. It looks beautiful with all the different colors and has a wonderfully refreshing flavor. Can also serve as salad and side dish in one, if you don't have time to prepare both.

This was only OK.  The kiwi and grape added nice flavor, but I could not taste the dressing at all.  If I make it again, I will try to add some zip to the dressing with garlic or paprika or ginger.

I thought that the lemon with the rice was a very odd flavor.  I had to add some onion, garlic and ginger to dress it up before I even considered serving it.  It was much better with the additional flavors. I also added more olive oil.  I won't make this salad again in it's original form.

I served the sauce on the side. Everyone tried it, but chose to not add it to their entire portion. Fun way to serve rice and kiwi, though. Used a "wild blend of gourmet brown rice," so it was kind of sticky. Guessing that's not the case with regular wild rice, but we like brown rice. This has opened my eyes to serving rice with fruit! Pecans were great as a topping. Will not make the sauce again.  Will also try the dried canberries another reviewer suggested.

Pretty good as I made it.  Used 1/2 cup Jasmine rice and 1/4 cup wild rice.  Omitted the Kiwi as the ones at the store we terrible and I didn't use ANY chicken stock as I was cooking chicken with it.  Doubled the dressing.  Was very good.  I used some of the rest the next day in a wrap sandwich of turkey, lettuce, and cheese.  That was even better!

Wow, what a delicious blend of flavors. I loved the dressing especially. :) My friend and I ate the whole portion (4 servings!) ourselves. Yum.

It's something different for a side dish. I think it needed some more dressing, couldn't taste the lemon at all.

This has great potential, but was nothing to write home about as is.  Little too much lemon in the dressing and it could actually use more rice.  Use a strong and nutty wild rice - maybe a red jasmine - to make it more flavorful, and you will be better off as well.

I followed the directions exactly, I used real lemon juice...  it was way too tart for my taste and really had no other flavor.  I won't serve it again.

Great concept that could be modified to suit tastes!  The texture is wonderful!  I do agree that there is a tad too much lemon flavor though.  I recommend using fresh lemon juice and not bottled, too.  Bottled adds a synthetic flavor that detracts from the lovely combination of other flavors.  Will be a regular at my house!

Just not really crazy about this, husband even less so.  I did cut the lemon juice back to 2 tbsp, and that was a good decision.  I knew there would be leftovers, so I did not add all of the dressing to the salad because of concerns over it becoming mushy.  Will finish this off for lunch tomorrow at which time I'll add the rest of the dressing.  Served this evening as a side to tilapia with lemon peppercorn sauce and honey glazed carrots.  OK, but honestly, don't think I'll be making this one again.  UPDATED 7.18.12:  I just bumped this up to 4 stars after having this for lunch today.  What I found is that we liked this MUCH better "cold" as opposed to warm.  Now I will say that I WILL be making this again.

I thought this looked good, and the basic recipe was okay. But it was pretty bland, at least for my family's taste. I added some ginger, paprika, and lemon juice. Even then, it wasn't that great.

This was disappointing.  The only thing I did differently was cook the wild rice in water, not broth like the recipe instructed.  I didnt think it would make that much of a difference.  I wont be using this recipe again.

We didn't care for this at all. I was trying to use up some wild rice I had in the freezer already cooked. The wild rice was just too ... wild, and didn't go with the fruit. The pecans were good and I might try it again with asparagus, mushrooms, or something.

Really good. I did however make a double batch of the dressing for my family's preference. If you sub Vegetable stock instead of chicken this can also be Daniel fast approved

Make more dressing than recommended.  Doesn't flavor the salad as is.  Extra dressing helps to increase the flavor.  Made with dried cranberries and mandarin oranges.

Excellent, easy salad. I added a little fresh lemon zest too.
I added the honey and lemon while the rice was warm so really absorbed the flavors nicely.
