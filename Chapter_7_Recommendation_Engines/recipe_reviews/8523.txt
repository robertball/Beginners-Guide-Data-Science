This meal was extremely bland.  Though healthy, it was lacking in flavor.  I would suggest adding more tomatoes to add flavor and also, when sauteing the veges, add fresh garlic, onions, and additional seasonings (basil, oregano, etc.)  This is a great idea for a meal, you just need to get creative with it.

I don't really understand the "bland" comments. I think salt, pepper and a little fat (olive oil, butter) are all you need: chicken should taste like chicken, zucchini like zucchini. Hey, I'm all for bold flavors and spicy foods, but sometimes simple equals better. Treat your ingredients with care; don't overcook your chicken; season it well, and you have a fabulous meal.

I made this for dinner; it was fast and yummy!  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, 1 tsp of  minced garlic, and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomatoe.

This was really delicious!  Any changes made were because I wanted to add additional vegetables - not because of the recipe itself.  I added onion, garlic, fresh mushrooms and a handful of fresh peas and Italian parsley.  I really changed no seasonings.  I did only use EVOO - no butter. One of the other reviews said, what's wrong with plain chicken - in this instance - nothing.  This was a hit in our home.

This is a really simple and delicious meal! I omitted the butter and vegetable oil and just used olive oil instead. Instead of the tomato, I substituted with a can of diced tomatoes. I cut the chicken into strips and then sauted with seasonings, and then added the canned tomatoes and squash/zucc and sauted all together. This was really yummy! I've made it a few times already!

Yummy! This was so easy to make, and my husband really liked it. I used up left over grilled chicken breast from the night before. For veggies I added: zucchini, mushrooms, green onions, and a tomato. For seasoning I added: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a montreal steak seasoning that jumped out at me. Very good especially for low carb eating!

This was delicious.  The second time I made it I added fresh green beans, as much squash as would fit in the skillet, and 3 tomatoes.  Ground pork also works in this recipe.

I loved this. My brother and husband found it a little bland, though they liked it enough to eat it. I thought it had plenty of flavor and I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. I made a chicken rub from salt, pepper, cumin, and ground ginger.  I also added onions, two cloves of garlic, yellow bell pepper, and fresh mushrooms to the veggies.  I sprinkled with dried basil in addition to salt and pepper. No problem with blandness!

I was not expecting the results that I got from this wonderfully simple recipe!  I had the meat department slice a couple of chicken breast for me and sauteed the chicken, squash, onion, and zuchini all together.  All I did was sprinkle a little garlic salt and pepper over the whole thing and let it simmer.  At the last minute I threw in a chopped tomato.  How easy could it get, but the result was the absolute perfect summer dinner!  Thank you so much.  I am passing this on to everyone I know that is lucky enough to have garden bounty this time of year.

It was a bit bland and we found ourselves adding soy sauce or BBQ sauce to give it flavor. I probably won't try this one again.

This meal was so delicious and the chicken was extremely juicy! Following the suggestions that many have made I added a sprigs of fresh rosemary to the pan and used to garnish the dish.  They added a very nice flavor to the dish, but not overpowering.

I just made this tonight, really great!! I love fresh veggies.  The only thing I did differently was add garlic.  But I feel the need to add garlic to everything.

Very good! I substitued olive oil and PAM for the butter and veg oil and garlic salt for the reg salt. I also used basil leaves to season and the chicken and I added mushrooms, a sweet onion, and a green bell pepper. Delicious! Next time I will try serving it over penne pasta.

I made this with boneless/skinless chicken thighs, it helped with the dryness.  I cut the chicken into peices and served it all over egg noodles. It will be a new staple in our house.

This was good, but the chicken was slightly bland.  I added chopped garlic to the vegetables and they were awesome.  I'd probably saute some garlic before cooking the chicken first, but I'd definitely make this again.

Easy and good. Great recipe to scale to two or for eight. I suggest adding whatever you have from the garden or refrigerator--peppers, garlic, onions, mushrooms. Think it is too bland for your tastes? Go with some Cajun or other seasoned salt, or hot sauce--that is an easy fix for any cook who bothers to think outside the recipe box.

Wonderful!!!  I omitted the butter because it burned quickly in the bottom of the pan and instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil as a healthy alternative.  Also, I cooked the chicken for 2 minutes per side as directed and then moved it into a separate dish.  I then added the cut up squash, zucchini, and tomato with the peel to the pan and cooked the vegetables for approximately 5 minutes.  After that, I added the chicken in with the vegetables and allowed it to finish cooking together.  Season slightly with salt and pepper.  My whole family loved it!

This recipe surprised me.  I found it looking through the daily photos and decided to try it to use some squash from our CSA and a package of chicken breasts.  It was yummy.  I did add some garlic and onion to the veggie saute and a few mushrooms that were floating around my fridge.  Oh, and a splash of Chardonnay.  I also had some leftover fire roasted diced tomatoes that I used rather than the fresh.  It was very popular with my little girls too.

With the addition of garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley and marjoram this was edible.  But flavorful and memorable it was not.  I think this would be a good recipe for someone recovering from surgery or a stomach ailment as it was very bland and lightly spiced.  If your favorite foods are boiled potatoes, lime jello and grilled cheese sandwiches on white bread, then you will LOVE this.

I took the  hint of "too bland" and added some green onion and garlic.  Had some mexican style stewed tomatoes left over from the night before so added them vs the "real" tomatoe.  Delish! And such a quick recipe.  I cut the chicken breasts in half and still cooked them at times posted in the recipe.

Great recipe if you're looking for something healthy and tastey.  Chicken is a little bland.  Eat it with the veggies in the same bite and you won't notice.  Next time I will add garlic and onions to add flavor to the chicken.

this chicken is definitely NOT bland!  I did use some garlic as earlier suggested but it only enhanced the taste vs. disgusing it!  I also threw in some mushrooms as I had some fresh in the frig!  Great meal even my picky 6 year old liked it!

I used shredded chicken and sautéed fresh garlic before putting the squash and zucchini in the skillet. Then I added some fresh shredded cheese and avocado on top. It was delish!

Instead of plain chicken, I baked the chicken with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, I also stewed about 6 tomato's and simmered the summer squash/zucchini in tomato sauce. Season everything to your liking and this recipe is bomb

I followed the basic recipe, but amped up the seasonings and used 2 cups of fresh Jersey tomatoes.  Before sauteeing the chicken, I made a seasoning of 1 tsp each of salt, dried oregano, dried thyme, rosemary & a half tsp pepper.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks and sprinkled them with the seasoning before cooking.  I also added 1/2 cup of diced onion and one minced clove garlic to the veggies.  Finally right before serving, I sprinkled a bit of fresh basil on it and served over pasta with fresh grated Parmesan.  Fabulous summer dish.

I am originally from the Middle East and we cook chicken with  zucchinis all the time. In these recipes you must add a lot of chopped onion and garlic with the vegetables. Then put the seared chicken on top, and bake for 20-30 min. adding the onion makes the dish very delicious.

Prepared this for dinner tonight and thought it quite tasty and simple to fix. I tossed a little red pepper in too but didn't need it. I was surprised to read some of the comments suggesting this was bland, both my husband(who hates bland) and I found it flavorful.

i like this recipe a lot and i make it often.  it's easy to alter according to what you have on hand.  i've made it with fresh tomatoes and canned, and they are both good, but the fresh is best.  sometimes i throw in some fresh mushrooms, and if i only have squash or zucchini but not both, it still turns out fine.  also, i use paula deen's seasoning on the chicken when i brown it instead of just salt and pepper.  i don't think it is bland at all.  i don't let all the juice cook off and i serve with orzo or rice.  it's a good, healthy meal.

I like this recipe.  I used chicken cutlets, and salted, peppered and then added garlic powder and some dried basil.  When I flipped them I did the same on the second side.  I used yellow squash, zucchini and tomato like the original recipe.  There was not a lot of fat to drain so I just used the juices, and spices to flavor the squash a bit.  I am not a veggie lover, but this is a very palateable meal for me to eat a lot of tasty veggies.  YUM!

Great simple recipe to make on a weeknight!   I used olive oil instead of butter, cut the chicken into strips, omitted the tomatoes and added onion, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder. The chicken and veggies were great over couscous!

Call it 4.5 … very tasty & received many compliments. I agree with those advocating additional ingredients; I added 2 Tbsp each minced garlic & finely chopped dill. Next time, I will increase those by 50% or more and the tomatoes by 2-3x. Will also add 1 C +/- Vidalia onion.

I loved this dish. I don't tolerate onion or garlic, so finding flavorful recipes that don't use those are difficult. My husband's brought home zucchini and squash a few days ago and I found this recipe to use them. I only had to buy the chicken breasts and I used canned tomatoes rather than fresh because that's what I had. My son suggested that I add green pepper next time, but I thought it was delicious as is.

This was a nice light dinner. Hubby liked it too. I followed the recipe with a couple of additions. I added chopped onion to the veggies and seasoned my chicken with some Mrs. Dash table blend in addition to the suggested seasonings..

I did make this on Wednesday. It was delicious. 
The only changes I made were as follows: I did marinate the meat for 3 hours in orange juice and and a squirt of lime juice with a tablespoon of sugar and sprinkled a  teaspoon amount of Adobo with pepper. I then cooked the meat on the grill first instead of the pan and then set it aside. I then followed the rest of the directions for cooking the meat. The boneless  chicken was super tender and juicy and the squash and zucchini were perfectly crisp but yet tender. 
I will make this again!

We thought it was very good.  I added mushrooms and part of a hatch pepper, they aren't hot. When I make it again I may add garlic. I added the tomatoes after I took it off the heat since we don't really care for cooked tomatoes. My husband told me I should make it again.

I grilled the chicken for the first part and just cooked the squash in butter, salt and pepper, then followed the recipe and it was unbelievable.  Family loved it.

It was good as written (used olive oil, not veg oil). The second time I made it I used olive oil, added fresh basil, 2 cloves garlic, 1 med onion sliced into rings and sliced baby portabellas mushrooms... Fantastic!  Served with grilled potatoes, arugula salad and a great bottle of Chardonnay.

This combination is really good.  For those who think it's bland, try browning chopped bacon in the oil before adding the other ingredients.  This is also good with thinly sliced potatoes added.  Italian sausage makes for a tasty dish with these summer veggies!

This is an extremely easy and healthy meal. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and added a touch of garlic powder and a tablespoon of onion flakes. Was the most delicious meal I have had in a long time.

Hit the spot/easy!  I did add a little to the recipe like green onions, more tomatoes, and some spices.  It was a little bland in the original form for me.  I was looking for something light and easy- this was the trick.  (Note: the veggies were really soft so hope you like that.)
