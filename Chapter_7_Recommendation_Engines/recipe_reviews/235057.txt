This soup came out really good. I used a bag of dried Northern beans that were soaked overnight.  I put the soaked beans in a pot and added  vegetable broth and simmered for a little over an hour until the beans were soft. Next I added the rest of the ingredients (along with an 8oz can of tomato sauce) and let the soup simmer for another hour. At the end I added more salt and pepper, a dash of cayenne, and crumbled bacon. Thanks for the recipe:)

I ran out of olive oil. Therefore, I used vegan butter. I didn't have any bay leaves on hand either. I used everything else the recipe called for and I didn't miss the bay leaves at all. It cooked for 45 minutes as suggested. The seasonings came together so well. I can't until it set overnight. This is perfect for the health conscious, as well as anyone whom love northern beans.

My husband says this is the BEST bean soup ever!  We try to eat vegetarian through the week and enjoy meat only on the weekends.  Great recipes like this make it all possible.

I increased the recipe. I used 48 ounces of cooked beans. I used about 4 carrots and 4 Yukon Gold potatoes. I also added about 8 ounces of vegan "benevolent bacon" to the broth. This came out quite well and a large pot of soup disappeared in about 3 days. I will definitely make this again.

Very good bean soup! I made minor adjustments to my taste, and a little less broth because I like a thick and hearty soup.  I will make this again!

I have 4 teenagers and a toddler that are all picky and like different things.  The first time I made this, I expected only 2 to eat it.  ALL of them love it and ask me to make it.  Huge hit in our house.

Excellent recipe very easy to make but, I would not add the salt to the pot. Add salt to taste when you eat it.

Simple instructions, made it in a Instant Pot.  Used dried beans, did not even soak them.  Cooked for 6 minutes, removed them from cooker, left them to finish soaking up the liquid.  Used sauté setting, sauté onions and garlic like instructions said.  Added extra garlic, 2 large  potatoes, 1 sweet potato and a little winter squash.  Drained and rinsed the beans returned them to Instant Pot.  Added more broth and cooked for 6 minutes, let the steam release on its own.   Perfect Soup. Can’t wait to try it tomorrow.  Expect it to be even better

Simple, easy to make.  Added some fresh chopped tomatoes and cooked it in my pressure cooker.  Is the calorie count listed correct?  400 calories seems high given that 1 cup of cooked beans is 200 calories.

Used this as a basic starter.  Sautéed bacon in stock pot then added the olive oil and sautéed the veggies just like recipe says. Used dried beans that had been quick boiled following package instructions. A pinch of sugar and a tablespoon of canned jalapeño and a little white pepper. My picky husband said make them exactly like this from now on.  Delicious with rice and cornbread. Served with a grilled pork tenderloin.  Good dinner!

Very good recipe!  I simplified it by using better than bullion vegetable broth, already chopped garlic, both from a jar and added a ham bone from Thanksgiving to give it a little more flavor.  I just threw everything in the soup broth and cooked it until done.  It was that simple. This made a delicious bean soup meal!  Hubby keeps telling me "that was really good and we can do that again". (7th  time in one hour).  I'm not the cook in the family, so this was a big compliment.  We plan on sharing this recipe with friends and this will be the only recipe we will use in the future.  Thank you for posting.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, and he asked that we put it into consistent rotation in our dinner menu! The only changes I made were garbanzos instead of great northern beans (that was what we had) and I used dried beans that I had soaked overnight, measuring out 2.5 cups after soaking. To cook the whole soup, I used a pressure cooker, still following the recipe as is but simply cooking all ingredients except the greens on high pressure for 30 minutes. The flavor was rich and hearty; I topped mine with parmesan and served it with cheese bread!

This is my go to recipe for bean soup!  I have made it as written and made adjustments based on the ingredients I’ve had.  My family loved it when I added leftover ham.  My vegan kids loved it when I made it as written.  You can’t go wrong with this.  Thank you for sharing.

So good! I made a double batch, added extra potatoes, and used Better Than Bouillon vegetable base mixed with water for the broth. I decreased the garlic, spices, and salt a little initially, with the intent of adding more if needed. It didn't need it. Broth was very flavorful. I may add egg free dumpling noodles next time.

I've been trying to transition into a whole food plant based diet for the past few months and I've tried about a dozen or so recipes from various sources. This one was my favorite so far. I love the flavor of basil and bay leaves. I actually realized I didn't have any thyme so I'm looking forward to trying it again with it.

I added 1/2 pound Eckrich smoked sausage cut up in chunks, 2 slices crumbled cooked bacon, & two more medium sized cut up peeled potatoes.  I thought it turned out great and really enjoyed the soup.  I don't think I would have liked it as well without the sausage & bacon additions.

I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth instead.

This was yummy. I used my own broth made from the bones and drippings of a pork roast. (So, not vegetarian.) I used sweet potatoes instead of regular ones just because I had a bunch of them, and I found that I needed another teaspoon of salt.  My teenage son just ate 3 bowls.

Great flavor! It is perfectly cooked as is. I am not vegetarian but I've had it exactly as is, and I have also replaced the beans and potatoes with 2 cups of cooked chicken and 2 cups of cauliflower rice and it's perfect both ways. A really great base of flavors and super filling!

Followed it to the letter and felt it lacked in flavor.  Basil however was a bit overpowering.  Not well balanced.

So good!  I made it just as the recipe stated except adding spinach.  This is filling and very healthy, so glad I made it.  I'm not a vegetarian but I did not miss the meat at all.

Easy & good! I used butter to sauté, only 1 bay leaf & added spinach to individual portions after it was done. (I'm a bunny). Make it!

This might be the best bean soup I've ever made!

I made the following adjustments:
Used 1 lbs  northern beans, soaked overnight, simmered for 75 minutes
While the beans were simmering, sauteed I large sweet onion, 10 baby" carrots, 2 stalks celery in corn oil.  Added I piece cinnamon bark, nutmeg, 3 sprigs fresh rosemary, red pepper, worshistere sauce and balsamic vinegar.  
After 5 minutes turned off the heat, added 3 cloves chopped garlic and 1 chopped fresh tomato.  Add 1/2 cup coconut milk..  Stirred and Covered

Poured the cooked beans and 2 chicken bullion into the large saucepan that has the veggies and simmered for another 10 minutes.  Added 1 cup of dry Israeli CousCous (small pearl), then simmered another 10 minutes...Turned the heat off and covered.

After it cools pour into 1 quart containers and refrigerate.. Served Chilled!  Very creamy and very sweet.

First time making soup, so as a beginner i did not realize that when using dry beans, you have to cook them first XD. All is well though. I put it on 3.5 for like 1 hour 45 minutes and the beans were fine. I also only put in 3 cans of broth, which was more than enough.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, my husband and I loved it and I will definitely be making this again! I only had one can of beans so I added an extra carrot and an extra potato and omitted the celery and salt.

Loved it. Out of celery, so I added celery seed and kale. Substituted orzo pasta for potato. It was a huge hit, great flavor!

I was looking for a soup to use my pack of dry cranberry beans, stumbled on this recipe and thought I'd try it. So my soup isn't exactly what this one should be but from following the directions with what I had on hand it turned out to be great! 
I washed and soaked my beans overnight in salty water, then put them on the stove to simmer for 20 mins. In the meantime I cooked garlic, onions and carrots (didn't have celery in my fridge and I also run out of basil), added it to the beans with finely cubed potato since the beans were almost done at that point, and left it simmering for another 10 mins. The beans might have overcooked just a bit but overall it turned out fantastic! Strong hearty bean flavor with no spices other than salt and paper. Now I need to try it with the intended ingredients :D

Vegan, yet hearty!  Made this soup because I ended up with two cans of northern beans in error. I'm glad for the mistake because this recipe is great!  I reduced the basil by half because a tablespoon seemed like a lot, although the recipe likely would have been fine with a whole tablespoon; and I needed to add more broth. Used "Not Chick'n" cubes for broth. Added a pinch of red pepper flakes based on another review and because we like a little spice.  This recipe is a keeper - I'll be buying northern beans on a regular basis. Thank you!!

Love this soup! Very tasty as is. I've made it several times and added some cayenne pepper on a few occasions, which is great if you like the added heat. Perfect for an easy autumn dinner. Kids all enjoyed it as well.
