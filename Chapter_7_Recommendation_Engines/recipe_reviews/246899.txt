This was a big hit at our Luau party. Kids were so excited and everyone wanted to try the lava, and lava rocks.

I loved it! It was so chocolatey and good. I added some black fondant for more details, other than that I followed the recipe.

My daughter and I made this cake for a science project .We wanted it to be a little larger so we used an additional cake mix prepared the same as the first two.We also used an angel food cake pan for the base layer, a medium stainless steel bowl for the middle layer and a small stainless steel bowl for the top layer .We doubled the frosting recipe and added a layer of frosting between the cakes ..We used the marshmallow cream  version of the lava ..We cut a small hole in the top layer of the cake .cutoff a top of aplastic water bottle, added a few decent Pieces.of dry ice, then the lava cream and 1/4 c water on top .and added green (trees) icing .The cake was moist and chocolatly.Was a big hit for the class room of approx  25 kids , and there were no leftovers

Everyone loved the cake and I loved how easy it was! I was a bit lazy too and skipped the candy lava - instead I used red, yellow, and orange M&Ms to give the appearance of lava, would definitely make again - especially the frosting!

I followed this recipe completely for the cake and frosting, but I was too lazy to make the candy lava.  Fabulously moist cake with wonderful chocolate frosting (has a Ganache like flavor). My 14 year old son loved it. The dry ice/marshmallow cream/water mixture is sooooo much fun!!! It oozed out and smoked forever. I paired this cake with the sparkler candles and it was super entertaining.  I was able to purchase the dry ice from publix and we used less than 1 pound. I cut the top off of a water bottle and used it as the funnel. I cooled the marshmallow cream mixture for a few minutes before pouring it in the bottle. This would be a great volcano for school--it spewed way longer than our Diet Coke/mento combo.  This was an epic birthday cake!!!!
