I had an abundance of cabbage and had already made my creamy, mayo based coleslaw. I came across this recipe during my search for a different type of slaw..it was a hit. I made it as part of my Christmas dinner,and even the children loved it. The only changes I made were that I added a little red bell pepper (mostly for color) and I added a half tsp. of ground mustard. It was superb!

Delicious! I made this two days ago and I'm making it again today! Rather than being heavy like regular coleslaw, this one is light and refreshing! I only used cabbage (left out the other veggies) and decreased the sugar slightly and it came out unbelievably delicious! As other reviewers have said it is definitely better the next day. I was afraid the cabbage would be soggy, but instead it remained crisp while soaking up the dressing. Even if you don't have time to let it sit overnight I would recommend making this first so that it can marinate while the rest of dinner is being prepared. You have to try this!

Great vinegar coleslaw recipe - not too sweet.  I used extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar - yum!

Made as stated.  It was good, a nice change from the creamy sort.  I wish it was a little more tangy though-maybe it'll be better tomorrow, or I'll try some white vinegar next time.  Still very good.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. I changed it up a little bit for our tastes: (1) Used 1/4 cup of white vinegar since I didn't have cider vinegar, (2) Added 1/2 teaspoon of honey to help cut the bite of vinegar, (3) Added two big servingspoons of Miracle Whip to make it a little creamy, (4) Used a liberal amount of dried chives since I didn't have any fresh onion. This cole slaw was delicious!!

This was really good. We prefer the vinegar based over the mayo based slaw. The only change I made was using a bag of the coleslaw mix rather that shredding my own cabbage and carrots.

Excellent!  I'm trying to lose weight so mayo-based salads and dressings don't fit into my plans and I was really missing coleslaw at cookouts and events.  This was delicious and fits in perfectly with my eating plan and I actually like it better than the mayo-based recipes.  I did add some minced garlic to it, but that was the only change I made.  And it does taste better the longer it sits and the veggies stay crisp and crunchy.  Thank you so much for sharing this one.

This is a nice spicy alternative to creamy coleslaw.  It was wonderful on top of the Sourthern Pulled Pork (also from this site). Made a great sandwich and was good on it's own too.

I love this coleslaw. I do not like creamy slaws; so this one is perfect. The only change I make is substituting 1/4 honey for the 1/4 of sugar. Awesome!

Very good receipe.  I particularly liked the light dressing as it doesn't mask the salad.  Not the ordinary slaw dressing.  I even used this on tossed salad as well. Very good and this will become my "go to"

During our last BBQ this was the first dish to empty! Excellent...used packaged angle hair cabbage, next time I'll use something more course.

This recipe reminds me of what was served at a Jewish south east FL deli (Brothers).

I always find that these types of recipes are better after 24hours in the fridge, and this is no exception :) It was really good on corned beef sandwiches and russian dressing. Didn't change a single thing and it was really nice on corned beef sandwiches.

I am not a coleslaw fan but when I made the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork (also found on Allrecipes) I figured I would please the masses and pair it with a coleslaw. By chance I stumbled across this recipe and oh boy was I pleasantly surprised. Great flavor and without that awful creamy texture you find in other coleslaws! It was delightful on top of the pulled pork sandwiches but just as good solo.

This stuff is addicting. I like it best the first or second day. I use about 1/3 head of cabbage, 1-2 carrots, green onions, skip the celery and peppers, with half the dressing and it's perfect. A lot of water comes out of the cabbage as it sits in the fridge, so it's better to start out with less dressing.

I loved this!!!  I used Splenda and 1/2 canola and 1/2 olive oil to ramp up the healthy aspects of this great recipe.  Tangy, crispy, and yummy.  Great diet food for any health issues.

I have made this several times for gatherings and it is always a hit.  The last time I made it I was out of cider Vinegar and I used Red Wine Vinegar instead...it made it even better.  Love this and it is healthy, too!

What a great light salad. We had it tonight with short ribs and it was the perfect side dish to offset the heaviness of the ribs. Easy to make, delicious, and healthy! Thanks, Pat!

Great, I used ground pepper but it was not ground fine, next time I think I will use plain black pepper.  This is a great low calorie side dish that my fiance likes and he usually doesn't like coleslaw.

Love this, but as usual my husband doesn't like it.It still gets five stars from me though  I don't like creamy coleslaw and this one is perfect for me. It just gets better the longer it sits. I love it with a sandwich for lunch during the week.  A real keeper.

An excellent textbook cole slaw recipe for us novice cooks - it's perfection is in it's simplicity.

Great option for a coleslaw without mayo.  It goes great on or with sandwiches (esp. pulled pork).  I used less sugar and more vinegar (I used some wine vinegar).  It was a big hit!

This was good. I used raspberry blush vinegar and added sundried tomatoes, a grated granny smith apple, radishes, a little dill flavoured saurkraut, chopped spinach and garlic.
