I doubled this recipe and baked the cake in a bundt pan for 45-50 min. I sifted the flour. I might add another egg next time for moister cake. However, the rich, simple butter sauce was a nice complement. A little grated orange peel might be nice to add to the sauce.

My mother has made this cake at Christmas time for thirty years.  I have come to anticipate it as much as all the other things we wait for at Christmas.  The only thing I noticed different about this recipe from my mother's is she uses cake flour instead of all purpose.  Not sure what the difference would be.  The combination of the tart cranberries and the sweet buttery sauce is delicious!

This was great! I really enjoyed it. I think the only change I would make would be to add perhaps 1/2 tsp. of salt (I'll have to experiment to see.) It had a bit of blandness that I think was only the lack of salt rather than flavor. As suggested below, I added a topping of cinnamon, flour & sugar, and it was excellent. Yum!

Very moist cake.  Can also bake in bundt pan for 40-45 minutes (frozen cranberries; slightly less if fresh cranberries).

Really good cake!  I made a few minor changes - in the sauce I used only 1 cup sugar and half the butter. In the cake, I had to use lemon juice (2 tsp) instead of zest and I also subbed Splenda for half the sugar. I tossed a few chopped pecans and a bunch of cinnamon with a couple pinches of flour and sugar and sprinkled that over the top before baking, which I highly recommend for presentation. I thought this was plenty moist as is.  Also thought I'd mention it has a pretty strong nutmeg flavor.

Very easy-- followed recipe exactly, and it came out great.  I brought it to a party-- didn't bring the cream sauce, but served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  A big hit!!!

I prepared this cake for 80 people and it was the talk of the night. Easy to make, followed the original recipe.

Not only was this cake phenomenal, but it was quick and easy. The cream sauce brought it over the edge from being a nice "afternoon tea" kind of cake, to something worthy of the holiday table. Next time I might try mixing in some other fruit (dried apricots or frozen blueberries) and maybe even some nuts. Absolutely wonderful!

This was okay in terms of the cake itself, I have not made the butter sauce yet but I'm sure it will make this much better.  I added 1  tsp vanilla, 1 tsp kosher salt, and 1 tsp cinnamon instead of nutmeg to the batter.  I baked it in mufffin tins, made 12 nice sized muffins.

I have made this twice and Hmm...I can't decide if I like this or not.  The second time I omitted the nutmeg and orange zest and I used 2 Tbsp. of Almond extract instead.  It was a little better but still needed more sugar or something as I felt it was on the bland side, but very tart. The cake is very moist and pretty.

I made this into cupcakes for a bake sale and they were a hit.  Moist and flavorful.  I can't wait to make them into a bundt cake next.

I just made this for my kids, and they really enjoyed it.  I doubled the recipe, and it seemed a little dry when I creamed the butter and sugar, so I added 1/8 cup canola oil for moisture. Also, I did not have whipping cream, so I used evaporated milk for the sauce, and it turned out o.k..
My daughter rated the sauce alone 3 stars, and the cake alone 4 stars, but together she gave it a 5.  Although, she liked the cake enough she said it did not even need the sauce.

Make half the sauce.
