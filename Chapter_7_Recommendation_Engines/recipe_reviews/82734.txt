I was looking for a different way to cook chops. My husband is very particular on his pork.  I found this recipe on the web, but forgot to write everything down.  When I made it I panfried the chops and forgot the cinnamon.  As I fried them I basted the chops with the marinade.  These were absolutely delicious, and my husband actually complimented me on them too.  Thanks.

When I was frying these bad boys, I thought no way it would take in the flavor it just looked messy and the soy sauce gushing out of the chops. BUT when I took a piece off for sampling... OMG DELICIOUS! So surprised... And it didn't take long too cook! Will be making this again and again!!

If you are looking for a REAL Quick dinner - this is it.  Dinner was on the table in under 20 min.  I put the meat in the marinade early in the day and let it marinate all day.  I served it with Lipton's Asian Style Teriyaki Noodles and honeyed carrots.  Just as the noodles were almost cooked I deep fried the pork - mine took almost 5 min. and it was still slightly pink inside which was OK with us.  Tell you Mom thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and quick.  I opted to bake the pork chops and they came out perfectly.

These chops had an interesting flavor, but weren't crispy and took a bit longer than 2 minutes, possibly because I opted not to pound them down.  My husband thought there was citrus involved and was so impressed he took leftovers for lunch the next day which is truly remarkable in our household.  Teens turned their noses up, which isn't remarkable about new things around here.  I served them with white rice, green beans and a salad and will definitely try them again.

These had a good texture. We thought the cinnamon was a strange favor on them.

I HATED PORK CHOPS!  However, these are exceptional!  I doubled garlic and cinnamon as suggested by a previous reviewer, marinated for 2 hours, and baked as directed.  I AM A PORK CHOP LOVER NOW!

This was absolutely delish. Not only was it fast and easy but my boyfriend loved it. He barely came up for air! I doubled up on the garlic and cinnamon for personal taste and it was fantastic. Recommend this to everyone!

These were so yummy.  I opted to bake these in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes.  I also poured the leftover marinade over the pork chops in the baking dish which allowed us to have a sauce.  YUM!!

We thought these were delicious.  Surprisingly,  the cinnamon and soy sauce was a nice mix.  This were so easy and quick to make. I served these with carrots and mashed potatoes.

Cooked this tonight for my boyfriend and his 4 year old daughter. I used 4 bone in chops. Made the marinade the same. Marinate for 1-2 hours. Ours was soaking for about 30 min and I felt an hour or two would have been better. I baked them in a dish that JUST fit with entire marinade at 350 f for 35 min. Flipping them once. There was nothing left!! The kid ate a whole chop, when normally wouldn't eat pork chops at all. Definitely adding it to our family rotation.

It was very good. My chops had a dark brown color (I guess from the soy sauce) however, you could clearly see that they were not burnt. It was very tasty. Really easy. I loved it!! :)

Just made some for the first time and they are great. Don't let the cinnamon scare you.. just watch the time for deep frying. I used rather small chops and deep fried them for approx 4 mins. Will make again. Had to post a pic since there was none up. Thanks Tammy!!!

This is an awesome dish, thank you so much.  The flavors are subtle but very distinct.  I did add a twist.  Before cooking I gave them a quick shake in a bag of flour and bread crumbs with a hint of seasoned salt and pepper.  It added a nice twist of crunchiness to it.

I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to make any kind of meal. I wanted to try this recipe, because I was curious how cinnamon and soy sauce would taste; together. I wasn't impressed. It was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Not bad but not something I'd probably make again.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the cinammon and the garlic.  The chops still had an almost bland flavor.  I deep fried them (1/2" thick boneless chops) and they took about 6-7 min doing two at a time.  Only the fat got "crispy."   My kids did like them so that was a plus.

Mmmmm, yumm. Took a little longer to cook than listed, but the combination of ingredients work very well together!
