LOVED the sauce. I actually made these twice because they were that good. The chipotle sauce really sets these apart from any chili dog you've ever had. When I made this the second time it was just the two of us so I had leftovers and let me tell you that the sauce was excellent for Frito pies too. Definite keeper and 5 stars all the way!
