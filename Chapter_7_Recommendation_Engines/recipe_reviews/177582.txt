I have been making this recipe for years after seeing it on a Prego label and it is my most requested week day meal to serve to my family. Everyone loves it. Quick, easy and all ingredients are easy to keep on hand. The only thing I do differently now is to fry the pepperoni in the saucepan before the other ingredients to render and drain off some of the fat. Then I add the green peppers to soften and then the sauce/olives/cheese. Sometimes I throw in some onions or garlic....whatever you like on a pizza would be delicious. We like this version better than the baked in the oven casserole-style pizza pasta recipes I've tried.

My picky 20 month old ate like she'd never seen food before in her LIFE. The only two changes I made were that I added a can of mushrooms (more to get them out of the pantry than anything else) and used both cheeses as a topping instead of stirring the mozzarella in. This girl right here is not a fan of cheese stuck to her pots and pans.

This was DELICIOUS! I used penne pasta and sauteed the veggies and pepperoni first, just to soften them up a bit. Also, I added some chopped onion, minced garlic and sliced mushrooms. This reminded us of 'pizza pasta'. I could totally see adding any favorite pizza toppings and this turning out great. This will definately be made again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was really good. I left out the olives because hubs doesn't like them. I fried the pepperoni first then I sauteed an onion and the peppers together in the pepperoni oil just because we like our veggies soft. Awesome. Easy peasy and tasty too.

I was looking for something that sounded good and went together fairly quickly for a weeknight meal. This was not it.  Although it went together fairly quickly the taste was just not there.  Maybe it was just the sauce(Prego).

I made this with my own home made sauce the second time. I just can't bring myself to use Prego.
I had a Sicilian Lady Teach me how to make her sauce so I'm a little spoiled to it. Good recipe though

this was quick & easy.  Didn't seem like an unusual combination of ingredients to me, but my husband thought I'd gone crazy.  Daughter loved it, but anything with cheese, pepperoni & olives is a win in her book.  :)

Really good, quick & easy. Added onions to mine. I think I'll add mushrooms & chopped tomatoes to it next time also just for fun. We also like to toast the pepperoni in our toaster oven for 1 min.

Quick and easy, but also a bit bland.  I added some extra salt and pepper upon serving.  I did have to leave out the green peppers due to an allergy so I threw in some fresh spinach instead.  I doubled the recipe because I was making this for a pasta dinner work function and I still came home with an empty crock pot (used to keep warm).

I loved this pasta! It's great to add mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and anything you like! This has lots of flavour and it's so great because it has so much stuff in it!
