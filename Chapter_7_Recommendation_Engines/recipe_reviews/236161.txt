Way better if you use chicken wings. Doubled the spices in the flour mixture. Didn't add ginger in the sauce!

Flour will not bake in an oven without something like egg or butter or milk to make it crisp up. I ended up taking it out of the oven after a few minute after doubting this recipe and fried it in a small amount of peanut oil and managed to save it from inedibility.

I changed a few things, I left out the flour because that will just soak up the juices from the chicken and make them rock hard. I also substituted olive oil for butter in the sauce. Kids loved the chicken, wife and I loved the chicken with the sauce. This will be on the meal rotation for sure.

It was alright, I used olive oil instead of butter. Will make again using more sauce in the future.

TERRIBLE! Wish I could rate these a zero. I followed the recipe exactly, the chicken ended up totally dry and hard, and the flour coating didn't cook at all but just stayed dry in the outside of the hard pieces of chicken..

I thought I'd like these a lot.  'Gotten tired of buffalo.  The sauce was spicy, maybe a little too spicy, before I heated it & put it on the chicken; then, it just became sweet with a teeny teeny amount of spice.  As far as the chicken, I used wings & the flavor was a pretty good fried chicken - which was baked, of course.  Ohhh, I pam-sprayed them before baking.  That's a good idea.  I don't see any browning without it.  'Don't know what I'd use the sauce for.  Maybe egg rolls?  It's four stars before heating.  Disappointed, but that's how it goes sometimes.  :)
