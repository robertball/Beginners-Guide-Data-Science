I just made these. I know they are not in any way authentic, but they were good! I had leftover Costco rotisserie chicken, so I used that. I did not have the cheese in the ingredient list, so I just used a shredded Mexican blend and added 1 tbsp of Philly cream cheese to the mixture when it was in the pan and stirred to melt it. These came together very quickly and were simple, delicious comfort food. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe and easy to modify.  Don't be afraid to use as a base recipe with ingredients you have on hand!  I've made it a few times now, and it turns out great.

My husband gave this a five star and I only tweaked it just a bit.  I too used cream cheese and Mexi-4 cheese blend, added roasted green chilis and cumin and used more onion.  Those that grimace when seeing shredded chicken need to use their mixer next time.  Put the cooked chicken in a stand mixer and beat on low for 30 seconds or the right consistancy.  I have a 20 year old Oster that shreds 6 breasts in 40 seconds!  Bag and freeze in divided proportions for a simple ready-made ingredient during the week.  The trick is to make sure the chicken is warm before mixing - cold chicken is too hard.  We really liked the peppers in this, I may up the quantity another cup next time.  Garnished with some sliced black olives and served with black beans and fresh pico de gallo.  We have leftovers to use now for the rest of the week - yum!

I used this recipe because I was looking for a recipe that had a red & green pepper in it. I didn't have a yellow pepper or the creamy Mexican cheese with Philadelphia. Instead I used a half a block of cream cheese & some shredded cheddar cheese, added some cumin, chili powder & a small can of green chilies. Topped it with green onions & chopped tomato. My family liked it a lot!

I just used this recipe as a guide.  I added black beans and white rice one time and the next tried a brown rice and quinoa mix in them.  Both ways were delicious.  I also used a con queso cheese mix that had salsa added to it as my cheese (I was out of salsa in my house) and Trader joes enchilada sauce this time around instead of the suggested.  My husband, who is very picky loved it!  I added some avocado to top it with on the side.  Enchiladas are fun to be creative with.  Enjoy!

My whole family loved it.  This is going to sound stupid but the picture shows the encliladas in the pan with the seam up.  I tried this and they all just opened up.  Tried "cementing" them with a little salsa but they still popped open.  Ultimately turned them seam down before cooking. Am I missing something?

I give this recipe a five star! its the closest I had to a fresh Mexican dinner all summer and my family and friends loves it! My last location changed their cook and staff so I had an horrible experience with my food tasting like microwave and hearing the microwave going for my entire visit. So I took it upon myself to create the things I love at home and I can mic what is needed and when it's needed lol. With the help of allrecipes I've been able to get a great quality of food for almost half the calories!!!!!!

I tried this recipe step by step excluding the cream cheese and it was great. Just be sure to season the chicken to your liking. I'll definitely TRY it again!!!!
