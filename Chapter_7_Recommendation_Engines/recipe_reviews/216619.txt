EASY & oh so yummy! I did substitute smoked sausage for the bacon & browned 3 mins. each side with some butter, garlic & a few dashes of Worcester Sauce. Added my chopped cabbage & only 1 cup of stock. I also quartered a few red potatoes lightly seasoned with kosher salt & added them to my PC steamer basket. Served up with allrecipes' Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread! HUGE hit with my hubby! Thanks EyeSpy for this recipe!

Loved it. I had already chopped and was sauteeing garlic before I looked up recipe ideas. But other than the addition of the garlic, I followed this recipe and it was delicious.

This was an excellent recipe. Super easy. I should have only used one cup of chicken broth though.  Next time I will make it with sausage like others have done.  I am a new pressure cooker user & I appreciate the detailed instructions.

I left out the bacon and used only 1 cup of chicken broth. I also cooked this stovetop. The taste is great. Next time I will cook it in a pressure cooker.

I love this recipe on the stove so of course I wanted to try in in the pressure cooker.  I skipped the bacon because I didn't have any.  I usually add garlic, onions and crushed red pepper to mine though.  I only used one cup of chicken broth and it came out without excess liquid which was perfect and just like when it's made on the stove.  I don't ever add salt when I am cooking, so when it goes to the table everyone can add their own level of saltiness. I'm happy to make it in the pressure cooker and get rid of the oil when it's made on the stove and then add butter when it's on my plate.  Now I can just sprinkle with salt.

By far my favorite cabbage recipe EVER! I generally brown a little spicy sausage in the open pressure cooker and then add the other ingredients... but I don't add butter since I use the drippings from the sausage. YUM!!!

Don't you love no brainers!!  I made this a one pot meal.  I used garlic, 2 bay leaves, carrots, onions, potatoes, leftover ham & cabbage and of course home made chicken broth.  I also make my broth in PC using rotisserie chicken carcasses. Rotisserie ckns make a much more flavorful broth.  This makes a great one pot meal in 6 minutes.
I also make this with smoked polish.

This was fantastic! I added garlic and sausage to the recipe and cut back on the butter and added no salt. I would make this again and we are not cabbage eaters. The pressure cooker allows fast nutritious suppers and this had few ingredients!

Super easy!  I think it took even less time to make.  I also added some summer sausage to it and it just added to the flavor.  I am really liking the pressure cooker to make quick meals.

Taking suggestions from reviews, I should have followed the original recipe. As a brand new Instantpot user, I'm trying new recipes. I tried this one and as suggested by reviewers, decreased the chicken stock to 1 cup. My cabbage almost completely disappeared and the bottom of the pot burned. No liquid left when I opened my Instantpot.  Flavor was great for what was left...

I also added Polska kielbasa, which has plenty of salt to season the cabbage. The salt I added was overkill. So, first attempt -too salty, follow recipe as far as amount of chicken stock, add garlic and just a few red pepper flakes.  I'll definitely try again!

3.18.18  This was an awesome St. Patrickâ€™s Day side dish to traditional corned beef and potatoes.  Made in the Instant Pot, cooked for 3 minutes after pressure was up, and did an instant pressure release.  Husband said remember this one the next time we have grilled smoked pork chops; he loved this cabbage!

I made a few changes. The most significant was 2 12oz. links of beef Polska Kielbasa cut into 1 in pieces instead of the bacon. I also used beef broth rather than chicken stock, added one chopped onion when sauteing the sausage, and a bit of thyme and Frank's Red Hot sauce when adding the cabbage. I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker on high pressure for 5 minutes, and did quick release. Everyone loved it, and the cabbage was soft without being overcooked or mushy.

My mom used to make it this way for me as a child and it was amazing to see this recipe. The only difference between this and moms was the love that she gave me. Thanks for the walk down memory lane.

There was no need for to so much be broth, I will cut it in half next time. I also added about 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar. It was absolutely delish!

First, I am an experienced pressure cooker user. Instead of the bacon, I used 2 lbs smoked sausage. In the pressure cooker, I  sauteed  the smoked sausage cut in rounds, 1 chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic and spices that I like and then mixed in the cabbage. I like the pot juices over my cabbage and cornbread, so I used  1 cup homemade stock and 1 c water.  With smoked sausage, I like my cabbage softer so I cooked about 7 minutes and quick cooled my pressure cooker.  I saw where one users cabbage stuck and burnt. If you're new to pressure cooking and regulating,   sometimes it is best to use a bit more liquid as you may be losing liquid  as steam escapes your PC.

Recipe seems solid. I panicked, due to inexperience with pressurecooking and added too much liquid. Most other PC recipes I have read seem to insist on "covering " most/all ingredients with liquid. but the fresh chopped cabbage took up so much room in the pot, and left so much airspace,  it would have taken another 2 quarts of stock to cover... Consequently, I added an additional 2 cups of stock, and now I'm reducing the 3 cups of liquid that I poured off the finished product (to use as a soup base). The moral of this story is; the 2 cups of stock called for in the recipe is fine. I served this with some braised Andouille sausage. Perfect!

Good and easy. I added about a pound of smoked sausage, only used 1 cup of chicken broth and added the bacon after pressure cooking. Tasty and so simple.

This was my first pressure cooker meal and it turned out delicious! I made it a one pot meal, like other reviewers, by adding potatoes, carrots and sausage. I also cut the broth to 1 cup and there was still plenty of liquid. We will be having this on a regular basis. Yummy!

Had half a left over green cabbage that I needed to use up, so sauteed  Field Roast sausage (vegan) in some olive oil, and then threw in the cabbage with half a cup of veggie stock.  3 minutes in the Instant Pot, quick release of pressure, and seasoned, to taste with salt, pepper, turmeric, garlic, and a Trader Joe's blend.  DELICIOUS.

Great recipe!  I followed the directions except I didnâ€™t pre-cook the bacon. Delicious!

Very good and so quick to make. I used kielbasa sausage in place of bacon and we liked it. I do want to try it with bacon for comparison. Plan to make it again this weekend.

I'm new to cooking with a pressure cooker/quick cooker since Christmas. Great recipe. I skipped the bacon step and added half of a small ham to simmer along with the cabbage. Ready in 6 minutes, like magic. Ham was fork tender while cabbage was delish (used 2 cups of water with 2 teaspoons of Better Than Bullion (chicken flavor). My only regret...I wish I'd used a bigger head of cabbage to make more!

Used Nappa Cabbage.  Next time will use Turkey Kielbasa to cut the greasiness.  Excellent though.

Yummy with sausage.  I ended up with too much liquid, though, and will try reducing the amount of chicken broth next time.

Added garlic (because I add garlic to just about anything) and threw in some chopped green onions I had to use. 1 cup stock and 8 min in my digital pressure cooker. Hubby says "real good" and I liked it too! I also sprinkled with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Great quick supper!
