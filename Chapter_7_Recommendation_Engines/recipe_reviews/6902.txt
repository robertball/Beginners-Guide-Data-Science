A lovely recipe! I replaced ghee with garlic oil (same amount) and sprinkled the top with crushed garlic. Unfortunately, the bread was very tasteless (ghee gives it more taste I think), so next time I have to double the amount of salt.

Made good tortillas but not fluffy naan.  I don't own a bread machine, so I mixed the ingredients and then kneeded using a KitchenAid with a bread hook.     Also didn't have clarified butter, so I used softened, unsalted butter instead.

Tried the recipe three times.  The first time, I used white, unbleached flour.  The second time, I used 50% white, unbleached flour and 50% whole wheat flour.  Didn't rise quite as much, and needed a little more water.  Had a more interesting flavor though.

The third time, I went back to the unbleached white flour, replaced the 2 tbs butter with 2 tbs of olive oil, and added a tablespoon of milk.  After kneeding, I let the dough double in size before quartering.  This naan rose the most in the oven, but still was more like tortillas than naan.  

The recipe suggests rolling the dough as thin as possible before baking.  I recommend experimenting with the thickness.  Sometimes the dough puffed up more if it was it was left a little thicker.

Naan? 
This makes a superb free-form flour tortilla. Definately not worth the trouble if you are really interested in making naan bread.

I never in a jillion years thought that I could make naan.  It came out fantastic!!  Good thing too, because the rest of my Indian-inspired dinner wasn't so great - so we basically ate all the naan instead.  I will be making this again.  Oh - so easy if you use your kitchenaid to mix, too!  Thanks!

This is really easy and relatively quick to make, compared to other Naan recipes.  Although not quite authentic, it is really good and even my picky daughter will eat.

I needed to cook the naan bread for about two minutes to achieve the right consistency.  This would be wonderful served with curry!

okay for a substitute, but they did not taste or have the texture of naan. Presentation is still pretty good, though.
