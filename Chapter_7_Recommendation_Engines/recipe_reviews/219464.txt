I have made this recipe at least 5 times already and I just found it last month.  It is excellent, and I love how you can turn up/down the heat factor with the amount of chipotle peppers you add.  I love spicy food, so I always add extra, but for those who don't do spicy like that, you can decrease what you add without compromsing the flavor.  The pumpkin adds such a great counter to the chipotle.  I have played around with the recipe the last two times I made it, and I've found that making a roux first helps with a thick sauce.  I saute the onions and garlic in butter (maybe about 1/4 cup) and then add flour to make a thick paste.  I then continue on with the recipe by adding the chicken broth, etc.  Great recipe either way!

Loved this!
I actually made this in a slow cooker: no butter, did the onions in the chicken broth first, then followed instructions as listed.  I used Radiatore pasta.

This has a big (and YUMMY) kick, but if you don't handle spicy well, you could half the chipotle.  Also, if you wanted some protein, this would pair well with chicken.

Great for a fall twist on pumpkin, but I will be making this year round!

I liked this quite a bit. I added more onion because I like it and didnt realize until the very end I was  out of coriander! Very tasty sauce and a nice change from a tomao based one.. healthy too. I'll def make again!

As is, this was way too spicy. The sage was overpowering.  I fixed it by adding another cup of chicken broth and another cup of milk.  After simmering for another 5 minutes, this tasted wonderful.  I recommend cutting all of the spices in half.

This was pretty good. Spicy if you follow the ingredients though... Even for me. I love spicy food but I also don't want it to overpower my dish. I added some sourcream (about half a cup) and brown sugar (about a 1/4 cup or less maybe) to counteract the heat. Served over whole wheat pasta with sauteed red peppers. Delish! I recommend cutting the heat, but otherwise, very tasty dish that can easily be made vegetarian.

This was really, really good.  Served it with poached chicken and fettucini.  The spice level was intense but eating it slowly plus a nice glass of wine with dinner helped cut the burn.  I'll definitely make this again - I can imagine it being amazing on pork chops, I don't think this is limited to pasta!

Instead of using the peppers in sauce, I used 1/2 tsp. chipotle pepper seasoning, water instead of broth, and used soy milk instead of cow's milk.  Once you accustom yourself to the spiciness of the sauce, it is great!  I prefer this to a tomato based sauce on homemade noodles!

I am sitting here eating this and it's so good, I had to rate it before I was even finished! To make it vegan, I omitted the butter (used olive oil spray) and chicken broth (used vegan chix flavored). I used fat free soy milk, too.  I also used about 3/4 of an onion, chopped. I started making this before realizing I didn't have any sage or coriander, so I just used Italian blend instead. I served it over whole wheat penne. My throat is feeling the heat and I am loving this! For anyone on weight watchers, making it without the butter makes this a Core recipe! Bonus :)

Unique creamy sauce if you like pumpkin; so easy.    Although you can't detect the cinnamon, it's definitely a must.  I added extra chipotle.  I liked it!  Thanks Kristincsw!

I was so inspired with this recipe, I ordered a case of Organic Pumpkin Puree as I am preparing for the FALL season!! I am also planning to use this sauce for Pumpkin Lasagna @ Williams Sonoma online recipes. Fresh is always better than bottled. 

P.S. I happen to believe this sauce would pair well with grilled shrimp ontop. 

Kristen, thank you so very much.

I saw this in the magazine and decided to try it to use up some leftover pumpkin. I took the suggestion to use one chipotle pepper to start with since my kids don't like overly spicy food. It was a hit with the whole family. The sweet pumpkin and smoky chipotle flavors blend nicely together and it was spicy enough for us with one pepper. And the onion and garlic were just enough to enhance the flavor without coming on too strong.  My husband even remarked that it seemed like a meaty sauce even though there is no meat in it - just the chicken broth.  We ate it over rigatoni - yum!

I was so excited about this one - it's quick and healthy and contains some of my favorite flavors. I followed the recipe to the letter, but unfortunately it was really not very good. It needed something, and I can't even figure out what would have saved it.

This recipe was awesome. I added it to spaghetti squash to make a pasta dish, which was good. I did add it to some leftover salmon and it was such a great addition to a protein dish. I recommend adding to chicken, fish, or beef. Overall, loved the smoky, spicy flavor.

This was so good!  I had a 1/2 c. of pumpkin puree, so I searched allrecipes for something w/pumpkin as a maindish and got this.  I halved the recipe, and ate it by myself on top of a small tilapia filet that I dredged in cornmeal and sauteed in a little olive oil.  I ate it with kale sauteed with red bell pepper.  For the seasonings, I used all the correct halved amounts, except the cinnamon and nutmeg were a bit small to measure (), so I poured a very small amount in my palms and rubbed them lightly together over the pan.  
I like heat, and this has a nice mild flavor of adobo...if you like spicy, you could definitely increase the chipotle chilis or add a bit of cayenne.

I am soooo surprised at how good this is!  I can't wait to make it for DH (tomorrow?!?!)

First off, I liked it. It had a buttery taste that I wasn't expecting.  I really did like it.  That being said, I won't make it again; the family was totally "thumbs down" on it - they said the taste was just too strange.  Odd, since we like to play with our food and normal isn't normal in our house.  My husband's comment was, "Put lots of cheese on it and then just eat the cheese."  I got a lot of flack about cooking this one, but I really did like it (Oh, I just remembered, I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg) so thank you for the recipe.  My menfolks are just dweebs!

I thought this had really nice, balanced flavor.  I only used 2 very small chipotle peppers with minimal adobo sauce, because I didn't want the heat to overpower.  I did taste the cinnamon and it complemented the pepper not unlike a mole flavor, and I really liked how the pumpkin in this recipe did not slap you in the face.  Served it over whole wheat gnocchi and sprinkled it with crumbled queso fresco.  Brilliant!

Super tasty - unfortunately we did not have the chiles in adobo sauce, so we made a modified version of adobo using chipotle chili powder. I think it may have been even better if we had followed the recipe perfectly, but ours still came out as a total success. I'm not much of a pumpkin fan, yet I can't wait to make this again!

Quick & easy!  I only used 1/2 of a chipotle pepper and 1 teaspoon of Splenda; we like a mild heat and a sweet taste.  Goes great as a main meal or a perfect side dish either hot or cold.

I was so excited to make this dish because I love everything pumpkin. Well, evidently not everything. I followed the recipe exactly, but my husband nor I cared for the flavor of this dish. I don't know whether it was the peppers in the adobo sauce or the coriander (neither of which I had had before) or the combination of spices. But obviously, we are in the minority since most of the ratings are very good.

I used heavy cream instead of milk and shallots instead of onions - gave it a richer flavor.  I served it over spaghetti squash.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Delish!  Made it exactly as written.  Very simple, very good!  You could add chicken or shrimp to it, but not necessary.  I think a little brown sugar would make it even better.

This was OK -- admittedly I probably overdid with the chipotle since I added chicken marinated in chipotle with adobo. I might have enjoyed the flavor with less spice, may try again.

This is a little strange of a combination, I'll admit, but it works.  Very well!!!

I have made this many times and it has a great "heat" followed by a sweetness to it.  I used canned chipotles and take the seeds out so it's not too hot.  I didn't have the sage this last time and it still came out great.  This is a recipe that you should really try at least once with pasta.  It could always be added to a lasagna type dish as well and I think next time I'm going to add petite peas.

I tried this recipe twice- first as is and second with the addition of mushrooms and chopped kale.  I definitely preferred the second version.  It was pretty spicy, but as long as you are a fan of heat, you will be ok.  I liked that it is a fairly healthy recipe, so I will be making it again.

I absolutely loved this, and I really wouldn't change a thing. I would advise that people be careful with the chipotle peppers if they are sensitive to spicy foods. This is definitely for people who are adventurous when it comes to new flavor combos. I love trying new things so I really enjoyed it; my fiance, however, wasn't as impressed and found it "too weird." Thanks for sharing this one, I will be making it again!

This was terrific! So easy and so tasty and something different from a regular tomato-based sauce.  A keeper for sure. I served this with  stuffed shells iv and they went great together. What a novel idea to use pumpkin purée and such great results!

Loved this recipe.  Made it exactly as instructed.  This is an excellent, creamy satisfying sauce that keeps the calorie count low.  Delicious over both pasta and chicken

Delicious ! Wonderful Autumn dish! I will make it again. A little on the spicy side. Next time I will add less peppers. I also added more onion to give it more flavor. My husband had two servings!

This was pretty good with a little bit of tweeking! I would use less onion next time for my taste, and more garlic. Also, I used another pinch or so of the nutmeg, and I didn't have the peppers so I used smoked chipotle pepper seasoning. I didn't have sage or coriander so I used italian seasoning. I also added about 1/3 cup blend of parmesan and romano cheese and some freshly ground pepper. I also toasted some slivered almonds I had on hand in a touch of butter and LIGHTLY salted them and topped the pasta with it! Yum! Great with garlic bread. My picky husband even liked it!

I made it , the recipe does not say whether the chipotles are to be added to the mix with the sauce in the can. I added the whole can (I made 7 cups of pumpkin) including the sauce in the can. Would love for someone to write me back with the answer to my question: is the sauce in the can of chipotles included in your recipe? It is delicious but a little hot. Will make a fabulous sauce for white meats!

Smooth and creamy and delish.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except omitting the peppers because we don't like hot food.  I added some mushrooms and red peppers.  i added some sour cream as somebody else suggested - not sure that made any difference.  Poured it over spinach ravioli.  Wonderful and easy.

I'm a huge pumpkin anything fan so I was all about trying this sauce over pasta with grilled sliced chicken chipotle sausage sliced on top, but my boyfriend not so much.  In the end we both really enjoyed this and although we didn't find it too spicy it did over power the sage and sweet spices for us.

I used coconut milk instead of reg. Milk.  Used 1 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil are the only changes I made.  Served over spaghetti squash, crumbled bacon, and black olives.  It was very delicious!!!

We thought this was great! I did reduce the chipotle slightly. My daughter loved it in particular. We struggle getting her to eat vegetables so I am very pleased.

This was good. Not as great as I was hoping, so I probably won't make again. But it is a nice change from regular pasta sauce and with a little doctoring could probably be fantastic to my tastes, but not sure if I'll use my precious fresh pumpkin puree on experimenting. Thanks for the share though!

this is super easy, all stuff I have on hand, and scrumptious!  it's a little spicy for a person who usually only adds a shake of black pepper to things, but mmmm mmmm!!  it's all i can do to not go eat the rest!

I liked the sauce but I served it over spaghetti squash and was disappointed.  Might be better over regular pasta or rice.

Doubled everything except the chili peppers in adobo sauce.  This made it the perfect heat for us, plus I could use up a whole can of broth and a whole can of pumpkin puree.  The first night I served it over angel hair.  Then I used the leftover sauce combined with parboiled macaroni and shredded Monterey Jack cheese to make a riff on Pumpkin Mac N Cheese (told the kids it was Fall Mac N Cheese so they wouldn't know there was pumpkin in it).  Baked the Mac N Cheese for 25 minutes at 350 and then covered the top with French Fried Onions and baked for an additional 5 minutes.  Yum!

Very tasty, though next time I might dial down the chipotle by half, just to see what I think.  Otherwise, delish!  On a whim at the last minute, I tossed a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach into the cooking water of the whole wheat rotini when they were almost al dente (need those greens!), then drained them together and tossed with the sauce.  So good, especially when topped with a sprinke of pepitas!!  A Meatless Monday special that I will now make any day of the week.

This is the best meal we've had in a long time.  The sauce is awesome!!  I love the blend of pumpkin and chipotle peppers.  I followed the recipe exactly, and thought the chipotle flavor was just right.  I served this over penne paste, and garnished it with Parmesan cheese.  We had grilled chicken breasts on the side.  I'm very glad I have lots of pumpkin in the freezer - I'll be making this quite often.!

I turned down the heat on this for my little one, but it allowed everyone to add the desired amount of heat and they gobbled it up! This is a new Fall favorite! Even my pickiest eater liked it! Thanks for the share.

Very good sauce.  I served it with egg noodles.  It has a nice smoky flavor that goes well with the pumpkin, though I have to agree with others that it's pretty spicy as written! I like that, but if there's any doubt about heat tolerance, I'd cut the pepper amount in half if not more.

We really liked this, it was very tasty and also had a really unique flavor.  We made as directed except like many others we cut down to 1 chili pepper.  That heat level was perfect for us.

delicious, but too spicy, so will cut down on the chipotle next time. made it into a pumpkin bolognese (cooked ground beef, added white wine and cooked it off, then added the ingredients (double the onion, garlic, and salt)). used spaghetti squash instead of pasta, super healthy, and tasty!

Two chipotle pepper was far too spicy for us. The first time I made it I couldn't find those so I used a pinch of cayenne and some smoked chili powder and it was perfect that way. Other than that I like this recipe.

This was good but I think it lacked something to give it the "wow" I've experienced with other pumpkin or squash pasta sauces.  But the idea is great.  Maybe a little more garlic would help.  I will try again.
