I have been making this sauce regularly for use over pancakes or as a vanilla ice cream topping. I almost didn't make it because it didn't have many reviews but I am sure glad I gave it a try! One reviewer said it was too orangey so, since I only had regular orange juice anyway, I just substituted that for the concentrate and the result was delicious. I also have used cut-up frozen strawberries and sometimes I use half mixed berries and half strawberries.

This was simple and delicious. I used water in place of the O.J. as I did not have any and it turned out great. We used it as pancake topping. Yummy!

Had I prepared this as written I know the orange flavor would have been too prominent in this strawberry sauce.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice and the flavor was subtle and nice.  Because I used frozen strawberries and because I wanted the sauce thicker to use as a filling for coffee cake, I increased the amount of cornstarch until I had the thickness I desired, keeping in mind that it would thicken as it cooled - probably half again as much.  As I always do for strawberry sauce or pie filling, I added several drops of red food coloring to truly make it "ruby-red."

Very quick and easy but it is quite thick. The first time I made it as written and we enjoyed it. The second time I used fresh orange juice instead of concentrate and only 4 tsp. of cornstarch. This gave us just the consistency we wanted for our waffles. The flavor is only going to be as good as your strawberries!

I needed to use up some frozen strawberries from our garden and tried this sauce. It worked great. I used water instead of orange juice/concentrate just because I wanted a pure strawberry flavour. The results were great and it was super delicious on homemade mini cheesecakes! Thanks for the great recipe.

AWESOME!  Just what I was looking for!  I used orange juice as other reviewers had suggested and just because I like it, almond extract instead of vanilla.  Put it on my french toast this morning and it was to die for!  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious.   The only change I made was that I used blueberry/pomegranate  juice instead of orange juice.  This juice has become popular so it's easy to find.   Otherwise, followed the recipe and it is what I have been looking for.  I don't like plain cottage cheese so I add a little bit of this to sweeten it up a bit.  Just like what Knudsen sells.

Came out very good, and very quick and easy too, I served it on a store bought pound cake with cool whip and it made it all taste fresh and delicious. Only thing I did different was use plain orange juice instead of the concentrate because that was what I had on hand

I've made this as written, then me being me, I tried it with other kinds of juice (not concentrate), as well as other types of berries (both fresh and frozen); the recipe works great each and every time! Nothing but rave reviews each time I try a new combination. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted a juicey chunky strawberry topping for shortcakes (strawberry shortcake) and this did the trick. I haven't been happy with simply slicing fresh strawberries and sprinkling with sugar, it never makes enough liquid but this did. I only used 1/8 c. fresh orange juice which was just enough to make it bright without bringing on an orange flavor. I did not use the cornstarch. I smashed the berries lightly with a potato masher before cooking and added 3 drops of red food coloring to deepen the hue and got the results I have been searching for. Yeaaa!

Very good on pancakes and ice cream. I adjust sugar to taste whenever I make this as fresh picked berries tend to be so sweet already!

This was very easy and delicious! I've made it several times now, but made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen strawberries (2 cups) which I cut in half or quartered, based on how big they were, and about 1/8 c of fresh Meyer lemon juice (sweeter than regular lemons) instead of the OJ concentrate. I still used the sugar, cornstarch and vanilla. I did not thaw the berries, but put them in the pan frozen since they defrost while cooking on the stove. Turned out wonderful! The next time I made it, I used a combo of fresh and frozen to make more sauce----very good as well. We used it for  for Sunday brunch....waffles, strawberry sauce and whipped cream....my 12 year old says this sauce is "beast"! ; )

This was very good; I didn't have orange juice so I used water; it could have been brighter with some red food color but I didn't add any.  Taste wonderful on my cheesecake.

I used half water and half juice from an orange. This sauce was AMAZING!!!! It's good hot or cold. I used it on a cheesecake and everyone went crazy for it. My son used it on pancakes and he wanted to learn how to make it himself!!!!This is a keeper...

Delicious recipe!  This weekend we enjoyed it on pancakes, biscuits, and Kentucky Butter Cake (from this site).  It is terrific.  I used frozen strawberries and after thawing, mashed them up a bit since I didn't want whole or sliced strawberries in my sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

Used 2 cups frozen whole strawberries, half fresh squeeze orange (adding the juice makes the strawberry sauce a fruitier taste and makes a difference) 1/4 cup sugar, few drops red food coloring, and a splash of water. Mashed with a masher when berries were soft. Lots of juice and plenty of mashed strawberries to go ontop of my cheesecake.

This sauce is really good! I made it twice - once more or less as written - I used water instead of orange juice concentrate - and it turned out great.   The second time I made it I tweaked the recipe and used a mango cut into small pieces in place of some of the strawberries. I also used about 1 cup of sugar because it wasn't sweet enough with just 1/2 cup (and used water in place of the orange juice for this batch as well). We like the mango-strawberry sauce even more than the strawberry version!

I also used orange juice (made from frozen concentrate) in this. I've chilled the sauce for a couple of hours and used it on cheesecake, and I've served it warm over vanilla ice cream. It was a huge hit in both cases. Great way to use up strawberries that are starting to go.

Yummy!  I served this over homemade vanilla ice cream for our Mother's Day dessert and it was the perfect accompaniment. I used orange juice instead of concentrate. Very easy and quick to make.  Thank you sharing this recipe!

I needed a fruit sauce for my cheesecake I made for Thanksgiving, and I hate the canned stuff. I couldn't remember how all to make the sauce, so this worked great. I used about 3- 3 1/2 cups mixed frozen berries as it's all I had. Everything else remained the same.

I was looking for something other than a muffin to use up a bunch of strawberries I bought on impulse. I halved the recipe and it was good, but the orange flavor was just a bit overpowering. I will probably use juice rather than concentrate if I make this again. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Really delicious! I substituted orange JUICE for the concentrate and it was wondeful. I served on top of Chantal's Cheesecake from this site.

I thought this was very good. I used regular orange juice and added red food coloring to zap up the color. Beautiful. Regular orange juice isn't too overpowering. I used fresh strawberries and also frozen and both worked just fine. I definitely will make this again.

Absolutely luscious recipe.  I used water in place of oj & frozen strawberries instead of fresh.  These substitutions were made as I was out of the required ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!

I just juiced 1 orange instead of using concentrate.  Very good over pancakes for breakfast and then the leftovers over ice cream later that day.

This sauce was excellent and easy to prepare. After reading several reviews, I used OJ instead of the concentrate. I made it to pour over pancakes and the sauce was a major hit with my son and husband.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I used orange juice rather than the concentrate and frozen, whole berries.  This came out just as I was hoping and was perfect on Chantel's cheesecake.  I plan to use on waffles also.  It was quick and easy.

use water instead of orange juice 1 pt of strawberries is about 3 cups sliced. bring to a boil over medium heat. boil 1 minute. maybe only 2 cups for mini-cheesecake topping. try half sugar?

It was obvious by the consistency that there was cornstarch in it, but it was still very good.
