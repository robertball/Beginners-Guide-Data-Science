I followed the recipe exactly and they are phenomenal. Only 5 WW freestyle points per muffin. Very satisfying. Thanks! I definitely will be making these as a staple. ??

These muffins are moist and delicious.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  This was my first time baking with wheat flour and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it came out.  Will definitely make again.
