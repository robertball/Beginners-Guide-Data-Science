I wasn't sure what to expect when I made this. Considering there were no reviews, one low rating, and no photo I really wanted to give this drink a try. I prefer champagne as my drink of choice anyways. Scaling this down to two servings, I used pink lemonade which I highly recommend for better flavor as well as the pretty pink color that will appeal to your guests. It turns a frothy pink once the ice cream melts into it. I used a good quality cream vanilla ice cream and I look forward to serving this to my friends in the near future. Very creamy, smooth, and tasty!

Made this as a New Years Eve drink and it was a big hit. I also used pink lemonade instead of regular and it was a very pretty.
