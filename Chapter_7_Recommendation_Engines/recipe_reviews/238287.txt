My family and I loved this recipe. I couldn't find the Buitoni afredo sauce at any of the stores near me so I used a jar of alfredo sauce instead. My family and I decided to use Buitoni's three cheese tortellini instead of the spinach and cheese ones.
We will definitively be making this again

Cook the bacon crisp. In a separate pan add olive oil and a lil butter, toss in the chopped onion and mushrooms. Add the Alfredo sauce let it simmer. Add the drained tortellini, the chopped bacon and peas last. It is ready when peas are cooked.

Not much flavor, even with bacon. Ok, but not great.

Great quick meal. I have used real bacon pieces when bacon wasn't available.  I also made it with  ravioli. Easy recipe to tweak to your taste.

I added sundried tomatoes and a bit of basil and it was the PERFECT touch
