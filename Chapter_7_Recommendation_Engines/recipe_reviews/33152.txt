I am a Spaniard that has been living in the States for 6 and a half years. I have made tortilla espanola many times and for many people, and never with the amounts indicated in this recipe.If you want to make this delicious dish, you will have to almost fill a frying pan with oil and boil the potatoes while you work them with a wooden spoon. Three tablespoon won't do anything for you

In Spain we don't usually add chorizo or black pepper, but I'm sure it will please many a palate all over the world.  Authentic Serving Suggestion: Once the tortilla is cooled to room temperature cut it into 1 inch squares and let guests spear them with toothpicks. Ol√©

This was the first time I cooked tortilla espanola. It did not come very close to what I've seen and eaten in Spain, but I think that was my error and I plan on trying again. It certainly was good, if not gourmet. When I do try this again I will:
1. Make sure the potatoes don't stick to the pan when I brown them. Otherwise, they will spoil the "flip" process.
2. Try boiling the potatoes a bit first to speed the process.

As other reviewer said, when you're frying the potatoes it is very important to make sure that they're partially covered with oil, it is a must!!! This is an essential part of the process, if you want a moist and tender tortilla (as it is supposed to be). Don't worry if your potatoes go a little bit mushy and stick together, in the end you're gonna mix them with eggs and fry the whole thing.... I can assure you will not notice if the potatoes were stuck or not before. The amount of eggs depends on their size, you have to add enough eggs (liquids) to dip the potatoes (sometimes, when i'm out of eggs, and don't have enough of them to cover the potatoes, i add a dash of milk and it turns out even moister). By the way, it tastes really good if you make it just from potatoes, onions and green pepper!!! It is worth a try!!

I give this recipe 4 points because I think it's using too much potatoes. I love the idea of frying the potatoes more than boiling. Don't think you have to deepfrying them. Use enough oil to make them look shiny in the pan. Use mid to hing temperature and lower it when potatoes are golden. Add amounts of onions, and fry till they look clear and starting to burn a little. They should be crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Lower your temperature when pouring the eggs. A burned tortilla doesn't have a good flavor. Never over cook it. Let it slowly love the pan and remove it right before it's completely done. The warmness remaining will do the trick of a cooked but still tender tortilla. ENJOY!!!

This is a decent start, but ... no. This is sort of a pale imitation. Mark Bittman of the new york times has a great version on his blog, Bitten - check that out. But a tip for the potatoes would be to slice them thin, not cube them - they'll cook much more evenly and lend themselves much better to the dish, settling in a horizontal pattern in the dish. And yes - more olive oil is certainly needed.

An authentic tortilla recipe, with one exception. Tortilla espanola as it would be in Madrid is only made with potato and onion. I was glad to find this recipe true to form, having lived in Spain 3 months. Thanks Ryan.

I used Ole Ida's cubed hashbrowns O'Brian style (seasoned with red and green bell peppers and onions).  This was much faster and great tasting! Added shredded cheese.  FABULOUS!  This is now one of my favorite recipes.  At first I thought that the potatoes were a little weird, but they really balance the flavor of the spicy chorizo.  This is a great way to impress people with your broad scope of Mexican cuisine.  It's like thinking outside the box!

I haven't made the recipe but I have a helpful shortcut for the potatoes. If you don't want to fry them in a bunch of oil, you can prebake them till they're softened but still some what firm. Then fry them in less oil.

This is a great recipe. Very easy and fast and pleasing to the eye, too (my kids thought it looked like pizza)! My husband loved it!

This was quite nice though a little bland.  I cooked the potatoes and onions in a cast iron pan then added the rest of the ingredients and transferred to the oven to finish - this worked really well.

Its heart is in the right place, and had a lot of potential. However, the proportions are completely off. Even after doubling the oil and halving the potatoes and sausage, there was no way it was going to go together correctly. 

Made for a nice plate of sausage and potatoes with a side of scrambled eggs, though

By making some slight changes this can turn out to be a great recipe. I used 6 eggs instead of 5 and 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of 3 tablespoons. Also I separated the sausage from the onions and potatoes and strained the latter before mixing them with the eggs and sausage. It turned out delicious.

This turned out to be quite flavorful, but I wasn't able to prepare it the way the instructions said.  I thought that the amounts seemed a little off: 4 potatoes and one onion seemed like a lot for 5 eggs.  It was certainly too much for my nonstick pans.  So, once I cooked the potatoes and onions and combined them with the eggs, I put it in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes.  It turned out really good!  I will probably use only 1/2 an onion the next time I make this, but that may be more of a personal preference.

I don't eat chorizo but my husband said it was good.  In our house things are just OK or they are a keeper and he said this was a keeper.
