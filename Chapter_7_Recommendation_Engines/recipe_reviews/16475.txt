Fantastic!  What a really nice twist to green beans.  I did make modifications to the recipe.  I used 2 bags of frozen green beans becuase I like the taste better than canned.  Also, I added 1 samll minced onion to the sour cream paste.  I also added bacon to the green beans... and salt!  I used fried onions to top it.  Make sure that you get a good swiss cheese so that you can taste the flavor.  It was a little soggy the next day but the flavor was even better!

I've made this recipe for over twenty years with a few changes. I use frozen, french cut grean beans cooked al dente, and add 3 Tbls. sauteed, minced onion and 1/2 to 1 lb. cooked, broken bacon pieces into casserole. I've never tried the cornflake crust; I'll try it this Thanksgiving! (*Once you take this to a dinner, you'll be expected to bring it every time!) YUMMY :-)'

First, let me say that the end result of this recipe was very good. My husband loved it. The preparation was a little strange, though. The "paste" mixture was very thick, and the melted cheese made it even thicker. I tasted this mixture before adding the green beans and thought it was a little bland, so I fried some bacon very crisp and crumbled this in with the green beans. This seemed to spice it up a little. Like I said, the final dish was good, although VERY different from your traditional green bean casserole.

I really didn't care for it and neither did my fiance. It was so rich with sour cream, swiss cheese and tons of butter (let me say that again, too much butter). We thought it was too heavy. I won't be making this again. If I could give this no stars at all I would do it.

This has been our family favorite for over 30 years. Melt the butter in a saucepan and add in flour, 2 tsp.salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. instant minced onion and 2 tsp. sugar. I use cut green beans, not the stringy french. I don't melt the Swiss cheese into the green bean mixture but layer it on top. Spread this in a 9x13 pan. For the topping I only use 1 cup of cornflake crumbs with 1/2 cup butter. Just sprinkle over the top for a light coating.

Interesting twist on a holiday standard.  I'd opt for a little less sour cream though, as it was almost too tangy.

It was wonderful!! I don't like plain green beans.  This makes the beans taste wonderful.  I used the French Onions on the top.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Many people left it on their plate. It has a mushy consistancy in spite of the cornflake topping. I used swiss cheese and even used more than the recipe called for and it was still bland tasting.

This really is different in a good way. I serve this on special occasions. Be sure not to over brown the butter or it will burn and ruin the whole thing. Serve piping hot, if it gets to cool the swiss will have the yuck factor...like when chicken cordon bleu gets cold.

I agree that it's a little bland, as is.  I add a package of onion soup mix to my sour cream.  I cut the sour cream a little and increased the swiss cheese.  I also use french onions instead of the cornflakes.

This is a show stopper!  I sprinkle a little bacon on top under the corn flakes but it didn't need it.  I got rave reviews and it is a nice change from the cream of mushroom variety.  LOVED IT and I got raves a Christmas for it!!!!

Hi, this recipe is fantastic! I found it a few years ago and we now use it every Holiday! My kids look at a "regular" green been casserole and say YUCK! Mom that is NOT Tim's green bean casserole. So, Tim who ever you are thanks!

This was a huge hit with my family. I've made it for Thanksgiving for two years now and it has replaced the traditional green bean casserole.  I did add some crumbled bacon and finely chopped onion as suggested in some other reviews and replaced the cornflakes with french fried onions.  It's also very good with frozen green beans rather than canned.

I thought this was pretty good, VERY RICH.. My husband didn't like it .. Too rich for him.  I think just adding extra green beans would have helped.

I carefully read all the reviews before making this dish and added onions, mushrooms and bacon to the paste. I also used fried onions instead of the cornflakes. It turned out great and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used frozen green beans and did not have enough (I don't use canned veggies) The flavor of the sour cream was a little overwhelming but I think that was my fault due to the shortage of green beans. Everyone seemed to like them tho. Next time I'll do it right!

After reading the other reviews, I automatically cut the s. cream by half (using only 1 c.).  I also added chopped bacon and onion powder for a little more flavor.  An additional can of green beans to make it go a little farther.  Thinned the sauce slightly w/ a little milk and then added the cheese.  It was very good and such a nice change from the "usual" green bean dish.  Topped it off w/ the french fried onions instead of the topping as in the recipe.

Some loved it, some did not. It was VERY rich, and a little too thick. Next time, I will replace 1 C of the sour cream with milk. I also used frozen green beans as I like the texture better than canned.

I have made this for the last 4-5 years...i always offer to bring something different and always get the same answer "no way, we want your green bean casserole".  I do use the fried onions on the top instead of the cornflakes.  I also use light sour-cream and reduced fat cheese....and it tastes great!

Everyone loved this alternative to the "traditional" green bean casserole.  I did make a small change to the topping since I didn't have any cornflakes.  I used 1 cup of french fried onions then topped that with a cup of crushed buttery crackers in 3 T of melted butter.  I will definitely make this again.

Love it!  Frozen Green beans work well as long as they are not the French style variety.

Served this at Thanksgiving this year and it went over very well.  Substituted french-fried onions on the top since I was already making potatoes with a cornflake topping on it.  Thanks for sharing this!

I tried this recipe 4 years ago for the first time and have made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas since!  This is a wonderful green bean casserole especially if you do not like the traditional casserole.  The only thing I do different is to add salt and pepper to the mix. I always make a double batch for my HUGE family and never have any leftovers.

I was tasked with the green bean casserole for the Christmas dinner but knew we had guests who hated mushrooms etc. so I decided on this. After reading other reviews I decided on changing it a bit. I wanted to fill my 2 1/2 quart pan so I did the following: I used 3 14 oz packages of frozen beans, barely cooked (french cut next time?). I added 1/2 lb of crumbled bacon. Half a can of french fried onions. A little more cheese and sour cream. Sweated half an onion in the butter (a little more butter too). It filled the pan perfectly. The flavor was very good and the texture was perfect!

I did not have sour cream so I subbed plain nonfat yogurt for it, so maybe that's why I thought it was ok but not THE BEST. The best alternative green bean casserole, I think is still Grandma's Green Bean casserole found on this website. I will maybe try this again w/ the SC and I will say it is VERY easy to make.

I LOVE this recipe!  I am asked to make this dish for every Thanksgiving and Easter.  My husband and girlfriend do not like green bean casserole but love this dish.  The only change I make is to the topping.  I prefer the traditional onion topping.  I have also made this in the crock pot and it turns out fine also, just make sure you keep stirring it.  Some review says it too rich.  It is rich but being used as a side dish, its great.

Sounds just like what we have every holiday however we used french onion dip instead of sour cream, we top the casserole with the swiss cheese then add the cornflakes. We also add about 1/4 cup sugar, about 2 tbsp salt and 1 tbsp pepper to the thick creamy sauce before we add the green beans.

This recipe was delicious!  I was looking for something different to serve for the holidays.  Everyone loved it!  I did substitute 'mexican cheese' for the swiss as my family does not like swiss chheese.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

I didn't know how this would turn out, but I tried it anyway for Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit. Not one bite left! I did substitute Ritz crackers for the cornflakes and next time will add the can fried onions on top. But overall, this is a great tasting dish!

This is obvisously a VERY heavy recipe.  Don't make it if you are looking for something light.  I made a few changes and I thought it was really good!  I used 1lb fresh green beans, added some garlic,  used 7oz of Brie and instead of corn flakes I used a box of Blue Diamond Almond Nut Thin crackers.  The almond flour crackers were a really nice mix w/the casserole.  I'll be making it again for sure.

I made this for Christmas, and my only complaint is that I used fresh rather than canned greenbeans, and the sweetness didn't blend well with the rest of the ingredients. Will definitely make again....

I had higher hopes for this than it delivered. I should have known it might be on the bland side without any spice. The sour cream/cheese mixture came out almost rubbery. I may try the recipe again, but with some modifications.

A very nice change from the traditional green bean casserole.  I made this for a pre-Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  I added some bacon and used the french-fried onion rings.  I also cut back on the sour cream.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Remarkably unremarkable. Flavorless. I think that the ingredients are a good start but this recipe is not finished.  When making the sour-cream/butter/flour/cheese paste, taste it because THAT will be the over-all flavor of the dish and then build on it from there.

This recipe is a fantastic idea and a welcome change from traditional green bean casserole.  I would give it five stars, but as the recipe was, it was a little flavorless for me, so like a lot of reviewers, I added bacon and also added a little (about 2 tbsp.) feta cheese.  That seemed to take care of the blandness.  I also used twice the amount of butter that was called for in order to completely moisten the corn flake crumbs.  I'll be making this again and often.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very rich but good. My guest liked it more than I did. I did dv8 from the recipe a bit. I used sharpe cheddar instead of swiss.  I will probably make this again but I think I will cut back on the sour cream & cheese a bit.

This casserole was ok.  I think that it would have been much better if mushrooms were included.  I had a difficult time getting the consistancy right as it became quite doughy after adding the cheese but the addition of a little liquid helped thin it out enough to incoporate the beans.

Since Thanksgiving of last year, I've already made this recipe 6 times! My family can't get enough of it and request it every holiday - so much I have to make two pans of it!

I did not have to tweak any of the recipe. If you follow it correctly, no one will have to [unless it's to add your own touch].

Everyone loved it and asked for the reipce. Could   
not find pre-shredded swiss cheese so I used              monterey jack/cheddar instead. Plan on cutting
it by half next time though...makes a lot!

I have used this recipe for the last 3 years.. I love it and so does my family and friends. The only thing I did different was I had frosted corn flakes and it was great.. I tried regular corn flakes but we like frosted flakes better. Thanks for a great recipe.

This has been a family favorite since the 1960's and we'll be having it again tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  Since i lost my mom, I thought I lost the recipe as well.  Glad to find it again.

Just like what my mom always made when I was growing up.  I don't like to crush the corn flakes... they stay crispier that way.

For green bean casserole,which usually is not very popular because of it's consistency, this recipe was actually quite surprising and appatizing!I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and   my family members who had never liked green bean casserole had seconds and thirds.Can't wait to make more!

This didn't win any points with my family at all.  I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was met with lukewarm reviews at best.  It is very "sour creamy" and has a really strong taste.  Some people might like that, but it wasn't our taste at all.

This was a hit at our gathering.  Everyone loved it and asked for more!  I love the variation from the traditional cream of mushroom soup mixture.  I was worried it would be to different but it wasn't at all and it was unbelievably flavorful.  I did substitute the cornflakes with french fried onions and it was delicious! Try this recipe!

This has taken the place previously reserved for the Campbell's green bean casserole at every holiday dinner since I first made it. Everybody raves about it. I do substitute the fried onions for the cornflakes, though.

Absolutely the BEST green bean casserole in the world!!  Fixed it Tgiving for 10 people and I couldn't believe the response.  I did make a few changes, 5 cans of whole green beans, 1 sweet onion sauteed in butter and garlic, l T sugar and Ritz crackers on top.  It was fantastic!

What a tasty change from the standard, traditional Green Bean Casserole.  Although I give it an overall 5 stars, a dish such as this is not that 'Kid Friendly' due to the texture, kids lean toward foods that are plain, and more easily eaten with their hands, as opposed to a casserole dish.

I've made this for every Thanksgiving and Christmas since I found the recipe 5 years ago.   The only change I made was to use the fried onions for the topping.  One year I accidentally doubled the cheese, and it came out even better, though less healthy.

This is a family fav! I make this every year for Thanksgiving and it is a hit. I add pepper for flavor and sub French's fried onions for the corn flakes as well to add flavor. It is now requested every year and the leftovers are delicious too. Super easy to make and a great spin on traditional green bean casserole.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving with my BF (three years ago). His cousin showed up and ate it all. I made another one the next day for the big family dinner. The same cousin met me at the car and took the casserole home! Everyone thought I showed up empty-handed! The last two years I made it with fresh green beans from my garden. YUM!

I substituted a lot - more flour, milk for sour cream, Fromental for Swiss, frozen beans for canned, and no butter on the cornflakes... delicious, still!

A different twist to beans that I looked forward to.  A bit too much sour cream and not enough taste, though.

I grew up with this version. My mother used to make it every Thanksgiving, so I am very happy have found this recipe and to be able to make it msself. It has always been my favorite Thanksgiving dish.

This recipte tasted like it needed something.  There was no mention of any spices or salt, so I did not put any.  In addition
does not seem healthy with all the cheese and butter.  I DID like the cornflake topping however, and will probably use that as an alternative to other recipes.

I add an additional can of green beans (total of five) in order to get the right consistency as well as substitute the fried onions for cornflakes.  My family loves this recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe and was intrigued by the ingredients but it just wasn't that good.  Too sour, too soupy...sorry!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!
This is the best ever green bean casserole.  I made it for my BUNKO group and everyone was screaming for the recipe.  Rich, creamy and wonderfully delicious.
Thanks for sharing.

My family will not eat swiss cheese, so I used the Mexican Blend cheese.  There was so much grease from the butter and cheese that I used paper towels to soak it up after the mixture was combined. I also used petite, whole frozen green beans. I should have followed other reviewers' suggestion to pre-cook the frozen green beans before adding to the mixture because that may be why the fat separated.  As the beans thawed they made the mixture wet and had to cook on the stove top to reduce.  But I was glad to remove the excess oil.  It wasn't too popular and I had another batch already prepared for the following day's big gathering.  I doctored it with cream of mushroom soup and topped with french fried onions and everyone loved it.  I guess it was more traditional tasting by then.

Unfortunately this recipe had absolutely no flavor.  Next time I will stick with the original recipe.
