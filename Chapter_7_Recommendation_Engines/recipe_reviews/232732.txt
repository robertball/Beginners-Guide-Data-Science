Very quick and easy recipe to help use up some of the zillion mulberrys from my back yard! This is a little thin, even after being in fridge, but perfect for us as we like to add on ice cream or pancakes. I never boil jars to seal them for any of my canning. I simply put the hot lids on jars (the jars I have already individually warmed up by running under hot water) twist the lids on and done. They always seal nicely and have long shelf life. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. I used raspberry jello instead of strawberry and it was a good complement to the mulberries. I added extra pectin but it still came out a little too runny for my liking. Next time I would try doubling the amount of pectin.

I have made this recipe twice now and it has turned out perfect both times. My first ever attempts at canning. My family loved the flavor!

I made recipe 1st time last year. I followed recipe to the T.   It was delicious, but too loose /watery.  I looked at other berry recipes and noticed most only use 1/2  cup of water, so I tried same recipe but cut water to only 1/2 cup. Came out perfectly! I will continue to use recipe with decreased water! I also used Rasberry jello,...love the taste with the Rasberry vs strawberry.

The recipe was very easy and the preserves came out great!  I used the tip at the bottom and blended the mixture since my kids don't like chunks!  As stated in the recipe, at room temperature it seems thin, but it firms up nicely once in the fridge!  I will definitely be trying some of the other combinations mentioned at the bottom of the recipe!

The taste is good, but not sweet.  I found it to be a bit too thin.  Maybe adding less water or more pectin could make it better.  I pureed the berries after boiling them but still had many stems in the jelly.  I am not sure how to get those little stems out.  Overall, was fairly easy to make but a tad messy.

I reduced water by 1/2 and this was still runny...did not set. It tastes good, but didn’t turn out as jam (for me). Also, made (5) 1/2 pints, not 6. I don’t know if I did something wrong!!

I loved it but I tweaked it.  I did a double batch I added the strawberry jello with the sugar and pectin and it was to strawberry. So added a little Allspice and vanilla and it calmed that down.  So I still had to add more of the sugar and pectin and I used Berry Blue jello with a little more vanilla and Allspice and it has a perfect berry taste.

Turned out perfectly!  I read the comments ahead of time and decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups and then increased the sugar to 1 cup.  It was not runny and was perfectly sweet.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed the recipe except only used 1 cup of water. The preserves thickened nicely!

This is my first time making mulberry jam so was excited to find such an easy recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as printed but only got 4 half pint jars out of it?  Will need to figure that one out.  Very tasty though.

No changes to the recipe.  It was very easy to make and really enjoyed it on some biscuits.  I only got 7 half pints instead of the 8 listed on the recipe.
