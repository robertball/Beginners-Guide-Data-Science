I have noticed that many people have complained about the dryness of the meat. Im russian and I have made countless piroshkis in my lifetime and would have to say this recipe is almost spot (for the dough that is). I wouldn't cook the ground beef and actually I would use half ground pork half ground beef and add about 1/4 cup of water to the meat mixture, the more onions and garlic and other seasonings you add the tastier it will be so don't skimp on that and please please don't use dried ingredients that takes away the authenticity of this awesome dish. There is absolutely no reason to cook the meat before you fry or bake them.

THank YOU!!! I have been trying for several years to duplicate the delicious piroshki recipe my late Grandmother, born and raised in Russia, used to make us as children. The night we made these my brother walked in and grabbed one.  "THESE ARE THEM, THESE ARE THEM!!"  It was a great acheivment after so many failed attempts that never even came close.  I made so many batches night after night this holiday I think my family and friends finally had enough piroshi till next Christmas.  My Mother reminded me that my Grandmother also used to make them with cabbage and hard boiled eggs.  We did'nt do the eggs but we did have some with cabbage that were good.  We also thought of using the dough but adding spaghetti sauce, peperoni and chese for an Italian version.  (Sorry Grandma) Anyway if I never use another recipe again I will treasure this one.

I didn't fry these, but baked them at 400 for 17-18 minutes.  I think I made them bigger than recipe stated, but they were very filling and the kids seemed to like them.  Only negative comment was that it was a little "plain", even with cheese added to it.  I LOVED them. Thank you.

EUREKA! This recipe does taste like the piroshkis I remember eating in my childhood when I would be treated to piroshkis at my friend's russian grandmother's house. They were always fondly remembered but never duplicated until now. Mine turned out a little dry, perhaps I drained the meat too well? I'm looking at other web sites now for similar recipes, and one says a russian chef told her that dryness is a problem, the chef adds bits of suet in the meat or chopped up frozen beef stock. Another recipe adds beef stock and butter to the meat to make it wetter. Some recipes add chopped up hard boiled eggs. I notice reviewers here added cheese. I cut mine open and added some cheese and it tasted good. Roll your dough thin, thinner is better, it puffs up thicker  when  you fry it.

This recipe is best using the time-honored tradition of using roasted beef and then grinding it in a hand-cranked meat grinder. Totally old-fashioned, yes, but it yields unmatched richness. (Ground meat lends a much harsher and hollow flavor) (Trust me, I've eaten these for 40+ years). Ironically, though, if you want to cut time on making the dough- frozen Bridgefield bread loaves, thawed and rolled out, yields virtually the same taste as far as the bread is concerned.

I'm making 25 bag lunches for fishermen who will be out on a lake with no cooking facilities on Saturday. I decided to enclose the Easy Ham and Cheese sandwiches, using this Piroshki dough. Talk about excellent! The dough was pliable and soft enough to enclose the ham, cheese and sauce. It should be less messy for the guys than a regular sandwich. Thanks Taylor's mommy! I'll come back another day and make the filling that goes with this Piroshki.

Overall I give it a five this was delicious I add some mushrooms bacon bits with some cheese but it was great either way.
Quickness I rated five because I alway prepare my indgredints before I make it by two hours so I just through it together
eainess a five also because it goes in hand with Quckness.
Kid friendly a five for obvious reasons
Thankyou for giving us the recipe, I've never made these before, Im very impressed!!!!

They just didn't taste like I remember a piroshki tasting. I'll have another go at them and see what happens.

This recipe was right on. It tasted just like the piroshkis we bought at the neighborhood deli when we were kids. We added fresh minced garlic, cheese, onions, mushrooms, and fresh spinach with the ground beef and they were amazing. They were also very fun to make. This recipe is superb.

I use 1/2 this recipe for my 3-person family.  I use 1 1/2 Tbs of dried dill for an authentic fair-type taste.  I also add a 1 1/2 oz cube of cheddar cheese before sealing and frying.  My 2-year old and husband love these!  They're a great make-ahead for a picnic (no messy sandwiches) and easy to reheat in the oven (425 for 10 minnutes or so)!

This is a variation of  Belyashi or Meat Piroshki. Piroshki can have many different fillings, including mashed potatoes with or without ground liver, cabbage, egg onion and rice, also small amounts of jam can be used for the filling for a sweet pirozhok. There are many variations on the fillings, I've only listed a few common ones. Each Russian family makes it their way, so you can get a lot of variation on what goes into these.
I gave this recipe 5 stars because truly authentic Meat Piroshki are never baked because the dough becomes sweet, its perfectly fine to bake them with the other fillings. And if you prefer to bake them that's fine but it doesn't taste the same.

This was great!  I remember making these when I went to Russia but I couldn't remember the recipe.  But I recently needed to make a Russian dish for a big, multicultural pot luck.  I remember liking these a lot, so I thought I'd try it out.
     They all disappeared in the first few minutes!  My family was sad that I didn't leave very many for them and asked me to make more!
     I did change a couple things though:
  I took others' advice about the moisture and added 1/2 cup of beef stock to the meat mixture right before wrapping it in the dough.  It turned out great that way!  Not too wet.  The stock just rehydrated the well-cooked meat. 
  I also added a clove of minced garlic.  I know that's not authentic, but it gave it all a really good flavor, and actually brought out the dillweed in my opinion.
  Also, I needed to add about another cup of flour to the dough to make it not stick to the bowl.
  Finally, make sure you don't have your heat for the oil on too high.  I made that mistake and the first couple came out doughy in the middle.

Then just serve with sour cream (the Russian condiment, it seems)!

Right now I have some more dough rising!  Only this time I'm putting mashed potatoes in.  You could try it with cabbage too!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! For a truly authentic Russian taste add DILL. When you think you have added enough dill....add some more. I also added minced garlic as well and about 1/2 cup beef broth in the meat while I cooked it. Perfect result!

I have never tried to make anything like this before, but I will definitely be making this over and over!  It was a huge hit with my hubby and even my picky nephews!  It does take a little time to make, but it's so simple and absolutely worth the extra time.  I'm not usually a big fan of dill, but it was a perfect compliment to this recipe!  I fried some and baked some (brushed the baked ones with a little melted butter after baking) and they were terrific both ways! It makes a really big batch so we still have a lot in the freezer, but I'm sure they won't last long!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved these and so did my guests!  I took the suggestion to add a little stock.  I added veggie stock because it was what I had on hand.  I just added it right in the meat while the onions were cooking- about half a box.  I just let it cook into the meat so it was really juicy. I also used fresh dill, not dried. I also used Rhodes dinner rolls instead of making the dough because I was on a time crunch.  They worked perfectly!  The Piroshki were juicy, so flavorful and a huge hit!

This recipe is great! 
But what my Baba used to do is...
Melt 1 cup butter, 2 Tbsp dill weed and 4 cloves garlic in a bowl (Microwave). 
and instead of deep frying, you bake them for 12 minutes with the buttery mixture lightly ontop. 
And when they come out, coat them again or use the butter/garlic as a dipping sauce! 
They taste amazing!
(She also made them quite smaller too)

VERY good! Similar to the piroshki's I had growing up.  I did use more dill, about 1-11/2 tsp.  Also used 1/2 c beef stock to moisten the meat up when it was ready to fill the dough.  I also added sharp cheddar cheese.

As for using 2 disks of dough, I ended up using one disk and folding it in half and pinching it closed.  I wanted a little less dough, and more meat.  It was very good! 

THANK YOU for sharing!

Added some minced garlic and baked them instead of frying, but WOW!  These were well received by everyone at the dinner party.  Already have requests to make more.

My biggest problem with this recipe was that I had to throw away my first batch of dough (it turned into an exploding runny mess with the four cups of flour) and when I remade the dough, I wound up having to use something like seven and a half cups of flour to make it pull away from the sides. Don't get me wrong - I know that humid weather can make some difference - but it hasn't really been that humid here and doubling the flour is a lot more of a difference than I've ever had to do before! And I consider myself a pretty experienced baker.  The filling, as people suggested, erred on the side of bland. IMHO, you should season the meat as you cook it, and make sure you break it all up into small pieces! I didn't have quite enough dill, but it wouldn't have made that much of a difference, I think. Also added some fried cabbage and garlic and a boiled egg. I should have added even more cabbage for a little sweetness. Threw in some oil so the filling wouldn't be so dry, but next time I think I'd add some tomato paste.

Great. I added 2 cloves of garlic with the onions. Also, instead of rolling out each circle, I rolled out a rectangle and used a large glass to cut out 12-15 circles at once. This was a big hit with everyone. We'll make these again.

This was great!! I miss the House Of Piroshki in San Francisco now i have it at my house. This is the best recipe i have found for the doe. I went a step further and made a pastry with the left over doe by adding Rasberry jelly as the filling deep fry and sprinkle powder sugar on top. What a treat to enjoy after a great Piroshki.

Very good recipe- similar to the ones not available anymore in the market at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. I found it helpful not to overlap the edges of the dough a lot when wrapping, so the dough cooks through without over-browning them.

I put an egg white wash on top and baked them at 380 degrees for about 35-40 minutes and they came out great, except that I think they need to be thinner. The thinner the dough, the better.

These were good....I know it probably wouldn't be an authentic recipe, but I would add something to make the bread a little more tasty next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I'm a beginner cook and even I managed not to screw it up! :) These taste very similar to the piroshki I remember eating in Moscow.

My son needs to make a Russian dish for a school project, and he really liked these. I changed the recipe for the filling just a bit -- I used 1 lb. of ground beef, 1/2 lb. of mushrooms, and the onion. I also put the ground beef through the food processor after I cooked it, to make it very fine. (The ones we had in Moscow had a very finely chopped filling.) Very good! :)

Very similar to the one at Seattle Pike Place Piroshky Bakery I must say. Added two medium size onions, 2 T minced garlic, Mrs Dash about 1- 2 tsp, little dash paprika, 2 1/2 tsp dill and mixed 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese mixed them all in the meat. Meat one half cooked ground pork and half uncooked ground beef add 1/4 cup water or broth. I made open face round gallette type dough. Weight each dough 62 grams round ball and roll them thin. 
This is my version of filling
I did not alter the dough recipe at all
Baked 350 degrees on my kitchenaid convection oven for 25 mins. Turn baking sheets every 10 mins. If it browns too quickly cover with foil and remove foil in the 1- 2 mins. 
It was delish :) It is a keeper

These were Awesome! I added cooked shredded potatoes, matchstick carrots, garlic powder & beef broth. I also baked these instead of frying. Everyone loved them! The dough was amazing, I plan to use the dough for other fillings too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really like this dough. I made a cabbage stuffing instead (satueed onions cabbage and a little tomato paste, salt pepper and a little cinnamon) and baked them at 350 until they became orangey brown. were really great. next time I will make them bigger so I can put more stuffing inside. Russian flavoring is very simple, so you can really taste the main ingredient. Its very good.............(update)...just made this again (really big this time) with a meat filling half ground veal and half ground beef (about 1.6 lbs total) satueed meat and when almost done, added chopped onions and garlic, then mushrooms, salt pepper and a little tomato paste, and a little parmesan cheese. at the end when it is cooling I put in half a bunch of fresh dill and a few tablespoons of sour cream. baked them and they were really delicious. not nearly as good as on the street in moscow :( but still satisfying and tasty (especially the filling). next time i'll use cabbage again though.

This was so DELICIOUS. I've never had Piroshki before but I had to try them when I saw the cute little rolls. I didn't have any kind of cheese, except American, so I ended up adding cream cheese to the meat and it tasted great. Also, I used a sour cream, lemon, dill, and garlic sauce and it made them AWESOME!!!

AWESOME!!  Used ground elk burger instead of beef, and added 2 tbs shredded cheddar inside each piroshki, and a dash of crushed red pepper to the meat for a little heat.  Also deep fried in skillet over medium heat for maybe 30 seconds, at the most, they brown quickly.  Who would've thought dill would be so perfect in these???  They taste just like the ones at the fair.  My hubby and I were so pleased!!

This is yummy!  My Russian grandmother added hard-boiled egg, parsley, 1/4 cup dry wine, and about 1/2 cup water to hers, along with the ground beef, onions, dill, salt & pepper.  Maybe the extra liquid keeps them a little moister.  We always deep-fried them. They were to die for.

i tried frying these guys, and the dough didn't get cooked all the way through. they're in the oven right now trying to be saved. if i try this recipe next time, i'll make them smaller than golf ball sized. i would also stretch the dough over a larger helping of the hamburger filling.

You can also make these with (inside of them) : Mashed potatoes, Cabbage, Apples, Cherries, Hard boiled egg... I'm sure you can make anything you want inside of them, the sweet ones are amazing.

This recipe is fantastic!  I also bake these at 400 for about 15-20 minutes instead of frying.  I make it with ground beef, onion, cheese and sauerkraut for more of a bier rock taste.  I've also done it with chopped spinach.  I may try doing it with apple filling sometime.  This is GREAT!  Give it a try, it's really not hard to do and the leftovers are great too!  Thank you!

This was very time consuming with some disappointing results. I think partly due to the recipe and partly due to user error. The dough is good but the filling really lacked flavor and moisture. I also baked these instead of frying so maybe that made a difference. We're gonna try to make again with different filling.

My bf from St. Petersburg loved this but said the dough was a bit too sweet.  To keep it wet, I added hard boiled eggs and a little veg oil to the meat mix.  I used half ground pork and half ground beef as most Russian minced meat recipes call for.  Next time I will put only a little sugar.  Also, he said he loves them with blueberries so that's the next I will try.  Great recipe!

Very tasty recipe!  I had a little difficulty following the directions but I think it is probably because I am such a poor baker.  I do think the recipe time should be revised to fact in the time one must wait for the dough to rise.  Other than that, great comfort food!  It cam out warm and soft.  I was pleasantly impressed and my partner was amazed at how professional the rolls looked!  A very tasty meal.  I do recommend making the dough balls smaller (smaller than a golf ball) as someone else recommended because the can get pretty large.

Wonderful, really wonderful! I baked them and the dough's flavor was just fantastic (even though I didn't fry them). The dough was so easy to work with, and I will use it for MANY more applications. My 17 month old and husband couldn't stop eating them! My husband told me that they would be great for SuperBowl Sunday. I know we will make them over and over! Thank you for the fun and delicous recipe:)

Wonderful!  Many many years ago when I was a teenager, my best friend and I used to live on Piroshki we would buy at a local deli in N. Ca.  I loved them and ate them several times a week.  Now that I live in Ky, it is rare to find anyone who has ever even heard of Piroshki.  This recipe is only perfect duplication of the proshki that I remember from my childhood.  Not only are they wonderful, but for me, the ultimate comfort food!  Thank You Taylor's Mommy

Oh my goodness these were INCREDIBLE! Thank you so much taylor's mommy! I just love ethnic food so this was a no brainer for me to try; only thing was my little sisters didn't like it. I don't know why! But I did so I'll make it whether they approve or not! Do take the advice of another member and roll them out thinly. I used wheat flour and they turned out a beautiful golden color.

Made these for Christmas Eve.  The dough is sticky and a little hard to work with.  I fried them in peanut oil.  They were delicious!  Will definitely make again, even though the dough was a pain.

Absolutely perfect!! Had these years ago as a kid at a friends place and loved them!! Have tried to make them before but always an epic fail! This time perfect hubby loved them kids loved them especially my super fussy son!!! They can’t wait to try them as sweets with fruits and custard inside!! I added mushrooms, garlic, small amount of cheese and to the bigs kids aka mum & dad some fresh chilli!!’ They were amazing!!! Thank you so much for a brilliant recipie!!! Dough was perfect!!! Can’t wait to make them again but next time I think I’ll make them just slightly smaller (purely a personal choice and easier for the kids!) eg instead of a golf ball - about 1/2-2/3 the size of. Gold ball! I rolled out quite thinly so we’re larger then anticipated but otherwise perfect!!! Kids already taking about new fillings and ideas (especially my son who loves pizzas! He basically wants me to make a calzone but use this dough as he loves it so more!!!) well family satisfied, all talking about how creative and inspirational we can get with the fillings - so that’s a 15 out of 10 for us!!! (Oh and we fried ours!)

piroshkis are great. I prefer to bake mine and I dont precook the filling I add it in raw. it will cook just fine and in time with the bread part. you can play with the filling a lot. I actually stuffed mine last night with karbanatky and it was amazing. after these cool I throw them in the freezer. they are great for work lunches and reheat well. I also sprinkle salt on my egg wash. makes it kind of like a pretzel

I made this recipe recently on a whim. I have never tried cooking anything remotely like this; only enjoyed them from my Russian co workers. These were delicious and my co worker was impressed.   I would use the dough for many other recipes too.  I did add ground elk meat as well.

These are spot on except my x mother in law used, sautéed ground beef, mashed potatoes, and sautéed sauerkraut all mixed together to fill these wonderful contained sandwichs
 Mix all above ingredients about equal amounts of each, I baked them but she always fried them.  I like them baked the best otherwise the get too heavy tasting.

love this recipe!! I use it all the time, with various fillings. I make it up for lunches (baking them is easier, with an egg wash) in large batches and they last about a week in the fridge.

I followed the recipe exactly but added a little twist like many others have as well. I used ground turkey instead of beef and I also added a jar of spegetti sauce because my kids love Italian food. I also topped the spegetti meat sauce with mozzarella cheese then folded it up. I also rolled my dough thin. I had extra dough left over so I made some deli sliced turkey and cheese rolls as well. All good. Very versatile recipe. Winner.

I have been making these for over 20 years. The only difference in my recipe is I use 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk. Hint: Cook onions first in a little butter with some finely shredded cabbage. Set aside, then cook and drain ground beef. Because ground beef doesn't taste like it use to I use grass-fed ground beef. Also I find that the King Arthur flour works the best for me. After cooking the beef I add shredded cheddar cheese. Then I refrigerate the meat mixture overnight and use a ice cream scoop to fill. If you oil isn't hot enough they will be very greasy.

Amazing recipe! The soft dough just melts in your mouth as soon as you bite into it followed by a very well-seasoned meat mixture. I alternated a little bit and mixed pork and beef together for the flavor of it. All my friends loved it!!! Thanks for sharing!

My grandmother had a friend who was Russian. As an occasional treat, she would make these for us... I hadn't thought of them in YEARS (over 20).  These are EXACTLY what I remembered. Thank you SO much for submitting this recipe.

The dough is wonderful, light and fluffy. I must admit I find Russian fare a little short on the seasoning, and was concerned that the filling would be too bland. For that reason, I added Tabasco sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, beef stock  and chilli flakes. Even with these changes, I think this recipe is great and will definitely be making them again.

This is a great recipe.  I only made half and deep fried it.  I did add some oregano and green chile sauce because the meat seemed too dry and bland.

I will have to try it again and make some alterations to perfect this recipe.  I have a severe gluten allergy, so I used King Arthur GF flour for the base, which may have accounted for some of the texture issues--(yeast doesn't work as well with gluten-less flour).  Usually this brand of flour can be subbed for anything and you can't really tell a difference.  I heavily seasoned the meat and added sour cream and shredded cheddar after reading other reviews that the meat was somewhat dry and bland.  I think this filling tasted very good, but I think it would have been a much better texture if you put it through a fine meat grinder to get rid of the 'graininess' that ground beef has and make it more like a mincemeat or ravioli filling.  My dough rose a little, but didn't get the extreme fluffiness that I think it should have had.  I used rapid rise yeast and let it rise over an hour.  It had the texture more like a dense biscuit wrapper than a fluffy bun like I remember piroshki having.  I fried some and baked some; the fried definitely had a much better flavor.  I found the bread to be overly dense, dry, and a tad bit bland--I will try this recipe again maybe with a different flour or yeast and see if I can get the fluffiness into the bread--I'm sure those of you making it with regular will get the right texture. =)

Hubby and I made these for dinner tonight.  The dough is a dream to work with, once I added about 3/4 of a cup more flour.  Mixed in the KitchenAid.  I did cheat a bit, as we made these more calzone sized for dinner, and left out the dill, as my husband hates it.  We did add a bit of shredded cheese and sliced olives.  Delish!  Hopefully, these freeze well, as we had some leftover that I haven't cooked yet.  Perfect ratio of dough to filling.  Thanks for sharing!

I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of these.  I thought that they were going to be bland, but a little bit of ingredients makes for a real treat in this recipe. The best fresh, but great warmed up too.  I even froze some.

This is similar to my mom's recipe.  I changed it a little:  I add onion soup mix and a little thyme, and a little red wine and let the meat mix cook down and evaporate.  I also make my dough with with about a cup of wheat flour.  My Fry Daddy is the perfect temperature.  Very popular, and I always use canola oil for frying.  This is so yummy.  I love it with sour cream on the side.  Thanks.

YUMMY!!! I love these...we use a lot of dill and even added a dash of cayenne!  I did go the lazy route a few times and used frozen bread dough only because of time constrants but everything was awesome!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, this was so delicious!  Hands down the best recipe I have found on this site.  Very unique.    After frying the pastry (and it fries quickly (on medium heat)!) the dough came out very nice and fluffy!  I couldn't get the ends to stay together though, but no matter, it wasn't too much a problem.  I did add some garlic to the meat mixture beforehand and some beef broth (some people had commented on it being too dry).    But other than that I followed the recipe pretty much to a "T".  My husband and I even made some dessert piroshki with some ingredients we had on hand!  So fun!  :)  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  We won't be having it ALL the time because it is quite caloric and fattening (i might try baking it next time to help with this), but once in awhile it will be an awesome meal for dinnertime.  Thanks again!

Absolutely delicious! My friend Rob made, reviewed and turned me on to these yummy treats that we all ended up loving! Being that he's the Piroshki King, he suggested that a nice variation is adding in a bit of shredded cheese. I made these appy size and they were gobbled up. Thank you Taylor's Mommy!

We liked it.  I baked them, using 1/2 beef and 1/2 venison and I also added garlic and a small amount of bacon to the meat, as well as cheese.  My husband and son liked them, though they thought the meat could use more spices.  I'll keep experimenting with it.  Yummy!

These tasted really good.  they were very similar to what I have been looking for since a Polish guy I worked with brought in these little stuffed rolls his mother made.  The recipe makes a good amount, and that is a good thing because every one loved them.  I served them with a dilled sour cream sauce for dipping, but they were just as good without it. Needed a little more flavor though.  They ones I had before had a little tomato flavor, maybe I'll add a little tomato paste next time.

These turned out very tasty but don't be shy with the dill!  I didn't put enough in the meat so to make up for it I made a sauce with sour cream, dill, garlic and lemon juice, which complemented them wonderfully! 

I also made too many for just one person to eat so I froze them.  I took them out a few days later and baked them for 20-30 minutes (from frozen) and they were even better! 

I think next time I will try as others suggested and use the dough as a based for other ideas like italian, mexican, or greek.

Wow!!!! These are GREAT! My husband can't stop eating them and he is telling everyone about them. I am gad the recipe yielded alot of them because I know everyone will be here tomarrow to try them (if there are any left lol). I did have some dough left so I shaped it into do-nuts and fried them in hot oil and coated with sugar.Did I say wow yet? Taylor's Mom you are great and thank you for sharing..............................

Okay it the saturday of Memorial Day weekend and we were just going to have a quiet weekend til some friends and family said they are coming for breakfast tomarrow. Well I had some beef links in the freezer and I made this dough and made kalachis. Fantastic! I stuffed the leftover dough with cheese, meatballs & jalapeno. Great snack. I love you Taylor's Mommy

It took tree attempts for me to get the yeast activated - but I would do it all over again. I read that some people added cheese - since I had a few laughing cow cubes left (onion flavored) I added them - THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE!!! My husband and son both enjoyed it!

Thank you so much for this recipe! My family enjoyed this very much. I did add 4oz of cream cheese (heat from plan helped melt it) and then once cooled, stirred some mixed shredded cheese into it. Once the Piroshki's were baked or fried the cheese melted and they had a wonderful flavor! I froze half of them so this allows me to fry a couple at a time, serve with some salad and call it dinner! Again, thank you for the recipe.

Yummy!!!  I grew up eating Piroshki's (SF Balboa) and
we had some Russian friends who made them homemade.  I was craving them and didn't want to drive 1 hour into the city to get them.  I might not ever have to go buy them again.  I made these, easy, not very time consuming.  It was fantastic!!  So authentic tasting! I fried half and baked the other half.  They came out great.  The fried ones being better (more authentic) but wow either way it's a winner.

Thanks soooo much Taylor's Mommy, this one goes in my recipe book for life.

These are GREAT!  Like several of the other reviewers, we baked them instead of frying, but they taste wonderful, and are very authentic.

I love trying new Ukrainian and Russian recipes and this is definitely one I will be making again.  
I split the recipe in half, baked them instead of frying - for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees, and added in a few more things to the filling - chopped hard-boiled egg, shredded cabbage, a little bit of minced garlic to the onions, and some chopped up cheese (I used mild monterey jack).  I also brushed the tops with melted butter when they came out of the oven. ..and I served it with a spinach salad. 
Im excited to make this recipe again for my brother who loves Hot Pockets.  He doesnt usually like Russian food but I know he'll love this! :)

I had way more filling than I needed.  I may have had the oil too hot because they were still doughy inside after frying them.  I baked  them at 350 for 15 minutes and then they were fully cooked and the meat was warm.  They were good dipped in ketchup.

I have made these and they were AWESOME! Reminded me of one's we used to get at Serramonte Mall in California. I added Kraft deluxe American, sharp cheddar flavor cheese slices inside.( comes in pkgs of 12 slices) Could use any types of cheese to add but I really liked with this kind. Also, make sure and use plenty of dill weed! It really makes the flavor! Don't be afraid of the name "dill weed"

No changes except in size and using half an onion and replacing dill weed with Adobo seasoning equal to pepper. 

I found using a larger size and stretching dough flatter before frying allowed even cooking and avoided issue with doughy sides using my electric skillet.

I filled mine with mashed potatoes and cheese because I don't eat meat a lot. I tried frying and baking it to compare. Maybe I did it wrong (me and deep frying don't play well together), but the outside didn't cook all the way through at all. Baking it at 400 F for ~12 mins cooked entirely but the outside was hard and nothing like I have had at places near where I live. It tasted fine, it was just not the same.

This is a great recipe. I added extra dill, garlic, and dry mustard to taste;  also 1tbsp Ketchup. I topped the meat mixture with cheese before pinching them closed. I baked them at 375 until light golden brown. Everyone liked them and they freeze well. I will definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing.

I made a few changes.  Iused ground turkey and I cook the onion first until carmelized.  I also backed them so I made them bigger 12.  I used 1/4 cup meat and put grated cheddar cheese on the bottom.   Make sure to make the meat really crumbly so that it doesn't poke through the dough.   I also added thyme in addition to dill because turkey needs favoring,  90/10 ground turkey not the ground turkey breast.  I put an egg yolk and milk wash and bake at 325 convection for 30 min spinning after 15 min.

Maybe I did something wrong?  They didn't seem to have much flavor, and was far more dough than stuffing.  But they made great "dippers" for the soup I made to go with it, so still a win.

These turned out fantastic! I did experience a few hiccups, but we made it through.First, I think I may have added too much liquid to the flour, because it was unreasonably sticky. I eventually just had to "kill it" with flour to even be able to kneed it properly. Due to this, the bread turned out tasting a little bland by itself. So if you have to use a significant amount of extra flour, add in a little extra salt and sugar, or simply make sure you pack in as much filling as possible. Also, my dough didn't really rise as it should have. I think this is because my water wasn't warm enough. I would say to make sure the water is cool enough to not burn you to the touch, but still significantly warm. However, despite the initial dough rise being a flop, they did rise in the oven (we baked our rather than frying. I highly recommend midnitglory's suggestions) well enough and was still edible. Also, we added paprika and garlic to our filling and used a food processor to chop the onions. If the texture of onions is a turn off, a food processor is a must (just chop your onion into large chunks and pulse until it becomes a sloppy paste). You still get the great flavor of fresh onion without the off-putting crunch. If you like the texture, then a mere dice with a sharp knife will do. We had a lot of filling left over, so we threw that in a pot with some green beans, sweet corn, and tomato soup (Basically some canned goods we had laying around) to make a side dish!

They came out really good, I added a little milk to the meat to make it moist and a half tablespoon of butter before closing them up. Unfortunately, when I fried them, they didn't cook all the way through, so now they are in the oven. This was probably one of the most challenging recipes I have ever made, but is worth it. :)

These came out really well. I made some as the recipe states with beef and onions, but I also made some with mashed potatoes and chives. The potato piroshkis were the favorite. Great, versatile recipe.

I glazed this with egg and cooked it in the oven instead of deep frying, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was easy and delicious, and I'll make it again.  I used very lean beef, but it didn't get dry.  However, I think next time I'll saute the onions with another vegetable -- green pepper or cabbage -- for the extra flavor and moisture.

This is a Great recipe! Years ago I would buy peroshkis at a Russian deli in SF. Now live in SoCal and could not find the same anywhere. I've never been good with 'yeast' dough, but I thought I'd give this a try. I was so delighted with the result! Just like I remember! Huge hit with my family too, who never heard of a peroshki before and thought I had lost my mind. Today I make a double batch! woohooo! Thank You!

Since moving back to the US I've been looking for a piroshki dough recipe, and this is it! I wouldn't change a thing about the dough. The filling is nice as well, however as others have mentioned, there are TONS of different fillings you can use. My family is partial to potatoes with fried bulk sausage or ground beef (it's a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes!). I also like them with cabbage. My mother-in-law makes them with apples and then bakes them, if you like it a little sweeter. This is a great recipe to let your imagination go wild!

The First time I prepared these, the filling was far too dry and bland. I also baked them instead of frying them. The next time I made them, I used the dough and prepared my Mother's Shepard's Pie filling with steamed, small cubed potatoes and then added a few handfuls of shredded cheddar. The blend of the seasonings along with the dough was really flavorful. The next day even more so. The second time I prepared them , however, I chose to deep fry them and it really made a huge difference in flavor with this dough. I recommend trying them fried at least once! Overall, I loved the recipe. Thank you TaylorsMommy!

I add a lot of dill.  No cheese.  Baked at 400 for 15 minutes turned out amazing.  Made a very thick "gravy" dip.

These were great!! added lots of dill and some garlic into the hamurger. I fryed them and at 30 seconds per side they turned out perfect. They quickly disappear wherever I bring them.

This was fine. It was nice to have something authentic for our Russian history unit, but it didn't have very much flavor. Although everyone loved rolls! They were very light, flaky and tender. I may make them again if I need rolls. Thanks!

A nice accompaniment to the Russian Potato and Mushroom soup from this site. A great marriage of savoury flavours in a tender bread pocket. I baked mine. I'm sure they're even better deep-fried. The dough was very nice! Very tender. I made half the batch with a sauerkraut/Hungarian paprika sausage mixture for variety. This dough is the perfect wrapper for whatever savoury filling one might like to put in it, authentic or not.

Good, very good dough, but filling was a tad bland. This was my first piroshki, so maybe it is meant to be? still I would make this again. Bit like a blandy beef cornish pasty.

I had a little trouble with my dough but I think it was because the yeast was old.  I had to throw out the first batch and start over.  The Piroshki I finished turned out great!  I was trying to immitate my husband's grandma's recipe and came close. I will be taking these to his parents and brother and sister to try.  I know they are not exactly like Grandma's but they will like them. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I only gave this a four because of a personal preference. Dill is definitely the "taste" needed for true pirozhki. I learned this over 40 years ago from a Russian emigre woman and I miss them so much! Also, you may want to try to add 2-4 boied eggs to the stuffing. You may use a Moulle grinder so that you can shred the eggs into a "fine" grade such that the eggs aren't as visible to those who eat pirozhki made this way.

These were great.  I found them while I was browsing.  I omitted the dill weed, and added some potatoes and cheese.  They were delicious!

I thought that these were okay. Our kids loved them. We thought that we might try it again, but make it a breakfast item with sausage and egg filling. Thanks for the recipe!

We really enjoyed these, I baked them also.  I added a generous amount of dill weed to the filling and it was delicious.

We had a bunch of neighbors over and made these, it's a great recipe!  Cheese would be the perfect addition, but don't overdo it.  We halved the recipe and still had plenty to go around!!
