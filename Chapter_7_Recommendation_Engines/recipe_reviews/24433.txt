Soooo yummy. They were super easy to make and taste awesome. Not too sweet, with almost a fudgey texture. I plan on making these a lot. :)

very yummy! i altered the recipe a bit because i couldn't find one for chocolate flax meal cookies and they turned out great.  I used all butter but cut it to 1/2 cup. reduced flower to 1 1/4 cups added about 3tbs. flax meal and about 1tb milk.

These weren't exactly fabulous cookies. They turned out a little crispy and were flatter than I anticipated. My husband said they were just ok.

These turned out wonderful!  I made them a bit smaller and came out with 20 cookies.  I baked each batch for about 8 minutes.  I ran out of confectioner's sugar, so I ended up rolling the balls of dough in granulated sugar, and they were just as good.  I brought them to my Bible study group, and was asked for the recipe.  Everyone loved them!

I'm sure I did something wrong. I can usually bake all sorts of yummy things, but these cookies turned out very flat, and didn't taste very good. They looked good when I puled them out of the oven, but as they were cooling off, they flattened to pancakes. I'm sure I did something wrong, just not sure what?

Excellent! Was looking for a chocolate fix and it definitely hit the spot. I did add an extra tablespoon of cocoa for a more chocolaty cookie. Will make again for sure but maybe will add some nuts for a nice mix!

Okay but boring.  Recommend increasing cocoa for a more chocolaty flavor, or adding cinnamon or anything really to give it more of a kick.  I made this twice, and once I used all butter instead of half shortening, and it turned out almost like cupcakes, which is fun too.

The recipe is straightforward and easy to follow; however, I thought the cookies were a bit bland, with not nearly enough chocolate flavor.  The consistency, while chewy, was not particularly soft

These cookies are demanded by my aunt and her eight children, my daughter, my husband, my brother-in-law, and various friends. EVERYONE loves them. I make a double batch and they turn out tastey, chewy, and chocolatey.

Texture came out slightly dry. Good color & confectioner's sugar is a nice accent to their appearance. Tasted like brownies when they were hot but the next day they were a bit dry and the taste flat. If you are looking for a real deep chocolate taste this is not the recipe. But if you are just looking to make something basic with ingredients you probably already have in the cupboards then this will do. Would not go out of my way to make them again though.

We had some candy cane Hershey Kisses left over from Christmas and my husband thought they'd go great on a chocolate cookie.  WOW!  Especially when still warm!! I used all butter b.c I didn't have shortening, but everything else was spot on.  8 minutes in the oven and then add the kisses and then 1 minute longer.  I got 27 normal size cookies out of the batch.  If you use regular kisses, 71/2 min. baking and 1 1/2 longer after kisses.  Candy cane ones melt quicker (not sure about other type kisses). So excited for next Christmas to make these!  Thank you!

I made these as written with the exception of omitting the powdered sugar.  I found these to be very addicting.  The recipe is easy and simple, and the cookies are nice and fudgy.  To enhance the chocolately flavor extra cocoa or espresso powder could be added, but I enjoyed these as is.

Easy recipe, kind of bland for our taste.  Not a lot of cookies from the basic recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly.  I thought this was terrible.  For one thing, they were quite salty - even though I only used the 1/2 teaspoon.  And when I put the spoonful on the sheet, it didn't melt down and flatten out.  It kept the spoon scoop shape.  Just really bad!

These cookies are delicious.  I made one batch following the recipe exactly - I couldn't believe how soft and velvety they were. I made a second batch to which I added coconut, almonds and chocolate chips, which my husband preferred.  Even my dad, who likes his cookies crispy and hard, loved my second batch.  Yummy!!

These where great cookies. I made 42 small cookies. If comes out dry then you cooked it too long. I plan to make this recipe when I have a quick desert that is rich and soft. YUM
