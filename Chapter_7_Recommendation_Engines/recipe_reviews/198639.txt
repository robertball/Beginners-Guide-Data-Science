I would love to give this 5 stars for everything else, but made as written, it is exceedingly sweet, too much even for this sweet tooth. I could only eat half the bowl. I will make this again, but cut the honey way down, or use a bit of maple syrup instead. Ripe bananas are pretty sweet to begin with, so 3 tbs of honey takes it too far. Also, use ground flax instead of flax seeds, as the nutrition benefits of flax are only released when the seeds are ground. Steel cut oats can be adapted to this recipe. Keep a parcooked container of steel cuts in the refrigerator to use in place of the quick oats. Still cook as directed and they will turn out great.  I love the combination of banana and walnuts in this recipe. Flavor and crunch! Thanks for sharing, Sunshine7!

Delicious and great for breakfast!  I used wheat germ instead of flax seeds and maple syup instead of honey plus added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I added a few additional slices of banana on top. Nice recipe!

Please note, the only way to receive the benefits of flax seed is for them to be finely ground or use flax seed oil. The body can't break down flax seed in it's whole form. Therefore, there's no benefit to eating flax seed whole.

What better way than to start off my morning with a warm oatmeal with bananas and walnuts! This morning I used steel cut oatmeals instead of quick cooking oats and very little skim milk.  I used wheat germ instead of flax seeds and brown sugar in place of honey. I also added a few additional slices of bananas on top. This was satisfying, healthy and delicious!

Surprisingly good!  This is a quick, healthy breakfast and even my 5 year old really liked it.  I didn't have honey so I used some brown sugar. I will definitely do this again.  The oatmeal was a little chewy so I'll add a little more milk next time.

This was great - I used wheat germ instead of the flax - but will just eliminate it next time and use all oats.  I tried pecans instead of walnuts - think either would be good.  I did add a bit of brown sugar - maybe next time I'll add a dab of peanut butter to go with that banana!!!  This was easy and quick and I knew exactly what I put in it - as opposed to all those packet-mix oatmeals!!!  You could even do bettter than those packets - you could use this as a base (minus the banana) and add your own peaches and cream, maple and brown sugar, or apples and cinnamon!!!!  Thanks for the great recipe and recipe base!!!!!!!!!  Ten stars!!!

I reduced the honey to one tablespoon and it was still WAY too sweet. Won't make this again.

A bit too sweet, but realize that flax not only needs to be ground but it also looses its nutritional value when it is heated - so don't waste your money on the flax seed (or any other product that is cooked with flax seeds/oil).

The concept of this recipe, in my opinion, deserves 3 stars. You do have to change the flax seeds to be sure you used ground flax seeds. And, that is too much honey, way too sweet. But, I used ground flax seed, less honey, and I used old fashion oats and just put the honey, banana, flax seed and walnuts on at the end. I eat this at least once a week, thanks for inspiring a healthy breakfast I can add to my rotation!

This is Rebeccas recipe but she puts cinnamon in before cooking. Also she wouldn't put as much honey in as this recipe. Maybe half this amount. After cooking she adds sliced banana, handful of craisins & more milk if needed.

This was really good as well as quick and easy. You could whip this up in no time on a morning before work. I subbed maple syrup for the honey and still used 3 tablespoons. It tasted awesome, but I think I could have cut out a tablespoon or so to reduce the sugar a little. I meant to add some cinnamon, but forgot. I'll try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This oatmeal has good flavor, but I think adding cinnamon and nutmeg would make it five stars. I used honey but since other reviewers said it was a bit too sweet with 3 tbsp, I added it a tbsp at a time until it was just sweet enough for me (ended up being just under 2 tbsp).  I like the idea of using maple syrup, I'll be trying that next time.  This is a nice, filling breakfast on those cold mornings. Thanks for sharing!

I cut way back on the honey, maybe added a couple teaspoons and that was plenty.  Overall, pretty good.

I dislike bananas, but I eat them because they're cheap and healthy, but I more than tolerated this - I enjoyed it! Based on other reviews, I cut the sweetener (I used pure maple syrup) way down - to 1 Tbsp - and my husband still thought it too sweet so I'll try 1/2 Tbsp next time.

This recipe would have been very good but there was WAY to much honey in it. It was so sweet I couldnt stand to eat it all. Next time i will put only 1 tablespoon of honey, then it will be very delicous! But thanks for a great oatmeal recipe.

A very nice flavored oatmeal.  I used brown sugar instead of honey, and only about 1 1/2 T because i don't like overly sweet in the morning.  Will definately make again.

I substituted maple syrup for honey and wheat germ for flax seeds, but this recipe was delicious anyway.  Not too sweet and a great way to use ripe bananas.  I will definitely make often.  I also cooked it on the stove and stirred the bananas right in.  Even my 1-yr old liked it.

I cooked it on the stove because I was making a double serving for me and my husband. I added cinnamon and lite maple syrup to taste (maybe 1 teaspoon of each?). I didn't have walnuts, but pecans were great in it. I've had almonds in my oatmeal before -- also good! I did use bananas, but you could also add apples, peaches, strawberries, whatever fresh or canned fruit you have on hand.  I used half 2% and half water, and added the ground flax seed on the top after it was done cooking -- you never want to cook flax seed, as it gets lumpy and nasty that way, and I've also heard that cooks out the nutrients.  Overall, a good starter recipe. Thanks!

I added 1/4 cup of wheat bran, used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts (didn't have the walnuts), omitted the honey (personal preference), and only used half the banana. It was delicious and didn't even need any sugar or spices!

This tasted just like warm banana nut bread.  I substituted wheat germ for flax seed and 1T light maple syrup for 1T honey (used 2T honey).  My whole office at work was asking "what is that smell?".  My new breakfast!!!

Yummo!  I eat oatmeal fro breakfast everyday, and this is gonna be one of my regular. I used old fashioned oats. I cooked the oats first for about 10 mins with half regular milk and half water. Then in the last 5 mins I added the rest of the ingredients. I used some honey ( maybe 1 tbls) and about 3 tbls brown sugar for 1.5 cups of oats so it was not very sweet. Also I added a pinch of salt. And it turned out awesome. My husband liked it too. I did grind the flax seeds and added about 3 tbls of it, as it is healthy.  Well as I said it turned out yummy and not too sweet. And it will be a regular breakfast for me.

My new favorite way to have oatmeal in the morning.  Except I just cooked the oatmeal in water added a bit of milk to thin out after. Used chopped raw almonds instead of walnuts. And I add cinnamon but no sweeter. I prefer to not start the day with any sugar but that's just me.

I thought this was really good.  I didn't have any flax seed or walnuts on hand, so I just didn't use them.  I did make changes in the amounts that I used.  I took 2/3 cup of old fashioned oats, 3/4 cup of milk and I used 4 tablespoons of honey instead of 3 being I was using more oatmeal.  Next time I'll use only 3 because it was very sweet, good but too sweet.  I took a banana and mashed about 2/3 to 3/4 of it and cut the rest to put onto top of the oatmeal.  Mixed everything together, minus the banana slices, and microwaved it for 2 minutes.  Came out really good.

I made this and it was way too sweet.  Next time I will leave out the honey and put a drop of liquid Greenleaf stevia in it.  If you do like honey, start with a Teaspoon and then add more if desired.  Also, the recipe states to add all the ingredients them microwave.  That included the banana.  Then it says, may be typo, to add mashed banana after. Not sure which way she meant to say but I had to add another banana just to tone down the sugary taste.

I used old fashioned oats and followed the microwave instructions for one cup, I doubled the rest of these ingredients and used ground flax seed. I found it was absolutely perfect. I think that the recipe as is would be way too sweet. I had four times as much oatmeal and twice as much of everything else.

Excellent quick and easy breakfast.  My 21 month old loved it, walnuts and all.  Followed the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 Tbs of honey.  Great way to use those bananas that always seem to ripen way too fast!

I used almond milk and toasted walnuts. Mixed the bananas into the oatmeal. It was wonderful!

Had this today instead of having a banana and a bowl of oatmeal.  I sliced the banana, added the honey, water, milk to the oats and cooked in the microwave.  Stirred it together and added some almond milk.  It was great.  Not too overwhelming on the banana flavor, and just the right creaminess.

I was actually surprised I liked this - I don't really like walnuts and while I love bananas, I don't usually like them in things. This was great though. I used already cooked steel cut oats (so I omitted the milk), and cut the honey down to 1 tsp (as others suggested). This is a great, healthy breakfast!
