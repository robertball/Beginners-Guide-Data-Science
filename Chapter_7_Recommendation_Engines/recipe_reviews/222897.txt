This is a perfect cocktail! Dom't mess cocktails with slurpy or syrupy ingredients. Either you like the taste of liquor or you don't. The rest is unneeded extra calories.

I've had a few of these in my day and paid the price the next morning.

increased the Drambuie to one oz, so it's a 1/2 with scotch being two oz.
to be correct, I've probably made this cocktail thousands of times over these many years.  I'm 78.
