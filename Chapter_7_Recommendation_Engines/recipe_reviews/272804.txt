Doubled the sauce ingredients because we like our stir-fry saucy and it was the perfect amount. I think it needs it actually. Shrimp and snow peas is always a good combo but if I were to make this again I'd cook the shrimp first to get better color on them and then put them back in the mix at the very end. Overall a good recipe.
