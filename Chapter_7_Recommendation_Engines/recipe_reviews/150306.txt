This recipe is awesome! My family loved it. To fix the buttermilk dilemma some reviews have mentioned, try this: to make substitute buttermilk, add 1-3/4 tablespoons of cream of tartar to a cup of milk, or add a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup of milk and let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes. In many baking recipes, you can also just use plain yogurt or sour cream instead of buttermilk. I use the vinegar method but the rest are good to know. I never buy buttermilk anymore because I never use the whole carton. Buttermilk is one of those where I could have it for weeks then not need it, as soon as it goes bad I need it. This is handy to keep in your box for any recipe calling for buttermilk, when in a pinch use a substitute.

Yum!  I recommend salt and peppering the meat before dipping it in the flour and buttermilk mixture.  Otherwise, the meat itself tastes bland.

This is the best recipe I've found for chicken fried steak!  I allow my steaks to "rest" on a wire rack after the final coating of flour - which seems to help the coating adhere - also make sure to pat your steaks dry with paper towels then season them as you'd like before beginning the breading process -  this will also help the coating adhere better.  It is also important that the oil reach the proper temperature before adding the steaks - I used Mazola Canola oil instead of shortening and did not need near the amount called for - used maybe 3/4 - 1c total.  After the steaks are cooked and keeping warm (to prevent sogginess keep them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet) in a 200 oven; I do add some finely chopped onion and garlic to the oil and drippings in the pan and saute before adding the flour and milk - make sure the flour is cooked in the oil to avoid a pasty, flour-y taste to your gravy.  I also like to add about 1/4c chicken stock after adding the milk - I found I only needed about 2 1/2 to 3c of milk.  These additions seem to give the gravy the boost my family likes.  An EXCELLENT recipe that my family loves, thanks so much for sharing!

This is my full proof recipe for Chicken fried steak,it's my husbands FAVORITE meal and whenever I make it for him or anyone else I get compliments throughtout the night. The hot sauce doesn't make it hot but instead brings out the flavors of everything else, this is the absolute perfect recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was AWESOME!  The coating on the steaks had wonderful flavor, and crisped up perfectly! I used fresh turkey cube steaks that I get from my local farmers market, and we didn't miss the beef at all.  Other then stirring a little hot sauce into the gravy at the end, I followed the recipe as written.  Served with mashed potatoes and applesauce, this is a new fave!  Thank you for this great addition to my favorites file!

My middle son loves chicken fried steak and so do I. He came back for seconds with this recipe. I had to change it a little. Because I'm in the Denver area, frying can be a problem - things get overdone on the outside while undercooked inside. So as soon as the outsides were done, I put them in the oven like shake-and-bake for about 1/2 hour. Also, IMHO, a touch of garlic immensely improves country gravy, so I added garlic powder to the gravy. I also couldn't find uncultured buttermilk, but regular milk worked fine.

Really, really delicious according to my gang butI did highly season the flour with garlic and onion powders and dried parsley flakes. Because I was being a lazy girl, I chose to use cube steaks which are obviously already tenderized. Everyone loved the gravy too. OMG, I just hit my back button to find and thank the submitter of this recipe and I see it's you Norah! So thanks sweetie pie!

Truly the best chicken fried steak I've ever eaten.  Chicken fried steak has always been a diner favorite of mine,  but never cooked it at home.   Followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with a crispy, non-greasy, delicious coating on our cube steaks.   I served it with collard greens and "irish champ" ,  an allrecipes  recipe.   Both my boyfriend and I loved it and will certainly serve it again.  Thanks smylpurty!

YUMMY! I omitted the baking soda/powder stuff, used some McCormick Seasoning Salt, garlic powder and pepper for seasoing the meat and flour and it came out so good! Thank you for the inspiration and the directions! :)

Followed the recipe with everything except 3 cups of shortening for frying.  I used 1 stick of shortening and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.  I let my oil stay too hot and the bits and flour got too dark in the bottom of the pan, ill have to monitor the temp a little better next time.  I seasoned the steaks on both sides with salt and pepper prior to pounding out.  I placed steaks between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, and kept the mallot clean.  
I love the idea of using buttermilk and hot sauce in the egg mixture, I think that Ill cut back a tad bit on the hot sauce though next time.  I never buy buttermilk..for every 1 cup of buttermilk needed; I replace 2 tablespoons of regular milk with 2 tablespoons of white vinegar or lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes to sour. I didnt have a problem with the breading coming off of the meat, a few of the tricks to preventing this is to make sure the oil is hot enoug as well as have the steaks at room temperature when breading and frying.  This is to prevent too much rapid shrinkage.  If the cubed steaks are very cold when breaded and frying, the meat will shrink very fast leaving gaps between the fried breading and the meat causing the breading to come off more easy.  Also only flip the steaks ONCE!! resist the urge to keep flipping back and forth! Too much flipping will cause the breading to loosen and come off. Next time Ill only make half the recipe for gravy, as written it makes way too much for just 4 servings. Great recipe! Keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and is was perfect.  I noticed the only two people who have given this recipe 4 stars instead of 5, DIDN'T FOLLOW THE RECIPE.  Maybe their cooking is only 4 stars but norah's is 5.

Very good!! This recipe is basically how my family has made CFS for generations. For the gravy, I started with 2 cups chicken broth/bouillion and 2 cups milk. We used to use the left over water from when we boiled the potatoes  for mashed potatoes. Then added the milk for cream gravy. For lumpless gravy.... add the salt to the flour and make sure the flour is cooked BEFORE you add the liquid ingredients.

I just made these today, Sunday. I believe, after my first bite, I saw God. (Don't be offended, I'm a devout Catholic with a wicked sense of humor.) I didn't deviate at all from the ingredients. I "rested" the steaks for about 15 minutes before frying in Crisco. I drain mine on a wire rack vs. paper towels because it avoids sogginess. My darling, you are an absolute wizzard in the CFS department. I grew up in southern KS and have lived all over the south, and the world, in fact. These simply cannot be beat. My first thought was for Bobby Flay to discover you and challenge you to a throwdown. Thank you for a FLAWLESS recipe!

My first time making this sort of thing and faired pretty well.  I am, however, glad that I refered also to my bible, "Joy of Cooking," and decided to let the battered & floured steaks rest/dry out on a wire rack for 15 min. before frying.  This made the batter stick much better.  I used vegetable oil instead of solid shortening and fried them in a heavy nonstick skillet as I do not have a cast iron one.   I served these with mashed potatoes, 
"Kickin' Collard Greens," also from this site, and buttermilk biscuits.  All in all, a successful first effort for a Yankee.

This recipe is the best! The coating stays on and is very flavorful.  I did only use half the hot sauce for my own taste.  I also added 1 chicken bouillon cube to the pan gravy for a little extra flavor.  This was better than Cracker Barrel and we love Cracker Barrel.

This recipe is amazing! I did the milk/vinegar sub for buttermilk (1 cup milk and 1 tbsp vinegar) because I never have reason to keep buttermilk in the house. It worked like a charm. This batter cooks so perfectly brown and crispy. Absolutely delicious. My picky husband and even pickier toddler ate it up like it was the last meal theyd ever eat. This is a keeper! Wonderful. Edited: Made this again. I swear this just gets better and better everytime I make it. I was CRAVING this for dinner tonight....and now Im in a food coma. MAKE THIS! IT IS THE BEST!

I'm from Oklahoma and Chicken Fried Steak has always been a staple where we are from. The only thing different in this than the way we've always done it is the addition of the baking soda and powder. This makes an amazing crust. I now have a whole new love for chicken fry!

I previously stayed away from trying to cook this and opted to purchase chicken fried steak from restaurants. Well, not anymore. One of the best breading recipes I have come across for chicken fried steak. The crust was crispy and seasoned and I even got the gravy right.  Tip to everyone saying that it is bland... one of the first lessons of frying anything is to season the meat first. Otherwise, you have seasoned breading with tasteless meat. And always season to YOUR taste.

Delicious. I didn't add as much Tabasco as called for because I only had a bottle of hot sauce (not Tabasco) and was afraid it would be too hot. I also prefer a beef gravy, so I used my homemade beef stock and some milk to make mine :) Yummy!

Great recipe.  I've always had a problem with the crust coming off the steak during the frying, but didn't happen with this one and the crust is so nice and light.  I used sirloin steak and pounded it to 1/4 inch.  It was so tender you could have cut it with a fork.  Think this crust method would work great with chicken or pork as well.

Wow, what a great recipe norah!  Thank you so much for posting.   I followed it except for just a couple things.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it made plenty for 3 healthy servings.  I didn't use fresh garlic, instead adding some garlic powder.  I also added about 1 tsp of beef base to the gravy and it put it over the top!  I like making the batter with all the seasonings in it and then just the plain flour.  The flavor was fabulous, the texture perfect and I'll be making this inexpensive dinner again very soon!

It's STEAK made in the way one makes FRIED CHICKEN.  Hence the name:  Chicken-Fried Steak.  I hate to see low reviews posted just to ask a question.  I realize this is a regional favorite, but it is well-known, and the name says it all.  Oh, and it's yummy.

YUMMMMMMM!  Only change was that I let the meat rest with coating on it for a good 20" while I ran over to the kids house.  Oh - and I fried in olive oil and butter instead of shortening.  Served with obligatory mashed potatoes and roasted snap peas & carrots.  Wonderful.

I'm the Chicken Fried Steak queen, and I declare this recipe fabulous! :-)  I used the suggestion of substituting buttermilk with 1.5 cups milk & 1.5 tbsp white vinegar, and that worked beautifully. I also second the recommendation of salting/peppering the meat before coating so that it has more flavor inside the breading. Terrific recipe, though. Didn't follow the instructions for the gravy, so I can't comment on that.

This came out perfect! I took the advice of someone else and made a substitute buttermilk with vinegar and milk worked perfect :) This is just might have been better than my moms ;)

This recipe lived up to its name.  I am NOT a fan of Chicken Fried Steak by any stretch of the imagination however one of my friends who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit and Chicken Fried Steak is her favorite so I decided to fix it.  Finding this recipe, I gave it a shot and it was delicious.  The crust worked so well with the meat and I was VERY impressed.  Five Stars baby! I will be using this recipe again!

i love chicken fried steak but wanted something a little different from the usual roll em in flour and fry em up...  something with a little kick.  this is definitely exactly what i was looking for and it is now the only chicken fried steak i will make.  i add a bit extra hot sauce and some cayenne pepper just for that little bit extra spice, make the gravy with the leftover flour and egg wash.  mmmmmm!  this has made chicken fried steak exciting again.

Well this went soo fast, I was able to find my family of 6, this meal....was totally excellent. I used pork cubed steaks...and it worked soo well. All gave a 5 star all the way. The gravy the 1st time rounded didn't work right. Was way to milky and thin. So I dumped the batch and started again. What I found it needed was more flour and reserved grease...double what it called for, slightly less milk about 1/4 - 1/2 cup. But all in all it was great. Even with using pork and not beef....Will make again with beef.....Thanks

Great recipe! I used it for my first time to cook as a rookie at the fire station and they liked it so much it went on the "must cook" list. The only bad thing is now they think I can cook.

This was my first time making chicken fried steak and I thought the instructions were confusing. I had to consult another recipe to figure out that the flour was mixed with the baking powder & soda but other than that My hubby enjoyed his treat very much! It had a great flavor! The cube steaks were a little chewy but that was probably my fault. thank you!

Very good recipe.  Our family likes things a little spicy so the Tabasco was just right.   The trick to any good chicken fried steak (or anything fried) is the oil temperature.  Too hot and it will burn.  If not hot enough, whatever you are frying will turn out greasy and uncrisp.  Perhaps this is what some of the reviewers were experiencing.

My first time making chicken fried steak.  This was so much better than anything I ever had in a restaurant! As suggested by another commenter, I salted and peppered the steaks before breading. The whole family loved it.

Holy cow!  I cannot believe how good this was. Outstanding!  The baking powder and soda made the difference in the batter.  It's a new family favorite.

The spice mix was good (although I added a few more not listed).  The crunch was good, but the coating was thin.  I am amazed at the readers uploaded pictures.  How did you get the batter to stay on like that?  My pieces looked beautiful, until I turned them over and the coating fell off.  This batter just doesnt stick when you cut into the meat either.  I found the combination of baking soda and baking powder strange.  When you add the liquid you have a chemical reaction go off.  Also when you dip the steak after the first coating of flour all the flour you just had on it disappears into the liquid.  I am also not convinced that the pepper, salt and spices should go in the liquid mix since it sinks to the bottom and misses the chance to spice up the steak.  I just really want the flavor and texture of a good old chicken fried steak and sadly this doesnt cut it.  By the end I even tried making a thick paste by mixing the flour in with the liquid.  The batter seemed to stick better and it definitely had more spices coating it.  I will try this recipe again until I find the answer to a better sticking batter.

Don't know what happened with this, and I had such high hopes!  All the breadding fell off the meat and it made a huge mess.  This did not turn out well for me at all.  It was a dinner disaster :+(

Recipe was great! I used the Powdered buttermilk (I think it is by baker's secret) because I don't use it that often, but when I need it it is not around. My kids love CFS!

I've never eaten chicken fried steak before but my BF requested it, so I used this recipe.  Since I had no other experience to compare it to, I can't review the taste, but my BF said it tasted great.  It was fairly easy to prepare and I liked this recipe because it didn't call for any odd ingredients that I had to buy special (except for buttermilk).  I used a packaged white country gravy instead of making my own.  Since my BF liked this so much, I will definately be using this recipe again.

Yum--I love the crunchiness of this!  Next time I will add more salt and will make about half the amount of gravy, but will definitely make again!  UPDATE: We prefer half milk/half broth for the gravy.

Any time a family member even starts to talk about good chicken fried steak, I hand over this recipe!  Country gravy is something I haven't been able to master yet, so I usually just use the packages.  I also like to play around with the seasonings a bit.  Seasonings like paprika seem to work great with this recipe.  I also season the meat to add more flavor.  I tend to put them in the oven, as well, to help keep them warm.  BEST chicken fried steak recipe!

Unfortunately I was not very impressed by this recipe.  The steaks to me were bland.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was.  No trouble in making them.  I do feel like it was a lot of work for just chicken fried steaks.  Gravy was good but not impressive.

I made this with chicken cube "steaks." It is so good! I also baked it at 400 degrees instead of frying it. I served it with cauliflower cheese and Irish Champ from this site (two separate nights). YUM! It's a keeper. I will try it with beef when we're eating more red meat.

My husband said this was just an okay recipe, not worth all the work. I thought it was a lot of work for just an okay recipe. But, not having tried it myself (not a big chicken fried steak fan), I am not the most fair judge. However, from all the reviews, I expected him to say it was great.

I had never made chicken fried steak before attempting this recipe and when I try new things my husband likes to grumble about it....MEN! Well after cooking this recipe he said, "Is this your first time cooking chicken fried steak?". He had no excitement in his voice so I said, "Yes, why? Is it not any good?". He replied, " No...no...it is absolutely DELICIOUS!!" And it really was. The batter recipe is great!

First time I make it. It was ok. I fried it first and then kept it warm  in the oven (250F), and got soggy, I think that was my mistake. However the flavor was ok, but I'm looking for a very crispy coating and this didn't seem to be it, :(. I still will try it again

I have mixed reviews on this.  I had never used shortening for frying, so that was new for me.  I thought I heated it properly, but the steak got brown way too quick, so they turned out a tad overdone on the outside and still pink in the middle.  I guess it was too hot and maybe that was the problem, or maybe I left them too long.  Also, I would assume with all the seasonings in the coatings that it would have more intense flavor, but it didn't.  Maybe it was because it was overdone and that masked the seasonings.  Also, the gravy was a tad bland, but not bad.  Overall, the meat was tender and it was a good meal.  Maybe next time I will try oil for frying, since that is what I'm more familiar with.

This was WONDERFUL!!  Def one we'll make again & again & again... and I followed the recipe as it was given for spices & flavor  :))) 
The pack of steaks I bought had 6 pieces & totalled out just over 2 pounds.  That being said, I thought about makin more flour mix, but didn't... and it's a good thing I didn't!!  There was PLENTY!
I did the lemon juice in a cup of milk since I didn't have any Buttermilk & it worked perfectly.  I did NOT know that lemon juice would "curdle" milk so I was a little shocked when the milk "plopped" out of the cup lol
We didn't have shortening & I wasn't going to buy any just for 1 recipe.  We used Canola Oil & it worked perfectly & had no "oil" taste :)
We made mashed potatoes & fried okra to go along with it. :)

Great recipe. I spiked the buttermilk with chipotle tabasco. Seasoned the flour with garlic powder. Seasoned the meat with salt n pepper before anything else. Fantastic, got raves. CFS is almost a religon here in Texas, and this is a good one.

This is undoubtably the best chicken fried staek recipe I have ever used. The only thing I would change is I would season the flour just a tad and add a little more tobasco to the batter. Wow, this is delicious!

Not being Southern, I had to search for a Chicken Fried Steak recipe, and this one is fantastic.  This satisfied my Southern husband immensely.  It was easy to make, delicious, crisp and came of wonderfully for my first time Fried Steak experience.  I didn't make any real changes to the recipe, I believe I doubled the flour part, as I did have more then 1/2 lb of cube steak.  I did fry mine in canola oil, as that is what I prefer. I recommend this recipe to everyone. Fabulous.

My husband said this was the best chicken fried steak he's ever had.  I have always had a problem with my previous recipe's breading falling off, and this breading didn't do that--it stuck to the meat great!  I omitted the hot pepper sauce, as I'm a weany when it comes to pepper.  This is my new go-to recipe!  Delicious!!

I don't normally rate anything this low but it was a flop from start to finish.  I followed the recipe exactly. You could not batter them first then fry or the flour started to get gummy requiring you to flour again.  The gravy was way too greasy tasting so I added cream of mushroom soup to add some taste.  My husband said, you usually have winner dinners but this one was not that good.  So true!

This recipe definitely is a home run! One thing I have to mention is that the recipe makes enough for at least 6 steaks, so you may want to adjust accordingly. I added 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning to give it the authentic "chicken" flavor. As a substitute for buttermilk, I whisked 3/4 cup sour cream with 3/4 cup milk and it worked great. I didn't put the spices in with the milk & egg. I mixed them with the flour so that when I used the flour for the gravy, it was seasoned. It also wasn't necessary to use so much shortening. I started with 1 cup and added an additional 1/2 cup as I cooked the steaks. This is a wonderful recipe - hope this helps!

This is really truly a great recipe. I used the video hint of putting the steaks on a cookie rack to rest/dry before frying, and I think that really helps keep the breading intact.  Great recipe! Thanks!

Being from Texas I've had many a chicken fried steak. I must say that this recipe is in fact the best chicken fried steak I ever made at home. Perhaps I've had better at restaurants but for the home cook this recipe is phenomenal. I did it exactly as the instructions told me to, and the buttermilk dredge with the baking soda and baking powder make it so flavorful and delicious. Definitely a go to recipe.

A very good and tasty recipe. To boost flavor, instead of salt in the flour mix I use Morton Season All seasoned salt, and 2 tbs. A good way to make the flour to stick to the batter: instead of patting the flour onto the steak, press very firmly with your palm, rocking sideways and forward/back. I normally start with a good portion of the flour mix to the side. I put the battered steak in the main mix then pour the flour to the side over it then start pressing, then flip and repeat.

This is the best recipe!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used just under 1 1/2 c. of regular milk mixed with a tablespoon of vinegar and let it sit for five minutes before mixing it in.  I also used a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  My family told me this was the best thing I've ever made!

This might be okay for someone who has never eaten well seasoned food with flavor, but not acceptable at my house.  The steak was terribly bland... no flavor.  I was so turned off, I didn't even bother making the gravy, which should complement the steak, not provide ALL the flavor.  In the garbage can it went.

Very good as is.  I used canola oil since it was what I had.  I used a small skillet filled it about a quarter inch in oil and important that the oil get hot. Fried one at a time 5 min per side.  The crust was well browned and crispy.  Next time I will add much more spices along with paprika more pepper and garlic.  Season the meat before flouring.  Thanks Norah.

Sorry, not that great.  When I read to use 1/4 cup of the shortening to make the gravy I was a bit unsure.  I should have gone with my gut and made the rue from butter instead.  It made the gravy taste like fryer oil.  One should either brine or pre seasons the cube steak to take from the blandness.  Perhaps even add some MSG to the flower mixture for some enhancement.

I have made this "NO FAIL" recipe twice, and making it again for a family dinner tomorrow.  This is THE BEST recipe I have EVER tasted!  What freaked me out was we had a steak go into the fridge over night...when we warmed it back up for "breakfast"...IT WAS STILL CRISPY like when I first made it.  Promise, this will be the last recipe for this in particular, that you will ever need!  BRAVO!

I thought the meat was bland, the gravy was bland and the whole thing was greasy.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I am not going to try it again to find out.

this was my first time ever making chicken fried steak. my family is still raving!! i pretty much followed the recipe exactly (which is a rare thing) because of lack of experience with it. it was very easy and not too greasy. the gravy was also very good, and i usually suck at making gravy! served with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans. i will be making this one again! thank you for submitting it!!

I would have given this all 5 stars for crispiness alone! If you like flavor, you'll have to kick it up a notch or 2. Easy enough! I recommend adding MORE pepper, salt, garlic and pepper sauce! Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will double all the seasonings. Also, since you'll have extra milk mixture, mix it with your leftover flour, 1/2 cup of cornmeal and 1 tablespoon of onion powder. Then drop by the spoonful into the hot oil. My twins called them cornballs, I called them corn fritters. Either way it makes a really nice addition to this Southern style meal!

Turned out better than I expected.  Yay!  My hubby's from TX - so I was hoping for a good result, but didn't think I could do it right.  For some reason, I've never been good at deep frying.  With this recipe - no problem! Thanks!

Iv'e made this several times. First time not too bad. The next time, I did, however, need to add more hot sauce, worshire, and other spices, it just tastes like it was missing something.

Personally, I feel that this is the best chicken fried steak I have ever had outside of a restaurant. I was absolutely wowed by it! I'm only giving it four stars because the boyfriend said that he just felt like it was missing something, but I have no idea what it could be! I followed the recipe, only adding more salt and pepper, and I used Frank's hot sauce. The only complaint I had was that the gravy turned out a little greasy, but that can be easily rectified on my behalf (and has no weighing on my rating). I think this was phenomenal. I can't wait to make it again.

I made this a few weeks ago and let me tell you, my hubby and I were both so bonkers over this recipe that we will probably never order chicken fried steak in a restaurant again.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  It really does only take a few minutes per side.  It is phenomenal and we will probably use this more often than we should. :)  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Never made this before. One of my boyfriends favorites so I thought I'd give it a try. Kind of a pain to make but worth it! I didn't make the gravy because I'm not into that kind of gravy but the steak came out great and my boyfriend loved it :)

I like to add Thyme to the gravy.  Also, I use powered Buttermilk since it keeps along time in the refrigerator.

Be careful how hot you cook this or the crust will burn before the meat is done.

I love the way the breading stays on the steaks! So tasty too!  We really didn't like the gravy, however.  It lacks flavor and is just yucky.  We prefer a country gravy mix, but the chicken fried steak is GREAT!

My husband said this was the best CFS he has ever had.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 2% milk with Cream of Tartar and it came out delicious.  I didn't have time to make the gravy, so I just used the McCormick's packaged white gravy and it still was wonderful.  This will definitely be on my rotation.

Great chicken fried steak recipe.  I have tried to make this numerous times and I was finally staisfied with the breading.  My wife and I have lived here in Fort worth for nearly a year now and if there is one dish I have learned that is Texan it is chicken fried steak.  This recipe is sure to satisfy any true texans out there I'm sure.  Only change I made was omitting the hot sauce, substituting 1 1/4 cp milk and 1/4 cp vinegar for buttermilk and using garlic salt instead of real galrlic.  It still turned out awesome, oh yeah and I only needed 3 cups of milk for the gravy,  This was just for my wife and I and we still had plenty left over.

Rating on the chicken fry only, we did not care for the gravy at all.  For all those who are complaining about the blandness, any fried food really needs to be seasoned after it is fried, otherwise the seasoning gets cooked out.

I have been in search of the perfect chicken fried steak, and this, without a doubt, is it! The Tabasco sauce adds just a little zip, but not so much that my 3 and 6 year old wouldn't eat it. They loved it, too!

The only two problems' I see is when the steak is done do not tent with foil this will cause the breading to separate from the meat and also get soggy that is because of the steam that gets trapped under the foil dry on a paper towel then place on a wire rack in a 300 degree oven till all is done now the gravy I have seen another comment saying let the flour brown before adding the milk to cook the flour taste out no add the milk and cook for 10 to 15 minutes that will do the trick this is a white pepper gravy not a base for Gumbo please don't be offended I am only giving constructive criticism the recipe still gets 5 Stars in my book keep up the great work

This sounds really good.  I'll probably make it soon.  I just wanted to let you all know you can freeze butter milk. I used ice cube trays and measuring cups and then put the frozen cubes in a fezzer bag.  It works great and then you don't waste it.

There is the little drive in in Lufkin, TX called Rays Drive In, they serve the best steak fingers you will ever eat and these are the closest to it I have ever come across and I made them myself. I am not a good cook LOL so my husband was knocked off his feet when he came home to this Chicken Fried Steak! I have four kids and they all loved it as well. Make sure you do them at room temperature and use the hot sauce as it ads flavor not heat. I made my own buttermilk as well by adding lemon juice to milk, it was easy and only had to let it set 30mins.

My BF usually is known for his chicken fried steak. Well he had to work so I made it, never had made it before. This recipe was awesome,now I'm the one who is known for this dish. 
  The only thing I did different was to add chicken broth to the gravy.

My hubby is diabetic, and has to limit his beef intake. My butcher makes pork cutlets for me. Oh my goodness - the pork is great in this recipe. The pork is always tender and tasty as a meat, and the breading knocks it out of the park.

Our family is Gluten Free and it has been YEARS since I've had Chicken Fried Steak.  I decided to try this recipe with Arrowhead Mills GF Flour mix and OH MY WORD it was PERFECT!!!  DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, I also cannot eat potatoes, but I will agree with other reviewers that the gravy NEEDS:  garlic, onion powder, and Tabasco.  With those additions, the whole Chicken Fried Steak experience with this recipe is PHENOMENAL!!  Even my daughter who hates meat asked for seconds!

Excellent! I chopped onion and garlic and sauteed it in the oil for the gravy, added left over flour (about 3 Tablespoons), left over egg/milk mixture (I used 1 tbsp. lemon juice to one cup of half & half) to which I added water, stir until thickened, add kosher salt and pepper to taste. I forgot the Tabasco and didn't add the garlic to the egg/milk mixture.

Coating was awesome. If you run out of buttermilk use fresh milk add a cap full of vinegar and let it set for a few minutes It is a buttermilk substitute.

My husband loved this cfs. He loves cfs and said this was super crunchy and the steak was very moist. I did add season salt and garlic salt with pepper before breading it, i also added a bit of salt and pepper to the flour, i wanted to make sure all layers were seasoned. I made my own sausage gravy to go on top and it was perfect! Definitely a keeper.

I would give the Steak 5 stars and the gravy 2 stars so I settled with 4 since the main dish is the steak.  The gravy was just SO greasy as written.  It tasted just like shortening.  Once I poured over half of it out and started with that as my base adding milk and beef broth, it was great.  There is no need for that much grease.  On the other hand, I am NOT a fan of chicken fried steak, but this was really good.  I had some meat to use up and I will probably go back to this recipe in the future.  Thanks again!

This didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. Chicken Fried Steak is one of my favorite dishes when we eat out. I was hoping to make this dish at home and eat out less, but I don't think that will be the case. Judging from the hundreds of favoritable reviews his recipe has received I believe the fault must lie with me. However, I question the 4cups of milk required to make the gravey this recipe calls for.  My gravey turned out to be more soup than gravey. Is 4 cups and 1/4 cup of flour the correct amounts? Or am I just doomed to never to learn how to make gravey?

Used pork cubed steaks and made a milk gravy. Pretty good. Went well with mashed gold potatoes.

This was pretty good. Next time I'll season the steak before dredging in flour and dipping into the batter. I also dipped it twice in the batter for a thicker crust. I made a sausage gravy for the top. I love the hot chili sauce in the batter, it added excellent flavor!

I've made this 5 times now and it is wonderful. The steak is so tender and the color is beautiful! I follow the recipe exactly but  I season the steaks with Emeril's  original essence before dipping them in flour.

I can imagine how this recipe would be pretty good if you prepared it the right way, but my mom did not so I can't give a completely accurate review. My mom did the flour then the wet ingredients, leaving the outside of the meat wet. She also used more milk in the gravy than she should have, thus it was very runny. The steak resembled a piece of deep fried fish before the gravy was added, and now it's just a giant pile of this gelatinous meat filled grossness. I'll prepare it the proper way and write another review in a couple days. Plus she completely drowned the steak in gravy after it was cooked... ew.

This was the best chicken fried steak I have ever made. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. My gravy didn't happen right because I didn't have enough milk, so I can't wait to try it with the right gravy. I gave it 4 stars because I would like a little more spice, but otherwise this is perfect.

This is a good recipe...I strongly feel that the baking soda and powder are not necessary...I like using 1 cup flour and 1 cup cracker crumbs that are processed in food processor until it resembles flour...and then it is the perfect Chicken fried steak..I also did not use the pepper sauce.....Ohhh so good

My family LOVED this!  I bought beef in bulk and had a bunch of cube steak I didn't know what to make with.  I tried this recipe and everyone can't wait until I make it again!  Only problem was I burnt myself on the hot oil, so make sure you wear oven mitts when flipping the steaks over!

This chicken fried steak was for my husband's birthday and he loved it!  I have never made it before and the directions were really easy to follow.  My only suggestion is to really keep on eye on the steaks when you are frying them, it is easy to get them over-done.  Other than that, I would add more seasoning, but we like a lot of flavor.  Can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was wonderful!  I did opt to lightly salt and pepper the meat before dipping it into the flour and batter and it worked out wonderfully.  I also used Valentina Mexican Hot Sauce for the pepper sauce and it was a hit!  Thanks for the new family favorite!

Before anything else, I'd mention this recipe has the best crust of any I've ever had.  Crunchy, tender steak, and super easy.  I recommend this recipe for the steak 100%  My negatives have more to do with the details: the hot sauce adds nothing in the amount recommended in contrast with the other ingredients.  I add a little paprika and a little more hot sauce.  If you don't want the added spice, there's no reason to add the hot sauce listed in the recipe.  You won't notice it anyway.  I also think the gravy is incredibly bland.  I'd use the chicken friend steak recipe here and find a gravy recipe elsewhere.  So good, though, with minor alterations!!!!

This is the first time I've made chicken fried steak and I'm very pleased, as my husband LOVED it!  He is "beyond" picky so I'm very happy when I find something that he really likes.  

I had 6 cube steaks that made up two pounds and I did pound them very thin, so that may be why I needed to use considerably more flour for the coating.  It seemed that the batter really soaked up the flour and made it necessary to add more.  I did use up almost all the batter to coat the six steaks.

I also used vegetable oil instead of shortening, as that was what I had on hand.  Not one bit of the coating came off.  I think the secret to keeping the coating intact is to use enough oil or shortening and have it at the right temperature, not too hot or too cold.  I used "light" buttermilk, as that was all the store had.  

I don't have a cast iron skillet large enough, so I used my large copper core All-Clad saute pan and it worked just fine.

The Tabasco sauce didn't make it hot, just added a mild "bite", which was offset by the creamy gravy.

This recipe took me longer to put together than anticipated, but it was worth the effort.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a recipe that is likely to please most everyone.  This is a great recipe!

We absolutely loved this! I had given up ever making great chicken fried steak after trying some a local chain restaurant which is to die for. However, this recipe sounded so close to theirs that I tried it. I used milk w/ vinegar in lieu of buttermilk, and omitted the tobasco. I will probably use canola oil next time to cut down the greasiness, but it is absolutely a do-over!

This is really the best chicken-fried steak I've ever had! Golden, crispy, crunchy and delicious, and with 5 minutes on each side it was perfectly well-done in the middle. I served it with J.P.'s Big Daddy biscuits (from this site) with sausage cream gravy and green beans. I used mostly canola oil and some shortning added, and it was perfect! My only complaint is it is a little bland. Next time I will season the meat with salt and pepper as another reviewer has suggested. The next time I fry chicken I will try this wet method, as I have only used the dry method in the past. Thank you for this recipe Norah! You're a genius!

Just made this last night for the family and we all loved it.  I always have trouble with gravy and at first thought, "Oh no here I go again" but I stayed the course and it came out great.  I love CFS and order it at many resturants only to be disapointed.  This recipe turns out the second best CFS I have ever had.  The best is still at a resturant in the El Dorado Casino in Reno, Nv.  I will now try some of the sugestions from other reviews and see if this becomes number one.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This was great, the whole family loved it.  I salt and peppered the steaks before breading which gave it a bit more flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  All the breading came off during during the cooking.  When we sampled the gravy, it had absolutely NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.  We were furiously dumping spices and seasonings to improve it.  Luckily, that worked.  We set the detached breading onto the meat before pouring the gravy and were disappointed again.  It looked scrumptious, but the breading also had NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.  I had, on the recommendation of previous reviews, salted and peppered the meat directly prior to dredging.  I do not understand all the positive reviews for this recipe.  On to the next one; hopefully I'll find a chicken fried steak recipe worth making twice.

The breading on these is wonderful, but the gravy is bland. I'll keep this as my go to breading, but I'll find a more flavorful gravy to pair it with.

Meh...  This was okay.  My husband and son loved it.  The girls and I weren't impressed.  Even with all the pepper and hot sauce, it was still pretty bland to me.  And between the batter and the flour it was a huge mess to make.  I don't mind a mess if the outcome is fantastic, but if it is just okay, it doesn't stay in our rotation.  We'll be looking for another chicken fried steak recipe.

I've gotten a ton of recipes from All Recipes that I've LOVED but I've been guilty of not rating them. This one is the exception. WOW. I've never been this happy with chicken fried steak from any restaurant or home. I made the recipe exactly as is and will continue to do so in the future. THANK YOU!

This was a fantastic recipe!!  I pretty much followed it to the T as I always do the first time around.  Things I will change or be sure to do next time: Season the meat as well, if you get a bite without a lot of batter it is rather bland. Be sure the meat is TOTALLY dry before coating or it won't stick as well. Also, I'm at a slightly higher altitude (Denver area) and I did find that it browned rather quickly in the oil without cooking the meat thoroughly. I pulled it out of the pan once browned and placed in the over for approx. 7 min at 375 degrees and it was perfect. I used buttermilk in the gravy too which I wouldn't necessarily suggest, it made it a little too sweet. All around great recipe though!  Thanks for sharing, I'll deffinitely be making this again.

WOW! I just made this tonight, it was EASY and DELICIOUS! We love having chicken fried steak at truck stops, especially when we travel, but to make it at home and be just as good is awesome! I did leave the Tabasco out, just cause we are not big fans, and I wanted to ensure we tasted the garlic...which we love. The coating made it superb and the flavor was really good. I did salt and pepper the steaks before coating them. I did not make the gravy from the recipe, I used a McCormick mix instead that I know we like. But I will defiantly try it out next time. Highly recommend to anyone who loves this dish...and I served it with mashed potatoes.

This recipe is all that. The only thing I do different is to pound the steak thinner, then I take a knife and score lines into the top so it has that  authentic chx fried steak.

I love steak this way, but had never made it before. I tried this, and messed up the first two steaks(my fault), but the next four came out great.  My wife was on the way to a meeting, and was only going to have a taste, but ended up eating a whole 4 ounce steak.  I will definitely make this again.

Quick and easy to make. Delicious! The 4 1/2 lb steaks were perfect for a family of 5 with leftovers.

Absolutely a Keeper!!!!! This is the best!!! I did use a seasoned pepper instead of plain pepper and in the gravy I added 1/4 onion and 1 chicken bouillon cube and used 2 1/2 cups of low fat milk. It was fabulous!!! This was worth driving to the store for the baking soda and powder because it stayed crispy.

Delicious. I substituted buttermilk for 1 1/2 cups milk with 1 1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar. I let the milk and vinegar sit for 10 minutes and voila, a substitute for buttermilk.  This was fantastic!

Great Recipe! My husband loves cornflakes in the breading so the only thing I changed was instead of 2 cups of flour I had 1 cup flour and 1 cup crushed cornflakes.

I am not southern and not very familiar with this dish, but this recipe was easy and so delicious! I used vegetable oil instead of shortening and it tasted wonderful. I also added a little cayenne pepper to the sauce for a little kick. Overall, an impressive yet easy recipe!

This recipe is seriously fantastic. I make it all the time, and call it "Country fried steak" when I make it. lol. The only thing I do that isn't mentioned, is hit it with some kosher salt when it comes out of the pan.

Yum!  I found 6 frozen cube steaks at our local Grocery Outlet for less than $4.  They were perfect for this recipe.  Followed the directions except went a little light on the hot sauce.  Our entire family loved it.  They only suggested that I use garlic in the gravy.  Will do that next time, and there WILL be a next time!  Thanks smylpurty for a great recipe!

I thought the flavor of this was pretty good. The gravy was very good. It didn't turn out perfect but it's worth trying again. I would prefer that the coating on the steaks were a little crunchier, so, next time I make it,  I think I'll use panko crumbs.

Absolutely delicious and easy. My family loves cfs and are picky eaters. They could not stop raving about this...it was a big hit at my house...will definitely use it again. The only thing I did differently was to put seasonings in flour instead of in egg mixture. Also, next time I think I will season raw steaks with a little salt and pepper.

We prepared this Chicken Fried Steak tonight. Being a Texan, trust me I know a thing or two about Chicken Fried Steak, and this was absolutely one of the best I have ever eaten!  Couple things to note... - To get a little more flavor, season the bare meat with some salt and pepper before flouring and dredging it.  - We found medium-low heat to be just about perfect for cooking. Let each side cook roughly 5 minutes and the steak was cooked perfectly. But I think even without that stuff, this recipe is fantastic! Good luck, and enjoy it!

This recipe is great!  I left out the tabasco and added a lot of Lawry's salt for flavor.  The coating turned out wonderful.  I did have to do the same thing as a previous poster and finish it off in the oven.  My coating was perfect but the meat wasn't cooked.  The gravy was a touch bland so I added more Lawry's salt and pepper to it.

Spectacular flavor!  The most wonderful home-made CFS we've ever had!  Added garlic powder to the flour instead of adding minced garlic to milk.  Important to let the first dip of flour sit for 15 minutes before dipping in egg and flour.    4 cups of milk is too much; gravy was thin.  Used 1/2 cup seasoned flour and 1/2 cup of used oil and consistency was perfect.  Definite keeper!

Very good crust. I pounded the round steak very thin so it would cook quicker. Didn't use as much oil as called for, so I turned the meat one time. Maybe I didn't have enough meat, but I had way too much milk batter and flour left over. I sifted the leftover flour into the oil for the gravy. Since it was already somewhat seasoned, I used less seasoning in the actual gravy. Will make again.

This was a great recipe!  The coating did not come off like other methods I have tried.  I did not have buttermilk so I used 2% milk and it turned out fine.  I didn't salt the meat before I dredged it in the flour but I will next time...  Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out great! I love this meal in restaurants, but I've never ventured to make chicken fried steak myself before. The breading came out terrific and the flavor was awesome! I didn't use tobasco, but I did put chili powder in both the milk wash and the flour mix--I also used a lot more spices (like double, at least). I loved the tips about letting the battered meat "rest" before cooking, as it really did insure that the breading stuck. I bought round steak and had the butcher run it thru the tenderizer (cheaper thn buying the cube steak) and then I tenderized it a bit more before breading it. I cheated a little by using store-bought country gravy mix, but I did add some of the milk & flour mixtures when cooking it to increase the amount.  Hubby said to add this to the list of "regulars" so that means it's a winner!

This was a really good recipe.  I didn't add as much Tabasco sauce.  Couldn't really picture that much in the mixture.  So I just added a few splashes.  I also added a little bit of coarse ground black pepper to my flour mixture, just to season the flour a little bit.

This was a FLOP!! It made my meat want to fall apart that I could barely get it turned over to the other side for it to cook. I think I will stick to just making my cubed steak with just breaded flour!

I gave this a 4-Star rating because of the use of the cube steak..and the ingredients..I read the other Chicken Fried Steak-recipes and thought that they were not as good(looking)..I tried to make this recipe from just hearing its title-name/and mine came out quite weird looking/will try this recipe..thanks.

This recipe was great. I will use it from now on. I added more seasonings to the buttermilk mixture because we like more flavor. I used the rest of the buttermilk to make buscuits from this site. Thanks!!

Fantastic.  The crust was perfect  - not too tough like I've had in some recipes.  Follow the advice of other reviewers - be sure to put your seasoning on the meat before you batter, and let sit a few minutes between battering and frying.  Some reviewers mentioned putting some chicken bullion into the gravy.  I thought I made the best cream gravy, but I've been educated now. I put some chicken 'better than bullion' paste when I was browning the flour and grease, and it was wonderful.

My steak was was too thin but there were no leftovers!!! It was delicious. It will be even better next time. I also wasnt as neat as their cook. My brother thought it was perfect as leftovers for sliders on the Hawaiian sweet rolls. By leftovers he means while I was doing dishes because they never made it to frig to be leftover.

This was really good!  The directions were clear. The crust on the steaks turned out nice and crispy and the steaks were done perfectly at 3 1/2 min per side.   Sour cream was used in place of the buttermilk (3/4 c sour cream + 1/4 c water for each cup of buttermilk).  That batter really does the trick!    Next time I might kick the spices up a little and use butter instead of the leftover oil for the gravy.  Thank you for sharing!
By special request for my son’s birthday, I made this again.  The hot sauce and garlic were doubled and buttermilk was used this time in the breading.  When the steaks came out of the fry oil, they were dusted on both sides with salt & pepper.  For the gravy, all the oil was poured off, saving the crusty bits in the pan and then a 1/4 c salted butter was substituted in place of the reserved oil.  Once the gravy was mostly done,  garlic and several good shakes of hot sauce were added with the salt and pepper.  Yummy!  This recipe is an excellent starting point and you can be flexible with the spices, adjusting it to your taste.

We absolutely loved this recipe. The breading was crisp and flavorful, the cube steak was tender and juicy. The gravy made from the drippings was also very good. My husband went back for seconds, then thirds! He was miserably stuffed, but just couldn't help himself.

Great recipe. This is a meal I've always attempted in nearly every coffee house I've been in within CA. I say attempted, bc either the meat fell short, but normally it was the gravy. Why they think using "canned" gravy is a good idea, is beyond me. Any cook familiar with making gravy, can taste immediately, the "canned" taste. This reminded me, once again of the value of knowing how to make a great dish & spotting the fakes. Thank you for sharing. This is on permanent rotation.

I am trying to go gluten free and I have not had chicken fried steak in a very long time. I followed recipe exactly, except I substituted gluten free flour blend. It came out great. I did not tell my husband or father and they asked for seconds. I made milk gravy with the GF flour and it was also good. I added a little cornstarch to help thicken it and used the drippings from the steaks.

Loved this recipe, especially since I had never made it before.  A bit messy, but it turned out great, especially the gravy.  I had one neighbor comment that the gravy was better than any his wife had ever made and the wife commented that it was the best meal I had ever served, and I serve a lot of them!  Paired it with my own mashed potato recipe, a broccoli casserole and jalapeño corn muffins, recipes which I found here.

Made it.  Loved it.  Husband loved it.  I can't even count the number of times I've attempted Chicken Fried Steak only to be disappointed -- other recipes weren't awful, just not perfect.  I've saved THIS recipe in every single place I could think -- plus hand copied it (twice) just in case the computer world breaks down.  I will never even bother looking at another one.  I've even prepared with elk steak (something I'm still getting used to) and it was amazing as well.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was a really good recipe.  I cut the amount of gravy down as we didn't need that much.  But made to directions.....except for the buttermilk. I had to substitute...wonderful.

Wow was this good! it was perfect and crispy. I double coated before placing in the pan. My husband always gives me raft for putting too much pepper in the dishes I make, so I didn't do that with the gravy and it was tasteless because of it. This recipe makes GREAT left overs. When I heated the gravy the next morning I added salt and pepper and it was perfect.

I have to say I'm usually very good at following recipes..but I just tried this and it did NOT work for me. What am I doing wrong?! I felt I followed the directions to the T..used all the right ingredients..but the meat did not cook. I tried cutting into it and it was nowhere near to being edible. The breading was completely done, there was no way I could have cooked it any longer. Someone please help lol :(

I made this exactly how the recipe was written. There was NO WAY enough salt. It was very very bland. The breading was excellent but had almost no flavor at all. Very disappointed. The family liked it and so did I but I would have to work on the seasoning before serving it again. Also, the gravy was grainy and awful. I wouldn't make the gravy using pan drippings and just oil again. It was kind of gross to me, not smooth at all.

I'm so glad that I tried this recipe for my first time using cubed steak! It was so tender and crispy! I will ramp up the seasonings as we can take a higher spice level..maybe salt, pepper, and cayenne on the meat before dredging with the flour mixture. Hubby and I felt that the fried steak would make an awesome sandwich...probably a great addition to a BLT!

I really had high hopes for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the suggestion of seasoning the meat before battering, and it turned out horribly. Like other reviewers, this batter was too thick. When I fried it, the batter came off. The gravy tasted like flour and milk. The meat had no flavor, all I could tase was grease. Just not good. I didnt even serve it to my family.

Wow! So good! I was really nervous to try this as I had never made chicken fried anything before, but it turned out exceptionally well! We got some axis (deer) cutlets from a friend and he suggested we "chicken fry" them. I am so glad we did. I prepared them just like the recipe states and there wasn't even a "gamey" flavor to them. Thanks for this winner recipe!!

This was a wonderful recipe for chicken fried steak.  Flavors were amazing. I did not have shortening or buttermilk on hand, so I substituted canola oil and 2% milk.  They worked out just fine.  The steak is best cooked in the cast iron skillet as recommended in the recipe as it cooks evenly and you have no problems with the steak sticking to the pan as long as you do not cook on too high a heat.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  Family loved it and I will be making it again!

I've never reviewed any recipe before, but this was awesome! The coating was light and crispy, very flavorful.  Also, I had to use the buttermilk substitute that another reviewer posted, and it turned out fine.  I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the great recipe.

This recipe is the best I've ever tried. The only thing I did different was sprinkle abit of montreal seasoning on one side of the meat and pat it into just one side before flouring etc. My husband said this recipe was the best I've ever made.  A keeper for sure.

The steak was amazing, I did not care much for the gravy so the second time I made it I just left that out and enjoyed it all over again.

This is truly a wonderful recipe! The coating was fantastic! I did marinate my cube steaks in the buttermilk for a couple of hours then after I breaded them i set them in the fridge for about 30min super crispy and did I mention Sooooo Delicious!!!

My hubby LOVES this recipe. It is our go-to for chicken fried steak, fried gizzards, and fried pork sandwiches (delish). 5 stars as written IMO. Excellent recipe thank you SO much!

My first time deep frying! Easier than I expected though I wish it wasn't so darn caloric! Followed the recipe exactly except used canola oil for frying. Served with mashed potatoes, corn and Hawaiian sweet rolls.

I have tried this several times now and each time I swear it's better than the time before! I have made chicken fried steaks all of my life and have never mastered the recipe, until I tried this one.It is fork tender, so unbelieveably flavorful, and it really doesn't even need gravy, but it is a welcome addition. Fabulous recipe and a favorite of ours, eaten weekly at my house.

Tried this for dinner tonight and it was amazing. I've always enjoyed chicken fried steak, but this recipe was so much better. Although I did use vegetable oil instead of the shortening it called for. Still came out great.

Thanks for a great recipe!  The baking powder and soda were an interesting addition.  I'm glad I seasoned the round steak prior to breading it.  I only had enough milk for my mashed potatoes and 1/2 batch of gravy so I used water instead of buttermilk, with the egg, and it still turned out perfect.

Amazing. Simply the best fried steak I have ever made. My mother in law was raised on a farm by a woman who refused to cook on anything other than a wood stove until she died in the 80s. So she knows good home cooking. When she ate this, she loved it. DON'T cut the hot sauce. It is what makes it so glorious. I have made it with 2% before and it turned out well...I could tell no difference, but if I ever cut the hot sauce it is not nearly as good. I also don't make the gravy as directed. I find it has better flavor is I use a cream gravy mix in place of the flour. We use reserve tobasco, which has a smoother flavor.

Messy prep but sooo worth it!  I used chicken and the chicken mcnugget princess said she loved it and wants this for now on instead of nuggets.
That speaks volumes as to how awesome this recipe is!  Our new favorite for sure!  Thank you for sharing this one :)

As always, skillet chicken fried steak is a lot of work but it was a good recipe!!  I never have buttermilk and always to the 1 tbls of white vinegar and fill the rest of the 1 cup up with milk...and I had more than half of the 'buttermilk' left over.  I absolutely hate getting my cast iron skillet out since you don't have the convenience of throwing it in the dishwasher to wash afterward:)  I ran out of all purpose flour (didn't even have enough for batter so just put in some panko bread crumbs to finish the 2 cups) but did have a packet of dry brown gravy so I prepared that using the 'scraps' left in the pan.  I've been told by my husband it is the best recipe for chicken fried steak we have tried so far so I will be keeping the recipe!!  And since I re-seasoned my pan with shortening in the oven, the cleanup wasn't that bad!!

First of all, the meat really needs seasoning. I didn't, and the steak was incredibly bland. Also added more garlic to the gravy for extra flavor. it all turned out ok but there are several things I will do differently next time, including pounding my cube steaks. Thanks anyway.

This is my go-to recipe for Chicken Fried Steak.  I made it for my nieces boyfriend who is a chef and he raved about it.  Even my picky eater loves "the crunchy steak" and will eat a whole one.

I found some powered buttermilk at the store and tried it.  You just mix it with water (or canned milk) and it worked great.  

Thanks

Really an en excellent recipe! It was a "feel good" comfort food that evoked a lot of great memories for my wife and I and our time in Oklahoma. I agree with one of the other reviewers that salt and peppering the meat first may enhance the flavor. This was a big hit tonight at our house and fun to make. I highly recommend it served with mashed potatoes and a veggie on the side. This is the chicken fried steak recipe I will use from now on. After I was through I put some red pepper and a little sugar in the batter and fried up some flattened chicken breast for spicy chicken sandwiches and they were really great.

I'll keep this review straight to the point.  This was AMAZING and simple.  I've been making chicken fried steak for years and it has always been mediocre.  Well not anymore.  The hot sauce and garlic give it a kick and the gravy is incredibly easy to make and can be seasoned up however you feel fit.  I personally always add a teaspoon of my better than boullion base to my sauces.  Just my preference.

So yummy! I followed the directions exactly, other than seasoning the cube steaks before dredging in flour. The flavor of both the Chicken Fried Steaks and the gravy were right on for my family. I was hesitant to use the Tabasco in the batter, but I'm glad I did. It's not enough to add heat (my kids would not eat it if it were spicy), just flavor. I do think that the recipe takes quite a bit longer than 40 minutes, but I cooked 6 steaks, mashed potatoes, gravy and corn on the cob in about an hour and a half. This is an occasional indulgence for us, and I will definitely use this recipe again next time! Thanks Norah!!!

Absolutely fantastic. Made a chicken gravy to go with. Excellent!!

I agree with another reviewer, you need to season the meat with S & P before the first dredge in flour.

The texture of the breading was spot on, but even though I tweaked it and added spices, it was so bland.

I used Gluten Free flour and left out the hot sauce.  I bought the powered buttermilk that someone mentioned here and added it to the dry ingredients first before adding the liquid portion of the batter.  This recipe was enough to make 6 large cubed steaks (3-4 lb. total) and still had batter left over.  The coating came off the first steak; possibly didn't have the oil heated high enough.  The rest of the steaks came out perfectly with a nice thick crust. I had never used baking soda & powder and the double dip method to fry foods before. Tasted just as good as restaurant versions I've order. The gravy came out perfect too.

Well done.  This recipe works as advertised and is simple, yet satisfying.  I shall make this again soon.  Also, this method works well for chicken tenders.

This was my first attempt at making Chicken Fried Steak and I must say this one is a keeper!!!  The recipe was flawless and it was very simple.  The only change I would make is seasoning the steak first.  Also, I used vegetable oil vs shortening and it was still delightful.  I made a brown gravy with the drippings.  My family really enjoyed it!

It was my first time making chicken fried steak and it came out wonderful! My husband and I both really loved this! Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Didn't have buttermilk on hand so combined milk and some vinegar, and let it set for about 10 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe!

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a CFS recipe that was a little different than the several ones I have used so far- one that made a nice crunchy breading of moderate thickness. Most breadings were too eggy, too soft, too thin to stay on or too thick...this was just right. The result was more like what you would get at a restaurant.I used a deep fryer so I did not make this gravy recipe but mine is similar, I just substituted bacon grease for the pan drippings. However, this CFS  was good enough by itself. The breading gave it a very good flavor.

I've tried a few different chicken fried steak recipes and this one is a winner! My family gobbled it up. The buttermilk is what really made the difference, it might be fatty but it makes the batter fabulous. Thanks for sharing this one!

I made this last night for hubby and a colleague of his. It was fantastic! Being from the south, I've made a lot of this dish and tasted a lot of others...this recipe takes the cake!! It was a huge hit last night. Served with fresh fried okra, homemade ranch dressing, mashed potatoes, and sweet corn bread muffins. (and of course gravy)

This was good, not great.
I made exactly as written for the first 2 steaks, then added a little garlic and onion powder onto the last two steaks, but the difference was hardley noticable. I was a little worried about the gravy and almost didn't make it but i am glad i did it really made the meal, i just added a ton of pepper and salt, (i don't like pepper at all but I do admit that it was good in this meal, but i still wont put it on my eggs!)
I am not sure it i will make this again.

This recipe may be a little TOO good. I just had to thaw out some cube steaks in the microwave and make this for myself at 10PM because I had a craving and nothing else sounded nearly as satisfying for my late dinner. This always comes out perfect -- steaks are flavorful, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The only changes I make to this are to use garlic powder instead of minced garlic, double the Tabasco sauce in the batter, and lightly season the steaks with salt and pepper after frying them. Thank you for posting this; it's the only recipe I'll use for chicken-fried steak from now on.

Oh, my!!!  I have gotten many great recipes from this site, and this rates more than 5 stars!!  
Left out the hot sauce, seasoned the dredging flour with Roast Beef Seasoning and fresh ground black pepper.  Didn't have buttermilk-never gets used fast enough.  So..........I borrowed another cook's hint for a substitute and whisked together 2% milk and cream of tartar.  Let it sit for about 10 minutes, whisked again, and viola!!!  Buttermilk!
My husband goes bananas over chicken fried steak, and I think I would have a mutiny on my hands if I made it any other way, after tonight!!
When I asked on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being "ewwwww! and 10 being "I would eat the leftovers for breakfast in the morning"  He says "You kidding?  I'm gonna eat the leftovers cold later for a midnight snack".  I think he liked it!  Thank you so much for sharing this one with us, Norah!  "You done good!!!"

This is, bar none, the best chicken fried steak recipe I've ever used.  I'm not sure if it's the baking powder/soda or what, but the batter was crispy and didn't fall off the steak.  The taste was amazing!

I love chicken fried steak and I have had a lot of it. Over the years I have tried many recipes that have claimed to be "The Best". I don't know if this recipe is "The Best", but it is way high on the list. It is easy, extremely flavorful and the crust is great. The only changes that I made was just add 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper  to the dry mix and I also seasoned the meat before dredging. It was awesome!

Wonderful chicken fried steak. followed the recipe (using substitute buttermilk) and the steak turned out light and crispy. Don't like my chicken fried steak to have real thick breading, this was perfect.

This was delicious!  Just what I was looking for.  Used regular milk and it was fine.  Make my gravy a little differently (like the one on a creamed chip beef package and then add crumbled pork sausage).  Chicken was tender and juicy inside.  Thank you for posting!

This is better than any restaurant chicken fried steak. I used the remaining milk mixture and added fresh milk to it for the gravy and it was the best gravy ever. I only used 1/8 C flour and 2C milk total for the gravy and there was plenty. I will definately make this for my family again! It's a once in a while dish though as we only eat fried food once or twice a month.

This was the BEST batter recipe I have tried yet!!  The baking powder/soda with buttermilk (I used lemon juice with milk sub) is great.  Most recipes are just a egg wash and this worked MUCH better.  It didn't slide right off the steak once fried either!

This was okay, but the crispy coating was bland.  Next time I would season the flour mixture too with salt and pepper, at least.

Messy, & the "chicken-fried steak" look didn't come out the way I expected it. Not an easy recipe to follow. Also, whether or not it's supposed to be "inherent" within the cook to know this, you should still put in the recipe to SEASON the steak before cooking it for the "ignorant."

This recipe was AWESOME!! Thank you so much for sharing.
I didn't change a thing aside from frying the steaks in canola oil (cuz it's what I had on hand) and the results were flavorful, crispy and delicious. Best breading EVER! Can't wait to try it on chicken as well. 
I added just a touch of garlic powder and a "glug" of hot sauce to the gravy and it was delish although I'm sure it would be great as written.
Thanks again for a wonderful recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it lower calorie by using egg beaters and almond milk.  I think I'll use a little vinegar next time to emulate the buttermilk tang.  I'm going to try baking it next time as well!  The baking soda and powder really made a difference in the batter.  Genius!

I used this recipe to make 8 steaks, and only used 3/4 cup buttermilk (had lots of flour and liquid left over).  I thought it was a little bland, but it turned out well (nice breading, cooked through, etc).  My husband, who is a Chicken fried steak eater, said it was far better than any restaurant.  So overall very pleased.

This was great!! I have always loved Chicken Fried Steak, I've tried making it numerous times and could never get it right....this was perfect.  My family really enjoyed it, even  my little picky eaters who are 2 and 1 scarfed it down.  Of course, I do wish there were healthier ways to make it..we probably won't be eating it weekly, but will definitely pop up here and there.....Thanks! This was really delicious!

Very tasty! My boyfriend and daughter really enjoyed these. I only gave it four stars bc the gravy didn't turn out quite right. It tasted too oily so I used chicken gravy instead. But the crispiness of the outside was sooo good. I will def make this again! Thanks for the recipe!!

I was skeptical when trying this but it turned out great! It was easy to make. I have an electric stove; the key was to not allow your grease to get too hot! I kept mine on medium heat to allow the meat to cook throughly. The breading was crispy and tasted just like the restuarants. Two lbs of meat was too much= to 6 steaks (we only needed 4) and when you tenderize the meat to 1/4" the steaks are huge; enough for 2 people. Next time I will only make 2 steaks and half the recipe. I was not comfortable making the gravy from this recipe since it did not give an exact amount of flour so I used a country gravy also found on this site

Are you a beginner cook like me?  Well you CAN do this recipe!  I did the entire recipe except I used canned gravy and it was fantastic!  I didn't have a cast iron skillet & it was still great.  I used the buttermilk substitute listed in the first review & couldn't tell the difference.  I paired it up with these biscuits:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/cheddar-bay-biscuits/Detail.aspx and my husband & daughter raved at how much I've improved in cooking since finding allrecipes.com

I think we couldn't get over the fact we were using shortening.  It had a shortening taste and we couldn't get it out of our minds the increase in cholesterol.  Be careful when frying....it splatteres when flipping.  I used powdered buttermilk.  When halfing this recipe remember to half the oil amount or the gravy will not thicken.  It won't half the oil amount in the text below the ingredients.  I'll look for a recipe with canola oil next time.

There are some slight improvements needed, but I chose to still rate this recipe 5 stars because the breading is restaurant perfect. I seasoned the meat before the breading otherwise it would have been bland. Also I would make far less gravy next time and maybe use my own recipe.

Great recipe! I had no buttermilk, and tough to find substitute. Finally found suggestion for half milk - half plain yogurt; let sit for 10 minutes. Turned out well, husband said he likes this version better than others tried in past. Will be making this again. Thanks.

The only thing different that I did was that I didnt make the gravy from the drippings.  Husband had his heart set on sawmill gravy, so we whipped some up.  Awesome 5 star recipe!  We will definitely be making this again!

First written review on this site.  All I can say is yummy, yummy, yummy!!  I order chicken fried steak whenever I have the chance.  I have had it from coast to coast, in multiple states and THIS recipe is amazing!!  Once I saw the buttermilk batter start to turn fluffy, I knew it was the recipe for me!!  I am a sucker for sausage gravy on this so I added some sausage to the gravy.  Oh, by the way, the family loved it too LOL!!

The outside was really greesy but the meat was good!! My 4 yr old like his cut into little pieces then battered and fried and his didnt turn out so greesy. I think I will try this again but alter the amount of greese used.

Very delicious! The taste was great and not overwhelming. Put a piece of plastic wrap over the steak when you pound it out; it helps things stay neater and off your clothes.

I am no expert on southern cooking but this was a waste of ingredients! No flavor!  The gravy is like eating greasy paste. If this was the best, I eat take out!

Not bad but could use a bit more seasning!  This was my first attempt at frying food, texture came out great.  TIP: If you don't have a thermometer, scrunch up a piece of white bread into a 1" cube, toss it into the oil and when it takes about 60 secs to brown, then the oil is ready.  I read that online, worked great for me, my steaks cooked in 4 min each.

I cannot praise this recipe enough! It has become a staple in our household. My husband practically cries tears of joy whenever I make it for dinner, and my stepson took one bite of it and proclaimed, "OH MY GOD, you need to start a restaurant!" This is also a very economical recipe. All of the ingredients I usually have on hand in the pantry, and cube steaks are amazingly cheap, less than $5 to feed myself and two hungry men! I also fix the buttermilk situation by adding 1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar to 1 1/2 cups milk. Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. Thank you for sharing, Norah!

Perfect recipe.  I used 1/2 cup of buttermilk as one and a half seemed a bit much and I make my own.  Didn't want to waste.  I also drained the oil out of the frying pan and used just fresh flour to retain that white gravy color. Breading on chicken fried steak should be like an entity to itself with a different texture and flavor than the steak it houses.  This hit the mark.  The tabasco added a tang that I enjoyed and fresh garlic is always welcome in my home. A tip, when flouring the meat, take the time to work it into the pores of the meat by pressing down on it before you fry and you will keep your breading.  Also, use hot oil on medium or the flour will soak it up and the steaks will be soggy. I made CFS for a living when I was a teenager, and this is the best recipe I have seen in 15 years.

Good stuff. I love chicken fried steak but have never dared to make it on my own. I substituted whole milk for the buttermilk. My result was pretty good, maybe a bit bland. I am a beginner when it comes to making sauces and gravies. Maybe I used too much flour in the making of the gravy. That may have contributed to the blander taste. However, I will keep trying this recipe until I've got it right. Thanx!!

I grew up in Texas, where we knew our way around a chicken fried steak. I never had the temerity to cook one, but I sure knew a good one when I found it.   My nephew is a displaced Californian, whose every other word is "upscale", "fine dining" "balsamic vinegar", "Havarti cheese" and other assorted trendy catchphrases.  My husband is a former hippy vegan from Oregon.  Neither of them ever liked good Southern style cooking; they always had a criticism of anything I ever cooked besides chicken stirfry.   So imagine my surprise when they clamored that this was one of the best meals they had ever eaten and demanded more!  I think this is the only meal where either ever liked a fried food with a crust.  This one is tender and delicious beyond words and I am so grateful for having found it ! I serve it with homemade mashed potatoes, asparagus, biscuits and a local white pepper gravy mix because i deep fry it rather than pan fry.

this is the best recipe for chicken fried steak I've ever used, hubby said it was just as good as Cracker Barrels.  I was a little leary of adding the baking powder and spices to the buttermilk because I've always added it to the flour but it was great! I didn't use all the hot sauce for fear it would be too spicy but next time I will. this is now my go to for Chicken fried steak...thanks for posting!

This was okay. My main problem was I thought there was too much breading. Egg wash was good. Next time I make this I will just egg wash it,  bread it once and cook it. I would like to try this recipe with pork cutlets and pounded chicken breasts.

I've never in my life had chicken fried steak so when my husband asked me to make this for dinner, I was worried. Luckily this recipe turned out amazing! First time making it and first time eating it and it was delicious. I read a lot of the reviews first, because it really does help, and I did a few things differently. I seasoned the steaks with salt and pepper beforehand, I added garlic powder and black pepper to the four mixture, and I seasoned the gravey with pepper, garlic powder, and a dash or two of the hot pepper sauce. Turned out wonderful!

ow! This is quite yummy. I followed the recipe except I added Mrs. Dash's Onion/Herb and Garlic/Herb and then also some salt-free Seasonal-all to the flour. Much tastier! I am also not a 'deep-fry' cook. It just goes against every being in me, so I used 1/2 a cup of canola/olive oil in my frying pan. Cooked for 6 minutes on each side. YUM!W

It really is the best CFS I've had.  My son wanted CFS for his birthday dinner and I took a chance with this one.  I'm so glad I did!  The only change I made was I used vegetable oil to fry instead of shortening.  The crust didn't flake off at all - it was a big hit!

AWESOME!!  I used chicken and made strips instead. This was wonderful to make chicken fried chicken strips with. The flavor was great but it was the crunch of the coating that really sold it. I can not recommend enough. Can't wait to try on steak.

This recipe was great and I used the tip from someone else to use 1 tbsp. of white vinegar to milk and let it sit for 10 minutes instead of buttermilk.  Also it says to mix in remaining flour which I did and the gravy was too thick and I had to pour in more milk.  I would slowly add the flour into the hot oil and add just enough to use all of the oil without it getting too thick then pour the milk.  These were outstanding and will make again!

I used the 'make your own buttermilk' trick and I don't think it worked for me.  The steaks tasted like the flour wasn't cooked enough (although the meat was done), and they seemed quite greasy. I didn't have vegetable shortening and just used canola oil.  I would try them again with real buttermilk and I would let them drip dry on a rack so they aren't so greasy.  Also the gravy wasn't so great, needs work.

The batter is way to heavy and greasy. Not much flavour either. Tenderized Steak is a way tastier just dipped in egg/milk mixture and then bread crumbs. Sorry maybe I did something wrong but won't be making again.

This is THE best chicken fried steak! My husband has told me NOT to try any other recipe because he absolutely loves this one! I didn't change anything to this recipe, at first I was sceptical because of everything it calls for but I tell you what....it make a BIG difference. Everyone must try this recipe!

the title doesn't lie!! Its simple and inexpensive.  I recommend using Frank's Red Hot and at least a half teaspoon to double the amount.  Regular milk can be substituted, I prefer the buttermilk!

Wow, this was great.  I used the milk/vinegar combination suggested by another reviewer and it was great, pretty easy.  The breading is a great flavor and consistency, not greasy at all.  Loved the gravy, I just cut the milk back to 2 1/2 cups, since there were only two of us dining.  Great consistency, creamy, thickened up really well as it simmered.

This was alright but surprisingly my husband didn't like this dish. Chicken Fried Steak is one of his all time favorites, but I struck out on this one. I don't know whether it was the recipe or maybe I just had an off day cooking. I thought it was  good although not my favorite. I think the tabasco threw him off as it gave this a spicy taste but not quite like his favorite cajun place serves (which is what I was hoping to duplicate). He asked me not to make this one again. :( Thanks anyway, it was still fun making a new dish.

I made this tonite for dinner, and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly, well except I used regular milk instead of buttermilk, because I didnt have any. The coating turned out perfect, nice and crisp and golden brown.  And I didnt have any problems with it falling off of the steak.  The gravy turned out great too, and Im the worlds worst gravy maker, lol.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was that I thought it was a little bland.  I will definately make this again, but next time I will spice it up a little more.

The gravy was definitely 5 stars!  However, I used oil rather than Crisco and found the steak to be flavorless and the coating soggy.  I did not get the crisp effect I do with my usual chicken fried chicken recipe.  I wouldn't make this recipe again, apart from the gravy.  The steak was a 1 star recipe, but since I used oil and the gravy was so good I went with a 3 star review.

as far as chicken fried steak goes, this batter is too heavy.  You can even see in the picture that it is heavy batter.  The gravy is pretty good.  Got a huge thumbs down from my chicken fried steak fans.  I will continue looking and yes, I am very good at frying chicken but this recipe misses in a lot of places

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Let me just say that I am a southern girl married to a northern guy.  He absolutely loves my southern cooking, but ironicly his favorite dish is chicken fried steak and that's the one thing that I could never get right. He orders chicken fried steak at every restaurant that has it on the menu (I wish I were joking) so you could say he is a qualifies critic.  He had a hard week last week so I decided to give this dish another go.  I used this recipe and he said hands down it was the best he's EVER had!  Don't change a thing about this recipe!

This was a big hit for my family.  I followed the directions exactly and it was very, very tasty.  My wife ended up making the best gravy out of the drippings as directed.  Something about using buttermilk verses regular milk makes it very yummy.

Great recipe.  My husband raved about it hours after eating it.  I added about 5 dashes of Tabasco to the gravy to give it the extra kick that it needed.. and it says season to taste with salt and pepper.. so if yours was bland add more seasonings.. I used about 2 - 3 tsp salt and added about 1 tsp of pepper in addition to the tabasco in the gravy.  It turned out great !! The cast iron skillet is a great tool for this -- Lodge makes a great one around 35 (for large 12 inch size)  Another tip: I used the buttermilk -- the coating got gloppy and next time I will layer the steaks with sheets of wax paper between so the coating does not stick to other steaks as you stack them before frying!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Followed the recipe and frying instructions with no deviations for absolutely the crunchiest, light chicken fried steak we have ever had. Keep the thermometer in the hot shortening while frying. After placing the meat in the high-sided castiron skillet, I noticed the temperature drop 25 degrees. I simply adjusted the flame on the stove. Personal preference only: next time I will add salt to the flour also. My husband and I thank you, Smylpurty!

I cannot fry things. At all. I broke out the cast iron pan and decided I just HAVE to learn how to successfully fry something and figured it doesn't get much more classic than this. It was a success! The outside was crispy and the meat was tender! My dinner companions were shocked. Thanks for this great recipe!

Best batter ever.  Stayed on steaks.  Tasted fab.  Followed coating recipe and gravy recipe as written except just used a couple dashes tabasco bc nervous for kids.  Used "mock chicken fried steak" from this site for meat.  Eliminates the chewiness of cube steak.  Outstanding.

YUMMY!!  Very good, I added Lawrys seasoning to my dry mix.  Gravy turned out great....I like my gravy thicker so I didnt use 4 cups of milk.  This was my first time making Chicken fried steak...reminds me alot of my grandmas.  Easy, yummy and filling!

This is the best chicken fried steak! We loved it, the only change we made was to cut the steaks into strips and fried them that way (you get more of the good crust that way)

The meat needed lots of seasoning, i think frying it in vegie shortening is not something i would ever have to do again. the shortening flavor stayed with it a little to much for my liking. Thanks for sharing though

Five stars are not enough.  Couple of subs. I never stock buttermilk so used the  standard mix of 1T clear vinegar to 1 cup of milk, let rest 5 mins and voila,  buttermilk, or a very close substitute.  And used peanut oil rather than  shortening. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh lima beans (Easy Lima Beans  this site).  Down home Dixie superb!  And like everything this delicious, very fattening.  Who cares?  Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we diet.  Thanks, so much, smylpurty

This recipe has a lot of potential, but it really needs more seasoning. We used more than the original recipe called for and still though it could have used more. Nice start, though. Thanks!   Addition: We made this another night and the key is double breading and loads of seasoning in both the batter and flour mixture. Tasted a lot like my favorite chipotle fried chicken!

Very greasy and the coating cracked & crumbled and fell off the steak (due to the baking powder & baking soda?). The tabasco didn't really provide any extra flavor or zing.  I have other chicken fried steak recipes we like much better.  Will not bother with this one again.

This was a bit salty...I should have known to decrease the salt, but didn't.  I mixed the buttermilk and hot sauce this morning, put my cube steak in and put in fridge for the day.  CFS was super tender and fell apart.  Hubs could cut it with a fork....that is surprising....I didn't do the garlic bit either.....Like the overall concept of flour, and the baking powder and soda though.

My first time ever making chicken fried steak and it turned out very well with this recipe.  I used round steak and seasoned it as others suggested.  I made 12 pieces of steak so I increased the amount of seasoning but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Thank you!

My husband was very excited to try this recipe.  While the breading was very good, it tasted very greasy to me.  My husband was a little disappointed.  I will give it three stars because I want to try making it one more time.

The breading was great, but I halved the hot sauce and I wouldn't want it any hotter. This gets 4* because 4 cups of milk was too much for the gravy.

Wow!  I have tried chicken fried steak recipes and the coating just won't stay on.  NOT a problem with this recipe!  My husband loved it and ate the leftovers all week!  Definitely a keeper for this southern-fried cook!

One of the best recipes for country or chicken fried steak I have tried. I added about a 1/4 cup of beef broth to the gravy for more flavor, as well as about a teaspoon of garlic powder. Excelllent!

This was the second time I attempted to cook CFS and this blew the first recipe I used (also from this site) out of the water. I will not try any others as this was, as the title states 'The Best'. Easy and delicious!! Cooked exactly as written.

this is the first time i've ever made chicken fried steak and it was wonderful.  i used top sirloin steak since this is all i had and i beat it til it was really thin.  i added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley to the flour mixture.  i had a lot of flour left so this is the flour that i used to make the gravy.  added a little bit of sugar to the gravy also.  served it with mashed potato's with the skins still on, corn, and cole slaw.  will make again!!

I always follow the recipe exactly the first time and adjust it as needed second time around.  This one was way too greasy. I'm thinking if I make it again I'll use vegetable oil instead.  I never fry my chicken in shortening anyway and should  have trusted my instinct. However, the breading was really good and I would not change that.

Excellent! I made this for some Canadian friends who had never had it before and everyone loved it. The coating was much better than other recipes I've tried. I don't like Tabasco sauce but you can't taste it. It just complemented the other flavors in the coating. It stayed on the meat and looked beautiful, and although I'm usually a gravy dunce the gravy came out really well too. I wish this were a health food and I could justify eating it more often!

I made this for breakfast today.  It was my first time making country fried steak and my first time making milk gravy.  It was almost as good as the country fried steak you get at good restaurants and better than you get at some.  Only changes I would make next time is to season the meat prior to flouring it, and adding a little more flour and seasoning to the gravy.  My gravy took a while to thicken is the only reason I say more flour.  Otherwise it was a great recipe.  Will be making it again for sure!

this is pretty much the same as my southern family recipe that i make weekly. the addition of hot sauce is perfect, and i hadn't tried it before. i don't ever add the baking soda or powder, and i am not sure why i would. might try it one day to see the difference i guess. i season it up quite a bit more with salt, pepper and garlic powder. cfs is my husbands favorite, and he wont order it at restaurants because mine is so much better. great great great recipe!!!   OH i also use this for fried chicken breasts (texans call it chicken fried chicken). i just marinate the chicken overnight in buttermilk. make sure the chicken breasts are pounded thin, like the steaks). also after breading let it sit for half an hour so the breading wont fall off. serve it with the gravy. haven't tried it with the hot sauce but i will!

I really like the extra kick of the hot sauce.  Not enough to make it spicy, but it adds a really good flavor!

Also, if you let the steaks rest about 15-20 min after dredging in the flour, it helps keep the coating from coming off when cooking!

Hi, this is Norah, and I submitted this recipe.  Just to clear up a bit of confusion; the baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt are not mixed in with the flour; they're mixed in with the buttermilk to create a loose batter.  Also, the cube steaks ARE lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  This was specified in my original submission, but for some reason this step was left out when the recipe was finalized.  I'm glad there are so many positive reviews, and hopefully this will end any confusion.  Thank you and I hope you enjoy!!

Absolutely Excellent! I don't care for chicken fried steak normally, but this was wonderful. Our entire family really enjoyed it. Added some crushed red peppers and garlic to the gravy, 'cause we like is spicy, but otherwise left the recipe as is. Very good.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I don't think I care for this style of breading and the steaks were greasy and tough.  The tough part is probably because of the steak itself.  I may try one that used another kind of steak, not cube steak.

I thought this looked good, but we didn't care for it. The breading did not stay on the cube steaks even though I followed the recipe exactly. I think I'll stick to my old recipe. Thanks anyway.

This was very good tasting all though i'm not sure if the cast iron skillet is a necessity as i cooked the steaks a lot longer in my conventional skillet...was quite a messy affair but was very yummy!  Although i needed a lot more flour then the recipe called for as with the "double dipping" created a lot of clumped up flour that made sticking to the steak difficult, as the flour stuck to my fingers/forks alot.  Not sure what to do to make that better...maybe freezing the steaks after dipping?  But the recipe resulted in the taste i was looking for!  Thanks!

I followed the instructions to a T and this had hardly any flavor at all. At least, not the right flavor. I don’t even have any recommendations on how to correct it. I won’t be making it again.

The actual crispness/result of the batter deserves a 10/10 but I more than doubled the seasonings and the "breading" was still quite bland imo. I gave it 4 stars because it tasted better the next day, even microwaved it  still had a good texture, and my boyfriend thought it was good to begin with.

Absolutely delicious! I read a few reviews, got some good tips. I seasoned the  meat with fresh cracked salt and pepper, and used my meat mallet to lightly pound into my cubed steak. I also let the steaks rest for 15 or 20 minutes before frying, and cut the milk down to 3 cups for the gravy, which a half cup of that I used to mix with flour before adding to pan. I find I get the smoothest gravy doing that, and it does not burn.  End result, one of the most delicious dinners I've ever cooked in my kitchen! I'll definitely be making this often!

Very good. I made 6 steaks, only used 2 cups flower  1/2 Tbs baking  powder, oversized tsp baking soda, salt pepper.  1 cup milk w/1Tbs white vinegar, let sit 10 min. ,tsp tabasco, 1tsp garlic powder. Cooked in 1 cup crisco, made my own pan gravy. I’m sure it is pretty close. So good will make again.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because it's a good recipe for someone starting out on chicken-fried steak. The fifth star is because, even though I didn't actually USE the complete recipe, I gleaned a couple of tips that prove even an old dog can learn new tricks, and my personal recipe is now perfect.

#1.  I pounded in the salt and pepper. Why didn't *I* think of that? (from a comment).

#2. Momma didn't teach me about using the baking powder and soda in my flour mixture. Wow! That's a game-changer.

Don't go to seed over shortening. If you don't like it, use vegetable oil. Use lard if you want to! The important part is to keep it around 350ºF when you fry. (Lard? Hey, chicken-fried steak is not health food, so splurge if you prefer that flavor.)

And gee whiz, don't go nuts with the flour. Coat them, give a slight shake, then let them set for a few minutes before frying. If you put globs of flour on them, of course they're going to taste odd.

Mine turned out looking like the pic with the Corn on the Cob.  Outstandingly easy.  5 Keys to this recipe.  Baking Powder, Baking Soda, Buttermilk, Tabasco and OIL TEMPERATURE.

Season steaks before coating, let stand 15 min after coating. Do not fear cast Iron, the individual steaks should float in the oil.

P.S. I used ribeyes :)

I  seasoned the steaks first & let rest after flour & batter. Used canola oil which works well; less milk and a little chicken stock in the gravy.  Very pleased with the results! Husband rarely compliments anybody's cooking & he raved about this. I'll be looking for more recipes from Norah.

Superb crunchy texture with that juicy chewy cube steak center, it's country fried heaven! Left out the salt and gravy, topped with a half teaspoon of Louisiana hot sauce, didn't miss a beat. Highly recommend.

My husband who is a southern boy loved this recipe and I was told I have to make it again (this is why I gave it 5 star, his belly is happy).  I am a yank and thought it was ok (I’m not into fried dishes).  The gravy turned out good too and was pretty easy to make.

Used top round roast, cut into steaks. Had to turn the temperature down to cook the steaks through without burning the outside. For the gravy we fell back on my wife's standard gravy, which is phenomenal.  Good recipe over-all.

Delicious recipe, thank you for sharing this. One thing I would change however, be sure to season the meat before tenderizing it. The meat comes out a bit flavorless if you don't do this. The flour and egg mixture is perfect though.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except I used good old fashioned lard to fry it in.  It turned out awesome!  First time I've ever made chicken fried steak and the flavor was awesome and it was nice and crispy.  I had one problem though.  When building the coating I had trouble with it getting stuck to the pan in the last step before frying.  When I pressed the flour into the meat, the flour on the bottom side would stick to the pan, so I need to come up with a new method of insuring the coating stays adhered to the meat.

I may just dredge it a third time after it sits 10 min., and put it directly into the pan.

I couldn't imagine making this in anything other than a cast iron pan!

My guest thoroughly enjoyed it as well. Next time (which will be very soon) I will make sure to remember a picture for y'all.

I followed the recipe with out modification. The steaks came out well cooked and tasted fine, a bit chewy but that was the meat, not the recipe.  I made the gravy as directed even if it seemed a bit different from how I generally make from scratch gravy. The gravy broke and was unrecoverable.  I had to start over and make my old standard gravy.  My boys weren't crazy about the meal. My husband was luke warm. I do really like the batter and will use it in the future but not likely for steak. I don't often goof up a recipe, I'm a very seasoned cook. But maybe the gravy was just not ment to be. Thank you for the awesome batter though.

I made this and it was good.  Nothing beats having it deep fried at a diner but this came close.  I simplified it a lot.  I just used eggs, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and a little salt and a lot of pepper.  I made simple sausage gravy and hash browns and we had a diner meal at home.  I will make it again.

Only difference was steak was already from the store so I didn’t tenderize it.  Only use one cup of shortening.

This was a childhood favorite that turned out better than I expected! Made with garlic powder instead of cloves and Megan's mock buttermilk. Fried in olive oil and butter but otherwise followed exactly. Will definitely make again!

So delicious,! Buttermilk is definitely the secret ingredient for sure, the batter was plenty thick and made enough to do 6 large pieces of steak. however, I wouldn’t suggest drying the pieces on the rack like the recipe calls for, because as the meat rest, it tends to loose juices and dries out the steak. Instead, fry in batches, and wait to bread the second batch after you turn the 1st steaks over.

I tweaked the recipe just a bit, and it turned out great, the crust was really crispy and the inside was really tender, it is important to hammer them out, that is what made mine tender, due to diet issues I used no salt, and I used homemade buttermilk,  I will be making this again, and would recommend it to anyone.

Absolutely delicious!  I am Italian, and tend not to cook something considered "not Heaelthy" however my family orders it whenever we go out  to breakfast, so I thought I would give it a try!  It turned out be be flavorful, delicate ( you could cut with a fork and comforting on a rainy night.  The only change I made was to make my own chicken gray, not using the oil from the fryinng pan.  I made the best mashed potato recipes from All Recipes to accompany the skirt, yummy!

great recipe.  The buttermilk vinegar substitute is fine, however they do make powdered buttermilk in a can if anyone is interested in keeping buttermilk on hand. Just like powdered milk.

The chicken fried steak had a great crust. However, the gravy was horrible. I think bottled gravy would have been better.

I basically made the same thing with pork chops last night, using the Pioneer Woman's Smothered Pork Chop Recipe.  It doesn't need as much grease and gravy is made with Chicken bouillon and a tablespoon of cream.

Sorry, after making this recipe, I returned to the McCormick Country Gravy Pack recipe which is basically the same but allows for pan frying which does not require the extra work, mess and fat by deep frying the meat.  Serve with mashed potatoes with lemon juice to add extra flavor and a big green salad.  Hmmm mummm. Dad and kid's favorite.

Delicious! I'd give this recipe a 4 and a half if I could, only because my gravy tasted too floury. I had to keep adding milk which seemed to help. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it was absolutely delicious, especially on a cold winter's night. My son absolutely loves chicken fried steak so this was a winner! Thanks!

My husband and sons loved it.  Next time I would get the shortening started to melt and heat up before putting my flour and buttermilk mixture put together. Step 2 should be before step 1 in other words.

Fantastic! I was curious about the batter part, now I know, I followed the recipe as written, although I did salt and pepper the meat before coating. This is the best chicken fried steak I have ever tried.

This turned out very good .  I tried to follow the recipe but had to tweek it to my taste. The sauce was kind of bland so I added salt, pepper & chicken bouillon to up the flavor of the sauce. My husband & I  loved it.

My husband and I are from Texas, so we know chicken fried steak.  This was my first time making it and it turned out really good. The only thing I changed was to lightly season the meat before battering it.  I also got a little distracted while frying them up and let the oil get too hot which scorched the tidbits.  Watch your oil temperature!  I ended up discarding the burnt stuff and made my gravy without them.  To compensate for my mistake, I added a little beef bullion, garlic and onion powder.  It turned out just fine.  Thanks for a really nice recipe.

I have never made a bad recipe from this website. It's my "go to." But this meal was inedible. My son smothered ketchup all over his so he could eat it. What a waste of time, energy and money.

Absolutely delicious!
I have saved this recipe and will make it again and again!
(I did not have buttermilk, so i mixed a tsp of lemon juice with 1/2 cup of half & half, and added that to the beaten egg....... and I have never ever been good at making pan gravy, so I served these with canned mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes.)    Huge hit here!

Rating based on husbands review as he is the chicken fried steak lover. I feel like a little seasoning in the flour would be good. The buttermilk dip is really awesome. The second time I made it there was not much pan drippings so I used the leftover buttermilk dip and added milk to extend it to the volume directed in the recipe. It made incredible gravy.

I used chicken cutlets instead of beef for personal preference and the BF loved it. The breading was flavorful and went with the country gravy so well! Thank you so much!

This was better than almost any chicken fried steak that I've ever had! Crispy outside, tender inside and although I initially hesitated to add the Tabasco to the batter, I'm so happy that I did because it was the PERFECT compliment of flavor.  I did, however, use my own sausage country gravy recipe instead of the one listed in this recipe.

Being from Texas I was raised on Chicken Fried Steak but never attempted to make it until we moved up north and none of the restaurants offered it on the menu. This is the perfect recipe. Have to admit the first time I made it was a little overwhelming. The next time & every other time,  I battered the steaks in advance and let them rest in the fridge.  When dinner time comes all you have to do is fry them up & make the gravy.  If you want a change, use boneless chicken breasts making it chicken fried chicken. Hubby actually prefers this.

9/30/18:  I thought that this was just okay.  Having said that, I didn't use buttermilk because I never have that on hand.  I used the lemon juice trick with some skim milk.  Now using skim vs. whole milk I'm sure would have made a difference.  All the same, it tasted pretty bland to me.  I would try more hot sauce/seasoning the next time, including on the meat itself.

Decided to make this based on tbhe amazing ratings- very disappointed. The gravy was HORRIBLE. Tastes like flour. I tried “doctoring it up”  with salt, pepper, hot sauce, beef bouillon- nothing helped.

I made this last night for a friend's birthday dinner.  I used my electric skillet rather than my iron skillet.  I used a big cut of meat for my first round, but the breading fell off the meat when I turned it.  I cut the next round in half thinking that might solve the issue, but it did the same thing.  Is there a secret to keeping the breading on while it's cooking?  I make a very similar breaded pork chop recipe that uses a lot of the same ingredient, but my  dredge is more egg based than buttermilk.

I should have used beef stock/broth instead of the vegetable shortening, and seasoned the beef more.
I will probably make it again with the changes

Disclosure... I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of highly seasoning the meat before I dredged it in the flour. I also used cubed steak so I did not have to pound it.

I’ve made chicken fried steak for years & my family has loved it. I don’t even remember where or how I got the recipe I used. But, when this recipe came to my email, I read the recipe & the rave reviews, & decided I should at least give it a try. I chose to do that when our son was visiting us from Texas. CFS is one of his favorites & I knew I was at high risk by changing up the recipe. (Probably not a wise move. ??) I tried to pull a fast one & did not tell my husband or son that it was a new recipe. However, they noticed immediately. Boy, was I relieved when the CFS was declared delicious AND better tasting than my old, original recipe. Whew! So... out with the old & in with the new.

I also followed one reviewer’s gravy recipe by sautéing onions & garlic, stirring in the flour, cooking a few minutes & adding the milk/cream followed by chicken stock. The gravy was outstanding as well.

I don't have a rating for this recipe.  I do have a question.  What is cube steak?  Is it a certain cut of meat?  I've been cooking for a very long time and have never heard of cube steak.  I have years ago bought a preformed beef in the shape of a square and were in the freezer section.  My Mom bought these too and dipped them in beaten eggs and then into crushed crackers and then fried.  My sisters and I always loved them and when I married and had children my children loved them.  Unfortunately they haven't been available for a very long time.

I used coconut oil to deep fry the steaks and it worked.  It was my first time making it and my sister and I were very pleased.  I just made gravy from a packet so it would be quicker.   Either way it was fantastic .  Better than the ones I ate at restaurants.

My family loved this. I added paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, and lots more pepper to the gravy for better flavor.  Also salt and pepper the flour and not just the batter as the chicke. Fried is a little bland.

Delicious! CFS is a staple in Texas so I was really nervous about making it but my boyfriend really wanted it. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and I made sure to season the meat first with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also let the meat rest on a wire rack with the coating on for about 20 min before frying and it helped the breading stay on. I do not like spicy foods but I still added the Tabasco and it just adds flavor, no spice at all. Great recipe!

Having never made chicken fried steak before I was a little nervous when my husband asked me to make it for dinner.  The chicken itself was delicious!  The gravy was fairly bland, I ended up adding beef bouillon powder and parsley to amp up the flavor along with plenty of black pepper.  My family is definitely singing my praises tonight!

I’ve made this recipe twice, following directions both times, and both times my family and I found that both steak and breading were tasteless, yet so rich from the frying that none of us could eat more than half. Plus, the clean-up was a major chore. The patties I used were pretty thin, but maybe they should have been thinner. If I were to make it again - which I won’t, but if I did - I would 1)pound the heck out of the meat; 2) salt and pepper the meat prior to breading it; 3) add a lot more salt and pepper to the breading, and possibly more tabasco; 4) jazz up the gravy with garlic salt and a few other things as suggested by other reviewers; and 5) use less than half of the recommended oil. Giving it two stars because of all the changes that need to be made, and the fact that both cooking and clean-up were too much work for a meal we couldn’t eat.

The coating was perfect.  The meat was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly as this was the first time using it.  We (the entire family) agreed that the gravy was definitely missing something.  The consistency of the gravy was excellent but the flavor was very bland.  The next iteration of this recipe will include some garlic, onion, and perhaps chicken broth or bouillon in the gravy.  It definitively needs something.  However, not to bash the recipe - the dredging ingredients were spot on...

I feel terrible, but I found this recipe to be awful. There was no flavor whatsoever and cooking in shortening made it exceptionally greasy. My husband who loves chicken fried steak did not like it either.

I didn't change anything, but based on the reviews, I wish I had put salt and pepper on the meat first. It was very bland. Also, I don't really care for that much flour on it. If I do it again, I think I would just dip it in the buttermilk mixture first and then in the flour and let that be it.

I used thin cut top round, not a fan of cube steak.  This recipe is awesome.  My family lives the double dipped version.  Resting the steaks is a must.  I clean up the kitchen and get everything else ready.  I keep powdered buttermilk in my pantry, I use milk mixed with powdered buttermilk in a pinch.

Black pepper MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!  I recommend about three times as much and rough grind it fresh.  Tabasco hot sauce is several times as potent as most other hot sauces though the pepper mash for a great many of them is purchased from the McKilhenny Corp. and diluted much more.  While South Louisiana natives may find this recipe mild, folks from the rest of the nation may not be accustomed to hardly any spice and may be overwhelmed by it.  I have traveled over a good bit of the nation and have learned this by experience.

Been making Chicken Fried Steak most of my adult life, and have always been looking for ways to improve it.  This recipe is hands down the best!  Prior to this I always seasoned the breading, never considered seasoning the "wash."  My Family raves about this.  Be sure to use a Cast Iron Skillet.

This was absolutely fabulous. I did flour, batter, flour method. Also took a reviewers advice from her Mamaw, and used a blend of chicken stock/milk combo for gravy.  Definitely, in my rotation now. Thanks for sharing.

It was really good. We did not salt and pepper the gravy enough but the recipe turned out awesome and will definitely try it again. The Tabasco sauce in the batter was also a nice touch. It provided a nice but subtle addition.

Only change was heavy cream instead of buttermilk, which I did not have on hand and store is 30 miles away.  What a waste of time, effort and money,  We choked it down but never again.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts as recommended by a previous reviewer.  Otherwise no changes to the recipe (besides that one HUGE one!) Delicious!  I've never used baking soda and baking powder while breading/frying before and I think they really made a difference.  The hot sauce didn't make it too spicy. just added a nice savory flavor.

I've been eating this for as long as I can remember my mom is the master at chicken fried steak the only thing I would change about this recipe is I add bacon grease to my regular grease for flavor and I don't add the Tabasco but it's something I would definitely try make this with the mashed potatoes and creamed corn heaven

Really excellent recipe. I didn't need the full 4 cups of milk so would suggest adding it little by little until the gravy is the right consistency. My whole family loved it.

This recipe is the best chicken fried steak I have ever used! It's Southern quality, has that nice crunch and was sooo delicious I wanted to eat another streak! I didn't, but I really wanted to! I would like to make one suggestion; salt and pepper the steaks before you dredge in the flour and batter. Absolutely delicious!

This is a very good recipe. I ended up seasoning the flour as well as the buttermilk and doing a double dredge. The flavors are great and definitely makes for a good base recipe to change to your liking.

I just made this for dinner and unfortunately the meat is not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. I'm certain it depends on the meat. I used cube steak.

I didn't have any baking soda so I didn't add it.  I also used half and half because I didn't have any milk.  So delicious even without the correct ingredients.  Family LOVED it!!!

Made this Recipe last night. I actually SOAKED the Chicken Fried Steak in the Buttermilk blend in a Ziploc for about 5 hours. I added some Lawry's Seasoning Salt to the Flour, Salt and Pepper Dredge. I didn't want to 'Deep Fry' the meat -- so I Pan Fried it in Butter.  I paired it with my Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes and Sliced Carrots. Hubby and I finished our plates (which we usually don't). I woke up and thought about that leftover piece of Chicken Fried Steak. Hmmmmmmm -- Breakfast :)

Ok.  I only made the steak part and made packaged gravy, but it was my first attempt to make it. The batter and directions to fry the steaks were extremely very good.  I'm sure the gravy is great but my boyfriend doesn't like gravy that is not the white peppered gravy in the package kind. I know, I know.

So not what I was hoping for, it was more like a giant finger steak. Very disappointed! I can't eat factory farm meat,  substituted with meat I can eat. The batter was thick and doughy. Will not be making it again. Once is enough, thanks ??

Bland. 
I would try adding pepper,  salt, and paprika to the flour next time.
Overall good, but needs a little kick.

It was fabulous the temperature of the oil is important I scorched the first one I would recommend salting and peppering the beef before dredging in flour. But all in all best coating I have ever made or eaten!

OKay this is hands down the best recipe!  two changes made I used tai spicy stuff (in a jar) and added that to the buttermilk.  I used bisquit instead of flour and added a lot of spices to that.  We love spicy food and this was just perfect for us.

this was awful.  The batter made the chicken fried steak look like a pancake with edges that were too well done.  It would have been burnt to a crisp by the time the meat was done.  I grabbed it out of the pan, scraped the disgusting looking batter off the meat and went back to the old school theory of dredging and forget about battering

This is the best recipe I've found for breaking the steak. You definitely need to do the double, if not, triple dredge. I don't measure the hot sauce in the wet ingredients but know I triple or quad it. I also add more black pepper to the dry and 1/4 tsp of cayenne. This recipe is also very good for fried chicken. I add granulated garlic, onion powder, black pepper, and Lawreys season salt to the meat before pounding it. I use a needle tenderizer which pushes the seasonings into the meat. This addition definitely adds more flavor to the dish. We use pork tenderloin (cheaper than beef) most of the time. I guess you could call it redneck schnitzel. The keys to the breaking are the buttermilk, baking soda, and baking powder.. For future meals, we dredge everything and freeze the cutlets on a cutting board and then seal them. Take them out the night before fore breakfasts or for dinner that night. Thank you for putting this recipe on the site, it is my goto fried steak recipe!

After years of trying this one and that one with 'Eh' to 'pretty good' results, I have finally found a GREAT chicken fried steak recipe! The baking powder and baking soda really made a difference in the crust.  The buttermilk (I subbed whole milk with lemon juice-set for 5 minutes) and hot sauce gave a perfect flavor.  TY!

I loved the crunchy texture and taste.  But I sure couldn't believe the mess - i had the coating all over hands and everywhere else. I guess that what made it taste so good LOL.  I think there was too much gravy - if there is such a thing.  Next time I'm going to cut the amount of milk used down to 2 cups.  It took me forever to thicken up the gravy using 4 cups.  Other than that, I'm definitely going to make this again, and change just a few things. Thank you for the recipe!

... the BEST CFS I've had. I make this on a slow fall / winter wknd when chores and responsibilities are gone, this delicious recipe is worth the attention. The spicey "kick" works wonders.

Giving this 3 stars for a couple of reasons: 1) too much liquid ingredients. All of the steaks were breaded and I still had half of the liquid left. 2) Too much pepper in the breading. On to the next recipe.

The steak came out great. The gravy was a little bland. We added some homemade ranch to the gravy. Hit the spot.

I'm not a chicken fried steak fan my BF is and boy did he absolutely love this recipe! I was complemented after each steak. This recipe was easy and I had the few ingredients on hand so no last minute grocery run or searching for item substitutes. Will defiantly make many more times again

This was just "ok". Nothing special. The coating was nice and crisp, but the gravy was incredibly bland and boring. We all had to douse it in hot sauce to give it some kind of flavor.

Taste was okay, but the steak was so tough and hard to chew/swallow.  I guess it depends on the quality of beef.  I bout angus cube steak, but it was still very chewy.  Had to spit out 3/4 of it.

This is very delicious the way it is.    I made the gravy separately as I used a fryer to cook the steak and didn't have drippings to reserve.

I have a little unorthodox Texas twist on chicken-fried steak (CFS).  I’m a single guy who buys a big chuck roast, splits it in two, freezes one half and cuts 1 inch off for the CFS.  That slice requires beating w/ the dull side of a big knife in a zip bag.  But, first add the flour, a little corn starch to make it crispy, pinches of white pepper, salt, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, etc.  Only THEN, beat it into softness with your cleaver’s dull edge.  Because the coatings are beaten into the meat’s exterior, they stick and infuse better.  No caking egg required.

Followed the suggestions to 1) season the meat before coating with the first round of flour; 2) put the coated steaks on a wire rack and wait about 15 minutes before frying the steaks; and 3) add some chicken broth to the gravy.  Using the collective wisdom of the reviewers and their comments helped make this a very tasty meal for my family!

This is fabulous!! I made this for my elderly mother, chicken fried steak is one of her favorites, she raved over this recipe.  The only changes I made is I substituted creama con sol (mexican sour cream that is thinner consistency than regular sour cream) instead of using the buttermilk because I don't readily have it on hand.  I also didn't use 1/4 cup oil in the gravy; I didn't want the extra grease, the gravy was fabulous also.  This is by far the best chicken fried steak I've ever had.  Thanks Norah for sharing this!  I highly recommend trying it, if you haven't already.  This will be going into my "family favorites" recipe file.  YUM!!

I did not add was the Tabasco as I am not a fan.  I found this to make way to much batter and the steaks were way to breads.

I had a little trouble with the recipe but I think once mastered it would be great. I found the cube steak to be too soft. The flour didn't stick well and the coating fell off pretty easily  This definitely not a meal that can be saved as leftovers. Flavor wise it was great. Next time I will follow the tips from previous reviews and hopefully get a better outcome.

This was very good.  Only problem was that I could taste the cooking oil.  Next time I will plan ahead and make sure I have bacon grease to cook it in.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes, country gravy, and applesauce.

This method works rather well for getting that nice crispy coating, although I thought it needed something more in the way of seasoning. I probably went heavy on the salt and pepper, but added a little onion powder and more garlic than called for (since I had a jar of minced). I also used Luchita's, because I only had that on hand. Anyway, I will probably make it again, and thank you for sharing this recipe!

I liked it but left out the tabasco, and used veg oil instead of shortening

I followed this recipe exactly except for two things, I made my own buttermilk by adding vinegar to milk and letting it stand 5-10 minutes, and I fried in canola oil instead of vegetable shortening because it's not something I keep in my cupboard. It crisped up perfectly and came out great. I used 2 small and 1 large cube steaks, beaten on a board with a rolling pin. The gravy came out rich and thick, looked and tasted amazing on the steaks. Will probably make it again.

5 stars all the way. I was asked for your recipie several times the first night I served it, everyone loved the breading, tenderness, and there was just enough spice to keep it interesting. Looking forward to cooking it again, and again! Thank you!

The baking soda and baking powder in the flour is genious.  I now use it with any recipe calling for breading. Really great recipe.  Thanks!

I enjoy the bare bones of this batter recipe, I use it for chicken and pork as well but to add a little more umph I season the flour with paprika, black pepper, kosher salt, onion powder, and garlic power  - to sight (I don't have any measurements yet, but like to be able to see the seasoning in the flour) when I use it for  chicken. when making pork I substitute  paprika for seasoned salt.  I also make my own buttermilk by adding a tablespoon and a half to the measuring cup BEFORE measuring out the milk - letting it sit for at least five minutes before use. I also prefer to make my own shortening as well by using 2 cups of vegetable oil and 2 cups of butter, because I don't really use shortening... Also instead of using Tabasco I use Louisiana hot sauce. So basically I altered this recipe enough for it to be considered a different one entirely, but I do follow the batter instructions to a T - just thought I'd share my version :)

I have made this several times, and it is delicious. The only change I made was to cook it in the deep fryer rather than a skillet. I get thin-sliced steak and only cook it a minute on each side. It's so light that it floats, and I have to turn it to cook the other side.

This is a very good recipe. If you are going to go through the work of having Chicken Fried Steak this is definitely the one to use. The coating is crispy and the gravy is tasty. I cooked this as directed and it turned out well. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was pretty good. I think next time we will pound the meat thinner. The directions were also a little confusing with the fat, milk, and flour.

Batter makes for a heavier breading than I prefer and it turned out kind of bland.  Just an average fried steak, not the “greatest”, imho.

The first time I made it, there just wasn't a lot of flavor.  So I soaked the steaks in the batter (minus the egg) overnight, and used srirachi instead of tabasco.  It tasted great!!  Definitely a good recipe.

This was delicious. I did as others suggested...salt and peppered the steak prior to adding the coatings. I also used the rack to hold the meat so it wouldn't get soggy. Will definitely make this again.

Good stuff! Turned out with such a nice, crispy crunchy coating that stayed on.  I used lard instead of oil (not to be confused with bacon grease) to fry it in my caste iron skillet.  Will make this again.

One of my favorite dishes is chicken fried steak and this one did not disappoint. I did change two things: salt and peppered steaks first and did not use baking powder because I didn't have any. Everything tasted so good! I will definitely make this again and again. Delicious!

A big hit in my family! I cooked it in Coconut Oil and it gave it a slightly sweet taste with the crunch. Gravy was really good but initially not salty enough and a bit thin. Served it with mashed gold potatoes and steamed broccoli and we ate everything with some leftovers.

I pretty much followed the recipe as it was, making my own buttermilk w/vinegar and milk.  It really is very, very good!  The first time I've ever made a good Chicken Fry Steak!  Yippee and thank you~!

I loved this recipe.  My family loved it as well.
I did make some changes because we are trying to eat with more healthy ingredients.  I used coconut oil to fry in and did just an inch in the pan.  I also added 1/2 cup of almond meal to add more protein to the breading.  
I will add this to my favorites list.

I had a total combined weight of 0.86 lbs of cubed steak and I did not need 1/2 of the flour or batter. Also, I added salt, pepper, and garlic to the gravy mixture because it tasted very bland (even with the drippings from the bottom of the pan). Over-all, delicious!!! Thank you!

The country fried steaks came out good but I made a mess of the gravy. I've never been good with gravy so next time I think I'll just use packaged gravy on top.

I have made chicken friend steak quite a few times, and was always disappointed until I tried this recipe!  I just fried the steaks in about a half inch of oil, because I'm cheap and I didn't want to use all my oil deep frying.  Everybody loved this recipe, especially me.  I cook a lot of good food, but this recipe is getting special requests, so if you are a fan of chicken friend steak, this is the one to try.

This was ok, but way too involved. When you get your steaks, ask the butcher to run them through the tenderizer once. Save yourself some time. You don't need baking powder or soda.  The tabasco is a nice touch. However, I would discourage using the "leftover" flour to make your gravy. Two reasons, one, with the egg and such, it's more likely to make lumpy gravy. And secondly, you've got raw pieces of meat in there that won't fully get cooked.  I would suggest using fresh flour, equal parts flour to oil. Brown your flour. Then  add your milk. :)  It's nice to try new versions of my favorite meal. Thank you. :)

This is a super easy delicious recipe! I made it with cube steak and it was very tender. The gravy took some time, but still simple, easy and perfect for a quick fix super meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so great! My husband wants it again already! I did make one change, I used a packet of lawry's brown gravy rather than the gravy in the recipe after I tasted it... overall a fantastic recipe!!

LOVED it! i honestly dont like making changes to the recipes on here until after ive made it once, and found out my truest opinion on recipes.  However i didnt have any shortening so i just stuck them in my deep fryer (w/ Canola oil)  and cooked for 6 minutes. i only did one steak at a time since my steaks were big enough to fill the basket.  other than that i did salt and pepper the steaks themselves instead of the flour or egg wash  and instead of all the flour i did half flour and half bread crumbs but those are personal changes i typically make when frying anything.. But with that being said my family and i loved this recipe alot and have decided to keep it in our preffered recipes box.. Thanks so much for sharing

Made as directed but felt the meat didn't get done with all that breading.  Good seasoning in the breading just too much.  Gravy was just ok.  If wanted to make again I would have to make some changes.

So this is the second time that have made this recipe and I tried a few changes if your interested. First I used ground chicken this time instead of cube steak. Since ground chicken is so mild and moist, I added a half of cup of panko and 1 T each of Worchester sauce and soy sauce. I stayed true to the rest of the recipe and they turned out great! The panko was the perfect binder for the ground chicken and the soy and Worchester sauce gave it a rich flavor. Either way beef or chicken, this recipe is a keeper!

The only changes I made were instead of buttermilk I used sour milk and instead of shortening to fry, equal parts bacon grease and oil. Turned out awesome! I would season the gravy at the end a but more next time. Maybe some onion powder or garlic powder or smoked paprika.

Great receipt! I did cut into strips, for steak fingers. Mixed ingredients together then put into a large freezer bag. Put in two at a time and shake to coat, then into butter milk and back into bag to coat again.  Let stand on plate until coating is kind of dry. Then cook. Very good flavor and really crunchy!

I've eaten chicken fried steak since I was a boy, this one is by far the best I've had.  Make sure you season everything to taste.  Flour mix, egg wash and meat.  Very good.  Gravy was a very nice touch as well!

This was very good.make sure to season the meat before the breading process.Made this again and pretty much doubled the spices minus the the hot sauce. Used less than a cup of canola oil (vs shortening) The baking powder and soda make this the best I've ever made!Next I'm using this on chicken!

The steak and the gravy both had a good flavor. Next time I will definitely experiment with a few other spices/seasonings to give it a little more pop. It was really fun to make.

This IS the best!! I made it exactly as the recipe was written. The meat turned out very tender, with a great crisp coating. The gravy was an excellent milk gravy. This is a keeper!!

WOW!!! Delish recipe!!! I used Gluten Free all purpose flour and deer loin. I forgot to add the garlic but true to my midwest/German style I was raised eating, it was perfect!!! Better then any restaurant chicken fried steak I've ever had. Thank you for sharing.

This is a really good recipe! The only change I made was to season my meat before the batter and flour as another reviewer suggested to prevent it from tasting bland. This recipe was good enough for my super picky husband to go back for thirds!

I didn't have any buttermilk and used vegetable oil instead of shortening. My husband loved it but my son said it was too greasy for him. My first attempt at chicken-fried steak though, so I am happy with this recipe overall.

I altered the recipe like Greek yogurt instead of milk and almond flour instead of flour. It came out really good! I don't doubt this recipe would be even better. Thank you!

I have attempted to make chicken fried steak many times before, all attempts were unsuccessful, until this recipe! It was easy & delicious! The only change I made was to use 2 cups of milk and two cups of beef stock for the gravy. Yum, can't wait to make it again.

This is by far the best chicken fried steak I have ever had. The breading was so incredibly crispy. We did not have any buttermilk and substituted regular 1% milk. Also, we added additional seasonings to the egg/milk mixture. Will definitely make again.

Could of been better. I should have looked for tips prior to making this. It probably would have enhanced the recipe. Bland and I really didn't see the point of using buttermilk. My mom loved it though...goes to show our different tastes. Might try again....not sure.

The 1st two that I fried were a disaster. Followed the recipe exactly, but coating came completely off in the pan. I searched the reviews frantically for help. Thank you EKERR19 for this recipe saving tip!: rub salt & pepper on the steaks before dredging. After dredging, let them sit for a couple of minutes on a wire rack before frying. The rest of the steaks came out beautifully using this tip. I fried in an electric skillet, 5 min per side, then transferred to a cast iron to make the gravy. Delicious, & so tender! Made it for my parents, & they loved it! Served with mashed potatoes & "Grandma's Baking Powder Biscuits". Success!

This was a great recipe. The only change I made was using the wet & dry dredge to make "Dredge Pucks" which I served the gravy over. They turned out great & I'm sure I'll do this again.

This recipe was fantastic!!  I did the buttermilk substitution as some reviewers had posted (thank you!), but otherwise, I did not change anything.  My southern born husband absolutely loved it!!  It turned out crispy and the coating stayed on.  I had no problems creating this dish.  Thank you Norah for posting!

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!!! We'll steak but you're ready for it to be chicken and then you bite into a surprise! Great and easier than I thought. Gravy came out a tad bland. Only thing I would change for next time is maybe use Siracha instead of hot sauce for a little kick and added flavor, but otherwise noisy and cooked perfect. Definitely follow 3-5 minute rule! Great with the garlic green bean recipe I got off here too!

This recipe was great!  After making this once for my girlfriend and I I wanted to have it again.  She decided that it was too heavy for her.  So instead of using steak, we switched to chicken.  It was great!  the only other things that we changed was to add a little bit of paprika and cayenne pepper to the dredge.  Also, it is critical to pound the chicken out to about a quarter of an inch thick.

I fixed this for my family this evening. The name is absolutely right- it is THE BEST! My daughter in-law said it was the best chicken fried steak she has ever had! My wife echoed the sentiment. With 3 grandkids, we're a little toward the bland side and no one in the family is partial to Tobasco, so I skipped that ingredient, but otherwise went with the recipe as written. What a perfect breading batter. Served the steaks with rustic mashed Yukons and jalapeno gravy. We all enjoyed this recipe and it will remain in my box and will be a go to star for us. Thanks!

Simply put, this was awesome!! I've been making my own version of chicken fried steak for years...this topped it. The crust was perfectly crisp under the creamy gravy. Just perfect, add some mashed potatoes and peas... it was comfort food at it's best. Thank you.

My husband and son LOVED this recipe.  The Tabasco & garlic in the batter really gives it a great flavor.  The only thing I did differently was I sprinkled a bit of Creole/Cajun seasoning on the cube steak before I dredged it in the flout/batter/flour mixture.  I also drained most of the oil out of the cast iron pan and added about a tablespoon of bacon grease to make the gravy.  DELICIOUS.  Served with homemade mashed potatoes, and you have a heavenly comfort food meal.

I made this recipe tonight exactly as listed except I replaced the garlic and hot sauce with a few squirt of Sri sriracha rooster sauce. My boys ate ALL of them. They key is to bread 1, let it sit about 3 minutes before putting it in the oil. Wonderfully yummy and so crispy! Thanks

I made a few minor changes: I used one can mushroom soup, one can cream of chicken. Used minced onion vs. fresh. Mixed all cheese in casserole instead of saving any for topping. Topped with Durkee onion topping instead of chips. Mixed casserole in pot and warmed slightly to shorten time in oven and prevent Durkee onion topping from burning. Delicious.

This is so filling and good.  Ultimate comfort food.  Unfortunately the calorie count makes these a rarity at my house.  Excellent for special occasions.

The only change I've made to this recipe the dozen or so times I've made it is use Seasoning Salt instead of regular salt nor do I "double dip".  I dip the meat in the batter than the flour but that is just a personal preference and delicious either way.

This is an excellent recipe.  I added Italian style croutons and omitted the Tabasco sauce; I put the croutons in the food processor mixed them with the flour. Oh! my husband and teenager son loved it!!! Since my husband doesn't eat chicken, I used pork and chicken for my son. The food was moist and delicious.

Did just about everything the recipe said.  I did make my own buttermilk and only did a little more than a cup. also only did about 2 1/2 cups of milk for gravy and used garlic salt and lots of pepper.  Loved the texture.  did seasoned the meat before dredging.  It was great! I think getting the oil hot enough was really a key too, along with putting the flour on the meat where it was dry!

I'm always on the look-out for the best chicken fried steak.  I thought I had found it with one of our local restaurants until I tried this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic!  I don't even have to go out for a great chicken fried steak any more.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

Good breading flavor! I beat the meat forever and it was still tough nor did it have any flavor. Maybe I bought the wrong meat? Need to season the meat. This might be better with chicken.

This was pretty tasty - the coating was perfectly seasoned. I had to use 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder in place of the cloves. I found that I didn't really have to cook the steaks in cups and cups of shortening. Maybe a quarter cup of vegetable oil was all I needed for each steak. When I tried using three cups of fat, the steaks fell apart.

This recipe was pretty good. I have never had chicken fried steak before and was amazed at how much it looked like fried chicken . The only suggestion I might make (like many others) is to season the steak with salt and pepper before the initial dip in the flour. Also I substituted the shortening for plain old vegitable oil. If you are a lover of well seasoned dishes you might also want to add an extra dash of salt and pepper to the flour and the buttermilk batter as well. **please note that the gravy in my picture is not the one in this recipe.

I have to tell you, I made this when a friend butchered one of our older cows. We got a lot of  cubed steak (which now I am happy about) and I had to figure something to do with it. I really enjoy a good CFS. I made this several times and every time my husband said how good it is. He made the comment that I have probably ruined him for any other. We used to order it quite often in restaurants. thank you for a GREAT RECIPE.

This is really a very good recipe!  One note that has been mentioned that you really need to heed..get those steaks thin..that way you can be sure your meat is done when your coating is nice and golden brown.  Really good!

I added 1/4 teaspoon paprika and ceyene pepper to batter for a little extra kick. Everyone wants the recipe. Turned out very well. Love it.

best chicken fried steak I've ever had.  I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and it turned out fine.

I am giving this 4 stars as I did make some changes due to the reviews. 

First I seasoned the steaks with salt, garlic powder and pepper.  I also used the same seasoning combo in the flour.  No measurements I just shake some in mix it up and smell.  I also added more hot sauce the "batter" was orangeish.  

Second, I didn't use crisco, I used vegetable oil.  

Third, I was not NOT wasting 4 cups of milk (milk is expensive) for gravy.  That's ridiculous, I used 2 cups milk and a pouch of brown gravy mix as well as a little oil from the bottom of the pan.  added pepper.  

This was a huge hit.  My husband wants it in the rotation, it didn't take long to make, my 17 month old daughter was a "clean plater" and wanted seconds.  I loved the flavor and crunch, and liked the gravy very much, w/o the modifiations the gravy would have been bland.  

My husband did request that I make country gravy next time just because he likes country gravy.

Our family loved this!! I cooked in vegetable oil rather than shortening simply because I was out. I loved the addition of Tabasco sauce, it gives it a really nice subtle flavor but not spicy. I have added this to our regular meal rotation.

Made this tonight, it had good reviews.  I am vegetarian, so I didn't try it, but my meat eating people liked it.  The only things I did differently was for the flour mix I added extra garlic and some Red Robin seasoning...I reserved the remaining flour mix for my gravy instead of plain flour, and I added some sausage drippings.  Thank you for posting this, I am sure it will be a regular for our Sunday breakfast!

Delicious, made a few tweaks. Used Frank's Red Hot instead of Tabasco. Added salt and pepper to the flour. Used jarred chicken gravy instead of making my own. Served with mashed potatoes and corn, one of the best meals I've made. Kids loved it too and they are picky. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband has asked for chicken fried steak for a while now, and I tried this recipe tonight and loved it. I used a fry daddy and vegetable oil to fry the steak. It was delish! And I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe gluten-free and dairy-free and LOVED IT!  I replaced the flour with Bob's Red Mill all-purpose gluten-free flour, replaced the buttermilk with soy milk and a tablespoon of lemon juice, and replaced the milk in the gravy with rice milk.  (Soy milk is a little too sweet for gravy.)  I added garlic to everything, because in my house, you can't ever have too much garlic, and I took the advise of others and seasoned the meat before coating.  I also used half chicken and half cube steak. (Pound out the chicken, too!)  The chicken was just as good, maybe better?  (And now I know I can do allergy-free fried chicken!)  Next time, I will season the batter a litte more, too, with more salt, pepper, and of course, garlic.  Overall, this recipe is AMAZING, and it was great to have chicken fried steak and chicken once again, after years of missing out due to allergies.  Also, the other 3 "non-allergics" in the house said it was definitely a keeper!  We all cleaned our plates!  Thanks for this one!!

My family loved this recipe.  Its a keeper. Only thing different I did was add more heat.  I added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and a shake or 2 more tabasco sauce, and more pepper in flour.  Thank you for sharing.

By far the best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had. Couldn't be simpler and regarding the buttermilk, as another posted it's easy to make buttermilk yourself using lemon juice and whole milk so there's no leftover. A keeper.

First time I had ever made Chicken Fried Steak and it was AWESOME!!!! Family loved it. Even my picky eater son ate it and it is very hard for me to get him to eat any meat. Used whole milk instead of butter milk and it turned out great!

This was very easy. I looked it up while I was at the grocery store doing some last minute dinner shopping. Came home and made it quickly for my starving family. They loved it. Fast and easy. A perfect southern American dish.

This was excellent - FINALLY a chicken fried steak recipe I like!   I would use MUCH less buttermilk, etc. next time as there was most of it left over after dipping the beef.  Thanks Norah - this is a keeper!

Pretty darn good. Never made chicken fried steak before but my husband requested it for his birthday. Only change to the recipe is that we fried in veggie oil instead of shortening. Very tasty. Will make again. :)

I grew up in Texas and cut my teeth on chicken fried steak. I have an old family recipe but this one beats it! This is by far the best chicken fried steak I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly except I used vegetable oil instead of shortening and only about 2 cups.

Best chicken friend steak ever. Hands down! We used Cholula hot sauce (A little less than called for), and it wasn't quite enough. Next time we will use the full tablespoon. We will be making this many more times in the future.

First off; 2 cups of flour was a waste of a cup of flour. Keep the other dry ingredients the same, but don't throw away a cup of flour. 
Second; I pre-seasoned the meat with salt & pepper, and glad I did, it gave the meat just a enough extra flavor.
3rd: I used lard instead of the shortening, liked the boost it gave to the meat.
Lastly: The gravy was very bland, although the lard helped it. I added Tabasco (1/2 teas.), a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and additional salt & pepper to the gravy. 
The meat, the dredge & batter was very good and help up well. I was impressed with that, but again, the gravy really needed some work.
I would make this again with the changes I made.

Excellent! I didn't use buttermilk as I didn't have any.  Instead I "made" the buttermilk using the suggestions of other cooks here.

As suggested, I seasoned the meat with garlic, onion, salt, and pepper before it was battered.

It was very very good!

The story that goes with my trying to make this is a classic "oops".  When I decided to make this one evening, I got into the whole process before I realized I had only about a 1/2 cup of flour left in the pantry.  Believe it or not, I subbed with half panko to bread the cube steaks, saving the meal and no one was the wiser.  Just goes to show that a good recipe will come out okay with a little kitchen knowledge and some ingenuity.  Thanks for the nice recipe.

Phenomenal! I must admit I forgot to add the egg, but I didn't notice any deficiencies.  I was a bit skeptical of the "strange" sets of dredging (In my mind you'd usually put the baking soda, baking powder, salt & pepper in with the flour not the buttermilk). But it was AMAZING! I think the batter is sublime and the crisco adds a great flavor that reminds me of Grandma's cooking. The store I went to didn't have cube steak (weird, right?)so I used chicken and it was delicious, can't wait to try with cube steak.

Made this for dinner last night and fiancee loved it! I salted and peppered cubed steak for an hour or so until I was ready to cook. I halved the recipe and added half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture. Other than that, I kept to the recipe and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loves chicken fried steak, and I have tried different ways to prepare it for him. This recipe was hit for him, he even wanted seconds. So now I have saved it in my recipe box and will prepare this way until something better come along, which I doubt.

My family loved this, I made it for dinner tonight. So crispy and flavorful. I used the cast iron skillet and I think that is the best way to cook it. I have tried other recipes and this is our new favorite. I didn't have buttermilk, will try it that way next time. I also left out the Tabasco, hubby has an ulcer. Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1c of milk and 1/4 c sour cream for the wet part of dredging.  I sprinkled minced garlic on the meat and let that marinate for a few hours. I seasoned the flour with garlic powder, salt and onion powder. I salt and peppered the seasoned meat before I dredged. I also sesoned the gravy part with salt, pepper, garlic powder and tabasco.  This was soooo Yummy. I have never had chicken fried steak but I really liked this.

I have never taken the time to rate a recipe for two reasons; one I never follow anything exact and two I've never found something so spectacular to offer my opinion....until now! I followed this recipe to almost a t except for instead of flour I used packet peppered gravy powder. I a. Not a fan of tabasco sauce nor is my family but I used it anyways and OMG I was very impressed! I have now found a new coating for my fried chicken as well, wonderful!! The look of the finished product wasn't so pretty but I'm sure with a little practice it will look better! This recipe is going in my normal dinner rotation file!!! Thank u so much for this recipe!!!!

5 stars for technique, 3 stars for flavor.  The breading stayed on and cooked beautifully; however, it was rather bland and really needs salt, pepper and perhaps some garlic directly on the meat before breading.

Wow!  My picky son said that this tasted better than a local diner that is known for their CFS.  He ate two steaks and the hubby showed great restraint from a second helping!  The gravy was the perfect consistency, but needed some extra seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Perfect chicken fried steak. For me personally, it could use a little more salt/seasoning in both the batter and the flour. I just fried mine up in vegetable oil rather than shortening and it came out flawless. Thanks for a perfect 5-star recipe Norah.

steak was great. used rib eye. but the gravy needed definite doctoring. i ended up turning it into pepper sauce.. it need a lot more milk to make it the right consistency, then added cream cheese and loads of pepper. was really nice in the end and the meal was a hit.

This recipe was GREAT! I have made Chicken Fried Steak quite a few times but this is the best coating I have ever made! Thanks...I didnt change a thing except I made my tried and true gravy with it! For a really creamy gravy, I recommend 1 part heavy cream added in with the milk!

This was very good - tender and loved the breading but the gravy was bland, even though I seasoned like crazy, very gummy and pasty - next time I'll try MORE milk, I wanted a 'gravy' consistency but .....maybe I'll buy the milk gravy mix.

This is a winner. Made it exactly how the recipe says (I didn't have regular buttermilk so I used the powder that you mix with water and it worked fine) and my husband loved it! Chicken fried steak is one of his favorites and I think this recipe beat my toughest competition. The hot sauce gave it a subtle kick. Although I would suggest adding a little something more to the gravy depending on your taste preference but I paired this with the traditional mashed potatoes recipe on this site and some corn and we both had seconds!

This was good - not sure how often I will make it with the deep-fried aspect, but it was the closest I've gotten to restaurant style chicken fried steak. Will definitely keep in my recipe box!

This was very good, except I did not care for the gravy it made.  I would have preferred jarred over this and I love homemade gravy.  The steak was great though, thanks!

I'm a very novice cook but I was mostly successful with this recipe. My one main problem though was that I bought four cube steaks from the butcher, however they wouldn't stand up to placing them in the flour and wash. They would break apart so easily. So out of four steaks I was able to rescue two whole steaks and several pieces. My wife still enjoyed them

Steaks were good and flavorful.  Had MAJOR problems with the gravy.  FAR too much flour, took 6+ cups milk, then it was completely bland.

The steak was spectacular! The gravy, however, was thin - on texture and on flavor. Next time, I will use half as much milk and see if that bolsters it a bit.

So I don't typically write reviews because I don't typically follow recipes but instead use them as a guide.  I had to review this one because I actually followed the recipe almost to the T and it was SO GOOD!  The only thing that I did differently was to season the meat a day before with Steak Seasoning and let them sit in the fridge.  I also seasoned the flour that I used; with granulated garlic and pepper.  I fried the steak in cast iron skillet with shortening.  I loved the batter and can't wait to make again.  Thanks so much!!

Was good for when you want an old style meal. Definitely season the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder before dredging in the flour. I would also add some cayenne or white pepper to the egg mixture but overall a good recipe.

I thought these would be real flavorful, but I found them to be quite bland - I think I would (as another review stated) Season the meat with salt & pepper prior to the first flouring. Also, they had an overwhelming grease taste from the vegetable shortening - I believe thy would taste less greasy using canola oil. They were very nice and crunchy!

This was absolutely amazing. Made this for my roomies and they all raved. Even the boy from the south. Couldn't think of any major changes needed. Though I did find that using some buttermilk in the gravy gave it a better flavor in the end.

I've made this twice.  The first time, I thought maybe I made a mistake so I wanted to try agin before reviewing.  It was just ok for me.  Nothing spectacular.  Followed the recipe exact, and I think, maybe, I can find something better.

I made the recipe to the letter. It was ok. The gravy was very thick and WAY too fattening. The batter didn't have much taste since all the ingredients sank to the bottom of the bowl I had for dipping. My suggestion would be to season each patty outside the bowl. I will try the recipe again with tweaking but we didn't really like this one.

This IS tasty but the breading is very thick and loaded with calories.  I really can't say this is any better than a more standard recipe and certainly not worth the extra calories.

I am always looking for new chicken fried steak recipes but often find that the batter doesn't end up with enough crunch - which is what I absolutely love.  This recipe did not dissapoint.  I used thinly cut round steak (my personal preference) and they turned out great!  The gravy recipe made far more than I needed so next time I will cut in half. Actually, I think the gravy detracts from the meat and would only use it for the mashed potatoes I made to go along with it next time.  I also made green beans cooked with a bit of salt pork and the dinner was delicious.

I thought I knew everything about frying but I was wrong.  This is the best coating I have ever made for  a steak.  I cant wait to try it on everything else.  Make it exactly according to the directions the first time and after that the possibilities for endless adaptation to taste and varying the flavorings will be obvious.  Thanks a million Norah.

What a nice change from my normal dinners.  Thanks Norah.  The family really enjoyed it and even my pickey 5 year old liked it.  I cut it up into squares for him and told him it was chicken nuggets, and he ate it without the gravy of course.  Will be making it again.

I tried this out on my picky teenagers. By far the best review I had from them. We all loved it and I cannot wait to share this with friends. I substituted regular milk since I did not have buttermilk on hand and it came out perfectly.

ADD CRACKERS -I loved it but made a few adjustments on my second batch... I marinade steaks in egg mix for 15-20 min, dredge steak in flour mix and then again in a second bowl of flour loaded with cracker pieces. The Club Crackers added the extra crunchy batter and marinading the steak really enhanced the flavor! You would never know it had crackers in the batter!! My Family said it was BEST EVER! And we are HUGE CFS FANS!

I have made this several times and I truly love this recipe. Since I don't have baking soda or baking powder I normally just use flour, I also add a dash of paprika to the flour and it comes out perfect every single time.

This is by far the best recipe I've tried - the buttermilk breading is so light and crispy!  The only reason I am rating 4 out of 5 stars is that we felt, as written, the finished product needed more seasoning.  Adjust this & you will have the perfect quintessential Southern Chicken Fried Steak!

This was really good. it's a little oily but other than that very flavorful. Also, be sure to salt and pepper the meat before putting in the flour and batter.

This was pretty good. My husband liked it and my daughter said it taste like chicken. I only used 1/2 a tablespoon of Tabasco. I really like the Tabasco flavor but I was afraid it would be too spicy for the kids. Everybody loved the gravy, it was excellent. I was hoping the steak would be crispier though. Still a great recipe!

Makes a good heavy meal with mashed potatoes.  My husband and 2 boys liked it a lot and my husband said it would be a good winter/fall meal.  I made it exactly and wouldn't change anything next time.

Thought this was a great basic recipe.  Loved the way the coating cooked! Thought it needed more seasoning though. Next time I will season flour before coating.

Always delicious, my family loves it each time.  I season my flour with seasoned salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a little salt so that the crunchy coatin has great flavor.  I don't use tobasco sauce cause it's not really my thing :-).  I use chicken instead of beef and it's always great.  I cut the chicken breast in halves so that they are thin sliced and you get more flavor that way.  Watch your oil and don't let them cook too fast!  Great recipe... Thanks!

i cut the recipe in half since only me and my 6yr loves chicken fried steak. My 2yr in a cereal stage right now so he doesn't count. Its very good. i usually use biscuit mix since its better then plain flour. But this was the bomb and now i know how to make the gravy. which i over salted but that was my fault. I'll add that if you're cooking for 2 the recipe for the gravy still makes alot. and i'm a gravy hog. so next time i'll scale the gravy to 1 serving. but thank you so much for this recipe.

excellent!! We only had self rising so we omit the baking powder and soda. we substituted worcestershire sauce for tobasco.and finally substituted garlic powder for cloves,and regular salt. I think I would have given 5 if you salt and season meat before dredging thru mixes will try this next time.AND thank you I haven't had chicken fried steak since I was a lil girl.They tore down all the good mom and pop restaurants.

This was an awesome recipe!  I had never made chicken fried steak and it turned out amazing!  I didn't use the tabasco sauce, but I'm going to try it next time.  This was definitely a hit with my boyfriend and dorm friends!

Five stars and I am hard to please. I followed it exactly except for the fact I had to make mock buttermilk and then accidently tossed it in clean up while cooking! So I ended up, during the gravy time, just using straight milk. Came out great regardless of my mess up. We like tabasco sauce, used extra. The only recipe to use for Chicken Fried Steak! That and I am not that big on it. I was tonight. Happy for breakfast leftovers. Husband died and went to heaven. Wish I had that kind of power!

I made this lastnite for dinner for my family. I bought the already pounded cube steaks. I had 8 of them so I doubled the flour didn't really need to double the rest. I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk and it turned out fine. I also didn't get to use the tabasco sauce because my sister can't have spicy foods because of a medical condition. The steaks were pretty thick so I had to cook them a lot longer. I also made brown gravy because that is what my mom wanted to try. I tried it with the brown gravy and the country gravy and both ways were delicious!! I will make this again for sure everyone loved it!!

Great taste, but for some reason I keep having the same problem over and over again.  The meat is tough.   I tried using "round steak", and have not been able to make it tender.  Can someone please tell me how to cook "round steak" so it will be tender.  I've tried everything.

this is real good recipe. however i made some changes . i used 2% milk and some cream instead of buttermilk and i also used panko bread crumbs after giving the last coat. the crust on the steak turned out very crisp and tasty. i used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. For the next time i will use some more spice coz i like spicy n hot but overall it was great.

My husband loved it, up in Canada you will never find one on a menu so he's sure happy I can whip this up! It was really easy, quick and delicious. The coating was crispy and tasty. Again, I didnt use buttermilk, and whole milk worked fine. I found it needed more salt, next time i will s&p the steak before dredging it.

This turned out great! I had never been successful at frying anything or making gravy, but with this recipe it turned out wonderful! My husband loved it, I will definitely be making this again and again! I did season the meat some before frying like some of the comments on here said to and I would recommend doing that for extra flavor!

Excellent recipe!  Made a couple changes, personal preference.  I used milk instead of buttermilk, to cut out some fat, and added a couple tablespoons of flour to thicken batter.  And I made a sausage gravy.  I browned country sausage in a sauce pan, removed sausage.  Added some extra oil, heated, added flour to make a blond roux.  Added hot milk, sausage and salt and pepper.  Look at "Super Sausage Gravy" for a good method for making the gravy.

This was my first attempt at making Chicken Fried Steak and it turned out perfectly ... crisp and tender!  I wasn't crazy about the gravy, will add more seasoning next time.  My husband loved it.

I loved the breading for the chicken fry, and didn't have a problem with it cooking, or falling off! I didn't like the gravy.  I am not much for using the fat/oil left over it adds way more fat than needed.  So I made a basic milk/flour gravy recipe without it, and added a few more spices. This was a great recipe we will use often!

I'm not sure what happened, but things did not turn out well.  With so many great reviews, I may try this recipe again at a later date.  My crust was a bit soggy, not as crisp as I would have liked, plus my steak was very fatty.  Can't totally blame the flop on the recipe :)

This was really good...however be careful with the shortening grease as it splatters...as my poor hand found out. But this was a really good recipe and I will definitely try to make again without any accidents.

The best chicken fried steak I have ever made.  I feel like a successful farm wife now, as making this is pretty much in the job description for living on a farm and I was failing miserably before this recipe.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  I have never used crisco to fry and was a little wary but these fried perfectly. however - my stove is not thanking me that much for this recipe with all the oil :) I used seven 1/2 pound beef cubes so I pretty much doubled the recipe.  I thought the eight cups if flour was a little much for the gravy and i had to add a boatload of seasoning (garlic powder, onion pepper, cayenne pepper, hotsauce) to try to tame down the floury taste.  Next time i will keep the flour the same at four cups no matter the quantity.  Also, i asked the people i was serving what they would do differently next time and they said that while it was flavourful, i should season the meat prefry.  Great dinner all in all.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens

Being southern, eating chicken fried steak is a way of life, and this recipe is definitely a keeper!!!  The buttermilk makes a huge difference so try to use it if it all possible, the other substitutions mentioned by other reviewers works also but I prefer the buttermilk!!!

My 2nd attempt ever at frying and this time it turned out great!  (don't ask about the 1st time, I'll just say it's been about 13 years since I've attempted it...) Followed the recipe exactly except didn't have the nerve to try & make the gravy, just bought some, but will definitely try to make it next time.

My California in-laws had never eaten CFS before, and they went nuts over these. I'm not a gravy fan, so I didn't make a gravy for them, and nobody missed not having one. Followed the recipe except I deep fried the coated cube steak in lard at 375F. On smaller steaks (say 3 ounce pieces or less) the coating always stays intact and the meat comes out perfect - amazingly moist and tender for cube steak. The Tabasco gives it a nice pepper flavor without being too strong. Oil absorption is miminal. Nephew can't wait for me to return and cook these again.

Born and bred a true Yankee this is only the second time I've ever attempted to make chicken fried steak (first  time was a flop so I'd just order it when we went out to eat.)  My husband brought home some cube steak so I looked around and found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Let me tell you, this is the best chicken fried steak I've ever eaten!  I doubled the recipe and cooked it for 8 of us tonight and it was a huge success!  I doubt that I'll ever cook chicken fried steak with any other recipe.  Thank you so much for posting!

This is a great recipe, my family loved it!  The steps are easy to follow and allow ample time to make your side dishes.  I served with mash potatoes, green salad, applesauce, and hot rolls.  The flavor was wonderful, a real stick-to-your-ribs meal.  If you are craving down home cooking, this is it.  While I cook healthy meals for my family every night, I could easily add this to our menu once a month for a real treat.

We didn't much care for this recipe.  Maybe it's because I didn't use a cast iron skillet that the crust didn't want to stick.  Or maybe it's because I omitted the Tabasco.  Either way, my husband asked that I not try this one again.

All of my attempts to make chicken fried steak have failed, except for this one.  I did need to make some changes based on past attempts.  I increased the salt, added garlic powder instead of minced and added onion powder.  All of the seasoning is in the liquid which mostly comes off before the flour.  By increasing the salt I was sure to get a great flavor and I did.  Next time, I believe I will increase the tabasco, I couldn't taste it.  Otherwise it was very good and will definitely make again.

I loved the crunch of this crust.  I didn't have cube steak so I pounded petite sirloin thin with the bumpy side of my mallet.  I lightly seasoned it with Lawrys seasoned salt.  I substituted two quick dashes of garlic powder instead of garlic and milk with vinegar instead of buttermilk.  I was nervous about the tabasco, but it was delicious!  I'll adjust the seasonings and use this same basic recipe and method for my fried chicken next time too.  Thank you!

I made this as a surprise for my husband who loves cfs but I've never made it for him. Many times when he orders it he is disappointed. Well he loved this! Went back for seconds and wont complain when we have the leftovers tonight for dinner.  I double dipped the breading and had no problem with the coating staying on and instead of shortning I used peanut oil for the frying, I also seasoned the meat before doing the coating. Next time I make it I think I'll cut the steaks in half before breading them, they were so big and I only ate 1/2 of one.

I love chicken fried steak and order it from every restaurant we try - trying to find the perfect one.  This is isn't perfect, but it's dang close.  I had to turn up the heat on the oil (maybe because we are at high altitude).  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing. Pounded the heck out of our cube steak though.  I made two steaks and reduced the grave accordingly. LOTs of yummy, browned bits.  Thanks for a winner!  :)

This was good. I agree with the other reviewers that the meat does need to be seasoned. I did season the flour and I'm glad I did, but the meat was still lacking. I fried in olive oil and not shortening (as I only use olive oil) and used milk + lemon juice instead of buttermilk; otherwise, made as written. The gravy was tasty with the addition of salt and pepper.

This is the way classic Chicken Fried Steak and Gravy should taste. While it will never be a fancy-standout dish, it is one of those rib sticking, comfort foods of the Ohio Valley. I followed the recipe as written, just added lots more pepper and served with mashed potatoes and steamed peas. I will make this again when I need a taste of home.

This recipe intrigued me. When I travel in the U.S. I would ALWAYS see this on the menu but never tried it....until now. I'm not sure what to make of it. Deep frying a steak. The batter was good. The gravy frightened me but(with a little seasoning) was good. But I didn't like the overall taste. Huh.  Think I'll stick to deep fried chicken and use this batter! And gravy!

I absolutely loved this recipe! it's better than mine, LOL. For some reason my hubby could taste the Tabasco more and more with each bite but I couldn't. This is just a fantastic recipe, thanks for posting it! I will from now on make it just like this (minus the Tobasco for my hubbys sake)

Best I've ever had. Dipped twice instead of the once called for on the recipe and used Tony Chacheres Spice N' Herbs instead of salt. Was a hit w/my hubby and three boys!

Great tasting chicken fried steak. I gave it 4 stars because I changed it just a bit.  As a few other reviewers mentioned, tastes better to season meat beforehand. A little Lowery's seasoned salt and pepper is perfect.  Then -  didn't need to add any additional salt.  I used garlic pepper, so didn't add garlic cloves.  Used Wesson Oil instead of shortening.  Noticed a few people mentioning that their steak was greasy.   Make sure grease is good and hot before putting meat in there.   I had my grease too hot at first and the grease splattered everywhere.  I turned heat to medium,the splattering stopped, and the meat cooked perfectly. Drained cooked meat on paper towels, and it was great! Meat is tender, and crust is yummy.

This was very good and easy to make. We substituted buttermilk for regular milk and it turned out fine.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  I was nervous to cook CFS; I am a newlywed and it is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I followed the recipe verbatim, and it tasted and looked perfect.

Not bad but nothing special. A bit on the greasy side. I think its because of the double coating of egg/flour- really thick. I will experiment with other recipes. Didnt make the gravy cause i only had skim milk and didnt think that would work.

This was so amazing!  I did not make the gravy, but used this as the breading.  I accidently put all dry ingredients together and all wet...not as the directions say...but it still turned out wonderful with lots of rave reviews.  I used a better cut of meat and had the butcher run it thru the machines...didn't even need a knife to cut the steak!  NO KIDDING!!!!  The Tobasco does not make the flavoring hot at all, just gives is a very distinctive and enjoyable flavor.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This was the first time that I made Chicken Fried Steak.  It will now be a regular on the menus at my house.  It was so delicious.  I even had it for breakfast one morning.  I wish I could give you 10 stars.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Hubby raved about this steak so much that I wished i had made it with chicken. (i don't eat beef) I halved the recipe and followed the directions exactly. Served with mashed potatoes and a salad. The gravy is a great topping for potatoes. Will definately try with chicken soon.

The breading was amazing on this but I had trouble with it sticking to the meat.  I gave it a 5 since it tasted so good but it came out a mess and my meat was tough.  Not by fault of the recipe.

Yummy!  We pan fored these and they were great.  However, my husband dep fired a couple of small pieces while making french fries...and they deep fried pieces were that much better!  ext time I will deep fry.  This will be a splurge for us... not at all a "healthy recipe" :-)

My first attempt at chicken fried steak was a moderate success.  The oil was a little too hot but I managed to get it to the right temperature and the remaining steaks turned out great.  The gravy was a bit bland, and I would likely add a few spices to that, but all in all it was a very good recipe and a definite hit with the family!

I'm from Texas and I have had my share of Chicken Fried Steak. This ranks one of the best I have ever tried! Crispy and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing.
