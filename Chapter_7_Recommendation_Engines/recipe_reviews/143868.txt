Peaches are in season and this recipe is perfect for a stunning presentation and light and virtually fat-free enough to serve with anything. The angel food melts in your mouth. I used 32 ounces of Vanilla yogurt (twice as much as the recipe requires) and a packaged Angel Food cake. The lemon zest perks up the fresh peach flavors. GREAT!!

EASY!! Since now is not the time for fresh peaches, I used can. I'll make again because it was so easy & it doesn't have all the calories of using a pudding.  May try other types of fruit.

Made for Recipe Group. I love, love, loved the dressing part of this. OMG, who knew yogurt could taste so like summer on the tongue! The addition of the pureed peaches and lemon zest to some French Vanilla yougurt made this recipe for me. I used double the dressing to half the peaches and cake for a small trifle. I agree, the dressing needs be at least doubled for the recipe. This was so light, creamy, and cool, with a hint of citrus, just summer on the porch! Thanks for the recipe!

Thanx for the great recipe. Since it is just my wife and I, I made these in one pint mason jars. Cooking for two can sometimes be a challenge, however this was simple. I purchased individual sized angel food cakes (about the size of a large cupcake) from our local grocer, and using a couple of peaches, a few black berries and a few raspberries, i put these together using peach yogurt. Kept in the fridge most of the day, these were nicely chilled by dinner. Will definitely make again.

Recipe Group Selection:  03, August 2013 ~ WOW this is a good one.  I didn't get this made last week, due to being in Texas.  I'm so glad I still went ahead and made this.  I was sooo disappointed in the taste of my peaches.  The lemon juice and zest did help, but that is why I added some red raspberries.  The next time I make this I will double the yogurt mixture.  It had great flavor, I just wish I had more of it.  I served this to 7 people and no one guessed the yogurt mixture, although all of them loved it.  This could be so versatile by mixing up your fresh fruits and yogurts.  As is, this is wonderful and I will be making it again before the fresh peaches are gone.  I just hope for better peaches the next time.  Another plus to this recipe is there is no whipped topping in it.  I like "real" whipped topping, but this is wonderful with the yogurt mixture.  A great pick last week. :o)

this was very easy and tasty, after the first bite, I wanted more yogurt and peach puree, so I would suggest using 1/2 to 3/4 of a large container of yogurt and 1-2 more peaches. I originally used the vanilla yogurt, but when I wanted more, I had peach yogurt, so I used that. Best if tossed together an hour or so before eating.

Loved how it turned out. Awesome fresh flavor.  Now I need to buy some cute dishes to make this more often and serve in. Might try some whipped cream on top next time or toss in a some strawberries on top layer next time.

I substituted sweetened whipped cream for the yogurt, as I didn't have any yogurt and town is too far.  Since I was little, I have always been told that you could put whipped cream on cowpies and people would ask for more.  It was great! I am sure it can be made with any fruit on hand that is fresh.

Recipe Group Selection 8/3/2013 -  This is a very easy and a great use of fresh peaches.  I used “thick and creamy” style vanilla yogurt so I probably should have increased the amount of yogurt, but it was still very good.

I follow the suggestions of others. I used 7 peaches. I added about 1/2 # sliced strawberries to peaches. Are used 32 ounces of vanilla yogurt and added the one cup of puréed peaches to the yogurt. In a trifle bowl, I layered in this order - 1/3 of angel food cake cubes, about 1 1/2 cups yogurt, 1/3 of fruit then repeated 2 more times. Had some leftover yogurt.  Made about 3 hours before serving. Everyone enjoyed it. It served 10 people with at least 2 servings leftover. The next morning the leftover we yummy, almost pudding like as the cake absorbed more moisture.  I am thinking that one could layer the cake and yogurt and fruit in a shallow 13 x 9 glass dish and let it sit a hours or so in the fridge and it would be more pudding-like - a fruity pudding. Could top with toasted coconut etc. I like knowing that recipes can be made well in advance and still be fine.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because the original recipe was off on the amount of yogurt that it would need. Otherwise a great dessert because it’s so simple and yet tasty.

Wonderful, light dessert that sings of summer! I used plain Greek yogurt and added a little sweetener to the peaches and let them set for awhile before I put it all together.

Delicious yogurt/peach peach puree mixture!  I made this  with a Dream Whip yellow cake  which is my go-to cake for any kind of shortcake or non-chocolate trifle.  I also changed the order of the layers and added whipped topping.  I didn't want the cake to be dry.  I did cake cubes, peach yogurt mixture, peaches, a layer of whipped topping  and then repeated the layers, ending with whipped topping and peaches for garnish.  I took it to a party and didn't have any left to bring home!

This is the best!  I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce, it was perfect! I have made it twice now, once with angel food cake I made from a mix, and once with a store bought cake.  Make your own, it is 100x better!

Good - gave it a 4 star because it's just different from a trifle as most are probably used to.  Very easy and a light dessert.  I did use 24 oz of yogurt instead of the 16 and it really wasn't necessary.. Will probably make it again - fresh Carolina peaches!
