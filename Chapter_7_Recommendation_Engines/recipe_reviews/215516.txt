This is a very good recipe.  I used the harissa recipe on this site - easy to make and tastes wonderful. Husband and teenage kids loved it.  There were no left overs.

I changed the recipe a little... I used some hot sauce, chili flakes and chili powder instead of the harissa as it seemed wasteful to make up a batch of it (even a small one) for just a teaspoon. The heat was still present, just less so. I used lemon pepper instead of regular black pepper. Substituted a finely diced green onion for the sweet onion called for. I used 3 tablespoons each of the orange juice and white wine thinking that it might 'steam' some of those flavours into the fish, but I didn't notice them.

Loved it! Moist and tasty. Next time I'll add more Harissa for a stronger kick and make more sauce. The only complaint my family had was they wanted me to double the recipe because the dish was so yummy!

I used a salt based Cajun seasoning instead of Harissa and didn't have smoked paprika so used regular.  It turned out great, but I know using smoked paprika and harissa will make it that much better.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the onions, I will put more on next time.  

It should be browned more than the current picture is showing, it should be more like the authors' picture with dark brown spots.  Mine was only browned well in spots and those were the best spots.  I put some sauce on before onions and lemon and then put the remaining on top of the onions and lemon. 

I will definitely be hunting down some smoked paprika and making this again.  

My salmon was about 3/4" thick - I'm not sure if thinner salmon would work as well because with reduced cooking time the onions wouldn't be cooked.  FYI - I used Kraft Light Miracle Whip.  Served it with brown rice, edamame and a fresh lemon wedge.

Very good .  No white wine as I don't typically have on hand so added more OJ/lemon juice instead. We also have a high tolerance for heat, so increased the amount of harissa just a bit.  It's nice that this can have slight modifications and still be great.  I used Mina Harissa Spicy Traditional Moroccan Red Pepper Sauce.  This is a keeper.  I served with pearl couscous  with lemon zest mixed in and a simple roasted cauliflower.   Cut the onions and lemon slices very thin  - so very, very good.

Wow! This was a different style of cooking salmon for me but man, it was awesome! Turned out incredibly moist and flavorful without being underdone and it came together so quickly! I made a side of simple green beans on the stove while this cooked up and everything was ready in less than 25 minutes. Terrific easy and healthy dinner!

Awesome. The gf and I made it for dinner, served it with steamed cauliflower and roasted sweet potatoes. Light and tasty. Didn't have the lemon slices, so we used orange slices instead--was still super tasty.

Very yummy. Made with yogurt instead of mayonnaise so it was more WW friendly. Used gochuyang for the harissa since itâ€™s what I had on hand. Separate salmon fillets. Sauce was just delicious and so tasty. Came together quickly and result was moist and delicious, even with the changes. My hubby thinks salmon is meh but gobbled this up. Served with roasted sweet potatoes (peeled and cut in large chunks), onions and Brussels sprouts tossed with a little olive oil, salt and herbs that went on a baking sheet in preheated oven while I prepared the fish. Everything was was ready at the same time. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent!  I have been looking for a good Salmon recipe that was more spicy than sweet.  Really enjoyed this...and fairly easy.

Very tasty dish and easy to fix.  Made per recipe except used hot chili sauce since I didn't have Harissa.
