Great little muffin! Fluffy and moist (did some reviewers overmix the batter?), cinnamony, with a light citrus flavor, and just the right amount of sweetness.  I used buttermilk powder rather than fresh buttermilk, which I have always found is a very acceptable substitute. I also used a combination of orange and lemon juice and added an extra 2T. of sugar to compensate for the tartness of the lemon. Thinking it couldn't hurt, I added the zest from half of a small lemon. My only criticism, and I believe noteworthy, is that if using 1/2 tsp. of the cinnamon mixture in the filling as directed, you'll end up with twice as much as you need! My suggestion would be to make half as much rather than add more of the filling to the muffins, but that may be just a personal preference.  These must be good because hubs, who doesn't care for citrusy stuff and doesn't like muffins much either, asked me to hold a few aside for him before I gave the rest away!

Great muffin - but definitely lacking in orange flavor which is disappointing because the combination of spices goes so beautifully with orange....  However, on a bright note these muffins are so moist and full of flavor on their own that next time I would add some orange zest to heighten the orange flavor.  I made this into 6 Texas sized muffins and used turbinado sugar vs. white in the topping to give it an extra crunch. They baked up very nice and the extra cinnamon/brown sugar inside was a nice touch!

HELPFUL TIPS IF YOU'RE SINKING:  Several people mentioned sinking, and if you're not overmixing... it's from putting too much brown sugar in your middle layer, so it sinks...  A mistake I remember for all muffins/crumb cakes.  I use the mixture for the middle AND for the topping to do TWO batches.  I can't imagine using all of it for one.  Outside of that... wow is this quick and easy!!  I fill them to just about the top so there is a nice "muffin top."  Not sure why all muffin recipes say only 2/3rd full or whatever.  Better if you go towards the very top!! Made 10-11 muffins in a normal muffin tin. :)  Also my oven tends to bake fast, so it only took 17 min.

These muffins were pretty good.  They were nice and moist and the streusel was nice on the top.  They did however lack a litlle in flavor.  I agree that they did need a little more orange flavor, maybe the orange zest as someone else suggested or maybe I would use concentrated orange juice with not as much water added to it to make the flavor a little stronger.  I also added chopped pecans into both the cinnamon swirl mixture and the topping, it was very good, added a nice extra and a little crunch.  I will most likely make these again.

I added the zest of one orange to the muffin part of this recipe and I used thawed orange juice concentrate to really bump up the flavor of orange in this recipe. (I read through the reviews before making these and a constant complaint was that it wasn't orange-y enough.) I wisked together the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients seperately, then folded the wet into the dry to prevent overmixing. I used a teaspoon measuring spoon to evenly distribute the topping over all the muffins. These baked up perfectly and everyone just loved them. I did not have any issues with dry muffins. I highly recommend doing what I did and using thawed orange juice concentrate and adding orange zest for more orange flavor.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I received many, many compliments.  I made two double batches for a brunch and every single one disappeared!  My husband was disappointed that we wouldn't be bringing any home!  The good thing is that these are ingredients we have on hand every day, so they will be made often.   The texture and flavor were perfect.  The orange juice adds a subtle flavor, making them more unique.  I accidentally put the cinnamon/sugar mixture in the middle and the brown sugar/butter mixuture on top...they still turned out great!  The small amount of extra time they require is more than worth the terrific results!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

These are beautifully light and tender cinnamon streusel muffins, sweet and very nicely spiced. They actually resemble cupcakes more than muffins, not that that's a negative. The reason I give four stars then, is the complete lack of orange flavor. To my mind, something with orange in the title should taste at least somewhat of orange. As a side note, by following the recipe exactly, I was left with excess cinnamon filling. I also found that the streusel topping was in excess of what it needs to be, but that's more of a personal preference. I cut it in half, which was perfect in my opinion. I would make these again, but would add about a teaspoon of orange zest to the batter as I think the cinnamon and orange together would be a good combination.

These were absolutely delicious!!  I used about a teaspoon of orange zest to enhance the orange flavor.  They were moist, cinnamony, with a hint of orange flavoring.  I even tried them a second time without the streusel topping and they were still good. These are now a breakfast staple at our house.  Thanks!!

With a few adjustments these are 5 stars! I replaced the oil with melted butter, reduced sugar by 1/4 cup, 1 cup of oj in place of the buttermilk and left out the vanilla!  These are great for school and work lunches. I got 24 mini muffins out of this recipe! Next time I will add some raisins and orange zest! Great starter recipe, thanks for sharing! Forgot to mention that I left the topping off all together.  Makes them a bit healthier!

Made these last nite.  By Golly, they were GOOD! Even tho' I reduced the sugar by a tad, used concentrated orange juice plus a bit of lemon zest, nevertheless, I would still give it 5 stars since there ain't no 4 1/2 star rating.  The orange flavour (after tweaking) just comes thru and the cinnamon sugar centre just completely blends with the whole muffin!  If you don't try this, the loss is yours! Thanks so much Michelleca for this recipe.  I am gonna Wow my family & friends with these muffins!

Like many others, I couldn't taste the orange. That's the only reason I didn't give this muffin 5 stars. The muffin, itself, was delish, though. Very moist and the cinnamon and brown sugar in the middle was yummy! Having the cinnamon crunch topping was a perfect way to top these off. I will make these again! :o)

Good recipie.  As suggested I used orange juice concentrate, with only two cans of water (instead of three)and 1 teaspoon dried orange peal.  Still not as orangy as I was hoping for.  But good.   I am going to experiment with maybe pure concentrate. I will also add the center cinnamon mixture after filling the cup up only about a third (instead of 2/3), As the cinnamon tends to rise (almost to the top.) I will make again

I'm suprised that only two people reviewed this recipe. I just made these muffins today and they're absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing to the recipe, either. They took a while to make, but they were worth it. Plus, it made 14 muffins, instead of 12 for me. Thank you Michelle!

They have zero orange-flavor, even though I added extra orange juice, and the crumbly topping was a disaster for me (it melted everywhere.) Also, there was only enough batter for 11 small muffins, without any nice muffin-top.  They stick to the liners.  Cannot recommend this recipe.

I made the muffins without the topping and it was good but not great.. The cinnamon and brown sugar mixture in the middle added flavour. I am sure it will be a great with the topping...

These are very tasty! More dense than I thought they'd be, maybe because of something I did, but I'm not sure what that could have been. The brown sugar/cinnamon mixture made too much for 12 regular sized muffin cups - not a big deal, I just like to not be wasteful if possible. This recipe made 12 rather small muffins - I had to really scrape the bowl to finish the filling the last couple of muffin cups. Next time, I'll make 1.5 times the recipe - double would probably be a little too big. Like some other reviewers I missed a strong orange taste - I'm not a big fan of putting zest in baked goods, so I'll have a think about to improve the orange taste - maybe a couple teaspoons of orange Jell-o powder? In any case, these are pretty good muffins :)

Yum!  These were excellent.  I followed the directions exactly except that I used my food processor to combine everything.  The orange gives it just the slightest tang but isn't overpowering and the cinnamon Steusel is sooo good!  Will definitely make again.

These are really good!  I halved the recipe because I was making several different kinds of muffins today for a thank you gift and didn't want a bunch of any one kind.  Now I wish I had made the whole recipe.  I subbed apple juice for the orange because I'm really not a fan of citrus flavor in baked goods.  I didn't halve the quantity of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture for the middle and I'm glad I didn't.  They are tasty and moist and will be made here again.

These were good!  I added the zest of one large orange, which helped to highlight the flavor.  Also, I used turbinado sugar in the cinnamon topping instead of white and it was a really nice touch!

Yum! Had lots of leftover cinnamon sugar from the inside - could probably half that mix. Use about 1 tsp of the streusel for each muffin.

I agree with most of the reviews...great muffin recipe, but needs an extra orange-y kick, if they are going to be called orange muffins. That being said, I had leftover batter and made mini-muffins out of just the batter (not middle or top layer) and they were quite tasty! The only changes I made were I used applesauce instead of oil and I used a bit more cinnamon in the middle layer. Next time I'll add 1 tsp. orange zest. 
Yum!

Yum! Turned this into coffee cake, used all applesauce. Had to 1.5x the recipe. Very moist and delicious. Will make again.

These muffins were very yummy with one minor addition.  I added about 1/4 cup orange pulp, the muffins stayed moist and the orange flavor really came through.  Aside from that it is an excellent recipe, I will definately make again. Num Num.

Very good little muffins, although I do agree with others that they could use more orange flavor.  Very easy, though.  Either I didn't use enough of the cinnamon sugar mix or the recipe calls for too much; I had about half leftover after spooning it into the middle of the muffins.  I think maybe next time I'll swirl it in.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family and I really enjoyed these muffins.  I made the following changes: used 1/4 cup oil and added applesauce to make 1/3 cup, used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. I also added some orange zest.  I didn't make the streusel but instead made an orange glaze using 1/2 cup icing sugar, 1 tbsp orange juice and more orange zest.

I thought this was a great recipe WITH orange zest added. I zested a tangerine actually, and then used the juice from it as my juice and added undiluted concentrate to make the full half cup. I also used whole wheat flour and some molasses because I used the whole wheat and had no brown sugar. I didn't add the topping, to save on calories, and it was still great.

These were a HUGE hit in our house I didnt use buttermilk just extra OJ to fill in for it and I think it was a good move because they only had a subtle orange flavor with the extra juice so I doubt it would have had enough orange flavor without it, we love them though and they will stay the go to muffin recipe :D

Delicious! Flavourful and moist. A few changes for a slightly "healthier" version: substituted 1/2c whole wheat, did half oil half plain no fat yogurt, reduced sugar by 1/4 c., and used fresh squeezed orange juice. Also added orange zest for more orange flavour. Wonderful!

These muffins were wonderful, very moist. I was disappointed at not really tasting any orange flavor, but if you weren't expecting it you wouldn't know anything was missing. Next time I'll either add some orange zest or leave out the orange altogether.

Great muffins.  Not as much orange flavor as I was looking for, I even added some orange zest, but they still were great.  Well worth the effort of making.

I thought these were really good. I used fresh squeezed orange juice (2 oranges) & added the zest of one orange to the wet ingredients. I also used plain greek yogurt instead of buttermilk as I didn't have any buttermilk. They were delicious! The orange flavor was just right but probably wouldn't have been enough without the zest. As another reviewer said, be sure to put the middle cinnamon stuff on after half filling the muffin tins in order to have enough batter left to cover. Also, the topping is more than enough. I had some left over & was still very generous with it. This made 12 big muffins.

Yummy muffins but other reviewers were right about the lack of orange taste.  I'll try adding orange zest to the batter next time.  NOTE: Be careful not to fill past half the muffin cup the first time, otherwise you'll end up with not enough batter to top the cinnamon layer.  The recipe says half and it means it!  Haha.

These are a little work (instead of just dropping the batter into your cups) but they are incredibly moist (and I didn't even use buttermilk.)  They are anemic looking, but I didn't spread out the streusel very well.

These muffins are delicious! However, I found that I ran out of batter to cover the cinnamon mixture.  Because of that, it may be beneficial to either increase the amount of batter made or decrease the amount that initially goes into the bottom of the muffin cup.

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  I did use orange extract in place of the vanilla extract.  And I used the zest of one orange and these came out so moist and delicious.  I only made half the recipe the first time but will make the whole recipe this time as these are great warm or cold.  Thanks for Sharing...LB

You can not taste the orange in this.  It tasted like a coffee cake in a muffin.  If I make it again I will use some grated orange zest.

I added orange zest to the batter as many reviewers suggested and they turned out wonderful; very moist and loved the cinnamon/sugar inside !  I froze some to have as a quick breakfast on those rushed mornings as going out the door.  Thanks for posting,  MICHELLECA.

I loved these muffins.  I did add orange zest, and would probably use OJ concentrate in the future, as well.  I would suggest this tip in stacking the batter and filling: Put 1 T. batter in the bottom of 12 muffin cups, then add brown sugar/cinnamon filling.  I had extra but went ahead and used it up!  Then top with just under 1/4 c. batter and it should come out just about right!  You may have a tiny bit extra to redistribute.

These are good. :) The swirl is pretty, the flavor is light and they are moist. A nice treat. The first hour they were soft and moist but after a few hours they become dense and rubbery, the kids enjoyed them but you needed water. I tried not to over mix them but perhaps I did? Flavor was good though and swirl was pretty.

I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half AP, and only one egg.  A dozen muffins just doesn't need two eggs.  I added the zest of half a navel orange, based on other reviewers' suggestions.  This gave it a light but quantifiable orange taste.  I think this would be rated higher if the name of it hadn't had "orange" in it - because it's a good muffin, just not orange-y.  It's light if you don't overmix it, and my kidlet loved them.

I rate this recipe 4.5 stars as is.  Quite good.  I added orange zest (about 1/2 tsp) to the topping, added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the batter, and included slivered almonds in the streusel.  Made a big difference.

As written, they were pretty good. I agree, they could be a little orange-ier. I made the orange juice from concentrate and used 2 cans of water instead of 3, I think that this made them a little bitter, so if I do that again, I'll add a little bit more sugar.

really good and very moist muffin.  I used freshly squeezed orange juice , as well as 1/4 tsp of orange extract and 2 tsp of orange rind. orange flavor was perfect. My struesel topping didnt turn out at all, not crumbly more running and melted  non the less it still tasted good.

These were absolutely amazing!  Best recipe on the website! For more orange flavor I added 1 teaspoon Orange extract.  Also, I used soy milk and tofu instead of buttermilk and eggs (food allergies) and they still turned out scrumptious!  Since I have a crazy sweet-tooth, I even drizzled some powdered sugar & soy milk frosting over the top.  I will definitely be making these over and over again!

Excellent recipe!  But of course, I modified it slightly - used orange juice concentrate right from tin (undiluted).  I also used vanilla yogurt in place of buttermilk. I baked them as directed but used mini loaf pans for a great size breakfast muffin.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!
Sep 11/2017: made them today, using orange concentrate straight from the tin, zest of an orange and orange extract.  These additions gave the muffin an intense but not over powering orange flavour!  Quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious!!!

I made exactly as directed and added the zest of two oranges to the liquid mixture.  Yummy!  I did think that there was a little too much cinnamon flavor with the stuesel in the middle and on top.  Next time, I'll cut back on the cinnamon a little.  Great recipe...thanks for sharing.

Delicious, I did exchange apple cider for the orange juice and I didn't have any buttermilk so I used fat-free vanilla yogurt instead and these came out fabulous. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Yummy! I have made these several times now.  Here's the deal: If you use 1/2 C undiluted frozen concentrate instead of the regular oj, you will get a light orange flavor. Otherwise no one I have fed these to can tell there is anything orange in them.  I never have buttermilk so I have substituted with canned milk, whole cream, and sour cream.  The sugar and cinnamon in the middle causes more work than is worth for the little taste it offers.  Just double the crumb topping; that is what my kids love anyway.  If you divide the two teaspoons between soda and powder, you will get a denser muffin (a personal preference).  Also it is very easy to ditch the muffin pan and just make a coffee cake in a greased 8X8 pan.  If you find these muffins dry, you are either baking them too long OR your oven is too hot. Be aware that glass and dark tinted pans also are hotter so adjust your heat and time for that as well.  After your muffs are cool, placing them in an airtight container for a time brings out the moisture and all the flavor!!!  Great recipe Michelleca!

I made them just this morning!  The muffin is very moist; however, I found that you could "taste" the vegetable oil--and I know I did not overpour!  The streusel topping was yummy and I added orange coloring as a previous rater recommended.  I also swapped the vanilla extract for orange and you could really taste the citrus flavor.

These are the new favorite muffin in my house!!!  They are so delicious and moist, and I will be making them again and again.  I made a total of two changes to the recipe:  I used half whole wheat flour (because I feel that something I eat for breakfast should be fairly healthy) and I didn't have buttermilk, so instead I used the same amount of light sour cream.  Delicious!!!

These were WONDERFUL! I'd rate them 4 1/2 stars as is, but that's not an option, so they're 5 stars anyway. 

I added 1 t. orange extract with the vanilla, and I think I'd even add another t. of the orange. 

And I think I might have accidentally used 1 t. of baking powder instead of 2, which made them an absolutely WONDERFUL texture. (We're at high altitude, so we're supposed to reduce leavening, so this may not be a good idea at sea level.)

These were very dry, like a dry homemade cake. Desperately in need of moistness in some form. Try the raspberry streusel muffins from this site instead, but make them with blueberries. Now that's a muffin!

My three year old niece loved these and the adults liked them too.  Not too sweet.  I made the recipe in a mini-muffin pan (baked about 12 min.) and it yielded 38 baby muffins.

Lovely soft,sweet muffins-i forgot to add the butter to the topping and they were still yummy,will add some raisins too next time as they're for my kids lunch bags but found them easy to make and had all ingredients in my kitchen already except buttermilk-will definitely try adding lemon juice to milk instead of scouring the aisles for it as not so easy to get here in the UK,although major supermarkets are ok.

I thought these muffins were great and despite their complexity, they were quick and easy to make.  After reading others' comments about the lack of orange flavor, I added a teaspoon of orange zest, used fresh squeezed orange juice and omitted the vanilla extract.  They came out with a nice orange flavor, but not overpowering.

Very good, and the house smelled so nice while they were baking.  I added cinnamon to the batter.  My topping didn't turn out as expected, but that could very well be my fault.  Will make again, very easy.

Yummy!  These were just like little mini coffee cakes! Be careful you don't put too much batter in the pans the first time, I was two muffins short on the second layer, but no biggie.  The orange was nice, not too overpowering.

Well, actually I was looking for just a cinnamon streusel muffin, so I omitted the orange juice. They were very good that way!  Also, I didn't have buttermilk, so I just used skim milk because that's all I ever have on hand.  This is a really nice breakfast muffin or for a brunch...or just for a snack!  Enjoy them...they are very good.  This recipe is a keeper!

I wanted Michelle who posted the Cinnamon struesel orange muffins to
know that her recipe was great. My junior high school home ec. teacher
more than 15 yrs ago made these same muffins and for yrs. I've brought
recipe books trying to find her recipe and this time I've truly found
it.  Thank you, Michelle. My husband and children loved it, then I
brought some to work and they loved it. 
I don't know, but are you my home ec teacher's daughter. 

PS: Again Thank You.

These are yummy, the first time I made them I couldn't taste the orange, so when I made them again I added some orange extract and peel.  Then I could taste the orange.  I will make them again for sure!

These muffins were great! I made them when a few friends came over and everybody loved them! Two ladies even asked if they could take some home! My husband, who usually doesn't really go for bready stuff, had two fresh out of the oven. I used undiluted concentrated orange juice, which gave a nice, light orange flavor. I put chopped pecans in the streusal, too. I am definitely making these again.

These were really yummy. I had picky eaters take seconds and they were a hit all around. I made this exactly according to recipe. Giving it four stars because literally no one that tried them even knew there was orange juice or anything orange about them. Wanted to try something out of the norm, but they all thought I had made was plain coffeecake muffins. Still a good muffin tho! If I make these again, I might try to increase the orange flavor using zest, or i might just substitute the liquid with plain milk. :)

It was very good taste and texture. Moist and so on.
But, unfortunately that reason I left 3 stars are because no any Orange flavor at all !! I was wondering before make this, it only 1/2 cup of Orange juice. So I really skeptical that flavor finishing. Yes, I was right . No Orange flavor what so ever. Sorry , but Nee more, Flavor to it with this recipe. Otherwise don't do it says " Orange Muffins". Only you can tell that people to " Cinnamon Strussel Muffins .

This was such a great way to start out the day. I added orange zest and I baked it into a coffee cake instead of individual muffins and it was delicious. Will definitely make this one again.

Based on other reviews, I added the zest of one orange, used fresh squeezed OJ, and milk instead of buttermilk. Cupcake like texture, with good flavour.

12-16-15 ~ Needing to make some meals for a family in need, I wanted to add some extras. This muffin was a hit. I baked as minis rather than full size and I didn't use muffin papers. This recipe made 41 minis - more than enough to share with two families. The orange flavor was very mild, even though I added the zest of an entire orange. The next time, I would sub orange extract for the vanilla extract. Flavor was good and they were very moist. I would make this again.

Really a three and a half. After reading the reviews about the muffins not being orangey enough, I added the peel of an entire orange and a quarter teaspoon of orange extract. If I would have had orange juice concentrate I would have used that instead. I stirred the wet ingredients into the dry just long enough to incorporate and the batter was lumpy. I used about half of the filling but wish I would have used a bit more- maybe in two places in the muffin. I did use the entire topping and did not find it too much at all. The muffins rose beautifully domed and I could taste the orange and the cinnamon. The combination reminds me of Christmas. The cooking time was perfect in my oven and it did produce 12 pretty muffins. I might make these again, but I got no "wow" reactions....it's a couple days later now and I have to say they've improved. The orange flavor is much more pronounced. Definitely a 4 star recipe now!

Made them twice. Took the advice about halving the filling and still had some leftover. The second time I made them, left out the filling---they turned out just as nice. This recipe is a keeper!

These turned out really good. They were already gone within minutes of coming out of the oven. They aren't too sweet, but sweet enough for me. Mine didn't sink at all and were moist and yummy.

Fantastic recipe. I was out of oranges the second time I made this, so I used grated lemon zest. Slightly more tart but still an instant winner with husband, kids, and guests. I found the cinnamon mixture makes more than expected, so I ended up putting double as much in the last four muffins. Delicious.

the recipe is great. I've made it many times. But when this system was updated the recipe got messed yup. It's nota 1/4C of flour for the muffins. It's 2C. the 1/4C is for the streusel.  Look for other such errors. I've seen this problem in other recipes too sine the app update!

Very good! I didn't have orange juice on hand, so I doubled the buttermilk, and added orange zest instead. My girls loved them! Will definitely make these again.

These muffins were okay but I won't be making them again.  They were way too sweet and it was like eating a candy bar.  The amount of cinnamon in this recipe was overboard and was too much for this muffin.  Also, I think the orange and cinnamon flavors competed with each other and didn't go well together.  Only two were eaten and the rest were thrown away.

Good! I cut the sugar in the batter to 1/2 c. I also used sour milk for the buttermilk.  Not orang-y, but delicious and just right.  I'd never done streusel before but it was very good.  Executing the 'filling' step was difficult (well, no.  filling the cups only and evenly half full of gloppy batter was difficult), but the result turned out surprisingly well, despite my sloppiness.

Followed the recipe exactly, and they were great! My husband has been eating them non stop, good thing I doubled the recipe! I would agree that there isn't much orange flavor, next time I might add some orange zest as recommended by another user. Also, upon mixing, I only turned a few times so there was still dry mix spots. The muffins rose and crowned beautifully! thank you michelleca!

fluffy, moist and defintely cinnamony with a citrus flavor. I needed to use up both buttermilk and orange juice and found this recipe! I am so glad I did. Followed recipe to a "T" and it made exactly 12 muffins. The only thing negative was the brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkle was way too much for 12 muffin cups. Next time I will just make oly half. Also, I think next time I will add orange zest in the wet batter to kick up the citrusy flavor. I filled the batter 2/3 to the top and added a generous amount of streusel topping. Baked for 22 minutes. All in all a nice muffin. thankyou for sharing this recipe!

I know that they are called "orange cinnamon muffins"... but I had no orange so I used some left over morning coffee as a substitute. I am sooo glad I did! They came out with a slight coffee flavor, also I added maple extract instead of vanilla, again because I didn't have any vanilla. YUM! I also put extra brown sugar in the middle just because that is my favorite part, and also glad i did that. These are TASTY!

Normally I agree with recipes with this high of a rating, but this was a disappointment.  There was hardly any flavor, even with me putting in a lot of extra orange zest.  I just felt like I was eating a bland, oddly textured muffin (elastic instead of crumbly, and I didn't overmix), wishing I could just peel off & only eat the top (with the sugar crumbles).  Won't be doing these again, with all the yummier muffin recipes I've got.  Sorry.

I followed the recipe to the letter and we loved it. But because I made them in two 11 mini-muffin tins, next time I'll double the Streusel and perhaps also add some orange extract to enhance the orange flavor.

Overall a pretty good muffin recipe, despite that I forgot to add the eggs!  They smelled great baking! I felt the recipe needed more orange flavor, some orange extract to replace the vanilla.  The muffins had a nice mellow orange flavor which may be related to the type of orange I used. I reduced the sugar, like I always do with any recipe, to 1/4 c + 1/8 c sugar.  I used Cara Cara oranges for 1 t orange zest (which the recipe did not call for), and for the juice.  For the topping I read other reviewers who said the topping recipe produced too much, so I reduced mine to 1/8 c of each flour and sugar but ended up having to add more to get the topping grainy enough to be used.  I also added 1/2 t orange zest (which the recipe did not call for), which also gave it another hit of orange, added the 1/2 t cinnamon and also put in 1/4 t allspice. I would make this again, but I'd include 1 t orange extract, maybe increase the zest to 1 1/2 t in the batter, increase the zest with the topping to 1 t.  I'd also recommend experimenting with different types of oranges and citrus (you could do a citrus blend).

Only change was to add some orange zest to boost the orange flavor.  These came out moist with the nice added crunch of the steusel on top.  My kids love them!

Oh my word these were sooo good!  I followed the recipe as is (save making one teeenie weeenie mistake by not adding any batter on top of the first  streusel, which really shouldn't have changed the taste anyway.)  They turned out so light and fluffy with just a delicate taste of citrus...no need to change a thing, lovely just lovely...

Very yummy. I used orange juice from concentrate that I barley diluted at all, added some almond extract, and about 1 cup of almonds. Very tasty and tender!

I'm giving these 4 stars because they weren't my favorite but the rest of my family liked them quite a bit.  For me they didn't have enough flavor, but overall great texture.  Next time, I'll experiement with some stronger flavors or add some orange zest instead of just juice to bring out some more orange flavors.

For once in my life, I actually used half of the cinnamon instead of using more!  I wanted something with a good orange flavor and was concerned that the cinnamon would overpower the orange.  I added the zest of one large navel orange to the batter for good measure and actually baked it in a bread pan.  It turned out so well!  Beautiful looking, perfect texture, and with a delicate orange flavor that was complimented rather than overpowered by the cinnamon.  It would be great at Christmas and offer a nice change from the pumpkin bread you usually see.  Next time I may actually add some orange extract or more zest to make the orange flavor a little more obvious, but it really was good this way.  I'm sure it was the zest that gave it the flavor though so don't count on getting orange flavor with just the juice.

Excellent recipe as is.  I think next time I would make them, I would not fill my muffin cups as full.  I would make 14 muffins instead of 12 so that way all that yummy streusel topping doesn't fall off while expanding during baking!  I used a cookie scoop to try to get the right amount of batter in the muffin before putting in the cinnamon,  brown sugar filling and that seemed to be the right amount.  I also had some fresh cranberries, I wanted to use up from a farmers market, so I cut them in half and shoved them into a few of the muffins for an experiment and that added some extra flavor if you like cranberries!

Wonderful, tasty moist muffins.  Great right out of the oven.  Only change I made was I did not have buttermilk so substituted orange yogurt.  We had one just before bed after they came out of the oven and again for breakfast.  Fabulous!

Very good and very easy. The one thing I would change though is to add a whole orange instead of just the juice.  That would give it more of an orange flavour.

I loved the combination of orange and cinnamon in these muffins. I used fresh-squeezed OJ. Delicious as-is, but I just might add the zest of an orange next time for even more flavor! Thanks for a great recipe!

I was going to rate these a 3 because I thought they were a litle dry, even though I baked them for just 20 minutes. But then along came my daughter the cinnamon lover and they just vanished. I used the juice from oranges in my fruit bowl and if I were to do that again I would probably add their zest as well as the flavour was very slight. Thankyou for a recipe my daughter loved.

I love the idea--the streusel especially worked well.  However, I'm not too fond of the texture of the muffin--it's kind of chewy or gummy.  Perhaps I under- or over-mixed it!  The flavor is really nice, especially with the zest of an orange or two mixed in.

tried this recipe twice and it's a flop!!! the muffins were heavy and gummy!! i don't know what went wrong! the 2nd time, for sure i didn't overmix. could it be the homemade buttermilk? we don't have buttermilk in our area. i used 1/2 c milk and 1 1/2 tsp vinegar, stir and let stand for 10 mins. help!!! i know these muffins should be delicious!!! will try for the very last time... change the buttermilk to orange juice. oh, i also put some orange zest and they smelled really yummy! but gummy, no air-pockets! :((((

I followed this recipe almost exactly, though I did add a teaspoon of orange zest to the muffin batter to boost the orange flavor that I love.  The result was a truly beautiful looking muffin that my husband loved, with a nice tang that contrasted well with the cinnamon sugar swirl in the middle and the streusel topping.  Definitely a keeper!

These were fine, but way to much trouble for the flavor it lacked.  I have some other muffin recipes that are much simpler and taste better.  Plus, the orange flavor was so subtle no one even knew it was there.  Maybe add some orange zest with it.

Very moist, but the orange flavor did not come through as strongly as I would have liked.  I made them a second time and added a teaspoon of orange zest.  I brought them to a breakfast meeting and they were gobbled up.  I also made this as a 9" round  coffee cake - came out great.

Very very subtle orange flavor.  I wanted more orange so I added an orange glaze.  Also, I had too much batter, filling and topping.  I had enough ingredients for two more muffins.

Tasty recipe, thank you for sharing!

The batter seemed dry, so I added an extra 1/4 cup milk and a 1/4 cup oil and it still seemed thick. The muffins were very dense, but the tops were outstanding!

Sorry, I tried this twice because the first time I made some changes (plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and lemon instead of orange) and thought they were to blame.  However, the second time I followed the recipe exactly and they were still not great.  There was no detectable orange flavor and while the muffins were not 'bad', they were very plain and boring.  I will be trying this one again.

Perfect. Just pour a cup of tea, and you've got it made.

These were okay muffins. I added cranberries & orange zest to mine since I wanted more of a 'punch'-I used 3/4 cup of cranberries but should have used more-like 1 1/4 cups, I think.  I didn't use the streudal topping since I was short on time maybe that would make the difference.  After serving them at a baby shower, I came home and tried them again and thought they were quite dry...maybe it was something I did wrong??  I still gave it 4 stars since I didn't make the topping and maybe that was my mistake. Sorry!

These were very tasty.  I used alternative flours for my gluten sensitive family.  I did not add the topping and they were still a hit.

Great  muffin! I was looking for a basic cinnamon muffin and was afraid of an orange taste so instead of orange juice I added a mixure of pinapple and pear juice. You couldn't taste it  anyway.I also added more cinnamon in the batter. The cinnamon and brown sugar  swirl in the center is fantastic. My husband and kids loved it! It takes a little extra effort but I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Very tasty, easy to make.  I added 1 TBLE of orange zest to the wet ingredients and used 2% milk instead of the buttermilk (it was what I had). We prefer jumbo muffins and this recipe makes a very generously sized treat.  The amount of streusel was just right.

There are so many good reviews on this recipe that I waited two days to do mine. I think that the taste of orange and cinnamon somehow doesnt go togeher well. I used undiluted orange concentrate to get good orange flavour which I did, but I do not like it with cinnamon. I wish I would have used just orange juice not to taste it as much. However they were really moist and even third day they tasted the same as first (I just put them in the fridge in zip log bag) Cinnamon topping was really nice and crunchy on the top. I might use it for other muffins but I do not think that I will do these again.

I added the zezt of one orange to the recipe to give it some extra tang.  The texture is really great, and I love the crumbly topping!

Just okay.  Not enough orange flavor.  I made my low-fat by replacing the oil with applesauce.  These were decent, but nothing to write home about.

This recipe was okay, but I found the muffins a bit on the dry side.  I made them in the afternoon and brought them the next morning to a function and didn't feel they tasted fresh after that period of time.  There was absolutely no orange taste in them.

These tasted great, but all the streusel decided to sink to the bottom of the muffins while they cooked!

I added orange juice concentrate to the OJ, but would still have liked a stronger orange flavor. My husband thought they were great as they were.  Loved the cinnamon/sugar inside!

Just finished making these! They are very good and I'm not usually a muffin fan, but these sounded yummy and I was not disappointed. I used undiluted orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice, and got a very nice orange flavour.

Just the right amount of batter - I love that.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, followed everything else to a T, and these are delightful, like little miniature cinnamon crunch coffee cakes.  Totally yummy.
