This is so freaky !!! I have used this exact recipe for 10 years!!Except I do one thing differrent,I roll the balls in a combination of 1 cup sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon..Makes all the difference in the world. I bought a paperback recipe book at the dollar store and this recipe was in it. I  have been doing fairs for 7 years and won 6 blue ribbons with this recipe. A family favorite.

Best oatmeal cookie I've ever made!  I used real butter, toasted my walnuts before adding them and then chilled the dough for 20 minutes before rolling into balls.  Cookies stay chewy and moist after baking.  Great flavor, sure to stay a family favorite.

I am pleased with the way these cookies turned out.  I did as another reviewer suggested and rolled them in cinnamon/sugar and they both look and taste very nice.  I soaked the raisin mixture overnight and that seemed to turn out well.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening which was fine...

Oh, if you don't like rich/sweet cookies, these probably aren't for you, but if you do, I think this recipe is worth a try.  

EDIT:  The next day, these cookies were still soft and chewy.  My husband says these are the best oatmeal cookies he's ever had, and he doesn't say that sort of thing lightly!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made and ever tased...bar none!!  I omitted the walnuts because we don't like them.  My husband has forbid me from making them again unless we give the majority of them away because he could not stop eating them.

Hands down, THE best oatmeal cookie I have tried. I don't use raisins but instead sub in choc chips or butterscotch chips. Awesome. You can also roll the balls of doung in sugar before baking for a nice shiny crisp outside and tender inside. FIVE stars all the way!! Add ingredients as directed!!

Ok, you've heard it before in other reviews but it bears repeating- these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had! LOL! And I don't even like oatmeal cookies that much. I made them for my DH who loves them and after one cookie he said, "Wow! These are really good!" I think this will be our recipe from now on. I did sub chocolate chips for raisins but otherwise followed directions exactly. Baked on pampered chef stone for 14 minutes first batch and 12-13 minutes following batches. YUM. I'm going to go eat some more!

Excellent oatmeal cookie recipe!  I got this recipe back when it was just cookierecipe.com and am still using it b/c of the rave reviews I get from everyone I give them to!  Each year people ask specifically for these cookies...even wives ask me for the recipe so they can try to make them for the husbands who always ask for mine!!

Yummy! I used parchment paper, 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of sliced almonds. This tastes gourmet. Thanks! By the way, I used a Pampered Chef small scooper and this made 69 cookies.

I have tried several 5-star recipes over the past few months and have been disappointed every time.  But not with this recipe.  I followed the recipe, but used butter instead of shortening and used old-fashioned oatmeal instead of quick cooking.  The cookies are delicious.  Crisp on the outer edge and soft and chewy in the middle.  Thanks so much.  I don't think I need to search for any more oatmeal cookie recipes.  My kids are gobbling them up.

I don't like oatmeal cookies....at least not until I met up with THESE oatmeal cookies!  Awesome.
I made them for my Dad for Father's Day, and he said they were just like he dreamed of ....though he wasn't sure he had actually ever had any this good in real life!  They ARE a dream come true, soft, chewy, a hint of spice, and the raisins are sweet and plump.
With all the good reviews, it seemed silly to comment, but they were SO good, I just had to add my opinion.
I guess I like oatmeal cookies, now!  Can't wait to make them again.

I seem to have a million friends who love Oatmeal Raisin cookies, so I decided to try this recipe out on them.  They all loved it!!  Be aware, this recipe looks really dry as you mix in the oatmeal, but leave it alone - it will turn into a really nice dough.  I've swapped out the raisins for cinnamon chips and roasted pecans, and it turns out just as yummy.

This is by far the BEST recipe I've ever used.  I've been baking for more than 30 years and this recipe was easy to follow and by far tastes the best!  I can see how it's a blue ribbon winner!

These are delicious! I substituted butter for the shortening, though, and I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. I didn't use walnuts, so I think next time I will use 1 1/2 of raisins instead of 1 cup; doesn't seem like there are enough raisins. Followed the advice of previous person and coated the balled cookie dough in sugar and cinnamon. Really makes them look pretty and taste even better than they already do!

Awesome cookies. I was looking for a recipe that only called for 2 cups oats and picked this one. I left out the raisins because my boys don't like them. I added the eggs into the creamed butter and sugar then followed the recipe. I added 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. Super super yummy. Thanks for a keeper.

I've been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe and, after numerous failures, I've finally found it. I made only minor changes, replacing half the shortening with butter, adding a dash of nutmeg, and leaving out the nuts. I thought it strange to refrigerate and soak the raisins in the egg and vanilla, however I believe it served two purposes. The raisins were plumped and, by adding the egg/raisin mixture at the end, it helped to cool the dough so that the edges would not spread during baking. These cookies are wonderful and as another reviewer stated, they do actually taste better the 2nd day. Thanks for the recipe Sheryl!

This is the first review that I have ever done on here and this recipe is fabulous.  I went hunting one day for an Oatmeal Cookie recipe and this was the one I deceided on.  It was well worth it.  These cookies disappeared faster than I could bake them.  I did make a couple of changes only because I always do that.  I used butter and cut back on salt, toasted the walnuts, added 1/2 tsp of cloves and nutmeg, added 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips.  I dipped the rolled balls of cookie dough in a mixture of 1/2 cup of sugar and 2-3 tsp of cinammon.  Cooked for 11 minutes and dusted the cookie pans with flour before putting on the cookies.  I pressed each cookie lightly with a fork. I would give this a five star rating

Moist and tender cookie when baked for 9 minutes.  Only change I made was to roll in cinnamon and sugar before baking.  These cookies were a hit!

This was a very good and delicious recipe. I made some modications per other's suggestions and also added some twists of my own. Instead of the 1 cup brown/ 1 cup white sugar as per recipe, I used 1 cup brown, to keep the color and taste, and 1/2 cup white. I then used 3 tablespoons of honey and added it at the very end of the mixing. I added an additional cup of oats and also substituted 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat. The result was absolutely delicious and healthy too! The cookie came out with a nuttier/grainier texture with the additional oats and wheat flour. The honey made the cookie  creamier and more natural tasting. I made a batch of 24 cookies as I made bigger cookies. Also, when placed on the cookie sheet, I pressed them down a bit to make them  bigger as they pretty much stayed the same shape while baking. All in all a great yummy recipe. Thank you very much!

I baked these for 2 years for family, friends and co-workers before I ever ate any. I thought they were all nuts when they swore this was the best cookie they had ever eaten. I use this dough recipe for chocolate chip and every other combination of chip and nut cookie.

I don't know whether I should thank you endlessly, or curse you for introducing this recipe into my kitchen.  These cookies were so delicious!  I ate ten of them the night I made them.  I'm glad they're gone now, so I can have some self control again.

An interesting technique. A delicious cookie. I doubled the nuts and added the grated rind of one large orange. Thanks for the recipe!

Only the best Oatmeal cookies I have ever made!  My Husband loves them, and I made them for family for the Holidays and they all loved them too.  I have made them twice since.

Soaking the raisins is a fantastic idea, they are so chewy.  I soaked them over night, so I had to add a little water to the recipe since the eggs were soaked into the raisins a little too much, but soaking them for the one hour I wouldn't have to add any water.

Came out perfect, even at high altitude.  I noticed I had to cook them for 2-3 minutes more.  The dough is dry, but I found that I could roll the dough into balls with my hands instead of using a spoon.

This is my new go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.  Oatmeal chocolate chips are my husband's favourites, so I substituted the raisins for chocolate chips but they were still super delicious!  I might just have to make myself a batch with raisins so I don't have to share!!  LOL

Thanks for the great recipe, Happygolucky!

None of the reviews that I read have mentioned that the process of soaking the raisins in the eggs and vanilla infuses them with the vanilla flavor that you can really taste in the cookie.  Because I think this is what makes these cookies so special, I was wondering what you do if you are using chocolate chips instead of raisins?  Nothing to soak...just combine the egg and vanilla for an hour?

Excellent cookies! Like others I subbed butter for lard, left out the walnuts and added chocolate chips as well as raisins. I also decreased the white sugar to half. Wonderful! I will use this recipe again for sure.

FINALLY an oatmeal raisin cookie that is soft and chewy without having to fiddle with my oven and timer!  This basic recipe is a tad unusual to me because of more eggs and flour and less oats.  Except for using a half teaspoon more of vanilla (which is my preference..not to bash the cook here that shared this recipe) and didn't refrigerate the eggs/vanilla/raisins, I followed the ingredient amounts.  I did however, change what I did AFTER I mixed it up. In other words, I basically treated this recipe as I would the recipe on the oatmeal box but using the amount of ingredients in this recipe here and not refrigerating anything.  I also hate rolling balls, so I just dropped by teaspoons onto the greased baking sheet.  To me, having a perfect oatmeal cookie isn't a perfectly round cookie..but rather, odd shapes after dropping it. :)  Been making cookies since I was 8, and I am now 61...so I am used to cookies not uniform except peanut butter cookies.  :)  ANYWAY, this cookie turned out soooo yummy...chewy in the middle and crunchier on the outside, which to me is a perfect oatmeal raisin cookie.  THIS cookie is a DEFINITE KEEPER!!!  Thank you for sharing! I bow down to you :)

This is a very flavorful recipe.  Easy to make. I never tried Putting the eggs and raisins together and this made all the difference in the world! Our raisins were a little hard but soaking them made them plump and juicy. I also rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar, and this small step also seemed to make a huge difference in taste and texture. This will definitely be the oatmeal recipe I use from now on. Many thanks!

I have tried so many oatmeal cookies recipes and this one is the BEST by far!  I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening (I didn't have any on hand) and I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins.  These cookies were downright addicting!!!!

I haven't baked in years but was looking for a cookie recipe for my children's school class holiday celebrations.  I have never been crazy about oatmeal cookies but decided I would make them as a healthier alternative to sugar or chocolate chip cookies.  I chose this recipe given the rave reviews and I was pleasantly surprised.  They are delicious!!  I also used whole wheat flour for added fiber.  If you use whole wheat flour it's suggested that you use 1 part whole wheat flour to 2 parts all-purpose flour as a substitution in any recipe.  So you would continue to use the all-purpose flour but you can use less of it because you're substituting a portion with wheat flour.  I used "King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour" brand.  In addition to walnuts and raisins I also used dried cranberries and they were absolutely delicious.  The cranberries taste like candy in the cookies. Enjoy! I definitely recommend this recipe with my added tips to make it even more healthy.

Too time consuming when I already have a great recipe, but wanted to try it. I think I needed to cream the sugar much more than I did (by hand) because it was so dry I couldn't even add all of the oats! Three eggs are the only liquid! Not sure I will try again.

I don't know why anyone would give this less than 5 stars! Anyone who knows me, knows that I hate raisins. I have never had any use for oatmeal raisin cookies, but my husband likes them, so I have been searching for good recipes. I taste tested these before he got home, and I couldn't stay out of them! The raisins are not over powering at all, and you HAVE to take the advice of other reviewers and roll them in a sugar cinnamon mixture before baking. The only other thing I changed was I added about 2 Tbsp of butter in with the butter flavored shortening because it wasn't creaming the way I would like. Bake 9-10 minutes for perfectly chewy cookies!

Delicious.  They have less oats and more cookie than other oatmeal cookies I've had which was a nice change but not sure if this is going to be "the" recipe.  Very good cookies though.  Wasn't dissapointed at all.

These were perfect!  Thanks to the other reviewer for the tip about rolling them in the sugar mix (I've been doing that with other cookies and muffins since then and it's wonderful!)... I will most definitely make these again.

I might be the only one rating this recipe so low, but it didn't work for me. I wanted more oaty taste, they also turned out quite thin and grey. They were tasty, but not enough to make them again.

A Family favorite. I usually make the dough on Sundays and then my husband gets fresh baked cookies for dessert day of the every week. I use 1/2 cup less oats because we like our cookies a little less dry, and golden raisins instead of regular since they aren't as tough.

These aren't the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had, but they are very good.  I used cranberries instead of raisins and butter rather than shortening and I think that those were good changes.  My biggest problem with this recipe is that I found the cookies to be a little salty and a little too sweet (I tend to reduce sugar in most recipes, though).  Next time I will cut back on both salt and sugar, add more nuts, and use some whole wheat flour to make it a heartier cookie.  Overall, I think this is a good base with excellent texture somewhere between cake and chewy.  Soaking the dried cranberries in the egg/vanilla really did give them a plump look and better texture..

This is a good, basic oatmeal cookie, and I'll keep the recipe.  Maybe since I used butter, the first batch really spread, way too much for me. I like fat cookies, so to fix that, I put an extra cup more flour in the dough, and it worked.

Everyone truly enjoyed these.  Terrific recipe as is.  I also made them with a 50/50 mix of butter and shortening, an extra 1/2 cup of raisins, and 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  Tasted better than those from a high brow bakery.

5 stars if you use butter, 4 stars if you don't.  In the words of my husband after trying the batch made with butter - "Wow!"

This is the most amazing oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever made.  My husband, father and sister's fiance fight over them.  I added a 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips to mine.  I chopped the chips up a bit with the mixer that I was using.  This gives them a creamier, richer, butterscotchier taste.  Excellent!  Also, for Thanksgiving, I made the dough ahead of time, froze it, then made them the day ahead.  They came out great.

Very good! I was a little put off by how crumbly the dough was, and since I am not a baker, I assumed that I had messed up. The dough does come together with handling though, for anyone with the same concerns. They have a texture to them after they are baked; a bit fibrous, which is different that what I would have considered the ‘right texture’. But, make a batch, let them rest a little and then enjoy them with a glass of cold milk and you will settle back in your chair and say “Oh this is good, very good” Thanks Sheryl!

Excellent Cookies!!! I made a few changes since we have tried to cut sugar out of our diet.  I used wheat flour and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and used butter instead of crisco.  They turned out great.  I was really impressed with the flavor.  My kids love them!!!

Great cookies, but they were still raw inside at 12 minutes. I had them bake for 15 minutes at 350 in a gas oven and they were fine, still chewy on the inside. Looks like a family favorite!

This is absolutely the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe I have made.  We don't like raisins so they were omitted but followed the rest exactly and they came out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside just the way we like them.  This is the only oatmeal cookie I'll bake now.

I made these last night and my husband and I both really liked them.  I then brought them to work this morning and the VP of my company said "I've died and gone to cookie heaven".  Now I think that means they're good!  The only thing I did differently was that I used real butter instead of the shortening.

These were a hit!  My only regret is that I forgot to buy raisins:-)  Everyone loved these; I replaced the shortening, however, with butter.  I will make these again and again throughout the year.

These cookies were so good.  My daughter hates raisins, she even picked them out and said how delicious they were.  They were'nt overpowered by spices. DELICIOUS!  I am making some tonight and will substitute chololated chips for the raisins.

In a word? DIVINE!! I seem to be the only one with the opposite problem of those who experienced dry dough. Mine was so moist that I had to add about a quarter cup extra flour to be able to work with it. I did one thing, though, that may or may not have accounted for this. I mixed the raisins in the eggs and vanilla as directed, covered it, then refrigerated...and refrigerated! I forgot about it for almost two days! When I remembered and retrieved it, the eggs had completely soaked into the raisins. Don't know if that accounted for the extra-moist dough. The problem was easily remedied with the addition of the extra quarter cup of flour. The next time I make them, presumably with the proper soak timing, I'll amend this review to report the results if different. Additionally, I only keep regular, rolled oats in the house, but no matter. Lovely, soft cookies, with a hearty chewiness that is wholesome, appealing and satisfying. Cookie jar cookies, if they last that long!

I have used this recipe for years.  It is the only one that I have found that is just how I like them.  Soft and chewy.  One reviewer stated that her husband forbids her from making them cause he can not stop eating them.  LOL that is my problem.

Great recipe! I used only a few raisins as I needed the dough for mincemeat cookies and they turned out delicious soft cookies with wonderful texture. I mixed about 1 1/2 Cup prepared mincemeat into 3/4 of the dough loosely, i.e., not mixed thoroughly. Make small balls (acorn size) of the regular dough and smash them into small thin circles to make a base, then place a small walnut-size amount of the mincemeat mixed dough on top. Bake as usual. Made without the base the mincemeat cookies were too sticky on the bottom and not cookie-like. With the base of regular dough, the mincemeat cookies were perfect. Chilling helped. Next time I will use more oatmeal, less flour.
-----
2nd time making them: Used 1/2 C less flour and 1/2C more oatmeal, plus a tablespoon or two of orange zest. Used butter, no shortening and put the raisins into the mincemeat along with some chopped dried up old figs I had rehydrated in orange juice.  Dropped a half teaspoon or so mincemeat onto each base piece and topped with the small walnut-size bit of the dough (some of the dough was mixed with mincemeat already, but wanted more mincemeat per cookie.)  Not necessary to pat down or shape the dough -- it just melts down over the filling and the base to form into lovely round and delicious cookies!  Baked 12 minutes, but one cookie sheet full I forgot the timer and baked them to just short of burning -- this produced a dark crisp cookie that was delicious, too!  Also I always use (and re-use) parchment pape

I have made these cookies hundreds of times. They are to die for! I never have used the "butter-flavored"  shortening because I only have regular shortening so I have always just sprayed a little bit of butter flavor pam on top of the shortening during that step. Recently I tried 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup of wheat flour to see what difference it made. I thought they tasted just as good and could not tell the difference. Also, I usually let the raisins stand in with the vanilla and 2 beaten eggs and then add the 3rd egg during when combining the raisin/egg in the recipe. I have accidentally left the raisins/vanilla/egg mixture in the fridge for a whole day and a half, and the end result was just as fabulous. Sometimes I roll the balls in the cinnamon/sugar when I have the time. Either way, the recipe as is is still 5 stars! Thanks!!

Yes, this one is the best. I used to use the one on the Quaker Oats box. I tried this. My husband said, "These are the best cookies." Yes, they are.  I added pumpkin pie spice.

Great oatmeal cookie, made a little differently than from the recipe on the Quaker Oatmeal box (more flour, less oatmeal). I added a second teaspoon of cinnamon and also added a quarter cup of milk mixed with a quarter teaspoon of cider vinegar (and one time, a quarter cup of buttermilk) because the mixture is too dry to adhere otherwise. I made it with  real unsalted butter instead of butter flavored shortening.  I used an ice cream scoop to measure out the dough, flattening each with an oil-coated spatula. This made 24 large cookies--about the size you get in coffee shops. Baked them for 18 minutes. Fabulous!

Excellent, because i didn't have time to refrigerate the egg with the raisins I boiled the raisins for 3 min. drained them and proceeded with the recipe. Per one of the reviews I also used only a 1/2 c sugar with a tsp of cinnamon to roll the cookie dough ball in instead of a cup of sugar and had plenty

I was surprised at how stiff the dough was, but they turned out well. In my oven/pans they browned too fast, so I lowered the temp to 325 and baked them an extra minute. Turned out perfectly! Next time, though, I'll probably add another 1/2 cup of raisins.

Omitted raisins first time, skipped 1st step.  Cookies were awesome, chewy 3 days later.  We're high alt. (6800 ft), so added 1/4 c xtra flour.Didnt turn out thin and crispy like most of my cookies.

Used raisins second time.  Just as good - raisins plump and delicious.

Positively the BEST! My family gobbled them up as fast as I could make them. I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and had to omit the walnuts due to an allergy but all else was the same. Just fantastic, even without the nuts! My husband is not a fan of sweets and could not keep his hands out of the cookie jar :)

WOW! These are the BEST oatmeal cookies! Many who said they didnt like oatmeal cookies loved these. I used 1/2 salted butter and 1/2 regular shortning- I (didnt have butter flavored shortning)-I did roll in the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I can't say enough about these. Easy & Delicious! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

OMG! - I baked these for a church bake sale and they were a huge hit. And to top it off, my husband who isn't a big oatmeal cookie fan says that these were the best oatmeal cookies he's ever tasted in his entire life. Thanks for the recipe.
I did make one additional change besides using butter as opposed to shortening, I also added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder and dropped by 1/4 cup measure to make jumbo cookies.  I adjusted the temperature to 340 degrees F and baked for 15 minutes.  They appear to be a little underdone but are perfect after they cool and set. - DELICIOUS!

I don't know what happened with mine. The dough was extremely dry and stiff. They did not melt down during backing at all. I tested 4 balls at first and they came out balls. The next batch I mashed down and they came out dry.

Super yummy!  I don't care for raisins, so used craisins instead.  Next time I may add some choc. chips to the batter.  I also think these would be great naked...just plain ol' oatmeal cookies!  Don't forget an ice cold glass of milk with these!  :-)

I would say my results were based on user error or maybe it was just a bad day to bake.  I had a hard time working the dough. Then baking from 350 for 10 min, increasing to 375 for 8 min - cookies were flat either way.  Taste okay but not very appealing.

I've made this recipe more often than I could count. It is by far my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe, and one of my favorite cookie recipes overall.

Even people who don't like oatmeal cookies like these.

Amazing.

took a little longer to cook than the 10-12 minutes. I must have made them too big.. Nonetheless, perfect cookies, perfect flavor and texture.  Wonderful recipe.

These were awesome!! The only thing I did differently was I added 1 cup of carob chips when I added the oats, and omitted the raisins. They were pretty good for being dairy free!

These are the perfect oatmeal raisin cookies. Crisp on the edges and soft in the middle. Only modification I made was I used butter instead of butter flavored shortening, only because that was what I had in the house. Yummy!

Best oatmeal cookie I've ever made!!! Thought I would pass out while tasting the first! LOL! I followed the recipe exactly on the first batch, kinda botched the second not paying attention to the order in which things should be mixed in... So be advised, the order is very important!   Thanks Happygolucky!! I will definitely make these again.

These cookies are simply delicious.  My children just loved them and got a good review from a little girl that doesn't normally like oatmeal cookies.  I followed the recipe as is but used butter instead of shortening.  YUMMY!!!!

Ok I tried. I really tried to like these cookies, however, they are missing something... I made them 2 different times, thinking maybe I goofed on the first batch? I like a chewy, oaty, cookie, that is soft. These were cake like and something is missing....they were rather bland tasting.

These were great- as everyone says.  I cooked 11 minutes instead of 12 so they were softer.  Used milk chocolate chips.  Overall, great flavor.  This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Thanks very much.  This is THE oatmeal cookie recipe I've been looking for.  They are perfect.  Used a 1.5 in cookie scoop, baked for exactly 9 minutes. Crisp on outside, soft inside. Very tasty. Will toss out all other oatmeal cookie recipes I have ever tried!

They were very good when eaten on the same day.  But, very hard the following days.  Maybe next time I'll try the white-bread-in-the-cookie-jar trick.

This really is a very good oatmeal cookie! I chose this recipe over others as it has only a single spice, cinnamon, and I want an oatmeal cookie that takes like oatmeal.  Also, any recipe that has the word "grandmother" in it makes me look twice.  The cookie is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, perhaps a bit too sweet for me (I will cut down the sugars by 1/4 cup each next time, I think).  I omitted the walnuts because I think they don't belong in an oatmeal cookie.  I only made 3 1/2 dozen out of this batch, but we like a larger cookie!
Thank you for the submission!

I make these cookies for barbecues, dinner parties, board game nights, birthday presents, holidays, you name it!  I ALWAYS get compliments, and more than one person has specifically asked me to make another batch for the next get together.  I like to make these cookies using margarine instead of shortening, I throw in a few chocolate chips (white and milk), and I usually throw in a different combination of dried fruits to replace the walnuts: chopped up dates and dried mango, raisins, dried cranberries, chopped up apricots...anything and everything works with these cookies, and they turn out perfectly every time!  The batch is huge, but they freeze very well and any leftovers will be eaten VERY quickly!

My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe. I don't put in raisins or nuts- and it makes the best cookies. The only oatmeal cookie recipe I use anymore!

These were delicious! First time i've ever made them and i definately will continue making them. I used baking raisins instead of regular ones. They're plumper and more moist than regular ones and the bag is one cup so no measuring. I also might add more cinnamon next time i make them. Wonderful cookie!!
EDIT: I've been making these for at least 3 yrs now for my best friends birthday. She requests them every yr and keeps them in her bedroom so she can eat them in the middle of the night and not have to get up. lol

These are fantastic! I didn't have Crisco, so I used half butter, half oil, and I didn't use walnuts, I used almonds as that's what I had. I put in chocolate chips instead of raisins because I live with a bunch of raisin haters. The cookies are chewey and delicious and stay like that for several days. I will definitely make them again! Thanks.

These are definately some of the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used a baking stone...bad idea the first batch took FOREVER to bake and still seemed to turn out soggy.  I used a regular cookie sheet for the remaining batches and they turned out FAB!  I also substituted butter for the shortening, chocolate chips for the raisins, and left out the nuts...YUMMY!

I didn't have nuts, so I substituted 1/2 cup rolled oats.  I also added nutmeg/cloves/cardamom (pinch of each)and 2 tablespoons of oil since it looked a little dry.  These cookies were SO GOOD!  The perfect texture, didn't spread too much, nice and chewy with crisp edges.  A half recipe made 15 big cookies, we ate them all within a day.  Thanks Sheryl!!

These were pretty good but not amazing.  We ommitted the nuts & the chocolate chips, just as a taste preference.  I definitely recommend using parchment paper.

Nice flavor and texture. I subbed choc chips for raisins and nuts. Note - definitely need to grease the pan if usung a cookie mold. I didn't per the instructions and it was a disaster. The ones I baked on a regular sheet came off fine.

I, too, used craisins and butter and omitted the nuts, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Wow  - I didn't think oatmeal cookies could turn out so moist and delicious. My husband loves them, and he doesn't particularly like sweets.  Thanks so much!

My husband isn't big on cookies but he just devoured these.  I also used butter instead of shortening, but only used half a cup (oversight on my part), instead of the one cup as indicated in the recipe.  Didn't matter - the cookies were moist, chewy and Y U M M Y!!

Great recipe..The dough was not dry at all for me..In fact it was a little too moist to form balls with.. I had to use a teaspoon to form balls with it. I found I didn't have any vanilla extract in my cupboard and these still tasted awesome. I made them yesterday and still are moist and chewy. :)

I adore these cookies as-is, but do yourself a favor and make them with dried cranberries - amazing!  

I use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out the dough - is much faster. About halfway through baking, I smush them slightly with a slotted spatula, giving them nice little ridges on top.  

The butter-flavored shortening is key - regular flavor doesn't cut it.

I started making these two years ago, and my hubby won't let me even think of trying another recipe.

VERY VERY GOOD. Not too sweet, and although I had my doubts because the mix appeared to be too dry, when I baked it, the cookies moisture seeped out. The browning is also quite nice and the taste is excellent. Instead of raisins, I used dry mixed fruit so every time I bite into a cookie I get a pineapple, date, grape, or peach. Mmm!

These cookies are great and the recipe does actually make the amount of cookies that it says it will (without the cookies being the size of a quarter). I overbaked the first batch by a couple of minutes but placed a piece of bread in the container with them and they were very soft after that. My fiancee loves them as well. Thank you for the great recipe.

The *BEST* Oatmeal Cookie recipe! I've been searching for one that's chewy and with a hint of spices, and this one is it!! I usually make the first 12 plain, then add Hershey's Cinnamon Chips to the rest of the dough and they are out of this world! They will be gone in NO time, my 18 month old just loves these. Almost always makes exactly 4 dozen, depending on how much dough is eaten by my household before they get to the oven. :-)

Very tasty recipe! I didn't know if this recipe would turn out, the dough was thick and hard to mix but cookies came out nice and chewy after 11 minutes. To make the dough easier to handle, I  refrigerated it for at least an hour before shaping into balls, Terrific recipe!

Very disappointing!  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I thought these were too 'cakey' with not a lot of flavor.  I thought 2-1/2 cups flour was a lot for oatmeal cookies, and I think I would try adding only 1-1/2 cups with an extra cup of oatmeal.  I read the other reviews so maybe its my oven(?)

I just finished making a batch and they are fantastic.  The golden brown color and crispness on the outside are wonderful. I'd recommend "under cooking" them a bit if you want a little more chew on the inside. I accidentally put 3/4 teaspoon more cinamon in the mix but it tastes perfect.
I can't wait for my family to come home and taste these!

yum!  a bit strange to add the egg last instead of mixing it in with the butter and sugar, but it worked out fine (just a little bit more effort to mix it).  a very mild, buttery cookie.  the oatmeal seems more like an afterthought than the main feature, but that's kind of nice.  and they're definitely addictive--I just found myself eating a fourth one and I just finished taking the last pan out.  next time I might try it with white chocolate chunks.

Great recipe!  I added an extra egg the second time I made them to make them a little softer.

These were really really good. The batter was kind of dry though, was it supposed to be? It would fall apart when I tried to form a ball but the turned out great anyway.

These got great reviews by my family.  I used butter instead of shortening and had lots of leftover dried cranberries, so used those instead of raisins.  Soft, chewy and delicious.

This is a great base recipe. I did not have quick cooking oats, we only eat old fashioned oats here, so I roughly ground them in my blender to improve the texture of my cookies. Also, no brown sugar in the pantry so I added a running over tablespoon of molasses to 2 cups of white sugar. For my spices I did a full tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger, and a scanty sprinkle each of nutmeg, clove, and allspice. We are trying out palm shortening in our baked goods this baking season because we already use so much butter my budget couldn’t handle it. My husband and kids said they were the most wonderful cookies they ever had!

These are awesome cookies! I don’t normally go for oatmeal cookies but it was a craving I had, and wow! Glad I found this recipe. I followed to the recipe to a T, with the exception of subbing craisins for raisins and I added white chocolate chips, they turned out SO good! The “dough” was really dry for me and I was worried but went forward anyway and they turned out chewy, moist and just oh so good! I also made my balls of dough a touch bigger so cook time had to be added. Perfect time for me was 18 and a half minutes. Try these, you won’t be sorry.

Like another reviewer stated, these were a lot of work! I was hoping that they would taste good after I baked them, and thank goodness they did. I do think the dough was a little dry, and I think I would try it again with  just 2 cups of flour. I assume you are soaking the raisins when you refrigerate them with the eggs and vanilla. Overall pretty tasty cookies!

Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite  and this recipe beats all the others I have tasted.  Everyone I gave them to loved them.   I followed the recipe except I used butter and did not add nuts as a friend has a nut allergy.

I prefer crispy oatmeal cookies, but my husband has always preferred chewy cookies. I have looked for a good recipe for years, my search is over! 

The only thing I changed about the recipe was to use butter rather than shortening. They turned out perfectly. Two days later, they are still soft and chewy and the bast part - my husband loves them!

These were pretty good, but I ended up adding more oats in after the first batch came out of the oven.  They didn't spread, so I pushed them down before baking.  Rolling them in cinnamon sugar does make a nice  outer layer.

The taste of baking soda was too strong. Will make it with baking powder next time.  Also the amount of flour was too much as compared to oats. They tasted like flour cookies not oatmeal.

I subbed Pamela's gf flour for the all-purpose.  I liked the idea to soak the raisins in the eggs.  I had to really dig in and knead the dough to get all the flour incorporate.  Nice tender crunch and moist center.  Makes a lot, so I refrigerated the majority of the dough and bake a panful to get a really fresh cookie when I want it.

Sooo disappointed.  Not sure what I did wrong, but my cookies didn't flatten out and I ended up with cookie 'balls'.  I tried cooking them a bit longer, but no difference.  I followed the recipe exactly, too!

Love this recipe!  And so does my husband! They are very sweet, so I add just 3/4 cup of both white and brown sugar.  Could probably cut that even more.

Very good recipe, however, I did not mix my raisins, eggs & vanilla to refrigerate them. That seemed odd to me. I creamed the shortening, with the sugars, added my vanilla, & room temp eggs. While doing this my raisins sat plumping in hot water. Then I put them in a sieve to thoroughly drain as I mixed & added the dry ingred. (not the oatmeal) to the mix along with the nuts & eventually the raisins. Then added the oatmeal It was a very soft dough. I refrigerated the bowl for about 1.5hrs. It was a nice med soft dough when I scooped medium size balls (heaping teaspoon size scooper). I rolled half in cinnamon, half plain. Recipe made about 8doz  2.5 inch cookies. BOTH were yummy. Neither of us could choose which we liked the best. It did take the full 12min to bake in my oven. I'd check each sheet at 10min, but left each one for additional 2min. They looked close to overdone, one of those "whew, I got them just in time" moments,  a deep golden brown, BUT it gives them a nice crisp bite, with a chewy center, and they remained the same the next day(s). Didn't get hard. Great recipe!

I just made these this morning and they are seriously good.  I had to make a couple of adjustments based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I had to use butter instead of shortening and chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I actually think I'd prefer them with raisins.  The texture of these cookies is fantastic.  They are a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.   I baked them for about 12 minutes though my cookies were probably a little bigger than the walnut size recommended.  Beware this dough seems really dry when mixing but it comes together when you make them into balls and bakes up just perfect.

Best oatmeal cookie recipe I have found.  I even substituted butter for the butter flavored shortening (which I did not have) and it still worked out great.  Enjoy.

This is an excellent oatmeal cookie recipe that you can easily customize to your tastes or adapt to the ingredients you have on hand. I've made it several times as it is written (though I use butter, not shortening). I've also made it with chocolate chips instead of the raisins, a little shredded coconut, and one time I threw in the last of a jar of tahini, about a quarter of a cup. It's incredibly versatile.

VERY Very good.  I don't have the time or energy to do side by side comparisons with other cookies.    I also remember being very happy with the one inside the oatmeal container.
---
Second time.  Very disappointed.  Cooked thin and stuck to pan.  Differences I can think of
Didn't put vanilla into the egg/raisin 
First time, I had a kitchenAid that only did high.  Today, all arm.
Perfectly fine for snacking, but because of the sticking; not presentation quality. :( :( :(

My husband & son love these!  I used the suggestions of blueribbon girl, KATIANA & NEISHACL. Toast the walnuts, used real butter, cut salt to 1/2 tsp.,  chill the dough, roll the balls before baking in 1 cup of white sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon (I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg to cinn/sugar). Don't skip soaking the raisins, it helps to make these fantastic!

Great reviews on this cookie - even from non cookie eaters! I followed the advice of one reviewer and rolled the balls in cinnamon sugar before baking AND I added a half cup of spiced rum to the dough. Kicked it up at least a notch!

Fabulous!  I made the recipe exactly as outlined and to quote my husband "these are the best cookies you've ever made."  Hydrating the raisins made a big difference too. Don't skip the step.  Just the right amount of sweetness, softness, crispness, texture. I highly recommend them!!!

I am not an oatmeal/rasin cookie kinda guy, but my wife loves them so took a chance with this recipe and made some for her. I did use imperial margarine instead of buttery flavoured shortening also,  I chilled  the batter for about 20 minutes and then  to half the balls I rolled the balls in sugar and cinnamon. Both turned out very delicious and chewy which of coarse is the only way she will eat them but personally I liked the cinnamon and sugar ones better.  Her comment was plain and simple and staight to the point...... They were better then Tim Hortons cookies...... I guess it's a keeper.  I thought they were great aswell.
Thank you.

These are the most amazing cookies that I have ever had and my husband just told me the same thing also--I used real butter because I don't use anything else for baking and I dipped the dough balls in a sugar and cinnamon mixture before baking like another reviewer did--AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING---this is a keeper for ever-I doubt that there is any other recipe like this one THANK you so much for sharing and God bless you!!!

These can be made allergy friendly by substituting flax eggs for the eggs and sunflower seeds for the walnuts.  They are also super yummy using chopped dates instead of raisins!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever had. There is a mellow richness to them that is incredible. I think it must be soaking the raisins in the egg/vanilla mixture that makes them so good.

Great recipe! I was skeptical about adding the eggs to the mixture after adding flour instead of with the sugar mixture but they turned out great. I used half whole wheat flour, butter in stead of shortening, and also used craisins/pumpkin seeds instead of raisins/walnuts. I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. Delicious recipe!

I used salted butter instead (used 1/2 tsp of actual salt instead) of shortening.  These are amazing! So many people commented how great these were.  Highly recommend.  I really am not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies but these are soo good.

As other reviews had said, I too rolled my cookies in a cinnamon and sugar mixture after leaving in the fridge before rolling. I had never done that with oatmeal cookies, but I will definitely continue to do so!! My dad loved them! They came out soft and chewy and were even better the next day! Only other change was omitting the raisins. Overall, great recipe! Will use again!

Great oatmeal cookies!  I'm not a fan of raisins or walnuts in my desserts, so I omitted those ingredients but they still turned out amazing!  Instead, I decided to 'ice' these cookies, which got mixed reviews with my friends and families.  Most felt the cookie was fine on it's own.  Mix 1 cup of sifted powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, and 2 to 4 tbsp. of milk.  Makes a great glaze you rub over the top of each cookie with a spoon.

Beats ANY other oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever made.  If you put them in a metal tin they stay moist and delicious for DAYS though they rarely last that long.  I ALWAYS make a double batch b/c they go so fast.  The ONLY substitutions I make are to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, and I omit the nuts b/c I don't like them.  I don't know if it is the soaking of the raisins in the eggs or what but these truly are the absolute BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted!

These came out really good. They were a little soft and sticking together in storage but that doesn't really matter...as long as they taste good...and they do! The only thing I changed was I chopped up Rollos candies and threw them into the dough. The bites with caramel and chocolate in them are a treat!

Delicious! Followed recipe exactly except didn't have butter flavored shortening so substituted 8 tbsp butter and 8 tbsp shortening for the 1 cup measurement. Don't flatten these too much with the fork otherwise they'll be too flat. Thanks for the recipe!

Without a doubt, the best oatmeal cookie I've ever tried!!!! I used the advise of other reviewers and changed the shortening for unsalted butter and it worked!!!! I have to admit at first I was a little skeptic about the dough but they turn out really good.

Great recipe!  I used butter, old fashioned rolled oats, and a mixture of raisins, dried cranberries and chocolate chips.  I also used half whole wheat flour, half white.  Next time I will add nuts or toasted sunflower seed for crunch.  I did the mixing in my food processor with the dough blade.  Just had to finish stirring the oats in by hand in a bowl as my processor was full.

I made these cookies to get rid of a bunch of oatmeal that I had.  I used half raisins and half chocolate chips; and these cookies were more popular than my much-requested chocolate chip cookies.  very tasty!

Hmmmmm...not sure what went wrong, but I was not "wowed" by these cookies. I had to cut the flour by 1/2 cup because the mixture was so dry I could not stir it anymore! I used dates instead of walnuts. They were pretty, but tasted like any other homemade oatmeal cookies.

This is the BEST recipe ever!  I have been making these as gifts this year because of so many compliments I have recieved.  NOTE:  The first time I made these, I let the raisins soak overnight.  They swelled so much that I had to blend them with a mixer, they broke up in the dough and infused through the entire cookie in small bits.  That was a mistake I'll do every time now, since it made a moister, tastier cookie than the rest of the times I have made them with raisins soaking 1 hr.

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. This recipe made about 60 cookies. I made them for a 12 hour road trip & they were ALL GONE before we got there. I took a suggestion to roll the dough balls in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and I liked that better than just plain. 
This is my new standard oatmeal cookie recipe.

I made these last year and printed out the recipe. I didn't have enough brown sugar, so used 1/2 cup brown and 1-1/2 cups of white. I made a note on the card of the sugar change. They turned out perfectly. I got 73 cookies. These are my husbands favorite. I have a batch in the oven now.

after reading the reviews on this cookie I chose this recipe over several others to bake. It is tasty,but not the best oatmeal cookie I have eaten, and is kind of pale in color, not robust... will try another recipe next time.

Excellent cookie!  I made these for my husband's birthday and he loved them.  

I didn't have butter-flavored shortening on hand, so I too used butter sticks and the cookies came out great.

These cookies are amazing! My parents and boyfriend absolutely LOVE them.  Since I didn't have butter-flavored shortening, I used regular butter. My only regret is halfing the recipe because they're almost gone! I'm going to bake some more now. :)

This is so freaky that I saw this recipe on here!!!!!!! This is the same recipe that I use but,one thing I do different is I roll the balls in a combination of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 cup of sugar.It makes all the difference in the world.Either way is good. This recipe  I bought from a paperback recipe book from the dollar store 10 years ago. I have won 7 blue ribbons for this recipe at fairs I compete in. Smiles to all!!!!!!!!!

These are very good....the only changes I made were to use real butter (3/4 c.), whole wheat flour and old fashioned oats. They come out soft and chewy and are quite a crowd pleaser! Thanks!!

These were great.  Not the best I've had but many of my friends said they had never tasted better.  I wouldn't recommend refridgerating the dough and baking at a later time.  Make the 4 dozen all at once when the dough is at room temp. or else the cookies will not flaten out while baking.  The only thing I didn't like about these cookies was that it seemed as though I could feel the consistency of the granulated sugar while chewing.  Other than that, fabulous taste.

I have been hunting for the perfect chewy oatmeal cookie recipe for years and have finally found it! I omitted the raisins (hubby doesn't like them) and fell short in oats so I substituted with 1/2 - 3/4 cup of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal. I also don't keep butter flavored shortening so I used 1/2 c margarine and 1/2 c regular shortening. They were delicious! Even without my changes, these are the best oatmeal cookies ever! My mother-in-law, who is the best baker I have met, asked for this recipe!! Now if I could stop eating them...

I am not a fan of oatmeal cookies, but these are very good.  I added just a pinch of ground cloves to the recipe and baked them on a pizza stone.  They came out fantastic.

These are the best! I subsitute 1/2 C of the white flour with whole graham flour, chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and along with the raisins I add 1 C chocolate chips. I'm not sure how healthy they are, but they taste terrific.

I found this recipe last year, but didn't have tested til yesterday.  I have to give it a five stars.  It is very good.  Big, soft and chewy oatmeal cookie.  I bought it to work to sales for fun raising.  It sure sold fast.  Thanks.

Very easy to make.  Moist delicious and chewy.  For me, however, this is not THE ONE.  I want a more oaty flavour this tasted a little generic, primarily like a sugar cookie, I  will keep searching

Great cookies and they look fabulous also.  We used butter instead of shortening and added a few chocolate chips.  Great cookies!

I made these for my husband and father-in-law for Father's Day.  My husband hates raisins so I thought about adding chocolate chips, but my father-in-law hates chocolate (I know, weird)so I added butterscotch chips and they turned out great.  I also omitted the nuts.  Nobody could stop eating these!  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks.

Awesome oatmeal cookies!! I substituted margerine for shortening & deleted the nuts & raisins. I added a 1/2 cup extra oatmeal to compensate for fewer ingredients. I also kept the dough in the fridge until each batch was ready to go in the oven. (This will help minimize the spreading.)
My family loved them. I will definitely make these again!

I made these for my Dad because oatmeal cookies are his favorite and they turned out great. I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 butter flavored shortening & they turned out great. I baked mine for about 14 minutes though.

Really great recipe ... husband and coworkers really enjoyed them! Batter was very dry, but came together nicely. Only change I will make is to add plenty more raisins next time, as indicated by other reviewers.

A delicious cookie and one that reminds me of the cookies you get in an upscale bakery.  I substituted craisins for raisins and added an extra half a cup.  I also added a cup and a half of chopped white chocolate.  As I do with most cookies, I slightly underbaked these.  I love the cinnamon flavor.  Delicious!

This is a good recipe. I omitted the nuts, and added a tiny bit of extra water, to get the last of the vanilla/egg out of the bowl. I did not have any shortening. I used 1 stick of Country Crock, and 1 stick of real butter instead.

FABULOUS recipe.  My husband doesn't care for raisins, so I ommitted the raisins...and I ran out of chocolate chips...so made them without raisins, chocolate chips, or nuts. And they were STILL delicious!  I didn't have to add/substitute anything.  I used margarine and it worked fine.  These are DEFINITELY my favorite oatmeal cookies!  Great right out of the oven.  THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!!  I am sharing this recipe with my friends & family.

I like that these cookies have that nice cinnamony "bite" to them that distinguishes good oatmeal raisin cookies. I could have gobbled up the whole tray, they're so yummy. Five stars.

Very good.  Raisins get nice and plump.  I let them soak for about 2 hours.  I also added about 1/2 cup extra raisins.

I have tried many oatmeal cookie recipes, but have found this to be the very best!  The extra step of placing the raisins in the vanilla and eggs for an hour or more, really moistens and plumps up the raisins.  Interesting recipe, awesome results.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Sheryl.

Yummy delicious! I used butter instead of shortening and mixed everything in one bowl at the same time (no fridge time). Omitted raisins and walnuts, added chocolate chips at the end. Excellent, easy and quick to make. Thanks.

These cookies are the BEST!!! I brought some into work and they haven't stopped asking me for more. The second time I made them I added about 1/2 cup more raisins.  They have the best flavor and are nice and soft and chewy.

The BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  All other attempts have yielded hockey pucks, but these are awesome & easy.  I used 3/4 c real butter & 1/4 c shortening, and used a very generous cup of raisins.  A huge hit w/my family.

This is an AWESOME oatmeal cookie recipe.  They are soft and delicious!  I used splenda instead of sugar. I did not have any raisins but I did put in some chocolate chips.  Kids went NUTS over them!  These are fool proof cookies because I cannot make oatmeal cookies.  Just follow the recipe and they are wonderful!!

I finally found the perfect oatmeal cookie recipe. Crisp on the edges and chewy in the middle.  I added an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of raisins after baking the first batch.  Just be sure to soak them in warm water til soft them squeeze out excess water.  Dried cranberries were good in these cookies also.  Thank You for sharing.

I cannot believe all the 5 star ratings for these cookies.  They were just ok.  To me, they tasted like chocolate chip cookie dough with cinnamon and raisins and very little oatmeal.  I'm sorry, but I like my oatmeal cookies with lots of oatmeal.  I would not make these again.

I didn't have the patience to roll the sticky dough into balls and didn't care how they looked, I just wanted the cookies to be done so I could eat them.  So I dropped walnut sized blobs of dough onto the baking sheet.  Made them without raisins and nuts because I didn't have any.  They are so sweet and good just as they are, nice and chewy.

I LOVE this recipe.  I made it last year for Christmas and everyone raved that it was the best oatmeal cookie they had ever tasted.  I couldn't find the recipe this year and I panicked.  I got back on the website and found it!!!  This truly is the best recipe for oatmeal cookies.

These are absoulutly the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.  I usually use the recipe on the oatmeal container. Those are good, but these are awesome. You must try this.  I did make them a little bigger than in the recipe so cooked them a little longer, but turned out perfect!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  I thought I had done something wrong during the recipe as it seemed so dry, but after adding the egg and baking, they are wonderful.  Perfectly crispy edges and soft oatmeal cookie inside.  They keep well days and days later are just as wonderful as when they were first made.  This is my oatmeal cookie recipe from now on.  I need look no further.  Outstanding!

These are incredibly delicious!  Like bakery!  Crunchy outside, chewy/soft inside.  I have used butter if I don't have shortening and they turn out good as well.   Also I used a little less sugar.  A must try!

I found the dough very soft and sticky, too soft to roll into a ball.  But it IS the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever had.  Just take them off the cookie sheet as soon as they come out of the oven.  They will get crispy very fast and stick to the sheet

Turned out very good.  However, you have to really watch the baking time.  I learned the hard way that there is a fine line between not-quite-set and burned.

These cookies were very delicious!  They have a great texture...not too chewy, but they don't turn hard either.  I prefer chocolate chips, so I deleted the cinnamon, raisins and walnuts and put in a cup or so of semi-sweet chocolate chips the second time I made them.  Otherwise, it is a great recipe!

When I first made these, we thought they were VERY bland and not worth eating...I had them in an airtight container, ready to throw them away, when I tried another cookie the following morning and decided they were much better the next day.  Still not a favorite, though

Absolutely the BEST Oatmeal cookie recipe ever.  They seemed too soft to get off the cookie sheet, but I used parchment paper and they turned out great.  Even after 6 days they are still moist and delicious.

These were the best oatmeal cookies ever.  I don't like raisins so I omitted them but followed still refrigerated the eggs and vanilla.  I added chocolate chips to one batch since I normally love chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies.  However, the plain oatmeal was so fabulous, it didn't need anything else.  I will keep this recipe and make them whenever I can find an excuse.

This was my first time making oatmeal cookies and it was so easy!  These cookies are delicious! I made them for my boyfriend who LOVES oatmeal cookies and he practically inhaled them!

A very good recipe.  The dough was a little crumbly and I had to flatten the cookies instead of baking them in balls as the recipe said, but it turned out very well.  It's also very very good if you add a cup of peanut butter.  =)

THESE WERE AWESOME! I would add more raisins and a little less white sugar, had to cook them for almost 15 minutes too.

Very good recipe. A freind brought me some Oatmeal cookies she had baked and I liked them better. But! She used Pillsbury cookie dough to make them. For homemade though, this is the best recipe I've come across.

The dough was dry and hard to work with and I willa dmit was quite skeptical.  They took forever to cook and I just figured I would throw away the batch and then I tasted one, two, three, twelve.. you get the idea.  They are so flavorful, and totally unforgettable.  My guests are already requesting more!!

Just baked a batch of these cookies, and they are fantastic!  I think next time I'll need to double to recipe, they are just so good, I don't think they'll last!  Thanks for this recipe!

They were ok, but just didn't care for them.  We thought the cinnamon was a bit much.

Delicious!  Chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Not too dry and crumbly like other recipes I've tried.

Fabulous.  They were even better the next day if you can believe that!  My husband is the ultimate oatmeal/raisin cookie fanatic and liked these a lot!  Thanks Sheryl.

These were the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted.  I used walnuts even though I don't usually care for them and still thought the cookies were delicious!
