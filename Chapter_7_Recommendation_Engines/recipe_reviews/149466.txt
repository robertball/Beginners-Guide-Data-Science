I've gone over & over this recipe, trying to figure out what went wrong. It just wouldn't set up, kept adding powdered sugar, tried putting in the fridge. Frosting pooled around the bottom, none stayed put in the middle - just an ugly mess. Nice flavor but won't try this one again.

This was super good, light, creamy and fluffy.  Try it without the coconut really good too.

Great frosting for chocolate and coconut lovers!  I used it in place of the traditional German Chocolate Cake frosting and it was delicious.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This recipe was perfect - let me tell you why. First, if following the recipe exactly, it sets perfectly. Make sure your cream cheese, butter and milk are blended well together. You may have to scrape the bowl a few times in order to get every morsel of each the butter and cream cheese blended. After you mix the coco and coconut together (once again scraping the bowl so everything is well mixed), it will seem like it's too thick. This is NORMAL. Do NOT add any more liquid ingredients to thin it out. When you add the sugar, the mix actually thins a bit. You'd think it was the opposite way around, but I assure you it is not. Not only does it thin to perfect spreading consistency, the added sugar gives it a beautiful glossy satin look. This recipe is amazing not only because it sets to well, but because of its flavor. Think of it - 1.5 cups of powdered sugar is unheard of in most quick frosting recipes. This frosting is creamy and sweet, but only lightly and not overpoweringly cloying like many other sugary frostings. Make it - you will love it.

I had no problems with it setting up like a few other reviewers reported, though I was a little worried it might not until I added the coco powder.  It had a nice creamy texture, spread beautifully, and was more than I needed to ice my 9x13 sheet cake.  As for the flavor, it was just "ok" for me.  It is a nice quick frosting in a pinch, but just held no WOW factor.

Had similar issue with frosting not setting. Made the recipe exactly the way it was posted, minus the cocoa (wanted a white frosting) and it wouldn't set.  I put it on cupcakes for a party and they were very hard to transport. The frosting went everywhere, and 'melted' by the time I reached my destination. I tried fixing it, even threw them in the freezer. Also, the taste of cream cheese was very strong. Not sure if it was because there was no cocoa, but it was as though I put melted cream cheese on cupcakes. Not my proudest culinary moment.

Used this on a birthday cake was a nice change, very light and not too sweet!  Everyone loved it!  Don't know why some had trouble?  I would have just added a little more cocoa powder.

I used this frosting on my husband's chocolate birthday cake last night. He loved it (and he's usually hard to please)! I followed a suggestion by the author of the recipe and spread it on the cake before I baked it. The frosting came out warm and gooey on the hot cake. I am very happy with the results!

This is a great recipe.  I had no problems with it setting up.  I added vanilla and it is still light and fluffy.  Next time I will use dark cocoa powder though.

Very rich in chocolate flavor, but without overwhelming sweetness if you follow the recipe exactly

No problems setting, I made it and frosted my cake without any troubles at all. I used coconut cream instead of milk though. It was the taste and texture that I found just ok . I think it may be a four star recipe without the coconut. Thank you cocoa monkey for your recipe.

For those who had problems with the frosting not setting up properly, this often happens with light or spreadable cream cheese. The best stuff is the kind that comes in a brick. Also, omitting the cocoa powder without substituting it with something else, like rice flour or cornstarch, will make a much thinner frosting. Cocoa powder is a deceptively strong binder; altering the amount of it in brownies, for instance, can take them from gooey to super dry with just a couple of tablespoons. Otherwise, I'm not sure what went wrong, and I'm so sorry it made a mess of your cupcakes!

Fluffy like a whipped cream frosting!  Easy to spread on a cake and has a silky texture on the tongue.  Frosted a double layer chocolate coconut cake and topped with toasted shaved coconut!

So Good and easy. Used sweetened coconut-that's what I had on hand.  Only used 2 TEASPOONS of milk.  Plenty thick, and even a bit glossy!  I keep performing QA tests, just to make sure... ;)

I used sweetened cocoa powder and sweetened coconut because that is what I had.  Just used less
powdered sugar.  Loved it.
