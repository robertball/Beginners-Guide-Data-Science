This was delicious! I chose it because it was one of the only recipes that did not need to be marinated for at least 4 hours.  Since I work full-time, I only had about 2 1/2 hours until mealtime.  My husband and son loved it - the coating was tasty and the pan juice was not burned, but just right and also delicious.  I did modify the recipe in 2 ways - I seared it at 450 for about 15 minutes, then turned the temp down to 325 and cooked until 150 internal temp, and I added a little evoo to the rub to make it more spreadable and add a little crisp.  The lamb turned out perfect - I saved this recipe in my favorites and will DEFINITELY make it again! :)

I MUST give this one 5 stars. This recipe is fantastic. I made it today as an early Valentine's dinner and it was a hit. The only change I made was to press a couple cloves of garlic into the dill/rosemary rub. The dish turned out tender, juicy, and tasty. I served it with seasoned potatoes and corn. Will make again - an easy way to impress dinner guests. Try this one, you definitely won't be disappointed.

Very tasty lamb roast. I had a 4 lb. boneless roast and I had to cook it an hour longer than the recipe stated and I tripled the garlic, but still is an excellent recipe. I served the lamb with garlic mashed poatoes and mint sauce for the lamb. Thanks.

Excellent.  Best lamb recipe I've found.  I actually use it on lamb chops as opposed to the whole roast, and fry them in hot oil just to sear the outsides and keep it nice and pink on the inside.

I prepared the Lamb using the recipe last night.  My wife who is from England and they eat lamb all the time has mentioned that this was the best Lamb she has eaten in a very long while.  Very easy to prepare.  Thank you.

I modified this slightly - I had a 4.5 lb leg of lamb and used 20 cloves total.  I cut them in half and inserted them all over.  This recipe doesn't call for nearly enough (I'm a huge fan.)  I didn't realize I was out of dill, so I just made a rub of 3 tsps dried rosemary, a little olive oil and some salt/pepper (not sure on amounts...just to "taste").  I started it at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and then turned it down to 350-375 (my oven is not reliable).   When I turned the heat down, I added some red potatoes & carrots to the pan.   I basted the lamb with a cup of beer (hefe).  The temperature & beer are based off the recipe "Dragon's Leg of Lamb with Garlic and Beer" on this site.  I took it out after about 1 1/2 hours total because my temperature was 150.  And I loved the flavor I got on the potatoes/carrots due to the basting I did with the beer/juices at the bottom.   I wish I would have added more veggies to my pan.

Wonderful easy recipe.  I brought a gorgeous boneless lamb joint (I am one of those people who hates bones in anything) and followed the recipe exactly.  The only changes was that I used sea salt chunks rather than ordinary salt.  The lamb was just so tender, loved the rosemary garlic taste.  Will certainly be making this again.

This is really tasty. I made this for my first lamb roast ever and i must add that i dont have much experience cooking. Cooking meat scares me but i decided to face that fear with this recipe. I used all the ingredients listed but also added fresh thyme chopped on top. With the suggestion of another reviewer, i added olive oil to the rub to make it easier to spread on the lamb leg. I also cooked it at 450 for 15 mins to brown and then the rest of the time at 350. Next time i would use a bit less salt but i did use coarse sea salt instead of normal salt. Maybe 1 teaspoon instead next time. Overall,, very good! I usually have a problem with making meat too bland but this was great!

I probably doubled the garlic since the cloves were small.  You definitely do not want to skimp on the garlic.  Serve with green tail onions.

I bought a leg of lamb to smoke in my Cookshack and decided to try this rub!  OH MY GOODNESS!  The lamb was so much more flavorful than the brisket I did- and I don't like these kinds of meat!!  My mom who only eats chicken and some beef ranted about this and said it was better than the brisket!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

This was good, I made it for Easter. My internal temp said 150 but it still came out a little too red for some guests on the inside but the flavor was good. I did add EVOO to the rub as well. I think part of the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the lamb leg, it was a lot of bone, and that's not the recipe's fault obviously. I'll have to try a different leg of lamb next time, you'd think Kuwait would have a good selection! But overall everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Easy and delicious! I made this for a family Easter get-together, and everyone loved it. I actually prepped it the night before, stuck it in the fridge, and popped it in the oven on Sunday. I also used fresh dill since I had some on hand, and I think that made it even more flavorful.

Easy and delicious.  Remember that it's going to continue to cook a fair amount as it rests.  I took ours out too late and it was closer to well then the med-rare I was after but the great flavor of the rub saved it.  Thanks!

It was good, but I was really looking for a wow factor.  I agree with another poster that it doesn't have enough garlic.  I doubled it and it could have used more.  Also, I used fresh dill and rosemary and bound the rub with a bit of olive oil.  Good, but not amazing sad to say.

Really delicious. Just a personal preference but I would take it out of the oven at about 148 degrees or so. I left it in until the thermometer read 154 and it was just a little too done. But really good flavor. Thanks for the recipe DICIA!

This was quick and easy and very good.  I'm not a dill fan, but tried it anyways.  Real glad I did, loved it !  I grilled chops and made this as a rub.  Did add a dash of cayenne to this rub.  We raise and sell lamb and I'm trying out new recipes, this is a keeper.

I must admit I was a little hesitant to try this since its such an expensive cut of meat and my hubby claims he hates rosemay but I'm glad I did!  The aroma created such high expectations when the family walked in and it did not disappoint! My leg was only 2.5 lbs so I changed the serving size to 4 to get the right spice amounts. After the rub, I let it sit at room temp 30 min as suggested by another lamb recipe.  I ended up adding a little extra minced garlic onto the top.  Like others, I browned it for 15 min at 450 first then turned it down to 325 per my package directions.  I then added yukon gold potatoes, quartered, and baby carrots coated with safflower oil, garlic powder, salt and crushed rosemary, similiar to the roasted potato recipe on this site.  I removed the lamb at 150 and tented it while the veggies finished cooking.  My entire family loved it and said its another favorite!

LOVE this herb crust for lamb.  This is almost identical, except for the garlic, to the recipe I've been using for years from the Betty Crocker cookbook.  I make True Lancashire Hot Pot from this site with the leftovers.

Delicious!  I made this twice over the weekend (hosted 2 different Easter parties) and it was very well received both days.  The first time, I made it with a boneless lamb leg, and the second time I used a bone-in leg.  The boneless was far easier to carve, so overall I would recommend using that if possible.  The only change I made was to put a little olive oil over the meat before applying the rub.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I do not really care for lamb, but we've really WANTED to like it. I bought a leg of lamb on sale and was trying to make something phenomenal. This was it! We both ate more than one piece, and we had to stop the children! I didn't change anything, but I used all the same amounts for a 3 lb. leg. Cooking time was the same.

I love this recipe. I add a bit of olive oil to the rub to make it stick better. I cook it a bit less - more like 140 when I pull it out. The temperature will go up about 5-10 degrees as it sits. Also - make sure your cloves of garlic are big if you only use 3 and slice very thinly. Delicious!

I had a lamb shoulder roast which was still half frozen so I cooked it covered in a casserole dish with a little water on 425 for 30 minutes and then on 375 for 1.5 hours. The result was a delicious juicy roast!

Everyone raved when I made this! It's an awesome recipe. I cooked the lamb in the roasting pan with potatoes and carrots. I drizzled oil and sprinkled salt and pepper on top of the vegetables. I also had only  a 4 lbs. lamb, but I still had to cook it for 2 1/2 hours.

Really good.  We got a slice of leg of lamb (~1 lb), reduced the oven time to about 40 minutes, and cut the rub size in about 1/3.  Very happy with the results.

This was AMAZING!  I first marinated the lamb in a herb garlic marinade then sprinkled the seasonings on while it was still moist from the marinade then put it on the BBQ rotisserie.  It was succulent! We couldn't stop nibbling even after we were full.

This turned out really tasty though wasn't falling off the bone as much as I would have liked.  But the whole family liked it just the same and it was quite tender.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

An extra clove or two of garlic doesn't hurt the recipe. It was the first time I've ever made lamb, and everyone loved it! The meat was tender and moist, and the flavors were incredible.

Easy and quick recipe! I did add another clove of garlic and a pinch of basil in the rub. Came out fantastic and family loved it, even the kids. We will definitely be making again.

This recipe was great. Only changes I made were getting a lamb roast and using garlic salt instead of using the cloves of garlic.

My wife and I really love this rub.  We use it 2-3 times a month on lamb shoulder chops.  I added some parsley to the rub, and it worked out very well.  Also, instead of baking, I grill the chops until they are somewhere between medium and medium well, and I let them "rest' for about 5 - 10 minutes before eating.

Delicious. I cooked a 4 lb leg for 2 hours. Next time I think I'll only cook it for 1.5 hours.

This is the first time that I cooked lamb, and it came out rather tough. I probably overcooked it. But the rub is absolutely heavenly. Delicious!

I've mde this 3 times now and it is amazing. The first time we were given a leg of lamb because no one around knew how to make it or just didn't like it. i found this recipe and it was an instant hit. Last night I made it for New Years at my dad's request. We had to adjust some things because the leg was bone in this time and the oven wasn't and option so we used a large cooker my dad has, but after we made those adjustments it was as good as before. I just love this recipe and I highly recommend it.

I made this two Easter's ago for my family, and they loved it. They didn't even know that it was lamb. So I decided to make it again for Thanksgiving. It was tasty and a great choice.

Family loved this.  Following a couple of other reviews I cut in half the garlic cloves instead of slicing.  I also allowed the leg to marinate in the rub for about one hour.  Roasted on the BBQ.  Will be making again.

Excellent! Add a little salt before eating and it is perfect!  I cooked it to about 150 degrees instead of 155 and it was to our liking perfectly!
