My grandmother also made this and I am a great granny now. It is delicious except she made a sauce using 2 c. water--2 Tbl.corn starch, 1/2 c. sugar-- and either a couple of Tbl. whiskey or 1 tsp. vanilla.

Very close to my Grandmother's pudding. The sauce she made for it was 1cup water,1cup sugar,1/2cup butter or margarine. Boil & thicken with either 2 Tablespoons flour or cornstarch. Add 2 Tablespoons vinegar, 1 teaspoon vanilla & nutmeg to taste. Serve sauce just warmed.Sauce also good over warm gengerbread.

Our family has a long-held tradition.  Suet pudding is served after Christmas dinner.  Just before serving, apricot or peach brandy is dribbled onto the pudding.  The lights are dimmed, the pudding is lit with a match and the family enjoys a short show of blue flames before the lights come back on and the pudding is served with cream sauce, as described in the recipe.  There is no set amount of brandy in the recipe I was given.  A little goes a long way!

My Grandma Erma used to make this when I was younger and I haven't had it in years! I was excited to find this recipe and set out to make it! It's delicious and tastes just like I remember! I will say that I have never steamed a pudding before so I thought the directions were a little vague in that area. Thanks to You Tube I was able to brush up on steaming a pudding! There was no time listed for the steaming but 2 hours seemed to do the trick for me. I will make this again! The sauce is amazing as well!
