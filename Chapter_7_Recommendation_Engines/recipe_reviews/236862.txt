This was a great appetizer to make on the spur of the moment because I usually have all these ingredients (or most of them) on hand. It was a little heavy on the garlic so i would use less next time.  I added the juice of a whole lemon because my processor was struggling. The extra lemon did not make it too liquid. I served it with pita chips and sliced red peppers.

We really liked this - much better than the store bought stuff I usually buy.  The basil gives it a nice bit of extra flavor, and the garlic - I used five cloves, since mine were rather small, and we love garlic - that was way too much!  1/3 cup of basil ended up being about 1 oz of fresh after the stems had been trimmed.  I also added a bit more olive oil and lemon juice to make it a little less thick and for taste preference.  This was great with no-salt pita chips.

I haven't made a lot of hummus, so I don't have recipes to compare this one to.  It was a little on the thicker side, but I liked it that way.  It sure was quick and easy to make.  Raw garlic is quite pungent and I felt 4 cloves was a little too much if you're eating the hummus straight on a pita chip.  It's fine if you're using it as a sandwich spread.  If you pack the basil leaves like the recipe says, you will have plenty of basil flavor; I suspect some cooks didn't do that.  I thought it tasted better the second day.

I made this recipe last night and it came out dry and thick. I added more olive oil, lemon juice and extra seasonings. I also added one avocado to give it more taste and I drizzled about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water to thin and smooth it out in my food processor. Overall it is a good recipe with some tweaking. I would also add more basil for additional taste. We like garlic so I used 4 big cloves. I would make it again with these changes. I like Chef John's recipes they are usually very tasty.

Better as a sandwich spread than a dip.

Chef John needs a tiny bit of help with this: needs over 1/2 cup more of oil or water or a combination, and is hugely improved by an addition of sesame oil.  Take care not to under-salt, especially if using for vegetables and not crackers. It's good though!

*Note: if using home-cooked beans: the net weight listed on the can = all the solids PLUS the liquids in the can minus the packaging (can). I guessed at using 20 oz of cooked beans but it might be a little over.

The whole family loved it!  It was too thick for my blender but once I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and about 1-2 tablespoons of water it was fine.

The recipe had so little liquid as written that my blender could not process it properly. I had to use my food processor which does not puree.  Perhaps experts should try recipes using typical home kitchen equipment rather than that used in a professional kitchens.  
If you make this at home, you will want to double the lemon juice and add more olive oil.

My humus is not green... rather beige with green flecks.  I followed the directions exactly... wonder where I went wrong?  It's tasty, albeit a bit garlicky.  I am disappointed as I wanted something green for St. Pat's day.

This was pretty good.  I had a ton of fresh basil that needed to be used and   I liked the idea of 2 bean textures.   The result was more pastey than we'd like and the flavors didn't really pop.  I mixed some with yogurt and a bit of balsamic dressing and used as a salad dressing  with roasted veggies and that was really good.

Made it with dried beans. It did not get green and smooth texture. Maybe my beans were not soft enough.  Good flavor; just not the right texture.
