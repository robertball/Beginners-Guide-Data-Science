If GodivaGirl didn't suggest Almond extract, I would've kept on rollin' by this recipe.  (Never have maple flavoring, but I ALWAYS have Almond) and I also tossed in a shake of cinnamon.  Although very runny, it's good.  But, VERY VERY Sweet. Use just enough to soak into the pancake.  **UPDATE** Made it again, cutting the sugar by 1/2 cup and using the Maple flavoring.  Worth the trip to the store for the Maple Flavor!

GREAT! I cut this in half and this was enough to fill just over half of a plastic syrup bottle. Way better than the store bought by a mile and super easy. I did add 1 tsp of butter extract along with the 1 tsp. of maple extract and 1 tsp. of vanilla. Good stuff.

I cut this recipe down to 6 servings and used pure almond extract (didn't have maple).  This syrup is very sweet and more amber colored and not at all like store bought.  I used this with the Whole Wheat Pancake recipe from this site.  It did add flavor but I was thought it was too thin.  Guess I'm partial to the Absolute Best Syrup recipe from this site.

What did I do wrong? I've made this twice following the recipe and I keep making candy! When the syrup is hot and warm, no problems. But as it cools, sugar crystals form. Please help as the flavor is great but the consistency is terrible after it cools.

So easy and tasty!  I liked it better than storebought.  I was a little worried because I had no corn syrup or maple flavoring, but it worked fine without and still tasted great!  Can't wait to try it again with all of the ingredients!

This syrup turned out perfectly -- I think it is better than store bought. Made about 3 cups that I keep in a container in my fridge. Next time, I'd like to try adding another extract (maybe even some rum)! 

It's also delicious on vanilla ice cream.

This is just right! It wasn't too thinned out like other recipes. It makes enough the first time that I don't have to make it every time we need syrup!
Thanks!

Very good and not too difficult to make! It's doesn't seem too thin, but I let it cool to room temperature on the stove and then put it in the refrigerator overnight.

I have made a variation of this for several years. First, the boiling time is too long- it only needs a minute or two. That's why people are ending up with candy. Also, using all white sugar and adding a tablespoon or so of molasses is the same concept but gives a deeper flavor. I also add butter flavoring to mine sometimes. My family likes it better than any store-bought!

I used this as my base idea for my whiskey syrup. With the hooch in place of the water, then a pinch of baking soda to keep it from crystalizing.    I also used almond extract instead of maple flavor. Delicious!  Tastes great and excellent consistency.

This recipe is our FAVORITE.  Super easy to make and thickens up real nice in the fridge.  Play around with different extracts.  We have added butter extract, almond, and the maple it calls for.  I also use real vanilla.  Wish I could give it 10 stars!

I halved the white sugar,and water amount,and didn't add corn syrup[my oppinion of a nasty ingredient],I also didn't have brown sugar,so I omitted it.since I didn't have brown sugar,I "browned“ the white sugar in pan a few minutes,then added water,and at that moment,the sugar hardened and looked like rocks. But after it simmered 8 min, I took off the heat,and added flavorings. Let it cool a bit,and poured into a glass jar. Its really sweet,but yummy and natural tasting! I know my boys will love it on their pancakes!

This is the identical syrup recipe (don't remember where I found it ) I've been using for 30+ years..I like it better than any bottled ones I've used..so do my kids and friends who have tried it...I don't like to use brand names unless it makes a difference, but be sure to use Mapeline brand flavoring..tried others,that didn't taste as good.

This recipe is what I grew up with. I rarely buy syrup. My mom's recipe didn't include corn syrup.  I usually make it with maple and vanilla, however I have altered it in the past, including putting blueberries or strawberries in the the boiled mixture.

Made this for our french toast fingers this morning.  I don't usually use syrup, but this is too good not to.  I followed the recipe, but only 1/2.  Wasn't sure if everyone would like it, so I wasn't up for using 4 cups of sugar all at once.  It thickened up very nicely in the fridge, but tastes best warm.  Very, very good.

The first time I made it it crystallized. From then on, I haven't refrigerated it. Perfect! I reuse an empty plastic syrup bottle and keep it in the cupboard. Tastes even better than store bought.

I made this syrup this morning for Belgium waffles and it was ouststanding! My granddaughter insisted on her Log Cabin until she tryed it. When I was a child my mother made homemade Maple syrup but it wasn't as good as this recipe. I plan to continue make this syrup, no more store bought syrup.

This came out great for me, but I cut the sugar by about 1/2 cup. It's not too thin at all, and once it cooled off, it thickened up. The flavor is good. I read a review that added butter flavoring, and I think that would be good in this too. I've never made syrup before, and this recipe made me want to try again. :) Thanks!

5.21.16   A bit too sweet for us (personal taste preference), but it still was enjoyed as a dipping sauce for french toast sticks.  I could see substituting other extract flavors for the maple, just to provide some variety.

Really thick and sweet, but otherwise good. Maybe I need to add more water?

Love this recipe. My very picky kids loved it too. It is a good base to creat your own. Added my own spin to it by adding 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp lemon extract, and a pinch of cinnamon. Ooooommmmgggggg!!! I am never buying store bought syrup again.

Great recipe. I added a little more vanilla to the recipe than it called for.

Instead of 1/2 cup of white sugar I used 1/4 cup of raw sugar to be more natural and less grams of sugar. It's AMAZING!!!

If it is turning into candy... Your cooking it way to long... Longer and hotter you cook it the more risk of this If it boils durning 8 mins could be big reason why... Some don't know what simmer means so.. What means turn the heat down to 3 let it sit just stire ocasionly. Sujust. Let the sugar desolve complety then let it simmer.. Plus maybe cook it 6 mins verse 8.... But if your bring the heat up to high that might not help...
