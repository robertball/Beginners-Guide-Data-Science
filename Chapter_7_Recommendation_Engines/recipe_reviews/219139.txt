Easy to make and cute - would be a fun birthday party beverage.  Super sugary, but that's the point isn't it? :)  Thanks for a fun recipe!

Perfect accompaniment to our Harry Potter movie night! Kids liked it better than the last Butter Bear recipe we tried AND it was easier, too. Not a drop left!

To make this super sweet I substituted creme soda for the club soda and made my own whipping topping from heavy whipping creme. The drink was a hit and one of the adults said it was better than what they got at Hogsmeade in Universal. Definitely keeping this one for future parties.

Very easy to make but I think that you should use less soda water.

I'll make the note that as is, I would give it three stars, with adjustments, five stars, so I settled for the average. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, but it tasted a bit watered down from other Butterbeers I'd had at Harry Potter parties. I blamed the club soda. It also didn't have a very buttery flavor, and I blamed the caramel addition. So I made it again, and this time, I substituted cream soda for the club soda in addition to the cream soda it already called for, and then instead of adding caramel, I added more butterscotch to the whipped cream. Perfect.

It was very similar to a root beer float, just... butterier. :) Enjoy!

Pretty quick and easy! It was a hit with the grownups and kids, and we drank it while watching a Harry Potter movie to make it extra special. Very indulgent though!
