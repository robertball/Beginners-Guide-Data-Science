Being of chinese descent, as well as the daughter of two very well known chefs, it is hard to capture my taste buds.  but this recipe was quick and easy and all 5 of my kids (including the baby) loved this as well as my husband and parents!  I made rice and noodles to go with this along with an oriental salad as some like rice and others like noodles.  I will defintelty be putting this one in my recipe box!

I guess I have some weird dissorder because for some reason it's almost impossible for me to follow a recipe exactly as it's written. Just like the majority of recipes I try, I just have to add a little extra something.  I decreased the soy to 1/4 of a cup (some reviewers said 1/2 a cup made it too salty) and added a dash of onion powder, garlic powder and worchestershire sauce.  The chops turned out tasty and tender.  At first the sauce didn't look like it would be enough, but the pork lets out a lot of water, so no problem there.  I'm serving this with egg noodles and baked cauliflower (also found on this site).  Hubby's not home from work yet (and my 4 year old son wouldn't touch pork chops with a ten foot stick) so I'm basing this review upon my little "taste test" and I enjoyed it.  Thanks Lynda.

Tender, moist and delicious! This was super easy and had a nice Asian flair to it - definitely great for a "fix it and forget it" type of meal. I used low sodium soy sauce, added a couple splashes of rice wine vinegar and let it go. I found that this was done in 4 hours vs. 6 and there's nothing worse than the dreaded "dry pork" so watch your cooking time. I plated it and to pretty it up a bit I topped it with some chopped green onion - very good without a lot of effort.

This was really good.  All I had was really thin chops, but they still came out nice and tender.  I gave this recipe five stars because my preschooler not only ate his whole chop but had two helpings of rice with the "gravy" on it.  He hummed while he ate.  I wasn't sure what Chinese ketchup was so I used half hoisin sauce and half ketchup.  I also used about half the amount of light soy and almost doubled the sugar and it was still plenty salty enough.  During the last hour or so, I added some canned pineapple chunks along with a good shot of the juice and half a green pepper.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you.

Pretty good but as others have mentioned, the soy sauce (1/2 cup) is overwhelming.  Still, to the recipe's credit, the chops were very moist.  They fell apart as I was trying to take them out of the slow cooker to serve.

I didn't know that I was out of soy sauce, so I substituted beer and left out the ginger.  It was incredible.

Excellent!!My one and two year old's both loved this!!  I added a splash of cider vinegar and a little extra brown sugar.  Was soooo good!!  I also turned the crock pot up to high, and cracked the lid for the last hour to thicken the sauce a bit, worked great!

This made excellent pork chops, I used the thick boneless center cut ones. 5 hours on Low was the perfect cook time; Gets 5 stars for "Easy" just pour all in the crockpot and turn it on. I added an extra clove of garlic, and used low sodium soy sauce which was salty enough. Thanks for sharing, Lynda!!

This was very yummy.  My picky and non-picky sons ate it.  My oldest was disappointed when I ate the leftovers!  He wanted them!  I followed others advice and only used a 1/4 cup of soy sauce and adjusted the cooking time.  I also added more water than called for.  It was very good.  (I don't even like pork, unless it is a ham, and it was great!)A+

Did not like at all. Very dry and very salty. I even used low sodium soy sauce. Sorry, not a keeper.

This rating is for the recipe as written.  Far too little liquid for a 4 hour crock pot recipe and WAY too salty.  Liquid didn't even cover the tops of 1 inch chops.  In the end it was edible but needs lots of tweaking before I would make this again.
PS. People need to stop rating reviews based on their modifications and just rate the recipe as written.  Nearly every 5 star on here added ingredients or changed the recipe.

Lynda, I've made this recipe of yours for years (since you first posted it on a cooking board) and it is AMAZING!   Enjoyed by both adults and kiddos alike.  I usually make extra and then use the leftover pork to slice up and make pork fried rice.  A true family favorite.  Thanks, Lynda!

Amazing!  My husband loved it so much that he even suggested I make this dish when his mother comes to visit!  I used only about 1/4 cup soy sauce so it wouldn't be too salty and cooked it in the oven for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. I served the chops on a bed of brown rice with a salad.  Delicious!

I have made this recipe a few times and have always been pleased with the results.  It is so easy.  I always use low sodium soy sauce.  I've never used more that 4 pork chops so I always cut back on the cooking time.  Husband and children all like it.

This was very good. My bf and I both enjoyed this. Only thing I will change next time is use a different cut of pork. My bf and I kept finding little itty bitty bones from the chops...or maybe use boneless pork chops. Anywho, very good....i added cornstarch and 1 cup water to the sauce (after I took the meat out) and let that heat up on high heat (still in the crock pot) to get a little thicker sauce to drizzle on top. Served with steamed jasmine rice and steamed cabbage. Oh and I didnt add ANY extra salt. All that soy sauce is salty enough!

Very good.  I liked how the sauce reminded me of a stir fry so I added to the meat in the slow cooker :bell peppers, onion, snow peas, matchstick carrots and water chestnuts.  It was wonderful over rice!!!  Will be making again for sure

This was a good, solid weekday recipe.  I used boneless pork chops and they came out tender and flavorful after a full 10 hours on low.  I thought the soy sauce flavor (I always use low sodium) was overwhelming, though.  This needs more balance to the tomatoe side, next time I will decrease the soy to about 1/3 cup, and add more ketchup or even a tablespoon of tomatoe paste to balance it out.  Thanks for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers who said it was too salty.  I also decreased soy sauce and it was still too salty and I do love salt but this was too overbearing. It tasted like a typical teriyaki pork chop and was nothing special, in my opinion.  On a positive note, the chops were tender and moist. The recipe was very easy.  It is not worth tweaking the recipe to me so I will not be trying this one again.

Excellent! Keep the cooking time under five hours and you will have a great meal. The sauce is tangy and satisfying. This is a keeper.

This was so easy and absolutely wonderful! Followed the recipe except for the soy sauce - only used 1/4 cup since other reviewers were concerned about the salt.  Glad I did - there was plenty of sauce and it tasted amazing! The ground ginger really gives it that Asian flair. Had to thicken the sauce with a little flour since the pork chops released a good amount of liquid when cooking.  All 6 huge chops fit in a single layer in the bottom of my large oval crock pot and they were done after 4 hours on low. Served it with white rice and fresh green beans and everyone raved about it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper - prep was quick and easy, then you set it and forget it for a wonderful meal.

These chops had great flavor, but I think the recipe would benefit from thickening the sauce a little. Next time I make these, I will add a T of cornstarch mixed with some water to the sauce. That would help. Otherwise, I just browned them first with cooking spray because I prefer pork chops browned. They definitely have to be cooked for a minimum of 4 hours - I did 3 on low and they still weren't crock-pot tender.

I will not make this recipe, again. The sauce is runny and way, way, WAY too salty, even though I used low-sodium soy sauce. I had to shred the chops and douse the meat with BBQ sauce to make it palatable.

This recipe was great!!  The pork chops I used have been dry with every other recipe I've tried, but THIS recipe was a hit!!  I only used about 1/3C soy sauce (I ran out), and added some water and a splash of red wine vinegar (to neutralize some of the saltiness I read about).  I seasoned the pork chops with poultry seasoning, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I put some baby carrots and sweet potato chunks in with the pork chops.  I set the Crockpot on high for four hours then on low for a couple of hours after that, but I think it was all cooked and ready to go after the 4 hours on high.  By the time I served dinner the pork chops were practically falling apart.  I served it with mashed potatoes and salad.  It was a very yummy dinner!!

This was a great recipe!  We love pork and soy sauce so it was a great combination.  Also during the last hour or so of cooking I put some raw cabbage on top and then served it all over rice.  It was very good!  Thanks!

I marinated these overnight and baked them. They would have been more tender in the crock pot.

Meh. The sauce smells delicious, but the taste is under-whelming. Easy slow-cooker recipe, and the only thing I adjusted was to add a little more garlic. Great option for when you're short on time!

These pork chops were quite good.  I made them with all of the ingredients, but we got home too late to slow cook them.  So, I marinated them for an hour and we grilled them.  They were very yummy!  If I were to grill them again, I would marinate them longer and cook them on aluminum foil instead of on the grate because the brown sugar burned them pretty quickly.  We will be having these again and I will try them as a slow cooker recipe as well!

I liked that this is made out of ingredients I usually have on hand. However, it mostly tasted like ketchup and it did not have an Asian flavor like I was expecting. We both agreed to never make it again.

Our family liked it.  I think I have heard Hoison sauce called Chinese catsup.  Based on another recommendation, I used hoison sauce in place of catsup.  I used half light soy sauce.   For us, 4 1/2 hours was a bit long and the pork chops were starting to dry out.  I also added a bit of pineapple juice towards the end based on someone else writing that they had added pineapple.  Also added a little rice vinegar.   I will definately make this again because even though we changed some of it, we liked the flavor and having another slow cooker recipe.

Pretty Good.  have a recipe from a long time ago from a Phillipino friend that's very similar, it also has pineapple and onion added. Otherwise they're very similar tasting. With the recipe I have, you brown the chops, then the onion, add the garlic and some chicken stock, and simmer over a low to medium flame for about 2 hours. Crock pot's easier.

Peking Pork Chops' Haiku: "Oh wow, these were good. (I used thin chops, done quicker.) A *bit* too salty." I followed the recipe as written, using 4 thin pork chops, and they were done in the crockpot on low in about 2 hrs. They tasted great as-is, (a little on the salty side, and I even used low sodium soy sauce, thank goodness) but were even better when I took the leftovers and thinly sliced the pork for a stir-fry w/ zucchini, onions, and bell pepper.

My family loved this.  We shredded the pork and mixed it with white rice and peas.  I thought the pork was a bit tough, but I probably cooked it too long.

Just average in my opinion. My pork chops did turn out tender, but they were a little on the dry side. I followed the recipe exactly.

This is a great weeknight recipe--very quick and easy. I modified it slightly by cutting the pork chops into cubes. I also added some sliced green peppers and carrots and omitted the salt. I also found the sauce too runny so I added a tablespoon of cornstarch (mixed with a little water to make a paste) about half an hour before serving. This thickend up the sauce nicely.

While I enjoyed the flavour of the sauce, I found it a bit to salty (and I'm quite a fan of salt). Next time I'd use only half the soy sauce and would probably go for a low sodium variety.

This was pretty good.  I just wanted something quick that I could put in the crockpot, and I had everything on hand.  Like most meats cooked in a crockpot, it wasn't the most beautiful presentation, so I wouldn't serve this to guests.  It's perfect for putting on in the morning and forgetting about it until dinner time.  The flavor was great and the chop was tender.  I'll make it again.

I made this for a potluck at our church. I used a pork tenderloin that I sliced into about 1/2" chops. When done I had about 18 chops that I layered in my crockpot. I followed the recipe exactly and doubled everything. I put the chops and the sauce in separate containers in the fridge overnight and put them in the crock in the morning. I cooked them on low for about 1 hour until we needed to go to the church and then plugged them in at the church. One of the church ladies turned them up to high for about an hour and then turned them back down. They were very good according to everyone and I had none to bring home. Thanks Lynda for a great recipe.

I made this delicious slow cooked meal for the first time today. Yummy! Only thing I did differently was to brown my pork chop before putting them in the slow cooker. I'm so glad I made enough for dinner tomorrow. I can't wait to get home from work.

Pork was tender, but dry inside unless you slobbered sauce all over it. Sauce was maybe 3 star: at least it didn't have condensed soup in it. Even for a crock pot recipe, this was uninspiring. I cook several pork chop recipes (non-crockpot) that blow this away. Won't be doing this again. Live, cook and learn.

I didn't make this in a crock pot.  I made it on the stove top.  The flavor was really good,  Tasted like a teriyaki pork chop.  I used the remaining liquid from the saucepan and poured it over the top of the chops to serve.  Yummy!

Very tasty recipe when you reduce the amount of soy sauce.  I substituted lite soy and cut the amount in half (to 1/4 cup).  It was still plenty salty and had a strong soy flavor.  My husband and son loved the chops.  Can use this basic recipe and method with cheap cuts of pork and get great results.

This is now my standard crockpot recipe for any cut of pork. I've done it now with chops, loin and country style ribs and it always turns out great. The blend of flavors is mouth watering, very flavorful. Other than the cut of meat, I don't change a thing and would recommend keeping it as is.

This was easy and tasty.  The pork chops came out very tender.  I cooked 4 pork chops so I scaled the recipe back a bit.  Mine were perfect in 4 hours when cooked on LOW.  I served with Uncle Ben's 90-second jasmine rice.

Score!! We loved this taste, and the tenderness of the chops. So EASY! Hubby had made grilled pork chops a few days earlier, and I used the rest of the meat, from the SAME cut for these. His were tough, dry, bland.  These were the exact opposite, and the flavour of the sauce was wonderful. MY ALTERATIONS: used half the amount of soy sauce (from leftover take-out packets hehe) adding a bit of broth to extend it. At end, I did remove cooked meat, strained off fat, added cornstarch in cold water, boiled & stirred, to thicken sauce. Then returned chops to heat up in sauce. Am thinking this would be yummy for other meats, too.

I loved it but it only rates 4 stars because no one else really did. It was a little too salty for the kids. I'll try it again with low sodium soy.

I thought this was ok.  I think the soy sauce was a bit too overpowering... and I used low sodium too.  I served mine with Jasmine rice and stir-fry veggies.  It tasted similar to another recipe I've tried called "Juicy pork chops" from this site, excepte those chops are marinated and broiled instead of slow cooked.  I probably won't make it again, but I'm glad I tried it.

Fantastic! I used 1/4 cup tamari, 1/4 cup teriyaki as I had run out of soy, a little honey and red wine vinegar as previously suggested and it came out wonderfully.  I did add sesame seeds and used not only pork chops, but some chicken thighs that I had on hand and everyone loved it.  I started with the pork and chicken frozen and 4 hours later -- perfect! Nothing was dry and there was sufficient sauce to go around although I did thicken it up with cornstarch.  I will definitely make it again.

I love no hassle slow cooker recipes.  This was a very good new way to make pork chops.  I did make the following substitutions: 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce; added red wine vinegar; 1/4 cup chili sauce and extra brown sugar.

I followed suggestions of low salt soy sauce, added a tablespoon of cornstarch, used fresh ginger. It smelled great but my husband didn't like the sauce. I don't eat pork so... His rating is a two. I don't like to see him unsatisfied with the food I make.

I used a beef instead of pork. The dish came very tasty. However, next time I'll not add any salt, because of soy sauce, thus my dish was a bit saltier than we could enjoy. Anyway, it was an easy recipe for everyday dinner when you have a craving for Chinese. Although, for holiday dinner I would chose another recipe.

There was no pork flavour at all - the sauce overpowered the the taste of the meat.  I would recommend using a light soy sauce and fresh ginger in place of the powdered stuff.

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't think it was too salty at all - a nice blend of salt and sweet. You could toss some frozen peapods in the last hour of cooking. I served this over brown rice. Makes enough sauce to spoon over the rice.

This was great, cheers from the family!  Substituted half of the Soy sauce for teriaki sauce and the flavor was wonderful. Had to add a little water towards the end but the chops were moist and tender. A keeper for sure, Thanks.

This was super easy to make and so delicious!  Instead of noodles I made mashed potatoes.  The sauce was lovely on them.  My husband took the left overs to work and one of his co-workers playfully threatened to take his lunch!

Based on previous comments I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce.  It was still too salty so I added 1/4 cup juice and 1/4 cup water.  The result was very yummy.  Be careful not to cook too long or the pork will get tough.  With the changes I made, this recipie is a keeper.

I used a gourmet sauce in place of the soy sauce. Didn't have the ginger so left it out. My husband and three year old really loved the flavor. The pork chops were really tender. I tryed it will chicken breast and it was just as good. This is a keeper for me. I'm glad I tryed it. Thank you Lynda for sharing it with us.

Definitely easy but my family and I didn't  find the taste very pleasing.  I think the soy sauce over powers it.  If there is a next time, I'll use  low sodium soy sauce, but I don't really think I'll try it again.

Made this recipe yesterday & it came out great! They just fell apart, it was delicious. I did do a couple of things SLIGHTLY different, I left the fat on the pork chops & I made the regular amount of sauce for only 4 chops. I would actually recommend doing a double recipe for topping on the pork chops & even on the rice, if you choose to make any.

This is a great recipe! I'm not sure about the comment that it was dry. I would guess it was overcooked. I have made this with pork; however, my family prefers when I make it with beef. I buy stew meat when it's marked down and it is perfect for this recipe. It does not need the extra salt and I add a little cayenne. I use the gluten free soy sauce and a few minutes before I serve this I add a can of Chinese veggies and a can of sliced water chestnuts. Serve over rice and your family will love it!

Better than I expected. I don't usually care for pork chops made in a crockpot because they overcook too easily. These were very done but still held their shape and had some flavor to them. I used half the amount of soy sauce called for and added a splash of Worcestershire. Cooked it on low for 4 hours. Not bad.

You really need to double the sauce for this - it was pretty bland. Four hours was plenty - it was falling off the bone, however, my family got out the bbq sauce.

I had two 1.5 lb each pork steaks so I made one with soy sauce and one with teriyaki sauce.  I only use reduced sodium soy sauce because we are a little salt sensative.  Using the reduced sodium soy and not adding the additional salt that the recipe calls for the sauce is not too salty.  I cooked both pork steaks in seperate crock pots on low for about 9 hours and they were falling off the bone when we were ready for dinner.  We really liked both of the sauces equal but it was nice to have a little variety.  I served this with a side of baked carnaval squash mixed with brown sugar and butter, mixed veggies and warm dinner rolls.  This is a simple throw together meal that I think your family will enjoy.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this twice now and while I follow the ingredient list as written, I bake it in the oven, covered in foil.  It comes out tasting wonderful.  We don't find it salty (we use low-sodium soy sauce and I don't add any additional salt)-- maybe sitting and cooking in the crockpot makes it saltier?  I don't brown the chops, either.  Just put some onion slices in the bottom of the pan (ok, so I add that to the list of ingredients), throw in the chops, mix up the sauce and pour it on.  Cover with foil and bake at 350* till done.  Yum!

This was easy and delicious!  My husband and I both loved it and it took me (maybe) 10 minutes to prepare.  I did brown the pork chops before putting them in the slow cooker, but that is just my preference.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Have not tried this recipe yet but my Mom made a similar recipe when I was young.  Will add a bottom layer of tri colored peppers and onion as we like the added veggies over our rice.  Will also add a few diced green onions when I serve.  Yum

My whole family loved this. We don't even like pork chops but we liked this recipe. I added more brown sugar, less soy sauce, and 1/4 c. Chili sauce with other ingredients peer recipe.  Will definitely make again, probably next week.

There were okay.  Not sure if I'll be making them again.  They were on the salty side, and I used the low-sodium soy sauce.

Easy and very tasty.  You can use any meat.  I used pheasant cut in strips and served over rice.  I added 3 tablespoons more of brown sugar.  My hubby loved it.  Always looking for more ways to use our game meat.

I tried this with a big pork roast I had since I had all the ingrediants and it turned out great. I doubled the sauce, except scaling the soy to about 1/3 c, and I added 2 tsp sesame oil and 2 Tbsp cider vinegar. Cooked on low for 8 hours and the roast just fell apart and was tender. Shredded the meat, added back to the sauce and served it over rice. Yummy and leftovers are great!

This is so easy and yummy! We make it at least twice a month. We add red peppers.  We also suggest you add one or two bunches (yes bunches) of fresh cilantro to the pot about 10 minutes before serving.  Just break apart the cilantro a little with your hands and leave out most of the thick stalks.  It takes the dish to a whole new level.  It tastes just like the Peking Pork and Cilantro dish from the award winning Rainbow Chinese restaurant in Minneapolis.

This was definitely a good starting off point for a recipe, though I am going to tinker with it.  I'm thinking that replacing the brown sugar with honey might be nice, and I'm certainly going to do what others have done and cut the soy sauce in half.  I also thought that plum sauce might be nice in place of the ketchup, along with some chopped green onions thrown in for the last hour or so.

I'm really surprised Husband liked this as much as he did. Imo, the sauce is eye-wateringly sour and salty, and it kinda leaves a weird film on your tongue. Just as well I was making it just for him, I guess. Oh, and if you want a thicker sauce, it's common sense that you take the lid off the crock pot for a while. I would give this 2 but Husband gives it 4. Weird.

This recipe was alright. The chops were nice and tender, but very dry, and sooo salty!! The leftovers made good shredded pork sandwiches, but still, very salty. I couldn't taste much other than the soy sauce. They were better after sitting in sauce in the fridge for a day (not so dry), but I probably wont be making this again.

My chops were not thick, but they were frozen.  I loved that they didn't have to be browned and threw the frozen chops in the crockpot, poured the sauce over and after 7 hours on low and they were done.  Unfortunatley we weren't ready to eat yet and they dried out a bit while siting on keep warm, but no matter they were so good not a scrap was left over.  I thickend the sauce a bit to pour on our steamed brown rice and served with carrots and broccoli.  I'm sure this will be made again and again.

I used six thick boneless pork chops, left the fat on, and doubled the sauce. Tender, moist, and PERFECT. The extra sauce goes great over stir-fried rice'n veggies.

I used 4 boneless pork loin chops, slow-cooked it for 5 hours and they just did not come out tender. After all, isn't that why we put meat in a crockpot?  Sorry, flavor was good, but I like tender, tender, tender!

Glad I tried this one, it was very good & will definately be making it again.  I think I cooked it too long (6hrs for 4 very thick chops), so meat was a little dry, but great flavor.  Also, thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end to serve over the chops.  Yum!

I used only 1/4 c. of the soy sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce, but the chops came out really dry after cooking on low for 5 hours.  I may try baking them instead of cooking in the crock pot next time.

Good recipe.  I also thickened the sauce to go over rice.  The soy sauce is plenty salty so you don’t need the salt.

It was okay ,but way too salty. I should have read the reviews. I did not use ginger. My husband liked it but agreed it was too salty. I think I will try teriyaki sauce next time and not use soy sauce.

My husband gave this a 5 star rating.  The meat was tender and tasty.  I did add some corn starch to the broth to make a gravy.  I will definitly make again.

This was good and very easy. I only used 1/4 cup soy sauce as others had suggested, and I used a cornstarch/water mixture to thicken the sauce during the last 1/2 hr of cooking. Will definitely make this again.

Hesistated to make this because my family is very into meat and potatoes. Made it according to directions and tasted it about halfway thru. It tasted a bit salty and slightly bitter to me so I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, a tablespoon of honey and 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar. Oh my! It turned out delicious. DH loved it so much that he asked if we could have it again the next night!

I really love to stir fry and love the taste of soy sauce/authentic asian food.  So I thought this recipe would be a nice alternative to stirfry.  This didn't make the cut.  I tried it twice.  THe first time we thought, "eh." So tonight I tried making it, then moving the sauce to a pan, heating it up, adding some cornstarch to thicken it a bit and stir frying in some chinese egg noodles w/ broccoli.  It really was  not good at all.  Sorry to say.

My pork chops came out really dry and the sauce was a bit too salty for my taste.  Before I served it I added some canned pineapple chunks which seemed to help.  I wouldn't make it again though.

I did not use a slow cooker for this.  I used it as a marinade for thick cut pork chops and then broiled them.  Marinated them for about a couple of hours and then spooned some sauce over sides as I was broiling them also.  Came out very good.  Only bad thing was that I forgot to add a little water to the bottom of my broiling pan and the sauce burnt real bad and smelled really bad.  Otherwise, great taste broiled too!!!!  Served it with baked potatoes and broccoli.

this was good but I did a little change.  I used chili sauce instead of ketchup and cut my ginger to about a 1/4 tsp.  it was a tasty dish but nothing super special.

This was awful! Chops came out very tough and totally tasteless. I tried to salvage the sauce, but it was to no avail. Keep looking for something else to do with pork.

After 5 hours on low, I tested the sauce, and it was quite bitter.  I took the advice of adding pineapple chunks (with a bit of the juice) and some green pepper.  It helped salvage the meal, but the pork chops were dry and tasteless, and the sauce itself was still not that enjoyable.

Took the advice of other reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce.  The flavor was OK and the chops were moist, but something was missing.  I will keep it in mind for a way to do chops when I have frozen meat that I want to throw in the slow cooker before I leave for work, but it's not going on my "favorite recipes" list.

My husband loved this, he had 3 pork chops. I used the thin cut boneless pork chops.
Very Tender. My daughter didn't like the taste, she said it was too salty, but she's a VERY picky eater.

This was the most tender pork I've had in awhile.  I read the comments about the salty soy sauce and substituted it for honey smoke BBQ sauce. I also used garlic salt instead of real garlic. It seemed to add more flavour.   Hubby raved about it.   This is definetely a keeper.

This was a very easy recipe. I didn't use a crockpot though, I marinaded the pork in the sauce and then baked it at 375. I also added some crushed red pepper to the mix. I thought it was great. The sauce tastes so good you will want to baste them will they are cooking.

This is a keeper!  At first I thought it was a little too salty, by itself, but when combined with saffron rice and a bite of meat....OMG.  I heard my husband yum-yumming from another room knew it was a keeper!  I didn't have ground ginger, so I shredded....a lot!  (Probably why I thought it was too salty, but don't skimp on the ginger!)

I did everything exactly as directed but found, when I went to check on the pork chops at the 4 hour mark, that they were getting dry around the edges. Had the slow cooker on low and the recipe said to allow cooking between 4-6 hours. At this point they were already over cooked and dried out. Used some sauce but I was a little disappointed.

My family loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to put a little spicy rub on the chops.  the little bit of heat went well with the salt and the sweet. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Far too salty and dry.  If i make it again I will use half the soy sauce and increase the ginger--probably use fresh instead of powder.

Love this recipe!  When the pork is almost ready, I fry up some sliced red and green bell pepper and a sliced onion until they're cooked through and the onion is translucent. I pull the pork chops out and cut them into bite sized pieces, toss them in the skillet with the peppers and onions, and then pour the sauce over top. After it's all combined and heated through, I serve it over some cooked noodles or rice. (Also: I add 1/2 tsp of MSG about 1/2 hour before the pork is done. Don't fall for the anti-MSG hysteria, it's actually delicious!)

It was just OK for us. Flavor was average and pork wasn't that tender. I usually have very moist, tender and juicy meat with my own recipe for Asian pork in the slow cooker. I think it needs more time...8 hrs on low vs 4 to 6...more spices and less soy sauce. Too much sodium dries out meat and the recipe calls for salt ...twice ...as well. Maybe even add some honey. Will not make again, sorry.

Followed the directions and came out great. The loin chops were about 1 1/2 thick. I used a 6 hrs slow cooker. And used temp probe for proper temp. Kids went for seconds. It's a keeper. Thanks.

I overcooked it. I used the slow cooker for 6 hours. it only needed 4 hours max. also a little too salty for my taste.


I would try it again with less time and less salt.

We were not fans of this one.  It was easy to throw together but the flavor was a bit bland, the sauce/marinade stayed too runny, and the pork chops were a dry.  Won't make this one again.

This was quick, easy and delicious! Great combination of flavors. Served with jasmine rice and it was a hit. Didn't change a thing, stuck to the original recipe. I did coat my crockpot with olive oil so nothing would stick and it worked great!

While a quick and easy recipe, it is WAY too salty.  Cut the soya sauce in half, add more liquid and perhaps some other vegetables like peppers, onions, celery, etc. to add flavour.  You can also brown the chops in a large skillet, then simmer for about an hour on med/low.

Made this with some very thick chops .  Altered the recipe a  by using less soy sauce  (and sodium reduced) and using sliced ginger instead of ground (sliced is so much better).  Also added some sliced apples which added another fruity texture to the recipe.

Came out very well and cooked on slow for about 3.5 to 4 hours.  Nice and tender

This is definitely a do over. We loved it. The pork chop was a bit dry BC I cooked it for 4.5 hours so it sat warming the rest of the day, but the meat just fell apart no knive was needed.

I really really wanted to like it but my pork chops were super dry.  I cooked them for 5 hours.  But overall the flavor was only so-so (like a teriyaki) and not like what I'm use to Peking Pork Chops to taste like.

This recipe DID make the pork very tender, but lacked taste. I did follow the suggestion of not using as much soy, which may account for the blandness of the meat... It was just okay for me.

I doubled the sauce recipie with a few slight changes. I used 1/2 C br. sugar, 2tsp. ginger,1/2 C soy sauce,1/2 Cketchup, 2tsp. minced garlic. I also added 1 can chunk pineapple (juice and all), chopped celery,onions, and sliced carrots. If I had green pepper, pea pods, and water chestnuts, I would have added those too.

I was excited to try this and made it exactly as written, but was disappointed. I haven't made it again. The meat was slightly dry and it didn't make enough sauce. Also, something was off in the taste. I might read all the reviews and make some changes to it.

even with low sodium soy sauce it was too salty for my tastes.  Next time I'd use half soy sauce and half teriyaki sauce.

Quick and easy to prepare and lovely flavor.   I did it with bonelss pork stakes and found the meat a bit dry so will reduce the cooking time when I do it again but, other than that, a nice dish.

I followed the directions to a T. For some reason I did not get results others had. The sauce was watery and the chops didn't get very tender. All in all it did not look appetizing. I won't make this again.

Enjoyed this very much, although a bit too salty, which is keeping it from 5 stars.  Will switch to low-sodium soy and use a less next time.  This is a keeper and will definitely try it again.  Great flavor and very tender pork chops.  Made the house smell great.  Thanks!

I'll give this a weak four stars. I just didn't find it that appealing although my husband liked it more. I did use low sodium soy sauce. I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and worcester sauce.  It was ok. But it is exactly the same as Pork Chops for the Slow Cooker recipe other than the amount of garlic.

Wow! I was really impressed. The flavor is very complex and tasty. Picky Boyfriend went back for seconds--that alone makes it a keeper! I used fresh garlic and ginger, and I added a splash of chili oil to give it some heat. After cooking, I added some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up and served the whole thing over rice. Perfect!

I really liked this, and I am not a fan of pork chops.  I reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1/8 of a cup, so it wouldn't be too salty and it was perfect for us.  Thanks!

I have a recipe that calls for a lot of the same ingredients that my fiancee loves, yet I couldn't find it at the time. So I tried this one. I thought that being in the crockpot it would make the chops so tender that everyone would just love them. Surprisingly, they didn't like that. I didn't have a problem with them being dry like some others had, but my family was a little odd in not liking their pork chops so tender!! Go Figure. I will try this same recipe in the oven to toughen them up and see...But the taste was great (and I liked them being tender!!) Thanks...

I gave this 2 stars because the chops came out tender, but the sauce was not very good in my opinion.  I even tryed it with the soy sauce decreased and not good, I won't be making this again.  Too bad because it sounded so good in the description.

Really good I used fresh ginger and added some spring onions,and a dash of sesame oil. This absolutely must be made with asian ketchup, I used Indonesian and it was so good we had seconds, and even considered getting back out of bed for more. The meat was very soft and fell apart.

I used 8 small skinless chicken thighs, left out the salt and pepper, and did it on the stovetop! Just left it on the lowest heat and let it simmer for an hour or so. Both my 7 and 3 yr olds enjoyed this with jasmine rice. Tastes a lot like TERIYAKI CHICKEN! Had a lot of sauce left in the pot and didn´t want to waste it; so I put four large frozen drumsticks in and turned the heat back on and let them simmer in the sauce for an hour or so. Really great flavor, even the second time around. I used Kikkoman brand soy sauce and the ketchup packets saved from various trips to McD. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle....from Curious George Soundtrack.

I doubled the sauce and used 1/2 lite soy, 1/2 lite teriyaki.  After cooking, the chops were dry.  I shredded and let marinate in the sauce a little longer.  This turned out really good after shredding.

Excellent flavor, but my chops turned out dry.  Will have to experiment.  I made stir fyr veggies, thickened up the sauce (which I doubled) with cornstarch, and served with brown rice.  Again, great flavor but chops were dry.

My pork turned out a little dry for whatever reason, and I would definitely use less soy sauce next time, but otherwise the flavor was good, especially considering how super easy these are to make.

I just got done making these and I have to say that this was super easy and oh so yummy! I did add a splash of teriyaki sauce and turn them in the middle of cooking. I also cooked them for about 7 hours and next time I will knock it down to six! They are so tender that they just fell apart! Thanks for Sharing!!!

Fantastic! I made this yesterday, and my rather fussy husband scraped the slow cooker clean, pronouncing it delicious. I made this with diced pork and used a sweet soy sauce, omitted the salt, and used a little more garlic. It was on low for about 8 hours till I got home from work, and was fine.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this a few times and love it! My husband doesnt really like pork chops, but likes things really flavorful, he said these were the best pork chops he has ever had. They are moist and delicious. I usually serve with red skinned mashed potatos.

It had a lot of flavor but the meat was a little dry. I took some of the sauce and stir-fried it with cabbage and carrots and then topped it with cilantro and chopped peanuts. I also added some Thai chili paste to the stir-fry for some added spice.

My boyfriend loves this. Have made twice in 2 weeks. Used a thick dark soy sauce (fm Asian store) instead of the regular kind. Also added 2 tbsp of worchesteshire sauce (1st time) and steak sauce (2nd time). Good both ways. Keeping this one.

I used slices of pork tenderloin instead of pork chops.  On the plus side, the meat was very tender--it was in the slow cooker all day while I was at work.  On the minus side, the dish is extremely salty and would probably be better with low sodium soy sauce.  I thought the flavor was okay, but not good enough that I would make it again.

We've had this a couple of times now and it's really good.  I used pickled ginger the 1st time and it came out much tastier than when I used the ginger powder.  Also, I would make sure to use the low setting on the crock otherwise the meat doesn't some out as tender.

I used very thick hotel cut chops.  I think I over cooked them slightly (5 hours) but the flavour was wonderful.  It almost reminded me of what good ribs would taste like.  My husband and kids loved them which means I will definitely make this easy recipe again.

Excellent flavor and very tender.  Used 1/4 teriyaki and 1/4 soy instead of 1/2 soy.  Cooked 4.5 hours on low.  Next time I would use some of the sauce for the crock pot to stir fry some veggies.  Also we only made 3 chops, but used full sauce.  And regular ketchup was just fine.

My husband gives this a 5, I give it a 3 - so we average it for a 4 star rating.  I followed the recipe amounts exactly and used the low sodium soy sauce, but the dish tasted to me like something was missing.  It was salty, but I don't think that was the problem.  Next time, maybe I'll add more ketchup and brown sugar.

These are good. We made brown rice with chicken broth in place of the water, and sauteed pineapple chunks, chopped green pepper, and minced red onion and then mixed that in with the rice. Sounds weird but the chops on top of it were "restaurant quality" according to my husband!

It may be my crock pot, but I tried this recipe once with pork chops and once with chicken thighs, and both turned out rather dry.  The flavor of the sauce was pretty good, but I've tried others that I like better.

I gave this recipe 2-3 stars, but my husband gave it 5.  Thus, I averaged the two scores and got 4 stars!  First, let me say that I am not a big fan of pork chops, however, the pork chops themselves were VERY tender and good (this is my first time preparing chops in the slow cooker).  So, the chops weren't the problem.  I just thought the sauce wasn't all that good.  The only changes I made to the recipe were a couple of suggestions from other reviewers -- I added 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (I absolutely LOVE that BBQ sauce).  I also added about 1/4 cup of cider vinegar.  It's hard for me to put my finger on exactly what I disliked about the sauce.  It just seemed to be "almost there"... as if it was missing something... or as if I added something that I shouldn't have.  Maybe it's my fault for making the few changes I made.  I will definitely make this again for my husband, but I will try the recipe exactly as written and see I like it any better.  In any event, I am EXTREMELY happy to have this recipe because my husband likes it and it was SOOO easy to make.

Instead of cooking this in a crock pot, I put it in a casserole dish and cooked for about 40 minutes in oven.  The sauce gave good flavor without saturating the chops like it would in the crock pot.

I loved this recipe. I sauteed the chops first then added a mixture of a can of pinapple slices and apple cider blended together. My chops were marinating in teryaki for half an hour and I used low sodium soy which was great! I added half of the pineapple mix to the soy to thicken a little and sweeten the sauce. Everyone at dinner raved about it!! I also used fresh ginger which was my first time cooking with ginger and I loved it!

This dish tasted good, but the consistency of the sauce wasn't what I expected at all, it was very runny and not (in my admittedly limited experience) Peking-style at all.

I made this for my family and they liked it, although I didn't have a chance to try it.  Next time I'll use it as a marinade and grill the pork chops - that sounds delicious already! Oh, and I'll use the low sodium soy sauce, too.

My family & I enjoyed this recipe & it was quick, easy and tasty.  Like another post, we also marinated the chops and then baked them in the oven & served them with pineapple bits.  I would suggest using low salt soy sauce though.

Thought these pork chops came out very tender and they were so simple to make.  I did add a splash of worsh. sauce and substituted chili sauce for the ketchup as I didn't have any.  Leftover pork chops made excellent sandwiches the next day.  Will make again - thanks for the recipe!

This is a nice "Tuesday night Supper" recipe.  I didn't quite use 1/2 cup of soy sauce because so many posts said it was a bit salty.  The flavor of the sauce was great, but my porkchops weren't as tender as I was hoping.  Maybe it is my crockpot and not the recipe though.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great pork rcipe. I didn't have pork chops so I used two small pork tenderloins that I had frozen. My daughter, who hates everything before she even tries it, said it was "pretty good" which is 5 stars for her. My husband and son loved it--I'll make this again for sure!

I had a problem with the sauce burning in the crock pot.  Tasted fine, but don't overcook it!

Excellent and delicious!  The amount of ginger is just right.  One could substitute stir fry or teryaki sauce for the soy sauce too.
