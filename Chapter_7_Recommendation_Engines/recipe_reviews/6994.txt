Don't let this bread fool you--it's not too hard to do, and it is delicious. It's definitely not for those who are watching their carbs, but it's good for a treat.

This is very interesting; I'm glad I tried it.  Next time, I will probably split the dough between two loaves and spread each thinner; as one loaf, it was a bit thick for the rice center.  Take note that if you intend to change the number of servings, the *original* measures are in the body of the recipe.  I cut the recipe in half but then started following the measures within the directions of the recipe.  I realized pretty early on and and was able to recover.    Thanks for a new and yummy treat!

I really really love this bread. It takes a bit to make, but it's so all worth it in the end. Love you rice bread.
