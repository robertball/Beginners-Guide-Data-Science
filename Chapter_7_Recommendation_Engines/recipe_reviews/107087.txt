I made this recipe for guests last night and it turned out great.  I am not even a seafood lover, and I liked it.  The lemon, garlic, and dill was the perfect flavoring for the salmon.  I had never heard of using a cedar plank to grill meat, but I absolutely recommend it especially if you have a gas grill (which does not give the meat as much flavor as a charcoal grill. The cedar plank gave it a slightly smoky flavor.  The salmon was wonderful and I will definitely make it again.

Just a few things I learned--I would recommend getting the "wild" salmon from Whole Foods--especially for people that typically do not like seafood.  It is a little more expensive, but it is worth it.  The salmon was very fresh and not "fishy" smelling, and in addition Whole Foods have quality meat there without additives or growth hormone.  The plank was very easy to work with(thanks to the reviewer who said they got an untreated cedar plank at Home Depot). I soaked it in water for about 4 hours (make sure to get a brick to hold the plank down--I used a pot and the plank kept going up to the surface.)  It took a little bit longer to cook than the recipe said--about 35 minutes. It is hard to tell by the color that the salmon is done, so the meat thermometer is essential.  When the salmon got to 130 F it was perfect (medium).  Hope this helps, you won't be disappointed with the results!

Absolutely, no doubt-about-it, 5-star recipe all the way!  Finally found my untreated cedar plank at Home Depot.  Soaked it in water for about 4 hours, laid it on the gas grill for 10 minutes at high heat, placed a beautiful Alaskan Copper River sockeye salmon filet on the plank, with the sauce, on the grill at low heat for 25-30 minutes, and it came out utterly moist and SO tender and delicious!  Definitely company-worthy. (I would reduce the salt just EVER so slightly, in the future.)  Thanks for the great recipe & clear, simple instructions, Pam!

This recipe is the best salmon I've ever had or made.  So easy too!  We thought it was too saltly so the next time I used about half of what was called for. I purchased my planks and salmon at Costco.  Their frozen skinless fillets were great.  I would use 6 fillets for this recipe.  My husband loved this!

This can only be described as excellent.  My husband, who is not the biggest fan of salmon, said that it was the best he'd ever had.  I love salmon and thought the same thing.  I am so happy to have found a recipe that we both love...now we can have salmon more often!  THANKS!!

This was my first time planking but did we love it.
Soaked the plank fro about 6 hours.
Substituted the dill for rosemary (chopped up).
Cooking time was 18 minutes. (I only peeked once and had to spray a bit of water on the plank to make sure it wouldn't flare up)
As I needed to serve 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) I only had 1.5Lbs of salmon but I could just as well bought 3lbs.
When I brought the fish in the house my wife said it smelled like a real restaurant. The kids asked if I could make it again tomorrow and the day after and the day after.

This was fantastic!  The topping was delicious along with the smoke from the cedar plank.  I soaked mine for 2 hours and didn't have any problems with it catching fire.  It did buckle a little and the bottom got charred but the salmon cooked beautifully.  The lemon zest is much more flavorful than simply using lemon juice.  Delicious!

The whole family loved it. I don't like salmon that much, I usually have to fight to eat my whole portion. This was easy. My 4 year old said it rocks.

Wow!  Awesome recipe, easy-to-follow instructions.  I'd have to say this was the best salmon I've ever had, let alone made.

Do not do this if you have a stainless steel grill. I will turn it black.    Layers of tar will build up in the lid of your grill if you smoke food in it often, a fire hazard.

We loved this!  So tasty!  Bought planks at Home Depot and DH cut them to fit our grill.  Even though they soaked for almost 2 days they still smoked and popped.  It was FUN - kids loved it - they ate every bit of it and asked we make it this way again!

I've only made salmon a couple of times before, but this time was by far, the best.  Using the cedar plank makes the fish so moist, it makes anyone a culinary expert.  I can't wait to try other plank recipes, and try cooking my favorite salmon recipe on the cedar plank.  I did cut the salt in half based on other reviews, and thought it was the perfect amount.  Also, I used the "fresh" dill in the tube, which tasted great, but because it is packed in oil, I will cut down on the olive oil a tad in the future.

Excellent recipe - Restaurant quality, great presentation.  Soaked the plank all day, used the ingredients listed to top the salmon (plus extra garlic, and minus the salt and pepper) as well as a thinly sliced lemon across the top (like the picture).  I grinded sea salt and fresh pepper on top.  Then put the salmon on the plank and placed the plank on the grill.  This worked just fine.  Cooked for about 25 minutes.  Squeezed fresh lemon juice on top before eating.  PS - Bought the fresh salmon and planks from Costco.  Thanks!

We made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it and wanted to know how we did it.  My husband actually did the grilling.  The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the salt.
For a smokier taste, put the wood plank on the grill about 5 minutes before you add the fish to give the plank a chance to start smoking.

Easy to make, and got rave reviews!  I didn't use a cedar plank but put it right on the grill - it turned out just fine.

Absolutely fabulous.  This is one of the best salmon recipes out there. I added some lemon and white wine to the water used to soak the cedar plank. I also had to use dill from a jar.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was ok, would give it 3.5  stars if I could.   It took about 33 minutes to reach 130F then another 8 or so to reach the temperature we wanted (we like our salmon more done).  I marinated for about an hour and it definitely needed mroe time.  If I try this one again, will marinate at least 4 hours.  Definitely not one of our favorite salmon recipes, however the leftovers will become salmon cakes tomorrow.

This deserves more than 5 stars. It is the best fish I have ever had. I will be making this all the time & turning my friends & family on to it. I noticed several reviewers thought it was too salty. I never use salt & it was excellent. Thanks!

This was my first attempt at plank grilling but it was a great starter recipe.  My only complaint is it is way too salty with 2 teaspoons.  Next time I'm cutting that in half but otherwise it was excellent.

Our salmon turned out fabulous. I agree with everyone else to cut back on the salt. Others at the table said it was just right. We used a meat thermometer and cooked to 140 degrees and it came out perfect.

We basically used this for the sauce, not the fish.  We used tilapia instead of salmon and cooked it in a pan with olive oil.  Very tasty, but way too much salt.  Recommend half of what is called for.

It's ridiculous how good this is.  We made it exactly as listed here.  My aunt won't touch seafood of any kind.  She tried this, raved, and then actually took seconds.  It's THAT good.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The only difference was that I added about a 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the marinade.

I followed the recipe as written except for the cedar plank, but grilled it until the fish was just done. We all thought it was absolutely delisious! And once I find where my cedar plank is hiding, I'll try it on that!

Great flavor. Definitely will repeat. Nice to throw together quick since no marinating is required.

this was out of this world.  My 11yr. old son caught a 15lb. spring salmon and made this with part of it.  the whole family thought this was one of the best recipes I've made to date with salmon and I've made A LOT!!  actually made this about 3 weeks ago and am just now reviewing it because i needed to look it up because i'm making it again tonight with the rest of the fish!  I almost never have fresh dill on hand and did then, but not tonight so will try with dried and i'm sure it won't be the same so if it's really a big taste difference i will update this and let you all know!

AMAZING! So tender, moist and flavorful. While I seasoned slightly different I followed the cooking method exactly. I used a large boneless, skinless fresh salmon filet from costco for $15 and marinated it overnight. I soaked my plank for 24 hours in the sink with a pot of water on top of it and it worked perfectly. To make it a meal I sliced a potato and onion and threw it in a foil packet and I washed some asparagus and threw that in a foil packet (both with drizzeled olive oil and coarse salt) and put those on the grill with the fish. Everything was done at the same time. It was a super easy, healthy and absolutely tasty meal that even my kids loved. THANKS! I will use this alot!

My salmon turned out great with this recipe. The garlic, lemon and dill was delicious paired with fresh Alaskan King Salmon. The only thing I would change next time would be to reduce the amount of dill. It became a bit overpowering.

This recipe reminded me why I dont like dill -- the flavor is too overpowering.We would have liked this recipe with out it (and yes I know that would change the whole recipe.)  We didnt care for the flavor of the fish BUT loved using the cedar plank. This was my first time and it will definitely be a staple this summer.

Well, this did not work out like I thought it would.Soaked the Plank for 6hours and fired up the grill.Told my husband to put it on the grill for 10 Minutes like the recipe called for.Meanwhile I am prepping the salmon.After not even 5Minutes I checked the Plank and found a burned up piece of wood in my grill.That sucker was done!We got a good laugh out of it.Just grilled the Salmon straight on the grill and it turned out awesome.I have another Plank so I will try again soon.My advise is to watch it closely.

I cut the salt in half.  I didn't have access to fresh dill, so I just used a bunch of dried dill (probably about 2 tablespoons....I like dill)....and I used twice the lemon zest it calls for.

I've made this twice now and I don't preheat the plank...I soak it for a long time, but just put the fish right on it and get to grilling

Delicious recipe!  The cedar plank  gives the fish  just a touch of a smoke flavor and the fish was nice and moist. I used about 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and thought it was plenty. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to guests!

Did not use the garlic - I never use garlic on fish, especially something so awesome as salmon. No salt either. The rest I followed and was thankful for the instructions. It was AWESOME! Thanks again for posting. I'll be preparing salmon and perhaps other fish, using this method going forward. Yum!

This was fantastic! I didn't add any salt but that was the only change I made. Everyone loved it. We had Orzo with Basil and Parmesan from this site as well as grilled asparagus with the salmon. I used a bit of the marinade on the asparagus and that was wonderful too! Will definitely make this again and again

I made this recipe as written and it was fantastic. Now making it again, I have a few changes.  I use 5 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, 6 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup chopped dill, and instead of using lemon zest- 2 lemons sliced thin to put over the top of the fish during baking. For those of you who said that it was to salty, you do not add the salt and pepper directly to the fix. You mix it in with the olive oil and it is perfect.

I liked this easy recipe- This was the first time I've cooked on a cedar plank. Found this online and used it for our family get-together bbq dinner. My dad used his creamy italian recipe- and we had them side by side. Actually--family ate more of this than my dad's recipe! Yummy!  The only variation I used instead was 3 garlic cloves, and lemon juice. Turned out GREAT!! :))

The recipe turned out great even though we used frozen salmon fillets.  We thought the amount of dill for the recipe was a little much, so we used less--it was our first time cooking with it.  Turns out the amount we used didn't put out enough flavor and we actually needed all of it!  We'll definitely be trying this again!

My first attempt to plank grill, and trying to get the family to eat more salmon. HUGE success! My hubby has asked for it 2 times since I first made it. Usually can't get him to have more than 5 bites when I make salmon. The second time I made it, I coated chicken breasts w/ the same 'marinade' and grilled them next to the fish.  Yummy too.  It made the best chicken salad the next day.

Its a very tasty recipe, but i would recommend using less garlic,  4 large cloves over powers the fish just a bit too much, i would use maybe 2 cloves but it is still very tasty and ill make it again for sure (a little more dill wouldnt hurt either)

As other reviewers recommended, used half of the salt that was called for. Absolutely delicious and so simple. Tasted even better cold the next day.

I made this for a family reunion of 30+ people - I can't believe how awesome this recipe is!!!  Everyone RAVED - my husband, who is mainly a beef man, said this was his new favorite dish.  You have got to try this - you will WOW your dinner guests.    The planks are a big touchy - we didn't pay too much attention when we basted the fish & the olive oil got down in the grill, so we had to wipe them off & try again because they kept catching on fire :-)  But, it didn't make any difference in the taste of the fish...SOOOO delicious & even good cold the next day!!

My whole family LOVED this receipe. I did change just a touch - Salmon is already an oily fish so I used just enough olive oil to lightly coat it to hold the herbs in place. I used 1/2 the salt but a lot more fresh garlic slices. I used fresh sockeye salmon. The cedar plank disinigrated some during grilling but it was "worth it" for the flavor. I buy the planks 2 to a pack. I figure I'll get 2 more meals out of the first plank. This is a permanent recipe now.

Great taste and simple marinate. We don't have a cedar plank, but my husband grilled with mesquite chips and it came up really good.

My husband and I caught a "pink" salmon while on an Alaskan cruise and because we spent extra money having the fish shipped home to us, we wanted to do something special with it. Plus, on a whim we had purchased cedar planks which had gone un-used for at least a year. So...ta-da....I found a perfect recipe combining flavors to complement our special fish AND the cedar planks! Everything turned out deliciously and we really enjoyed our catch. Thanks so much!

This is fantastic!  It was the first time I used planks and I was glad for the instructions on how to set it up.  The salmon I used was a large piece without skin, and it came out fabulous.

I had the pleasure of eating this, prepared by a master chef (LadyJayPee).  It is sooo good!!  I love salmon already, but now I love it even more.  ;)  The cedar-grilling adds a level of smokiness to the salmon, and that, along with the fresh garlic and dill, make it so delicious and mouth-watering that I could hardly stand it!  I had some cold the next day, and that was really good, too.  Delicious recipe!

Maybe I shouldn't rate this because I change it totally, but I didn't feel like chopping or preparing much. So I didn't use any oil at all. Used Lemon-
dill seasoning and garlic powder some lemon pepper and salt. That's it. It was kind of the same thing just a faster and lower fat version. And it was yummmyyyy. The smell of the Cedar Plank was amazing. Ohhh I also used Sockeye Salmon.

What an amazing recipe.  I have not tried this before but I was amazed by the results.  I used  less salt (1/4 teaspoon) but opted to add the juice from 1/2 lemon to make up for it.  I had a lot of sceptics at the dinner table but they all loved it.  I was hoping for left-overs but nothing remained.  I guess I will have to  make it again...soon.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I used a little less salt like others had suggested and I am glad I did.  I used about a 1/3 of the amount on every ingredient since I had only 1 lb of salmon to cook. But will definitely make this recipe again.  It turned out very moist and not super fishy tasting.

This was delicious.  I added a little fresh lemon juice and reduced the salt to about 1/2 teaspoon.  This is a keeper and will become one of my preferred ways to prepare salmon.

Delicious. Added some fresh lemon juice (about a tablespoon) Made a little extra marinade and used it on asparagus (without the lemon zest) before grilling.

I've made this recipe twice already.  It is a very good option for Salmon when you don't feel like having a soy ginger glaze.  I do put more lemon zest (entire lemon) and squeeze the lemon juice into the mix.

Very good - too much salt though.  Reduce to 1 tbs, and then season to taste at the table.

Way too salty.  

I will definitely redo with less salt next time.

This was a favorite of many salmon recipes I have made.  All of my guests loved it and it was easy to make.  I served it with the "Dill Sauce" recipe from this site using plain yogurt rather than sour cream as the recipe called for.

Best salmon I've ever had. The dill and lemon are refreshing in comparison to the smokey cedar. Definitely a keeper!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was too salty for our taste (we don't overly salt our food, so it may be fine for people who do.). We grow dill in our herb garden and loved it with garlic and lemon on salmon.  Next time, I will try cutting the salt in half.

I used salmon steak, added some lemon juice, used half the salt, more garlic, and cooked it on the stove.  It came out amazing.  Although it worked with the salmon steak, i think a fillet is the way to go.  But overall, great great recipe.

Whoever said the best recipes are the simplest, must have had this recipe in mind! This is by far the best way to prepare  delicious wild caught salmon that I have seen. This is my go to recipe when I have guests or for a special date night with my husband with a great bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir. I swear it has aphrodisiac qualities! ?? The only change I made was to reduce the salt to one teaspoon - it's perfect for me as is otherwise. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This was definitely delicious! First time with the cedar plank and it was 100% worth. However, 2 tsp of salt turned out to be too much. Had to scrape the dill/garlic mix off the top to cut down on the salt flavor (and I love salt). I also used lemon infused olive oil for extra lemon flavor, and glad I did. I don't think I would've had any citrus flavor without it (although I didn't have the lemon wedges, since I used it for my side dish). Overall, great salmon recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe and I've prepared it often. The only thing that I changed is the internal temperature. Everything I've read says that salmon should be heated to 145 degrees. I say, 'Better safe than sorry'.

We made this recipe exactly as stated. I found it called for too much oil. Salmon is an oily fish by nature. We used the Salmon we caught in Alaska this year (filets not bellies). Next time we will just use 1 tbsp.

I would have rated this 5 stars, but it was extremely salty.  Everything else was perfect.  We will definitely make this again, but I'll reduce the salt by half.  We cooked it on cedar planks I found at Home Depot and used "fresh troll caught wild king salmon" from Costco.  It was expensive, but worth it.

This was super good! Salmon is my least favorite fish but I love anything grilled so being a recent northwest transplant i figured we'd give it a try with all the fresh-local salmon around. In the past I've tried to like salmon but it was always -blah-  and usually super dry, this was fantastic. I also let it marinate in some white wine and and garlic all day then followed the recipe. We made it two weeks in a row! LOVE IT!

This was my first time using the cedar plank. The recipe calls for salt but I did not add salt since fish is already salty enough. I added the ingredients to a Ziploc bag with the salmon and marinated it for about an hour and at the same time I had the plank soaking in the sink for about an hour. The plank needs to be held down with something heavy since it wants to float up. I had 1.5 lb salmon and cooked it for about 25 minutes. I peaked a few times since I read other reviews that their plank caught on fire. Mine did not! I also have a stainless steel gas BBQ and it didn't turn black at all as one reviewer stated. The salmon was so moist and it just melted in your mouth!  I can't wait to try it with ribs! FYI...I found my planks at Fry's grocery store. I'm so happy to hear that Costco has them!

If I could give this 6 stars I would! We regularly make this for guests - it's simple, elegant and delicious. It's also great year-round.  I serve it with a kale salad and roasted potatoes and its a wonderful meal. I get salmon at Costco and there's no skin on it but it doesn't have any negative impact. Also, if you google cedar planks there are great websites where you can buy "seconds" for very little money. A win win!

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I reduced cooking time to 18 minutes due to the thickness of the salmon.  It was DELICIOUS!  My entire family loved it and all want to have it on a regular basis.  BTW, it was my first time cooking on a cedar plank and I can't wait to do it again!  A really good recipe!!

Wonderful recipe. I will make again. I cut the salt in half as other reviewers advised and thought it could use a tad more after tasting. I served it with garlic and herb wild rice and steamed zucchini and squash and it was excellent. Will definitely be making again.

I cut the salmon into individual portions and because I didn't have a cedar plank, I put the salmon in a foil packets and then on the BBQ.   I cooked at 400 degrees for 5 minutes.  It was really good, but next time, I would add more dill.

Made this a few months back. Am making it again tonight! Followed the recipe to the letter but for 4 portions. It was perfect. I served it on top of roasted garlic mashed potatoes w/ carmelized onion and a strawberry-fetta cheese salad on baby spinach on the side.

Superb!!! Husband and I LOVED this. Children (4, 7 and 9yrs) also wanted seconds! We live in Alaska - eat A LOT of seafood - haven't tasted a better recipe even in fine restaurants here. Only addition was 1/4 cup of white zinfandel.

I don't eat salmon but my family does... and they LOVED this!  Said I could make it again anytime... I didn't have fresh dill so I used dry and halved the recipes since I didn't have 3 pounds of fish.  Also, buying a cedar picket from Home Depot and making your own plank is MUCH cheaper than buying them premade for 3x as much... delish!! =)

Delicious and easy. I made this for my dad and family on Father's day. Everyone loved it! The slightly smoky flavor of the cedar plank really adds to the salmon. My mom never thought she liked salmon until she had it like this.

Delicious! The trick is to allows the cedar plank to smoke before placing the salmon on it.  A wonderful smoked flavor.  I didn't change a thing.

This recipe was easy and great.  I used lemon juice and dried dill and it still turned out well.  Next time, I'll actually remember to buy the lemon when I buy the salmon.  :)

Way too salty. Next time I will use half the salt but good recipe overall. This was my first attempt at plank grilling and was more than happy with the results.

This is incredibly good.    The aroma from the cedar permeates the salmon and really enhances the flavor.   This is absolutely my favorite way to cook salmon.     However, I have to find a way to keep the cedar from catching on fire.   I had soaked it for 6 hours and I had my gas grill as low as it would go and the wood still caught on fire after about 15 minutes.     I'm going to experiment with raising the wood up higher in the grill next time.

This was super good! My husband has been burnt out on salmon and I was looking for a different preparation. I didn't have any lemons so I left that out, but we are looking forward to trying it with the lemon. Awesome recipe :)

This is a fantastic recipe.  The marinate is so light that it doesn't overwhelm the salmon, and allows the cedar flavour to really come out.  I've made it twice with rave reviews.

This is a super good recipe!!  I am not a huge fan of salmon but my hubby LOVES it.  This recipe makes it enjoyable for both of us!!  I did leave out the olive oil completely to make it more Weight Watchers friendly.  Otherwise I followed exactly.  Thanks - I will use this recipe a lot!!!!!

This recipe was just ok.  For the work involved, I would rather just bar b q the salmon.  It was a little too smokey, but I'll admit it was moist. The sauce was hard to taste with the smoke.  Sorry.  Suzanne

I think it may have just been my fault, but this was not as good as I had hoped. I've never cooked anything on a cedar plank before, so it may have just been me, but it was way too dry for my taste. Perhaps if you just didn't cook it for as long. The sauce, on the other hand was great! I wish I could give it more stars, but this just wasn't that amazing.
