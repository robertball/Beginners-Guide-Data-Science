*** EXCELLENT!!! ***  I made this twice within 2 days and it is gone!  I took some to a holiday party on a tray of frosted cookies, chocolate peanut butter balls, and gingersnaps.  It added a nice color and appealed to many people who wanted a healthier looking cookie. Delicious! Rave reviews by everyone who tasted it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of chopped almonds instead of pecans and I drizzled the condensed milk over the mixture when it was in the pan - not as messy as trying to stir it.  Be careful about the time 22 minutes was perfect for mine to maintain chewy texture, 25 minutes on the second batch came out a little too crispy/dry (but we still ate them!). This is now one of my favorites for any time of year.

Have made these for my husbands work, for family gatherings, and my daughters preschool events.  Every time I take them, someone asks for the recipe.  They are incredibly easy to make, taste great and are a nice change from the chocolate based bars/cookies I usually make.

One change I made is I don't mix the ingredients.  I just pour them on the crust making sure coconut is last, then pour the condensed milk over the top.  Make sure they cool completely or you will have a very hard time cutting and serving these bars.

These bars are wonderful!  Everyone loved them, and they are very pretty. They are VERY easy to make.  I would add that cooling them ALL the way makes them much easier to cut and remove from the pan.

YUM!!!  My husband said that these are his new all-time-favorite cookies.  They are super easy, and really good.  I left out the nuts because my son is allergic to nuts, but I think that the nuts would make them even more irresistible!

I made these for a big party.  They were wonderful and easy to make.  I would recommend plumping the dried cranberries in hot water for a few minutes.  Drain before adding them to the mix, of course.

The school that I work at has red and white as their school colors, and every Friday is red/white day.  I made this and they were gone by lunch.  I did use fat free condensed milk because that is what I usually have, and they still turned out wonderful.  Next time I will line the pan, as they did stick a little.

A definite winner in our yearly cookie contest.  Nicely different from traditions dark chocolate desserts and visually appealing.

a little too sweet for my taste but has potential!  next time i would use milk chocolate chips instead of white chocoloate to make it a little less sweet - and maybe evaporated milk instead of condensed. Very pretty for the holidays though.

Omigosh, these were SO rich and delicious!  I made one modification, which I rarely do when I'm making something for the first time.  I didn't have the full amount of cranberries, so I added chopped, dried apricots.  Wow, it was so good.  I'm thinking of making more of these even though I made them last week.  Definitely a keeper!

These are to die for!  Not being a chocolate fan, I substituted chopped dates for the chocolate chips.  I also chopped the pecans instead of using them whole.  When I make them again, I might reduce the graham cracker crumbs to 1 cup, as the crust was a bit crumbly.  Wrap these bars individually in plastic wrap as a terrific holiday gift -- they mail very well if carefully packed.

I've made these bars several times for bake sales and events and actually had people go to great lengths to track me down   and get the recipe.  It's always a hit!  The only change I make is to coarsely chop the pecans before adding to the mix.

I love cranberry and thought that I would like these more than the traditional seven layer cookies/bar. But I didn't. I think it is the white chocolate. Not a huge fan.  They were pretty for a Christmas cookie platter. I was able to find unsweetened coconut so I used it. These bars are plenty sweet.

I can't give this 5 stars only because I am not a fruit/chocolate lover.  However, in all fairness, the rest of the family LOVED them at Thanksgiving.  The whole batch was gone quickly and they're incredibly easy to make.  I, like another reviewer, also poured the condensed milk on top of the cranberry layer.

So easy and amazing!  Followed directions very closely with 2 exceptions: used almonds instead of pecans, and did not mix the sweetened milk into the other ingredients (would have been a sticky mess!) but drizzled it thoroughly over the top instead.  Absolutely delicious, great holiday treat.  Only complaint is that the crust is pretty fragile, but it's so tasty I wouldn't want to change it.

Very easy to make. Everyone loved them except my husband. He prefers Oatmeal Raisin Cookies instead. The only change I made was I didn't have quite enough white chocolate chips, so I add 1/2 cup cinnamon chips. Everything else was the same.

These bars were pretty good.  Next time, I would use less than the whole can of sweetened condensed milk - I thought it had a strong, unpleasant flavor in parts of the bar where it was poured on thicker. I used both white and semi-sweet chocolate, which was very good. I think it would be interesting to experiment with a pretzel crust.

My husband devoured these like a starving man! 
He liked them better the next day after they had hardened. I liked them fresh out of the oven because they were gooey and rich!
I'm making them again this week!

I ate this bar at a party in Jakarta, Indonesia and then there was a mad rush for the recipe.  It is so much better than with   other ingredients.........so tasty but not too heavy...great for a tea.

This recipe was a hit! I have requests for it. I didn't have dried cranberries, so I froze fresh ones, and smashed them into small pieces. I also substituted almonds, which worked nicely.

Absolutely fabulous!!  I chopped the pecans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Will definitely make again, perhaps toasting the nuts next time.

I tried this along with a few other recipies. My beyond finicky roommate, who refuses to even touch anything that his mother didn't make tried a small bite after smelling it. And he convulsed in his chair for about 3 minutes before giving me an almost frightening grin. I don't think the pan is going to last the night. A MAJOR winner. SOOO easy to make.
My only change to the recipe was to add about 1 C more graham cracker mix to the base. Otherwise the bottom of the pan wouldn't have been covered. Still.....WOW. And as for ease, I think it is probably the EASIEST and best tasting desert bar recipe I've ever found. Try it....you wont be sorry, although your thighs might!!!!

This recipe is a keeper. I could eat all of the pan myself! It is very pretty.

These are so easy to make. I have been making these for years. They are a favorite at all my holiday events. I have standing requests for my Christmas bars every year. I do change the nuts I use based on sales and what I have on hand. Pecans are my personal favorite :)

These are pretty addicting. The taste was great especially if you like coconut and cranberries. Very easy to make.

They were ok. Not super special. I like magic bars much better.

Better than I thought they would be- considering the condensed milk mixed with the others didn't look so appetizing. It was incredibly easy - although you have to be careful putting the sticky top stuff on the graham cracker crust (try to evenly disperse from bowl instead of spreading from the center). I almost thought I over cooked them but they turned out perfect!

Personally, I thought these were good but not great. However, I gave them ***** because of the tremendous reviews they got at my office holiday party! They were definitely the hit of the buffet line and people could not stop talking about them!

This is an absolutely delicious bar.  Cooking time of 26 minutes was perfect for soft, chewy bars.  I did cut back a little on the pecans, putting about 1/2 a cup, and also chopped them into smaller pieces.

Wonderful. Made a few batches and have a couple of tips:

Use all pecans. I didn't have enough the second time so I substituted half walnuts. This is a mistake... the walnuts are too soft and really change the bar.

If you're not a fan of white chocolate, consider using half white, half semi-sweet chips. I don't like white chocolate so I tried a half and half and a batch with all semi-sweet. The half and half was better.

I made these at the end of my annual Christmas cookie baking marathon. Didn't have the full amount of cranberries, so used golden raisins to make up the difference. Yummy! Also, they set up better the next morning - pretty crumbly coming out of the pan just after baking and cooling. It is a very pretty cookie and a no-brainer to make, and got rave reviews from one of my favorite co-workers (he LOVED the graham cracker crust - go figure!)

These were very quick and simple to make.  I thought they were too sweet but got good reviews from my co-workers.  Makes a very pretty bar.
