I tried this recipe before and gave it 4 stars.  This time I made a few slight changes and WOW what a difference!!  You can easily microwave the squash, place skin side down on large plate(prick skin first all over) heat for about 15-20 minutes til tender, I sprinkled with salt and pepper too. Then do NOT use marg..please do yourself a favour and use REAL butter!!  Also a tiny pinch of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon (shhh) it's the secret ingredient!!  Add a good dose of REAL butter again just before serving and a little S & P too.  This got rave reviews for my Canadian Thanksgiving dinner and I've been craving it ever since!

This is a 5 with my modifications, which were minimal.  I baked the squash (I used one long heavy one) cut side down in a 1/4 inch of water, at 375 degrees, for a LONG TIME.  When the skin is burning, the squash is done.  This brings out the flavor and mellows out the texture of winter squash.  I scooped it out and added 2-3 TB of butter and about 2/3 cup sour cream.  No salt or pepper - instead a heatlhy sprinkling of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and allspice (about a pinch of each?).  Blended well with a hand-mixer.  This was FABULOUS.

I have a recipe that is similer, but very different.  First instead of bakinf it with water, bake cut side up with just enough water to keep it from burning and cook a much shorter time(you want it soft but firm). Cut the sour cream in half and add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugarand some cinnamon. Because of the sugar and cinnamon the kids will love it and by not cooking it so long you will have a better texture.

As written this is a little ho-hum as well as slightly problematic but a couple of quick and easy fixes make this the perfect squash side dish. First, use butter, not margarine - nothing beats the taste of real butter.  Second, season this up. I don't like cinnamon or any sweetness with squash, nor do I like any seasoning that overpowers.  A little garlic powder would have been fine, but I also added some Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning as well.  Don't add the full amount of sour cream called for or you'll risk making this too "sloppy."  Once mixed, I turned the squash into a baking dish and put it in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes till heated through. This also dried it out a little and gave it a thicker consistency. When you make this, think mashed potatoes, and what you'd do with them - it would work for this too.  Once out of the oven I topped it with another dab of butter and a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. Now this was good - thick and creamy, delicately seasoned with a subtle and pleasant tang.  This would make a great Thanksgiving dish as it would be very easy to hold in a warm oven or Crock Pot until serving time.  Hubs and I both enjoyed this a great deal.

12/04 edit - My recipe with some changes since '01 - Baked the squash cut side up for more density and that made for a firmer whipped end product. You can also throw the whole mixture back in the oven to cook out some of the excess mositure. Try some Tabasco Chipotle for a little extra spice to it.

This recipe was very good! I took Doug's updated advice and baked it after I whipped it and some of the moisture did bake out of it. It still was a bit runny so the next time I made it, I put some seasoned bread crumbs on the top before baking. This added some extra "texture" to the dish and the flavor contrast was nice. By the way, I also substituted cream cheese for the sour cream. VERY tasty!!

Personally, I like the butternut squash just plain, without any sour cream. It surprisingly sweet, without any sugar or honey!

As written I think this would not turn out very well.  I reduced the sour cream to 1/4 cup, used 1/4 butter and omitted the salt and pepper.  I whipped it up and then stired in some brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon.  Everyone loved it but it really was a pretty big departure from the original recipe.

I had a butternut squash and had no idea how to cook it or what to do with it.  So, I tried this.  We loved it.  I used just a spoon of butter and a spoon of sour cream.  VERY GOOD!

This recipe was a good beginning, but not very health-conscious, so I used 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream and no butter/margarine. Turned out well, but next time I think I will reduce the sour cream even more, to 1/4 cup. If you like butter on veggies, the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter 0-calorie spray was a nice touch.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!
Like other reviews I cooked the squash with some cinnamon.  Had to use 1/4 cup of cream cheese and 2 tablesppons half and half instead of the sourc ream and it turned out awesome.  I will definately make again with the sour cream.

I halved, seeded, and peeled the squash, put in 1 inch of water and microwaved for 20 minutes (then you don't have to handle a steaming hot squash)--cut the cook time down dramatically.  I then put the cooked squash into a mixing bowl and beat it with olive oil (instead of butter), cayenne pepper, fresh thyme, salt, pepper, and greek yogurt (instead of sour cream; you could also do plain yogurt).  Turned out wonderfully!

Very good. I added several tablespoons of brown sugar, some allspice and cinnamon.  And, I baked the squash first, then put it in the food processor with ingredients.   Will keep and use again with those adjustments.

Nice!  Very simple recipe but I totally enjoyed it.  I didn't have sour cream so I used 0% Greek yogurt and low calorie butter and it came out delicious and lower calorie.    I also steamed the squash.

delicious taste!  I gave this 4 stars because the technique was awful.  to fill & cover with water, is A LOT of water which made it heavy and difficult to get in and out of the oven.  also, scraping the squash out of the skin was a bit of a task.  1 hour was too long; the skin was too soft to even spoon it out.  there must be an easier method.

I just finished making this in preparation for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow!  Excellent with a few modifications suggested by other reviewers: I used 2 large butternut squash that I baked for 1 1/2 hours in 1 inch of water until very soft.  I added 1 c of sour cream, about 4 T butter, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cloves.  I used quite a lot of spice- just kept adding until it tasted right.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla- delicious!  I whipped it in my kitchenaid mixer but not too smooth- past experience told me that it would turn into a babyfood consistency!  I will definitely make this again.

Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I drained the squash after removing the skin. I also made this in advanced so it baked in the oven at 350 uncovered for about 30 min just before serving.

This was a super recipe with 2 modifications - real butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I cooked only one squash as directed. I used only 2 T of butter and 1/2 c sour cream since I only cooked one squash. Cinnamon sprinkled on top before serving was perfect. It was delicious!! I've never cooked butternut squash before and I'll be going to this recipe again. It was a hit.

I cooked my squash based on this recipe, it looks like the amount of margarine and sour cream are very high! but butternut squash come in different sizes so maybe mine were on the smaller side  I cut the squash in half and seeded it and cooked it in the microwave until tender Scooped it out, mushed it, then added a heaping spoonful of sour cream (full fat, that's what I had) and a nub of butter, and some pepper and garlic salt.  It was absolutely delicious and really easy, thanks for the inspirations!

Wow, what a pleasant surprise this was!!  I absolutely loved it! Yes, I can see how people would add brown sugar, cinnamon, etc. to this but it changes what this particular recipe is supposed to be. Both ways are excellent(but DIFFERENT RECIPES!). Thank you, Dave, for a very easy & delicious recipe!! Love, love, loved it!!

This was a pretty good dish. I did bake mine for a while after mixing it as it was a little runnier than I'd like. However; I did add a little brown sugar and cinnamon as suggested by many in here and I won't do that next time. I think it would've had a more savory flavor if I had just stuck with the salt and pepper! But good all in all.

So I cooked the squash,scooped it, set it in a coffee filter lined colander for like 20 minutes then whipped it, then set it on low in the crock pot. No need to rebake it, and no excess water in it. I do this with pumpkin too, no runny pies. We have 14 or 15 for Thanksgiving so this works great!

My picky parents loved this. I used it as the main dish, and my father didn't even complain that it was a totally veg. meal (I think it was his first). I did add corn, but with or without it, this recipe is a gem!

I liked the taste of this dish but I must say that it's light orange color and squooshy consistency made it impossible to serve to kids. They simply refused to eat it, as did some of the less mature adults at the table. :) Also, it's unpleasant to eat when it gets lukewarm. Just a warning.

This was not what I expected and while it had a good natural flavor it was more like baby food to me, which I have a baby, so I will be making this again.

I thought that this was pretty good and a nice change from just having mashed potatoes with dinner.  My 20 month old really loved them too, so a definite winner in my house!

This is a very good recipe but after reading some of the reviews I decided to add cinnamon.  What wound up happening is that the finished dish looks like sweet potato, smells like sweet potato, and tastes like squash with cinnamon.... I'm going to try it with out the cinnamon next time.

I didn't have any sour cream, so I was forced to omit that.  I also added cinnamon and pumpkin spice.  I loved it, but more importantly, my 21-month-old who has decided to refuse ALL vegetables lately also loved it!  Will be making this again soon (and will probably keep a steady supply ready to go in the fridge!).

I did not like this with the sour cream. It was a disaster and the reviews were too much. I think people should rate the recipe for what it is, not how it is after adding a pinch of this and a whole new list of ingredients.

I made the recipe as suggested by Allison on this thread. I microwaved it after I poked holes in the skin and added S & P. After, I added about 3 tablesppons of margarine and cinnamon and brown sugar. YUM!

Found it didn't need quite as much butter and sour cream.  Could be reduced without changing the flavor and squash wouldn't be quick as "runny"

Hmm.  This was okay.  Roasted it in the over without water and had no problem with moisture.  Just a bit bland, even with salt and pepper.  Needs...something.  If you're looking for a mild side to serve with something more bold, this would probably work.

This is a great side dish.  I added just 1oz of cream cheese to make it a little sweeter and firmer.  Great combination.  Great complement for spicy meat (like jerk shrimp).  Thanks!

Great recipe.  For healthier alternatives, I used non-fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream and the Brummel & Brown vegetable spread made with yogurt instead of butter.

Just ok, I either like my squash sweet with brown sugar or savory like the Amazing Squash recipe with onions.  This one I could really taste the sour cream which I thought I would like but I didn't...sorry.  I just want to read a recipe and not change things too much

This definitely inspired me- I took it a little further and added 1/2 c. canned carrots, a couple drops of truffle oil and didn't whip it up, but instead smashed it with a fork for a lumpier texture. I'm addicted!

I gave it a 4 'cause I was inspired by this recipe.  I did 1 large squash in the microwave (8 minutes, turn over, 8 minutes, leave steaming for 10).  I used the sour cream and butter... but after I blended, I added a cup of unsweetened applesauce, too.  Turned out YUMMY!  Thanks for posting your recipe.  :)

This is a very easy, delicious and healthy recipe and I prefer it with just a couple of small changes.  Slightly reduce the sour cream, use real butter of course, add a little cinnamon, and then add real maple syrup to taste.  The maple syrup makes this recipe amazing and it adds a few more antioxidants.

The recipe is good but I guess it was simply just not what I was looking for. It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked. I added some maple syrup to it before anyone in the house would eat it.

I cut this in half since I only had 1 squash and I peeled it, cut it in chunks, sprinkled the salt over and microwaved it with some butter until it was tender. Then I used a fork to mash it and only used half the sour cream as it was all I had. I left off the pepper at hubby's request. This was alright but seemed like they needed more moisture as the squash absorbed it all and these were rather thick. This was good, but we prefer ours the sweeter traditional way with brown sugar and butter. Thanks for the idea, it was a nice change.

Very good, but add wet ingredients slowly. It can be too watery if your not too careful.

Very tasty and easy to make. Made with acorn squash, as there was no butternut available. It's nice to have squash without added sweetness. Creamy and delicious. Thanks!

i made this recipe simpler because i was trying to find something easy for my mom to make and healthy.. i bought the already cubed butternut squash in a package, seasoned with salt and pepper and garlic powder and cooked it at 375 for about an 1 hr 15 min.. then i mashed it and added 3 tbsp of "i cant belive its not buttter" and thats it.. easy and healthy side dish! thanks for the inspiration

Great recipe, really easy! To make it low fat I substituted skim milk for the margarine and used fat free sour cream. I will definitely make this again!

This was surprisingly good, since I'm not a huge fan of squash all by itself (love stuffed squash though). Nice flavor, I used less margarine and sour cream than called for, but more than some of the reviewers. Good Thanksgiving side dish!

Very good, I tasted it before adding the sour cream and I think next time I won't add any sour cream-the squash flavor was better that way.  I added just 1/2 cup sour cream-my picky husband liked this recipe.  First time cooking a whole squash-pretty easy!

Unbelievable!!  My girls actually ate squash!!  Very tasty!  I baked the squash covered, halved side up with about 1" of water.  I also added a little cinnamon and sugar.  I think the sour cream is what gives it that awesome flavor!  Will become part of the weekly dinner rotation!!!!  :)

This was NOT a hit with our family.  It was way to close to baby food butternut squash and the sour cream overpowered the squash.  It reminded us of baked potatoes.  We won't be making this one again-kids wouldn't touch it and adults only ate enough to be polite.

I made this, but with a couple of changes. I cooked it split in half, like they say, and spoon out all the inside (I took the seeds out earlier). Then I melted butter with it and mashed it with a potato masher, and worked in about 2 tablespoons of regular sour cream. I mixed in pepper and garlic salt, and also added in some parmesan cheese just for a variety of flavors. It turned out really good, but I wouldn't follow the recipe exactly, just mix things up based on what you like.

Loved it!  I used butter instead of margarine and added half'n half when I was mashing it.  Added a bit of brown sugar for extra flavor.  It was a big hit on our Thanksgiving dinner.

I had no sour cream but took a chance and used light cream cheese I had on hand. It was really good. I took another reviewers advice and added some garlic powder and parsley. It was very delicious! :) Thanks!

I tweak this recipe by adding about 1/4 c pancake syrup and sometimes a dash of nutmeg. Real butter is a must. Make it extra creamy by using the food processor. My husband loves it!

This wasn't very good...but it was probably my fault.  I broke our mixer recently, so it wasn't really whipped, and I just couldn't get the taste right.

This was my very first time attempting to do anything with some nice looking butternut squash.  My whole family loved the whipped recipe.  I made a few changes.  Used only 1/2 cup of sour cream, and added some brown sugar and whip cream.  Yum yum.  I am keeping this thanks.

This was pretty good! I think next time I will reduce the amount of sour cream. It was very rich and I was only able to eat a small amount, but that's okay! It also seemed to help fill me up for the rest of the meal (I nibbled a bit as I made this). We cooked the squash for an hour, cut side down, and it was VERY soft. We didn't even need to use anything to whip this up other than a fork!

My father is a big squash fan, so I made this for him and he loved it. I love that it's not saturated with too much spices, or flavors, so it lets the butternut squash flavor ride on it's own. Delicious.
