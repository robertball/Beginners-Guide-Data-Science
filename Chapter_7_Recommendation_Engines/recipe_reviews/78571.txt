This is a great recipe using venison. I'm amazed at the low ratings, must be new. It's hard to cook great meals with venison without going the extra mile to get some of the gamey flavor out. I added potatos and carrots. Had to use a cup of water,a full 15 oz can of tomato sauce and only used one lb of venison. The tomato gravy turned out excellent in thickness. Like a lot of my tomato based stews, I added 1/4 cup ketchup,a tbsp of worcestershire and two tsp of bacon grease. Wow, delicious! This is a keeper. I challenge anyone to try this.

This was good stew, even better the second day.  However, I don't think venison should be cooked this long, as it has little to no fat content.  As often happens, some bites were tender and others were chewy and dry.  I used a cut labeled by my hunter as "hind roast."  I'd be interested to know what cut of meat others used.  In my opinion, the gaminess that some people complain of is due to the age of the animal or perhaps not butchering promptly.  The meat my hunter provides always has a pleasant flavor.

Very good! I tried two variations, on the first I added two large potatoes and it was great! On the second, I added 1TBS fresh rosemary and served over pasta, wonderful again! This dish has a lot of Tuscan overtones and is really good!

This recipe is hard to beat and hard to mess up! We have it often. I like to marinate my venison overnight in red wine, vinegar & oil dressing and Adolph's tenderizer.  Sometimes I don't even brown the meat first, just toss it all in with a couple of beef bullion cubes.  If you add cut up potatoes, corn, and baby lima beans you've got Brunswick Stew!  A dash of A-1 Sauce really kicks it up a knotch~:)

I have been using this recipe for awhile.I dont pre cook anything. Throw it all in the  pot and let it go...I add no water replaced it with crush tomatoes.  I add French onion soup mix. Even my people who hate venison due to the gamey taste love this....I serve over mash potatoes

I made this recipe with a few changes and it turned out delicious.  After looking at the recipe again, I've noticed that I forgot to add the parsley~ even though I have some growing in my house! LOL I think that would have added even more flavor.  Like others here, I added potatoes and carrots with the other ingredients and cut the venison down to 1 pound.  I didn't have tomato sauce, basil, or oregano so I substituted 1 small can each of pizza sauce and V-8.  I cooked the stew overnight for about 8 hours on low, but the vegetables weren't quite done when I checked it in the morning so I turned the slow cooker on high and cooked the stew for about 2 more hours. At the very end I added 1 cup of frozen peas.  It is an excellent, flavorful stew and I recommend the recipe to anyone who is cooking with venison.

I enjoyed this so much and so did everyone who ate of it.  I added a whack of mushrooms, because there's nothing like venison and mushrooms.  Portobellas, shitakis and something I found in the local Asian grocery mysteriously called, dried fungus.
I am going to try it minus the mushrooms, but with black currants instead.

This was not very good. I followed the recipe because I had never cooked venison but this was awful. For one thing, the only vegetable with substance was celery. I would recommend adding potatoes and carrots as the stew was not hearty at all. I cooked it on low for 8 hours but the meat practically dissolved. I won't make this again.

This recipe was great.
But i did rub the meat with dry mustard first, it helps cut the gamey taste of the venison. And I added potatoes,carrots and mushrooms. Everyone loved it!

I added a few ingredients to make this stew a little more "diet friendly". I used less meat and added carrots, red potatoes, and fresh mushrooms. I cooked it using the same directions except I added a little more tomato sauce and water. It turned out really well.

My husband wanted to make sure I saved this recipe. I think he gave it 10 stars!!!  Just a few changes...used about 12 oz tomato sauce and one cup low sodium chicken broth instead of the wine and water. ( I didn't have beef broth or I probably would have used that) IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!

Really good way to do venison. I kill and butcher my own deer, this is one of the few ways I have found to  make venison really taste good without the gamey flavor. Add mushrooms and french onion soup mix.

This turned out very nicely, I added some carrots but everything else was followed to the recipe exactly.  The venison was tender and delicious.

This was the first time I made venison stew, this recipe was wonderful. Rich and decadent. I added everything from other reviews that sounded good, the mushrooms, etc. I had homemade canned roasted tomatoes that I added to the mix, extra delicious! Better the next day or even 2 days later in the crock pot. Don't skip out on the red wine, it just won't be the same with out it. Thank you for sharing, Me and mine thoroughly enjoyed this meal!

My husband absolutely loved this, me not so much. I liked to stew itself, but I've discovered I don't care much for venison & the flavor it gives. Maybe I'll try it again with just plain beef.

Fantastic recipe, in my opinion.  The red wine adds so much flavor.  I wanted more veggies so I added 4 sliced carrots and 3 small diced potatoes.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a 6 ounce can of tomato paste mixed with 1.5 cups of water.  Will definitely make this again.

This is, by far, one of the best stews I've ever made.  I've made it countless times, with both beef and venison.  i recommend being liberal with the garlic and adding a liberal amount of Cayenne pepper (if you like it spicy).  Turnips and Parsnips are easily hidden in this stew as well!  I would also mention that no stew is complete without carrots.

I was looking for a basic recipe to tweak to my taste and this is exactly that!  I took the other reviews into consideration and added carrots and potatoes (just wouldn't be a stew without it).  I also can't seem to make a recipe without adding my favorite smoked paprika and also thought I'd add a dash of liquid smoke to enhance the coziness of the dish.  I like lots of flavor, so a good schwack of herbs and a little extra tomato sauce did the trick.
Thanks!!!

I've done this recipe before an loved it, this round I added rosemary and it was fabulous. As a side note to you wild game lovers who hate the gamey flavor. Soak your venison in water  with a table spoon of white vinegar it will help eliminate the  gamey flavor.  You can do this for almost any cut of venison. I never have games flavors with my dishes.

This was a very good recipe. I modified it some (more tomato sauce, potatoes, mushrooms, bay leaf,  corn, peas, green beans, garlic).  My venison was as lean as they come and it was not dry.  How can meat be dry and tough when it soaks in juice for 6 hours+?  The meat didn't taste gamely. Good recipe.

I didn't love it.  The meat was dry and I think the celery overpowered the flavor.  I might try it again with carrots and potatoes instead of celery.

This was really easy to put together and had a great overall taste. I would suggest adding a little sugar to sweeten it up or maybe some sweet peppers and corn if you rather sweeten it naturally.  
I did add another 1/2 cup of water (1cup total) and two red potatos, it gave the stew a great texture. 
Overall a really amazing recipe!

I made this with neck of springbok so unfortunately there were a lot of little bones. However the flavour was good and the meat very tender. I think I will add potatoes next time i make it.
