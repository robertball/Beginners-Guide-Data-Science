My Russian boyfriend recognized the recipe, but thought that the cream cheese was odd. We tried it both ways, and MAKING IT WITHOUT THE CHEESE IS WAY BETTER. I also increased the spices by half.

I really liked the mushrooms and cabbage, but next time I may add carrots as well.

This makes enough filling for two pies, so be sure to have four crusts on hand (two for the tops). I use the premade crusts, precrisped at 375 for 15 minutes, and they always turn out perfect.

My 34 year old copy of "The Vegetarian Epicure," (Anna Thomas, 1972) opens automatically to this page, but it's packed away because I'm in the middle of moving; luckily I found this site--I've just gotten a call to please make what will surely be my 10,000th pie for a family picnic tomorrow.

I've made it every which way: spinach or kale instead of cabbage, a variety of substitute herbs (the curry version was partuclarly good!), a so-so vegan version (tofu cream cheese texture wasn't right), and it's still among my favorite meals of all time.

My folks gave me the book on my 14th birthday in 1974; I had just become a vegetarian -- more because I didn't like the taste or texture of meat/fish/fowl than for any health or political reasons -- and although I was already enthusiastic cook, I was not a very knowledgable cook. Thomas's book (as well as her subsequent volume II) introduced me to enough delicious recipes as a teen to keep even my most meat-focused male friends happy.

Enjoy!

Wow - I was so glad to find this recipe. I used to make it years ago - from a Moosewood Cookbook. It is definitely comfort food and now I use no fat or low fat cream cheese. I use a prepared crust. I do like putting in any vegie I can find -- but diced or grated carrots are great in it because they add a dash of colour. Thanks for reminding me about how it is actually constructed....yummy

I don't usually make recipes like this but this one sounded so good I had to try it. I am so glad I did too! My husband, who doesn't really like cabbage, said he wouldn't mind seeing this again on the table :). The only change I made was using a prepared crust.

I changed the recipe around quite a bit so this rating is based on the changes. I used spinach instead of cabbage added the mushrooms, onions, added carrots and beets, a 1/2 lb of ground beef a condenced can of cream of mushroom soup the marjorium, salt, pepper to taste and some Oregano as I was out of Basil. I made the recipe for baking powder biscuits for the crust and it excluded the egg. I also excluded the cream cheese and added 4 ounces of cheddar. It was delicious! It will definately be a regular!

I was surprised by how tasty this was!  I only used 4 oz of mushrooms, because I was saving some aside for another recipe.  Next time will use the full 8 oz the recipe calls for.  I also used frozen pasty crusts. Very delcious.  Must be a Russian comfort food!

This is my favorite recipe of all time!  My mom would make this for my birthday when I was a kid.  The combination of flavors and textures is just perfect!

I love this tasty, zesty trip to eastern Europe.  I prepare it often. I don't have children, though; children usually hate cabbage, so this is not likely to be a big family hit.  but good for grownups!

I have been making this for almost 30yrs and I LOVE it! I use Italian Seasoning instead of all the other seasonings as it is just eastier for me. The crust needs to be thin, as it is not real flaky and needs to cook for a while. Cook the cabbage down along with the onion and seasoning and a head of cabbage won't seem like a LOT. Everyone in my family LOVES this, but it is fun to experiment with it also. I was so happy to find this!! I lost my recipe in my last move.

Had some trouble getting the pastry together and there was barely enough for both crusts.  Also, it seems no-one else had this problem, but I had WAY too much cabbage!  Even half a head was too much.

Actually, I enjoyed the dish; but, I was the lone holdout in the family.  My wife stated that whe thought something was missing.  The kids all rejected it and opted for PBJs instead.  The family's overall score, therefore, was 2.4 stars.  

The recipe was straightforward and I ran into no problems fixing it.  Start to finish, it took about three hours to prepare.

This was amazing!  I am always searching for something Russian to prepare for a boarder who lives here.  This sure brought a smile to her face and we will be having this for dinner again!  I am searching still for a recipe for "kutya" and whatever holiday foods I can find for her.  yum....

Quite tasty.  The mushrooms clashed with the other flavors, in my opinion.  I would like to try with roasted nuts, or maybe potatos replacing the mushrooms.

My son really liked this, but my husband couldn't get past the looks of it. What a role reversal! I thought it was ok (edible, but not great), but high calorie for what it was. Next time, I'll just have mac and cheese with veggies on the side for about the same calories!

Used this recipe @ a pie contest and won most unique eat! Added shredded sweet potato to give more color and a tad of sweetness. It was awesome! Would add a small amount of additional sweetness to the recipe: otherwise it was fantastic!!

All was well except for the crust.  There was not enough crust to cover my pie, so i had to thin it out.  It came out of the oven, a little burnt and bubbled.  This may just be me, but next time I'd follow my own recipe for crust.

I've been making this pie for years - great for vegetarians! I saute the cabbage, onions and mushrooms together and the only seasoning I use is a lot of dill. Everyone loves it!

It was great! I put peas in with the mushrooms. For the dough, I added a little bit of water to help the ingredients come together.

This was ok but certainly not great, and I doubt I'll make it again anytime soon.  I used to make, and love, something very close to this (Vegetarian Epicure? Moosewood?); I don't like it nearly so much now.  It was both bland and overly rich.  It did taste better the second day, and I could see making something similar -- the hard-boiled eggs were a very nice touch, and with different or additional spices the filling might be good.

Specific comments:  doubled herbs and half the cabbage still made for a somewhat bland filling (and it was a heaping amount).  I used lower fat cream cheese, but it was still unpleasantly rich; maybe less would help, or something totally different. It may also be that the richness of hard-boiled egg yolks is enough on its own.  I used premade pie crust but don't think that affected my rating.

I did not use tarragon or marjoram used thyme instead for both and added grated carrots, otherwise did everything else per instructions. This is a really good recipe.

I made this for a Russian Dinner Party with my club, knowing there were a couple of vegetarians in the group. Everyone liked it, especially one of the non-meat eaters. Be aware, the onions, cabbage and mushroom filling will easily fill two 9 -inch pies; you should cut back on the cabbage for just one pie. I used a roll-out pre-made pie crust, which was lovely.  The photo shows a single crust pie, but the directions say to top with another crust. I did the latter, and it was great!

My father made this a lot when I was in high school because I decided overnight to be a vegetarian and my parents didn't really cook with meat very often. It was a hit no matter how often he made it. It always felt like there was too much cabbage, but he would make it fit and it would cook down - helped that he used a souffle pan instead of a pie pan. 

This was published in a book called The Vegetarian Epicure and I've had a devil of a time finding a copy - glad to find the recipe here but feel the author should acknowledge the original source.

I have been making this recipe from my original Anna Thomas cookbook since 1973. (That particular page fell out and then the whole book fell into halves. It makes it easier to copy for friends that way, tho.) I have made it numerous times and even my Russian daughter-in-law says it is quite authentic. It's a keeper.
