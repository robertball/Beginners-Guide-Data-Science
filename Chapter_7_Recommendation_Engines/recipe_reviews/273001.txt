Easy to make recipe, fluffy and delicious. I was skeptical about 2 Tbs of lemon juice and I was right. They are a bit 'lemony' IMO, for cream horns. They are delicious, but I love lemon. I'll cut back on the lemon juice next time and maybe a bit more sugar. Yes, they are way less sweet than the store versions.

Easy and tastes great!  I made 12 horns and doubled the filling recipe and have enough filling for a dozen or two more!  Will get more pastry dough tomorrow!!
