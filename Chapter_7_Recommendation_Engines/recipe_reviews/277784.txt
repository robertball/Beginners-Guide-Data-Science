This stuff is awesome! My first time making "bang bang" anything, and I was pleasantly pleased! We've only eaten at Bonefish Grill one time, and we DID order the bang bang shrimp (because of all of the rave reviews about it all over the place). The only change I made to the recipe is that I only used 1/3 cup mayonnaise (as I was scraping the jar to try to get to 1/2 cup, but I just couldn't get there, and didn't want to run to the store). It was perfect for my taste, and I'd probably use that same amount next time. I dredged some shrimp in corn starch and pan fried those for about 2 minutes, turning half way, and then tossed them in the sauce. DELICIOUS! Can't wait to try it with chicken!
