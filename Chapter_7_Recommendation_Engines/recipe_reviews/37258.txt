This was a nice change from traditional pumpkin pie.  The filling had a deeper flavor because of the apple butter (I used the All Day Apple Butter from this site).  The streusel topping was nice, but I think it would have been good without it, too.

My family voted that this was the best pumpkin pie they have ever tasted!  I made it with a gingersnap cookie crust and it turned out perfect.  I also added in a little ginger along with the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I personally loved the streusel topping!

Delicious and unique pumpkin pie recipe.  I liked it because you still have the traditional pumpkin pie flavor, but with an interesting twist. The topping!  The pecans were a nice touch too.  My husband and I both enjoyed this pie and I will be making it for Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks for sharing!

Such a wonderful twist on the old pumpkin pie recipe.  I left out the nuts for my husband, and it didn't make a difference.  What a wonderful recipe. Thanks.

Delicious!  Like reviewer Emily, I used the All Day Apple Butter from this site (fantastic!).  We all loved the taste of this.  The topping was a nice change from traditional pumpkin pie.  I will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

This recipe was not only easy to follow, but the results were amazing.  the richness of the pumpkin is enhanced by the use of apple butter.  one thing i did add however, was i added some chopped walnuts in the struesel topping.  this has quickly become a staple dessert in my household.

Like another recent reviewer pointed out: Chilling in the fridge over night made all the difference in the world. A must do - for flavor blend & texture improvement! Before the fridge: 2 star.

Very delicious!  The apple butter added a bit of sweetness that was very good for the pumpkin flavor.  The recipe for the streusel topping made entirely too much for the pie, however.

I made this as originally written and it was very good. I found myself with pumpkin and canned milk left over but not enough for another pie. So, I mixed them with an egg, a dollop or two of apple butter, 3-4 Tbs of sugar and/or honey. a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. I cooked this in a saucepan into a sort of pudding. Then, remembering a dessert my mother used to make, I stirred 3.6 oz (single serving container) of Haagen Daas Dulce de Leche ice cream (vanilla would be good too) into the cooled pumpkin pudding, and froze it. A very yummy dessert!

I was excited to bake this pie because I love pumpkin and apple butter.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  I could not get used to the strange taste.  I think the pumpkin was overpowered; perhaps adding a 1/2 cup of pumkin and decreasing the apple butter by the same amount would improve the taste for me.

It was a very good pie, don't get me wrong, but I was really wanting it taste more pumpkin'y. The apple butter just provided too much flavor to it, I think. Maybe if you were to add more pumpkin and a little less apple butter it would taste better?

Why do I do this to myself? I like traditional pumpkin pie, so I try this recipe for our Harvest Festival at church???? I didn't like the texture, the flavor of nutmeg, or the topping. Sometimes you just have to stick with something you know. This recipe goes in file 13.

This pie was good, but will not replace my "regular" pumpkin pie.  The one person in our family that doesn't care for pumpkin pie thought it was great, but everyone that loves pumpkin pie thought it was good, but not as good as my usual pumpkin pie.  I'll make this one again, but not to replace my usual pumpkin pie!

Made this as stated.  I was not a fan of the topping.  As a pie it tasted just OK. Out of the 6 of us, 5 liked regular pumpkin pie better.  I probably will not make again. 
Revised: the day after, after being refrigerated this pie tasted realy good.  If I make this again I'd make it a couple day ahead and put in the fridge until serving.

This is well worth the effort! I have made this for Thanksgiving 2008 & 2009 and everyone raves! A hint when making the apple butter I don't use a slow cooker, I cook on the stove approx 1 hour then transfer to blender. Puree well and return to stove approx another 30 min and it is excellent. I freeze the left over apple butter. The pie freezes well too. Good luck.

I did not add the streusel topping due to lack of time.  I thought this was a great variation on the standard pumpkin pie.  It was very moist and flavorful.

I made this for thanksgiving this year for a change-up from the usual pumpkin pie.  I had mixed reviews:  my mom said it was "ok", but she LOVES plain old pumpkin pie.  My husband and I loved it---the spices from the apple butter give it a real depth of flavor, and also lighten the texture a bit.  I could eat this pie year round!

This recipe is amazing.  I made my own apple butter and puree my own sugar pie pumpkins to go into it. Only problem I have with this recipe is that if the pie shell isn't cooked prior to putting the filling in it will be slightly raw. Best thing to do is fully cook the shell and then put the filling in. Once I figured this out it was the absolute best pie ever.

This was a really easy recipe, and my family absolutely loved it!  It has a stronger pumpkin taste than an apple butter taste, but the two combine to make a creamier texture.  The topping was a perfect compliment to the filling.

I always bring the pie to Thanksgiving dinner and I wanted to try something different.  This pie was good, but I did not taste any of the apple butter.  I was dissapointed since I made the apple butter myself, but the apple butter added more texture to the pie.  I found the pie lasted a couple days longer than a regular pumpkin pie, tasting better every day (It only lasted two day after the dinner). Overall, good recipe...my mom wants it to become the "traditional" pumpkin pie of Thanksgiving!

This Thanksgiving I was relegated to making the dessert. When sugesting pumpkin pie, everyone gave me that "whatever" look. None of us being pumpkin pie fans, all of us went crazy over this pie. What a delightful change from the boring old off the can recipe.
This will now be my standard for Thanksgiving pie.

Great recipe!  I halved the spices and added a few tiny dashes of pumpkin pie spice.  I like a well done crust - so I baked mine for 8 minutes (depends on your oven) before filling it.  I also used a 10 inch pie plate - which helped me fit all the topping on!  Thanks for sharing - it was a great dessert for Thanksgiving and we had it with coffee the next morning for breakfast!!

This was wonderful!! I had lost a recipe for this pie by Paula Deen and was so happy to find one here! Incredible...used the Apple Butter II recipe by diane off this site. Always get requests for this recipe. We personally like it better without the streusel, but that's just us. It's still an awesome pie.

A definite keeper and a feature at my Thanksgiving table. I used one of those " unroll-it" pie crust & used walnuts instead of pecans. It was great!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made.  I always thought regular pumpkin pie was too much pumpkin, the applesause cuts this and makes the texture creamier.  Everyone just loved it, and it will be our new "special" Thanksgiving and Christmas pie.

Even though I was only able to eat a small sliver of a piece on a very full stomach, I could tell this was delicious and cooked perfectly. It disappeared quickly. I will definitely make this again. Not a recipe for a deep dish pie plate/shell.

I used some apple butter with honey I made from this website and it was delicious. Since I had so much nutmeg and spice in my apple butter I noticed that my pie tasted better without adding more nutmeg.  Great pie!

Made exactly as written. (And really, if you are going to rate a recipe, shouldn't that be a requirement?!) 
I was really disappointed! I REALLY wanted to like this recipe. I was hoping for a pumpkin pie that was jazzed up a little. Unfortunately, the apple butter completely overpowered the pumpkin. It didn't taste like pumpkin pie at all. I suppose if you are wanting something that isn't like a pumpkin pie this would work. I'm going to be going back to my old standby--the recipe from the back of the pumpkin can.

I made this tonight for a thanksgiving get together- and it was very good! I followed a previous reviewer's advice and put apple in the streusel topping to make it taste more apple-y, and it turned out well, and gave it a little crunch. My streusel was too buttery, so I don't think it was quite as crumbly as it was supposed to be, but it was still delicious- and the pumpkin apple flavor was very yummy! Thanks for sharing!

Well, I made this one yesterday. We all love pumpkin and love apple butter, so I was anxious to try this one out. Basically, I'd say don't bother. It cooks up just fine, of course, but I was hoping for more apple-y flavor. All the apple butter added was the spices, which you could easily do with a normal pumpkin pie recipe. The ONLY thing worthwhile in this recipe was the crumble topping on the pie. Now, I use a topping like that on all my muffins, but never tried it on a pie. It is very good, and I'll do that part again. But for the base of the pie - nahhhhhhh. Too many ingredients for too little results! I was hoping for a more pronounced apple butter taste in there. So, if you hate your own pumpkin pie recipe, then try this one - otherwise, this will leave you with a partial can of pumpkin, an open can of evaporated milk, and a pie that you'll wonder why you bothered.... sorry!

This pie was raved about on Thanksgiving day.  The apple butter really does add a change of pace from the ususal pumpkin pie. I used pumpkin pie mix with the apple butter, eggs and evaporated milk and it turned out great.  The reason I am giving this 4 stars is I found that this pie has no staying power for another day or so.  By the next day the pie was getting really wet and oozing due to the apple butter I suppose.  So, I'll definitely make this again, but only if the pie can be consumed in one day.

I won't eat pumpkin pie but I definitely ate this!  I used light brown sugar and it came out pretty sweet.  I also threw in extra cinnamon ((which wasn't necessary)) and extra apple butter; I probably could have thrown in more because it still tasted overly pumpkiny.  With a i-dont-have-time-to-make-one store bought graham cracker crust, my household thought the pie was suuuuuuper delicious and that all the tastes worked well together.  It also gets bonus points for being something that no one has ate before. Very original and tasty!

It's very good!! The only thing is that you need to use a fork to stir the streusel or it gets creamy. I loved the pie!!..I made a second one & it turned out great! It makes my mouth water waiting for it to cook!

I personally don't eat pumpkin but all the family does. I started Making this pie several years ago. I've read so many of the reviews on here so I thought I'd give mine. People who like it, love it. Other people don't. This pie is different than traditional in flavor so of course not everyone is going to like it. I always have to make more than one because certain people request it. I've made 8 for one thanksgiving before. So I recommend you at least try the pie and form your own opinion. I also agree with other users. I think you should make the pie as the recipe states if you are going to review. The pie is a good pie. There is nothing wrong with it. Some people's tastes just don't care for it but that doesn't mean it's not worth trying.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. I have been the designated pumpkin pie maker in my family for about 10 years now, and everyone loved the apple butter twist last time. (My grandfather now insists I make it this way every time!) Personally I think I will leave out the nuts and streusel topping this year, and let the pie speak for itself.

This is by far my favorite autumn dessert! I followe the recipe exactly (though walnuts can be substituted for pecans in a pinch). I first tasted this pie at a potluck, and for weeks I searched websites and cookbooks, and I finally found it. The search was well worth the wait, as I plan on making Apple Butter Pumpkin Pie a tradition for my family!

I loved this recipe.  The flavor was wonderful!!  I am always looking for recipes that use apple butter because we make it in a kettle outside every fall so it is very plentiful.  This is certainly a keeper and will be one of my "go to" recipes

My family all loved this pie for Thanksgiving even though I made it with light brown sugar instead of dark. It was very easy and turned out well, next time I'm going to try it with out the pecans.

The bake time is a little off. It should be 400 degrees for 40 mins. The recipe came from FN. With the addition of the topping.

I certainly agree w/DFW STARK that when rating a recipe you are to rate the recipe as it is written, do not rate it with your changes. Otherwise its not a correct rating on the recipe.This recipe is very good if you're wanting something with a bit of a twist from the original.

Delicious! I quite enjoyed this one. The apple butter flavor was very subtle though so I'm not sure it will be a favorite over regular pumpkin pie. I think it is best with a honey graham cracker crust... it was perfect!

Wonderful, however I would suggest putting the topping on either mid way through cooking or at the beginning. I followed the directions and I had to get it to carmelize with the brioler. Otherwise an outstanding recipe!

I do a lot of baking & wanted to try something new. I was excited to find this recipe here. I made it for Thanksgiving and I was really disappointed with it. I followed the recipe to a "t" & it was nothing more than ok to me. It looked beautiful, but it tasted bland. The filling was blah and the topping wasn't very sweet.  I won't be making this again...sorry.

very easy to make and lighter than normal pumpkin pie.  a bit too sweet, but I think that's mostly coming from the pumpkin butter so it cannot be changed.  I am interested in trying this recipe out with other butters (like almond or hazelnut butter).

These 2 flavors compliment each other very well!  I added a little ground clove, used my cookie pie crust recipe, and served with homemade whipped cream.  I added a little too much butter to the streusel topping, but it still turned out great.  Do not skip the streusel, it really pairs well with this pie.

This was delicious!  I listened to others' reviews and added a tad more brown sugar to the pie (only about 1 tsp).  You definitely need to let it sit in the fridge for a day.  When we tried it the night I made it, it wasn't very good at all.  But the next day... wow!  So much better!  The flavor is definitely deeper, more complex.  I used a "old fashioned" apple butter that was farm-style, so I don't think it had much added sugar.  Because of that, I didn't find this pie too sweet at all.  I agree that there was just a tad too much topping.  I added a little brown sugar to the topping as well.  It didn't have a whole lot of a flavor, but it provided a lot of crunch, which was a nice addition to the texture of the pie.  I'd definitely suggest giving this one a try, and make sure you let it sit for a day!

So good! Especially with the apple butter recipe I made from this app!  Didn't have pecans, used wheat germ instead, still came out good.   Will make another without toppings.

Such a creative recipe, and a delicious pie.  My family loves pumpkin pie, apple butter, and pecan pie, so I decided to try it, and I'm so glad I did.  It's a holiday staple in our house now.

Using frozen pie shell is great...just prick it...I followed directions to a tea but the topping with the flour makes way too much. Cut the flour to maybe 1/3 and keep the rest of topping Ingredients the same.

I made this last year for a friend. Oh boy did she love it! She said her and her family ate the whole thing in one night. She  then requested it for Thanksgiving so she could bring it to dinner. That was a hit too! A year later, all she wants is for me to make her this pie again! With that attitude, how can I give anything less than five stars?

I've never been a fan of the taste and texture of traditional pumpkin pie.  But, my family loves them so I always end up making a few around the holidays.  I tried this pie and it's the only pumpkin pie recipe I have liked!

This was delicious. It went over very well at our Thanksgiving.  A great twist on pumpkin pie and especially good way of using up any excess apple butter you might have.    I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out very well.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I expected to taste apple and pumpkin.  We all thought (6 of us) that it tasted like a bland pumpkin pie.  I made this because of all the positive reviews.  I don't get it.  And the streusel topping adds nothing, better off without it.  Two out of six said they'd eat it again but I won't make this a second time.  I wonder if it's because I used Smucker's Apple Butter although no brand was specified in the recipe.

Great recipe and I love the topping!  The only thing I would even consider changing would be to next time add just a little more brown sugar to make the pie a little sweeter.  This could be because the apple butter I made is sweet but not too sweet and is a little tart, so if you're using store bought apple butter you probably wouldn't need to add any extra sugar!  You can taste both the apple and pumpkin, but neither is overwhelming.  My boyfriend said it was phenomenal!  Will definitely make again :)

I was so happy with this pie!  My boyfriend is not a big fan of pumkin pie however this version he raved about!  The apple butter adds just enough extra flavor and the texture is so creamy.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was delicious! I loved the topping. The topping is what makes this pie unique, so don't skip it. This pie isn't much different than a regular pumpkin pie as far as flavor goes, so don't expect something wildly different. It's just good pie!

I thought it was ok, but not great.  I think this could be because my apple-butter was a no sugar added kind, but the pie was tart and not very sweet. Anyway, it wasn't a favorite in my family.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it is very good for something a little different.  However, if you are hankering for just plain old-fashioned pumpkin pie, save this recipe for another day.  It is a delicious pie!

It was just OK...  I used an apple butter from a local farm that didn't have all the added sugar of the store-bought variety.  Maybe that made a difference.  It looked beautiful but was too spicy and not very sweet.  It wasn't what I expected.

This was a really easy recipe to follow, and a popular one too! I made this for a few friends and both pies went.  

Although, I'm trying it again tonight, since I personally wasn't very happy with the taste. It felt like it needed a bit more sugar, and I didn't like the streusel topping. So I'll be using a variation for topping- just cinnamon and nutmeg, and a little pecan design, with whipped cream in the middle, and just a little bit more of brown sugar&spices.

Nonetheless, like I said, a very easy and satisfying recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and the filling consistency was like jelly and would not harden. In addition, the streusel pretty much tasted of flour, and thats all. Needed more cooking time also.

I tried this for Thanksgiving.  It was pretty good but not great.  Almost had too much going on.  Will make again.

LOVE THIS PIE! It's nice to have something different from the traditional pie. I even made one after Thanksgiving because I hadn't had enough!

I don't really like Pumpkin Pie, but this was really good!  I'm a novice at baking, and this was an easy recipe to make. It got rave reviews over Thanksgiving!

This was the first pumpkin pie I've ever made. I used apple butter from a local festival and it was absolutely mouth watering!

Like so many others, I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderful!  I used homemade "All Day Apple Butter" and the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" from this site.  Being a traditional pumpkin pie lover, I was pleased to taste so much of the pumpkin flavor in this pie, even though half of the pumpkin is replaced with apple butter.  The end result was a spiced complex flavor that really complemented the dinner feast.  I agree with another reviewer that, while nice, the streusel topping does not make or break this pie and should be considered optional.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I plan on making this for the other half of the family on Christmas!

Great pie.  The only mistake I made was halving the crumb topping.  I thought it was going to be too much  but I will def use all next time.  Delicious.

not sure if i missed something, but this is one of the worst pumpkin pies i've ever eaten.  i love pumpkin pie and have made a few before, but this one seems bland.

i also put the streusel on top but its not very sweet.  just a blah pie. i was gonna take it to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow but i'll keep it around here i suppose.
