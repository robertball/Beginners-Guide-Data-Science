My oh my, I sure didn’t have a good eye on this one today, despite the fact I’ve been cooking since the dinosaurs roamed the earth and should recognize a recipe I’m not going to like when I see one.  I usually do, but not this time.  Where to begin?  First, as I mixed this up it took on a horrible color.  Given the ingredients, red wine vinegar, a yellow-greenish olive oil, and a brownish-yellowish Dijon mustard, I should have known the dressing would look, well, sort of brownish.  Very unappealing, and I wondered how it would make the pasta salad look overall. We eat first with our eyes, after all. I should at least taste it first. When I did, that clinched it for me.  WAY too tangy, WAY too bold, at least for my taste buds.  I gave up at that point, not even wanting to imagine the damage the addition of three types of dried herbs would do to an already bold, overly acrid/tangy dressing. Perhaps others may still want to give this a try despite this poor review.  Some things could just simply be subjective, a matter of personal preference or one’s own palate.   This just didn’t work for me.

I love every Greek/Italian so the tangy acidity was wonderful! It hit the spot perfectly! I'm a huge fan of anything antipasto and if you are too, you will love it.

I substituted a citrus flavored Rice Wine vinegar, omitting the mustard because I had none. This dressing was delicious!

I found that there was way too much vinegar in this dressing- the second time I made it I only put a tablespoon and a half in and it was perfect (to my tastes). Other than that, it is creamy and flavourful! :)
