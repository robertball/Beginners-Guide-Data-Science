Other than subbing bay scallops for mussels simply as a matter of taste for my family I left this one alone and it was delicious!  My husband added a little heat to his after it was cooked, but it was lovely- and easy too!

Loved it, used just a sausage melody from Costco, but other than that it really is delicious
