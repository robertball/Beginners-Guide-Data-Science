Easy and fabulous!  I recommend that you make this the day before serving.  The flavors were incredible and yummy the next day for the last two pieces left.

I originally got this recipe out of a recipe book and later found out it's on the bakers package of the chocolate squares. So I decided to search and see if it was on allrecipes, which it is. This recipe is easy! I am having a new years after party at my house and am going to have a lot of guests so I decided to make a this, except I didn't bake this in a springform pan but in a muffin pan with liners because  slicing a large cheesecake is a lot of work and it ruins the presentation. It came out NICE! This recipe came out for exactly 2 muffin pans all I did was pat down a tablespoon of the crumb mixture onto each muffin liner and a large dab of the cheesecake mixture and now I have a serving of 24 instead of 12! What a fabulous dessert! Can't wait to entertain my guests!

Just OK. The cake had little texture and an almost childishly simple flavour. Fine to make once, but I certainly won't make it again

This was the very first cheesecake I ever made. It tasted great! I made for my b/f on Valentines Day. It was very rich and will fill you up.

This was very easy and very very good.  I baked it for 55 minutes. However, I did not check it at all while it was baking, and when I took it out it had large cracks in it.  Next time I will pay attention and not bake it quite so long.

Family favorite now.  The only thing I change is purchasing an already prepared chocolate pie crust instead of the Oreo's & butter.

Very yummy.  Very rich.  Mine did not look this pretty.  The top did crack and sink in the middle a bit.   Covered the top with raspberry sauce and nobody knew any different.

Love this chocolate cheesecake. It is delicious. Use a food processor and the texture is amazing. Use a good quality chocolate too.

I am a very experienced baker, having made many cheesecakes. I did not care for this recipe. It is dry and unappealing.
