Helpful tip: Use a turkey roasting bag (i.e. Reynolds) to hold your turkey in the brine and then put into roasting pan for stability and then put in the refrigerator to soak in all the good flavor. When draining brine put turkey in a strainer and cut bag, drain liquid, then lift bag out and drain bird. Easy and worth it...Yumm!

My first attempt at doing a brine and I will NEVER prepare a turkey any other way from now on.  This definitely was out of this world, moist and tasty.  It was very easy to do also.  I just bought a new 5 gallon pail, mixed up the brine and plopped the bird down inside.  Covered it and put it in the garage overnight, then roasted using Alton Brown's method (from Food Network) which was to start it in the oven at 500 degrees for the first 30 minutes, then turned it down to 350 degrees for the remainder.  Awesome, phenomenal....best turkey I ever put in my mouth!!!

I had never cooked a turkey before and decided to add the extra step in brining it.  It was an 18lb turkey so I emptied the bottom drawer from my fridge and brined it overnight in there.  I was only able to put about 3/4 of the water that the recipe called for and was worried that it would be salty but it wasn't.  Also, it would have helped dissolve the salt in hot water and then add the rest of the water.  I added salt and it kind of just sat at the bottom.

I made two turkeys this week (they were on sale). I did what Secret Agent suggested and used a washed out cooler to brine the two. The first turkey I soaked for only about 5 hours and it was just ok (cooked in a bag). However, the second one - OUT OF THIS WORLD is right. It was the very BEST turkey that I have ever ever made... EXCELLENT. The flavor was wonderful !! Thank you so much, I will never cook another turkey without brining it like this again.  

(I used fresh garlic and Rock Salt since I didn't have any other kind of salt)

Excellent brine!  Added a sliced onion to give more depth to the meat and left the peppercorns whole!  Helpful Hint:  1.)  For those concerned about keeping your "bird" cool, clear out your crisper drawer to submerge your bird.  Steady, even temperature with no danger of spoiling!  2.)  Brined turkeys cook faster ~ monitor your bird closely so it will not overcook!!!  Enjoy!

FIRST-TIME BRINERS: AFTER BRINING, YOU MUST THOROUGHLY RINSE THE TURKEY IN RUNNING WATER (about 2 mins) and then PAT IT DRY thoroughly before baking. Also, DON'T BRINE A TURKEY THAT IS MARKED "PRE-BASTED". I suspect one or the other of these is the issue for those complaining about their bird being "too salty" even after cutting back on the salt. Do not cut back on the salt! The rinse and/or the unbasted bird will solve your problem. This recipe is terrific, but the author unfortunately assumed users would know these things. Do try it again!! I add 1/2 can of orange juice concentrate but everything else is the same. If you are using frozen turkey, it should be thawed before brining. A FRESH turkey will always turn out better.

this was the first turkey I put in brine. I let it set two days, used a frozen turkey, about 20 lbs. I added an extra half of this recipe to cover it completely.I put it in a large clean pail/bucket, covered it and put it in the garage(34-35 degrees F. in the garage,) the weather was perfect. when cooked, it was flavorful and really nice.
my husband even commented on the difference. will try with chicken sometime. A+++++

This is the perfect base for killer smoked, deep fried or even oven roasted turkey.  I just bought a new 5-gallon bucket with lid that I could put in a cold corner of my garage for 3 days.  Just remember to drain and dry your turkey extremely well before cooking by any methods.  Even the breast meat comes out as tender and as juicy as dark meat!

Tried this for the first time this Thanksgiving...and I must say it was the BEST turkey I have ever tasted.  I was a little leary at first and hoped that it would be seasoned enough, but it was perfect.  I stuffed the inside of the turkey with a stick of butter, three stalks of celery and about 5 cloves of garlic.  Then placed the bird, breast side down in a disposible roasting pan and covered tightly with foil.  Then a put it on the smoker Thanksgiving morning.  It was the juiciest turkey I have ever cooked!  My family RAVED over how good it was.

This was great. The turkey was so moist and had a wonderful flavor. I was concerned about the stuffing being to salty so I left out the salt in my stuffing recipe. It turned out perfect. Will never make turkey again with out brining it first.

I used this for a thanksgiving turkey.  It gave the turkey great flavor.  I roasted a la Safeway's "2 hour turkey."  Unstuffed, the 22 pound bird was done at 475 in 2 hours.....

Excited to try this brine this year......After reading the reviews, I wanted to send out this note about NOT using black garbage bags for your turkey.  You should not use anything that is not food grade or meant for food to be in.  There are chemicals that they treat those bags with.....so please find Zip-lock or something else that won't make your family sick......I've been to many food safety classes just so you know that I know what I'm talking about.  I'm a caterer and work with school food service too.

Great simple wonder! FYI REGARDING SALT! You can NOT substitute regular table salt for canning or kosher salt. Table salt has MORE salt per measurement since it is a finer grain.  A cup of table salt weighs 10 ounces, while a cup of kosher salt weighs between 5 and 8 ounces.  If you use table salt witht the measurements provided you will have an DOUBLE the amount of salt in the recipe. Thus is the reason why a few in the 2007 holiday season stated it was way to salty.  Cooking is chemistry!

4.5 stars as written, our family gave it a 5 with some small changes.  First, I cut the salt down to 1 cup.  I thought 1 1/2 cups would be to much and it would have been to salty.  I did use the type of salt called for in the recipe.  After reading some reviews, I remembered someone had used large ziploc storage bags.  I can't remember which section of the store they are in, but they are Ziploc brand XL storage bags.  So I used HOT water for one gallon and mixed up the salt and sugar until it dissolved and then added the other ingredients and the 2nd gallon of water.  Then I placed the turkey in the bag and placed the bag in a cooler filled with ice.  Then you don't have to worry about gross turkey juice in your cooler.  I let sit for 2 1/2 days, then drained and patted the turkey dry.  Placed in the roaster and stuffed with quartered apples and an onion.  I roasted it breast-side down at 500 degrees for 30 minutes, then turned it down to 325 and roasted til done.  I made gravy with the drippings using milk and flour.  I DID NOT add salt and if I would have added salt to the gravy, it would have been WAY too salty.  Overall a very good brine and my turkey was very juicy and flavorful.  Will use it for Thanksgiving dinner.

I have been brine-ing my holiday turkeys for years-they are always raved over! My recipe is very similar to this one except I use 1/2 cup kosher salt per 4 cups of water (omit the soysauce). So for a 20# turkey I used 2 cups kosher salt and 16 cups (2 gallons) water. I brine the turkey 40 minutes per pound (too long and the bird will start to turn mushy). Herbs will get lost in the brine so mash them with some butter and tuck them under the skin. This recipe will also brine a large pork loin or other meat. Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!

Best Turkey Ever!  Wow.  Everyone raved about how juicy and tender and flavorful it was.  I agreed. I've never before enjoyed turkey this much.
  I soaked the turkey for 3 days then rinsed it and rubbed butter, brown sugar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into the skin before baking it and got a crispy and flavorful skin, too.

I cut this recipe in half and used it for a 3-4lb. chicken. Left it in the solution for maybe 8 hours then oven roasted it (unstuffed) at 375 for 1 1/2 hours. Absolutely delicious! Possibly the best roast chicken I have ever made. It also made great chicken sandwiches a couple of days later.

Excellent brine. Not too salty. I'm no big fan of Worcestershire but it added a nice depth to the flavor. I added oranges and lime to mine, too. It was perfect amount for my 15 lb. turkey that I put into a 5 gal. drink picnic thermos. As this was right after the Blizzard of 2009, I just sank the covered thermos into a 2 foot snowbank and it stayed nice and cold! I let it brine for about 24 hours.   I did rinse the bird several times and then let it soak about an hour in clear cold water after rinsing to get excess salt off of it before baking. The drippings were then suitable for making gravy and the gravy wasn't overly salty.

This really, really, really is amazing! Our Christmas turkey was super juicy and moist that when hubby carved the turkey, it squirted him in the face. Eeek. We got a 10lb frozen turkey that we defrosted in the fridge for 3 days then brined for 2. We did change some stuff in the brine. What we did was add a whole big onion, a sprig of rosemary from the garden, and more garlic, mixed all the ingredients and cooked everything in the saucepan. We then put the mix into the rest of the water and poured it into the thick black garbage bag with the turkey waiting in it. We made sure we burped the cavity and the entire bag of air so the whole turkey is submerged. 

When we were ready to cook, we RINSED the turkey off thoroughly and patted dry. Then on the pan, rubbed dried thyme and basil all over the bird. Made a tin foil tent over the turkey as it cooked. For a 10lb bird, we cooked at 175C for 4.5hours, covered, and undisturbed. Then for the last 30minutes, opened the tent up to let butter melt on the skin, and loosely put the tent back on.

It was amazing. We also ended up with almost 2 medium-sized saucepan worth of gravy from the drippings. The gravy too was superb!

I used this brine last Thanksgiving and again at Christmas.  I have been cooking the holiday meals for years and this was the most moist, flavorful turkey I had every tasted.  My family raved about how good the turkey was and wanted to know what I had done different.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This is fantastic and I will never make my turkey any other way.

This was delish!  I have never done a brine, nor heard of anyone doing one.  I let it sit outside in a bucket (I live in Alaska) on my deck for 2 days.  Even the dry looking turkey breast, was very moist and tastey!!  Had rave reviews come time to serve!!!  Thank you!!!

This was fabulous! I took someone's advice and used the big Reynold's bag, put the brine and turkey in there and set it in the biggest bowl I had. It worked out great, turkey tasted fabulous!

After this brine, I will never make a turkey without it again.  I have always considered myself to me an ok cook, but even I was impressed with the turkey I made.

This is very similar to the brine I used for the whole and breast turkeys I made for Thanksgiving and Christmas last year. My family fell in love with the brine and smoking method it is now the only way I can make a turkey now. It is important to say that your turkey should be fully submerged in the brine. I did thaw mine first, rinsed and removed the gizzards, neck, and liver. Then placed in into the reynolds bag and was able to fit the whole bird in a large bowl in the refrigerator for 8-12 hours before smoking. When I removed it from the brine, I did rinse the salt off, but then added a few pats of butter and cajun seasoning and let it rest on the counter for 20 minutes before placing into the smoker. OMG, truly out of this world delicious.

This was my first year making the Thanksgiving turkey and we were doing only a turkey breast.  I was told the breast is usually the driest, so I was worried my turkey would be too dry and not flavorful enough.  My family had never used a brine before, but I'm SO glad we gave it a shot!  This brine made our turkey PERFECTION!  It was JUICY!  Since this was my first thanksgiving, my gravy actually didn't turn out - but it was actually OK because the turkey was juicy AND flavorful even without gravy!

I have used this brine several times on my deep fried Thanksgiving Turkey and they have all been amazing.  I do like to let the brid steep a little longer in the brine, closer to 3 days as the brine tenderizes the bird much more.  
    Additionally one trick I use is a clean 5 gallon bucket with a lid to keep the turkey fully submerged(you may need a plate or item to assist with keeping it under), and make sure get the cavity of the bird filled otherwise it will float.

This is the second time I have brined a turkey before cooking.  Our usual turkey consists of my dad smoking and deep frying the turkey, which he did this year as well.  I went and bought a turkey so we could have some leftovers.  I had a 17 lb. turkey and followed this recipe as is, but I did add onion and some liquid smoke to the brine.  I brined for about 14+ hours, as I didn't have 2 days to wait.  I roasted the turkey in the oven for about 4 hours, but I roasted it for the first 2 & 1/2 with the breast side down so that all the juices would drip into the breast meat.  The last hour and a half, I turned the turkey over and roasted it with the breast side up, and continued to baste as it cooked.  NOTE:  I RINSED the turkey thoroughly before roasting.  If you don't do this, it will be overly salty!  This turkey turned out VERY moist and VERY tender!  It had good flavor, but it was just a touch salty.  Not enough for me to complain about, but it was there.  I would certainly recommend this brine and I will definitely do my turkey this way again, because I don't have a turkey fryer.  If I had more time, I would have smoked the turkey too.  This one is a keeper, but remember, THOROUGHLY RINSE the turkey after taking it out of the brine!

This brine gave very good flavour, even after a short time (12 hours).  I had a 10 lb turkey and used my injector to add brine directly to the breast, legs, and thighs.  I added a quartered apple and onion to the cavity along with some orange juice, smoked the turkey for 6 hours at 220f (2 hours smoke/heat, + 4 hours only heat).  75-80c internal temp.  Nice mild smoke and flavour to the bone :o)

Just pulled out the extra Thanksgiving turkey from the freezer and can't wait to try the worcestershire in the brine!  I am making the weekly menu and this is going on it!  If you brine a turkey overnight you can't really go wrong.  We have been brining for about ten years and have found a great and easy way to do it.  We just put it in a clean, strong trash bag (the thick yard ones work well.  You don't want it to tear).  My husband squeezes all the air out (so we never have to add more brine to cover it), then twists it closed very tightly and binds it with a rubber band.  Sometimes I twist up the corners too, or he just puts it in one corner of the bag.  The turkey is completely surrounded by water.  Then we put it in an ice chest, with enough ice to keep it cold, overnight.  (We have even just put it in the fridge right on the shelf if there's room.)  I flip it first thing in the morning.  Take it out about an hour before cooking to warm up a bit, then bake, smoke, fry, grill, whatever!

I do a lot of custom meat smoking and tried this brine instead of my custom blend. The ingredients are simple and you can find them at any super market. It leaves the turkey moist and flavorful the way it should be. Just remember  to stir your brine every 4 to 6 hours after you place your bird in the brine if you can for a more evenly moist bird. Even if you do boil the salt down the ingrdients will settle. Great Brine .  PS. i am a good cook but my spelling not so good.

This is my 3rd attempt at brining a turkey with 3 different recipes. Although my sister swears by it, I find the turkey too salty. This time I rinsed the turkey for 10 minutes, inside, outside and upside down and still too salty. You have to check the turkey temperature every 10 minutes after 2-1/2 hours for a 20 lb turkey (cooked in a bag). The turkeys cook a lot faster when brined and are so easy to over cook. The internal temperature can jump 20 degrees in a matter of minutes. I wish I had some success with this. Thanks for sharing it.

Last Thanksgiving, I used this recipe for the first time in conjunction with the Easy Herb Roasted Turkey recipe also found on this site.  The result was the best turkey my husband and I have ever eaten.  We are making our turkey the same way this year. I stuffed with celery, apples, lemons, onion, and garlic and then roasted it following the Easy Herb Roasted Turkey recipe.  I followed that recipe to the letter.  I'm telling you...that was the best turkey I've ever tasted.

I have used this recipe 3 years in a row. I just made it again today. This plus Alton Brown's turkey recipe = the best! My 72 year old father-in-law said it was the best turkey he's EVER eaten! I lovingly get teased from my mother-in-law about it every year! I use a cleaned out ice chest and cover the top layer in 3" of ice cubes and store it outside (I live in the NW and the outdoors keeps it cold).

My husband thought this was great. I did not.  I left it in the brine for 2 days like it was recommended, but it turned out too salty for my taste.  The flavor was great, so next time ill leave it in for less time.

Cut the recipe to 2 servings, and brined 4 boneless skinless turkey breasts.  This was some of the best turkey I've ever had.  Moist and juicy.  To prepare them I buttered them, sprinkled with a little seasoned salt, and put them in a slow cooker with a little water and slices of celery and onion.  Wonderful!  Don't think it was the slow cooker because these were better than anything I've had out of a Crock Pot, too.

The name of this recipe says it all!  I halved the recipe and used it to brine a chicken instead of turkey.  I then slowly roasted the chicken over indirect heat on my charcoal grill with hickory chips to get the smokey flavor.  It was by far the best chicken I have ever had.  It was so moist-even the breast meat!  I won't ever make chicken without brining it first again!

This was by far the best way we have found to prep a turkey for cooking. We only brined the turkey for about 18 hours, but next time will definitely do it for at least 24...Overall very good recipe.

Phenomenal!  I used it twice already to brine turkeys and my mother used it once to brine a pot roast.  We both skipped the brown sugar - just didn't see the need for it.

The results with this brine were excellent. This is definitely the best turkey I have made. I followed the recipe exactly, except used a mixture of kosher salt and sea salt. Next time if I am using this kosher/sea salt mixture, I will probably reduce the salt by 1/4 cup or so as the turkey was a little saltier than I would have liked - but noboby else thought so and everyone RAVED about the flavour and juiciness. I used a roasting bag to brine, as recommended - placed the bag in a foil roasting pan, added the turkey then poured in the brine. I then placed it on the roasting pan tray from the oven. Let it sit in the fridge overnight, stuffed in the morning,  rubbed with canola, then roasted it at 450 degrees for 30 minutes, then 350 for 3 hours (it was a 19 lb bird). It was not difficult and the results were amazing. This is the only way I will be cooking turkey from now on.

Buy an extra large roasting bag, put turkey in the bag and put it in a large cooler pour the brine to the bag and tie ... add ice to keep cold.
Leaves fridge free for other things:)

Moist! I have never had a turkey be this tender and moist before! There is no need to season the turkey, the brine imparts so much flavor! I used Alton Browns cooking technique, as mentioned by another reviewer. Start it at 500 degrees for the first 30 mins. then lower it to 350 and cover the breast with foil, till its done cooking. Thank you Sudemers for posting this recipe.

I WISH I COULD RATE THIS 10 STARS!!!
Every Thanksgiving we have 40 people and do 3 turkeys in a roaster/smoker with light smoke.  I decided to try this brine based on the reviews.  We usually get great raves on our birds.  Everyone said that these were the best we have ever done!!  All of the leftovers were taken by our guests.

I used garbage bags to seal in the brine.  If you do this, make sure that you remove as much ari as possible from the bag and tie it good.

I highly recommend this recipe.

Never have I used brine before and I was a little nervous as to how my bird would turn out. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  We will never eat turkey any other way! Hope to try it with pork next. We cooked the turkey using "Garbage Can Turkey" by GLORIA2003 from Allrecipes.

Amazing! Did the brining in the bottom drawer of my fridge. Cooked the turkey in an oven bag. Best turkey ever! Saving to do again!

This was excellent.  First time I have used a brine and the turkey was moist and tender; even the next day the leftovers were great.  There was no need to season the bird before cooking, it tasted perfect.

Followed the recipe exactly-  I brined the turkey in a jumbo size ziplock bag overnight, (11 lb fresh turkey) . Put the turkey and brine in the ziplock then put this inside a big plastic bowl in the fridge and it worked well.   This was the juiciest and best turkey we ever had, everyone loved it. Also made gravy with drippings- a little salty but we liked it salty so it was good.  Absolutely will make again and again. As an additional note I now use a round Igloo cooler (used at construction sites for water) to brine in, it works perfect.

If I could give this recipe a 10, I would. It made my first venture at roasting a turkey perfect.

Out of Worcestershire sauce, I used an equal amount of low sodium soy sauce, substituted sea salt for canning salt, and added in onions as per another reviewer.
Following another reviewer, I found 2.5 gallon Ziplock bags that were the right size to hold all the liquid and the medium size turkey I used. I brined it the whole two days, patted it dry, and roasted with Italian seasoning. 
Utter perfection. 

Next time I will probably rinse the turkey, then roast it, because a lot of the salt settles at the portion of the turkey at the bottom of the bag.

I seldom write reviews, but I must say, all the folks who said this was the best brine recipe they'd had were not lying!  I followed it exactly as written, along with the advice to integrate the salt by boiling it with some of the water before adding it to the rest of the mix. It truly was the best turkey I'd had in a long time.

We have been wanting to try brining poultry for some time now, finally decided this was the time. WOW! Wish I did this sooner! I doubt I will ever cook a turkey again without doing this. It is IMPORTANT to make sure the bird in question IS NOT "pre-basted" or "contains up to 15% of a solution to enhance flavor" or any such mess. If you brine a bird like this, it will be too salty to eat. I DID bring half the water to a rolling boil, added the ingredients and the rest of the water (as cold as possible). Put this large pot in my cooler, poured ice all around it and added a 6 lb. turkey breast. Let it sit 24 hours and roasted it in the oven. Wife said it was the best turkey I ever made, possibly the best she had ever eaten! And she likes dark meat!  I can't WAIT to do this in my smoker...

Simply the best. I add onion and quart of chicken broth and quart of vegetable broth. Mesquite smoked to 150 degrees. If you were a dog you'd get down and roll in this. Great brine!

I lined a 5 gallon bucket with a large 30lb turkey bag and followed the recipe as written. The turkey was in the brine 17 hours. Most tender turkey I have ever cooked! The temperature outside was cold enough, it would have been a challenge to get it in the fridge.

This is THE best brine ever! We used this before smoking a couple of Butterball frozen turkey breasts (netted kind). I reduced kosher salt only because this turkey has already been "marinated" or injected with seasoned solution to keep moist-and it turned out fantastic! Hubby took to work and his co-workers are now requesting it for the Christmas buffet...one even asked him if he would smoke her turkey for home! Tried several other brines but this is far and away the best! Cant wait to do a "real" turkey with this- thanks for the EXCELLENT recipe :)

This was a perfect brine. I did add a few sprigs of rosemary to the brining bag, but that is the only change I made. Juicy and tender and flavorful breast meat. I never thought it possible. Thanks for sharing.

What did I do wrong? I used the recipe with a 10lb turkey. I followed the directions exactly. Our turkey turned out way too salty. Hence so did the gravy. I was so disappointed.

I used this combination of ingredients (but on a smaller scale) to brine boneless chicken breasts. I left them in the brine several hours, then grilled them. They were succulent! An awesome recipe that I will share with others.

I have used this brine recipe several times to prepare turkey and chicken.  It is consistently excellent.  After brining, I smoke the poultry in our Weber kettle using the indirect methos and with hickory chips. Every time I prepare a bird this way, my husband says that he would be happy to never eat any kind of meat again if he had this every day.

OMG. I will NEVER, EVER make turkey without brining it first. Every bit of the turkey comes out so juicy and delish. Make sure to rinse the turkey very well after removing it from the brine. I got lazy last time and the gravy came out too salty. I promise- this will get you compliments from everyone.

Helpful hint: I had a 24 lb. bird and could not find a container large enough to accommodate. I bought a 10 gallon plastic storage container with a lid and lined it with a new, clean Hefty trash bag. Pour the brine in the bag, put the turkey in and store in the fridge. Turn it every so often. I also added lemon and orange slices to the brine- very very moist turkey. There was no need to salt the turkey. I put pats of butter in between the skin and breast meat before roasting. Perfect turkey. I've brined for years and this was a new recipe for me. Enjoy and experiment a bit. Brining will definitely convert you into being a master Thanksgiving chef :-)

Wow, I was really reluctant to try this recipe and ruin the turkey as I like my turkey well seasoned and marinated. We had an early Thanksgiving dinner this weekend since we were not all going to be together in Thanksgiving day in a few days so I decided to make a stress free, easy early Thanksgiving day  so I gave this recipe a try. I am glad I did. I was suprised how good the turkey came out. I didn't have to baste. I just glazed it during the last hour with a pomegranate glaze, I usually put in all my turkeys and I ended up with the tastiest, perfectly browned, moist turkey I ever hoped for. The only changes I made was to use Kosher salt, added sprigs of fresh rosemary and a bit of garlic and Onion powder to the water. Thanks for sharing!

By far the best turkey I can ever remember!  About the only thing I changed was to use a lot more garlic. :)   

I had a 10.5 pound "store brand" turkey.  For roasting, I detached the skin from the breast and put butter and Mrs. Dash in between the skin and meat.  I actually stretched the skin back over the meat fairly tightly, tucked it into the neck and held it in place with tooth picks. There were a couple of small "holes" in the skin (from my skin loosening, I'm sure!)  and I patched those by tucking in some extra skin from the neck so that the breast meat was "sealed".   I sprinkled all the skin with the pickling salt, pepper and rubbed in lots of Mrs. Dash. Wish I had NOT used the extra salt - the pan drippings were too salty for gravy.

I cooked it on a wire rack in a roaster pan at 350 for about 3 hours. I started cooking with the turkey covered with foil, breast side down.  I  turned it over to breast side up half way through my cooking time. I left it uncovered at that point.  I turned the oven to convection for about the last 15 minutes.   The whole turkey sat on a serving platter covered with foil for about an hour and a half before while being transported to my Moms.  (It was Norman Rockwell beautiful before slicing!)  When I cut it, it was still hot, and wonderfully moist.  

Can't wait to try it on the smoker.  I will be picking up extra turkeys to put in the deep freezer while they are on sale for the holidays -- a first for me!

The best!  I was only able to soak for about 24hrs and it still turned out wonderful.  I also used the Deep Fried Turkey Rub for the outside.  We used a oil free turkey frier that we bought at home depot.  It was the best turkey I have ever had, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I highly recomed this brine for your turkey.

my first turkey - and it was simply marvellous! Excellend recepie, the meat came our tender, juicy and flavorfull to the last bone!  Few things to not from my experience - I did wash and pat dry the turkey after 48 hrs of brinning 12 lb bird and it was not salty to our taste (though if you prefer less salty then you could soak less or reduce 10% salt).  I oven roasted my bird and added a tsp of liquid smoke to the brine and it add a very light smokiness to meat.  To brine the bird, I used veggie drawer from my refrigetator (washed it thoroughly before and after) and it worked out well. (may not  work for a large bird)  If you decide to rub the turkey with additional flavors make sure you don't add any salt.   Great recepie!!

We use my husbands brine for every turkey--each year the word gets out--and we have more people asking how to do it.   Additions we make--4  squeezed oranges-with the juice& 2 large lemons  5 bay leaf, and whole pepper corns  and we use natural sugar-not white.---place bag in a large cooler--and just keep changing the ice a few times--also turn the bird a few times. We brine ours for 2 days. Happy cooking!!

wow, I used this turkey brine recipe for Christmas and everyone loved it. Taking some turkey is usually a chore since it's usually dry. This year everyone wanted seconds. I used the bottom drawer in my refrigerator too and started the bird at 500 degrees for the first half hour as suggested by other users. I will never cook turkey without using this recipe again... thanks!

I loved this recipe, I used a roasting pan and soaked it breast side down for 24 hours and then Wing side down for 15.  When we begain roasting I left the cover off at 425 for 25 min then turned the pan for another 25 min. placed the cover back on and and turned the temp to 325 and our 16.5 lb turkey cooked in 3 hours and it was delicous!

Used this to brine a 12# turkey for the 4th of July.  Followed directions exactly. Put "Memphis Rub" on turkey after rinsing and drying after 2 days brining. Refrigerated overnight and smoke cooked the turkey about 4 1/2 hours next morning. Made baste of butter and additional rub. This made a very moist, tender and delicious smoke cooked turkey. Will try a different rub next time. Reason for only 4 stars is because this was my first attempt at doing a turkey this way.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and maybe roasting the turkey breast instead of smoking it had something to do with it, but it was WAY too salty.  I couldn't drink enough water that night!  Sorry, I won't be using this recipe again.

I can't give it 10 stars so 5 is gonna have to do (an understatement)! I mixed this up and put in one of the really large ziploc bags (XXL) with a handle. I brined for 3 days in the fridge. When I started my smoker at 5:30 am with applewood - I let it heat up and then put the drained bird on....tic toc tic toc....It was really cold and windy outside so by 1pm I finished it off in the oven for about an hour or more to get the internal temp to the safe zone.  I let it rest for about 25 - 20 min - then I put the knife in......juices came pouring out!  It was really THAT juicy!    That turkey was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!!!! I've impressed myself and many others! Thank you for info.   the only thing different was adding fresh rosemary to the brine and a few dried herbs. You'll never eat turkey made any other way again! And this was my FIRST smoked turkey!

This was the easiest and best brine I have ever used.  It was wonderful!  Best turkey I ever made.  I took another poster's advice and followed Alton Brown's directions for roasting: 1/2 hour at 500 degrees and then 350 until done.  I also microwaved a sliced onion, a sliced apple and a cinnamon stick in a cup of water for 5 minutes then put it in the turkey cavity after I sprinkled it with ground sage.  Just the best!

Best turkey ever!  Everyone raved about how moist and flavorful it was.  Since I had a 8% solution turkey I only used 1/2 the salt and I added some liquid smoke, sage, thyme, and rosemary, I also used heaping tablespoons of garlic.  The flavors were out of this world.  I normally am a dark meat eater because it is so moist but with the brine the white meat was juicer! I will never make another turkey with out brining.

If your turkey is already injected with broth or solution, this brine will probably make it too salty.  I also used table salt, my grocer didn't have canning salt.  I only left my turkey in the brine for about ten hours and it was the perfect amount.  You could taste that salt was in it, but not too salty at all.  I also used the reynold's bag suggestion for the brine.  It doesn't add a lot of flavor, but it does make it moist.  So, I suggest adding your own herbs and butter/oil on the outside of the bird.  It does cook faster, too, so beware, it cut my time down by about an hour.

This recipe is much tastier than the other one I have tried. I add a bouillon cube to the brine. When you cook the chicken after brining, it is faster, so cook as if it is 1/2 lb smaller or so of a bird. Rinse after brining, then peel the skin up a bit to slide in fresh rosemary and pats of butter. Then use a lemon pepper on the skin. Delish!

Last Thanksgiving was the first time my dad trusted me to do the cooking. I used this recipe and it came out fantastic! Much better than I expected. The bird was still moist after 2 days of sitting in our fridge. I'm using it again this year & I'm not changing a thing :)

Wonderful, wonderful recipe!  I discovered this recipe several years ago when hosting my first Thanksgiving and have used it ever since. Because it made such moist and tender meat, we have tried it on smoked, grilled, and roasted turkeys and chicken, and they all came out beautifully. *I am a bit surprised to read the reviews that said it was too salty. I don't use a lot of salt while cooking, so I can be kind-of sensitive to it...but this recipe turned out great.  Make sure you do not substitute regular table salt if you don't have canning salt. This would definitely contribute to oversalting!

OMG... This was THE BEST turkey we have ever had!! The only change I made was adding about a qt. of apple cider to the brine and it was UNBELIVABLY moist and tender. And the flavor was out of this world. I could tell a big difference in the texture just carving it but when I put the first bite in my mouth I KNEW this was the way to go every year. Even my adult son who wont TOUCH white meat ate the breast and was amazed. My gravy which was usually used to moisten the meat was left standing this year! It was so good we bought another turkey to cook because this one produce few leftovers!What a simple way to flavor and tenderize a turkey! My fried chicken is gonna be brined too from now on if I have the time! Thank you for such a great tip for turkey! You folks HAVE to try it! You will be amazed as well!

I don't think I will ever bake a turkey with out brining it first!  This was great!!!  The turkey was so moist!  I baked it as other had suggested; Bake @ 500 for the first 1/2 hour and then the rest of the time at 300 with the breasts covered with foil.  I also cooked in in a turkey bag.  Awesome recipe!!!

I have to say I cook a great turkey to start with and was really excited to try this recipe.  I did roast it and was wondering if I should still stuff it or if it would change the flavor,  It did.  The turkey was extemely tender and juicey(perfect) but the worchester sauce in the brine changed the flavor of my dressing.  I will diffently brine again next time, but I think I will try the other recipe on this site.  The ingredients will better suit stuffing.

This is awesome.  I cut the recipe in half and used a whole chicken and soaked for 24 hours.  This is seriously the best chicken I have ever made.  My hubby smelled it roasting was excited, then when he started eating his first words were he would fight me for the leftovers.

I roasted it in chicken broth, with garlic, onion, parsley, and bay leaves. Afterwards I strained it and made gravy for mashed potatoes.  I will definitely do my Turkey in this for Thanksgiving.

This was my first time brining a turkey-WOW! I have never tasted turkey so flavorful and JUICY. It just melted in your mouth. I did use a small amount of the water hot - just to dissolve the salt, and then used almost ice water for the remainder to make sure that the solution was not warm when putting the turkey in.  otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I roasted in the oven instead of smoking, but turned out great! This is the only recipe anyone needs for preparing turkey! Thank you, SUDEMERS, for this outstanding recipe.

Turkey was moist, but we used the drippings off it to make gravy and it was really, really salty.  We researched and added a raw potato to cut the salt taste in the gravy, but it was still really salty.  We did rinse the turkey before baking.  If you want gravy, you will have to do it with something other than the juice off the meat.

The turkey was wonderful but could not use drippings for gravy because very salty. So be sure to have other means for the gravy if you want gravy.

The process is a royal pain, but I definitely LOVED the results, as did our whole family. I will say that we had to try a number of different methods of keeping the turkey cold while soaking. We finally took a very deep roasting pan that had a lid that came down over the edges of the pan. We put the turkey and brine mixture in that, covered it, set it in the basement utility sink, and poured a ton of ice over the whole thing. The basement was cool enough that the ice melted pretty slowly. We only had to add ice once. We tried a Styrofoam cooler, but the force of the water and turkey inside caused it to break! I have used this recipe for a smaller chicken (halved the amounts of brine ingredients), and I just put the whole thing in a cleaned veggie drawer lined with a roasting bag. Careful, you could make a huge mess doing this, but the results are worth it! There are many other more complicated brines out there with hard-to-find ingredients, but odds are you have everything on hand for this one, except the canning salt (which is I think about $0.75 for a large box at my grocery store).

Hands down the BEST and easiest brine recipe out there.  As others posted.......DON'T sub the salt, use kosher or canning salt only.  My 25'b turkey won't fit in the fridge during the brining, so I put it in a heavy duty trash bag in our coleman.  Add the brine, and close the bag.  Top with 2 bags of ice.   You can also play with this recipe by adding sliced oranges, you favorite herbs like rosemary, etc.  And, I've used a 'prebased' bird on several occasions, and its never too salty.  Just be sure to rinse well in cold water (especially inside the cavity) and pat dry.

Great recipe. I use a cooler to put bird in and put ice cubes in the water to keep temp down. I did the triple crown last year, brined bird, smoked with apple chips for 2 hrs, then deep fried the bird in peanut oil. Also try a bit of Old Bay in the brine..gives it a different, pleasant essence.

I did use canning salt and the turkey was moist and very tasty (and didn't take as long to cook).  However, the leftovers the next day were very salty.  I would not soak it for two days - maybe one or just overnight.  UPDATE;  Soaking it for one day was perfect!

This was my first Thanksgiving, and I have never cooked a turkey before.  I didn't even know what "brining" was until the day before Thanksgiving!  I followed the recipe, but left out the garlic and we only let it set for about 14 hours since we had decided at the last minute to try it.  It was fantastic!!  

The turkey cooked a lot faster than I had planned (10 pound turkey took 3 hours, instead of the recommended 4).

And the meat was so tender, it was just falling off the bone - no need to carve at all!!  

This was so easy to do, and the results are great - you would be silly not to do it!

THIS WAS THE BEST!!!!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and brined the turkey in a baking bag in the roasting pan in the fridge.  This made it easy to keep cold and brined.  The only thing i added was a dash of liquid smoke and it turned out tasting just like smoked turkey!!!

Wow! I was nervous about the salt issues people were talking about so I only put the turkey in the brine for 24 hours. Well it was awesome, but will put it in the brine for 48 hours next time. The turkey was so juicy and had the best flavor. I made it exactly as the recipe stated with the spices. I had a 16 pound turkey, cooked on 500 degrees for 30 minutes, then reduced heat to 325. My turkey was done in 2 HOURS! NOT kidding!!! Can't wait to make another one! So trust what everyone is saying on the time! I will never make another one that I do not use this recipe to brine Mr. Tom.

We use a brine that is one gallon water to one cup Kosher salt and one cup brown sugar.  Adding the Worcestershire sauce sounds interesting. Instead of using a bucket or container and having to take up that much space in your refrigerator, try using a small ice chest like an Igloo.  Make up as many "batches" of the brine as you need to cover the turkey, then add a bag of ice and close the lid. You can use the spout on the bottom of the ice chest to drain the water.  Pat the turkey dry and then prepare the turkey as you normally would to go into the oven, smoker or fryer.  If preparing in the oven, put the turkey breast side down.  It will keep the turkey breast moist.  If using a smoker, use a sprayer bottle and spray the meat every hour with apple juice to help keep it moist.  We also use this brine for pork loins with fantastic results.

This Thanksgiving was my first time to do the cooking for my family and i'm sure glad i used this recipe for the turkey-it was SPECTACULAR! I stuffed the turkey with 1 red apple(sliced), 1/2 onion (sliced), 1 cinnamon stick,1 cup water, 4 sprigs rosemary, and 6 leaves sage, that had been steeped in a pot for 5min, then rubbed a generous amount of olive oil on the turkey and cooked for 30min at 500 degrees, and then for the remainder(about 2.5hrs) at 350...EVERYONE loved it, including my picky 10 and 11yr old brothers and overly critical in-laws!lol

Fabulous! After 24 hours  I also used the Herb Turkey Rub recipe and wrapped by bird in bacon.  I butterflied one bird a placed it on the grill with a piece of oak via indirect heat while the other bird roasted in the stove.  Both amazing!!!

One reviewer suggested boiling the brine to bring out all the flavors. We did that and then smoked our 8 pound turkey for about three hours. BEST TURKEY EVER!

This was turkey was amazing!!!!!! It was my 1st time making a turkey and the only way I'll make a turkey. It was extremely juicy and flavorful through and through. I took some of the advice I read and put a stick of butter, garlic and celery inside the turkey before roasting. Thank you for this recipe.

Awesome! I didn't change a thing. Soaked the turkey in this brine for just under 24 hours and then grilled it (charcoal Webber, indirect method) with only a healthy slathering of olive oil and it's easily the best turkey I've ever done. Juicy and flavorful.

My husband said this was the best turkey he has had!  The turkey was moist and had a great flavor.  I did add the peel of one orange like the Pioneer Woman, and I also followed Alton Brown's cooking suggestions like others who have used this brine.  It makes for a perfect combination.  Thanks for sharing the Turkey Brine.

I have made this according to recipe and I ended up with turkey so salty it kept us up all night. What did I do?  Someone suggested that I should have rinsed it before smoking, but the recipe didn't call for that.  Help!

Amazing!! Cooked a 14 lb turkey yesterday and it came out awesome. I brined it for two days like the recipe said. When I was ready to cook it I put two sticks of butter with rosemary, and  thyme. Mixed it up and put it all over the turkey. So juicy. I will use this brine every time for turkey. Thank you so much.

Best brine we've ever used.  This year I did the brine and then rubbed under the skin with an olive oil and herb rub and my family went crazy!  Even my adult son, who rarely comments on anything, kept telling me it was the best turkey he's ever had!

This was the first time I used a brine so I would not know if it was any better than another. I was so pleased with my turkey that I will use this again. I made my own vegetable broth and it made the house smell great. I think I will soak longer than overnight next time.

This is a very good recipe. I cooked the dressing separately. Added 2 cups of vegetable stock to the pan under the meat rack, loosely filled the bird cavity with a large leek, and smoked the bird on my Weber grill using indirect heat method. Fantastic! The smokey flavor was carried into the gravy so very well.

I've used this brine 2 years in a row. Moist, delicious roasted turkey every time. The only change we made was reduce the kosher salt to 1 cup due to sodium intake reasons. My folks aren't usually a fan of Thanksgiving turkey. But this brine has changed their mind.

I used this brine recipe for this past Thanksgiving turkey.  I loved it!  This si the first time I have brined a turkey and I got nothing but compliments!  I will never serve turkey again with out bringing it! I did do something different.  I took a carton of chicken stock and simmered it with the ingredients (except for the water) for about 25 minutes.  I let that mixture come to  room temp then added it to the 2 gallons of water, then brined the turkey for about 18 hours!  I also cooked the turkey in a Showtime Rotisserie!  All I can say it YUMMY!!!!

I put this in a large rolling plastic cooler. Had a 15 lb turkey and doubled the recipe minus the black pepper (just because I forgot it). Put the turkey upside down and put bags of ice on top to keep it cool and submerged. It was pretty chilly here so I put the cooler on the front porch and rotated ice in it for the 2 days before Thanksgiving. Rinsed it inside and out on Thanksgiving day and seasoned and injected it and it was wonderful. Cooked in about 3 1/2 hours.

Delicious Turkey Breast!  Brined for 19 hours, then put in the smoker for 5 hours with charcoal and apple wood chips.  Used sea salt and much less than called for b/c not big on salty flavors...and added uncooked bacon strips under the skin and then over the skin to add additional flavor and moisture.  It was a hit!!!

This brine produced one moist and tasty roast turkey. A little bit salty and next time I think I might try a quick rinsing after it comes out of the brine.  I used the carcass and leftover meat to make the "After-Thanksgiving Turkey Soup" recipe from this site which I think is the best tasting soup I have made to date. As they say...once you have tried it once you never go back.  I get it!

Will never do a turkey in any other brine. Great with a couple of tablespoons of Slap ya Mama seasoning thrown in. I use half the recipe for an 8 pound turkey breast, put it in a turkey oven roasting bag to soak, then rinse and put it in a crock pot. Thank you for sharing my secret ingredient! I should add though, the drippings are too salty for gravy so you'll have to make that separate.

This is my first time brining a turkey.  The turkey was delicious, moist and juicy!  I had a 25 lb. fresh turkey and when baking, I added onions, celery and garlic.  The whole house smelled fabulous and Big Tom served his purpose well!  Great recipe!

I too did this for our firts turkey this past thanksgiving. It was fabulous. We also put our turkey in a turkey bag to brine. We found we couldn't fit our 19 pound turkey into the bag with 2 gallons of water. At most I was able to put about 1 1/2 gallons if you have the same issue I would reduce the salt as we found ours to be just a tad salty. Comes out picture perfect.

I used this recipe, only I boiled the first quart of water to dissolve the salt, then added the other ingredients. My husband smoked the turkey at 225 degrees for about 10 hours. It was so moist, and just fell off the bone. My Father-in-Law said it was the best turkey he ever ate.

I will never cook another turkey without doing a brine first. It made such a difference! The meat was juicy and full of flavor. I put a clean trash bag in my bottom drawer of the fridge, put the turkey in the drawer, and poured the brine over the bird until it was covered. I did have some brine left and just dumped it. I let the turkey site for almost a day and a half, and it was excellent!

Holy smokes, this was good. I cut the recipe in half because I was only doing  a turkey breast. The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 of the water for apple juice. This was BY FAR the moistest turkey breast I have ever eaten. It was a little salty for my taste, but I'm going to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt (and five stars!) because I substituted table salt for canning and may have messed up on the conversion amount. Definitely try this: You will not be disappointed.

I've been brining and roasting turkeys for awhile now but this was the first time i smoked one.  I soaked the turkey for the 2 days the recipe said and we found the turkey just a tad salty.  Next time i will cut it back to one day.  I'm going to try this brine recipe the next time i roast a turkey and see how it turns out because i think i may have found my go-to brine recipe.  YUMMY!!!!  Update: I made it again and only marinated one day.  Still too salty for us.  We have to cut down on the salt or something

Great recipe.  I liked the addition of the worchestire sauce. Also the using the roasting bag to hold the turkey was excellent.  I like to start my turkey at 400 for 30-40 minutes to brown the breast to hold juices in, then turn oven down to 350 for the remainder.  Either cover the breast with foil (making the foil cover before putting in oven) or turn the turkey over.  I tried both and prefer to flip the turkey if not too big.

This brine produced such a flavorful and moist turkey!  I only adjusted the serving size (to 9 since I was brining a 12 lb. turkey) and substituted table salt for the canning salt.  (Since table salt is more compact than canning/kosher salt, I multiplied the amount of canning salt the recipe called for by 2/3, which is the conversion recommended on several cooking sites.) Due to the fact that the turkey roasted at 450°F, my 12-pounder was ready in about 1 hour and 10 minutes!  (Note: cooking at such a high temperature is not recommended for turkeys larger than 16 lbs.)  This brine, coupled with the high-temperature cooking method, resulted in the best turkey I have ever made.  My family and I have never enjoyed turkey so much!

After 24 hours soaking in this brine, the turkey meat literally was falling off the bone. Our turkey was super moist and so good! We'll definitely be using this recipe again and again.

This is an easy brine recipe that did a wonderful job on my Thanksgiving turkey.  I made a few variations: I added two lemons and two oranges that I cut and lightly squeezed before adding to the brine.  I also added a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and sage.  To make this simple to store, I placed a large trash bag inside a 5-gallon bucket and then added the turkey and brine.

Great turkey this Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about how moist and flavorful it was. I used this brine recipe and let it soak about 18 hrs. After rinsing I covered the skin with melted butter and stuffed the cavity with onions, celery, sage and thyme. Poured some white wine in the pan. I roasted in my convection oven at 325 for 10 minutes per pound, covering the breast with foil once it was browned. The turkey was perfect and the gravy was very flavorful as well.

Wonderful!  I'd never brined a turkey before, and felt rather silly putting a turkey in a garbage bag in the fruit drawer of my fridge, but the results were AMAZING.  Highly recommended.  Make sure you can sneak a piece of the turkey skin when it's cooked - the brine gave it an incredible flavor!

I'm with everyone else but I'll be repetitive - the juiciest, best tasting turkey we have ever eaten.  I used another's idea and used my fridge veggie crisper bin and used it to brine my turkey in.  It roasted up beautiful and was really golden brown and tasty.  The best!

I used this with a whole chicken.  I brined it for 2 days, putting it in the brine frozen.  I was going to rub it with seasonings before I baked it, but ended up not having time and there was no need!  Very flavorful and juisy.  Delicious!!!  Everyone loved it - and I have 4 kids, hard to please everyone in a family of 6!!!

This a fantastic way to ensure tender juicy turkey.  I love the idea of adding spices and Worcestershire sauce and onions. I have been brining my turkeys for years and would never make it any other way. I am going to try adding the spices and onions when I brine this year's turkey tonight.  I use a gallon of cheap orange juice and definitely kosher salt. I put mine in a big garbage bag inside a large corn pot.  The pot was reactive and the garbage bag prevents problems and makes for easy clean up! Be sure to rinse well before roasting.

Wonderful.  Just wonderful.  Try it with pork, too.  Apple cider or juice works well, also.  We even decrease the amounts to accommodate 1 gallon of water and do our chickens and pork loin this way.  Wonderful for the grill.  It's much harder to dry the meat out when it's been brine'd.  And the juice you will get for gravy is wonderful.

Hubby and I smoked a turkey for our 4th of July cookout/anniversary party (yes, we married on the 4th of July).  Who says turkey is just for Thanksgiving.  This brine added a nice flavor and kept the turkey juicy.  Hubby also kept spritzing the turkey with apple juice to keep it moist and the combination resulted in one of the best turkeys I ever had.

Super-simple to make up and super-delicious! After cooking turkeys for nearly 30 years this is the first time I have brined a turkey. I made up the brine in about a half-gallon of water and brought it to a boil so all the ingredients would go into solution. After everything was dissolved I added cold water to bring the total volume to 2 gal. I also used Reynolds cooking bags to hold the brine. The turkey breasts were in the brine for about 24 hrs. We then cooked them with apple wood on our smoker.  It was the best turkey we have ever made.

I used this for our neighborhood Thanksgiving celebration. We have two chefs who live on our street and they both told me this was the BEST turkey they had ever had...huge compliment. My family thought it was absolutely amazing, as well. I did one "plain" turkey and one with a seasoning rub...they were both good, but I discovered with this recipe there was no need for the extra step of the seasoning rub.

It was a big hit at our house.  Even my 20 year old daughter who doesn't like turkey said it was good. My 75 year old mom said it was one of the best turkeys ever (and she's had a few turkeys!). The turkey was a 23 lb one (NOT pre brined in any way), soaked in a big plastic bag inside my huge stock pot for about 36 hours  then washed in cold water and set in an icy water bath for about 15 minutes before cooking. Previous reviewers were right about the gravy from the drippings though - I like salty gravy so I thought it would be o.k. - but I was wrong - way too salty.  Oh well, that gravy will be great in the soup!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this brine Thanksgiving 2009 and it was Out of this World it was the best turkey I ever made and I've made my share of turkeys. I was a little concern that the turkey wasn't going to be seasoned enough so I added light seasonings. My family loved it and I will be using it again this year.

I've made quite a few brines in my day, and this one was by far the easiest, yet it packed just as much flavor.  The turkey was juicy and delicious!  I used only one cup of kosher salt and it was definitely salty enough.  I did add the juice and zest of a lemon, but don't think it really needed it.

This was an easy recipe that provided the juiciest turkey breast that I have ever eaten. I had never brined before and thought it was time to step in to that arena and give it a try. The recipe was easy to follow and I made it "as is". Having never brined before I was unsure what to expect in the way of flavor recieved from a brine and I guess I am still unsure. Although this turkey was as moist as they get, it tasted like plain turkey (which was good) but no other flavors came through. Now since I had never tried this maybe I should not expect flavoring from the brine only moisture. I would try this again but I would add herbs etc. during the baking process.

My wife is not a big turkey fan, she says it is to bland. So I went looking for away to make it better and this is the one I used. Let me tell you the turkey was a HUGE hit, my wife loved it. Was so juicy and full of flavor she actually went back for 2nd's. I used the one sugestion shannonlrusso and put it in a roasting bag to soak it in. Work great. Will definetly be making this again.

This was my first time cooking a whole turkey - and my first time using a brine.  I had a 22lb turkey and I brined it in my old water cooler that didn't have a lid. kept it in my spare fridge for 24 hours. Patted it dry and rubbed with butter. When the bird first started cooking I could smell Worcestershire - very strong - and I panicked thinking I was going to have a turkey that tasted like Worcestershire. I kept the turkey uncovered for the first half of the cooking time until the skin was nice and brown then tented with foil. Took 4 hours at 325. Absolutely the best turkey I have ever eaten. Nice and moist with a lot of flavor. Don't hesitate to try this recipe - it's a keeper.  After I already had it in the brine someone told me I should not have brined because my turkey was already injected with some sort of solution. I was told I was going to have a salt lick. But it turned out great... Not salty at all.

I have smoked two turkeys using this brine and they were the best birds I have ever cooked. I used a 5gal. bucket for brining and put ice in it because it wouldn't fit in frig. Covered top with lid and added more ice as needed.

We made this for Thanksgiving a couple of years ago and it turned out great.  I was even competing against a cajun-injected fried turkey.  It turned out very moist and not too salty at all.  The only problem I have is the logistics of brining a turkey.  I tried the roasting bag method as someone suggested.  The bag was overflowing out of the roasting pan so I was nervous for the whole 24 hours it was in the fridge.  Then when I went to drain it, disaster struck and I had brine all over my floor.  Yes--you may chuckle!  I'm sure this was directly related to my clumsiness, but there has to be a better way.  I'm thinking it has something to with an extra fridge!

I was a little nervous about using a brine just because I nor anyone in my family had ever tried a brine.  Let me tell you, I will never make a turkey again without using a brine!!!  Wow, this turkey was phenomenal!  I let it sit in the brine in a clean bucket in the garage (the temp was in the 30's here) for 36 hours.  The white meat on the turkey was so incredibly moist and flavorful I can't even explain how good it was.  It turned out better than I ever imagined!  I used Alton Brown's method of cooking (cook at 500 for the first 30 minutes and then turn down to 350 for the rest of the time).  I will even try using this brine for roasted chicken as well.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe, I honestly can't believe more people don't do turkeys this way.  It really isn't hard at all.

This was my first time brining a turkey and it turned out wonderfully.  Got compliments from everyone at Thanksgiving dinner.  Even my boyfreind who doesn't usually like the breast meat thought it was great.  Turned out very moist and flavorful.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used Alton Brown's cooking method (rinse and dry the turkey, rub the inside with rosemary and sage, coat the outside of the bird with canola oil and put the turkey in at 500 for the first thirty minutes, then cover the breast with a double layer of foil and turn oven to 350).  Did not baste at all. The bird was a beautiful golden brown when finished.  I used an 8 gallon trash can with lid for the brine, left it in the garage for 1 1/2 days before cooking.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

What a wonderful method for creating the most flavorful, moist meat I have ever tasted.  I tested this brine on a whole 5 lb chicken a few days ago, adjusting the recipe of course, and brined for 8 hours.  Best chicken I ever roasted! 
 My turkey was just as good!  I will always brine from now on!  Note: I took out the middle shelf of my refrigerator to accomadate the bucket that I brined the turkey in, worked great!

I used this for a twenty two pounder and as I do a lot of grilling/smoking I find using a five gallon bucket with a thirteen gallon trash bag for a liner work really good for brining. Just put your meat in the bag, add the brine/marinade and close the bag around it all purging the air and tie it shut. In cool weather you can just leave it outdoors in a shady spot. I really like this brine ecipe.

First time to use this brine yesterday, IT IS FANTASTIC, I did not have rosemary and sage, so I used two pieces of anise and a huge knob of ginger - I used Alton Brown's way of roasting, 500F for 1st half hour, then cover breast with double foil and turn down to 300F for remainder of time - THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO BRINE AND ROAST, I WILL BE DOING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Thanks to TAYLORSMUMMY who said in her review she used Alton's way of roasting - my turkey was so good looking, almost did not want to cut into it.  THE BEST TURKEY EVER!

I tried this for the first time this Thanksgiving!! I paired it with a recipe that calls for a cup of butter melted then add a bottle of cooking sherry.  Soak cheese cloth in the mix and put it over the turkey then pour remaining over it, seal tightly then bake.  IT WAS FABULOUS!!

I will never cook my turkey anyother way.  Awsome!  I didn't want the turkey to taste like too much apple, so I held in liquid for 12 hrs. and held on paper towles for 6 hrs.  The turkey breast was so moist and the turkey had a hint of apple flavor.  Enjoy.

Lots of compliments on my turkey this year!  I used 2/3 c. brown sugar and one quart of veg. stock in place of the water.  I only brined for 12 hours, will try it for longer next year.  I roasted in the oven and it was fabulous!

The only way to cook a turkey. The white meat is so juicy that I even like eating it. We used an ice cooler because our turkey was 18lbs. We just checked it a couple times a day to make sure there was still ice in the cooler to keep the turkey cold. We brined it for 2 days

Used turkey breasts instead of whole turkey.  Everyone raved about how moist the turkey was.  I was doubtful about the amount of garlic.  But this brine is perfect.

This brine was wonderful. I scaled down to 3 servings as I was only brining 4 chicken breasts (bone in). It was absolutely perfect. We usually season our chicken with a salt based seasoning mix. If I use it next time I would cut the salt a bit. You don't need any additional seasoning with this brine. It was moist and wonderfully flavored. I was very impressed. We have tried countless methods for moist chicken breasts and by far this was the easiest. Thak you for a great brine. We, a family of 6 are very grateful.

I halved the recipe and prepared with 2 chickens.  One we put on the smoker the other we put in the oven.  The chicken was so moist and delicious both ways.  I've never brined anything before, but now I am eager to try some other brine recipes on this site.  Thanks!

Even though this was a pain in the butt to pull off, I would do it again.  I tried the garbage bag in a cooler approach and it was very messy.  I don't think I added enough salt, turkey was not as moist inside as I expected it to be.  Next time I would inject something like italian dressing or butter/garlic, as well.

Canning salt and Kosher salt are two VERY different things.  Canning salt is very finely ground.  Kosher salt is large flakes.  By a given volume (eg. 1 cup) the canning salt is much denser.  Therefore, a cup of canning salt will have more weight and sodium content.  Given the recipe calls for 2 gallons of water, Kosher salt should be used.  Canning salt will be too salty.

This is my go to recipe every time I cook a turkey! Like many others, here are the changes I made. 

After brining, I rinse, pat dry. Then I take a flat and long mixing spoon and I seperate the skin from the meat, but DON'T remove it feom the bird! You just want the slin to be loose. Try not to tear it.  Then rub the skin with any seasoning you want but be sure to add a bood amount of baking powder to it. You want the skin to be dry after applying the rub. Let it sit in fridge for at least 24 hours uncovered. This will dry skin out more. Roast in pan upside down for 2/3 of the cooking time. Basting with whatever you want occasionally to keep moist. Flip bird over and finish roasting. Skin should brown and be amazingly crispy while meat is super moist. 4 years in a row of success for me. Good luck!

Please make sure that whatever you are using is FOOD GRADE!  Coolers are made to hold ice and insulate: they were never meant to come into actual contact with food.  Ditto for buckets and refrigerator storage drawers and more. Manufacturers are required to use a higher grade of plastic--and to AVOID using certain chemicals--when what they are making is expected to come into contact with food. Long exposure time, the variable temperatures and the acidic nature of some of the ingredients all are potential contributors to leaching of chemicals from the vessel to the turkey.  Hey, protect your beautiful life and your beautiful health.  Make sure you have a food safe vessel and BRINE ON!

This was the first time I have brined a turkey. I defrosted the turkey for 3 days and brined for 2 days as stated in another review.  The only thing I did differently was using Kosher salt instead of canning salt(I couldn't find any). I baked an 11.28Lb turkey for about 3 1/2 hours at 350 degrees and it came out PERFECT!!! The popper from in the turkey actually popped at about 3 hours 10 minutes.  I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe. The whole family raved about how juice this turkey was. This will definitely be my go to recipe whenever we have turkey!!!

Used this recipe twice for chicken. The first time, I let the bird soak for 4 hours (for a chicken, a large ziplock freezer bag is a perfect fit and allows for full brine coverage). That bird was tasty enough we had a second the same week. For the second bird, I soaked it in the brine for 24 hours and it was incredible! I added  potatoes cut in halves and sliced carrots under the roast as it baked. what a fabulous meal! I agree with previous posts, you must rinse the bird well after brining (don't worry, if you soaked it long enough, the bird has all the flavour it needs).

Fantastic!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but I put it in an oven turkey bag placed in a disposable foil turkey pan.  After removing, I used the "Turkey In a Smoker" recipe on this same website.  I have never made turkey on thanksgiving before but the family insists I make it just the same way every year from now on.  Great Brine!!

Perfect. Brined 2 turkeys in a double bagged garbage bag placed in a large cooler of ice. Brined for about 22 hours. Turned turkeys once and kept cooler filled with ice. Result: The most perfectly moist smoked turkeys you could ever ask for! Family ranted and raved about how good the turkey was this Thanksgiving.

Awesome!!!  Everybody loved the turkey. The brine made the turkey super moist and tasty. I used a 20# turkey and brined for two days. Some seasoned softened butter on top and under the skin then in the oven for 30 minutes at 500 deg. Reduced temp to 325 deg and covered with foil. Cooked for additional 4 hrs basting every hour. Removed from the oven and let rest covered for 45 minutes. The rest is history!!! I actually have a 20# bird brining right now that I will be putting in the smoker in the morning. Enjoy this one...it's a winner!

Absolutely the best turkey I've ever made due to the brine.  I'll never roast any other way now. Thanks.

I'm not a big fan of turkey, but this recipe has changed my mind completely!  An easy and wonderful recipe that adds favor and tenderness.  I'm so sold on this that turkey will be cooked more than just once a year with this recipe.  You will not be disappointed.

Have used this brine twice, it's perfect!  let the turkey brine for about 20 hrs each time, then cooked it on our Traeger with the smoked turkey recipe on this site, it was truly the best!

I've tried other brine recipes but decided to try this one because it was less complex and more economical. The only changes I made was using apple juice in place of some of the water  (maybe about 4-6 cups). After brining, I dried the bird,  mixed 2 stick of butter with dried parsley, savory, rosemary and sage and rubbed it under the skin and put the remaining on top of the breast. I cooked the bird in a foil pan on my Big Green Egg at 325. Full load of lump with some nice big chunks of mesquite, cooked indirect using a plate setter and a pizza stone.  I loosely drapped the bird with foil about an hour into the cooking process to control browning. Baste the bird ever so often & cooked until the breast reached 190. Beautifully browned, tender and tasted great!

Oh my gosh! This is so yummy. It does change the taste of turkey, so if you are serving to people that like the 'turkey' flavor, this recipe is not for you. But if you want some of the best tasting, most tender meat ever, this is for you! I placed turkey(13 pounds) and brine ingredients in a large heavy duty turkey bag; then placed it in a 5 gallon bucket and then placed ice all around it and on top. We live in Colorado, so left bucket in the garage and replaced ice whenever it needed it. This was the best tasting turkey we have ever had.

yea yea yea, I could make this recipe as is but I firmly believe in as using recipes as a basis. With that said, I used this recipe + directions by alton brown and substituted half of the water for vegetable/chicken/turkey stock and decreased the salt to 1 cup because our turkey was 9lbs. I used several whole garlic cloves that I smashed and sprinkled some all spice in the pot. I took all the ingredients in my big pot and (minus the very cold water) and shimmered them on the stove top to make sure they were completely dissolved. Then I cooled the liquid, then added the water and submerged the turkey. I only brined overnight (approximately 16 hours). Then I created a dry rub of minced garlic+ sage+ sazon+ smokey sweet red pepper seasoning. I glazed with melted butter halfway through. But the brine is was makes this dish Deliciously moist !

I used this recipe for our Thanksgiving Turkey and EVERYONE loved it!  My first time making a turkey and I found it very easy.  I followed the recipe but boiled a pot of water with all ingredients after I read that the salt sat at the bottom for some people.  I was only able to have it soak for 12 hours but it was still very delicious!  Next year I will use the same recipe but try to marinate it for the entire 2 days!

Ok, I'm hooked and convinced. I tried this for Thanksgiving and my turkey was delicious!!!! It was so moist and juicy. My husband said this is definitely a winner and it was soooo easy!! My brother in law, a former cook, raved about how good it was. I admit, I was a bit of a chicken and only used 1 1/4 cup of the Kosher salt because I was worreied it might be salty. It was perfect and I could tell that the extra 1/4 C of salt would have been just fine. I will be brining my turkey for Christmas too! Thanks for such an awesome recipe.

Wonderful, garlic flavored brine- but not too much garlic.  The ingredients were so simple but added more flavor than a salt-only brine. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy to make.  We prepared two turkeys- one roasted and the other deep-fried (both brined) and they were both moist and delicious.  This is the brine that we will use every year. Thank you!!!

Yum! I'm suffering from turkey induced drowsiness right now because I ate so much of the turkey that I brined. The bird was a hit at dinner- everyone was used to dry turkey but this brine combined with a 4+ hour barbeque/smoke hit the spot!!!

Absolutely phenomenal!  This was my first ever turkey last thanksgiving and it was a major hit.  It was the first turkey I can ever remember that didn't make it to later being turned into turkey sandwiches.  I was very nervous about cooking my first turkey with my family being full of exceptional cooks so the competition is high.  I have never been a fan of white meat but this came out so juicy and full of flavor that it didn't require being smothered in gravy.  The white meat was the first to run out!  I used a roaster oven for the whole process from brining to cooking.  Next year I will try this with smoker.

This was my first time using the brine technique.  My husband and I thought it was on the salty side. Although I did use it only on a turkey breast, I wonder if it would make a difference using the whole bird. I baked the turkey breast in a roasting bag, it came out REALLY moist, just too salty.

I've never heard of brining before until I saw it on the Food Network.  I tried this brine recipe and my mom who generally doesn't hand out compliments freely, kept repeating over and over how moist and tasty my chicken was.

i have some suggestion to those of you who would like to make this recipe over the top...once i was ready to pull the turkey out of the brine, i placed it in the roasting pan and rubbed butter all over the bird, i also injected the bird with butter and garlic before i put it in the brine....once  the bird was covered in butter i threw it in the oven at 500 degrees for 30mins... this made the outside of the turkey perfectly golden brown. once the half hour was up i covered the bird with foil and reduced the heat to 350 til it was done. amazing recipe....

This made an extremely moist turkey and great gravy.  It is VERY important that you use SEA SALT or KOSHER SALT, NOT TABLE SALT, otherwise your turkey will be inedible. That was probably the issue with some of the reviewers below,that said it was way too salty. I prefer sea salt in this recipe myself.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at brining a turkey. I made a 20-lb. Butterball, and it turned out very tasty -- not the "out of this world," best-I-ever-tasted flavor I had hoped for, but very, very good. I did use a cooking bag (because I like how it shortens the cooking time), and I think the bird might have been a little better if I'd just cooked it on a rack with foil tenting. But all in all, very moist and flavorful, and I will use it again in the future.

Decided to try this for my Thanksgiving turkey breast. I had to cut this in half to better suit my meager needs, but it worked out really well. Brining really did make a difference, and we had the juiciest turkey breast ever. I've used this also for chicken since then with the same juicy results.

Wow!  I have never had such juicy and moist turkey.  My husband cut into the side to see if it was finished and juice gushed out!  We did have to cook it a bit longer (after brining for 2.5 days), but everyone agreed that it was the best turkey they had ever had.

I was so excited to try this recipe for Thanksgiving and Argh; it was WAY TO SALTY for me!  My husband said he liked it, but I could tell that he was just trying to make me feel good.  Next time, I will cut the salt way......downnnn..!  Other then that, it was very juicy.

This brine resulted in the best, most flavorful, juiciest turkey we have ever made.  My husband is a big turkey eater(orders it in restaurants) and said this was the best turkey he's ever had.  I would have to agree.  I'm a white meat eater and even the white meat was moist and juicy.

I brined it for almost 48 hours in the fridge.  I mixed the brine in one of the XL ziploc bags, etc.....put two plastic kitchen garbage bags over that and kept it in my fridge.

I roasted it per Alton Brown's method (had seen it on Good Eats and wanted to try his technique).  Turned out golden brown on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.

I have never made a turkey before and I tried this soaking method. 
Everyone was amazed at how moist it was. I even had people ask for my recipe.
I used a small cooler. I only had to add ice once. It stayed very cold for two days.

Made the Turkey super moist, not salty, but not as flavorful as I thought. Did use an oven bag and marinated for a full 24 hours. I also did not have brown sugar so I used white table sugar which account for the lack of flavor. I will use again and next time do for 24 hours. I can definatley notice the difference with and without the brine. The meat was like butter silky and not dry. Being a total white meat fan this is important.

While I agree that this made for a very moist turkey, I'm amazed that no one (other than myself and "MamaW") had the issue with the turkey and especially the gravy being too salty.  I did use regular salt, as opposed to the "canning salt" called for in the recipe.  I'm not sure if that would make any difference or not.  I'd make this again, but I'd definitely cut way down on the salt!!

I really had no idea that brining would make such a huge difference! My husband could not stop talking about how incredibly moist the turkey was. He is a self-proclaimed white meat hater and he devoured all the leftovers within 2 days! I will never make another turkey without brining!

Excellent! This was my first time brining and I was very pleased with the results- a very juicy bird!! My turkey was 22 lbs so I adjusted the recipe a little bit. Also, my turkey was already pre-injected with broth and stuff, so I lowered the salt in the brine to about half a cup so as not to make the turkey too salty. Thank you!

This was easy and the turkey turned out great!  I made a single, bone-in, turkey breast so I scaled the recipe down a good bit.  I used regular salt as that was all I had.  I brined it in a 'turkey' oven bag and placed that in a 9x13 dish.  I turned the breast over 2-3 times in the 2 days it was in the brine.  I cooked the turkey in another bag in the oven.  It was very juicy and tasty!  I would brine a turkey again!

Awesome
I did this yesterday with a 13lb turkey.  Didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used nearly 1/4 cup soy sauce and topped it off with some liquid smoke to make 1/4 cup.  Smoked it in the smoker for almos 12 hours (180 degree inner thigh temp)  DELISH

Super good, easy and quick brine for a moist and delicious turkey!  We were  short on time, so we only marinated approximately 12 hours and holy smokes what a delicious turkey.  We cooked in our new Big Easy by Char Broil and the skin was also crispy - YUM!

I have been brining my turkey with this recipe for the past 7 years. I also use the Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way recipe after I brine.  Everyone raves about my moist and flavorful the turkey is.

Fantastic! First thanksgiving turkey was a hit...I used this with a 23 lb fresh butterball turkey that had 4% mixture of salt and spices. I was nervous it would be too salty but it was spectacular! I also used the Alton Brown method...started at 500 for 30 mins, then at 350 but it started to cook fast so I lowered to temp to 300 a little over halfway through

I smoked probably 10+ turkeys with this brine and I always to forget to write a review on this fine recipe. Followed directions and smoked for 16 hrs to perfection. Used Hickory, Mesquite, or Apple are awesome woods to use. Indeed, OUT OF THIS WORLD.

I've used this brine several times and it's never failed me!  Rather then buying a bucket I purchase the Ziploc extra large bags. they are plenty big enough for a large turkey and when you're done with the brine you can throw away the entire bag with the brine still in it and you don't have to worry about storing a bucket later

Thanksgiving last year (2015). This brine  made a .49 ¢/lb no name brand turkey  the best,  moistest, most flavorful we ever had. Back to get the recipe and making  it again. Note: I marinated in the brine for 24 hours with excellent results. A 16 lb turkey fit perfectly in my 21 quart  stainless steel stock pot.

I used kosher salt. My turkey was huge, it stuck out of a 5 gallon bucket.  I made the brine put the frozen turkey in and stuck it in the fridge to brine and thaw at the same time. It was amazing, everyone loved it!

Not just for turkey! About twice a year hubby & I brine turkey, chicken, game hen, duck, etc. During the brine we get our rubs, marinades & sauces together. Then off to the grill, smoker, fryer or oven they go. Once done they get prepped for use in different dishes, bbq, mexican, italian, salads, yada yada. Vac sealed & frozen makes dinner time faster & easier.

I used this brine for the first time and IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I let the turkey sit for about 24 hours in the brine, then I smoked it using an Orion Smoker, with apple vinegar in the drip plan and Jack Daniels wood chips.  This was restaurant quality.

Best ever!  Used this to marinate two wild Turkeys. Soaked 24 hours before smoking them on the grill. I did not use surgar. I did add a cup of Apple Cider vinegar and  a couple of Tablespoons of ground sage. I also doubled the amount of fresh garlic. The flavor and moisture in the turkeys were incredible!

We've used this the last several Thanksgiving's, however, I sub apple juice for the water and put it into a 5 gallon bucket with the turkey and brine in a roasting bag. We don't smoke it, but cook it using the spatchcocking method.

This turkey was a success at one of my early thanksgiving dinner parties. Everyone raved about how juicy the turkey was and it was the best they have eaten. I followed the directions with the brine. Then before smoking the turkey, I injected 1 stick of butter,  1 cup of chicken broth, 1 Tablespoon of graduated garlic, 1 Tablespoon of hot sauce and 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning.  Lots of favor and I will use this recipe on every turkey I cook. 5 stars!!!!

Actually, I was shocked. I received an old turkey, frozen for months from a friend of mine who was going to use it for crab bait (note it was still fine for human consumption ??). I saw this recipe and was a little skeptical. Followed the recipe and brined it for two days... smoked for 6 hours, and let it rest under tented foil for an hour. Crazy thing came out juicier then ever and I'll  never prepare turkey another way again!

By far the easiest brine ever. Uses ingredients you already have in your kitchen and no cooking the brine. This has become the go to brine when baking a turkey.

I've always been very good at making turkey, but my skills truly reached superstar-level when I tried this brine.  Nobody can shut up about it.  People beg me to cook turkeys constantly now.  I'll never use a different method again!

I brined my turkey last year for the first time with this recipe, and I can not believe the difference it made - juicy, tender & savory.  I used a clean cooler to do it in and stored it in my garage (Mass. - cold this time of year)I added apple juice (about 1/2 gal) with cut up apples, a little bit of nutmeg, allspice & cinnamon. I put it in on Tuesday night and let it sit till Thurs. morning.  So  yummy definitely worth the time & little effort. GREAT RECIPE - Thanks

We started brining turkeys a few years ago.  Would never go back to any other method.  This recipe has the turkey just falling apart so it might not be for everyone but it sure is for us!

Hands down the best turkey brine ever!!!  This is my go to brine and I get a ton of compliments on the flavor and how juicey the turkey is every time.  I even used this brine when I deep fried my turkey a couple of months ago and it turned out awesome.  When I fried the turkey it really intensified all the flavors that this brine incorporates.

This was my first time brining meat.  I brined a turkey breast and it came out moist with a nice flavor.  I put it in a stock pot and left outside overnight since it was cold and couldn't fit into the fridge. I also put the stock pot in a trash bag and tied it tight, since I was a bit paranoid about birds finding my turkey. When my dad ate some the next day, he commented on how delicious it was and he always brines his turkeys. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my first ever post but have read many. We made this brine exactly as described and can add that make sure you have a large enough container to hold the two gallons because it's worth it. We brined our 14 pound bird for 36 hours and then rinsed it thoroughly as other posters have indicated for the full two minutes to avoid saltiness.  We then applied a wet rub. We decided to put it on the BBQ as one poster had said.  We never had to baste, not once.  Our family said it was the best bird they have ever eaten.  I have sent this brine recipe to all of them and we will never go back to putting our bird in the oven and just basting every twenty minutes again.  I'm writing this as I am eating a piece of cold leftover turkey and it's still moist!

I brined a turkey breast for two days and it was awesome!  I've never had such juicy white meat before!  I've also used the brine for chicken with great success.  Two things to remember:  use only canning or kosher salt.  Table salt is too dense.  Rinse your bird very, very well after removing from the brine.

I only used 1 cup of canning salt, and I also had a salty turkey! It was very juicy and tender, but I rinsed it very, very well and didn't add anything with salt to it. The meat and the gravy I made with the drippings was a little too salty. Next time I'll use only 1/2 cup of salt.

Out of this World is absolutely the best description ! I used this recipe with the Slow cooker turkey breast recipe from this site and the combination was the best turkey anyone had ever tasted. Don't forget to rinse the brine off and pat the turkey dry before your cooking method. When space is an issue, try using a beverage cooler.

I made my very first Turkey yesterday for Thanksgiving and I have to say, this brine made it the best turkey I have ever had in my life! I was extremely anxious wondering how it was going to turn out but it was so tender, juicy and flavorful...even the white meat. I brined it in the bottom drawer of my refrigerator and it work perfectly with my 19lbs turkey. I received so many compliments and apparently everyone is coming back to my house next year, invited or not lol. Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this recipe!

Best brine I've used.  Soaked for 2 days, used Tastefully Simple's GArlic Garlic, with kosher salt.  Seriously the best turkey I've ever cooked.  Juicy and tender.  Took turkey out at 160 and let it rest for 30 min.  Couldn't keep my mom away from the turkey plate.

started turkey in brine the tuesday night before t-day.  wed. night removed turkey from brine, dried with paper towels, and let sit (uncovered) to dry out.  took out turkey wed. morning, used butter rosemary oliveoil mixture and coated skin and under skin.  put in oven (covered with water/bouilliion) at the bottom of the pan) at 500 degrees for 30 minutes, then reduced to 325 for 2.5 hours then for remaining 45 minutes cooked uncovered at 400.  YUM.  the meat was tender - it fell of the bird practically.  AWESOME.

This is the second time I've made this brine. I used sea salt b/c i couldn't find canning salt.  I started soaking the top part (breast side down) of the turkey in the roasting pan and 14 hours later I flipped it over. Because I cooked an organic turkey I took out the bird at 165 let it sit for 30 minutes and it turned out absolutely perfectly!

This was my first time being in charge of Thanksgiving - I was pretty nervous about the turkey.  When my mother (the best cook in the world was carving it she said, "My GOD! this is the juiciest turkey I've ever seen."  This brine is so so so good!  I'd put it on cereal if I could!

This Thanksgiving was my first time baking a turkey. I decided to brine it, and I am so glad I did. This turkey was indeed out of this world!!! Thank you so much for this recipe, Sudemers. I just couldn't get enough of this turkey. I did make a few changes. I was afraid it would be too salty, so I diluted the salt by cutting it in half and adding more water. I definitely recommend this!!!

I was very impressed with this brine! I made an 11lb turkey and used a 5 gallon bucket that I removed a shelf in my refrigerator for. Followed the recipie as written (including the 2-day brine) except I used 1/2 cup less salt.   It was the juiciest white-meat we'd ever had, and the turkey fell apart beautifully. Didn't add a ton of flavor, but was happy to cook such juicy bird!

I normally use Alton Brown's recipe for turkey brine but it is so complex.  This did not produce a turkey that was full of flavor but for a simple recipe it produced a moist turkey!

Have used this multiple times on smoked turkey and it always comes out phenomenal.  Just wondering if I can use it for cut chicken pieces I'm smoking this weekend.  Has anyone else tried it on chicken pieces?

I used this brine for a smoked turkey that I smoke with applewood and hickory which were soaked in apple juice for a day. I followed this recipe to the tee, and all I can say is WOW. This was the most tender and juicy turkey I have ever had the pleasure to consume. We traditionally have a roasted turkey that is notoriously dry and is always smothered with cranberry sauce. My family raved about how good the turkey was and it was all gone in less than an hour. The only downside is that now I have to make this every year! Thank you for this amazing recipe and I highly recommend that anybody who wishes to take their turkey up a notch follow this recipe to the tee.

This is an awesome way to fix Turkey.  I received rave reviews from friends and family.  I was very skeptical at first and concerned how it would taste and it was fabulous and very juicy.  Enjoy!!!

Wow!  I am not a turkey breast lovin' girl.  Any white meat I have ever eaten has been dry.  But this time my husband mentioned using a brine before smoking this year's turkey.  WOW!  I was amazed.  This recipe couple with his superior smoking skills made this turkey incredible.  Can't wait to try it on chicken! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used this recipe this Thanksgiving.  It was the best brine I have ever tried.  The bird was so moist yet it did not take anything away from the turkey flavor.  Since I did not have room in my refrigerator for a 20+ pound turkey I put it in a cooler and poured the brine over ice to keep it cold.  I only soaked it for 24 hours. A real keeper.

On my first time EVER cooking a turkey, I used this method and it turned out amazing. I got so many compliments on the turkey, I'm definitely always making turkey this way on future Thanksgivings. The only thing I changed was the amount of salt because I didn't want it to turn out too salty and I wasn't sure if canning salt was the same thing as regular morton salt. Morton salt tends to be saltier than other salts I use, so i only used 3/4 cup of it. Still turned out amazing.

Awesome! My first turkey and my first turkey brine.  I decided to brine last minute and didn't want to head back to the grocery store again so I only used 3/4 cup of table salt instead of the canning salt. I brined it for about 12 hours, rinsed well, and used "Homestyle Turkey, the Michigander Way" from this webiste.  The turkey breast was so moist that I might make this again for Christmas!

Excellent brine, made it as described only I added 1/4 cup of honey.  Note:  I have used other simple brines (salt and sugar and water), and this one is much more flavorful. Although, this recipe leaves out details of whether to rinse the turkey before roasting... since most other brining recipes call for it, I usually rinse the bird well inside and out, I imagine this might be why mine wasn't quite as salty as some other reviews have claimed?

In response to several less than perfect ratings, a good rule of thumb is to cut salt amount in half if using regular table salt to substitute for Kosher Salt.  Kosher Salt is much less "salty" than regular salt.  DO NOT use iodized salt for brining.  Delicious recipe. Thank you.

We used this recipe last thanksgiving and it was phenomenal!  We'll always use this recipe, even our 3 day old leftovers were moist and tasty.  Thanks for the hint of dissolving the salt in a sauce pan w/ hot water first and then adding cold water to make 2 gallons.  It works much better that way. Because our Fridge was full of the rest of the thanksgiving dinner, we used a 5 gallon Reynolds ziplock bag, added the bird and then put it in our cooler in the unheated garage for 2 days.  If you live in a warm climate, just add ice to the cooler and you'll be fine.

This is the best brine for doing a turkey.  I have used it for several years now and would not change a thing.  Makes the turkey moist and the best my family has ever eaten.  They all love it.

I had unexpected company for Easter so the night before they arrived I ran out and found a fresh grain fed 13 lb turkey and wanted to do something special.    I follow the recipe exactly but I only had 15 hour before I had to put it in my convection oven.  It was terrific.  The best turkey any of us have ever had and I previously avoided making turkey because I found it too dry.  This was moist and so, so tasty.  There ended up only being 4 of us for dinner but we don't mind we are looking forward to eating the leftovers.  PS I had to cover it with some foil half way through roasting because the brown sugar browned the skin really fast.

I didn't know about brining until last year and will use this recipe from now on.  The turkey was really moist and had great flavor.  I couldn't find baking bags large enough or sturdy enough to hold the turkey and brine, so I used a trash bag. Also didn't have room in the fridge so used our travel cooler which doubles a mini fridge and marinated for two days.

We had a couple of whole chickens to use and so we did the same with those on our smoker.  Just gave them a butter, salt, pepper crust and cooked for about 6 hours at 240 degrees.  We used apple wood this time but next time I think we'll try hickory.  This is a wonderful poultry brine.  Thanks!

It rocked. This brine produced the sexiest turkey I have ever made...so attractive that I even have a picture of it hanging in my cubicle. I suggest using a fresh bird...I don't know if it makes a real difference or not but I know how I felt when I told everyone that this was a fresh 22 lb turkey brined over night in a delicious array of garlics and spices..."ooooooh" 
Sounds fancy, doesn't it?

My turkey turned out GREAT! And we overcooked it quite a bit (meat thermom temp was off the chart).  Only had time to let it soak for 24 hrs.

I brined for 24 hours instead of the recommended 2 days and the turkey turned out yummy.  I should note that I fried the turkey and did not roast it. This was my first time brining a turkey and I will be using this recipe every year for Christmas and thanksgiving to come.

This was my first Thanksgiving doing everything myself.  My turkey was perfect!  Even my critical step-sister in-law was floored at how moist and tasty this turkey was.  Thanks

I've never brined a turkey before, but tried this recipe for my Thanksgiving turkey along with Alton Brown's method of cooking and it was AWESOME!!!  The ingredients give it a good flavor and there's wasn't a dry piece of meat on the whole bird.  I cooked it uncovered and didn't baste it and could not believe how juicy it was..  There was barely any left!  This is definitely a keeper!

The best Turkey we ever had. We added 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary in the cavity before we put it the roaster. I don't know how it could of tasted any better.

Best turkey we've ever had- juicy/not salty. I heated all the seasonings with a few cups of water until dissolved. Mixed in the rest of the liquids and used huge, clear (new) trash bag liners (super thick) and dropped it all in there - tied it up and put in a cooler bag with a ton of ice in the garage as suggested - freed up my refrigerator too!

Ok so I will never make another turkey (or chicken) with brine before!!! It was my first Turkey for Thanksgiving and it came out so moist and juicy and delicious!! My father in law has been cooing turkey's all the years and he said that I'm in charge now, WOW!!! So all I did was wash it out after and then between the meat and the skin I rubbed an herb infused butter that I made and the skin came out delicious!!! I added a few more herbs to the brine to, but I made it to the recipe and it still came out delicious!

I've only made a turkey a few times and had never brined a turkey before.  This year I decided to try it, partly because my turkey never thaws all the way, so I thought this would help with that along with giving the turkey a good flavor. I followed the recipe exactly.  I soaked my turkey in the brine for 2days prior to Thanksgiving, and the turkey was AWESOME!  Everyone raved about it. I made gravy with the drippings and didn't have to season it at all.  Just thickened it and it was out of this world as the recipe says.  This will be the way I prepare my turkey from now on.  Wish I hadn't told the secret to everyone on Thanksgiving.  They would have just thought I had a knack for roasting a great turkey!

Turkey turned out awesome with added softened butter underneath the skin of the turkey.  Probably the most moist turkey breast I have ever eaten, even better than a deep fried one.

We loved this! I followed the recipe and it was perfect. My 13yr old daughter who doesn't even like turkey couldn't stop praising it. I took note from others though, about the gravy. The drippings were very salty and you could taste the w. sauce. I boiled the neck and the giblets and used that to make my gravy. I will always make my turkey this way now.

We brined a 19 lb. turkey in this solution for about 20 hours and then grilled it for Thanksgiving.  Because it was a self-basting turkey, I cut the salt a little.  It was the juiciest turkey we've ever made (matched only by deep-frying injected turkeys).  The breast meat was practically squirting as we carved it, and the turkey platter made multiple rounds around the table as the guests gobbled it up.  We'll be using this recipe often, and I can't wait to try it with roast chicken.

Easy brine.  The turkey was moist and tasted great.  I brined in a turkey bag, then placed in a bucket in the fridge.  I will use this again.

In one word: FANTASTIC! I never brined a turkey before and now I never will make my turkey any other way. I was afraid that it might be too salty, but it was perfectly seasoned! I used a 15 pound fresh turkey and followed the recipe exactly. The pan drippings were somewhat salty, but I anticipated that and had prepared a salt free turkey stock. When I added the drippings, the gravy came out perfect. 

This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent; superb...the moistest Turkey we have ever baked in our home!  We did not use the entire amount of canning salt called for.  I only used 1 cup.  It still turned out GREAT.

We tried a few brines before we found this one, and we'll never look back. The bird is delicious and moist (roasted), and the best part is that the gravy from the drippings doesn't need hardly any additional seasonings.

This year was my best turkey yet! I soaked it in the brine for 2 days before cooking, refreshing the mixture half-way through. I barely had enough leftovers for sandwiches.

I made this for Thanksgiving, exactly as it was called for in the recipe.  Although it was a tender and moist turkey, there was a definitely salty taste to the meat and the gravy. We like salt, so it isn't like we're purists.  However, the saltiness was overwhelming and really made the gravy inedible.

This was perfect!  The turkey was the most moist I have ever tasted.  The only change I made was to add vegetable broth.

Followed to the letter on Brine. Created a bit of smoke during first 30 minutes on high temp because of oil, but stuck it out and made a great turkey. Wing tips got a bit crunchy, but rest of turkey was wonderful.

This made the most succulent and juicy turkey breast ever! I brined the turkey overnight, and then basted with butter before and during baking. It was amazing, and I'm not even that big of a fan of turkey!

I made this recipe just as written and felt that it was way to salty.  I also rinsed the turkey really well before placing it in the brine (other reviewers thought that was necessary).  I noticed that  quite a few of the  reviews, with a 5 star ratings,  smoked the turkey as the cooking method.  I roasted the turkey and I don't know if that could have made a difference.  Nonetheless, if you make this recipe you may want to have an alternative gravy plan instead of using the drippings.

I doubled this brine for a 20 pound turkey and soaked it for 12 plus hours. My husband slathered it with some seasoning and bourbon maple syrup and smoked it on the Traeger at 250. It was done in 5.5 hours and was juicy and delicious! Even better since I didn’t have to worry about over cooking it and taking up oven space!!!!

The only change I made was to add fresh sprigs of rosemary.  This was delicious - makes turkey so moist.  I even over cooked it because I didn't get home in time to take it out.  No leftovers from a 19 lb bird!!!!

I also stuffed the cavity with a lemon, cut in half, a whole clove of garlic, cut in half, and 4 or 5 six inch sprigs of thyme. Tied the legs together and smoked as usual. Everyone loved it!

Very good Brine. I was a little scared about 2 days of brining because of salt. Definitely use kosher salt. Everyone said best Turkey they ever had cold or hot!

5 Stars! Fantastic!  The only change we're going to make is reduce the salt to 1 cup, not 1.5 cups.   Even using Kosher salt, some cuts were little saltier than we like.

This recipe is great, my turkey was super tasty and moist. After brining it for 2 days I soaked the Turkey in water for 15mins before roasting it to remove all the salt.

I tried this recipe for our 13 lb. Thanksgiving turkey. We smoked it in our electric smoker at 250 degrees for 4 hours to 165 degrees using mesquite chips 3x and it turned out perfect! It is the most moist I’ve ever made. One thing to note is the turkey thermometer that is in each turkey never popped out. It isn’t reliable! We used thermometer probes. Also, I definitely wouldn’t add any more salt for that size turkey. Try it, you won’t be disappointed.

If you have bought a turkey that was already brined should I cut the salt back to half a cup, so that it is not to salty.

Ok so this was amazing!  I brined for about 24 hours prior to cooking.  I added some onion, rosemary, bay leaves, oregano, thyme, till it smelled good to my own tastes.  Then rinsed turkey slathered butter all over inside and out.  Cooked turkey in a roaster at 425 degrees for thirty minutes then set at 275 degrees until it was cooked to 165 internal temp.  It was sooooooooooo good!!!!  This is a great brine recipe.  I know I changed it a bit, but it was amazing.

This recipe is on point! I used a 9.75lb turkey and placed it in the brine for about two days in a stainless steel pot in the fridge. I definitely added an entire bulb of garlic because we're garlic people. For as small of a turkey as we had, I cut the recipe in half to reduce the amount of water needed. As someone else stated, make sure to rinse your turkey for a few minutes after a two day soak in the brine solution! The finished turkey had a spectacular taste and had the perfect amount of salty goodness. We also chopped up an apple and cooked that inside the turkey with the garlic from the brine. Overall, the taste was almost identical to a smoked turkey without the hassle of smoking!

We'll be using this brine from here on out! It's the best we've ever used. We brined overnight and then used a dry rub and smoked the turkey with apple wood. It was the best turkey we've ever had. It stayed moist through out

Delicious! Best turkey recipe I've ever tried. I followed the recipe and roasted it in the oven. 500° for 30 min and then 350° until done. It was a big hit!

I have been making this brine for our Thanksgiving turkey for four years! Every year I want to do something different and my family begs me not to. This is absolutely the best way to do a turkey. Of course you can add anything variations you want but the base recipe is beautiful!!!

Just the recipe I was looking for!  I loved the garlic and pepper.  My other recipe for brining didn't include those ingredients  and they made a difference.   I did add a few dashes of hot pepper sauce though.

Wow.. just wow!  YUMALICIOUS!

So easy to put together!  We had everything on hand to mix it up!!  We soaked  (in the fridge) a turkey breast  for 13 hrs.  Hickory smoked for 1:45 min and finished in the oven at 325*.  We use a meat thermometer (with temp alarm) so I can't tell you exact times on the cooking.   OFF THE CHARTS deeelish!  It was soooo MOIST and not salty!  Followed the recipe to the T.. no changes or substitutions made.  This one went into the book!!   PS~. It's not burned.  I put a rub on it prior to putting it in the oven.

This was the absolute best brine I have used! I had a 15 and 3/4 lb turkey and the recipe was just right for the bird. The turkey came out so moist and juicy. It was delicious! I will definitely use this again for the next Thanksgiving.

I was disappointed with my last turkey, so I looked into what would make it better, tastier, and juicier. This is it! I used kosher salt since I didn't have canning salt, and added slices of red onion to the brine. I left my turkey in the brine for about 8 hours, and then roasted, and it was amazing! I will brine my turkeys from now one! One thing to note, is that even though my turkey was stuffed, it was done and reached the temp if 165 about 30 to 45 min sooner than shortest cook time for a 14 lb turkey. Thank you for a great recipe.

I actually meant to leave a review much sooner than this. We made our first smoked turkey this past Thanksgiving and it was gone!  All of it! Everyone raved over how good it was. I know the brine is at least 75 percent of the reason the turkey was so good. The other 25 percent was my husband smoking it and using Applewood. This will definitely be my go to brine recipe from here on out. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great mix.  I mixed it up in the blender and set a couple of chickens in it overnight before I smoked them the next day.  Thats all the seasoning I did and it was amazing.  The chicken turned out so juicy, the kids loved it.  I made 4 more chickens like this for a total of six, and they all turned out the same.

This is truly the best turkey brine I’ve ever had. I can’t believe how flavorful it is. You could cut back the salt a little bit but other than that it’s perfect. Try this recipe for an easy and most effective brine. You won’t be sorry.

Followed exactly, turkey was way too salty, needs a chart or something to vary the brine times or salt amounts based on turkey weight.

Always fun to get the turkey ready for Thanksgiving. After it’s in brine for 2 days it goes in the smoker. This is year 4 (I think) with the same recipe.

AMAZING! First and last brine I will look for. Juices were flowing everywhere when I cut it. I couldn't find kosher salt so I used .75 cup of table salt. Turned out just fine and not too salty. I had rave reviews from everybody who ate it. I did smoke it, not bake. I will be making my 2nd one for Thanksgiving in just a couple days!

I love this brine recipe. I also add some whole cloves (about 8-10) and 1/4 tsp allspice. I heat my brine to dissolve all salt and sugar and then cool prior to submerging the bird. I brine for 3 days and then cold smoke for 6-8 hours and then we deep fry the bird. Best turkey EVER....

This lives up to being smokey flavored.  I followed the recipe exactly and my only change next time will be to use half the amount of salt. Even using canning salt and rinsing well it was so salty it was almost un-fit to eat. For anyone who has to watch their salt intake (as one of my guests did) then this is a recipe that you need to drastically change or just skip.

Loved it!!! I added chopped onions and did one and a half times the recipe for a 19 lb turkey. Using a brining bag made this so easy. We brined it overnight in the fridge and then grilled it on our weber charcoal grill and it was amazing!!

I love this brine recipe. I have an extra fridge, so I clean out my veggie bin and put frozen turkey and brine in there a couple of days before I want to use. Half way through I turn the turkey over. I have roasted and smoked my turkeys using this brine and it is delicious every time! You can stuff the cavity w/ oranges, etc. BUT it is not necessary. Rinse well before cooking.

This was the first time I ever brined my Thanksgiving turkey so I didn't make any changes to the recipe. Everybody agreed that this was the best tasting and juiciest turkey they had ever had.  This will definitely be my go to recipe every year! Delicious!

I used this bike for out Thanksgiving turkey this year. I did add some thyme and bay leaves. Soaked the bird for about 10 hours then into the pellet smoker for about 6 hours. It was awesome! Turkey was moist, smokey and flavorful. Will definitely use this again.

Shut your mouth! This was by far the best turkey that's ever entered my mouth. Can I get an Amen! I've cooked several turkeys and dreaded each one. Nine times out of ten they were dry but not this baby. She was moist, seasoned beautifully and looked as good as she tasted. I so wish I had taken a picture, it was the prettiest turkey I've ever cooked. And as stated by other reviews just as good the next day. If your on the fence about this recipe jump off NOW! You won't regret it. My husband thought I fell and hit my head when I decided to try it. We had never heard of brining. I'm so happy that Allrecipe exists, without this site I'd be serving dry turkey. I'd also like to thank the person for sharing their family recipe. I'll never not brine again. Oh, guess I should share how we cooked her. I let the turkey brine 2 full days, rinsed her very good, water smoked her at 250 for 6 hours until she reached 165 degrees. We used the brine in the smoker instead of water and tossed in pecan wood chips that we had soaking in water. And wa la, just a beautiful tasteful turkey. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed, wasn't to salty at all. Perfection!!! My husband was like, "we need to remember how we did this and never change it". My kids loved it too. When we cut into the turkey and saw the juices run my heart just soared... again thanks so much, we loved it!

Great base brine.  The turkey turned out very moist & flavorful.  I'll likely add some herbs next time to increase the flavor complexity.

I made a 1/4 recipe for as I was only going to brine 2 turkey thighs. It was just the right amount, and I put the thighs in while still frozen. I let is sit for not quite 2 full days and it was great, gave the meat a very juicy flavor. I would make it again!

I loved this recipe! It was the first brine I made with a real flavor. The turkey was smoked and out of this world with tenderness. I will definitely make this again with one change. I don't use a lot of salt in my daily cooking so this turkey was a tad saltier than expected but tolerable. Will probably use only one cup of salt next time.

I made  this brine. I had never hosted thanksgiving dinner before and wanted to put extra time and effort into making it a great first one. Making the brine was easy however, I did not realize at the start of my "turkey" project that I did not have a pan large enough to submerge the entire turkey in the brine nor did I have a brine bag. So be sure you have at least one of these items before you begin your brine. What I ended up doing was soaking one side of the turkey the first day and then the other side the next. Luckily it worked out okay but beware: This recipe calls for a lot of garlic and it "scented" my house for a week. Next time I'll definitely use a bag so I can seal it tight. 
With all of that being said.......Everyone just loved it! My partner even said it was better than his mother used to make!

I have Brined turkeys in the past and they've proven to be too much trouble and not worth the time and effort. This one was awesome! I'll definitely do it again. Very tender and mouth wateringly  juicy! The aroma of this cooking was out of this world. I also added about a cup of apple juice to the brine but I think the Worcestershire sauce is what really did it

I have used this 2 years in a row for our Thanksgiving Turkey.   I have had good results soaking it as little as 20 hours before roasting the turkey.  

There is a salt conversion table at http://www.mortonsalt.com/article/salt-conversion-chart/ for the various other kinds of salt in case you don't hae canning salt at hand.

I use this for Christmas and Thanksgiving!!! It is fabulous! And just when you think it can't get any better, I use the drippings and boil the bones to make some amazing turkey broth.  I substitute that in soup recipes all winter long in place of chicken broth! :)

Good recipe, I use it sometimes. Usually I use many more ingredients and invent my own, but this one's solid.  Only thing, I use nowhere near two gallons of water.  I use just enough to cover the turkey.  We have between 8 and 20 people over when I make this sort of thing, and they're always happy. I also cook the turkey on the grill.  I believe that's the only way, even if it's raining or as cold as 10 degrees F.

I have used this the past 2 years at Thanksgiving and am just now getting around to reviewing it....woah slacker.  But, the fact that I have used it 2 years in a row goes to show how much I love it!! I used it for both oven roasting and for a fried turkey and both were so darn good!!! Both years I have had people ask how I keep the turkey so moist. Thank you for helping in an effortless and delicious thanksgiving turkey...x2!

We used this brine to cook our very first smoked turkey.  It turned out PERFECT!   We let it soak for 2 days in the fridge, Pat it dry then slathered it in olive oil and herbs.  Moist & delicious!  This is my new Thanksgiving tradition!

Omg! Absolutely delicious!  I put my turkey in this mix 48 hours prior to frying and I could not believe how flavorful and juicy the turkey was, even days later juices were still flowing from the turkey! I will use this recipe every year from now on!

My turkey was just under 13 pounds. I followed the directions to the "T". I have to admit, 48 hours of brine that called for 2 and 1/2 cups of canning salt had me nervous. Once I removed it from the brine, I placed a pan over my charcoal to catch the drippings. I placed the turkey on the grill with hickory wood as my flavor. It smoked for about 5 hours.  Every guest of 12 said it was the best turkey they had ever had.  Big statements, but I agree.  It came out perfect.  *****+

My grocery-getter accidentally got regular table salt instead of kosher salt.  Added a bunch of onion, garlic, parsley, thyme, rosemary and sage to the brine.  I soaked the 20 lb turkey for 16 hours in my deep fry pot (no fridge needed, just left it outside in the cold car).  Deep fried for 65 minutes at 300 F in peanut oil - best bird I've ever made.  I don't understand the science of why brining makes the bird taste better but it does.  Looking forward to doing it again at Christmas.

Very flavorful and moist without being mushy. Smoked the turkey with Apple wood. Put onions and apples in the cavity of the bird. Smoking liquid was apple juice, water, onion,and fresh rosemary. The bird was fantastic!

Loved it. The turkey smelled so good even before I cooked it and was moist and flavorful. I added fresh rosemary and sage to brine along with about 6 tangerines I had in the fridge that i chopped up in the food processor.

I did not use prebasted turkeys, I specifically bought and used canning salt, and I removed them from the brine before 24 hours. One was so salty it can not be eaten alone, it will have to be cooked into other things to try to reduce the amount of salt. The other was cooked in the smoker and it was not as salty at the oven baked, but still too salty.  This recipe is good but I recommend younot leave your turkey in the brine more than 12-14 hours.

I've been making this brine for the past three Thanksgivings and it's excellent.  I let my turkey marinate about three days, flipping the bird every day so the juices can fully penetrate through the turkey.  Note: no need to add spices after you take the turkey out of the brine.  Just add butter and I cook in a bag according to package instructions.

I have been using this recipe for every turkey holiday since I found it 5 years ago and it's FANTASTIC!!  Everyone that's tried it requests that I make the turkey each year. It's wonderfully flavored and the brine ensures that for the following week, leftover turkey Is still moist!  We never do a whole turkey, just an enormous breast and we've cooked it in an electric smoker and the oven.  My only recommendation is that if you like the smoked flavor but have to bake, just add a couple of tablespoons of liquid smoke to the brine the last 6-8 hours. If you add it when you make the brine, it can be overpowering.

My go to recipe to brine turkeys, chicken, beef and pork.
Try grilling chicken legs after brining. Wonderful flavors. After brining  a beef roast or pork you do not have to add any more seasoning, it is all in the beef.

I have to admit, when I used this, I didn't actually eat any of the turkey.   However, turkey leftovers were put in the freezer and when I used those -O M G!  Incredible flavor!  I will be using this from now on!

Here is what I do to deal with having a side by side ice box and not having enough room to put a turkey in it. I have a yeti cooler I use to thaw and brine my turkey in. I am sure other clean cooler will work too, may have to use more frozen pop bottles. I put frozen turkey in yeti then put two frozen 2 liter pop bottles in with turkey then close it up. It take two days in yeti to thaw out. Then trade out bottles for new frozen ones, and put brine in with turkey, for the two days. I fill my pop bottles 3/4 of the way when freezing them. Frozen bottles keep from thinning brine down like ice would. Other ice chest may require more frozen bottles too. This is the best brine I have used yet....very yummy, made my husband like the white meat on turkey...

I tried to use an oven bag for my brine, but it just leaked right out.  Luckily I had it setting in a container in the sink, so just used that to brine my turkey in.  After reading some reviews that said it was too salty, I only used 1 cup of kosher salt and that was fine.  My turkey turned out nice and moist after roasting in the oven.

Ease off on the salt just a bit, make sure you rinse your bird well before roasting, and if you use drippings for gravy and/or stuffing do NOT add salt -the salt from the drippings will be plenty.  I've used this recipe since 2012 and always receive rave reviews on my turkey.  I buy a frozen bird and let it thaw in the brine solution for 5 days in a 5 gallon bucket out in the garage (I live in Indiana, so it's plenty cool in the garage).

This is the 2nd time I have used this brine when doing my "Trash Can Turkey". It is amazing. I added two whole heads of smashed garlic, 1 whole chopped onion and 1 whole crushed orange. And the family loved it.

Absolutely out of this world! I have brined chickens with other brines and wasn't impressed.  Actually I was never going to brine birds again but I let the wife pick the "menue" and I'm glad she did! Good stuff.

Excellent.  Used with Martha Stewart's suggestion of soaking cheesecloth in butter and covering turkey with it.

The second time I made this,seemed salty.  Will cut back on salt next time.

Incredible!!   Used 2/3 cup sea salt (only)- Garlic powder(not garlic salt)-added a touch of cayenne pepper and maybe one gallon of water.  15 lbs turkey smoked for 7.5-8 hours (30min per lbs).  Mesquite wood and last hour added more mesquite and put a stick of butter in the cavity.  Want to try next more cayenne (not noticeable at all). Possibly hickory wood.  Temp 220-250ish

I decided to use a brine this year instead of my usual marinade. I substituted  Kosher salt for the canning salt and cider vinegar for Worcestershire sauce. This was the best and most moist turkey I've ever served. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I substituted the water for apple juice. Its another dimension of flavor with the  apple flavor. Apple Cider is whole other story, very good with the garlic and pepper.

Best brine you will ever try. Even adding less water or more sugar, pepper, garlic or worshesire won't ruin it. No fail super easy. And I only brined for one day a few times. Still wicked!!

This is the only way to do turkey !! Breasts are amazing and tender and moist ! It's so simple and with a roasting bag , it pretty much takes the worry out of roasting turkey ! I used a (new ,only for this) 10 gal bucket with a lid and partially frozen breasts! Make sure to stir and dissolve salt ! You could even weight a breast or small turkey down so it stays submerged. I Start temp high then turn to lower temp.

I was too lazy to chop some garlic so I used about 1 tsp of granulated (all I had in the house). For fun I added 1/4 cup of Demitiri's Bloody Mary mix. I put the 14 lb. bird in the brine at 11 pm, took it out at 6:30 pm the next day.

I put it in my Masterbuilt Smoker, on a Spanek Vertical Roaster, with cherry wood pellets, for 3 hours (I actually forgot about it while we watched a movie). The back skin was split, but otherwise it was perfect. Some might consider it rather salty, but that's how my wife and I like it. It's the best smoke turkey I have ever done.

I would not hesitate doing it again for company.

After spending way too much money on brining mix at W & S for the last 4 years, I decided to try this recipe and am I glad I did!  I followed the recipe as is and threw in a cut-up orange with rind along with some fresh rosemary and sage.  I loved the ease of not having to first cook and then cool the brine.  Instead of putting the turkey and brine in a roasting bag (not large enough for a 16.5 lb. turkey and the brining liquid) or a large brining bag (too pricey), I use a small styrofoam cooler which holds everything nicely and still fits in my refrigerator.  After soaking the bird for 24 hours, it was cooked on a charcoal rotisserie with mesquite wood chips and, honestly, it was the best tasting turkey I've ever had!  It was much better than the Thanksgiving turkey which was cooked the same way, but brined in the expensive W & S dry brine mix.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I used this for a turkey I smoked at Thanksgiving. It was great. I used an igloo drink cooler. The kind you see at a sports event or construction site. I put the turkey inside an oven roaster bag and poured the brine in with it. Put it in the cooler with ice. Worked great.

I'll keep it simple.  Followed the recipe, brined for 2 days, cooked it indirectly on the Webber with no additional seasoning added.  The best turkey ever.  Period.

THIS is a very good brine for poultry.  We use this recipe and then smoke or fry our turkey.  This brine adds a great flavor.

If I could give more then 5, I would give 10 stars!  I always brine poultry prior to cooking - have done it for years - and take the process seriously.  However, I spotted this recipe and figured why not?  SO SO SO glad I did!  I had 2 turkeys - one to roast in the oven and one to smoke on the grill.  It took 3 gallons of water to cover both in a huge kettle.  I made the recipe for 2 gallons of water, added to the turkeys in a kettle and then just added 1 more gallon of water.  Although diluted, it was still the most amazing brine ever!  Who takes poultry from the brine and says - wow this smells amazing??  NO ONE - until this!  I had a 10 pound turkey and a 12 pound turkey; both fresh.  I don't know if they were injected or not at butcher.  I rinsed the brine off and cooked.  They both gained pounds after brining!  The brine created such a juicy turkey, very forgiving after long cooking times.  These had to be the best turkeys I have EVER made.  Thanks for sharing!

I have never cooked a turkey and this was my year to cook one so I decided to brine it first. I used this recipe. I brined a pre-basted 12 pound butterball. After reading the reviews for this recipe, some reviewers said that it resulted in a very salty turkey, so I put in only 1 cup of sea salt and added some onions and thyme and brined it for approx. 12 hours in a 5-gallon bucket. My turkey turned out great. Wasn't salty at all and the turkey came out super moist. Definitely will do this next year!

I use brines often and especially with turkey.  I followed this recipe exactly but I think the two day brining process made the turkey overly salty.  If I use this recipe again I will cut back to one day of brining.

Great brine.  Don't waste your time or money if you have a large bird on the roasting bags, they blow open.  :-( large bucket is the way to go!

Adding to my other reviews of this brine..Another Thanksgiving and another smoked turkey with this brine. Even the smell of cold leftovers still make me involuntarily salivate like Pavlov's dogs.

I had never brined a turkey before last year.  I used this recipe exactly as it was written and had the juiciest most flavorful turkey I've ever had and by oven roasting it no less  It was even juicier than my deep fried turkeys the last couple years.  I have one soaking as we speak. Once you try it once I doubt that you will do it any other way! Thanks! Not very much work for a much better bird!

I used the turkey roasting bag to contain the brine, and dropped in an 18qt cooler for a day and a half.  Smoked turkey the next day, basting the bird every hour after 2 hours on the grill.  Delicious!  Tender, just the right flavoring.  Not too salty at all.

I brine turkeys nearly the same way but I cold smoke them for about 5 hours with oak before I brine them. That way the smoke flavor goes all the way to the bone while it sits in the cooler.  I use water ( without chlorine ) salt, brown sugar, apple juice, black pepper and lime juice, I use thick trash bags and open them in a cooler then place the turkey in and pour the brine over the turkey. I close up the bag and let it sit for 3 days with ice on top of the turkey. Since they are already have a smoked flavor they can be cooked in the oven at 250 degrees – 30 minutes per pound or put back on the smoker for more smoke.

This was by far the best Turkey we ever had.  I did add more garlic than called for.  Used wash pail but line it wit a plastic garbage bag so it was easier to handle.  This was a winner!!

We started using this recipe after we tried to deep fry a turkey, did not like deep frying so the next year we used the BBQ Pit. I researched brining recipes and found this one and have never done anything different. Every year we make at least one turkey on the pit(extremely large pit so it really smokes it) The benefit is that it does not take up room in the oven so I have more space to cook. Everybody RAVES about it and always wants to know how to make it. They cannot believe how juicy, and flavorful it is. My vegetarian niece even said that she cannot wait for her Uncle Gordons turkey for Christmas this year, lol.

Very juicy turkey!  Had a cheap turkey, but it tasted great.  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds.  Even heard one guy say it was the best he had ever eaten.  Only downside is that you can't use drippings for gravy, due to the brown sugar in the brine.  I imagine it would make the gravy sweet.

This was the first time I attempted to brine a turkey and I will NEVER go back!  Even those that didn't like turkey before thought it was amazing.  Very moist and flavorful.  I used some ground pepper and some whole peppercorns.  Definitely worth the time!!

This was the best turkey I have ever made.  The brine made it so full of flavor and moist.  I also used the juicy thanksgiving turkey recipe to roast it.  I will be using this every year.  I didn't need to change a thing.

I loved this recipe, but did not have any Worcestershire sauce.  So I made my own with some balsamic vinegar, liquid smoke, soy sauce, small amount of olive oil and some other sauce I might have found on the shelf.  The liquid smoke was an absolute wonderful change in flavor that everyone enjoyed.

This brine was awesome! I used a small 11lb turkey. Since it was a frozen store-bought bird that had been injected with a salt solution, I only brined it for about 14hrs so it wouldn't be too salty. It came out perfectly moist with great flavor.

Great brine base however I added 1/2 gal apple juice and reduced water to 1-1/2 gal.  Turkey taste is apple subtle and really drew many kudos.   Do chicken thighs and breasts same way and are outrageous.

This was the first year for me to try a brine on my turkey. I have heard alot about it but have never tried it.  This receipe WOW-ED my family. It had such great flavor and was so moist.  This was very easy to put together and I used a brine bag that I purchased from the grocery store.  All I can say is yummmmmm.

I thought this was a great brine.  MY family and guests loved it and they did not think it was salty at all. I did add a jerk rub that had brown sugar, white sugar, black and white pepper, and Cayenne. This may have taken away from being salty. I also smoked it for 12 hours with hickory wood and my turkey was 22lbs. It was juicy and full of flavor all the way to the core of the bird. I've been smoking all kinds of meat for years and this was the best turkey I've done. I also stuffed the turkey with apples and used sprayed it with apple juice during the smoking process to keep it from drying out.

I tried this brine recipe this year and I must admit my 20 lb. turkey turned out great.  It was by far the best turkey I have ever made.  I did mix a bunch of fresh herbs with garlic and butter and stuff it between the skin and the breast and I covered the just the breast meat after 2 hours with foil to help seal in the juices but it worked. I also put the turkey at 500 for the first 30 minutes and then turned it down to 350 for the remaining 5 1/2 hours.  Thanks for sharing.  I will definitely do this again.  Even the left overs are fabulous cold right out of the fridge.  Very happy I tried this recipe!

This is the first time I've ever brined a turkey before roasting.  I followed the recipe to the letter including using canning salt and rinsing the turkey after brining.  Maybe it's just my taste buds or maybe I inadvertantly did something wrong but I found the turkey on the salty side.  I cooked stuffing inside the bird.  I didn't add salt to the dressing specifically because it was being cooked inside a brined turkey.  Figured hubby and I could add salt at the table if it was needed.  Nope..it was plenty salty too.  The meat was tasty and moist but not as tender as some birds I've roasted over the years.  Over all I wasn't too impressed but with all these rave reviews, who knows.  I will try a different brine next year.

Love this brine, we have used this twice and has turned out great each time.  Turkey oven bag is the best way to soak your turkey.

This was an incredible brine.  I took other reader's suggestions and brined in the vegetable drawer of the fridge- be careful, it's heavy when filled and the fridge smells of garlic!
I brined the turkey for 24 hours, flipping every 6-8 hours as it wasn't completly submerged in the liquid. The turkey was incredibly moist and tender.  I cooked it in a roasting bag and the drippings made a wonderful gravy.  Will do this every year from now on.

Used this recipe to brine my Thanksgiving Turkey for 20 hours before smoking it. My daughter (who is not a fan of turkey)accused me of selling my soul for something that tasted so amazing.

This brine made my turkey so rich and flavorful, I will definitely use this recipe every time I make a bird. I did alter it slightly, using 2 cups of kosher salt instead of 1.5, and I used garlic powder (roughly 2 tsp) instead of minced garlic, threw in some poultry seasoning (about 2 tsp) and threw in a few bay leaves. And my bird came out perfect, I roasted it instead of smoking, and I had about 2-3 cups of drippings in my turkey bag. This was my first turkey and everyone said it was the best they'd ever had. The gravy I made with the drippings was also super yummy. I would highly recommend this brine to anyone.

Really loved this recipe, but based on other reviews I was worried it would be too salty.  I suggest cutting the salt back to 1 cup.  I only brined mine for 1 day, which seemed more than enough time.  I also used Alton Brown's method of cooking. My turkey was very tender and moist.  The first bite seemed salty, but after that I didn't notice it.  I am making this again this year.

I have been brining turkeys and chickens for years. I typically use a cup of table salt per gallon of water. It will not make the turkey too salty as long as you rinse it well.

I tried this recipe last year and we all decided the turkey was the best turkey we had ever eaten.   Moistm and surprisingly not salty. After brining, we roasted the turkey on the grill according to another recipe found on this site.  I will never cook another turkey in the house. Although we missed the aroma of a cooking turkey, nothing beats a turkey cooked on the grill.

When it comes to smoking turkey - I add flavor as much as possible to the brine so I also add whole herbs / whole peppercorns / whole crushed garlic.
I let it set outside in the Michigan weather for at least 24 hrs until I'm ready to put it in the smoker.
NEVER disappointed with a brine!

I will do this 1 from now on, but slightly alter it. I used a 13lb bird and brined it for 2 days. I doubled the spices except fopr the salt. I used kosher salt. It came out slightly too salty, so I'll try it with just 1 cup of salt next time.

I used this brine for Thanksgiving...my first time EVER brining a turkey.  I will DEFINITELY do it again using this recipe.  I didn't think the turkey was salty at all but the drippings were (no big deal - we aren't big gravy people anyway).  It had a great flavor.  If you can get past the smell of the worchestershire sauce it's definitely worth it!  I am HIGHLY recommending this recipe!!

This was absolutely fantastic.I followed the directions of the recipe and roasted turkey in oven.I usually fry or smoke my turkeys every year but this time i decided to put the turkey in an oven bag and roast it in the oven after the 2 days brining.I have already made 2 turkeys in a week and this is one of the juiciest turkeys and I can't wait to smoke one after using this brine.Thank you very much for the recipe.

I soaked my turkey overnight, then cooked it in an oven roasting bag with broth. It was FANTASTIC!!!! Not just the best I ever cooked, but the best I've ever tasted! I will never cook a turkey any other way!

The turkey was tasty and so moist.  I made gravy from the drippings and my hubby loved it.  I thought it was too salty, but he thought it was perfect.  It didn't say to rinse the turkey or anything so maybe that was why there was a lot of salt in the drippings.

I hosted Thanksgiving this year and the turkey got rave reviews from everyone.  I went by the recipe exactly and then cooked in bag in oven.  Meat practically fell off the bone and had lots of flavor.

I tried this just to do something different.  I didnt let the turkey sit for 2 full days, was more like 1.5 days, and I cooked it breast side up.  It was juicer than I expected, usually cooking a bird breast up makes the meat dry.  Next time I will cook the bird breast down and see how that turns out.  Will use this again!

Used for my Thanksgiving turkey. I added some bicentennial rub to the brine and also the turkey breast before baking. I also put a few onions, carrots and celery with thyme in the cavity while baking. Baked the stuffing on the side.  It was EXCELLENT!! Tender and juicy with lots of flavor. Will continue to use this recipe.

I had an out of this world roasted turkey using this brine.  I even added a little more brown sugar, threw in a cut up orange, lemon.  Used 2 heavy duty plastic construction garbage bags to ensure nothing leaked out. Turned every 24 hrs. This breast was like eating a prime cut meat.  Fantastic to a tee the recipe & will never use anything else. You've gotta just try it.....Well worth it!!

Best turkey ever!  We soaked a 12lb turkey in brine for about 54 hours and then smoked it for about 6.5 hours.  It was truly out of this world!

Loved this brine.  The turkey turned out moist and flavorful.  The brine is salty and if you are making gravy out of th juice from the turkey make sure you don't add any extra salt or it is way too salty

I wish I could send you a photo of the outcome - just picture perfect, juicy & flavorful.  I only had 1 day to brine it & it was a 32-lb turkey.  We did it on the outdoor grill using the indirect heat method & smoked hickory chips for added flavor the 1st couple hours.  Just excellent

A great, simple brine, nothing I didn't have on hand (I used tap water because our tap water is pretty good).  The turkey came out fabulously!  It was supposed to cook 4 hours, and I put it in breast-down to make sure the white meat was juicy.  When I pulled it out after 3 1/2 hours to flip it and brown the skin, it was too done to put back in.  It fell off the bone, it was so tender, and perfectly seasoned, perfectly juicy, excellent all-round.  (Which really saved my reputation, because I had been late getting it in the oven!)  Thanks for sharing a good recipe!

wonderful, I think I'll try to brine chicken too!  I have always baked my turkey upside down and they have always been very juicy but doing the brine helps to retain the juicyness for reheats too!
