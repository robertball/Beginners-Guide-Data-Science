I just made these bars, I did change the recipe a little bit. I added walnuts instead of the peanuts, and one large carrot instead of two. I also sprinkled some cinnamon on top. These bars were delicious, not sure why the dislike by other: to each there own I guess. Good job, plus I am glad now I don't have over-ripened bananas.

I feel a little bad leaving such a poor rating, but I had a hard time eating these. I did not find them to be good at all, though perhaps that is a matter of taste given the other two positive reviews here. I decided to try making these as a grab-and-go breakfast as I am working on being healthier, but had to force myself to eat them throughout the week (I felt bad just throwing them away and wasting all the ingredients after spending so much time grating them). For anyone interested in trying this recipe, perhaps try making a half recipe first to see if you like the taste. I mean no offense to the recipe writer, but wanted to write a review to caution others about making such a huge portion as they may not be everybody's cup of tea.

This is a great recipe! What an awesome and healthy snack for work, school, or to share with friends! I agree with PETERS., it did need cinnamon, which I sprinkled on top. I love this recipe because you can get creative with it. Next time I'll add raisins, Craisins, and will mix the cinnamon inside. Also, I chopped the apples finely instead of grating them; they weren't noticeable. Love this!!

The texture was a little too soft and flavor a little bland.  I did sprinkle cinnamon on top and used walnuts instead of peanuts.  Also added 1 Tbsp. of Chia Seeds.  Melted dark chocolate & dipped bars so just bottom covered in chocolate ... put in freezer overnight and store in refrigerator.  The chocolate and refrigeration helped flavor & texture.

This is now my go to breakfast on weekdays! My first few efforts were not good: too much coconut milk; wrong type of oats; baked too long. All my mistakes. It worked brilliantly on the last round!! I add cranberries, cocoa and chocolate chips for a little added fun!

I was specifically looking for a "clean" breakfast bar.  I made this recipe the first time as described with the exception of walnuts versus peanuts (just a personal preference) and then froze the extra bars for future breakfasts.  Since then I've made the recipe with blueberries, added hemp hearts, more cinnamon, etc. with great results.  I love that there is no egg, butter or sugar.  This isn't a dessert recipe, just a healthy and clean energy bar recipe.  Thank you for posting!

3.6.16   Followed this recipe to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing.  They were extremely moist and tender, and the bananas, apples, and applesauce gave just enough sweetness without overpowering.  Thanks for sharing cecdaisy.

These bars turned out better than expected! I followed the recipe aside from one thing: I replaced the chopped nuts with a half cup of creamy peanut butter, because I can’t eat pieces of nuts (dietary restrictions). I also drizzled them with a mixture of melted peanut butter and coconut oil when they cooled down a bit. I love addition of carrot and apple. The fruits and veggies stay slightly firm and give these bars tons of texture when mixed with rolled oats. I think replacing the chopped nuts with creamy peanut butter may have given these bars a slightly different texture. Mine were moist and almost brownie like. Lastly, my daughter and husband love them too! They’re a winner. I’ll definitely be making them again.

Did not make yet. Would be helpful to know what size apple, bananas and carrots to use. Maybe provide a weight fir these or a measured amount in cups. This may be why it is coming out gummy fir some and good for others. I expect tested accurate recipes as I already experiment on my own. Don’t need a website to give half info and waste my time.

Sorry, but I didn't like this. I followed the recipe exactly except didn't add carrots and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I cooked it for 25 minutes and once It cooled It felt rubbery and tasted soggy, especially the peanuts. I like making my own granola/breakfast bars but this one had a weird texture and not much flavor (even with the cinnamon I added!)

This recipe does not make bars. It makes pudding. Does make a good breakfast but not a grab and go breakfast. I wonder if adding a couple T of flour might help. I will find a different recipe for grab and go bars.

I didn’t add carrots, but I followed the recipe otherwise. The bars were mushy, and I think they would’ve been okay if they were hard. I didn’t like the taste, even though I was really looking forward to these.

Love this recipe, especially since you can play around with the recipe and add ingredients that fit your palate. I added 1/2 cup craisins with 4 extra spoonfuls of applesauce and sprinkled some cinnamon on top. Super good! Its diabetic friendly, easy to make, and a good grab'n'go breakfast without the extra oils and sugar.

These were quite tasty! I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I added one egg white, one tbsp of honey, a tsp of cinnamon and used pecans instead of peanuts. Overall I was pleased with how they turned out. I may try some variations on the spices with the next batch.

I gave this recipe 2 stars because its healthy. The taste is bland. It needs something with more flavor added . I will try it one more time with raisins to see if that sweetens it up otherwise,  I won't make again. Shout out to the person who submitted the  recipe. Thanks for trying to help us be healthier.

YUCK!  Absolutely god awful. Made exactly as the recipe stated.  Horrible texture and I baked it for 40 minutes because 20 and even 30 wasn't long enough.  Needs eggs or something but even the taste is awful.  Will never make this again.

Ick. Flavor great but the consistency was like silicone. I'm bummed. I forced myself to eat 1/2 butt couldn't take it anymore. It was like eating squares of rubber.

I made these per the recipe and I will probably make them again. They are a little bland as is so I may add a little salt next time. I also let the bananas ripen too much so next time I won't wait as long. I just took them out of the oven a few minutes ago and they are are very soft. I hope they firm up as they cool. Lastly, I spread a tiny bit of peanut butter on a piece and that took these to a whole new level.

I was looking for a healthy oat bar, but either this is not what I'm looking for, or it's horrible. I twisted the recipe and added coconut and lots of cinnamon, but the texture is mushy and not easy to slice. There is wayy too much carrot, and I couldn't taste any banana or apple.

I made these with the help of my 3 1/2 year old daughter. She did the mashing and mixing, I did the grating. Very quick. Simple. And delicious. I added peanut butter and raisins to kick it up a little. A guilt free snack :)

It does turn out moist, especially the bottom. I am drying the bottom out on cooling racks. I liked it alright but my kids hated it :(  Added about 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon & 2 tbsp of raw sugar.

The only change i made to this recipe was to sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top before baking. I expected that these bars would be hard and crunchy like a granola bar, however they were soft and rubbery. The taste was ok but the texture was weird.

Maybe I used too much carrot since mine were a little large (I used 1.5 which equaled almost 2 cups grated) but mine turned out relatively soggy. Maybe after they sit overnight they will firm up.

Good recipe as is, but I had to change things to suit my taste. I added some brown sugar (and will also add honey or agave next time) to make them a tad sweeter. Also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Switched out peanuts for walnuts. Also, my bananas were uber ripe, which did not get masked as much as it would have in banana bread, so be aware of that when you choose your recipe for overripe bananas. They were a little soft for my liking, but the flavors were very good. My husband liked them, especially since he is trying to eat healthier.

I made these yesterday, as I am doing a whole foods lifestyle but wanted something different,. I loved these! My sister ,who is a vegan absolutely loved them, too! I didn't have peanuts, but used pecans instead. Will have to try some cinnamon next time!

I added 2 Tb of honey and cinnamon because the mixture was pretty tasteless. I subbed pecans for the peanuts. It came out more moist than I thought but not bad. I enjoyed it in a bowl with vanilla Greek yoghurt.

I was looking for a grab and go breakfast and these are great! I would mention using Very ripe bananas as they will be sweeter. I agree cinnamon would be a good addition. I am going to get creative with ingredients as well.

These are a really nice alternative to my Think power bars, etc. So much healthier. I used my blender with the food processor attachment on puree to chop up the carrots, apple, and nuts then worked in the apple sauce and oats. So much easier than chopping everything by hand. I reheated a couple of bars this morning and drizzled a little honey on top. Tasty!

Like others suggested I added a tsp of cinnamon and I left out the peanuts. They are soft but firm which was perfect for my 10 month old (Who gobbled these up) will be making these regularly. I also love that they are so versatile, I can add different thing to keep my baby interested in eating them! Great quick and easy snack

I did not use the peanuts due to my. Granddaughters allergy . I found them dry and without much taste. I make banana-oatmeal balls formy grandchildren that they love in the morning. They are easier than these to make and are just as nutritious.

Made it exactly the way the recipe said to.  Except I baked it a little longer and it was  still mushy and had very little flavor. 
Will not be making them again.

Healthy, quick to make, easy recipe to 'tweak' (I used a pear instead of apple for example).
