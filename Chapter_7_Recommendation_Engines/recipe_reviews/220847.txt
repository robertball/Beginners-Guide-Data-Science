I found this to be very good but colorless, & really needs something like carrots in it for texture & some color. Other wise, it's kinda plain. If you are the kind of person that likes plain, then you would like it as is. I also usually add butter with my potato chips on top to brown them. I left these in an extra 15 minutes, & they still weren't browned good.I think next time I make this, I will add cooked carrots, & not precook the noodles, so they still have some texture.

MMMMM mmm almost the same as my tuna casserole...I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I swapped it out for cream of mushroom and I also added frozen peas for color. Instead of Velveeta I used 2 heaping tbsp of cheeze whiz and topped the whole dish up with sharp old cheddar...perfectly delicious...!!!

I made this recipe & found it very tasty.  I served it with cooked broccoli on the side, next time I may just add broccoli to the recipe.

I tried this recipe with a few modifications.  I added broccoli, did not cook the egg noodles, and added no chips.  When not cooking the noodles need to stir casserole so noodles do not get hard on top. Took less time to cook only 45 min. Great recipe thanks for sharing.

Very easily made and very tasty. This is a great way to use ham and all the cheese left over from the holiday. I agree that it could use a bit of color, so now I add a half cup OF frozen peas to the recipe.

I added four ounces of sharp cheddar cheese to the casserole ingredients, everything else I kept the same. Nice on-hand ingredients dinner. I did not try it myself but the husband and kids all said they liked it, NO leftovers.

My family loved this! I didn't have the Velveeda cheese but substituted grated jalapeno cheddar cheese (1.5 cups) and added broccoli. My 10 and 7 yr olds couldn't get enough!!

I used pepper jack cheese. It needs cheddar and maybe real jalapeno for kick. Good recipe, but I screwed it up thus 3 stars.

This was delicious!   Will definitely make this again!   The only thing I did different was to switch from evaporated milk to 2% milk.    When it came out of the oven it was a tad bit dry, so while it was still bubbly I added a splash more milk and it was perfect.

I tried this with leftover ham, used cream of bacon soup (yum!) and tossed in some bacon bits and frozen peas but it was still on the bland side.  Next time I want to put in some seasoning and pepper to add to the flavor.

This was a big win, made it just as written but added a can of mushroom pieces, which were a nice touch. I think you could also add peas or other vegetable that you like. If you like a little more kick you might also add some chili powder.
