I am pleased to be the first review of this tasty, satisfying Asian soup. I made my own chicken stock, using a leftover grilled chicken thigh and Better Than Boullion base, lending a slight smokey flavor to the soup broth. I also added one grated carrot for added flavor and color, along with the frozen wontons. Trader Joe's frozen wontons are our favorite and cooked two minutes is perfect. I upped the Chinese five-spice to 1 tsp and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, personal preference only. Thank you, DeviousMuse, for a winning recipe!

This was so good but because I'm not a fan of the Chinese Five Spice Powder I left that out. Instead of salt I sprinkled in some lite soy sauce. Delish and thank you!

This soup has great flavor! I loved it. I followed the recipe plus I added a couple of chicken breasts diced & browned.  My whole family really liked this, we especially liked the crunch of the water chestnuts. I will be making this regularly!

The entire family loves this soup.  I inadvertantly used a bag of frozen pot stickers  and I added the sauce into the broth and it was still delicious.

Easy and pretty tasty. I used frozen pot stickers because that's what my grocery store had. I had to cook it longer because they're bigger than wontons. Everything else I kept the same. Next time I'll add some ginger or garlic because I though it needed more seasoning.

I rarely write reviews for recipes but this soup is just too good!  I added some bits of chicken and had to leave out the spinach as I didn't have any, but the soup was still good without it.  This soup really cleared out my sinuses too!

This recipe was great, even with some of the modifications I had to make b/c of lack of ingredients. I only had chicken broth so I used 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. I didn't have water chestnuts or spinach, so I added 1 grated carrot and added about a cup of thawed frozen peas into the pot at the same time as the frozen wontons. I also like my food spicy so I made my own spice combo instead of using five-spice powder: 1 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp soy sauce (instead of salt). Quick, easy, and delicious.

I had to customize this recipe a lot due to lack of ingredients. I used vegetable broth, green onions, 1 clove of garlic, spinach, and 1/4 of a table spoon of mushroom soy sauce and a ton of cayenne papper. (I love spice!) The wontons I used are from the Chinese grocery store and there isn't much English on it. It was a chicken/shrimp wonton so it really added a lot of favour to the soup. Loveddd it. Warmed my belly and was light. Great as a late night treat.

Thank you for the tip to add the tops of the green onions as well.  I never know if I'm supposed to or not for any given recipe that calls for them.

My kids didn't like the spinach in the spoup. I think had I chopped it and maybe only put in half it wouldn't have been such a big deal. :( I will try again

It is definitely easy to make. Husband liked it but I did not care for the flavor. If I make it again I may only use chicken broth and omit the beef broth I think it was the combination of the two that I didn't care for.

I had a little extra time on my hands so I made some wontons with a simple veal/chicken filling and wonton wrappers.  I adjusted the spices to what I know my family likes and added some garlic and ginger. Had no complaints!

I used homemade chicken broth, added some shredded carrots and about a half cup of bean sprouts that needed to be used up.  Also, doubled the five spice, as we love it.  Wonderful easy, delicious soup !  This is a keeper for us, will be making often.   Thanks for posting, DeviousMuse.

This was a hit here. I made a couple small changes. I don't like Chinese five spice so I used thai seasoning. It needed a little something more...I added a Tb of soy sauce and now its just right. Keeper I used brandi's won tons from this site..

A great very quick meal option!  I have never used 5 spice before, liked it but would use a bit less.  I added 1/2 clove chopped garlic, 1/2 shredded carrot and 5 thinly sliced mushrooms when added the green onions and water chestnuts. We only had potstickers in the freezer so used those instead of wontons and worked perfectly.  A few drops of soy sauce added as needed ..I left this up to each person as some of us like soy more than others. Great addition to our quick meal repertoire !

This was great and fast. I didn't realize I was out of water chestnuts so I subbed zucchini for the crunch. I also just threw in some of the five spice powder so probably about a 1/4 teaspoon. My husband and I threw rice in with our soup to make it a main dish.

This soup was FAST and delicious!  I didn't have the Chinese 5 spice, so I used soy sauce and it was devoured by all! (Including a 13, 10 and 7 year old!). I served it with the coconut rice and some egg rolls.  Yum!

I could not find frozen wontons, and searched 2 grocery stores. I used P.F.Chang's frozen dumplings instead. The soup was alright, but tasted nothing like wonton soup at Chinese restaurants. It just tasted like beef broth.
