when you put the crust on the sheet pan, put it on the back of the pan.  Then just slide it off and on to the grill.

I would like further instructions on how to transfer crust from sheet pan.  This looks so good.  I am anxious to try, but I donâ€™t know how to handle the soft crust dough to put on the hot grill.
