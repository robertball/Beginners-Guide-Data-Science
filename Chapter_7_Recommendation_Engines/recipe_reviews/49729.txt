These were very good and we all enjoyed them but we all agreed we prefer the taste of shredded cabbage over the bean sprouts.  Also, I think cabbage is easier to work with and the wraps are easier to fold  than with the sprouts.  Because others complained of the salt content, I substituted the garlic salt for 1/8 tsp. garlic powder.  Tasted perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good, but I made a few changes since several people commented these were too salty.  I used cooked salad shrimp from the seafood counter instead of canned, used 3 cups cabbage instead of bean sprouts and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I baked mine for 10-15 minutes, turning 1/2 way through, because I don't like dealing with the mess of deep frying.

I decided to make these on a day when I was at home by myself and wound up wishing I had somebody at home to enjoy them with.  I used cabbage rather than bean sprouts and added some fresh ground pepper to the 2nd 6 before I rolled them up.  I like the ones with the pepper just a little better.  Deep fried in peanut oil and yum!

These were terrific! Used about 1 c sprouts and 2 c shredded cabbage w/ 1/2 c shredded carrot. Added 1 t minced fresh ginger. Limited soy sauce so it wouldn't make rolls soggy - garlic salt was great to get the saltiness it needed. Very delicious - just as good (if not better!) than restaurant rolls! I used chopped shrimp, next time I'll add pork/chicken.

These are superb!  We all loved them, although they were a little salty.  Albeit, I did sautee the chicken in a soy sauce, teriyaki, lemon & garlic marinade.  Overall, great!!!

These were pretty good. I used some left over chicken breast and precooked bacon. Didn't have any bean sprouts but cabbage was a nice substitute. Though, I did saute the cabbage in the skillet for 15 minutes or so. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, didn't have that. My egg roll wrapper package had 15 wrappers so we made them kind of small to use all the wrappers. I really would have liked to have them a bit on the large side though. That way their not too 'doughy' tasting, if you know what I mean.  Have the white of one egg in a bowl handy to seal the ends of your egg rolls towards the end of rolling the up....just use a small brush. A NEW paint brush works great (the small ones).  I deep fried the egg rolls at 350 degrees for 3 minutes PER SIDE. Any longer and they'd be burned.

I used fresh salad shrimp, I don't care for the canned stuff. I left out the chicken and bacon, just not in the mood for them. I could not find bean sprouts so I used cabbage. The end result was very good. I ate 4 of them. Thanks for posting!

Man were these good! I served them with store-bought plum sauce and they were gone before I knew it! Easy recipe to adjust to your taste as well.

These were okay for me.  I used cabbage instead of the sprouts, but they had a very strong salty, bacon flavor.  I really like bacon, but for some reason these didn't taste too great.  My husband liked them though.

I had some eggroll wrappers left from making some southwest eggrolls (yum) and thought I would finally try making Asian style eggrolls. This recipe seemed easy enough and sounded tasty. As other reviewers suggested, I did substitute frozen shrimp for the canned, low sodium soy for the regular and garlic powder for the salt to cut down on the sodium level. I left out the bacon since we don't eat pork. I also didn't have any bean sprouts so I substituted napa cabbage which I sauted for just a minute to wilt. I was really looking forward to homemade eggrolls, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed with these. They were just ok but nothing special. For the amount of work these took and the mess of frying, they weren't worth it and I won't be making these again. I will stick to my local Chinese food restaurant's eggrolls in the future.

Loved these!  This was my first attempt at making my own egg rolls and I was delighted with how easy they were and how tasty.  Will definitely be making these again!

Loved everything about this recipe except the canned shrimp.  Next time I'll use the frozen salad shrimp instead and I'm sure it will make it a 5 star recipe.

These were delicious, would definetly recommend them to anyone.  I kept the recipe as is because I love salty food, but if you don't I would use reduced salt soy sauce instead and substitue garlic powder for the garlic salt as another user suggested.

I changed the recipe just a little to our tastes after I made it the first time.  But is by far the best eggrolls we have ever tasted.  Far better than what you get at a chinese restaurant!!!

These were great! I subbed a bag of colw slaw mix for the bean sprouts, cooking it in a little oil, along with some garlic powder, chopped green onions and all of the other ingredients, until tender. I really didn't measure anything as far as seasoning, just tasted as I went along. Also, I used frozen (thawed) salad shrimp in place of the canned, which I added in at the last minute. I was quite surprised how well these flavors all went together...I would've never thought to combine them myself, but I'm glad I tried it b/c we loved it! I got 12 out of this recipe. I will def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
