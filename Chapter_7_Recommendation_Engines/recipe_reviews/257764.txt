Made as written except that I just waited to toast the bread in the final minutes the patties were cooking. I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of the burgers. Mine never did brown and I overcooked them trying to get them brown. I think they would have been better pan fried in a skillet with a little oil. I also found the flour to be unnecessary. The sauce ended up super think and really didn't need it in my opinion. I do think this is a good recipe and has potential but feel it needs tweaked a little.
