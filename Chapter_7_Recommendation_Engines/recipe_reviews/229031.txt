We were surprised at how well these flavors worked together. We tried it to use up some kale in the fridge, but now we have it quite often. I generally forget to marinate the kale, so know that it tastes almost as good if you just saute with the marinade just before serving.

This was good as written, even though I didn't care for the soy sauce with the kale.The spelt flour tortilla shells are a bit trickier to fold up than a flour tortilla, but the color, texture and flavor was real  good!

Would be better if the yams were roasted with some seasonings.  Will try that next time.
