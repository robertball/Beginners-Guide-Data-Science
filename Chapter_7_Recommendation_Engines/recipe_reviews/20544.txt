I replaced one ingredient with 1 pt of heavy whipping cream and added 1 tbps of honey.
This drink is "nectar of the gods."
Truly excellent.

This was really simple to make.  I admit that I was scared of the raw eggs, but went for it anyway.  The taste was great, but the whiskey for someone who is kind of a light drinker- had a bit too much of a kick and the thick texture was a bit off- but the taste- again was great.

This is a very good copy of Baileys. Not exact, but very good. I substituted whipping cream for the "non dairy creamer"(whatever that is).
