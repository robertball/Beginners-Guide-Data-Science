12.21.19  First, I followed this recipe to the letter.  The cheesecake flavor is spot on, however, the texture is not.  I left this cheesecake sit in the fridge overnight, so it had plenty of time to firm up.  I ran a knife around the inside, and when I released it from the springform pan, big chunks of the filling were stuck to the sides of the pan...not a pretty cheesecake!  I used an offset spatula dipped in water to smooth out the sides, so I could at least take a picture.  This rose above the height of the pan, so the top of the foil had a lot of the batter cooked on it.  Not a major problem, though, because the sour cream topping covered it up.  The texture is not firm like a cheesecake should be, the sides of the cake are soft, but when you get to the center, it’s like pudding.  Basically, it needs more than 40 minutes to cook, quite a bit more time I think.  Typically when I try a new recipe, and it turns out like this, I just move on.  Rather than writing this recipe off, I’m going to try one more time, cooking longer, because it’s really tasty, and I think has potential.
