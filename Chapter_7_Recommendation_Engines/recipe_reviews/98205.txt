Very good, but I found that it woks a little better if you saute the onion, garlic and celery in a little butter first -then add the remaining ingredients.  This was a big hit !

I made this for our family's New Years dinner and it got RAVE reviews!!!  It's the best way to serve black-eyed peas I have ever found!  My mom was a little apprehensive because I didn't make the peas from "scratch" but changed her mind immediately after she tasted them.  I used canned "seasoned" black-eyed peas and Hormel bacon bits instead of cooking bacon but it was fantastic!  Definitely a keeper!  It was SO easy too.  I will make them for the next time I have to take a side dish to any event!

Finally a black eyed peas recipe with celery..This is the way I make them quickly (like for a week night dinner side). The peppers add just the right amount of KICK. Thanks a bunch!!

With the exception of the jalapeno this is the way we have always dressed up our black eyed peas.  You can use fresh, dried, canned or frozen peas and it still taste great.  I always cook my bacon, pour some of the bacon fat from the skillet and saute the celery & onions in the remaining bacon fat.  I then add to the pot of peas that are cooking.  We love it hot and spicy but, since there are still some little ones eating we serve the jalapeno on the side.  Great recipe, thanks!!

I made a double recipe of this for a big party and everyone RAVED about it!! I adjusted for personal taste: more garlic, less tomatoes, added a small can of diced green chilis, some diced red bell pepper, and diced ham. For simplicity, I tossed everything in a crock pot and let it cook for several hours so the flavors would mingle. I served it right in the crock pot. SUPER EASY and delicious! Definitely a recipe to add to our favorites ... Thanks!

I made this today for New Years Day & it is delicious!  I used 4 cans of blackeyed peas, 2 plain & 2 with peppers in them.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  A dollop of sour cream was optional.  I'll make this more than one time a year.

I souped this up, literally. I started with the recipe and "cleaned out the fridge" with these additions:  about a cup of shredded carrots, about 3 to 4 cups of beef broth and maybe a lb of fresh spinach. Also upped the garlic by quite a bit  and instead of salt used 1.5 t. of Creole seasoning. I had a small slice of ham and a single cheddar brat that I chopped and tossed in too.   Very good.

I made this for New Years Day. Went out and ice fished. The guys loved it. A good recipe.  We eat black eyed peas offen. This was a different twist too just peas and ham hocks. Will be a special dish for those game days, and ice fishing party outings.

This was very easy and good - I didn't have bacon, so left that out, but I'm sure it would be good with bacon added, because what isn't?

This was a hit! I stirred in some leftover ham rather than bacon, and I also added a can of sweet corn, which blended the flavors together beautifully.  This will certainly be a regular in our rotation.

I made this for New Years and really enjoyed it.  I also sauteed the veggies first, and have done it the bacon and another time with some chopped leftover ham. Great dish either way!!  Thanks for sharing.

These were okay.  My husband liked them, but I did use onion powder and celery seed hoping others would eat it; otherwise, they would be pretty chunky with all the veggies. They were vinegary, probably from the rotel, but are a good chance of pace.

I made this for our New Year's party.  It was so easy and really tasty! I sauteed the onion, celery and garlic in the bacon fat after cooking the bacon. I could not find jalapeno black eye peas so used three cans of seasoned peas and added 1 1/2 t. chopped jalapenos. I will definately make this again.

This is the best way I have ever had black eyed peas ! I did not use the optional jalapeño instead I used Bush's Black Eyed Peas with Jalapeños and Bacon. I also used 1 full pound of thick sliced bacon. The end result was out of this world! Loved it! From now on this will be the recipe I use for black eyed peas. I have found the best!

Love this receipe.  I altered it only by a couple of changes.  I use 2 cans of black eye peas with snaps and 1 can of black eye peas with jalapeno.  I also use one can of petite diced tomatoes with a small can of diced green chilis instead of the 1 can of Rotel.  I also substitute ham diced into small pieces cooked with the other ingrediants...rather than topping with crumbled bacon.

This was so easy! Everyone raved about how good it was and asked for the recipe, which I printed and gave it to them. 
  With the little bit of leftover that I saved, I chopped up some cooked liver, mixed it with the beans, poured it into a baking dish then put a layer of sliced cheese, covered with mashed potatoes and baked at 350 for 30 mins. It was great.
  Thank you for this make again recipe.

I cook this with fresh or frozen black-eyes in the crock pot. Add cornbread for a one-pot meal. Yum!
