For extra flavor I sauteed the garlic with bacon and chopped onion and unfortunately it still wasn't enough to wake this up.  Its appearance (kind of looks like a sleepy bowl of Cream of Wheat) is a reliable indicator of its taste - blah.  This needs a good shot of seasoning - anything you'd season vegetables with would probably do.

Very good! I added sauteed onions and pureed only half my soup (I like some texture). I also added more nutmeg and some black pepper - and garnished it with bacon, green onion, and chopped basil. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was amazing!  I followed the instructions as written except for the cauliflower.  I only had a frozen bag and that's what I used.  Thank you so much for a wonderful low carb soup!  I have to try this with brocolli now!  :)

I didn't do the ginger thing - I saut√©ed onions, added the cauliflower then boiled. I chucked in some cooked bacon and potatoes. I added chicken stock. I put some Parmesan cheese in the end and it tasted totally amazing but I guess I changed a lot from the original recipe.

This recipe also makes for a great vegetable dip or even a spread, with the right amount of tinkering! Perfect for having your cauliflower and eating it, too!
