I got this recipe off this website about 6 years ago... could it be that long?  I think it was. I never post reviews, but I think that this one deserves a rave review.  As a cake decorator, I've made this cake countless times over the years.  It is dense and rich.  Used it in wedding cakes and it perfect for 3D cakes. It is delicious.  I love the flavor. I usually make this cake without the frosting following the cake recipe exactly. Sometimes, I'll add different flavors: ground almond (about 1/2-3/4 cup) and almond extract instead of vanilla or lemon zest(about 3-4 lemons) with lemon extract.  Tried adding cocoa one time and that didn't come out that great.  It is delicious with a chocolate buttercream frosting.  Give it a try...

This review is for the cake alone, as I made this into cupcakes and used a different frosting.  I found the batter thick and luxurious.  The cake was moist but not all that sweet, so it worked well with the buttercream frosting I topped it with.

The Only change i made to this recipes was that i added 1 more egg.I was really worried about this being an heavy cake from the batter being a bit thicker than most cake batters.But to my Suprise this is a very light and moist cake!I will be making this again.Everyone loved it and i made this cake for a 4th of July Girl Scout picnic useing buttercream icing,decorating it to look like a huge slice of watermelon.None of it was left at the end of the day!THNX MUCH:)

This is a very dense, almost like a pound cake.  It is really good, I don't make it with the frosting, I use a chocolate truffle frostin and it is sooo yummy.  My family loves it.  I used it when I want a rich, dense, buttery cake...

I don't know if I did something wrong because it had such high marks, but my family didn't like this one.  It was really heavy, like a brick.  The frosting was also too much - maybe I beat it too long.  The recipe doesn't indicate how long to beat it.  I was disappointed at the family gathering when we finally cut into this one.

I don't own a bundt pan, so I used a regular 9x13 cake pan for this recipe. I was a little worried it would rise too much for my pan, because I was also following the Oreo cake recipe with this cake (which by the way, I would not recommend). This cake's flavor is fantastic, and can't wait to make it WITHOUT the stupid Oreos & chocolate chips x) Thanks a lot! ~Bae

This is a heavy cake that isn't very sweet. It's great when you're using a sweet frosting, and would make a great brunch style dish.

This cake recipe is great.  After reading the reviews I tried it because I wanted a cake that would hold its shape for and April Fool's Day spaghetti cake.  It was perfect, sturdy but fluffy, moist and rich tasting.  I covered it with a buttercream frosting and strawberry jelly (for the spaghetti sauce) and cocoa-krispy treat meatballs. I can definitely see this cake used as a wedding cake!

This was *very tasty!  However, after using it in a cake decorating class, I'll say basic icing is too overpowering to go with it.  It's delightful on its own.

The sauce was incredible. It really gave the cake its flavor. Without it, I found it to be somewhat bland. What would have given it flavor would have been some diced granny apples in the batter. Next time I will try that.

We loved this cake, particularly because the glaze recipe was very generous and provided lots of gooo for the cake.  It was easy to do, and even my kids loved eating it.

I really wanted to love this cake, but I didn't. Other's in my family loved it. I found it dry and the caramel icing to thick and sweet. I fought a losing battle with the icing it hardend to dang fast.Anyway i'm giving it 3 stars because of my family.

Before choosing to make this cake, I read through some of the reviews...I almost didn't make it!  When I read MishNYC's review, I decide to give it a go!  I was making myself a birthday cake.  We are empty nesters, so I used Allrecipes great feature to scale the recipe back to 4 servings.  I used a 6 inch cake pan.  Yes, the cake isn't overly sweet, but my frosting offset that.  I didn't use the caramel icing in the recipe, but a chocolate buttercream frosting with a raspberry filling in the cake.  It is dense, but very moist and tasty.  Hubby and I both thought it was a great cake and I will make it again.  Thank you S. Helms for posting  your grandma's cake recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  Baked up 24 mini cupcakes and about 14 regular-sized cupcakes.  Great, almost cookie-like flavor.  Love it.

I gave the cake a "good" rating since I found it too dense and not a lot of taste,but the caramel icing is definitely the "BEST".  Just the right consistency for pouring over a bundt cake, makes a nice covering on the cake.  I use this icing on a banana nut cake recipe (instead of making two loaves, it makes one bundt) and the spices, bananas and nuts are fabulous with this caramel icing.  Always get raves!

Made this cake for the first time for a family Christmas luncheon.  Everyone raved about it!  I changed it up a little by adding 1/2 each of Craisins and chopped pecans.  Had to bake a little longer than listed.  It's a hit, everyone wants the recipe!

This cake had a great texture-- fluffy but still firm and moist-- but it had very little flavor.  It would be bland if it weren't for the caramel glaze.  I think it would be a good cake for decorating, but don't be deceived by the butter title--was not rich and butter at all.

decent flavor the the cake is very very dense.  Not going to make this one again for a traditional birthday cake.  I baked it in a bunt pan and covered with a chocolate frosting from this website.  The frosting was good, the cake was not.

Best cake ever with Carmel frosting. Have made it for over ten years. This year my brother-in-law asked for it as his birthday gift. My nephew asked for the recipe so he could lead to make when in school.  It is my families favorite cake. It is requested for celebrations year after year.

I made this cake for work this week.  It got rave reviews!  I substituted half of the vanilla with almond extract.  I did not make the frosting, but frosted it with buttercream frosting instead and had it decorated with a picture of a turkey.  It was a very dense cake, but it made it good for decorating (less crumbs).  I might try using more eggs next time to see if I can get it a bit lighter and fluffier.  But I have to say thank you...I have a request from a co-worker to make a birthday cake for her using this recipe (she doesn't bake.)
