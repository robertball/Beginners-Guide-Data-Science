OMG… THESE WERE INCREDIBLE!! I followed the recipe exactly as written except added an 8 ounce can of plain tomato sauce to the enchilada sauce to increase the amount of the sauce and to “tone down” the spiciness. I also added the juice from the crushed pineapple as well. I dumped the canned pineapple into a colander directly over the saucepan full of sauce. I also simmered for about 30 minutes to reduce the water but retain the flavor. I used whole wheat tortillas and extra sour cream and made about 4 fat enchiladas. I recommend laying the tortillas (like pizzas) on a clean kitchen counter to evenly distribute the filling and to keep the sizes of the enchiladas consistent before rolling them and placing them in a baking dish . They will cook more evenly and the presentation will be nicer. TY Jessie for this recipe and will make regularly.

The best thing about this recipe is how easy it is.  The bad is that for me it was almost overwhelmingly sweet by the end of one piece.  I'm going to try this again, with a little less pineapple, and some chopped green pepper or onion or green chilies added to the filling.

This dish is amazing. Here's what I did: I used the same amounts of crushed pineapple (drained, of course) and enchilada sauce (although I used red chunky taco sauce because my grocery store didn't have enchilada sauce). I did use a cup of sour cream (as others suggested) , added sliced black olives, a can of chicken breast (I shredded it) and a can of diced green chilis. I also used a Monterey Jack and Cheddar blend in leiu of the cheddar. This dish was OUTSTANDING! Perfect for summertime! My bf was VERY skeptical about this but he just finished two enchiladas and was mmmmmmmming the whole time. Thank you!

Very good recipe as is. Second time I made it, I added chunked chicken and white rice to give the filling a little more substance. Good conversation piece for dinner parties. :-)

Yum, yum, yummy!  What an interesting concept!  I too LOVE pineapple on my pizza, so I just had to try this.  I thought at first the crushed pineapple would make them mushy, so I used chunk pineapple (drained first).  Boy oh boy did the chunks get hot in the oven!  Next time, I'll stick with crushed to save my scalded mouth!  I doubled (at least) the sour cream and added some chopped green chiles.  I think next time I'll try it with corn tortillas (personal preference) for an even better flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!! I've made this a few times before and thought it was a little bland, but this time I got it right!! Make sure to squeeze the pineapple to get rid of most of the juice. Add 1-2 tsp. diced jalapenos and a few splashes of hot sauce to the filling mixture. Use hot enchilada sauce instead of mild. It might be beneficial to spray the pan with cooking spray first, mine stuck to the bottom. Serve with a side of sour cream. Very delicious!!!

I LOVED this!  I am a very big fan of pineapple (especially when its in places you don't expect it)  This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I increased the amount of sour cream and used pineapple tidbits.  The only other change I would recommend is removing the cover during the last 10 minutes or so of cooking so that the cheese browns up.

WOWZERS!!!  These were suprisingly delicious!  I added some roasted red peppers, red onion, and a little bit of chopped jalapeno.  It was a great marriage of sweet and spicy flavors.  We just loved these and will make them again and again!  Thanks!!!

I wish I had read the reviews before making this as the pineapple definitely needs to be drained.  While I enjoyed these very much, some additional sour cream and green chiles would have made these even better.

This recipie needs 2x as much sour cream and a bit more enchilada sauce, but is very easy and very delicious.  You can even add cooked chicken to make this.

I added one large shredded chicken breast , some heat, and more sour cream-and this came out the best Mexican disk I have tasted. I did season the chicken to taste before adding it to the filling.

AWESOME!!! I love pineapples and this was to die for! I did add green chilis, black olives, onions and some jalapenos to give it some kick. All those flavors with the sweet pineapples mixed so well. Added more cheese and more sour cream than it called for. It just wasn't enough sour cream for my taste. And I let the pineapple mixture marinate over night...might be the best thing I have ever had! Love this recipe! Thanks for sharing!!

These are so yummy and quick to make! I've made this about 5 times now, and I have found that adding a bit of cinnamon, chile powder, and a pinch of suger really brings out the flavor of the pinneaple. The cinnamon sounds weird, but it's really good.

We like this recipe at our house. I did modify it a little bit, I make it with half a can of pineapple and threw in a can of black beans, and a can of corn.

Awesome dish!  Even my mom loves it and she hates a good chunk of stuff that I attempt to cook.  It's easy dish to prepare and finishes in a snap.  I did learn, however, that crushed is the way to go.  Chunky is not good at all.  I mix my dish with both green and red enchilada sauce. One time we even added chicken, which was also very yummy.

Like others suggested, I used 1 cup of sour cream and I added a can of diced green chilis for extra flavor.  I drained the pineapple and and I used a mix of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese, which gave it a nice flavor.  I used corn tortillas and I fried them lightly in oil for 1 second and drained on paper towels, and then dipped them in the sauce.  I uncovered it during the last 10 minutes of baking and this worked out great.  We really enjoyed this dish!

These are absolutely delicious, a tasty balance between the sweet pineapple & the tart enchilada sauce!  I like adding some tofu for extra protein & using cubed pineapple (I rinse the pineapple chunks thoroughly before mixing it in the batter).  :)

I increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  I used 1 c. of a Mexican cheese mixture in the pineapple/sour cream mix which added a kick.  I planned to follow AGENTLUCY's recommendations until I realized that I had a 15 oz. not 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce.  However, I still added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to the sauce and cooked it on the stove.  I loved the hint of pineapple to the sauce.  I ended up with 4 fat enchiladas as well.  Before covering with the dish with foil, I sprayed the foil so the cheese wouldn't stick (I also sprayed the dish before adding the sauce too.)  In the end, I broiled the enchilada for a few minutes to brown the cheese.  If you like plain cheese enchiladas, you will like this recipe however, if you prefer a hearty enchilada you should add chicken or rice to the mixture.  WILL DEFINIETLY MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN!

I have been meaning to try this recipe for quite some time now. I added a shredded chicken breast to the pineapple mixture.  I like my food with a bit of spice, so I added one red chili.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Yummy!  Easy to make!

I just had to try this recipe because the combination in the name struck me as so weird. I hate to cook and am terrible at it, and use this website to find recipes that are quick and easy. This was about as easy as it gets, and the results are fabulous! I followed the advice of others -- used more enchilada sauce, used chopped green chiles, doubled the sour cream, and I also used 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. The combo of sweet and spicy is really good. Thanks for sharing it!

Definately not what I thought they were going to be. We love pineapple on our pizza but this gave an entirely different flavor. Won't be making these again.

Oh my gosh, was amazing!  My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever cooked.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, just because I don't like sour cream.  And I ended up needing a second can of enchilada sauce.

Wow! I'm going to make this all the time! I've never found a better vegetarian enchilada recipe! The straight cheese ones are always too soft and mushy. I added just a little ready-to-serve rice to the mix since I wanted to get rid of it, but the mix would be fine without it! Thank-you so much for this recipe!

Very easy to make. I was done making them before the oven was pre-heated. Wonderful flavor. Next time I will try green chili enchilada sauce because I like the contrast of sweet and spicy.
--Not good w/ green chili. I'll stick with the red. You were right. Thanks.

These were really good. You have to drain the pineapple though! I added a package of bacon crumbles and some chopped adobado chilies to give the enchiladas a nice smokey flavor and some kick. Without it they can be a little bland They turned out wonderful.

Pineapple is not my favorite, but this was about the best thing that I have eaten in a long time.  I have made it the past two weekends.  The combination of pineapple with the cheese, sour cream and enchilada sauce is superb.  Absolutely awesome!

These were excellent!!  I didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used a cup of colby and a cup of pepper jack so I didn't need the green chilies others had suggested it the reviews.  I also used a 19 oz. can of enchilada sauce and more sour cream than the recipe called for.   Thanks for sharing this one!!

great recipe - very easy, me and my (very fussy) husband loved it. I upped the amount of sour cream and added tomato sauce to the enchilada sauce to suit our taste but i am happy to add this to my midweek (read quick & tasty) recipe list.

Not really for my kids (both under 2 and very fussy) but i could see doing a non-spicy version for them with only plain tomato sauice & without the enchilada sauce when they get older.

I used both corn and flour tortillas when I made this recipe (separately).  I thought the corn tortillas gave it much more flavor but my husband like the flour ones better.
He was not at all sure he wanted to try this recipe but he ended up liking it even though he's not a huge pineapple fan.  I really enjoyed it!

I gave this a 5 becuase my husband said they were excellant and he has never said that about any meal.  Out of five people 2 loved them and I thought they were ok and the two younger kids didn't like them.  So I think this is a dish for the older crowd, lol.  I will deffiantly make again for my husband.

Have made this wonderful recipe a couple times now and love it! A slight variation I made to give the enchiladas a little more substance...I added a chopped onion and a chopped green pepper to the filling mix and adjusted the amounts of the sour cream slightly to accomodate. Whole family LOVES these and begs me to make them more often. Even my mother, who typically doesn't eat mexican, asked me for the recipe after trying them at my house. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Very good.  I made 4 10" enchiladas, using the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from this site (it's excellent and made more than I needed).  I upped the sour cream to about 1/2 cup, and used tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  2 enchiladas were VERY filling, and while I liked the pineapple, I think I would add a can of black beans, or perhaps replace all the pineapple with black beans (probably 2 cans) and try again.

This is one of the first recipes I tried from Allrecipes.com several years ago. And when I remember to check my recipe box I have this AHA moment and know what to make. It's not an everyday menu item at our house but it is a welcome change when I remember to include it on Mexican Food Nights. What a fun little twist that even my pickiest eater enjoys.

As advised somewhere, I added chopped onions and green peppers to the filling, just to add some vegetables.  The leftovers froze really well, and I think they actually taste better after letting the flavors mix a bit.  The toaster oven is perfect for re-warming, since it keeps things a little bit crispy.  Oh, and I have a co-worker who raves about how good they look and smell whenever I bring leftovers for lunch!

I really thought I would like these and wanted to, but I was disappointed.  They seemed bland and lacked depth of flavor.  Not bad, but just not great.  I won't make these again.

Pineapple Enchiladas sounded really weird but my husband and I were feeling brave so we tried it and it is wonderful!!!  I would have never thought about putting pineapple in an enchilada.  I tried half of them with jalapeons and those were the better half.  I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  They did seem like they needed something else.  My husband suggested slices of ham so we will try that next time.

The concept was good, but i didn't like the way the enchilada sauce tasted with the filling. I'll try it again with just a tomato sauce.

These were awesome! We are vegan, so I used soy cheese and non-dairy sour cream and they turned out great. My three older kids were not as impressed although my 11 month old baby gobbled them up! A nice change from the usual bean burritos. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was surprisingly good!  I made these for dinner last night, and my boyfriend ate 2!  I brought some leftovers to work and divided them up among my coworkers, they all thought they were great!  One lady even asked for the recipe, which I've just printed up.

Thanks for the recipe!  These are wonderful!

This was pretty good, definitely different.  I followed some suggestions like increasing to 3/4c sour cream, upping enchilada sauce.  For it, I added a half cup of the drained pineapple juice.  It was good, but too sweet.  If I make again, I'd add a only quarter cup more.  I had chunks so cut them tidbit size.  I added 2T salsa verde & 1/16t cinnamon to the filling.  I'd add that or 1/8t to the sauce next time - 'think it'll help the sweetness.  Also will put a cup & a half cheese in & only half cup on; & more salsa verde or some other spiciness.  My tortillas were kind of stiff - storebrand - & they ended up more like thick, heavy noodles; not identifiable as a tortilla (not good or bad, just different).

My 4 yr old Granddaughter and I LOVE Pineapple and Ham on pizza, so I decided to make this more like a "Hawaiian Calzone" using Tortilla's instead of Pizza Dough.  I added Ricotta cheese, Ham diced into small pieces, Pineapple Tidbits (drained), a very small amount of mild peppers, & black olives plus Provolone and Mozzarella  cheese that was shredded to the filling.  I used mild green chile enchilada sauce also on the bottom under the enchiladas and over them along with shredded Mexican blend cheese,  We Loved them, as did my son and daughter-in-law and my husband.

This was good! I made some changes though. I used 1 cup of sour cream, I added 1 diced green pepper, a can of black beans, half a bottle of Newman's Own pineapple salsa, and a liberal amount of hot sauce. So delicious!

Yum! I used Greek Plain yogurt in place of sour cream. I tried both green and red enchilada sauce, and like it best with red.

I really thought that these would be good, after reading all the great reviews.  I did one pan and followed the recipe exact, then another pan with the chicken and green chilis. I didnt care for either one. I made them at a potlock of 40 people and not one person thought they were really that great! Next time I will be makin good ol fashion enchiladas!

These were a hit! They're very easy and a great way to have Mexican at home without being to heavy. We have them at least 2x a month now. :)

Super easy to make. I used pineapple "tidbits" instead of "crushed". Super yummy.

This recipe is great. I think the whole can of pineapple is a bit much, but I guess that depends on your taste. I added one can of black beans to the stuffing and put black olives and jalapenos on top a the picure shows. I will definitely make these again. My family loved them, but I'll add a little less pineapple next time!

Seemed like a great idea, but this turned out very bitter for us.  We used fresh pineapple and someone else commented that they had the same bitter issue when using fresh.  I'm not sure what it was, but we couldn't even finish our dinner which is unheard of!

This is an excellent, simple recipe.  I used a high-quality white cheddar cheese and you could tell the good cheese really made this recipe stand out.  I think I might add some chopped ham next time I make it - kind of like a Hawaiian pizza.

I loved the idea behind these. They tasted good, but they needed a little more spice to them (and I don't like things too spicy). I will probably make these again, but next time I might add something to spice the filling up a bit. Update...I made this again and added a bit of Red Hot to the filling. It gave it just the kick it needed.

WOW! The kids thought I was crazy when I told them we we're having Pineaple Enchiladas for dinner. The flavors of the enchilada sauce and pineapple together is wonderful. Based on other reviews I did add chicken and diced green chile. It turned out great and we all loved it.

This is a very kid-friendly meal, but adults will love it too! I actually added some tomato sauce to the enchilada sauce to cut down the spice, as another viewer had suggested. I also added a package of frozen spinach (thawed and drained) and used twice as much sour cream. It was fantastic! Next time I will make double, so I can freeze it. Thanks for sharing!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this. I made a lot of changes however. I added chicken and about 3/4 cups of sour cream (I really like sour cream). I also used white cheddar cheese instead of regular. Someone suggested using rice, and I also think that would make a wonderful addition. I will be making this again!

I mixed in rice with the pineapple, and omitted the sour cream, but we just did not like the flavor combination.

Alright, I actually enjoyed these! I love pineapple in food, but i am still not sure how i feel about spicy pineapple.  Though, I found with all the cheese I added (I added extra.) it was quite filling. I also added a mexican blend cheese in addition to the cheddar. 

The only problem I had with it was that I did use hot enchilada sauce, and it was a little too spicy for me.  

Otherwise, as long as your enchiladas are even, the presentation is very nice!

I made this almost as written.  I excluded the enchilada sauce and used cream of chicken soup as a replacement. I also added 1 can of chicken breast and increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup to compensate.  I broiled the enchiladas at the very end.  It was a nice change and most of my family loved it!

I used a fresh pineapple instead of canned. I also added bell peppers, onions, Monterey Jack and shredded chicken to the original recipe. To my surprise it was not as good as I thought it would be. The pineapple left a bad after taste, and there was not enough cheese. If I made this dish again I would use less pineapple and a lot more cheese.

I made these as a "dish appetizer" for Easter, because I enjoy freaking out my family members  who only stick to the very basics and are simple flavor eaters only. I knew it would be good...and it was, and  they liked it very much too! This  is how I get them to try new things  and they are always so shocked when they like it lol. Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't like it. The tortillas got goopy on the bottom and just in general there wasn't much flavor.

These were odd, but surprisingly good. I added some chopped green onion to the filling, and added the juice from the pineapple and about a teaspoon of cumin to the can of enchilada sauce. I think it would be even better with the addition of something else in the filling - either some peppers and onions or some chicken - to give them a little more body.

This recipe worked exactly as it should have.  My favorite enchiladas are made with cottage cheese and cheddar cheese, so this did not seem like much of a stretch.  I made this with my own homemade enchilada sauce.  The pineapple in the enchiladas was a terrible addition to Mexican food.  A pan of enchiladas is usually eaten up in two days in my house.  These lasted over a week and I personally never ate them after the first time.

My family enjoyed this tasty meal!  It's a great starter that can easily be added to.  The only variations I made for my first attempt were sliced olives to the pineapple/sour cream mix and to top them off, as well as a bit more sour cream to the mix.

You could very easily add ground sausage, burger, or different veggies and end up with an even tastier meal.

Delicious. Doubled the sour cream, added a can of olives (sliced) and a half cup of chopped jalapenos. I added hot salsa to the enchilada mix since my selected variety comes in an 8oz bag. Also used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.

These were delish.  I followed other reviews and used 1 C sour cream, although in my opinion that was too much.  Next time I will try 3/4 C.  I also added a chopped green pepper which was great, and a some sliced black olives on top.  Will def make again!  Thank you for this idea.

Not bad -- I think I appreciated it more than my husband did, who is not as much a fan of fruit in savory dishes as I am, but he still liked it well enough.  I added shredded chicken breast to the filling, upped the sour cream to about a cup, used corn tortillas instead of flour, and rather than using enchilada sauce (which is hard to find and hardly worth it), I added 8 oz. tomato sauce to about 12 oz. of salsa.  If I made it again, I think I would use half the pineapple and maybe add some sautéed onions and green peppers, so it won't be quite so overwhelmingly "fruity".

This is one of my husband's all-time favorites now!  I add chicken, green chili peppers or jalapeños, and extra sour cream in the filling.  I make my grandmother's homemade enchilada sauce (homemade makes ALL the difference here, to me!  SOOOO much better than the canned stuff!) and add the pineapple juice to it and simmer it down, like another reviewer suggested.  Both my husband's mom and my dad who were in town said "they taste great!  But I can't taste the pineapple..."  I don't get that, because we taste the pineapple just fine! :)  Thanks for a great and different recipe!!

These were delicious. A little sloppy to make and not the most aesthetically pleasing but were very tasty and I will definitely do again. They froze well with a side of rice and refried beans and made for great leftovers.

Excellent recipe! I added a 1/4 cup of chopped red onion to the mix and used only an 8oz can of crushed pineapple (that was all I had). I used the other filling amounts as noted in the recipe...it filled 4 tortillas. I also poured a 10 ounce can of Mexican-style diced tomatoes over the top of them along with the enchilada sauce. Yum! Will definitely make again.

I basically created my own recipe after reading this one and the other reviews.  I cooked a few pieces of boneless skinless chicken (diced), made a couple servings of white rice, added a bit of red onion and needed an extra can of the red enchilada sauce and extra cheese.  I also didn't use the sour cream.  With my filling mixture being more than the original recipe I ended up with double the amount the recipe said and everyone loved it!

I created this as written and my family absolutely loved it. I thought it could use ... something ... but can't quite figure out what. It was good and I will make it again but not until i figure out that "something" to add. We enjoyed this dish with Spanish Rice from this site as well.

this is good recipe but i don't really say that pineapple and the sauce was a good combination.I tried it though and saved in my recipe box.The best thing was, it gave me an idea how to prepare other enchilada recipe.

I used Old ElPaso enchilada sauce, I don't know if that was the problem or not, but this was so horrible I couldn't eat it.  I felt the texture was disgusting.   Sorry!   I love pineapple on pizza but this didn't come close at all.

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe again the way it was originally listed. When I made it I added chicken and canned green chilies.  When I tried the mixture, I thought it tasted overly sweet, so I added cumin and cilantro as well.  When we ate the enchiladas, it turns out that I completely killed the taste of the pineapple and they tasted like my regular chicken echilada recipe! On the brightside, I found these to be less filling! Can't wait to give it another try!

Agree with those who added some chili powder to spice it up.  Also added extra green enchilada sauce with some chili verde sauce, and some shredded chicken.  It's a hit!

Wow! So good. Didn't sound like it would be that great, but it sure was.   I'm always amused when people say they prepared it exactly according to the recipe, but then proceed to list MANY things they did to change it, add to it, etc.  Well, I'm guilty of that, but to a lesser degree. I drained the can of pineapple a bit. And just added to the filling a few cut up Trappey jalapenos (about 6-7 slices) and a little bit of leftover diced cooked chicken(about a 1/4 of a chicken breast).   I can assure you though, if you follow the recipe exactly, you'll love this dish.

I love pineapple so I was very excited about this recipe.  It was good, just a little too mushy and gooey for me.  I couldn't get past the texture of the food - the taste though wasn't bad.  Not sure I would make it again though unless I tweaked it a little.  Also, spray the bottom of the pan or add more sauce as mine ended up sticking badly.

as i often do, i just used this as a template.  i divided the sour cream with cream cheese and substituted jalapeno havarti for the cheddar, tomatillo salsa for the enchilada sauce, and mangos (two large) for the pineapple.  they were pretty good, but i'll try the original recipe next time as it sounds good too.

I would definately say that this is a good recipe to try out. We added a pound and a half of chicken breast to double the recipe. You won't be disapointed.

I had to change this recipe and add meat for my boyfriend who refuses to eat anything 'vegetarian'. I added some sliced cabonossi along with half a diced onion and some sliced mushrooms. I only added a small handful of cheese to the filling mixture and a small sprinkling on top (to reduce the fat content). A very easy & satisfying meal!
