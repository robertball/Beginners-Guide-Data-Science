This is true to the Lebanese recipe...and yes, you DO have to love lemon to love this, as is!  I make this slightly differently.  I boil the lentils first and sautee the onions in a separate pan, adding them to the pot once the lentils are near finished.  Then, I add the salt, some pepper and the spinach and simmer at medium-low heat until the flavours blend.  I personally don't use dried mint in this recipe.  My husband would find the original version to be too be "lemony" also, so we only add a small amount to the pot, then add lemon to individual servings, as preferred.  Just a thought for an alternate version:  you can substitute Swiss Chard for the spinach.  My family is split down the middle as to which of these tastes better.

This soup is delicious. The only changes I made were that I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and I added some beef stock to the soup. I loved the flavor of the lemon juice. I will definitely be making this again.

A fabulous and easy soup ... not to mention that its totally nutritious.  Took all of 15 minutes to put together & 35 to low-boil/simmer, covered to save the broth from evaporating.  Lentils are amazing little suckers ... peppery, almost smoky, they carry the simplicity of this soup almost on their own.  For those that say it was missing taste, try this: Instead of using plain water as a base, start with about 4 cups vegetable broth (or even 3-4 boullion cubes & 4 cups water).  Secondly, I had the time to use chopped fresh spinach, and also used fresh lemon juice ... nice touch (certainly wasn't too lemony for a full pot of soup!).  Lastly, don't hesitate to season with some Kosher salt (the chunky stuff ... the best for cooking!), and plenty of freshly ground pepper.   Bottom line: never use plain water as a soup base ... get some broth, or at least some boullion.  You may even try cooking the lentils separately as another reviewer noted, and adjust the broth level as you cook.

It was delicious as written.  For those who find it bland, add a generous amount of salt and let it sit for an hour while the flavors blend a bit.  After adding the salt and lemon juice, I turned off the heat and covered the pan.  When it was done I had an amazingly flavorful soup.

i couldn't wait to try this recipe on my husband who happens to be Lebanese.  I browned a whole large onion,we love onions, added fresh spinach and fresh lemon.  at first the lemon over powered the soup but after adding more water it was perfect  !

This recipe is just ok. It is very unattractive during cooking which worried me. When the lentils expanded it looked much better. To me the soup is plain and lacking. Everyone that tried it was just OK. You really have to love lemon juice to like this.

This was wonderful!  I need to lower my cholesterol and my dad his salt intake.  This soup is the perfect way to do both and the lemon taste is just perfect.  It freezes beautifully.  I have even had it for breakfast!  Because it is low in calories and high in nutrition it is great for someone trying to lose weight too.

I'm lebanese, and this soup is very popular in my country. Like all receipies it has several variants. Like a variant we use crushed dried corriander instead of crushed dried mint, chopped chard instead of spinach and the crushed garlic with the lemon . Give it a try it's really yummy!!

Best lentil soup recipe I've tried!!  The lemon actually cut down on the amount of salt I used, which is good.  My 4 year old loved it.  And it costs about $4 a potful : )

Like this recipe. I make a couple of changes. I begin with chicken broth (from a box), saute the onion and garlic separately then add them to the simmering lentils. I use fresh spinach or chard. I cut it up and put it in the soup bowl and pour the hot soup over it as I like fresh greens just barely cooked. I also add more seasoning--garlic powder, seasoned salt, cumin, pepper, a little cayenne. Love the lemony taste, gives it a nice tang.

It was good but flat. If I make it again, I will use more lemon and olive oil and use a hand blender to give it some body.

I absolutely love this recipe ! I will admit I altered it just a little, I didn't use the fresh mint I did use fresh ginger instead. I also allowed the garlic, ginger, and onions to cook together so to really pick up the flavor prior to me adding the water. I used fresh spinach also, and Kosher Sea Salt at first but opted to using a teaspoon of table salt which did the trick! The lemon juice just made the whole soup complete!  Oh and i also sliced up some avocado for garnish :)

This is delicious and very easy to cook-- I made it earlier this week and have been enjoying the leftovers over the past few days.  My husband loves it, too.  As it sits, the flavors just get better.  This is going to become part of our regular meal rotation.

I really like this soup, especially after the flavors blend for a day.  The taste is different--somewhat reminiscent of stuffed grape leaves.  I have frozen it in individual servings with fine results.  You can't get much healthier or cheaper!

This soup was  good as following the instructions, except I didn't use so much lemon.  I cut it back by half.  I think next time I will use my emulsifier and make crushed lentil soup.

It’s a homey, simple soup.  I made it with vegetable stock, went easy on the lemon, and topped it with some sour cream and cilantro.  Delicious and soothing.  I’m new to lentils and this is a perfect, clear, staple soup.

I made this as written, except I used fresh spinach. I also just made half a recipe. It just wasn’t flavorful enough for me, even with the lemon. If I try it again, I’d use more mint, perhaps fresh instead of dry.

Easy and fast dinner, recommend some homemade bread with it.  Only used 1/2 the recipe lemon juice-will use the full amount next time.

This is delicious.  I did change a few things though.  I added vegetable broth instead of water and used dinosaur kale instead of spinach.  The lemon really rounds it out.  A very nice recipe that I will definitely be making again.

I love lemon, so I thought I would really like this; unfortunately, neither my husband nor I liked it at all.  It was way too lemony,  and except for that, completely bland tasting.  Somehow, the combo of ingredients just didn't meld together to make a good-tasting soup.  I made half a recipe; we each had a bowlful for lunch, and the rest went down the disposal.

Nice soup. I burned the onions to the pot :(   Next time I'll cook the onions in a separate pan. I used 1/2 vegetable stock and 1/2 water. Mostly lemon juice, but also one fresh squeezed lemon.  I used 1/2 frozen and half fresh chopped spinach. I think I would just go all frozen next time to make it easier. I think I'll also leave the lid on next time to save the broth from evaporating, and maybe add more broth/water. Don't forget to rinse your lentils.

GREAT!  I finally found a reliable lentil soup!  I did add an extra tablespoon of dried mint and only 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice.  It is a great base to add other spices if you want or just enjoy as it is!  THANK YOU!

This was ok the first night but DH wouldn't eat the leftovers, preferring to eat basically anything else in the fridge, which is extremely unusual for him. Can't give it more than 3 stars :( We much prefer the "Lentil Soup with Lemon" recipe on here that has you blend the lentils up. Thanks for sharing though!

It smelled GREAT, but tasted a bit bland.  I think it might be better cooked in chicken stock.  We added some parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar to it, which was pretty good but probably not authentic.  :-)

When I first made this soup I didn't really like it on the first try. It was pretty bland. After letting it sit for a day and let all the flavors blend together I really liked it. But this is a very basic, rustic, super healthy and vegan soup so keep that in mind. Very very easy to make and cheap too! Definitely use vegetable stock instead of water, make sure to add salt and use fresh lemon juice and fresh spinach. Serve with warm pita bread and it's quite delicious :)

This is a delicious and easy-to-make dish! I followed the tips that other reviewers gave and replaced the water with vegetable stock and used fresh spinach and fresh lemon juice. I put the left overs in the fridge and had it cold the next day, which was very nice as well.  Makes it a very nice summer dish!

Not enough flavor.  The lemon water just wasn't a strong enough base for me.

Great recipe.   I used a mixture of Vegetable broth/water and also used only 1/2 Tablespoon of dried mint.  Sea salt and pepper to taste.   Gave the kids some without the lemon juice and then added the lemon juice for my husband and me. Everyone enjoyed it.
