This was THE BEST corned beef and cabbage that I have ever made.  I never had used a recipe before, let alone added carrots.  Anyhow, I used a 4 lb. brisket that I trimmed of most visible fat without sacrificing the integrity of the meat.  Also rinsed the meat well (couldn't bear to use that bloody junk that was packaged with it) before putting it into an 11 qt. stockpot with the spices that were packaged with it.  Added 1 can Miller Lite beer, water to cover, 3 large cloves of minced garlic, and about 12 whole black peppers.  About 1 hour before the beef was supposed to be done, I added the potatoes, carrots, and 2 small turnips, chopped.  Forty minutes later I added the green cabbage wedges and 1 large onion, cut into wedges.  Twenty minutes later all was done and it was DELICIOUS.  [P.S. I served this with a horseradish sauce--mix together 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup white prepared horseradish (or to taste), 1 Tbs. dried chives, and the juice from 1/2 lemon.  This is very good with the corned beef.]

I take the corned beef out  and while the cabbage carrots and pot's are cooking in the liquid, I put the brisket in the oven for 30 minutes with this sauce that I combine on the stove until smooth. 1/3 cup of brown sugar,2 tblsp of butter tlbs. of prepared mustard, 1/3 cup of ketchup, and 3 tblsp of apple cider vinegar. I combine these ingredients till smooth, then pour over the brisket while the veggies are cooking. 30 to 40 mins. at 350 will do it.
Hope you like it, all of my friends who hate corned beef will only eat mine!

I love corned beef & cabbage & I must have used close to a hundred recipes, but I think this is the simplest & the best.  Use the white (not russet) potatoes.  I sometimes wondered why my previous renditions sometimes came out on the salty side--this recipe is well-balanced in flavor. Now I know that a '10/5' potato/carrot combo really works...if you skimp on the veggies, the dish will be salty. Using 10/5 gives it a good seasoning balance.

The recipe as written will work very well. I've been doing it that way for many years, except I cook the veggies separately in some of the broth.  However, I thought I would try the crockpot method suggested by several reviewers.I also tried the new Reynolds crockpot liners. they work great! No clean up except the lid. I have a new Rival 5 quart slow cooker with removable stoneware crock. I had a 3.5 lb corned beef brisket(too fatty)and followed the Rival instructions which called for 1 cup of water, onions and cabbage only. I added 6 small potatoes and 3 carrots, cut in half. In 8 hours everything was overcooked, including the veggies! I could see the broth boiling around the inside of the crockpot, so I assume it gets too high when set on low.  It's best omit all liquid as it is not needed when cooking roasts in the crockpot. Cooking the corned beef in the old fashioned way is the best. Skip the crockpot!

This recipe is very basic and with a few changes I loved it.  Try covering the corn beef with four cans of beef broth and include the spice packet after cutting the big fat off. Bring to a boil and turn to low to simmer 2-21/2 hrs. Then add potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic, mushrooms and cabbage for the last hour. Make sure the meat is cooked first by poking the meat before adding vegetables and use a large pot on top of the stove!  I didn't mean to rewrite the recipe, but this is much more tasty way the prepare the corn beef!!!!  Don't forget the french bread says my husband and he is right!!!

I cook the cabbage at the end. Cut it in wedges and cooked seperately from the meat. I use 1/2 cooking liquid from the meat and 1/2 chicken broth with butter added to the liquid. Cooked until just crisp tender. Gives the cabbage a lovely flavor, it stays green and doesn't get all mushy.

Absolutely delicious.  I started out by cooking this on the stove top as the recipe states (for about 45 minutes) but due to a family emergency, I had to leave the house.  Before leaving, I put the meat and liquid into my crock pot.  By the time I got home, the meat was perfectly cooked (45 minutes on stove, then 7 hours in crock pot for an almost 3 lb. roast).  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/2 stick of butter to the liquid as the meat cooked and I also used beef broth instead of water.  The next day on the stovetop I cooked the cabbage, carrots and potatoes in the liquid the meat cooked in the night before.  When the vegetalbes were done, I added the meat back into the liquid just to warm it.  It was SOOOOOO good!!  I will definitely make this again!!

Fantastic! I have always kind of "winged" it with corned beef and cabbage, with varying degrees of success. I read many of the reviews and added a bottle of beer to the water to  simmer the meat in. WOW! This is it! From now on, no more winging it! For spices, I used the packet seasonings, some minced garlic. Added unpeeled red potatoes, onion slices, baby carrots and of course cabbage wedges.

This recipe is very good as written and is very easy to make. I always like to read the reviews and make the recipe the original way and then again and tweek to reviews as needed, I like helpful constructive reviews. The only frustrating thing is when people change the whole recipe. They should send in their own. Tracey did not even comment on this recipe,(not sure if she tried it) put hers in the reviews and said her family will only eat hers. That is great but I feel it is a disrespectful to the persons recipe. Please send in slight changes to help us, do not rewrite. Thank you

this is my first time making corned beef and cabbage, and my fiance and i thought it was terrfic, the meat was very tender and juicy while the vegetables was absolutley superb & tasty. The corned beef was 3.75 lbs that came along with the spice packet, instead of water i used beef broth,  added 6 large cloves of garlic, 1 large white onion cut up into wedges, 2 bay leaves, 12 whole peppercorns, 10 small red potatoes/carrots, 3 tbls of butter to bring out the richness of taste ... all in a crockpot -- it took me 8 hours to cook this dinner and it was worth every minute of it.

As I am of Irish ancestry, I always boil the corned beef! I would strongly suggest, however, that, before adding the spice packet, you first bring the meat to a boil and skim the foamy stuff off the top of the water...then add the spices and simmer. Sometimes I forget and what a mess I make!

I did not have to cook this recipe, this is the same as my grandpa always made it.  To the people out the writing reviews adding beef broth and what not . . THIS IS NOT BEEF STEW! IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE IT. If you change the recipe then you are making something else.   This is exactly how you make Irish corned beef and cabbage. If you change it, then you are making something else.

This will be the fouth time using this recipe and it is simple and yummy. The minor changes I do is cut up the potatoes and use small carrots that I don't have to cut or peel. I don't understand why the most helpful review on here does not follow this recipe at ALL! Please post your own recipe and let people review it. I find it NOT helpful to me when reading reviews. If you add Beef broth, brown sugar, mushrooms, onions, even beer. I can understand one or two changes but all that is something different then Corned beef and cabbage.

Thanks again for a wonderful recipe but thanks also to all who write these great reviews.  It is so nice to read what cooks think of the dish they make.   Yesterday I made this Corned Beef & Cabbage & in my 45 years married to wonderful Irish husband he tells his Italian wife that it was the best yet.  WOW! What is funny to me about Allrecipes.com is that now whenever I come up with a new dish, friends or family will say:  Allrecipe.com??  They know me by now.  The reviews helped so much on these recipes.  The problem I had with this is that there were no spice packets in the pkg. so I just did my own thing…4 garlic cloves, crushed, pepper corns, mustard corns, 2 bay leaves, pepper, dry mustard & the only change I made was adding bottle of beer.  When the beef was done I put it in a dish, covered with foil.  Then cooked my veggies in those wonderful juices till not quite done.  When they were done I put them in a dish with broth, covered with foil & put in a warm oven till I was ready to serve.  Sliced my cooled down beef, put in a 13 X 9 dish covered with foil put in oven till ready to serve.  I did make the Horseradish sauce and it was very good as well, but I found that it was cold next to the nice hot corned beef.  I’m sticking to Grey Poupon….Also a little sprinkle of white vinegar on cabbage is great.  Also helps with any problem that may occur after!! ? Outstanding!!  Wow…great recipe.  Thanks Laria and thank you all with the great reviews.  Nana  Happy St. Patrick’s D

I also add quartered onions. Save the juice & "scrappies" in the pot, and add a bag of dried navy beans the next day. The beans slightly thicken the juice and it makes a very tasty bean soup !!

Straightforward recipe that turned out a tasty boiled dinner. The only thing I'd do differently next time is skim the top once it boils the first time and then add the spices.

I've been doing it this way for over 30 years. In the last half hour I'll pull the brisket from the pot, put it in a roaster and cover it with 1/4 cup of brown sugar and place covered in the oven with just a small amt of juice in the bottom. The brown sugar will melt and create a wonderful glaze for the corned beef. While the beef is in the oven I'll use the liquid in the pot for the veges and then I'll also add a layer of dumplings to the top after the veges begin to boil. Luv it so much that I do it more than just Patty's Day

I executed the recipe as is (can't truly rate it otherwise can you?) and was thoroughly pleased with the results.  Timing is very subjective of course, depending on the the kind of pot you use (enamelled iron, steel...), your stovetop (gas, electric, halogen...) or oven (regular, convection...), but the times given in the original recipe are a very good gauge - just remember that tenderness is what you aim for. My only addition was a generous swirl of sweet butter in the strained broth before serving; it adds a lovely richness to the sauce.  Eight thumbs up (there were four of us)!

The perfect simple Corned Beef recipe. There's plenty of ways to prepare this meat, but if you want simple and delicious just follow along and you won't be disappointed. 

I am usually a recipe "modder" I seem to always be adjusting quantities and adding things. However lately I have been just trying recipes as they are written to find out how the author likes it. This one was fantastic! I was very skeptical of the simplicity, but wow it just was great!

Thanks alot!

This is the way it's done.  We always told my mother to make extra veggie's because we knew what was coming the next day and that was the best part.  The next day was cold sliced corned beef and my mother's vegetable fry.  She would chop up all the leftover potatoes,carrots and cabbage and fry up in a well seasoned iron skillet.. what she used as base, butter I think, she would let cook until it got crispy, then turn and do again. To this day, I can not duplicate but keep trying. Try it you will love it.  A medley of flavor..

Great recipe. added tracey hint: I take the corned beef out and while the cabbage carrots and pot's are cooking in the liquid, I put the brisket in the oven for 30 minutes with this sauce that I combine on the stove until smooth. 1/3 cup of brown sugar,2 tblsp of butter tlbs. of prepared mustard, 1/3 cup of ketchup, and 3 tblsp of apple cider vinegar. I combine these ingredients till smooth, then pour over the brisket while the veggies are cooking. 30 to 40 mins. at 350 will do it. Hope you like it, all of my friends who hate corned beef will only eat mine!

Lovely people, 

This recipe is wonderful written 'as is' - but I'd like to speak to those of you who are aggravated about people changing up the recipe and then rating it, since 'changing it up' really doesn't give you an accurate review of the recipe as written.  

I have this to offer:  Some of us use what's on-hand rather than going out and buying ingredients specific to the recipe.  I find this very helpful on occasion because 1) you might not have to go shopping if you use the substitutes or 2) you can learn a different way to use a spice or other ingredient - which only makes you a better cook.

Also - I've found a few recipe reviewers who have taken allergies into consideration.  Sometimes those 'change ups' can be invaluable and save time when you don't have to scour the Internet trying to find a way to omit a certain ingredient but still get the full effect of the dish.  

I, too, am sometimes frustrated with the review system - but if you try to understand where the reviewer is coming from, sometimes you can make a 'just okay' dish into something completely out of your original realm of thinking.  Tolerance, folks ... just by the mere fact that people take the time to review dishes, even if they do change them a bit, shows they care enough to share their information with you.  Happy cooking!

I add one more step (delicious) after you remove the corned beef from the liquid, brush the top with regular prepared mustard and then add a thin layer of  light brown suger on top of the mustard, put into a 350 oven for about 30 min.

I fixed this 4 times in March.  I do believe that it is the best Corned beef and Cabbage recipe.  I have a very good Irish friend of 75 yrs old and she told me it was the best she ever had...and preceded to tell it to the owners of a 100 yr old Irish deli and store.
I cooked it in only guiness beer and beef broth. Added peppercorns, bay leaf and onions.  
When the meat was tender I removed it from the pot and glazed it with a tart Orange marmalade, brown mustard and brown sugar glaze and wrapped in foil and put it in the oven.
Then I strained the broth, then added the potatoes and carrots and a stick of butter.  I cooked the cabbage (I used savoy cabbage)  in a separate skillet, braising it in the broth with butter until cooked but still crispy.  Made a Horseradish sauce of 3/4 sour cream, 1/4 horseradish, 1 tlbs dried chives and the juice of 1/2 lemon.  This recipe will impress anyone you serve it to.

Good recipe.  The corned beef is really great when served topped with a horseradish dressing.  1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sourcream and horseradish to taste.

I agree with others...skip the crock pot...the old fashioned way works best.  I like to cook the corned beef, remove from water and wrap in aluminum foil to keep hot.  Then I strain the water to get out the peppercorns and re-use to cook potatoes, carrots and cabbage.  This way you don't bite into a big peppercorn hiding in the cabbage.

This has been my standard recipe for years.  I have found one thing that takes it to the  top. After the corned beef is done cooking I remove it from the pot or crock pot and top it with a glaze of mustard and brown sugar. You can mix it to your liking. I make a lot and let it drip down all the sides. I then put it in the oven until it is heated through and the brown sugar is dissolved. Then slice and enjoy.

As per some of the suggestions, I used 2 cans of beer & 2 cans of beef broth instead of water and cooked it for 7 hours in the crockpot.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and an onion to the crockpot.  I should have given the potatoes and carrots 90 minutes.  I only allowed for 30 and dinner was quite late.  Even my husband liked it who swore he hates corned beef and has never liked cabbage - but he ate it all!

Traditional corned beef for St. Patrick's  Day.. or any other time of the year when you can't stand to have it only once! ***UPDATE: I made this again this year and it was absolutely delicious, but with these alterations: I used 1 can of Guiness, beef broth, and a water to boil the meat. In addition to the spice packet, I added 2-3 tbsp. mustard seeds, whole black peppercorns, and 3 bayleaves. The  cabbage took about 20 minutes to cook even when I turned up the temp (I took out the meat). I would recommend 2 heads of cabbage b/c I like the cabbage. I used about an entire (save the few I snacked on while cooking) 1 lb. bag of baby carrots and 12 baby red potatoes. I wouldn't omit the potatoes b/c they absorb a lot of the salt and you can end up with a really salty roast. Anyway, this recipe is a great starting point, but with additions it can be awesome... and it was! Everybody gobbled it up on St. Patty's. Thanks!

this was fabulous, first I boiled the corned beef on top of stove in water, one guinness, one bay leaf, the spice packet, and one shot of Jameson whiskey, I followed the advice of another review which said to glaze the corned beef for the last 40 minutes with the 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2tbsp melted butter, 1 tbsp prepared mustard, 1/3 cup of ketchup, and 3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, bake 40 minutes at 350degrees while the vegetables are cooking, cut the corned beef across the grain.  Serve with soda bread.  It is soooo good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Just a note that may help in cooking this meal, Add some Caraway seeds when you add the cabbage.  It will help to get rid of the gas that you will probably get from eating the cabbage.

Good, basic and functional - what I'd call a reference recipe. I did mine in the slow cooker and added a bottle of Guiness Draught with enough water to cover.  I cooked the cabbage separately in some of the cooking liquid. Reliable, but more instructional than a unique recipe.

This was very good! The only change I made was to add 3 large cloves of chopped garlic. I also made a sauce for the brisket as mentioned by a member named Tracey. This is what she said...

"I take the corned beef out and while the cabbage carrots and pot's are cooking in the liquid, I put the brisket in the oven for 30 minutes with this sauce that I combine on the stove until smooth. 1/3 cup of brown sugar,2 tblsp of butter tlbs. of prepared mustard, 1/3 cup of ketchup, and 3 tblsp of apple cider vinegar. I combine these ingredients till smooth, then pour over the brisket while the veggies are cooking. 30 to 40 mins. at 350 will do it. Hope you like it, all of my friends who hate corned beef will only eat mine!"...

Tracey's sauce recipe was PERFECT!!! I'll make my corned beef like this from now on!

Cut off the big fat then cover the corn beef with beef broth  
Add peppercorns, bay leaf and onions to spice packet. Before adding the spice packet, you first bring the meat to a boil and skim the foamy stuff off the top of the water.. 
cook meat @ 50 min. per lb

Take the corned beef out and while the cabbage carrots and pot's are cooking in the liquid, Add some Caraway seeds when you add the cabbage. 

Glaze for brisket
Put the brisket in the oven for 30 minutes with this sauce that I combine on the stove until smooth. 1/3 cup of brown sugar,2 tblsp of butter tlbs. of prepared mustard, 1/3 cup of ketchup, and 3 tblsp of apple cider vinegar. I combine these ingredients till smooth, then pour over the brisket while the veggies are cooking. 30 to 40 mins. at 350 will do it.

I'm Irish.  VERY Irish.  And this is my GO TO recipe for corned beef and cabbage.  I only gave it 3 stars, so why is it my Go To??  I gave it 3 stars based on how it tastes as-is.  It's my Go To because it keeps the recipe simple.  Here's the thing - you don't have to do anything fancy to make amazing, over-the-top corned beef and cabbage.  People think it needs to be complicated.  It doesn't!!  The ONLY thing I added and it makes a HUGE difference - 1/2 jar of McCormick Pickling Spice.  I forgot this ingredient once and never will again.

Oh my gosh!  Wonderful.  I prepared it right by the recipe.  My family of five gobbled up a 2.7 pound corned beef brisket in no time.  There wasn't much conversation at this meal, except that they were begging me to cook this again even before we were done eating.  Will definately cook again!

My husband and I enjoyed this very much. Our kids had never eaten Corn beef, so they were on the fence, however for them. They loved the veggies very very much. I placed this in the crock pot/slow cooker all day. I used a 6qt on high. My pot was really full so the cabbage I placed in 1 1/2 hours out from serving dinner. All the veggies were soo good. The meat was very tender, flavored well and soo easy to carve up for slices. Will make this again for hubby and I.

Wonderful recipe! I would definately make this again. However, I would change a couple of things. First, if the corned beef you buy has an excessive amount of fat on the underside as many of them do, trim the fat. Also, do as one reviewer suggested, add beef broth instaed of water. I also added an onion. Loved this easy to make recipe. Try it.

I made this one last week and it was really good. I rinsed off the beef when I took it out of the package, then proceeded as directed. I used regular potatoes, peeled and cut in half instead of the red potatoes and they worked fine. I cooked the potatoes and carrots about 30 minutes before adding the cabbage. The meat was very tender and the veggies cooked just right.

I wait all year for this meal but I had never made it myself until this year. A friend gave me the advice to pull the beef out of the pot when you put the veggies in, sprinkle brown sugar on top and bake it at 350' until the veggies and cabbage are done. It was SO good! Please try this!!!

This is a great recipe. Very easy, which is important. Using beef broth was a good suggestion, however the meat that I used could have cooked a little longer and the cabbage was a little under done, probably 25 min would be better than 15. But overall it was very tasty and the whole family loved it!

Xclnt, easy dish! made this a few times. I use a VERY large pot. I added one can of light beer, and about 2 cups of apple juice. Then filled the rest with water to cover meat. 45mins before brisket should be done, I add carrots and potatoes. 20mins before everything is done, I added the cabbage. YUM-O!

This is the classic preparation.  I follow this procedure with a few changes:  Cut the cabbage into large chunks and steam it separately until tender.  Add as much butter as your diet will allow :) and season with salt and pepper.  When the corned beef is fully cooked, remove it and put it in a baking dish.  Mix mustard and brown sugar to make a very thick paste.  Spread the paste on top of the corned beef.  Put the meat under the broiler until it bubbles and crisps.  By cooking the cabbage separately and adding the brown sugar paste you'll enjoy more variety of flavors and you'll get a little crunch for texture.

I don't even like corned beef and cabbage and this was a hit!  For the most part, I stuck to the recipe.  Just added one bottle of Harp beer, a Tbs. of minced garlic and a dash of celery salt.  I did not include the potatoes with the meat because we were having another potato sidedish, but I think they would've been good cooked in the pot.  I cooked a 3 1/4lb. piece of meat for about four hours and it shredded beautifully.  Great recipe!

I have been making this for years. I also add a bottle of beer. I also use new potatos and celery, carrots, onion, fresh snap peas, fresh garlic,black pepper corns, mustard seed, dill seed, and lemon juice. Red pepper and bell pepper. I can eat this for days. I don't trim the fat. The fat is one of my favorite parts. This is one of the very few recipes I make that I am not fat conscious about. This and steaks. I can eat this soup for days 6 times a day!

OH MY! So much for following the recipe. While my beef was simmering in 8 cups of water for 2.5 hrs, I took a siesta. The water all evaporated and the beef burned.

Time to start again. A glass of wine for me, or maybe two, a fresh brisket, and half again as much water.

This was my first time making Corned Beef and Cabbage and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I will be making this again!
I used the red flat corned beef, turnip, peeled potatoes (both red and Russet - couldn't tell the difference in taste), carrots, cabbage, white onion.  My corned beef did not come w/ a spice packet, but when the meal is complete, the taste is still to die for.  I added a little salt and pepper and a bit of garlic, but there is really no need to.

if you want to add a bit more color and maybe a hint more sweetness to this recipe, try red cabbage with the green, it is wonderful.

Love this recipe!  Other reviewers suggest adding beef broth, peppercorns, etc., but I think this comfort food is best made simply, just like good 'ol mashed potatoes.  Speaking of potatoes, if you decide not to use them, expect the broth to be pretty salty since the potatoes absorb a good amount of salt during the cooking process.  Also, for those with kids, mash the potatoes and carrots together (or separately) with a fork, add a little butter, and they'll probably love it!  Mine did (age 6 and 7).

I'm a rookie when it comes to cooking. In fact, I have never cooked a complete meal before attempting this recipe. On St. Patrick's day, my wife was working and I wanted to surprise her with a corn beef and cabbage dinner when she got home. The directions were easy to follow and the finished product was outstanding! I also made corn bread (my first attempt at baking bread). I used chicken broth instead of just water as some others had recommended. The carrots and potatoes were really good as well!! I was really surprised how delecious the meal turn out and so was my wife!!

OMG This is so tasty it's to die for! You don't need ANY other seasoning other than the little packet that comes with the beef, not even salt. The meat itself does all the seasoning and flavoring for you. Don't be scared about how your cabbage will taste! Another little tip - ADD SOME ONIONS. I love onions and it makes everything that much better!! :) My family devoured this pot!

I love this recipe as it is, but I found making two minor modifications makes it even better (at least in my family's opinion).  First, add a half-cup or so of cooking sherry to the pot before starting.  Second, replace the cabbage with 1-1.5 pounds of Brussels sprouts.   It makes for a nice twist on an old favorite.

FABULOUS!  Like a another reviewer, I had always winged it when it came to corned beef & cabbage.  I followed this recipe to a tee and absolutely everything came our PERFECT!  Corned Beef tender and starting to fall apart - which I love - and the potatoes, carrots and cabbage were perfectly soft but not soggy.  From here on out, this will be THE recipe to use!

This is amazing!  I used another reviewers tip and used one can of beer and 3 large cloves garlic pressed through my garlic press (then enough water to cover beef and adding the spices from the packet) and added 1 whole stick of butter at the same time I added the cabbage.  I also cut my potatoes because they were fairly large red potatoes and that worked well.  Great Great Great Recipe!!!!

Good template for a superb classic dish. I highly recommend using a can or two low-sodium beef broth instead of water, which really enhances flavor without oversalting the recipe. If you're a garlichead like me try tossing in 5 or 6 cloves when you start the meat, and mash them into the stock after they cook to tender.

"What's more Irish than a traditional recipe for corned beef and cabbage?"

The answer is - lots of things!  Corned beef and cabbage is not a traditional Irish dish.  Born and bred in Ireland, I was in my 50's when I spent some time in the US and was told that everyone eats corned beef and cabbage on St. Paddy's Day.  I had never heard of it and I still have never tasted it.  When I came home from that trip I did ask around, in case I somehow had missed this vital part of Irish tradition, but, no, I have yet to come across any Irish national who has actually eaten corned beef and cabbage.  

Further research has taught me that, in fact, Irish immigrants to America began eating corned beef, which they bought from Jewish butchers, because of their new-found affluence. At home, in Ireland, it was only the very wealthy who could afford to eat beef.  So, eating corned beef on Paddy's Day is really an American-Irish-Jewish tradition.

This recipe is perfect.  I had never made corned beef before because I did not like it as a child, but my husband is Irish and really missed it.  I tried this skeptically -- We all loved it!  Now my kids request it all the time.  The best part about it is that the cabbage just cooks through, so it is not mushy and tasteless.  It has a wonderful, fresh flavor and is very easy to make.

Actually, real Irish don't even eat this. It's an American Irish immigrant tradition from when this cut of meat was about the cheapest available. the poorer they were, the less that went into it. They also didn't have the nice little spice packet either. Anyway, add the carrots, garlic, and if you feeling sassy, add broccoli tips. boil with a guinnes

We cook this recipe every year at our St. Patty's Day party (sans the potatoes, add more cabbage), and our party grows every year due to word of mouth about the corned beef.  Last year we hosted over 100 people and went through 6 large crockpots of corned beef and cabbage.

Great recipe! I used a giant roaster for this meal since we like a lot cabbage. This recipe is fool proof and always comes out perfect. I do put my carrots in with the meat cooking process since my family likes softer carrots and I add the potatos and cabbage together so you get no tough cabbage in the end. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect and easy!   I tried corned beef last year in a pressure cooker, it tasted nothing like this. This is easy. I made it exact to instructions with a 3 lb corned beef. Even my family liked the carrots, and no one in my family likes cooked carrots. We just voted to have this on a normal rotation for dinner instead of just new years day and St. Patrick's day.

Wow,

I listened to the reviews.  I added 10 pepper corns, three cloves of garlic, one bay leaf.  I cooked a four pound trimmed cut for three hours then moved it to the oven with Tracey's (her review is highly rated) sauce while I cooked the veggies.   The best corn beef I have ever had.  My family mowed through it.  

This should not be reserved for St Pats day.  This is a world class meal....

This is the way to do it!  Comes out perfect.  I only make 2 small changes.  I actually only let the cabbage boil maybe 5 minutes.  I like it to be much crispier.  And, I really don't like the spice packet.  Comes out just great without it.

This is the first time I have made corned beef and cabbage this way.  Normally I make it in the crock pot.  I always worried about it not coming out tender if it was boiled.  This recipe was perfect, the only thing I added was a can of beer for more flavor.  I will be making it this way from now on.  Bye bye crock pot recipe!

The best ever! I have tried everything from baking, steaming, to slow cooking. Nothing compares to this one. The only difference was, I added one peeled onion whole, a table spoon of alspice, and several bay leaves. Wow, this is the only one for us.

We use a crok pot and add potatoes to the recipe and love it.  It always comes out more tender this way.  We make it every once in awhile and this it is the best way to have corned beef.

This was my first time making corned beef, and I will definitely be making it again! The process is so easy, if somewhat lengthy, but the results are well worth it. I used half of the seasoning packet included in the package with the meat, and also took the recommended advice of using beef broth as the cooking liquid. When it was done cooking, I found the meat to be too salty, so I took  the advice of another user and made a simple glaze out of brown sugar, mustard, butter, ketchup, and apple cider vinegar, then put the beef in a small baking pan and baked it at 350 for half an hour while the veggies cooked in the on the stove. I was a little skeptical,but the result was an extremely tender, salty-sweet brisket that went perfectly with the vegetables.

This recipe worked well.  I did cook my brisket in water and the veggies turned out just a bit bland.  Next time I will try using beef broth as suggested by other reviewers.  All in all a good recipe that I will use again.

It got my 6 year old daughter to eat cabbage. My wife and 2 year old son are not too keen on corned beef, but the kid and I love corned beef (especially cold leftovers). This recipe was simple and perfect. I haven't added cabbage since my daughter was born, but I thought I would give it a shot. I did add onions, fresh garlic, extra mustard seed, and celery, but on the whole it would have been easy and delicious regardless. I also cut up the red potatoes and carrots and boiled them off 10 min before adding the cabbage, then boiled off the cabbage for 10 min, then returned the rested beef to the pot for another 10-15 min on simmer. Anyway you do it, it's easy and delicious. Will add mushrooms next time, I think. If you cut your potatoes don't overcook. I also serve with Southern style cornbread.

First of all, let me state I am not a corned beef fan.  I decided to embrace my 12.5 % Irish blood in me on a whim this morning and make something in honor of St. Patrick's Day.  Stumbled upon this recipe with such rave reviews that I dashed out to the market in search of a 3 lb corned beef and some soda bread...got Guinness as an impulse item to authenticate the meal while I was at it, and glad I did since I used the reviewers suggestions and gave up two of the bottles for the pot.  I warned my husband of almost 25 years that if we didn't like the meat, there were plenty of veggies to sustain us.  All I can say is I can no longer say I'm not a corned beef fan...though so far I only like my own recipe (see how quickly something I learn becomes my own--it's a Greek thing)!  I added one whole onion, 3 cloves of garlic (I love garlic and next time I'll add more), 1 TBSP Allspice and doubled the carrots and cabbage.  Not big into potatoes, but the family is, and potatoes are just so Irish.  Simmered 3 hours, then added potatoes for 15 min, then the carrots for another 15 and then cabbage for the last 15. I heated up purchased Irish Soda Bread while the cabbage simmered.  I served the meal on a large platter with the meat against one side of the platter, with the veggies surrounding  the meat--I put the potatoes on one side of the meat, the carrots on the other side and the cabbage between, surrounding the meat for a colorful presentation.  The adults were given Guinness Bottles a

Delicious.  We enjoyed this very much.  I had no red potatoes, so I used 6 medium-sized russets I had already, peeled and quartered.  I layered the potatoes and carrots on the bottom of my crock pot and put the meat on top.  My cabbage did not fit in my crock, so I laid it on top of the meat. I filled it halfway with water, threw in a few beef bullion cubes and let it cook.  As the crock filled with juice I pushed the cabbage down a bit.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours or so and everything was great.  Loved it.  I don't think it needed the beef bullion.  Very flavorful broth!

I realize this recipe is very basic but the timing of the vegetables is what makes it amazing. My family always boiled everything together for the same length of time which makes the veggies and potatoes mushy. My Grandma recently passed away and I have taken over the traditional dinners which I've never really made before. This recipe has given me a whole new take on corned beef and cabbage. The cabbage is perfect after 15-20 min. and the broth is amazing, I like to use the leftover broth for a good soup or stew, just refrigerate overnight and skim the hard fat off, add whatever you like and voila! Thanks Laria!

Excellent, and easy one pot meal.  the only change I made was I added a bottle of beer, it added GREAT flavor to the sauce.  I'd give it more than 5 stars.  It's not just for St. Paddy's Day!!

Delicious and oh-so tender when it is done.  I cooked mine in a crockpot.  As other people suggested I added some of my own seasoning.  In addition to the included seasoning packet:  I added mustard seed, garlic, and bay leaves.  I used a can of beer and then added water to cover.  I cooked it on high until it was (basically) simmering and then turned the crockpot to low.   I added the potatoes,  some turnips, and carrots and hour before I wanted to eat.  At this time I also added my onions because I wanted to add the flavor; I wasn't worried about eating soggy onions.  With only 20 minutes left I took out the corned beef to rest and added the quartered cabbage.
In the end I either needed to cut my veggies smaller or give more time for cooking.  My husband and I felt the vegetables were a bit undercooked.  So either add time for bigger chunks or dice the veggies for the smaller time.
I cooked it on low for 6 hours, on high for 1 hour.  It was super flavorful and so good.  We used a horseradish sauce found on here for dipping.

I used KIMMY28's adaptation to make this recipe, with the mushrooms and beef broth and whatnot. 

I will admit, I forgot about the food cooking on the stove and let it simmer quite a bit longer than recommended, finally pulling it off the stove late in the evening. As the cook had been so long I'd fed the kids something else for dinner.

The next morning, somewhat dubious, I pulled the pot from the fridge, pulled a potato from the liquid, and popped it in my mouth. I actually squealed with delight, did a little happy dance, and finger fed from the pot for a period of time.

Highly recommend this recipe, 5 star, very good and going into rotation at our house. Very very good.

I save pickle juice of all kinds year round. When St Patty's Day approaches I put the corned beef with seasoning packet and another hand full of bay leaves with the pickle juice and slow cook all day. The smell last and last ever so good!!!

This is so delicious!! The meat you can cut with a fork. I quartered the potatoes to cut down on the cooking time. I also added the cabbage when the potatoes were a little firm. This is a salty meat but such a treat once in a while. Very easy!!

I wasn't convinced this would be good...  It was so tender and delicious.  I added onions, garlic, dried cilantro and peppercorns to the water.  I boiled cabbage and carrots with the meat.  I made mashed potatoes and steamed brussels sprouts.

The recipe is easy and works just fine for a traditional and satisfying meal. However, for a more full flavored version, I do recommend the suggestion of others. Put in a few garlic cloves (slightly mashed to release flavor) a large sweet onion and 1 bottle of beer with the water. The liquid should be about 1 inch over the meat. I removed the corned beed when it felt tender enough (following the cooking time suggested by author) and wrapped it tightly in foil while I cooked the vegetables. Note. I also put about a tsp. of kosher salt & 1/4 tsp of all-spice to the water after removing the corned beef and right before adding the veggies for added flavor. When veggies are almost cooked, add the corned beef back to the pot for a few minutes. Slice the beef against the grain on a large plate and arrange the vegetables. Serve with a horseradish dressing (sour cream and prepared horseradish). It will make for a pleasing display and delicious meal.

This is from "Linehan and Collins"  Cannot get any more Irish.  We love corned beef, make it regularly, boil , bake, stew, all come out great, I trim my corned beef, prior to cooking, and I make it in croc pot, then later add potatoes and veggies to last hour. I braise the corned beef prior to adding in crock, seal in the flavors, with garlic wedges added into slits on brisket.  comes out amazing, cannot slice, it melts as it falls apart (much like a beef roast.) I do not add the spice packet in croc, but i did cook it as she states and it came out grand as well.  great recipe. simple as corned beef should be. add onions if you love them as we do.

I prepare this dish quite often as my family loves it!  I just add, during the last 1/2 hour, the potatoes and carrots around the beef then place cabbage wedges on top of everything to steam, cover and finish cooking.  Also, to serve DO please try a generous amount of French's Mustard on the sliced corn beef and butter on the veggies ...it's just heavenly!

You can't go wrong with a corned beef as long as you cook it slow and use plenty of liquid.  Use what you like, I use extra peppercorns and bay leaves along with the spice packet, broth, beer and water in the crock pot.  It cooks all day and falls apart!  I use extra liquid, then strain it into a pot on the stove for the potatoes, carrots and cabbage.  Its WONderful!

This was by far the best corned beef and cabbage recipe I've ever tried.  I know some people have a thing about tweaking the recipes in here - sorry!  I did it, too.  I added chopped carrots and onions to the liquid at the beginning.  I also added some peppercorns and bay leaves and 1 can of Guinness Stout.  Everything else I did the same.  I've never cooked all the veggies in the pot with the corned beef before and they turned out so flavorful I'll be doing it that way from now on.  Thanks, Laria, for giving us a great recipe!

I used this for St. Patty's Day this year and it turned out VERY moist to the point it felt like it was melting in your mouth.  I added some of my own seasoning to the vegetables like freshly minced garlic, parsley and oregano.  Everything was wonderful and evryone loved it!  Thank you

We had a pot-luck muti-culture day at work and our team had Ireland.  I used this recipe and it is the first time I have made corned beef and cabbage.  It was simple, delicious and a crowd pleaser!  I followed the reviewers suggestions to use low sodium beef broth and white potatoes, and they potatoes did a great job of neutralizing the salt. Only mistake I made was doubling the potatoes, carrots and cabbage for double the corned beef.  Had tons of left over potato and carrot!  Loved, loved, loved it....will definitely try again, and again.

If you are not a HEAVY salt person,  always rinse the cornded beef very well. It has been brining in mega doses of salt.  I rinse, then pre cook for 40 min then continue the rest of the process. Oops 30 min pre cook.

I've been using this recipe for years and it never disappoints. I usually add 2-3 quartered onions and several large sliced garlic cloves to the boil. I also empty the spice pack into some cheesecloth, adding pickling spice and a bay leaf. The key is to find a flat cut (not point) of brisket with not too much fat. Cabbage quarters take much longer than 15 minutes, sometimes as long as 45-60 minutes.

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and it's delicious and exactly the way my Mom made it.  The only thing it needs is a nice sprinkling of salt and pepper once it's on your plate.  Hubby is a spicy food guy so it won't be a staple, but it's a keeper and I'll make it again, if only for me!

This dish is excellent in a pressure cooker. Place meat and seasonings in pot, cover with water. For a standard brisket, bring to pressure for 45 mins. Then place cabbage, vegetables, potatoes on top of meat. Pressure up, for 15 mins. release pressure and enjoy.

First time cooking corned beef & cabbage , and must say, my husband & I were happily surprised with how easy and delicious this was. I was going to use our slow cooker, but after reading lots of reviews, it sounds like this cooking method tends to make it a tad bit mushy. I was worried about having enough room in by large pot for all of it, but fit the 3.75lb brisket, 1/2 of a wedge of cabbage (quartered) 7 red potatoes, 1 large onion (cut into wedges) and abut 20 baby carrots just fine. 

One tip, I would have cooked the potatoes/carrots/onions longer than I did before putting in the cabbage because they were just a little underdone - I only put them in for about 5-7 minutes before I threw in the cabbage.

Also, I put in the red potatoes whole...I think I might like to half or quarter them first next time to absorb more of the broth, but not sure how it'll turn out, just an idea.

All in all, I found my staple for future St. Patty Day's to come!

I prepared this recipe for our St Patricks Day meal at the small diner that i manage. Had nothing but wonderful comments. The only thing I did different is for every 5 lbs of meat instead of just covering with water i used 1 cup of beef broth and one 12 oz bottle of stout beer then added water to cover meat. This is a keeper!

Great and easy recipe. I adapted for the slow cooker and didn't have small potatoes on hand (quartered what I had). Cooked in crockpot for 5 hours. Put the veggies in about 3 hours in and the cabbage went in about 45 minutes til the end. Husband thought the beef was a little tough.

I learned this little trick with corned beef years ago and have always wanted to share it...take the cooked corned beef and spread yellow mustard all over and top with brown sugar.  Bake in 350 oven till brown sugar melts.  It gives the corned beef a little kick.

Just made this with Trader Joe's Corned Beef and used the crockpot.  Added a bottle of Smithwicks along with some garlic.  Best Corned Beef dish ever.

Great recipe.  Served this to our friends recently.  One of our friends, who is Irish American, said it was as good as she had growing up.  We followed Tracey's suggestion of baking the brisket afterwards with the butter-sugar mixture--amazingly tender.  Enjoy!

I make this every year and it is a total hit. I had a friend of mine (who happens to be Irish) tell me that her grandmother always added a dark Irish Stout when cooking the beef. SO I decided to use a can of Guinness then water to cover. DELICIOUS! Even if you dont like dark beer the way the flavors mesh are wonderful! JUST TRY IT!!  :)

I have made this recipe previously and continued to play around with it each year.  I finally got rave revues this year.  I did not get the spice packet with my 3 1/3 lb flat cut corned beef so I added 3 garlic cloves, 2Tbls. peppercorns and 1 stalk of celery to 2 cans of beer, added the beef and covered with water.  Followed rest of directions, removed beef to warm oven before cooking veggies in the brine.  Also added some white potatos and onions. Served with a horseradish sauce.  Delicious.

This recipe was so easy and the results were delicious!  We cooked the corned beef in a mixture of half beer, half water and the meat came out really tender.  We also added turnips and parsnips with the other veggies.  We served the meal with Jack Daniel's horseradish mustard.  This will be our new St Patty's Day tradition!

Can't go wrong. Basic, easy recipe.  I did add 8 cloves of garlic and 2 bottles of beer (for 5 lbs of meat). Thanks for keeping this so simple.  Less is more sometimes.

Everything turned out great.  the only thing i would stiplulate is to take the meat out after the 50 minutes per pound and let it set at least 30 minutes.  This makes it easier to cut so it doesn't fall apart.  If necessary the meat can be put back in the broth and brought to a boil again to rewarm.  All the veggies in this receipe were yummy!!

A wonderful recipe.  I used a 4.5 lb brisket and added an onion.  I had to omit the potatoes due to the space constraints of my Crock-Pot.  I added 2 beef bouillion cubes and 10 peppercorns and filled the pot with water.  I cooked for 10 hours on low.  The results were delicious.

Wow!  This was my first experience making corned beef and cabbage!  Great recipe.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and used beef broth and added garlic and an onion.  Very flavorful!  Will definitely make again.  It turned out perfect!  I loved it.

This was the first time I had ever tried corned beef. The glaze was fabulous! And making the lentils in the corned beef broth made them even tastier. This recipie definitely receives an A plus!

YES!!!!! So, this is what I changed:
Dropped a 3.5lb corned beef in a large pot. Covered the meat generously with water (there was an extra inch of water over the surface of the meat), added a bottle of Yuengling beer, a chopped onion, 6-7 cloves of garlic, and the seasoning packet that came with the beef. Brought to a boil, then cooked on low for 3 hours (50min per lb). Boiled the cabbage and carrots together separately for 40 minutes, and made mashed potatoes the day before. This was the best this meal has ever come out. The meat was juicy, tender, not too salty and not too sweet, it was a perfect balance and absolutely delicious. The veggies were perfect with a pat of butter on top. All plates were practically licked clean. I will make it this way from now on!

This was so easy to make and so tasty!!!!  I increased the amount of potatoes and carrots a bit, so I removed corned beef and let sit while the veggies cooked.  I used a beer, half a small can of beef broth, and water to cook beef.  Not too salty at all.  Added a few large pieces of onion while it cooked too.  Family couldn't get enough!  Thank you so much.

we have corned beef almost every weekend for breakfast with some asparagus and/or some veggie. i put it in the slowcooker the night before with the following. 3 cans guinness, 1 cup pinapple juice, 3tbs honey. i put it on high from around 6-7p until around 11 and then turn it to low until we wake up.. maybe 730a before we head to the beach. take it out of the slowcooker and put it on a plate and let it sit for about 10min. we shred half of it, quick saute it with some fresh organic asparagus that we blanched first and then either eat it on the spot or take it to the beach and eat it.. anyone that has tried it loves it. i put the rest in the fridge and pick at it over the weekend. if you can find black angus prime corned beef its substantially better.

This was a solid foundation recipe for me.  Having never made nor eaten this dish before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I followed the advice of Cooker476, except for the turnips, by adding beer, garlic, peppercorns and added salt as well  I also made the horseradish sauce (with a pinch of salt added) which absolutely made the dish (thanks!)!!  At the end I reduced the cooking liquid, added a bay leaf and seasoning and made a gravy that was also delicious with the meat, potatoes and horsey sauce.  Overall it was a huge hit in my house, even the kids (6 & 3) gobbled it up!

This recipe is amazing!! It's the corned beef and cabbage I was looking for. Being very Irish myself I'm quite picky and I set out to find a traditional Irish recipe. This was it! I did not veer from the directions at all and the corned came out extremely moist with great flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent.  Also added a couple of bay leaves, some whole peppercorns and quartered onion.  Tender and delicious.  I like to take that cabbage and chop it and use it for the Heritage Irish Cabbage before serving.  I make it while the meat is resting.

seriously ?  Adding a stout beer and a cup or apple cider or golden brown sugar brought out such a more indepth flavor for us.  And don't forget a bayleaf.  Were not so much into boiled meat so after removing the beef from the pot slather on a couple tablespoons of deli mustand, put in a 400degree oven for 30 minutes to give it a nice crust.  Yum

Fool proof directions for a moist Corned Beef. I actually put together my own spices as my CB didn't come with a packet. Pickling spices work great. I left out potatoes because my hubby and I are doing lo-carb.

Keep this one simple for sure.  Can we have this on another day or do we have to wait for St Patricks? Served with Soda Bread from this site ........... YUM

This was my first time making corned beef on my own, and it was really good. The only thing I did different was to use sliced bok choy instead of cabbage (I had it leftover from another dish, and it's in the cabbage family).  The leftovers are delicious, too.  I love making corned beef, potato, carrot, and "cabbage" sandwiches with some horseradish mustard. Mmm...

Very good recipe for the corned beef. Easy..basic..and fool-proof.
The one thing I do, is when I remove the meat from the liquid, I slice across the grain, and smear a mixture of sour orange marmalade, brown sugar and brown mustard, over the top of the meat, and in between the slices, and then put into a 400 degree oven for 30-40 minutes...Heavenly.
But you know...the worse corned beef I have ever had, was fantastic. I'm easy to please.

Wonderful Sunday dinner.  I bought 4.15 lb of meat, cut off at least a half a pound of fat before cooking.  My husband and I had plenty for leftovers.  A goal of the Sunday dinner.  I did add half of a yellow onion when I first starting boiling.  I will make this again and again.  Easy and delicious!

I surfed around and found this easy recipe -- the key, I believe, is to put in about an inch or so water above the brisket. . . bring to a boil and then simmer like stated.  Along w/ the spice packet, I tossed in a garlic clove and some addtl mustgard seeds.  It was wonderful.  My other change [another website] is that I cooked the entire brisket first, removed it, then added my cabbage and carrots to cook in the remaining liquid until they were done.    Amazing dish -- I will stock up on a couple briskets while on sale during St. Pat's and cook them throughout the year.  Once just isn't enough.

I made this recipe pretty much like Ms Tabul had it and it was great. The people that review and change every living thing about the recipe I feel should post their own recipes. Changing a small thing here and there is fine but these people rewrite the recipes. Thanks Laria it was great

Something to add to this recipe would be Guinness, you cannot go wrong with Guinness!  Just a quick note regarding the description, Corned Beef and Cabbage is not a traditional Irish dish, beef was not commonly eaten in Ireland and traditionally, they would eat pork.  This dish gained it's popularity when the Irish came to America where beef and salt were considerably cheaper.  While they do serve Corned Beef and Cabbage in Ireland on St.Patrick's day, it is mostly to please the tourists.

Love the beer suggestion! I usually use some beef broth & a bit of red wine; will have to try the beer  instead of wine.  Like my Irish-Welsh grandmother, I also prefer to do the vegetables separate (& add onions) in some of the stock, so the potatoes won't rob all of it from the meat. On the comment abt this not being of true Irish origin -- that's  not my understanding from family, tho have heard Irish-Irish say that corned beef is not regarded as a festive, special occasion dish, but rather as poor folks' plate -- a way to tenderize cheaper cuts of meat than brisket.  Way to take the fun out of it, Old Country cousins!

I didn't realize that corned beef and cabbage usually takes 10 hours in a slow cooker if it's on low.  We ended up  waiting a lot longer than we thought! It was pretty good. Next time I'll cook it over night.

This was just ok for us. I have to stick with adding beer to mine then cooking it in the oven...NOT boiling it. The cabbage carmalizes a bit and the meat just falls apart.

I have made this twice, both times using a previous reviewers suggestion of cooking the ingredients in beer instead of water.  What a great idea!  I use 4-6 bottles of a German hefeweizen, and add enough water to finish covering the meat.  It's pretty easy to prepare and serve, but still not my favorite dish, it's a little bland.  I ended up using a lot of fancy gourmet mustard on the portions I ate to spice up the flavor.  But that's just my preference.

This recipe is spot on! I had a flat cut corned beef that was just under 3 lbs. I added 2 tablespoons of mustard seed, approx. 12 peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, and a sprinkling of dried sliced garlic. Then I added two bottles of beer and water to slightly cover the beef and the seasoning packet on top. I set the timer for the time alloted, but found out that my husband wasn't coming home on time. I just turned it down so it was slightly simmering and added potatoes and cabbage accordingly when he came home. I made the horseradish sauce mentioned in an earlier review. It was the best ever! Thanks for sharing, Laria!

Nothing out of the ordinary, but you can't go wrong with corned beef and cabbage.  I did add the carrots a lot later than the potatos so they wouldn't become mushy.

I used a corned beef weighing just under three pounds. It had a fatty side but I didn't cut it off before cooking (the fat cut off really easily when it was done cooking), and I used six medium-sized red potatoes and 15 or so larger-sized baby carrots. I only used half a medium-sized head of cabbage. It only took about two hours cooking for the corned beef to become tender at which point I added the whole potatoes for ten minutes. I then added both the carrots and the cabbage, and everything was perfectly done about ten minutes later. The corned beef rest, covered by foil, on a plate for 15 minutes and I dumped the veggies into a colander to drain. Not such a hot idea as I was picking the corned beef spices out of the veggies, but it was an excellent and easy supper! Thanks for sharing, Laria!

I used the recipe for "Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches" for the meat (using Guinness) exactly as written and cooked it for 6 hours on the stove top. For the veggies, I used this recipe, but added a lot more of them). After the beef was done (it fell apart) I added to the broth 3 pounds quartered new potatoes, 2 pounds baby carrots (cut in half) and an onion. I let that cook for 20 minutes and then added a head of cabbage. I cooked an additional 15 minutes. Then I removed the veggies and made a gravy out of the leftover stock using a slurry of stock and corn starch. This recipe was a huge hit last night for our St. Patrick's Day get together. Very authentic tasting and the peppercorns get soft as they cook, so when you bite into one, you get a nice kick without being overly powerful or chipping your teeth. This will be our annual tradition!

I made this as the recipe stated except my Corned Beef (Harris Brand) did not come with a spice package or any spices around it.  I added 2 bay leaves and 1 TSP whole pepper corns and 1 TSP Spice Islands steak seasoning.  I cooked it all and thought the meat should be more tender, so I refrigerated the cooked veggies and put the beef and the liquids into my crock pot and cooked it overnight on low.  I reheated the veggies and added the meat and juices and it was INCREDIBLE!!  Everyone can't get over how good it is.

A wonderful taste of Irish tradition.  Cooking this dish put me in touch with my Irish heritage and served as the appropriate star of my St. Patty's Day table. I pressure cooked my brisket and it was much faster and just as tender. Also, I cooked my vegetables separately in the beef's broth.  It was splendid!

Do it Tracey's way.  I modified the original recipe as follows:
Preheat oven to 325 f cover the lid of a fry pan with foil so it will make a tight seal, use HD foiled if you have it.
1. Washed 6 pound flat corned beef from Costco in cold water and put it in a large deep nonstick fry pan. 
2. Added enough cold water to pan to almost cover then added enough stout beer so the only thing above the water line was fat.
3. Spread the contents of the spice bag on the fat
4. Sliced an onion and covered the fat with the oven.
5. Brought to a boil on stove top.
6. Turned of heat, covered with foiled lined cover and artfully put on center rack of preheated oven
7. After 1 hour lowered heat to 250 f
8. @ 5 hour mark took off cover and inserted meat fork. (50 minutes / pound) Perfect.

Removed Beef to covered oven proof plater and added potatoes and carrots to liquid.  Cooked on oven @ 350 after bringing contents to boil for 45 minutes (just getting tender.
Put the cooked vegetables under and around the side of the corned beef added some of the liquid from the pan, covered the top with Tracey's sauce and baked for 45 minutes.

Tasted great, meat was perfect and the fat was like butter.

Really good! Only one thing I would change is to add the seasoning packet after removing the foam so you don't lose any of the seasoning with it.

Best corned beef and cabbage recipe yet!  I much preferred cooking in the dutch oven over the crock pot.  The meat was so tender but you were able to slice it without it falling apart.  The veggies were not over done either.  The simple recipe was a delicious flavor!  I will use this one over and over.

I made this as stated and did not make changes. I boiled the corned beef for 2 hrs. on the stove top and then put in the carrots/potatoes/cabbage wedges and cooked another 1 hr. in the oven at 350. Everything was moist and done to perfection. This was a very enjoyable meal and I served it with brown mustard/horseradish blend. Happy St. Patrick's Day!

This is the most delicious meal ever. Following tracey's suggestions of making a sauce from butter, brown sugar, catsup and apple cider vinegar it was fabulous. After the corned beef is done place it in an ovenproof dish, pour the sauce over and while the vegetables cook in the broth, bake the sauce covered corned beef at 350 for 30 minutes. Slice the meat and return to dish and serve the vegetables on another platter. This was absolutely fabulous. My guests couldn’t stop complimenting or eating. Not your mom’s meatloaf for sure.

Bland.
I was skeptical and should have trusted my gut.
I've had all kinds of corned beef and this is below average.
I would go with beer instead of water, additional mustard seed, and a bay leaf next time.

I had always been wanting to try something like this. I made this for St. Patty's Day. I took the advice of others & added beer (mickey's). And I removed the corned beef when I added the cabbage for the last 15mins. (But, that was more my hubby was hungry & wanted to eat in 15mins not 15 mins for the cabbage & 15 for the beef to rest!) This was soooo YUMMY! I couldn't believe I made this! The entire family ate this without complaint!

I have never made OR ate corned beef and cabbage EVER. As one reviewer suggested, I added 1 can of beer; then water to cover; I added 6 garlic cloves and 1 bay leaf. I also took their advice and added the potatoes and carrots 1 hour before the brisket was ready ;then cabbage and onions 40 min. Til it was done. My friends who love corned beef and cabbage said it was the best they have ever had. Will be making this again next st.patricks.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. There is NO WAY this can be cooked in and hour per pound!!! My beef was tough. Not good. Adding carrots, cabbage, and potatoes isn't anything special. I used the reviews to tailor it a bit and added a bottle of spring wheat ale, VERY good, and instead of adding more water to keep it covered I used beef stock. Next year, I will do exactly the same only start at 10am with a CROCKPOT to quarantee tenderness.

This really couldn't be any easier or tastier as my taste buds are thanking me for this recipe choice!  I made the recipe as called for and I can say that broth or beer does NOT need to be added as some suggest.  This creates a good broth/flavor all by itself.  It's worth trying as the recipe states 1st, before altering--this coming from someone who alters recipes quite often.  I was a bit worried with what the flavor would be as I didn't care for the way the spice packet smelled once the corned beef began to boil.  And in reading other's reviews I knew NOT to add salt either.   This recipe reminds me of my days i spent in Ireland.  Thanks so much for sharing such a simple and flavorful recipe!!  I served this with an irish soda bread recipe that is made stovetop.  Great St. Patty's Day meal!!  Think I'll make some irish colcannon with leftover corned beef for dinner tomorrow.

I loved this recipe considering my corned beef was always hit or miss. It sliced up perfectly thank goodness since I sometimes manage to be unable to slice it without it shredding into one big mess of strings. the one thing i did differently was in the last hour  of cooking I removed the beef only added veggies to pot of stock then put the corned beef in the oven at 350 in baking pan and covered it with a bottle of dark lager and aluminum foil while the veggies cooked in the water.   It was the best corned beef I ever had ! ooh yeah and I also added a few bay extra bay leafs & pepper corns. to the spice packet

Gave it four stars, because I had to change it per earlier reviewers.  Followed tracey's review and removed brisket after simmer, baked for 40 mins with glaze while pot. and carrots and cabbage cooked.  DELISH!!

This was delicious and super easy, even though it took a while to cook, I think I will try in the slow cooker next time. My beef did not come with a spice packet, so used seasonings from another Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe from this site, mainly apple cider vinegar, sugar, pepper, bay leaf, nutmeg and cloves. I think they were definately worth adding!

Our corned beef came out very rubbery and the potatoes were overdone.  The only part of this recipe that came out perfectly was the carrots.  I may have to try this again as it was my first time trying corned beef, but my experience was not a good one.

This recipe is delicious!!! I added a bottle of Sierra Nevada beer and 4oz Beef Broth and butter. It took a total of 3 hours to cook. I added the potatoes and carrots after 2 hours and the cabbage during the last 30 minutes of cooking :) Sooo good!!!!

Warning to MAGGIEKATS  & others with newer crock pots!  Because of some stupid new gov. regulation, newer slow cookers low temp. is now above boiling. This changes many,many things. Cooking times for anything on low now needs to be "adjusted" and forget making -pot cakes! I don't dare leave my new pot unattended!  I intend to make this corned beef tomorrow but will not leave the house with the crock pot on!

Since the meat takes 2 1/2 -3 hours to cook (so that it is really tender), I cooked it the night before, wrapped it in foil and reheated it the next night in a 300 degree oven for 30 minutes or so. I also reheated the cooking liquid (after skimming off a ton of fat) then added and simmered the veggies putting potatoes on the bottom and adding carrots, turnips, parsnips, onions and cabbage on the top... I opened up a can of beets and heated them for some more beautiful color... YUMMY

Followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1 can of beer, 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and a tsp of whole peppercorns.  Also made a sauce using sour cream, horseradish and a dash of lemon juice.  Fantastic St. Patrick's Day meal!

Was excellent. Did a couple minor changes. Used one IPA beer, beefy onion mix packet, 4 large garlic cloves, and 2 TBLS of pickling spice in addition to the small pack that comes with the brisket. Best I Ever Ate.

This was delicious, although I did take some advice from other reviewers. I added a can of beer, some garlic and onion to the water before boiling. Than about 45 mins before it was done I took the meat out and put it in the oven with a brown sugar glaze on it (1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tbs melted butter, splash of ketchup) It only took about 30 mins on 350. The veggies stayed in the pot and cooked. After everything was all done I used a little bit of the juice to make a gravy. It all came out really good. I served it with mashed ptts and gravy, and a good crusty roll. Thanks for the recipe and the reviews. Husband loved it!!

This must be the best Irish meal ever. I managed to make this with a 5 quart Crockpot and a stove pot. I recommend a 7 quart Crockpot, as I prefer more potatoes and carrots than normal. You may still need to move the juices to a stove pot to boil the cabbage as it needs room so it stays in the quarters you cut it into rather than just a pile of cabbage leaves. I bought a seasoned packaged corned beef brisket and followed this recipe. I only cook what cabbage I need for each meal as cooked cabbage is not a good leftover. This one has turned into a staple for me.

Made this today for dinner.  Put the spice packet in cheesecloth & tied it with a piece of kitchen string, making it easy to remove at the end of cooking.  I did cook my cabbage longer in the pot though, since we like it soft.  Also added an onion chopped in large pieces in with the veggies.  This was a very flavorful meal!!!

Okay, this was my first time trying corned beef and I wonder why people eat it?  I think the recipe was fine because everything looked good, but the corned beef is really not a flavor that I ever intend to eat again. So I have to give it a one.  It was easy but not a favorite in this house!

It's even better if you toss in 4-5 unpeeled cloves of garlic at the beginning.

This is the best!  Based on a few suggesetions, I added a can of beer and also used 1 can of beef broth/stock to enrich the flavor.

Easy and delicious.  I did add about 1 tablespoon of pickling spice that I placed in a garni bag as there did not seem to be a lot of spices included with the corned beef.

Great recipe. The only thing I do  differently is glaze my corned beef with mustard and brown sugar and broil it before I serve it.

Can't go wrong with this recipe.  I even made some the day before, sliced it up and poured it into a large foil pan with about 1" of the cooking liquid and into the refrigerator.  The next day I reheated in the oven until hot while I made another pot of corned beef and cabbage on the stove for the aromas.  The reheated tray was just as good as the fresh corned beef and it was easier to have some already done.

AB-FAB!!!!!!!!!!!  I made this for the grown-ups at a birthday party at our house on St. Patty's day.  THIS ROCKED!  I had MAJOR compliments and a couple of the husbands told their wives to trash their corned beef recipes because mine was so good!  LOL!  This was melt in your mouth good.  I did mine in the crock pot for about 7 hours, added the cabbage and carrots in about 2 hours before serving (turned the crock pot to high then).  This was ROCKIN' good!  I made the recipe last year with Guiness and brown sugar and this one beats it HANDS DOWN!!  YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  Thank you!

This was SO Delicious! And it smelled SOO Good cooking - I almost couldn't wait to eat it! The only change I made was adding 2 beef bouillion cubes to the water. My pot wasn't big enough for everything, so I took out the corned beef and put in the cabbage - the beef "rested" while the cabbage was cooking; the timing was perfect. (My house still smells SO good! :-) Happy St. Patrick's Day!! This recipe was perfect for tonight's dinner. Thanks!

Yum, yum, yum!  I'm sure I screwed this up, as it was my first time making CB&C.  I started it in the CrockPot because I had to leave, then transferred it to a stockpot when I got back, then back to the CrockPot (with 20+ whole baby carrots, 2 sliced large brown potatoes, and 1 sliced yellow onion).  I used some beef bouillon cubes, some pepper corns, dash of salt, and about 6 whole garlic cloves for simmering the beef (I didn't get a seasoning packet with my meat).  I think for my 3.5 lb cut of meat, I cooked it for a total of 4 hours (with veggies done to crisp-tender).  Left some of the juice in the stockpot to cook up the cabbage, as I couldn't get it all to fit in the CrockPot.  Served hot with some fresh French bread.  Wowzers, this CB&C was dreamy!  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to all the great comments, reviewers!

Very good, cooked corned beef in beef broth. Just before serving I remove the beef and put it in another dish and spread with mix of brown sugar and mustard. Spread that over meat and broil for a minute. Then slice and serve. My family loved it.

Use this simple recipe exactly but in the crock pot. I put the corned beef, water, spices in for a couple hours on high and then add my veggies with cabbage on top for a few more.

As another reviewer mentioned, I trimmed the fat, added a can of beer and garlic to the cooking liquid. Used 1 lb baby carrots about 50 minutes left in cooking, and added a sliced large onion with the cabbage. Delicious!! Will make again next year!

This is how I always do my corned beef. I have also done this in the crock pot on low for 8hrs and then pulled out liquid to boil the veg on the stove. The only thing I would add is to wash the meat off with water before cooking.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! This will be my second time making this dish and I pretty much followed it exactly the way it states. The only thing I do different is, I add two whole onions when I put the corned beef in and leave them in the whole time for a little added flavor. This dish is definitely worth trying, you won't be disappointed!

This recipe easily becomes 5-star with some of the suggestions others have made: throw in some onion and garlic, replace some (or all) of the water with beer. However, I do NOT recommend replacing the water with beef/chicken broth the way others mentioned. Corned beef is so salty to begin with. I tried using a beer and beef broth mixture, and the saltiness of the meat was excessive, so I will not make that mistake again. In fact, next time I might leave out the spice packet and create a lower-sodium mixture of my own to add.

Perfect!  Follow the directions and it will turn out perfectly.  I added my potatoes and carrots after 2 1/2 hours for a 3# brisket.  30 minutes later, I added the cabbage along with salt, pepper, celery salt & seed.  It was excellent!

Very good!  Make sure the pot you are using is HUGE.  I tried with a regular sized one and could not get the veggies in.  I ended up taking out the beef and cooking the veggies in the left over water while the beef rested.  Worked perfectly.  Will make again and again!

I electric pressured cooked mine for 45 minutes. I did however used only 1 1/2 cups of water with corned beef spices (Packet it came with)and used the liquid corned beef came with. After cooked and let steam out carefully, did add the veggies and pressured cooked for 3 min.  The corned beef came out tender and delicious, but I think next time will cook veggies separately with the corned beef broth on top of stove.  The veggies were overcooked, I did use an onion also.  None the less, still delicious.  First time I cooked in electric pressure cooker.  Went back to store and bought 4 more packages of corned beef and put in freezer for future use. This was so easy and delicious.

I had never made CB&C before and was anxious to try it this past St. Patrick's Day for our 9 guests.  This recipe was a great starting point and gave me the confidence to finally do it.   So my rating is more for that than the actual meal, which I prepared as follows:

I bought two 3-1/2 lb. flat cut CB briskets.  I rinsed them and placed them in the oven at 325 for 5 hours until the thermometer read over 160.  I then strained the drippings of as much fat as possible, and poured them over the potatoes & carrots.   Back into the oven (350) til almost tender, at which point I added the cabbage wedges and stirred in about 1/4 cup water, salt & pepper.   It took another 20-some minutes for the vegs to finish.   I sliced the cooled CB and stuck it back in the oven to warm for about 10 minutes before serving everything together.    Very delicious, very easy, and I will definitely make again!

What makes this better is adding a stout beer to the water. I add 3 bottles of beer (I used Laughing Lab) for 2 briskets in a large pot two thirds filled with water on stove. Fabulous!

Best corned beef. I am now enjoying the best corned beef sandwich (leftovers) I ever had. I cooked with one can of Budweiser beer and the rest water, and two tablespoons of pickling spice.  I took out the beef when it was done, wrapped it in aluminum foil and kept warm in the oven, while I cooked the veggies in the broth. Sooooo good, even better the next day.

I made this last night with a few modifications.  I have never eaten corned beef and cabbage so it was a new and exciting experience for us.  I used water as directed but added 1 1/2 heads of garlic and 2 whole onions halfed to the broth.  I also added the spice packet.  I rinsed and dried the beef before putting it into the water.  I also took the beef out after 3 hours of cooking and placed it under foil to rest. During that time I cooked the potatoes and carrots for approx 15 minutes and then added the cabbage for the remaining 3 minutes.  It was perfect.  My 20 month old daughter ate 4 pieces of the beef however my picky 5 year old daughter had issues with the texture of the meat.  All in all I would make again!!

I was very surprised at how easy it was to make.  My potatos could have been cooked longer and the carrots got kinda dry.  I think next time I will just steam the potatos and carrots.  Meat was supper yum.

Great but I also add a bottle of stout!! This totally makes the flavor. I have found adding my Pickeling spice wrapped in cheesecloth works well. Once done coat with stone ground mustard and brown sugar and bake for 15 min! Yum!!

An excellent recipe for a dish that be cooked by a million chefs who all have their own idea about this big "St. Patrick's Day Staple." Enter "Corned Beef and Cabbage" on any search engine and you will get a zillion recipes. This is a keeper.

My husband who has had Corned Beef and Cabbage before said this is the best he's ever tasted, which could also be the corned beef we bought.  I wasn't expecting my kids to like it and all 4 ate it and ate seconds.  This is definately be our St. Patty's Day tradition from now on.

I like to cut the cabbage into serving size wedges and place on top of the corned beef.  Cooking the cabbage for about 12 minutes make it crispy cooked. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe!   I had never made corned beef and cabbage before, but this turned out great.  I added a whole peeled onion and a few peppercorns to the beef while it simmered.  Before adding the cabbage, I took the beef out to rest and wrapped it in aluminum foil to stay warm.  I served this with the Nana Dot’s Irish Soda Bread recipe from this site.  Delicious!

Corned  Beef & Cabbage Haiku: "I can't believe it! I didn't think I'd like this. But, gobble, plate gone." Made loads of Irish-themed food for a St. Patty's party, and this was on the menu and really, I thought I'd just have a nibble, but loe and behold, I obliterated a plate. Only difference we made was leaving out the red potatoes and making a mountainous side of Colcannon instead. What surprised me the most was how much I adored a leftover plate of just the cabbage, sprinkled in Texas Pete hot sauce. DH is thrilled that I'm a CB&C convert.

Very good! Added a beer to meat when simmering, also added an onion and minced garlic with the carrots & potatoes. With these small changes it made for a great classic! Served with rye toast and creamy horseradish. Used left overs to make corned beef hash and eggs for breakfast!

Tracey's version (3-10-08 review) of making a sauce and roasting the meat for 30" after cooking stove top, elevated this recipe to exceptional, in my mind.   My Irish mother would be surprised.

I make corned beef and cabbage every year.  This is a great way to do it.  Comes out so tender and good!  I also add 2 bay leafs and use a bottle or 2 of Guiness w/ the water.  It just adds a little something.

This rocked intensely.  I kept true to the recipe, except I left it in the Dutch Oven a bit longer as in previous years we have had salty shoeleather dissapointments, but not this time.  I went on the web and learned what slicing it across the grain means, and this tender cut of meat fell apart for our enjoyment.  We used the Trader Joe's uncured corned beef in brine and spices which had me alarmed at the sweet quality of the boiling aroma, but by service time was a sharper, smokier taste akin to a clove and mustard rub you would find on a fine ham.  This was amazingly easy, hard to screw up if you have a Dutch Oven and an egg timer, and was served with Guiness Draught beer at our house and consumed with glee.

This is a very good basic recipe. Try adding 1 tsp whole black peppercorns, a bay leaf, 5 whole garlic cloves, and 1 tsp whole mustard seed in a cloth packet or steel mesh ball, and remove from liquid after 90 min of cooking time.

I was visiting with a cousin, and she had a hunk of corned beef brisket sitting in her fridge. Having never cooked one before, I asked her if I could give it a shot. I was pleased with the results, because the food is so homey and yummy. I did not have to buy many ingredients at ALL, and this recipe certainly has room for adaptation to any taste or kitchen. I thought it was great, and everyone else in the house devoured this, too! Now corned beef is not so scary to me, I will be cooking this again!

Was delicious.  I didn't need to do anything different except that I did add a half stick of butter per some of the reviewers.   I couldn't quite fit all the veggies in my crockpot, and my crockpot is pretty big.   I'll be making this again.  Perhaps for a party, no one in the family likes it but me, and this was a lot of food.

We made this for our St. Patrick's Day dinner and it was a huge hit :)  I followed the instructions exactly and everything was done just right, so simple and so good.  The only problem was that I should have doubled everything :)

Followed the directions exactly and everything came out PERFECT!  The Hubster just LOVED this dinner so much!  Said it was the best corned beef he'd ever had.  :)  I made Irish Soda Bread in a Skillet from this site to go with this meal and everything was so delicious.  Thank you for this excellent and simple recipe!  :)

Don't know why someone said the brisket is never tender when cooked this way. I have been doing it for years and it is always fall apart tender!  This may be my most favorite meal.  We have it, cooked just this way, at least once a month, sometimes more!

i made as directed except i used at least half beef broth half water and i cut off most of the fat off of the meat. I added the veggies 1 hr before the meat was done. Wait till later to add cabbage depending on how done you like them. My boyfriend has only had this dish in restaurants and he said this recipe is just as good. Definately a top 3 out of all the meals i've made him ( and we've been together for a long time)

Excellent.  We followed the advice of some others and used beef stock and added lots of garlic and a handful of peppercorns.  Very tastey!

My first experience with cooking corned beef and it was a huge success. I added 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and 3 small onions. My mother doesn't usually eat corned beef and she went back for seconds!

Corned beef and cabbage with potatoes, carrots, and onions is always great.  Thought it was especially good by adding a bottle of beer to the original boil.

Im not Irish but have had Corned Beef and cabbage many times and this is the best way to do it. It doesnt come out stringy or too well put together just right in the middle. You really have to boil Corned Beef. Im going to do it this way for now on. Thanks!

Our corned beef brisket did not come with a seasoning packet, so I just added 1/4 cup of peppercorns and a couple of bay leaves.  This was good, simple fare.  I chose this recipe over others because we planned to use a crockpot / slow cooker for cooking our St. Patty's Day dinner -seeing as we both work.  I put the meat in the bottom, then followed it with the whole potatoes, carrots, and cabbage on the very top.  We set it on low, and came home 10 hours later.  Our biggest question was if the vegetables would be mush by the time we got home.  The potatoes were great, since they were left whole.  The carrots and cabbage were fork tender -almost too soft for my liking- but not a mushy mess.  I would do it this way again next year because of the convenience, but I think that if you can afford the time then cooking the vegetables properly would be worth it.  Maybe next year we will see if one of us can run home at our lunch hour to put the veggies in so they only cook half the day.

Having never made corned beef before this recipe, I was nervous as to how it would turn out. I made it for my husband and some dinner guests, and everyone raved about it!  The only things I did differently was use beef bullion and added some chopped celery. The meat was very tender and everyone had thirds! Thanks for this delicious recipe, we'll definitely be using it next St. Patricks day.

Excellent recipe! I changed it a bit - I used 3 bottles of Harp in addition to the water while the corned beef was cooking. I also added a shot of Bushmills during the last 15 minutes of cooking. We really enjoyed this, and will use again next year!

great recipe. Had to triple it as I was making it for a crowd. Put the meat in roasters to cook and added beer. When it was time for the veggies I added caraway seed as it seems to make the cabbage have less gas if you know what I mean.
Also had to cook the carrots and potatoes longer as I had so many.

Simple but wonderful recipe for corned beef and cabbage. Followed pretty closely except I added two beef bouillon cubes. Also, be sure you buy the flat cut of corn beef (leaner). It's a keeper recipe! Thanks!

I like to add cabbage in at the same time as the other veggies.  I like to put a lot of black pepper and butter on the veggies when eating and drizzle white vinegar on top.  Sooo good.

We made this for St. Patricks Day this year with fabulous results.  I didn't have any beef broth on hand, so I used homemade chicken broth, and it worked so well!  Not overbearing the way beef broth can be sometimes, but enhanced the corned beef seasoning very well.  I also used the leanest cut of corned beef I could find.  Cooked the cabbage a few minutes longer as one woman suggested.  I won't wait until next year to make this again!

I browned it first in olive oil and minced garlic.  I used beef bullion, didn't have broth, with the water.
Used potatoes, onions, carrots and cabbage.  Served with crusty bread!!!  Only problem--didn't get a bigger piece of beef.  Will make again and won't wait for St. Paddy's Day.

This was great.  I was in a hurry and company was about to arrive!  All my other reciepies were tossed to the side.
Although this was a "no brainer" recipe, that's what appealed to me!
We decided to have a St. Pat's party at the last minute.  I was still cleaning house and hadn't started the meal yet.
My son went to the grocerie store with me.  I sent him home with the briskets and beer while I finished shopping.

He put the briskets in the roaster, followed the instructions on the recipe and iced down the beer.

I got the cabbage, carrots and potatoes in the roaster just as company was coming in the door.  It all finnished cooking while I greeted the guests.

Didn't add any spices other than the packet in the brisket just as the recipe said!

I've made this and many other corned beef recipes. I really like the idea of not adding the carrots in the beginning of the recipe ! But like other people have mentioned onions! Yes it still needs a thinly sliced onion at the beginning of cooking time. If you don't like mushy onions, take them out with a slotted spoon before you add the carrots, potatoes and later the cabbage. But they really do add an important flavor profile that corned beef screams for.

Super easy and delicious.  I didn't read the recipe closely and so didn't boil the beef quite long enough and it was still very good - another 30 minutes and it would have melted in my mouth!

Yummy! Wasn't ready in 2 hrs. 35 minutes, though. 3 hours and 15 minutes. My family was tolerant of the delay, though, once they tasted it :-)

I had it on high and added an extra hour for 6lbs. I also used less water and more Stella Artois, it came out delicious, the meat just fell apart, it was beautiful.

This was my first time making corned beef, and it was great! Very tender, and the vegetables were just right. An easy meal since you don't have to do much while everything is simmering.

This was a hit with my family. Even the three year old ate it. I added some minced garlic cloves for some extra flavor. The vegetables are especially good heated up the next day. Delicious!

I didn't actually make this but nobody else who reviewed it seems to have either. This is the most recipe rewriting I have seen in any review. I read 12 reviews and finally gave up as they all were telling about how they make theirs, not about this recipe. Very disappointing. I am heading back to the pressure cooker instructions for this evening's meal.  :-(

basic recipe, but I had no changes, thus the five.  The carrots and potatoes are delicious in the corned beef water which gives them a great flavor.

I used this as my base recipe, but I added peppercorns and three cloves of garlic, smashed, to the pot while the corned beef cooked. I cooked it for 50 minutes per pound in the liquid on the stovetop, then I put it in the oven for one hour and baked. It came out wonderful. my mom adds brown sugar for the oven baking part of the process, but I didn't want the added sugar. I cooked the cabbage and potatoes and carrots in the liquid while the corned beef cooked in the oven.

I plan on trying this recipe today, one thing I change though is how I cook the corned beef. I place my corned beef in a oven bag. I found it prevents the meat from shrinking and is so tender. After letting it cool, I will add the spices from the bag into the potatoes and carrots. This also aides in slicing the corned beef so much easier.

This was amazing! Used a bottle of beer plus water, other than that, I followed the recipe. We weren't ready to eat when this was done and it kept nicely for an hour or so on low on the stove. I will definitely make this again! Sooo easy and good!

This I my first time with corned beef.   Everything had a good flavor, but I found the meat to have a bit of a rubbery texture.  I assume that's from being boiled????  Boy friend loved it!!

I've been cooking for over 50 years now, and this is the BEST corned beef I've ever made! Followed suggestions from other reviewers about adding onion, and especially adding the glaze for the last 40 minutes in the oven. I'll never make it any other way. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

First time ever making corned beef and cabbage and it turned out great.  Only thing I would change is the cooking time for the cabbage - mine seemed a bit overcooked for my liking.  Next time I'll use a large head/wedges or maybe reduce cooking time but at least 5 minutes.

I made this for St. Pats day. It was the first time I have ever made corned beef and cabbage. It is a simple recipe and the family loved it. My 17 month old kept eating the cabbage and the corned beef. I also agree with another and think that the ratio of carrots and potatoes are perfect!

Absolutely delicious and easy peasy to prepare.  The ONLY variation on this recipe was I allowed the beef to boil first so I could skim the slime off the top (as suggested by another reviewer) then I added the spice packet and set it to simmer.  The house smells devine and on this rainy St. Patricks the window are steamy and cozy is the house.

Usually we have this with a ham shoulder butt and it's really great. I thought I would try it this year with the corned beef and I must say I was very disappointed. I guess the fact that the corned beef was boiled had something to do with it as I have never been much of a fan of boiled meat. Also, the ham is already cooked when you buy it so it really just needs to be in the pot for as long as it takes for the cabbage and the potatoes to cook. I am definately going back to the ham next time.

This was my first time making cabbage and corned beef. I did add a couple things like a little apple cider vinegar and seasoned salt. But other than that. Very easy and the family loved it.

I love this! I also add polish sausage at end (I use Echrich). It picks up those juices and is great. Leaves more corned beef for sandwiches.

This was great and my first time making Corned Beef and Cabbage. I didn't realize I had a seasoning packet so I started out by sauteing in olive oil some garlic, basil, coriander, mustard  thyme and allspice. Then I added the included spice mix. It was very tasty and not overly spiced

I made this for the first time for St. Patricks Day and it was great...and easy.  However I think the spice packet isnt enough so next time I will add more spices to it.  And also, i will cook cabbage separate because you can make an awesome gravy for it out of the juices. Plus alot of people dont like cabbage.

Not a big fan of corned beef, but this came out great.  Everyone loved it.  Simmered it in beef broth and took the suggetion of another reviewer and baked in oven with a brown sugar glaze.

Cooked in Guiness/water mix.  Also, used Snake River Farms Kobe Corned Beef.  Pulled Corned beef out after 3 hours and seared in oven for 10 minutes at 500 degrees.  Then let rest  Wow!!!

I loved the variation that finished the brisket in the oven w/sauce, although I omitted the brown sugar. This was my first time making this, and it was so easy and so good! Thank you allrecipes and Tracey (Mar 2008)! Oh, I also used beef broth instead of water - delish!

This dish was a total hit with the entire family (extended family included!) and we only have a couple of potatoes to show for it.  I added 1 onion, 2 bay leaves, a tablespoon of whole peppercorns and an entire bulb of garlic (peeled whole) to our 3.25 round of corned beef.  It was the tasty and tender and everyone raved over it with every bite that they took.  They want me to make it again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Cooked it exactly as written (with one small exception - I couldn't fit everything in one pot,  so I dad to yank out the corned beef before the veg went in) and it was perfect!  I wouldn't change a thing.

This was my first time to make corned beef and cabbage.
 I went with a couple of recommendations from other reviews, I used 3 bottles of bock beer with about the same amount of water and 3 bullion cubes along with about 6 garlic cloves and a bay leaf, cooked the veggies per the original recipe and, served with stone ground mustard on the side. I took the beef out just before I put the cabbage in to keep the wedges whole. 
Everybody loved it and my wife gave it her blessing for future runs. 
Going to make corned beef hash with the leftovers.

Good basic recipe. (It is however an Irish American recipe not a traditional Irish recipe - still it is catching on in Ireland) The key to the recipe is "low and slow". I find it is better done in the oven at 275 degrees (go take a long nap).

Fixed this tonight & enjoyed wholeheartedly.  In celebration of St. Paddy's Day, in lieu of water or broth, I covered 3 lb. beef with Guiness Beer... just this once.   This corned beef is also wonderful served with Ethiopian Cabbage Dish.  Thanks to both cooks who shared these two recipes.

Wonderful recipe!!  I was always taught to make a recipe exactlyl as printed the first time I prepared it.  So, my only additon to this wonderful dinner was the addition of a can of lager beer.  Oh, I also added some turnip (almost forgot).  A fine meal that I would serve to anyone. Thank's.

Basic and nothing new or different about this recipe.  My husband loves it.  I'm not a boiled cabbage fan.  I prefer to eat the corned beef with colcannon.  The corned beef is delicious with mustard tarragon cream sauce.

Made two of these on Sunday (one for us, one for Father-in-law).  When my husband asked me to make it I hesitated as I had always had a hard time either meat was too tough or veggies too mushy.  This was perfect.  Still need to figure out best time to add veggies; waited too long this time and just had to keep an eye on them so they didn't get too mushy.

awesome! I never made this was corned beef - I always used a cottage roll. The only thing I did differently was add turnip along with the potatoes and carrots as well as collard greens and cabbage. My family loves this meal!!

YUM! Really enjoyed making this, never made it before. I was surprised at how moist the meat was, every time I cook meat it seems to get dry. I cooked the corned beef in beef broth and def. had a lot of flavor.

We enjoyed this very much. I also did what some reviewers suggested and used beef broth instead of water. (I used reduced sodium). IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE BEEF STEW OR RESEMBLE IT IN any way, as someone said. I recommend a flat cut of beef instead of point cut. My corned beef did not have a spice packet so I threw in some whole black peppercorns, a bay leaf, some mustard seed , and whole allspice.  Served with horseradish sauce.  This recipe was r simple and good and will replace my other corned beef and cabbage recipe.

This was the best corned beef and cabbage I have ever eaten. I didn't have enough room in my pot to boil the cabbage, so I took some of the cooking liquid and used it to steam the cabbage in a different pot. I also added an onion.

Did as another person suggested and removed it from the pot and finished it in the oven with a sauce for 30 min. This was fantastic. The sauce really is a great finish. Fussy eater approved!

So freaking good!!! I've made it twice now and it was awesome each time! I boiled it in all the chicken broth I had then a little water. I added some butter and 4 or 5 cloves of minced garlic while it simmered. I added a yellow onion with the vegetables (because I love onions) It's tender, flavorful, smells amazing, and is great left over. I'll be making this one again and again

I used three beers and a box of beef broth instead of water. Everything else I did the same. We loved this recipe. My husband couldn't stop talking about it.

I prepare my corned beef pretty much the same way, and my familly loves it.  The only thing that I do different is that I prepare a tomato sauce to go with it.  I do not have measurements to go by, it is just to our taste.  Petite diced tomatoes (large can), vinegar, crushed red pepper, and a good amoung of sugar.  I also fry corn bread to go along with it, and this is simple too.  white corn meal, mostly butter milk, salt, oil for frying.  the mixture should not be too thick or too thin, and the salt is the hardest to get right.  Anyway we love the Irish dish of corned beef and cabbage, it is wonderful.

Made this for a dinner party of six tonight and turned out tasting good but even after cooking for almost 4 hour at 200* the meat just wasn't as tender as I'd hoped it would be. I will try it again and see if it gets any better.

This is SO EASY. The piece of meat you use makes all the difference. Don't skimp and buy cheap meat, pick one which is well marbled.

This recipe was very easy and the corned beef was excellent.  The cabbage had a nice flavor, too.  The potatoes and carrots were just all right.  Both were bland; I can't blame that on the recipe, though.  I thought the flavor didn't really penetrate those two veggies.  I'll try less water next time.

This is a great for the crockpot!! I add some chopped up cabbage with the meat to add flavor.  I also add fresh string beans with the rest of the veggies! I've never used beer but I plan on trying it!

This was a very easy and delicious way of preparing corned beef.  I used "flat cut" per the meat dept employee suggestion, as opposed to "point cut" (which is more fatty, and what I've used in the past).  This may be why we liked it so much more than the other recipes I've used, but I'll definitely use this recipe again...  and more often than just on St. Patricks Day!

This was the BEST corned beef & cabbage I've ever had and it was pretty easy!  I've always made it in a crock pot and I'm sure this recipe could be done that way too, but as long as I have the time I will continue to use this recipe on the stove top!  The changes I made, based on the suggestions of others are as follows: Add 2 bottles of beer to the water to cover the brisket (I used harp), I also added 4 garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves, ground mustard, largely chopped onion and whole peppercorns in the begining.   Lastly, I added celery and green beens when I put the cabbage in just b/c I had them on hand and my husband wanted them.   It took about 3-3.5 hrs to cook, but it was well worth it. My husband even ate all the cooked carrots and he doesn't usually like those.  Great recipe, thanks!

I made this for dinner last night with high expectations following the suggestions of other reviewers - added garlic cloves, peppercorns, 10/5 ratio of vegetables, etc. I replaced the water with beef broth (the fat free, low sodium) and this made the vegetables practically inedible due to all the salt.  Not sure where I went wrong but beef broth was not the right call. The meat was tasty though - salty- but its corned beef! Perhaps next time not as much broth and I will cook the vegetables separately.

this is agood basic recipe, I add oinions and dry mustard with garlic. Also the last hour, I pull the corn beef out to add the veggies...while the veggies are cooking I place the corn beef in my smoker for the last hour, smoke with hickory,mosquite and cherry chips.  peel the tougher larger outside cabbage leaves off and retainer whole for the serving plate.  I plate in a very large turkey style plate with corn beef in the middle,rim the outside edge of the plate with the outside leaves of the cabbage and  place the veggies on the cabbage leaves.  PS - you can't put in enoght carrots....  again a good basic recipe adjust to get your own version....

Just so-so. Seemed rather bland. Perhaps adding additional seasoning and cooking in beer would have helped.

Perfect corned beef.  I definitely recommend covering the beef in beer instead of water.  The beef comes out perfectly tender.

Everyone at my friend Karen's St. Patty's Day party loved this. She did the cooking and I'm doing the reviewing. Karen wanted to thank "Cooker476" for her advice. I'm not a meat eater, but I took a taste and it was moist, tender and very delicious. Thank you Laria from all of us!

Great recipe!  As suggested by a couple of the other reviewers, I used a can of beer (Guiness) in addition to the water to cover the meat.  It was wonderful!  I also added some onion to the veggie mix at the end.  Very easy recipe to follow.  Yummy!

After boiling the meat for 4 hours it did not look appetizing.  But the corned beef tasted very good. The cabbage and potoates were good. I would omit the carrots next time.

Used two cans of Guinness instead of water...made the broth nice and tasty. Nice cooking method...... will probably do again. Will use more meat though so we have leftovers for Rubens ;)

We enjoy this meal.  I add some chicken bouillon cubes to the water and a little butter it just adds more flavor.  I also added onions and garlic powder.

The results of this recipe seem to depend largely on the quality of the spice packet that comes with the corned beef.  I liked the enhancements in several of the reviews.

I made this dish for the first time and my husband and 11-yr old son loved it!  I did substitute the water with the low sodium beef broth as others had recommended.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  I loved that it was easy to prepare and I could basically leave it for a couple of hours.  I can't wait to make it again.

Fantastic and easy to prepare and cook.  Most enjoyable with corn bread.  A little dash of butter (1 stick - after fully cooked) ads an additional boast of flavor.  Served over rice and of course some tabassco .... WOW !

Both my wife and I love corned beef. This receipe was wonderful. Although you have to cook the meat a long time it is worth the wait. I served it with little Yukon Gold potatoes (not peeled) carrots, and of course cabbage. Instead of putting the veggies into the water with the meat I steamed them over the cooking meat until tender.

This was SO GOOD! I was a bit nervous because it was my first time ever making corned beef but my  boyfriend and I loved it. Just lots of salt and pepper throughout the cooking process and it's amazing how just a few baby potatoes and carrots can taste! Lengthy cooking time period but this will be a staple winter dinner in our house. I added lots of onion powder in the boiling water which was cooking the corned beef, just thought it sounded good.

Really great recipe. I also used beef broth. I think it makes a big  difference over using water. Also boiled the vege’s after removing the meat. 15 min with on a strong boil gave me firm  but not crunchy vegetables. I also saved the juice from the corned beef and boiled more vegetables in the juice since then.  Makes for a great low-fat lunch  This is a keeper!

Usually cook the cabbage & veggies separately.  This was a different approach.  Family enjoyed the changes and new flavors .  Will use this again.

When cooking Corned Beef and Cabbage in a liquid, it is almost impossible to screw anything up, unless you let it go dry & burn it. Don't forget to add a bay leaf to the liquid, sit back & take a nap. Oven baking is a little more work & requires closer attention then cooking in liquid.

Great recipe! The only change I made was adding onions to the cabbage and simply adding a light brown sugar coating to the steaming corned beef while it’s resting. It cools to a light caramelized state and no other sauce is needed as it adds a slightly sweet dimension to the salty meat. I will make this a house special.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I read through the reviews, as I always find them to be helpful and really expand my creativity, and chose to incorporate a few tips to elevate the dish. I used Guiness beer and beef broth instead of water, added 3 cloves minced garlic from the start and 1/2 stick of butter later with the cabbage. Thanks to the author and those who commented for bringing back my childhood memories of this traditional comfort food, and for making my husband smile.

It's always been a tradition for my mother-in-law to make corned beef and cabbage for St. Patrick's Day but she is ill and unable to cook and can't convey how she made it.
I tried this recipe and even though my husband was a little skeptical he said it was really good. 
Even my picky eater grand daughter ate it.
I don't like corned beef but I love the vegetable that are cooked with it.
We may not wait a full year to have this again.

I have never used a recipe for this dish before, but it makes sense. The timing of the vegetables and, as another reviewer pointed out, the amount of vegetables to help with the salt was key. Made as written, with the exception of adding a bottle of beer. Mmm..beer...
Thanks for posting

This is basically the recipe that I have used for at least 40  years.  This is what I do differently.  First, I trim most of the fat from the corned beef.  Then I put in a large pot with water to cover.  I bring the water to a boil, then I pour it off & start over with fresh water. Thus I have never had over-salty corned beef.  I add an onion studded with 4 or 5 cloves, a few peppercorns, a couple of bay leaves & the spice packet.  After the water boils I turn the heat down to simmer & cook until it's fork tender, 2-3 hours depending on size of beef.  When beef is done I cover & keep warm.  I use russet potatoes (they work just fine) and cook in half tap water, half corned beef water. When done I add butter & fresh chopped parsley.  Carrots are cooked in half tap water, half corned beef water.  Served with butter & a wee bit of brown sugar if the carrots are "old".  Cabbage cut into wedges, cooked in half tap water, half corned beef water with a few caraway seeds.  Cooked until crisp-tender so it's still green.  Sometimes add butter to smooth it out a bit..
Serve with sour cream /yogurt /horseradish sauce with a bit of dill weed in it.   Last year had 3 guests who had never had corned beef & cabbage before.  Were they ever impressed & jumped at the chance to come again this year.

Classic recipe that I've been making for years. It is delicious by itself cooked exactly as described but after reading a few reviews, I chose to follow a review and used beef broth instead of water, added 1/2 stick of butter and 3 garlic cloves to the cooking liquid. I have always added the potatoes & carrots about an hour before the meat was expected to be done. When the meat is done, move it to a plate and cover to rest,  then add the cabbage (plus 1 yellow onion cut into wedges) to the liquid and cook about 15-20 minutes until done.  

One more suggestion to offer along side the horsraddish sauce upon serving... is VINEGAR! I love a splash of vinegar on my cabbage. Don't discount the tip until you 've tried it.

there was no spice pkg in my Corned beef so first off, I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to write your reviews.  without you, I would have been lost.  I love reading how you switched up the recipes.   there would be no reason to write reviews at all if you simply followed the directions as written.   we could all just rate it by clicking the hearts.  so please don't listen to those grumpy people who tell you to write your own recipe.  I'd never find it.  thank you for all the great ideas.

Such an easy yummy dinner.

I cooked this on the stove top for 3 and a 1/4 hours total (fat side up covered in water).  15 Minutes to bring it to boil and then 50 minutes per pound and 20 minute for the potatoes, carrots (and added onion).  The last 10 minutes of that 20 I added in the cabbage.  Meat was tender and veggies perfectly cooked.  Cooking the veggies in the water with the meat gives you a great flavorful light broth.

Spicy horseradish and/or mustard is fantastic with it.

Pf. 3 hours?! Try 6...  I had an almost 3lb flat cut, fat side up, covered in water and  added onions and the season packet to the dutch oven. Brought to boil then turned to LOW and covered for 3 hours as directed. When I came back in three hours it was still completely tough!!!Good thing I started it early, because I had to put it in the oven on at 225 and continue to cook for another 3 hours, it was fall off the fork tender at this point. As far as flavor, it was meh, boiled meat. I had to add salt to the broth to cook the potatoes and carrots. I'll prob try another recipe next time...

Simple is better. I made the dish according to the recipe, and it came out delicious. It was easy to make, and did not require a lot of prep work. This is going in my recipe collection for sure!

I made it as written before making small changes. I subbed chicken broth for water. Didn't need to add any salt. Beef and veggies came out very flavorful. Also added garlic, onion and carrots to the cabbage.

Wow! This was so easy and my family LOVED it! I mostly followed this recipe except we LOVE garlic so I added a few teaspoons, 1 can of beer and I cooked the cabbage separately. It was in the crockpot for about 9 hours. It was the BEST I have ever made. Served with Irish soda bread. Mmmmmmmmmmm good! Thank goodness I made TWO since the first was gone at dinner and we need to have Rubens tomorrow!! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Great recipe!  Loved it!  Made it just like recipe.  Only I took out my potatoes and carrots when they were cooked and placed in a bowl with broth, then continued cooking the meat with the cabbage for last 15 minutes.

I made this recipe and doubled serving size to feed 10. I put 2 corned beef briscuits (3lbs ea) in my Dutch oven. Covered with the can beef broth 14.5 oz, half a can of beer ( I used Budweiser) and the rest water. Added 2 cloves minced garlic and seasoning. Cooked covered. Removed meat after 3 hrs to rest added cut potatoes and carrots to cooking liquid. Cooked 25 min added cabbage and covered. Cooked 25 minutes more, sliced meat and served! My family loved it. Tender and full of flavor.

I use the same ingredients, but place it in a pressure cooker for 45-60 minutes.  Meat is fork tender and the meat flavor is infused into the vegetables.

Corned beef was excellent. Potatoes, carrots & cabbage were just OK, but I think that's just a personal opinion.  Would make again using just the meat & use for reuben sandwiches!  So good.

Great recipe - nice and easy and turned out great!  I added an onion and 1tsp. minced garlic to water while boiling/simmering meat.  I used one of those metal ball thingies to put the pickling spices in since I didn't buy a packaged meat that comes with spice packet.  Plus, I don't like all those spices floating all over my meat and veggies and then trying to eat around them.  I had a 2.72 lb piece of meat and put on for 2.5 hours.  At 2 hours I added the potatoes and carrots, cooked for 15 minutes and then added cabbage and cooked until cabbage was desired texture/doneness (another 15 minutes).  Wallah!

Just like the way I have always made it. I do save two cups of the juice and add 1/4 cup of cold water with two heaping tablespoons cornstarch. Bring to boil and season for gravy, much better than just juice!

Made as stated, and the beef was as tender as any I've made!  After letting it rest for 15 - 20 minutes, I didn't even have to hold onto it with a fork to slice it.  Wonderful!  I added the spice packet, but feel it could be a bit more flavorful (could have been the brand of the corned beef).  May try changing up the liquid a bit next time (beer or broth), or adding additional pickling spices to the broth.
Thanks for posting!

I made this for my family yesterday.  It was a hit.  I thought it was a little salty, but nobody else did.  I did use beef broth.  Next time I think I will just use water as recommended by the original writer of the recipe.  I also added beer.  Not sure if it enhanced the flavor or not.  Maybe a dark beer would have been better.  Really, it was easy and delicious.  What more could you ask??? It's a keeper.

I tried to be true to this recipe in order to give it an honest review, though I couldn't resist adding celery chunks and finely chopped onions.  I used only water just so I would know how it is that way.  I ended up cooking it low and very slow - I'd say it was on the stove nearly 5 hours.  It didn't hurt it any!  It was fabulous!  Tender and so savory.  I have to agree with some who said it is a little bland.  That, along with COOKER476's recommendation of sour cream, chives and horseradish is how my fantastic gravy was born!  Try it and you'll LOVE it:  ladle out a few cups of the meat liquid at the time you add cabbage.  Dissolve 1 tsp Better Than Bouillon Organic Beef Base into that hot liquid.  Use this as your liquid for making a butter roux (look it up if you don't know what a roux is).  Add a good sprinkle of fresh or dried chopped chives during cooking.  When it's a good consistency, remove from heat and add a dollop of sour cream and horseradish by the half teaspoon until you are happy with the taste.  I DARE you to try it.  This was my first go at corned beef and cabbage and my success is a testament to the reliability of this recipe.  My husband even had to admit it was good after promising me he wasn't going to like such a yucky-sounding dish!

Decent, basic recipe that is simple to do and produces a good outcome.  The kids inhaled it, so it must be good, right?

My husband lead the cooking effort on this recipe and we both really enjoyed the result! I don't often eat corned beef; hubby likes to make this recipe for St. Patrick's Day. I now look forward to this annual tradition and may even make it more frequently throughout the year. We liked the addition of veggies and appreciated the direction on cooking times and temps. Thanks, Laria!

WOW!! This is the best corned beef I've ever tasted!  Very tender & loved the vegetables with it.  In fact, I only had/used half a cabbage because that's all I had, and I never cared for cabbage anyway.   After tasting it, I really wished I'd used extra--I could eat cabbage fixed this way every day.  Per reviews, I added a bottle of beer, several cloves of garlic & pepper corns after trimming most of the fat from the meat.  Thanks so much for sharing--this is a definite keeper.

I made this for St Pats day this year, followed the recipe as-is, except I used 2 bottles of Guiness as well as water.  I was very happy with the results, I will definitely do this one again.

Perfect!!  This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage and it was one of the best I've ever eaten!!  The only thing I changed was using Yukon gold potatoes, cut in large pieces, instead of red.  Thanks for sharing!!

I used this recipe but threw it in the crockpot. I let the meat slowly cook over about 12 hours. It is so tender and delicious. I have never been able to pull this off before. This recipe is easy! Thank you!

This was my first time making corned beef and I'll be making it often!  I had no idea it was as easy as boiling water....literally.  I didn't have carrots but otherwise made the recipe as written.  Cooking the potato and cabbage with the meat gave everything such good flavor.

This was the best Corned Beef I've ever had!!  For years my husband wants me to cook this for St. Patrick's Day and every year I cringe.  I've been doing it in the crock-pot all these years, but never again.  Boiling is the way to go. It was so tender and flavorful.  I did add some garlic to the water and then after 2 1/2 hours I took the meat out and drained 3/4 of the water from the carrots and potatoes and layed wedges of cabbage on top, I don't like boiled cabbage, steamed is best in my book:)  Hubby is loving me tonight!!  Thank you.

Absolutely perfect recipe!!!  Even if you don't eat carrots, include them anyway.  They end up being the best tasting carrots of your life, bar none! Too often corned beef is not cooked long enough.  So be careful and err on the side of cooking more rather than less.  Not possible to put a time on that, but you should know when it's at its most tender.  Bravo, Laria.  Great recipe.

This was excellent!!!  I added an onion thinking the recipe called for it.  Guess I get confused after looking at so many different recipes.  From now on, this is the only way I will cook corned beef.  Can't wait to use the leftover meat and potatoes to make corned beef hash.

Don't know how this recipe works with a Dutch Oven but DO NOT COOK IN POT! Came out VERY dry. And as far as the veggies go, there wasn't enough room in the pot to cook them. Needed to remove the meat first then put the veggies back in. Also, recipe did not mention having to turn the heat back up to cook the veggies. Next year, I'll try the Dutch Oven!

This is basically the same recipe that I use every year. I always make it in a crock pot. So much easier. I don't quite cover it all the way with water. You can, but you may end up with too much broth.  One thing I do, is to cut off all the visible fat on the beef. When I buy the ones that are already seasoned, they usually seem too salty to me, so I rinse them, to try and reduce the sodium. Super easy recipe!

I put the seasoning packet ingredients into a tea ball or cheese cloth because I don't like the seeds all over the other ingredients.
Also add some pearl onion or a quartered onion stuck with toothpicks.
The meat takes only 45 minutes in the pressure cooker.

this was just as i remember it to be growing up.  as for the person who was incensed because the directions say to add the "spice packet" they are found inside the package of corned beef brisket you purchase at the store.  if you dont have one you probably made your corned beef from scratch and already have added the necessary spices although i suspect that is quite a lengthy process.

Great Recipe!  My husband has been making it this way for years!  This year, while shopping at our local meat market, they suggested adding soda bread. An Irish bread.  He bought a couple of loaves. Delicious!! This wil definitely be a new tradition for St. Patrick's Day in our home.

I used a large pot and it was not big enough to fit everything.  I had to boil some of my potatoes and carrots seperately.  I had a hard time gauging when my corned beef was done and I felt it was a little tough.  I wish I would have cooked this slow and low in a crockpot, I feel this would have been more tender.  The cabbage needs about 30 mins to cook.  I also used a can of beer with the water.

This was my first try at a Corned Beef & Cabbage dish...Everyone loved the Corn Beef Brisket!  However,  only a few enjoyed the cabbage...I think maybe it was just that they didn't like cabbage at all...It was easy to make!

I make corned beef and cabbage once a year because my husband likes it. I've never been a big fan. When I saw this recipe I read some of the reviews and thought Tracy's sounded interesting. I will never make corned beef the old way again!  The sauce was  amazing! my husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I enjoyed it much better this way also. Thank you Tracy.

This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage and it came out all right. The meat was tender and juicy but something was missing from the flavor. When I make this again I will add garlic most definately and some other seasonings as well. Also, I like the idea of finishing it off in the oven with a glaze. Boiled meat needs more than a seasoning packet.

This was simply delicious.  Made a few changes by using two cups of water to cover the corned beef and draining all the liquid at the end.  I then sliced my meat placed it back in the crockpot added a small jar of Heinz homestyle Savory Beef Gravy.

I was looking for a simple quick recipe for some corned beef I picked up at the store. This was perfect because I wanted to add vegetables to the mix without cooking it for 8 hours in a crock pot. Unfortunately I didn't think to get cabbage, but I added onions and celery to the mix and turned out great. Best part is the smell you get while it's cooking! Definitely couldn't wait all day!

We aren't giant corned beef fans, but I did try this recipe for St. Patrick's Day being as we're very Irish.  The corned beef aside, the vegetable were delicious!   We loved them.  They didn't last long at all.  I think I'd buy the corned beef again just to season the veggies.

Very simple recipe, with great results! However, I do recommend a longer cooking time to get more tender meat. Also, I prefer the cabbage less crunchy, so I added it at the same time as the other vegetables.

I tried this recipe using garlic and beer, per some of the reviews listed and it was the worse thing I could have done.  I've been making corned beef for over 40 years and thought I would try something different.  I will never again stray from my recipe again.  The meal was totally bland and basically awful.  The corned beef had no flavor and the cabbage and potatoes were watery tasting.  My husband tried to be nice and said it was good, but it was terrible.   I'm giving the above recipe 5 stars since I did not use it as it was written.

I followed the recipe except for the red potatoes. Instead I made garlic mashed potatoes. I used the sauce recipe like viewer Tracey did and it turned out so good. Better than the Irish pub we went to. The sauce is what made the dish so good.

They only left one thing out, strain the broth BEFORE you add the vegetables to take out the pickling spices. Then you will have the perfect boiled Irish dinner (not served in Ireland, by the way).

I followed the instructions and took the advice of some other reviewers. I substituted the water with a bottle of dark beer (not guiness) and beef broth. I also added garlic,onions, dash of salt, about a teaspoon of sugar, dash of paprika and pepper. I served with a horseradish sauce and it was such a hit. My BF was having corned beef and cabbage for the first time and loved it. He ate the leftovers the next couple of days for lunch.

Been using my own recipe for years & never quite came out "great". This year I needed to make a lot for about 24 guests.  Used 3 pots!  Each & every one came out perfect. About 1/2 hr before meat cooking time was up I added potatoes, 5 mins later, the carrots (I used large ones cut into quarters not julienned), and last, about 15 mins later, I added cabbage wedges.  I let it all cook till vegs tender. Perfect!

Adding the potatoes and carrots was a great idea.  I took others advise and substituted beer (Miller Lite) for water.  This was my husband's first time eating corned-beef and he did really enjoy it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at corned beef and cabbage and it was EXCELLENT.  I followed the suggestions of reviewer COOKER476 and added a can of beer to the boiling water, in addition to the spice pace and some garlic.  I also made her horseradish cream which I adjusted a little to taste, but I thought it was wonderful on the corned beef.  This is my husband's new favorite meal.  We really loved it!

This was the best corned beef I have ever made or eaten, hands down. Even though I cooked things way longer than needed, everything stayed moist, juicy and flavorful. What a deal for a one-pot meal, it's truly delicious. My only change to the recipe was cooking it with beef stock instead of water.

This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage, and it came out great!  I personally like my "broth" to have a bit more flavor to it, so I added a few things to the water.  I added 1/2 bottle of beer (had Harpoon UFO Heifenweizen on hand, but just about any will work), about 10 peppercorns, 1 tsp dried rosemary, 5 bay leaves, 1/2 sliced white onion, 2 tsp minced garlic, and a handful of cloves.  With about 30 minutes left, I added the cabbage wedges and carrots.  I personally like potatoes to have more flavor, so I cooked them separately and added a few things.  I took 1-1/2 pounds of baby red potatoes, sliced them in half and cooked them in boiling water for about 12 minutes.  Then I mixed in 1/3 stick of butter, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp dried parsley flakes, and salt and pepper to taste (I melted the butter and pre-mixed the ingredients, then added it all to the potatoes).  I then served potatoes with the beef, cabbage, and carrots.  I also served it with a side of french bread.  This really was incredible... thanks for such an easy recipe!

Fantastic!  This was my first time making corned beef and cabbage for my Irish husband who has had it for every St. Patrick's Day since he was born!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.

This is the classic stuff and was very good. The flavor needed a little salt, but other than that, was perfect. The cabbage heads were small, so I used two of them.

Second time I'm making this recipe. It's excellent. I always double the recipe and use Jamie Oliver's Bubble & Squeak for leftovers. Corned Beef is eaten by Irish Americans so shame on those who left 1 star. 

FYI: According to the History Channel, Irish immigrants who came to the United States in the “mid-to-late 19th century” started using brisket instead of bacon when making the dish.

    “Irish immigrants living on New York City’s Lower East Side substituted corned beef for their traditional dish of Irish bacon to save money. They learned about the cheaper alternative from their Jewish neighbors.”

This was such an easy recipe for me, a first-time Corned Beef and Cabbage cooker!  I read through the other reviews and followed some recommended modifications: First, I added a bottle of beer.  Second, when the meat was done, I put it in an oven-safe dish, topped it with a little bit of brown sugar, added some of the broth and roasted it for a few minutes while the potatoes and cabbage cooked in the boiling broth.  I took the meat out to settle during the last few minutes of veggie cook time.  Really great!

Very good, simple and the way I have always made it. I do alter the cooking time a little. I let the meat simmer basically all day. I add all the veggies about 3 hours before I will be serving dinner. Always perfect.

After cooking the brisket, make a glaze with brown sugar, dry mustard, powdered cloves (just a titch) and vinegar.  (Sorry I don't know the amounts, I just improvise and taste.) Slather glaze over the cooked brisket and put under broiler for a few minutes.  St. Patrick would say "Heavenly"!

I'd suggest treating this like a Boeuf Bourguignon.  Cook in red wine - or 1/2 wine 1/2 water.  I also add more whole mustard & bay leaves.    After cooking, remove meat & veggies.  Reduce the remaining broth by 1/2.    In a separate bowl, Mix enough flour with 1/4c. melted butter to make a firm paste.  Add this to the reduced wine to thicken & for flavor.  If the wine sauce is still runny, dissolve a little gelatin in cold water then add to the sauce.  Granted this makes a more french version of the classic Irish dish, but your taste buds will be pleased!

very basic and easy for those who have never made corned beef before, I did add some extra spices, like peppercorns and garlic as well as a can of beer with the water. Was a hit, thanks.

Simple yet fantastic.  Only change I made: I added 2 bottles of Heineken to the pot in the beginning.  I wish I had used a stout instead.    I second the reviewer who said that the "10/5" ratio for potatoes to carrots works splendidly for a 3 lb. roast.  And when it says 5 carrots, it means large carrots.

This recipe was wonderful! Very flavorful. I left mine cooking on low for a longer amt of time to make sure it was tender. I added white wine (no beer in the house), onions and 3 cloves chopped garlic for some extra flavor. My husband raved about it, and there isn't a bite left- he ate 3 plates full! Will definitely make this again.

I too use beer (48 ounces Downtown Brown) this really helps to reduce that too salty taste.  I just bring to a boil on the stove, cover and reduce to simmer for 3 hours.  I like to serve cornbread with it.  I brown 3 sliced of bacon on the stove and add about 1/2 tablespoon of the bacon grease to the Jiffy cornbread mix.

Thanks for the recipe!

Simple (and great) but can be improved by anyone's choice of extra spices to add with the already included/required packet.... and, of course, some heady beer to that broth!

I wish my husband liked corned beef because this was a great recipe and I'd like to make it more often. Putting the cabbage in right at the end is such an improvement on my Mom's technique of cooking it the whole time the meat cooks (yuck!).

This was my first time making corned beef & cabbage & I was really proud of myself it was great. My husband doesn't like cabbage so I had to eat the whole dinner myself and loved every bite of it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I cooked this according to the directions, except I added 2 cubes of chicken bouillon to the water when cooking the beef.  The vegetables and broth turned out perfectly.  The meat, however, was dissapointing.  I'm not sure if it was my piece of meat or not, but it was extremely fatty in the middle.  I would suggest cutting it into smaller pieces so it will all get cooked evenly.  I might make this again, but only in that way.

This was really good.  The corned beef turned out dry, so I don't know if 50 min per lb was too long, but still it was tasty.  I used red cabbage to add color to the plate. I made this as a surprise on the one year anniversary of our trip to Ireland. My husband was very pleased!

This was pretty good, but very salty. I thought it smelled better than it tasted, and the meat was still very tough. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I probably won't try it again.

delicious!  JUst like Mom used to make.  My husband especially liked it.  He said it was really hearty.  I gave 5 stars for quickness because I consider the prep time to be the most important.  This couldn't have been easier.  I 
added baby carrots and 2 onions quartered.

This recipe was very easy. It tasted okay but was basically pretty bland. It also made a TON of food. Significantly more than the 5 servings listed. I served it at a Football Party and 8 people ate it. I had leftovers for 2 days!!

Very easy to make and it came out DELICIOUSLY!!! My husband loves corned beef & cabbage and he was impressed. I think next time I'll add more meat. But, since we ran out of corned beef before cabbage mixture (I did not combine them) I used the cabbage mixture as leftovers with a regular & cajun kielbasa. Talk about goodness!!!

Really good recipe. I found my 3lb brisket got done a lot sooner than expected. It hit 160F so I pulled it out and let it rest and put the veggies in to cook. I also put in a bottle of beer with the liquid which helps the broth tremendously.

This recipe is so easy you would never expect it to be so delicious.  I really don’t think you could mess it up if you tried.

The was the first time I've made or even had corned beef and cabbage but thought I'd give it a try for St. Patrick's Day.  My family loves spicy food so this was a HUGE disappointment-about the blandest meal I've ever cooked!  I followed the directions exactly and refrained from adding anything else for flavor even though I had serious reservations when I saw the very tiny "spice packet" that came with the corned beef.  But what more can you expect when you just boil all that food in plain water?

Turned out wonderfully!  Moist, flavorful corned beef, delicious carrots and potatoes, and no overcooked cabbage.  My previous recipe was "dump everything in the crock pot and cook it for 8 hours" which produced at best mediocre results. 
 This will be my go too recipe from now on.

First, I’m not a cabbage fan but I still used it. I know nothing about cooked cabbage because I always thought it stunk so was not inclined to cook it. I do like it raw as a salad. What I discovered is that I love it fresh out of the pot but not the next day. So at least give it a try even if you haven’t liked it in the past. I’ve made it twice. The first time I made it in the crockpot because I needed to be elsewhere. It was so good that 2 of us couldn’t stop eating it. I did substitute 1 can of beef broth (out of the water called for) because I like it in crockpot cooking. Then I made soup out of the leftovers with the intention of freezing some but it was too good and didn’t make the freezer.  That was worth 5 stars with an added craving factor! I ate it for breakfast- that good!  However, the next time I made it in my Dutch oven on the stove (again with broth and water) and it wasn’t nearly as tender nor had the intensity of flavor. Also, I didn’t change the vegetable ratio (perfect the first time) but in the Dutch oven the carrot flavor was more pronounced. I’m a newb so I’m sure there’s a reason but I didn’t like it as much. I also made the soup with leftovers and it’s just ok but I’ll still eat it and some will make it to the freezer. Maybe someone can shed the light for me why the white part of the cabbage is more mild tasting and doesn’t stink the next day like the green part.

You all need to go to math class. I dont get how your time done and cook time works out. For a 3# brisket (which is what you are calling for and average in store) to cook that alone @50min per pound comes to 2.5 hours! So how you get a complete time of 2hrs 35 min is beyond me.

Great flavor.  Made it in our “crockpot “ on the oven setting, got a little dry & burnt on outside, but regardless was delicious!  We will make in oven next time.  Leftovers were awesome on a grilled Reuben.

Nice and not dry . Could not stop eating before dinner . I made a lot and put a whole meal in the freezer for a week night. I added a large squirt of Horseradish mustard and trimmed the fat off after it sat out to cool

I don’t like the spice packet, so I tossed that away. We don’t eat many potatoes so I just used four small red potatoes and 3 large carrots and the meat turned out perfect! The broth makes a great base for homemade soup the next day. I cut up fresh veggies and the remainder of the corned beef and tossed that into the soup. Yum!

We enjoyed this. Followed the recipe and directions, but also added a can of beef broth and a can of beer with water to cover as the initial beef cooking  liquid and one large onion, chopped, when we added the other vegetables. Also, we confirm that red or waxy-type potatoes are the right kind to use instead of russets or starchy-type. We used a dutch oven on the stove top to keep the heat low and even. I expect we'll make this again next year.

Simple and delicious!
I usually make my corned beef and cabbage in the crock pot. I was looking for a stove top version and this was perfect! The cabbage comes out crisp-tender, so if you like softer cabbage, add it sooner. I don't imagine that adding beer or anything else would have improved the flavor. Thanks!

Made it exactly. I had a hard time to keep the simmer down so that it wouldn't reach temperature too fast as the meat needs to cook slow. Still it came out very good and probably the best corned beef I've made. I'm still looking for something more tender but perhaps this time it just was simmering too hot. Will try to control that better. Still it made for a great St. Patrick's day feast.

I added onions to the recipe. Can't have a New England boiled dinner without onions no matter if it's smoked picnic of corned beef.

Easy peasy and delicious! I’ve used many corned beef and cabbage recipes, and this one is so simple. And despite the ease involved, the depth of flavor must be tasted to be believed. This goes to the top of my St. Pat’s cook list!

This is my standard method of making corned beef and cabbage, but we have always taken one more step. Once the meat is cooked, set it aside to cool slightly. Score the top of the flat in a diamond pattern with a sharp knife. Make a mixture of brown sugar, some dark mustard and ginger ale to a thin paste. Preheat oven to 425 and put meat on a rack on  a foil lined baking sheet. Brush top of meat generously and put in oven to glaze. Repeat after 10 minutes. Just gives the corned beef some extra uumph! Serve with horseradish or horseradish cream and the cooked veggies.

I made this recipe and it was wonderful, but I also added a package of breakfast sausages(10) when I added the cabbage-My Grandmother always did this for us when we were kids and I like the tradition, so do our kids. Yes I will make this recipe again

Make it the way the recipe states. Then, remove the corned beef, mix together some brown sugar, honey and mustard, and cover the corned beef with it. Cook it lightly in the oven with the glaze on it for a short amount of time(don’t let it dry out). Serve alongside the cabbage, potatoes, and carrots. Delicious!

Laria Tabul ~. Just made this dish, did not change a thing. (I like doing that so I can get a full appreciation of the dish before or even if I change anything). Delicious!  Won’t be changing anything.  The Irish flavors are all there.  Plan on making Rubens with the left overs.  Of course, trying a recipe from this site ??.

It was delicious! Ended up using canned potatoes and canned carrots bc it’s what I had and still tasted amazing! Added mustard seed, oregano, garlic salt, thyme, and plain Jane salt and pepper.

This was the first time I ever made corn beef and cabbage and was worried how my family would like it. They all loved it! It was a lot easier than I expected it to be. I did add a 1/2 stick of butter and used beef broth like I saw on other reviews. My kids told me that this recipe belongs in our special recipe cookbook.

Love this, and so does my very irish family. As is this recipe is so close to what my family makes. The only difference is that we use vegetable broth instead of water.

I followed the advice of the first and second  most helpful reviews. The sauce of the second review is awesome.  My mom wanted mashed potatoes instead of the other.   I did wash off the brisket before i baked it at  300 degrees, low and slow for 6 hours. I did use a can of beer and beef stock and very  little water to cover.  Extremely tender.

WOW, this was so delicious, thank you. I haven't made corned beef in long time.  I forgot how much this meat cooks down, I made 6# for 7 people and there was not enough meat and normally these folks are not big meat eaters.  They loved it. 
As recommended by some other reviewers I did throw a bottle of beer in, beef bullion and some garlic while the meat simmered. Added an onion when I added the veggies. 
This is a keeper.

Fabulous! My husband who says he doesn’t like corned beef asked for seconds. I did put a can of beer in there cause I figured it couldn’t hurt. The cabbage came out tender and delicious! Will do again next year.

Loved this dish.  The meat was tender , it just melted in your mouth.  I had to steam my cabbage separately bc my pot was too small & I could not fit everything in the pot at once.

I had never even bought a corned beef brisket let alone attempted to cook one.  I have to say, after eating my MIL's for several years in a row, I was Not looking forward to it.  I was so very suprised.   It had FLAVOR, it wasn't dry, and it presents well on a serving platter.  This is definitely one to make.  I did add a few more spices to mine, and no carrots.  Overall, so sooooo good.

You cannot make Corned Beef and Cabbage without salt pork and rutabegga ! Without those its not traditional Irish. .  Not to mention this is jewish cordbeef. Irish corned beef is a salt cured beef.

I don't know if it was the seasoning of the brand of corned beef that we bought or what but this recipe was amazing! It was beyond easy and my husband couldn't stop saying how delicious it was. The only changes I made was adding 7 garlic cloves, a few extra carrots and an onion. I forgot to buy potatoes for it and was worried about it being too salty but it wasn't. I also made the "amazingly easy Irish soda bread" (which really is super easy) served with Kerrygold butter and this has become one of our favorite meals.

Followed the recipe and didn't alter it. It was delicious. I cooked the potatoes too long and they were starting to fall apart.  Cooked the meat longer than 3 hrs it was so tender.  Really easy recipe

Fabulous!!! I've been making my corned beef and cabbage in the crock pot for YEARS!! More often than not my corned beef would come out shredded! I faulted my crock pot as it is old and I've had to adjust recipes accordingly....I just deleted that recipe!  This is the way to go. I was able to slice my corned beef and it was juicy and tender.  I goofed and realized that I put the veggies in too soon, but I removed them from the pot and let the corned beef finish cooking.  Three hours for my flat cut 3.75 brisket was perfect and my family loved it!!!

Love this but found that the potatoes came out really salty when I boiled them with the corned beef-personally I don't like them that way so I'll separate them in the future but for the vegetables it came out just fine.

Very easy and good. Only change was to use 2 cups of beef broth with the water. Will make again.

Followed directions exactly and turned out great. Nice easy to follow recipe. I threw in some parsnips with the potatoes and carrots because I had some that needed used up and they went well with the recipe too.

This is a basic recipe, which I am sure most people would add to, hence only 4 stars.  But, it is what I was looking for because I really just was curious about the cooking method.  I used Vegetable broth instead of water, and added Onion and Celery along with the carrots to the liquid during cooking.  I also added Garlic Powder (1 tsp) and Culinary Lavender (1 tbsp) to the simmering liquid. The timing in this recipe is spot on in terms of adding potatoes (I used whole creamers) and cabbage.  It came out delicious.

Great recipe - I followed others' advice and used beer instead of water to cover the corned beef (4lb), I brought it to a boil then cooked in a 350 degree oven for 21/2 hours, added potatoes and carrots for the last 30 minutes. Boiled the cabbage in wedges in a separate pot.  Served with mustard.

Always very good! Only tweaks I give it is to seer the brisket on each side in the pot before adding water, then also cutting a whole red onion and letting that boil with the brisket and season packet... then add everything else lol super yummy every year ??

This is the recipe my family (not Irish) has used since the late 60's.  My parents had it in the late 1960's at an upscale Irish restaurant (Brennan's?) which was at the top of the Commerce Tower in Kansas City.  It was served with a white sauce and my mom came up with her own rendition, which we pour over the meat and all the veggies and is so good I could drink it straight up!  It's a pretty much a basic Bechamal (Mornay Sauce really):

-1 stick (8 T) Butter
-1/2 C Flour
-4 cups liquid (half milk, half stock from cooking pot, or so, no hard and fast ratio...)
-good heap (half a cup or so, or more) of grated Parmesan cheese
--1 T or so (or much more, depending) of prepared Horseradish
-1 T or so of chicken base to punch it up.
-Salt/Pepper to taste
(add more cheese, Horseradish and base to your liking). 

Google: Bechamel if you need instruction; really quite easy and takes a good meal to the next level.  

Delicious.

This is simple and absolutely delicious! Myself being Irish I have grown up with this being a regular meal in our home. And now as an adult I've been making it this way for years!! If you want real Irish corned beef and cabbage this is the only way in my opinion. Adding broth, beer ect. Takes away from making traditional Irish corned beef. This comes out extremely juicy and tasty! The only thing I do different is add quartered onion just because I love onion. Enjoy!

I have never made corn beef and cabbage and I followed the recipe  In between shoveling snow as we are having a major blizzard I read some of the reviews which were all positive.  ONe review by Tracey suggested putting the corn beef in the oven  for 30 minutes while cabbage was cooking with several ingredients   so I did  AND  WOW  husband and I were so impressed  So delicious.

Everything turns out beautiful n very simple making it this way. The only thing that I change are the potatoes I enjoy the red potatoes with this meal and so does my family. I also add at least 2 large sized white onions cut in 1/4's.

This recipe is so easy and so flavorful I had to share it with my friends and family. As suggested I rinsed the goopy bloody blob before any further preparation [quite unpalatable but a quick rinse goes a long way]. I next trimmed some of the fat off of our 2lb roast, seared both sides in the dutch oven and covered with water as I do not care for Guinness. Followed everything else to a T except adding the cabbage. (cooked separately) This recipe is like a warm-up to the main event in 12 days. I will make again for our extended family at that time.

Similar to my mother's boiled Irish dinner.  For those who complain of it being salty or have salt restricted diets she would quickly rinse beef with cold water prior to putting it in the pot.  After corned beef had rested she'd brush on a light coating of a favorite mustard then sprinkle with brown sugar and place under broiler until sugar glazed up, keep an eye on it,but doesn't take very long.

I make this about twice a year and always refer to this exact recipe.  It always turns out fantastic and I don't have to change anything, unless I have a different kind of potato on hand.  This is great!

I made some changes but followed the basic recipe.  I used a ceramic Dutch oven. Therefore, I was not able to boil on the stovetop. Instead, I cooked the corned beef  according to the instructions on the package.   An hour before the corned beef ready, I put the vegetables on top of the meat. Turned out great.

This is a great recipe! I had a craving for corned beef and cabbage (I missed my St. Patrick's Day opportunity, so I'm a little late in early April) ;) the only changes I made; I added 2 cloves of garlic (chopped), I poured in a half of a summer Shandy and marinated the potatoes and carrots in Italian dressing while the corned beef was cooking. I made a mustard, horseradish, and lemon juice sauce and it turned out fantastic!

I followed the recipe to a "T" but it was just missing "something".  There wasn't that much flavor. My corned beef didn't come with a spice packet but I added pickling spices after googling the "ingredients" of a spice packet.  Would love to make this again....only if I knew how to please me and my men!

I made it exactly as written and it was awesome!  My father-in-law had 3 plates.   I made a 4lb brisket and had 5 adults and it all got eaten except for a couple of potatoes.  Excellent!!

Followed most, used one can of German beer with water. Few cloves garlic and after 3 1/2 hours  simmering removed corn beef and put in oven with a glaze of mustard and brown sugar for 30 more minutes at 350. In liquid added celery, baby potatoes and Tbl butter, last 10 minutes added a head of cabbage. Was wonderful.

First time making corned beef so I was a bit worried when I couldn't puncture it easily with a fork after 2 1/2 hours of simmering. I read on another website you can flip it over if it's been floating so the top is submerged for a while. That worked like a charm and 15 minutes later it was magically tender all the way through. Served with horseradish and colcannon.  I got great feedback from my husband.

Do not use guideline of 50 minutes per pound.  I had 4.4 lb corned beef and decided to check temp, an hour before called for, and it was overdone at 180 degrees.

Love the simplicity of this recipe! I only make this on St. Patty's Day and couldn't remember how long to boil it. Found a good 5lb hunk of corned beef from the local butcher and addEd more pickling spice for flavor.  Came out AWESOME!!!

Delicious.  I cooked a 3 pound corned beef brisket for 2 hours with one bottle of Shiner Bock and water to cover,  added the potatoes and carrots and cooked for 20 minutes, added the cabbage and onion and cooked another 20 minutes.  Do not forget to let the corn beef rest.  This makes a lot so I reduced the amount of vegetables.  Plan to make corned beef sandwiches with the leftovers.

I've made this recipe many times. It's the best crock pot recipe in my opinion. My corned beef is usually 2 lbs. not 4 lbs. I slow cook it on low instead of high. Other than that this recipe is perfect for St. Patrick's day or any day at my house.

This is a great base recipe.  I would have liked it as is, but my hubby likes more flavor so I tweaked it a bit.  After cooking the meat I removed it from pot, added some sliced onions, turned up heat to medium and boiled until liquid was reduced by about half.  Then added a can of beef consommé and cooked veges as directed in recipe, sliced beef and added back to pot.  Delicious!

A bit salty for our taste but I blame the product, not the recipe.  Next time I will simmer 30 mins by itself and drain the salty water off and then continue with the recipe.  I used a 22oz Guinness Extra Stout and then enough water to cover the meat.  I also added a bay leaf, I usually do with long simmer cooks of just about anything.  Along with the carrots and potatoes, I added a large parsnip prepared the same as the carrots and a little bit of garlic.  When adding the veggies I took the meat out and placed on a roasting pan in a 300* oven.  When adding the cabbage 45 mins later I wrapped the meat in foil and took it out of the oven.  Very good overall.

This was my first time having corned beef. I don't like it so much personally but I made this dish for Saint Patricks day and my family thought it was perfect. The only change I made was that I cooked the cabbage separately at the end with 1/4 cup of butter, broth from meat and veggies, and chicken broth. It tasted really good!!!

Very good recipe! I should have listened and not added cut up russet potatoes, as they fell apart before the cabbage and carrots were done cooking... my bad... next time I will use baby reds.

Used 4 cans of beer (3 miller lites and a sam lager). Really added flavor.  Also added extra garlic because we love it.  

Also doubled the cabbage and carrots for fried leftovers the next day.  Thanks Laria!

The recipe was easy and it was really good!  We put the carrots and potatoes in with an hour to go. With 30 minutes to go we put a couple cut up onions and once it was done we took out the meat and vegetables and added the cabbage in the juice for 15 minutes.  It was AWESOME.  It was all done in a cast iron dutch oven. Also instead of all water, we used about 6 ounces of dark beer called "Black Cauldron" from a Brewery in Utah, and a 12 ounce can of Bud Light I had left in the fridge.  The pot was then topped with water.

It was just OK, certainly not what I would consider delicious.  The meat came out fine, but the cabbage, carrots and potatoes was bland bland bland.

This recipe is easy and very good. The review from Tracy 3/6/2008, was perfect! Adding a little sweetness to the corned beef was just right!

Just finished devouring this recipe! Tasty and filling.  I followed tracey's suggestion and glazed the corned beef and cooked it in the oven while the veggies cooked - ahh!  Will have to start cooking this more than once a year!

I make my corned beef and cabbage this way BUT I use half water and half beer or all beer instead of all water. I also cook the meat, cabbage, carrots and potatoes all together and when the vegetables are cooked I just remove them and keep them warm on the side until the meat is done. Corned beef and cabbage is a very "bland" basic type of meal. I never feel the need to use onions since everyone I know cooks it this way.

The beef turned out delicious!  We cooked regular baking potatoes a little too long, though, and they got mushy.  We also thought that the cabbage was a little soft after 15 minutes, and will cook this less next time.  Used baby carrots to save the steps of peeling and cutting, and they were good.  We'll definitely cook corned beef and cabbage this way again!

Very good simple recipe.  We were pleased that it was not salty.  We cooked the cabbage for only 10 minutes so it would be al dente.

This was my first time making this recipe for St. Patrick's Day. My husband is irish so I thought I would attempt to make him a traditional irish dinner.
My family and I absolutely fell in love with this dish. I have added this dish to our dinner recipe book. Absolutely delicious!!

So simple and so yummy!  I followed another persons suggestion to use beef broth instead of water and it was a much richer broth... Being the first time I made this I am really proud of how it turned out!  Use the stove not a crock pot... you know it's good when my 10 and 7 year olds eat up all while saying how good it is... will use this again!!  Thank you!

Very easy and the combination of vegetables with the juices was perfect.
 I was able to cook the beef in the pressure cooker for 1 hour with a cup of water and a bay leaf added to the packet of seasonings that comes with it.

I too added beer, Negro Modelo which is what I had (reminded me of Carlos Murphy's, an Irish Mexican pub in my home town) Garlic and onions are the only other additions I made.  I also hate picking out the mustard seeds and peppercorns, so I wrapped them in a coffee filter. (a package of cheesecloth was $5 at the grocery store!)   Curious about the julienned carrots Laria, don't those disappear? I cooked mine whole.   Great recipe! I never could get it right before. Always rubbery :(   Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe. The only problem is that it's...well...corned beef and cabbage! I made 4lbs of corned beef thinking that I would have more people at the dinner table that night. Wrong. Schedules changed and I had fewer diners. So, I had ALOT of corned beef & cabbage for left overs. Folks, this stuff just doesn't look appetizing after a few days. So, the recipe is fine just be sure that you have people to EAT it that night!

This was my first attempt at Corned Beef and Cabbage and it was fantastic! I took the advice of some of the previous reviewers and used beef broth instead of water to cook the corned beef in. I pulled the briskit out of the broth and let it sit for an hour while the veggies cooked then put it back in to rewarm. You could cut he meat with a fork. I will be making this again.

I give this 5 stars because I don't like corned beef, but I didn't mind this dish (as long as I didn't eat the corned beef part).  I cooked this for my family and everyone really enjoyed it.  I followed the suggestions to cut the fat off and use beef broth instead of water.  I also added about 13 peppercorns and 1 bay leaf in addition to the packet.  I started cooking it in the crock pot, but when I went to put the veggies in, they wouldn't fit, so I put it in a large pot for the last hour or so.  I added turnips and onion.  Like I said, everyone really enjoyed it, even my picky little sister.  Happy St. Patty's!

Our corned beef came out so tender and yummy.  I've made several corned beefs in the past including in my crock pot but this was the best one by far.

Super easy!  I bought the corned beef from Whole Foods.  No spice packet so I used one beer, water to cover, one bay leaf, dried thyme, 4 cloves of garlic crushed, and some black peppercorns.  Yummy!

My mom always made Corned Beef and Cabbage for St. Patricks Day. I always wanted to carry on the tradition. I found a great recipe to start our family tradition. My 2 year old even ate this as well!

Awesome basic easy recipe, pretty much the same way I have always done it except I just cut the carrots in half ant throw them in. Why fancy it up? Some things are best left simple.

I usually do my corned beef and cabbage in the crockpot. I ran short on time today so I decided to use this recipe. It came out very good. Thanks.

Excellent!!  Yummm!  My brisket didn't come with a seasonings packet so I just made up my own.  I am not sure what exactly normally goes with it, but mine turned out well :)    BBQ seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

I got mine at Costco, did it in the slow-cooker on low for 7 hours and it came out really good!!!  I added carrot, celery and potato and in place of water I used beef broth.  Skipped the cabbage, what kind of Irish girl doesn't like cabbage??? Me.  Anyhoo, the meat was rather fatty, but I know that fat=flavor so I just trimmed it all of after it was cooked and before I sliced it.  Surprisingly, BF didn't like it as much as I did, I though for sure this would be a man-pleaser-meal...  Oh, about halfway through cooking, I ladled out about a cup of the liquid and mixed in about 1/4c cornstarch, then added it all back in and this made it into more of a gravy than a soup... good addition.

I do not, repeat DO NOT like corned beef and cabbage.  I truly enjoyed this dinner.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and finished off the brisket in the oven with a ketchup, brown sugar, cider vinegar, mustard sauce.  WONDERFUL!  Also, I used chicken and beef stock only.

I actually didn't make the corned beef portion of the recipe (was going to be gone the 17th and didn't want the burner on so long on the stove, plus I wanted to use beer) but did follow it for what types of and how to cook the veggies. I made my corned beef in the slow cooker, added the bubbling juices to a stock pot and then took up the recipe, and it worked really really well. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty and super easy. I also used a bottle of beer (a honey porter) as part of my liquid. I would definitely make this again. I think I'll add onions next time.

This was one of the easier recipes for CB&C that I have tried and it did not disappoint! My brisket did not have a spice pack so I added 1.5 teaspoons of pickling spice and 3 bay leaves. Cooked 4 lbs for 3 hours - took it out to set while I cooked the veggies and cabbage. Can't wait to try the leftovers! Thanks for the great recipe.

You really cant go wrong with this one. I used only the corned beef and potatoes and it was great. But beware, the beef will shrink quite a bit. I was shocked.
