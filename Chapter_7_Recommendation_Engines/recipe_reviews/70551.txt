I made this yesterday for a baby shower, however, I did make a few changes mostly because I couldn't find the ingredients needed.  I could not find the blue drink mix, so I instead used a jug of the Blue Hawaiian Punch, the lemon lime soda and then white grape juice because I could not find white cranberry juice.  Everyone loved it!!!  And it was so cute with the ducks floating in it.  **I've since made this for Halloween using the green Hawaiian punch and floated those black plastic spider rings in it.  Too cute!**

I thought this was an excellent punch recipe--very tasty, and not to sweet but not too tart.  My punch bowl holds 6 quarts, and this recipe was just enough to fill my punch bowl to about 2 inches from the top.  I'm always disappointed about the lack of punch options for "It's a Boy" baby showers.  So I tried this punch recipe to see if it would work well for future baby showers.  I will definitely use it in the future, maybe even experiment with different colors of Kool-Aid that would be suitable for other party themes.  The one thing I would point out...I prefer Vanilla Bean ice cream, so out of habit, that's what I used when making this punch.  I didn't notice any vanilla beans in the punch itself, but there were tiny little black specks along the sides of the punch cups that resembled dirt.  I don't think the vanilla bean residue effected the flavor of the punch, but nonetheless others might prefer using an ice cream that doesn't include vanilla beans.  I submitted a photo of the Baby Blue Punch that I made, which was taken about 5 minutes after adding the ice cream scoops.  So you can see that it doesn't take long for the frothy blue clouds to develop.

Throwing a baby shower for one of my best friends I was looking all over for a blue punch to go with our all blue theme.  I came across this one and will admit I was a little skeptical...using ice cream in a punch???  This was one of the best punch recipes I have ever tasted.  Everyone was raving about it.  We went through 2 bowls of the punch for about 20 people.  This is a great, SUPER easy recipe!!

We made this recipe for my best friend's baby shower. It was a BIG hit! Instead of using blue drink mix (which is hard to find) We used Blue Hawaiian Punch and whit cranberry juice. It was delicious! We had to refill the punch bowl 3 times! Thank you for the wonderful drink! I would recommend this to everyone!

I loved this receipe, but for our baby shower I made some modifications. I used blue hawaiian punch, with pineapple soda, and pineapple sherbert. I turned out great. Thanks for making such an easily modified recipe.

Made this today for a baby shower, I followed the directions word for word. Mixed all the liquids and powder, and then tasted. The sugar was needed, as it tasted very tart without it. The punch turned out a very vibrant blue color, and when I added the vanilla ice cream it turned a very pretty baby blue color. The punch in no way looked "gross" or anything with the ice cream on top. 
Everyone really enjoyed this punch, and many asked for the recipe...and were surprised it was made with Kool-Aid.

I made it for a baby shower and the flavor was just OK and the ice cream absolutely did not work.  Sherbert was made for punch, not ice cream.  It started seperating and looking really gross on top of the punch.

I served this at my daughters baby shower! It was a great hit and everyone loved the duckies floating around in the fountain... I actually served it without trying it before hand because we liked the "blue" punch. Everyone loved it and I will definately use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing it with us!

I made this punch for my sister's baby shower, she is having a boy.  It went over so well, I had to make a second bowl.  It was so simple, you can adapt this to be any color you need.

I was looking for a punch recipe that was blue, for a baby boy shower, and this is what I found.  Instead of using the kool aid, sugar, and cranberry juice, I substituted a gallon of the berry blue hawaiian punch (found in the juice aisle).  So basically, I used the hawaiian punch, sprite, and vanilla ice cream.  It came out totally cool looking and was a big hit at the shower.  I got so many compliments on it.  I think since it was blue, a lot of ladies took notice of it.  You don't see many blue punches around.  One lady noted it tasted like a "bomb pomp".  I have no idea what that is, but I assume it is some type of ice cream bar you'd find on an ice cream truck.  If you are looking for something for a baby shower for a boy, you should definitely use this recipe.  It was great!

I love the idea but it's more complicated than it has to be.  I made it once according to the recipe the first time & it was great but I was in a rush the second time so I used blue Hawaiian punch added a 2 liter of Sprite & one quart of pineapple sherbet.  It was just as good & much faster.  To make sure it looks like bath water pour hawaiian punch first, sherbet second & Sprite last.

For those that said the ice cream separated and made it look gross -- use only good ice cream. Cheap ice cream/low fat ice cream has less cream.   I've made this as is, 5 stars. I've also made this using hawaiin blue punch and sprite when I couldn't find blue koolaid. Very good both ways!

I made this recipe for a friend's baby boy shower. I made the recipe without the ice cream as it was a work function and would have been too messy. I added ice to chill the punch down as well. The punch was very tasty and got raving reviews for the appearance. The rubber duckies really made the "look" complete. See attached photo.

This punch was a big hit at the baby boy shower I threw.  2 changes: (1) I used the blue Hawaiian Punch (cheap - about $2 for giant jug) and I agreed with another reviewer that sherbet goes much better with punch, so (2) I used pineapple sherbet. Since it's white, it worked well to make the froth on top.  The pineapple flavor worked well with the blue Hawaiian Punch.  Would definitely make again with those changes.

I made this for a baby shower over the weekend. It was a duck theme. I used a previous reviewer's advice and used the blue Hawaiian punch, Sprite, and white grape juice. Instead of ice cream I used Pineapple sherbet. Put rubber ducks in it and viola.  It was a HIT at the shower. That's the only thing the guests wanted to drink! Thanks for the recipe. Loved it!

Made this today for a friends baby boy shower. Was super easy to make, took about 3 mins to put together. Ducks looked super cute and everyone thought it was adorable. I used 9 scoops of ice cream and then gave it a quick stir to help it start to melt on top and look all foamy. Also I used white grape juice as I couldn't find white Cranberry juice. Worked and tasted great! Will definitely make this again and again.

I made this punch for a baby shower.  It went over really well.  Everyone loved the rubber ducks! I used blue Hawaiian Punch as well instead of the blue drink mix and I used white grape juice instead of the white cranberry juice.  The sugar is not needed when using an already sweetened drink such as Hawaiian Punch. I did not have any problems with the ice cream separating or looking gross.  As it melted, it melted into the punch turning it a nice baby blue shade and giving the punch a little creamy flavor. Overall an excellent baby shower punch!

I used this for my cousin's "Duckie" Baby Shower and it was a hit!! I simply used Hawaiian Punch, Ginger Ale and Vanilla Ice Cream. Then we topped it with little floating duckies! Very cute! We totally ran out!!

I just threw a baby shower this weekend and used this recipe with a few slight changes. I used a bottle of blue Hawaiian Punch because I am always super messy when it comes to any kind of powdered mix and this just seemed easier. I used white grape juice instead of white cranberry because I like it better. I used a generic brand lemon lime soda as the recipe called for, and I only used three not-quite-full scoops of ice cream and I stirred a little to encourage the ice cream to spread a little faster.  The ice cream turned out really pretty and frothy just like a bubble bath.  Added the small duckies last that I purchased from Oriental Trading, and the punch was super cute and got tons of compliments. Next time I think I will take the ducks out right before serving because they tipped over and then looked kinda gross floating sideways and covered in foam. The punch tasted delicious in my opinion. The white grape juice kind of overpowered everything else so to me it tasted like blue sparkling grape juice. But I really liked it anyway. You may just add the grapejuice a little more sparingly than I did if you aren't as big a fan... or try the cranberry instead.

I followed the recipe exactly, except only used 1/2 cup of sugar, and it turned out perfectly!  Huge hit at the shower - pretty and tasted great, too.

Made this for a baby shower today and it was fabulous EXACTLY as directed.  I used a packet of blue Kool-Aid (blue raspberry-lemonade) and otherwise followed the directions.  The sugar is needed- its WAY too tart without it.  I had to make two punchbowls full- everyone loved it!

Made this for my second grandsons baby shower (made it for the first one to). Both times it came out great. VERY EASY...takes about 2 minutes (someone else said it was complicated...huh?) Anyway, I couldn't find Hawaiian punch blue so I got one of the gallon jugs of flavored water (the cheap stuff) it was a berry blue. Put in the ice cream (which makes it look very pretty) 1/2 of the blue stuff, 1/2 bottle 7-up and was going to add the white grape juice I bought and found out I left it in my daughters 'frig...AHHHHHH!!! Well, we tasted it with just the 3 ingredients and found out it tasted fine just that way. This is a VERY easy recipe...can't go wrong.

This punch got alot of attention at the baby shower i was hosting. I followed the recipe eactly, doubling everything to accomodate my large punch bowl. It not only looks fantastic( i floated two rubber duckies in the punch) but tastes great too. You should be aware however that the punch does leave your guests with slightly blue mouths. My guests didnt mind but i suppose some people may not appreciate that.

I used this punch recipe for my son's 1st birthday (Happy Feet theme). It was a HUGE hit! We used a penguin floating in punch instead of rubber duckies. I was making large quantities of it often so I used the hawaiian punch that was recommended. I would just recommend chilling the juices/punch before mixing just so people don't add ice which waters down the flavor. Overall, I highly recommend this getting ready to use it again for a baby shower next month!

I used this recipe for my sister's baby shower. I couldn't find the White Cranberry juice so I changed the recipe. 

I used:
a jug of Hawaiian Punch BerryBlue
a 2 liter of Sprite
vanilla ice cream

This was very good and tasted excellent!

I've made this several times for lots of different events.  I made this for baby showers, christmas, and birthdays.  I've followed the directions, as well as make up my own using this as a sample recipe.  I've used peach cranberry juice, sprite, and vanilla bean ice cream for my daughter's birthday.  Every time I make it no matter what ingredients I use its raved about every time

I made a punch similar to this one for my daughter's baby shower--only difference is that i couldn't find the white cranberry juice so i used white grape juice, and a batch with Old Orchards Apple Passion Mango juice (any clear juice will work) with excellent results!  I got rave reviews--especially since i substituted a new, clean baby bathtub for the punch bowl.  It was adorable!!  After the shower she had a baby bathtub to use--double duty gift!!  Everyone thought it was the cutest thing they had ever seen!

I couldn't find White Cranberry Juice so I used White Grape Juice instead. I made it this weekend for my daughter's baby shower. This punch was very well received. I had many requests for the recipe. It was DELICIOUS. It makes an absolutely wonderful punch for a boy baby shower. Could also be used for the Fourth of July with a red colored ice ring....excellent taste!

My punch didn't have the dark blue color in the pic.  Next time I will probably add a few drops of blue food coloring.  I made my ice cream balls and froze them again.  I then floated 2 baby ducks and used other rubber ducks as decorations on the table. Cute ides.  Thanks.

Good flavor with the kids.  I floated a rubber duck in the punch, as shown in the other photo for this recipe.  The other photo also has a more realistic color, my punch was much darker the ice cream floated the whole time.  I omitted the sugar entirely due to other's comments.  I don't think it was needed with the soda and cranberry juice already sweetened.  A single recipe was perfect.   Thanks for the great idea, the rubber duckie was also a conversation piece.

It rocks!  I used it for a baby shower for a friend who had a boy.  It looks like a science experiment, but it tastes great!  The only thing I would change is I wouldn't put the ice cream in the punch bowl.  I think I would put it in the individual glasses.  The blue mixture is just so cool looking, so it makes for great presentation.

This punch was amazing I found the recipe and we made it for my baby shower over my christmas leave. We used blue berry koolade mix,  omited the sugar, White cranberry-Peach, and i belive sprite I only put 4 scoops of ice cream beacuse I was afraid of it getting all goopy like others had complained about. I didnt even end up getting a real picture of it just my friend took one with the baby rubberduckies in her cup. The punch turned out just the frothey consistancy and flavor I wanted all my friends and relatives LOVED it. I like it so much that i actually keep a small thing of just lemon lime carbonated bevrage from my grocerie store and make mini baches formyself to snack on and It dosent give me heart burn which is amazing lol Thank you so much for this recipe

Very yummy - flavors work great together.  It's also good without the ice cream if friends/fam don't like the 'foam' on top. :)

I made this punch - with some modifications...I used the Blue Hawaiian Punch (which omitted the sugar, since it was already included in the pre-made punch), and used White Grape Juice.  Pure satisfaction!!  Thanks for the recipe...I'll use it in the future!

This was a great recipe! The mother to be and guests seemed impressed with the blue color and they all loved the ducks floating in the punch. !!!HOW CUTE!!! It was really easy to make just dump and stir. I did find that the sugar didn't want to dissolve that fast and the kool-aid did get a bit clumpy so you had to stir really good. So I think the next time I make this I would probably pour out half of the bottle of white cranberry juice into the punch bowl and then add the sugar and kool-aid packet into what is left in the bottle of juice and shake to dissolve the kool aid and the sugar better so that you don't take away from the (fizzy) carbonation of having to stir and stir the 7-UP along with everything else in the punch bowl. Once again, GREAT recipe and I was very pleased with the results!

I made this for a co-worker's grandma-to-be shower.  I used blue Hawaiian punch, white grape juice, and Sprite.  It was a big hit and the vanilla ice cream gave it a nice creaminess.  It also made for a great presentation with little froggies floating in the bowl.

Couldn't find the mix in powder form so used Blue Hi-C which worked great and tasted good. Everyone thought it was cool and loved the rubber ducks. There was none left over. I would use this again.

This punch is MUCH better in theory than it is in reality.  It definitely created that "Oh, How Cute!" reaction at first but the few people that tried it commented on how sweet it was and didn't go back for seconds.  It was really overpowering! By the end of the party the ice cream looked like a curdled mess on the top of the bowl and was just SO unappealing!  It was a cute idea to have blue punch for a baby boy shower however, you would be MUCH better off using a little bit of the blue kind of Juicy Juice and mixing it with sprite or ginger ale to get the same color without the overly sweet taste and yucky look. I would take a pass on this punch!

I served this at a baby shower (it's a boy!) and it got rave reviews. Most were impressed by the color and commented on how creative it was. There wasn't a drop left! I only used about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of sugar, and it was plenty sweet. Also used low-fat ice cream, couldn't tell the difference!

The first time I made this recipe for my baby shower, and it was A HIT!  We made one punch bowl exactly as described, and then another ALCOHOLIC, with a half bottle of "Three Olives Whipped Cream Vodka".  It was fantastic, just the right amount of "dessert-ness" with the ice cream and whipped cream vodka, but also went very well with the citrus from the juices.  I have made this a few times since and it's always GONE.

This was a hit.  I did the modifications as others did but the ratios were not very clear if you used hawaiian punch.  So I used half of a container of the hawaiian punch, 1 2L of Sprite, and about 1/4 of a container of white grape juice.  About 9-10 scoops of pineapple sherbert.  They drank it dry.  I ended up making another bowl of punch.  I would refer to this in the future for other gathering using other punches etc.  I have to say i dont like hawaiian punch, I would never just buy it to drink regularly ... but this was good.

This punch was excellent for a baby shower.  I added no sugar, it was plenty sweet from the juice and pop. Also I omitted the ice cream as suggested by other reviews.  It was well recieved at the party.

The color of this blue punch is perfect for baby boy showers but very easy to use any color of Kool-Aid to change the color and flavor.  The flavor is good and the ice cream makes it creamy and sweet!

Make for a Hawaiian party, so it represented the ocean with white caps.  Had to substitute Hawaiian blue punch for the berry blue packet.  Turned out great!

Looked so cute on the table. Everyone enjoyed it. The bowl was empty at the end of the shower. Would serve again if giving a baby shower.

Great punch!  It got rave reviews and the ice cream made a fantastic "cloud" over the top.  Tips I learned from other reviews I would highly recommend:  1) don't use vanilla bean ice cream (it DOES leave little black flecks!), use regular plain vanilla,  2) couldn't find any white cranberry, so used white grape,  3) had a hard time finding blue drink mix, but finally found Hawaiian Punch Berry Blue Typhoon in single serve packets (use 3 packets).   It was a fantastic addition to a Baby Boy Shower!

You have got to try this punch! I made it at my sis n laws baby shower and no one could stop drinking it! I should have made more. I couldn't find the blue drink mix so I used blue Hawaiian punch which means I also didn't add the sugar and I couldn't find white cranberry juice either so I went with white grape. I didn't follow measurements exactly either. I just added a little of each and tasted until I got it the way we liked it. I will be making again!!

I give 5 stars for the idea because I really wanted to do a blue punch for a boy baby shower.  However, I couldn't find blue Kool Aid or white cranberry juice so I used blue Hawaiian punch and soda.  It worked out and looked great.

This punch is very cute and tasty; the only negative is that for our shower the yield was wrong. We had 24 guests exactly and we ran out of punch in about 30 minutes. I'd recommend doubling the recipe.

Great recipe. I fixed this for my sister in laws shower and it was a big hit. I couldn't find the packet of drink mix, but I got a gallon of the hawaiian blue drink in the jug. I also couldn't find white cranberry juice so I used the white grape juice instead. Everyone enjoyed it!

Love this punch. I have used it for several "baby girl" showers and use it for my daughters birthday every year. I use a packet of pink uunsweetend koolaid instead of the blue drink mix and it turns out great!!!! It is so easy and really tastes great. I always add less sugar than what it calls for and it still turns out tasting great! 
I highly recommend this for any party in any color!

GREAT recipe! The only changes I made was the drink mix kind and the sugar. I used strawberry-kiwi kool-aid and no sugar. It was plenty sweet and a very pretty pink punch for my sister's baby shower. Everyone loved it. There wasn't any left at the end of the party. Thanks!

This punch was awesome and a huge hit at my baby shower! I did however use blue Hawaiian punch instead of the blue berry-flavored unsweetened drink mix, and all I could find for the juice was white cranberry-peach. It was all gone and people started asking for more! *HIGHLY RECOMMEND*

Loved the taste of this punch, and several shower-goers shared similar sentiments.  Looks very pretty at first, but once the ice cream melts it's kind of frothy and weird (but still tastes good!), so make sure everyone gets their punch as soon as you make it.

I made this for a boy baby shower and it was very cute and very tasty! The only complaint is that the vanilla icecream makes a greasy film around the edge of the bowl that looks a little yucky. Otherwise, this tastes great and is a very cute idea!

I made this for a festival this past summer, and it was an absolute hit!!! Although some were initally worried ice cream in punch, the people kept coming. Despite the several tables filled with sodas, waters, and other drinks, our punch table was the spot.The performers drank the entire first batch, and the second was gone within 45 minutes. Thank you so much for this fantastic recip.

This was a hit at my shower.  I used 1 2 liter Sprite, a pkg of Kool Aid (Flavor Ice Blue Raspberry lemonade) and white cranberry juice.  I didn't have to add any sugar at all.  I put a few scoops of mayfield vanilla ice cream on top and viola!  Everyone was asking me what was in it and where the recipe was~

Delicious! We made it for my sister's baby shower and it turned out nice. We used blue flavored drink, apple juice, 7up, and vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it and it looked really cool!

Perfect for a boy baby shower, however the ice cream "clouds" didn't look very appetizing towards the end of the day.

Very good.  Big hit at the baby shower.  Did not add any sugar, didn't need it.  Used Blue Raspberry Lemonade Koolaide. Was delicious.  One person probably had like 8 cups.

This was so easy and good! I will definately use it again. And I'm sure you can just use different colors of kool-aid to change the color of the punch! :)

This punch was quite a hit at a baby shower I held!!  I did use white grape juice instead of cranberry only because I couldn't find cranberry.  It was still fabulous!!  The rubber ducky floating in it really made it super cute!  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This punch is perfect when it comes to presentation.  I am giving a four instead of a five because I altered the recipe according to other reviews; I used Typhoon Blue Hawaiian Punch and white grape juice instead of Kool-Aid and cranberry juice.  I just eyeballed it as I poured the three drinks into the punch bowl.  I liked the way the ice cream and ducks looked on top, but I wasn't crazy about drinking the melted ice cream (the punch itself tasted very good, though).  I might try it with the sherbet some time, but it was great for our baby shower.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for a baby shower this weekend.  I couldn't find white cranberry juice, and am not a fan of cranberry, so I took the advise in other's reviews.  It was delicious!  I would advice to skip the vanilla ice cream though - I looked horrible, esp after it had melted.  The punch part was a big hit though!!

I just took this to a non-baby shower party and it was a huge hit!  A nice break from pink punch - and even the men drank like fish.  It wasn't too fruity or "girly".  I did not add the ice cream or baby ducks (obviously).

This punch was absolutely fantastic!  I made it for my cousin's baby shower and instead of white grape juice (couldn't find in the small town) I used pineapple juice.  We went through several bowls of this punch and still had people asking for more when it was gone. I will be making this at my next big event.  Thanks so much!

I have made this punch at all my babyshowers. It is very sweet, I suggest cutting the sugar down to 1/2 or 3/4 cup, and I used white grape juice instead of cranberry. Also you can use a pink kool-aid like cherry or strawberry for a girl!

I made this for my sister's Baby Boy Shower.  It was fabulous.  I went through half a recipe before the shower got started.  Everyone really liked it. F.Y.I. I don't like blue koolaid or punches, but I loved this one.  It wasn't as blue as the picture shows (more like a powder blue).

I just made this for my daughter's baby shower. People said it was good, but I didn't see many people drinking it. I went by the recipe, and the final cost (including rubber duck) was $10 for one fill. We tossed most of it in the end. I loved the idea of this punch, but if no one drinks it why make it again.

this punch was great. I could not find blue kool-aid or blue Hawaiian Punch so I used Blue Raspberry Mix for Martinis! It was perfect and I did not have to add any sugar. The ducks looked very cute too.

This punch was a hit at my best friend's baby shower.  I am also going to use it at mine.  I think the 1 cup of sugar is a must...it helps kill the tartness.  Make sure you have plenty...you will go through it quickly...yummy!

Yikes!  We couldn't find blue drink mix, so we tried purple, and it looked like mud!  People at the party were asking "what is that?"  I bet the blue would be better, though.

After reading several positive and a few negative reviews I made some amendments to the recipe. I used unsweetened raspberry lemonade mix (it's blue), left out the sugar, and substituted lemon sorbet for the ice-cream. It was a hit! I had to make 2 punch bowls full. To create the bubbles/foam I used a wire whisk and whisked until the sorbet melted. It created blue foam. The great part was there was no film that you get from ice cream in soda, and my non dairy guest could drink it. I usually am not a huge punch fan but I will most certainly make this recipe again. I forgot to take a picture until the bowl was half gone. So it looks more foamy to begin.

Sorry, I deviated from the recipe: I used blue Hawaiian punch in place of the drink mix and ginger ale for the carbonated beverage. Turned out very well, not ridiculously sweet like I was fearing.

I make punch for any and every occasion that I can and this is by far my favorite!  We used this punch for my baby shower and it was a hit!  My husband loved it as well and he is extremely picky.  We plan on making this for christmas with a red drink mix instead of the blue.

I'm not much of a punch person but this was really tasty and very cute!  I served it for my son's first birthday party with a pond theme of frogs and rubber ducks.  I subbed white grape juice for the white cranberry.  Everyone raved and it disappeared!

What a hit at my niece's baby shower!  She loved the fact that we had used the baby ducks as shown in the picture.  The punch really looks like a blue sky with white clouds, and the taste was amazing!

Very tasty loved by the kids.  I will not add the ice cream if I make it again.  It was pretty at first but then it turned chunky looking.  But anyway it was good other than the ice cream.

I didn't think this punch would look like the picture and it was even cuter when I made it.  I also didn't think the ice cream would be good on it, but it made it delicious!!

I made this for a boy baby shower at work and everyone loved it.  It was easy, cute, and not too sweet.  I couldn't find white cranberry juice so, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 white grape juice instead!

My Mother in law made this punch for my baby shower and it was a complete and total hit! We had about 35 people and it was gone before the presents were all opened. The ice cream melted in just fine and we didn't have any weird separation of ice cream and punch but it did not have to set out for a long time. She followed the recipe exactly. I LOVE tart things and cannot stand the overly syrupy sweet fruit punched you usually find at showers and this was just sweet enough and just tart enough. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for something different.

This punch was easy to make and great tasting.  I made it just as suggested, except I didn't get the right shade of blue Koolaid, it was icy blue, which turned green once the ice cream started to melt, so I had one pink punch and one greeny/blue punch... no one cared, it tasted great and looked amazing with the little ducks swimming on top!

Excellent punch for a party.  I made it as directed and my co-workers loved it.  I also made ice rings with the juice to help keep it cool.  My only suggestion is to add in the recipe that the beverages should be chilled completely before making the punch, for people not familiar with making punches.

I made this today for a baby shower and went thru 4 batches of it!  Some adjustments though.  Used a liter of Sprite, a 64 oz. jug of white grape juice, 2 packets of Berry Blue Kool Aid Mix, and used pineapple sherbet on top instead of ice cream.  Everyone LOVED it!  I put rubber duckies with swim rings around them on top and it was so cute!!

only 3 stars- there was punch left over and I don't think we will be drinking it.  Just so-so.  I made this for a girl using strawberry kool-aid and white cran/strawberry juice.  The vanilla flavor was odd and looked all gloopy on the top.

This was so yummy.  I halved the recipe and put one scoop of ice cream in each tall glass and then poured the rest of the punch over like a float.  It was pretty and delicious!

I made this punch for a baby shower only we went to 4 stores and could find every color of drink mix BUT blue!  So we went with a red.  We got RAVES for it!!! The only thing is that after a while the ice cream kinda turned into a scummy layer and the red punch separated from juice- not appetizing to look at in the glass (hence the 4 stars).  I would suggest you make it in a half batch and store the rest in the fridge for refills.  This was GREAT!!!!

What a hit!  Made this for my best friend's baby shower and everyone asked for the recipe.  Both grandmas were happy with the baby blue color, and commented on it a lot.
I omitted the sugar- I like things tart, and it was really good.  You also will need to stir this often, so that the foam on top doesn't start to look unappealing.
Great punch!!  Delicious!

This was a very easy and cute recipe. However, i needed a pink punch for a girl, so I made some adjustments. I used cherry kool-aid, and then used a white cran-strawberry juice instead of just plain cranberry and used a 2 liter of sprite. I also forgot to add the sugar, but it still tasted great! This was a huge hit!

I've made this punch a few times now and have never had any left over.  It is always a big hit.  However, I can no longer find blue colored kool-aid. So, I used invisible raspberry kool-aid and added drops of blue food coloring to achieve the color I wanted.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Use your imagination on this one! :-)

Literally every shower whether baby or bridal that I attend I am almost always asked to make this punch. Everyone just loves it. and it' s so great because you can make it just about any color you need. I have made it with blueberry, cherry, strawberry and grape kool-aid packets and no matter the flavor I use it is always great!! I use white grape juice instead of cranberry but other than that I do everything as instructed. I also make a fruit ring using sprite, pineapple and cherries to put in it.

First of all, I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it is written. The most important thing to me is that this tastes like your typical punch.  No surprises there.  Second most important, The ice cream works just fine.  Many reviewers have reported problems here, but I just used plain Blue Bunny vanilla in the one gallon container and it worked without any issues.  I floated two rubber duckies in it and my punch looked EXACTLY like the punch in the picture above.  Looked very cute, tasted fine, giving 5 stars for a great punch recipe.

made this punch for a baby shower for a boy then made some changes and then made it again for a girl but instead used unsweetened raspberry mix and raspberry sherbert to make it a pink color and it worked just as well!

This punch is awesome. I didn't change a thing. I even used the rubber ducky idea. I made this for my daughter's baby shower and it was a big hit! Just a note, the rubber duckies may not float well until the ice cream has melted down some.  The thick froth made by the ice cream helps to hold them up.  Make extra if you make this! I ran out because it was soooo good.

This was the best punch I have ever had, loved the combination of favors. We made it with "Kool-Aid" Ice Blue Raspberry Lemonade flavor and had raspberry vodka on the side for guests who wanted that little extra kick.

SUCH a cute idea!  I made a similar punch to this for a girl baby shower and it was fantastic but like your idea of adding icecream!
I'm going to try this punch out at a boy baby shower this weekend!   Complete w/ duckies and all!   :o)

I love this recipei! It was delicious and it was such a cute idea, I had tons of compliments. I bought the rubber duck and rubber duck baby bath from my friends baby registry and served in that (cleaned of course) so both cute and a fun way to give a gift. Will use again!

Love this punch! I made it last year for my daughters
beach theme bridal shower. I needed a purple punch for my nieces shower and just used red cranberry juice instead of the white. I used pineapple sherbert instead of icecream.

Love this recipe.  I threw my sister a Rubber Duckie themed baby shower and everyone loved this idea.  Not only is it creative, but it really taste good.  I did have to double the ingredients (thank god I buy two of everything, just in case), only because my punch bowl was big.  Try it, you're ganna love it.  Oh, and it's super easy to make.  Pour...Mix...and Dollop!

I used this idea of blue punch for my son's 1st birthday which was Airplane/Clouds theme. With the blue coloring and the white ice cream clouds it was perfect to emulate clouds for the party!

This was a real hit at my daughter's baby shower.  We had to use white grape juice because we could not locate white cranberry juice.  Be sure to use only the 8 scoops of ice cream as the recipe states.  It tends to get rather goopy if you add more ice cream.

I made this recipe for a baby shower on March 21, 2009.  I couldn't find the unsweetened blue drink mix, so I instead used Rose's Cocktail Infusions in Blue Raspberry.  It is non-alcoholic but I found it in the alcohol mixers section of the grocery store.  It is quite sweet so I omitted the sugar.  The punch was a great success, though a bit sweet overall for my taste.  Others loved it though!

WOW!  I was looking for a punch recipe for a baby shower that was blue...I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm sooo glad I did!  The only thing I changed was instead of white cranberry I used whie cranberry peach juice (because I couldn't find just white cranberry)Let's just say the punch was a HIT and the bowl was EMPTY at the end of the party!

I made this for one of my best friend's baby shower about a year and a 1/2 ago and everyone loved it. Even though she was having a girl  I still made it blue because it looked kinda like water. I didn't have any problem with the Ice cream and it gave the punch a really good flavor. My brother is getting married next weekend and I'm going to be making punch for that and since I got such good feed back on it last time I'm going to use it again just making a few modifactions. I'm gonna make it a strawberry flavor instead. That you so much for shareing this.

I thought this punch was very tasty.  I ended up using white grape juice because I couldn't find white cranberry juice.  If I make it again, I will either find white cranberry juice or maybe do a mix of grape juice and pineapple juice.  I thought that the grape juice didn't provide enough contrast of flavor.  Still, it tasted great and it was so cute.  I got a lot of compliments on the punch.

Hard to find "baby boy" punch recipes. I had a LOT leftover from one batch, so it wasn't a huge hit at our shower.  Everyone did comment on the pretty color though.

Personally, I wasn't crazy about the texture or consistency of melting ice cream in the punch.

I gave this to my future mother-in-law to make for my future sister-in-law last weekend for her baby shower. (my wedding is way in the future!) It was a big hit! I think there was only a cup or two left. The mom-to-be really liked it, too, because she loves rubber duckies! Great flavor and very pretty color for presentation!

I used this recipe at my daughter's baby shower.  It was a hit!  I used white grape juice in place of the white cranberry juice.  I didn't need to add any additional sugar.  Wait to put it together right before or after the guests arrive.  By the time the shower is over, the ice cream has melted and it doesn't look so pretty, but it still tastes good!

I made this for a shower and it was a hit.  After hitting 6 different grocerie stores to find the right ingredients, i finally found everything. Next time I'll just substitute.  I was just asked for this recipe again today for a girl.

We couldn't find the white cranberry juice, so I used white grape juice instead. It tasted really good! The only thing is, it was a little on the sweet side. I might omit the sugar next time.

I have used this recipe about 3 times now. I have gotten nothing but compliments on it saying how good it is. It is hard to find punch recipes that are blue and this one is the best esp. for baby boy showers.

Made this for my son's 2nd birthday which had a Blue's Clues theme.  The kids of course loved it, and most of the adults enjoyed it two.  We went through 2 batches and there wasn't a drop left.  It is very sweet though, so next time I wouldn't put as much sugar.  I also had trouble finding plain white cranberry juice so used white grape instead.

I made this punch for my grandson-to-be's shower.  It was a huge hit.  Everyone thought Martha Stewart had helped me plan the party!  LOL!  Anyway, I didn't buy enough ingredients and had to send my daughter out to buy more.  We went through 4 batches for about 20 people!  It was great!

Presentation is half of the game, I am using this recipe for my daughters baby shower, we believe she's having a little girl but little girls take bath's too and the rubber duck floating on the top is just the perfect touch.

I made this for my friends baby shower today, she's having a little boy and I just loved the idea of a blue punch. Well, so did everyone else! I had to refill the big 18 qt punch bowl I had in a matter of 15 minutes! It was a different taste and I would have never thought of using vanilla ice cream but it counteracts the tartness of the white cranberry juice. I would, however, recommend using the sugar that the recipe calls for unless you want to see your guests faces puckering up!

This was a huge hit at my daughters baby shower. She was having a girl so I had to change up a few things to make it pink. I did leave out the sugar because I used White Cranberry Peach juice instead of just the white cranberry and I used strawberry crystal light instead of koolaide. It was wonderful. Everyone just raved about it!

I made this today for my new sister-in-laws baby shower.  It was such a hit.  I had to make one adjustment; only because the store did not have any white cranberry juice.  They only had white cranberry peach.  It was tasty as well.  I was worried that since I don't drink soda, that the carbonation would not agree with me.  However, it was so light that I had another cup full.  Some was even taken home so others could try it.  This is a good party drink.

I can only give it 4 stars since I didn't follow the exact directions! I used gallon sized jug of blue hawaiian punch, 1/2 gal white grape juice and 2 liter of sprite instead.  Used 1/4 gallon of vanilla ice cream. Floated the duckies in it....perfect.

This was super cute! I changed the recipe a bit because I made it for a baby girl. I used strawberry KoolAid & White Cran-Strawberry juice. It was so yummy! It tasted like a creamy, strawberry, soda/milkshake. Every one loved it!

This was a hit as I knew it would be from the reviews. I used one gallon blue punch, 2L sprite and 1 bottle white grape juice. It would not all fit in the punch bowl at once so I used equal parts. Vanilla ice cream worked very well and The ducks were a bonus!!! Thank you for sharing this

I was making this punch for a little girl baby shower, so I took the suggestions of previous users and used Strawberry Kool-Aid and Cran Strawberry juice.  It turned almost a red color but the froth on top was pink.  It tasted really good, but because it was so sweet, most people did not drink it.  Though I did have someone ask me for the recipe.  The best thing about this recipe is that it is soooo easy to make.  I had a few people comment that the ducks looked like slices of lemons, though they were ducks with baby diapers and pacifiers.  I would suggest that you use colored ducks.

This was a very fun punch for a Boy Baby Shower I gave for a friend.  Everyone loved the color and the duck floating in the middle was adorable.  It was pretty sweet though so I probably would have cut back on the sugar a little.

I made this any it turned out great... the only thing is that once the ice cream melted it blended into the liquid and it started to look unappealing. Overall it was a hit and tasted good..

I have used this punch numerous times for different themed parties.  As a blue punch, it works well for luau and beach parties.  For baby showers where the gender of the baby is unknown, I have made a bowl of blue and a bowl of pink (using pink koolaid).  Wonderfully flexible, delicious, and always a big hit!

Like several others have posted, I could not find white cranberry juice, so substituted white grape juice instead, which turned out great.  I did not use any sugar, but I think the next time I will put at least 1/4 cup.  However, a full cup would be too sweet for my taste.  Even without the sugar, we went through two batches!  Wonderful receipe and was perfect for the baby boy shower that I made it for!  The rubber ducky floating on top is a must!

I made this punch for a baby shower this past weekend, and everyone loved it. They thought it was the cutest thing in the world. I floated little mini "career" ducks on the top. It was really good and definately broke the ice and got people talking. I will for sure make this again.

This was great and the guests for the party went through two batches of this.  Our other drinks were untouched.  We did NOT add any sugar, and used red kool-aid instead of blue since the party was honoring a baby girl.  The punch tasted great without any sugar, and couldn't imagine needing any.

it was good and soooo easy.
i make fruit juice ice rings. and used whitecrangrape bc that is all they had.  i did not add the extra sugar.  it was all gone in a flash and there were plenty of other drinks.  i made mine green bc it was a garden party and i think that was not good.  i got a few negative comments about the color, eg. green slime, snot, etc.  anyway,  maybe for a little boys party but not green for grown ups.

In looking for a punch recipe for my daughter's birthday party, I came across this one. We experimented today and it was great! Being a girl, we wanted pink, and the only red flavor we could find was black cherry. I paired this with pineapple juice and gingerale. By itself it was just ok, but adding the vanilla icecream made it absolutely wonderful... we just couldn't get enough! I'm looking forward to making it for my daughter's party on Saturday. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party that had a "blue" theme.  It was EXCELLENT and everyone raved about it.  Used white grape juice as I could not find white cranberry.  Very good punch!

I also used white grape juice instead of white cranberry.  This was for a Holiday party with a "Winter Blues" theme.  The first person who tried it said it was "awful" and three others said it was way too sweet.  Then a handful of other guests thought it was way too tart.  I made 10 gallons and had about 5 gallons left over (serving 120 people).  Probably not something I will try again.

I added a couple drops of blue food coloring.  I also used apple juice instead of cranberry juice.

I made this punch for my daughter-in-law baby shower, everyone loved it. She is having a boy and so this was prefect. I froze the ice cream into balls and as they melted they look like soap. I also put the rubber ducks in the bowl, we were have rubber duck theme. Yummy.

I used this recipe for my sister's baby shower, and it was a big hit.  I have had several mishaps with punch in the past, but this recipe was easy and delicious!  The kids loved the blue color.

This tasted great, but the color didn't turn out well for me and the bowl looked dirty even though I used regular vanilla (not vanilla bean) ice cream.  Not sure how to get that great blue color.  Will try again though.

We recently made this for my baby shower, I am expecting a boy and didn't want pink punch! Everyone loved it! I was pleased at how beautiful it turned out! The ice cream looked like fluffy clouds on top! So cute and it was absolutely delicious!

I added a toothpick dipped in food coloring gel a couple of times to get the blue I was looking for. Used rainbow sherbet instead of ice cream and the second batch was better than the first. The difference was I added the cranberry juice and sugar first and stirred, then the lemon lime soda. 2 gallons got gone quick.

Everyone LOVED IT!!! I just used one huge thing of blue typhoon Hawaiian punch, one lemon lime soda and one white grape juice. I wanted my punch to look like clouds and IT DID! You don't have to use sherbet USE vanilla ice cream like it says folks, Trust me! I bought two of everything besides the ice cream. I kept adding everything to it as it was disappearing. I was skeptical with everyone saying they were using sherbet, no get the ice cream!

Made this for it’s a boy baby shower and it was a big hit. I used the blue Hawaiian Punch and added white cranberry juice and 7 Up. The vanilla ice cream was a great added touch. I floated blue rubber duckies but if it wasn’t for a baby shower or kids party I would omit the duckies. Everyone thought it wasn’t too sweet and a very refreshing drink. 
I refrigerated all of the ingredients so I eliminated using any ice. The frozen ice cream didn’t melt and make a gooey mess as some people experienced.

I made this for a baby shower for a mom expecting a boy.  The punch was just OK -- not one I would necessarily make again.  I had to throw out over half of it -- for a shower with about 20 guests.  I did use white pineapple sherbet based on the other reviewer's comments on the vanilla ice cream not working well.  Also, be sure you use a clear or white juice if you want a blue punch.  I used pineapple juice and thought it would be clear enough to still have blue punch.  I was wrong -- the punch was a very definite green!

I don't know if it is because I was trying to make this in the fall or not, but I had a hard time finding blue drink mix. I finally managed to find the blue Hawaiian Punch. I did want to sub pineapple sherbet, but that was impossible to find in my area. I ended up with Blue Hawaiian Punch, 2L Sprite, white grape juice, and vanilla ice cream. It was a hit. Definitely add the Sprite after all the other ingredients if you want there to be some foam.

I made this using for a baby shower using the suggestions...2-liter bottle of sprite, big container of blue Hawaiian Punch, half a container of white grape juice, scoops of pineapple sherbet. It was so tasty...but all of my guests were going for the wine, so I pulled out some marshmallow flavored vodka (that I had leftover from a hot chocolate bar) & said 'you can spike it if you want'... then they started drinking it. So yummy, either way!

Turned out great! Couldn't find any unflavoured crystals and needed pink instead of blue punch. Did NOT add any sugar but added a few drops of raspberry lemonade concentrate instead of drink crystals and sugar. Just add a few drops and then sample to get the right concentration of flavour/sweetness. The ice cream worked well. Recommend only adding half the juice, half the pop and half the ice cream to start (my punch bowl wasn't big enough to hold all ingredients at once). Just kept topping it up as required during the baby shower until I had used all the juice and pop - don't forget to top the ice cream up too!

This punch is great!  Our grocery didn't have white cranberry juice so I had to substitute in white grape juice and we used koolaid blueberry lemonade in the unsweetened packet since that was the only blue powdered drink we could find.  It came out so pretty!

I made the easy punch and turned it pink with crystal light pink lemonade .  Added white grape juice, Sprite and Truvia for the sugar and a few raspberries instead of the ice cream

People said it was great and several asked for the recipient.

Super simple--I loved that

I made this recipe twice.  Today was for a Disney Frozen theme party. I cut the sugar to a half cup and used white grape juice in place of cranberry juice. I also put blue sugar crystals on the scoops of floating ice cream for a glitter effect. Everyone loved it and I was asked for the recipe multiple times.

This is the second time I've made this punch and I absolutely LOVE it, SO EASY, only 5 ingredients to remember at the store, and it is DELICIOUS!!! 

This time I'm actually making it for a girl's baby shower so I'm using White Cranberry Strawberry Juice (Clover Valley i.e. dollar general brand) and Sierra Mist ($1 per 2 L @ Dollar General) and also I'm using Stawberry KoolAid Mix so it will be red but turn pink with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, this is store brand also! DELISH!

one other TIP for you is to add the lemon lime soda with sugar FIRST when mixing, otherwise you might end up with a counter full of sticky KoolAid Inspired punch! (OPPS ON MY PART)

Did not  have an enjoyable (or even pleasant) flavor. The ice cream separating & looking 'curdled' was off-putting.  Will never make again

I made this for my friend's shower and it was perfect.  I couldn't find plain white cranberry juice, so I got white cranberry peach and it tasted good (only added 1/2 cup sugar).  I think the blue drink mix might make a difference as well to the flavor.  Everyone loved the way it looked!  (If I get pics, I'll post.)

I made this for a coworker's baby shower and it was a huge hit.  However, I put all of the ingredients together and did a taste test before adding the cup of sugar. 

It was delicious without the sugar, so I didn't add it.  It's plenty sweet without.  But the combination of the 'lemon-lime soda' (I used Sprite Zero) and the white grape juice with the blue flavoring packet (I used 2 Hawaiian Punch individual flavor packets - my local grocery didn't have any blue Kool-Aid) and ice cream was delicious.

I'm glad the punch bowl was only big enough for a half batch -- I have plenty left over to make some at home!

Made this today for my grandson's baby shower, it was a huge hit! I could only find Hawaiin Punch Polar Express at the store, so I used Welch's Blue Raspberry drink instead. I also used white grape juice, ginger ale and pineapple sherbert. The ginger ale was good, but it turned the drink blue-green so I will use lemon-lime soda the next time. I stirred in the sherbert as I didn't like the lumps on top, and it helped the color be more blue but still left a nice foam on the top. Some guest mixed the punch equally with white wine, it was really great that way too!

I only used half a cup of sugar. I got lots of compliments on it. People who said that they usually don't care for punch were talking about how good it was. We used Blue Bell Vanilla ice cream in it. I don't know how many scoops we used but it was about half of the 1/2 gallon container. Also, for the carbonated beverage, we used Sprite. 
If I ever make punch again, I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Great and fun recipe! I did modify things a bit because I couldn't find plain white cranberry juice, so I used white grape juice. Also, last minute I decided to halve the sugar amount to avoid adding too much so I only used about 1/2 a packet of powder mix & 1/2 cup of sugar. It turned out great! I can see where people may not like the ice cream because it can look clumpy after sitting awhile (at least an our), but it didn't affect the taste one bit. My 2-year old loved the floating duck for his birthday! Can't wait to try different colors!

This recipe worked well, and people seemed to like it. I could not find blue drink mix, I didn't read other reviews about using Blue Hawaiian Punch, I wish I did. I used Blue Rasberry Martini Mix, it did work but it didn't add much flavor.

This recipe turned out great!! I was nervous about using the blue drink mix but it tasted really really good. All of my party guests loved it. I couldn't find white cranberry juice so I used white grape juice and it was perfect!!

It tasted GREAT!  And it was very easy to make.  The blue color works great for a baby boy shower.  I will use this recipe again, and in fact gave it to a friend to use.
