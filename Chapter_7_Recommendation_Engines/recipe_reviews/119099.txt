Well, my huband loves hot dogs and this had his name written all over it! We didn't bother wrapping the hot dogs in foil - just slap 'em right on the grill. We warmed the rolls and the heat from that and the dogs melted the cheese. The chopped tomato was a nice change from ketchup. All we added was a little mustard, as if you could possibly add any more to this... besides a cold beer!

These were great.  My wife never asks for seconds and she had a second dog. It takes a little more time for something that really never takes time but they were good.  Next time I will use my warming racks and not the direct grill - I had a burned bun.

This was a big hit.  Very simple and you do not need any condiments (ketchup, mustard, chili, etc.).  It's nice to fix hot dogs that do not require 10 other items on the table to complete the meal. I think that the mixture used on this would also be great on turkey burgers/hamburgers.  I will be trying this next.

I didn't grill these just boiled the hot dogs and threw the buns in the oven and toasted them up. I thought I would miss the ketchup and mustard, but I really didn't. I would eat my hot dog this way again.

Nice change from the typically served dog. The kids said it was like a taco hot dog. Only mustard was added to mine. No need for anything else and nobody asked. I put everything together and placed in pan with foil over the top on low until everyone was done with homework and ready to eat.

I have made Hot Dogs like this for over 10 years and my husband loves them of course he thinks he has to add jalapenos. Personally I leave off the relish and add sliced avacados to mine YMMM !!!

These were not bad, but not special.  Probably won't make them again.
