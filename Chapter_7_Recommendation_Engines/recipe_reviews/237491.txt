I used one green and one red bell pepper instead of the mushroom and used Velveeta and cheddar cheese in 1:1 ratio and using only 2 lbs of cheese total in 3/4 cup of chicken broth.

The amount of chicken listed as two chicken breasts should be 8-10 oz of chicken breast total, I think.

Then I cooked the chicken breasts first by boiling them in some water until cooked and then diced it. I was nice as the meat shredded into the sauce.

I also cooked the chorizo separately before putting it in the mix.  It browned nicely. The chorizo I got had roughly diced meat, so after browning it, I placed it through the food processor to make a finer chop.

I served it with both tortilla chips and soft corn tortillas, as well as guacamole and sour cream.  My guests enjoyed it tremendously. Some of them even made quesadillas with it.

I gave it 5 stars for the chicken broth idea.  So smart.  Keeps it from burning to the pan.  I made mine with drained organic salsa, canned green chilis and cubed linguica.  The bomb.

I have only ever melted American cheese with milk in the past and clearly I have been doing it wrong all of these years. The chicken broth melted it into a perfect consistency without it burning all over the sides of the pan and it only took minimal stirring. I love mushrooms but they really seemed out of place in this recipe to me and so I left them out. I also left out the 8oz. of cheddar in the end. I had it but it just wasn't necessary and that is why I am giving this a 4 instead of 5 star rating. The consistency was perfect after the chicken was added and it would have been entirely too thick if the additional cheese would have been added. Overall this was delicious but I recommend eating in small doses due to the amount of sodium.

Great idea to use broth. It tasted great.  I miss having the occasional Friday night Mexican restaurant now that I've moved to the Northeast.  My daughter's favorite.

Modified the recipe, used cilantro, garlic, one fresh tomato and two cans of Rotel.  I subbed shrimp for chicken.  It was very tasty.  I will attempt to post a pic.

Made this for my cats quinceria party and our friends loved it!  I skipped the chicken and mushrooms  othwise followed the recipe. Outstanding!  Too mich to fit in a small slow cooker if that’s what you’re planning.   Also used a half pound of chorizo. Using high quality Wisconsin cheddar cheese made all the difference.

Nice texture and tasted good. Instead of mushrooms I put green and red pepper in. Next time I think I will add hot sauce
