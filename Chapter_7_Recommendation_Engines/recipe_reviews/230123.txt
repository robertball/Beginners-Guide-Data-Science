Made this for a salsa competition at work, and coworkers devoured it! It was gone.
The heat comes on slowly and you can really taste the mango when you first put it into your mouth. NOTES: 1) The recipe ingredients call for vegetable oil, but you really need olive oil (see the directions); 2) I did not add as much salt as the recipe calls for. I adjusted this recipe for 30 servings, which called for 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of salt! I added barely 2 tablespoons of salt, and that was perfect.

This is more savory and oniony than I was hoping for. I could barely taste the mango and ended up adding peaches to give it a balance of hot to sweet. For my taste, this isn't working.

I made this salsa but instead of a habanero I used a homegrown Trinidad Scorpion Butch-T pepper.  Given the spicyness of this pepper I doubled everything else.  I was delicious! Next time I will reduce the salt because it was a tad salty for me!

Terrific salsa! Hot, sweet and easy to make. I'm amazed at how one habanero pepper can heat up the salsa.

I used two habanero peppers instead of one and, changed out the ground cumin for half a teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder. I also used one very large and very ripe Manilla mango, half pureed and half cubed.

Turned out rather well for my first attempt at a mango habanero salsa. Hot. Very hot. Even after seeding the habaneros.

Seems perfect for a lightly seasoned (only salt and pepper) fish like red fish or black drum...maybe even sheephead.

I was planning to serve a variety of salsas at a work potluck and while I really don't like cilantro most people do so I decided to try this recipe as I had everything on hand and it was very different from my other selections.  I was really intrigued by this idea, so after reading other reviews I used a whole mango and a whole small sweet onion coated with olive oil and sprinkled with a caribbean sea salt.  After I got it pureed with the remaining ingredients I thought it lacked acid and flavor, but as I was having trouble getting past the flavor of the cilantro I left it alone.  Sadly it was the least popular of all my suggestions, but I still find myself wanting to play around with the idea.  Thank you so much for the inspiration!

Amazing salsa only thing i changed was i use a whole mango instead of a half. Also if you blend it well and add it to some tortilla chips with some chicken and then put all your cheese ontop and bake them it makes incredible nachos.

Very flavorful salsa the first time I made it everybody loved it, I needed a little more of a kick. This go around I  used a Peach Ghost Pepper instead, a little more mango and a little more lime juice. It's still awesome and much much hotter. Will definitely be making it again.

Very tasty,  I recommend having someone with you when you make this, so you don't eat it all yourself
