Very good! As the other review said, you could tweak the filling and it would still be an easy, yummy calzone. We liked the pie crust vs a pizza doughy bread crust. Next time I'll add pepperoni bits instead of chicken, maybe even add pineapple bits :-)

5 for quick and easy!  We liked it and will make again.  We tweaked the ingredients some - based on who liked what - which made it even more convenient for a family with different taste buds.

I used a jar of pizza sauce and that was just the right amount.  I also changed around the ingredients for our liking.

I used fresh thyme and sage, ground chicken and ground beef.  Instead of pie crust I used pizza dough for single serving calzones. People loved it.

I used the No-Yeast Pizza Crust recipe by Missy for these.  Super easy dough to make and I let everyone put their own fillers in.  Thanks!
