I'm a little confused that this recipe got mixed reviews as I LOVE IT! I did make very minor changes, which probably would make a difference. I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne to the marinade for a kick and I typically only use about 3/4 lb of shrimp (obviously making the seasonings more intense). 

This is honestly in my top 5 recipes I've found on this site. It's light, healthy, quick, and full of flavor. Thanks for sharing, this makes dieting so much easier.

Really good!  I realized before dinner I didn't have enough tortillas so I just served it over rice and it was great.  Okay, so I don't like zuccini - I swapped it out for a can of black beans.  Very good.

This was very quick and easy.  I used canned corn instead of frozen and I cooked the shrimp right in with the veggies to save pots (I hate dishes).  It was really tasty and quick enough for a weeknight dinner!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

My wife and I thought this was great although we did make a few changes. We didnt have any corn so we sub'd in bell pepper and then added about a half teaspoon cayanne to the marinade, fallowed the rest and it came out great. We will be making this often.

Quick and simple, for a little heat and some Tex-Mex flavor; take a dozen or so of tomatillos, 2 red onions 1/4rd,6 jalapenos toss them in a little olive oil and roast in a 400 degree oven until they begin to brown, about 20 min. Remove from oven season with s&p and puree in a food processor. Spread this mixture on your tortilla before you stuff it with the shrimp mixture. use as much as your tongue can handle. Enjoy...

Everyone at my table enjoyed these fajitas.  Very easy to make. I used cooked, frozen shrimp. I think it would be best to use raw shrimp for this. I served this with fresh avocado and some fresh salsa. Very yummy.

I was looking forward to trying these because I love all of the ingredients.  Unfortunately, we just didn't care for them.  They were pretty bland.

Very good recipe-- Can be altered I think to taste and ingredients on hand-- I added cherry tomatoes towards  the end and a fresh ear of corn--and served with sliced avocados and salsa. What I liked especially about this recipe was the marinade and the delightful taste it gave the shrimp.

Pretty good!  I made them as written except I also added some fresh chopped tomato in at the end.  They could have used a little more seasoning of some sort, but I still enjoyed them.  Thanks!

Hmm... I sort of expected more from this recipe and was let down. The flavour was a little bland and the dish a little boring. Sorry!

Very, very good.  Used corn tortillas warmed in the microwave for 35 seconds.  That was the only change I made.

Delicious and simple. I did add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper b/c we like things spicy. The marinade was good, and I love that it was 15 min. On the veggies, I squirted it with a bit of lime juice and a dash of cumin. Yum!

Pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of shrimp in fajitas and tacos, etc.  The shrimp were very well seasoned and I like the addition of the corn in the mix.  I added some sour cream to my fajita.  We also didn't use a red onion, we used a white onion, which didn't make a huge difference.

I doubled the seasoning, deleted chili powder and added cajun pepper. After adding the shrimp and veggies, I added lemon juice, dashed with lemon pepper. Served on small wheat flour tortilla with toppings. Kinda bland for our taste without adding the cajun, lemon pepper.

The shrimp and veggies were pretty good; I actually didn't make tacos, but instead served everything over brown rice.  For the veggie mixture, I used 1 zucchini, 1/2 a large vidalia onion, 1 zucchini and an orange bell pepper... then I added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 small tomatoes (diced, seeds removed), a can of corn and some salt and pepper and crushed red pepper.  Everything was great mixed together (note I poured the marinade in with the shrimp, so there was a little sauce).  The cilantro added a great finishing touch to tie everything together.  Thanks for the great idea, Cyndi!

My daughter made this for my birthday dinner and it was delicious. Nice change from a heave meal and the flavors were wonderful.  She cut back on the onion since it looked like a lot, but after tasting, we decided we could have added more onion.  REALLY LIKE THIS AND WILL MAKE MYSELF.   Thanks for the recipe.

These were pretty good, but I really wasn't fond of the marinade. There was something about the Worcestershire sauce mixed with shrimp that made me not like the flavors together so much. The vegetable mix is excellent, I could eat that alone as a side dish. I would probably try this again, but maybe use something instead of the Worcestershire. Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

These are amazingly good, and yet so simple.  The zucchini, onion, and corn are perfect with the marinated shrimp. I used to make Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas, but this will be my new shrimp fajita recipe from now on.

My husband and I LOVED these.  The only thing I changed was corn tortillas instead of flour becase that's what we prefer.  We also topped them with sour cream & guacamole.

This was delicious! I too omitted the zucchini, adding black beans and some red and green bell pepper instead.  The marinade was perfect and everything tasted great.  I'll be making this many more times.

Really good! Did what others recommended and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne to the marinade and then a sprinkle of cumin and some lime juice to the veggies (instead of zucchini, I used 1 can of black beans and 1 red pepper) and added chopped tomatoes at the end. I may increase to 1 tsp of cayenne for even more zing next time!
We'll be making this again!  Nice and easy to make.

Very flavorful & healthy dish.  We substituted crushed red pepper for the chili powder and Chipoltle pepper cheese for the Monterey Jack, which really enhanced the flavor.  Definitely recommend and plan to make again!

Oh My God, these fajitas are amazing. I have made them twice and they are so good.  I chopped the cilantro and put it into the marinade and I added crushed pepper flakes instead of the chili powder. It has so much flavor. Thanks for a great recipe, I will definately make this over and over again.

Unfortunately, I did not like one thing about this recipe.  On paper everything looks great.  But when you put it together... oh my.  The marinade is strange.  Didn't care for it at all, particularly the worchestershire.  Then the combo of zucchini, onions, and corn wasn't very appealing.  The cheese added nothing to enhance the flavors. I even tried to salvage it will a hefty dallop of sour cream, but it didn't help.  I really wanted to love it.  Sorry.

Good, but a little too sweet, maybe add spice and less corn

My husband likes any dish with shrimp, but this one was really special -- delicious, easy, just spicy enough.  Even the zucchini tasted great.

Love the marinade!  It works for most everything--I marinated chicken breasts and it was delicious. I substituted red bell pepper for zucchini, and cut everything into long strips so it fit in the tortilla better.

This was pretty good.  I added red peppers and smothered with salsa and sour cream, but otherwise kept the recipe as it.  The vegetables were a nice combination.

Yum! I omitted the corn and added mushrooms and extra of the other vegetables. To cut down on mess, I cooked the shrimp in the same pan with the vegetables, after the vegetables were pretty soft. I also used whole wheat tortillas. Everyone raved about these! Thanks!

The corn added a nice sweetness to the other veggies.  I added a bit of chipotle powder to the marinade and let it soak for several hours.  I only had cooked shrimp in the freezer, so made sure to just heat it up with the veggies at the end.  And I'd love to have used fresh cilantro, but dried mixed in with the veggies had to do.  Garnished with sour cream instead of cheese.

Easy to throw together for a quick dinner.  I would have liked more "oomph" as it tasted somewhat plain.  Perhaps a longer marinade time or additional seasonings would do the trick.  I loved the addition of corn and zucchini to the fajitas - never thought of doing that, but will include those next time I make fajitas.  Great way to get in those veggies!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were great! I didn't have any limen juice, so I used vinegar (half of what was called for) and in place of zucchini, I used cucumbers (they were great)! My shrimp were already precooked, so I mixed the remaining shrimp marinade with some fat free sour cream, and topped the quesadillas - and they were amazing! I didn't have any chili powder, so i used a half a packet of fajita seasoning, and it was perfect. Will use again!

Cyndi,this is a wonderful meal! I wasn't too sure about the zucchini in a fajitas but it was greaat! I used 2 cans of chipolte white corn I found in the grocery store today and I used diced red onions and it was delish! I have been told that I have to make it again. What does that tell you?

Good Fajitas. I did make some modifications to fit my family's taste. I added cilantro, mexican hot sauce, green chiles, crushed garlic, liquid smoke, and onion powder to the marinade and let it marinade for 2 hours instead of 15 minutes. Also I substituted the zuchinni and red onions with white onions, red and yellow bell peppers for my veggies and grilled both the veggies and shrimp. This was delicious. Thanks.

My husband loved this dish! I used canned corn instead of frozen and added red and green bell peppers. I didn't have any chili powder so I used red pepper flakes. Topped with mozzy cheese. Delicious! The DH already asked to make it again with steak. Thanks :)

Really good!  Just added a few drops of hot sauce and small can of green chillies to marinade to spice it up as others suggested. I substituted sliced red and green bell peppers for zucchini.  Pretty simple and will definitely make again.

This is extremely tasty and easy to make. Instead of zucchini, I sauteed peppers and onions in addition to the corn. Once finished, used whole wheat wraps, sides of guac, cheese and sour cream to make this dish complete! I recommend this to any shrimp or fajita lover.

Good, but not as good as the reviews suggested. I thought the marinade tasted a bit heavy on the chili powder, and I would reduce it next time. It was colorful and healthy though and very good with jack cheese on top, even w/o tortillas.

So good!  The veggies might taste even better if they marinated in some extra sauce -- will have to try next time.  Served with avocado. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not a big fan...had ok flavor, but I don't think the zucchini and shrimp complimented eachother well. I ended up putting some homemade guacamole on it and that helped.

Really tasty. I just couldn't deal with cleaning, peeling and deveining shrimp this week so I bought a bag of frozen precooked and cleaned shrimp and marinated them in the mixture for a couple of days in the fridge. I went lighter on the corn and added in red onion and garlic to the veggie mix. I left off the cheese and topped with cabbage and fat free sour cream. It was just delish.

As indicated by others, the marinade for the shrimp is great.  However, I found the zucchini and corn mixture to be somewhat bland.  I omitted the onions due to personal preference so this may have contributed to the lack of taste.  In order to spice up the veggie mixture, I added some onion powder, garlic powder, salt and some soy sauce while cooking.  It helped a good bit.

Very tasty.  I added 1/2t cayenne pepper for some kick and left out the corn and served it on a jalapeno/cilantro wrap.  Next time I make this, I will reduce the worcestershire sauce (not my favorate) and serve it over rice.

I have not tried this recipe yet but have worked with all of the ingredients.
I'm not sure the caloric amount is right.
seems awfully high for shrimp,veggies,cheese and a wrap!
If you use low or no fat cheese and a low cal low carb wrap I would say it should be around 300 to 400 calories tops!
