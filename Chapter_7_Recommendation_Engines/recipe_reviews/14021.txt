1 - 40 1/2 oz kidney beans, rinsed and drained
2 - 16 oz great northern white, "  "
2 - 16 oz black beans, "    "
2 - 16 oz vegetarian baked beans - not drained
1 - 28 oz  chunky crushed tomatoes in puree - " "
1 - 10oz rotel tomatoes, not drained

This is one of my favorite recipes, although I tweek it quite a bit.  For the seasoning, I always axe the oregano and add a chili mix in place of chili powder.  I always double or triple the tomatoes, using a variety of crushed, diced, puree, and whole tomatoes.  I found a small can of black bean soup in the goya aisle (in case anyone was still searching for black bean soup).

I, like other reviewers, could not find condensed black bean soup, so I used a ready to serve version.  I also made several alterations which resulted in the best veggie chili I've ever made!  I didn't add the italian spices, using only salt and a lot of chili powder.  I added two onions instead of one, added one package of Yves Veggie Ground Round (a soy fake ground beef like product), used one red, one yellow, and one green pepper (not to mention the six jalepenos), two diced portabella mushrooms, and since I wasn't sure if the canned tomatoes were diced or pureed, added a 28 oz can of each.  It was fantastic!!!

Wow!  This was so good.  I really couldn't imagine all of the flavors together, but the reviews were so good I wanted to try it.  As others have said, it was delicious and so, so easy.  Since we like spicy food, I did change the spices.  Rather than the spices from the recipe, I put in 3 Tbsp. chili powder, 2 Tbsp cumin, 2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 Tbsp salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.  My tomatoes weren't in puree so I added one can of tomato paste to thicken it a little and I used black beans rather than black bean soup.  I cooked it for about 3 hours in the slow cooker.  This is one that I will make again and again!  Thanks!

this was delicious! my whole family loved it!
i tend to like chili on the sweet side, so i added a tsp. of brown sugar. but then i read another reviewer's note that the recipe was too sweet on it's own.. so , i added a whole chopped tomato and about a tbs. of lemon juice. it came out perfect! i have repeated these additions with every other batch i've made. i like the extra tomato and the lemon adds a bit of a kick. i also cooked this on low for 6-7 hours and it was perfect. the vegetables were still a bit crunchy - just how we like them and the flavor was wonderful.

It's good but it is really sweet.Maybe omitting the baked beans and adding more kidney beans or maybe some pinto beans.This was a good recipe, if a little bland, but I added extra chili powder, tomatoes and some cumin and it was better.

Waste of time and money. Even my husband who will try anything thought it looked and tasted gross. Don't try it unless you really, really love beans a lot.

The recipe is a bit bland, but is a good base for adding your own "heat" to the chili. I took a clue from other reviewers, and cooked mine for 5 hours on high in my slow cooker, and it turned out just right. I also added cumin, some red pepper flakes, and a bit of salt because I used sodium-free canned items. Instead of the can of chopped tomatoes, I used a larger can of crushed tomatoes in puree.

This was wonderful-nice and spicy.  Two hours is a perfect amount of time in the slow cooker.

This was excellent! I made it for part of a class presentation and many people asked for the recipe. I made a few changes: I added a Tablespoon of Cumin, an extra Tablespoon of chili powder, and a sliced jalapeno pepper. I omitted the chopped tomatoes in puree and instead used a can of choppped tomatoes and a can of puree. I cooked it on low for 6 hrs. It was delicious, just the right amount of heat and spice. Next time I think I might try using another can of kidney beans instead of the garbanzo beans just to make it look more "chili-like".

FIVE STARS! I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could. 

Hands down one of the most delicious (and EASY) meals I've ever made. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Some notes:
- It makes A LOT. I had to split it into 2 batches to fit in my 3qt slow cooker

- black beans can replace the black bean soup and it will still taste awesome

- there isn't a lot of liquid here. We actually ate it on plates instead of from bowls 

- makes a GREAT chip dip for corn chips

- would be awesome in burritos

Simply a wonderful recipe that I will be making again and again. BRAVO!

I can't rate this completely accurately.  I do not usually alter the directions on this website, but as I was making it, I forgot I had used a half of the can of vegetarian baked beans I thought I had in the pantry (luckily, I still had a half can my daughter, the vegetarian had eaten over the weekend prior).  With only half the baked beans required, I also added about one cup of vegetable buillion.  I was cooking it all day on slow in a crockpot and it did not look like enough liquid (as it turned out, I was probably wrong on that assessment).  Because I added extra liquid, we added one cup of elbow macaroni (the Barilla plus type) for added volume and thickness.  My daughter, the vegetarian loved it.  I thought it was good, my wife (the meat and potato eater) did not like it and my son was mixed.  Felt it is a good starting point for any vegetarian chili. Not huge on oregano but used it anyway and added more chili powder.  Did not use cumin, but should have.  Overall, not bad.  Did like the chick peas and the texture of the celery.  Gave it some chewiness otherwise missing without meat.   
PS - As a cook for a strict vegetarian, hope the lady who added the bacon fat told the vegetarian at work she did that.  My daughter would freak out if I did that and served it to her.

I made the following changes: (1) used dry beans soaked overnight, 1/2 c each of black, kidney, and garbanzos and therefore changed the cook time to all day, about 9 hours. Also, did not drain the corn and added about 1 cup extra liquid for the beans to absorb.  (2) added some extra veggies, zucchini and carrot. (3) Added some extra seasoning, 1/2 fresh jalapeno, diced, 3 T chili powder instead of 1, 1 T cumin, and about 1 t cayenne.  It would have been rather bland and not chili-tasting without the additional spices, in my opinion.

This was a great recipe! Perfect for a quick prep meal to leave behind and come back to later! I made a few revisions--I added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the 15 oz. And I also added a packet of McCormick chili seasoning instead of all the little measurements in the recipe. I also used a red pepper instead of a green pepper. The recipe makes great leftovers and it's very filling. 8 servings seems just about right with the basic recipe. Fills the whole crock pot. This would be a very easy recipe to modify and add cooked ground beef or cooked veggie ground round to for a bit more 'oomph'. A nice low cost meal that carries over to the next day very well. We added a dollop of sour cream and approximately 1 tablespoon of cheddar for a garnish.

I made this chili last night and took it to work this evening.  OMG....the reviews were "outstanding" and nonstop!  Seriously...  Almost embarrassing...blush, blush!!  Soooo simple and quick to put together.  I actually had everything in the pantry and frig that I needed except for the green peppers and celery...but it still came out EXCELLENT!  I did not rinse or drain the beans..figured I could use the extra juice, so just threw everything in, all at once.  The only things I added was, a few shakes of sherry pepper sauce, approx 1/2 T. of bacon grease, and a pinch of celery seed.  I also used 2 T. of chili powder. I did not have black bean soup, so just used the beans.  And added 2 cans of the diced tomatoes with green chilies. The main "vegetarian" at my work place, absolutely LOVED it!  I had the cheese, sour cream and fresh cilantro on the side and they all added what they wanted.  Thank you ever so much for a great recipe.  My husband also said it was one of the few "crock pot" meals that he actually enjoyed.  It really is even better if you make it the day before, but my husband loved it even after just a few hours.  Thank you again.

Very tasty vegetarian recipe. I do make a few changes. I add an extra can of diced tomatoes (with mild zesty chilis) since it didn't seem to have enough liquid for my tastes. I also skip the baked beans. I found they gave the chili a sweet taste that I did not care for. FYI: Progresso sells the Black Bean Soup. There are also several other brands of soup that carry the Black Bean Variety. You have to look at the brands that are more natural and/or organic. They are usually separated from the other soups.

A good place to start for vegetarian chili.  We liked it, but it took some tweeking to get it close to our liking.  I think the problem for us was the baked beans, as someone mentioned before.  I think I'll omit them next time and use regular kidney beans or chili beans.  I also couldn't find black bean soup, and was going to make my own to add, but simply didn't have the time.  Regular black beans worked great.  If you have the time to plan, make this chili a day ahead and let the spices really get to blend.  This chili was then best when we reheated it the next day as leftovers.

I am giving this recipe a 5star rating because it has the best base for a veg chili that I have made.  Like many reviewers I left out the oregano and basil.  I added 3 tbsp chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin and 2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Wonderful.  I will make again and again.  Thanks!

Great flavor I did make some changes, I added 1 lb of browned ground beef, 1 cup broth I used chicken because I had it on hand but beef broth would work too. I changed the spices also I used lots of chili powder, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 1/2 tsp cumin and about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Gave it a very nice sweet/ spicy flavor.

This was the best chili I've ever had.  I made some modifications to the original recipe.  I changed up the beans added to this and used some northern beans, pinto beans, and black beans. I left out garbonzo beans and kidney beans because they are disliked in my family.  I did add more chili pepper as suggested by another reviewer and it made it just that much better.

I made this recipe for my Super Bowl party, and it was a huge hit!  Based on previous posts, I did make a few modifications.  First, I made the chili the day before, cooking it in the crock pot for four hours.  I then let it cool and refrigerated it overnight.  The day of my party, I turned on the crock two hours before guests were scheduled to arrive.  

To make the chili, I followed the recipe with the following modifications:  While I did use black bean soup ("Amy's" organic brand), I also added an extra can of regular black beans, a can of chili beans, and an extra can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  Finally, I added a kick by using an extra onion, a double dose of chili powder, and a few dashes of tobasco.  

For the party, I arranged the chili on a "make-your-own" bar that included cornbread, oyster crackers, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream, and jalapeno peppers.  It was an overwhelming hit and held up well in the crock pot for eight hours (12 hours if you count the four hours from the prior day)!

This recipe was really good, but I definitely had to tweak it. I doubled the recipe, after reading that it freezes well.  After following the recipe verbatim, I found it a little sweet and "herby."  I added another can of tomatoes, two fresh chopped tomatoes (I love tomatoes obviously).  I then added cumin, pepper, a little more garlic, a little salt and more chili powder.  I chopped up two Morningstar Farms black bean burgers for a little more "oomph." I also added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to combat the sweetness.  Overall, this was a really good recipe. Like most, you have to make it your own. I have served it in various ways: Over rice, with cornbread on the side, in pitas with black bean burgers, and even as a chili "burger," again using the black bean patties. I will definitely make it again.

Great healthy and hearty chili that could not be any easier to make. I added 1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  You could go with more cayenne but I held back because my children. I cooked for 6 hours on low. Condensed black bean soup impossible to find but I was able to find a 15 oz can of regular black bean soup and it works out fine.

Wow, was this delish on the 2nd day!  The first night we had it with rice and it was judged "good".  As leftovers the next day, with some shredded cheddar melted on top, it was out-of-this-world!!!  A terrific vegetarian meal, with some rice or crusty bread, and a salad.  Definitely a keeper.

Pretty good, great veggies.  I left out the celery because my brother doesn't like it and used those cornbread-bread crackers to scoop it with...yummy!

This is a good, basic vegetarian chili. I was not able to find the soup listed, so I have used lentil soup one time, and regular black bean soup another time, both with good results. You might want to add a little heat with a jalapeno; I add about half a small can to mine for ease of prep. Also, a little tomato paste helps.

Loved it. Along with recommended vegetables I used a can of black bean soup and drained some liquid, half a can of baked beans with brown sugar, 1 can diced tomato with green chiles and 1 without. I omitted the celery and italian seasonings and added 1 tablespoon chili powder and 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper. I cooked on low for 6 hours and ended up adding tomato paste to thicken. Delicious. Served with whole grain chips and cheese. Yum!

this is really easy to make and what I consider comfort food. I had to include some meat for my husband so I browned a pound of ground turkey. Also I didn't have the dried herbs so I substituted them with Italian seasoning and also added some cumin like someone suggested for the smoky flavor. I think next time I would add some spinach to sneak in more vegetables.

I've made this a few times now, and I keep changing it up. I like to use cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles to give it a bit of a kick, along with the 3 tbsp of Chili powder, 3 Tbsp of Cumin, and 2 tsp of Cayenne.
Amy's makes a great Black Bean Soup that I like to use, and I compensate for the lack of liquid in the smaller can with extra tomatoes. 
Anyway I make it - always delicious!

So not good.  The spices are just off.  I think it's the oregano.  Would probably be fine with regular chili seasoning, but that would be a different recipe.

I love this recipe.  I have made it 4 times in the last two months.  I use 2 cans of black beans instead of the black bean soup (which is hard to find).  I don't always have green pepper, so I add extra celery.  Based on other reviews, I eliminate the Italian seasonings.  I use 2 tablespoons of chili powder.    The recipe is forgiving.  Use it as a base and modify based on what you have and what you like.  It freezes very well.  I cook it at 2 hours on high, and then turn it on low until I am ready to eat.

Made this on Saturday so I could start bringing my own lunch to work.  A resounding success!  Like other reviewers, I nixed black bean soup in favor of a plain can of beans.  Added 2 diced jalapenos for extra heat and used one of the other reviewers' spice notes for adding chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, and salt instead of the listed Italian seasonings.  I omitted the celery.  Next time I think I'll add more fresh peppers.

Absolutely phenomenal!  This was my first time using a slow cooker and I'm a vegetarian so I went with this recipe after reading the reviews.  You really can't mess this one up, it's delicious.  I did add 'soy meat' crumbles which add a little something extra and left the my cooker on low all day while at work.  Thanks again for this wonderful recipe!

This was fabulous. My husband loved it.the only additions I made were a can of "fire roasted tomatoes", and at the very end just before serving a 1 pound package of vegetarian soy "beef" crumbles. Great!!

This is a great recipe! My sister-in-law is a vegetarian amist a family of pure carnavores so it's tough finding good vegetarian dishes. This is so easy to make with the slow cooker and tastes so good that the whole family eats from it too! I don't add canned soup or the vegetarian baked beans, but I do add black beans and sometimes white cannalleni beans. All the colors in the dish are astetically appetizing. Be careful with the oregano;maybe put 1/2 Tbp. I felt it was a little overpowering. Otherwise, great recipe. Thanks

I'm not a vegetarian but I love this chili. You'll be surprised by the flavor - I recommend adding a bit of hotsauce. This is super easy to make, inexpensive and it freezes well. Add some sourcream, cheese, and tortilla chips to the top for a great meal.

I made this recipe exactly as written- including the baked beans. I must say, the first day I thought it was terrible and almost threw it out, but my fiance convinced me otherwise (he apparently liked it).  I'm really glad he did, b/c for some reason, this dish was soooo much better the following day!  We had it for dinner the following 2 nights as bean and cheese burritos w/ sour cream and salsa.  They really tasted like gourmet bean burritos!  Crazy, huh?  But, it definitely got 4 stars for that!

This would have been good if the baked beans had been left out.  They gave the chili a sweet flavor, which didn't fit.  I would make it again without those, though, and I suspect it would be great.

This is a **really good** chile recipe, and easy to make.  The recipe is great as-is, though I do add some hot sauce for more zing, and of course more chile powder.  This was equally praised by  vegetarians and meat-eaters -- I served it at a party with a meat-based chili and this one was gone first!

Excellent recipe!  I'm not a very good cook, and my previous chili attempts have failed, but this one worked!  I made some changes to the recipe:
no baked beans, instead, half a pound of ground chuck, and instead of celery, sliced baby carrots.
sauteed the onions, peppers, beef, and carrots before putting it into the slow cooker.  I used Campbell's condensed black bean soup--it's in the traditional red and white can, but with a  "Special Selections" label at the top.
Cooked for about 4+ hours, as recommended by other reviewers

It came out wonderfully, and I highly recommend this chili recipe!  Not very spicy, but flavorful.  I think this chili would be even better with more fresh veggies and corn, and topped with melted cheese.

This was delicious after I made changes as suggested by others and a few of my own.

1. I couldn’t find black bean soup anywhere, so I added a half a can of black beans rinsed.  (I saved half for Vegetarian Quesadillas that I’m trying later in the week!)
2. I used diced tomatoes, since that is what I had at home.  I would probably put a second can in next time.
3. Frozen instead of canned corn.
4. A lot more chili powder than it calls for and a little bit of cumin.
5. I also added 2 jalapeños for a little extra kick and two chili’s in adobo sauce because I had them leftover.  
6. I cooked it on low for 6.5 hours.

This is the recipe I used to "learn" how to make chili. Now I make it a little different, but I'll still give credit to this recipe for getting me started! I use 2 cans black beans & 1 can kidney beans (no garbanzo or baked beans or soup). Rinse your beans well, but keep juices in everything else. Usually 2 cans diced tomatoes (or diced fresh if I have on hand) instead of the 1 can. I add cumin, tapatio, and a small amount of apple cider vinegar. Slow cooker on low for about 5-6 hours and serve with cornbread!

Outstanding and easy to make on the stove top, too.  I served with grated cheese and chopped cilantro. It was delicious.  Did not have chopped tomatoes in puree so used 1 can crushed tomatoes.  Also added more garlic and some cumin.  Will definitely make again!

Tolerable, but much to tomato-y. The soup "juice" was almost like a watery marinara.

I've never rated anything. This chili was excellent. First time I ever made it and was really concerned about how it would come out. Everyone, including kids aged 3 to 13 loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. I did tweak it a tiny bit. Used about 2/3 Tbspn of chili powder for kids who are not into hot spices and I added about one tspn cumin as suggested by others. Will definitely make again.

AMAZING!!! I've made this 5 times already, I usually double (or even triple) the recipe and can't keep it around longer than 1 night in a house of 5!! I have made it different each time and the best way i've tried is cutting out the italian herbs adding fresh AND canned tomatoes, jalapenos, cayenne pepper, a tiny pinch of cumin, and using red orange and yellow bell peppers instead of the green. Best served with lots of cheese and sour cream on top!! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great chili!  Husband said it was one of his favorites ever and he did not miss the meat!  Changes I made based on reviews are: 2-3 TBSP chili powder, 2 TBSP cumin, 1 TSP cayenne, 1 TSP salt, black pepper to taste, 1 diced jalapeno pepper and 1 small can of tomato paste in addition to the 14.5 oz diced tomatoes. I cooked it for 4-5 hours in the slow cooker. This is one that I will make again and again! Thanks!

I change some things around... the can of diced tomato's i used also had jalepeno peppers in it, I also added a package of dried chili seasoning, and i cut up a habenero pepper for an extra heat factor.  I served it with jalepeno chips, and sour cream that was spiced with chili powder and a little of the chili seasoning mix.  I also used a can of creamed corn instead of whole corn kernels.  I thought it was sweet, spicey, and all around delicious... I will make this again, and agian...  maybe with some corn bread as a side.  yumm!

Excellent - it's more of a stew than a chili, really, but a hearty meal on a dark winter day.  We added more chili powder for a better zing.

You'll never miss the meat with this recipe.  Easy as can be, put it in the slow cooker for 7 hours on low and it turned out great.  Topped it with sour cream and cheddar cheese, with a side of corn bread.  Thought I'd died and went to heaven!

My husband and I liked this chili, but I'm still looking for a recipe we like better.  It was good, but I prefer a chili to have more of a tomato base.  If I try this recipe again, I will add a can or two of tomato paste.  I used Bush's hot 'n spicy chili beans instead of plain kidney beans, and for the canned tomatoes I used chopped tomatoes with jalapenos.  I used Progresso's black bean soup, ready-to-serve, not condensed. I only added half the baked beans, as other reviews said it tasted too much like baked beans, and it came out good.  I used lots of garlic powder, rather than fresh, and added extra chili powder, as we like our chili very spicy.  I served it with with shredded cheddar and sour cream on top.  Very filling, high in fiber, and low in fat.  It was very fast and easy to throw together, and makes a LOT of chili.  I did have it in my crock pot for about 4 hours on high, but my crock pot is old, so maybe 2 hours is enough in a newer pot.

This was just OK to me. It was too sweet for my tastes and I like sweet stuff. I was able to find Black Bean Soup at Trader Joes for everyone who was having a problem finding it.  I probably would not make this again.

sellitman, ain’t buying it as chili! An okay, but not spectacular, bean casserole. If compared only to other vegetarian dishes, it would be a 5 star. For those liking this type dish, try “Five Bean Casserole” from this site, and omit the bacon if a strict vegan. Plan on a longer cooking time than 2 hrs. If making for first time, read some of the 5 star reviews as so many of them ‘tweak’ this recipe (got a chuckle reading some of these tweaks as it morphs into a new recipe). . . and the low star ratings seem not to tweak it. I agree with so many others that this is a good starting point for creating something else.

Made it as written and with suggested changes (no parsley, oregano, or basil, and extra tomatoes and soy ground beef). I liked this chili as written but loved it without the Italian spices. I don't think the extra tomatoes made much difference to us, except that I guess it keeps it soupy if you're adding the soy grounds since they can be dry. Thanks!

I started with 1/2 C each of dry black, navy, kidney and garbanzo beans.  Did a quick soak and then cooked in fresh water with an onion, 3 small cloves chopped garlic and some fresh chopped parsley.  The black and navy beans cooked in 1/2 hour, kidney in about 45 minutes and took and hour for the garbanzo.  Next time I'll know in what order to cook the beans and add the faster cooking ones later.  After cooking beans on the stove top I drained, reserving some of the liquid and added them with all the other ingredients to a crock pot to cook on high (used 1 yellow and 1 green pepper).  Had to add additional salt because I cooked my own beans, and put some cumin in too.

Delish! I made this for my vegetarian friend's birthday and it was a hit with both meat and non-meat eaters! I did sub chili beans for garbanzos since that what I had on hand and altered the herbs more to taste.I let this cook on high for a little over 2 hours and it was perfect! Thanks!

Don't you dare try to eat this before its flavors simmer. I used regular can of black beans (whole thing. Didn't even drain) added a can of condensed tomato soup for moisture and threw in some fresh tomato. Better the second day. Even better the third! Great w/ cornbread and cheese on top.

Couldn't find black bean soup so I used a can of black beans in seasoned sauce (more like seasoned water). Everything turned out well even the two Tbs. of chili powder and I don't like chili powder. I served this with a pan of cornbread on the side.

This is the BEST Vegetatian Chile ever! Although I do not like to change recipes the first time, I had to in this case since I had to rely on what I had at hand. Here are my changes: I used a can of white beans instead of the baked beans- I thought this would be O.K. given some other comments who found the recipe a bit too sweet. I added the recommended 1T. cummin powder, 2t.of cayenne pepper, 1t. dry basil but I replaced the dry oregano and cilantro for their fresh versions since I had Italian parsley at hand and I grow oregano in my garden. I did not want it too dry, so I followed the recommendation of another reader and added one can (14.5oz)of low fat chicken broth (I did not have vegetable broth and since I am not vegetarian, it was O.K.). The only thing I added on my own was a small can of Mexican Tomato sauce (hot - El Pato) and although I thought that this would ruin the recipe making it too hot, my hubby and my nephew just loved it!  I place at the table: diced onions, diced tomatoes, diced avocados, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream so everybody coulc add the garnishes to their liking. The pot was huge,we had it for dinner with a green salad, and today I could not freeze it because the two men in my house wanted to have the same dinner again!  What a hit!  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Almost perfect!  I added 6 dried chilis, 3 tablespoons of maple syrup, 2 teaspoons of cumin, and a little salt to my taste as my family prefers very spicy chili.  I'm a strict vegetarian (vegan), and this recipe is a staple in my home.  It's my (omnivore) husband's favorite dish!  It's perfect topped with vegan parmesan and served with hot vegan corn bread.  I'll continue to make this again and again.

This recipe is GREAT! I make it almost every other week to take to work. I add a lot of hot sauce (for a kick it is lacking otherwise) and the last time i added one packet of the soy "Smart" BBQ pulled pork (fake pork, though very tasty!) to give it more of a chili feel. I've also tried adding the Smart Ground (soy ground beef) added to this. As an ex-meat eater who still appreciates the flavor, it adds that which I normally feel is lacking in vegetarian chili. Plus this recipe is AMAZINGLY easy to make. It takes next to no time and can serve as lunch all week! Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. Used Amy's mild black bean chili as the "black bean soup", and substituted a can of pinto beans for the baked beans.  Doubled the spices, added cumin (this was key!), and added half a jalepeno for some heat.  I don't have a slow cooker - just did it on low on the stove for 3 hours. Very hearty.  Delicious served with cornbread.

Contrary to some reviewers I thought the baked beans added a nice sweetness.  I served this over egg noodles with sour cream and shredded cheese and it was almost like a stroganoff. I also had trouble finding black bean soup, but the brand Nile Spice does make a single serving dried soup in a cup to which you add boiling water.  I used this and half a can of black beans.

I don't know if it was the basil or oregano or both but all I could taste was herb and it turned the veggies bitter.  Sorry but I found it inedible.

This is an excellent recipe. I was worried about the amount of spices but the seasonings were perfect!  I used black beans unstead of soup just rinced and drained them like the rest. Did not use the green pepper because I do not like it.  I made a mistake of opening creamed corn instead of whole Kernel corn, just tossed it in the crock pot and still worked out okay.  I will make this again!  Fast, Easy and wonderful!

I'm giving this 5 stars because anything that pleases husband, adventurous 21-year-old, and picky 18-year-old (and me, of course!) deserves a great rating!  I was a little worried about the baked beans and canned corn making the chili too sweet, but it was excellent.  I added 2 cans total of tomatoes and some chipotle powder which I thought would complement the sweetness of the beans.  This disappeared in no time and I didn't even get to have any leftovers!  Definitely a keeper - thanks a lot, Kevin.

My husband and I LOVE this!!  He's the type who likes to have meat at every meal, but this chili is hearty enough on its own.  I love tomatoes, so I add a large can of tomato sauce to the mix.  Gives it enough liquid without watering it down.

This recipe is awesome. I made a few changes, I don't like garbanzo beans so I replaced with pinto and I used black beans instead of black bean soup.  I serve it over white rice with corn bread.  I just love it and everyone else that tries it loves it too! GREAT!

This recipe turned out wonderful.  I've been looking for a healthy and filling
meal that tasted great and this is it.  The only thing I changed was not using the 
italian herbs because I didn't have them on hand.  I used 1 tblsp. cumin along 
with the chili powder instead.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

This was excellent-it held up well to 10 hours cooking on low.  We could not find condensed black bean soup, so we used uncle ben's black bean and rice soup (added spices as well) and added a cup of water.  I will definately make this again and again.  It was also very economical, just $6 for everything including the chili powder which I will use again.

Like other reviewers, I thought it smelled wonderful while cooking.   It just was rather bland and too sweet.  I would have left out the baked beans, added more chili pepper, a bit of salt, and perhaps cayenne to give it spice.  I would not call this chili, instead I would call it a bean stew.

Let me start by saying this does need more seasoning than the recipe indicates. However, It is really good! It's very fresh tasting and lighter than most chili recipes. I love that you don't feel gross after eating it  - you can actually taste the beans and corn. I followed the recipe, but also added more chili powder, lots of salt and pepper, a bit of cayenne and hot sauce for heat and I cooked it for 4 hours. I also added fresh parsley on top - YUM!

Awesome basic recipe as it is!  It is very forgiving and can easily be tweaked to your liking.  Instead of adding the dried herb ingredients I added the chilli mix recipes on this site.  Even the carnivores in the family cleaned up their plates.  Thanks for a sharing your delicious recipe!

This chili was wonderful. This was my first time making a chili without meat and I was a bit apprehensive about the ingredients, the garbanzo beans in particular. I made this recipe as written yet within my own bowl I did add a touch of Chinese Chili Paste for the extra kick. My husband thought it was great and we both found it to be very satisfying and filling. It looks pretty in the bowl too :)

I'm new to cooking and decided to try this because of its simplicity.  It came out great!  Definately better flavor the next day.  I did not deviate from the recipe too much. I used frozen corn and black beans like some others mentioned.  I didn't have parsley so I substituted a cajun seasoning which had a parsley component to it.  Served with shredded cheddar and sour cream on top.

Just AWESOME! I made some changes based on what i had on hand. I used 2 cans of black beans. I pureed one of them with a little veg broth.(could not find black bean soup) I used great northern instead of garbonzo. I used the bigger can of baked beans. Skipped the parsley, oregano, and basil. Added more chili powder and added cumin. Perfect! Cooked several hours longer. WAY better the next day! WOW!

Although I haven't tried any other veggie chilis for my slow cooker, this recipe is a keeper! I substitute red sweet peppers for green bell peppers, and use cayenne pepper, extra oregano, fresh onion, minced garlic, and cumin powder instead of regular chili powder. I've also made the chili thicker and heartier by adding tomato paste and creamed corn, while cooking on a low setting in the crock pot for 12 hours.

An absolute hit.  Although, I did deviate substantially from the posted recipe.  As advised in many other reviews, I eliminated the italian seasonings and used Chili Powder, Cayenne Pepper and Cumin instead.  I used two cans of black beans rather than black bean soup and added an extra can of tomatoes as well as a can of tomato puree.  It was absolutely delicious.  One of my guests said he didn't usually like chili, and another said he liked chili only with meat, but they couldn't eat enough.  Yummy!

Thanks for submitting this recipe. It turned out really good. The baked beans add a sweet flavor that goes well with the hotness of chili. I added a small can of green chilies and some hot pepper flakes which gave it some extra zip.

A great hearty meatless dish! I also didn't have much luck finding black bean soup at my local market, so I substituted a can of black beans (rinsed & drained) instead, and added a little less chili powder. My very picky 9 yr old ate two bowls of this, it's a keeper! Thanks!

Tasty when made directly from the recipe, however, chop the celery small or it will not be cooked in two hours.

Excellent base recipe. I added boca ground "beef", green onion, and hot red pepper to give it the spice i liked and served it over a cheese rice.  Tasty and easy/fun to make.  Tweak to your specific tastes - a very flexible recipe.

Exceptional!  Decided to try being vegetarian for a month and turns out we had a chili fest at church on October 1st -- so tried this recipe and it was a hit!  We overheard many members of the congregation commenting on how delicious it was! Glad to have one great recipe to start our vegetarian challenge!

I also could not find black bean soup, so substituted with regular black beans and half a can of water.  Adding the water was a mistake!  Tastes fine.  Is a bit sweet.  Will try it again when I find the black bean soup.

I made this chili for a group of friends this weekend.  This chili is excellent as is, however my grocery store did not have black bean soup so I used canned black beans and doubled the chopped tomatoes.  Half the group was not vegetarian so I decided to do a "layered" approach.  Along side the chili I offerred chili-style ground beef so that it could easily be added to the chili.  It was a huge hit and everyone seemed happy.  I'll definitely make this meal again.

I really liked this chili, I made it exactly to order except I couldn't find the progresso soup so I got a can of S and W black beans, latin style (threw away the label already, sorry) 

I would have given this a 5 start, but I really thought it was more like a soup than a chili.  

The flavor was a bit sweet and smokey, and I really liked that.  It is also a very healthy meal, which I really liked.

I have only recently discovered the wonder that is the Crock Pot, so I was looking for something healthy, tasty, and free of red meat.  This exceeded my expectations!  It tasted great and was filling too; an excellent dish for these cold New England winters.  I put it on low around 11:30, and by 6:00 I was eating a fabulous meal.  I did add a splash of lemon juice, but that was my only change.  Thanks for this great recipe!!

Excellent!  Didn't have garbanzos, so used "chili beans", added cumin and hot pepper sauce until it was not too hot since the slow cooker enhances the spices.  Also added a touch of cinnamon, just a little, than enhances the flavor of everything.  Makes a lot but made great burritos too so it's easy to eat all of it!

This was pretty good.  I did follow the recommendations of Katzen below and found them to be very benefical. However, in addition I added some fresh cilantro. But for a good, low fat, high fiber, recipe...you can't go wrong.  It was in the crock for 6 hours.

I ommited the garbanzo beans and added red and yellow peppers.  I make it at the start of the week and dish it into individual servings for weekly lunches.  It freezes well.

I added cilantro, hot sauce, and lots more chili powder. I served it over rice and topped it with hot pepper monterey jack cheese. Very filling and VERY GOOD. You have to add more spices than the recipe calls for to bring out the flavor.

Wonderful!!  I added a can of diced tomatoes, left out the green pepper, and threw in a generous helping of Tastefully Simple's Wahoo! Chili for some added kick.  This chili is great - my whole family loved it.

Not half bad - great to put in the freezer for emergency lunch, and substitutions are really easy.  I'd suggest a bit of cillantro and hot sauce, though...

Wow -- my 2-year-old had two helpings, as did my finicky husband.  What a great, easy meal.  I couldn't find condensed black bean soup at my supermarket, so I used regular black bean soup and a 6 oz. can of tomato paste for thickness.  I also added 1 tsp. of ground cumin for a more chili-like (and less baked-bean-like) flavor.

This chili tasted pretty good, not to mention that it was super easy to make. (My co-workers raved about it!) I made the recipe exactly as written and, as some reviewers stated, it appeared to be thick and dry. However, after it was cooked, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it became juicy! (Note: This recipe calls for one 19-ounce can of black bean soup; it does not mention the word "condensed". If some of the reviewers used condensed soup, that would explain for the lack of juiciness in their final product.) One more thing ... I cooked the chili on high for 4 hours, then another 4 hours on low (2 hours would not have been long enough to cook the onions & celery, plus meld the flavors, in my opinion.)

This is a good solid vegetarian chili, and very adaptable to your tastes. For those having trouble finding the black bean soup, Goya makes it. I found it in the local discount supermarket (I live in an urban area though, with a big Hispanic community). I know that I like my chili with a bit of kick, so I added some Cayenne and a half of a chipotle chili in adobo sauce, finely chopped... almost to a paste. I used red pepper instead of green pepper, and I used less celery. After 2 hours on high, it was not cooked enough. The veggies, even though I chopped them small, were not cooked through, but the chili was edible. Chili shouldn't be crunchy. I put it on low for another 4 hours or so, and it turned out great! It's very hearty and filling, even sans meat!
Enjoy!

Made a few tweaks to the seasoning to taste. Other than that, a really great recipe that is flexible to your tastes. 
The first time I made this, it was for a chili cook-off between a (vegetarian) friend of mine. The judges (our friends) chose my chili as the winner! The consensus: It's so hearty you wouldn't know that there isn't any meat in it! 
Love this recipe. Have used it many times.

This Vegetarian Chili is amazing! It came out perfect with little to no effort. I wasn't able to find Progresso Black Bean Soup, so I just used a can of Black Beans. I also omitted the celery. It was delicious. I also topped tortilla chips with this chili with cheese and sour cream, made great nachos too. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Love this recipe! I made it for myself and I freeze it because my BF won't eat beans so I get them all at once. Changes include: Just used a can of black beans. Used Ranch Style Jalapeno baked beans and then added a can of tomato soup and a can of water plus some Tabasco sauce to spice it up a bit more.

Awesome... even if you're not a vegetarian.  I was looking for a nutritious and quick meal for my family and have tried this several times. It is fantastic!  My husband wanted me to add groundmeat to it to make it more traditional.  I added ground soy and he was never the wiser.  He loves it and my family asks for it all the time.

Outstanding!!! Thank you for sharing. Everyone who tries this chili asks me for the recipe :)  I like to add 1/2 cup of brown sugar to add some sweetness and it is delicious.

Delicious! Forgot the corn: not heartbroken. I don't like tomatoes as a general rule so I used only puree. Instead of black bean soup I used a can of black beans with the juice and added another half cup of water. The vegetable and seasoning proportions worked well. I stopped eating meat eight months ago and sometimes I really miss it. This satisfies.

I loved this, my husband thought it was just okay.  He thought it needed more flavor.  I couldn't find black bean soup, so like other reviewers I just used two cans of black beans.  I have a feeling the extra flavor that must be in the soup is what is needed.  Also like other reviewers, I didn't use the Italian seasonings but added cumin and cayenne pepper.  It was almost a little too spicy for me, so I'll cut down next time, or just try it with the Italian seasonings.  Two hours was definitely not enough cooking time - the onions and peppers were still too crunchy.  I think I ended up cooking mine about six hours.  I thought it was really tasty and filling, and had some for lunch today and it was even better.  Will make this again.  Just need to find that soup!

Full of flavor, loved it! I think it tasted much better the next day rather than right after it finished cooking.  Will be making again.

This recipe turned out great!  I didn't have any garlic on hand so I used garlic powder but it was still great.  Served with a little sour cream.  Yum!

Yummy and easy.  I didn't use the italian seasonings but stuck with Mex. ones.  Used salsa instead of tomato.  Cook longer for better mix of flavors.

Wow!  We really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband went on and on about it.  Made it just like it says.  We might like to add some spice next time.  Seems more like chili than soup, but what ever it is we like it.

I've made this several times using the suggestions submitted by others but definitely prefer the orignal version.  Twice I found I had no baked beans but used a 16 ounce can of white kidney beans.  Just as good. Thank you, sellitman, for sharing your Grandma's recipe.

I am honestly amazed at how good this is!  We are not vegetarians, we actually love meat but are trying to eat a little healthier.  I made this chili and was prepared to be dissappointed.  My husband is also very picky and a big meat eater, so I was sure he would not like it.  Well, we both really liked it & will definately be making it again!    I used a can of black beans in seasoned sauce and added a can of tomato sauce because my tomatoes weren't in puree.  I also added about 1/2 T Cumin.   It was so easy & delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is now one of our favorite crockpot meals, and I make it every couple weeks! I use crushed tomatoes instead of chopped, as my husband and I both preferred the smoother texture of the chili when I made it that way. I often don't have the black bean soup on hand but just replace it with black beans and it still comes out good. I cook it on high for at least 3 hours. We eat this with a crusty loaf of wheat bread and it's so delicious! Great for freezing. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for the seasoning in this recipe. I could not even eat it. Follow other reviewers' advice and omit the Italian seasoning. I normally love recipes like this.

Absolutely delicious! I prefer this to a meat-laden chili version because the calories are much more acceptable.  As some others have said, it's a bit on the sweet side because of the baked beans. I balanced this out after it was done cooking (8 hours on low) by adding some sliced jalapenos and tabasco sauce, which balanced the sweetness just beautifully.   The leftovers are even more delicious when warmed up the next day.

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. If you don't have something, just leave it out. If you want to get rid of a random canned vegetable, throw it in. Great for stretching a buck and cleaning out the pantry.

So good! I used refried black beans with jalepenos in place of the soup, a 26 ounce can of diced tomatoes in juice instead of crushed tomatoes/puree, and only seasoned it with garlic, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. I had it on low for about 8 hours and it was DELICIOUS!

I loved this. This is the first vegetarian chilli I really liked. I was not able to find the black bean soup so I took a can of black beans, rinsed, drained and added a cup of veggie broth and put it in the blender before adding to the slow cooker. I will make this a lot.

I have been making this for years.  It has been passed off with no questions of being vegetarian many times. I have made it on the stove top also just cooking until beans are cooked and it is warm throughout Over the years I have added chopped carrots, cumin and cayenne to suite my taste.  However the origional is great too.  It is always a hit and can be modified easily depending on what you have in you pantry!!!

I just made this tonight and it was delicious.  I used black beans instead of the black bean soup (since I couldn't find any).  I put it in the slow cooker for 2 hours like the recipe said, but the onions and peppers were still crunchy so I'm letting the rest of it cook for a few more hours so that the leftovers will be softer. Otherwise it was great.  My husband is a picky eater, especially in regard to beef and chicken, so he loved the beans and the fact that it was vegetarian.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe.  I used undrained black beans instead of black bean soup and left out the celery and added much more garlic.  It had a nice mild spiciness but lots of flavor.

Made a few adjustments, based on what I had on hand. I used a can of black beans, drained and rinsed, instead of black bean soup. I omitted the can of baked beans. I added about half a cup of raw baby carrots, as well as vegetable broth, about a cup. I had this in the slow cooker on high for over four hours. Delicious!

I am a busy mum and have very little time to cook. We are started being vegetarian since my husband found out he had high blood pressure. I really liked this recipe. I used a crock-pot liner, so there was little clean up. I added 3 chopped veggie burgers (because I had them leftover from another meal). I am sure it would have been great without them. I plan to make it again.

Well, I was going to give it a three star rating.  But gave it a four star since I didn't stick to the recipe.  I used several different types of dried beans instead of all the canned types called for in this recipe.  I found it to be extremely bland.  I had to add so many spices and flavors to get my husband to eat a second bowl of it.  I guess next time I'll stick to the recipe and see how that turns out.

I've made many many different recipes of veg. chilis trying to find the one I like. Out of all them, this one is the best! My husband and I really enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again! I skipped tha baked beans and put 1 tbsp of cumin and 2 tbsp of chili powder instead of 1tbsp as the recipe calls. Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe (finally!).

Generally a very good recipe, just not as spicy as I like it.  I added more chili powder, some cayenne & crushed red pepper flakes to up the heat.  I also substituted "veggie crumbles" for the chick peas to please others who prefer a more "meaty" chili.  Everyone was pleased with the dish!

I really liked this chili the first few times I made it, but now...I think maybe the sweetness is turning me off of it. Next time, I will substitute red kidney beans for the veggie baked beans. I think the baked beans make it a little too sweet. This is good with cornbread.

this was not my family's favorite.  My kids would not eat it.  If you are not a fan of baked beans, this is a bad choice.

Very flavourful, and makes a ton.  So much canned beans I was wondering if it'd cook into a 'mush.'  I also forgot about time, and it cooked on high for four hours: Beans didn't fall apart.  Garbonzos add a very nice texture.  Used canned black beans instead of soup.  I didn't have basil or parsley, and used a bag of frozen corn which held its crunch.  Next time I'll add more celery & bell pepper, because they cooked-down a great deal; disappeared.  Glad I tried this recipe!

I thought this receipe was wonderful!  It's extremely easy to adapt to any taste bud.  I like my chilli a little spicer than most.  I used spicy chilli beans instead of garbanzo's.  I also added red pepper and Jalepeno's.  A great easy dish!!

VEGETARIAN'S:  Thankfully, most of us read labels.  The Progresso Black Bean Soup uses bacon for flavoring.  I used the Goya Black Bean Soup which you can usually find in the mexican section of your supermarket.

Wonderful, no matter how I fiddle with this recipe it always comes out great! I never can find black bean soup, so I have tried many different types, Bean w/ Bacon works well. I like to also use this when ever I have left over chicken breasts or steaks to chop up and toss in. Great recipe for the cold winter nights!

Even my meat-lover husband enjoys this!  It is so flavorful and great for something easy AND different.  I serve it over rice (brown or white, either way), and everyone has seconds.

This is a very good basic vegetarian chili. I had to do some substituting because I didn't have everything in my pantry. I used salsa instead of tomatoes, black beans instead of soup and mixed beans instead of kidney. I did miss the kidney beans, but otherwise it was a winner. The salsa gave it a nice kick--a bit too much for 1 of the family, but that is not the fault of the recipe. I liked the nice crunch the veggies still had, but think 3 hours would not have hurt it at all and perhaps on low for several hours would work too. Great slow cooker recipe and very weight watcher friendly. Thanks!

My husband is a Chef and loved it! I'm still loving it a few days later! I too couldn't find condensed black bean soup and just used Progresso's Black Bean Soup. I added a tad more Chili powder but all in all I stuck with the recipe. I , as most reviewer's did ,cooked longer than the two hours. It really needs too for the flavor to really absorb. This was easy and a huge hit.

This is a very good recipe although it didn't really taste like chili so I give it 4 stars.  My husband really enjoyed this and said it was a 5 star recipe when he added hot sauce to it.  I cooked mine on low for 8 hours, and topped each serving with a small portion of mozarella.  Very Good!

Very good!  My husband loved it.  I used kidney beans, vegetarian baked beans, black beans (and liquid), and small white beans.  Left out the celery. Cooked it covered on top of the stove about an hour, stirring occasionally.  Thought it looked very pretty, as opposed to another reader!  Will make this again.

Great, easy recipe.  Throw it together and wait (I cooked it on low for 6 hrs).  

I adjusted the veggies: (used 2 onions, 2 red peppers, 3 celery stalks, 4 cloves garlic, left out the green pepper and the corn); and the spices (added 4 chipotle peppers in adobo, kicked up the chili powder to 4T, and added 1T cumin, and 1-1/2t salt...yes, it was spicy!).  

I'll definitely make this again...perfect for a snowy Saturday.

I'm not a vegetarian, but decided to make this for my vegetarian fiance, and we both loved it.  I used canned black beans instead of black bean soup (couldn't find it) and great northern beans instead of garbanzo beans (which I hate).  I don't think it mattered since it just tastes like chili... :-)

Wonderful recipe!  I made it Saturday night for friends and my fiance and I are still eating it for leftovers.  I added more kidney beans and more tomatoes (not in puree) and added 2 small cans of puree to thicken it up.  I also added 2 (1 oz) packages of chili seasoning to spice it up a little.  Good for WW, as mentioned before.  My fiance does like meat so I separated the chili when it was almost done and added meat to one half.  Will make again!!

This recipe was excellent!! what a good way to get the protien and fiber us vegetarians need. I bought a chili starter mix in a can at the store and it was aweful and I really wanted a good recipe and this is it! Very flavorful.  I added a little extra chili powder because I like really spicy chili and it tasted a little sweet but probably because of the sweet corn I used.  Amazing recipe:0)

Couple of things: good recipe overall.  Took 4 hours on HIGH in my slow cooker, not two hours.  Probably all slow cookers vary cooking times.

I used frozen corn instead of canned corn to cut down on salt.

I added 28 ozs of crushed San Marzano tomatoes.

At the suggestion of a reviewer, I swapped the oregano for 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of ground coriander seed.  My wife really liked the taste of that spice mix and she is fussy.

We really liked the flavor.  Ate some, froze some.

I combined the original recipe with some of the reviews and it turned out to be delicious! This is what I used: pinto beans instead of vegetarian baked beans, 1 big can of diced tomatoes instead of a small one, 2 onions instead of 1, 1 green, 1 yellow, and 1 red pepper instead of just one green pepper, 2 tablespoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin, half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper, salt, and black pepper. I dropped the parsley, oregano, and basil and cooked on high for 4 hours.

First try at crockpot chili and this one is very good. I made a couple of modifications. Used chopped tomatoes with jalapenos and added a can of chipotles in adobo for some heat. Added a couple of carrots for some sweetness too. It turned out to be VERY hot (which is fine with me). The adobo made it a bit too smoky though. The next day I browned up a pound of ground turkey and combine that with half of the original batch of chili and put it back in the crockpot for a couple dollars. It turned out great! Not vegetarian chili anymore, but awesome!! I will definitely try this one again and experiment with different ways to add heat. The other thing that I liked about this recipe was that it fit perfectly in my 5 quart crockpot. Too many other recipes are sized for a bigger pot.

Made it for a group of friends for lunch today (freezing cold day here), it was delicious. Since I couldn't find black bean soup I pureed a can of drained black beans in my blender with 1/3 cup salsa and a bit of lemon juice, that worked fine. The vegetables stayed a little crunchy after 4 hours in the slow cooker, which made a delicious contrast to the soft beans. The spice was just right, I had been worried it might be too much.

Excellent recipe! Was the hit of a 45 person pot luck. Worthy of note for those who use the shopping list function: After saving recipe to shopping list and editing for foods already in pantry, I noticed vegetarian baked beans on recipe were transferred to shopping list as baked beans (thus adding the pork component back into a truly vegetarian dish). Further, as my son helped in the kitchen he did not realize any of the "drained" notations and, instead, dumped all beans in undrained. Figured it was still edible so we went with it. Lastly, as I found I was missing the chili powder I thought I had in the pantry, I substituted one teaspoon each of the following: Chipotle chile pepper; ancho chile pepper; and cayenne pepper. Made a second pot after pot luck and froze it immediately. Been eating this dish as quick lunches for nearly two months now. Still tastes as good as the first batch. Am entering the dish (my original version listed herein) in a chile cookoff this weekend. Will update results in a future post.

I just made this yesterday. It is really good! I like things a little spicier so I added more chili powder and some cumin.  Otherwise I just followed the ingredients as given.  I doubled it and cooked it on low for about 6 hours.

Good base of ingredients, but needs some extra kick.
I skipped the basil and oregano, and used cayenne, cumin, chili powder, and paprika with some Valentina's very hot sauce.  Plus, added a small can of tomato paste, stewed tomatoes, and diced tomatoes with chilis.  Yum!

Easy and delicious! Next time I'll try, as at least one reviewer suggested, to just dump in the bean liquids with the beans.  I used 2 Tbsp chili powder and 4 cans of diced tomatoes. (For those skeptical about oregano in chili, oregano is one of the ingredients in chili powder.)

This was FABULOUS!!!  Had to make a number of substitutions but it still came out terrific.  My whole family loved it.  I served it with whole wheat couscous and a little shredded cheese as a topper.  SOOOOO easy!!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Really good and easy. I add refried beans to thicken it a bit, and omit the Italian spices, instead adding a lot of chili powder and some cumin. I also add a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. Everyone compliments this chili.

I always model my chili after this one, and everyone loves it! Even the big-time meat eaters in my life! You wont be disappointed. I always tailor it a bit to what I have in my kitchen at the time, and pan saute the veggies first so they develop their own bold flavor- but his ratios for the canned goods is not to be tampered with.

We suggest adding jalapeño double the chilli powder, plus chives as a garnish.  Vegan cheese is also a nice touch.

The recipe as written is very bland so I dumped in more spices to taste.  I ended up probably more than doubling the amount of spices called for and added at least a tablespoon of cumin.   I also added chopped carrot and jalapeno.  I would rate this 4-4.5 stars with the added spices considering it tasted fairly good, was budget friendly, and made a lot of food.  Maybe next time I'll try it with lentils for a "meatier" texture with veggie broth to make more liquid, although the carrots did add a little crunch to the mixture.

I like that this recipe is very adaptable.  I don't care for green pepper so substitute red pepper.  Today added a yellow pepper because I was out of corn.  Substituted celery seed for celery (my fridge froze my celery).  Also also reconstituted some dehydrated mushrooms and added them.

I rarely have vegetarian baked beans so just use navy or great northern and add some ketchup, yellow mustard and brown sugar.

If I don't have black bean soup on hand, I just put the drained beans in my bullet blender with a little water and cumin powder, then add to crock pot after blended.

It seems you can play around with whatever vegetables that suit your taste or have on hand.  I've added carrots in the past too.

Garnishes I like, shredded cheddar, chopped red onion and Greek yogurt (or sour cream).

This has always been a hit with everyone I serve it to.

Very very good.  Great flavor.  To find the Black Bean Soup, try the organic section of your store.  I also added one can of black beans, just because I thought iti needed more beans.  All in all delicious as is.

This was good but I would leave out the baked beans next time.  I didn't like the added sweetness.  Otherwise it was good and it makes A LOT!

This is excellent.  I am a fan of bean chili in general and this did not disappoint.  Instead of the 14.5 ounce can chopped tomatoes in puree, I used a 14.5 oz can salsa style tomatoes in puree (which were spicy) and added a 28 oz. can diced tomatoes (not in puree) because I like more tomatoes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I have frozen the leftovers and am using it as enchilada stuffing (they are in the oven).  For years I have made black bean enchiladas from black bean chili so we will see how this works out as an alternative.  I read the negative reviews and am having difficulty understanding them.  By all means, if you like vegetarian bean chili you should try this one.  Very very easy to make too.  I cooked it for 3 hours on high in a large Rival slow cooker.

I really like this chili. I have made it several times. It's simple to prepare and tasty. The baked beans give it a depth of flavor that my kids like. I left out the sweetcorn and it was still plenty in quantity and flavor. My only criticism is I could only find one brand of black bean soup (Progresso). I looked at the ingredients and it is NOT vegetarian. I subbed cooked black beans instead.

Was really good! It was more like a stew(thick). My family (2 kids included) liked it very much. Made some cornbread to go with it. I made no changes to the recipe.

I made this tonight for my roommates (one of which is a vegetarian) and me. We all loved it! I added two cans of black beans (drained and rinsed) instead of the black bean soup and baked beans. I also added a few extra spices- cumin, paprika, ginger, and red pepper. It could have used more spice, so next time I'll use more chili powder--but it was still great! And super easy.

I found this recipe to be too sweet.  I am not a fan of garbanzo beans so I substituted cannelini beans.  I would try it again, but I would swap out the baked beans for navy beans and I would add some diced tomatoes with green chiles to add some more heat.

We're not vegetarian, so anytime I cook a veggie recipe, its under scrutiny.  This chili is so full of beans... you don't miss the meat! Just add the beans you like best.  You can't mess this up!

Loved this recipe! I'm a vegetarian, and made this with my boyfriend who is NOT, and we both loved it! We did make a few substitues based on recomendations below as well as some of our own: instead of black bean soup, used black beans, did not use garbonzo beans (felt that there were already a good mix of beans), tripled the tomato and used the kind that had jalepenos already added to it to spice it up, added a small can of tomato sauce, used chili taco mix instead of the chili powder. This recipe is very easy to alter different taste preferences. Highly recommend to anyone who loves chili!

Excellent!  I couldnt find black bean soup so I just used a can of black beans.  I also used a large can of crushed tomatoes and a regular can of diced tomatoes.  I forgot to add the corn and garlic but it was great anyway.  I sauteed my vegetables in olive oil before adding them and I cooked this on the stove top to hurry it up.  I didnt have dried parsley so I garnished mine with fresh flat leaf parsley and colby/jack cheese.  Thanks for the recipe- we loved it!

Really like this dish on several levels -quick, tasty, nutritious and inexpensive.  (Our cost was $10 - the most expensive ingredient was the McCormick's Chili Seasoning).    We also used creamed corn, tomato paste, and black beans because we couldn't find the soup.    This will be perfect for work lunches.

Vegans AND meat eaters will appriciate this. Hearty, filling and tasty. I used white beans instead of garbanzo and no green pepper(I dont' like green bell pepper) The second time,I used more chili and a dash of cayenne pepper, I like it spicy.I was very surprised at how good this is. Good kept in fridg for leftovers for lunch.

This recipe was a big hit on a cold, rainy day for my coworkers. I was unable to find the black bean soup and opted for a can of black beans and was also unable to find the crushed tomatoes in puree at the store. Instead, I used chopped tomoatoes chili style and tomatoe paste. I also had to add water and some additional seasoning because it seemed too thick for my liking. I served with sour cream and tostitos scoops and everyone REALLY enjoyed it.

This is hands-down the best chili recipe that I have ever come across.  I make this all of the time.  I use black beans instead of black bean soup, and because it is SO THICK, I typically add 2-3 cups of vegetable stock for a little more liquid.  And, if you really want meat, it will taste great in this chili.  This makes a ton, but you will not get tired of eating it!  I make this at least six times a month, which, for me, is a lot!  Always a crowd pleaser, and it's just so easy!  Thank you!!

Oh yum!  I made this on one of my "clean the fridge out" days.  I had a green pepper I was saving for another meal so I added a chopped broccoli crown and purple onion instead.  I also added some chopped fresh tomatoes that were starting to get a bit sad-looking in my fridge.  I swapped a can of veggie chili (premade) for the baked beans.  It already had some vegan protein in it and added great texture.  I also added lots of freshly ground black pepper.  Not a spicy...more like a very hearty veggie soup.  I have mine cooking a bit longer on low heat.  Awesome!

I like it with black beans instead of black bean soup, tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes, and 2 Tbsp of chili powder.  It took 3-4 hours for the veggies to get tender - now I leave it cooking all day.  Awesome, filling recipe!

I added 2 bunches of cilantro.  I've found that it's even better after cooling in the fridge overnight and then reheating.

I really enjoyed this recipe, even though I made many changes to it to suit my taste. I used a can of black beans instead of black bean soup. I also added an extra can of kidney beans instead of the baked beans. I put in 2 onions, a serrano pepper, mushrooms, extra chili powder and subbed cumin and cayenne for the parsley, oregano and basil. So, it really wasn't the same recipe, but the original was a good start. The only problem I had was that I cooked this on the stove (since I made it last night after work) and most of my beans broke. I was careful to stir them gently, but they still broke. Next time I cook this on the stove, I will add the fresh vegetables first and let them soften a little, and then add the beans to heat. This way I don't risk breaking as many. Overall, excellent recipe and I will make this all the time because it was so easy.

I liked the recipe quite a bit, but I had to make a few changes.  It wasn't spicy enough for me so I added 2 more tablespoons of chili powder.  I didn't have any bell peppers available so I omitted those, but it still tasted fine!  Also, the onions didn't seem cooked enough after only 2 hours so after 2 hours, I put the slow cooker on low and let it cook for 6-7 more hours.  It went well with sour cream and cheese of course.

This is great chili, I don't have a slow cooker so cooked it on a low level in the microwave.  I make an enormous batch so we  can enjoy this again and again. I used dried mixed beans that I'd presoaked & cooked(added some vinegar to the water,this makes them less gassy!)

Really all it's cracked up to be!  I made the following modifications at other poster's suggestions: added one small can of tomato paste, used black beans instead of black bean soup (since I couldn't find any in my market), added two jalapenos and two habaneros (for a major kick) and a packet of veggie taco flavored ground "beef."  I cooked everything for two hours, took out a dinner sized portion for me and my hubby and cooked the remainder for another two hours which was even better than our dinner which was great!  This makes a ton - plenty to freeze.  

Usually I am not a fan of sweet stuff (e.g. baked beans) but these added a really lovely touch.

Thought this was pretty bland and did not taste anything like chili to me.  It's not because of the lack of meat.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I make things w/out meat or with ground turkey all the time and am quite used to that.  Despite all the raves, I've noticed many people added things to give it a kick.  Well, it needed one.  I tried to spice it up some but it just never quite made it.  The sad thing is that I really love beans and had high hopes for this one.

This was SOOO good.  I did add some jalepeno and different spices to suit my taste but it was REALLY good and SO filling.  The baked beans give it an interesting taste...sweet but again, REALLY good.  I ate it for dinner every night until the entire batch was gone!YUM!

I haven't been able to find black bean soup and so I just use a can of black beans, which works fine.  This is about the most versatile recipe ever as it lends itself well to substitutions of whatever is available in the kitchen - mine has turned out a little different every time, but always good.

Really good!  And I haven't even tried it yet leftover.

Not what I was expecting - more of a chili flavored soup.  Onions, peppers, and celery were still crispy after 2.5 hrs in the crock pot, which I liked.  Didn't add the baked beans, used diced tomatos, and added a single hanebero pepper to give it a kick.  I will make it again!

Instead of using chili powder, I added a 16 ounce jar of medium-heat salsa.  The chili was still thick, and hotter than I expected.  Both vegetarians and omnivores enjoyed this chili at a potluck chili meal.

Wow, this is really good!!  The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars was because I modified it.  YUMMY!  I left out the italian seasonings and the corn. I also used Diced Tomatoes w/ zesty mild green chilies.  It gives it  a nice zest.  This dish made me happy to cook VEGAN!

I doubled the tomatoes and the chili powder, and I thought this chili was excellent and super easy!  Not too sweet at all for me.    If...no, when...I make it again, I will add a jalapeno or something to kick up the spice a little.

This was excellent.  I did not miss the meat at all, it is very hearty.  I could not find black bean soup, so used a can of black beans.  I also added more spices to my taste (to make it spicier).  Very good over brown rice topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese.

This is a delicious veggie chili! Definitely my favorite.  Being vegetarian, I did as someone else suggested and used Amy's organic, vegetarian black bean soup 
This is a hearty chili that even my meat-eating husband enjoys.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

In my opinion, this is too sweet to be called chili.  It is closer to baked beans.  Also, the addition of garbanzo beans was a little too strange for me.

Definitely not the best chili I have made.  It was very easy to make but quite disappointing.  The flavors did not mesh well.  Not terrible, but not good.

I was very excited to try this recipe.  I must say it totally lived up to it's 5 star rating.  We really like beans, and this was very good, easy and cheap.  

I used black beans cooked from scratch, and not the soup.  I also, had to use only a half can of chickpeas because my crockpot wasn't that big (saved other half for a soup).  I think it's a 3 quart crockpot.  I was a surprised how little tomatoes goes in the chili recipe, but it worked great.  I pureed a can of diced tomatoes because my husband doesn't like chunk tomatoes.  I also added a dash of cumin.  Baked beans added a nice sweet touch.

Served with corn bread muffins. It was great, I will make this again!

This is pretty good. I added a chopped fresh tomato, some cumin, chipotle chili pepper, but it still needed something...a little more salty maybe? Maybe my tatebuds are too bored. Good dish to make if you're trying to eat healthy; you can freeze leftovers in small quantities for future use. I just ate some defrosted leftovers tonite and it actually tastes better than the day I made it.

I substituted a can of petite diced tomatoes for the tomatoes in puree & decreased the amount of basil (due to family preference).  It's pretty thick so you may want to add some broth or water.  This was a bit bland although I guess you could spice it up with some more chili powder, cayenne, or cumin.

I LOVED this chili.  I used regular black beans becuase I couldn't find the soup and it was still great. My husband and father both liked it, but would have "preferred" to have some meat in it.  I thought the flavor was wonderful though.  Even better warmed up the next day!!

Very tasty!! My wife is a veggie, so I made it (would be better with some meat IMHO) and it was indeed delicious. I backed off on the garlic and chili by about 20% for the kids sake and still very good.

The chili was very good but not fantastic.  That might have been because we didn't use the black bean soup, but the chili flavor itself wasn't very strong either even though we used chili beans rather than kidney beans.  The lack of chili flavor did allow the other veggie flavors to come through.  We will definitely make this again, but maybe with a bit more tomato and the black bean soup.  I didn't think it was too sweet with the baked beans, but you definitely need to like beans to like this recipe.

I originally thought Chili without groundbeef??? I had some vegetarian guests coming over last minute, and didnt have all the ingrediants....I used the chickpeas, red kidney beans, added white ones, and used the corn kernels. I added a green bell pepper cut in chunks, the tomatoes and tomato sauce....lots of spice...and Voila!!

The only thing I did that was different was I sauteed the onions, greenpepper and celery before adding to the slow cooker. It's just a habit I have. The dish is wonderful.

Excellent veg chili recipe.  What I did different:
Added carrots instead of celery
Only two beans used - kidney & garbanzo
No soup used
Used vegetarian ground round (this is a vegetarian substitute for ground beef) to replace the rest of beans suggested
The taste was incredible..next time, more chili powder to give it more kick!!

A good, hearty, beany stew, full of fibre and protein, and very satisfying. My husband is a vegetarian so I'm always interested in trying new vegetarian recipes. Meat lovers might prefer the conventional ground beef taste of a regular chili, but this one was just fine for us.

This is a great recipe for those who are a little "casual" in their cooking. Grandma affords quite a bit of leeway in the recipe, so you can customize it to your liking.  The components are something vegetarians will probably have on hand, so it can be put together without a special trip to the grocery store. It tastes great too, and even non-vegetarians will find it appealing. :-)

I made this for a holiday party.  Most of the guests are vegetarian.  It received rave reviews and one guest even requested the leftovers.  I had run out of chili powder so I substituted crushed red pepper and cumin.

While this chili smelled great -filling up the whole house- I was disappointed by the lack of real flavor.
I tried another reviewer's advice of adding a cup of rice-BIG MISTAKE! It made the chili too thick and too bland.
Next time, I'll leave out the rice, and add much, much more seasoning.

This was an excellent, easy to make vegetarian chili.  It was simply a matter of opening up some cans and doing a little chopping. For a slow cooker recipe it was surprisingly quick. Very filling and satisfying. I'm sure browned ground beef could be added for meat lovers.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great chili recipe that I will definitely make again. I added an 8oz package of tempeh, crumbled and browned. I added one medium onion. I did not have black bean soup so I just substituted a can of black beans. I did not use baked beans since I don't like sweet chili. I did add a tablespoon of molasses,  though. I also added extra chili powder,  celery seed instead of celery,  dry mustard,  dried cilantro,  smoked paprika,  cumin,  a few dashes of chipotle Tabasco, and a small can of mild green chilies. I going to do a double batch next time for my church pot luck.

I love this!  super easy- just chop a few things and throw them in the slow cooker.  also super healthy.  my husband and I love this and make it every few weeks.
I add avocado before serving to give it a little more flavor and texture.  sometimes during football Sunday I throw some crushed up chips and mild cheddar in- that is always a huge hit!

This is a staple in our house. I make it at least twice a month ... follow the recipe pretty closely, except less spice, for my  little ones. I find the Trader Joe's Latin Black Bean Soup adds the best flavor and Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn is nice in it, too.  Love this chili. Tastes even better the next day!!

This is a good recipe. This is the 3rd time I have made it - I find that it has to cook a long time to be really good ( which I find true of most chili). I cooked on high for 5 hrs, then low for 5 - and it's great. I used 3 different chili powders ( even a little habanero),  and added a little salsa and v-8 to make it more soupy.  With a little cheddar cheese- so good !

Pretty  good, added chipotle chili flakes to give it some more cook.  Make sure you dice the onions small.  Makes a great dip for corn chips.

I've made this at least 4 times now and love it. The only things I do different is use fire-roasted tomatoes in lieu of regular and add one whole red pepper. this is so good and hearty. Love it.

This recipe was pretty decent, but it came out a bit bland.  Since I used low/no sodium products, I decided to add rock salt to the recipe to add some taste.  I also replaced the kidney beans for pinto beans due to the higher quality of protein in pinto beans.

I cooked it for a lot longer, 6 hours on slow.  
IMO this dish would make for a good DASH recipe

Nothing great.  I would not make it again.  I am a vegetarian, but my family is not.  But I didn't like it.  Tried adding hot peppers to add flavor.  Served with mexican cheese and corn tortillas.  More of a soup than chili.

A little bland as is but I added some salt and the flavors popped.  I usually don't require salt in my food.  Other than that I used black beans instead of black bean soup and I couldn't find tomatoes in puree so I just added a small can of tomato paste.  Very hearty and filling!  I think the addition of a jalapeno or two might be the only change I make next time.

Loved it!  Tweeked it a bit.  Used can of black beans instead of can of soup.  Only one celery stalk.  And an extra large can of baked beans.  Served with corn muffins - YUMMY!!

I thought the recipe as-is is too sweet, probably from the baked beans.  I made this again, but with canned black beans, instead of the soup, and omitted the baked beans altogether.  I added some water to compensate for the bean soup substitution.  Oh, I also sub a red, orange, or yellow bell pepper for the green.  I seasoned with celery salt and pepper and increased the chili powder.  This made the recipe into a hearty, savory dish.  Yum!

I made this for an orchestrated church potluck for which we were told to bring our favorite toppings for potatoes.  It filled my 7-qt crockpot.  I made the recipe as written at home and started cooking it at church before service--about 2.5 hours before lunch time.  I was at the end of the serving line--and the chili was gone!  Several people complimented it an asked for the recipe, which is my reason for 5 stars.  In making it for my household, I will definitely add more heat.

This is wonderful.  My family loves it--including my vegetarian teen son. I call it "Cowboy Stew," though, because it's like the cowboy stews we made at Girl Scout camp.  And also, as a Texan, I refuse to call anything with beans in it "chili," as real Texas chili has no beans!  

I made some moderations. This recipe looked more Italian to me, and I wanted to spice it up. I traded ancho chili, adobo seasoning for the basil and oregano. I used a poblano and a serrano instead of bell peppers. (And once when I made it I added dried jalapenos but did that in place of serrano.)  I also added Morningstar Farms Crumbles--not that it needed any more protein. But I wanted to stretch it a bit.  this has become a favorite!

This recipe is very forgiving in that you can use vegetables you have on hand and omit things. I did not use the Italian spices and omitted the garlic (my husband can't eat garlic, poor thing). It was fantastic! Next time I will add some diced green chilis for a bit of spicy heat, but the flavor was great. We had it with honey cornbread muffins.

This is a delicious, easy to make veggie chili recipe. I serve mine with a side dish of yellow rice/black bean/corn/cilantro salsa, and top it with guacamole/sour cream (vegan versions available)/and fresh salsa. Also, a cornbread muffin tastes amazing with this as well.

This gets a thumbs down from me (sorry!). My dad is helping my husband cut trimwork today, so I made lunch for them. Because my pops is on a heart-restrictive diet, I was leaning toward a healthy, non-fat meal. Between the three of us, my dad is the only one who liked this enough to have a second helping. Surprisingly enough, my "bean hating" husband liked this too, but it's unlikely he would jump out of his seat to eat it again. I couldn't even stomach more than two mouthfuls. To be fair, I am awarding 3 stars simply because the opinions on this were so divided. For me, there were two glaring problems with this. For one, all of my veggies were crunchy (they could stand to slow cook MUCH longer than 2 hours). My main complaint however, is that I felt something was missing and was constantly reminded of this after every bite. I guess I have conditioned myself to only like traditional chili with beef.... Since my dad thought this was fantastic, he's getting all the leftovers lol! If for nothing other than finding a healthy chili my dad can enjoy, this wasn't a complete waste of effort. :) Thanks anyways, sellitman.

This was my first time making veggie chili and it came out great! I used a slightly bigger size can of baked beans since that's what I had on hand, a can of crushed tomatoes, and no celery. It was very good, but a tad bit sweet so it can also be served as jazzed up baked beans in the summer and chili in fall/winter depending on the sweetness/spiciness. I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to kick it up a bit.

I also served this with vegan hush puppies which were also sweet, so next time I'll add a little more heat to the chili so they compliment each other. Definitely a staple and will make again!!

Very impressed! I thought this would be a bit bland yet it wasnt. I used the recipe as inspiration, and a starting point and tweeked it according to what I had home. Baked beans, four bean mix, left over chicken in tomatoey sauce, and spices garlic, pepper, dash of worchester, and salt/vegetta. Deslish ooo and I was in a hurry so threw everything in a pot simmered for 1/2 hour and served with crusty bread. My 1.5yr old in particular ooo'd and ahh'd as he ate it, I think it was fun for him as its quite a colourful dish. THANKS for sharing the recipie!

Absolutely amazing! I couldn't find black bean soup so I used the new Black Bean medley from Grillin Beans but the outcome was phenomenal. I topped with sour cream & chives and served it with cornbread. Delicious! We even added a little muenster to the leftovers. Will make over and over!

I altered it a bit.  Amazingly enough I couldn't find a 16 oz can of baked beans so I had to use a 28 oz can which worked wonderfully.  I used a 15 oz can of drained, diced tomatoes and 4 oz of tomato paste.  I also added a 6 oz can of diced green chili's.  For spices I added quite a bit of chili powder, garlic salt and powder and cumin.  Because I wasn't sure how the texture was going to be I also chopped up one portobello mushroom.  I omitted the corn, celery, parsley, oregano and basil.   I cooked on low for 6 hours and it was perfect!  Ended up having two bowls for dinner!  It ended up having a wonderful sweet flavor.

This was very good!  I doubled it and used 2 onions, 2 green peppers, 2 cans black beans, 2 cans vegetarian chili beans, 2 cans of corn, 1 can red kidney beans, 1 can white kidney beans, 1 can diced tomatoes with herbs and 1 can Rotel lime & cilantro.  I used 2 tbsps of my homemade taco seasoning (made with no salt or flour) 2 tbsps chili powder and 2 tbsps minced garlic. I let it cook on low for 10 hours, it was fantastic served over ww couscous and cornbread on the side.

Yum! I also added 1 can tomato paste and 1/2 tsp. ground red pepper. I decreased the Italian spices to only 1 tsp. each instead of 1 Tbsp. I substituted black beans for black bean soup.

i've made this recipe twice now in the last 2 weeks - very satisfying, filling, simple & tasty - I also let mine cook in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours as suggested by another review & prefer the longer cooking period rather than the 2 hrs suggested

Awesome chili and easy to make. I substituted veggie ground beef for the garbanzo beans since I don't like those. Glad I did - gave it another texture. Looking forward to the leftovers.

excellent starte recipe.  I'd suggest adding more spices to it, to add a bit more zip, but this creates a fantastic base to start playing from.  Thanks!

I was trying to find some ways to get my cholesterol down.  This is Chili is delicious and I was able to eat plenty. Only 1 gram of cholesterol & 1.6 grams of fat. My husband liked it very much although he was uneasy about no  meat in his chili.   Yeah for Grandma!

Made this a few times.  Very good.  Seems to have just a little too many dried herbs in the composition(for our taste) but very good.  I'll probably cut the dried herb proportions down to 75% each of what's listed next time to try out (or add 1 can of tomato sauce for a little more liquid it seems to lack).  But a really good easy recipe to use what's in your pantry!  Thanks!

Made this for my hubby who said he wouldn't call this recipe chili, but he did think it was tasty!  My only modifications were as follows:  I added an extra can of tomatoes (fire roasted), 5 chopped jalapenos, I sauted the onions, celery and green pepper prior to adding it to the crock pot (not a big fan of crunchy celery in food) and then I cooked on low all day.  Served with shredded cheese on top and a side of corn bread.  Will definitely make again.

This was a good basic chili, but a bit too sweet for me. I used Trader Joe's pureed black bean soup and added a small can of V8.   I think next time I'll omit the baked beans, but otherwise simple and great!

Pretty good!  I'm a meat lover.  My girlfreind is a vegetarian.  I'm always looking for something that we both like.  I changed up the recipe and added one chopped Jalapeno and a lil axtra chili powder.  Sweet and spicy.

If you like a sweet chili, this would be very good for you. Our family found it a bit too sweet, and unfortunately most of the leftovers went to waste even with an attempt to reinvent it for chili dogs.

This is my first review! I have made this a bunch of times, I have many vegetarian friends...I have also put different veggies in, and a couple of times I added veggie soy meat crumbles. It always turns out really good.

This was a great recipe.  I did add more hot spices to give it a bit more kick and also a can of chicken broth. An excellent healthy alternative to chili with lots of fatty beef in it!

Quick and Easy to make recipe.  We used black beans instead of kidney and let it cook on low for 10 hours.  I loved the sweetness that the baked beans added.  My husband finished it off for lunch the next day.

I LOVE this recipe! I'm a college student and this is super easy, cost effective, and it's more than enough for me and my roommates to enjoy! I don't have a crock pot so I just use a large pot and cook on the stove on low for about 3-4 hours. Comes out great! Thanks!

I changed a few things when I made this. I eliminated the oregano, parsley and basil. I increased the chili powder to about 3-4 tablespoons. I added about 3 T. of cumin and lots of salt.  I did 1 28 oz. can of diced tomato and 1 can rotel tomato.  This came out more like a spicy bean soup.  I served it with some cornbread. . .my husband LVOED it.  I left it in the slow cooker all day (about 7 hours). I will definitely make this again!!

I'm not much into vegetarian food however my stepson and his wife are, so I made this for them. I was surprised how good it was. I did spice it up a bit more and cooked it a little longer to soften the onions. I served it with a loaf of Italian bread to soak up some of the juices and they loved it.

I MADE THIS RECIPE YESTERDAY AND MADE A LOT OF CHANGES USING THE HINTS FROM ALL OF THE REVIEWS.  HOWEVER, AFTER 2 HRS. ON HIGH I TASTED AND FOUND THE CHILI TOO STRONG AND THE ONION HARDLY COOKED.  I THEN FOLLOWED THE HINT OF PUTTING THE COOKER ON LOW AND COOKED FOR ANOTHER 4 HRS..  WOW!!!  IT BECAME PERFECTLY BLENDED.  THE BEST.

This recipe was great!  I made a few changes... Used black beans instead of the black bean soup, added 1 jalapeno (will add 2 next time plus some cayenne to bring up the heat a bit!), added a touch more chili pepper, added 1C veggie broth (used organic paste concentrate + water), added a red pepper and carrot, and used pinto beans instead of kidney.  I wasn't sure about the herbs listed, but it turned out wonderful.  I took 1/2 to a party and got lots of compliments!  It is a touch sweet, but the baked beans are only a small portion of the recipe, so much less sweet than baked beans themselves.  A nice change from my usual spicy chili.  I did make these changes to suit my taste, but this really still kept the essence of the recipe and I loved it.  Served with sour cream, shredded sharp cheddar, and cilantro.  Beautiful!  Has gone in the recipe box!

I personally didn't care for this but my husband raved about it.  I put it in the slow cooker and pretty much followed the directions - I only added dill - it was a bit soupy for my taste.  But I like my mouth on fire in a bowl where the spoon sticks up on it's own.

Great veggie recipe!!  Easy prep and lots of opportunity to add/subract for personal taste.  The hotter the better for me, which means more chili powder, cayenne, and possibly a couple of cans of rotel tomatoes... Everyone loved it at the office potluck and no one missed the meat.

I made this for our Board Meeting serving 16 and it was great, BUT... I needed to add a lot more pepper, (I used Cayanne) and followed the recipe as it was listed. They all loved it!

Excellent!! I added small chunks of tofu for extra protein along with a diced jalepeno pepper!  This recipe is great even without the chili powder...makes it more like a bean soup!

Makes a lot of chili!  Also good as leftovers (even cold!) and in a tortilla.

This is SUPER easy and SUPER good. It was so easy I just could accept the credit for "making" it. It's definitely one of those "give me the recipe" dishes!

I thought it had a lot of flavor just as it was. I enjoyed it makes me think I could do vegetarian more often. I too did use just black beans the cost of the soup was close to $4! where I was shopping so I figured I could substitute it for that price. My husband on the otherhand did not care for this at all so maybe I should have splurged for the soup. My advice before making it for a family make sure there is someone else to hand it out too in case they don't like it because it does make a ton as stated before.

This chili was fantastic! I'm a vegetarian so I of course loved this recipe. I made it for meat-eating friends and they too raved about the flavor and texture. Great recipe. I think the black bean soup really made a great base. It was not too watery even with the soup base.

Exceptionally versatile recipe, great way to clean out that vegetable drawer!  I threw in a carrot and some celery, but just about any root vegetable or winter squash would work well.
Very filling. A tossed green salad and cornbread makes it a meal.

This chili was just okay for me.  It tasted more like it was made with spaghetti sauce.  And it had no trace of spiciness at all.  If you're in a pinch and this is all you have on hand, it will do, but it's definately not a 5* chili.

This is the freshest tasting chili I have ever had.  And SO easy.  I did not have the black bean soup or garbanzo beans.  I used white northern beans and extra kidney beans in place of those.  I also used an extra can of tomatos because I thought it needed more juice.  I threw in a ton of chili pepper and ground red pepper because I like a lot of kick.  I live alone and this HUGE batch will last me probably a week or two!!  Great recipe.

Doubled and made this chile for a crowd and pleased even the non bean lovers.  I used less kidney beans (not my favorite) and added white beans instead.  Excellent the first day and even better the next!

Good chili. I had it in the crock pot for about 7 hours instead of 2 (on High power). At 2 hours, the vegetables and beans were still pretty crunchy. I didn't use the any baked beans, and used regular black beans (instead of the soup). I also used a whole can of vegetable broth, with Wonderflour to thicken. Overall, a joy to eat, but needs extra chili powder and salt.

This was excellent!  I made it for a Christmas party and it was gobbled up.  I will definitely be making this again.  Also, for those of you who could not find the black bean soup, try the "international" section of your grocery store.  I found it under the "Goya" brand name.  My problem was trying to find the chopped tomatoes in puree.  I checked three grocery stores and all of the diced/chopped tomatoes were in juice, not puree.  But it really didn't matter because this came out fantastic anyway!!

I changed this recipe a lot-  no b.b. soup,  g. beans or b. beans, but I added 1 can black beans... and put in some tomato sauce then added the spices accordingly. It was so good. I made this and another meat chili for our CHRISTmas Eve dinner and my dad (meat lover) chose to eat this! Top with cheese and s. cream A great recipe to modify. Thanks.

Loved this recipe!  I did not use the vegetarian baked beans because I didn't have them, so I substituted chili beans in no meat chili sauce instead.  I also didn't have garbanzo beans, so I used canellini beans.  I also used a 28 ounce can of pureed tomatoes instead of the 14 ounce.  I added a teaspoon of salt, and let it cook overnight on low in the crockpot.  Great chili flavor, and we don't even miss the meat!

Tasted more like baked beans to me but I really liked it.  I also added more chili powder as it wasn't spicy enough.  But I loved opening all these cans and coming out with a tasty meatless meal.

Good, but not great. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about it but I took some it to my meatlover dad and he loved it. So i guess it's all just personal opinion. Also, some reviewers had said it was good to freeze, but the stuff I had frozen tasted really gross when i reheated it! MUCH better this first time around! I also ommited the celery and added red and yellow bell peppers.

WONDERFUL CHILI! I also tweaked it with the following: ground turkey, northern beans, hot sauce, jalapenos, a can of V-8, a small can of puree.  I crock potted it for 4 hours on high--excellent flavor. I did saute the vegies while cooking the meat.

This was delicious and had a great consistency. I had to modify the black bean soup to lentil soup and the garbanzo beans to six bean salad, it was still a treat. Vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike gobbled it up at a dinner party.

This is a great recipe for a meatless alternative to chili.  I subsituted some of the beans since my family doesn't like garbanzo beans, and I buy chili-style tomatoes and chili beans to help spice it up.  Great with cornbread muffins!  Have recommended this one several times over.

This was yummy on a cold, winters night.  I did find it a bit sweet, but I just added more spice to it.  I had troubles getting it to simmer in my crock pot, so I just put it on the stove top and let it simmer there.

I loved this chili recipe! It was quick, easy, and delicious! I made added more smashed tomates (large can instead of standard size) and a dash of red pepper. Keeper for sure!!  I paired it with corn casserole recipe and was a great combo. Thanks!

My husband the meat-eater loves this recipe! That should tell you how great it is! It's relatively easy to make with using all the canned products. Tastes great and it's very filling. I recommend adding some salt and cumin powder to give it more oomph.

I didn't care too much for the taste. Took much longer to cook than described. I cooked in slow cooker 8 hrs on low. Better flavor the next day. Is easy to assemble. With a few more trials I probably could tweak it more to my taste.

This was a really easy vegetarian chili to make, and very, very cheap.  I added cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and cumin to the chili, and cooked it in the pressure cooker for over 4 hours. I agree that 2 hours is way too short - after 2 hours in the pressure cooker, it still tasted the same as when it went in. After 4 hours - the taste had really permeated the chili. My recommendation is to go light on the salty seasonings, because the pressure cooker will enhance every taste.

It was an excellent recipe.  My carnivorous partner loved it as well.  The touch of sweet from the baked beans really made an interesting taste to it. I did add a fair amount of cayanne pepper to it, which I think makes it perfect!  There will be no problem polishing off the leftovers.

I was surprised at how much I really liked this recipe.  It was very easy to make, but I let it cook much longer than two hours.  I let it cook on low for several hours and the flavors really blended nicely.  My husband loved it.

This is a delicious recipe and very open to adaptation to one's personal preferences. I slow cooked it for 2 1/2 hours in my stoneware bean pot. Thickened up well and served over rice as suggested. Substituted butter beans (limas) for the corn since I was serving corn on the cob on the side. I suppose 46+ positive reviews is a  indication of a good recipe... Thank you

I make chili very frequently and it's very similar to this one.  I took a few ideas from this recipe and added them to my own, but I must reccomend adding 1 cup of rice or however much according to the serving size.  I always add rice to my chili because it makes it so nice and thick and it does not take away from the flavor or anything, it simply makes it better. Great recipe although I'm biased because it's so similar to my own.  Remember: add rice!

I added 1 tsp of salt and one 14 oz of stewed tomatoes so that we have more juice.  I couldn't find the black been soup so I just used beans.  It was just the right amount of spice!

I'm not a vegetarian but my family loved this!  Weight Watchers friendly!
I also didn't use a slow cooker, I just simmered it on the stove for a while.  It's even better the next day!

Not only quick and easy, but you can't tell it's vegetarian!  It was more kid-friendly when I left out the onions and served them on the side.  This one has become a staple in my recipe box.

I had to make some changes from the original, but it’s hard for me not to when using recipes. This recipe is pretty easy, but I have a preference for using certain techniques and adding additional flavor. I first cooked the onions and (Extra) garlic and Iadded some cut up pieces of sun dried tomatoes (maybe a tablespoon or more), and about one inch pieces of dried California and dried ancho chili’s to give it a nice complex and slightly smoky taste to go along with the sweetness, also three fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I also added a little bit of water and later some white northern beans. Otherwise I generally stuck to the recipe, cooking probably atleast 4 hours on the slow cooker setting of my instant pot.  Came out delicious- it was meant for making lunches, but everyone ate it for dinner and only two portions left. I’m saving this recipe with my modifications. Thanks!

I loved it but my family thought it was too sweet, so next time I am doubling the recipe, but just using 1 can of baked beans and replacing the 2nd baked beans can with more black beans. I also used plain black beans instead of black bean soup.

First, I found that it was very crunchy after two hours—I then cooked it on low for a couple more hours.  It has a good variety of beans plus the corn, but I thought it needed much more chili flavoring if it’s going to be called chili and not just a bean dish.  I was afraid to do much because we were feeding young children, but I’d try doubling the chili powder and adding some chipotle for flavor.  You could also or alternatively do some crushed red pepper.  It’s not about heat—it’s about flavor development.  I skipped the celery because I didn’t have any, but otherwise followed the recipe. I notice the recipe has no salt—it didn’t need it.  We topped it with zero fat Greek yogurt and some shredded cheese.

I wasn’t sure how to rate this, but decided on 5 stars because if it weren’t for this recipe and the reviews from others I would not have found my all-time favorite vegetarian recipe. I kept the bean combination (shout out to the reviewer who said the black bean soup can be found in the Hispanic aisle made by Goya) andI literally nixed the rest of the recipe. Instead, into the crock pot I added the beans, 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, 14.5 oz diced tomatoes, 1 cup water or vegetable broth, 3 tbsp of Chili powder, 1 tbsp cumin, 1 - 2 chilis in adobo finely diced, 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 can of corn at the very last minute of cooking. THE BEST CHILI I’VE EVER HAD.

Made a few tweaks and cooked up some ground turkey on the side for the carnivores. All in all, delicious!

I used some homemade black bean soup & used 2 cans chopped tomatoes- 1 that I pureed w/an immersion blender. To shorten prep time, I used frozen & chopped onions & peppers & jarred minced garlic.  I liked the end result & even more surprising- my non-vegetarian husband liked it too! I consider any no meat meal a success if my husband likes it!



P.S. This & many other recipes call for a couple stalks of celery. Being the only raw celery eater in my household,  it is always difficult to use all the celery before it spoils. I googled freezing celery & tried the recommendations of dropping stalks in boiling water for 3 minutes & then plunged it in a ice bath, removed it & allowed it to drain throughly & froze it in freezer bags. I have used the frozen celery since & it is perfect in this recipe & others. An unexpected bonus is that it is easier to chop when frozen. Do not thaw it before chopping & adding it to your recipe & it tastes & looks like you used fresh!

Really, really, really easy to make.   Smells delicious while cooking and tastes wonderful.  

Prep was about 10 minutes (mostly opening cans and rinsing beans).

Nowhere near enough chili seasonings. Needs more chili powder, some cumin,  a bit of cinnamon and allspice, and a touch of dark cocoa powder. Maybe a small can of chopped green chilis. And omit the garbanzos! Replace with white kidney beans. Oh, and a couple of bay leaves.

I made a double portion of this to enjoy now and later.The only change I made to the recipe was using cooked kidney beans I cooked instead of canned beans.It has a great flavor and with no salt in the recipe,I was surprised at how well it turned out.

Added Gardein meatless ground beef, caramelized the onions and peppers before adding them to the chili, and cooked it in a pot on medium for an hour instead of a slow cooker. Came out quite tasty and flavorful. If you do it like this, don't forget to stir throughout.

The first I made it exactly as the recipe directed and it was delicious!! By the third time I was using frozen corn, dropping the baked beans, and adding pintos. By now I up the garlic, play with seasoning, use whatever veggies I have on hand, and it's still delicious!! Wonderful!

Not my favorite chili, but decent. Definitely too sweet, ended up adding hot chili powder, sour cream, garlic and onion powder, and hot sauce. Still has some sweetness but better than before. Cooked on high for 4-5 hours.

This has been a regular of mine for a long time. Instead of using canned beans I prepare the equivalent amount of dried beans ahead of time using a mix of black beans, pinto beans and kidney beans along with a half tablespoon of molasses in place of the baked beans (this chili can be very sweet as written.) The mix of spices enhances the sweetness of this chili along with the corn. If you are looking for a sweeter chili then this one is worth trying.

It is so simple and easy! I added a 10 oz can of Rotel (hot); Progresso Reduced Sodium Southwest Style Black Bean & Vegetable soup and opted not to use the suggested spices. I ate it with warmed tortilla chips. I'm fasting so no dairy or bread this time but once fast is over, will definitely have sour cream, shredded cheese, and possibly bread on the side :-) It was absolutely delicious!

We all love this- even our hard core meat eater.  I swap plain black beans for the soup and a cup and a half of lentils instead of the baked beans and I add a ton more garlic and an extra onion (I blend the cooked onion with broth because I have picky eaters).

I serve this with corn bread and we eat this almost once a week.

LOVE IT

Loved this recipe.  Wanted to make and didn't have black bean soup on hand, so I used black beans instead.  I also did not have chopped tomatoes in puree so used 1 can Rotel Fire Roasted tomatoes w/green chiles and 2 cans no salt added tomato sauce.  I did add 2 extra celery stalks, 1 T brown sugar (as suggested by another reviewer), only had a red bell pepper instead of green and 12oz frozen white corn instead of canned corn; and did add 1-1/2 t. cumin and 2 bay leaves.  I put in the crockpot for 5 hours on low so the spices and flavors would really blend together.  It is delicious!

I love this chili and so does my family and all of my meat eating friends I've made it for. I add a bag of soy crumbles and  I leave out the bell pepper and parsley but those are just personal preferences.  I usually double the recipe so I can freeze half.  It freezes very well.

Good flavour.  My mods:
We don't have black bean soup so I did this: 1 can black beans + 2 c. veg broth + 1 heap tbsp of tomato paste + separate 2 tsps corn starch in warm water for thickener.  Added all this in as the '1 can Black Bean Soup' that is called for.
Afterwards, some family added a bit more heat but all liked it.  Next time I am going to add a bit more chili powder and more peppers - maybe a red pepper.

I didn't know chili could taste this bad. The texture with the baked beans is awful and the italian spices are weird. My kids and I could not eat it and threw it away. Never made a chili that we couldn't eat before.

I will definitely make this again! It was a hit with the whole family. The only change I made was using half the jalapeño called for. It was spiced enough for us with out it.

I can't even count how many times I've made this. Sometimes I'm not able to find black bean soup, so I use canned black beans instead and then I use (2) of the 10oz cans of chopped tomatoes instead of (1) 14 oz. It's so good!!! I usually top it with a little plain greek yogurt and shredded cheese.

Thanks to everyone for all the great ideas on how to improve the original recipe. But I still give the original five stars for adaptability.  My adjustments for my family were as follows: no celery, added a chopped red pepper and chopped fresh jalapeno, added an extra can of red beans and leave out the sweet baked beans, leave out the Italian spices and added cumin, smoked chipotle pepper, extra can of crushed tomatoes.....delicious!!!!

Really good! Like others I had trouble finding the black bean soup that’s called for so I substituted Progresso Organic Black Bean southwest flavor and used two cans. Corn gives a slightly sweet flavor. Very flavorful and filling without being too heavy.

I made this vegetarian chili using Bush's vegetarian baked beans, canned black beans (I had no idea nor time to look for black bean "soup"), canned chili beans. Seasoned with everything listed except celery. Will eat for a couple of days then freeze the rest for later.

This is a family favorite. I learned we prefer a can of black beans instead of Black Bean Soup. The Soup adds too much liquid and other random flavors.

First time making any type of chili or anything vegetarian in general.. I would limit the oregano and basil to half the recommended amount. I had something similar at a party and I couldn't get the recipe. This is very very close to it.  I would say it tasted alot better then I thought.

My vegetarian son LOVES this stuff, and my very VERY carnivorous  husband also really enjoys it. I add a tsp of chipotle smoked black pepper and a tablespoon of hickory liquid smoke. Made a pot tonight for superbowl Sunday and everyone loved it, even devout meat eaters (no worries, I also had wings & sliders LOL as well as chips, cheese and crackers, chips, nachos and some shrimp cocktail haha - GO PATS!!). I put out taco cheese and sourcream for folks to dress their own bowls. I always brown up pa half lb of ground beef the day after I make this, then spilt the leftovers in half and throw the beef in one half. My husband and son enjoy the leftovers for lunch all week

We really really liked this! We have tried a couple different stews and chilis and haven't been very successful. This one was perfect. We wanted our meal very hearty this week so we added an extra can of kidney beans, carrots, and peas (I know those last two don't really go in chilis but my husband loves them).  Thank you for posting this!! The presentation was beautiful too. Love the colors.

This was really delicious! I don't normally make my chili without ground beef or turkey but I tried this as one of my guests for New Year's Day Bowl game watching is. We can all do without a meat meal once and a while. Easy "Meatless Monday" recipe.

It's delicious after some modifications. It does needs some liquids. I added tomato sauce, and 1 cup of water, salt, tripled the amount of chili powder, and added cheyenne.

LOVE this recipe! I've made it over a dozen times now and everyone always raves about it. This is a vegan recipe, so it's excellent for when you have to cater to a large and diverse group. My boyfriend helped me make it last week and forgot to drain the cans, but it still turned out just fine. I always add a whole head of garlic and some smoked paprika to give it a little extra smoky flavor.

This was pretty good, but next time I would leave out the baked beans. It's too sweet for my tastes. I also followed others' instructions to cook it for 8 hours, added some cumin, sriracha, and a dash of salt as well.

This turned out delicious cooked on low setting in my slow cooker and set for eight hours.  I added a organic package of crumbles keeping it all vegetarian.  For the spices I substituted a package of McCormick chili spices a dash of red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of cumin.  Top your bowl if chili with sour cream, snipped chives and some shredded cheddar and the end results were a perfect bowl of chili!

This is a nice, easy chili recipe that is customizable and tasty. I served this at a large gathering as something more substantial alongside 18 different gourmet appetizers and it was completely cleaned out and people were asking for more. Don't listen to anyone dissing this recipe. Is it haute cuisine? No. However, as a foodie and wine enthusiast who regularly cooks gourmet meals, this is a perfectly nice little recipe for a hectic weeknight in the fall, or a large impromptu gathering.

We made a few substitutions to this awesome solid base chili recipe.  We used kidney beans only and added more texture by adding mushrooms chopped into chunks.  We underspiced at first and then halfed the batch and spiced over the top with a ton of cayenne pepper, paprika and a blend of jalepeno, oregano,  and cheese powder(victorian epicures cheese and jalapeno dip mix).  I also thickened and quickened this dish by adding potato starch and a bit of corn starch as thickeners.   Sour cream and cheese are both great toppers to this dish.  Thank you so much for sharing this great vegetarian chili!

I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out great! The only change I may make in the future, is adding a little more tomato sauce, as it was it bit thick after a couple of days in the fridge.

Very good ! Couldn't find the baked beans so I just omitted it. Used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and a 15oz can of tomato paste. Really gave it a good heartiness that I think all chili needs. Also didn't add the Italian spices and used an extra tablespoon of chili powder and added a tablespoon of cumin. Cooked on high 2 hours and low 3 hours. Personally I think it is much better the next day after sitting in the fridge overnight so all the flavours combine. Will definitely make again !

I've made this several times and it is always a favorite.  Even my boyfriend, a meat-eater, loves it.  I use Italian canned tomatoes and jarred jalapeños or canned chilis in place of bell peppers for a nice kick.

This was a quick slow cooker recipe that I've made a total of 3 times and I'm actually on my way right now to the grocery store to gather things to make this recipe again tonight.  My family really enjoyed this recipe. I gave it 4 stars simply because I felt like it lacked seasoning. So I just re-adjusted the seasonings by adding more.  After following the recipe exactly, do a taste test, and adjust it to your liking.

Didn't believe that such a simple recipe would be anything but bland -- was pleasantly surprised when it turned out absolutely amazing. Given how easy it is to make, I'll be making this all the time now.

Adjustments: Couldn't find black bean soup, and didn't want to use canned tomatoes since the acidity of tomatoes makes them one of the most carcinogenic cannable food items. Instead, I used a can of regular black beans (undrained, unrinsed) and 3 fresh tomatoes and blended them all together to serve as the chili's base. Had no idea if this would work but it turned out perfectly.

Other stuff: Nixed all the italian seasonings, doubled the chili powder, added a finely chopped jalapeno and 5-6 cremini mushrooms cut into big chunks (adds a great texture), and doubled the number of garlic cloves. I liked using the jalapeno (which was very spicy) vs tons more chili powder / hot sauce because it didn't make every bite spicy, just the occasional one which kept things interesting (and manageable, as far as the spice went).

Enjoy!

I am not a vegetarian, but this is still a DELICIOUS recipe. I love the crunchiness of the fresh vegetables. I like bold flavor, so I added extra cumin and chili powder.

The recipe turned out quite good but it needed quite a few adjustments. I added dark chocolate for flavour depth, mexican chilli powder, about 1/2 cup of vegetable stock, pre-cooked the onions, and I added more oregano.
I subbed black beans for black bean soup and I added red and yellow peppers as well as green.
Also, I cooked it on low overnight - maybe my crock pot is very old and slow?
End result was great though! I will definitely make this again.

I'm glad I gave this a try! The best I think I've ever had! I made this with almost everything listed. Doubled to 2 cans of tomatoes, and 1 can of black beans rinsed. I did not have cumin, maybe next time! I did top the chili bowls with thin slices of avocado and a dash of green onions. I'm glad I decided against adding in the faux beef crumbles. I thought this batch would last me a week, but we both had two bowls full. My husband is not vegan so I added shredded cheddar cheese to his and he loves it!

I did follow what other reviewers stated and made these changes - I used 45oz of tomatoes (15oz diced and the rest crushed). I used 6 tablespoons of chili powder and 2 tablespoons of cumin and 1.5 teaspoons of cayenne pepper.  Just a few grinds of pepper and sea salt. I added 2 chopped onions, 1 red bell pepper, 15oz corn, and 15oz of  black beans and kidney beans, and 30oz of northern whites. The only thing I did different from them is I cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hrs on low.  I would decrease this to 4 hours and add one more pepper  and use more chopped instead of crushed toms next time as I like it a little more crunchy/firm, but overall this is one of the best vegetarian chilis I have ever had!

I don't like beans. I made this for a pot luck where I knew some folks were vegetarians. Doubled the recipe. I had 1.5 cups of chili left at the end of the day!  Took it home. Husband loved it. Decided maybe I should try it. Whoa, I REALLY liked it myself!  Serve with a nice crusty bread, awesome easy meal. Freezes well too. Perfect "make ahead" main dish. Have served with a dollop of sour cream just to dress it up, or sprinkle shredded cheddar just before serving. Can't go wrong with this recipe. Says it makes 8 servings.  I have a 6 qt slow cooker following the recipe, it fills my crock so it's more than just 8 servings.

I made this exactly as written a little too "sweet" for our tastes.  Possibly it was the BBQ beans?  We are looking for meatless recipes.  I think next time, I will try the Chili beans in its place to cut the sweetness down.  Good recipe.

Not a vegitarian but we really enjoyed this one.  A little on the sweet side, perhaps but good none the less.  I needed to make it for more than the serving calls for so I double the ingredients and found that there was way too much for one slow cooker, so be aware of that.

Will make again. 

Used extra tomatoes, chickpeas subbed for garbonzo and a can each of kidney and blackbeans instead of the ones specified in the recipe (they were just what was handy). Also added a teaspoon of cumin and doubled the chilipowder as per the recommendations of another user. Also added a chopped jalapeno.

This recipe is SUPER easy to make and tastes delicious!  As someone who hates to cook, I wanted an easy, healthy vegetarian chili that I could literally throw together in the slow cooker, set it, and forget it...and this is it!  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I used 2 packets of chili seasoning mix instead of chili powder, a can of white beans instead of garbanzo beans, and omitted the celery and oregano.  Also, since I wanted a bit more of a traditional chili texture, I added a bag of Quorn meatless and soy-free grounds.  I set the cooker on high for a few hours, then turned it to low for another hour or so.  It was PERFECTION!  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good! I will definitely make this again. I could not find black bean soup so I added Bush Beans Latina Cocina Frijoles Negros Machados. I used two cans of diced tomatoes-chili style and instead of the seasonings I used a packet of chili mix. It's surprisingly delicious for how easy it was! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I liked this, but it DEFINITELY needed longer than two hours. The celery was still mostly raw after three.
I would probably make this again because it's cheap considering how much food it makes, and it's hearty without needing meat.

Next time, I would probably caramelize the onions and peppers before adding them to the crockpot.  I added ground turkey, but I don't think it needs it.

Made as recipe calls except used frozen corn instead of canned corn.  Cooked in crockpot for team dinner. Served with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. Will do this one again.

I have made this recipe repeatedly and we LOVE it- grateful you shared this! I find the black bean soup in the natural food aisle, as that seems to be the only place the grocery store has it-everything else, simple to find! It is so easy and healthy and I usually just add all the ingredients into my big pot on the stove-top, cook until all heated and veggies tender and it's ready to eat. Leftovers are awesome.

This is a great basic recipe - but baked beans and corn are weird in chili so I subbed 1 can pinto in mexican sauce (undrained) and 1 additional can of drained kidney beans (but any kind will do).  Also, to kick up the basic flavor I emptied my spice cabinet and added the following: 2 cubes veggie bouillon + 1T Worcestershire + 2t each of cumin & Tabasco+ 1t each of salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, sugar + 1/2 small can tomato paste (to make it thicker).  Voila!

This was easy and delicious!  I changed up some ingredients to make it my own.  No black bean soup,  just added fire roasted canned tomatoes and a bit of water.  I will be adding extra corn next batch.

Made this for a group friends. Everyone loved it...with my adjustments. I eliminated the pork and beans and used a can of pinto beans. Also Campbells has a new soup called Black Bean with cumin and cilantro. I used that with a can of water. Great eating on a snowy day!

This is really good.  I only used 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder because I have a 1 year old, yet added 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  There also didn't seem to be enough beans for my taste.  I'll add one more kidney bean can to it next time.  Will also likely use fresh tomatoes along with a can of tomato sauce.  Lastly added tofurkey at the very end and it was great.

nice and easy.  I made some small changes based on what I had available but that is what a chili should be.  I doubled the chili powder and added cumin and salt as well. worth making again for sure.  had almost no left overs.

SO EASY! AND tasty!! I added a lot more chili powder than it said and forgot to put in the green peppers. Alos added some garlic salt. It was incredible and everyone else thought so too! TIP: If it looks too watery when you're finished, just leave the lid off of the crock pot for 30 minutes and put it on high. Works like a charm! I'll be making this for Thanksgiving!

Delicious! I omitted the celery (because we don't like celery at my house) and the three herbs at the end. Instead, I used cumin and a pinch of red pepper flakes for a spicy kick.

Double the tomatoes and the chili powder. Don't drain the black beans. Add salt and pepper.  The original recipe is too dry and bland.  Oh, and cook it for 4 hours on high.

This was such a simple recipe and it turned out great. The mix of canned and fresh produce is fabulous.  My entire family enjoyed it, from my meat and potato father to my picky vegetarian grandmother. (I did add two additional tablespoons of chili powder and a dash of hot sauce, but it didn't "need" it.)

This was great. My vegetarian daughter loved it while my hubby and I had meat in ours :) However, I must say to some of the people saying in their reviews you better like beans to like this recipe, I ask: Why you eating Chili if you don't want a lot of beans? I don't get that.

I've made this several times...am a huge fan of slow cooker recipes these days.  Easy to throw together and no elusive ingredients.  I admit I leave out the green pepper for personal preference and celery because I never use it all but it still makes a lot and is a good meatless meal.

I've made this recipe a few times and it's a hit for me (veggie) and my fiancee (celiac). I've found though that 2 hours isn't long enough for it to simmer – the celery is still too crunchy and the flavors haven't fully evolved at 2 hours. I find that the chili is best after about 4 hours, and my favorite after a night in the fridge (leftovers for the win!).

Lovely! My family really enjoyed this meal. I used dried black beans and cooked them in a pressure cooker with the peppers, onions and water for about 50 mins, then added the rest of the ingredients, as I do not live in the states, and I could not find black bean soup. Just one word of caution for those of you cooking outside of the states, the chili powder might not be the same, I used 1/2 tbl spoon of Indian chili powder and it turned out pretty spicy, so I would add 1 tsp at a time. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a hit. Everyone loved it, from the kids to the wife.  A few minor changes, I could not find chopped tomatos in puree so I used diced tomatos in juice and added a 28oz can of puree. We cooked it on high for 3 hours.

Love this recipe! Sometimes a brown some ground beef or turkey and add that in. It's great either way. Also, Progresso stopped making the black bean soup. The only other one I could find was Goya. That works just as well. Definitely recommend to everyone!

I decided to give this recipe 4 stars, mostly because it was a great jumping off point for an amazing chili. I made a significant amount of changes thanks to previous reviewers (you guys rock) and my own past chili experiences. I added 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes with zesty chiles and a poblano pepper to increase the kick. I left out the basil, oregano, and parsley. I tripled the chili powder (3 Tbsp chili powder), then added 1 Tbsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp cocoa powder. I also added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke. When I mixed everything up, I wasn't convinced there was enough liquid so I wound up adding 1 cup of water with 1 bullion cube. Learning experience: that was way too much liquid. I put it in the slow cooker for 4 hours on low, 2 hours on high plus an extra 30 minutes of cooking on high with the lid off thanks to my fears about the lack of liquid (oops). Next time I'd probably stick to 1/2 cup broth (though it might not need any at all). My boyfriend had three servings, even venturing to say it was the best chili he's ever had! He didn't even miss the meat! A meal that makes both the vegetarian and meat-eater happy? This will be a staple in our house!

Delicious and healthy! Im with everyone else who says leave out the sweetness of baked beans and add a little more tomatoes and chili powder. I also added 2 onions and double the kidney beans. Ill be freezing the leftovers for another meal later in the month!

This is my GO-TO veggie chili recipe! I'd made it more times than i can count. Absolutely love it. Crazy easy to make. Can go as far as throwing it all in the crock (& fridge) before bed and then putting it on the slow cooker in the morning. I've normally slow cooked mine for 8 hours on low, but have cooked it on high for 2 hours as well. I've tried on the stovetop too. All were superb. My only alteration: I've never used the black bean soup. Instead i've replaced it with 1 can of black beans (rinsed) and 12-16 ounces of bouillon stock. Oh, and it freezes really well! I usually make a huge vat of it, divvy it up into serving and freeze 80% of it for future lunches or dinner.

This was a total bomb! No one would eat it, I tasted it and I couldn't eat it either, too bland and the tastes did not go together.
I won't make it again. My son-in-law who eats any and everything wouldn't even eat it. I'm sorry but this just doesn't make the cut.

Enjoyed it, but would probably cook it another half hour or so next time.
Also might add carrots.

I made this for my vegan sister when she came for a visit.  I used a can of black beans instead of the black bean soup. Added a can of Rotel Tomatoes with Chiles and a can of tomato paste.  I tasted this a few times to adjust the spices.  It was VERYYYYYY bland as written.  I added more chili powder, Old Bay Seasoning and more salt and pepper.  My sister enjoyed it and I sent the leftovers home with her.  Will make again for vegan or vegetarian family members.

It was way too sweet for me.  If i EVER made this again (unlikely), I would leave the vegetarian baked beans out.  My suggestion would be to try it without the baked beans.  You can always add them if you don't like the flavor without them :)

I make this recipe about once a month. I love it and everyone else in my house does too. I make the chili vegetarian, but then I brown ground turkey and ground beef so that people who want meat can add meat to their chili. Great for after skiing or a long day. Instead of using regular tomatoes I use Rotel tomatoes and for a little extra kick I use a small can of Hatch chilies, but the recipe is awesome as written. I serve it with low fat shour cream and cheese.

This was a fun chili to make.  It is a tad sweet what with the baked beans.  It tasted better with sour cream added to the bowl.  I am not sure that I would make it again though.

This is wonderful!  My very good friend is a vegetarian.  I am not and neither is my family or her husband.  Finding something good to make when she and her husband come to dinner is always a fun challenge.  I made a very meaty chili and this recipe one night and my husband (a HUGE meat eater) actually preferred this one over the meaty chili we already eat and love.  The flavor is great!

This was just ok--I wouldn't make it again without some major modifications.  It was very bland and had this sweet taste from the baked beans that just didn't mesh with the rest of the ingredients.

not your typical chili but very good nonetheless. Instead of 3 cans of beans I used two large cans of 6 bean blend and omitted the celery because I forgot to pick it up. I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and would have done more but I ran out of time.

I made this pretty much exactly to the recipe, except I used 5 stalks of celery and cut out the green pepper because of a picky family member. I also only used a half a teaspoon of chili powder because I'm not big on the heat.   It's really lovely! It tastes more like a thick, tomato-y stew than a chili, but it's really, really tasty. Definitely a five star dish at our house.

This is an awesome chili and no one even notices that it is vegetarian.  I serve it with cornmeal waffles.  I do find that it is better if it is cooked longer.  I just put it on low all day.  also, I cannot usually find black bean soup, so I usually use a can of drained black beans.

This is one of those recipes that is a great base for your own personal touches. I add so much stuff to this that it really is a new recipe. Chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce and a packet of the veggie "Smart BBQ" pulled pork substitute makes this a winner. I also add at least a few jalapenos from my garden, a can of drained stewed tomatoes, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic, leeks... the list goes on. This chili is only as good as you personalize it, so get creative! It comes out a little bit different every time, but it's always a hit around here! I think next time I will try to add some chopped up veggie 'Italian sausage' or veggie dogs and see how that comes out. Make it your own!

This was excellent. I switched the garbanzo beans with pinto beans and replaced the parsley, oregano and basil with cayenne powder (not equal amounts). I mixed it all up in the slow cooker and then tasted it near the end before to check seasoning levels. It was a little bland, but the beans all tasted very good. Good base to expand upon.

I just ended up using black beans as I had those in the pantry and I wasn't paying $3 for the only can of black bean soup I could find. Also, next time I will leave out the garbanzo beans. While I like them, they don't really go with this chili. They just make the texture a little off (a little gritty as garbanzo beans are). Over all a nice change from my regular open-up-your-sinuses-spicy chili!

I made this for a potluck at our senior mobile park. It went like crazy even though I had doubled the recipe! Everyone asked for a copy of the recipe too. There were five other slow cookers with different chili, but this one was a hit with the crowd.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!!!

I aboslutely loved this chili.  I kept everything the same, but I added a can of diced tomatoes, 1 green pepper, 1 head of broccoli, and minced jalepenos for some kick.  It turned out so good.  My boyfriend usually loves meat, but didn't mind not having any in this dish--he even ate it for three days!

Really good!  Simmered for an hour instead of slow cooking, and substituted diced tomatoes and chilis for the baked beans.  Added red pepper for heat.

This recipe has gone through many alterations in our household, but the basic structure has always been a winner.  Just yesterday I made it as a non-vegetarian mean, adding ground turkey to the mix and Green Giant canned Mexicorn.  Still can't find condensed black bean soup, so I use Progresso's Black Bean Soup or a can of black beans.  But double the spices on it; it always needed more flavoring than recommended.  Still, quite a winner!!

Great recipe! This is the epitome of simple. Just toss in a few cans of various beans and corn, chop and onion and green pepper and toss those in and then add spices and garlic. I put it on low for 6 hours instead of high for 2 due to time constraints and it was quite tasty. My husband went for seconds! Thanks for sharing this easy tasteful and healthy recipe!

I add a package of Yves' ground beef substitute and a dash of liquid smoke to this and even my meat-loving dad and brother don't know it's vegetarian. It's also an easy conversion to full-vegan.

This is yummy - quick to assemble and the flavors are great from being in the slow cooker.  I added a few more spices to heighten the flavor as well.  Good recipe!

Edit: 10 years later I remade this and it was so much better!
I enjoyed the mixture of beans. Unfortunately the whole dish was quite bitter (to me anyway). If I was to make it again, I would probably not use any of the spices, and add them to taste after it was finished cooking. Overall a good dish though! (Originally published 3/23/09)

I loved it!  (But, it tastes nothing like chili.)  My husband who likes traditional chili didn't like this as much as I did, though.  I used a McCormack chili spice packet instead of the chili powder, oregano, and basil.  I also used low or no sodium cans of beans, when possible.

Takes longer to cook (the onions were still crunchy). I give it two stars for high sodium content and boring taste. It needs some spices or something.

It was tasty, but a little on the sweeter side for me.  I think it was from the baked beans.  I used more than called for.

I thought the sweetness of the baked beans in this gave it a very weird flavor. I like the ease of the recipe, but not the final product. Maybe I'll play with it a bit and see what happens.

We made this yesterday as a "trial run" since we have to take a pot of chili to a ladies get together this week and this will probably be the only vegetarian chili.  With a few changes, this was quite good and will be made again.  We used a can of black beans instead of the BB soup, 3 cans pinto as we had no kidney beans on hand. Also only used 1 stalk celery and added another can of tomatoes and 1 small can of tomato sauce. We also added a half pkg of frozen corn, which worked out well.  Next time we are going to add a small can of green chilies, 2 cans of black beans and 2 cans of pinto beans, reduce the amount of oregano (maybe other spices as well? Seemed just a tiny bit bitter) and add a pinch of salt. Today the chili is a bit thicker (which I like) and the flavors have melded.   Aside from that, this recipe is a good place to start and is a keeper. Thanks for submitting.

Can't get much easier than this! It was easy and my husband and mother in law very much enjoyed it! She even ate it for leftovers the next day and she hates leftovers! I did find that the seasoning could be increased but with some extra spicy chili powder it had a great heat level, so just depends on your blend. Did you cannelini beans instead of kidney beans. Personal preference.

Was excited to try this recipe, but was not happy with the results. The baked beans made the chili too sweet. If I try it again I will add a can of northern beans instead of the baked beans.

This recipe was just okay.  I accidentally bought chili beans instead of black beans, and also added a chopped jalapeno, cumin, and salt.  Served with shredded cheese and crackers.  Not sure if I will make it again though.  Not great, but not bad.  Good source of fiber though!

This is a really great chili recipe and it cooks up fast in the slow cooker. The prep time is a bit longer with all the can opening and rinsing and the chopping and measuring but none the less with the best flavor and all I give it 5 stars. I will be making this one a lot this winter.

Brilliant. I tried this for a little change from my same boring old chili. It sounded good. We are not vegetarians so i did add one pound of ground turkey to it to keep my husband and kids happy but I think it would have been just as great without it. Very very satisfying especially with corn bread on the side or crumbled over the top.
Thanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely make it more often

Recipe couldn't be simpler.  Black bean soup makes it too dark; used white beans instead.  Used frozen corn; came out just fine.  Serving hot cornbread put this right over the top.  Definitely agree with those who said it tastes even better the second day!

I made a bunch of substitutions & didn't measure everything, but even with my subs, this was really good.  And it's incredibly easy - I've screwed up chili twice before.  I used frozen bell peppers and pre-cut onions to make prep even quicker, and added tomato paste to make it thicker & then added tomato sauce because it still seemed too beany for my taste.  This wasn't too spicy, either, so it was perfect for me.

This was absolutely delicious!  It even went over well with my dad and husband, who are definitely accustomed to more "traditional" chilis.  I couldn't find black bean soup, so I used Goya black beans instead and it came out wonderful.  
Even a friend who was visiting asked for the recipe because my house "smelled so good."  Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great! I made all the beans instead of using canned ones, frozen corn and left out the bell pepper as a personal preference. For the black bean soup I used some of the leftover Beezie's black bean soup that I had frozen. Will make this again!

At first, after adding all of the ingredients, I thought this was going to be a big mess, but it turned out so tasty I wanted to make it again the next week.  We added some red pepper flakes and some ground turkey the next time we made it and we were in heaven.

I think this could be a 5 star recipe if you spiced it up with hot red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, or jalapenos. I made it exactly according to the directions and it was on the bland side with a sweet undertone.  (Taste improved after adding tobassco sauce).  I'll make it again, but definitely spice it up more.

Wonderful flavor. I only changed the black beans.  Couldn't find black bean soup so I used a can of black beans rinsed and drained.  I also cooked it very slowly on the stove.  will definately make again.

Great chilli!  I did 2 batches, one on the stove and one in the slow cooker.  I found that the batch in the slow cooker hasn't softened up the celery yet though.  The stovetop batch turned out great!  Note:  I couldn't find any black bean soup, I substituted with rinsed black beans and added a few vegetable boulion cubes to the mix.

A warm, earthy meal. I deleted the celery, substituted black beans for the soup, navy beans for the garbanzo, and cumin for the Italian spices. May delete one of the bean varieties next time, as this makes a very large batch.

I was working with ingredients on hand, and didn't have the black bean soup. Used about 14 oz. of tomato sauce instead, and the consistency was fine. I'll go much heavier on the spices next time, probably also adding some cumin, cayenne, and cilantro. Perhaps the flavor from the black bean soup would have helped. Very easy for such a healthy meal.

Heavy on the veggies (go figure, eh?) It's not a favorite, but I've discovered I enjoy it more now that I'm on Day 3. I've noticed the Canned Food Alliance advertising on the site; they've gotta be happy with this recipe! Super easy and filling.

This was delicious!  I made it for my meat-loving dad and my boyfriend, who was brought up thinking that only fried foods with extra meat and fat are palatable.  Both went back for a second bowl!  I added cumin (1 T) and some crushed red pepper flakes for some "heat".  This was very filling, and neither of them went to the kitchen for snacks later in the evening.

Very good.  I cooked it over the stovetop and sauteed the onions and peppers before adding the other ingredients.  Makes a LOT!  Delicious.

We were so delighted by this meal.  My 16 month old loved every bite and had a hard time sharing the leftovers.  What an easy recipe and soooo good.  I did double the amount of tomato puree and cooked about 4 hours.  Yummy!!

This recipe was very good and quick and easy to prepare. I added frozen corn instead of canned and rep pepper flakes instead of chili powder. It can get really hot (spicy) so be careful! My kids loved it and we will definatly make it again! Perfect for cold evenings.

Very easy to prepare.  Fairly spicey and tasty.  Could be spicier.  More like bean casserole than chili.

Very good.  Well received by my kids and relatives.  I sauted the celery and onion in a little butter because it is still crunchy after 2 hours in the slow cooker.  More time would have softened it.  An extra can of tomato doesn't hurt.

This was not good at all, although it smelled terrific. I would definitely adapt this to have less beans and more veggies...IF I ever made this again.  What a waste of money.  My husband and I took about 3 bites before deciding to trash the whole pot!!

this was wonderful, but i prefer a much spicier chili so i just added some more spices and some green chiles and it was even better. this was great for my friend that hates spicy foods, she loved it.

The hardest part was opening the cans!  I wanted to fill the pot with chili, so I added extra cans of kidney beans and white beans.  Also, I couldn't find "Black Bean Soup" in the grocery store, so I just put regular black beans with the juice in it. It turned out wonderfully.  Even my brother who "only likes chili with meat in it" thought it was great.

My husband and I both loved it.  This has been the best chili I've made in a while!  I didn't have a can of baked beans so I substituted with a can of light red kidney beans.  I also added 1 tbsp of ground cumin, 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper, and a little habanero sauce.  We like it HOT!  Thanks for the awesome dish!

Great recipe! It was especially tasty the second day. I found that the minimum 2 hours cooking time was not enough...the bell peppers and celery weren't quite cooked. An extra hour did the trick! I will definitely be making this again :)

This chili is easy to make and delicious.  I added a little water and a few sliced jalepeno peppers for a little more zing.

It was surprisingly sweet for my taste, although I suppose I should have guessed so with the baked beans.  Not a bad chili, but don't overcook it as it gets mushy and dry.  Makes A LOT of chili.

Sooooo easy, and sooooo yummy!  The first night we ate it with cornbread.  Then, for another meal, we made "chili nachos" by topping tortilla chips with cheese and the leftover chili.
