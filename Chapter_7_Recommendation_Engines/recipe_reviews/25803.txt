EXCELLENT!!!  I had some leftover cream cheese II frosting (from this site) and wanted to use it up and didn't have enough to frost a cake.  These are just wonderful.  I thought 2 tablespoons of cinnamon was a misprint but it is not.  I also added 1/2 tsp. allspice.  did cut down on the nuts and raisins to 2/3 cup each and it was plenty.  They bake up beautifully and taste so nice.  Very pretty too.  With the creamcheese frosting, they are ever so wonderful.  **3/4 cup shredded carrot=2 smaller size carrots.  Can't wait to give these away.

To echo everyone else, these are delicious! I am vegan, so I replaced half the butter with Earth Balance (vegan butter made with healthy oils) & the other half with unsweetened applesauce to cut the fat. Used 4 Tbsp. ground flaxseed mixed with the liquid from the crushed pineapple to stand in for eggs. This added fiber & heart-healthy fats, as well! :) I also made just a couple changes to suit my tastes & to make them slightly healthier. Used 3/4 c. evaporated cane juice + 1 Tbsp. molasses instead of brown sugar. Threw in some nutmeg, ginger, allspice & cloves to add more spice. Topped with a lemon vegan cream cheese frosting & this complemented the cookie flavor very well! Perfectly chewy & cakey, and a really convenient way to eat carrot cake. I can't wait to share these!

This is a great recipe!  The cookies are better a day after.  I added an extra tbsp of cinnamon, more carrots and cream cheese icing with cinnomon spinkled on top!  My co-workers loved them!

I have tried different cookie recipes with varying results. The resulting cookie batter seemed that it would not make a proper cookie but much to my surprise they came out wonderful with a pleasant chewy texture of pineapple and walnuts which I really like. I put ginger in also to give it a nice flavor which also saves on my cinnamon. I will make these cookies again.

I made the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this website and made sandwiches with these cookies with the frosting as the middle. DELICIOUS!

Great recipe as written, but it's also a great recipe to play with.  The second time I made these I knew I wanted to make sandwich cookies and I was making them for adults.  I doubled carrots and used 4 tablespoons of a mixture of cinnamon, Ginger, nutmeg, and allspice.  They don't spread much especially of you double the carrots, so I flattened them out quite a bit so they would make a nicer sandwich.  I also sprinkled them with raw sugar to give the tops a nicer appearance.  Used a cream cheese frosting that wasn't too sweet for the filling.  They were a huge hit especially with the men. Have fun with this recipe!

These are awesome! I used less walnuts and they turned out great. It's like having carrot cake in a more portable format - a good balance between chewy and cakey. I put cream cheese frosting on them which was good, but you could go either way. I'll make this again!

Very good cookies.  Not beautiful and they definitely need cream cheese frosting, but a dynamite cookie with the frosting.  I used the Cream Cheese II frosting from this site (cut in half and I still had leftover frosting) and they were a huge hit with my family.

Great recipe - I was able to get one cookie before they were all gone.  So I made a 2nd batch. but used 1 cup sliced almonds in place of the walnuts and 1 cup dried cranberries in place of the raisins and I hid 10 cookies for me before my husband found I'd made more.

The batter was very liquidy so I added 1/3 cup flour, but they turned out a little dry. Next time wouldn't add extra flour... but they have a very nice taste.

These were really yummy! I am a carrot cake lover and I loved the taste and texture of these cookies. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting that I had left over. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg and a sprinkle of allspice as well as a tsp of vanilla.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  The cookies come out just like cake.  A nice fluffy texture.  No icing is necessary, but it might be a fun twist.  I made them exactly as the recipe states and it was very good, which is why it deserves 5 stars.

I just made these cookies. I didn't add walnuts or raisins. They came out so puffy and fluffy! I didn't make the frosting I bought a cream cheese frosting. But they really don't need any! So sweet and soft. Easy to make. I would suggest this recipe to friends and family!

YUM!  My husband was hungry for carrot cake but I didn't have all the ingredients necessary, so I went looking for recipes.  He LOVED them!  Moist, delicious and as close as you can get to carrot cake.  Thanks, Melissa!!

We made these last night and they are delicious! Cakey soft cookies with plenty of flavor and texture. We doubled the recipe and used 20 oz of pineapple, 1/2 tspn nutmeg, 1 cup sweetened flake coconut. Omitted the raisins and used walnuts instead. Iced some with cream cheese frosting but we enjoyed them plain too! Thank you for sharing this nugget of gold Melissa, it is sure to be a family favorite around here for many years to come!

I have made this recipe twice.  Once as written and then again as gluten and egg-free.  I replaced the flour with rice flour only needing 1.5 cups and made a 1/2 c. slurry of flax meal/hot water for an egg replacement (my first time doing so).  I also used half as much sugar the second time.  Both times I simmered the raisins in the pineapple juice until most of it had been absorbed (15 mins) which made the raisins plump and melt into the cookie instead of standing out on their chewy own.  I think this makes them more tolerable to those who are not raisin fans.  I imagine this made the batter sweeter so you don't have to use as much sugar which is more preferable.  

A good cookie that seems relatively adaptable to substitutions.  We will keep it.  Our 4yr old loved the second batch.

Made twice this week...FANTASTIC!!!!  Made once with dried cranberries.  Moisten up the dried fruit by simmering in the drained off pineapple juice from the can.  These are excellent with a simple cross hatch of cream cheese frosting on top!

The taste is fantastic.  I also added 1 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup of raisins.  Really a great recipe to add to my fall must haves.  I made it in a wilton pumpkin rice crispy treat mold to make it look like a pumpkin cookie but I had an issue with sticking and frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  Tip: really spray the pan well if you do something like this.

Just as described. A carrot cake in a handy carry around form. Very soft. Made with Cream cheese II frosting from this site. Was making the batch for another event and the people in the house snuck in and ate almost all the cookies! That is a sign they're good when people start sneaking for them! I Didn't have raisins and that was the only thing I did different. I will make again. Thanks Melissa

I was really excited to make these. Not sure what went wrong but they came out VERY cakey and more like pancakes than like cookies.  Well, I think I remedied the situation by popping them in cupcake papers into a muffin tin and baked them as muffins for a little longer than the cookies. I certainly liked them as muffins!

All I can say is wow. I was hesitant to make these because I really wanted an honest to goodness carrot cake, but after having these I couldn't separate them from the real thing. I have a nasty habit of substituting ingredients before I make the original recipe, but I'm glad I held back this time; all I changed was using whole wheat flour and canola oil instead of butter. Definitely add the walnuts and raisins, even if they aren't your favorite, because having a surprise in each bite is what I find so great about these cookies.

I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe yet- I've been using it for a few years now & it's always a hit! Easy to make & the cookies are always soft & chewy :)

These taste just like carrot cake, but better! Even my BF, who's not a huge fan of carrot cake, loved them. I made cream cheese frosting to put on top and they were fantastic.

These cookies are beautiful before and after cooking...and they taste great also!  I added cream cheese icing to half of the batch, which was great.  They disappeared almost before the oven had cooled!

The cookies came out with a cake like consistency instead of cookie like, so be aware of this before baking. I made some slight changes like all other reviewers before baking. I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and left out the walnuts. Nothing too drastic.



This cookie relies on a good cream cheese, so look for a good recipe and make sure not to mess up on it or your cookies will not be so great. If you don't want cream cheese dependency I would recommend adding more raisins, carrots and pineapple to the recipe. I would add probably two table spoons of each for more flavor.

This was a really easy to make cookies recipe. I made some changes based on what ingredients I had. I substituted the raisins with chopped dates and took the advice of the reviewer and increased the cinnamon and carrots.. Mostly to make up for the pineapple witch I lacked. Tastes great! Kinda like a crunchy piece of cake with lots of flavour. Thanks for the recipe :)

I don't know who's rating this anything less than a five cause WOW these are good!!!! I did add a little vanilla, ginger and nutmeg and then iced then with cream cheese frosting like others mentioned. Amazing! They were already really good before the frosting though so it's a matter of preference. Thanks for sharing.. I'll definitely be making these often!

Really tasty and really easy! My dad wasn't keen on them, but he's picky about fruits, especially in desserts. Made following recipe exactly, the cookies were cooked fully after 15 minutes. Turned out a little bit spongier than I expected but that is the cake-ish part of the cookies.

I left out the raisins since we don't care for htem.  I pureed the carrots with the pineapples and drained out the juice.  (I didn't want my kids to freak out at the chunks.)  Also used ALL whole wheat flour.  Texture was great.  Especially yummy with cream cheese frosting!  We made them into "nest" cookies (with jellybeans and green coconut) for Easter.

These cookies are good.  I would recommend trying them, though I'm not sure I'll keep the recipe, we'll see.  I have to say though, when I tried this recipe, the picture and reviews posted for this recipe made it seem the end-product was a "carrot cake whoopie pie" cookie of a sort.  The recipe doesn't state anywhere to sandwich the icing between two cookies.  Essentially, I believe the icing is to be used as a sort of glaze to the cookie.  We made them as the whoopie pies and think if I make these again, I'll just make them as specified, as a glazed, single-layer cookie.  IF you decide to make them as a sandwich cookie, the frosting will need considerably more confectioner's sugar added to thicken (but then of course, the proportions of cream cheese and butter may be off, and consequently, the taste).

I was looking for a carrot cake experience without having to bake a cake that serves 20 people.  These cookies came close.  They aren't as moist as traditional carrot cake and they aren't very pretty to look at but overall they weren't bad.

Definitely had more of the springy, airy texture of cake than.  I was worried at first because the batter was so wet, more like cake batter than cookie dough.  But I dropped spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet and sure enough they puffed up into cookies.  I made a cream cheese frosting and created sandwich cookies - DELICIOUS.  Will make these again for sure.

I think 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon is a typo. I used 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Added about a cup of sweetened coconut. Dropped by the teaspoon and they were done in 10 minutes. Delicious...(and a little bit healthy). Also used the silpat liner. Much more earth friendly and in the long run more economical. (I have a feeling these cookies do not need a greased pan)

I made these for my card group and they were a great success.  I only made a couple of changes, shredding the carrots and increasing the amount to 1 1/4 cups.  I found them to be quite sweet enough, enough without frosting. My friends liked the frosted ones best, but I'd rather save the calories. I'll definitely be making these again, but will decrease the cinnamon to 1 T. or even less as I found that 2 T gave the cookies a bitter aftertaste.  I used a cookie scoop and they were cooked through in 15 min.

I did some changes--1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup plain yogurt and only 1 tblsp. cinnamon which was still perhaps too much for me.  I did half the batter as cookies and the other half in an 8 inch cake pan.  Both very tasty.

I absolutely loathe carrot cake, so I didn't taste these, but my husband says they are spectacular.  They mixed up easily, they are soft, and they held together well while I dunked them in some cream cheese icing.  I was surprised by fifteen minute bake time, but it was right on.

Good cookie,  soft,  but far to dry.  I'm not sure if I did something  wrong,  but definitely needs something added for more moisture.  If made as is,  plan to use frosting to help them to be more moist when eaten.

I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat. The batter seemed a little runny (probably because I didn't drain the pineapple well enough) so I added about 1/3 Cup Oatmeal. (i only used 1/4 cup brown sugar). They turned out great! Will make again! Very moist and tasty! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I found this recipe 1/2 hour ago and am now enjoying these fantastic little carrot cakes! WOW! I will use this recipes again and again! It is easy, easy!  I didn't have raisins - I used dried cherries. And I substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for wheat flour, but otherwise to the T!

Thank you so much for this recipe! My friends and family will definitely benefit!

Along with everyone else, I recommend using cream cheese frosting. These were nice, but really they had the consistency of cake and not cookies for me. While that was a little disappointing, they were still quite nice and so I still have to give it 4 stars. I'd make them again.

Love them! These cookies completely met my expectations. A little carrot cake for my hand. I do plan to frost them for the full effect.

Awesome cookies!  I deviated slightly from the recipe.  Here's the changes I made:
- I used about 6 oz by weight of finely chopped fresh pineapple.  Was a just fine amount.
- Used finely shredded carrots (the pulp leftovers from juicing carrots).  A little over 1 cup of the carrot pulp.
- 1 tsp of baking soda since I didn't have any baking powder on hand.
- Extra spices: ginger, nutmeg, apple pie spice to taste.
- Vanilla, about 1.5 tsp.
- Added about 1 cup of white chocolate chips. I didn't want to ice the cookies so thought this would be a comparable substitute to add the little extra sweetness.  

Cookies came out perfect at 15 minutes.  All in all, they taste awesome and have a nice chewy texture.  My boyfriend the carrot cake lover, agrees.  Will make these again!

These were not what I expected, I don't think they should be called "cookies". Don't know that I would make them again.

i thought it was tasty.  my husband loved it.  i followed others' suggestions to add cream cheese frosting II, and i also added a 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut.  i think i prefer the oatmeal banana coconut cookies, though.

These were delicious!  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup oat flour and substituted the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar blend.  My family ate  them up!  Thank you!

My Husband and his co-workers LOVED these. I made some cream cheese frosting to add at the eaters discretion and that proved a good addition. I will certainly be making these again. They are like an individual cake for all.

These turned out great! Fall apart a little easy but that's a small price to pay for their moistness. Like other users I topped this with cream cheese frosting. Definitely a keeper!

I made these cookies for a friend's birthday.  She loves carrot cake and she loved these cookies so much she wanted the recipe.  I frosted my cookies with a tub of cream cheese frosting.

A new favorite. I found this recipe when looking for a way to use up leftover ingredients from making carrot cake, and this was perfect. I tossed in a tsp of nutmeg and 2 tsp of allspice in addition. Also, I had cream cheese icing left over from making the cake, so I made these into cookie sandwiches with it. I had to hide some for snack time tomorrow because my husband and young ones freaked out over how good they are and they were disappearing faster then I could bake and cool them! I also think they are amazing and am certain I gained another pound or 2 this evening.

VERY GOOD! My 10 year old son came in 3rd place in a cookie contest with this recipe! We flattened them with the bottom of a glass before baking, for uniformity. Thanks!

They were good for the first try! Quick easy and fun. I wish I added more cinnomon and raisins and had less baking powder. I wonder how they would be with jucied carrot pulp? Have fun everyone.

VERY GOOD!!!!  I made a creamcheese frosting and had that in a bowl beside the plate for people to put on top, or make a sandwich.  DELISH!!!!  Also, I didn't cook the cookies the full length, it helped keep them moist and chewy.

Um...TASTY! Just pulled mine out of the oven. My 22mo. old son helped make these and is doing an awesome job eating them too. No added frosting for us though...These are like having your own little bite of carrot cake.  I think next time I will not put so much cinnamon and will add a bit of nutmeg - as suggested by others.

This recipe was great.  My only regret was not making more cookies, they were gone fast.  I did add some cream cheese frosting once cooled, and they were perfect.

I really love this recipe! I have made it twice now. The second time, I put cream cheese frosting on them, and they are so so good. Thank you!
