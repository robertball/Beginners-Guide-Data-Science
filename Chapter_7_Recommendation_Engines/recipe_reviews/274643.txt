7.31.19  It was late in the day, and there was no way I was going to grate 5 squash .  Honestly, late in the day or not, I probably wouldn’t do it ever, I do have a lazy streak.  I cut the squash into six pieces/spears vertically, and I used the fine shredding disc on my food processor for both the squash and the onion.  Once shredded, I put the mixture into my salad spinner to get out the water which also worked great.  Doing it this way was truly easy, and they fried up crispy, crunchy delicious.  Don’t skip the chopped onions, they bring additional crunch and flavor.  A bit of a splurge nutritionally for me for a side dish, but it was worth it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
