These cookies are pretty bland-- I'd definitely punch up both the filling and the dough with some ginger and more cinnamon. Also, watch what brand of canned pumpkin you use-- you want the thickest, least watery stuff you can find, otherwise it''s almonst impossible to roll up the dough properly! Freeze the roll, too, chilling won't do it. Cutting with floss or thread is a must. Overall, not really worth the trouble...

I used soy butter instead of dairy butter.  Also I added .5 tsp of cinnamon and .5 tsp of nutmeg and some grated ginger to the filling. I also used pureed pumpkin.  I put the flat dough with the filling in the freezer and then rolled and cut it after 2 hours. They still sort of fell apart, but unless you are concerned about the looks of the cookie, it doesn't matter.  The extra spices were necessary.

I found these to be delicious! Love the sesame-oatmeal-pumpkin flavour combination.

It's a cookie made like a Jelly roll. I used homemade pumpkin puree in place of the can.  I didn't bother freezing, but just cut the dough right away. An okay tasting cookie that requires a lot of work to get a swirl design in the middle... unique though.

Loved it!  I used suggestion from comments about increasing spice in the pumpkin filling - cinnamon/ginger.

Not a super sweet cookie. But nice if you're a fan of pumpkin, oats, sesame. Thank you!
