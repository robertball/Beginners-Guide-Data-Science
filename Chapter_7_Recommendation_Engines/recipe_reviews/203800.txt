Excellent.  Growing up in Central California, I was fortunate enough to eat authentic Mexican food on a regular basis.  This is what Pico de Gallo should taste like.  This recipe is easily adjusted to ones personal taste. Fresno or Serrano chilis can be used if Jalapenos are unavailable. If you can't handle 'HOT' food simply decrease the amount of jalapenos or use an Anaheim or Poblano chili instead.  If you're a garlic lover as I am, use a few more cloves of garlic.  If you've never handled fresh chilies before, be careful.  You can easily spread the oils from your hands to your face.  If you're sensitive, try gloves.

Really can't go wrong with this.  I personally prefer yellow onion instead or red and I also doubled (at least) the cilantro.  I got a lot of compliments on this and I think the cumin made the difference.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and used serrano chiles instead of jalapenos.  Add this to avocados for the best guacamole!

In a word - delicious. If you like Mexican food, this is for you. I used to live in CA and boy do I miss the food there!  This recipe is perfect, I didn't change a thing. I let it set for a few hours to let the flavors blend together and it was so good.

Someone mentioned that the serrano chili could be used instead of the jalapeno if they didn't want it very hot.  The scoville scale of hottness for the jalapeno is 2,500-8,000. The serrano is 10,000-23,000. Be very carefull of the serrano, It's pretty hot!

Some really liked this, but I wasn't so keen on it. It was missing a lot. I would juice the whole lime and increase the cilantro, adjust the garlic to 2 or 3 whole fresh cloves (leave out the granulated) and add the whole jalapeno. There is no heat whatsoever.

I rated this 5 stars even though I didn't follow this recipe because I am sure its delicious. You really can't go wrong making Pico de Gallo its simple and flavorful even if you omit a few ingredients. I didn't use Roma tomatoes I find them to be a little too soggy for my taste so I used 1 large firm Beefsteak Tomato. I love Red Onion but I didn't have one on hand so I opted to use a little more than half of a large White Onion instead. I used as much Cilantro as I wanted because 3 tablespoons hardly seems enough. I like heat so I used a 1/2 of a Jalapeno, if you don't have a fresh pepper on hand just use the ones that come in a jar or can it will work fine. Do not omit the fresh garlic it adds to the flavor but the garlic powder isn't really necessary in my opinion and neither is the Cumin. Salt and Pepper to taste is definitely a must I used fresh cracked pepper. However you decide to prepare it you definitely need to add Lime Juice I used the juice of 2 little Limes, it really helps to bring out all the flavors and keep your Pico de Gallo fresh. I paired it with some Blue Corn Tortilla chips and the leftovers if there are any ha ha will go nicely atop of my butter herbed Tilapia fish Fillets for tomorrow's dinner.

Try this. You'll think you're in Mexico.  Or at least your favorite Mexican restaurant.  I could have eaten the whole bowl before it made it to the table for our fajitas, but I obviously had to restrain myself.

I made this today to go with carne asada tacos.  It was really excellent.  I used 3 med-large tomatoes and 1/2 regular white onions. I wasn't sure about the chili powder and garlic powder so I made both ways and it worked best with it.  The spices are not overpowering like I thought they only improve on the fresh flavor. Easy and great on tacos! Thanks for submitting.

V. good recipe. I made a big batch, mixed up a couple of tablespoons of it with a ripe avocado and got great guacamole. It's like two side dishes in one!

This was awesome and so delicious!  I made this for my homegroup game night and eveyone wanted the recipe.  crazy thing about me is I usually am not a fan of tomatos or onion but with this dish I can eat the whole thing!  The only things I did differently were add a little more fresh garlic and cilantro and a tablespoon of vinegar!

Any fresh pico is still better than salsa from a jar, but this is not the best pico de gallo recipe. The ratio of tomatoes to other ingredients is too high. I ended up adding the whole onion and jalapeno and additional cilantro. Also the garlic powder and cumin made this taste stale so I did have to add additional lime juice to brighten it back up.

This was SO Good!  Fantastic!  Not really hot, just a nice balance.  I did "de-goup" the tomatoes by taking out the slimy stuff to make sure the Pico stayed dry and not too gooey like salsa.  Worked like a charm!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. My son and I love Pico and this is the best one I've found so far made just as stated. For those who found it lacking in flavor, just add more seasoning or jalapenos or what ever you think it's lacking. Easy fix. I chopped my jalapenos in an electric chopper and it really brought out their flavor. Good stuff! Thanks for this recipe.

This salsa didn't taste very flavorful with chips.  It tasted good when it was in our chalupas, but as a stand-alone it is just okay.  Not even close to as good as this site's Shrimp Salsa.

This recipe is very good especially with a little fine tuning. I made it as directed and thought it had a little too much plain tomato flavor so I doubled all the rest of the ingredients and served it with homemade quesadillas and everyone loved it.

Very delicious. As written it tasted as good as any in an authentic Mexican restaurant. For my husband's tastes, I will add more jalepeno or a habanero pepper in the future. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe closely, only subbing canned mild green chilies instead of a whole jalapeno only because I don't keep fresh jalapenos on hand. Everything else I kept the same. Quite good. Next time I'd up the fresh garlic and cumin but for my first ever pico--we all really enjoyed it. You eat these foods at a resteraunt and never think about how easy it might be to make at home. Not anymore. This was incredibly simple and just as good, if not better, than my favorite mexican resteraunt.

Nice ratio of ingredients which is what I was looking for.  Not too hot and good flavor. I did not seed the pepper.

amazingly yummy & authentic. I didn't really measure my ingredients, and probably ended up with a higher percentage of cilantro, garlic, chili pepper (i used a cerrano pepper), and lime...but it worked. well. only drawback: I don't think I'm going to be able to wait 3 hrs to eat it!

I thought this was just okay.  My friend gave me a bag of tomatoes from her greenhouse.  They are really good tomatoes, and I thought this recipe didn't do them justice.  I've been craving a good pico from my memory of a couple of restaurants in CA.  I just can't find a recipe that comes close.  I followed this one to the letter, and although I don't care for cumin, I put it in.  My friend from Mexico City told me once that a true pico doesn't have garlic, and I didn't care for the garlic in this although I love garlic, but just not in pico.  I will keep looking.

Me and my hubs loved this! It was delicious in our burritos that we made with melted cheese! I seeded the tomatoes and used white onion because that is what I had on hand, and it was very very good!

So yummy. I have been making a version of this for years, but never added cumin before. It gave it a great little kick of flavor.

Lovely recipe and very easy! I have made it without the peppers for the kids and it was a little bland to me that way so definitely use peppers. I actually up the garlic and cumin- about a half a teaspoon of garlic and a quarter of a teaspoon of cumin. We also love cilantro so I use a bit more of that.
Thanks for sharing!  I will most definitely make it again.

Better if you let it macerate overnight. I used real garlic cloves, and it was a bit overwhelming... also used one roma tomato diced, and one can of diced tomatoes.

I used only three tomatoes, skipped the jalapeno pepper (because I didn't have it on-hand) and used a few shakes of cayenne pepper instead.  I think it needs more lime juice for next time.  It's not quite the same as the instructions, but it's pretty good.  I spooned it into avocado halves.  Next time, I might use as bruschetta topping.

This is so good,exactly how I made it except I use chopped bell pepper and leave out the garlic,just sprinkle with a dash or two of garlic salt. The cumin is really optional as well. The one item for flavor I would never leave out is the lime juice...that gives it such a great kick. We always keep this made in the fridge & eat it with all kinds of dishes,not all are Mexican food either! It's great on everything.

Such a delicious flavor! I chopped the red onion rather than pureeing it. I loved the taste of the cumin in it.
Served over/with garlic bread.

My husband and I were looking for some authentic tacos and used this pico de gallo recipe to get the flavor we were looking for. It was simple, delicious and we followed the recipe exactly except that we left out the jalapeno. Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! I used a vidalia onion instead of a red one because that is all i had, but it was great. I also used an entire jalapeno pepper and next time i will probably put two in.

This is the perfect base to build upon. I omitted the jalapeno and fresh garlic, and just used the rest as a guide to make my own. No more seasonings in packets for me, if I knew it had been so few ingredients, I would have stopped using packets a long time ago. This is suppose to be a wetter type "dip" or "salsa" I make this for my taco dip however so I make it in a siv over a bowl, and it still turns out great.

good--I made my own pico de gallo from recipe on this site. I changed 2 things--used 1/2 habanero instead of jalapeno and only 3 romas because mine were very big ones. Will use the rest of this recipe on something grilled like tilapia.

This is excellent. The cumin gives it a little extra something.

YUMM!
I just made this receipe. I had to make it twice because I forgot to add the jalapeno pepper. The opinion I received was that it tasted too bland.
I made a second batch, and shazam!, There was the kick! Much better. I love it. definitely adding this receipe to the roster!

Best workable recipe yet.  I make it for three families, all with different taste, and can please them all with small variations; heat, garlic etc.

I didn’t have a fresh jalapeno so I used caned roasted hot jalapeno – worked great.  Cut them up small - use about 1/2 the little can. Also used extra cilantro (maybe double) but I think that sometime cilantro over powers things so I wouldn’t go more than that.  Rest I followed pretty closely.  This is much better the next day!  Make it early and let it sit.  This was REALLY GOOD.

This Pico is dead on! Walmart Markets sell a pico that I love. This is the exact replica of that! I'm so happy to find this recipe.  The only things I changed were use white onion and the juice of 1 lime, because I love limes. It turned our awesome! Going to make for Christmas appetizer tomorrow. Should be a hit!

I used the juice of a whole lime, doubled the garlic and omitted the garlic powder, used a few dashes of hot pepper sauce instead of the jalapeno, green onions (since I already had them for fajita marinade), and about 1/4 tsp of kosher salt.

My husband and I did not care for this recipe.  Although we like Cumin, we did not like it in this salsa.   If I try again I will eliminate the cumin, as said before increase the garlic (cloves), and add more cilantro.  I would like to add more jalapeños but then my husband wouldn't eat it.

As good as any I have tried. But I will say that I haven't had that many different recipes for this. I am keeping it and rated it a five. Probably wont search for any other recipes until I tastes some pico that I like better.

This was very good! I followed the recipe exactly as written. I loved the addition of the garlic. I used jalapenos from my Dad's garden and they were not hot at all. I may use more next time to try and increase the heat. I used this with just chips and on tostadas.

i thought this was very fresh-tasting and delicious and i didn't even have a jalapeno, if you can believe that. i did have a regular green pepper and figured the tastes are similar enough, especially if you seed the jalapeno. obviously, it would have been better with one, but was totally satisfied this way as well.

LOVE this pico!!!  Made it almost directly from recipe, but skipped salt & pepper, added a little more garlic and lime juice (about 3/4 of a lime, I'd say).  Also - I let it sit overnight before using. Voila!!  Pico Perfection!

I'm from South Texas and this is real pico de gallo.  I love it.  I served it with fajitas and all the fajita toppings you can imagine and this is the topping everybody wanted more of.  I even had friends that said they thought they didn't like pico because the only kind they get is in the restaurant.  Now they like pico.  THIS pico!

Love it! I did use reg ripe tomatoes (2 large ones) but I cut those in half & removed the seed/juice pockets before dicing. I buy a bunch of jalapenos, broil them, remove skin/seeds and then mince up and freeze in small portions. So I used a tblsp of those. Fresh lime and cilanto for me is a must! I add some grated lime peel also. I use white sweet onion & grn onion. Fresh crushed garlic and approx 1/4 tsp of cumino & chili powder. I have coriander seed in a grinder mill so added some of that also. I ended up with 2 generous cups of finished product. I prepare in the a.m. and let flavors develop during the day...Would be awesome with a diced avocado mixed in too I think. I have also added broiled/skinned/seeded minced poblano at times and that is a nice addition as well. Nice base you can get a little more creative with! :)

my husband and I followed this recipe to the letter, however something just didn't taste right.  It was not bad - just not the greatest pico we have ever had.....................

This was excellent!  After reading my other reviews, I usually choose excellent dishes!  Anyway, this was great.  I liked the added cumin...gave it a spanish flavor.  Next time I may cut the cumin a bit...just a bit...so that you don't taste it quite as much (very pronounced).  We like cumin...but others may not.  Will make again!!!!

I could ALMOST eat this by the spoonful it's so good! I added a little more cumin and garlic powder than the recipe called for, other than that followed the recipe exactly.

This is a delicious recipe! I made just a few changes. I used a couple of my garden tomatoes instead of roma, added a vidalia onion, 2 jalapeno peppers and it was perfect!! The lime juice is a must for this recipe! I used an entire lime.

Delicious! I used a sweet onion instead of a red one and loved it! We grilled some flank steak, used the pico de gallo and put it all on a tortilla and it was yummy!

Excellent. This was the first time I'd ever made pico de gallo. I used 3 big tomatoes from the farmer's market and added a little ground cayenne pepper. Great with chips and on top of my tacos.

A little tweaking would have put this one at 5-stars for sure. Live large and use the whole lime! You can never have too much. Add 1 to 3 tablespoons more cilantro. Lose the garlic powder. You'll taste the fresh garlic, so all the powder does is add a flat, metallic taste. Double, triple, or quadruple that jalapeno!

I've just made this Pico de Gallo and it's now sitting in the fridge, and I am anxiously awaiting the end of the 3 hours! I did try it before I put it into the fridge and it is fantastic! GREAT recipe! The flavour is wonderfully fresh and the pico itself is nice and juicy. I made some minor alterations however. I used more garlic(fresh and no powder) and less onion, as well as having to use jalapenos from a jar (all I could find). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I cannot wait to put these on tacos! Thank you for a great recipe.

Excellent!!  The only change I made was leaving out the cilantro because I don't like it.  My entire family loved this pico, from my husband all the way down to my eight-year-old.  I'll be making this again and again.

Incredible!  I did add a bit of green onions and a bit more cumin and garlic than suggested in the recipe, but the recipe as written would be excellent, too, I'm sure.

The cumin does make this salsa unique, and very freshly flavors other ingredients. Due to limitations on hand, I did use yellow, not red, onion, omitted the garlic powder but used fresh, and did need to substitute cilantro with fresh Italian parsley. Lastly, I used fire-roasted tomatoes--again, because they were on hand. Great recipe.

I’ve made a couple of different pico de gallo recipes  and this is definitely my favorite.  I think the touch of cumin adds a slightly different taste than the others. Even my 2 1/2 year old grandson asks for more!!

This is very tasty., but a bit too much onion for my liking. I used about 2 TBSP less than it called for. I suggest adding a bit at a time and “eyeballing” what looks right. Probably depends on how big your tomatoes are.

This was so fresh and amazing in taste. I’ve made it twice now. Second time was even better. I roasted an ear of corn on the grill and added that as well as a can of rinsed black beans. My husband can’t get enough of it.

This pico is perfect, don't change a thing! 

FYI, I hate the tomato core so I cut my tomatoes vertically around the core, then sliced them up from there.  That made for a very consistent tomato character.

So I was iffy because I tried a bit after I first made it and it was not that great, but then I refrigerated it (like you are supposed to, I was just impatient) and it was wonderful. Honestly the best I’ve had! I tweaked it a bit the second time (added more tomatoes), and it was just as good. Recipe is flexible and delish, just make sure to let it all soak together in the refrigerator before eating lol.

I used vine ripened tomatoes, a whole jalapeño and the whole lime juiced. I also added an avocado right before serving.  This is a great, summery salad. I would make it again.

My family loves to eat authentic taquitos. This mean carne asada, pico de gallo and flour tortillas and this home made pico is to die for! I use both red and sweet white onion. I did added cilantro to my taste and my family loves it. I have to take it to all my church potluck dinner

No changes!  It’s an awesome pico de gallo. Very fresh!
Updated June 2019:
These days, jalepenos I find in my stores have less flavor than bell pepper. Use a pepper you like or add ground red (cayenne) to heat it up a bit.

Love it. I had a craving for Pico De Gallo and decided to try this recipe. This hits the spot. It's a very traditional  authentic recipe and you can tweak it any way you please,  Can't go wrong with it. Thank you!

I put in a full jalapeno instead of half.  It didn't add as much kick as I would have liked, but it tasted fresh and everyone liked it.

I've made this a couple times. We're not big jalapeno fans but used them the first time around. Subsequent runs at it, used good old Louisiana Hot Sauce to taste. Also increased the cilantro.

I changed the servings to 4 and followed recipe with a couple of exceptions. I used yellow onion and left out the garlic powder.  Kind of blah. Then I added just that small amount of garlic powder and it made a HUGE difference.  I'm  in Texas and know good pick when I taste it And this is great!
Try it in an omelet with a little ham or bacon and cheese. My morning staple.

I tend to view recipes as suggested guidelines - I used 1/2 an orange for and 1/2 a lime. Probably a bit more cilantro. Turned out perfect. One of the better Pico de Gallo attempts.

Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing. I didn't realize it was so easy to make pico de gallo, no dressing required! I love the freshness of all the ingredients, especially the crisp onions. The acidity of the tomatoes and lime sort of act as a preservative. I'll definitely be making this again!

Thought I made it as written, but just ate some with tortillia chips, OMG delishious, then realized that I forgot the garlic powder and cumin.  It was so good, I'm not sure if I want  to go back and add those 2 ingredients.  Will definitely be making this again.  It's even better than the little pint container that costs almost $3.00 at the local grocery store!

This never disappoints! Only thing I changed was doubling the cilantro. Really nice and fresh. (Needs the 3 hours in the fridge.) Better than the "Ex Girlfriend's Mom's..." recipe for pico de gallo on this site.
Note: The juice of 1/2 lime is 1 tbsp.
Note: 1 generous tsp minced garlic is about right.
Note: left out the garlic powder.

I made it as directed, that's the four stars. I also made it with green peppers garden heritage tomatoes and with and without bannana peppers . The latter 2 made it 5 star in my book even though it may not actually be pico de gallo.

I made this for the first time last night and it was delicious! I doubled it as we were serving it with nachos and enchiladas. The only thing I changed was using parsley and basil instead of cilantro because there are some in my family that don't like it. The two herbs together were delicious. So fresh tasting and light with just a hint of spice! Super easy to make too!

This Pico de Gallo is easy and delicious.  I had never made it before, but when I did, this recipe was a big hit with everyone, and especially one friend in particular, who especially loves Mexican and South American food.  My only suggestions would be to be sure to buy fresh and firm tomatoes,  remove the tomato seed and pulp by hand, dice into small, uniform pieces, and be sure to give it 3 hours in the fridge, as recommended, for the flavors to blend.  Also, use fresh, not bottled, lime.  If you do that, you can't go wrong!  Delicious crowd pleaser!  P.S.  If  your  family loves spicy, don't hesitate to use one whole jalapeno, seeded, of course.

I used a Vidalia onion and added cucumbers (removed the seeds). My daughter and I eat this so often that I double the recipe.

Made exactly as directed. It was okay for the pork tacos I made it for but really kind of bland. Doubt I'll make it again.

I've used this recipe a few times now, it's great! My kids love tacos but I find them a little boring with the usual toppings, so pico de gallo is a nice topping addition for the adults. I like spicy food so I used 5 regular tomatoes, 2 large jalapenos, a bunch of cilantro, 1 large lime, 1/2-tsp each of garlic powder and cumin. Make in the morning for taco night so it marinates. I omitted the pepper and garlic but that's just my personal preference for this recipe. Chopped avocado would be awesome in this.

Very tasty; however, use a lot less red onion than is called for.  I'd say about half.  That's my only complaint.  Had just the right amount of spicy.

This was delicious. I used Serrano peppers to increase the heat but other than that I made it per the recipe. if you don't have time to chop everything up just throw it in a good blender and call it salsa.. It's tasty either way.

I didn't have everything in my pantry--so here is what I did--
1 can Rotel with green chilies 
 Added lime juice to taste
 Black pepper
 Granulated garlic
Mixed it all up--served on shredded lettuce--topped with sour cream
Tasted as good as my Mexican restaurant!

I just made this, and it's currently chilling.  What I tasted before tossing it into the fridge was great though, hence the pre-emptive 5 stars. 

HOWEVER.... I'm afraid to see what it turns into after sitting for a while.  I made the mistake of using Kumato tomatoes instead of Roma, because I really don't care for them.  I think for this recipe, though, Roma's are required. Too much liquid in other tomatoes.  Hopefully, I won't end up with a soggy, soupy mess, because I have a tuna steak thawing that really, really wants some Pico. :)

I decreased the salt and will consider an increase after I taste it.   I  often find salsa fresca is better the next day but it requires tasting in the meantime!  Thanks for sharing.

This is my go to recipe now. Delicious and fresh as written. Although it is easy to mix it all tigether, there is a lot of mincing of the vegetables involved & that is very time consuming.

Very good!  Definitely let it sit for at least 3 hours and toss it occasionally.  Also, I'm going to add more jalapeño next time.

Very good.  Not enough heat, next time I'll add the entire jalapeño, could barely taste it.  Increased the garlic, too.

This is good.  My first time making pico de gallo.  I used a whole jalapeno after de-seeding it.  I also used minced garlic only instead of garlic powder.  Turned out great!

Excellent and easy to make pico de gallo. Been making this recipe for years and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet! The longer you let the flavors meld, the better it gets. Recipe is easy to modify based on your taste preference. I always start with 1/2 of a jalapeno (if it's a large pepper, maybe less than half). Add additional jalapeno if the pepper is not hot or you feel more heat is needed. I never add the garlic powder and sometimes add an additional clove. You could even roast the garlic glove, slip off the skins and mince it. Just modify  according to your tastes and you will have a very good pico de gallo!

This turned out well.  I used Campari tomatoes because my Romas weren't ripe enough. So I seeded and drained the camparis before chopping them.  I used one whole jalapeño which did not make it too hot.  I omitted the cumin (personal preference).  It was good, but I added a pinch of salt to give it a bit more flavor.  We used it with chips, and also on omelets.  It was enjoyed by all.

Everyone loved it. Used 2 cloves of garlic (but maybe next time I'll stick to 1). No garlic powder. Juice of 1 lime. Used almost a whole jalapeño with seeds. I also diced the tomatoes and salted it and drained it in a colander for a bit (to make it less watery).  Perfect!

Exactly how I like my pico de gallo!  I end up using a whole jalapeno (with seeds)  I tried a serrano pepper once.  It was good but too hot for most folks.

One thing that I'd like to add in the directions is on the subject of tomatoes.  Roma and beefsteak tomatoes work well.  However, when fully ripe, the tomatoes will have what I call "goo".  Remove all that and be sure just to use the fleshy part of the tomato.

This was SO good! Very fresh tasting. I used jarred jalapeno that I had on hand and also gave it a light shake of cayenne pepper, so it had a nice kick. I also preferred to use a white onion here.  I followed reviewer, Lori's advice and added some of this to an avocado for a nice side of guacamole. That needed flavor, so I added cumin, salt, pepper, cayanne and lime juice to it which made it delicious. This is a keeper recipe!

I worked at a very good Mexican restaurant for years and could tell right off the bat that this was heavy on the tomato/light on everything else. If you follow this recipe for the amount of tomato, I suggest doubling every other ingredient. Especially the lime, cilantro, jalapeño, and you should use a heavy hand with the salt. Good base recipe, especially if you half the tomato amount or double everything else. Thanks!! Pregnancy cravings have me eating a bowl full of pico de gallo pretty much daily??

Very good and very versatile. I did increase the lime juice, personal preference. Made with home grown tomatoes from the garden and skipped the red onion and used sweet onion
Instead. Thank You for Sharing.

OMG! This was easy and delicious. My husband thought a lot of effort went into this. He kept commenting on how good it was. I followed the recipe as is except I used yellow onions instead of red (didn't have any). Note: it really gets better the longer it's left in the refrigerator. Great recipe!!

Giving this only 4 stars because it NEEDS more lime juice to bring out the flavors. I seeded and cored the tomatoes and it was still pretty hearty. Food processing most of this makes it easy work.

This was really good.  I did add more garlic and jalapenos.  It was even better the next day.

This is one of my most favorite things ever.  I love it so much more than traditional salsa.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and wouldn't dream of changing a thing.  Try it... you won't be disappointed.

We love this recipe. I actually started growing jalapeño plants just so we could add fresh ones to this recipe. I make double batches of this recipe all summer long while we can get fresh ingredients. I don’t change a thing.

This is my go to Pico recipe. I have made this again and again and the only change I have made is I add more lime juice and no salt or pepper. That's just my personal preference, I try to eat little to no salt and we like the natural taste of this recipe with minimal seasonings. The favors blend together perfect.

I made this today and it was pretty bland.  I used 1 whole, large jalapeno and about a 1/2 cp of cilantro and it was still a little blah.  It had no heat at all.  

We only ate a little so I'm going to add some more jalapeno, cilantro and onion to see if I can kick the rest of it up a notch.   I'll come back and edit this with the results.

instead of lime juice i used a table spoon each of vinegar and olive oil. My family loves it. I also make this and sprinkle it on top of my taco dip. (sometimes i leave out jalapenos depending on who's eating it). It's gone in 30 minutes.

This is my go to recipe for pico de gallo.  I typically just use whatever I have on hand now but the first few times I followed the recipe to the T.  It's delicious with vine ripened tomatoes and white onions as well.  I always add more garlic and cilantro.  I'll chop up cilantro to add to the mix, refrigerate for a few hours and then once I serve I add another handful of freshly chopped cilantro to the mix.  I love cilantro that much!  Once I forgot to add the cumin and didn't even notice, it's still great!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

We loved this!  Tastes just like what you get in a Mexican restaurant.  You can't go wrong using fresh ingredients with just a simple dressing of lime juice.   The cumin isn't typically found in most pico de gallo recipes, but, was a nice addition!  Perfect with the pork carnitas I served for dinner.

You can tweak this recipe to suit you're taste buds.  If you like it spicier leave in the jalapeño seeds or use chile serrano. I use white onion and more cilantro.  Adding in avocado turns it into a guacamole. Like I said, you can add more lime, salt, chile or less tomatoes depending on your own taste.

Very simple and solid pico de gallo. Won't blow anyone away with its originality or uniqueness, but it's a solid staple for any chips, mexican dishes, or really anything you'd top with chopped tomatoes! Try it in mac-and-cheese, it's great.

Easy to make and sooooooo good!!! I personally like to add more onion and cilantro, and that's what even better about this recipe, you can add or subtract to your taste.  **Just watch your fingers when chopping and slicing!!!! Speaking from personal experience!

This was very good and simple.  I cut the servings down to 3 for myself and my husband thinking we would have too much otherwise, and should have only cut the servings down to 6 as it didn't make as much as I would have thought.  I don't think the cumin is really needed in the overall flavor.

Pretty good. Made Emily's large pyrex container full. Need to dice the tomatoes a little smaller. Pretty juicy too, used a whole juiced lime.

I made this today exactly as directed. It was delicious. The only thing I would suggest is to discard the seeds and "guts" of the tomatoes.

This is really good. Only thing is I did not use the cumin (the Mr. does not care for it) or garlic powder. I used minced garlic instead from the jar as I find it easier than mincing a clove myself. The Mr. really enjoyed the flavor of this. It gets our 5 stars. I am excited to use it on tacos and in burritos. I am using it tomorrow with home made chips. Love it! Thank you! >^..^

Did tweak this a bit since we didn't have jalapeno or cumin. Substituted red pepper flakes for the heat and a couple of drops of Crystal Hot Sauce. Will have to try it again when we have the correct ingredients!

I love pico de gallo!! It's my summer staple. When it gets hot here in Texas, I hate cooking. Simple and healthy is what I crave. I enjoyed this recipe but have one suggestion: when the servings number is changed the measurements disappear. I had to estimate for the 3/8 of onion( cup I assume)and tsps for the cumin and garlic powder ??

Only 3 stars for this one as there's not enough pepper (jalapeno) and the cumin & lime juice are totally unneeded - ESPECIALLY the cumin.

I made it with lemon juice, sweet onion, about twice as much cilantro as called for, and 1/2 a bell pepper in place of jalapeno to keep it mild for my kids.  It was a huge hit! So good.

This was SOOOO delicious!  I didn't measure exactly but used the components in the making a salsa to suit my taste.  I used a sweet onion instead of red because that's what I had on hand and real garlic instead of powder because that's what I prefer.  I will definitely go back to this recipe.

In my opinion, this could have turned out better. Maybe a splash of extra seasoning. Quick and easy to prepare though.

Really delicious.  Aside from quadrupling the garlic, I followed the receipe exactly.  The cumin makes all the difference.

Great recipe thanks.  I doubled this recipe and took half to friends house for a super bowl party.  I had to go home and get the other half before the game even started.  It was eaten that fast. :)

Great basic recipe. I made it with tomatoes & cilantro from my garden and it was fantastic. The cumin gives it a nice extra flavor. I've also made it with 1/3 cup black beans which gives it some extra body on nights that I want to eat light and not cook.

excellent recipe here. make sure your tomatos are very firm, and if possible, try to leave out some of the pulp when you dice them. it will make your pico a little less soupy. Also, use a whole jalepeno if you like it a little more spicy.

Fantastic.  I'm so happy I finally found a good pico recipe.  I adjusted it to taste, but not too much (added almost a whole jalepeno, a bit less cilantro and lots of salt and pepper).  I also found that it tasted better after a night in the fridge, and a few days later even!

Awesome Pico! Wasn't sure about it when I tasted it right after making it, but the longer it sat the better it got! I recommend making it the night before to let the juices mix thoroughly.

Best Pico I've ever had! I did not use the cumin because I didn't have any, but the flavor was so awesome it wasn't missed! I use this Pico on EVERYTHING from grilled chicken dishes, to my breakfast burritos, and everything in between. It's also FABULOUS on pulled pork sandwiches! TRY THIS RECIPE!

We absolutely love this!  I had never even had pico de gallo until last summer, when a friend made some while we were on a camping trip.  When we came home, I began looking for a recipe to try and found this one.  We like it much better than the one our friend had made (I wouldn't tell her though!).  Excellent and addictive!

So delicious. I used a yellow onion instead of red, canned chile peppers rather than fresh jalapeno (it's what I had), all fresh garlic (no garlic powder, I much prefer fresh), and dried cilantro instead of fresh (again, what I had), and it still turned out amazing. I can just imagine what it would taste like exactly as made! I will definitely make this again.

Very good. Not as good as I am used to but so much better than doing without.

Not as delicious as my local deli's Pico de Gallo, but it was tasty nonetheless. I halved the recipe and served it with chicken quesadillas. It had a very nice fresh flavor that we all enjoyed.

Turned out great!  I made it without the jalapeno because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food

This was good but could of used a little more flavor.  I will make again and add more spices to it.
