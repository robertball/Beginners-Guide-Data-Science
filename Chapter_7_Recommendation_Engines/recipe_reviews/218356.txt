For me, this recipe was four and a half stars. Almost five. This halved really well. I made this recipe according to recipe, making no substitutions. I got 10 good sized cupcakes out of a half recipe. They baked up beautifully--mine took just under 25 minutes. I'm really glad I had the mindset to spray my muffin cup liners liberally with non-stick spray. Even so, these did stick a little, but not much. My one issue with these cupcakes is that they're really sweet. REALLY sweet. It's the cupcakes by themselves, not the filling or the topping. That's really the only issue I have. These cupcakes are the perfect moistness and the crumb is just right, the filling is perfect, "frosting" is just right--it's just too much sugar in the actual cupcake. Next time I make these, I'll cut the sugar back to 1/3 of a cup for a halved recipe. I think then they'll be just right. Thanks so much for such a wonderful cupcake recipe. I look forward to trying these again. NOTE: If you don't have a pastry bag, use a ziploc bag and just insert a tip into the end of the bag that you cut a slit out of one of the bottom ends. It works just as well.

A little bit of effort but very tasty. My hubs says they taste like strawberry shortcake. I made this as stated in the recipe except I did not use sugar free pudding -just a personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!  I forgot to mention I did make my own whipped topping using a recipe on this site. So much better than store bought and very easy!

I did not care for this recipe.  first off, the cupcakes did not rise at all! luckily i filled most of them up higher than 2/3 of the way. but the ones that i filled 2/3, looked very empty in the cups. secondly, these cupcakes did not want to come off of the cups! i used oil spray to coat the cups, but still when i tried to get them out of the cup, about half of the cupcake remained stuck to the edges.  the taste of the cake itself was good, but yes, it was just too heavy.
