It took SIX batches to finally get this recipe to turn out right for me.  You have to be EXACT!!!  It carmelized on me twice, didn't set for me twice and turned into granules, pebble like, once.  But, after finally getting it right, it was DELICIOUS.  Two hints that I think helped me are #1- you may not necessarily get the exact temperature on your candy thermometer, but if your mixture turns into a soft ball when dropped in cold water it's ready & #2- when you add the last ingredients, the butter, etc...add them into the pan that you cooked the 1st ingredients. Whatever you do, DON'T remove your mixture out of the saucepan into a different bowl w/ the butter.  I think that by doing that I cooled the mixture way too fast & I turned it into rocks.  
 All in all, this experience for me was the first time I ever made fudge & if it is for you too, then have enough ingredients to make a few batches.  I can't tell you how many trips I made to Albertson's that night trying to get it right.  But, it was well worth it, the fudge is delicious!

Excellent flavor, but texture leaves a little to be desired. Made 3 times. Not a creamy fudge, but slightly on the granular side.  Tried using half and half in place of milk - no difference in texture.  For those who have had problems with the fudge not setting up, there are two possible reasons. First off, fudge should never be made on a rainy/snowy day, nor one with high relative humidity. Water is the enemy of fudge. Save this task for a clear day.  Secondly, the correct temperature is a must. There is a range, between 232-238 for soft ball. Test the calibration on your thermometer by boiling water and checking against 212 degrees.  One note on this fudge. Mine never lost its gloss. The first time, I beat it for about 10 minutes, and although it got thick, it was still very glossy. The next 2 times I beat it for about 2 minutes and 1 minute, respectively. It thickened up right away. No difference in texture.  Still grainy. I never use compound spices, as I prefer to make my own mixtures, giving greater control over final flavor. Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp cloves. Delicious! Update: Discovered the source of the grainy texture, FINALLY! When you add the butter, vanilla and spices (after removing from heat,) DO NOT MIX IN, as the recipe states (only add them to the pan.) In candy making, this step is called "seeding." After seeding, WAIT TO MIX THEM IN until the time when you beat the mixture at 110 degrees. Still not super creamy, but no longer grainy.

Okay...  PLEASE don't give up if this doesn't set right the first time.  I thought my recipe was a goner-- it still wasn't set after 5 hours.  So, I figured, what the heck--  I put it ALL back into the saucepan and reheated it to 235 degrees instead of 232.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I let it cool and beat it as usual, and it turned out perfectly!!  So, there's still hope even if it doesn't turn out the first time.  Or you could always use the goop as a dip or icing for gingersnaps.  (I almost want to screw up a batch just for this purpose!!)  It's soooooo tasty!

I am not a chocolate person, so this is a great alternative to chocolate fudge. I agree that you need to do the soft ball test in cold water, mine was ready a bit before my thermometer said it was -- it depends on the thickness of your pan, how evenly it cooks, and the placement of your thermometer on the pan. LET IT COOL COMPLETELY to 110 before beating. It did take about 30 minutes to cool. I only had to beat it about 3-5 minutes with an electric hand mixer, and it was rady to go. The flavor is incredible!

Pumpkin Fudge!!! I had never heard of such thing before I came across this recipe while looking for yummy stuff to make for the holidays.  Being a lover of all things pumpkin, I had to try this - And I was not disappointed.  I had never made candy of any sort before, but this turned out perfectly the very first time I made it.  Just follow the directions exactly and it will turn out.  This is one of the yummiest things I've tried in a long time, and everybody who has tried it agrees.
My ONLY complaint is that it was somewhat of a lengthy process (took me a couple hours) from start to finish, but this certainly wouldn't stop me from making it again.

This recipe turned out quite nicely.  If you know how to make fudge, you'll have no trouble with it.  The pumpkin flavor is a nice seasonal change from chocolate, but not something I'd want year-round.  I'm cutting it with a tiny pumpkin-shaped cookie cutter to take to a harvest party, along with other flavors/shapes (maple fudge cut with a maple leaf cutter, and chocolate fudge cut with an acorn cutter).

At first my fudge came out gooey, but after I cooked it two more times (at a little higher temp. each time) it set perfectly and tasted great. All who were lucky enough to get a piece loved it. I will definately be making this again - hopefully in one try! Thanks Ginger!

What a flavorful fudge! I took the suggestions of BARICAT & had great results. I was a little confused as to her directions though....wasn't sure whether I should add the butter & spices & not mix it in until it had cooled or if I was to wait until it had cooled to add the butter & spices. I went w/ adding but not mixing. It took a very long time to come to 232 & a very long time to cool to 110 so be patient & don't make this if you are crunched for time. It's not difficult at all to make...just time consuming. This set up perfectly w/ no need to refrigerate & I didn't have any problems w/ texture (thanks BARICAT!). My only complaint is that it was a little buttery...and that it makes such a small batch. ;o)Hubby loved this fudge & he is not a fudge lover...says the typical fudge is too rich & sweet. Duh! LOL I loved the seasonal flavor of the fudge...hope my family enjoys it on our dessert table Thanksgiving day. Thanks Ginger!

Wonderful flavor.  Be sure to follow the directions exactly and not stir it while it is cooking. Texture is a little
funny, will try the suggestion to not stir in the last ingredients until it has cooled.

This has to be the best Pumpkin Fudge I have ever tasted! It was very creamy and smooth. I put the batch I made out for Thanksgiving and it was gone in no time. I looked at the other reviews and didn't scrape the bottom of the pan as suggested and followed the directions when it said not to stir and it came out perfect on the first batch! I also didn't have a candy thermometer so I tested it the old fashioned way with a cup of cold water and it came out fine. I suggest you read some of the other successful reviews for some extra advice. Hope this helped.

If you love pumpkin, don't be scared of the negative reviews. 1. Test your thermometer in boiling water and make sure it's accurate (mine was 5 degrees off, a HUGE difference in candy making). 2. When it first boils, brush sides of pan with wet pastry brush. This will dissolve sugar crystals on the side of the pan and help keep fudge from being grainy. A grainy texture is NOT due to the pumpkin, it's due to sugar crystalization. 3. Lower heat to medium and DON'T STIR! This will also kick-off sugar crystalization. It took 40 minutes for mine to get to 232-238 degrees. Immediately pour fudge onto granite/marble counter or back of a cookie sheet DO NOT SCRAPE PAN OUT. Mine was slightly brown on the bottom. Just like with caramel, this is why you don't scrape the pan out. Let sit until temp lowers to 110 (took 20 minutes on granite with house at  75 degrees) Put it all in a mixer and beat untiil it loses gloss/starts to look opaque (took 10 minutes). Put in prepared pan and let cool 1-2 hours on rack. This resulted in PERFECT consistancy. Nice and pumpkiny. You can do this! Just be super careful of temps.

I LOVE this recipe but have found that you need to cook to SOFT BALL stage by a candy thermometer! Then test is by the Water method as well. I also add the Butter, Vanilla and spices while its cooling & AFTER it cooks. NEVER TRY TO COOK FUDGE OR CANDY WHEN ITS RAINING OR THE HUMIDITY IN YOUR HOUSE IS ABOVE 45DEGREES. This fudge is great and everyone loves it. I also leave out the nuts

I made this fudge for Christmas and it got rave reviews from everybody. As I am a pumpkin farmer, I used fresh (home-frozen) pumpkin rather than canned. Canned pumpkin can vary in content and quality. It took longer to cook than regular fudge, and it looked "funny" while cooking, but that was due to the pumpkin. It set just great the first time, even though I made it while a heavy snowstorm raged outside. I found the texture to be somewhere between creamy and grainy. Call it "soft grainy."

Those who had the recipe fail would do well to read "The Physical Chemistry of Making Fudge," by Sue Ann Bowling. Find it by Googling "fudge chemistry" (without the quotes) It explains the importance of many of the various inputs. Accurate measurement is essential. An accurate thermometer is also a huge help.

Because several reviewers found this recipe tempermental, I watched the fudge with great care.  I don't have a candy thermometer, so I tested it several times till it reached soft ball stage.  It took a while!  I was patient, and did not scrape the bottom as people said not to, it did scorch slightly on the bottom.   I thought it was very sweet, and the pumpkin flavor was slightly more subtle than I expected.  Instead of using pumpkin puree, and adding spices, I used pureed pumpkin that already had pumpkin pie spice added to it.   It set up well and had a smooth consistency.

Excellent taste, but I think it lacks detail in the instructions, which may be the cause of the mixed reviews and results. This recipe, as written, is really for those experienced with fudge making. I suggest test your candy thermometer's boiling point for water and adjust the temperature of this recipe accordingly, unless you are really familiar with soft ball testing, and be sure you use a *heavy* saucepan. As to my own first batch, I tried what another reviewer suggested, which was to add the butter, spice, and vanilla, but not mix them in until the mixture cooled to 110 degrees--well, if you plan to mix by hand, you may want to start stirring before it cools to that temperature. For me, the butter did not mix in well. For my first batch, the combination of not getting all the butter mixed in and letting the fudge get a bit too past the loss of gloss stage resulted in it being crumbly when I cut it, but to my own surprise after reading other reviews, it was creamy, not at all grainy! Yummy! I will be making this one again.

Based on an old favorite recipe for regular fudge, I tried this fudge with the butter included from the beginning, boiled the fudge for 15 minutes, then let it cool 3 minutes, added the vanilla and spice. Then I beat it with electric hand held mixer until it thickened and lost it's gloss. Added the nuts and it was WONDERFUL!

As others have stated you make fudge on a fudge day. You also need to know your pan and utensils. If you make candy often it is worth the investment in a pot that will give you great results. I use a very heavy bottomed pot a metal spoon that is kept in hot water, so that it does not chill the pot when you stir. A cold breeze, a fan, washing dishes, all these will affect your candy. When you cool the fudge leave it on the stove where it is warm so that it cools very slowly. If you don't have the room, stick it in your oven or microwave where no cool breezes can reach it. If you have sugar grains on the side remove with a damp cloth or paper towel. They will gather more sugar granules if left, or if added to mix, will stay grainy.  Candy takes practice, so practice and enjoy the rewards.

Great taste, horrible method.  
I wish I had read the reviews... I LOVE the taste of this, and DID follow the recipe to a tee, but still ended up with a gooey mess. The good news = I took the goo, melted it back down, added another 3 c. white choc. chips, and now it's much better.  Way to save a recipe - that I made 3 batches of!

It was very sweet but pumpkiny. Taking other reviews in mind, when it came to a boil I let it boil a minute longer to be sure. I did not stir when adding the spices and butter until later directed. I beat the heck out of it then. It was overcast that day but not raining. It turned out good. Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves & 1/2 tsp cinnamon cause I'm not a big ginger fan.

The temperatures are right-on, but be careful during the "beating" stage after the fudge mixture cools down to 110 degrees.  Be very aware of when the mixture "begins to lose its gloss" and don't beat any further!  When you see the sudden loss of gloss, immediately spoon it into pan, or you will have NO time at all to get it in there...I had to spread it out with the palms of my hands because it was hardening so fast!  The fudge still came out with a creamy, non-granular texture, but it is a little bit harder than I would like it to be.

Use a candy thermometer - and your fudge will turn out great! Sugar is very temperamental, so if the temp isn't right it will change the crystalline structure. It takes a bit for it to reach the temp needed - because all the water has to boil off first (so it'll sit at 100C/212F for quite a while), before the temp can go up. 

For the pumpkin spice, I used nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and cloves, and I also used about 1/3 cup of half and half and the rest milk. 

That said, this fudge was a huge hit with everyone who ate it - creamy, sweet, smells great. I look forward to making it again (made it twice this week!) and perhaps dipping it in chocolate.

I really had my doubts about this, everyones nose went ewww.  I had never even atempted to try fudge, to complicated.  the directions we're exact and easy to follow, which I never do, usually, I even bought a thermometer to try this.  It was awesome I sent some to shcool, I have had 5 request for the recipe. I have a new family tradition. Thank you

This was my first attempt at fudge making.  Followed instructions exactly as written and fudge turned out creamy and delicious.  Make sure to use large enough saucepan, as mixture will tend to bubble considerably during the cooking process!

This will not set at the temp given.  If you get it up to 240 degrees it should set well and taste delicious.  It was a hit after the first batch flopped.

This was great. Flavor and texture perfect.  Hint: If you stir it after it begans to boil, it WILL have a grainy texture.

Don't try this without a candy thermometer! I am usually a pretty good judge of temperature, but I could never get this fudge to set. And my stirring arm is sore today! It looked lovely, but it was never anything more than blobs of sugary orange goo. Also, from what I tasted, it was rather bland, and could use more spice.

This needs LOTS of stirring--stir until it has no hint of gloss, not until it begins to lose its gloss.  The taste is great though.

This recipe is delicious - but difficult. I've had it not set, had it carmelize, had it turn to rocks, you name it. I started using a bigger pot to avoid boil-over. Takes me roughly 12 mins to get the ingredients to reach a boil, then another 15 mins to reach 132 degrees, then another 40 mins to get down to 110. I then threw it all in a mixer and mixed on low/medium for five minutes. Not sure it really lost it's gloss but it did thicken. Hopefully this'll work!

I did not care for this recipe. I must have done something wrong because it came out so hard that we couldn't get it out of the pan w/ a knife, let alone eat it. I'd love to try it once more since I LOVE pumpkin, but I followed the recipe perfectly...unsure about this one.

It is a bit sweet, but still really yummy!  I thought it was perfect for Thanksgiving, and it hits that pumpkin craving that strikes this time of year.

I am NOT a baker, nor have I ever made candy before.  In fact, I had to buy a candy thermometer just for this.  However, I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it is written, and it turned out really well, and was the consistency I expected of fudge.  It does take at least 20 minutes to get to that soft ball temp.  Although a bit time-consuming, it was actually pretty simple to make.

I followed this recipe to a "T." Everything went beautifully. However, I won't use this recipe again... I'm not even sure I'll eat the batch I made, so I'm sad for the waste of my beautiful homemade pumpkin puree. :( I didn't care for the texture or the taste of this fudge, so I guess I'll continue my search for the perfect pumpkin fudge!

Very fun and yummy version of fudge! Wish it had more pumpkin flavor. I didn't have a candy thermometer so I used the drop in cold water method.  It worked great. Can take over 20 minutes to get to the right temp. I let the mixture sit in the pan for 10 minutes before I added the butter and spices.

This fudge was amazing, but far too sweet. This is my first time making fudge so I'm not sure if that was my fault (I added table syrup instead of corn syrup). I keep going back to eat more but no one else in my family will even touch it :(. The flavor is amazing.

I haven't made fudge since making it with my Dad like 30 years ago (he was the fudge king!) But I thought I would try this, it turned out perfect! Follow the recipe exactly and then when it's time to beat it, the more the better.

This recipe is actually incredibly simple, if executed properly. As others have said, do not stir or scrape the bottom of this at all after it has boiled. I used a thick cast-iron pot, and it still burned a nice layer on the bottom - expect this.   While it was boiling at medium temperature, I made a point of skimming the sides for sugar build up - if you don't want grainy fudge, I recommend it. After letting it boil for about 35 minutes and getting it to the point where it formed soft balls in cold water, I transfered it into just a simple metal baking dish to cool, no fancy surfaces or specific room temperatures required.  Let it cool to about 45c and then whisk the hell out of it. It only took me about five minutes using a wooden spoon.    Place into a small baking dish or molds to let cool - do not refrigerate, it will ruin everything!    P.S.  As this recipe calls for a fair amount of butter, it makes an awesome addition to the arsenal of the "alternative chef".

I have made this recipe for Christmas for yearsmany years.    I give it away for gifts and people look forward to recieving it each year.  You need to make sure you get it to a soft ball stage or it will be runny.  I love this fudge though and it is nice for people who don't like chocolate!!  Yummy!

I made this fudge for the first time today but it did not set(and I left it overnight).....But DONT GIVE UP!!! I just put it back into the pot and brought it back up to a boil until soft balls formed when dropped into cold water(did not use thermometer second time)Also I added extra spices for personal taste...when I got to the part were you have to beat it until think I found it helpful to put bottom of pot in a cold bath in the sink while stirring and it turned out nicely...The pumkin flavor isnt overwhelming and it is quite sweet but its still a pretty good fudge recipe overall.

The fudge itself came out prefectly, but it's sooooo sweet! You can only eat very tiny bits at a time. My husband, who is not a sweet eater, couldn't stomach it, but other people didn't seem to mind it. I ended up making truffles out of it by letting it soften and rolling it into balls and then dunking them in melted chocolate. This was a big hit. My mom even asked for the recipe!

Very yummy! It didn't turn out the first time I made it because I didn't follow the advice of others to read the chemistry of fudge, but after I read it and attempted it again it turned out perfect!! I usually buy pumpkin fudge from the candy store but not anymore!

Chalk it up to user error but I've never had any luck with fudge, and this recipe was no exception. It wouldn't set. I had a pumpkin goo that tasted really good. But I don't think it's any fault of the recipe. I'm just going to stick to EATING fudge.

I really like this recipe! I made some to take to Thanksgiving dinner last year and it was a hit. I had several people ask me for the recipe. It is a nice alternative to all of the cookies and pies. This was my first attempt at making fudge and I didn’t have a thermometer. It didn’t go as well as I had wanted, but I still liked the end result. Personally, I liked that the texture was not smooth. I made it again for my husband to take in to work and it was a hit there as well!

Outstanding!  Makes a wonderfully unique hostess gift, it's such a treat.  Will be using it for many hostess gifts this coming year for sure.
... updated to say several years later this is still a huge hit and mom just told me that dad loves it.  Don't stir the butter until you are ready to remove the gloss. If you get it too hardened in that timeframe (btdt) a hand mixer works great, just press the fudge into the pan when you are done and refrigerate.  I know, not as easy but it may save you from remaking and it's loved just the same.

Everyone who has ever tried this thinks it's just wonderful.  It does take some time, but it's not 'working' time, it's 'waiting' time.  You could go watch TV while it's cooking and then while it's cooling down.  I've already made 3 batches. Make sure you cut the fudge in small chunks, it's sinfully rich.

I followed the directions to the letter and beat it like crazy- took over 1/2 hour to thicken before I could pour it into the pan.  I was really looking forward to the recipe because it sounded like the fudge I get at the Door County Confectionary in Wisconsin.

This was great! I did as one reviewer commented and just added the ingredients and did not stir until it reached 110. My little hand mixer would not whip it up so I put it in my kitchenaide and it creamed it beautifully. Will know next time to pour straight into my mixer bowl instead of trying with a small hand blender. HIGHLY recommend. Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

Deserving of 5 stars, but VERY DIFFICULT and time consuming! So based on that, definitely not for everybody. I read all the reviews but followed the recipe and technique, unmodified (since I'd never made fudge before) and it did come out perfect. As for cooling to 110 and beating until the gloss starts to disappear, my hand and arm grew quickly tired, so I used my electric mixer on the lowest speed-this worked well. I will most definitely make this again, and soon.

This turned out absolutely perfect consistency-wise.  After looking at other reviews, I took the temp up to 235 and just added in the butter, etc., but did not stir until it had cooled to 110.  Instead of milk I used rice milk, and for the walnuts used half regular and half black.  It is incredibly sweet candy, so small portions for sure.

The recipe turned out very well.  One tip I have learned about making candy is to put the saucepan in a cast iron skillet over the burner while boiling and cooking the candy.  Another tip is NOT stirring after the butter ,spices and vanilla extract are added until the mixture has cooled to 110 degrees farenheit.I find a candy thermometer to be essential in making candy.  As other reviewers noted, the fudge takes a long time to reach the 232 degrees farenheit and to cool,  but be patient.  I had absolutely no problems with this recipe.

Baked the pumpkin this year, so I needed some entertaining things to do with all of it and this was one of them.  It turned out terrible, a big mess of (tasty) pumpkin goo, so I took the advice of another reviewer. I patiently poured it all back into the pan and this time heated to 239 instead of 232.  I read elsewhere that soft ball stage is 235-240, so I think that by going to exactly 232 I missed it (even though I thought I saw a soft ball in water).  On the reheat I was also careful to brush the sides of the pan with water.  I had a thick bottomed tri-ply stainless pan, so I didn't have any burning problems at all *phew!* Yum! Keeping this one in the recipe box for sure.  Simple, but time consuming.  Oh, and I didn't have any light corn syrup so I left it out entirely, figuring the sugar would do the trick.

You really need to use a HEAVY pan for cooking this,it will definitely burn (any candy will) if you use a flimsy pan...also you will burn if you don't stir constantly.  Nice change from chocolate. (still love chocolate best, though!)  :0)

The candy burned without constant stirring and the texture was not good.  It's not creamy, but has a grainy feel, presumably from the pumpkin.

Disappointed! Sounded good but once boiling, the liquid didn't rise past 200 degrees...boiled for about 20 minutes till it finally burned! The recipe didn't state how long it SHOULD take to reach temperature either. Off to try another recipe : (

Attempted to make this, but it burned on the bottom of the pan just before reaching soft ball stage. 

Should use double boiler for this.

I've neer made fudge.  I had a hard time getting this mixture up to temperature since it kept boiling over the pot.  So much that I had to dump out a lot of the contents.  I used marshmallows instead of corn syrup since I thought I had it, then mid recipie, I realized it wasn't there.  Maybe that is why I had trouble.

Anyway, the flavor was great, and it didn't set.  Stayed glossy and taffy like, even when I froze it.  I guess I'll have to follow it to a "T" next time.  

It was VERY simple though I'll give it that.  Flavor was SO yummy if you like pumpkin/pie.  I will go for it again.

Great recipe! I have tried other pumpkin fudge recipes and they never turn out, this one was a gem!  Remember not to stir after it boils!(so the texture is not grainy)  Mine turned out smooth and set up perfect. It was a big hit with my family! It is a bit sweeter than other fudges but still excellent! Only thing I did different was to put it in a 9x13 pan.  Thanks so much for sharing! Will make again and again! :)

Great!  I would call these "Pumpkin White Chocolate Bars" to get people to try them.  ;-)  I used a non-stick pan instead of lining it with foil, and it worked fine.  When cooking, watch for burned fudge rising to the top.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I boiled the fudge until 234 instead of the called-for 232 degrees.  Then, I beat the mixture for about 20 mintues.  Set up perfectly and was a HIT on Christmas Eve.  I will make this one again next year!

I'm pretty good at making traditional fudge but had no luck getting this fudge to set up. I tried twice but had slime both times.  It's a shame because the slime tasted pretty good.

on our honeymoon 3 years ago in tennessee, we had the most wonderful pumpkin pie fudge!  i have been unable to duplicate it until now!  this is the yummiest recipe, it is not that hard to make, but you definitely need the thermometer.. i heated it to 250 by accident and it still turned out wonderful... the first i stirred it as it was simmering by accident and it turned all grainy and wouldn;t harden.. so do make sure you follow the recipe... ;)~

I may have made it wrong, but following the recipe it was like a sludge. Not fudge like at all.

easy to make,just make sure you heat it to the softball stage(I don't use a thermometer)and don't stir till it cools a bit after you add butter spices vanilla.I added dried cranberries and raw pumpkin seeds,also used a little coffee cream in place of 1/4 cup milk...turned out great)...a new holiday favourite

I've seen a lot of people complain about not being able to get this fudge to set, and a lot of people going "It came out kind of grainy, but I guess pumpkin fudge just is that way!" (It isn't.) I think the issue is that different cans of pumpkin have different amounts of moisture, so following the recipe to the letter means that depending on how much moisture is in your particular can of pumpkin, you might overcook it or undercook it. Here is the way to get this fudge to come out right every time:

 
1. Make sure it reaches the soft ball stage. I don't even bother measuring the temperature or time, I just monitor it constantly to see when it gets to the soft ball stage.
 

2. Once this occurs, immediately take it off the heat.

 
3. When it says "beat the mixture until it thickens," DO THAT, even if it already looks pretty thick.
 

If you skip steps 1 or 3, your fudge won't set. If you keep cooking it past when it gets to the soft ball stage, it will be grainy. If you follow these steps, however--especially the one about getting it to the soft ball stage even if this means disregarding the exact letter of the recipe--you will get perfectly nice and appropriately fudge-textured fudge, without having to fall back on marshmallow creme or white chocolate to help it set.

This was my first time making fudge and the helpful suggestions in the reviews helped a lot.  The fudge came out perfect and had a nice flavor.  I still have about 12 pumpkins to cook up so I will make breads, pies, and fudge after Christmas.  This is a yummy way to use up that bit of pumpkin left over.

Wonderful creamy texture with an awesome flavor.  Worked very well the first time I tried this recipe.  I don't have heavy sauce pans so I use a cast iron skillet at my heat distributor.  It worked very well and only had a dime sized dark spot in the bottom of my pan.  It is a very good recipe.

They haven't quite set up yet but I tried the fudge left in the mixer bowl and it's really tasty!! If you follow the recipe it should turn out well for you. I took the advice of Baricat and mine didn't turn out very gritty, but as mentioned they aren't the smoothest consistency like you expect fudge to be. I definitely recommend using a candy thermometer. My poor little digital read meat thermometer  was somewhat useless because the heat affected the display so much. I didn't have the spices called for on hand so I used allspice and cinnamon and that worked fine for me. It really looks and smells like pumpkin pie!  Not giving this five stars ONLY because of the gritty texture. Definitely worth a try!

Creaminess was not lacking for me.  I did get some stuck to the bottom because it took way longer than I expected to reach soft ball stage.  I didn't bother to puree my cooked pumpkin and this fudge is really delicious.

I had a terrible time with this. I did EXACTLY like it said and it burned! It was at soft ball stage when I took it off and I added the rest of the ingredients, let it cool, changed pots before beating because of the burn. Beat it until I thought my arm would break. Put it in the pan and in frig. 8 hours later it is not set! Tastes great but won't set!

I have never made fudge before so it took me 3 tries to get it right.  But once I got the swing of it, the fudge turned out terrific and I got rave reviews from my family and friends.  The only thing I did differently is to add nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, and clove rather than pumpkin pie spice.  This will definately be a holiday tradition from now on.

I finally got the recipe to set after my 3rd attempt. Instead of boiling on medium until it reached 232 degrees F, I just kept boiling until I couuld drop it in cold water and form a soft ball, it was more like a held together mass. Almost missed being able to pour it into greased pan as when the thermometer was at 110 degrees F, mixture was already very thick.

I really wanted this to work!  I first tried pumpkin fudge in TN, and loved it.  My wife and I tried to make this recipe hoping that we would get an exact fudge, but we didn't.  We followed the directions exactly, even reading the reviews first to make sure we didn't miss something, or to get hints from others.  We first of all could not get this to "de-gloss" while stirring it nor could we ever get it to fully set up.  Once it was cold, it was still very soft, and had a terrible texture (very grainy), and I can't even say that it had a good flavor.

I can my own pumpkin butter (which has sugar and spices cooked in) so I altered this recipe to use it. What I did was I used about 3/4 cup of the pumpkin butter, reduced the sugar to about 2 1/2 cups, and of course omitted the spices.

The fudge took about 2 hours total to make - I just now poured it into the pan and it'll be set soon. I put the butter and vanilla into the pot ater taking it off of the heat and let the butter melt, then poured it all into a glass bowl for the cooling stage to avoid pieces of burnt candy winding up in the fudge - there was a burned layer on the bottom of the pot. Didn't affect anything. I stirred the melted butter and vanilla into the hot candy and stuck the candy thermometer back in. It took quite some time to cool - it stays warmer in the center than at the edge of the bowl so I made sure to wait until a point halfway from the center to the outside registered 110 degrees. It took less than 10 minutes of beating to get it to thicken and lose much of its gloss and I got it in the pan right away. The candy on the spoon as very good, not too sweet, and the real pumpkin butter I think made it even better.

This came out fantastic, the only problem I had was it scorching at the bottom due to me being impatient and jacking the heat up. I salvaged it by dumping it into a bowl leaving the burnt remains behind. I only beat it for about a minute or so and it came out perfect fudge texture, creamy and rich

Absolutely amazing flavor!!! I stirred when I shouldnt have and ended up with a pot of granules but it was soooo good! I mixed it with graham cracker crumbs and used it as the crust of a pumpkin swirl cheesecake. It was AWESOME! I will definitely keep this recipe forever!

I've tried this recipe a number of times and it turns out better and better the more I make it.

I made this recipe and followed the instructions for not stirring and waiting to beat until the mixture got to 110 deg.  However, the mixture was so liquidy that it didn't set at all.  I did add 1 cup of powdered sugar to see if it would salvage the batch and it turned out pretty good.  It is not as smooth as I would like, but it does have good flavor.  I added pecans rather than walnuts and it was a really good combination as well.  I will try this recipe again to see if it will turn out differently.

This was very good.  I stirred when I shouldn't have so it turned out grainy.  Will try again though and will try not to stir while boiling.

I absolutely loved this recipe, as did the other 12 people I made it for.  This was my first time making fudge, and it came out perfect.  I didn't even have a candy thermometer!  I only wish I made another batch!

Something really different. My husband,who doesn't care for fudge, really enjoyed this. We added 1 cup of nuts instead but still would of preferred more. Thank you for a new treat as part of our Thanksgiving dinner. And will be part of our Christmas.

This is a great recipe, but it is important to carefully follow the directions.  It is especially important to boil the mixture until your candy thermometer registers 232 F or the mixture will not get thick enough.
