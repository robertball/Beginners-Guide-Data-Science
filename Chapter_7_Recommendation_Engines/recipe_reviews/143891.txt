Yummy and easy-even the kids liked it, and they usually won't touch sweet potatoes. I stuck to the recipe, and everything went well.

Good Recipe! I've never had sweet potato fries before but have friends who rave about them, so I decided to try it. I used this recipe as a base and since i didn't have maple sugar on hand I added a few other ingredients based on my friends suggestions. I peeled the skin of the potatoes, then I cut the fries in 1/2" thick french fry slices. I seasoned the fries in a dry rub of cayenne pepper, salt, paprika, cinnamon, brown sugar, and olive oil. I baked them on a lighly oiled baking sheet and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on them during the last 5 minutes. These were very tasty and good. I will definitely be making them again. I can only imagine how the maple syrup would have tasted. I'm sure it would have really added a nice nutty caramel flavor to these wondrous treats.

Chips turned out very crispy and tasty.  Next time I'll use half the amount of salt, and I used olive oil instead of butter.  Instead of brushing the mixture on the chips, I shook the chips, oil & seasonings in a large baggie.  For those who complained the chips were soggy or burned:  First issue is that you have to slice these ridiculously thin - I used a chef's knife to do it.  You have to watch them like a hawk to avoid burning.  You have to turn them in the middle of cooking.  You need to remove the ones that are thinner & cooking faster as they get crisp/brown, and you need to run the final ones that aren't yet crips under the broiler.  I will make these again.  Oh - I would cook at least double to get enough chips to make it worth your while.

For some reason, I can't get sweet potatoes to come out of the oven like they do when deep fried... They always come out limp and not like fries or chips at all... they still taste good, but I am going to give up on the idea that they will be like french fries. The flavor of these was good, a little too spicy for my family though.

Quick and easy, tasty and different.  My kids thought they were a bit too spicy, so I'd cut back on the pepper next time.  My husband and I thought they were great. I'll make them again!

these were pretty good! i sprayed the foil pans with olive oil spray first so they wouldn't stick. i also reduced the time to 7 mins the first side and 6 mins the second side.  also i substituted cayenne pepper for fresh ground pepper and sprinkled the second side with sea salt. yum!

good flavors, i added a bit more maple syrup though and a dash of cinnamon. Don't expect it to be a crispy chip though, more of a soggy sweet potatoe.

Our family really loves sweet potatoes, but these chips were just too sweet.  We couldn't taste anything but the maple syrup, and so we give this an "average" rating.

Great easy, basic recipe.  I used a mandoline for uniform slices of scrubbed, skin on sweet potatoes. I mixed olive oil, sugar free maple syrup, cumin and cinnamon (because I do not like Cayenne) poured into plastice bag to coat potatoes, placed them on foil lined pan sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled top  with sea salt and after turning second side with pepermill pepper to taste. Resist the urge to grab and eat.  They crisp up better if left on tray for a few minutes. So good.

My family loved it!  My reluctant teenage son was soon eating them out of the serving dish like french fries.  After reading the reviews of soggy results I decided to cook the potatoes at 425 degrees convection for ten minutes each side. Also, I have read other sweet potato fry recipes  where adding corn starch to increase crispiness was recommended.  So I cut the potatoes, lightly sprinkled with corn starch and then tossed in a bowl.  I mixed the syrup, olive oil and cayenne pepper and a little sea salt in a separate small bowl. Then I poured this mixture over the potatoes and tossed with my hands until evenly coated. I put the sliced potatoes flat on a cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil and sprayed with Pam, then baked as above.  Easy clean up. All the original ingredients, just a slight change in the preparation and baking. They were delicious!  This will become a staple.  P.S.  I used a crinkle cutter to slice potatoes which I believe helped them to crisp up also.

I have been making what WE CALL "SWEET POTATO COOKIES" for years, but they don't need the olive oil or the maple syrup.  I just slice them, sprinkle them with salt and bake them.  They don't even stick to the cookie sheet.

Mine never got crisp. Maybe I cut them too thick but I did cut them 1/4" as it said. They didn't crisp so I returned them to the oven for a few minutes and burned them. The whole house smelled for 2 days. I just don't think I have the patience for this recipe. It's too time consuming.

Because of food sensitivities, I replaced cayenne and maple syrup with cinnamon.  I stirred the thin slices in the oil/sea salt/cinnamon mixture until coated, and then cooked as per the instructions.  

Yum!

Yum! Way better than plain fries.  I used Cajun seasoning instead of cayenne, and I also put under the broiler for a bit after the fries were baked... took out the mushiness.

OMG! I don't even like sweet potatoes! I get a weekly local organic produce delivery and sometimes I get stuff that I am not hugely fond of. This recipe has changed my opinion of sweet potatoes. I did omit the maple syrup as the potato itself is very sweet. I baked for a few extra minutes on either side and viola! My BF loved it to. A nice side dish to some stir fry veggies and quinoa.

Very good.  Instead of sweet potatoes I used yams.  I used a vegetable slicer and cut the yams very thin.  I followed the regular way on how to cook them.  I didn't put any cayenne pepper in the mix because I don't like things hot.

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a favorite go-to recipe when I'm looking for something simple, quick, and healthy. Even faster... you can just broil them. Same time to broil, but you don't have to wait as long for the oven to heat up. Skip the syrup to make them healthier...still taste fab!

How thin/thick you slice potatoes makes a difference. I experimented...too thin...burnt. Ones that turned out well were about 4mm...hope that helps

Excellent flavor, but mine did not come out at all crispy even though they were very brown and almost burned in places.  Not sure if I didn't bake them long enough or maybe didn't cut them thin enough, but I may try one more time.  Flavor was excellent.

I halved the cayenne and thought that was a good heat level; any hotter and it would have been too much.  I think those who enjoy their food spicy would be ok, but my hubby and I agreed that 1/8 tsp was good.

This is a great and easy recipe. I really liked the flavor of the olive oil and maple syrup together. My wife and children are not big on spicy so I used black pepper instead and it still tasted really good and full of flavor. I will say I couldn't get them crispy in the oven. I baked them much longer than the recipe calls for and even had to use the broiler which helped a little but I think the deep fryer is the only way to get that perfect crisp. I intend to do it like that next time.

I made three batches of these and nothing I did would make them crisp up. I am new to cooking sweet potatoes so maybe I was doing something wrong. We liked the flavor, so if I make again I will probably just dice and roast in the oven.

They were good, but not what I had expected. I thought they were going to be a lot "firmer" or "crunchier" than they turned out to be.

This recipe is SO simple I can remember it by heart. I love that it is fast, too. I hate waiting 30+ minutes for other oven fries recipes.  I happen to always keep REAL pure maple syrup in the house.I wouldn't try this with "fake" syrup, but I suppose it would still taste ok.  The combination of spicy and sweet is perfect!

Turned out great!  Cooking time was spot on for me.  For me, 1/4 tsp of cayenne didn't make it too spicy - in fact it was more sweet to me & I might add more cayenne next time.

Flavor was pretty good, the way to cook them was not.  Next time I will do half with the cayenne and half without (to please everyone). I definitely wont do the 1/4 inch slices either, next time I'll try it in french fry form.

Not bad. I don't think I cut the potatoes evenly because they weren't totally done... either that or it simply isn't enough cooking time. Another recipe I read is to cook at 400 for 40 minutes... that might be worth trying. Also, use REAL maple syrup - I tried Cary's and it didn't work so well.

Good wish I could have gotten them crispy though. Tried four times. Still good flavor and I did cut back on the red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon.

First of all, 450 degree oven is way too hot.  The maple syrup burns.  Second, in the time this recipe stated, you get overly blackened slices that doesn't even crisp up after they cooled.  I tried a second tray in a 400 degree oven with better results, but they were still too soggy to be called a chip.  I'm currently baking these in a 200 degree oven to dehydrate them and maybe, just maybe we can use them with a dip.  Flavor wise, they are pretty good.

It has a delicious flavor! They do have to be cut really thin to become crispy, but I'd even just dice the potatoes, throw on the sauce and bake it like that!

A nice, easy way to prepare sweet potatoes, but WAY too spicy.  I will eliminate the cayenne next time and simply add more salt and pepper along with the olive oil and maple syrup.

As the title says, these were definately sweet and spicy. A bit too sweet and too spicy for my taste buds. I used sour cream to calm down the spice. Next time I will probably half the syrup and cayenne. It was a nice combination of flavors but it was just a bit overwhelming to me. Will make again with adjustments. Oh, I also used my mandolin slicer to ensure even slices. Thanks

These were super easy and super yummy.  I made mine just for a quick snack and to use the rest of this ginormous sweet potato I had. I cut mine very thin so they were crispier and because of my sweet tooth, ended up wishing they were a tad less spicy.  Because of the spice though, I dipped them in ranch dressing (vegan for me) and they were delicious. I will FOR SURE make these again.

These were terrific! And if you're like me and hate the mess of turning them over, spray olive oil on a piece of tin foil lining the pan and bake. When ready to turn, place another piece of new tin foil over the fries, tuck the edges into the first foil wrapper temporarily, flip and remove the original sheet of foil then complete baking. Works great and easy to clean up!

These "Spicy Sweet Potato Chips" were fabulous! I left out the maple syrup because we don't like sweet food in our home. I can hardly wait to make these again! Next time I will be inclined to add a few more spices because we like spicy food in our home. Thanks JENNYWRITES for sharing your recipe!

I used half the amount of cayenne pepper which was enough for us.  The flavor was very good, however although I increased the baking time, it needed much more time.    I ended up putting it back in the oven and baking for an additional 20 minutes, turning them over once again until lightly browned.  I never quite got the consistency I was hoping for, but they were good.

Awesome!  I misjudged the amount of sweet potatoes in 3 large as I had one huge one.  I could have made double the amount of potatoes, but we both absolutely loved it.  They took longer that the time posted, but my oven is iffy so no big deal.  Will I make these again.  Yes!!!!  I did use sea salt instead of regular salt.  Enjoy

I used a mandolin to make nice even slices. I also brushed both sides of the sweet potatoes with the oil, maple syrup before they went in the oven. This made it easier and faster when I turned them. Some were soggy and some crispy, but they were great!

This is a good recipe! I didn't have any maple syrup so I used honey instead.

I got soggy chips and I left them in twice as long as called for.  These need to be sliced to an eighth of an inch if your going to get chips.  The spice level is good for me but too much for my wife.

Awesome recipe! I had to alter. I used honey in place of maple syrup and coconut oil in place of oil. These were sooo good! My husband and 13 yr old son loved them! Baked on a stone is the way to go! Baked 7 min. flipped and baked 6 min. Perfect!

Loved the idea but like others could not get them crisp without burning. I put on racks on top of the cookie sheet, turned several times during cooking time and that still didn't work.  Wonder if lower temperature for longer time would be better?

Though I like spicy foods, the cayenne didn't sound appetizing to me in this recipe. So I substituted cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and these turned out so scrumptious even my husband, who does not like sweet potatoes, enjoyed these chips. Super delicious and so easy to make!

What a wonderful recipe!
I truly enjoyed it. I used brown sugar, instead of the maple sugar and it turned out perfectly. 
Some of the chips came out a bit soggy while other came out crispy, but nonetheless all taste super yummy. :)

Loved these! Didn't have maple syrup, so I used pancake syrup. I can't imagine them tasting any better.  I cooked them a little longer than stated because I liked them crispy.  Will definitely make them again!

my family really liked this recipe.  i followed the recipe the way it was written except i used a stoneware bar pan from pampered chef so i basted the sweet potatoes on both sides prior to cooking and then cooked for 15 minutes.  no need to flip!!! :)  in addition to the recipe, i used my Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkles (also from Pampered Chef) on both sides of the potatoes!  YUMMY! :)

"Potato chips" is a lil deceiving because they are not chip like at all but they were ok. I may use the maple syrup/cayenne idea but cut them into fries next time.

Great recipe ...I liked the kick of Cayenne with the sweet. BY THE WAY...if you find that you've cut up all your sweet potatoes and discover you have no maple syrup as the recipe calls for... USE REGULAR pancake syrup like I did. (I also added cinnamon and nutmeg)

These are pretty good. After cooking  I threw them in the microwave for about a minute  to crisp up the soft centers. They will get crispier as they cool.

Need to experiment more with this. I used a mandolin slicer at 1/8 inch. If they were uneven slices they burn on the edge that was thin. The slices did not get chip-like but I think I brushed the oil mix on too thick and made them soggy. I want to slice them thicker and let them cook longer as they dry out from cooking and get thinner. This may allow me to cook long enough to get crisp.

I liked the flavor of these chips but they were too soggy.  I put them under the broiler after baking and they still were too soggy, so I left them in a 180-degree convention oven for 2 hours.  Huge disappointment, will not make them again.

I simply cannot give this recipe a 5 rating.  While they are spiced right, they were simply soggy and not crispy at all.  I followed the directions and baked them the posted length of time.  I wound up having to stick them under the broiler just to get them to be edible. I will not make again.

I followed the directions, and they were a soggy mess. I gave them more time in the oven. They didn't turn the color in the photo. They weren't crisp at all.

I love oven-baked "fries" (either sweet or white potatoes), either thinly sliced or in wedges. A suggestion for those whose potatoes stuck to the foil... Use Release, which has a nonstick side, and works very well. I'll be making this recipe when our really hot weather turns cooler.

The maple syrup gives it a hard candy type feel and there arent enough spices for it to actually be spicy. very dissapointed

LOVE these. I substituted half of the cayenne pepper for cinnamon and half of the olive oil for water.

Very tasty, though I avoided all but a pinch of cayenne because of the kids. A little too labor intensive for me and not enough bang for the buck. I think I'll try the EVOO and syrup combo next time I do baked sweet potato fries like I usually do them: cut into about 2.5 inch-long, 1/2-inch thick sticks. Husband and daughter prefer those to these.

Yummy! They had the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. I do wish they were a bit crispier, though.

Good, but not great, in my opinion.  A nice sweet/spicy flavour, nothing spectacular.  Might make again as a snack, but probably would cook sweet potatoes another way for guests.

Made some thin and some a little thicker . Those who ate this dish liked the thicker ones 1/2 inch . Also I barley used the hot spice , so that went over well w/kid . Which same kid asked for it to be sweeter next time . All went back for seconds . Thank You .

These are sooooo good!! amazing!! I crave these all the time! I leave out the cayenne pepper though, and I dip just one side in canolia oil and maple syrup and then top with salt and resturant ground pepper which i think really makes these! thanks for the recipe!

I love sweet potatoes. This was a nice recipe, it was a little too sweet for me but I really liked the idea of adding some heat!

Did not have enough flavor despite the fact I doubled the mixture.  Very bland.
