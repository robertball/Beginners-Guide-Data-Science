I would use butter just out of the refrigerator rather than melted.  It's much easier to get the crumbly topping.

I was pretty skeptical at first, but this recipe came out great, had it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Yum! The only reason I gave four stars instead of five was that I did expect a crumbly top, and I didn't exactly get one. I got more of a dough I had to spread across the top. But still try this recipe. Quick, easy and delicious!

I used apple pie filling and a chopped bananna.  Used refigerated butter instead of melted butter.

Used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Excellent.
