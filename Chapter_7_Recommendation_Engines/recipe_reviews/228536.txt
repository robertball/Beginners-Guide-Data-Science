These pumpkin seeds are delicious - loads of flavor!  I didn't bother to soak and they turned out fine.

This recipe was the worse one for pumpkin seeds that I've tried.  The flavor from both the garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce were soooo strong and seemed to fight each other.  I made them on Halloween (tradition) and instead of a treat I got a trick!  Maybe it's just my tastebuds but they were so bad I threw away all the seeds.  Next time I'll stick to my old favorite of toasted with butter and salt.  Sorry!

I tried these with four cups of fresh seeds that I soaked in water a few hours and drained and put in the fridge the night before.  Although I only added three teaspoons of salt, they turned out so super salty, I could barely eat them!  I like the Worcestershire sauce and garlic, but I will definitely add only one teaspoon of salt to the doubled recipe next time.  I added a bit of black pepper before baking and a bit of finely grated Parmesan cheese towards the end, which gave them good flavor.

We have always found that if you pick out the stringy pumpkin pieces, but NOT wash them, they have a lot more flavor, and taste better.  We have tried rinsing and not rinsing and hands down, much better results with NOT rinsing or soaking.

This always turns out well.  I never soak the seeds nor pat them dry.  I let them drain for a bit in the colander.  I spread the seeds on the baking sheet and pour the mixture on them. (One less dirty bowl).  I stir them and start baking. I take them out ever 15 minutes to taste and stir.  I just keep repeating until they are done, usually an 60 to 75 minutes.  I’m in SW Florida.  The baking time really depends on the weather.  If it’s 90 degrees and 100% humidity, they take longer.  I make these every year.

This is my 'go to' recipe for squash seeds. Spaghetti Squash grew like crazy this year. So the supply of seeds has not run out yet!

Amazing! I didn't want to roast pumpkin seeds because last year none of my kids wanted to eat them. However, my daughter was determined to try them again and cleaned the seeds so I pulled up this recipe. I made them exactly as written and my kids were fighting over them. Will definitely make again.

Favorite seed recipe!! I cut the salt by half-ish (more or less according to mood). After soaking in saltwater, my garden seeds take 30min to reach my preferred level of baking. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I love these but I made a few modifications. I soaked them in salted water as instructed, but when making the coating I only used 1 t. of salt and added about 1/2 t. of taco seasoning. Tastes amazing!

WOW, these are awesome! 
A few tweaks:
1. I added 1 tsp of white sugar to add some caramelization
2. Watch the time! *Mine were perfect after only 35min (tossing every 15min)*
3. Will be cutting the salt in 1/2 with my next batch but even so, these rocked!

Very tasty, however WAY too salty for my taste.  I will definitely make these again, but next time I will cut the salt by half.

I make these every year and they're always a huge hit.  I don't soak the seeds ahead of time, I just rinse them clean and pat them dry (or as dry as possible).  I usually end up using more butter than the recipe calls for, just because I don't usually bother measuring it.  And they often only take 45min and not the full hour, so make sure you keep an eye on them.
I've never seen anyone go nuts for pumpkin seeds the way people go for these.
