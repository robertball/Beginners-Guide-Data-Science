These were pretty good when I made them last year from the website, but a friend made them last week and they were FANTASTIC!  Her recipe is exactly the same EXCEPT she beat the leftover egg white until frothy, spread that froth over the top layer of crescent dough, and then mixed 1/2 cup chopped nuts with 1/4 cup sugar and sprinkled that on top.  The nuts really addto this (and also help to hide the seams if your dough doesn't cover completely as some reviewers stated).  I made them yesterday for a PTO meeting and got several requests for the recipe (with the nuts).  Great recipe!

If you like cheese danishes or even cheese cake, I think you'll love this. I had 1 package of Pillsbury French Croissants and 3/4 package of light cream cheese and figured I could adapt this recipe to the ingredients I had. It turned out great. I used an 8x8" square pan and trimmed the dough slightly to fit the pan. I used 1/2 an egg yolk and filled a half cup measuring cup to about 3/4 of the way with sugar. It was perfect. I wouldn't want the cream cheese layer to be any thicker. It took about 25 minutes to bake. They definitely tasted better once they cooled. I tried them about 2 hours after making them and they were still a little warm and the cream cheese didn't taste as good like that, so I refrigerated them overnight, and then took them out about an hour before serving. Fabulous. I can't wait to make them again so I can experiment by adding things like cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese layer and before the top dough layer. YUMMY.

My Mom has been making these for a long time, and I have since been coming up with ways to reinvent. They truly are wonderful. I omit the egg yolk because I think it tastes better without it.
My Number One suggestion is to wait for the bars to cool completely before cutting. You will get cleaner bars and no oozing. Love this recipe!

Try adding fresh blueberries or raspberries over the top of cream cheese mixture before adding the final crescent roll.  It makes it even more awesome!!

Very good.  I also cooked only 25 minutes since it browned quickly in my oven.  I also used the unused egg white and beat until frothy and spread over the top layer of creasant rolls before sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar.

This recipe is terrific... the only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars is that the cooking time needs a little adjusting - mine was still gooey, so I baked it for 15 minutes extra.  Also, I added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the cream cheese filling for some extra "zing".  I might try to cut down on the amount of butter next time too, but I will definately make it again (and again and again!!!).

This recipe is sooooo good.  I had a copy of this exact recipe years ago and lost it.  I am so thankful to find it again!! Every time I  made it people asked for the recipe. I can't wait to share with a whole new group of friends.  Thanks!

If there were a higher rating I would give it!  I did make a few changes to this though.  Followed the advice of TJTENNESSEE and covered the top crescent layer w/ the leftover egg white.  I also combined the 1/4C sugar, cinnamon and 1/4C chopped pecans and sprinkled over the top layer.  But, the most sensational change I made was baking it in my 9x13 deep stoneware baker.  It turned it into something totally delicious!  Bake for an additional 10 min., the top will be slightly jiggly but it is done.  The cream cheese is molten inside and will serve as a sauce for the pastry crust. Yummy!

Made these and my husband told me that I had been holding out on him for this great breakfast/dessert item.  I use 1 1/2 blocks of cream cheese tho to make a slightly thicker middle.  Use the full 1/2 cup of butter.

This was really good cold. I might try using the egg white on the top to glaze. Also I overcooked at 35 minutes. Next time I will go maybe 25.

I did not have high expectations of this dish...I was expecting it to be kind of bland and boring...however it was very delicious and did not last long...it's good warm eaten with a fork and it's just as good cold eaten as a bar.  My 12 year old ate half the pan when nobody was looking.  Will definitely keep this one.

I have made these bars many times and they are a hit each time.   However, I don't use the egg yolk because they are far too rich already. Also, I use whipped cream cheese because it is easier to spread. I also use Splenda instead of sugar.    For a variation, I sometimes add orange zest to the cream cheese and almond extract instead of vanilla.

I actually put the whole egg in and it turned out like a 'fluffy' cheesecake.  Was very good. I also added about 1 tsp of cardamon to the cream cheese filling.  And used brown sugar on the topping.  Will make again. Very easy and yummy!

These are amazing and so ridiculously simple.  My only problem was that I pulled the crescent rolls out of the fridge but then didn't actually get to them for almost 15 minutes.  I had a hard time unrolling them and keeping them from stretching too much.  I think they got a little warm.  In the future I'll leave them in the fridge until I'm ready for them.

This is a great recipe.  I have been making these for several years and the only thing I do different is omit the egg yolk.  For the top I mix a 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of melted butter and brush on top before baking .  My crew loves them!

I came here looking for this recipe because I lost my copy.  This is exactly like mine.  Super easy and delicious!  This time I will try it with the leftover egg white on top crust and nuts,cinnamon,and sugar on top.  It's so easy to keep these simple ingredients on hand for when you need a quick desert.  Yummy!

Yum. I halved this recipe (but used all the egg)and made it in a 9" round pan. These are guilty-great as is, but even better if you add lemon, lime or orange zest to the filling. I served mine with mangoes tonight, but they're fine - and addictive - on their own. Thanks!

YUMMY!!!!!!! I think I've made this three times in the last month. I'm addicted, and it's not good for my health (cream cheese, buttery crescent roll, sugar.... yikes!) These are wonderful. They taste just like a Danish, but way better than store bought. For Easter, today, I tried adding a swirl of preserves on the top, instead of the second layer of crescent roll. We'll see how they turn out. (P.S. I found an unscored can of cresent dough at the grocery store and it was much easier than the regular cresent dough. That helped)

This is one of my all time favorite desserts. It's so easy and so yummy. I like the finishing touch of melted butter and cinnamon/sugar on the top. It's best served slightly warm, but not too warm or the cream cheese oozes everywhere. If you like the flavor of cheesecake, but want a simpler, faster receipe, this is the one.

This is a really good and easy recipe.  I am the kitchen supervisor at a Christian School, and I make these for the kids every other month.  The first time I made them, students came up and asked for the recipe for their moms.  Would make them more, but they're quite calorie-packed.

These are delicious! A great dish to take to a pot luck if you don't want to deal with a whole cheese cake. I prefer them without the cinnamon sugar topping, but otherwise, this is a keeper!

This was awesome.  I made some revisions.  I added 1/2tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla and I took another reviewers advice and put a layer of cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese.  Dusted with powdered sugar.  So pretty!  Next time I will increase the cream cheese by another brick because that is the best.  Blueberry pie filling would be good too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is so yummy. I'm in the process of experimenting with it. Last night I made it and spread peach preserves on one half and strawberry preserves on the other half over the cream cheese. I had chocolate syrup available to add. It was a hit. I love anything with crescent rolls and can't wait to try some savory ingredients for my daughter to try.

I reduced sugar in the cream cheese and drizzled honey very lightly over topping when done.  Much too sweet for me and extremely rich.  Disappointed, as I was pretty excited over trying this easy recipe, but who would have thought "I" would find a dessert too sweet! (fudge lover that I am).  Maybe I'll try again someday without the honey and cutting back on the topping sugar.

Delicious! Very tasty dessert, especially when you're a non-baker like myself! I added brown sugar and chopped pecans to the topping. I think the nuts are a must. I also like the idea of adding a fruit to the top of the cream cheese layer. Either way, this is a wonderful treat!

I took these to work and people thought that I had bought them at a bakery.  Numerous people asked for the recipe.  I did use powdered sugar instead of granulated.  Also, I found that it's easiest to forget about trying to seal up the seams of the cresent rolls into one big bar.  Instead, I just keep them in their triangular shape, baking them each as a seperate trianular bar.  Also, I liked best when left in the fridge overnight.

We make this quite a bit but we pour a stick of melted margerine over the top layer of crescent rolls before sprinkling the cinnamon/sugar.  It crispens the top (and whats a few more calories)

I did not think these were that wonderful, but my co-workers are raving about how yummy they are.  I made them last night, refrigerated them overnight, and brought them in this morning.  They were pretty easy.  The hardest part was trying to get the top layer on over the cream cheese mixture.

These are more addictive than good.  Don't get me wrong.. they are good.. but I have found I can't eat just one.  I forgot the recipe at work and made the cream cheese mixture with 2 tablespoons of butter instead of the egg (oops).  I also used 3/4 cup of sugar. I felt it was missing a little something and added a couple of drops of almond extract.  Everyone at work really liked them.  Next time I may garnish the bars with some powered sugar and/or fruit.

When I made these, the cream cheese mixture didn't set so when you bite into a bar, the two crescent roll "crusts" mush together and squeeze all the cream cheese mixture out the sides.  I really wanted to like these, but it just didn't do it for me.

Although easy to make, I'll bake these at 25 min instead of 30-35... as my bars came out very very well done! I tried one and it's not too bad....I think it'll be better once I let it cool down. Thanks for posting Andrea!

These are wonderful! I made multiple batches for a large party. I made a strwberry coulis and a chocolate sauce to drizzle over each piece. They were a HUGE hit! Everyone thought they were lots of work. I will make these again!

Wow!  I was in the mood to make something that didn't take long and would satisfy my urge for something cookie-ish. These are SO easy and FAST. I marked my printed copy of the recipe "To Die For Good"

Definitely a favorite to have around for just about any occasion!  Very easy to make, and even easier to serve and eat.  Everytime that I make these, everyone begs for the recipe.  I am almost too embarrased to let them see just how easy they are to make!!

This was really good although a bit rich. Mine didn't come out nearly as attractive as the picture featured on the recipe page either.  Not sure how the crescent dough was flattened out and made to look so neat and tidy. Maybe some direction in the recipe itself might have helped. Nevertheless they tasted great but I probably won't make them a lot since they are so extremely fattening.

Tasty recipe especially if you're a daish lover, like me!  I added an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple (drained) to the cream cheese filling for added flavor.  I imagine you could put other ingredients like nuts or chocolate instead for a crunchy or sweeter filling.  I will make this one again for sure!  Thanks for the idea!!

I have made these many times and I also like to change the recipe a bit.  I like to use almond instead of vanilla sometimes and also strawberry jam over the cream cheese mixture.  I've also used peach preserves, apricot jam, and raspberry jam.  I get asked for this recipe anytime I bring it somewhere and everyone is always surprised how easy it is.

Huge hit at the Christmas dinner! I only used one package of cream cheese,used steevia instead of sugar(for the filling) then added one can of blueberry pie filling! Oh yeah! That was awesome! But for the top..since I didn't think cinnamon and blueberry would compliment each other well I added the butter and sugar only, which tasted fine.Should mention I served these cold.Thanks again for the recipe!

My mother-in-law made this & it was wonderful!  When I tried, the filling didn't set for me either.  She said I needed to use the block cream cheese instead of the tub.  I haven't tried again, but that could be what caused other subscribers to have the same problem.

HEAVEN! These were too darn good for such an easy recipe. I didn't have any vanilla so I subbed 1/4 tsp. almond extract instead and it worked really well. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!!

Sheer perfection and so easy. People can't believe it's made from crescent rolls!

After reading all the great reviews, I was quite disappointed with this recipe.  My cream cheese filling never set, and it turned the inside of the crescent dough gooey.  I may try this again to see if I can get a better result.

This recipe was just great.  Thanks for sharing it.  I would give it more stars if I could.  After trying this, I will never make cheesecake again.  I plan on making this many more times, although for the filling I may use a tad less sugar from now on.  Once again, really a great recipe.

Great way to get rid of that pesky last package of Crescent Roll dough.  I made two separate "rolls" becuase my pan was too small, and I was way more generous with the filling on the second batch.  I also poured the extra filling over the top, instead of just sugar/cinnamon.  The second batch was MUCH better.  The first was pretty dry.  I would recommend NOT preparing ahead of time, as the dough gets hard pretty quickly.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

My 6 year old loves cheesecake, so I often seek out cream cheese recipes.  He loved this one, and I couldn't believe how easy it was.  He didn't want to wait for it to cool and set up, so I cut it open and it oozed out.  He mopped the gooey mess up and said he loved it, so this is a good one!

I had to make something quick.  I had cream cheese and crescent rolls handy in the fridge.  I typed the ingredients in on allrecipies.com and foung cream cheese bars II.  They were a big hit!  Family and friends are often calling for the recipe.
