My grandmother used a recipe similar to this.  She substituted two Tablespoons of lemon juice for 2 T. of water and then drizzled a lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze on top of it.  Yummy.

Surprisingly enough with the lemon cake mix and lemon pudding, this cake did not have the lemon flavor I was looking for nor was it dense like pound cake. It was okay, nothing special, and I probably won't make it again.

I do not like lemon anything..any way, any shape, any form.  Until I tasted this cake. I needed something in a hurry for a group of veterans and decided this would be different.  When everyone went nuts over it, I decided to take just a bite.  Needless to say it has become a favorite.  I did use only 2 eggs, and just dusted it with sifted powder sugar.  Very refreshing cake.  Just plain good.

This is the Duncan Hines pound cake recipe I have been using for years.  Try adding a tub of lemon icing in the bottom of a bundt pan and then pouring your cake batter on top of that.  Then when it's done, let it cool and drizzle lemon topping.  Talk about a treat!

Another wonderful cake that starts life in a box...  I did change this recipe a little as I only had Vanilla Instant pudding mix, and was worried by using this I would not have much of a lemon flavor.  I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest and also a teaspoon of lemon extract.  As always I used applesauce in place of the oil.  Baked for 60 minutes and the cake was cooked to perfection.  I just loved the moist lemon taste, great recipe that you can throw together in a few minutes.  No once would honestly think this came out of a box!!!

I was pleasantly surprised by this cake.  Added lemon zest the second time around for added lemon flavor.  Had a co-worker tell me it tasted like her grandmother's pound cake.  Not too heavy, not too light. Satisfying and extremely easy, not to mention quick.

I topped this with an orange juice / confectioners sugar glaze, and filled the center of the cake with fresh blackberries and raspberries.  Delicious!

I was trying to duplicate an incredibly moist lemon cake I had gotten at a bake sale, but this one was pretty mediocre - not much different than making the lemon cake mix as directed.

Wow!!!! I used the tip on removing 2 tbsp of water and replacing it with 2 tbsp of lemon juice and put a powder sugar/milk glaze on it and it's now the family favorite! Thank you for sharing!

This is the exact recipe from the side of the Duncan Hines lemon cake mix box, which is good.

To kick it up a notch and make it more like a true pound cake, substitute the water for milk.  Even skim milk is fine.  I also add the zest of a lemon to the batter when I've got one in the house.

I dust mine with powdered sugar after it has cooled.  Quick, easy, inexpensive, pretty, and people like it.

I have tried recipes with cake mixes before.  They are easy and usually pretty good, but this cake was just so, so.  It did taste good, but it was nothing special, and I probably won't make it again.

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday yesterday and it was well liked by everyone.  I made as directed and then put a little glaze on it, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  I garnished the serving dish with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and thin lemon slices.

In my opinion, this is more of just a dense cake as opposed to a traditional pound cake, but that does not detract from the deliciousness of this recipe!  :)

This was an extremely moist and easy cake to make.  I added some lemon extract for extra flavor.  Not as dense as a typical pound cake but wonderful anyway.

I really liked this cake, but my 14yr old son loved it. Very lemony and moist.  I think I'll try a lemon glaze over it next time

This cake was very good but the icing I made was horrible!  That was my fault though.  Will definitely make again and search for a good icing!

easy, quick and moist for a box cake mix. I took a slight modifcation and made cupcakes instead of a bundt cake in a pan as I did not have a bundt pan handy. Very easy and quick to put together the ingredients. I baked for 22 minutes and ended up 18 cupcakes. As for the lemony flavor, I think if I had added a little lemon zest and/or lemon extract to the batter to give it a more lemony flavor it would have made it to a 5 stars. I might also add a dust of powdered sugar to the top or a lemon glaze next time.

 I added juice and zest of one lemon and added to the water to measure 1 cup. Also added 1-1/2 tea. lemon extract.

I would give this recpe 5 stars for taste and how well it was received by family and friends, but we all agree this is not a pound cake so we all were expecting something else, but it is still very good and easy to make.

Easy delicious recipe. Everyone at the dish to pass just loved it especially the lemon fans. I will definitely make again but will add a bit of lemon zest and replace some of the water with lemon juice just to zip up the lemonyness a bit. If you don't have a bundt pan it makes 2 nice bread pan sized loaves baked for same amount of time and temp.

If it doesn't have enough lemon flavor, there are so many simple things you can do to enhance it.  I substitute 2 tsp. of water for 2 tsp. of lemon extract.  I bake mine in two 9x5 loaf pans. (35 minutes @ 350).  Make a glaze of powdered sugar, a little veg. oil and ReaLemon lemon juice to the consistency you like.

Hmmm, I feel like I was mislead.  I was looking to make a lemon POUND CAKE, and this isn't even close.  It actually turned out to be one of the lighter, fluffier cakes I've made.  If I'm ever looking for a delicious lemon cake recipe I will definitely make this again, but I guess I'm back on the hunt for a REAL lemon pound cake recipe!

This cake was fantastic! I had no pudding but the cake mix said it had 1 cup of pudding already in it, so that's what I used. I will make this again!

Too light to be called a pound cake.  More like a Quarter Pound Cake.  Nothing really spectacular about this recipe, it's just a regular cake mix lemon cake.  Not sure why I expected more.

This was a good recipes.....but still tasted like I used a box mix.  Next time, I may add some lemon vest...to give it a "real lemon" taste.

I have never made, nor have I ever had Lemon Pound cake.  Therefore, I don't have much to compare it to except that it was delicious and easy to make. I did take a previous reviewer's suggestion of adding 2 tsp of lemon juice. I also used a lemon cake mix without pudding in the mix as someone else suggested.  Duncan Hines was the only lemon cake mix I found that did not have pudding the mix and was 18.25 oz.

Made this pound cake and it was delicious!  Will be making this again and again. I drizzled icing over it.  Served it to guests who really liked it too! I even sent some home with my guests that's how much they liked it.

It was good but not really any different than preparing the mix the traditional way. It wasn't dense like a pound cake, just regular cake density. I will keep looking for a lemon pound cake that uses cake mix as a base

Easy to make, and delicious!  I read the reviews before trying the recipe, and so I subsituted 2T of lemon juice for 2T of the water.  I topped the cake with a simple glaze that I made from lemon juice and confectioner's sugar, and put sliced strawberries in the center for presentation - they add a great flavor along with the cake too!  I will use this recipe over and over again!

We loved this cake. I did not get fancy with frosting. I used the Poor Man's Frosting recipe from this site. 
This cake was moist and delicious! We give it 5 stars! This will be added to our favorite's list. Thanks for sharing.

The only reason why this is getting a four instead of a five is because I didn't think that the cake was not dense enough to be labeled as a pound cake, however, the cake was moist, lemon tasting without being tart, and overall very good.

Very moist and great flavor. I added a coulple Tbsp of lemon juice to the water. The lemon was not overbearing nor bland, just perfect. I put a glaze made out of powder sugar and lemon juice on the cake while it was still warm. Very easy directions to follow, my nine year old son made most of it!

I think this is the Duncan Hines recipe found on their Lemon Cake box and on their website. It makes a moist pound cake but it's not dense like a traditional old fashioned pound cake. However, it is not as light as a cake. I like it with a lemon glaze made from thinned ( microwaved until warm) lemon frosting. Adding lemon zest gives both the cake and the glaze a lemon zing. But the recipe is yummy as is.

I loved this recipe, but put my own spin on it after reading reviews that it wasn't really lemony.  I did 1/3 cup of lemon juice and 2/3 cup of water to enhance the flavor in the cake and used lemon juice instead of water in the icing. It was so moist and just the right flavor I was looking for.

This is not pound cake. It's just lemon cake with pudding mix. If you're looking for lemon cake, it's good enough. But, it's not pound cake.

The cake was moist and light.  It needs some lemon juice and lemon zest in the batter and a lemon glaze on top to bump up the lemon flavor.

I was so excited to find this simple recipe that had great reviews.
I am not very good at baking. With that being said. I made this cake with a few sub, not sure what I did wrong but the kake came out of the oven beautiful I was o happy I thought I would let it cool over night and then glaze it.

 In the morning I noticed the cake was half the size, I turned it out and cut a slice. as I suspected top layer was cooked bottom was almost cooked but it fell.  
I wanted an extra moist cake so I subd a few items. Betty crocker cake mix with pudding in it. added one more pudding, 4 eggs, 1.5 cup of buttermilk, .333 cups of butter, lemon zest and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I did not have a bundt pan so I used a square 8 in pan.
Please let me know where I went wrong. thank you to any one who sets me straight about "baking".

This is a good recipe for anytime. I used other reviewers advice and added lemon zest, used three eggs and milk instead of water, 2 T. Lemon.  I drizzled it with a lemon glaze(3/4 cup powdered sugar 1/4 fresh lemon juice).  I made two bunts in 9" glass the first time and cupcakes the next. Very good. I will make again and maybe will add poppy seeds to some.

Great base but I did make two changes to give it a bigger lemon WOW flavor. For the cake, I cut the eggs down to 3. The other change was to make a lemon glaze. I mixed 1 cup powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon. Add milk if needed to get drizzle-able glaze. Pour onto cooled cake. This is the PERFECT go-to for a lemon dessert craving.

Made this last night. I took another reviewer's advice and used milk instead of the water. I added two teaspoons of lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I made a glaze of orange juice, a bit of lemon juice and confectioners sugar. This is a great cake! It isn't quite the texture of a pound cake, but who cares when it tastes fabulous! It's fluffy and moist and there was the perfect lemon flavor to it without being overpowering. I think this will also make really great cupcakes, so next time I'll try that. Hubby says be sure to keep this recipe. I agree! Thanks for sharing it!

A friend of mine gave me a recipe similar to this years ago.  I thought that the one I had called for yogurt.  However, this was just as moist as I remember the pound cake being.  I use a yellow cake mix, lemon pudding, and juiced one lemon, which I put in the measuring cup and added the water to in order to fill one cup and not go over.  I loved it.  My children thought it was just a bit too sour.  We made a glaze from lemon juice and confection sugar.

Mmmmm my error made it a true pound cake, even after I added cook n serve pudding by mistake this came out beautiful! I used 1/2 C of half n half, 1/2 C milk, 3 eggs, 1/3 Veg oil, 4 Tablespoons of Minute Maid lemon juice (the frozen bottle),  when I realized I used the cook n serve pudding I added another tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 Tablespoon of water, 4 Tablespoons of Flour, 1/16 (a pinch) teaspoon of baking soda and 1/16  teaspoon of baking powder. The batter came out thick, the result was a more dense pound cake, I made a medium glaze drizzle using about 1/2 container of cream cheese icing and added 4 Tablespoons of Lemon juice. It still turned out great, with my error using cook n serve pudding I thought it may not rise but it did! I should have added more milk or water rather than flour. If you make the same mistake I did, change the amount of water or milk to 1 1/4 Cup and forget the additions I made. 4 slices are gone already! would be heaven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream

Used to love this recipe- great for taking on picnic (Busy working mother of four). However the mix is now 16.5 ounces and now the cake is small, flat, gooey.... so One star.

I agree with JillyBean . Take the cake out of the mould before putting on the glaze. Mine stuck to the pan and only part came out . It tasted  great and I will make this recipe again .

Super moist and lemony. I used lemon icing with a little lemon zest garnish and it was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This cake was good, but I really didn't think there was anything super special about it.  Followed the recipe to a tee.
