I made this tonight.  I would make it again with a few changes.  It was a great quick meal.  The only problem I had was with putting the Tex Mex cheese at the end.  The cheese just wasn't melting so I ended up having to mix it in.  Then it was a little too cheesey.  Next time I would leave out the cheese on top.  Or put it in the oven to melt the cheese on top.  Otherwise it was good and quick.

This dish was YUM!  Tastes very rich, but low in calories, esp. if you rinse the beef w/hot water after browning.  I like a little more beef & salsa, & add 1C chopped onion mixed in.

I used leftover macaroni & cheese.  Made the taco meat--spread the noodles in a non stick pan and topped it with the ground beef/salsa mixture.  20 minutes at 350 and then sprinkled the cheese and onion and into the oven for another 5.  Everyone loved it....thanks!

This was really good but I didn't actually make it as is. I altered the recipe with what I had in the house. I didn't have tex mex shredded cheese, just regular marble. So I looked up what seasonings are in tex mex and added them to the meat while it cooked. I didn't have Salsa so I added Ketchup. I only had regular mac and cheese. Sorry I don't know how much ketchup or seasonings I added as I made it up as I went along, tasting along the way.  I'd like to make it correctly next time to see which version I like best.

This was real good and easy. Only change I made was I didn't use premade mac & cheese because we don't like it so I used plain macaroni, 1 can cheddar cheese soup and an extra cup shredded cheddar mixed in.  I think it really depends on the kind of salsa you use.  I happened to have a very tasty sweet corn salsa that was delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Made this for my mom, stepdad and I and it was quite a hit. Substituted the corn with pees (stepdad isn't a fan of corn) and saut√©ed the meat with the onions after draining it instead of putting them raw on top at the end. Quick and easy, would definitely make it again.

I made this tonight... I added the red pepper and green onion while browning the meat, as well as the corn at the end...instead of substituting.
The kids love it! I'm about to try. :)

This has been a household staple meal for a couple of years now. I do not use the corn, we like it without. I like that it's easily adjustable by the salsa you put in. Other than that, I make it just the way it is.
