I have used this recipe several times.  The latest time, I made it for a work pot luck. I used a 30 oz bag of Oreda shredded hash browns, defrosted and mixed them with melted butter then pressed it into the bottom and sides of 9x13 pan.  I baked it for 25+ minutes til  edges were a bit brown.  I refrigerated the crust overnight.  Since you can use any filling, I used about 1 
1/2 cups cooked sausage instead of ham plus lots of monterey jack cheese.  I used 6 eggs and about 1 1/2-2 cups of half and half.  I poured that in the next morning and baked 30 mins.  Next time I might add some green onions with sausage.  Ham was good when I used it before but sausage went over well.  Just depends on your preference.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!  EVERYBODY LOVED IT AND IT WAS SO EASY.  I USED SIMPLY POTATO SHREDDED HASH BROWNS INSTEAD OF THE FROZEN ONES, WHICH ELIMINATED EXTRACTING THE WATER FROM THE FROZEN AND SPEEDED THINGS UP EVEN MORE.  I ALSO SUBSTITUTED HALF & HALF FOR THE HEAVY CREAM.  WHAT I LIKED MOST ABOUT THE RECIPE IS THERE ARE ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES TO PERSONALIZE IT TO YOUR TASTES.

This is the best egg dish I have ever made.  I used milk instead of cream and bacon rather than the ham and two additional egg whites.  I plan to add this to the "standard meals list" for the week.  Thank you, Kathy!

It tastes good, so no problem there. 
However, I'm giving it 3 stars because the amounts in this recipe are way off. For example, I was using a 10-inch glass pie pan, and when I dumped the 24 oz. of potatoes in a bowl, I was like, there is no way that 24 oz. of potatoes will even fit in this pie pan. I used 10 oz. potatoes. Also, there is not quite enough custard to even come up to the top of the 10 oz. of potatoes. So for this recipe, I recommend using 10 oz. of potatoes, 3/4 c. whipping cream, 3 eggs, and maybe 1 1/4 c. grated cheese. This filled my 10-inch glass pie pan. If this is all you're eating for breakfast, you'd probably eat 1/3 or 1/2 the pie per person for breakfast.

You really need to get all of the excess moisture out of the hashbrowns first.  I suggest squeezing them between papertowels.  I also would recommend cooking the potato mixture longer, 10-15 minutes longer, because it's better crisper.  Everyone loves this recipe and I've made it at least 5 times.  Great brunch item!

This is a very good recipe as is. Since I do not like frozen hashbrowns, I substituted parboiled grated potatoes, increased eggs to 5 and cream to 3/4 cup, and added a teaspoon of grey poupon mustard and minced green onions. These additions added a little more flavor to the egg mixture. Thanks for sharing, Kathy!

After reading reviews, I tried and was very surprised. I did not add more eggs,
 but did use skim milk(diet reasons), cheddar cheese, fresh parsley, and baked
 the crust alone for more than 30 minutes. My hubby who really will only tolerate
dishes like this loved it and we ate the whole thing. My kids were not as enthusatic
but don't let that stop you. Very tasty and a great change of pace from regular
dinner fare.

very good for breakfast.  i split the recipe into two separate pie plates and added lots of sauted onion to one - that way both the kids and the grownups were happy.  i also added two extra eggs to the recipe.

I had some sausage that I bought on sale that I used in this recipe instead of diced ham. I also used evaporated milk instead of whipping cream because I don't usually have whipping cream on hand. I did add a little oomph to the eggs/milk mixture (pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, little Frank's hot sauce). This was surprizingly good. I was worried that the crust would be mushy in texture but it really wasn't bad. Next time, I'd throw in another egg and some extras, like sauteed red pepper, onion and garlic. I'd make this again.

We really liked this recipe. I also added extra eggs-3 extra eggs. I think next time I will try it with cheddar cheese instead of the jack cheese. Also maybe try it with bacon or sausage instead of ham-one of my kids doesn't like ham.
Thanks for the great recipe.

This is an easy and delicious breakfast/brunch main course.  I used 1 20 oz bag of hash browns from the refrig section of the grocery store, and used 1/4 C melted butter and also sprayed the potatos with my olive oil spray (just to cut down on the butter).  You can obviously substitute any meat/cheese you like - I used canadian bacon and sharp cheddar cheese and fresh snipped  chives. You may want to add some additional spices to the egg/milk mixture, whatever you like in your eggs. I will definitely put this on my B&B breakfast rotation, my guests loved it!

Pretty blah tasting, what with no salt, pepper, or anything added???  I did saute fresh mushrooms and onions and then added the chopped up leftover honey ham.  Used 2 real eggs and 2 eggs worth of Egg Beaters and about 1/2 cup of 2% mixed mexican cheese.  I thought just 2 eggs for all those hashbrowns would have been not enough.  I used skim milk instead of the cream also.  Next time I would really salt and pepper the hashbrowns before the first bake and also add a bit to the egg mixture before pouring over the ham.  Like I said, the idea of the recipe is great, just needs a lot more flavor.

This was a hit for Easter brunch!  My mom even said, "I think this is the best casserole I've ever had." I took the suggestions from many other reviews.  I used a large casserole dish, so I did 30 oz of shredded hash browns (fresh, not frozen) mixed with a stick of butter.  I cooked this the day before and refrigerated it overnight.  For the filling, I used a pound of bulk sausage that I cooked the day before. On Easter morning, I mixed it with 6 eggs, 1.5 cups of half-and-half, green onions, 2 cups of shredded jack cheese, and about 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I cooked it for 30 mins, but probably could've cooked for a little longer.  It was very good, but parts were a little runny.  I'll definitely do again as soon as I can!

Made this for Christmas morning. I premade the crust and then added everything else in the morning. I did add about 3/4 cup of cooked, chopped bacon. It added a nice touch. Everything turned out beautiful! My son who doesn't like cheese even loved it! Will definetely make it again.

Very good - although it didn't really feel like "quiche" to me...more like a breakfast casserole BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD! I used "MMorris73" advice: cooked in a 9x12 baking dish and upped the eggs to 4. Also, used half & Half instead of heavy whipping cream and added some minced green onion and red bell peppers for color and taste. Overall - a handsomly good meal that we all enjoyed! In this case - change is good!! Thanks Kathy!

This was actually really good.  I took a few suggestions from others...made in a 9x13 pan with a 32(?) ounce bag of hashbrowns.  Mixed them with the butter, pressed them into the pan, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked until they were nicely browned.  Used 6 eggs, cheddar and jack cheese, and served to a happy family.

GREAT starter recipe. I've used a variation of this recipe at least a dozen times. The main change to make is to INCREASE the eggs. 2 is not enough. I use 6. Otherwise, it is just your preferences....I use a 9x13 pan, milk in lieu of cream, and only about 1/4 cup of butter. Play around with veggies, sausage, etc. to suit your taste. I really enjoy this recipe and have gotten numerous compliments on it.

I agree with others, some of the ingredient amounts are way off.  I used Simply Potatoes which worked well and saved the step of defrosting the hashbrowns and water extraction.  I ended up doubling the cheese, eggs, and cream.  Also there were no seasonings in the recipe, so I added salt, pepper, paprika, and a dash of nutmeg.  The best part is really the hashbrown crust.  Gluten free!!

This was absoutly AMAZING!! My husband even took seconds!  I used some of the suggestions from other reviews, and used a 9x13" pan and 6 eggs, and upped the 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream to 1 cup.  Next time I think I will add onion and green or red peppers for more flavor and color, and I will cook the shredded hashbrowns until they are a little more browned (for the base layer) for a little crunch of the crust.
Really good and easy to make, I will be making this again!

Very good! I will make this again. Although when I poured the eggs and cream in, it didn't look like it would be enough, so I added another two eggs and more cream. Well... it swells while it bakes, so there was a TON of egg in mine! But still good. Next time I will trust that the 2 eggs are enough and make it that way!

This was quite good...made for my boys to use up some whipping cream I had on hand from New Year's.  I didn't have the hash browns so diced a few potatoes and cooked them a bit before assembling everything.  I also used some turkey bacon and increased the eggs to 4 as 2 does not seem like much for this dish.  Easy, one dish meal, great served with a salad or some veggies!

Very good. Did use shredded raw potatoes (well drained) rather than frozen hash browns, and milk because I was out of cream. Thank-you!

very good!  I used a 9x12 baking dish instead and added 2 more eggs.  I also used a "mexican" cheese mix and it turned out just fine.  Next time I'll try it with milk, since I don't keep cream on hand.

I made this recipe for supper with some changes.  I didn't have hash browns so I cut up a pkg of curly fries.  I reduced the butter and baked the fries for 25 minutes.  I cooked it in a 9X12 pan and used 6 eggs with 1 cup of table cream, also added chopped green onions and doubled the cheese (cheddar).  Baked for 20 minutes.  This was a hit with my family and I will cook this again.

I used less hash browns than the recipe called for because the pie plate I used seemed too small.  The quiche turned out great anyway, and the kids asked for seconds!

It takes a whole lot of chutzpah to make major changes in a recipe, & then give it only 3 stars! In recipes like this, I always use quality pre-cooked hash brown patties, which eliminates step #3, saving 25 minutes of cooking time & the need for butter.

I made many alterations but it came out great!  I melted 1/4c of butter in a frying pan and cooked a chopped up onion.  I mixed it with one 20 oz bag of southern hash browns once the onion was cooked to my liking.  I sprayed a 9x13 pan with Pam and put the butter, onion, hash brown mixture in the bottom of it.  I did cook the hash browns in the oven longer than 25 minutes as I watched till it browned.  I did not have diced ham so I cooked about 8 pieces of bacon (cooked it a little less than I would cook it if I was to serve it immediately) while the hash browns browned.  Meanwhile I mixed 6 eggs with about 3/4 c of fat free half and half in a bowl.  Once the hash brows were browned I took them out of the oven and put pieces of bacon all over it.  I did not have shredded cheese so I used lengthwise pieces of American cheese all over the and bacon.  I then poured the egg cream mixture over and cooked it till it was browned again, about 25 minutes. mmmmmmmm delicious

I've made this countless times and it is always a homerun!  I followed another reviewers suggestion to use Simply Potatoes, but I used the Southwest Style Simply Potatoes which have more kick. YUM!  When I couldn't find the Southwest Style in the store I made it with regular Simply Potatoes.  It was okay but I'll never use regular again if Southwest Style can be found.  Seriously YUM!

Really good.  Following someone's review, I did not use frozen hash browns, but used the 20 oz bag of Simply Potatoes hash browns from the dairy aisle. No worrying about squeezing out excess water.  Also mixed some Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning in with the potatoes.  Delicious!

Yum, yum, yum!  I think I have made this at least 20 times and finally got back here to say thank you for a great recipe!  I do as the others suggest and use six eggs and a cup of milk.  I use the regular frozen hashbrown cubes and have never precooked them... the crust is always nice!  I've used this recipe with ham and bacon (pre-cooking the bacon first) and added both onions and green onions at different times.  I've also used marble cheese and Velvetta.  It's delicious with any combination!  I usually make it for dinner and re-heat it for breakfast (if there's actually any left!!)... it re-heats fabulously!
Thanks again for a great recipe!

Great recipe. I made it for my husband and visiting in-laws and they gobbled it all up immediately. I used fresh grated potatoes instead of frozen, as well as ham lunchmeat instead of leftovers. Adding a little salt and pepper to the potatoes gave the dish a little more flavor. Also, I used four eggs instead of two - made it more fluffy (a definite for egg lovers!). Wonderful recipe. Thanks to the "chef" for sharing.

I gave this recipe 4 stars based on it's appeal and functionality. This is a very versatile dish in itself...I used 4 fresh grated potatoes, raw, sweezed as much of the moisture out as I could. Thinking it would make for a crispier crust, I melted a whole stick of butter (ya, I know, shame on me!!) added salt and pepper, added that to the potatoes and pressed into the pan. Cooked 25 minutes, still wasnt crispy on the bottom but did not want to over cook them so I added the mix of 6 eggs, 1 c. or so ham, 3/4 c 2%milk (eyeballed), 1 cup of triple cheddar cheese, a tblspoon of sour cream for added flavor, and salt and pepper into the hot crust. Added another cup of cheese on top. Baked about 25 minutes, let sit in oven another 5 or so and it came out divine!! :) Looked as appealing as it tasted as well!! :) Family of somewhat picky eaters were pleased and so is this mom! Thanks for the great recipe! I was planning on making ham and cheese omeletes with hashbrowns and this recipe saved me enough cleaning time tonight to review this recipe! Thanks!!!!

I made this exactly how it was written except I used about 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion  and made my own hash browns by baking and shredding the potatoes. While tasty, I think it would be vastly improved with some changes. First of all, there's way too much butter in the crust. A few tablespoons would work just as well without being so greasy. Also, the times are off. I baked my crust for 20 mins instead of 25 and the edges we nicely browned. When I added the remaining ingredients and threw it back in the oven, the crust nearly burned and I only put it back in for like 23 mins (not the full 30). Definitely use more eggs than called for. Next time, I think I will use four. This is a good recipe as it is but would be a great recipe with some modifications.

This was my first time making this recipe.  (1) 24 ounces is too much, otherwise the title of the recipe should be "potato quiche." 10 ounces is enough potato for it to adequately cover the bottom of a 9'' pie pan while still leaving room for the remaining ingredients. (2) I followed the times provided, but it cooked faster than I anticipated. I wanted the top of my quiche to be lighter than a dark golden brown.  (3) The directions omitted any addition of spices or salt, but I added 1/4 tsp of salt. Verdict: It was creamy, cheesy, and good quiche. Next time, I would like to cook the potatos longer to get a crispier crust perhaps add cilantro or green onions to jazz it up.

Loved it! This really isn't a quiche in the since that it doesn't have a crust, but the casserole that this recipe creates is great to make with holiday leftovers; those potatoes you didn't use, and the leftover ham are easy to throw together for an after holiday breakfast.  I shredded a potato and it worked just as good as packaged potatoes. Also I didn't have heavy whipping cream. I substituted with half-n-half and butter.

This was delicious.  I altered the recipe to make this for eight people on Christmas morning, and my family loved it.  I thought it needed a little more flavor, maybe onion or even salt and pepper.  I will definitely make this again.

My fiance said this was a nice change from the usual dinner.  I used less hash browns and baked the casserole in a 9x9 Pyrex dish.  I would recommend seasoning the potatoes and egg mixture to your liking.  I used salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, but next time I will add some other herbs to up the flavor.  I used the cream but don't think it's necessary.  Baking time aside, this was a nice quick dinner.  We had ours with a side of fruit cocktail :)

This is a great base recipe on its own, but very adaptable to varied tastes and dietary restrictions. My version: I used Simply Potatoes shredded hash browns, no "squeezing" required. I mixed the potatoes with some melted butter, but also one egg to help hold it all together well. I also added some salt, pepper, and a bit of onion powder to them for some additional flavor. I baked the potato crust as directed. For my filling, I used some Boar's Head Rosemary and Sundried tomato ham - I have the deli just give me one thick, 1/4 to 1/3 inch slice that I diced up. I sauteed onions, green pepper, and garlic, and mixed the ham in to sautee for a couple of minutes. Separately I mixed the eggs and heavy cream. I also added in some chopped fresh parsley and rosemary, and a bit of salt and pepper. Finally, I used a mixture of shredded monterey jack and sharp cheddar cheese. Finally, I just mixed all of the filling ingredients together rather than layering the meat and cheese and pouring the custard over it. Turned out great, the entire family loved it!

Used sausage because that is what I had on hand and sauteed some onion with the sausage. Also used skim milk instead of cream & only 2 tbsp of butter. My husband usually hates breakfast bake type dishes & he raved about this one!!!

I give this recipe 4 stars because I had to make so many changes to it. First of all, you definitely only need 1 12oz. package of hash browns ( I used shredded) and they do not fit in a 10 inch pie pan. I used an 8x11" baking dish. Also, I thought the hash brown crust would have been a lot better if they were fixed according to the package directions before placing in the dish. They were not nearly crispy enough when done as the directions say. Lastly, what quiche recipe only calls for 2 eggs? I ended up using 6. All in all, I thought the quiche was very delicious but I really had to deviate from the original instructions!

Oh my gosh--I LOVE this!  I made several changes, though.  I used nearly 2 cups of Egg Beaters (7 eggs), skim milk, jack and colby low fat crumbled cheese, canadian bacon and only 2 T of butter.  Tastes fantastic!  I make on Sunday and take to work for breakfast all week.   Thanks, Kathy!

Excellent recipe - used a 20 oz. package of refrigerated hash browns, four eggs, 1/4 of a pound of bacon - diced and pre-fried - along with the other ingredients (whipping cream, Monterey jack cheese) and it was a winner. Three grandsons and two of their friends gave it a thumbs up. A nice breakfast for the start of their school day.  Thank you BOBKAT2000

My husband and i just love this easy recipe.  I do add onion to ours for added flavor.  I usually freeze half in single serve containers and when we want it again we just reheat in the toaster oven for a quick meal on the go.

Simple and delicious - just loved it and make it regularly now.  I got rave reviews when I took it to a brunch and people asked for the recipe. This one is a winner! I used Swiss cheese in place of Monterrey Jack.

I love how versatile it is! I personally use sausage and some green peppers instead of ham. I also avoid using the butter and simply cook the hash browns for 20 minutes first, then use a spoon to spread them out more evenly before spreading the sausage, peppers and cheese.

My kids loved this.  Made a few minor changes: shredded my own potatoes, added minced, sauteed onions in with the egg mixture, added a little salt and pepper, used cheddar cheese and skim milk.  I think this really could have used at least one, if not two, more eggs and double the cheese.  Other reviewers commented on the potatoes coming out crispy around the edges.  My son said that he would have liked even more crispy potatoes - all personal preference.  Very good and very easy.

I've made this for years . It make for a more appealing and filling dish than a pastry crust to me . I've used bacon , ham , sausage ,onions,mushrooms, green pepper ,asparagus, any kind of cheese ( pepper jack , swiss , cheddar . smoked gouda  ..Different combos of what's on hand.. it all works .If I don't have the cream I use milk and use another egg or two .  I've used fresh spuds or dehydrated ... I have a preference for reds (skin on) .

My husband tried to do this before and it was delicious! Now it was my turn :) I am a meat lover so I made mine with bacon and ham. Before I've put it in the oven. I mixed everything to make the meats even.. Also, I've used one stick of butter instead of 1/3 and milk instead of heavy whipping cream. This made the quiche more intact.

This recipe was really good, great taste.  However, I used 1/2 bag of hasbrowns and 4 eggs (and, as always, I went a little heavy on cheese).  My 18 month old loved it.  Anything he gives a thumbs up to gets a spot in my recipe book!!

Great recipe for leftover ham!  This recipe can be eaten for breakfast, brunch or dinner.  I stayed with the ingredients, only adding a sprinkle of salt, pepper and garlic over the potatoes before baking.  I also put a small dollop of ranch dressing on my plate to dip my quiche in for extra flavor!

I'm not a huge fan of hashbrowns, but this was really good. I didn't have any hashbrowns on hand, so I shredded up some potatoes, squeezed them out on a paper towel and used them w/ the butter for the "crust." They were cooked, but I think I would have liked them more well-done. Will have to play with the cook time next time. Also added 3 more eggs.

prepared in a 9x13 pan- used 2 packs of Simply Potatoes & increased eggs to 6 and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 to 1 1/4 cups. I seasoned the potatoes before baking.  This was good, and an easy way to use up cooked ham.  Everyone loved it.

This was great. I used Potatoes Obrian and let it sit all night in frig. For the stuffing I cooked up a pound of cheap greasy sausuage and onion. Then made just a little bit of suasage gravy. Poured that over the shell. Then put 6 beaten eggs with a little milk in them over top of of that and then put 2 cups of sharp chedder on top of that. It was sinful!

I thought this was really good and a great base to add whatever you like to it. I added red and yellow bell peppers and red onions to it because I needed to use them up and it was great.

GREAT with a few tweaks!!  I used 12oz of hash browns because 24oz was WAY too much. I will also cut down the butter a little next time - a bit too greasy. I added a bit of precooked onion on top of the ham. 

I used a heaping cup of ham and cheese both. If you like a lot of cheese, then I would use more than that even - I will next time. I used 3/4 cup of whipping and 3 eggs. 

I personally would cut the hash browns to 10oz, but my boyfriend liked it the way it was with 12oz.  I stuck the with the original cooking times and while the edges of the crust were very brown, the body of the crust wasn't very crunchy - but I like it that way. 

LOVED the recipe though and will definitely make it again, plus, it's so versatile you could make it many different ways!  THANKS!!!

I needed this for very early the next morning, so I made it the night before.  Doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 12 glass dish.  The potato layer was very forgiving...just kept it in the oven a little longer (10 minutes actually) until the top edges started to brown nicely.  I added some quickly cooked mushrooms in a bit of butter, some chives and a few spices to the egg/cream mixture and used the cheese/ham combo as in the recipe.  I made sure the casserole was just the right consistency when I took it out of the oven.  I HAD to take a taste before letting it cool and to then refrigerate.  Wonderful!!  My problem occurred in the morning.  I cut individual servings and gently microwaved each.  Maybe because of the amount of cream with such few eggs?  I don't know, but it was not "light" as it was the night before.  It was a condensed "block" of solid potato.  Even the flavors seemed not  as great.  I would make again....ONLY to be served immediately.

I think this recipe is good however I think the potatoes need a bit of salt if you use thinly sliced smoked ham.The latter is not too salty. I usually eat my recipes with low salt content,so if using the smoked ham salt is needed, cubed ham is a lot saltier. Next time I will also add a bit of freshly ground pepper to the hash browns. Also, to boost flavor you can add a bit of chopped onion to the potatoes...it gives it an extra flavor! I also agree that the measurements are off. I had to add one egg. And I would say when baking it with the eggs watch carefully because if baking at 425F, you might not need the full 30 minutes you may need a lot less.

I like this recipe, it's easy for family visits to make the day before. I used frozen hashbrowns this time and it was a pain to remove the moisture. I like the refrigerated kind better. I did add more eggs than what the recipe called for and added milk to the whipping cream. This is a good one for picky children.

We had this for dinner, actually.  It was a hit ~ even to my 9 year old daughter who detests ham.  She asked for seconds.  I basically followed the recipe...but I had a huge bag of hashbrowns, so I doubled the eggs and cream and cheese.  I made it in two different dishes.  One was a not so deep but large stoneware dish and the other was in a deep pie dish.  The deeper one came out way more fluffy.  I think that next time, I will put it all together in one because of the fluffiness.  This is a keeper :)

Very good...tried it again with some onion and it was great!  I think it could be wonderful a lot of different ways...with sausage, green peppers, onions, bacon, etc.  I think you could even use half and half to cut down of the fat.

I haven't bothered to rate a recipe before but this dish I just Love!  I used mashed potatoes with the skin on instead of hash browns, extra cheese and doubled the recipe and it was excellent! I will try to do it with less fat next time though.

I've made this twice now and the whole family loves it. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and added two more eggs, cooked the potato crust till crispy and used the Simply Potatoes.  I used the Southwest flavor along with Mexican Blend cheese and it really spiced the dish up nicely.  This will be our Christmas brunch recipe forever.

My husband likes this better than quiche with a traditional crust. It's easy to make. Be sure to use shredded hash browns, not cubed and thoroughly squeeze the moisture from them using paper towels.

Everytime I make this I'm asked for the recipe.  I did take everyone's suggestion to add more eggs (I usually do 6) and I only use as many hash browns as it takes to make a crust.  Also, just from trial and error, I completely thaw out the hash browns and I end up baking them a little longer than the recipe suggests.  I like them to be browned before I add the eggs.  This is an outstanding recipe!

Very good starter recipe, but I made many changes/additions.  Used freshly shredded potatoes instead of frozen hash browns...can't beat the flavor of fresh!  Only used about 3-4 T. butter.  For the filling, I used 4 eggs,  3/4 c. 2% milk, 1/4 c. onion, and 1/4 c. red bell pepper.  Also used cheddar instead of jack.  Topped with sour cream.  Very very tasty.

I love this dish and have made it on several occasions. So far, I haven't received anything but compliments. I've come to use this recipe more as a guideline than a bible. 
     My variations: I choose the Simply Potatoes Southwestern Style potatoes for added flavor and I always double (sometimes even triple) the eggs. Often, I will use a couple of 'real' eggs, then 2 - 4 servings of 'fake' eggs. I've also included a cup or so of broccoli florets and regularly use a cheese combo like cheddar jack. I like adding a tsp of dry mustard powder, too. Feel free to use half & half or milk--whatever your have on hand--it doesn't seem to influence the final results too drastically one way or the other in my experience.
The leftovers are great for weekdays when you have less time, but need more protein than cereal offers. Have fun with this and enjoy your hearty breakfasts!

I tried this for Christmas and it was great!!
I used sausage and cheddar cheese instead.  The second time I made it I used 4 eggs and 1% milk.
The extra eggs made the dish more fluffy.
You must try it!!

Love it. Lots of room for ingredients if you use a deep dish pie plate.  I just pressed frozen hash browns into bottom and sides - did not thaw and squeeze excess juice. I found it could have used a little more egg.

This was pretty good, but the next time I make it, I will make even more changes to the recipe.  I did parboil some potatoes and shred them, instead of using frozen hash browns.  That worked well, except I parboiled a bit too long so they weren't as crispy as I would have liked.  I added many spices garlic and onion powders, dijon mustard, a splash of habanero sauce, salt and pepper.  Used 4 eggs, instead of 2 and 2% milk.  Also, some sauteed minced garlic, onion and red pepper.  The next time I will add more ham, it seemed to need more meat.  I think it could use some fresh mushrooms too, sauteed.  Lastly, I should have added some swiss cheese.  I think that would have helped the flavor greatly.  Who doesn't love ham and swiss?

This was very good.  I used a 2 qt. French white corningware cookware.  Don't get freaked out by the amount of hash browns.  They shrink when cooked so make sure to use them all.  I increased the melted butter to 2/3 cup and increased the eggs to 5 as others had suggested.  Next time I make it I will use 6 eggs.  I shredded the monteray jack cheese myself.  I used 1/4 cup half and half (because that is what I had) and 1/4 cup 2% milk.  I wanted to lighten up the fat a bit.  It was excellent and very easy to heat up leftovers in the microwave.

I added onion and used 3 eggs & 1 cup heavy cream. We think fresh chives added to the egg/cream mixture instead of onion would work also Very easy recipe that I plan on making often.

After reading comments that the hash browns were a bit soggy, I defrosted the hash browns first before mixing in the melted butter.  It came out great.  I also sautéed some button mushrooms, one clove of garlic and a few thin slices of red onion and added it as another layer.

super easy dish, but reading some reviews I seasoned my potatoes before filling and seasoned the custard as well. Also be sure to saute/brown the ham it adds a simple sweet note to the dish

This was not bad .. I tried it with sausage instead because my ham disappeared! And I tripled the recipe because of the large amount of people I feed.  They all enjoyed. Next time I will add extra cheese and a couple more eggs and possibly some onions! Thanks..

I didn't have Monterey Jack, so I used Sharp Cheddar. The Cheddar browned very nicely. It was delicious. My husband loved it.  Next time I will do as others have suggested and make the crust the night before.

Yum!  I made this for my husband, but I can't stay out of it!  I was looking for a way to use up both ham and heavy cream, so this fit the bill, though I think this would still work with milk.  I did use cheddar cheese out of necessity and baked the crust for an extra five minutes.  I will definitley make again when we have leftover ham.

I made this the morning of New Years Day for some overnight houseguests, all of whom asked me for the recipe to take home.  I used some bacon as well as the ham, and I used only enough hash browns to coat the entire pie dish.  I also salted/peppered the hash browns before baking the first time and it smelled and tasted great.

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS DISH FOR A FEW YEARS NOW, EVERYONE ALWAYS REQUEST THIS WHEN THEY COME TO MY HOUSE.  MY SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW ARE OBSESSED WITH IT!  IT IS A SIMPLE EASY DISH, W/O A LOT OF PREP WORK- JUST TIME TO COOK OVERALL CAN BE A BIT OF A WAIT- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE HUNGRY PEOPLE TO FEED.  I HAVE ALTERNATED BETWEEN DIFFERENT CHEESES JUST TO CHANGE IT UP A BIT. I ALSO USE THE SIMPLY SHREDDED REFRIGERATED POTATOES, SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE TO BE DEFROSTED, THIS HELPS SAVE TIME. GREAT RECIPE TO FEED A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH- THANKS AGAIN!

This is a very good and easy quiche to make. I had only cubed hash browns with peppers and onions so I thawed them in tha microwave with a little extra butter. Mashed them into a 10" pie stone. I also added 2 extra eggs and used left over pork loin instead of ham...Very Yummy!!!

I made this recipe for breakfast on New Year's Day for my husband and our guests....it was a big hit.  It was so good my husband asked me to make it again the next day.  I added green onions, extra cheese and a little extra heavy whipping cream.  Delish!!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I liked this recipe and so did my family. I used 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk, added green onions and yellow and red bell peppers. I also only put in half of the ham but added pershutto (spelling?) in it's place. Great recipe!

Great base recipe, the possibilities are endless. If you live in a household of men like I do the hash brown crust was perfect. Real men had no idea they were eating Quiche

Thanks for a great basic recipe which can be easily changed to accommodate ingredients on hand, special dietary needs, etc.  It is nice to have a recipe like this that you can make ahead of time for when you need/want to enjoy a relaxing morning with your family or guests.  Thanks, Bobkat . . .

Don't usually do the cooking, but this quiche came out perfectly.  Looked good too.  Think maybe I'll try sausage instead of ham next time.  Need to make enough to feed 17, so I'll probably make 3, ham, sausage, ???

The recipe is a delicious and filling breakfast treat.  Good for Holiday morning quick and easy to alter by adding different breakfast meats and fresh veggies. I've even made it for dinner.

We're having guests for brunch in a few weeks, so I gave this a trial run.  We both really enjoyed it.  I used fat free half and half, one whole egg and two additional egg whites.  I also used bacon, scallions, and the "simply" hash browns which are not frozen.  It's not soggy or runny, which is the problem with most breakfast casserole dishes.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I had to put foil around the edges (much as you would a pie) so that they didn't burn.  My husband said this is a keeper, and I will be proud to serve this to guests.

This was a very good, simple quiche.  The hash brown crust added a nice touch.  The only thing I changed was using heavy cream and doubling the eggs and the cream (4 eggs, 1 cup cream).  It was very good.

This is a good basic recipe which can be tweaked to personal preference. I was in a bit if a hurry, so I just added some finely diced onion. However, like other reviewers have suggested, you could add pretty much anything. Thanks!

I thought my family would like this.  They loved it!  I took the advice of others (more eggs & less cooking time, used fresh potatoes & added onions to them & made sure they were browned) and the only other change I would make is to have a thinner layer of potatoes.  Oh, and I doubled the batch - the leftovers were just as tasty the next day.  Will definitely be making this again!

Very good. As noted earlier, this recipe is a good starting point but needed some tweaking. Using six eggs was sufficient-any less and I think it would be too dry. Milk instead of cream worked fine. I used the Western Simply Potatoes and it was a little too hot for me. Next time I may use plain potatoes and add a little chopped onion. Oh, and dry mustard would add zip to it. But overall, very good.

This was an excellent recipe!! I did take everyone's advice and I actually used 7 eggs, about 1/4 cup melted butter, milk instead of cream and added about 1/2 c. onion and 1/2 c. green bell pepper and seasoned both the hashbrowns and egg mixture to taste. Also, I did not need to cook it as long as suggested after adding the egg and such, but it still turned out awesome! All of my co-workers loved the recipe and I plan on making it again!!!!

the concept is great but the recipe could use some help - 1. I used 7 cups of shredded potatoes mixed woith butter and put into 9x12 pan and baked at 425 for 25 minutes  not at all brown so they got 10 more minutes.  2. used 4 eggs as suggested, used 1/2 & 1/2 and added green onion (1/2 c), mustard (1tsp), 2 oz pimentoes, 1/2 tsp hot pepper sauce and 2 tsp pork seasoning mix everyone liked it but it still needed more flavor - next time I will use sharp cheddar and fresh parmesan cheese

Either the time or the temperature on this recipe are off. Mine came out way too dark for my taste. Next time, I'll reduce the temp to 375 and see how that goes. Aside from being almost burnt, the flavors were pretty good.

A great base recipe! I took the suggestion from other reviewers and used a 20 oz bag of Simply Potatoes which was more than enough to fill a 10 inch pie dish. I couldn’t find the ones with onion so I added my own chopped onion. Two eggs didn’t seem like enough so I doubled it to four. This was easy and delicious. I am going to use sausage next time and bacon at some point in the future. The versatility of this recipe makes it a winner!

It was just ok, and I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and chopped jalapeños to the egg/cream mix.  Had I not done that, I feel it would’ve been much too bland. Won’t make again.

This turned out well. It's a great, easy quiche for those who are gluten free, but not concerned about carbs or calories. I read a review that said a 10" pie plate wasn't big enough. I think you just have to have one that is not shallow. I had plenty of room. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple eggs (as suggested in the video) and some chopped scallions for added taste and color. Served it to my gluten free foodie friends and they asked for the recipe!

It's good but needs something. Lacks the 'wow' factor.
Will definitely make it again adding something. Real good base recipe though.

Delicious!  Needs more eggs & cheese though.  Next time, I try it with double the egg/whipping cream mixture.

I added mushrooms, red peppers, feta and used eggs/half and half since I didn't have whipping cream. It came out great.

A keeper.  Very tasty, but I took suggestions from others:  cooked the potatoes 10 minutes longer, used half and half and added two more eggs, some sauteed spring onions.  I also used Simply Potatoes which made it nice and SIMPLE.  

My husband liked it too, but suggested I salt and pepper the potatoes, and consider adding onion powder and garlic powder.  Maybe, but not necessary.

This was delicious! I added more eggs and lowered the temperature to 415. I also covered it the second time I made it. This kept the top nice and yellow! This hash brown crust was yummy!

My family and I liked this a lot. It's a very unique breakfast option, with good flavor and while it takes some time, it isn't difficult. I used the "fresh" hash browns, but would probably use thawed frozen next time because I think it would be easier to "sculpt" into the pie plate. I also added one egg, which I'm not sure I needed but didn't hurt,  and cojack for cheese because it was what I had. Will definitely make again.

I would have like the recipe to say to defrost the potatoes first. I agree that it tasted very good, but there wasn't quite enough custard for the amount of potatoes. We did add salt at the table because there is none in the recipe and with that many potatoes it needed a little umph!

Everyone loved it except myself. I used fresh potatoes that were par cooked and cubed small, but it didn't work as well texturally with the recipe. Am going to try it again with frozen hash (which will make it easier as well).

This recipe was delicious!! I used bacon instead of ham.  Yummy.  I have a picky eater who doesn't care for eggs.  I got her to try it and she loved it.  Even had some leftover and the family ate it the next  day.

I used frozen hash browns and milk vs cream.   Very good - we didn't have any leftovers which sums up how good this was.

I used 30 ounces of calif...maybe too much for this amount of servings. 

I used milk instead of cream used extra 

1/2 white egg beaters

1/2 onion and 1/2 green pepper.  

May want to grease the pan or/and cook the calif mixture.

I just made this, and it is very good.  I followed the directions exactly, but I did add another couple of eggs and mixed milk instead of just heavy cream.  I would definitely be making this again.

There should be some seasoning.  I sort of brown the Hash Browns ( I actually use Obrien hash browns )  I let them get to be about 1/2 done, I reserve a good handful of the hash browns till the end (btw, I use much more of all the ingredients, lol)  Just before baking, I sprinkle the remaining hash browns and some Cheddar cheese on the top and bake.  The potatos come out really yummy...I do think its a great dish for a lot of people., as a side dish for brunch.

I love this recipe.  I had to play around a bit with the measurements as I didn't have the right size dish to begin with.  I find 1/4 c of cream to each egg is perfect.  I use a glass 9.5" deep pie plate and use 5 eggs.  Ham and cheese I just put in without measuring - whatever I have or looks right.  Also have tried with browned breakfast sausage and that is even more fabulous.

Yum! Made the following changes: used 30oz bag of hash browns, 3 eggs & a dded a little more cream than called for. Also used a smoked ham steak and used a mix of monterey and cheddar. Baked in 9x13. So good. I want more! Will definitely add to the rotation.

Great, simple recipe that impressed my wife!  I substituted the hash brown potatoes for 6 hash brown patties that I layered the bottom with.  Worked like a charm.  Got rid of the butter since I had plenty of fat already.  Finally a delicious way to get rid of all that leftover ham from the holidays.

I love this recipe!!! Where I live I don't have access to tater tots so I used the microwave to cook potatoes then put them on the bottom as a crust. Turned out perfect! Thanks for the gluten-free idea..

I made a bigger version of this using a dozen eggs, more ham and cheese into a 9x13 pan. It's one of our camping favorites to feed a lot of people.

I tried this recipe and had a 30 oz bag of Oreda, I guessed about leaving the extra 6 oz. out. Mine were frozen so I wasn't able to squeeze out much moisture. I figured 1 cup of ham and cheese was about 4 oz of each. We liked it and will make it again but I will add grated onion to the hash browns for more flavor. I might also try sausage sometime instead of ham. This is a good idea if you are having a couple visiting for breakfast as it will serve 4-6.

Thank you for a delicious submission! I'll be making this over and over. I did not use heavy whipped cream, or frozen hash browns. I made my own hash browns, and used 8 eggs. Plus, I used Tillamook Cheese, and sauteed onions and celery. This was exceptionally delicious!!!

A simple go-to breakfast casserole.  I've made this twice, once with fresh hash browns rather than frozen and once using leftover broasted potatoes.  Both times the casserole was equally delicious.  I added a little sweet red pepper for color.  I was worried about the high baking temp, but it turned out fine.  Just make sure you let the casserole sit for 5-8 minutes before cutting to serve.  This will help to ensure nice serving pieces.

I've made quite a few of the breakfast casserole recipes from this site and this one is DEFINITELY my favorite.  I turned it into a full sized casserole just by scaling up the quantities.  I made the top layer with 9 eggs, baked it until it looked done.  It was marvelous - I served it with sour cream.

My husband and I loved this recipe. He loves quiche but im not a huge fan of the normal pie crust. Tried this out to surprise him and it went over wonderful! So easy to make. I did add 2 more eggs and some salt and pepper and some spices. Just as great if not better the second day! So easy and just delicious.

I knew right away this wouldn't fit in a 10 inch pie plate so I used a 9x13 baking dish.  I will add extra eggs, cream, cheese and ham next time and I expect it to be even better.  But even the way I made it this time (no changes except the size of baking dish) it was delicious and there was none left.

Made this for a bridal shower and people went nuts. I wished I would have doubled it. It's good for someone who wants to experiment with quiche, but not get to crazy.

This recipe was awesome!  Easy and yummy!  My husband is a vegetarian, so I substituted the ham with broccoli and it was fantastic.  I steamed the broccoli first and used a round glass pan instead of a pie tin.  I cut down the final step to 20 minutes instead of 30.  What an easy and great recipe!  Highly recommended.

I found this recipe a few years ago and I haven't stopped using it! Its delicious! I use the frozen hash browns that come with little bits of onion and peppers for a little extra flavor and I think it works out nicely.

So delicious!! I tried this recipe for Easter morning with my dad and we both loved it! I subsituted bacon for ham. Next time I will not bake the hashbrown crust as long since it got a little too crispy in the end. 15 minutes should be enough. Great recipe, thanks!!

This is incredibly easy and the best breakfast casserole ever.  I Made a couple of adjustments, doubled the egg to increase the protein content, and haven't used the exact same ingredients any time. Sausage & cheddar was a big hit, even added vegetables and salsa a few times. No matter what the combination, my company consistently asks for the recipe. I will never make strata again!
