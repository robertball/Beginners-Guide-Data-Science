Delicious! I used tapioca flour instead of wheat but otherwise followed the recipe...for the first cup. Then I got to thinking there was something missing and made another one with a generous shake of cayenne pepper. Both versions were very good and both have commandeered their way into my family's afternoon snack rotation. Thanks swaneerasmey for the recipe.

This turned out great!!  The only thing I changed was using vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk because my son can't have dairy.  Changed the servings to 3 instead of 12 and my 2 kids drank it all.

I cut the recipe down so it only made 3 servings and in doing so I kind of altered a few ingredients slightly. I also added a few squirts of Hershey's syrup for some extra chocolate flavor. SOOOO CREAMY!!!!

Best hot chocolate in Texas! I added a pinch of cayenne for a tiny kick, and it's perfect. I recommend using a medium low temperature and stirring often - it does take about 5-10 minutes longer than the recipe states.

I have never had Mexican-Style Hot Chocolate and this recipe was so easy to put together. The clove adds that something to it that makes you want to drink more

This hot chocolate is just delicious! It’s a great variation from just plain hot chocolate. So glad I found this one. My husband loves it and he is very hard to impress when it comes to chocolate drinks. Thanks for posting!

It might be the fact that I didn’t exactly have the best measurement devices or bad ingredients but it did not come out right a little to thick to not chocolaty. I tried adding milk and sugar o it didn’t work to well it wasn’t terrible I left alone covered for a night woke up to my mom somehow making some good pudding using it I don’t know how but best pudding ever.

Oh my. This is amazing. And when it is 20 degrees outside and you are sitting by a woodstove looking at a Christmas tree, it is especially amazing.

I'd give it 4 stars as it's written. Modified it a little bit - I made a 1/2 recipe, bur tripled the cocoa powder and approximately doubled the sugar. Also used allspice as I was out of ground cloves. Rave reviews from everyone who had some!

Man oh man- this is mouth-waterin' good. It's a cold and rainy day in GA, so I found this recipe to warm us up. It's so good that I invited a friend over to join us later this evening, when we enjoy our 2nd cup.
