I served this for a big New Year's dinner party.  I had several vegetarians attending, so I made it with vegie broth cubes instead of chicken broth.  We loved it and my guests obviously enjoyed them as there were none left in the pan or on the plates. I did follow other's suggestions to add a bit more broth and left it covered for the first 1/2 hour of baking.  I did peel the onions, and one out of 16 lost its shape, but the others were fine.  It is important to pick same size onions and then cut them in half equally to prevent uneven browning.  Thanks for sharing!

What a wonderful recipe! The onions look like flowers on the plate when they are served, and the taste is divine! I served it as part of Thanksgiving dinner, and it was liked by all who tried it. To accommodate the turkey taking up the entire oven, I prebaked the onions to the point in the recipe where the cream is added, put them in the fridge, brought them to room temperature and finished them off in the hot oven with the cream while the turkey rested and we ate our first course. Thank you for this great recipe that I will use again.

Fantastic!  The aroma fills the house and made everyone hungry before I could get the food on the table.  The only thing I did different was to cover the onions for the first 30 minutes - was afraid the liquid would evaporate too quickly.  Everyone, including non-loving onion lovers, really enjoyed this dish.  Will definitely add it to the Thanksgiving menue.  Thanks.

Very tasty and something different!  I also was confused about how to cook with skins on, so I just took them off and it turned out delicious!

These were delicious!  Although the cooking time is long, they are very easy to do.  I halved the recipe; used a deep-ish, smaller baking dish and had no problem with the volume of liquid (or splattering). I had no fresh rosemary, so I used dried.  Fantastic!  The skins and tops brown nicely and make a beautiful presentation.  Highly recommended.

This was excellent! I'm not very big on onions, I like them, but don't love them. But after seeing all the great reviews, I decided to try them. And they were AWESOME! I loved the sauce they were in. I served this with steak and potatoes (and this mixed very well with the potatoes.. the sauce was great on them). Everyone really loved them, and even my boyfriend (who despises onions) found them to be good. I will definitely make this again. The amount of time it takes to cook this is worth it!

I loved this as a part of our Christmas dinner.  The tender onions and Rosemary flavor was so delicious.  I had enough leftovers to use in quiche and then I combined it with Roasted Vegetables to make a soup as well.  I will do this again.

How can anything so simple be SO GOOD!! You hit a home run on this winner, MBATMT! The rave reviews of the majority say it all about the heavenly aroma and melt in your mouth taste of this onion dish.  I made it first for Thanksgiving and a second time for Christmas this yr. - family loved them with both turkey and chicken. As others suggested, I covered the dish for the first 30 mins. of cooking to conserve the sauce - will increase the sauce next time as also suggested - no splattering problem, thus, no tray necessary. I used smaller (about 12) yellow onions about 2.5 - 3 in. in diameter and they were just great cooking for about 1.5 hrs.  I believe that there may have been a typo error at the top of the recipe when it said cook time: 2 hrs.?  Later in the recipe the cooking time adds up to 1 hr. and 30 min. max in step 3 with the cream being added in the last 1/2 hr. BRAVO TO THIS TASTE SENSATION!

I love this recipe! This last time I made it I added some white wine to the broth (about 1/4 cup) and some sliced Swiss or Havarti on top. YUM! The recipe is great and totally versatile.

This was amazing! I got compliments on the presentation, as the browned tops and rosemary on top looked lovely. The rosemary tasted great and the rich flavor of the cream throughout the baked onion made it taste absolutely wonderful. I am just a beginner when it comes to cooking, but this was easy enough to make and I am looking forward to making this tasty dish again!

Awesome! The skins keep the onion from falling apart while cooking, and are easy to remove at the end. My only recommendation would be to wait until the onions are finished to add any desired salt. The chicken broth reduces by quite a bit - mine were VERY flavorful without additional seasoning, and would likely have been too salty for me if I had added it before cooking. Thanks for the recipe - a definite keeper!

I made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Both times I needed at least an hour and a half to get the onions tender. The second time I used an additional half cup of cream, and poured it on the onions slowly so it seeped down between the layers. I was also using 12 or 15 small, whole onions.  The first try was good enough to try again, but the second try was amazing! My brother did not care for them, because he has texture issues and they were too soft for him. I thought they were incredible and ate them for dessert. I have been on this site plenty of times over the years and have never found a recipe I was passionate enough about to write a review of, but these were so good I had to break my streak. We have a rosemary bush outside and so the ingredients are really easy to procure, which I love. It's so simple and so, so tasty.

I tried this one out on myself before I decided to make it for company. I found out that dried rosemary is not a good idea. I've never used fresh rosemary before, but I'll definatly try this next time! To answer the other poster's question, I found that the skins dried and were easy to remove with a fork once they were done. I will definately make this again though!!

10 STARS! This was so good, it surpassed the Omaha Sirloin Steaks we made to go with it. My only issue was I only cooked one onion for my husband and me to split, I will not make that mistake again. I used a whole can of chicken broth and just eye-balled the cream until it looked like enough. I also made it in a glass loaf pan in the toaster oven, and had no problems with splatters. The sauce is wonderful and was great spooned over our mashed red potatoes and steak! The left-over sauce I might use on asparagus or broccoli tonight as its too good to throw away! Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I can't wait to share it with family.

I was a bit skeptical at first..."Eat a whole onion!, not so sure about that!" That was my initial response...but after reading the reviews and wanting to try something a little bit different, I proceeded to try this out. AND all I can say is 5 stars is not good enough. This is an elegant dish that reminds me of food I've had at some the finest restaurants. The onion was extremely delicious and tasty. Even my 8y/o daughter loved it!!! This is definitely a family favorite and I am going to make this for my extended family over the holidays!!!! THANK U for this GREAT RECIPE!

Amazingly tasty and so easy! The pulp in the middle just melts in your mouth. I just made a holiday feast for a few friends and these onions were not only the easiest dish I made but the one that got the best reviews. Vegetable stock worked like a charm. I used a smallish dish to bake them in and was worried by how high the stock level was, but it reduced perfectly as it baked. The skin keeps in the moisture and falls off easily once served. A great side dish for any occasion!

Made this with peeled, sweet white onions for a dinner party we were invited to. OMG - these are awesome. I am a vegetarian so used veggie broth instead of chicken. At the end of an hour my stock hadn't reduced to half, so poured it off into a fry pan and boiled it until reduced. Adjusted the seasoning and poured it back over the onions, added the cream and put back in the oven for another 30 minutes.  Made this earlier in the day and then reheated at the party at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Think you could also microwave it to reheat. Really a gorgeous dish and so flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe that will become a regular at our house.

This is truly excellent vegetable side dish.  I think this may be the only 5 star Ive given to a vegetable.  Compliments any dish that contains rosemary, especially baked chicken or lamb.  Be wary of the broth though--you probably will need to add more while its baking.

Excellent. Super tender. I might reduce cook time a bit bc my husband though they were TOO tender. Would make a delicious soup if you just pour it into a soup bowl.

This was fantastic - and soooo easy. I used some dried thyme instead of rosemary...and when adding the cream I mixed in just a couple of teaspoons (maybe a tad more) of flour just to make sure it thickened! I also sprinkled a small amount of Parmesan cheese on during the last 1/2 hour of baking for added flavor

Elegant and easy to make.  I covered it the first 30 minutes and also added a 1/4c of white wine.  This makes a great side dish.  Sure to impress and the aromas are to die for.

Instead of cooking the onions in the oven for an hour, I boiled them for 15 minutes.  Then I added all of the ingredients at one time.  My sauce still thickened up and everything was perfect.

It's a great recipe for anyone who loves onions or who is watching their calorie intake!

This was FANTASTIC!!  The only minor change I made was to flip the onions over when adding the cream so the tops don't dry out.

These turned out fantastic.  I didn't leave the peel on the onions and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  They turned out tender and juicy.

These are super easy to make!  I took them to a family meal and only those who like onions would eat them.  So I cannot say that those who do not like onions will eat them.  I thought they tasted like breadless onion rings.  I would definately make them again.

Believe it or not I found these lacking some flavor.  I was busy while they were cooking and my stock dried up and burnt a bit on the bottom of my dish in the first 1 hour of cook time.  I also found them to need salt in the end.  I did use low sodium stock.  We are onion lovers and prefer them caramalized or grilled. 1 1/2 hour cooking time for this result was not worth it to me.  They did smell good though while they cooked.

Wonderful gourmet side dish for any occasion.  I would recommend using the largest cookie sheet possible and baste during the first hour to avoid any dryness issues.

These were pretty good; however, after half an onion, they got a little old. I used evaporate milk instead of cream. I may or may not make them again.

I'm confused... one time great! next time... they were just hot onions, yuk!  I know it's good but I'm doing something wrong.  geno I wish I could "chat" with someone about this...  It's like they aren't carmelizing.  I'm a husband learning to cook.  don't know what I did wrong.  ??? `

I took them to a Pot Luck and there wasn't a drop left.  They are very rich but delicious.  I took off the skins prior to baking and they kept their shape!

I made these for Christmas with a roast beef.  I did peel mine and they kept their shape with no problem.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  When I put them on the table there were a few skeptics but had no leftovers.  They were the ones that went back for seconds!

Yum!  I made this as a side dish for our Christmas dinner of lobster tails and bacon risotto (the very FIRST I made on my own!).  Certainly an artery clogging meal, but SOOOO good.  These onions were delicious, my fiance and I both really enjoyed them.  I did not leave the skins on but the onions kept their shape nicely.  Great side dish for a holiday dinner because (after the prep) you can pretty much forget about it for an hour!

I love the elegant simplicity! I usually use Spanish Tarragon (it's blooming, now, and the yellow flowers are a beautiful and fragrant garnish), reduce the amt. of stock and supplement it with Dry Sherry, Brandy, or "New Orleans Rum". No spices needed but salt, pepper, maybe cayenne. Sliced or coarsely chopped button and/or oyster mushrooms are good when added with the cream, but don't use portabellas unless you want a gross-looking charcoal gray sauce.

These were very good.  I actually did remove the skins from the onions -- I just placed them closely together in the pan and they did not lose their shape.  When I went to serve them, I realized I forgot to add the cream!  So, I warmed the cream in the microwave and drizzled it over top and served immediately.  Next time, I'll plan on one-half onion per person, as nobody wanted another one.  But, the first serving was gobbled up!

We love grilled Vidalia onions, so we thought we'd love this recipe.  It was good, but not as good as our standby: top 'em with a thick pat of butter, a thick layer of grated parmesan cheese, wrap in foil, and grill til soft and juicy.  A summer favorite at our home!

Thank you. My Mum used to make some thing similar when I were little. This really is a taste from the past. Mum used sprigs of fresh thyme instead of rosemary and stirred the cream in at the last min., to just heat through and avoid spltting.

The onions were definitely tender and this is a good method for cooking them (and then using them in something else), but not a good side dish unless you LOVE onion. The flavor added from the other ingredients was not as powerful as I was hoping. Now I have to make a ton of other dishes to use up all of the leftover onion...

After searching for recipes with rosemary I was interested by this.  We really love onions.  However, I found the rosemary didn't do much just sitting on top of such a small portion of the overall onion. I also tried two types of onion.  

In order to keep from wasting it I ended up combining more broth,   veggies, and fresh herbs to make a creamy vegetable soup.  Won't be making this again.

I made this for the first time (double batch), and took it to a church Thanksgiving dinner.  Oh my!  None left.  At least a dozen (notable number since it's a small church) asked me for the recipe.  Followed it to a tee. Felt weird leaving the skins on - don't question it, just leave 'em on!

My in-laws make baked onions for holidays and I can't stand them...I hate the taste of onion unless it's cooked really well. But - my family and I could NOT get enough of this recipe! I made it exactly the way it calls you to do and it was ah-maze-ing.

I accidentally overcooked the onions by quite a bit, so it made them a bit mushy but extra-carmelized, which was a plus. These have a delicious strong onion flavor and are fairly simple to make, I kept the onions in the skins and it was a little tricky to cut them in half to serve once cooked, but just scoop some onto your plate & they are still very tasty. I will try to make these again and not overcook them next time!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it! I peeled the onions and they all held their shape just fine. My only addition was a splash of white wine with the broth. The sauce is sooo yummy over mashed potatos. Thanks!

Delicious!  I fixed these as part of a BIG dinner; there were leftovers. The next day, cooked some cubed chicken breasts, yukon gold potatoes, carrots and a little parsley in chicken broth, added in the leftover onions and sauce and YUMMMY again as a super soup!

Diners can remove the onion skin for themselves once the beauties are served on their plates!  The skins maintain the roselike appearance of the onion.  Gee whiz.  Great recipe.

Very good, but next time I will only make 1/2 of an onion for each person.  More than  that was just too much for us since it's pretty rich.

These were very unique and tasty. I was tempted to cover them initially as others had suggested, but I wanted to rate the actual written recipe. That is the only reason that I have elected to give this four stars. These need to be covered (read other posts for specifics) or the juices will dry up. Otherwise, this was a very nice dish for a change from the typical.

This was a simple recipe and I like all of the flavors individually, but they didn't really come together well for my tastes.  It wasn't bad, but I won't make onions again like this.  Fun to try though.

These are simply delisious, my husband loves onions anyway they come, but I only like cooked onions and this is had become my favorite way to have them. I like to use smaller onions for less baking time but that is the only thing I have changed about this yummy dish.

I too took the skins off before cooking, but we'll be using this one again. We've just had a bumper crop of onions from our garden and this is a great idea and a nice change from your regular baked onions. Thank you for the recipe.

There's nothing wrong with the recipe, I like all the ingredients in it but I just did not like this dish. I don't think the cream adds anything too it and the onions were mushy.

Two of my favorite flavors together in one dish - rosemary and onions.  I couldn't go wrong with this recipe!  It was delicious!  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used half and half instead and they still turned out super yummy.  I cooked them a little longer than the stated time, to get the onions nice and tender.  I also removed the skins and sliced the onions into half-rings to make eating them a little easier for my kids (who loved them, too!).

I was so disappointed after reading all the good reviews here.  It was just okay.  It wasn't very flavorful.  All is not lost though -- I'm going to use them for cheesy onion-garlic bread.  The onions are soft enough where they'll spread on the bread and be yummy with other ingredients.

So yummy, made them for Mother's Day bbq, served with bbq chicken, everyone loved them. I cooked the onions probably 45-1 hour longer than the recipe says, I wanted to make sure they were tender. I did cover them the first 30 mins too, not sure if that increased the cooking time. 
They are well worth it, very different and a hit at the bbq!

The cream curdled which made the texture of the sauce unpleasant, but the over all flavor was pretty good.

This was so good and so easy and the presentation is great.  The only problem I had was that the chicken broth did evaporate so there wasn't any sauce.  I just added the cream as suggested and hoped for the best.  It was fine but I will add a lot more broth the next time or cover it for most of the time as another reviewer suggested.

This reminded me of the cream onions my mom always made for the turkey holiday dinners.  The dish is OK.  It was not the deliciousness that other reviewers raved about.    I left the peel on, letting each person take it off themselves.  The texture was good.  I liked it, I just didn't think it was special.

Let's just say that although this seems like a "simple onion dish," it is anything but! The flavors were absolutely amazing! I served it with beef wellington and the flavors of the onions definitely complemented the dish. The only change I made was to use beef stock (I had an open box) and it worked perfectly since I was serving them with beef anyway. I will definitely make this again!! Thank you for this most awesome recipe!

The liquid did dry out.  I added more after an hour.  The sauce was heavenly...I imagine by covering first, the onions will cook thru much quicker.  I cooked it for the full timeframe.  I did not use rosemary (my fam doesn't like it).

Very delicious and pairs nicely with a steak.

The flavor is great, but it takes WAY longer than recipe states.  It's also to cut the bottoms totally strait so that the sauce stays on them better--well worth the effort!

I made it without the cream and it still tasted wonderful.  Am considering trying this recipe with almond milk next time.

YES! This is a keeper. We eat baked, fried, or sauted onions at least once a week. Very simple, very tasty. I made 8 and there were no left overs. Thank you for sharing this simple tasty recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Made this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner for 88 at our Senior Centre and it was a hit.  Other than having no cream and having to use milk, I followed the recipe exactly.  I would make it again, wouldn't change anything  except to use cream as per the recipe, or even half and half.  Before embarking on the recipe it's worth pointing out, this is not a quick cooking item.  The full cooking time is required.

I made this today to go with baked chicken, and it came out OK with good flavor but I am just not a fan. which is disappointing because I love onions. I just didn't care for the flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and my son really liked them but my husband nor I got that excited about them.

I made this recipe for my husband and I to try it out before we tried it on company.  What a wonderful taste treat.  We used Vidallia onions and I followed the recipe exactly.  I would not change a thing.  Great vegetable idea for winter months when fresh produce is at it's lowest availability.

It was easy to make, albiet I thought it tasted a little like a pine tree from the rosemary (but I think that was a me thing). I did a half batch in a 9x9 bake pan, for my oven I need to fiddle with the time or temperature, all the stock was evaporated by the time I went to add the creme. Leaving the skin on is fine, it peels off together instead of getting everywhere.

I loved it. My husband eats onions in everything, but not typically as a side dish. He was delighted with this recipe and I will definitely make it again. Directions were a little confusing on the cutting. I cut off the top and the bottom, making flat bottoms. Then I cut each in half again, like think coins. The directions didn't make that clear. The skins are easily removed after cooking and keep the inside onion moist and delicious.

I made this twice and it was a huge hit. My only change was to do it hotter as I didn't leave enough time. I admit I used more cream as well.

I did remove the skin.  My liquid did not reduce at all so I had plenty of it-actually too much.  I followed instructions, except for removing the onion skin,  and used ingredients as listed.   I will make this again.

This was very popular at Thanksgiving. I wanted to offer an onion dish and this was perfect - easy and delicious. Follow directions exactly - no changes needed. I will offer this tidbit though: I doubled the recipe and ended up with leftovers so, in making leftover turkey soup, I browned the leftover onions slightly before adding broth, carrots, leftover peas, and then some turkey. My soup tasted like a French onion soup! Next time I will purposely make extra!

This was awesome.  It was easy and it looked and tasted wonderful.  My husband called it gourmet.  
It does tie up your oven for over an hour at a high temperature but it is well worth it if you can work around this.

The texture is a bit mushy, my 15 years old daughter even said it's "bland" and the cream was and did obviously  curdle at that heat. The clotted cream was unattractive.

I was not overly impressed with this. I will say that the sauce was nice and creamy and had a great onion flavor. Would be nice served on top of steak or grilled chicken. I made these as a side dish for Thanksgiving. They were pretty bland. I followed the recipe exactly and I did use plenty of fresh rosemary. Maybe better with extra seasoning. I do watch my sodium intake so did not use a lot of salt, though I did use some. Would probably not try these again, given how long they take to cook.

Tried sneaking in a little Rosemary from my beautiful herb garden with this recipe which did not go for, but I loved it!  Left the skins on.  Great recipe for fresh rosemary.  Be sure your halved onions are bathed in plenty of chicken broth before cooking!

This recipe is "out of this world"!!  I cut it down to 2 vidalia onions (because it is just me).  I had 1/2 for dinner last night - which, I think, is a nice serving size. 1/2 for BREAKFAST?? this morning and another 1/2 at lunch.  One of the best "sides" recipe I have ever tried.

They were good, but not great.  I served them with a Prime Rib Roast and had plenty left over, so I wasn't the only one who was not completely impressed.  Probably will stay with the caramelized onions I normally prepare.

This didn't work for me at all.  It could have been me and the way I did it (I always adjust recipes depending on what I have on hand, etc).  It sounded so good, but it really didn't get there for me.

I thought this was an easy flavorful dish. I served it with prime rib and bleu cheese mashed potatoes. It was a hit! Also as far as leaving the skins on the onions they keep it together for a pretty presentation. They are easily removed if you wish to do so after plating.

Loved these!  I have two vegetarian daughters and as we've learned to cook differently, we've also searched for new foods to help make holiday meals special.  This dish has been officially named a traditional holiday food for us!  A very delicious and lovely addition to the plate.  Only adjustments were to cook with vegetable broth and to use thyme rather than rosemary.  (Grandma is not a fan of rosemary.)  EVERYONE loved them.  I had made more than enough and the leftover onions and sauce went through the food processor for addition into my potato soup.  ALSO yummy!

I broke the rules and made this for the first time for Christmas lunch at my mother's house.  It was a hit!  Even those people, like my husband, who don't really like onions enjoyed this. I personally could have eaten the whole pan.  Yummy!

There's just two of us, so I halved the recipe and prepared it exactly as written.  It was a yummy side dish and fresh rosemary is a must.  I did use half and half instead of heavy cream, and after the addition of the cream, I would reduce the heat a little next time as the juices cooked away too much.  Will make it again - so easy and tasty.

i really wanted to love this because it looked so darn pretty! :D and it was pretty good - but nothing outstanding.   i baked one onion with the skin on and one with the skin off and i preferred the skin off one - the onion kind of blossomed and soaked up more of the cream mixture.

This was so simple and delicious.  I used beef stock instead of chicken and it turned out to be more like a de-constructed french onion soup.  The rosemary kind of got lost in the background with the beef stock but it turned out perfect.  Will try it with chicken broth next.  I agree that the salt should be saved until the end.  You might not even need any depending on what kind of stock you use.  Great recipe.

I really like this recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving.  The only thing I did differently was to use small pearl onions and I peeled them.  Mom liked it also.

This dish is exactly what I expected it to be.  I showed up to Thanksgiving with it last year, by surprise, and had the whole family oooh-ing and aaaah-ing over a fresh twist on something as simple as onions.

These were very good, I made as directed and covered them for 30 minutes as others suggested. They turned out very good but next time I might add a little more cream. Thanks for the recipe.

This dish is wonderful! I did make a couple of changes the second time I made it by increasing the heavy cream/chicken broth alittle and covering it the first 30 minutes as others suggested.
