This was delicious!!  And pretty healthy if you cut down on the butter.  I added about 2 tablespoons of butter and it was still delicious.  I also mixed in slivered almonds and raisins.  Yummy!!!  I will also cut down th sugar by 1/4th cup next time.

the recipe was way to sweet. the desert itself was gorgous but I only used 2 tbs of butter which worked fine and i put 1/4 less of sugar in which was still way to sweet. 3/4 cup rather than 1 & 1/2 cups would have been plenty. you can always add more after. i also put more liquid in, not sure how much though i just added a little at a time untill it was right.

My mom used to make this for us for breakfast when we were young.  When I make it, I use half the stated amount of sugar and butter and sometimes add vanilla extract.  I also use regular semolina, not semolina flour.  Delicious!

Delicious recipe.  And I didn't notice any awful smell, as the description warned.  I substituted coconut milk for the water and cut down a bit on the sugar to give this recipe a Southeast Asian twist.

ahh...delicious!
better than my childhood years in greece where they make it using olive oil (!)--that's too heavy for me today. 

but the butter makes it heavenly! even though i used half of it and half the sugar called for.

also i sprinkled in a little black & white sesame seeds for color contrasts.

thx very much, nikita.
happy new year!

I've never tried this dessert before, so perhaps I'm not accustomed to the graniness of the semolina, but overall, this was good! The recipe was simply and quickly made from items on hand (semolina previously bought from arab market), and I only made two adjustments: 1 c. sugar (still a bit sweet), and dusted with powdered cinnamon and ground almonds.

Great!  No bad smell as the recipe indicates.  Reducced the butter to 1/4 cup. Added less sugar also 3/4 cup. Did not add any cinnamon. Just what I was looking for.  Very tasty - will make again!

sooo delicious!!! easy to do, no awful smell while making it, & it tastes really good. Even my mother, who does not really loves sweets, liked it. Next time im going to try putting a hint of cardamom to enhance the flavor a bit. Definitely i will make it again.

I made some changes to suit my taste - only 2 tbsp butter, only 1/2 cup of sugar and semolina instead of semolina flour. I liked it but for my taste it was still too sweet, at least on its own. We ate it with some plain yoghurt and like that it was just fine. I might experiment with different spices next time to make this even better.
The original recipe is okay, too much butter for my liking and way too much sugar if you don't have a serious sweet tooth.
For me, this is a good recipe to be tweaked to make it my own but not to be used as is. Just personal prefference...

This was delicious. I will most certainly make this again. Great with some vanilla ice-cream and fresh nutmeg.

One of those great quick solutions! I put in some vanilla sugar too and the aroma just makes you melt!

If you love Middle Eastern puddings and custards, you simply must make this. It is sure to satisfy. I used 1 cup of sugar, rather than 1.5 cups and added a bit of almond extract and the flavor that resulted was subtle and enticing. If you are a lover of almonds, definitely add almond extract (a wee bit). Also, sprinkle it with sliced almonds and pistachios, afterwards. I ate this for a week and was still so very sad when it was all gone. It was so delicious that I made it again in only a week's time. I took it to a gathering and it received excellent reviews--many comments on the splendidly subtle nuttiness and cinnamoniness of it, as well as on the splendid texture of the semolina. Thank you for posting this.

Changed it slightly as only put 1 cup sugar in and then added 2 Tablespoons of cocoa.  Also instead of milk I used condensed milk.  Left of the toppings.  It was divine!!  Very easy to make - and eat!

I didn't have Semolina. Instead I used farina. I also had some saffron on hand so I added that instead of cinnamon. I gave it three stars because of the sugar content. Way too much!! I cut it to 3/4 of a cup per other reviews and my oh my it was still really sweet. I did add a pinch of kosher salt to the recipe as well. It tastes good and I think the saffron gave it a Persian twist! Not sure if I would make this again.

Per suggestions in the reviews, I cut back on sugar. I used 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp. ginger instead of the cinnamon stick. I also added raisins. I had to add a lot more milk, it was so thick. When kept in the fridge, it really hardens up--to eat leftovers, I heated up the pudding in the microwave with plenty of extra milk. If I made this again, I would use honey in place of the sugar. I made this soley because I had some semolina to use up--it was pretty tasty.
