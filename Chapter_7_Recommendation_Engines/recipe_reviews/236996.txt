I also added the agave syrup and use pomegranate infused red wine vinegar.  Great taste and delicious on the spinach to which I added toasted almonds, blue cheese and dried cranberries.

I ran out of bottled salad dressing and decided to try this. I had to substitute dry basil for the oregano because it was all I had. The final result looked a bit like ranch dressing which I didn't expect, but was probably due to the mayonnaise. Still,it was delicious and I will make it again using fresh herbs.

I added 2 tsp. of agave syrup. You could use honey also. I dressed a strawberry spinach salad with it. Even my grandchildren loved it! I also used fresh oregano and fresh chives.
