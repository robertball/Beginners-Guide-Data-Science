I rarely give 5 but let me explain. I LOVE me some seafood but have never been a fan of crawfish not to mention not a huge fan of cream cheese. I made this as a special treat for DH to go with our anniversary dinner(he loves crawfish). This was to die for! SPICY but to die for. Very good and I highly reccommend to those of you who DO love crawfish and don't mind cream cheese. I will definitely make again once the price in seafood comes down! Thanks!

being from New Orleans also, I think this is a great basic sauce... I would recommend however that if you are using left over crawfish from a seafood boil, eliminate the crab boil & cajun seasoning totally.  If will be hot enough if it was from a seafood boil.

LOVE IT!!!!  BEING FROM SOUTH MISSISSIPPI I COOK WITH ALOT OF SEAFOOD. THIS DIP WAS PERFECT. I BROUGHT IT TO A PARTY AND ALMOST EVERYONE ASKED FOR THE RECIPE. I ADDED A BIT MORE OLD BAY AND MORE CRAB BOIL IN MINE. OH! THIS WOULD BE WONDERFUL OVER A BAKED POTATO!!!

This is my new favorite dip - and it's homemade! It's exceptional. I added a bay leaf (and took it out before serving), and some Louisiana Hot sauce as well as red pepper flakes to give it a more cajun zing. This dip is by far better when it's hot. When it is cold or room temperature it tastes faintly like a pate, which I am not at all fond of. Warm that sucker up in the oven if you're not serving it immediately (or in the extremely unlikely event that there are leftovers!).

*Makes an EXCELLENT hot salad dressing on top of a simple bed of mixed greens or wedge with avocado, cucumber, tomato, olives, and capers. The texture is perfect when it is just finished being cooked and hasn't set quite yet to pour over a salad for a unique cajun touch!

Old Bay and Crab Boil are both almost entirely salt, so that's 2 tablespoons of salt, plus the extra it called for was way too much salt for my taste buds!

This is delicious. I double the recipe and use crawfish and shrimp. Then after a day or two when you're tired of the dip, add heavy cream and make a HEAVENLY bisque!

This was awesome! I didn't add the salt but did add a few green onions. This seems too simple to be so good, but just try it and you won't be disappointed.

This was a bit hit at a party. I made it exactly as written and it came out perfect. The entire dish was gone before the game even started.

WAY TOO SALTY and I didnt even add the 1 tsp of salt.  I just finished making this and I had to add quite a bit of extra stuff to minimize the saltiness of it.  I ended up adding sour cream, heavy cream and the rest of the second block of cream cheese.  
Once I fixed it, it was very good. I will make this again but with WAY less of the salty ingreidents.  I think next time I will add the old Bay and crab boil 1 teaspoon each at a time.  I believe 2 teaspoons of each would be plenty sufficient. I will not have to use the sour cream or heavy cream hopefully.  So the flavor is good if you control the salt!!

So Im adding this part of the review after the event. Everyone loved it but got 3 comments that it was a little salty...got a lot of requests for the recipe, so overall it was a very tasty dip and I totally recommend it for anyone reading.  Just add the salty ingredients in small increments.  I added shrimp as well, which I simply chunked with a knife. so 5 stars for flavor and ease, it too no time to make :o)

This dip is amazing.  I used a 16 oz bag of frozen crawfish and roughly chopped them. Did not add the extra salt and it was perfect.
