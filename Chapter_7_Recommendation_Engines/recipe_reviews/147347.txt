We made this side dish last night. It was pretty good, but a bit bland. I heated it up today and added a bit more salt, which made all the difference. We'll definitely make this again and may be tweak it even more with different herbs.

I prepared this for the first time to serve at a cookout and was asked for the recipe a couple of times because it was different, and turned out good.  However, it did seem to be a bit dry, I wonder if adding one can of beans undrained and rinsed would help this problem.  I intend to try it the next time I fix it and I will fix it again.

Fantastic! I served this cold for dinner as a side and the next day I added chicken and had it for lunch. I omitted the white wine and added a Tablespoon of vinegar. I will keep this recipe at the top of my list.
