This is delicious; the only thing I would say is the initial 25 minute baking time was a little too long. I considered a white chocolate drizzle, but decided to go with the mint. I'm glad I did!!

Admittedly, I am not a Super Baker, and I never tried to bake biscotti before, but these Sinful Chocolate ones sounded so darn good, and I needed a chocolate cookie to round out the Christmas display of home-baked treats.  SO, having said all that in order to temper my review, I am going to tell you that either 375 degrees was TOO HIGH a temp for the oven, OR, 25 minutes was TOO LONG a baking time.   As I noted, I never baked biscotti before so I had to go on blind trust in the recipe.  I'm so sorry to say, because I would rather not review than to give a less than 5 stars, but if you read this whole review, either turn your oven down, or start looking for burning after 15 minutes.  To be fair to Chef V, I will make another batch later today, will adjust my baking temp to 350, will keep an eagle eye on the oven, and I hope the second attempt will be successful.  By the way, the prep on this recipe is super easy (so I don't really mind trying again).
