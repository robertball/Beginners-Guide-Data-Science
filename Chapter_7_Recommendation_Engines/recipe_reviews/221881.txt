I’m glad I doubled this, using a 3-pound roast, because now we can enjoy this again!  The recipe has immediate appeal; still, I found I was going to play with it.  Chuck is a fatty cut so I didn’t see the need to add ANY oil, let alone so much.  In fact, I trimmed the roast of a good deal of the fat before throwing it in the Crock Pot (rather than the oven).  I used no oil, and only one cup of beef stock, even tho’ I doubled the recipe.  I couldn’t see adding what would have been two cups of stock only to “drain and discard 80% of the liquid” as the recipe directs!  In addition to doubling the remaining ingredients for my 3-pound roast, I added a teaspoon each of Mexican oregano and salt, and a good handful each of chopped Poblano peppers and onions.  Since it would spend 8-10 hours in the Crock Pot, I skipped the marinating process, simply putting all ingredients in the Crock Pot from the start.  This was excellent; tho’ I must stress that the oil can/should be eliminated and only use half as much stock so you don’t need to discard any!  I used this to make shredded beef enchiladas and we both loved it and are looking forward to enjoying this once again as tacos.

Absolutely excellent!  So tender and the favor was perfect!  I only had time to marinate for an hour, and it still turned out great.

Wow! After making this recipe I will never go back to ground beef tacos again! The meat came out so tender and moist and the flavor was excellent. I marinated it overnight following the marinade exactly as written in the recipe. When I baked it in the oven, I used a can of beef broth instead of beef stock. Looking forward to making it again for company - it's a keeper!

My sons favorite meal is tacos so he was hesitant, but I make this in my crockpot.   Wrap up the beef with marinade in foil, not necessary to marinate ahead, and put the whole thing in my crock.  Cook 8 hrs. on low, then remove beef and shred, put back in crock with juices and serve.  It is delicious, easy and great left overs. We top with a slaw of shredded cabbage, tossed with red wine vinegar, a dash of sugar, salt and chili powder to taste.  Easy delicious meal, easy clean up.

Made this tonight, and the only thing my husband said once he cleaned his plate was, "Whatever you did to the meat, do it again." I'd say it was a success!

Best shredded beef tacos I've made. Making them again for the second time tonight. I added more spices (onion powder, ground caynne, salt, pepper, ground oregano, smoke paprika, and a  little of Spikes all purpose seasoning.)Added 2teaspoon of the spices instead of 1 and a half expect with the cayenne I used a bit more. I also added a bit more lime juice and vinegar. I opt out using oil and marinated the beef chunks for about 3 hours. I browned the beef chunks on the stove before cooking it in the oven. I also made homemade glaucoma to pour on top.

I HAVE to tell you... I made this today... as I do with most recipes, I changed it up... but just a bit... added twice the amt of lime and vinegar...added more of the spices...browned the 1 in cuts of meat before I put them in the oven w the marinade and beef broth......I put the shredded meat on toasted corn torillas... with some diced avocado, shredded cheddar and tomatilla salsa.... THEY WERE FABULOUS... the lime hit you smack in the face.... my husband who is SO spoiled when it comes to food told me they were great!  THANKS

Like another reviewer, I used my crockpot, so I omitted the oil. I used Bud Light Lime (1 cup...darn had to drink the rest, lol), a quartered lime, thin sliced pablano pepper and onion. AMAZING! I love street style tacos and this was perfect for that. We used corn tortillas and all the fixins. Will definitely do this again.

I loved the simplicity of this, and the beef was tender.  I just thought it was lacking a little zing.  I will definetly make it again, just might tweek it a little to add a bit more flavor.  Thanks for sharing..

Not only did the house smell good, my tummy felt good and my man said 10 out of 10...I'm only afraid I might have to make this every night;) (Also make sure you watch timing of beef pending your oven 2 1/2 might be too much)

I agree, add some oregano and no vegetable oil needed when using chuck roast or stew meat.  Made mine in the crockpot, easy breezy, and served "taco salad" style.  Crisped a 10" flour tortilla in a 425 deg oven, draped over a pam-sprayed cereal bowl to create the salad shell.  Then put in lettuce, diced fresh tomatoes, salsa, the meat, squeeze of fresh lime and topped with shredded cheese (any kind you like).  This plus a margarita or two, and it's like you're sitting in your favorite mex restaurant...big hit with DH also...will make a double batch next time for leftovers.

I put this together on Saturday night so that it could marinade overnight. Turned out great, we used as the centerpiece of our stay-at-home football tailgating on Sunday. It went over big. Next time, I will use a bit more lime and garlic, but that's just my taste.

Loved it very easy to do as the slow cooker does all the work as I don’t like to be in the kitchen long periods of time making a dish makes for great in between meals snack food to hold you over to the next meal next time though I have to hike up the spiciness to make it a bit hotter
