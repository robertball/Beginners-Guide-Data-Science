This looks intimidating, but it really is easy - and delicious. Of course. I've probably made about twenty Chef John recipes and every single one is amazing.

I replaced the buttermilk with the same amount of half and half, ditched the lemon (mostly because I didn't have any), and added way more vanilla and boy was it delicious! Perfectly creamy, it was refreshing and easy, just like advertised!

This was delicious! Made this for a dinner gathering and my guests loved it.

I used gelatin sheets as that was all that was available in the store. If you're making it the night before (highly recommended), then 4 to 5 gelatin sheets should do the trick. 

I placed the finished mixture into small coffee mugs to refrigerate. When it was time to serve them, I warmed them up VERY briefly (otherwise if you warm them up for too long, they'll turn back into their liquid state), flipped them onto a plate and sprinkled mint leaves, berries and maple syrup on top. It was great!

P.S if you're wondering what to do with the leftover buttermilk, you could always substitute sour cream for buttermilk when baking. I did that with a banana bread recipe and it was the best I've ever had!

Awesome! First try I used the suggested amount of sugar and for the 2nd try I used about 1/3 cup sugar. Both were great. For flavouring , I used the lemon peel, vanilla but also cardamom.  Wonderful recipe!

I loved this recipe. Panna Cotta can be so rich it is cloying; the small amount of buttermilk and lemon in this one makes all the difference!

This is a great, simple recipe!  I stuck it in the fridge at 4:00 PM and it was ready to serve at 6:30.  My wife loved it because it wasn't overly sweet, which she hates.  I followed Chef John's instructions to the letter, perfection!  Next time I might add a little brandy for additional flavor.  Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Extremely easy and quick to make. My kids made it mostly by themselves. Delicious.

Quite easy recipe and tastes absolutely great. Got requests to make it for multiple occasions, the last one being a friend's wedding. 16 servings were gone in no time. Love this recipe and will definitely make it again.

I made this for Mother's Day luncheon and it was a complete success! Even my hubby who normally never has dessert loved it and asked for it again with Father's day dinner.
So simple to make. The hardest part about making panna cotta is the patience to let it set up!

I really really enjoyed it.  It's rich and creamy, but light and refreshing.  I thought it was particularly delicious with some honey and mint sprinkled on top.  Will actually be making it for friends this weekend.  I thought it was super easy to make too!

This recipe is a keeper.

I happened to catch The Chew one day and they made a maple syrup Panna Cotta which sounded delicious so I searched Allrecipes and saw Chef John one. As a huge Chef John fan, I had to make this one instead.  I usually have a 5 star experience with his recipes, but sadly that did not happen with this one. I watched the video and he did say it was ok to swap out the dairy product so in an effort to cut calories, I used half and half instead of heavy cream. Other than that, I followed the directions. When I got to the straining part, my concoction just sat in the strainer. About a tablespoon of clearish liquid dripped out so I just fished out the lemon peel and whisked the liquid back in then poured into Pyrex dishes. It started to separate immediately and got worse as it cooled. I still covered and put in the fridge overnight. My husband took one bite of the top creamy layer and spit it out. It was horrible. The consistency was gritty. I took a taste of both the top and the clear bottom layer and both were un-eatable. A couple of nights later, I  tried Clinton Kelly’s recipe where the gelatin was sprinkled directly onto the cream and it also did not require straining. It was awesome. I did some research and seems using anything other than heavy cream can be tricky and more prone to separation. I don’t know if I’d try this again because if the half and half wouldn’t strain, I don’t see how even heavier cream would strain?

Delicious! I made three batches, so the second batch I used orange instead, and the third was almond cardamom. All were yummy!
