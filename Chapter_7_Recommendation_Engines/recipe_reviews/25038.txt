Definitely the very best chocolate chip cookie around--one that I've been making for many years.  I've made these so often (because they're that good), with all kinds of variations for the chocolate chips, that I don't even need to refer to the recipe anymore. The reason these are called "Jumbo," however, is because they are supposed to be dropped by 1/4 cupfuls, which produces a beautiful cookie with an entirely different and better texture. Also, use 1/4 cup less all-purpose flour and add 1/2 tsp. salt!

these cookies are huge hard puffs of flavorless cake.  if you dare to try this terrible recipe, try it using less baking powder.

This is the absolute best recipe for Chocolate Chip cookies I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out soft, chewy, and delicious.  I might add a little more vanilla next time, but that's not a complaint!  I'll only ever make this recipe again!!

Great recipe!  I was looking for a cookie recipe to use the new Kissables candy in and this worked great.  Only used 1 cup each sugar because I knew the candies were so sweet.  Tried it again later on that week using 1 cup Skor pieces, 1 cup pecans which was also magnificent.  Delightfully chewy inside. I also used a little less flour on each batch as the dough was getting a little thick.  This will be my cookie recipe from now on.

This is the only chip cookie recipe that I will be using from now on.  They were SOOO good.  I made the cake flour by removing 2 TBSP of the flour in that one cup and replacing it with cornstarch, then sifting several times.  When I used milk chocolate chips, I reduced the sugars to 1 cup each, but the semi-sweet got 1 1/4 cups each.  I used 1/2 cup crunchy peanut butter and peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips in one batch and in a different batch, I used butterscotch chips and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I could do no wrong with these cookies.  I gave out cookie plates to all my neighbors and they raved over them.  The ones I made for my family were gone long before they had a chance to go stale.  

One neighbor's comment:  "These are DUNKIN' COOKIES!"

Great recipe!

This is now my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I also used Heath Bar pieces and everyone raved.  I thought the cake flour might make them cakey, but they were just the opposite - soft and chewy, exactly the way I like them.  Just be sure not to overbake!

This has been a five-star recipe for me forever. I cut the cookie size by half and sell them and have been so successful with this recipe, no other. 
Thanks for putting this on the web, Lilly

This recipe makes the most chewy cookies I've ever had... however, I found that I needed to reduce the flour and up the wet ingredients to get them that way. The first time I did this recipe, I got a really cake like cookie that didn't spread at all on the pan. I was surprised by that given how much butter is in this recipe. Plus, it took forever to incorporate the flour into the wets. 

But by cutting out the 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, and using extra large eggs, the cookies spread, the sugar dissolved completely in the cookie, and they were much more chewy with a crisper exterior... Lovely.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and these were very good the first day.  On the second day they were dry and hard even though I stored in an air tight container.  A piece of bread added to the container helped, but was still not satisfied with the way they stored.  Probably will not use this recipe again

Everyone at home and work loves these cookies. I always make them big, at least a tbs. just like the recipe calls for. I do sub white choc. chips, and or M&M's. Always come out slightly cakey yet a bit chewy.

Like other reviews said, the dough was dry, I had to form little balls with my hands and even then they fell apart. I assumed they would flatten out during baking but they did not. They extremely hard and milk does NOT help. I will never make this recipe again.

This recipe is amazing, soooo easy to make and yet the perfect balance of soft and chewy. I recommend trying it with a mixture of white, milk and plain chocolate chips as it adds some variety.I'm so excited about it that I had to tell you all now...my 2nd batch is still in the oven!

I give this recipe 4 stars! I followed your directions except I didn't have enough butter so I used 1 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of softned butter and they still turned out great! The only reason I put 4 stars is because my cookies were baked to perfection at 375 degrees for only 10 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes! Thanks for sharing your recipe! Its a keeper! :)

Thses cookies look great, but the taste is lacking.  I think adding salt or using salted butter would help.

The basic recipe is excellent, but agreed, it is a bit dry. Add an extra egg and 1/4 cup of butter flavored Crisco or butter and it solves the problem.  These turned out to excellent cookies.  Made them for a charity bake sale and sold out! Certainly boosted my baking reputation!

These cookies were Ok.  Definitely did not look like the picture.  I was wanting a big thick cookie and it came out flat.  Disappointed.

I thought they were average cookies. I don't know if I would even call them chewy and once they cooled they seemed exactly like the tollhouse bag recipe on the chips. Good just not what I was hoping for BUT did give me a couple starts on a new cookie recipe

these cookies were pretty good! They were a tad bit dry but that could have been my fault. Overall, worth trying!

These cookies are SUPER yummy! A little crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I cooked them for 12 mins, which was perfect! Any longer and I think they would have been crispy all the way through, which I didn't want.

INCREDIBLE cookie! I am so, so pleased with how this turned out! Perfectly chewy and a little crunch... pack with chocolate chips and definitely add the walnuts if you can! Wow. This has been a huge hit--a new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! It reminds me of the expensive cookies you get at check-in at DoubleTree hotels! So excited to make again!  **Pretty much same recipe as the Land O' Lakes recipe. It's a huge hit when I make with M&Ms **Update 4/26/13: Followed Naples review of reducing AP flour by 1/2 cup and added salt. These bake up SO beautifully as JUMBO cookies! I am excited to share with the neighbors :)

I make these cookies all the time! They are scrum-diddly-ump-tious! Soft and chewy and plump! I add mini m&m's to the batter. It makes them look pretty and it makes them more chocolatly! DON'T OVERBAKE!!  I take mine out after 12 minutes to keep them ultra soft! Enjoy!

My husband and I had a blast making these! We had so much left over!! We had to give some to neighbors and friends, who all agreed they were wonderful! We added vanilla ice cream and drizzled chocolate sauce and added cherries to the final piece and had a great dessert while watching movies at home last night. WONDERFUL! Thanks so much for sharing this!

The dough was great! It was the perfect texture and sweetness. Unfortunately, the cookie didn't bake that way. The cookies came out incredibly flat and cracked all over the top. The edges were very crispy and the middles were wet. In general, it wasn't a good cookie. I'll never be making these again.

6/13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25038/chewy-jumbo-chocolate-chip-cookies/ ... K 14 & Joni 15 made these & they were very good, not soft & chewy as the reviewer states; but may just be a time issue.  These were crisp, but not hard.  'Usually prefer softer, chewy ones; but these are good,  Crisp like bakery - a real bakery - crisp.  Yum.  Later: It is a time issue - if you prefer soft & chewy.  Less time or a lower oven.  I baked mine, after refrigerating dough, at 350 for 10 - 12.  You need to let them sit on the sheet as it says.   They're very soft until they cool.  Oh, the girls used regular flour & the same amount & it was fine. 'Coulda used less minichips, maybe 1 1/2c instead of 2 - probably just for mini ones. 7/13 Good/bad news: Soft, yummy; but kind gets to be like cookiedoughish.  Not meaning it doughsup, but had enough before they were gone.  'Good once in a while, but I think I like my regular one better. 5/14 'Still a good review.  These are more rich than most.  They have more fat = the rich texture = buttery feel.  They're more bakery-looking, no browned edges when they're done.  Good taste & appearance, but re-enforced my opinion that my other recipe is better - to me.

I really liked this recipe.  The ingredients were dry and it took a little longer preparing on cookie sheet but the cookies came out puffy and moist.  I don't like overly sweet chocolate chip cookies so this recipes was awesome!  Thank you!

I can't say I don't recommend this recipe, but I definately don't recommend ME using this recipe.  The dough was dry and crumbly.  I had to form the dough into balls with my hands to put the clumps onto the pan.  The cookies did not spread out while baking them. They stayed the same ball shape that they were when I first put them in the oven.  Maybe it's not the recipe, maybe the user - but I won't be recommending this one.

These turned out looking beautiful, but not very flavorful. Certainly not bad though! I was going to give this a three, but I realize that the reason for the cakiness may have been my fault. I substituted a cup of all purpose flour (as I had no cake flour) for the cup of cake flour. From what I have since learned, if you must substitute all purpose for cake flour, to measure a cup minus two tablespoons (I also saw suggestions to add 2 tbsp. cornstarch). This being said, these weren't particularly sweet or flavorful either. If I were to make these again, I would first take heed of the cake flour and perhaps add more vanilla or brown sugar.

Great recipe. I  did not have cake flour, so i substituted with regular white flour, and the cookies turned out great. They are heavy, chewy, and moist. I removed them from the oven while they are still slightly doughey and when they cool, they are chewy and delicious.

I sub-ed shortening for all the butter. As well as doubled the recipe.  The mix came out good, but too thick, maybe if I had used a cup less flour, or so?  The cookies are moist on the inside, and crispy (sure to the shortening)on the outside, Had to increase baking time to about 12 minutes.  Next time, I'll try the exact recipe and see if I like them better.  (I didn't have any butter to use)
Thanks!

Hmm, mine did not turn out chewy at all. They were pretty cakey and not that sweet, either. I halved the recipe since I only had about a cup of chips but that shouldn't have changed anything. Oh well.

I have been looking for a recipe like this. I followed the recipe, but substituted 1/4 c wheat germ for 1/4 c reg. flour (to make me feel better?!) I lightly packed a 1/4 c measuring cup and placed 6 cookies per sheet. They turned out superb! I can only imagine that the one bad review was because of altitude or perhaps substituting margarine for butter.

These were amazing! I scooped them out by 1/4 cup fulls instead of tablespoons and they came out huge, soft and chewy. They weren't too sweet or rich but satisfied my sweet tooth perfectly. Will definitely make again.

Finally! A superb chewy chocolate chip cookie! This is, by far, the absolute best chewy cookie recipe I've tried. And I have pretty much tried them all.  I was a little concerned when I saw how thick the dough was, but not to worry, they baked up fine. I did bake them 10 minutes (not less as some recommend) and they came out perfect! When I tasted the first cookie I couldn't believe how chewy they were, not just soft, but chewy. LOVE THIS RECIPE!

These were pretty good. We are still looking for a really chewy cookie- haven't found it yet. Good but not chewy.

I loved this recipe! The first time I made these cookies I think I ate more dough then actual cookies, but both the dough and cookies were delicious. They don't flatten much in the oven, so make sure to flatten them a little beforehand, and they don't taste too good if overcooked, so take them out about a minute before the recipe says and let them cool for a while.
Hope everyone likes them as much as I do!

these cookies were only chewy for the first day.  You need to take them out of the oven when they do not look done.  I will continue to look for a better recipe.

Made these twice now, and I loved them both times. I've never been able to achieve a chewy cookie with other recipes. Just be sure not to overbake them. Remove from oven just before done and let cool on cookie sheet. I substitued applesauce for about 1/3 of the butter the second time, and they still tasted great--though they weren't quite as puffy. Myhusband and his crew devored them.

I used this recipe for a large cookie for a birthday party and it was fabulous.

Very soft, yet chewy.  I was careful not to overbake.

Loved it!!!

Really enjoy the outcome of this, definitely a go-to recipe for me. My dad and i both prefer chewy vs crispy, and this delivers for me. A couple of times i've noticed that after you mix in the flour it gets very dry, this does go away with thorough mixing, so keep at it with the elbow grease!

I liked this recipe but I will stick with the Nestle recipe instead. I love vanilla and I always use extra but seeing this one had a Tbsp. I did not use any additional and to meet it was too much. The dough however cooks up nicely but cost wise you are using more flour.

The best cookie ever! Crisp edges and chewy inside. I followed another reviewer's tip about cutting out 1/4 cup of all purpose flour. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of some of the all-purpose flour too. Also cut the sugars down to 1 cup each, as I used chopped milk chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate. I think you would need a bit more than 2 cups of chocolate in-between all the cookies. I also only made 40 cookies, but each cookie being bigger meant that it was chewier too. I baked my cookies for 12 minutes. I like how the recipe specifies to let the cookies cool on the baking sheet. That probably improved the texture of the cookie- the residual heat helped make the outside crisp. Have already saved this recipe and will make again and again!

I have made this recipe for five years for the officials and press members at a local district wrestling tournament.  Every year, the people can't wait for me to make the cookies again.  If I had a nickel for everyone who asked me about this recipe, I would be rich!  They are a complete hit!  Note:  They are best when eaten within a day or two of baking them.

I do believe these are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! My grocery was out of cake flour so I just used regular unbleached, then I substituted coconut oil for 1/2 cup of the butter. Mine were jumbo, about 2 1/2 TBLS of dough per cookie. Perefct!

I am a chef always looking for new cookie recipes and I found these to be bland, not sweet enough. They were also NOT chewy and not really all that soft. I give them a poor rating.

These are GREAT!  Very simple to make & came out delicious.  I used Valentine colored M&Ms & took them to work – they were gone in no time.  These would be great with a variety of different flavor chocolate chips, planning to use peanut-butter & dark chocolate next time.

Perfect recipe for a beginner. Came out great the first time I made them.  I agree that it needs that extra vanilla extract.  And the reviews about taking it out and not overbaking were so helpful it kept it chewy.  Thanks for the  recipe it helped to build my confidents and can't wait to experiment and try other recipes

Although I'd rate this recipe with a "5" for flavor, I had to give them a "3" for chewiness. They WERE chewy in the center.....if only you could bite through the very hard outside of the cookie. My jaw still hurts!  If I were to make these again ---and I think I'll give 'em another try--- I'd probably take them out of the oven just before the edges got light brown, and/or I might use less flour. An added note: don't snack on the chocolate chips before you add them to the dough; 2 cups is just right. Also, use a large bowl 'cuz there's a lot of dough. I got 48 2" cookies out of this recipe.

My new favorite!!  I was looking for a recipe for chewy cookies for my husband and these certainly fit the bill!!  So soft and delicious and a hit with my cookie-snob of a husband!  These cookies will be my go-to cookies from now on.

I made this recipe and was disappointed.  The cookies came out like normal chocolate chip cookies, they were not chewy and soft like I expected.  I will continue to use my old tried and true recipe since I like the flavor of the cookies from it better.
