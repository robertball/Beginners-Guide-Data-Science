I LOVED THESE!! Just make sure you use half the 
salt that the recipe called for. I also did half vegetable oil, and half butter..and the recipe was even better than the first time I made them. These have a big chocolatey taste. A tall glass of milk, and a little caramel and chocolate syrup on top made these brownies even more heavenly! Try'em!

These turned out perfectly, and I didn't even have any vanilla! I haven't made brownies before so I was scared to take them out at the suggested time as it was so liquidy, I left them in a tad too long, the inside was perect however the top was bit thick and crusty. My boyfriend ate them all in 2 days!!

I was looking for a brownie recipe that didn't need butter (I had none and I'm stuck home in a snowstorm!).  This was it.  I have to say these came out "OK" but weren't great.  Definitely too much oil.  I beat my eggs with the oil for about 2 minutes and I think that helped keep it from separating while cooking (I didn't have pools of oil like other reviewers).  But after these cooled and set they are still just too oily for my taste.  I added some chocolate chips and I think that helped with the flavor because they are otherwise kind of bland.  BUT - it satisfied a craving when our pantry was very low stocked.  If you have access to more ingredients, there are definitely better recipes out there.

I took the advice of other reviewers and only used one cup of oil and one teaspoon of salt. I also used this recipe to introduce my "tween" son to Cooking 101 since the ingredients were simple and easy to measure. The brownies turned out marvelous and my son was proud of his creation.

This recipe was really easy and good. It was too salty for me and my family, so next time I will probably cut the salt in half. It is very oily, so if you're watching fat grams or cholesterol, I would keep on looking.

First let me say I went right by the recipe, it was horrible. There was so much oil that it couldn't mix in right. I poured it in the pan and there were pools of oil around the edges. I tried to bake it to see if maybe That's just how this recipe works and stayed liquified the whole time. I even tried to blot out the oil like you do with greasy pizza and a napkin and it never baked. I finally took it out of the oven and now that it's cooled off it's hard as a brick. I have no idea why this happened, I doubled checked the recipe repeatedly and this is not my first time in the kitchen.

Sorry, but I didn't like these much at all. Mainly because they were soooo oily. They left oil in the pan, oil in the box I stored them in after cutting them up, and the paper towels I separated layers of brownies in became saturated with oil after a while. Even then, eating several brownies, I could taste lots of oil. I'm wondering if the "1 1/2 cups" of oil were a miswriting of "one half-cup". Besides that, they weren't all that chocolaty. On the other hand, I shared some with 3 friends who said they were good (one of whom said she enjoyed another the next day with her morning coffee). And a fourth friend liked the first brownie so much that she asked for the recipe and I gave her the last brownie. So mixed reviews over here, but personally I give this only 2 stars out of 5.

This recipe was good. It got better once it cooled a bit. I put less salt. I thought it could taste more like chocolate though.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  I baked it and cut a corner out to teste it.  I was absolutely amazed!  The edges were crisp and dry like a box brownie is.  It was firm and held together, but still unbelievably moist.  I brought it to work and they were absolutely inhaled!  I shared the recipe with a few co-workers as a matter of fact.  (Can't understand how it was too salty for some... mine was perfect)

My husband & kids love these brownies!  They are cake-like, not chewy or gooey, which he prefers.  I added walnuts to them, about 3/4 cup.  Love it!!!

I took a risk making these brownies based on the very mixed reviews. I don't bake a lot and was looking for a brownie recipe without vanilla extract because I didn't have any on hand. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and half the salt, and while I found the brownies were very moist and the texture was good, the taste was quite bland. I even added chocolate chips and drizzled caramel over them, and this didn't help very much. It's a good base for a brownie but next time, I'll be adding a teaspoon or two of vanilla for more flavor.

Very dissapointed with this recipe. Way too OILY. I would cut the amount of oil in half if I ever repeat this recipe... but I don't think that'll happen! The taste was basic. Nothing special. I bet if I searched harder I could have found a better brownie recipe... Ahhh!! As I said, very dissapointing.

Very easy recipe to follow, good taste and texture, extremely popular with youngsters as a treat. Though only half the amonut of salt was needed, as suggested in previous review. Thankyou

WOW! This is exactly what the chocolate doctor ordered! These are chewy in the middle, crispy on the outside and full of chocolately goodness! And, they are made with what I usually have on hand in the pantry! I made two small adjustments; I added another 1/4 cup of cocoa...and I added a good slurp of vanilla.  And had I read a previous reviewer, I also would have cut the salt to one teaspoon.  All things considered a fantastic basic brownie recipe that makes a good sized pan of very delicious brownies!

I tried this recipe because I am not a baker--and this looked super easy.  However, after beating the eggs and oil together, I begin to add the dry ingredients and the batter became so thick it BROKE my hand mixer after only 1 cup!  After double and triple checking my ingredients, I ended up adding an extra egg and 1/4 C. water to the mix.  It was still not as creamy as it should be.  I have no idea what I did wrong but I will probably not make again.  I will post a picture after they are done baking.

These are great brownies.  They are chewy inside and crunchy outside.  I used slightly less oil and half the salt and they turned out fine.  I actually kind of enjoyed the saltiness as it complimented the sweetness of the ice cream. Yum!

I was so disappointed with these brownies!  I chose to make these because I had all the ingredients in my cupboard.  I tasted the batter and found it to be terribly bland, so I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, which punched it up a bit.  Unfortunately, they were so oily that they were completely inedible.  Very sad!

These were really yummy brownies. They reminded me of brownies I ate as a kid.  Very traditional recipe.  Thanks!

Not as good as I had hoped. These were very cake like and had very little flavour. I would strongly recommend using chocolate in this recipe to make them taste more like actual brownies.

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made 3 different variations of this now and it has never gone wrong. The first time I added butter instead of oil and they turned out light and great! The second time I added chocolate chips in the batter, melted chocolate alongside the cocoa powder and added peanut butter on top for some peanut butter swirl brownies. Yesterday I added 2tbsps of Coffee in a bit of hot water and added that to the batter and added 2tbspns more of cocoa powder and made a batch of 10 servings and they turned out amazing.

My husband always requests for this recipe and he almost always finishes the brownies in a day or two.

I just made these. I hate greasy brownies, so I followed advice from others and cut the oil in half to 3/4 c. oil and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. I added 2 tsp. vanilla just because I like vanilla with chocolate. I cooked it 25 min. but it was gooey in the middle so next time I will bake it 30 min. The edges were so yummy. Will make these again.

The taste was a bit too oily for me, but after reading the reviews of others I'm going to give it another shot with less oil and some butter instead. Maybe add some chocolate pieces as well.

I cut the recipe in 1/2 (10 servings)with the exception of the oil, which I only added 1/2 cup of that. 
Then I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of vanilla flavored coffee (room temp).  And I baked it in a 8x8 pan for 20 min.

It turned out great!  I will make this again for sure.

very irritated by this recipe.  there was so much oil, i had to make a 2nd batch just to mix together with the first one!  then it wasn't even close to being baked in 25 mins.  it took 35 minutes(and that's w a new range) to bake it.  once they were actually done and cooled, they did pass the taste test.  i don't mind macgyver style baking, but it is annoying to go to a site to find recipes and have them be completely wrong.  my rating is solely based on the written recipe, not the finished product.  done correctly, these brownies are great and i'd recommend them to everyone.

These were very blah and not worth the calories! I wish I had read other reviewers first but went ahead because I had all the ingredients on hand. It was an oily mess that baked up looking like they would be great but tasted bland and not enough chocolate flavor at all. My daughter(who eats any sweet made) suggested we throw them out! Move on to a better recipe in the future.

I would rate this lower if I could.  I left out some of the oil as suggested and even with that change, they were an oily blob as a dough - you wouldn't even need to grease the pan, I swear!! After cooked, they looked like brownies but they were nearly inedible.  Tasteless, unless you count grease.  You'd have to ice these to make them better and even then, it's not worth it.  I wish I would have listened to the reviewer that told me to move on to another recipe!  Sorry!

These definitely didn't turn out how I expected.  There was so much oil that they came out tough on the inside and crispy on the outside.  They were not soft and chewy at all.  They were not very sweet and you could taste the salt and baking powder.

I'd like to give this 3.5, but oh well. These were pretty tasty... but all I can smell is all of the OIL that went into them! No chocolatey aroma that's usually present when I make brownies... just oil. Granted, I was trying to find a recipe that didn't call for butter since I was out, but still. Anyway, the brownies themselves weren't too incredibly oily... it was just a weird disconnect between the oil smell in the air and the taste, which was actually pretty good. The texture was just right, and I baked them for about 25 minutes. I also added some caramel on top after they'd been cooking for a few minutes, and swirled it in. I followed other users' recommendations and used less salt.

I made these once for a school project and didnt think they'd be too good with all the oil. i was wrong. VERY good texture but only use half the salt and cut down on the oil a bit. i added ghirardelli chocolate chips and the taste was vverry satisfying.

I don’t think it’s the ingredients but the order in which u put it together. I beat the eggs then added the oil and beat to an emulsion(don’t over beat it makes it worse) then added the sugar til it became ribbonlike, meaning that u drag a spoon across the batter it will leave a trail for a few seconds. Then u sift in the dry ingredients making sure u blended all the dry before hand. Then stir til combined well. Then baked at 350. Nothing was oily, greasy, or runny. Baking is a balance u can mix too little and things separate but u can over mix and end up with shoe leather. I hope someone finds this helpful

they taste okay but I cooked it for a total of 28 minutes and it's still not done, the middle because of how much oil is in it it's barley cooked in the middle. I would never make this recipe ever again.

Quick, easy and everything that I needed was right there in my pantry!  I made this recipe omitting the sugar and substituting Splenda due to a dietary need in my family.  After having read the reviews I uses less oil than called for.  It worked!  The brownies were excellent!  The best part of it was that we all were able to enjoy an old favorite.

I made these brownies for my son's birthday, and they were incredibly oily. The top didn't get that nice crust that we're so used to. Everyone had heartburn afterward. Would not make again.

This was awful! Never, ever make this recipe. I rarely leave bad reviews, but this was bad. It was WAY too oily, and after one bite you just wanted to spit it out. If there was 0 stars, I would use it.

It tastes like oil, I think it was too much oil for this. I don't like it. But looks good anyway.

I made it according to directions. It took between 40-45 minutes to be done though. Aside from that, it turned out great. I will be making these on a regular basis from now on. This is very easy recipe.

Good basic recipe for brownies with a little tweaking. I did take the suggestions of the other reviewers and put half the oil and salt. I also used 3/4 cup of cocoa, 1/4 cup of water, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also sprinkled them with powdered sugar. They turned out very good. I am glad I did not use too much oil.

I went by the recipe...YUCK! They were greasy, bitter, salty, & grainy.  It's like the ingredients didn't mix.  Never making these agin!  I'm only giving this recipe 1 star because I'm required to at least give it that much, but as far as I'm concerned...NO stars!

I added half   the oil added a half cup of peanut butter and added vanilla, skipped the salt because of the PB. ok and oddly enough I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Its not that I didn't like the original recipe, I just can't leave a recipe alone!
Thank you for the basics which I played around with! Next time I think I will cut about1/4 cup of the flour.

Super yummy! A little oily for my taste, but still yummy. I put the batter in two different 9' by 9', one a little thicker than the other. Two different sizes for two different tastes!

they worked out great, but they were really hard to mix even with an electric mixer, due to the large amounts of powder and little liquid so I just added 2 tbsp. of milk and one tbsp. of melted butter and they were perfect!

After a day the brownies had settled better but when they were first made the middle would not fully solidify so they were hard to cut and serve. They taste great, but the texture needs some work.

I could taste the salt in these, but I rarely use much salt. next time I will cut it down a little but they were good. I thought they might be oily when done, they were not at all. I will try some different variations of it to cut out some of the oil though, to make them less fatty. These are ones that you do not want to over cook. I took them out as soon as the tops were crusted and non oily looking.

I think this is the best brownie recipe ever. I don't like trying other recipes because it is so good. I also tried what the other comments said but when I only put 1 cup of oil in it wasn't  enough and when I put one teaspoon of salt it didn't taste as good.

I made these for the second time. This time I used 1/2c less oil and added 1/4c cocoa. I also added some chocolate chips for a little something extra. The brownies tasted much better. They were not bad in the first place but were not as flavorful as I would have liked. I don't remember then being greasy the first time but they were super messy to cut. This time they cut perfect, had a better flavor and we did not notice anything missing with less oil. My boys liked them!

Made these and used a glass pan, forgot to grease.  They turned out fine.  The also kept falling apart and got hard after 20 minutes.  I used canola oil for them and not vegetable oil. They were great after I frosted them. Very easy to make.  I will definitely be making these again.

I needed a brownie recipe without butter, so I gave these a try. These tasted great but were a runny mess due to too much oil in the recipe. After 30 minutes I took them out of the oven but they didn't seem really done. I probably won't fool with making them again. My family did eat them up, though!

I used only one cup of vegetables oil instead of one and a half. The brownies turned out pretty good. however, they were not chocolaty enough and needed more sugar. They also required more cooking time than stated in the directions. If I make them again, I would change a few minor things.

Overall, the brownies were ok.

I tried this recipe 3 times now the first 2 times came out gooey and crisp around the edges but a bit grainy cause of the sugar made them a third time and did the eggs oil and this time mixed the sugar in with the oil and eggs before the flour mixture baked them and they came out more like a cake brownie can anybody tell me why this happened please ?

I loved them. They were absolutely amazing. If you are using coconut oil in place of the butter. Use the less oil than butter or add the half c. of flour.This is a definite for next brownie!

Most brownies are rocks the next day but these were great! Soft and chewy with that thin flaky top. I only had a cup of sugar so I used a cup of white and a cup of brown sugar. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because they kind of tasted like blondies (vanilla brownies).. it definitely wasnt choclate-y but I still liked them.

Nice flavor, but the oil just oozes out from the brownie when you chew!  But my 5 year old loved them.  She said they were better than the cake-type I usually bake.

This tastes awful! It's drowning in oil and I used less than the recipe recommended, it also doesn't cook through and is burnt on the top and liquid underneath, it also isn't as chocolatey as a brownie should be

I used half the oil and half the salt, as PEEKATRONE suggested. This made them very hard to get from the bowl to the pan, but it they are very good, and use no butter! :)

These brownies were pretty good. We followed some of the other reviews and used less salt, less oil and we put in a little bit of vanilla.

Seasonal adjustments - I used this as my base recipe.  I substituted 1/2 cup of vegetable oil with non-fat pumpkin greek yogurt.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa, added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and then added a cup of mixed milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The baking time increased to about 30 minutes (probably the yogurt and the melted chips).  They were a hit!

I picked this recipe because it only had a few ingredients and I wanted to make something sweet for my husband even though the pantry is looking pretty pathetic.   I made the following changes:  I halved the salt as recommended by other reviewers.  I used self rising flour (all I had on hand), so I skipped the baking powder.  I added a capful of vanilla extract.  I used Canola oil instead of Vegetable.  I have to say that the amount of oil was a little alarming as was the sugar, but nobody said they were supposed to be healthy.  I baked them in a greased (cooking spray) 9x13 glass baking dish for 50 minutes.   Final thought: They were pretty good. I liked the chewy/crunchy outside, but the inside was a little too cake-like. (Which could be my fault due to the self rising flour.) ... They didn't have a strong chocolate taste to me but they were good.

I used 1C oil and 1tsp salt... I also added 1/4ts vanilla and a dash or two of cinnamon. They were really good! However I can see why most say they're too oily- there is no way I'd eat these with the oil amt called for in the recipe. I also had to cook them about 15 extra minutes- but I used a 9x9 dish. They were worth the calories in the end :)

Oily and cake-like, could be more chocolate tasting, but an easy, quick recipe with readily available ingredients for when the baking urge hits. I used peanut oil and hazelnut cocoa, and very much enjoyed this recipe. The brownies stayed moist, and it was certainly non-stick! Next time, I'll replace some of the oil with melted butter to get a richer flavor. (Yes, I'm one of those improve types).

These brownies were really wonderful. I agree with other reviewers, it is best to cut back on the salt and the oil, but if you do that then you'll get brownies with a fantastic chocolate flavor :)

Like others I made these because I had all the ingredients by hand. They were okay. I found them to be too oily. I used very little salt. Next time I will try adding some vanilla, chocolate chips, and cut down on the oil. I might also add a package of pudding mix in to compensate for the oil cut (it will help keep it most) and to give it a bit more richness.

These are great. I put the brownie batter into small muffin molds, so they resemble the brownies that you buy at the store. You can eat them in one bite, they are sooo good.

texture is nice, easy to whip up, but a bit too oily and the flavor is lacking a bit for me...i'd recommend adding chocolate chips to help that out.  dont forget to cut the salt in half, i'll cut down on the oil as well next time.  i'd make again though.  leftover pieces will go into homemade vanilla ice cream for my husband.  yum!

I give these a 3 because my kids ate them-not sure why they did tho. I read the reviews but missed the part about using less salt-perhaps someone needs to change this in the actual recipe-they were way to salty! It was like chocolate with a bitter-salty after taste :( They had a crispy sugary coating on top and were cake-like-good for those who like it :) I also found them to be a bit too oily as well--maybe lessen the oil by a tad bit.

A great treat to which I usually add 2 bars of hershey milk chocolate bars for an extra rich texture.  I've even doubled the recipe with great results.  After the brownies have cooled they really get a nice crust.
