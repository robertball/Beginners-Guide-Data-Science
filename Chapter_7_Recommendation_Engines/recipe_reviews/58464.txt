As a South African I am familiar with what this should taste like and it is close, but not quite.  The sugar syrup should be a 2:1 sugar:water mix and should be double this quantity as this is usually a thick and syrupy liqueur. I ended up using 3 cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cups of water. With that amendment it was spot on.

This was a hit at my African Dinner Party.  I used teh cheapest brandy that I could find and it taste great.
