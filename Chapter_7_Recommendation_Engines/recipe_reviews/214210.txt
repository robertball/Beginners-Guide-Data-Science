Oh My Gosh!!!  This recipe is wonderful!  My husband loves rum cake and brownies so this is the best of both worlds.  I did make a couple changes NOT by choice by accident - I put too much rum in the raisins so I added about 1/4 more flour and it was marvelous.

Wow! what a wonderful combination.   I have a husband who loves rum so this is heaven - even with vanilla icecream.  Could cut flour back by a tbsp. for a less cakey texture.

This is more cake than brownie.  I omitted the nuts because I was unsure of allergies.  I frosted them with Rum buttercream icing.  Oh, my!

Meh.  I hate when a new recipe with a non traditional way of preparation uses expensive ingredients and turn out meh.  These were not cake-y for me, just crumbly.  I love dark, dark chocolate but these needed a bit more sweet.

I'll crumble them into something - a chocolate truffle maybe and get some use out of them.

Want to try something really crazy but awesome? Omit the rum, raisins, and whipping cream and just replace all three with rum raisin ice cream instead. I used about 2/3 of a pint I had leftover in the freezer and heated that up enough to melt and mix the chocolate chips into. All other ingredients and steps remained the same, this substitution just reduced a bit of the prepwork to create a fantastic brownie with a subtle hint of rum raisin that my husband says "tastes a little bit like Christmas come early." Will definitely whip up again and probably experiment some more with other ice cream flavors in the future!
