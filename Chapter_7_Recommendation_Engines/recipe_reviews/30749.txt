This was great. I doubled the recipe. Instead of onions, I used the white part of the leek and didn't use any carrots. I also used a spicy salsa.

This was an ok recipe.  I'd make it again, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list of things to make.  The salsa added a good "kick" to the steak yet wasn't as spicy or as good as I thought it would be.  I was kind of disappointed!

Great recipe. I added red and green bell peppers to the recipe and omitted the carrots since I didn't have any.

I actually altered this recipe just a bit and I made it in my crock pot with a pork roast and it was excellent.  My husband raved about it.

I made this the other night with some left over fresh (spicy) salsa I got from the mexican market. Turned out great. Left out the onion cause I didn't have any. My husband can be pretty picky and he liked it. Super fast & easy!
