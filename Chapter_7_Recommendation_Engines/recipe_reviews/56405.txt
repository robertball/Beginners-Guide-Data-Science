Easy and taste like homemade - honest!
Key is to buy burgers the nite b4 and refridgerate.

This was the best stuffing I ever made, and I've been hosting Thanksgiving for my family for 22 years!  I didn't use sage (allergy) so I substituted some ground rosemary, and added some sauteed onion with the celery.  Phenomenal!

I did a test batch one month before T/G and WE found it to be a little bland and a bit dry however this stuffing ROCKED after I made a few minor changes .. In fact I asked to double the (new) batch next year :) 

The (new) recipe with changes is as follows:

10  White Castle Hamburgers with NO pickles and XTRA Onion

1 1/2 cups chopped celery
 
1 TABLESPOON Poultry Seasoning

1/2 teaspoon ground sage

black pepper to taste

1/2 cup chicken broth ..

Also please note that agree with a previous poster in that it is KEY to buy fresh burgers the day before a refridgerate them overnite.

This was a unique twist on stuffing. The reason I only gave it a four is because I have to buy frozen White Castle burgers where I am and it is like $5.00 for 6 of them which is too expensive for me. It was great to try though and I will keep it in mind when I want to give me guests something different.

This has been a part of our family Thanksgiving tradition for years and years.  It wouldn't be Thanksgiving in our house without it!

WOW! We made this in secret and didn't tell anyone what was in it. We had everyone taste this stuffing as well as our traditional stuffing. Almost everyone (especially the picky kids) liked this stuffing better. No one could guess what was in it and were shocked (and somewhat repulsed lol) by the fact that it was made with white castles. It has an almost spicy flavor to it. Absolutely delicious and will be a permanent fixture on our Thanksgiving table.

Good...but I think I'd increase the seasonings next time. Kind of "plain".

The first time I made this I didn't tell anyone what it was.  It was gone fast. Every one was so surprise when they knew it was White Castles. I order them with out pickles and extra onions. I also will add sauted onions, celery and carrots finely chopped. I get the biggest request for this every year.

We had this dressing for the first time last night on Thanksgiving and it was really good! There were two different dressings and the one made with the white castles was almost gone and the other one barely touched. The only difference was it was made with poultry seasoning. If you haven't tried it yet you don't know what your missing out on. Yummy.

Can't believe I forgot to review this after Thanksgiving.  Like other reviewers, I ordered mine with extra onion.  When I told the WC employees what I was doing, they were familier with it!  I LOVED it, but I love WC's.  Those who don't like WC's wouldn't even try it.  Definitely a novelty!  I will make this again, along with my regular stuffing because it is so fun.

This was better as left-overs.  Fresh from the oven, I could def. taste the White Castles.  Like another reviewer did, I ordered them without pickles and extra onions the night before and stuck them in the fridge.  I am not sure if I will make again, but my husband loved it.

A guest coming for Thanksgiving is a White Castle freak because he lives in L.A. and can't get them.  I made this dressing to surprise him, even though I was a little wary of the idea.  Turned out it was delicious and you couldn't even tell it was made from hamburgers.  So odd how it just ends up tasting like dressing in the end!  I would add more chicken broth next time, only because mine was a little dry.

This recipe was, indeed, simple...but absolutely nothing special.  I increased the broth (I used turkey broth instead of chicken) to 1 full cup, and it was still dry.  It had a pleasant flavor, but certainly not nearly as good as traditional turkey dressing.  The frozen White Castle burgers were not cheap, either.  In the future, I will go back to traditional, sausage-bread-celery-onion-walnut-cranberry stuffing, which, at least, is worth the effort.
