I made this and it turned out fantastic.  I used white wine with a little vegetable broth instead of all veg both.  Gave it a nice flavor.  Mu husband thought it looked gross, but in all honesty, this is one of the most delicious recipes I have tried.  More for me, I guess!

I really enjoyed this recipe and we've started making it regularly in our vegetarian household. A few changes: I used butter instead of oil -- butter is a must for bringing out the flavor of mushrooms. Also skipped the dijon since I didn't have any and the recipe seemed fine without it. I used sour cream in lieu of yogurt.  Yum!

Yum! This was fairly quick and easy to make, and turned out rich and tasty. I  added a little extra garlic, stock and cream than the recipe stated (to make it saucier), i'm sure i'll make this again!

I loved it! Will definitely make it again. 

I didn't have any not-meat meat on hand but I always have tofu. 

My go to now is to slice the tofu relatively finely, Chuck it in a bowl with some oil, pop my fave spices on, mix a bit of flour and baking powder in with it and whack it in the oven to dehydrate and get crispy. Soooo super tasty and can be made with any flavoring to suit any dish. 

What I didn't account for was that when I chucked it into the mix - I waited until I had thickened the broth - that it would get super extra thick from the little bits of crumb that came off of it. So I added extra water. Lovelovelove it and served it with some beautifully fluffy pilaf.

This was a huge family hit! Wife loved it, 15 year old boy loved it. Finally, an excellent stroganoff for a vegetarian family, an instant family staple. Only minor changes: I used olive oil instead of canola, my own broth, and a Balkan style yogurt, which was perfect.

Overall, a great way to use mushrooms and easy to veganize. I used vegan sour cream and Gardein beef tips. The only suggestion I have is to add pepper.
