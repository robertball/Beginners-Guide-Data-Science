The recipe should state to ues vanilla WAFFLE (with frosting between the layers)wafer cooies and not just vanilla wafer cookies. They really are quite good and something a little different.

OMG, I have been looking for this recipe for years, I just couldn't quite remember it. My Mum made it for us as kids and it is light, fluffy, very inexpensive and yummy. We would always just put it in a big bowl and serve it out like pudding.  Thanks so much taking me back in time.

Light and easy! My mother also made a dessert like this back in the 50s, but I never knew how she did it. Thanks for the recipe! Hers was lemon-flavored, a bit sweeter and she poured it over a wafer cookie crust. I made it with lime jello and added 2 T. Key Lime juice. Omitted the crumbs and served it as a chiffon. Wow, intense! Didn't take much to satisfy the taste buds.  Will be serving this in the summer!

I used sugar free Jello and fat free evaporated milk. I chose to skip the vanilla wafers and just serve this like a mousse. Though my husband did not care for it, the kids and I thought it was great! I will be making this again soon.

My Mother made this all the time, especially at Christmas with 1/2 of a cherry on each piece she cut.  And at Easter with a jelly bean on top.  I love this stuff.  Her recipe is a little different but basically the same.
