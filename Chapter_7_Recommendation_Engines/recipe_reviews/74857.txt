I used Kitchen Bouquet Browning and seasoning mix instead of the Maggi liquid seasoning since I didn't have it on hand. I think that does make a difference in flavor. I ate one straight out of the oven! Both of the seasonings should be in the spice isle of the store. Thank you for sharing!

I could not find the Maggi liquid seasoning so I left it out. The meat was really chalky and tasteless. I doubt I will try these again, even tho it was probably my own fault that they didn't turn out.

You need to season the meat with Jamaican jerk seasoning. Measure in teaspoons: 2thyme, 2 pepper, 5 garlic, 1 chili powder, 2-3 cayenne, 1 cinnamon, 1/2 ground cloves. I used refrigerated pie crust. Make a large calzone type patty. Turned out great.

I used the idea of this recipe. I recently went to the Caymans and fell in love with the Jamaican Patties. The bread crumbs are key to get the texture right. I used Jamaican jerk specialty seasoning. Handed them over to my papa who is born and raised there. And He said they taste like home...few tips. Sprinkle the pastry before cooking with curry. Add orange peppers or scotch bonnet...and onions. And the jamaican jerk sauce. Only a teaspoon. Its was spicy out the bottle...but perfect when added to meat...bought a rolling pin..just to make more:)

Tastes nothing like a Jamaican beef patty. What a disappointment. Islandflav has the real deal.

Too rich and pretty boring. Not worth the unhealthy recipe.

The Jamaican Beef Patties were okay. I felt spices over powered each other and was not satisfied with the way the dough turn-out. I tried beef patties in the past and did this not think this recipe came close in flavor to what I was expecting.
