I thought this recipe was excellent.  I wanted to leave out the hazelnuts since I was making a separate batch of hazelnut pizzelles.  I also like to make sure I have some that those with nut allergies can enjoy.  So I left out the hazelnuts but added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.

Good but much softer than normal pizzelles. Also beware of chunkier hazelnut morsels getting stuck on the pizzelle iron

I left out the hazelnuts and added a little extra cinnamon. The batter was very easy to work with and the recipe made about fifty 4" pizzelles in my Cuisinart Pizzelle Press. I cooked them on the highest setting (5) and they came out perfect. They come out a little soft and harden as they cool....One less egg makes them a less soft and they seem to taste better if you make them the night before. Try putting marshmallow fluff or peanut butter between two of them and make delicious sandwich cookies.

I noticed many people didn't like the flavor of these cookies.  I think they are sensational!  Although the recipe does not say to do so, please make sure you roast the hazelnuts in the oven, place them on a large, clean kitchen towel, and fold the towel over.  Let the heat "steam" them for a minute, then rub the hazelnuts through the towel vigorously to remove the skins.  Make sure you grind the hazelnuts very finely in a food processor before using them in the recipe.  For the reviewer whose pizzelles stuck to the iron, did you oil the top and bottoms of your iron?  If you do, they won't stick.  Be sure to throw out the first two cookies you make on the iron, though, or you'll have a very oily cookie.  It is also a good way to make sure the iron is "clean."  No one wants to eat microscopic remnants from last years' pizzelles. ;)

Just gone done with my first batch of this recipe and it's great!  No complaints whatsoever.  I have a Cucina Pro regular and mini pizzelle maker and I used the mini for this one.  It is a non-stick pizzelle maker, but you still must use non-stick spray (for those who had problems with it sticking).

I left out the hazelnuts and used only three eggs, as another reviewer suggested. Great call, because after these set up for a couple minutes they are delightfully crispy and wonderful!  I've been making pizzelles a LONG time and this recipe is by far the best one I've used.  Thank you so much for it.

These were yummy. They're a lot thicker than my usual recipe. I ground and toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts, worked well. I used 3 eggs and 3/4 cups melted butter. Added some almond extract too. 
Cooked up well on #4 on the pizzelle maker. These  are super to shape when warm, you can make cannoli, waffle cones, cookie 'taco' shells (fill with cool whip and berries!). If I make these again, I'll thin out the better to get more out of the batch.

Chocolate pizelles are our new favorite. We married this recipe with my mom/ grandma/ nonny's recipe... meaning we made a much larger batch with a dozen eggs and vanilla and almond flavoring, with some additional oil in the batter. From this recipe, specifically used the salt, more butter, cocoa, ground hazelnut and cinnamon. Slam dunk!!

Made a batch today and delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I used what I had on hand.. Special dark chocolate powder. Left out hazelnuts as my niece is allergic to nuts. Not too sweet, just perfect. Will bake again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I made these because my husband thinks all cookies should be should. they were ok but I wasn't that impressed. They were easy to make but I do prefer that old-fashioned anise flavored pitzelles I remember as a kid!!  I think if they were a little more chocolate-ly maybe I would like them. But husband really likes so they will be made again but I may add mini chocolate chips and see what happens.

Followed the recipe and they turned out ok-- wasn't a fan of the flavor.
