I make this ALL the time. Its the best slow cooker recipe ever! The only thing I change is I use chicken broth instead of white wine, and I use regular cream of mushroom soup- it has a better flavor than the golden mushroom soup. I always serve over angel hair pasta with a nice crusty bread to soak up the fabulous sauce. This is one of my all time favorite recipes!! I cook on high for 3-4 hours, OR on low for 6-8 hours.

great but easier version is: pan fry sliced onion & mushrooms in butter, then add chicken sprinkled with a lot of italian spices & fresh ground pepper, brown both sides.  Add 2 cans regular mushroom soup, the chive & onion cream cheese (if you have only regular cream cheese use that) a few TB sour cream, heat through, add wine but it's better with about 1/3 cup sherry. Serve with cut-up fresh chives& parsley. Great with mashed potatoes or served on heated pastry shells.We like a lot of sauce, so you can play around by adding or deleting.  Only takes about 20 min from start to finish and it's unbelievably great.

This recipe is wonderful.  We call it Angel Chicken and have been making it for a long time now.  You don't have to use the wine and there is still plenty of gravy to go over pasta or rice.  Enjoy.

I thought this was fantastic!! I threw all ingredients into the crock pot and let it cook all day. I did however make some minor changes. I could not find 'Golden' cream of mushroom, so I used regular cream of mushroom. As for the wine, I substituted chicken stock for it...wonderful! As a left over, it was even better. I made some orzo past and  server the chicken over it.....my friends all wanted the recipe. Thanks so much!!

This recipe is fantastic!  The sauce is very similar to an alfredo sauce so I served it over fettucini noodles.  I used plain cream cheese instead of the chive and onion cream cheese and it was still well seasoned.  It actually ended up quite salty for my taste so maybe next time I would use half the Italian seasoning and add some other spices without extra salt.  All in all it was a big hit!

Great taste, but way too salty. I like salt, but this dish is for salt addicts. I would definitely make again but cut the amount of Italian dressing pack to half or a quarter of packet. 

Update: 12/4
I made this recipe again today, the meal came out perfect. Here is what I changed to cut down high salt taste.

2 tbsp butter
1/2 of single packet (.7 oz) dry Italian dressing 
1 8oz  brick of cream cheese (chive cream cheese is too salty when mixed with other ingredients)
1 tbsp of chive seasoning
1 can of condensed golden mushroom soup
1/2 cup dry white wine
8 skinless boneless chicken tenderloins

-follow same basic cooking directions in recipe

I served this with a half of a box of mini penne noodles. I put 2 tabs of butter on noodles and pinch of salt & teaspoon of oregano on noodles. When you are ready to eat, just top noodles with delicious chicken & sauce.

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe.  I made it with 98% fat free condensed mushroom soup and 1/3 less fat chive and onion cream cheese, plus changed the butter to use a lower fat spreadable butter made with olive oil.  The only cooking wine I had was a dry white with lemon, so I used that.  I don't like reviews that say they changed every ingredient in the recipe and that made it 5 stars, so while I did make some changes, I tried to stick to as true to the recipe as possible, just using lower fat ingredients.  I will definitely make this again.  To add a vegetable to the dish, I added a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli after the dish had cooked for 3 hours.  We served it over pasta, and my boyfriend went back for seconds (he doesn't usually eat much!).

I agree with the one review saying the white wine was optional. This was a great recipe. It made a normal piece of white meat moist and savory. This is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious! My family loved it.  It's very rich and tastes like something you would order at a restaurant. I served it over rice and my wife and kids all asked for seconds! I have six people in my family so I added a couple more chicken breasts. It turned out great. but I was a bit low on sauce. I was thinking of adding another can of condensed soup...

This is almost identical to the popular "Angel Chicken Pasta" on this site.  The only difference is that this one has more cream cheese and less butter.  I prefer the other recipe to this one.

SO I JUST MADE THIS RECIPE TONIGHT, GOT BIG THUMBS UP FROM THE KIDS TOO!! it was really easy and sooo good too. I did mix butter,soup,dash of white wine,put my own blend of italian seasons(basil,parm,garlic salt blend)sprinkled with that,block of regular cream cheese. in a saucepan. I also sliced an onion of your preference and layed that in the crockpot bottom, then 3 boneless chicken breast(Costco):). Then poured mix on chix added another dash of wine,cooking with wine is not like drinking it!! The heat kills the alcohol.I think, Lol!!!  I also added a about 4 dashes of wishenshire sauce.(However you spell it).  I love using it on chicken, gives it great flavor!! Put on High for 4hrs. then reduced to low for 1hr. or so!! Served with broccoli,warm wheat french bread and shell pasta noodles(my kids love the shells). I'm still waiting for hubby to get home so I can enjoy it with him

This was a last minute dinner choice as our dinner guests cancelled, noone wanted lasagna and I'm sick as a dog. I changed the recipe just a bit, to add more flavor. I sauteed some sliced onion, minced garlic and 4 ounces sliced baby bella mushrooms in the butter (I needed to add a little more butter) before adding in the other ingredients. Because I didn't have chive and onion cream cheese, I used the reduced fat cream cheese I had on hand and added in a teaspoon of onion powder and a couple tablespoons of fresh chopped chives. We thought this was very good, even my husband who can be kind of iffy with cream "gravy" type dinners. No leftovers. I served this with fluffy brown rice and roasted broccoli and cauliflower. Very budget friendly and quite bendable to make it more personal.

Wonderful flavor. I didn't have dry Italian-style salad dressing, so I used 1/3 cup of regular Italian salad dressing. The sauce alone could be used with many different things. I made this with 4 boneless thick-cut pork chops and it came out just as good as the chicken.

This is like a fancier version of Slow Cooker Chicken Tetrazzini on here which I've made many times. I loved the chive & onion cream cheese more than the plain. But I couldn't taste the wine so I will go back to using chicken broth. Delicious over fluffy white rice!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I used a whole bag of boneless, skinless chicken strips. I also doubled the Italian dressing mix, 2 cans of golden mushroom soup,  only 8 ounces of chive and onion cream cheese and 1 cup of chicken broth (instead of white wine). I also added chopped green onions. The sauce was a little thin so I thickened it with a water and flour mixture. I served it over fettucini and served it with garlic bread. Next time I think I will add sliced baby portabella mushrooms. As a beginning chef I know a recipe is good when my husbands tells me to add it to the rotation:) Thanks Jennie!

This is a favorite of mine for the slower cooker.  However, I've added a few things to it.  Once you have the mixture cooked in the saucepan and ready to add to the slow cooker, try adding in quartered artichoke hearts (I use one can), drained diced tomatoes (1 can) and 1/2 to 1 onion (how much do you like onions?).  Then at the end of cooking I shred/slice the chicken and mix throughout the sauce.  Serve over bow-tie pasta with fresh parmesan on top.  So good!  If it is too thick I toss in a bit of vegetable or chicken broth as well.

This truly is heavenly.  I didn't quite have enough time to make this as written as I promised my daughter I would make this, but got home late.  The only change I made was to cut the chicken up in bite sized pieces so it would cook faster.  It worked.  It was ready in 2 hours 15 mins on high and the chicken pieces were unbeliavably (sp?) tender.  I'll make this again and again and will cut the pieces up just because it makes it easier to eat and serve.  The only down size to this recipe is that one serving won't do it because it's so good you'll go back for more.  Guilty of two servings myself.  Thanks for the recipe Jeannie.  Amazing.

I made this tonight with a few changes. One of them accidental, one out of laziness, and one to kick it up a notch. The accidental one, I wrote down sour cream and chives instead of cream cheese. Then I grabbed french onion dip. It went in. Cut the chicken in half. Added lots of pepper and italian seasoning. Also used the large can of regular cream of mushroom because I knew I was going to the laziness step! The laziness one was I tossed in almost a pound of broken up angel hair pasta about 45 minutes before it was done and broke up the chicken. This is a GREAT recipe!

Wow...this was fantastic and made enough for delicious left-overs the next day.  I didn't bother with heating everything in a saucepan...I just mixed it all together and poured it over the chicken.  It was perfect!  Served with pasta and a salad, this was a meal that will be used a LOT in our home!

I made exactly per recipe, and while the chicken was nice and moist, this was salty and bland at the same time.  It was good enough to eat, but not to make again.

How nice to be surprised. I haven't always been happy with crock pot meals but this is a recipe that I will keep and make again for sure. Rather than cut back on salt (a few reviewers said "too salty") I used unsalted butter and paid attention to how much salt there was already built in the called for ingredients that I cannot control - the soup for example. I'm a Kosher salt fan as I find the flavour is less harsh and more pleasing even when using less. As a personal preference I used half white wine and half chicken broth. I was unsure if 4 hours on low would be long enough so I began at high for about an hour then turned to low for the remaining time. The chicken was very tender and the sauce smooth. I served it over basmati rice with a broccoli side. Delicious! 
The following night I made egg noodles serving  them with the remaining sauce. 
Add economical as another bonus. Thanks so much for posting.

I made this yesterday and I really liked it.  My husband didn't care for it, but he doesn't like mushrooms.  I thought I could be sneaky about it--didn't work. haha  Like another reviewer said, it did taste just a tad salty for my taste but it was still very good.  I'll see what I can do to cut back on the sodium next time.

My grocery store didn't have the chive cream cheese, so I just used regular. Also I used cream of mushroom instead of golden mushroom. But still...AMAZING!! It smelled soooo good when I came home from work! Served it over rice because that's what I was hungry for. Boyfriend loved it and he's not a huge chicken fan! Don't over cook the chicken, because it is perfect after 4 - 4.5 hours! Will definitely be making this again!

This came out good. I followed the directions exactly, with one substitution of chicken broth instead of white wine. My crock pot tends to cook kinda hot (the big 7 qt cooker) and chicken dishes tend to get overcooked and fall apart. The chicken was a little overcooked, I served it over brown rice and it was kinda blah. The next day, I reheated it and served it over some corkscrew pasta- awesome! I definitely loved the leftovers.

With my changes I'd give this a 5 star.  As is it's a little bland for my taste and not worth the fat and calories.  I added 3 peppers (red, orange, and yellow) and an onion - all sliced fajita style, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tsp Itl. seasoning, chicken broth instead of wine, and topped it off with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.  Now that's worth it!

Loved this!  We're adding it to our menu ideas. I didn't have chive & onion cream cheese, so I used regular. I threw it all in the crock (seperately) with 6 frozen chicken breasts. Added 1/4 cup milk too. Slow cooked for 5 hours, and the last hour, I added only 4 oz. cream cheese and a 1/2 cup sour cream. Was so tender, it just fell apart. Served over wheat egg noodles - yummy!!!

GREAT recipe! I didnt have dry italian so I just did a mix of dry italian herbs with 1/4 cup chicken broth and since I have very picky eaters, I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom. Definitely used the wine(pinot grigio)which gives it such a nice flavor. Let it cook all day on low then served it over angel hair pasta. Everyone loved it and we have leftovers with plenty of sauce in the fridge. Thanks for posting such a great idea:).

This was so full of flavor.  I served it over buttered noodles.  Next time I'll add some broccoli and mushrooms.  There was a lot of delicious broth left over so adding more veggies would stretch the meal.  I was curious how the Italian dressing mix would taste, it was delicious.  Thanks Jennie.

I added carrots, broccoli and cauliflower - used chicken stock instead of wine and sauteed onion and garlic.
GREAT recipe!  Excellent comfort food!  Will make this again for camping.

Loved this!  I started by melting the butter in the slow cooker on high and then added the cream cheese, soup, seasoning and Barefoot Riesling for the wine.  I turned the cooker down to low and added the chicken. I cooked the chicken until it was falling apart (about 7 hours with frozen chicken), shredded it and then added back to the sauce.  Served over egg noodles.  Delicious!

So delicious! I read a lot of reviews that said it was even better the second day, so I combined everything in the slow cooker after work (I have one where the whole ceramic part is removable) and stuck it in the fridge overnight. I started it the next day when I got home from school. The flavors are PERFECT. I can't imagine how anyone gave it less than 5 stars!

Great, easy recipe.  I just threw everything into the crockpot and I used cream of mushroom soup like most of the reviewers.  Served over rice.  Next time I will add mushrooms.  Was a big hit at my dinner party.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I don't have wine or the golden mushroom soup in the house, so I substitute regular mushroom soup and chicken broth. Everyone loves this chicken, and I make it all the time! I find if I'm gone a little longer and the delicious gravy gets a little thicker, I'll add about 3/4 can chicken broth instead of the recommended 1/2 cup and that does the trick.

Had high hopes for this dish. It smelled wonderful while cooking, but eating it the flavors just did not work at all. Even my husband, who is far from picky didn't like it. Ended up going in the trash.

Yummy! This was excellent. Couldn't find chive cream cheese, so I cooked onions and garlic in the butter before adding the salad dressing mix. Didn't have any wine, so I used a whole can of chicken broth. I poured the sauce over six chicken breast halves and still ended up with plenty of sauce to be had. I let it cook for about 8 hours on low. It was delicious and the chicken fell apart in your mouth. I served over rice and the sauce with it was fantastic! I'll try pasta next time. My husband cleaned his plate twice. You HAVE to try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!

Yummy! The creamy sauce is so good and the chicken is very tender it melts in your mouth. I served this with rice and biscuts. Not the healthiest meal but it sure is good.

This was good but the same flavor could be made from healthier ingredients. We ended up shredding the chicken, adding steamed fresh broccoli and serving it as a alfredo sauce over penne.

Has been a favorite of mine for years.  Double the recipe and cut boneless breasts into large bite size pieces and it's great for 8-10.  Serve over pasta or rice.  The wine offers a gourmet touch.

Maybe left it in the slow cooker too long? Not sure, but I wasn't crazy about this one... The kids enjoyed it, I just wasn't crazy about the taste. Rating as 4 anyway, though, because the picky munchkin did like it.

This recipe is really good, but the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was REALLY salty! I will definitely be using this recipe on a regular basis though... maybe finding a low sodium dressing mix? Thank you!

This is great! The only thing I did different was that I used 1/2 a carton of chive cream cheese and 1/2 a carton of red. fat cream cheese to try to cut down some of the fat. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it turned out great, and we had plenty of sauce for egg noodles. We didn't think this dish was too rich like other reviewers.

This was so delicious and perfect for a cold winter night! I substituted half a can (about 1 cup) of chicken broth for the wine, just because I didn't have any on hand, and used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom. We left it on low all day, and the chicken came out tender and wonderful. I'll definitely make this again!

Loved this. Super easy. I love mushrooms so I added 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic soup. Added a delicious touch. I also added and extra can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup of water. I used low fat cream cheese. I served this over pasta, thus the extra soup. I like extra sauce. This is delicious, and suuuper easy. Even for a terribble cook like myself. Impossible to mess up!

AMAZING! I used fat free cream cheese. Heart healthy cream of chicken(2 cans). One cup chicken broth. Served with angel hair pasta. Less than 500 calories for a serving! And it was FILLING.

I used ranch dressing mix rather than Italian and cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and it was really good!  The chicken was tender, and the sauce was very tasty - did not seem salty and/or bland as other reviewers mentioned with the Italian dressing.  Mashed potatoes would probably be a good side next time for all of the extra "gravy."

This is amazing!  I substituted plain reduced fat cream cheese for the chive and onion cream cheese and added some onion powder and dried chives because I didn't have the other on hand.  My family loves this!

I would give this dish 10 stars if I could.  It is DELICIOUS!  The only things I changed in the recipe was that I used regular cream of mushroom soup.  I also added a can of mushrooms to the pot about 20 minutes before we ate it to add a vegetable.  SO delicious!

I give it a 3. Hubby gave it a 4. I didn't love it but didn't hate it. I would make it again with some changes. As recommended by other reviewers, I used cream of mushroom and not the golden. The dish was very salty. I guess it depends on the brand of dry italian that gets used. Or perhaps it doesn't need butter since I used cream of mushroom instead. Maybe both of those things. Also, I turned the slowcooker on high for a bit and warmed the contents in it (minus the chicken) until they were smooth. I then added the chicken and turned it to the low setting. If I have to use the stove to handle warming 90% of the ingredients, I wouldn't be slow cooking.

This was pretty good I will probably make again. I like to add shredded carrots to things for color so that was the only change I made.

This was really easy to make.  I did it on my lunch break.  I added peas to the last few minutes of cooking.  It def needs seasoning.  I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and red pepper for a little spice.

We liked this recipe, but it is a lot like the Slow Cooker Chicken Stroganoff recipe on this site that we use very often.  I think next time I will try the Angel Chicken Pasta from this site, which uses the same ingredients as this, but it is baked...I just think I might like it a bit better.  The sauce was so good though, and I will make again!

I absolutely loved the depth of flavor in this super simple dish. I served over gluten-free (brown rice) spaghetti. This recipe is BEGGING for sauteed mushrooms but alas my husband "hates fungus" - next time I'll make them on the side for me. The only thing...the sauce is very rich and thick, which normally I like, but this was like gravy. Maybe next time I'll try less cream cheese and add milk. Thank you for sharing Jennie.

Made 2 changes from necessity:  used plain cream cheese and substituted chicken broth for the wine.  Dinner was awesome!  My two sons loved it and my husband said it's a "do again"!  We eat a lot of chicken recipes - this was easy.  I threw the chicken in the crock pot 1/2 frozen, too!  Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe, especially when you don't have the time (or energy) to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I followed the recipe exactly, and the chicken and sauce were delicious over jasmine rice. The only change I will try to make next time will be to seek out products with less sodium.

This was pretty good, but the one thing I thought was strange was adding the golden mushroom soup, which has beef stock.  I think a better alternative would be regular cream of mushroom soup.  I think the mix of flavors for me, just wasn't great.  I have made a similar recipe using regular mushroom soup, cream of celery soup, wine, dried onions and cheddar cheese, which has a much better flavor (to me).  Anyway, its always good to try something new.  Thanks for the recipe.

I melted the butter and then just threw everything else into the slow cooker including frozen chicken breasts, and just gave it a quick stir.  5 hours later we had a good meal to serve over rice.

This is delicious and company worthy.  Although it is not high calorie, I use low fat cream of mushroom soup and low fat cream cheese with diced green onion tops instead of the chive cream cheese.  I have cooked it with carrots and yukon gold potatoes under the chicken, and have added a can of drained green beans at the end of cooking for a one pot meal when camping.  Served it last night and one of my guests said she would choose this meal over lobster!

I made this for 8 people last night, my first attempt and thus doubled the recipe- turned out to be fantastic!! Everyone cleared their plates including 4 seven / eight year olds. The chicken was divine, so succulent and tender, the sauce was so delicious and plentiful. Halfway through the cooking process I was doubtful about the herb quantities, they were so overpowering at that point ( I used the copycat recipe for the Italian dressing mix as couldn't find it), I also like many others used cream of mushroom soup as also could not source the golden mushroom soup, but by the end of the four hours the flavour was sensational.  I added small fresh broccoli florets to the slow cooker an hour before the end and they were a great addition for colour and nutritional value, thankyou so much for this simple but heavenly recipe! This is a true keeper :)

Super easy and quite tasty!  Perfect for a lazy Sunday.  We served over egg noodles with a salad.  Next time I'd like to try it over angel hair pasta.  I'll have to add this to my menu rotation.  Thanks Jennie!

Used a papaya seed dressing to give it some zing and chicken stock instead of white cooking wine.  Cut the chicken breast halves in half and they came out very tender. Great recipe

This was delicious! I used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom. I used wine and thought it worked perfectly.  I also added some parmesean/romano to the crockpot at the end.  Changes for next time will be to add some sauteed mushrooms and to season the chicken before putting it in the crockpot.

This was a great recipe served over pasta. Adding a good amount of sliced, fresh mushrooms really added to it. In addition to the wine I did add some chicken broth. I found that the first time I made this, the flavor of the Italian seasoning lessened the longer it cooked. So, I decided to stir the seasoning in the crockpot midway through the cooking time, that way it retained the italian seasoning flavor. I also sauteed some garlic and shallots and added that midway through the cooking as well and that really made the flavor pop. Delicious!

I made this for dinner last night.  It was a little like the crockpot Italian chicken recipe that has been going around (cream cheese and Italian dressing) which I have made before and my family loved so I knew that this one would be a hit, as well.  And it was.  My husband and daughter scarfed it down.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used 2/3 of a cup of regular Italian dressing instead of the dry stuff because that's what I had.  I also added a whole onion and some mushrooms.  It smelled fabulous while cooking and tasted declicious.  I put it over rice.  Will make again.

Fantastic meal!  So VERY easy and tasty.  I was really skeptical about this recipe, until I tasted the sauce.  I made per recipe, over spaghetti, except I sauteed Bella mushrooms a bit before the chicken was ready and added that to the sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce, as there was still a chicken breast left, but the sauce disappeared.  I did make more sauce the next day for leftovers.  Just as yummy leftover!

Yummy! I made a few minor changes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and lots of garlic in the butter before adding the other ingredients. I also used neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese (1/3 less fat) and 98% fat free cream of mushrooms soup to make this recipe a little less fattening. I also added fresh Oregano and a 1/3 of a packet of french onion soup mix instead of the italian dressing (it was all I had in the pantry). Had to add quite a bit more liquid (I used chicken stock) to make it saucey enough to pour over pasta. I served it over egg noodles and sprinkled fresh parsley on top. Turned out very good.

I used cream of mushroom soup and added fresh mushrooms to it because my family really likes them.  Towards the end of cooking I added some flour to the gravy to thicken it up and I served over noodles.  This was very good - it has a definite fettucine flavor to it!

I modified the recipe slightly.  I used regular cream of mushroom soup because the store I purchased my ingredients in did not have golden.  Also, I used chicked broth instead of white wine.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was AMAZING!  My daughter is notoriously picky and we have problems with her finishing her dinner nearly every night.  She has SECONDS!  She said that she wished we could have this every night for dinner!  Nothing but compliments!  Awesome recipe!

I took a chance making this since hubby hates mushrooms, but he loved it...we all did!  The cream of mushroom soup added a delicious savoriness. I made exactly as written but added a can of corn (would have liked to add peas instead, but I was out).  Served with rice & veggies and then a few days later, had the leftovers served over biscuits...yum!

Great! The only changes I made was to use chicken broth instead of wine, but I bet it would be fantastic with the wine! I'll try it like that next time. I also, used chicken thighs instead of breasts!

I would give this 5 stars except my husband thought it was a little too salty.  I followed the directions exactly, except I added some minced garlic - so easy and very tasty.  I only had to cook it for three hours on low in my crockpot though.

I was really torn between three and four stars, but this was so easy that I opted for four. The chickent was moist and tender, but it just didn't have that wow factor. With all the wonderful chicken recipes on this site, I won't be making this again, but thank you very much for sharing it.

Delicious.  I made it with cream of mushroom soup instead of golden like some of the reviews suggested,  cooked on high for four hours, and served over egg noodles.  So good and easy!

Very good flavor- I didn't use the whole Italian dressing packet though because of the high salt taste warnings from others.  I used about half and it was very flavorful!

This was decent but pretty salty.  I liked the consistency of the sauce, but it was sodium-packed even when served over plain white rice.

I liked this but my husband did not, so I have to give it 3 stars because of that.  He said he was just not impressed by it, even though I felt it had good flavor and was very easy to make.  I think he may prefer this with regular cream of mushroom soup instead of golden.  The soup was the only ingredient in the recipe that was out of the ordinary for us that and I think it may have contributed to his not liking it.

This was good and the family ate it up.  Followed the recipe as is, no changes necessary.  I did however cook this 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low setting.  Chicken came put perfect.  Love the slow cooker recipes especially in the colder weather.

Loved this recipe and we didn't find it overly saucy at all. It made a lot for the 2 of us so the first night was served with rice and second with egg noodles. The sauce was excellent with both.

Made this last night...my cooker over cooked the chicken on me and it fell apart but, the flavor of the sauce was great.  My toddlers loved the sauce with egg noodles.  My husband didn't like this dish, he thought the sauce was a bit rich.  I will make this again but go lighter on the cream cheese.

Excellent, I used Goliath Chardonnay, instead of the Riesling. I thought it was delicious! Definitely will make it again, used my instapot to sauté the ingredients, then just added chicken and used the slow cook setting. Perfect! I forgot to take a photo, but it looked identical to the one showed.

My husband loved it!! I ended up frying onions, garlic and mushrooms together in butter and then added it to about 15 oz. of water with a chicken bouillon cube instead of mushroom soup and added my own recipe of dry Italian style seasoning but otherwise, it was great!! Thanks!

HEAVENLY indeed! After testing with just a "taste", I had to have more!  Before I knew it, I had eaten 1 whole breast! 

Unlike you, Jennie, we love mushrooms so I added fresh mushrooms to the cream sauce before cooking. It was great addition!  
Thank you for sharing this Awesome Dish!

This is a lovely recipe which I made following several reviewers' suggestions and a few of my own alterations according to my available ingredients and preferences. The family really enjoyed it! I used 4 large chicken breasts (each cut in 3) and placed on bottom of slow cooker with 1/4 c of broth. I sautéed a large onion before adding cream of broccoli soup (it's what I had!) and plain light cream cheese. I omitted the Italian powder in favour of 1T each of dried parsley, oregano and chives, and 1/2 T basil. I added 1/2 c chicken broth instead of wine  and mixed thouroughly before pouring over the chicken. 
It was perfect after cooking it on high for 3 hours. A few minutes before serving, I added 2 chopped green onions. We had it over spaghetti noodles with peas. Next time I may try it with angel hair pasta or spaghetti squash. Yum!

This recipe is divine! I always double the recipe. I dice the chicken breasts and then I add the sauce… I put the slow cooker on for four hours but with 30 minutes to go, I add cheese filled tortellini and one cup of chicken broth. It makes the best tortellini & chicken pasta and is absolutely delicious! A family & guest favorite for sure!

For cooks and reviewers who say it is bland .  The recipe doesn't have  any flavours or aromatics to give it a wow. One has to do that themselves. I most  always  add ,onion,garlic and herbs to flavour my food dishes.
I made this and it was great. I had mushrooms i needed to use up and 8 chicken thighs. I use what i have on hand . I very seldom run out and buy specifically   for a recipe. You can always adapt and use what you have on hand. 
I sauted the mushrooms in butter,garlic,onion , and  a pinch of red chili peppers.
 I added  plain cream cheese  because that is what i had, cream of chicken soup, a  tbsp of chicken bouillon, 1/2 cup of wine,some herbs, sage leaves and thyme leaves, parsley , because i have in my garden,which go nice with both mushrooms and chicken. 
I  put a sprinkle of salt and pepper on the chicken  thighs and topped with the creamy soupy mushroom mixture.
I cooked on high 3 hrs then the last hr or so  on low.
It was delicious served over  buttered,parsley eggs noodles  with a side of garlic sauteed broccoli.
.If you want flavour cooks you have to add it and yes you will have tweaked the recipe,but all recipes are open to  tweaking, if you are an adventurous  cook.
 Don't be afraid to add aromatics to bring out flavour..This is a  good base recipe for just that or enjoy as is.

Made it exactly as written except I used regular cream of mushroom soup. The kids loved it as did my husband! I served it with peas and some Sister Shubert’s Rolls.  I will definitely make it again.

Used regular cream cheese and less of the seasoning to reduce salt. Unfortunately wasn't tasty or juicy enough. Will be making again with more chicken stock and a little more seasoning and hopefully will be better!

This chicken dish is so good.  Turned out moist and delicious with lots of great tasting sauce.  Do not know how anyone could say it was bland!  I used chicken broth in place of white wine but otherwise, per the recipe.  Will certainly make again.  It was very much enjoyed.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Made this last night using the exact ingredients.  Why do people need to make alterations to any recipe and then comment on THEIR new version?  Anyway, my family loved it and gave it a 4.  It was very tender and tasty.  It's not the healthiest but sometimes you have to splurge and change things out a bit.  Don't change this.  It's perfect the way it is.  If you are going to alter it then just add a different recipe to the website.  This one's a keeper!

I read most of the reviews, and I thought I'd play with this recipe.  So, here's what I did...
First of all, I wasn't in a time crunch this time so I didn't dump and run (haha).
I turned my slow cooker on HI added the butter and let it melt. Then, I added the chicken breasts with rib meat.  I think a dark piece or two would be a good addition, and will do it next time. I sprinkled each side with Chicken Tickler, you can find it online, and/or lemon pepper, and 1/2 packet of Italian seasoning.  I would suggest some kind of all purpose seasoning with minimal to no salt added. while I let one side with seasoning get some heat, 20 min. I made the sauce. I used LOW SODIUM cream of chicken AND regular Golden mushroom, and LOW SODIUM chicken broth.  I believe regular cream of mushroom makes it bland. In a saucepan, I whisked the golden mushroom, Low sodium cream of chicken, 4-6 oz of the cream cheese and NOT the whole 8 oz, MUST use the 1/2 cup of wine, and 1/2 cup LOW SODIUM Chicken broth. Whisk gently, let get hot.
Flip your chkn in crockpot, add another splash of wine, a tablespoon of SUGAR and then add the sauce.  I used HI for 41/2 hours and LOW for an hour or two.  It was absolute perfection!  House smelled divine. Use rice.
If you think it's too salty, you can add more sugar.
Bon appetite!

This was good, and my son enjoyed this even though he is a picky eater, but I didn't enjoy the texture of the chicken breast.  This is because of the crock pot, not the recipe.  I will make this next time in the oven - not in the crock pot.  Also, if using the homemade version of Italian Dressing (dry mix) from this website...do NOT add 2 T salt.  It almost ruined the dish and I ended up having to dilute the sauce so it was edible.

Thought about making this too late in the day and only had 3 hours to cook, but worked out perfectly. I had three large chicken breasts. Cooked on high for the first 30 minutes, then low for the remaining 2.5 hours.  Came out perfect, if not just a touch on the dry side, but the sauce makes up for it. Thanks!

This recipe smelled wonderful, but something was just a little off about it. Maybe it was the wine that I used? I'm not sure. Anyway, I'll probably try making it again with a different wine. Also, it was much better fresh out of the crock-pot....it didn't reheat very well. I find that to be the case with the vast majority of slow cooker meals, but it's just something to keep in mind.

I've always been very picky about slow cooker meals. I find that some meals can easily be thrown in and come out very good while other meals should remain cooked on the stove top. I substituted the wine for chicken broth, used cream of mushroom instead of golden and only used half of the salad dressing packet. I seasoned the chicken breast with herbs and red pepper only since the dressing, cream of mushroom and cream cheese have enough salt in them in my opinion. The smell was heavenly while it cooked and I put it over angel hair pasta once is was done. I can easily say that it was the best meal that ever came out of the slow cooker. Very easy and something that I never would have thought would be so delicious thrown all together. Thank you for sharing!

I made this one day when I was in a crunch for time later in the day and needed dinner alredy taken care of. I made it for my family of six: a very picky husband, and four picky children ages 10-13. I didn't have any wine in the fridge, but I DID have a 12 oz. can of beer, so I used that instead. IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!! I will always make this with beer from now on. I WOULD suggest spending the time to really melt the cream cheese and make sure it's blended in well before adding everything to the crock pot. I didn't, and there were random chuncks of cream cheese still floating in the mix at the end. I served this over plain rice and doubled up on the liquid so I could pour it over the chicken on the bed of rice. All of my picky eaters cleaned their plates and went back for seconds. There were no leftovers this night. My husband is begging me to make it again.

Sure it was easy, but taste? Not a hit. My hubby and children ages 11/12 said it tasted weird, not appetizing. I did follow the recipe to perfection~ They are not picky eaters so I guess it's just a matter of taste. Sorry but thumbs down on this one.

Loved this recipe.  I modified mine a little bit and kind of made it into more of a stew by putting in 2 packages of Trader Joe's foursome veggies (peas, carrots, corn, and green beans) and doubled the sauce ingredients on this.  Definitely will make again!

I made this recipe yesterday and after reading reviews and looking in the pantry, I decided to sub chicken broth for the wine and regular mushroom soup. I melted everything in the crock pot on low and then added the chicken breasts - frozen. I thought it would take extra time, but at 4 hours I checked and the chicken was done and pulled apart easily.

This was very rich, and good over rice. My only complaint was a slightly sweet taste that wasn't bad but distracting. I used Zesty Italian dressing so it's possible it had extra sugar. If I make it again, I'll go with the regular Italian.

I don't like chicken anything unless they're little wings smothered in buffalo sauce, extra crispy! So I wouldn't be the one to ask, however I made this for my hubby and son and they seemed to like it!! I didn't have wine so I used chicken broth. It was super easy and turned out well! I even thought it was pretty decent. My hubby had his with rice and me and my son had it with mashed taters!!! Not bad for chicken :)

Loved it. Just be sure not to add more wine than what's noted in the recipe. I did the second time I made this, on accident mind you, and the wine was over-powering.

So good, but... it was salty.  I think with the cream cheese, canned mushroom soup, and Italian salad dressing mix it just sent the sodium through the roof.  Since they don't have the golden mushroom soup in low sodium I am going to try it with regular cream of mushroom soup but use the low sodium kind.  But the flavors are wonderful.  I served it over linguini with steamed green beans from the garden.

This chicken really is heavenly! The sauce itself is just delicious, and would be good over noodles or rice. 2 10 year old boys and 2 adults all gave this 5 stars.

this is a great croc pot recipe.  I did make some changes, because of what I had on hand.  1. I used turkey breast because that's what I had defrosted, doubled sauce because of larger size, 2. added 8oz sliced baby portobellos cuz we love shrooms, 3. added a few tablespoons of lf sour cream because it needed to be used up, and finally, 4. added about 1 tablespoon of herbs du provence because I wanted to add a dash of tarragon from another reviewers suggestion but used this instead cuz it contains tarragon and I didn't have any plain tarragon.  came out tasting wonderful, served with hot buttered basmati rice and steamed peas for color.  yummmmmmy.

I made this recipe for a large group so I doubled it.  I made some angel hair pasta and broccoli to serve with it.  Everyone raved about it.  Thank you for such a simple and wonderful recipe.

This was excellent served with rice...after reading some reviews I decided to cook on high for 4 hours instead of on low...this was a mistake, the chicken came out a little dry (I will make this again but stick to the cooking directions). Other than this the dish was excellent, great flavor, husband/boyfriend approved.

This is an easy chicken dish that tastes like it is a lot more labor-intensive than it is! Rather than using a crockpot,I browned the chicken on the stove, then made the sauce and simmered it on low for about 25 minutes. While it simmered, I made my rice (and salad), and served the chicken over the rice--with the great sauce! I used regular mushroom soup, and threw in some fresh mushrooms.
  I also made it for a friend who just had a baby, and she & her hubby loved it. When she asked for the recipe, I was (almost!) embarrassed to tell her how easy it was.

This is excellent. It is very much like the "Angel Chicken Pasta" recipe, which we love! I do like that this is a slow-cooker version. It is easier this way. The Angel Chicken recipe uses half of the cream cheese listed for this version. I prefer less cream cheese, and I used only half of the tub. In my opinion, the wine and use of Golden Mushroom soup, really make the sauce. Using Cream of Mushroom completely changes the recipe. I also use 3 tbsp of butter, a small can of mushrooms (we love mushrooms), and a quarter cup of chicken broth. Although, this recipe is very good just as written. These are just my personal taste preferences, after making this recipe MANY times. DELICIOUS!

Made this exactly as written.  Cooked for 6 hours on low.  It was FANTASTIC!  The kids gobbled it down and my eldest asked to have some for his school lunch the next day (to my hubby's disappointment...he was looking forward to bringing it for his work lunch).  This one will be put in our permanent recipe book!

I'm giving this a three not because it didn't taste good, but because a recipe that has this many calories should be one of the best things you've ever put in your mouth!  I knew when making it that this was not a low calorie dinner by any means.  But, as I was making it I realized that just an 8 oz container of chive/onion cream cheese is 720 calories!  Not to mention the butter and mushroom soup.  It is not a bad recipe though.  Definitely not worthy of 5 stars, but worthy of 4 if you cut down the calories by using other ingredients (if that's even possible).  I added fresh mushrooms to this, and served it over asparagus.  Rice was my first choice, but wasn't eating any more calories!  I think it needed something else, as it provided a one-note soupy flavor.  Maybe putting chives on top would have balanced out the taste a bit, and added a little crunch.

I volunteered to bring this dish to a pre-Thanksgiving lunch and found I lost the recipe.  Total panic.  Finally found it.  I tweak it a bit.  Use low fat cream cheese, lose the butter and use mushroom soup.  100 years ago when I had my first crockpot, I had a recipe for chicken with sour cream and tarragon so I add a dollop of sour cream and tarragon to taste.  Somewhere along the line, I add a good splash of white wine.  This time, no one will want a whole chicken breast so I intend to cut the chicken into bite size pieces and brown them lightly with a sprinkling of garlic salt.  I love this recipe and have been known to stand over the crock pot slurping up the sauce.  I personally think it's best over fresh linguine topped with fresh chives.

This was AMAZING! I threw this into the crock pot around 1pm and had dinner ready at 5:30. I didn't have any Italian Dressing Mix, so I searched and found a recipe for one on this site and scaled it down to what I need to the recipe. It was very easy! Oh, I think the only thing I did differently, only by accident, was to use 1 cup, instead of 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of wine. I didn't have any white wine on hand, but the broth worked beautifully.
I shredded the chicken into the sauce and served it over 7 cheese tortellini from Costco. My husband and both my kids(2 and 5) enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this one again!

Husband was totally impressed! This had to be one of the easiest and the most flavorful chicken dishes I've ever made! It also kept the chicken moist and the mixture doesn't burn. Same as Angel Chicken but either way, it's terrific!! The wine gives the flavor some nice zip...but occasionally we have to sub chicken broth if out of white cooking wine, and the flavor is almost identical. I also add a soup can of milk to help keep the soup mixture from getting too thick and overcooking while it is in the crockpot. I originally thought it was strange to cook the mixture in a pan before putting it in the crock pot, but after doing it I could see why with using cream cheese (even when softened). Good recipe with good instructions. Love, love, love it!

i am NOT comfortable in the kitchen... and i'm not at all comfortable with cooking chicken... but this recipe is easy to make and it turns out to be delicious!!!  my family was BLOWN AWAY that the chicken was so moist and tasty... i followed the recipe exactly as it's stated.. and i used frozen chicken breasts that i bought in a HUGE bag from CostCo... i doubled the recipe and threw in 10 chicken breasts... i could've thrown in many more... there is so much sauce... i saved the leftover sauce and froze it for future use.  Excellent easy recipe that someone like me who doesn't cook HIGHLY recommends!

Overall, this dish had potential. My boyfriend and I both rated it a 6.5/10. I made this recipe after reading all the reviews and taking into consideration all the suggestions/alterations. Because reviews were saying it was too salty I only used 1/2 of the dry italian mix, and instead of wine (because I didn't have wine in the house - this never happens) I used 1/4c chicken broth and 1/4c water. This reduced the saltiness of the meal, but it still wasn't "the best chicken recipe ever". I cooked it for 4.5 hours, adding sliced mushrooms after 4 hours, and served it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli. Saved the chicken for leftovers. May make again with more adjustments.

Amazing! The changes I make are: 
I hate wine in food, so I take that out and replace it with a can of cream of mushroom.  I change the butter to greek yogurt. I also add fresh spinach and mushrooms, and serve it over ravioli or tortellini.

I have made this several times, I followed the recipe exactly the first time then started changing things such as using chicken broth instead of wine, adding sauted mushrooms, or adding frozen peas in the last 30-45 minutes, I normally serve it over pasta with a veg and salad. I also normally just throw in frozen chicken breasts and it works fine. It is ok, filling, I just wish I could make it taste more fresh. Thank you for sharing though, I will continue to make it with my adjustments.

Excellent flavor. I used "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter",Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup,and 1/3 less fat Chive and Onion cream cheese. Next time I'll make it with boneless chicken thighs and I'll probably throw in a few sliced mushrooms. I served it over bowtie pasta. Husband even liked it!!!

This is so simple and SO delicious! I'm new to slow cookers (like brand new just took my slow cooker out of the box)and what a recipe to start with. I made this with the exact ingredients listed. The only thing I did different is my slow cooker you can also cook on the stove top so I made the sauce in the slow cooker then made room for the chicken and covered them. On low I cooked it for about 5 hours and the chicken literally shred apart as I tried to get it out of the pot. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

Used regular cream of mushroom and a whole cup of white wine.  It was AWESOME!!  My husband and I AND my 5 year old and 2 year old ate every last bite.  Have made it twice in two weeks.  So easy for a working mom and it is delicious!

This was simply delicious.  We will definitely repeat it.   We ate it with white rice and a salad.

My family loves this meal. I add a package of baby carrots and serve it over brown rice. Also i only use 1 tbs of butter and low fat cream cheese. Great meal for whole family!

This recipe is great and super yummy!  I made it exactly as posted and it came out flavorful and creamy.  I've also made it with chicken broth instead of white wine and it was delicious as well.  I served it over puff pastries and my kids loved it!  It has become a staple in our dinner rotation!

Delicious! I substituted 1/2 cup chicken broth for the white wine and used regular cream cheese. The italian seasoning and the mushroom soup was enough flavor for us! It was very yummy and so easy! I'll be making this again!

I love this recipe! I have made this a few times and the first couple of times, it was good, but was really salty. This last time I made it with a couple of substitutions and it turned out perfect and delicious! I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom. I have never used the white wine, but used chicken broth before. This last time I just used a 1/2 cup of water in place of the wine/broth. I think this cut the saltiness down a lot and I will use water from now on. We have eaten this over rice and pasta before. I prefer it over fettuccine noodles, as it reminds me of an alfredo sauce. I cooked it about 5.5 hours on low in my crockpot. The chicken was tender and delicious!

I am pleasantly surprised.  ...and my 7 yr old picky eater liked it too.  Woo hoo!  The entire family ate it.  I served it with egg noodles and broccoli.  The chicken was unbelievably tender.  I scooped out individual chicken breasts but next time I will try shredding it and topping the egg noodles.  I will make this again.

I rarely rate recipes but this one was too good not too.  Amazing flavor, serious comfort food!  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, except I used chicken broth instead of wine.  Not too salty at all either, as some people said.  Loved it!

My family and I LOVE this recipe!  It's my go to recipe for yummy comfort food that we can all enjoy.  It's so simple to make, and tastes so delicious!  We usually eat it with noodles, but I've tried it with rice also.  Tastes great either way.

This recipe was excellent.  The only thing I changed was using an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and using chicken broth instead of the white wine.  I only did that because it's what I had on hand.  I served it over pasta with Garlic Bread and a salad. Very, Very Good!

I have to say this made a terrific "soup", the sauce was heavenly but the chicken was bland.  I should have sprinkled some salt and pepper on the chicken first.  I was scared away from the reviews that said it was too salty, so I used half of the packet of dry Italian salad dressing mix, wine instead of chicken broth and low sodium worchestershire sauce, this might have been a mistake but I always enjoy finding new challenges on this website.  I will do it differently next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

this is a recipe that really stands out.  Chicken can be boring - this recipe is not.  I've used Golden Mushroom and Cream of Mushroom soup - both outcomes were wonderful. The chicken melts in your mouth. Easy, cheap, tasty - does it get any better than that??  Thank you Jennie!

This recipe is absolutely to die for!  It's also so easy to make.  I followed the recipe just like it says except that I added chicken broth in the crockpot with the chicken before I put the sauce on top and I added mushrooms.  I filled it so that the chicken breasts were about 3/4 covered in the broth, then I put the mushrooms on, then I poured the sauce.  It made plenty of sauce this way and I served it with white rice.  The leftovers I served over angel hair pasta.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

I followed the recipe exactly. 
VERY easy! I was skeptical about using chive & onion cream cheese but the flavors blended very well! I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  Cooked on low for 6 hours, served with egg noodles.  Even my picky 8 year old cleared his plate! thanks!

First and foremost the sauce is amazing. I have the hardest time with chicken in the crock pot. I cooked the chicken as written. The chicken was dry. I will make this again but maybe on the stove and not the crock pot. That of course is a matter of taste. The flavor is amazing. I served over rice

WOW! Best chicken EVER. I did use regular Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the Golden, as I don't like the flavor of beef stock. Served over Jasmine rice, the sauce was delicious and the chicken was perfectly tender after 6 hours in the slow cooker on low. I will make this recipe again and again! Thank you!

I thought this was fantastic and easy to make!  I was a little skeptical about putting in the whole container of cream cheese, but I'm glad I did.  My husband doesn't usually like cream sauces and I was suprised how much he enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe exactly and two thumbs way up!

This is incredible!!  I put sea salt on the chicken breasts and let them "marinate" while I was mixing everything together for the sauce (I always salt chicken before crock-pot cooking, it really helps bring out the flavor.)  I did use about 1 cup (instead of 1/2 c) of white wine to make more "juice" for the dish.  I used cream of mushroom soup b/c I didn't have the other on hand. I also added appx 2 cups of baby carrots, but my husband said he thinks it took away from the flavor- but he did say it was still excellent!  While this was cooking I had an idea that adding some roasted tomatoes to this or as a side would be excellent!!  (Barefoot Contessa has a Roasted Tomato recipe that looks great).  I didn't have tomatoes so I couldn't do this, but I'll bet it would taste (and look) amazing!

I really liked the sauce, but the chicken was way too dry.  Two-three hours in the slow cooker would be more than enough.  Four is way too much.

This dish is as it says, "Heavenly".  We served it over rice and it was an easy and delicious dinner!!  Very flavorful and the chicken tender.  I did double the sauce as another reviewer suggested, because we really like things "saucey" in our house!!

This dish was delicious prepared exactly to recipe, and made A LOT of food. I served it with egg noodles (the flat dumpling style) and the recipe yielded 7-8 servings. I've been making slow cooker chicken stroganoff from this site for many years, but I think this recipe is more flavorful. Thank you!

The sauce was a bit thinner than I anticipated, but overall thought it was very good.  It went over well with my boyfriend and his buddy who came to dinner.

We loved this!  I didn't have Golden Mushroom Soup so I used regular and then added a couple tablespoons of dry Lipton Onion Soup mix.  Also, didn't have the cream cheese with chives so I used regular cream cheese and it was fine.  My chicken breast were still frozen when they went in the crockpot so I started on high for an hour or so and then turned the heat to low for another 4 hours or so.  Will definitely make this again as it is YUMMY!  I served with english peas and let me tell you...the sauce from the chicken served over the peas made them taste like creamed peas!  Oh, so good!

Delicious!  And so easy - as a Mom who's going back to school myself, it makes life easier to use the crockpot somedays.  The sauce was wonderful - I did substitute plain cream cheese, and used the breasts and thighs with bone and skin, but wow!  Terrific.  Definitely a keeper!

This was phenomenal with a couple of alterations...Canned soup has way too much salt, so I eliminated that in favor of a small carton of fresh mushrooms and a cup of sliced cherry tomatoes. In addition, I used Smart Balance instead of butter, and served over a bed of whole grain quinoa/brown rice. Healthy-ish & delicious!

My wife loves this recipe! I've been making it every week now. She loves the sauce and uses it over noodles so I like to double up on the sauce for her and make extra chicken for me. I use thighs, as it's our favorite cut of the chicken and it makes a delicious meal.

Love this spin on creamy Italian chicken! It is so good! I made it as written the first time minus the golden mushroom soup, used the regular kind because our grocer didn’t carry golden. Then I made it again last night and bulked it up with lots of fresh mushrooms and chopped onions and used plain cream cheese. Just threw it all in the crockpot and let it cook all day while I was at work and served over hot rice. Delicious! Don’t skip the wine; it adds a wonderful flavor! Comfort food at its finest!

I used the recipe but doubled it because we chose to make portobello mushroom ravioli to go with the chicken rather than rice and it was a good decision with this phenominal sauce. What we changed in the recipe were substitutions. I didn't have enough of the cream cheese so I added 8 oz of sour cream and it turned out wonderful. Depending on how thick your chicken breasts are check them at 3 to 3 1/2 hours to see if they need to be turned or moved. And  chicken, with that particular sauce... really good with pasta. My family are fans of this and they don't care for mushroom soup. For the soup I used 1 10 1/2 oz can Cream of Mushroom with Garlic and 1 10 1/2 oz can Cream of Cremini & Shitake Mushroom soup. (Campbells). I added 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic. Super good. Added the al dente ravioli the last 20 mins so as to not overcook. Thanks! Best base recipe and I give you credit!

I loved this recipe!  My switch-ups were: cut up the chicken into big chunks and then I used garden vegetable cream cheese and dry ranch salad dressing (mainly because its what I had on hand). Really delicious on rotini.

Been making this for a few years now and it's great! Kiddos and hubby like it. I always use regular cream cheese bc that's what I have on hand and chicken broth instead of wine. ..delicious!

First time making this and you do so many things with it.  Followed recipes exactly, topped with broccoli and some crushed rep pepper.  Very good.  A new go-to!

This was some of the best slow cooker chicken I have made. I followed the receipe except I used two packs of seasoning and red wine instead of white wine.

I sautéed and added 1 small onion and 2 garlic cloves to the recipe and covered the chicken with them before pouring the sauce over the chicken. I served the chicken over linguine. The recipe was very good except it was a bit too salty. I might try cutting back on the salad dressing mix as was recommended by other reviewers. Overall a very good meal and very easy to make.

I made this for dinner and it turned out great. The kids ate it and had no complaints. The only thing I would do is maybe reduce the white wine. Or not go with a "DRY" white wine. Because you could definitely taste it. I also pre-boiled some carrots and added them to the slow cooker.

I made this yesterday.  My teenage son was suspicious at first, but once he tasted it, he loved it!  He had it for lunch AND dinner.  My husband also loved it.  Great for recipe for us working moms.

Made as directed and it was very good. Lots of sauce to put over spagetti. It took 4 hours to cook as directed. This was easy to make and will make again.

This is a bit hit!!! I used a package of chicken tenders and only used half of the sauce so made another batch relatively soon after testing it.  Then I bought ingredients for several more pots, so I can make it any time.

I did it again..unfortunately. Based on the reviews, i made a meal with condensed soup. AND dry dressing mix..Yikes. You simply Cannot throw meat in with a can of condensed soup and expect it to be good. Its Not. Its Easy. Its salty AF, if you call that flavor..and it congeals into a gelatinous fatty horror the minute it starts to cool. You are what you eat people, stop the insanity. #eatfresh

Not bad but nothing special.  Added sliced fresh mushrooms  and more Italian spices due to reviews saying it was bland.  Served it with rice, small red potatoes and green beans.  Would make again using chicken thighs.

I followed the recipe except I didn’t use a full packet of dry Italian dressing after reading that some found it too salty. 
The chicken was tender and we had it over rice. My husband and grandson cleaned their plates so I rate it a success.

I read the reviews and used half a packet of Italian salad dressing mix, chicken broth instead of wine, regular cream cheese instead of  chives & onion. It was very tender and good "comfort food".

Wow! This was delicious!! Will definitely be in mum regular rotation. The only change I made was 1/4 c chicken stock and 1/4 c white wine vs the called for 1/2 c white whine. It’s awesome.

This was a quick, flavorful chicken meal that turned out pretty good. The only changes I made was to add water since I didn’t have any white wine. Next time I would probably add an ingredient to thicken the sauce a little. Will definitely make again.

My family quite enjoyed this! I give it 4 stars because it LOOKS  so bland that my husband was hesitant to try it. I'll have to add some color next time. Thank you so much for sharing! As to the complaints about salt, I used garlic and onion powders in place of salt, per suggestion, s and it was perfect :)

I made this for relatives, and it was very good, they really enjoyed it, although I thought it was very salty, so I added some water. It was a bit runny, so I added about 2 tablespoons of flour & water to the gravy to thicken. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the wine, and I served it over egg noodles. I also cut up the chicken breasts into chunks, and I also added 1 cup of frozen peas and 4 tablespoons of minced onion. Next time I make this, I will use low sodium soup, and only 1/2 pkg. of Italian dressing. It was very easy to make.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!! ??

Super easy and very tasty! My family loved it. I made the adjustments per another review, substituting chicken broth for the white wine and using regular cream of mushroom soup. I will make this again for sure!

This is an amazing dish!  I used regular cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 packet of Italian dressing mix and added Italian seasoning for flavor.  Also used chicken stock instead of white wine.  The sauce can't be beat!

This was AMAZING! I stuck with the recipe except for using chicken breast tenderloins (about 6, I think—I had them on hand already), regular cream of mushroom soup, and plain cream cheese (I used white wine instead of chicken broth and I’m. Served it with mashed potatoes & roasted broccoli and WOW this makes one of the best sauces/gravies I’ve ever had! Loved it so much that I slathered my mashed potatoes with it as well (it makes a lot of sauce). Yum!

When I retired and winter hit and I couldn't play golf, I got into cooking and gourmet cooking. My wife wasn't retired yet so II did most of the cooking. It has carried over since she retired. Made this tonight. I am not a fungus guy so I used Cream of Chicken, everything else the same. It turned out great. It will be a go to recipe. Plus it is so easy. I do brine the chicken first, Poke the chicken with a fork, 1 1/2 quarts of water,  2 TBS of kosher salt, 2 TBS of brown sugar and a few sprigs of thyme. Let it soak for an hour or more.in the fridge.  I'll also pound it if its not in a slow cooker. sorry for the tangent, recipe is good.

Been making this for 4 years and it is a family favorite. The only change I make at times is this - if I’m going to be cooking it all day in the crockpot I use thighs instead of breasts - they don’t dry out like breasts sometimes do.

This was very tasty. I made it exactly as instructed except I added some black pepper. The sauce could’ve been a little thicker. Next time I make it I will add some mushrooms and asparagus about half way through and then thicken the sauce a little. But it was delicious and I will definitely be making this again!

As another reviewer said,  it was salty, bland and needed something. I'm not  sure what is lacking, but my husband  agreed it needed something also. I doubt I make it again.

After chicken was finished cooking, I shredded it with 2 forks and served it over the angel hair pasta with the sauce rather than the pasta served as a side. Makes a great pasta dish.

This was very good, even all of my children liked it. I replaced the wine with chicken broth. I didn’t have onion chive cream cheese so I used regular cream cheese, a package of Lipton onion soup mix and some dried chives.

excellent.. even my picky kiddos loved it... 

The following week I was in a huge hurry for dinner and I bought a rotisserie chicken and made the sauce in a pan (ended up needing a bit more water than the orig recipe) and shredded the chicken into it and served over rice... delicious!

I made this. I thought it was good and had a different flavor. My husband did not like it at all, he said it was too rich. It is rich.  So if you are looking for a rich dish you will like this. My two kids ate it and said it’s ok. If your on the  Fence give it a try. It is pretty easy.

This was delicious and very easy.  I didn't have time to slow cook this, but I know it would be great in the slow cooker.  I baked it in the oven and it came out delicious.  I did make my own cream cheese mixture by adding regular cream cheese with some sliced green onions, and added garlic and onion powders, and some parsley.  I didn't add any extra salt, since the italian seasoning packets are a bit salty. The sauce was nice and creamy.  We served over top of angel hair pasta.  But I think it would also be nice over top of wide egg noodles or just by itself with some pasta and a veggie on the side .  Thank you for the recipe!

I loved the flavors of this recipe and  I made it almost exactly as it was written. One small change. The store did not have cream cheese with chives so I bought cream cheese and I bought chives. My first bites were great but I noticed how the chicken was shredding (because it was so tender) so I shredded the chicken, on my plate, half way through. I recommend shredding the chicken after it is cooked. So many recipes on this site over promise and under deliver. This one met the expectations of the high rating, and I expect it will be better tomorrow when I have leftovers. I followed the chef's suggestion to put it on top of a bed of rice and that worked well. Here is what I am amazed by. I calculated the total calories by adding up everything that went into the pot, divided it by the servings, and this rich, luscious dish is somewhere between 350 and 450 calories a serving, depending upon how much of the sauce you want to use. Low cal, delicious... my kind of meal.

So I followed the recipe, except a few things... First off, the Italian dressing mix in the store contains wheat, which is gluten, which I cannot have. So, I made my own version of this, which took care of the salt too (common complaint in reviews), as I added NO salt to the recipe. I used thyme, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, two to three pinches of sugar, a dash of paprika, a dash of ancho chili pepper (for extra kick), oregano, basil, and a few dashes of Mrs. McCormick's Garlic and Herb mixed seasoning. Everything else, such as chive and onion cream cheese, wine, etc, remained the same. Oh and I added a bit of Dubliner's cheese, to make the sauce less sour cream-ish, and more creamy goodness. Yum! I only had 3 chicken breasts, so I froze half the mixture for next time. Will make again!

This was great!  I didn't have Italian dressing mix so I used ranch but did everything else like the recipe said. My husband loved it. We will definitely make this again. I also used the sauce on pork chops which was delicious!

We didn’t really care for this as written.  The sauce broke down after 4 hours in the crockpot and was a runny, clumpy mess.  Next time I would just bake some chicken tenderloins by themselves, then pour the sauce made on the stove directly on the cooked chicken. Because the sauce is awesome!

Modifications: I used chicken stock instead of wine, Italian herb seasoning blend and a roasted garlic herb blend instead of the Italian dressing mix, extra thyme and onion powder, regular cream of mushroom soup,  and it was amazing. 
Served this over angel hair pasta with crusty roasted garlic Italian bread and YUM!

Hubby said this is a keeper!  Followed the reviewer's suggestion to double the sauce and cook it on the stove top.  Very yummy over pasta!  I used large shells because that's what I had on hand and it was fine.  Served it with steamed broccoli, also drenched in sauce.  Loved it!!!

Easy and delicious. I had cream of mushroom soup on hand so used that and couldn't find chive and onion cream cheese so used plain and added onion salt. We both loved it served over egg noodles. I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Very nice easy meal.  It was a little salty but not too much, just about right I think.  I DO like mushrooms so I added a small can of sliced ones.  Also, don't skip the wine, it added a little complexity to this simple recipe.  I'll be making this part of my regular rotation.

Didnt have mushroom soup so used cream of chicken and some jarred mushrooms.  Substituted Boursin cheese for chive cream cheese.  Delicious though a little salty for my taste.

This recipe came from Southern Living 2009 or 2010. The recipe title is "Italian Slow Cooker Chicken". It should be served over angel hair pasta. The white wine is necessary, so don't eliminate or substitute. Also, add a little garlic.

I have to say I found this rather  bland over all.   I added fresh mushrooms and carrots.      I can see it working well for a quick family meal with young kids.  Just not for us

Did not have cream cheese with chives and onion, so I used dried chives and onion powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Put over Kluski noodles cooked in chicken broth, water and 2 chicken cubes.  My son said he thinks its the best thing I ever made!

We made this for the first time this week and loooooved it!! Ridiculously good! We don't like a lot of salt so I followed another review by substituting regular cream cheese and only using half of the Italian dressing mix. I also used chicken stock in place of the white wine. We served it over angel hair pasta and it was to die for!

This is delicious.  We prefer thighs to breasts, but that was an easy switch and didn't require any changes to the recipe.  It's very rich so we only make it every few months, but it's absolutely fantastic when we do make it.

I make this in the crock pot and shred the chicken. Serve over noodles. We found it to be quite rich.  Do NOT use cream of mushroom soup, gotta get the golden mushroom.

It was delicious and everybody wanted the recipe. One Caveat:  I had very large chicken breasts and after two hours on low, I got nervous  and turned it up to high. After one more hour I cut through one and it still wasn't done so I left it on high for another hour. So two hours on low; two hours on high and perfect.

Really good!  I sautéed boneless skinless chicken thighs on each side, then placed them in the slow cooker.  I then mixed all of the other ingredients with the chicken juices in the pan used to sauté the chicken and heated.   I did not use white wine.  I Then placed that on top of the chicken in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for about 2 hours.  I Served it with stuffing and asparagus.  Yum!

This is delicious! Everybody in my family and the kids who tag along to eat at our house have all loved it, even if there happens to be left overs! EXCEPT, I do make one change! Nobody in my family likes mushrooms so I put all ingredients except the chicken on the blender and run it until you can't find anything that resembles a mushroom and nobody knows the difference! This also ensures all the ingredients are well mixed, not that it would t be otherwise!

I followed the recipe except I used chicken broth instead of wine and used 1 cup instead of 1/2 because we usually like a lot of sauce.  I ended up a little thinner because of it.   I thought it was OK but my kids liked it a lot.  The chicken was very moist.  I will agree that it was a bit on the salty side.  I think I would try using regular cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 the Italian seasoning if I were to make it again.  I made it with egg noodles but think it would have been better with mashed potatoes or rice.

This recipe is outstanding!! Everything was ready within the 4 - 4.5 hour time frame when using the low setting on my slow cooker. I used all of the ingredients as the recipe specified but I did add 3/4 cup of chicken broth and used 1/2 cup of Woodbridge Pinot Grigio since I doubled the sauce (as I was cooking additional chicken breasts). This one is a keeper! Thanks Jennie!!

I did make this but substituted several items simply because
I didn't have all on hand.  Wasn't pleased on how it turned it
Out but it was edible.  I plan to make recipe over when I have
all the ingredients.  This was my fault.

I love this dish!  I use cream of chicken soup as I hate anything mushroom and tenderize the chicken as well.  I add parsley for color.  So easy!

The chicken was very tender, and the sauce was nicely creamy. This was very easy to make. My 17 month old loved it, but my husband and I found it rather bland. It needs something added to give it more flavor.

I used the items I had on hand; for the dry salad dressing I used dry ranch dressing, used 1/2 C chicken broth instead of dry white wine also used sour cream as I was out of cream cheese. Still quite tasty!

I make this from time to time.  It is very flavorful. I am not a huge chicken fan but I really like it done this way.   I follow the recipe exactly. 

The only thing I do differently is serve it over pasta rather than rice.  The cream cheese and soup mixture make a nice creamy sauce that I thought begged to be put over pasta.

As other reviewers have stated, this chicken comes out very tender in very little time (4 hrs). It is however missing something; it's salty yet bland if that makes sense.  I can't quite put my finger on what it needs, but I tried pepper, basil, capers, garlic & none of these helped much. The sauce is a little on the thick side, so next time I'd add a full cup of white wine rather than half.

I made this for a VFW function and served it with penne pasta. A big hit. I substituted the white wine with chicken broth. 

The chicken turned out very tender.

I loved this recipe.  The sauce is incredible.  Normally I never make changes to a recipe the first time I fix it, but this time I made two changes.  First, it calls for 4 chicken breast halves.  Somewhere they must sell chicken breasts that only weigh 5 to 6 oz each, but not where I live.  I bought 3 chicken breast halves and even that weighed close to 2 1/2 pounds, almost 10 oz per serving.  I fileted them in half lengthwise and got 6 servings, but it tasted so good, I made 5 portions out of it and cut up the 6th and portioned it among the 5.  Second, I like wine in recipes but don't drink it.  I couldn't rationalize buying a bottle of wine to use half a cup and throw out the rest.  I wanted more "on edge" flavor than chicken broth would add, so I substituted apple juice and added a little bit of red wine vinegar to cut some of the sweetness.  I think it worked well.

I find all the recipes using Italian dressing mix are too salty for our taste.  Rather than reducing it, I use no or low sodium broths and soups to balance it out.  This does the trick for us.  I haven't tried this but I was told to mix the dressing mix with a few tablespoons of water - enough to make it a liquid.  Let it sit for 15 min and the salt will dissolve in the water, pour off the liquid and you'll be left with the seasonings.  if you try this, let me know what you think.

Made this for my family and they were polite, but I could tell they didn't care much for it, nor did I.  The mushroom soup was overpowering and salty. Next time I think I'll leave off the canned soup and use homemade soup instead.

This was extremely easy and tasted great. I will definitely make it again. My wife even liked it, and she never compliments my cooking. i highly recommend finishing the leftover wine while the slow cooker makes dinner.

This busy momma just put ALL of the ingredients in at once.  No pre-cooking of the sauce.  Just threw it all in and cooked it on low for like 8 hours.  PERFECT!!!!

This  dish was beyond delicious!! I served it over wild rice,. The sauce is amazing. I did tweak two things.. I substituted apple juice in place of the wine,  and adjusted the cooking time. (4 hours, on low, is not nearly long enough for the raw chicken..)You could cook on low, all day, or on high, for 4 hours, maybe. This recipe is delicious, and I would proudly serve to company, as well as family! This is a keeper!

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was fantastic. 
Before serving, I cut up the chicken and mixed it with bowtie pasta and peas, plus all the rest of the sauce from the crockpot and it was very, very good. 
This will definitely go into my meal rotation.

First ever review - It's a five star for me because it was easy, everyone ate and loved it and my kids are pretty picky. I did use cream of mushroom because I had that but not sure it would make a huge difference.

It was salty like some said but otherwise I thought it was bland. Next time, I'll probably add some mushrooms and some other spices, maybe some red pepper.

Looks great too!
OH!  I did not use White Wine, used Water.  Also used  a whole stick of Butter .  I did not want the Chicken to Dry Out.  No one likes dried out Chicken.  I also used Chicken Thighs instead of Breasts

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made it for my friend and I and he had two servings and asked if he could keep the leftovers to have for his lunch. I made two changes, because I had them on hand, I sliced up fresh mushrooms and cooked them in the butter, I then used Healthy Choice cream of chicken soup in place of the golden cream of mushroom. I then followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written and served with a brown rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Simple, easy and delicious. I will be serving this recipe at my next dinner party.

Ohhhmmyyyygaaaahhhhh!! So good!! Ate every drop and wanted to lick the plate too! No joke!! I mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl the night before, just microwaved it a minute or so, to make it easier. Then I submerged 2 chicken breasts and poked a few holes in them with a fork, gotta get all that flavor in there too! :) I dumped it in the crockpot at 6am, on low for 5 hours (since my food was cold and the crockpot would need time to heat up) kept it on warm after the 5 hours and by the time I came home from work...ahhhh. The smell was AMAZING! This dish was AMAZING! I popped one of those ready rice packets in the microwave for 90 seconds, while I plated the chicken. Poured the rice onto the plates and scooped all those yummy juices over the chicken and the rice....mmm mmmm delicious! My 16 year old son DEVOURED it. I usually don't eat an entire serving, I try to save some for lunch the next day, but this was gone in 10 minutes. I wish I would have made more!! I'm DEFINITELY making this more! A lot more!! 
(I added pepper, Italian seasoning, minced garlic and onion flakes, some said it lacked taste, this was perfect!!)

This is my husband's favorite! Only things I change: I use chicken broth instead of wine and cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom due to an allergy. Oh and I also don't heat it all up first, I just leave out the butter and mix everything else together really well, pour it over the chicken and let it go. I cook it 8 hours on low while I'm at work and serve over rice. I used frozen chicken breasts, too and I think that helps with moisture. I know they say not to, but that's how my mom always did it and I've never had any problems. Anywho, thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!

Easy and tasty recipe.  It can be salty so I use the healthy request soup (cream of celery or onion) and saute some mushrooms and onions to add to the sauce.  I also add minced garlic when I melt the butter.  Try adding Bells seasoning and/or Herbs de Provence to the chicken as well.  Adds nice flavor without salt.  Surprisingly the Good Seasons zesty Italian mix has a good bit less sodium than the regular Italian dressing mix.  Try it and I think you'll like it

If there were more stars that I could give this recipe, I'd give them more!  So easy to make & everyone loved it!  The sauce could be used for other meats or simply over rice or pasta for a meatless dish.  Absolutely perfect as it is.  Don't make any changes.

This was AWESOME! I made it for some friends and it turned out so good! I had accidentally misread the recipe and used cream of mushroom soup but it was still delicious! I have made it since and still use the cream of mushroom soup. I don 't use mushrooms in mine. My kids love it too! I made it with chicken dressing and used the gravy on the dressing too.

Fantastic recipe! We loved it the first time I made it by the recipe but we were left craving more sauce. So I double the recipe but use the 4 chicken breasts. I also add two cans of regular cream of mushroom on top of the 2 cans golden mushroom. I than shred the chicken when it's finished cooking, once shredded mix well into the sauce and serve over rice or pasta. It's incredible! Making it this way will serve a large crowd. I make it on special occasions and everyone raves about it.

I thought this recipe was easy and tasty! I made just about as written, the only thing I used different was cream of mushroom soup opposed to golden mushroom. I never cooked with wine before but I decided to pick up a small bottle of cooking wine. I'm glad I did because I really liked it. I even used some when making the rice to go along and it gave such a nice flavor....Who knew?!! I can see how some think it was a bit salty. I like salt so it was fine to me but it was a bit salty... I did cook 5 hours on low just to be on the safe side and the chicken was perfect. I definitely will be making this again.

This is the BEST crock pot recipe. It's the easiest recipe by far! It tastes great. I've read some reviews that say it is salty but it really wasn't at all and I'm a kind of person that doesn't like a lot of salt at all. I followed the recipe exactly even using the white wine. I've made this twice and the second time around I used 3 chicken breast and 3 pieces of chicken tenderloin. I also cook mine for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours instead of just 4 hours. I only do this because I'm paranoid about making sure my meat is always cooked very well. Overall I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Followed the recipe(added mushrooms to the saute) (doubled the sauce).  It was a hit with everyone.  This will go into the regular crock pot rotation.

Very good.  Even my picky son who doesn't like any sauces liked it.  Followed the recipe except used cream of mushroom soup.  Served with egg noodles and broccoli.

I don't know how the initial idea to blend these ingredients came together, but they are beautiful! The Italian seasoning with the Chive and Onion cream cheese is a reward to the palate! I did modify it a little bit, since my wife and kids don't like mushrooms. I used condensed cream of chicken instead of the mushroom and I also wanted to add a little acidity so I added a can of petite diced tomatoes (15 oz Hunts). Also, make sure you taste test the wine while preparing... this is key. :) The tomatoes really gave it a rustic Italian flair! I thought it would be a good fit over pasta, so I felt it wouldn't be enough sauce, so I also added a can of Cream of mushroom soup as well as 1/4 cup of chicken stock. I served over Egg Noodles and the family LOVED IT. I will definitely make again! Thanks a ton!

This is delicious!  The sauce alone is practically drinkable!  My family likes it with bow tie pasta, wild rice, or brown rice. Put a little sauce on your veggies, too!

This was pretty tasty and very easy. The only change I made was using frozen, bone-in breasts and cooking it on low for 8 hours. The meat just fell off of the bones.

Hubby loved it. He normally won't have gravy on anything but when I started to throw the leftover gravy away he said don't do that. We can put it on something else! Thanks for the delicious recipe. I used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of golden.

I only use half the Italian seasoning packet, otherwise it is too salty. I love the wine in this recipe, it really makes it! I make this every few weeks. It has become a staple. During the last hour I break up the chicken a little and give it a stir to make sure the chicken will be cooked through

Excellent! !! What I liked about this recipe was that it wasn't to rich.  I didn't have wine so I just used milk and I didn't have the mushroom soup so I used Cream of Chicken.   Turned out fantastic.  My 3 picky daughters loved it.  Definitely a keeper

I've made this a couple of times and each time, my husband says, "what is this?!!!!! It's delicious!" It's a very easy, very delicious meal. I made it as a main dish but when I serve it again, I'll put it over white rice with broccoli and pour that yummy sauce over it all!

I used Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup in place of the Golden Mushroom soup, I used a cup of low-sodium chicken broth in place of the wine, I used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and I served mine over No Yolk Egg Noodles instead of rice. Lastly, thanks to some comments madw by others, i cooked this on HIGH for the four hours and it came out perfect. I will definitely make this again!

Making this today yet again- my girls and husband love it! You could literally drink the sauce it is that good.  I follow the recipe exactly with these two exceptions- I use lower sodium soup and  6 chicken breasts instead of 4 only because that is how our grocery store packages them and I am too lazy to find another use for them. The dish is wonderful over rice or angel hair pasta.  I also cook it on low for 8 hours- a perfect comfort dish for a busy day!

I have made this many times now and even doubled it in a large slow cooker.  It is always perfect.  I like it with sherry instead of regular white wine, too.

I didn't have golden mushroom soup so I used regular cream of mushroom.  I used regular cream cheese as that's what I had here. I added some onion powder. Everything else was the same. My family raved about it.. My oldest son asked me to give him the recipe! Will definitely be making again!!

Followed the recipe exactly (except I left out the white wine. didn't have any). Turned out amazing, cooked egg noodles to put it over and served with breadsticks which everyone used to scoop up every last bite of the amazing sauce. This just went into our top 10 binder!

I sampled the sauce from the pan and it tasted great, then it smelled great while cooking. But when we ate it the chicken was dry and bland, and the sauce was almost too salty.

I just made this tonight for the family and they really liked it.  I didn't have any white wine, so I did without.  I'll probably make it the same way next time as wine tends to overpower other flavors.

Wonderfully rich and delicious winter comfy food! Tweaks: used 3.5 lb of boneless, skinless thighs (remove excess fat) instead of breasts (so much flavorful), used ½ golden mushroom soup & ½ cream of chicken soup, used Wishbone Parmesan Italian dressing ½ + cup instead of mix, used wine and chicken stock (½ & ½) but  found another ¼ cup of wine stirred in before serving, as well as a bit more (1tsp) of butter and 2 Tlsp of horseradish mustard really made it pop. Also added some favorite spices & herbs from Penzey's. Served over brown rice & quinoa, with steamed broccoli & sauce (Italian dressing, mayo & a dash of hot sauce) a glass of your favorite wine (robust red for me) or beverage & some rolls or crusty bread. I would use either the golden mushroom soup or cream of chicken exclusively, not mix them again.

My family loves this dish.  I use Cream of Chicken soup, and replace the wine with chicken stock.  I also saute 8 ounces of mushrooms in butter and add that to the crock pot.

I made this as directed and it was too salty to eat. We ended up scraping all the sauce off the chicken in order to finish it. Most of the reviewers changed the recipe. I won't be making this again.

This is so good - plenty of sauce for the rice too! The only change I made was to use 6 chicken breasts instead of 4.  I use smaller chicken breasts (4 oz. uncooked) so that may be why I could use 6 of them with the recipe. I had enough to put some of the rice with chicken and sauce on top away for another couple of meals- reheated really well...sauce didn't dry out.

My gosh. I had to tear the plate out of my husband's hand before he licked the plate. Served these with roasted new potatoes.  The sauce makes a fabulous gravy. What a fabulous meal. We will be fighting over the leftovers tomorrow.

This is one of my go-to recipes. I've made it several times, and as the recipe is written it is very good. The cooking time might be a little over-estimated, and I think 3 1/2 hours wont dry out the chicken as much. 

As written, 4 stars. The slight modification that I make is to add a little more wine.

This is my family's favorite slow cooker chicken recipe.  I do it just like the original.  Have used Boursin Shallot and chive in place of the cream cheese when I didn't have cream cheese in the house and it was just as good.

This recipe is pretty good. I put everything into the crockpot at once and let it all cook together for a lot longer, instead of pre cooking the sauce. The first time I made this, I accidentally used cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom soup and it made a huge difference. The golden mushroom soup makes the sauce a lot richer and more flavorful. Overall, it's a good recipe to use, just a little over exaggerated

So, I have super picky eaters who generally dislike chicken. They loved this! I ended up shredding the chicken into the sauce since they are more likely to eat it shredded. Served over some pasta, it was similar to a unique chicken alfredo. Will definitely add this to the rotation.

This was my first time EVER to cook in a crock pot and it was wonderful!  I halved the recipe because my cooker is tiny and can only fit two pieces of chicken.  I also didn't use white wine, but chicken stock instead.  Highly recommend!

I made this pretty much as specified except I added about 6 oz of mushrooms because I like mushrooms.  To my wife and I, this was a bit bland and could use a little more seasoning which we will consider, should we make it again.

Just tried this and loved it.   Only thing I  changed was I added mushrooms.   Will make again!

My husband and I truly enjoyed this dish! I made exactly as directed except that I added a large can of mushrooms because we like them so much, and he doesn't care for rice so I served it over bow tie pasta. This is definitely going into the rotation for guest dinners. Thank you for sharing a truly easy and delicious dish!

This was fabulous! The sauce was to die for. I did not have the packaged Italian dressing so just used a quarter cup of the bottled stuff and a tsp of Italian spices.  Can't eat pasta so I served with rice. I just wish I had some nice crusty bread to sop up the sauce. It was so good. Definitely a keeper. oh forgot to mention I did use a nice Riesling white wine in the sauce.

Very good recipe! Can make for company.  Only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of the wine.  The sauce is delish.  I made it in the crock pot because I like the aroma of the food cooking and like to have the sauce really soak into the chicken all day. Doing it on the stove as some people have suggested may not have the same effect.  Will make it again!

Since I have a family member allergic to chives and fresh onion, I changed the chive/onion cream cheese to regular cream cheese and added 3 tbsp of minced onion. Also doubled the recipe. I WILL be making this again, and often!

This was delicious.  I doubled the amount of wine as I felt the mixture was too thick.  The chicken fell apart, I cooked it for 6 hours!  I made noodles to go with this dish.

This was wonderful! Made with cream of chicken rather than mushroom because I don't like mushrooms. Also used chicken broth rather than wine and only 6 oz. of cream cheese because that is all I had. I used more chicken than called for in recipe just because I  knew we would want more. Served over egg noodles. My daughter and I both thought it tasted even better the next day. Will definitely make again.

It was a hit! I did add a tub of sour cream to decrease the saltiness, I'm going to do that again and 1/2 the Italian seasoning packet but otherwise this one is a keeper. My husband loved it!

This recipe was ripped off of Angle Chicken Pasta on this site.  You can make it on the stovetop in like 30 minutes. Just cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and saute until no longer pink. Add the rest of the ingredients. Done.

I absolutely loved this dish! I don't have a slow cooker so I just cooked on my electric stove and had to fool around with the heat setting. I followed the recipe exactly and my family and I enjoyed it very much. Will definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

1st time I made it my slow cooker wasn't working. The sauce and chicken were all ready so I baked it in the oven. Delicious. 2nd time I used my new slow cooker. Even more delicious.

Our family has a very similar favorite celebratory meal we call Grandma's chicken. We used sour cream instead of cream cheese and no wine. Grandma was a teetotaler. This is much better. I also added fresh mushrooms because I just love them.  Grandkids call me Mimi. I think this will be Mimi's Chicken for all our future celebrations.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a very easy and very delicious recipe! I used chicken broth in place of the wine and a zesty Italian dressing mix (because that's what I had in the pantry). I cooked on low for about 3 1/2 hours. The chicken was cooked and there was more than enough sauce for the angel hair I served with it.  Will most definitely make this again!

I just didn't enjoy it at all. The breasts turned out to be really tough and dry. Not a lot of flavor. Maybe I'll try it again with chicken thighs?

I made this recipe as written, and it was O K.  I really liked the sauce, but I think it loses something  with the extended cooking time. The texture of the meat is not really very appealing to me, as it almost turns to mush.  I will try it again, but instead of a slow cooker, I will use the oven for 45 mins to an hour instead.  Thanks for sharing.

Used half the chicken, (for two servings) but made all the sauce, which I used later with meatballs I had in the freezer. Used a sour cream dip, which needed using up, instead of the cream cheese. Very easy and tasty.

I use this recipe frequently, adding red pepper flakes. The only thing I do differently is to heat all of the ingredients in the slow cooker before adding chicken. Why dirty another pan when the cooker will need to be cleaned anyway?

This is so good!    I used 5 chicken breasts, and doubled the sauce.  I mixed the Italian dressing mix with white wine instead of water, but that's just a personal preference.  I do think it made a nice difference.   Put fresh mushrooms over top of the raw chicken in the first step and cooked on low for 4 hours.  Added the sauce and cooked for 2 more hours and you could cut the chicken with a fork.  Served over spaghetti and added a side of roasted broccoli.  Perfection.

Tasty moist chicken recipe.   Was a big hit!  Served it over zoodles.  Lightened it up as the sauce is thick and heavy.  Also added fresh mushrooms.  This recipe is a keeper

I loved this the first night, and the next then I didn't want anymore. I made it as directed but doubled sauce and was glad I did. I would make again in a pinch but I would only make enough to feed us for that night maybe a couple servings more.

I used one can cream of onion soup  and one can cream of mushroom.Also used chicken broth instead of white wine and plain cream cheese.I browned the chicken first in a pan sprayed with olive oil and seasoned with cracked black pepper.  Wonderful dish .Sauce good with some spatzele  or small dumplings. Will definitely make again. it is a keeper

I used chicken tenderloins and, since I didn't have cream cheese with chives and onions, I used plain cream cheese and added dried toasted onions and dried chives.  It turned out delicious and my husband said it's a keeper.  Served it over wild rice.

My kids, 7 and 9, loved this recipe! I didn't make any changes to the recipe but I did cook it differently. I threw everything but the chicken in the crockpot, set it on high for maybe an hour then mixed it really well. Then I added the chicken.  No need to use that sauce pan!

The best slow cooker chicken recipe ever. I've prepared this dish four times, tonight will be the fifth. Perfect every time, and a real crowd pleaser. I plan to try the same dish and substitute thick-cut pork chops ... just out of curiosity.

This was pretty good. The chicken was a little bland though. Smaller pieces of chicked would probably be better.

I made this for the first time and my family loved it.  We are very fond of mushrooms and so I added some.  The chicken was moist and we found the sauce to be very tastey.  This is a keeper.

LOVED this recipe.  Per other reviews, I did sub chicken stock for the wine and cream of mushroom soup for the recommended golden mushroom soup.  Other than these two changes, followed the recipe exactly.  Started the slow cooker at 11:30 am and cooked until 5:30 pm.  Served with angel hair pasta and a small lettuce/tomato salad.  The chicken came out SO TENDER!!  Hubbie couldn't get enough!!  Looking forward to the remaining leftovers tomorrow night ??  Thank you for posting this truly "heavenly" (and simple) recipe ??

Delicious, but because I changed it a lot it's hard to say I can rate the exact recipe. I used my own dry Italian seasoning mix to reduce salt, and added a Tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for the bite of the store-bought mix. And I served it on spaghetti squash to reduce pasta ... and it was delicious. MOST IMPORTANTLY it was just so simple to make, I'll make it again and again, but next time I will need to double the recipe due to popular demand in this house!

This was really yummy!  I actually made the sauce the night before and refrigerated and then put the chicken and sauce in the crockpot in the morning.  I see a lot of folks are mentioning it is salty, to avoid some of that I added about 1/3 cup of water and stirred to thin the sauce a bit.  I couldn't stop eating the sauce!

Hubs and I really enjoyed this dish.  I did not have cream of mushroom soup on hand, so used cream of chicken instead.  I used the chicken broth suggestion instead of wine, and thighs instead of breasts.  I seasoned the chicken with season salt, garlic and onion powder and let it set while I made the sauce.  We did not  find the flavor to be bland or boring.  Will certainly make this again!

I made this recipe as written with the exception of the Italian dressing mix. I need to follow a lower sodium diet. The sauce was delicious over pasta but the chicken was very over cooked after 3 hours. I will try it again with bigger breasts from the frozen state

This dish was surprisingly great with the unusual ingredients.  The only change in the recipe I made was to add half teaspoon of Montreal chicken seasoning. Made some linguine and broccoli and served all togther in a bowl.

Loved this recipe and only made changes just by doubling the sauce because it was so yummy!! 2 cans of the golden mushroom, 1 1/2 packages of the Italian Salad Dressing Mix, 1 cup of white wine and 1 1/2 containers of the onion and chives cream cheese.  The sauce was absolutely amazing and the chicken was fall apart tender.....I did also add chunks of Vidalia Onion at the bottom of the slow cooker as well as on top of the chicken, then added the sauce.  Absolutely a keeper and will do this again and again!

Excellent recipe!!! The whole family loved it. I used chicken broth instead of white wine bc it's what I had on hand and regular cream of mushroom soup bc I couldn't find the golden cream of mushroom and it came out delicious. Both the sauce and chicken were perfect. I served over thin spaghetti and everyone loved. I will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup so I used sour cream.  It still came out very nice and the chicken was so tender.

It was fine but I can't say I'd cook it again. The chives and onions cream cheese was too overpowering for me and the rest of the family felt the same way. It also lacked some fresh herbs for our taste.

When I saw the good reviews on this one, I had to try it. We were not disappointed at all! Definitely will be making this one again. I did not change anything this time around. The recipe does have a lot of opportunities to make it your own. I will surely be open to playing around with the sauce a little.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it. I've made it three times recently for family get-togethers and everyone has raved about it and asked for the recipe. I use regular cream cheese and add chives or spring onions. Sometimes I add 8 oz sour cream or use regular cream of mushroom soup. It's all good - always turns out great!

I have made this so many times it's hard to remember. I love it and so does my family. I don't make it often because it is rich, and probably high in calories. Although you could make some changes as far as the type of cream cheese and soup to use, but I love it as the recipe is written.

This is a great dish. I made as directed the first time, as I always do when trying a new recipe. I cut the chicken breasts in half. Now I sauté some onion and fresh mushrooms before making the sauce. Today I also added some frozen peas. Now I just need to make rice or noodles for a complete meal.

You can't go wrong with this recipe even for picky eaters.  It's delicious! The only thing I change is I use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.

This recipe is a regular in my household ever since I found it a few years ago. I love how easy it is and how few ingredients it takes. I skip the first couple of steps and just throw all the ingredients together in the slow cooker. I cook on high for a few hours and then stir the ingredients all together and serve over egg noodles. I, like other reviewers, substitute condensed low-fat cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup for the golden mushroom soup. I use regular, reduced fat cream cheese instead of the sour cream and chive. I also sometimes substitute chicken broth for the white wine and sometimes I leave out the extra moisture altogether. This recipe makes the most delicious sauce, even without it.

Just whipped this up and threw it in the crockpot. The sauce was very salty so I added some fresh ground pepper. I don't have wine :( which I'm sure would help it. I added a good scoop of sour cream, hopefully that will mellow the saltiness. I used the golden mushroom soup which I've never cooked with before, maybe that was the culprit? Who knows. Also my cream cheese didn't melt up very well, My sauce has white chunks in it, not very appetizing. Hopefully it will turn out ok, I don't have a back up dinner plan. I'll update later.
Updated, boring and too salty.

Delicious and easy. This was the perfect white sauce chicken recipe. I haven't made this recently, but I've made it quite a few times in the past and it's about that time to make it again. 

Instead of the Italian Style dressing packet, I switched it out for the garlic and herb. And instead of cream of mushroom, I used the 1/2&1/2 cream of chicken/cream of mushroom. I used whatever white wine I have on hand and I serve it over pasta. 

It's definitely not for those on a diet, but sometimes we all need a little comfort food.

Great dinner option for the family. My kids were skeptical at first but once they tried it they cleaned their plates and my littlest got more. I served this on top of some egg noodles with a side of fresh steamed broccoli.

I used the same exact recipe but let it cook on low a few more hours and it became pulled chicken with the flavor on every little piece. So good!

This is the BEST slow cooker chicken I've ever had! As soon as we had it I told all my friends about it! My kids LOVE it too and they don't like anything! I like to double the sauce and have the chicken with rice and pour the sauce on the rice too :)

Love it! Made it with pork chops and didn't have chive and onion cream cheese, so used fat free cream cheese that I had on hand. It was fabulous! Will definitely make it again.

Yes, I made this on 8/25/2014 and used the wine but did add some dried red pepper for a slightly spicy, but not-too-spicy version of this and served with pasta, fresh green beans and toasted French bread!! Absolutely will be making this again, DELICIOUS!

This was fast and easy, but it didn't knock my socks off.  Like others, I used cream of mushroom soup instead of golden mushroom.  The first time I made it I used 2 lbs of chicken and put it on rice.  It seemed quite salty to me, but I think it's because my sauce to rice ratio was too high.  The next time I used 1 lb or chicken and 1 lb of frozen broccoli and put it on shell pasta.  Much better and not salty when combined with 1 lb of pasta.  Next time I might use a little less pasta, though.  I added the frozen broccoli at an hour before serving like someone else suggested, but I think it was over done.  Maybe half an hour would be better.  I'm sure fresh broccoli cooked with the pasta would be best of all, but then the recipe isn't as fast to make!  I used the standard crock pot time, 6-8 hours on low and it turned out fine (4 hours is usually used for a high setting).  I also cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces before cooking.

Made this and am in love.  I used ranch salad dressing mix and standard cream of mushroom soup as that is what I had.  I felt the wine was a must in this recipe and totally gave it a unique flavor.  I will certainly make this again and add it as one of my recipe favorites.

Made this today and first of all, it was sooo easy. My husband is not crazy about chicken and I'm happy to report he loved it and asked me to make it again....that doesn't happen often, especially when it comes to chicken.

My husband is soooo picky that I dread his feedback when I try new recipes, but he LOVED this and so did my children and so did I.  Thank you so much!  I didn't change a thing other than using chicken broth instead of the wine as other's suggested (because I didn't have on hand), and it turned out divine!

This was wonderful!  We served it with wild rice and pan fried Brussels sprouts.  Also did it on the stove top per one reviewers suggestion.

My family loved this recipe! I doubled the sauce and added a bit of fresh onion, mushroom, and bell pepper.  I served it over angel hair pasta. It would have been good cooked with asparagus or broccoli too.

Like the other review above, I had high hopes for this but it didn't taste all that great.  Wondering if perhaps it was the white wine I used.  Also, using the flavored cream cheese seems to give it an odd taste.  I may try it again using chicken broth in place of wine and plain cream cheese in place of the flavored.

Wow! This was amazing! Only change I made was using chicken broth instead of wine. The gravy was absolutely delicious over cornbread dressing. We had a pre-Thanksgiving feast tonight!

We have Slow Cooker Day every week at work, and this week we made Jennie's Heavenly Slow Cooker Chicken. We followed the recipe exactly, except for tripling it and dividing it between two 6-quart slow cookers. This was a huge hit--even the pickiest sons and daughters loved it, and the adults all raved. We enjoyed it today heated up and served over mashed potatoes. Pure decadence. This is definitely going into the regular rotation. Thank you, Jennie, for such a crowd-pleasing recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I use white cooking sherry and serve over bowtie pasta. Use 2 forks and shred the chicken up a bit once its cooked.

This was awesome and so easy to put together!  I did use regular cream of mushroom soup,and only 4oz of regular cream cheese (that's what I had on hand).  The sauce was plenty rich.  I cooked on low for about 7 hours.  We served it over spaghetti.  Fabulous!

Tried this last nite for the first time.I felt the Italian dressing mix would be too salty, so I replaced it with a handful of Mrs.Dash. When I try a recipe from this site I try to stick to the way its written so I know what changes I will need to make in the future based on the results. This was okay and I will try it again, but next time I will cut the chicken breasts in half (as the ones I used were quite large) and also add some cooked mushrooms to the gravy in addition to using the Mrs.Dash. It was nice over pasta but would also be good over rice.

A pretty bland dish, except it is salty. The chicken was moist but that was because of using the slow cooker.

Loved it! Couldn't be easier, either. I made this exactly as written, except I used chicken broth instead of wine. I even put my chicken in frozen & let it cook all day. SO moist, & great over rice.

Very Good.  Served over angel hair pasta.  I used lower sodium cream of mushroom soup and lower sodium chicken broth.  Served with fresh asparagus pan fried and was very happy.  I will want to make it again.  I doubled the recipe so we could eat the leftovers.  Next day sauce was thicker and I liked it even better reheated in the microwave.

I used regular cream of mushroom soup and cut the chicken into 4 strips per breast.  It was really great!  I served over angel hair pasta (very creamy sauce) made some garlic bread and had a salad with it.  The ingredients weren't cheap, but it was a nice change from my normal crock pot meals.

I'm sorry, but I found this dish to be too heavy and the seasoning was overwhelming, salty and tasted fake.  I love to cook and eat and can appreciate decadence as well as anyone, but this dinner made me feel guilty eating it... like it was a big, convenience-food, processed, heavy mess. My kids hated, and my husband and I just managed to get it down.

Oh my, this was great! My husband raved about it. I know there are those who do not want to hear about changes to recipes in this review, but a good recipe can be adapted to fit personal preferences. So, my changes are as follows.....

I added extra can of plain cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup milk to cut the salt (would have been too salty for out tastes otherwise), and fresh mushsrooms. I halved the chive cream cheese and substituted chicken broth for the wine also. Served over fettucine pasta. For a side dish we had sauted squash, zuchinni and onion dish. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good. I used half as much chicken (should've used more) but came out with barely enough sauce. I had to add water to thin it out, and I'll have to add a ton more tomorrow for leftovers after it thickens overnight. If I'd used more chicken, there would have been barely any sauce for the pasta. I don't know what I did wrong, because it seems like everyone else had plenty of sauce!

Fantastic!  My store didn't have the golden mushroom soup, but other than that I made no changes to the recipe.  Tastes even better the next day.

Excellent. I adapted it for the pressure cooker because I forgot to thaw the chicken the previous night. I cooked the che
Icken for about 30 min. At minimum pressure and quick released the pressure. I thickened the gravy with flour and water.

The husband and I thought it was good, but the teenager has an aversion to crock pot chicken.  I cooked it in the crock pot, then baked in the oven the next night to warm and it removed some of that crock pot flavor.  I would make it again.

This was a little on the salty side, but overall was excellent.  Flavor was great.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs and the reduced fat chive and onion cream cheese.  Will definitely make again and again.

Using only two frozen chicken breasts, I made this as written.  It was so tasty and the chicken was super tender.  Before serving over farfalle pasta, I removed the chicken, shredded it, and added it back to the sauce.  The two of us still have enough for another meal, so I think I'll try it over basmati rice.  It was just a little salty, but the flavors are really great together.  I had to make my own Italian dry dressing....from AR.  This will be a repeat.  Next time, though, I may add a green vegetable to it as the color of the dish was kinda too white.  Thanks for posting this one!

The store I went to didn't have the proper cream chees blend nor the powdered dressing so I had to improvise.    Didn't use all the powdered dressing and used cream of mushroom soup.  Pretty good after all was said and done, will scout around and get the proper ingredients for next time.

This was a tasty dinner. My son and hubby really enjoyed it. I had to use plain cream cheese because that it what I had on had. I sprinkled onion powder into sauce. It was a little bland tasting, so I kicked it up a notch with red pepper flakes. Next time I make this I will make sure to use the onion and chive cream cheese.

Wow, is this a Great recipe for those Crazy-Busy days! Woke up yesterday and literally Threw all this into the Crock Pot. Got home 6 hrs later, boiled up some tiny rotini, steamed some baby peas for color and pulled out the rest of the wine. This looked rather attractive, with the peas and dash of paprika, on our big platter. 

Taste-wise, this was a big hit with my husband. A warm plate of "comfort food" after long work day.

This was delicious. I thought the sauce was a little runny so I added about a tablespoon of cornstartch at the end and let it cook for another 1/2 hour and thickened it up nice. I put it over penne noodles.

I don't know if I did something wrong or if this dish is just not my favorite.  To me, it was sort of bland.  The sauce reminded me of beef stroganoff sauce so I think that might have been a distraction from what it actually is supposed to taste like.  The chicken was super tender.  Everyone that I made if for (9 people) really liked it, so I think I will try it again.

Made this last night and it was very good.  I was out of wine (which never happens), so I used half chicken broth, half sherry.  Next time will try with the wine.

This is a hit in our household. I didn't have the recommended mushroom soup so had to switch for Campbells Creamy Mushroom with Roasted Garlic (I love garlic). Both are a big hit in with my family.

I made this today and it was really good. I had to substitute a few ingredients but I think the flavors would be the same. I used a Merlot (red wine) an 8 oz block of plain cream cheese with onion powder and dried chives to flavor it. I didn't have chicken breasts so I used 5 chicken thighs. after the 4 hours of cooking. I took the chicken out and removed the bones. Served over Angel hair pasta along side a green salad. It was so good and easy I know I'll make it again with all the original ingredients next time. Thank Jennie for a great recipe.

This is by far one of my favorite slow cooker recipes.  The sauce is delicious.  The white wine really makes it. I used ziti pasta instead.  And next time I will make bowtie pasta becuase it's a personal favorite.  I toasted whole grain bread and roasted asparagus as a side.  Delicious!

I finally got myself a crock pot and I had tried 2 recipes before this one.  Both were just ok, nothing that I would make again.  I was beginning to lose faith until I tried this recipe!  This was delicious and tasted as if you spent a lot of time developing flavors of the chicken and sauce.  I cooked it for 3.5 hours on low and it was perfect!

This was amazing!  I'm glad I only made two servings because I can't seem to stop licking the pot!  I did two things differently than the recipe.  First, I only used 1/2 a brick of cream cheese (added the chives seperately) and I warmed the slow-cooker first and then let everything melt in there before adding Chicken.  It was amazing! Thank you Jennie!

This is my new favorite slow cooker chicken recipe! I used a whole cut-up chicken and used half a packet of the Italian dressing mix, not changing any other ingredients. I did 8 hours on low because some of the chicken pieces were slightly frozen, but a shorter time would have been sufficient too.

The flavor was great! DON'T SKIP THE WINE! OR THE GOLDEN MUSHROOM SOUP! If you have tried golden mushroom soup you know it does not taste like beef broth at all. The only reason I did not give it more stars is because it is so heavy!!  My husband and I could barely finish 1/2 chicken breast each.

Sooo good!  Added half and half to make it more sauce-like and less gravy-like.  Also used cream of mushroom soup as I did not have anything else.  LOVED it!

Liked by all 4 kids - including the 2yr old.  I am happy to find a good recipe for boneless breasts in the crockpot that doesn't dry out.

This is absolutely delicious...I make this for my husband and stepkids on a night I always have to work late. It's so nice that it's ready in the crock pot when they walk in the door, and they always rave about how tasty it is. I follow the recipe exactly!

We loved this recipe, was really easy and delicious! I made it with plain lowfat cream cheese, and only ended up using about 4-6 ounces of it to reduce the calories. Served it over whole wheat fettuccini - yum!

My family didn't care much for this.  I don't know if it was the wine or what :(  I served it with rice, so maybe it's better with pasta!?!
