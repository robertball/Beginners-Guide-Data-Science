This is a really good, quick, and easy recipe. That much chili powder is NOT for the faint of heart, though...I cut it back to 1/2 tsp, and it was still quite spicy. The asafoetida powder (which you can find in an Indian grocery) really makes a difference. A little pinch goes a long way. Also, if you use frozen okra, they do leave the tips in, so make sure to take them out first!

My husband made this and didn't change a thing -- it was perfect!  Not gummy at all.  Tasted almost exactly like the okra dish at our favorite Indian restaurant in Irvine, the Clay Oven.

I used 2 cloves garlic instead of the asafoetida powder.  I also used vegetable spray instead of the oil.  This great tasting combination makes me want to make more soon!
