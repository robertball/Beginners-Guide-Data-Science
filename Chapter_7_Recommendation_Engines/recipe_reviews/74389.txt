My mother's recipe for these cookies came from a friend in the mid-1950s, so they've been around a while. My version calls for 2 teaspoons of vanilla and no salt. I made them for Christmas with chopped cherry jam (from Door County, Wis.) and drizzled melted white chocolate over them. I have never had a problem with them speading too much.

Lovely cookies in a flash with what you have on hand!  I used strawberry jam and drizzled melted white chocolate over them after they were baked and sliced.  Next time I'll sub almond extract for vanilla.  Be sure you do leave the 4" of space between rolls when baking, they do spread.

These cookies are both simple and delicious- when I have made them in the past, people clamored for the recipe. It's easy to vary them with different flavorings and jellies (cinnamon and orange marmalade, for example).

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and the cookies turned out perfectly.  I made half with raspberry jam and half with cherry jam.   I did not have a problem with the cookies spreading while baking, and only had them spaced maybe 2-inches apart. I sprinkled the sides of the cookies with pearl sugar before baking.  It gave the cookies a nice extra crunch and went along well with the jam.  I did not drizzle with white chocolate, but may try that next time.  I will definitely be making these again!

This was very good! I had a little accident though - not sure what happened. All I know is they turned out flat. They kind of... melted in the oven. I'm 98% sure it was my fault because I don't think I put in enough flour. However, they were still FABULOUS as far as taste was concerned!

These cookies are gorgeous.  I wanted something fast and easy and whipped some up on a whim.  They have since become the cookie everyone asks me to make.

This was good - kind of like a sugar cookie w/ raspberry jam.   I accidentally melted the butter and it still turned out fine.  Easy to make.  I sprinkled powered sugar on them when they were cooling.
