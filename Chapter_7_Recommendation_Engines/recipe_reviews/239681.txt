I really liked this recipe and it was very easy to make.  I did tweak it a bit though.  I made it lower fat using low fat soup and cheese and whole wheat tortillas.  I used steak as well.  I figured it should taste mexican so I added chili powder, a dash of cayenne pepper and some garlic salt.  It had a perfect kick.
