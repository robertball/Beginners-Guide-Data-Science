I cut the recipe in half & chickened out of adding all the rum (I used Bacardi Gold). It was still wayyyy too strong. Maybe white rum would be better suited. I had to add about 1/2 cup of heavy cream, additional sugar & since I was having to add additional ingredients, I went ahead & threw the other half of the egg in. I served it over halved strawberries, blueberries, grapes, honeydew melon balls (they weren't really complemented by the rum flavor so I'd leave them out next time), & halved, pitted bing cherries. Served it in raw sugar-rimmed martini glasses, garnished w/ a scoop of whipped cream (I just used Cool Whip since I had some in the fridge) & a sprig of mint. It was very enjoyable after it was modified...I'll have it again but I'll only use half the rum, if that. BTW the rum flavor does mellow some once it's on the fruit & mixed w/ the Cool Whip.
