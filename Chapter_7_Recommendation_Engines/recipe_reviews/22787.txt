My recipe for the same calls for only one cup butter, one cup brown sugar, and one bag of chips.  The most important thing to remember is to make sure that you bring it to a boil AND THEN set your timer for 3 minutes.  My mum still hasn't figured that part out yet.  (hers separates in the fridge-- still tasty, but poor texture)  Everyone loves it, and it is so very simple!  I put mine on cinnamon grahams sometimes... they're a little sweeter.  My favourite is still the saltines, though!  You can also toss a handful of white chocolate chips on top with the dark chocolate, and swirl... it makes them very pretty.  I have relatives who are allergic to nuts, so I just sprinkle holiday jimmies on top, too.  Very versatile, and ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!

Also of note, try the Reynold's No Stick foil to line your pan! It works with no additional effort!  I use it for EVERYTHING!

I have made this recipe for years.  I would note that using a 10 X 15 JELLYROLL pan (with sides) is ideal.  I use only 1 Cup butter and sugar and 1 pkg chocolate chips.  Sprinkle the chips on right after you take it out of the oven, let sit for just a minute to soften the chocolate chips and then using a spatula, spread the chocolate to completly cover the toffee.  Then add either nuts, sprinkles or even another flavor baking chips.  I use sprinkles for whatever occasion/holiday I am making this for.  If using other two kinds of chips, swirl it to give it a marble effect, don't worry about the toffee it can take it!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. But I only use 1 C butter, 1 C brown sugar, and 1 bag chocolate chips. I like to use milk chocolate chips because it makes the recipe sweeter.  I also line the pan with parchment paper, because when you do it with tin foil it sticks to the bottom and if you accidently bite into a piece of tin foil it HURTS!

This tasted fantastic. I used pecans instead of the almonds. I would recommend revising the recipe and add that you need to put a non-stick spray on the foil before you put the crackers down. I had the aluminum foil stick terrible.

I have been making this recipe for years and my family and friends just love it!  
My recipe calls for 1 cup of butter and 1 cut of brown sugar.  To help with the sticking problem, I use the non-stick aluminum foil or lightly spray aluminum foil with a non-stick spray.  I have absolutely no problem removing the candy with the prepared foil.  
Enjoy and make plenty.

My family loved the taste of this. Make sure your crackers fit the whole pan. I had about half a cracker width left, and decided to leave it that way. When I took it out of the oven, my crackers were floating, and swimming around the sheet. I will also add less chocolate chips next time.

I also used the cup of butter and cup of brown sugar. I also leave out the nuts. With this recipe butter is a must. Margarine if you absolutely can't but, never tub margarine. It contains water and ruins just about everything you cook with it.

This a great recipe!  It is so good I give it as gifts at Christmas time.  I put it in clear little bags.  I have to force myself to not eat before I have it bagged.  Excellent

Everyone who tried this loved it! It is so easy to make.
I did use a bigger sheet than what is called for - makes it thinner and easier to break.
Highly recommend!

My kids couldn't wait the 3 hours.  I used another reviewers advice and spunked them up for the kids with sprinkles. Even tried butterscotch chips and white chocolate.  The kids said they tasted like ice cream!?  I was looking up an icing recipe and came across this.  Thank you!  (We are stuck in the house from snow!)

Wonderful! Highly recommend thoroughly spraying foil with cooking spray first. If you like less chocolate, use just one bag. Must use real butter, not margerine.  Also, before you put in fridge to cool, make scoring marks in the chocolate with a knife so it's easier to break when cold.  Addictive!

I made this candy and was excited about how easy it was. Used tin foil and was disappointed when I went to break it up and foil wouldn't come off bottom had to throw the whole thing away! I may try again because it was easy but ill use parchment or spray should add that to recipe!

RIDICULOUSLY PERFECT!! Go figure, I slaved over some deserts and everyone asked me for THIS recipe. It was embarassing that it was so easy and popular! Thank you!

Very good!  I cut the butter and brown sugar to 1 cup.  I believe my jelly roll pan holds roughly 36 crackers.  Next time I will spray my foil generously as it was a bit difficult to remove the foil from some parts of the candy.

I lowered the butter and sugar to one cup each as suggested by other reviewers and this was wonderful!  I ate way too much of it since we got snowed in the night that I made it.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe that I always loved as a kid.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used a cup each of butter and brown sugar. I made no other changes. This was very simple to make and really fun to do with my boys. Next time, I'd like to try this with pecans.

This is my new favorite treat! I followed other reviews & decreased the butter & brown sugar to 1 cup, but I think next time I'll use the full amount. You have to start timing after it comes to a full rolling boil, but be careful because it can quickly become too thick. I also sprayed the foil generously with Pam & didn't have a problem with it sticking. I had a little extra room after putting on the crackers, so I pulled up the edges of the foil to fit closely around the crackers. I mistakenly used only 1 bag of choc. chips, but it was more than enough. I may even decrease these next time, & add butterscotch chips. I also left out the nuts, didn't miss them. Once it cooled down I put it in the freezer for a while & it broke apart easily. This is so good!

Only used one cup butter, half cup salted & half cup UNSALTED since I made it before and the crackers make it way too salty.  Used the whole bag of chocolate chips too -- good recipe!

We now have a new favorite dessert!  This recipe is fabulous with both soda crackers and graham crackers.  The only change I made was to decrease the chocolate chips to about 1/2 handful, just enough to streak the surface of the candy, otherwise we thought it overpowered the caramel flavor of the candy.  I also toasted the chopped almonds in the oven for a few minutes before sprinkling them on the candy.  A GREAT recipe!

I have made this a few times for our annual Christmas party. Every year people ask me how to make it and rave about how good it is! Sooo easy to make and looks divine with crumbled nuts on top.  It's a perfect holiday gift when you break it up and put it in a nice little box with a ribbon!

One thing to note: The chocolate chips do not melt from just sprinkling them on top....I had to sprinkle the chocolate chips on top and then place it back in the oven for 4-5 minutes to allow for the chocolate to melt to the point where I could spread it over the mixture.

had a major sweet tooth and this recipe caught my eye since i had all ingredients in the house. Except for the chocolate chips. Instead, I used some hot fudge sauce, melted until really thin, then swirled it over the top. After 30 minutes in the frig it was ready and so verry yummy. This made my permanent recipe file!

I made this just as written and I wish I would have read the reviews first. Way too much butter. I realized the crackers were going to be soggy so I kept them in the oven longer. It helped and they tasted pretty good but the moral here is...read the reviews.

Excellent and easy! One would never know there are crackers in it. I like this recipe because no advanced candy skills are necessary (and no candy thermometer!). I was out of Almonds (hubby must have found them) but they were fine without. Tasted like a Skor bar! MMmmmmmm! I will make these again!

So, the first time I made this, I made the mistake of not using real butter, I used Imperial Spread which made the candy taste like butter candy (not in a good way); Rookie Mistake.  I also did not wait for a rolling boil to start counting the 3 min timeframe.  The last time I made this, I also made the mistake of overlapping the foil instead of folding them together which made a mess of my cookie sheet.  It still came out okay and people liked it.  

I tried it again last night for a Secret Santa gift and I made sure to use Unsalted Butter, start the 3 minute timeframe from a rolling-boil, and used NO STICK foil, and they came out fantastic!  I handed them out to my co-workers and they could not believe I made them!  The diretor of my company has requested this candy as his X-mas gift.  I am definitely making this again and again!!  Great recipe!

A friend gave me a variation of this recipe, which only calls for 1/2 cup butter, seemed to turn out OK for me. Her recipe didn't have nuts (good for me, as I am allergic) and used 1 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 bag of peanut butter chips, a nice variation if you really like PB & chocolate as I do!

I love this recipe!  I got it from a coworker who makes it for potlucks.  I made it for Christmas and it was quite a sensation; our version did not have the almonds though I'm sure that makes it even better and even more like roca.

If you are tempted to use milk chocolate though... - don't.  I tried it out of curiosity and it's sickeningly sweet and nearly inedible; the semi-sweet is the best way to go.

Wow!  This was great!  I will definitely be making this more often.  Not just around the HOLIDAYS! I toasted my pecans first before sprinkling them on the chocolate.  I also used a 425 degree oven.

This is very good, rich , chocolatey and delicious! I used Milk chocolate chips and omitted nuts. Beware, addictive and you will find yourself needing a big glass of milk! I make this on a clear day as its kind of like a candy. Very simple, too. Easy to make multiple batches (that could be bad or good). I have made this with one cup butter/and one cup sugar and one package of chips with just as good results, too.

A friend suggested I make this a couple of weeks ago. I've made three in the meantime switching between semisweet and milk chocolate. The last one I made half and half.  This is a new family favourite and won't be made just at Christmas time!

I had just finished making the JIF buckeyes (peanut butter balls) and had some leftover melted chocolate that I didn't want to waste, so I added more chocolate, remelted it all and after the toffee had baked I just poured and spread the melted chocolate over it and sprinkled with chopped almonds. It turned out great and I think maybe it was easier using already tempered(melted) chocolate. Good recipe tho and nice flavor.

Tasty treat! Try making it with cinnamon graham crackers, granulated sugar instead, & with or without the chocolate. Made it both ways and it still is melt in your mouth awesome!! Also spray foil with Pam. Makes removing the candy easier!

So tasty!  The only problem that I had was with the chocolate chips and almonds falling off when I broke the candy up into pieces.  Made it difficult to still make it look pretty, had to pick through the pieces to find pretty ones to give to neighbors.  I used 1 bag of semisweet chocolate chips and the other bag was the new chocolate/carmel swirl chips.  Turned out so good.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This version of soda cracker candy came out too gooey for me.  It didn't set well.  I like using one cup of butter and sugar better.

Very good taste and VERY sweet!  I wonder if I did something wrong though because the bottom of the roca did not harden.  I let it chill for over 4 hours but the bottom was gooey.  Still tasted good though.

Excellent!!!It had wonderful flavor. Tips-Just use tin-foil on bottom of pan in stead in completely lining it, and use butter margarine is way too oily. Great treat on cold winter nights.

Okay, at first I was kind of questioning the soda crackers, but it was wonderful!! The only hard part was removing the tin foil after it was in the fridge. I may have let it sit too long before breaking it up. Very Yummy! Thanks!

I've been making this for a couple of years since my aunt gave me the recipe verbally. I'm so glad I now have a hard copy to follow! 
I toasted some chopped pecans and threw them on top and they turned out great- you really can put anything on top of these!

MY wife has been making this same recipe for many years at Christmas. She could not find her recipe this year so I tried to find it on the internet. She told me she already tried and could not find it on the internet. She was surprised that I found it. Her recipe is a little different 1/2 cup less butter and sugar. Our kids, friends, family as well as myself love this. Highly recommended, don't be scared off by the soda crackers, it adds a crispness and all blends perfectly. Once you make it you will be expected to make it again and again.

I've had this kind of candy before and this recipe just does not work well and is only for the EXTREME sweet tooth. I followed the recipe exactly and I had enough toffee for two trays of saltines and most of it ended up under the crackers once it came out of the oven anyway.  Parchment paper worked well, I had no problems with clean up or sticking, but overall I've had much better, sorry

What could be easier? This is easy and delicious. I get requests for this every year (and sometimes in the middle of the year). The only variation I make is I use crushed "nut topping." For some reason, I like the taste better. You'll love it - give it a try!

This is a perfect recipe to involve children.  My 8-year old grandson made this candy with my supervision.  He measured the butter and brown sugar into the pan.  I started the melting process while he lined the pan with crackers.  About the time the toffee was coming to a boil he was able to take over with the stirring.  I poured the toffee over the crackers and he completed the rest.  This recipe is easy and requires little time to complete--essential elements for keeping his interest.  He had an ear-to-ear grin when his mom and dad had such high praise for "his" candy!  We used parchment paper to line the pan and it worked perfectly.  We even forgot to preheat the oven so the crackers and toffee had to hold out for 5 minutes before going into the oven and it still was a success!  Instead of nuts we topped "his" candy with toffee bits.  So Good!

I was so bummed this did not work for me. I don't know if it is something I did or what. The toffee part was underneath the crackers & the top fell right off. I made this recipe after my sister brought some on Christmas. Her recipe did not call for cooking the toffee part just melting it & pouring over. Hers was better than mine. I'm going to try again one of these days!

I followed the recipe as written (first time habit) and it was a total fail. Yes, a thermometer NEEDS to be used as the base never got to the temp needed just by boiling for the few minutes. Most of the nuts fell off even though they were pushed down. I will not waste all the butter it takes on this recipe again. Very disappointing.

I love this recipe! My mom got it from a co-worker at Wally World when she was working there.  Tastes like a good toffee candy. We didnt put nuts in ours because mom has no teeth! She is no longer with us so bake a batch and share it with friends! You never know what tomorrow may bring!! Be safe and enjoy!!

edges were burnt; I will make it next time with the oven temp lowered and use a pastry sheet instead of foil.

I didn't have almonds so I crushed up a couple of Heath bars and put it on top of the chocolate chips.  Huge hit in my family and now a holiday favorite everyone asks for!

It was fine made how the recipe states. I wish I knew how to keep the saltines from "floating" up while baking but once I took it out of the oven I just pushed them back down. Also forgot to spray the aluminum foil. It stuck to the bottom of the crackers. Not a big deal, just a pain to peel it off. If anything, I may reduce the amount of chocolate chips on this one. I sprinkled Christmas sprinkles on top instead of nuts for a more festive look.

What a fantastic recipe! I had no problem with the chocolate coming off the toffee. Just made sure to use a candy thermometer and bring it up to a soft crack temperature. So yummy!

Made the adaptations suggested by other reviewers and loved it!!  Here are the adaptations I used:

1 cup brown sugar,
1 cup unsalted butter, 
1 bag chocolate chips (12 oz),
1/2-1/3 cup toasted pecans (I chopped them fine, like you'd find on Almond Roca),
Used parchment paper on baking sheet (not foil),
Filled in gaps on baking sheet with half crackers, so there was not room for them to slip and slide during baking,
cooked butter and sugar for a full 3 minutes after it came to a boil,
baked at 325 degrees for 5 min.

After adding the chips, baked for one more minute to make sure all of the chips melted.  

I sprinkled fine pecans onto chocolate and slightly pressed into the chocolate so they wouldn't fall off after cutting.   

I put the sheet in the freezer for 30 minutes. It came out firm and ready to serve.  

I used my chopping knife and carefully cut into nice squares while on the baking sheet.

The first time I made it, I used pecans instead of almonds.  I made it again a few minutes ago and used walnuts and half semi sweet and half milk chocolate chips.  My family loves this and it is so easy to make.

I have made this "cookie" before using another recipe and it turned out fine.  When I couldn't find my own recipe today, I resorted to this one, and the result is certainly not nice enough for a church bazaar as intended.  Although I followed the instructions, boiling the syrup for a full 3 minutes, the toffee part never did set into brittle as it should have. It probably needed a couple of minutes more but I was following instructions.  As well, there was so much toffee that it ran out of the pan and burned in the oven. The proportions for this recipe seemed so wrong that I went looking for my original recipe and finally found it:  1 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups of choc chips melted with 1/2 cup butter and drizzled over the top before adding about 1 cup almonds.  I'd have another go but I've used up all my butter and brown sugar.... :(

Reynolds wrap makes a non stick tin foil.  It is WONDERFUL,  or use parchment paper(not wax).  Either one makes for an EASY CLEAN UP,!!

I too used a cup of butter and a cup of brown sugar, plus the no-stick Reynolds foil, and they popped right off the pan.  They turned out really well albeit a bit sweet.  I think next time I may use the ritz crackers that are half pretzel.  That would be delicious.  An easy, child-friendly recipe!

This is a favorite in my house.  I've made the recipe as is but I've also used the following variations: instead of saltines I've used ritz, club crackers and pretzels. The salty crunch on the bottom is an amazing contrast.  I made this yesterday with gluten free pretzel sticks, finely chopped almonds and used coarse salt with the nuts and it turned out amazing!  My family always asks for this recipe and it's a must have around the holidays.  No one ever believes me when I tell them how easy it is!! The key for the best consistency is to make sure to slowly melt the butter and brown sugar then once it boils, it needs to boil for 3 minutes. I also leave it in the frishe overnight.

I've been making this recipe for years and around my house it is called "crack" since it is soooo addictive.  When made, it is gone in less than 24 hours which requires a second batch to be made promptly.  My cousins visited from Minnesota and ate the whole batch in the span of 5 hours.  I would say it should be a staple in everyone's recipe collection.

I make this recipe with 1 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 sleeve soda crackers and 2 cups Chocolate chips. At Christmas time, I like to use the red and green m&m's in place of the almonds (peanut are best, but I've used almond or even the mint ones to make it nut-free). One bag will do. Put the candy in a large Ziploc bag and smash them with a rolling pin. Very festive!

My mom makes this every year over the holidays, and it's my absolute favorite candy/dessert. I've been eating it since I was old enough to chew, so I may be a bit biased here, but there's nothing quite like it. I even had it instead of a birthday cake one year! 
The one thing about this particular recipe - there's too much butter. My family generally uses about 1 cup. I would recommend putting nuts on half of your batch, as they make a great addition, but those who hate nuts still need to be appeased.

The first tome I made this I either cooked the mixture too long or left the crackers in the oven a little too long, and it tasted a little overdone with too little toffee remaining.  It takes some time to figure it out based on your oven/stove, but it's yummy when you do!

I turned down the oven to 350 degrees as the first batch I made burned on the edges at 400.  Once it's in the oven you really have to watch it after 2 minutes.  I have a new oven so it wasn't my oven temperature that was at fault.  At 350 candy turned out perfect and it was the first to go at our holiday lunch!

I have made this cookie/candy for the past several years after having it as a gift one year.  My daughter and family love this candy.  She is now old enough to help make it.  Enjoy!

This is very good but I have had it before where there was less toffee and chocolate and like it better.  Next time will only use a cup of butter and brown sugar.  My toffee also went to the bottom of the cracker, maybe because I put too much on??? Sprinkled with Christmas sprinkles and it looked great was just a little too much toffee and chocolate for me.
**
Update much better with 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar.

This recipe is soooo delicious! I havn't tried it with the almonds, so I'll have to try this soon. When my mom made this, she also didn't allow it to boil before pouring it in the pan (i'm assuming this is what happened) and the mixture seperated. Still tasted great, but a funky texture.

Was going to make this for Christmas presents but was dying to try it so I made a batch last night.  This was TO DIE FOR!  I used just one bag of the semisweet chocolate chips and that was plenty.  Next time, I will use the Non-Stick Foil because I had a hard time getting it off the foil.  This is so good, it should come with a warning label.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was good... But had way too much chocolate for me. I'd cut back to one bag next time.

Very very good.  My husband was so upset when he found this in the kitchen when he got home from work as he is on a diet.  To say the least he totally fell off the diet wagon that night.   TOO hard to resist.

Wow, this was good.  Very easy to make, but extremely rich.  I'll make it again for gifts. Also, try the chocolate brittle surprise recipe that's on this site.  It's similar but isn't quite as rich.
