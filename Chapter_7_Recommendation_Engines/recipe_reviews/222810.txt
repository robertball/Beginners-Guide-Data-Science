This is an exellent go-to recipe for pasta salad. I made this almost every week during the summer months.

I made this dish for work and a family gathering and they loved it.  The sausage and olives in with the cheese taste so good

great tasting and very easy--my kind of dish!
I did not add the garbanzo beans or green olives b/c i don't care for either one, but still it is delish.
