I used celery instead of celeriac, and sorghum flour instead of ap flour.  I probably would have enjoyed these more if I had let the vegetables soak with the salt to release the natural liquid for about 30 minutes before adding the flour.  I dry fried these like they were pancakes.  Somehow, I was hoping there would be more flavor!  I think next time, I will add other seasonings in addition to those listed.

I used wheat flour instead of white and it still worked well.  Hubby really enjoyed them.  If you like middle eastern food this is similiar to baghis(sp) in Indian cooking.  YUM!
