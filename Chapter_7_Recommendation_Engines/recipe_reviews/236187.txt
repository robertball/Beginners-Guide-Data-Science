Thought it was great! I used a little less broth than was called for; 6 cups total. Also substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Everybody loved it! Thanks.

The soup ended up with a very good flavor but was very runny. If I make it again I will make some changes; fry the bacon first so it is crispy and not rubbery; remove the bacon and fry the onions with the bacon grease and a little butter and make a roux for thickening
