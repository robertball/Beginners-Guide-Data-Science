Your mouth will do the jetter bug with this nicely chilled drink in it !!! the fresh pineapple is a great touch to it ! But I also used the juice from the fresh pineapple instead of can pineapple juice, and that really made a huge differance. Go ahead and let your mouth do the jetter bug!   ^..^

I've looked all over for YEARS for the recipe for a Singapore Sling.  I was so pleased to run into this one while browsing the allrecipes site.....one of my favorite pastimes!   Will be making these wonderful fruity/sweet-tart drinks soon!  Thank you Home Happy hour
