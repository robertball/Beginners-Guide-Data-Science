I really liked this recipe. The marinade was excellent! I only marinated the chops for about an hour, then popped everything into the oven for about 20 minutes. The marinade didn't reduce much in the oven, so I poured it into a saucepan and boiled for about 5 minutes. It definitely reduced and thickened. As other readers suggested, I also added some red pepper flakes to the marinade. Will definitely make again!

This is fantastic!  I marinate 2 pork chops overnight, then grill them.  I boil the marinade for 3 minutes, so that I can use it to baste the chops while they are on the grill.  One suggestion: if you are going to make more than 3 or 4 chops, double the recipe.  I have used this as a marinade several times... it makes a wonderful pork chop!

I also added some red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it some heat. Then I added a few extra cloves of garlic. It went over very well, but I think it would have been better if allowed to marinate overnight.

My husband, who is NOT a fan of pork chops, said after eating this meal, "You can make that one again! That was really good!" Whoo hoo!

My husband said these were the best pork chops he ever ate. I love the marinade....will try it also on chicken and maybe even on pasta salad! **I cooked boneless pork chops for 35 min on 425 degrees **I used 1/2 tsp of jarred minced garlic instead of a fresh clove

This was very tasty - better than I expected, but not totally awesome. I made it exactly as written, except for extending the baking time past 30 minutes. The sauce was a little thin, but nothing bad. It had a good teriyaki-sauce kind of flavor, though I don't know if such small amounts of ground ginger and black pepper made a noticeable difference. Overall, this recipe is worth making again sometime - I'll just bake it even longer.

Good marinade, I left it overnight in the fridge and the meat was very tender. On the BBQ, the marinade does burn easily and is hard to cleanup.

Easy and tasty.  I cooked the chops in the same dish that I marinaded them in.

I thought the flavor was good and the chops were tender, however the sauce did not "reduce" for me at all, even after doubling the baking time. I wouldn't recommend this dish.

This recipe was excellent exactly as written. The pork chops were tender, moist, and very flavorful. I served it with homemade vegetable fried rice - even my husband (who ususally does not like pork chops) loved it! Great recipe!

This is very good.  I baked for 30 min bc my pork chops were in the fridge all night and I wanted to make sure they were done.  25 probably would've been fine.  I really liked it, although I may add more vinegar next time, as the honey was the predominant flavor.  I marinated overnight in my baking pan, then flipped them and marinated another 3 or 4 hours.  I didn't like how the pork chops didn't brown (although I knew they wouldn't in the oven), so I browned them for about a min/2 per side in a skillet and set aside,  then dumped the cooked marinade in, added about 2 tspns of flour to make a gravy.  The marinade did not reduce, and I wasn't about to overcook my chops in order to get it to do so.  It worked well enough and made a small amount of gravy--probably enough for the pork chops I had.  I didn't change the recipe amounts other than used 4 pork chops.  Thanks!

We loved this recipe! My 11 year old daughter hates bbq sauce on country style ribs. We tried this recipe because we didn't have bbq sauce or ketchup. She loved this and so did the rest of us. Added a pinch more ginger, pepper, and soy sauce, did not marinate, broiled on low.

I made this last night and it was tasty, but not over the top.  I grilled it outside, but boiled and reduced the marinade to serve as a sauce.  Over all it was good.  Not great, but good.  I will make it again when I am tired of my regular pork chop recipes.

Although we did enjoy this it did taste a tad bit much to vinegary.  This make plenty of sauce to serve over rice or noodles, I did rice.  The sauce is very thin but I did not bother to boil it down in a pan and served as is and no one complained.  I didn't bother with blending all the sauce ingredients either.  I just chopped the garlic really small and grated fresh ginger.  Served with a side of crispy asparagus.  Pretty good!

I made full recipe for 3 boneless chops. Added sm. chunk fresh ginger grated in. Added extra garlic.  I was short honey by about 1TBSP.I marinated the chops directly in the baking dish, not in a plastic bag. Did bake at least 35 min. until meat was done and then longer to reduce sauce further.  Very tasty--the fresh ginger really added a nice zing and it was plenty sweet.  Good with squash.

My husband and I thought these were fantastic.  Instead of digging out a food processor or blender, I just made the marinade with garlic powder instead of raw garlic.  I also didn't really measure how much of each of the marinade ingredients I used.  When I baked them, the sauce didn't reduce much, but this didn't bother us since the pork tasted so good.

We don't usually care for pork chops but this recipe made quite the difference to us. I added red pepper flakes and a dash of ginger, then marinated the chops overnight. Next time I will add some brown sugar to the marinade.

1st try at this recipe: I strictly followed instructions--and didn't find anything "tangy" or "honey" about this dish. When I think "tangy", the word "sweet" comes to mind--and I don't find much "sweet" in apple cider vinegar.   Perhaps a good sub for apple cider vinegar might be needed; I suspect there's volume misbalances between it and the soy sauce--maybe even the ginger too, for that matter.  I'm not ruling this one out; ingredient experimentation with this recipe will be done and I'll hopefully promote more stars with this dish soon.

It is a weak teriyaki marinade.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Wasn't bad but I've had better out of a bottle from the condiment aisle at the grocery store.

Very nice marinade. I made the mistake of broiling the chops instead of baking them. Wow. They burned in very little time. Perhaps because of the honey? I will make these chops again and bake them next time.

I made this for my husband (he adores pork) and  both he and I LOVED it!! Soooo, sooo yummy! I added red pepper chili flakes (as some suggest) it addsa great kick! I made them on the stove because I wanted the sauce to reduce and thicken, also it is more energy efficient to use the stove. Great recipe, I will also try this with: chicken, beef and salmon!

The vinegar overpowered the natural flavor of the meat.  I was hoping this combo of items would result in tender pork chops.  It did not meet expectations.  I won't be making this again.

I love this recipe.  I want to warn everyone though that the marinade smells soooo bad.  So you will be amazed at how wonderful the meat tastes when you're done cooking it.  So don't be scared!  It is the best marinade that I've come across so far and I use it for more than just pork steaks.  Its really good with chicken as well.  I'm going to try it with beef stew chunks the next time I make a stew.

Like other reviewers said, the sauce did not reduce for me.  I added 10 more minutes to the baking time, but was afraid the chops would become too tough.  It was still very liquid-y.  I would be ok with that though.  The main reason I didn't like this is because all I tasted was the apple cider vinegar.  Now I really like tangy dishes, but the vinegar was very overpowering, even with 1 cup of honey.
