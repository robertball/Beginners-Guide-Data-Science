This was excellent! i didn't have ancho chile so I put in some captain morgan hot sauce. I followed everything else exactly skipping the sauce on the top! We'll definitely make this again... Not for a while though, its a tad fattening!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was very good. I did have to change a few things. I didn't have any ancho chili powder so I used a little bit of adobo sauce in the meatloaf and the topping. The amounts are right on and I didn't have to add any extra liquids or dry ingredients. My family wasn't thrilled with the glaze but we just scraped that part off. This makes awesome meatloaf sandwiches :) And it tastes so very much better the next day. Not that it isn't good at first, just better after it sits overnight. Thanks for the recipe :)

I used half pork and half beef, and subbed some cayenne for the ancho chili.  It was spicy, swimming in grease, and so delicious!

The only problem I had with this is the high temperature -- 425 degrees?  The sauce burned and was not edible.  The meatloaf was salvageable after we scraped it off (it had to be chipped off in some areas) and it was delicious.  I will make this again, only I will bake it at 375 degrees.
