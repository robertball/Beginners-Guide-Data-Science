This is one of my favorite recipes to use! I absolutely love pot stickers, but have only eaten them at restaurants and at home, by way of using pre-made frozen ones from the store... I was so excited to try this recipe when I found it, and I haven't stopped using it regularly since. I do, however, use different fillings, depending on what I have in the fridge, but the pot sticker dough this recipe yields is just fantastic... everything tastes good in it! As for some reviewers saying that these were too "doughy", well I thought I would point out that pot stickers are meant to have a soft, chewy-doughy texture, not meant to be crispy like eggrolls or wantons, etc. I've never felt this recipe to yield pot stickers that are too doughy because I always roll the dough out thinly... they look and taste absolutely delicious, and I've found that they are just as good as ones from restaurants.

These were great! I did do some tweaks though. 1st I rolled out the dough so it was thinner,this way it wasn't too doughy. With the filling I didn't cook the chicken first, all i did was mix all the filling ingredients together than filled. Browned the bottom and then steamed with a little chicken stock instead of water. Kids and DH LOVED them!

The dough..was...not good. Buy wonton wrappers and definitely add minced garlic and fresh minced ginger. More or less depending on how much you like it. Take out the five spice, and maybe use ground pork instead of chicken.

These dumplling were just good enough to eat they are way to doughy the filling is excellent tho, I eat just the filling cause its sooo good i reccomend wonton or spring roll wraps instead of making your own dough. The recepie for the dough is very wrong i think.

These are time consuming but definitely worth it! I also steam them in chicken broth and I think it gives it a richer flavor. I don't always have all the ingredients on hand for the filling, but it's simple enough to improvise. I've never had any problems with the dough, I think using boiling water is the key along with kneading it well.

I did not care for the five spice powder. To me, tasting spices I associate with pumpkin pie did not fit with the chicken and soy sauce. Next time, I will use soy sauce, garlic salt, and sesame oil. I did like the simpleness of making the dumplings though.

I cooked this as a sidedish, along with some fried rice, and they tasted *wonderful*! My brother especially liked the doughy part.

These were fine but not impressive.  The dough just didn't have much taste, and that's really what my husband and I like most about restaurant dumplings.  The filling was fine, but it didn't make up for the dough being less tasty than I'd hoped for.

Perhaps I've never had "authentic" pot stickers. I have eaten them from many, many restaurants. These seemed to be more doughy than anything I've had. However, the filling tastes wonderful. I used less of the dough, just enough to fold and close the pot stickers. Since I doubled the recipe, I used 2 seperate pans to cook them. I browned them in one pan using oil. Then I steamed them in a covered pan using water. This made the cooking process flow much easier.

Not my favorite.  They had great flavor, but I would prefer using raw ingredients and steaming them together in the wrapper.  The pre-cooked chicken mixture had a funny texture, unlike what I'm used to with potstickers.

The recipe is tasty but I'm going to try half the five spice.  I really enjoy five spice, I just feel like its too much for this particular recipe.

These dumplings came out great!!! These are as good, if not better than our local Korean BBQ house!
The only thing i did differently is cooking the filling with the dumplings instead of before and it comes out great and like others suggested, instead of water i steamed them with chicken stock instead.  Mine came out perfect and rolled the dough thin so not too doughy. yum yum! enjoy

Kids loved it. Will definitely cut down on the sugar. Were a little difficult to cook the dumplings without them breaking up. Any ideas will be welcome. Filling was great!!

great recipe! for those saying it is too doughy, roll them out thinner, or try putting more filling so there's not too much dough around the edges.

good fun to make my son wanted dumplings like kung fu panda!!! I used extra veggies and turkey instead of pork. I find they needed alittle more in the flavour department but that could just be the turkey :)

These are outstanding!  Here's a tip: If you live in Chicago, go The Spice House in Evanston, IL and buy their Argyle Street Asian Blend seasoning and add approx. one teaspoon as well as one teaspoon of ground (dry) ginger

Great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly except used sweet italian sausage. Used them for chinese dumpling soup. This was delicious... Will definately be making alot.
One note: Don't leave dumplings in broth over nite-they get a little soggy!

Good but I'd almost rather just pay 4 or 5 dollars for dumplings at a chinese restaurant take out and only wait 15 minutes rather than 1 hour and 15 minutes

My sister made these for us and they were very good.  She left out the 5 spice powder and used ground turkey (a little more flavorful).  Yes they are a little doughy, but they are called "dumplings" so I think they are supposed to be that way and I thought they were delicious.  Just don't expect them to be crispy.

I really enjoyed using the recipe for the dough. It was difficult to find a posting of this recipe - everyone seems to use premade ones.  I did find however that you need more water than indicated - i also found it easier to spread the entier amount and make circular cut outs using a cup. Thanks a lot for the resipe and for how to pan fry - i have used the recipe atleast 7 times in the past two weeks.

I disagree with other users who found the potstickers to be doughy.  The key to avoiding this problem is to go thin on the dough (if you notice, in restaurants the dough is only about as thick as two pieces of cardstock).  I also steamed them instead of frying them at all.  The filling is fabulous and my husband loved them!

This recipe was great!! After reading reviews, i only used half the tho and made 8 pot stickers with this filling recipe.  I will double the filling next time and use the same recipe for the dough.  The taste was fantastic, texture perfect and i will be making this often. I didnt have the chinese spice and it was still delicious.  I strongly recommend the low sodium soya sauce indicated in the recipe. I almost used regular... the taste was perfect and regular soya sauce would be too salty.

These were very bland, but I'm prolly to blame. I subbed pork for chicken, didn't have any green onion, and did not use enough spice. I didn't have the Chinese 5-spice thingy so I just used a little bit of ground ginger, but it needed SOOOO much more. I thought these were going to be too salty, because I was using full-sodium soy sauce, so I omitted the salt in the dough. ugh big mistake. When it cooks it turns out so bland and watery, next time I'm going to take anothers suggestion and cook it in chicken stock. The dough was a nightmare. I had to flour everything in sight down, and it took forever, but I have to admit it was kind of fun. I had some left over filling  so I just ate that plain and it tasted fine, which is why I didn't think it needed more spice, but once it gets into the bland tasting dough, it tastes sooooo nothingish. I'm really calorie-conscious, so I didn't want to use the full oil when cooking the bottoms, so the first time I used a small amount of oil, and the second time I just used a SMALL drizzle of sesame oil, a spray of PAM, and then just spread it with a spoon. I recommend diluting your choice of oil in water, instead of using the full amount. This recipe is a really good base, and I will only make the dough again if I don't have wonton wrappers around, and I'm going to keep tweaking this and running with it. I do recommend this recipe, just don't make the mistakes I did.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

These were very tasty but a pain to make. I would love to eat them again providing someone else does the work!

We just used the dough part of this recipe and created our own filling (pre-shredded coleslaw mix, veggie ground 'beef' and some spices) but the dough worked out perfectly. It was easy to make and made 12 large dumplings. My husband thought the dough was better than ones he has tried in a restaurant!

I made it glutin free by using a glutin free pasta dough recipe. They taste like you ordered them.
Amazing

Very good recipe base. Did not add the cabbage becuse I have a carnivore for a husband--but it was still delicious!

This is REALLY good. Even the pickiest eater on the face of the Earth ate them! Next time I will roll out the dough a lot thinner, though. Don't follow the recipe on the "roll out to 6 in." part. It's too thick. Also, i didn't use Chinese five-spice powder, I just used cinnamon and cloves and a little bit of chilli powder. Instead of soy sauce, I added teriyaki marinade/sauce. YUM!

Great dough! Definately need more boiling water though.  The filling was a little sweetish for me, but my kids loved it!  I guess I prefer a more gingery filling :)

Very good, I don't think it was too much work if you like to eat good home made food. I used these in my won ton soup, which goes well with an Auslese Riesling by the way.

Not the best pot stickers I've ever made, but by far not the worst.  They had a good flavor, but not a recipe I would choose over a myriad of other dumpling recipes I have.

Simply fantastic! I have tried too many times to count to make dumplings. My whole family, including 2 year old twins ate them. Thank you!
