I have to give this 5 stars! I did make a few slight changes. I had an overabundance of lemons and no rum in the house, so I substituted fresh squeezed lemon juice for the rum and threw in about a tablespoon of lemon zest with the dry ingredients. The cake was very moist, and the lemon flavor was wonderful.

delicious!  i made extra glaze and made the glaze extra lemony and poked tons of holes in the cake with the bamboo skewers and poured geneoursly.  I added axtra sugar to the rest of the glaze to maek the glaze thicker and more "glaze-y" so that it would crust nicely and poured/spread that one on for icing.  YUM!

I must have done something wrong, since others had good results.  Cake was about an inch high and very heavy.

My wife and I loved it, even though I had to substitute organic corn meal for the corn starch because we didn't have corn starch on hand, thereby making it less original.  To those whose cakes didn't rise: perhaps your butter and eggs weren't at room temperature.  Also, after having beaten in half the eggs, adding a spoonful of the flour before beating in the rest of the eggs can help stabilize the batter.  This technique seems to work well in cakes that don't have chemical leavening agents.

This has got to be one of the cake recipes I've ever made (and I've made a lot of cakes)!  The only change I made to the recipe was using a dash of lemon extract instead of rum.  A delicious cake and I will be making it again very soon by popular demand.  Thank you for this yummy recipe!  :-)

I put in a teaspoon of vanilla extract, two teaspoons of rum extract and a dash of the lemon juice for flavoring. I made extra lemon glaze to make it extra lemony and dusted it with powdered sugar.

I'm not sure yet - I just made it.  But, I'm suspicious because there was no leavening agent.  What's going make this not a rock?

I was curious to see the texture of this cake with so much cornstarch called for but I was pleased with the end result. I goofed and added the 1/3 cup lemon juice to the batter and it still turned out OK. I did use the zest from one whole lemon in the batter also along with a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of salt to enhance the flavors. I glazed as per instruction and the cake turned out light textured with a great lemony tart flavor and quite moist.

I made this cake for dinner guests... and was sadly disappointed!!  It looked absolutely beautiful, it rose very high and had a beautiful golden crust, but it was incredibly dry.  Perhaps decreasing the baking time would help.  I probably won't try this again though, we just didn't care for it.

This was awesome! Hard to believe it uses no extract no flavor no baking soda no baking powder and no salt. I didn't like the glaze, too tart. Next time I'll try some lemon zest and extract

This is a really nice lemon poke.  I did however, add lemon juice and lemon zest to the cake batter instead of rum.  It gave it more lemon flavor.  The glaze is wonderful...I think I am going to try this with orange next.

This is a wonderful loaf cake.  Very dense, not too sweet and the lemon flavor is wonderful.  It was reminiscent of what I ate as a child in Germany.

This recipe came out fabulous.  I did use the rum.  It rose perfectly and was not heavy at all.  I also doubled the glaze to pour on top / into the holes.  I additionally toasted coconut to sprinkle on top as well.

Fantastic recipe. Quick, easy, delicious.  Also great with squeezed orange juice instead of lemon.   I make it regularly at the seniors home where I work, I double the recipe and bake it in a hotel pan.  I think it works better when it's thinner than loaf sized, with a bit more glaze, no dryness issues.

I had a little fresh lemon juice to use up and wanted to make a pound cake for DH to take to work.  This recipe was suggested to me.  It was very weird to use an entire cup of cornstarch in a cake recipe.  I found the cake overall to be dry and plain.  My DH ended up pouring more rum over the top.  I doubt that I'd make it again.

I made this for my german friend as a gift.  She loved it, said it was perfect and it brought back memories.  I thought is was a bit dry but liked the zesty lemon.   I only baked for one hour.  Instructions for after cake comes out of the oven is contradictory.  Wasn't sure if I should glaze IMMEDIATELY when removed from oven or wait until I remove from the pan.  Also was curious about how the one cup of cornstarch thinking it was an error but it is correct.  I would definitely make this again.. extremely easy!

It looks great.  It is in the oven.  I’m surprised there is no leavenong agent listed.  I have a fried from Germany who makes this for gifts.  Her recipe calls fpr 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  Too late now.  I checked with her after I got it in the oven??

This turned out VERY dry, despite cooking for only 45 minutes @350, and pouring all of the glaze on as directed.  I used Limoncello in place of the rum, which gave it a tangy lemon flavor, which was what I expected.  Will not make it again

I’m not a fan of this recipe. I like a strong flavour of lemon and you can hardly taste it. The cake taste bland and I think the cornstarch makes a different taste and texture  than normal cake.

I added quite a bit more lemon juice than the recipe called for (oops) and a bit of lemon zest.  So the lemon flavor really came through and I couldn't be more overjoyed with that, the problem was that it turned out fairly dry despite my taking precautions against this happening.  Does anyone have any tips/suggestions to stop that from happening next time I make this?  (Yes, gonna do it again.  Like I said, loved the lemon flavor!)

I LOVE the glaze.  The cake part was very blah in my opinion, and I didn't realize it was going to be so dense.  I've never had a pound cake before.

I used one pkg lemon pie filling mix and enough cornstarch to make the 1 cup the recipe asked for.  I also used about 2 1/2 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla instead of rum.

I had some lemon puddings mixes to use (the cook and serve kind).  Since cornstarch is the main ingredient in the lemon pudding mix, I gambled.  I used 2 4-serving size puddings in place of the cornstarch, lemon juice, and confectioner's sugar.  It turned out really good.

This cake is VERY Lemony... like tart lemony. Actually I don't think it's the cake but the glaze that seeps through. Very good but you must expect it to be very bright tasting... not like other lemon loafs. I just made it and am eating it right now... its starting to grow on me! I also substituted lemon juice from the rum.. but the overwhelming lemon is coming from the glaze for sure.

Left out the rum and it turned out quite dry. Flavor was good, but I'm going to use some of the tweaks suggested by other reviewers and see if I can get it to be more moist next time. If that doesn't work, I'll move on to other recipes for lemon cake.

This cake was wonderful.  My German husband always love to eat German Christmas cakes, stollen etc over the Christmas holiays.   I did wonder about not adding baking powder .  After reading all of the reviews I went ahead and baked it.  Excellent.   I now have to make two more for my student sons to take back with them....

I didn't make the glaze thin enough but enough did make it through the cake.  It's heavy, fine grained, and awesome.  It makes a large loaf.  When serving, make it very thin slices - it's very rich!

This came out really well. Somehow I made a mistake on the second batch and it came out flat. First one was fantastic though!!

This is definately an heirloom recipe. The cake was very dry even with the glaze, and the rum added an old- fashioned flavor.  It was interesting to try.
