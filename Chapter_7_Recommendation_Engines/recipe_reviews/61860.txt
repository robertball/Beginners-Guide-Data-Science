I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I changed a lot of things in it but the end result was definitely 5 stars!
Here's what I did. I put in 2 cups of rhubarb with 3 cups of crushed pineapple. I did NOT put in marshmallows. I used the reserved pineapple juice in the cake mix instead of water.  I have 4 kids (8 years old and younger) who loved this recipe. They loved the red glaze on top. And had me make it for their slumber party.  2 of the kids at the party told me they hated rhubarb but loved my cake.  I'm definitely going to do this more often.

I have this recipe and just tried it out a week ago....tastes great. What I did different on mine was first arrange chopped rhubarb in pan, then mix jello (I used sugar free raspberry)with the sugar, sprinkle that over the rhubarb, then sprinkle the marshmallows over that evenly, then spread the cake batter. After baking, COOL for 10 minutes, then run your knife around the edges and invert onto a foil covered cookie sheet (or whatever you plan to use). Then I covered mine with Saran Wrap and placed it in the fridge to cool completely. Serve cold and store it in the refrigerator! Great recipe!

This cake is an awesome use of rhubarb! Both my husband and I loved it! I used sugar-free gelatin (instead of regular) and a white cake mix (instead of the yellow), but it still turned out great! I was amazed that you couldn't even tell there were marshmallows in the recipe. For some it may be a bit tart, but I thought it was a perfect mix of sugar and rhubarb.

Excellent way to use rhubarb beside just pie.  A little sweet for my taste, next time I'll use just 1/2 cup sugar.  The upside down part is nice and gooey.

This cake was great!  You can't let it cool before serving, though unless you hide it!

My ex-mother-in-law used to make this cake and I'd been searching for 10 years for a similar recipe.  This was it!!  I'm thrilled to be able to enjoy this wonderful (and easy!) cake again!!!

Like the previous reviewer, I found this cake to be a little too gooey and I would never make it again.  I am not sure if it is the sugar combined with the rhubarb, or the gelatin creating the problem.  I also thought it was too sweet, definately determine the tartness of the rhubarb and adjust the sugar accordingly.

This recipe is fantastic, in texture, & taste. The only problem I had was it was too big for an 13x9 pan & I couldn't turn it out as it was too juicy. YUMMY fo the TUMMY

Followed recipe exactly, and although this was delicious, I will put about a quarter of the the sugar next time as this was far too sweet for me and the rhubarb flavour was kind of lost in the sweetness (kids loved it though).  I think just a small amount of sugar with the gelatin and marshmallows would make it sweet enough.  Really nice cake though and will definitely make it again soon!, thanks

I just made this recipe this weekend and it was a total hit with my guests.  Everyone even needed to take home the recipe.  I used frozen rhubarb I had from last spring.  It was awesome!

I couldn't find rhubarb in the local grocery stores, so I did a pineapple/blue berry upside down cake. Then topped it with a whipped topping. Everyone loved it!

Made this cake for a family dinner and received rave reviews.  I am planning to make it again this weekend for a barbeque.  Great way to use up the frozen rhubarb from a year ago.  Also plan to use it with my fresh rhubarb which is ready now.  Delicious cold with cool whip.

I made this recipe for a group of men at work who, though they will eat anything, don't have much to say about food.  The compliments rolled in all day! They LOVED it!  I didn't change anything and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

We have used this recipe for years and it is one of our favorite ways to use rhubarb but we usually use raspberry jello. We have also used other fruits and flavors of jello, i.e. pie cherry and cherry jello, blueberry or huckleberry and lemon jello, peach and peach jello, etc.

I will say that I did not care for this recipe at all, but I did have 2 guests rave about it. The cake does not look appealing because the jello turns into a goo on the top of the cake. I would try another recipe.
