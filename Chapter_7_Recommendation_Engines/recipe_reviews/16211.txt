This recipe has good potential but I think that it should have specified to use EXTREMELY LEAN ground beef. This came out VERY VERY VERY greasy and was not the prettiest dish I've ever made. It was more of a "oatmeal" looking dish with meatballs and a lot of grease on it. My DH described it as greasy groul...which sounds just bad LOL!!! My best friend who was here to eat with us tonight thought the flavor was good but the grease had to go...with a few changes this could be a good dish! Also, I'd use about 1/2 the box of the pasta the next time..it made our soup TOO thick! Thanks anyway Kelly, I'm going to try to make a few changes the next time!

The flavor is very good.  Mine did not exactly turn out to be a "soup."  It was more of a pasta side dish, but it was delicious, and very easy to make.  To give it more of a soup consistency I would probably use half the pasta, and maybe add a can or two more chicken broth.  Unless you like TONS of meatballs, then I would halve the meat.  I used very lean ground chuck (93/7) so there was not a lot of grease.  I added spinach to mine.  I will definitely make this again.

We (hubby & I) made this last night and we loved this - we didn't know what to expect but it was spectacular! I took a lot of suggestions from other people though, we used 1lb ground beef, used more broth (and could have used more) and added garlic & onion. I also used only 1c parm in the broth. I put in a can of diced tomato and a small can of green chiles because it seemed to plain otherwise but we were amazed by how delicious it was and we'll definitely be making this again. We also fried the meatballs first - I was afraid they'd set all stuck together and also it cooked out some of the fat that way too.

Pretty good!  I used ground turkey instead of beef (as the last time I had this, my friend made it with beef and it was VERY greasy!!), and it was so good.  I think I should have used another can of broth, as there was absolutely no liquid to the soup what-so-ever.  My husband thought there were too many meatballs, so next time we are only going to use one and a half pounds of meat instead of the called for two pounds.  All in all, very good!  Thanks Kelly!

My husband and daughter really liked this soup.  I will be making it again.  I served it with a crusty bread.  Next time I am going to add a little spinach.

Tastes just like Italian Wedding Soup,
but the added fresh parmesan cheese was a real 
hit with my family for added flavour!
There was no leftovers.

I am going to use a very lean beef for the meatballs and add a vegetable as well.  I would suggest that you cook the pasta seperately, drain it and then add soup into the cooked pasta.

Great taste, and using 90 percent lean ground beef not greasy as all. But as others have observed, it was way too thick. Next time would add additional broth or reduce amount of pasta,perhaps both,and maybe cook at simmer instead of on medium after adding pasta.

But as other

It was not as good as I expected. It was rather bland even with me adding some extra Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, etc; this could partially be due to me having to add more liquid to keep it from becoming a pasta salad. I definitely recommend adding salt and pepper to the meatballs and maybe searing them in a pan to add some more flavor.

I made the soup for my girlfriend and she loves it. She asks me to make it all the time now. It makes a great leftover also, seems to me it tastes better after being reheated.

Very thick. The pasta tasted fine but I didn't like the meat balls.  Also, it was extremely difficult to clean the pan!

I had to really modify the recipe to make it work but it was pretty good. The meatballs seemed a little hard, though.

I'd like to know how to keep the Parmesan from clumping .... It was globbing on my spoon as I stirred it.  Like many others who commented, it turned out like a pasta dish, unless you add more broth to it.

I made less and used elbow macaroni noodles as that is what I had on hand. I love the flavor of the broth!
