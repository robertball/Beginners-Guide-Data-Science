Tasty! I used home-grown Japanese eggplants, split them in half, drizzled some olive oil over them and baked them in the oven for 20 minutes at 350°.  That gave them a nice roasted flavour. I used a fancy Mexican cheese blend instead of just cheddar and added Italian seasonings and cumin to the cheese mix.  I then baked the patties for 20 minutes total, flipping them after 10 minutes.  Thanks!

I also added an additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and I used about 3/4 cup of cheese rather than the full cup. Then I BAKED them for about 20-25 min. at 350 and flipped them once halfway through. Since they started to look more and more like hamburgers, I decided to go with it...I put one of these on a bun with ketchup, lettuce, mayo, tomato, etc. and it was awesome! It tasted just like a regular burger. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I both loved them! I halved the recipe since I only had one eggplant.  I did not want to fry them, so I "pan fried" them in the oven--I put the oil on a pan and into the oven. When hot and sizzling I added the croquettes, turning half way through cooking. It was a great alternative cooking method. I think next time I'll use a little less oil. I'll be making them again soon!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I wanted more veggies, so I've made some alterations. Which pretty much makes it a completely different recipe.  First off, I used 1 large eggplant, diced it, then microwaved. I sauteed 1/2 red onion and 1/2 cup of diced carrots in about 1 tablespoon of olive oil until browned on slightly above Med heat.  I let both the eggplant and the onion/carrot mixture cool before mixing with the other ingredients.  I also added 1/2 cup of diced black olives and 1/3 cup of canned corn (drained) and 1/3 cup of diced canned mushrooms (fresh are good too). I added about 1/4 cup extra bread crumbs and 1/3 cup extra cheese.  I sprinkled in the bread crumbs in order to prevent lumps.  I omitted the parsley and added 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne, and 1/8 teaspoon ginger.  For the frying, I added 1/4 cup of peanut oil to 3/4 cup vegetable oil.  The whole patty making process is an art. First, you gotta use your hands. And second, it's all about making them as thin as possible (to cook evenly), while making sure they're thick enough to not break.  If you are freezing these, I recommend frying before freezing.  After frying & patting dry, put them on a plate & stick in the freezer for at least 1 hour, then place in freezer bags.  To reheat, bake them on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 10-20 minutes (depending on the thickness).

These we absolutely delicious!  My mother made them and loved them too.  We steamed eggplant instead of microwaving. Only needed one egg.  It is a very wet, sticky batter.  Suggest you scoop out with spatula, form patties on cookie sheet and refrigerate before frying.  They were worth the effort.

These are quick, easy and a great way to get kids to eat eggplant! I only use one egg, chopped onion and I bake them at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes (you'll need to flip them halfway through).

Weird and delicious! These would make good appetizers for a party. We ate ours as burgers like another reviewer suggested here, and they were great that way. I had some jarred red peppers on hand from another recipe, and I chopped a bit up and threw them in the mix, and they complimented this recipe really well. Also added alot more spices, a few shakes of garlic salt, basil, and italian seasonings, and seasoned the patties with garlic pepper while I was frying. Versatile recipe, we'll make this again! Thanks!

I was very pleasantly surprised by these! I'm not a big fan of eggplant but I'm always up for trying new things and I'm glad I did! Next time I might saute the onions before mixing them with the other ingredients. . .they didn't quite cook all the way. But other than that, these were delicious!

I did not have time to fry the croquettes so I just put it all in a cassarole dish, added more cheese on top and baked 15 minutes.  It turned out great!

I love these and would have rated them a 5 but steaming the egg plant gives an unpleasant texture, ROASTING IS IMPERATIVE!!! I serve them as a veggie burger. Just shape them into a burger sized patties and bake 10 mins then flip and bake another 5-10 mins. Add lettuce tomato pickle just like you would a burger. Yummy.

I'm cooking like crazy this week, trying to prepare ahead of time for our daughter's birthday party this weekend. I love eggplant, so I thought I'd make these as an appetizer. I HAD to sneak one for lunch! I put a little tomato sauce and ricotta on top and it was great. Thanks Kelli!

Excellant recipe - thanks Kelli! I followed the advice of others and baked eggplant instead of microw-waving (split in 1/2, drizzled with olive oil, baked @ 350 30 minutes). Because so many complained that it was difficult to mash, I put it all in my  food processor - it was a snap! I will also try to make tiny ones, add a dollop of spaghetti sauce to the top, and serve as an appetizer.

Great recipe!  I'd like to add a tip:  When using eggplant as a ground meat substitute I always wring the eggplant through cheesecloth to remove as much moisture as possible.  Just sayin'  ;)

This recipe is a family favorite!!!!!   I made eggplant shooters.  I followed the recipe, with a few modifications.  I omitted the egg, regular onion, dried parsley, and breadcrumbs.    I finely chopped three green onions and fresh parsley, minced three large garlic gloves, and added instant oatmeal.  After mixing all of the ingredients, I tasted the mixture, and added sea salt accordingly.   Next, I coated the patties in oatmeal before frying.  I sprayed a non-stick skillet with Pam, and added three tablespoons of olive oil.  As I continued to fry, I added oil as needed.   The egg was not necessary.  The patties did not fall apart, nor did they stick.  I fried the eggplant on both sides, until golden brown, and firm.    I topped the little eggplant patties with a thin slice of tomato, lettuce, roasted red pepper, grilled onions, and spicy mustard.   This shooter is good with/without bread.  If texture is important to you, do not make the patties too thick.  I prepared firm eggplant patties.        The scary part is, I do not like eggplant, but I love my version of this recipe.   Enjoy!!!

It was really good. I roasted the eggplant in the oven for about 1/2 hour instead of microwaving it.

This recipe is awesome.  My husband and I are not eggplant eaters, but I keep trying to find the perfect recipes to use it.  this one is definitely a keeper.  I, too, roasted the eggplant with olive oil as suggested by other reviewers.  The microwave just didn't do it, and the taste was much better with roasting.  Also added peas and finely chopped carrots.   I also sprinkled salt on slices of eggplant before cubing and roasting, and let it sit to weep for 20 minutes to cut any bitterness eggplant has.

Wow! I was in a rut, and really wanted to use up my eggplants in a new way. My kids dislike eggplants, and I just wanted to search for something hoping they'll eat. I found this recipe, and loooved the idea, so I eyeballed all the ingredients, and used what I had on hand. Shallow fried them, and voila! Delicious, quick, easy, and most importantly, my kids loved them!! So did I. I made a quick tahini sauce on the side to dip them in. Perfect dip for these. Thanks for the great idea!!

Very tasty! Great appetizer.  Made a few modifications based on other reviews: #1 baked eggplant instead of microwaved (split in 1/2 , drizzle w/ olive oil, bake at 350 for 25min.) #2 added cumin to cheese/crumb mix #3 used mexican cheese instead of cheddar (it was all I had & someone else suggested it) #3 chopped 1 cup of carrots & 1/2 cup green olives in food processor and added to cheese/crumb mix #4 chopped eggplant into blocks & mixed in food processor (it was difficult to mash) #5 baked a batch but it tasted chewy & the color was dull.  They looked & tasted much better fried.  I did freeze a portion because I had like 40.  I had some the next day & they tasted great cold!  Next time I might add fresh peppers and have a greek yogurt dip to it.  What is the sauce drizzled on top?? Excellent recipe!!

I made some modifications, but this was very tasty. Everyone loved it. I baked 1 eggplant and 2 zucchini's for 25 mins on 350, then broiled for 2 more mins with olive oil & salt/pepper. I added Sweet Red Pepper and celery cut very fine. I also chopped up a tomato and added it to the patties.   I baked them in the oven for 30-40 mins and they were awesome! Good recipe for eggplant/zucchini.  If only I made a tomato sauce for a topping, they could have been much better.

They were ok.  I'm sure they would have been outstanding if you deep fried them, but they were pretty limp and took on the taste of the bread crumbs.

This is fantastic, although I halve the bread crumbs and add Jiffy cornbread mix, just because I LOVE cornbread. Best ever!

I'll eat eggplant but don't normally get too excited about it. This, however, was great! My changes were minor. First I added a tablespoon or two of olive oil to the eggplant an roasted it along with the onions. I used panko bread crumbs, adding  herbs and spices to make them Italian. I added half of the crumbs to the eggplant mixture along with a quarter cup or so of fresh basil just because I had it. I then used the other half of the crumbs as a coating and baked it at 375. My husband, son, and grandson all  said this was very good. Well, maybe my grandson was just wanting dessert. Regardless...

Sooo good....I made them exactly as written, never had the chance to look at any reviews and they turned out really good!  My whole family loved them, even the picky kiddos.  I had two medium eggplants and they made about ten croquettes.  We will be making these again and often!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very good; much better than I thought they could be! I added almost 1/2 cup more breadcrumbs but used the full amount of cheese. I also baked these in a 350 degree oven instead of frying- they were crispy and delicious. Needed a little spice but that is just my taste. The kids ate them too and liked them, so its a keeper for sure. Made with chili mayo sauce. So good together.

Excellent recipe! I used mozzarella (liberally) instead of cheddar and since I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand, I crushed up cornflakes instead. I added just 1 egg and the mixture was so sticky I had to add in more crushed cornflakes. I oiled my hands with olive oil so it was easier to shape and drop the patties into the pan for frying. I did a quick saute of the onions before adding them into the mixture, and also put in a couple drops of tabasco sauce for kicks. It turned out to be a hit! Tastes great with yoghurt or mayo as a dip.

I make these all the time ... My kids gobble them up.  I add a cup of cooked quinoa and generally any combination of cheese I have (mozzarella feta asiago) bake them at 375 for about 25 minutes on parchment paper flipping half way thru, browns them nicely no need to fry. Always a big hit!

These are good!  I brush them with extra light olive oil and bake instead of frying.

This was such a great recipe!  I tweaked it to make it GF and LF.  I used Veggie Shreds chedder flavor cheese and Schar's GF bread crumbs and drizzled it with Barilla's tomato basil spaghetti sauce --> it was a hit with my friends and husband.

This recipe was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly & mixed all the ingredients. When I went to get the eggs, I had none. :( Instead I just mixed milk & mayonnaise together as my binder. It was equal parts milk to mayonnaise. Maybe a 1/4 cup of each. The mixture came out to the perfect consistency. I also didn't have cheddar cheese. I replace it with parmesan & I used fresh chopped parsley. The croquettes turned out really salty, but it was because of the parmesan combined with salt. Next time I will use 1/2 cheddar & 1/2 parmesan & omit the salt altogether.

This is a great way to get the family to eat eggplant.  I didn't fry these.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with E.V.O.O., put the patties on top then sprayed them again.  I baked at 375 for about 25 minutes, flipping half way through. I will add some marinara sauce on top next time.

Really good; I made as written and I think this is a kid friendly recipe- not spicy at all...tastes a little like eggplant parm.   I'll add red pepper flakes next time and make a spicy dipping sauce (no kids in this house!).

This is a wonderful way to prepare eggplant.  I was too lazy to make into patties, so instead I prepared it exactly following the recipe, then I put it into a casserole dish, topped it with some grated cheese and baked it at 350 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.  AMAZING!!

I made the mistake of trying to substitute one humungous eggplant for the two medium-- and boy, that was a seedy disaster.  Otherwise, though, a great recipe.  I boiled the eggplant instead of microwaving it, so no problems mashing.  I also pressed out the mashed pulp pretty hard with a bunch of paper towels, so the resulting croquette mix was nice and dry and held together well.  My only criticism would be that this is a little bland and definitely needs some sort of sauce.  We tried marinara, but I might try ranch next time.

These were awesome! I followed a lot of the reviewer suggestions and made a couple other modifications as follows: 1 med and 2 small eggplants halved, drizzled with olive oil, and roasted 30 min at 350ºF; removed from skin and microwaved 4 min (I got impatient with the roasting); pureed in blender and combined with other ingredients (subs: matza meal for bread crumbs b/c it's what I had, added Italian seasoning blend, extra sharp cheddar, and minced onion instead of fresh); pattied and baked in oven 15 min per side at 350ºF. I ate some warm after baking and some cold the next day for lunch. They were good on their own, but I ate them with some dill hummus (I don't remember where I got the recipe), which was even better. They didn't make me think of burgers (or croquettes, really) so much as falafel, and I think they'd be great with a Middle Eastern or Mediterranean themed meal. They also seem like a good basis for further experimentation, which I'm eager to try out. Overall, I really enjoyed these.

These were delicious! I've tried the microwave method as stated, and I've also oven roasted the eggplant first. I personally think the taste is better when first roasting. I used Italian Seasoned Panko bread crumbs and fresh basil instead of dried parsley. I served it with tahini and/or hummus...excellent recipe!

These are outstanding!  My new favorite veggie burger recipe.  Some changes I made:  I added more bread crumbs because the mix was a bit too loose/moist.  I dredged the burgers in flour before frying to give them a nice crust.  I also used WAY less oil....about 2 tbs in a large skillet.  I used a 50/50 mix of olive oil and chili oil (Asian oil) which gave them a little bit of a kick.  DELICIOUS!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was pretty good. But I am only giving it 3 stars because I feel like it could have used a little bit more seasoning, and could have stood to be a little bit crispier. But as a starter recipe, I definitely think it was good, and I will absolutely make again! My 4 year old loved this, as she doesn't like to eat meat.

I am sorry, but this has to be one of the worst I've tried from this site.  Not only is precooking, peeling, and mashing the eggplant a mess--it's a lot of work.  I even added some extra spices to the mix and it didn't help.  They smelled so good when they were cooking, but they fell waaaaaaay short.

this was really good...i fried mines in a shallow pan with about 3 T butter and 1 T olive oil and thought it was plenty...mine got a little brown so no more than medium-medium high heat i think...i topped these with a relish of finely diced roaster red pepper, onion, garlic, salt pepper cayenne and fresh parsley...i also used fresh parsley and added some cayenne to the croquettes and i roasted the eggplant...i bet these would be good for brunch with a poached egg on top and some fried potatoes...maybe some hollandaise...these are very good

This was so good!  I get random fruits and veggies through an organic produce co-op, so I wasn't sure what I was going to do with the eggplant included in this week's basket. I made these, and they were delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

As others suggested, I boiled the eggplant, rather than microwave and pushed out as much water as I could through a strainer after.  I also fried them in olive oil....much healthier!

These were quite tasty.  No need for a sauce -- they had good flavor and moistness on their own.  An nice veggie side dish alternative.  I fried them in a non-stick pan with just a couple tablespoons of olive oil and they came out crispy and nicely browned.

These burgers are awesome.  The taste is great and what I liked was that you can make them ahead and freeze them.  Then you can take them out put them in the microwave and serve with a salad.  The only thing I found was they were a little sticky so I added some oatmeal then they were fine.  Sorry I should have added that I fried them in a non stick pan with a little oil not actually dumping them into oil.

Great recipe!!  I recommend boiling the eggplant - it didn't get as done as the directions indicate in the microwave & it was tough to mash.  I also rolled the patties in breadcrumbs before frying and served with marinara sauce.

Very tasty - used fresh parsley, less salt, rolled in seasoned bread crumbs and baked. Resulted in very crisp and light patties.Excellent recipe to change to suit your families taste.

I had a similar recipe which required to cube the eggplant and cook it on the stove top slowly for about 1 hour. I can't believe that now the MWO can do the trick for a fraction of the time. These croquettes are absolutely delicious, easy to make, probably the dough is a little sticky, so getting your hands wet while you make the balls would be a good idea. My kids didnt like it, it has the spice of the eggplant. My fiancee and I loved it.

I couldn't even wait to finish frying these before sampling one...yum!  I used Sargento's reduced fat four cheese Italian instead of the cheddar but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I can't wait for my husband to try these...I will definitely make these again.

This was amazing! I did substitute Panko breadcrumbs for Italian seasoned and I made a remoulade sauce for a topping. Nice and spicy! I peeled and cubed the eggplant, drizzled some olive oil on top, and baked at 400º for 20mins. When they came out you could mash them with a fork. Also, I did freeze these before pan frying because (as a few of the other posters have noted) the mixture is VERY moist and loose. I froze mine overnight and had no problems going straight from freezer to hot pan (watch out for splattering with tiny ice crystals).

I really wanted this to be a great, easy alternative to eggplant parmesan... but I was very disappointed.  The black pepper was overwhelming.  I covered and baked with spaghetti sauce, and covered with mozzarella cheese... it looked good but just didn't taste as good as I expected.

Better to cook onion with eggplant in microwave. Salt content too high for my personal taste (and am serving to young children), as seasoned bread crumbs and cheese add tons of salt already. Would eliminate salt entirely next time and try baking for lower fat alternative. Overall a good dish.

5 stars. I really enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh parsley because I had some. I am always looking for different ways to cook eggplant.  I can't wait to make it for my husband. I had to 1/2 it but worked great.  This one is a keeper for me!

OMG....DH is thrilled with this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to add about a 1/2 t. red pepper flakes.  Otherwise just followed the recipe.  The proportions of everything was perfect.  Fried them in extra virgin olive oil and served spaghetti with them.  So used spaghetti sauce.  DH agrees they would be awesome on a sandwich and or with a cucumber sauce.  He usually does not like "meatless" meals but very satisfied with this one tonight.  Thanks for sharing.  I will be making these very often and will be sharing with a vegetarian friend tomorrow.

Wow...it was delish! Mashing was the only problem but I managed. Thank god I had a flat whisk that was durable enough to smash the eggplants. Next time, I will dice the eggplants in smaller pieces like other people had said. Also, I only had panko (my favorite breadcrumbs) so i added dashes of italian seasonings and used mild cheddar because that's all I had.

As a Vegetarian this recipe was quite a find. It was quick and easy (only took me about 20 min) and delicious. I did add more onions and fried them in Olive oil as opposed to the vegetable oil, but kept everything else the same. Even the rest of my family that eats meat like them. I was wondering if anyone used a white cheese instead of cheddar and how it turned out? Thanks for posting this!

This recipe was very good. I used colby jack because that's what I had but I'm sure cheddar would be good too. The only thing I will do different next time is to use my food processor to chop the onions small because I did it by hand and they were a little too big. But that was my fault not the recipes fault.

I thought this recipe was disgusting and I usually love eggplant, there was way to much breadcrumbs and the eggplant did not mash well i was left with eggplant pieces that just resembled sauteed onions. I suggest never using this recipe, next time I'll try making salmon croquettes.

This recipe is so amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly as is except I used some fresh Italian parsley that I diced up. I halved the recipe since I only had one eggplant and it turned out so delicious. I made my own bread crumbs by putting a couple of pieces of bread in the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes then crushed them in a plastic bag (I added Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs to make them "Italian"). The only challenge I had with these were keeping them to stay together during the initial frying process. You have to be very careful or they will split. Also, keep the oil temperature on medium low- that is what worked for me. Otherwise they just get too crispy too quickly! I also like frying in a small pot that has sides high enough so that oil doesn't crackle and spit and jump out of the pot.

I was never a fan of eggplant until I made this last night...wow!! I'm making them again for dinner tonight! I used one large eggplant and added about a half a cup of cracker crumbs in addition to the breadcrumbs (ran out of breadcrumbs) to get the right consistency. I also added more cheese, threw in some oregano instead of the parsley (didn't have it on hand), and doubled the garlic. The onions added a nice crunch and I'm glad I didn't sauté them beforehand! Planning on serving them tonight over a bed of fresh spinach with a scoop of herbed corn (another recipe from this website) on top! Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I added some chopped portabello mushrooms. I baked the eggplant and then mashed it. I also baked the croquettes as burgers in a greased jelly roll pan.

I also sauted the onions, mushrooms and garlic before adding to the mix.

They were tasty, held together and came out crispy at the edges and moist and tender in the middle.

Delicious. I baked the eggplant and followed the recipe exactly. I found putting it in the fridge before forming patties helps. Serve it with pesto or as a veggie burger with cheese.

The flavor and recipe was great, I would just ammend it to coarsely puree the eggplant before cooking it, otherwise it is almost impossible to mash.  Other than that, the recipe is delicious.  We served ours with a homemade marinara sauce.

We didn't care for these at all, and we love eggplant. I found they were a lot of work for not much pay off. I thought they were greasy...maybe if I had baked them, they wouldn't have soaked up all the olive oil in the pan. I won't make these again. I'll stick with a more traditional eggplant rollatini.

AMAZING! My husband said it was the best burger he's ever had! I only used a cup of regular bread crumbs (adding about 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning) and cooked the peeled, cubed eggplant in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees C (adding a bit of olive oil so it didn't stick). I also fried the patties in a non-stick pan with about 1/4 cup of olive oil. They turned out really well! And I made them into burgers with lettuce and tomato, topping them off with the roasted garlic and chili aioli I found at Costco.

We had this tonight with eggplant from our garden.  It was wonderful!!!  Followed the recipe to a Tee.  Next time I'll make a marinara sauce for dipping.  I like that I can make ahead and freeze as I have more eggplant ripening all the time now.  The taste was similar to fried green tomatoes.

This recipe turned out greatt- and I don't usually like eggplant! I don't have a microwave so I baked the eggplant before mashing it. I also used a type of crouton since I had them on hand instead of bread crumbs. While the eggplant baked I mixed the other ingredients together to help soften the croutons. My husband and I both really loved the flavor and ended up eating them as "veggie burgers". The bread, lettuce, tomato, etc on top gave it a fresh aspect which balanced out the frying for me! I was very happy with how they turned out.

Excellent! I roasted in oven w/ oregano and olive oil vs. the microwave, I used Mozzarella instead of chedder, but I also added fresh basil to the mix! My husband hates eggplant but loved these!

I was pleasently surprised! I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. They were so good the kids thought they were burgers.

These were amazing. You completely forget that you're eating vegetables (which, admit it, is a great thing with many vegetables). These were delicious and everyone at the table was trying to get as many as they could without seeming rude. Awesome!

Excellent!  Like your own personal veggie burger!  I put mozzerella cheese instead of cheddar.  I will make again and next time use a red pepper sauce to go with it.  Very very tasty!

This came together a lot easier than I expected, although mashing the eggplant was a bit of work. I halved the recipe for one eggplant. I didn't have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs so added 1t of Italian seasoning. Once I'd formed into patties, I refrigerated for about 3 hours to firm them up a bit. I cooked them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes each side. I'll be making these again. Thanks Kelli.

I had an old eggplant that I needed to do something with, and this was the only recipe I could find that I had all the ingredients for... I really didn't expect to like it, but it was really good!  I think next time I'll chop up a jalapeno really fine and throw it in to give it a little extra kick, but as written it's a really good recipe.  Thanks!

Did not stick together enough for a patty.  Ended up up putting in casserole dish and baking it.  Taste was okay, but my eggplant was rather seedy.

I will not be making this recipe again.  Very blah, needs some kind of sauce, should have thought of marinara I guess.  Wish I had read the reviews first.  And my family loves eggplant.

I usually love eggplant but didn't quite like this one.  I much prefer eggplant parm to this and I don't care much for eggplant parm either.  Maybe I didn't like shredded cheddar with it.  Mozzarella might be better or maybe no cheese at all would be good.  Wasn't crazy about microwaving the eggplant either and it just didn't quite mash right or cook right.  Might try again with variations....cause I really like the idea of making croquettes with the eggplant.

The best way to describe them is eggplant and bread crumb mush with a crispy crust.  I followed the recipe to the T.  I don't know how anyone liked their eggplant prepared in this fashion!  No thanks!

This was tasty.  The patty mixture was too thin, so we added more bread crumbs to make it stick together as patties.  I think next time I'll pulverize the eggplant in a blender cause it didn't mash too well.  Thanks!

My husband, who does not like eggplant, told me to be sure I wrote a review to say how good this was!  I fried it like potato pancakes.  One comment:  try to get as much water out of the eggplant as possible.

This is a very good recipe and easy to make.  I never thought eggplant could taste so good.  They are also good as a sandwich with a slice of tomato and lettuce--kind of like a veggie burger.  Next time I am going to try to bake them instead of frying--for a healthier recipe.

Ugh. I don’t know what went wrong. Too much eggplant, even though the recipe was scaled down AND I only used half the recommended. The patties
didn’t stick together until you fried the death out of them, at which point they tasted fine but made the whole house smell of hot oil for a week.
I wasn’t happy with this recipe at all.

When the patties hit the oil they exploded. The oily remains were tasty, but difficult to serve.

Altered the recipe for 3 servings since I only had one eggplant on hand.  Reviews were what really convinced me to go ahead and make these.  This sounded like it would taste so great and I followed the recipe exactly.  I also opted for the oven baked method.  They looked delicious, exactly like the picture.  Took the first bite and it was so bland I couldn't believe it! I forced myself to eat two and actually tossed the third one.  Not sure what I could do to make it better since the ingredients sounded perfect.  Very disappointed.

This was soooo delish!!
I used 2 med eggplants and 1 small zucchini, I boiled and then used my food processor to mash. Used 1 egg, and added more breadcrumbs as needed, also did not use as much salt as recipe called for.  Family loved it

really liked the flavor but found the mix to still be a bit too wet after mixing all the ingredients....did drain the eggplant first...so I put it all in a fine strainer and let it sit over the sink a bit first, then lightly coated them in flour before frying....they held together better for me. My only favor thing: I found them to be a tad salty/would cut back on the salt the next time but will make them again,

Very mixed review on this: My kids and husband (none of whom like eggplant) ate these without complaint. The fact they resemble burgers in appearance and have little eggplant flavor helped a lot. I did not like them though -- I found them really bland, too soft, heavy on the flavor of breadcrumbs and without enough eggplant flavor.  This is a recipe better for those who don't like eggplant than for those who do - I won't make again.

I did not care for these.  I love eggplant, but I thought the sharp cheddar overshadowed the flavor of the eggplant.  If I were to try making it again, I definitely would cut back on the cheese and possibly eliminating it.

This recipe is fantastic! I used zucchini in the place of eggplant before to experiment and it was just as good as it was with the eggplant. I also used fresh Parmesan in the place of cheddar and put a tomato sauce on top. Either way it's great and a good recipe for an appetizer, snack, or for vegetarians.

This was really good! I baked it in the oven at 350* for 12 minutes on each side. I shaped it in to patties and served as sandwiches. I see now that I forgot to add the pepper, but it's probably better that way anyway. I'll make it again.

We all love eggplant in my house so I knew this would be a hit. A few changes: used an Italian 4 cheese blend of shredded cheese instead of cheddar, added some romano cheese, used fresh parsley instead of dried, egg whites instead of whole eggs, and whole wheat seasoned crumbs. Made 8 nice sized patties that I made yesterday and individually wrapped and froze. I left these out on the counter for awhile to slightly thaw and cooked them on a dry griddle type skillet until nice and brown on both sides. My girls at them with pasta sauce and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  This is a great make ahead and freeze meal. Thanks!

Its OK.  Bland if you eat alone.  I can see in a sandwich with condiments and lettuce etc better.  I increased the seasoning a lot.  More salt, cumin, adobo, italian seasoning, paprika and still thought it was missing something.

These were delicious.  I did saute the onion first, as I hate biting into crunchy onions.  I elected to bake these and served them as burgers with jarred sauce rather than the traditional burger toppings

Love this recipe!  My 16 year old son loved it, my 5 year old daughter loved it and my husband loved it!  I was skeptical but we were all pleasantly surprised.  I did it exactly as the recipe instructs and it turned out perfectly.  We will definitely make this again!

Very tasty -- sort of easier version of Eggplant Parmesian. As is, I give it 4 stars.  If you layer it adding Marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese and baked for about 25 min. it's definitely a 5. Made the mistake of not draining the water, so came out somewhat soupy, but still managed to pan fry with a tad olive oil sprayed on pan.

First of all let me start by saying this is an excellent dish. I have eggplants in my garden and now that it's almost harvest time, I had to look for ways to use this in recipes. I had to make some adjustments to the recipe. I didn't use chesse because my sister can't eat cheese. I didn't have bread or bread crumbs so I used cornmeal. I dry roasted the cornmeal with Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. I used cilantro and green hot chili pepper to taste (read lot) from my garden. I took the advice from another reviewer and baked them in 350 degree oven for 23 minutes because I wanted them to be little bit crunchy. I hate altering any recipe but I wanted to share my first crop of eggplant with my sister. Next time I'll make it according to this recipe exactly and post a review as well.

WOW!  One of few I've given 5 stars.  I added crushed corn flakes (which you can buy pre-crushed) and these were awesome!  I didn't have any trouble mashing, but did have to microwave much longer than the directions stated.  I served with a spicy tomato sauce that I had made for some stuffed banana peppers I was making at the same time.

Great way to use eggplant!  Followed the suggestion of another person and made into a casserole instead of patties.  Added cheese into and on top. Also added a few dried mushrooms I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe

This is a great way to eat eggplant. I suggest cutting the eggplant in small squares so it takes less time in the microwave, mine took to long to softened. I would only use 1/2 teaspoon salt because the cheese and crumbs already have sodium and it came a bit to salty.

Made a 1/2 batch, used Panko & herbs instead of Italian breadcrumbs, and fresh parsley instead of dried. Served with a cream sauce of sour cream, milk, lemon juice, dill, and 3 drops hot sauce.  Scrumptious!

Yum!  I used 1 cup of onions and also added a diced red pepper.  Used more bread crumbs than called for, and found only one egg was necessary.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked them in the oven.  Delicious!

Made the recipe just as directed. Needed to add bread crumb because it was too wet. In order to cook through, you should use smallish patties otherwise the center is gummy.

We are not big eggplant eaters, but we made these in an effort to not let the eggplant given to us go to waste, and they were actually pretty good!
Served with spaghetti, and would make this meal again.

Excellent recipe.  I only had 1 eggplant on hand, so I added 2 zucchinis.  I microwaved them whole then scooped out the insides instead of chopping in advance.  Less work. I added the recommended extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and cooked in the oven for 20 minutes, flipping them over after 10 minutes. Turned out great.  Will surely make these again.

Maybe I didn't microwave the eggplants long enough because I could not mash them into smooth paste. So I ended up putting everything into the food processor, which made the batter manageable. I added 1/2 cup extra breadcrumbs to bind the batter. I also baked the croquettes at 400c for 15 minutes on each side. Leftovers were nice, even cold.

I've made these a few times, and they always come out great.  I omit the onions since I don't like them, but I increase the garlic.  They are easy and are great eaten like hamburgers.

I love this recipe. I also had a problem getting it soft enough to mash but adding a little water and microwaving a lot longer did the trick.  I used plain bread crumbs and added extra salt, cayenne pepper, red/green/black ground peppercorns, extra cheese and fried in butter. Absolutely delicious. Thank you.

these turned out so yummy!  my husband requested that i make them again and i definitely will.  i also added more breadcrumbs since the mixture was a bit wet to form the patties (maybe 1/2 cup?).. and i used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  these would be great in a pita falafel-style, too :)

What a great new way to serve main dish eggplant!  I did add a couple of handfuls of oatmeal as was suggested by another reviewer.  These won't make 'patties' so I scooped spoonfuls into the pan that flattened while cooking.

These were delicious and not at all bitter as eggplant can sometimes be.  I thought we would need a sauce but honestly these stand on their own quite well.

These were delicious and I don't even like eggplant!  I reduced the fat by just spraying a griddle with pam and grilling them that way and I had no problem with them falling apart.

This was the first time my husband & I had tried eggplant & we loved it!  I cooked it on the grill in a wok, and eventhough the croquettes didn't stay together, the taste was wonderful.  My husband is already asking when I'll make them again!

These were delicious! My 13 year old hates eggplant and she liked them too (didn't tell her what was in them!). I added a little hot sauce to the mixture and it was nice that way. The leftovers were stuffed in to pitas the next day with sprouts and salsa, and some with lettuce and mayo...yum!

This was a really simple and tasty dish to make. I used a food processor to "mash' the cooked eggplant as it was tough to mash by hand. They also are great the next day, unheated!

Just made this now and found it quite nice. I chopped up the eggplant first then microwaved it but didn't mash it too much such that the croquettes still retained bits of identifiable eggplant which was quite nice. Overall a nice recipe but might try mixing in other ingredients next time.

Made almost as directed, just used onion powder and garlic powder instead of onion and garlic. Must say it was rather bland, not particularly tasty. There is nothing in here that gives this any original flavor so was rather disappointed.  Some added cumin and other spices, perhaps I should have done so also.  Will not rush to make this again...

Even my husband admitted these would make a great burger. Crisp on the outside, al dente on the inside. The patties might fall apart if the eggplant isn’t mashed REALLY well. We microwaved the eggplant much longer than prescribed, lightly blended it in a processor, then used a fine strainer to rid of excess liquid. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. TIP: Sticking patties in oil that isn’t hot enough will make for soggy patties. Heat the oil first and make sure you hear a nice sizzle when the patties first go in.

Honestly I hate eggplant and my husband loves it, so I am always looking for some new ideas.  I loved this recipe with some slight changes.  I used one whole onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  Also I just used whatever left over cheese I had in the house and it worked great.  To compliment this dish I roasted some tomatoes with garlic salt and a bunch of italian herbs and placed them on top.  Came out perfect.

Any recipe that is great for you and the kids love is a winner. I planted more eggplant in my garden this year so I could make this recipe.  I am going to try and bake it like a meatloaf next.

I made this for my wife, who is a picky vegetarian and she really enjoyed it (as did I). I made a half order, so only one eggplant. I mashed it but didn't like the results I was getting so I threw it in the food processor for a couple seconds. I made 8 small patties, which was perfect for the two of us. 

Instead of frying them, I broiled them on a low shelf for 15 mins, raised then up to the top shelf for 2, flipped them and moved them back down to a lower shelf for another 15 - 20, and then back up to the top for another 2. They came out with a crunchy exterior and a well cooked center, not mushy inside. 

I felt that they were a touch salty, so I would back off the salt and check my seasoned breadcrumbs for salt content next time. I served them with a soy/rice wine/sesame sauce. Not the right choice and we ended up not using it. They were fine on their own. Next time I think I will try a tzadziki sauce.

Very tasty! I omitted the cheese and used zatar seasoning instead of parsley. This recipe has room for tweaks or is great on its own.

I have no idea what I could have done wrong, but the eggplant simply would not get soft enough to mash.  I tried microwaving it longer, but that didn't help either.

Quick??  Not really.  I roasted the eggplant and onions for at least a 1/2 hour or more after dicing both very fine.  Did season the eggplant and drizzled with olive oil before putting in oven.  Since the eggplant was diced so fine, it really didn't need much mashing.  Used only 1 egg and two cloves of garlic when making the patties.  Got about 9 patties out of the 1 large and 1 med. size eggplant.  It was an interesting recipe and one I haven't decided if I'll try again.

4 and a half stars, using Japanese eggplant. Salted and sweated them first for 25 min and then roasted for 25 min w/ EVOO drizzle at 350 before proceeding. I was shocked that my two picky toddlers liked these! I had made roast chicken too, thinking they wouldn't eat these and they ate the croquettes instead of the chicken. Kids are so unpredictable! :) Anyway, it's a very good way to get vegetables in your kids. :)

Even my carnivore husband liked this---actually he raved about it which is really saying something!  Like others have mentioned, I baked these at 350 for about 25 minutes rather than frying---saved the calories and easier cleanup--they were great!

I have never tried eggplant before.  My young son & I pick out a new fruit &/or vegetable to try each week.  This week was eggplant.  Having said that, I ran across this recipe and thought it sounded like a good one to try.  I halved the recipe as I only had one eggplant.  I should not have done this as the flavor was a bit on the bland side with only the strong eggplant flavor.  Apparently I am not a fan of eggplant so I will tweak this recipe to my liking next time.  In future (for my notes), if halved again, I will add 2-3 garlic cloves, a touch more onion &/or onion powder, and a bit more salt, possibly use more bread crumbs too.  I didn't bake them as others have but would like to try them that way also.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Even though I feel the recipe needs tweaked for my liking, my young son said they were yummy!!  Which is why I rated a 4 instead of a 3.

Great way to get my son to eat eggplant! He thought they were cookies when I put them on the table so I ran with it! I also decided to bake them as suggested in one of the reviews. They still turned out crispy and great!

Wow! I wasn't expecting much from this recipe but I was very surprised with the flavor. I love eggplant and plan to use this recipe more often. I did use 1 1/2 large eggplant since the grocery store only had large and extra large eggplants. Also, I used leftover red onion and made fresh bread crumbs with about 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning. I didn't have dried parsley so I omitted that. Next time, I would like to try baking the croquettes. Served with leftover Chunky Marinara Saue, Caprese Salad, and French Bread with olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip.

These were okay, but not my favorite.  I can see how people would like them as a veggie burger.  I roasted the eggplant in the oven since microwaving destroys nutrients and then I put all ingredients in the food processor for easy mixing.  I fried them in a combo of chicken schmaltz, butter, and olive oil, since that was what I had on hand.  The flavor was good, but not really eggplanty enough for me, more bread crumb- and cheesy.  So probably a great recipe if you're not a true eggplant fan and are trying to hide the taste.  But if you really enjoy the flavor of eggplant, you might want to cut the bread and cheese down to let the eggplant shine through.

I cut this recipe in half, but wish i had made the whole thing!  They were really fabulous.  I found I needed a little bit more breadcrumbs to firm them up a bit.  Once I made the patties I dipped them in breadcrumbs just before frying them, just so the outside would be a bit crisp.  You could easily experiment with cheeses and panko breadcrumbs.  We really didn't taste the cheese.  We will definitely make these again.

Loved the result of this recipe!  Tastes like an amazing veggie burger.  I upped the amount of onions just because I like them.  I think it could go for 3/4 tsp salt at the most though.  My husband thought it was ok, but I found it was a little salty.  Delicious!

this is a great recipe but I had problems with it.  When I put them in the pan to fry they stuck to the pan and I think it was cause of the cheese.  So I had to bake them.  My recommendation is if you want to put in the cheese, bake them.  If not, then you can fry them but I think the cheese makes them  really stick to the pan.  They taste great though....really delicious and I will make them again...probably fry them

Easy and delicious (even according to the non-eggplant eater in the house)! Next time I'll try baking them instead of pan frying and will serve on toasted buns, smothered with red sauce and mozarella cheese for a twist on eggplant parmesan sandwiches.

This has become a favorite in our house! I've made it several different ways ~ the original recipe with cheddar, with mozzarella & parm. served with pasta & sauce ~ and our favorite way, with spinach & feta.

So good!  I used 1/2 cup of parm cheese instead of sharp cheddar and topped with marinara sauce and shredded mozzerella/provalone mix.  Baked for 10 minutes in 425 degree oven until cheese was melted.  My hubby said it was something he would pay for at a resturant witch is a huge compliment for him.

I love this idea.  We had an eggplant from the garden and wanted to do something with it.  This was the perfect choice.  My 11 year old nephew said it tasted like stuffing, so we have now incorporated it into our Thanksgiving meal when we can find eggplant at the store.  Very tasty and creative.

These are excellent. Completely satisfying. Bought an eggplant and was wondering what to do with it when this recipe popped into my inbox and I made it tonight for dinner. Substituted a zuchini for one of the eggplants, as I only had 1. Served it with red marinara sauce and parmesan cheese. A HUGE HIT!!

These are tasty and original.  I also halved the recipe since I had only one eggplant, and made some adjustments.  I had some leftover breadsticks that I crumbled for the bread crumbs, and I added a tsp. of Italian seasoning.  I minced the onions so they would cook more thoroughly, and used much less oil for cooking- about 1/4 c.

Yummy. Make sure the oil isn't too hot, I burnt the first one, but the rest were great. Even the kids polished them off with a rich tomato sauce on top.

I loved this recipe.  I am a vegetarian and this made a delicious entree for dinner.  The only change I made was that I used only 1/2 tsp. salt, and I needed much less oil to saute' my patties.  I also added some Italian seasoning.  Delicious!

Good recipe, just needs a bit of extra flavor.  Just added a couple tablespoons of ketchup and fried them in a lightly oiled pan.  Even if you don't peel the eggplants, they still turn out quite well.

These are delicious! i had an eggplant that was starting to take a turn for the worst and wanted something yummy and easy to make with it. Loved that this recipe microwaves it instead of waiting for it to bake. I had one huge eggplant and used a whole onion and 2 cloves of garlic, also i had no eggs but the batter was sticky enough that it didnt really matter. I used a grill pan to cook them instead of frying and they came out great. plus it made 8 big "burgers" so i froze half for another time. I would definitely make these again

This was very, very good. I have to admit that about halfway through I got bored with making patties and dumped the rest of the mix into the frying pan and cooked it like hash. Tasted as good as the patties with the same texture. I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. A great way to use eggplant.

Tasty and the kids, 8 and 10, enjoyed it. I halfed the recipe and made 8 croquettes. I ran the eggplant through the food processor after steaming it, because I wasn't having a lot of luck mashing it. Not a health food, but tasty.

Excellent!!!  I roasted the eggplant for 30 minutes on 325, drizzled with olive oil and salt and papper.  I mashed the eggplant with a potato masher and it worked perfectly.  This is the first time I ever cooked with eggplant.  I also used Mozz cheese instead of Cheddar.  Will certainly make again!  May try as a casserole next time!!

I substituted 1 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup parmesan for the cheddar because I thought it would be more in line with the Italian seasoning and marinara sauce I served it with. This was a bit messy when shaping into patties, but they turned out well and my husband asked for seconds. He is asking for me to make it again!

This was surprisingly good, but a little on the salty side. I might omit the salt completely next time I make this, as the Italian bread crumbs and the cheddar cheese have plenty of flavor. I halved the recipe (used one medium eggplant which I roasted in the oven) and it made about seven 4-inch diameter croquettes which was plenty for the two of us when served with soup and garlic bread. Very hearty, and good for "meatless Mondays."

I absolutely HATE the idea of taking a vegetable and then adding bread and cheese, and frying it.  It absolutely negates the whole nutritional value of the veggie in the first place.  HOWEVER, I hate eggplant even more :-).  So I tried this because I had an eggplant that husband wanted me to buy.  Not bad at all.  I will probably add more seasoning the next time I make it, but I will make it again.  My sons even ate it.  I am absolutely amazed.  I did find it hard to strike a balance between oil temp and burning the breadcrumbs though because I never fry anything so I am not that good at it.  I think I might try to bake the next time.  Anyway, nice recipe.  Thanks.

We loved this recipe, however, I had to review it so that others will know... when you cook the eggplant, make sure you cut it in small pieces so it will cook all the way.  Also, the eggplant was too difficult to mash! Next time I make this, I will just put it in the food processor and shred it up.  That way, the spongy texture of the eggplant does not get in the way of this delicious vegetarian meal.

What a great idea. A much as I love eggplant I have to idea what to do with it. This recipe is a great staple. I changed it a bit. I crushed 3 pieces if rye bread I had toasted. Added an egg (this is a must, it fell appart) 2 tbsp diced pepper and added 2 tbsp of blackened spice. So yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  After microwaving, I realized that my eggplant wasnt' soft enough to mash. I ended up sticking the eggplant in my blender for a very quick blend (i did not liquify it ).  After this I put the eggplant and the rest of the ingredients together into patties and put them in the fridge to firm up for about 3 hours.  I was able to make 9 patties from this.  I cooked 4 and froze the others.  These had an excellent flavor. I also think you could use them as a veggie burger.  maybe using pita bread and some kind of sauce for topping them.  I will definately make these again.

I would have given this 6 stars if I could.  This is a great alternative to eggplant parm and is very easy.  No need to modify the recipe at all... even from one who always does.

My family loved these, and we're not big eggplant eaters, but my son wanted to try one so I found this- and the promise is true- will make you an eggplant lover! I couldn't believe how tasty and how easy! Per other reviews, I used a bit more bread crumbs and refrigerated patties before frying, both seemed to help.

When I brought eggplant home from a co-worker's garden, I was met with a big grimace. I'm not big on veggies either, but I was determined to give this a try. To mash the microwaved eggplant, I used a hand blender leaving some chunks for texture then baked them on a shiny baking sheet at 350 for 30 minutes, turning over half way through. This recipe reminds me of a vegetarian crab cake and has helped us find a way to eat more veggies. Thank you for an original recipe!

Don't you think they stay too soft inside? You can't saute them for too long, as the bread crumbs on the outside would burn. Therefore, you can't cook them through... What is the secret???

Pretty good, At first I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a little bland and needing a bit more texture. So to the mixture I added 3 mini-bella mushrooms chopped, about a tablespoon of fresh basil and half tablespoon of fresh oregano and it brightened up wonderfully. Really an excellent base recipe that can be adjusted to one's taste.

Let me start by saying that DH & I don't even like eggplant...but we LOVED these.  I followed other recs and added 1/2 c. of breadcrumbs and pan fried in the oven in my cast iron skillet (10 min. each side @ 350).  Served with spaghetti & marinara sauce.  So good!  I also think it could be a good veggie burger, served on a bun w/ lettuce & tomato.

I thought this tasted okay, but my family was not that thrilled with it.  Eggplant parmesan is still my favorite eggplant dish.  Made a half a batch and the only change was that I used garlic powder instead of the real deal.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  We keep getting eggplant from our CSA and my partner hated it -- but now she loves this recipe.  I have made it multiple times now and it's always a winner.  The only change is that I just use one egg and that seems to get it just the right consistency.

These had great flavor, but mine were extra runny.  I added all the breadcrumbs and then 1/4 C flour and they were still runny!  There was no chance of making patties, so I spooned then out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment.  It worked out great to bake them instead of frying and they stayed together nicely on the parchment.

These were delicious!  I also have an abundance of eggplant and this was a great new treat!  I thought the vegetable oil would have too low of a flash point, so I fried these in palm oil and bacon fat in a cast iron skillet - delicious!  Next time I might also try an oil free version on our electric griddle.

Also, I added some cayenne pepper, and would suggest fresh parsley instead of dried, that really gives them an added kick!

I made this last night and was really disappointed. I love eggplant and after reading all the reviews thought this would be a good addition to my files. It was way too much bread, and salt. Maybe my eggplants were too small. I did bake them first then mix and bake again to cut down on the fat. BUT I won't make again.

So tasty! These are awesome. My hubby isn't a fan of veggies of any kind but even he had to admit that these could pass for a burger with a few modifications like adding breadcrumbs and a little bit more cheese. Overall, great and creative use of eggplant.

Really like this recipe.  I reduced the egg like others suggested, and steamed the eggplants.  They were small thin style so there were very few seeds.

I formed patties and baked on a oven stone with a little spritz of olive oil versus frying, and used a blend of monteray jack and cheddar cheese.  These freeze great and are easy to grab with an english muffin for a quick meal! 

Will make again and again!

I cooked the eggplant in the microwave for 10 min. and I still could not get it to mash!!  so I kept the cubes and put them into the rest of the mixture (which would stick) It was a complete catastrophe!!

These are very good.  I love to find new recipes for eggplant. I have to agree that it was a little difficult to mash up!  Also I fried them in olive oil instead of veggie oil.  Will make again.

This was very good, but I am a little concerned about the amount of fat injected by frying it in oil.  This seems to stick together fairly well, so I will bake it next time.  Also, I had a little touble getting the eggplant soft enough to mash, until I covered it while cooking it in the microwave.

Good recipe, something a little different. I am a vegetarian who was looking for something like a salmon quoqette (without the salmon). This was a nice alternative and it gave me something new to make for my family. Quick to make and tasty!

I have been looking for years for a receipe like this ever since my sister-in-law made it for me 20 years ago.  I love it!  The only thing I would do differently is use half italian breadcrumbs and half plain.  It's easy and really good with ranch dressing!

In my husbands words "This is the bomb!" He loved it, I loved our 4 year old loved it. I served them on a bed of mixed greens and drizzled blue cheese dressing over the top. It made for a very pleasing presentation.

Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe several times and i love it-- the only thing i don't like is the frying part-- not the healthiest way to cook--
i tried adding some more filler-- ie chopped up spinach, carrots, and bread crumbs then grilled them-- they kind of make a homemade veggie burger-- yes they are messy but use less egg and more ingredients-- i

My husband & I loved this ! When I first started mashing & mixing, it didn't look very appealing  ....In fact, my husband said that it looked a little "dog foodish" ... I pretty much stuck with the recipe ... added a little more onion & some basil and garlic seasoning... I used about 1/2 C measure to make the paddies. I think part of the trick is why you fry them, not to flip them too soon... I will definitely make these again . We love eggplant and this is a great and easy way to use it.

Great recipe! I added extra bread crumbs and used the air fryer instead of the pan frying to cut the oil out. Turned out awesome. Used ranch for dipping.

I liked them but would add Parmesan cheese garlic powder and onion powder to add more flavor. Otherwise the recipe was good.

I prepared my eggplant a little differently - I didn't peel it and I cubed it then put it under a broiler. I used panko breadcrumbs. I then put small quantities into a muffin tin and baked them.
Placed some in the freezer for another day and a few I wanted to eat I fried them in about 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Came out great!

This dish is outstanding, and one of the best recipes for eggplant  we've found.  Made some minor changes to the recipe....
Used fresh parsley because we had some.
Fried the croquettes in a few tablespoons of olive oil instead of vegetable oil and,
Added about a teaspoon of (Konriko) Greek Seasoning.
Easy and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I used sharp white cheddar cheese and sauted the onions and garlic together. I also had two larger eggplants so I used about a cup and a half of breadcrumbs and two cups of cheese. They are delicious.

I should preface this saying I'm NOT. fan of eggplant in general largely due to the texture. 

this worked perfectly though. it needs a crema or sauce finish. I combined this with another fish and had a cream cheese/peppers/dijon mustard/chipotle/hummus topping for it, but multiple people who arent eggplant fans raved about it. we have leftovers, but they WILL be eaten. 

Absolutely delicious.

The eggplant turned out rubbery from microwaving.  Definitely could have used more cheese .   They were ok next time will roast and add more cheese and some parmesan too.

This is a great recipe.  We followed it exactly.
I was happy to find a way to use eggplant this summer without turning on the oven - just the stove top.
We served it with angel hair pasta and spaghetti sauce.  Delicious!

I don't have a microwave, so I used my oven and maybe I didn't leave them in long enough but they didn't mash well.. So the burgers didn't work out because the eggplant was still slightly chunky. My solution was to throw it all in the cast iron, and put it back in the oven at 400.

I made a few changes. I drizzled olive oil on eggplant and baked for about 35 mins to soften and give a roasted taste.  I sautéed red onions, green, yellow and orange peppers.  I also used Mexican Cheese blend. Once I mixed everything together. I put patties in the over for about 30 mins to firm them up. Then I pan fried the patties with a little olive oil to brown on each side. They came out great. Love this and will definitely cook again.

These were a good side. I read some reviews and 1)roasted the eggplant instead of microwaving it; 2)served them with a spicy mayo dip & 3)sautéed the onion and garlic before adding to the eggplant mix. I also used cumin and oregano for my spices-no parsley or Italian seasoning. I will make these again for sure.

I roasted the eggplant and baked the patties. They were a little more "squishy" than I would have liked. We made into burgers as others suggested. We're not huge eggplant fans, so maybe this rating is unfair (especially since I didn't fry them), but this recipe did little to change our opinion of the veggie.

The cheddar was prominent on the first few eggplants I dipped, but after that almost no cheddar made it to the eggplant slices. I would suggest trying to sprinkle the cheese over the slices rather than trying to dip.

These were absolutely delicious and very easy to make! The only thing I didn't do was shape them into patties. I just put a big portion in pan and flattened to resemble a pattie. They were a little salty the first night so I will probably decrease how much salt I add. I will definitely make these again. They are a great meatless entree alternative.

Very simple and tasty dish. Doesn't tasty "eggplanty" so much as just sort of Italian. I made about a half-recipe and used regular bread crumbs and added oregano, basil, and a pinch of cayenne. Otherwise followed the directions, and it came out great!

I had about 30 mini eggplant.  I roasted them in the oven, took the meat out with the seeds, put it thru the food mill.  Out came a (not to appetizing) runny mess.  I put it aside for awhile, figuring how I could turn this mess into cakes.  So I threw in bread crumbs, cheese, onion, garlic, parsley and 2 eggs.  I sprinkled Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute over them. Lo and behold they came together nicely.  I used a large ice cream scoop to make the mounds and mashed them into a patty.  Put them in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.  My boyfriend fried them up while I was at the gym.  I came home to a wonderful aroma.  I took one bite and gave them 5 stars, delicious!

Roasted eggplant and then baked patties as reviewers recommended.  Placing this one along to family members since it was enjoyed by all.

I had eggplants that needed used and this recipe looked appealing.  I followed the recipe in making this dish.  My family and I ultimately liked the flavor and consistency of the croquettes. They were, however, very difficult to work with.  They did not hold their shape at all when frying, so turning them while cooking was very difficult and they ended up like a blob on our dinner plates.  I will plan to make these again, but I will follow some of the suggestions and bake them.

This dish turned out even better than I anticipated. Cooking eggplant is always a hit or miss for me and this dish was a slam dunk. I added more seasoning than listed but stayed in the realm of Italian spices. Even the leftovers the next day were delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Mind blown.  My 6, 5 and 1.5 year old gobbled it up. My youngest doesn't eat any meat or veggies either, and got seconds. We took the eggplants from the garden, and as others mentioned, put the raw eggplant in the oven as opposed to microwave. We also used almond flour instead of bread crumbs. Put them on buns with fresh tomatoes and ranch dressing, and were amazing. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

I grated the eggplant and doubled the recipe.  Added a little cumin.  I also roasted eggplant, onion, garlic and carrots then used an immersion blender to smooth eggplant mixture.

I couldn't get past the microwave until soft.  They never got soft enough to mash.  We ended up throwing it all away.

Not much to it, I'm afraid. My eggplant wasn't optimal so I will try again but it was pretty bland. I had homemade breadcrumbs and added a ton of spice but it was just ok.

Great recipe!! Simple to make and easy to follow directions. However I follow others advice and bake them. They turn our perfect and make amazing veggie burgers! Some days that's how we even eat them. The blend of spices is just right. Even my youngest, who's over a yr loves them!

Great way to use up eggplants from the garden.  Serve as you would a regular burger.  Gave this recipe 5/5 since my son said next time I need to make a huge batch since they tasted so good.  I added a pepper, baked the eggplant, only used one egg.

I halved the recipe for 1 eggplant, it made 8 croquettes. The batter was very wet, so i used 1 1/2 C bread crumbs. I made breadcrumbs from white,wheat, and rye bread.  I used dehydrated onions, greek seasoning, garlic, and rosemary. Molded patties by hand, and baked in the oven.

Great recipe ! We took a few turns from the list...We used Gouda cheese shredded and chopped fine,  half shallots half onion & doubled the garlic. We grew our own eggplant so it was super fresh...we used coconut oil....these are the bomb. will make again... we froze some for next time. Make sure to chop everything fine.

Made this for lunch and served it with a dollop of sour cream and a dash of my favorite hot sauce. Whole family loved it! Additionally I made a batch of kale chips and the addition of the crunchy kale chip made a wonderful combo. Just to add a side a note...my family is pure Conovers....if I don't serve meat with a dish it's a huge controversy. So I'm very suprized that they all loved this.

Delicious! I diced the eggplants, shredded one carrot in food processor, diced a green pepper, added a clove of minced garlic, basil, parsley. Mixed all together in a casserole dish with a bit of olive oil on the bottom. Drizzled a little olive oil on top.  gave a few shakes and put in preheated oven at 350 for 25 min.  Removed from oven, cooled  and placed in food processor.  Pulsed until  ground but not soupy.  Transferred to bowl, adding  breadcrumbs and 2 eggs, mozzarella cheese, parmesan romano cheese and mixed with a fork.  Formed patties and placed on baking sheet lined with wax paper.  Set in refrigerator for at least an hour.  Fried 5 min each side and came out great!

We didn't especially care for this recipe.  I made 1/2 recipe, six patties, but had three left overs.  I fried them in hot oil, they held together fine but seemed to lack flavor.  I added some chili sauce and topped them with cheese hoping to improve the flavor.  They needed some sort of sauce, perhaps spaghetti sauce, but then just make eggplant parm.  Won't be making this again.

It tasted pretty good but the process was pretty messy.  I put everything in the food processor then made the patties and fried them until they were crunchy on the outside.  The batter is very wet and sticky so it is hard to make the patties.  They kind of tasted like Spanish "alcapurrias".  My husband could not tell that they were made with eggplants.  He guessed potatoes or green plantains.

This is now my favorite eggplant recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, but I did add cilantro to punch it up a bit.  The mix was a little loose because I forgot to squeeze out the eggplant, but just scooped it into the pan with an ice cream scoop.

I took some of the suggestions about baking it and turning it into a burger. It won't get as crispy as frying but it was flavorful and delicious. Will def make again.

I'm going to make it again tonight. It was delicious!  My husband was trying to figure out what "meat" he was eating. I combined Italian bread crumbs with panko and Cajun seasoning.  I also used a mixture of parmasean, mozzarella,  and cheddar cheese. The flavor was amazing!

This is an excellent dish!  I cut the recipe in half but added extra seasonings to my liking. Also bake them in 425 degree oven on non-stick foil and turned them over halfway.  Added a little grated zucchini and some cumin for added flavor. I will make this again and may add mashed black beans next time.

I had an eggplant in my fridge I had forgotten about and I didn't want to make eggplant Parmesan. I decided to try this even though I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used crushed Ritz crackers and added Italian seasoning. 
My husband's comment was, " doesn't look too appetizing, but it sure tastes good". 
I fried mine for about half the time suggested, and they were crispy outside and melt in your mouth inside.
This recipe is a keeper.

My kids loved this recipe. A good way to get your kids to eat egg plant if they normally don't.  I used corn flakes bread crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I also added paprika.  Very yummy will be making these again.

I really liked this recipe! I made it almost exactly as it called for but I didn't have any onion and I used onion powder.  Mine were a little spicy and I'm thinking that's why.  I  baked my eggplant in the oven and I cut it into half inch thick slices before I did it and brushed it with olive oil, put salt and pepper on it and it turned out wonderful. I had no problem smashing it whatsoever. I cooked mine in an electric skillet at 350 degrees for three minutes on each side. My roommate loved them! I told him they were made with eggplant and he almost keeled over!

I made this today for lunch, as I had some eggplant I wanted to use up along with a few other items.  I added half of a red pepper I sautéed with a shredded carrot that I had in the fridge.  I didn't have cheddar , but used an artisan cheese that was flavored with roasted garlic and basil.  They were delicious!  Don't worry about the gloopy consistency, as they cooked up just fine without spreading out.  Served with a dollop of sour cream, and it was a great lunch.  I will definitely make these again!

absolutely delicious. Cooking them was a bit of trial and error, we started off setting them in a pan of oil and baking them in the oven. Then we drained the oil and continued baking so they could get nice and crisp. Next time, we will pan fry them first and then finish off in the oven.

I only had one eggplant so I shredded a medium zucchini to add instead. It has a loose consistency but I decided to grill them anyway using a grill sauté pan ( it has lots of little holes in it). They were fantastic!!! I melted asiago cheese over the top. Soooo yummy.

This turned out great! The eggplant is hidden since it is mashed- I microwaved it for 8 minutes then pureed in my blender, so my kiddos ate these as cheesy pancakes, not minding the eggplant at all. I used mozzarella and parmesan, along with asiago cheeses and used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. Cooked them like pancakes on my griddle with olive oil. Would definitely consider using marinara as a topping next time- think it would complement these wonderfully! Thanks for a fresh way to use my abundance of eggplant!

My wife and I really loved this recipe, the only change I made was to use 2 squash in place of one of the eggplant.. I think I'm going to experiment next time with adding some other veggies to the recipes.

Made this for five very hungry, very picky boys. They loved it! I sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on top and served it with a nice salad.

No bad. The flavor of these croquettes are great- just a bit too dry for me. Maybe I added a bit to much bread crumbs to cause the dryness? Maybe it needs a good sauce or dressing to dip in?

I have some leftover mix - I'll try adding some moisture to the mix then fry tomorrow and see if that helps the dryness.

Wonderful, didn't use as many breadcrumbs trying to be lower carb! Added some parmesean and Romano and boy they were tasty. Definitely a keeper.

Here is a good idea if you forget the first step as I did. I omitted microwaving and mashing and had a mixture of raw cubed eggplant plus all other ingredients.  I then spray oiled a casserole dish, added the mixture, put grated Parmesan on top and baked at 400.  It was delicious!

I was hoping to get my kids to eat healthier, but they really aren't eggplant fans.  I made this, and they loved it.  My husband and I didn't even get any because our 3 kids ate it all (which we were good with).  Will try to "healthy it up" in the future, but so glad to see them love this!!

i "pre-made" this for tomorrow's dinner.. but me and bf shared one of the patties to try them out.. very tasty.. i'm lost as to how ppl thought this was bland.. i made my own italian seasoned bread crumbs.. used fresh cilantro in place of the dried parsley.. and doubled the garlic.. after i had mixed everything together i put it in the fridge to firm up and then formed the patties and placed them on a silicone mat.. baked in the oven at 350 for 30 min's.. flipping half way through as others had suggested.. bare in mind my oven is old and usually takes longer to cook most anything.. will be serving it with a simple side of pasta and marinara.. ty for the recipe

These are great!  I baked the eggplant and pureed in my food processor.  Only used Parm cheese, no cheddar and made them into meatballs.  Baked them in the oven, no frying and served them in tomato sauce with spagetti.  They look like real meatballs and taste great, everyone loved them.  I made a huge bunch, baked and individually froze the balls for future use.  Great meat substitute.

I loved it.  Anyone who likes eggplant should enjoy this recipe.  I used stuffing crumbs (not with water added) and grilled the croquettes in my George Foreman = less calories BY FAR.  Nice in a great Stadium Bun with mayo, mustard, Swiss cheese and Bread 'n Butter pickles.  I halved the recipe and it made three good-sized patties.  Of course, my non-eating eggplant husband was disappointed but finished his burger.

Loved this recipe! I think it would make a cool appetizer with parmesan peppercorn dipping sauce or ranch. For an appetizer I would make very small patties or balls. I only used 1 egg and 1 eggplant. I increased the breadcrumbs a little so the patties were firmer. I also pan fried them as suggested by other reviewers.

The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I added oregano and basil...with that being said, the flavor was ok but we found this too salty and WAY WAY WAY too oily - it actually made me nauseous. I rarely fry anything and when I do, its only with like a tablespoon or less of EVOO. I should have went with my gut and not used this cooking method. I will not be making this again.

This was good, I think you really need to process the eggplant and next time I'll try steaming it instead of the microwave.  That said, I really enjoyed this recipe.  I topped it with marinara sauce and some italian cheese.  This would be a great starter to a nice Italian dinner.

Oh jeez! Didn't even measure anything, grated low fat cheddar, gruyere and parm, and its sooo yummy! My hubby says he hates eggplant, but i didn't tell him what it was--- and he loved it! Also, only cooked 4 at a time (burger size) in a TBSP of EVOO. New staple can't wait to make again!

I just made these and as someone who doesn't like eggplant, these are fantastic! Only did one thing different, instead of cheddar cheese I used an Italian cheese blend. These were a huge hit in my house, even my two year old loved them! Will definitely make these again.

I found this delicious.  I don't know what Italian seasoned breadcrumbs are, so I used ordinary ones and put in some of the Greek Spice Rub that I found here.  They were  a bit wet, but I put them on a floured plate and that helped.  They were even nicer cold the next day.  Made smaller, they would be great for a party.  The next time I will try a mix of vegs.

My boyfriend told me "THIS IS THE BEST THING YOU'VE EVER MADE!"  They were quite tasty.  Based on other people's comments, we also substituted 2 zucchini for one of the eggplants.  I tried to use one egg at first, but it wasn't holding together well enough so I added another.  I also substituted mozzarella for cheddar.  Yum!

This was an excellent recipe, even though I made a mistake.  I intended to halve the recipe, but forgot to halve the cheese.  So it was quite cheesy and delicious!  But obviously not as healthy as the original.  :-)  I did, however, just sautee the croquettes in a little oil instead of deep-frying them, so I supposed I saved on calories there.  I will definitely make these again, as my husband enjoyed them as well.

What  a great new way to use leftover eggplant! They turned out great, and they were so easy to make.

Baking the eggplant was a great idea, I also used less oil- I would reccomend using a non-stick pan if you choose to use less oil, they stuck like crazy otherwise!

This was good with added cayenne and I kept the skin on. It needed some kind of sauce though.

These were really good and a different way to have eggplant.  I served them as a sidedish with a thrown-together sauce of diced tomatoes, roasted red pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and oregano.

Delicious, mine turned out a little salty because I had salt and peppered the egg plant before putting it in the oven (for 20 mins) instead of throwing it in the microwave.  I will definitely make this again and NOT salt &  pepper eggplant before pre-cooking.  There was enough salt and pepper already in mixture with cheese, breadcrumb & egg.  Thank you for this recipe, Kelli.

Admittedly, I altered the recipe, but even what I did alter was great and a great idea in general.  I cut the cheese way down because of some lactose sensitivity and I broiled instead of fried the patties.  Paired it with a homemade sauce and some pasta and love it.  Reheats well too.

These are wonderful. The flavors are great. The only problem I have had with them is getting them to stay together while I am cooking. Sometimes they do great, sometimes I end up with a big pile of goo. But it's tasty goo!

A keeper. Good with a touch of Ranch dressing on top. Good hot or cold. I used the food processor to mash  the cooked eggplant.
