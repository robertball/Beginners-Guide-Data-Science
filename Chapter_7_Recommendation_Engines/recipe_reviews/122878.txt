This was a hit!  None left at the end of the night!  Only thing I modified was added a tad more green onions and doubled the pecans. Thank you!

This is an excellent salad! Not only are the colors festive and great for Christmas, it tastes delicious. I was skeptical about the blend of these particular ingredients, but it turned out to be a wonderful blend of complimentary flavors. I did vary slightly from the ingredients in that I used sweetened pecans, and it worked really well. This recipe is going to make it to many more family functions.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted bacon flavored soy bits for the bacon and Nayonaise (soy mayo) for the mayonnaise.  All in all, they couldn't tell the difference and I cut out a ton of fat and sodium!

This was OK, but just not truly great.  It was a lot of work with prep and chopping and I guess I wanted something more spectacular.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of doubling the dressing when I realized it wasn't covereing the broccoli florets evenly.  Don't misunderstand - I am not the 'lets smother mayo on salad' type.    There are some good kernals here though - next time, I would cut the broccoli florets pretty small - maybe thumb size, and blanch or nuke them a bit first - the dressing doesn't cover them that well.  I like savory and  the red peppers are truly sweet.  Slivered jalapeno and halving the red pepper would help.    In the original recipe the flavors seem very muted - not a lot of zing.  I'd leave out the bacon and the pecans and dress with EVOO, wine vinegar, salt and pepper.    If you like sweet and savory combined, and mild flavors, this might work.  My extended family, even the little ones, like spicy!

I made this salad for the first time this past Christmas and it was a definite hit with my family, which is comprised of individuals with quite a variety of food preferences.  The children even ate it! It is very easy to make (although it took me much longer than the estimated prep time--lots of chopping)and it has a fairly long refrigerator life; I saved some and ate it 2 or 3 days after I made it.  I also substituted fat-free mayo and no one seemed to notice...still tasted exceptionally yummy!

This was a delicious salad! I used frozen broccoli and fresh peppers. I was busy in the kitchen and forgot to add the bacon, DUH! and the nuts. I did however add a can of black olives and added caraway seeds/ garlic salt to the dressing. I Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy it and it was pretty too! Thank you Luanne

Very good salad. Loved how the flavors blend after a day or so. Ended up eating the entire thing over a weeks time. Good way to get in the veggies! :D  Thanks!

Very tasty!  I wasn't sure about all the red pepper but since it was sweet it tasted very good in the salad.  We will definitly have this again, and it isn't even Christmas!

Most people at my house preferred this over the usual broccoli salad with raisins, except for me.

I make this recipe often, but I add halved seedless grapes. It adds a touch of fruity sweetness and nutrition.

This was just ok.  It looks pretty but it is a lot of prep work.  I was surprised how tasteless it seemed to be despite having almost a pound of bacon in it.  I probably won't make again.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  It was beautiful and very Christmasy.  I made all the pieces really small, so mine didn't look at all like the picture on the post.  (Sorry I didn't take a picture.)  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added two cans of chopped water chestnuts.  I'm on a healthy eating binge, so I lightened the dressing by mixing about a quarter cup of lite mayo with enough Brianna's (no-fat) Santa Fe Blend dressing to make about 1 1/2 cups total.  I used about half of that.  The dressing has red peppers in it, so it was perfect.  Next time I think I will just use that dressing and leave out the mayo. The salad was tasty, crunchy, beautiful, and mostly (bacon)healthy!

If I was a lover of this salad I would rate it a 5 but being that I personally thought it was okay. I took it to Christmas dinner and several family members asked for the recipe. I did not bring any back so...that's five stars to me

I was very happy with this salad.  I had a load of broccoli and red peppers and was looking for a recipe to use them up and found this one.  I didn't have green onion and I used tempeh strips "fakin bacon" and it turned out really well.  My kids love this salad and I like it too even though peppers are not my favorite food.

My wife doesn't usually love to eat her veggies.  Her mother still gives her a hard time about that.  But when I made this recipe she loved them so much that she came home the next day hoping to eat the left-overs.  But I'd already finished them off.  I think I'll have to make this recipe again.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year, and it is indeed excellent.  In the future I will probably leave out the bacon so my vegetarian guests could eat it.  Easy to make as well.  I will be making this one again for sure!
