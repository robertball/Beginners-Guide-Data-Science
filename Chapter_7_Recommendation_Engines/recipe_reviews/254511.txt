Love this! I changed the recipe a bit, doubled the roux, kept the cauliflower in small chunks, instead of using a food processor. Omitted the cream cheese and used several flavors of cheeses, such as American, Swiss, Munster and.
 Cheddar. 
Loved incorporating cauliflower for a different flavor and texture.

This was really good! I was looking to incorporate some veggies into my dish and I also appreciated that it did not require baking. I doubled the veggies and blended it with the milk. I used butter instead of oil and added a cup of chopped ham. Delish!

Really yummy!  The consistency of the sauce is not smooth because of the cauliflower, but that was fine with my family.

Okay this one is hard to admit. My kids said that this tastes as good as my full fat mac and cheese. Actually... they said it was...*cringe*....creamier. The trick here is pureeing the cauliflower in the blender. I added about 3/4 of a cup of the steaming liquid to the blender. This is where the creaminess comes from. I doubled the recipe. I had to make it taste as close to mine as possible because I was trying to fool my kids. So I added a tsp. of onion powder and a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and a Tbsp of prepared yellow mustard to the cheese/cauliflower mixture. All of the dairy elements were low fat or skim. (the cream cheese was Neufchatel.) I also added extra cauliflower. (By about 2/3 of a cup) My original uses 1/2 cup of butter and 6 cups of whole milk. What an incredibly easy way to cut fat and calories. I LOVE when that happens! This is a Dish of Delish!! Thanks so much for posting the recipe!

Easy recipe to make.  We liked the tanginess of the cream cheese that came through.  We made it as called for, but did add a more milk as we were making the cheese sauce (a 1/4 Cup), and the sauce was still very thick.  Next time I may cut back a bit on the cream cheese and see if that helps create a creamier sauce. Thanks for the very good Recipe!

I tripled the recipe so I'd have extra to freeze.  Also, I like making the roux with butter so I used butter instead of oil and used 3 tbsp butter to 3 tbsp flour, then 3 cup skim milk.  The thickness of the cheese sauce was perfect.  I kept the cream cheese amount the same and the cheddar amount roughly the same but added an additional 1/2 cup Jarlsberg and increased the amount of cauliflower to adjust for the increase in sauce.  Very nice recipe, I would make again, and would probably garnish with Frank's red hot sauce prior to serving.

I can now stop searching for a mac & cheese recipe because this is the ONE!!  Even my daughter, who will only eat Kraft mac and cheese, loved this!  The only thing I did differently was added more milk to get the consistency I wanted; otherwise, it would have been way too thick.  Thanks for sharing!

When I made this dish I added way more cauliflower to the cheese sauce and I also left some florets whole and mixed them into the cheese sauce with the noodles. It was really good for breakfast with an egg on top.

Lots of times I make mac and cheese and add vegetables to it. Usually broccoli. So much better then just the same old stuff.

Even the toddler and picky 5 year old loved it! I winged it a bit since we didn't have cheddar or cream cheese, so I used havarti and Monterey jack cheeses, and cooked the cauliflower with garlic and onion. We will be trying it again this week by request following the recipe as written. I have pretty high expectations.

A little “sticky” and thick for my texture preference, but very tasty. Will probably add a little milk next time to make it more saucy. I microwaved my cauliflower then mashed it, and it came together with the macaroni easily.

Delicious. I used medium cheddar for more flavor and used 1/2 the cream cheese. So great. Thanks.
