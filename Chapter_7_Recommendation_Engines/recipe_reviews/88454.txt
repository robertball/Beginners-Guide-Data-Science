I make this a little differently now that I've experimented a little bit- I don't dip the bread into the mixture.  I brush it on with a pastry brush and only to one side. I also just sprinkle the parmesan on, it seems easier.  The flavor is great and the original recipe for the butter/ oil mix is perfect.

This turned out very buttery - too greasy for me.  I would recommend brushing the butter mixture on with a brush rather than dipping the bread directly in the butter.

Quick!  Easy!  Yummy!
Instead of rolling the bread in the cheese I just placed little piles of it on the bread.  It seemed easier and worked okay.

I don't double dip the bread - way too greasy for this old girl.  However, great flavor if I don't overdo it!

Tastes great while being very quick, cheap, and easy to make.  I made 24 slices about 3/8" thick from a 2" diameter baguette, and still had about half the butter and oil mixture leftover.  Tasted so good everyone in our family took extra slices and just dipped in sauce after they had cleaned their plates.  Highly recommended for a quick appetizer or bread to compliment any Italian dinner.

Yum, yum, yum!!  I made these to serve with the artichoke and sun dried tomato dip, but most of my guests ate these without any dip....they were that good!

What a wonderful appetizer! My guests said it was "sinful" and I'd have to agree! It has a very decadent flavor. It would also work very well as an accompaniment bread to any Italian dinner.

This is easy and delicious. I made some with the cheese and some without and both were excellent. I will definitely use this again. Served with Hot Artichoke Spinach Dip.

This is a decent starter recipe, though a little greasy. I had to remove a lot of butter from the bottom of the tray because the bottoms of the crostini weren't crisping. I also flipped them at the same time. I'd halve the butter and oil, or just brush it on instead of dipping them.

Very nice flavor. The only problem is they are greasy! Next time I will brush on the butter/oil mix instead of dipping.

Delicious! Like other reviewers, I brushed the butter/oil mixture on, and only on one side. The only other thing I did differently is that I smashed the garlic cloves and removed them after the butter melted. That way we got the essence of the garlic without it being too overpowering. Simple & yummy!

Turned out great!  I just had regular sourdough french bread on hand (rather than a baguette), but sliced thin, this still turned out fab.  In order to avoid the over-greasiness that some reviewers mentioned, I dipped a slice quickly, then immediately put it onto another, undipped slice to "soak up" extra (i.e., basically 2 slices out of one "dip").  I also didn't bother to turn them over and dip a 2nd time since once seemed like more than enough.      ALSO - since I was using an entire loaf of sourdough, I had to double the recipe, and baked only for 7:30 at 425 degrees.

This was perfect. I've been trying to figure out how to make this!  I used the pre packaged chopped garlic and only dipped one side in and was great with little bits of garlic on them. 
I didn't use cheese I served with a dip and cooked a bit longer to make them extra crisp

Gluten free baguette. Cut thin and simply brush with olive oil infused with garlic for about 6 minutes. Then top the unbroiled side with bruschetta, etc. Broil again if want warm or topping with cheese. Yum

This was a really good recipe. I didn't have parmesan so I used mozzerella, but it still tasted great, though a little greasy. I didn't have enough of the butter mixture to cover both sides of all of them and I think next time I would use a pastry brush instead, still brush it on both sides though, and only cook it for 7 minutes. As a bonus - I had a french baguette that WAS fresh but had gotten hard and this was a great way to use it up and not have to get rid of it! We had it with homemade potato leek chicken soup and my kids LOVED the crostini. I'll use this recipe again and again...

To die for.  A bit heavy on the oil so can't be a daily item, but as an occasional treat, this is fantastic.

I also, like one other reviewer, find it easier to sprinkle the parmesan on after it is on the tray rather than pressing it on before(parmesan cheese on plate gets all "goopy" after a while the way suggested). I also cut the bread up smaller - maybe 1/4 inch. However, I found the I did have to double the olive oil/butter mix to cover both sides of a large baguette sliced 1/4 inch.  I serve this up as an appetizer along with warm baked almond encrusted goat cheese (soft goat cheese with sliced almonds pressed around and then warmed in oven  until almonds lightly toasted). Guests can spread the goat cheese on the crostini. Delicious. The keg serves a similar appetizer.

My broiler doesn't go down to 425 so I had to bake for 6 minutes in 450. Do NOT go longer it will burn ! I also added two tsps of Italian herbs to the butter, olive oil and garlic because I mostly use my crostini with caprese salad and Italian soft cheeses.  I used gf baguette but that didn't seem to affect the outcome or taste,

These turned out too saturated in the butter/oil even with only dipping one side. My next batch I will follow other recommendations and use a brush to apply the butter. Flavor was good however.  I broiled for 4 minutes and all were golden brown.

This was super easy.  I made it at the last minute to use up some bread that was getting stale.  I liked that it used only basics that everyone has in their kitchen anyway, except maybe the baguette.  I will make this many times, I am sure.

Made as directed in the recipe for the second time. Both times came out delicious! Depending on your level of doneness, just keep the toast in the broiler longer. I used grated cheese the second time, and first time was with a mixture of grated and shredded. With the shredded mixture, there was a little more flavor with the crisp cheese that bubbled off the sides. Overall- a winner!

I had always baked my crostini but felt like I should warn guests not to break a tooth!  I tried this recipe and now my crostini is beautiful golden and tender.  But I agree with another reviewer;  I brush the mixture on with a pastry brush.  Also, don't take your eye off of them when they're in the oven.

This is a great fast way to make crostini.  I usually bake them with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Then after baking, douse them with more olive oil and rub the garlic cloves over top.  But this way was a lot easier.  These did take longer than 8 minutes to bake and get crispy and I also just dusted them with the parmesan once removing from the oven.  Overall it was a very easy way to make them and I served with spinach artichoke dip.  Thank You!

I didn't put any cheese or garlic on it because I was pairing it with a spicy crab dip. Just brushed the tops with the olive oil, butter, a brief shake of seasoning salt and fresh cracked pepper.  I actually saw people taking a few extra of these by themselves to munch on. So, maybe half the dip was gone and all of these pups.  Should have made more.

These were quick, easy and a big hit at Christmas.  I added some flavor to the butter with rosemary from my garden.

What a fun and special name for garlic-parmesan bread. As expected, this was a winner. Thanks.
