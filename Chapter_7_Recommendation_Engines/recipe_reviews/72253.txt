This was some SERIOUSLY tasty ham & beans!!  I made it twice and the first time was a bit bland so the second time I took some other reviewers suggestions and used chicken broth instead of water (I used 2 cans) and put in 2 bay leaves.  It was HEAVENLY.  I couldn't get enough.  I used a small turkey ham to cut back on cals/fat and it was delish.  YUMMO!

As suggested by other reviewers, I jazzed mine up a bit, for fear of it being too bland.  I added 7 cups of water, 3 medium sized ham hocks, along with the 2 cups cubed ham, 2 bay leaves, 1 Tbsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 4 chicken bouillon cubes, and the leaves from the celery.  I let it cook on high in my crock pot for 10 hours.  I wished I could have let it cook on low for 18 hours or so as some reviewers suggested, but I just didn’t have the time.  Luckily, I didn’t matter!  Yummy!  (Only a little salty – next time I’ll add only 1 tsp of salt with the ham hocks)  It went great with some Jiffy cornbread, and passed the boyfriend test with flying colors!  (He said it was BETTER than mom used to make!)  I’m giving the recipe 3 stars due to the lack of spices. However the reviewers get 5 stars because I don’t think it would have been nearly as good without their recommendations.  Overall it averages out at four stars.

I did not soak the beans at all, just rinsed them and then put them in the crock-pot and they turned out soft and creamy. I did take the suggestions from other reviewers and added 2 bay leaves to the pot and I added about a teaspoon of salt but I think it could have used even more.I was afraid of over-salting since I used 2 ham steaks for the ham and those tend to be salty. Next time I try this I think I might try substituting chicken broth for the water for a little extra flavor. Overall a good recipe.

I have been married for almost forty years and I am still a lousy cook.  I'm good with machines, though.  This recipe was seriously delicious and easy enough for a recipe challenged person like me. I followed the recipe, but used variations suggested by others.  I used one of those container thingies of chicken broth, one teaspoon of pepper and two bay leaves.  Where have you been all my married life, Grandma B?? So good and so easy.

My family loved this soup! I used small white beans with 7 cups water. I added 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper. I kept it on high for 2 hours and on low for 8 1/2 hours. I will definitely make this again with only one change.  I will use 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tsp of pepper.

Fantastic!  This was the first time I made ham & bean soup - was a little hesitant at first by the looks of it but it turned out great & my boyfriend loved it too.  I used great northern beans,eliminated the carrots & cut up everything the night before (except for potatoes) & put it all in my slow cooker in the morning (except for potatoes)with 7 cups water.  I added 2 bay leaves & salt/pepper.  At noon I cut up (3) potatoes, boiled for about 5 minutes then added to soup.  I kept it on high all day & turned down to low the last couple hours.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup was fantastic!  The only thing I did different was to substitute chicken broth instead of the water.  (My husband doesn't like sage, so that addition would be a personal choice.)  We had two meals from it (the two of us); I sent my mom a jar (she loved it also); and my husband took the remainder to work where there have been numerous recipe requests.  He is a fireman and if they gave it a "thumbs up"--you know it's good!

A great tasting soup plus it is super easy.  I cooked mine about 14 hours in the crock pot to get the beans really soft and the soup thick.  I thought about adding a ham hock but didn't, deciding it would only add more fat. The flavor of the soup was great without it.  I did add a few teaspoons of ham soup base.

Very good bean soup! I used a left-over ham bone and added a can of chicken broth and two extra bay leaves. Next time, I'll use a few extra potatoes as they give the soup an extra-nice touch.
Until now, my bean soup has been mediocre at best...thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good comfort food and I served it over cornbread (the store mixes). I followed others advice and added 1 tbsp of pepper and 1 tsp salt and two bay leaves. I actually did this only 1.5 hours before it was ready b/c I tasted it and thought it was bland, and then read the suggestions. It turned out tasty, but alil thick. Next time I will add 7 C of water like some previous suggestions.

I love you, Renee and your Grandma B! This recipe is an awesome base for my tweaking and I will be making this again in the not-too-distant future. For those out there who found the soup too greasy, salty or bland, here are some tips to help you along the way.
1)Don't use a ham hock, which tends to be too salty. Use a bone-in ham steak.
2)Sautee your ham to draw out those yummy juices and sugars.
3)Sautee your mirepoix in E.V.O.O., seasoning salt and Mrs. Dash.
4)Use 4C broth, 4C water and add a wee bit more salt and Mrs. Dash
5)Ham bone and 2 bay leaves in soup. VERY integral.
I hope these tips are useful. Drop me a line if they are...bon appetit!!

I used chicken broth instead of water like some of the others recommended. Hubby said it was good, it was a little different than we were use to.  I would make again, but leaving the potatoes out.

I have a family of four and wanted to make a double batch so I could freeze half so I doubled this recipe and put half in the crockpot and half in my heavy pot. It came out MUCH better in the pot. I even ended up transferring the crockpot batch to the pot to get it to   a creamy consistency. With half the double batch we were able to eat twice and have some leftovers still.

I used 1 quart of chicken stock total, so about 2 cups in each batch. Then I covered with water and added 1 bouillon cube to each batch. I also added one bay leaf to each and 1 tsp. salt & pepper to each.

I bought a pack of ham hocks after reading some reviews. It came with 4 in there, I used 2 in each. This was big mistake. It came out WAY to greasy ( and I think the flavor was probably to much also). Next time I am just going to use ham pieces like the author originally intended ;)

The only other changes I made was that I used half navy beans and half great northern (that's what I had). I still ended up cooking the soup all day because I have yet to eat a soup that does not taste better being simmered for several hours.

I thought the taste was good but I will give another review when I have tried it with ham pieces.

Very good soup.  Used others suggestions to add flavor.  Cooked on low for 18 hrs.  Pureed 2 cups of the mixture and added back in to thicken it up.  Very easy recipe.  Thanks!

I love this one. I subbed half of the water with chicken broth as recommended by others and I also added a ham hock. I season mine with parsley flakes, garlic salt, and pepper, all to taste. Maybe a teaspoon of each? I never measure. I add in bay leaves as well (2-3). Fantastic comfort food. Serve with fresh warmed french bread and butter. MMMmmm. Great comfort food dish. I've made it also with pinto beans which is also very tasty, but admittedly, those cause more, um, well issues! lol Enjoy this dish! I have made it many times. My family loves it.

Solid recipe.  I knew plain water would disappoint but instead of using cans of broth like other reviewers, I just threw in some chicken bouillon powder.  This is a good recipe.  I had never used navy beans before.

After hours of cooking, I used an immersion blender to blend a lot of it which makes it creamier.  But I did this before adding the ham.

I had an extra red pepper lying around so I chopped it and threw it in.  I think it made a nice color and flavor contrast.

Really good!

This was a hit.  Cheap, easy and makes alot. My crock pot was filled to the top.  Should be served with warm crusty bread for dunking!  I will definitely add this to my soup rotation this winter. I used ham shanks instead of chopped ham.  They cost around $1 and add more flavor to the soup.  Plus you do get a little bit of meat to shred into the soup.  I don't want potatoes in my bean soup so I omitted them but added a clove of minced garlic and some worcestershire sauce (saw that in another recipe).  It did need a little salt which I added at the end of the cooking time after tasting the soup.

Excellent and easy! I quick cooked the beans and threw everything in the crock pot. I also used homemade chicken stock instead of water and it only needed a little salt at the end.

Overall I was very pleased with this recipe, although the first time I made it I took some users advice to add chicken broth instead of water, and I found mine entirely too salty, even with the broth watered down!  I'd recommend to wait and see if it needs any additional seasoning first.

This was a great recipe to use for the bag of Bean Soup Mix I had. I am trying to incorporate more beans in our diets to cut back on the red meat in our diets and this was a pleasant change. I pretty much followed the recipe as written but incorporated a few more things that I had on hand.... Instead of diced tomatoes as others had suggested I put in the remaining part of tomatoe sauce that I had in jar in refrigerator. I also added some Sazon, Sofrito, Ham seasoning, I used chicken broth also.. and about 1- 2 cups chopped turkey ham and of course the potatoes. I served with my homemade cornbread and viola dinner! It was a great hit my husband loved it. However I did not cook in crock pot I cooked in a big soup pot all day..... I made Sat and today is MOnday and there isn't even enough left to freeze!!! This is a great recipe for me as I love Soups!! Thanx for Sharing Grandma B!

I don't know which is better -- this excellent soup or the AROMA of this soup cooking. In my version, I used Great Northern and lima beans, added more of the specified vegetables (except the potato which I left out), used chicken stock as the cooking broth (not soaking) added garlic, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, and a can of partially drained diced tomatoes. Also, I simmered mine on the stovetop; done in about 3-4 hours.

This soup is really good. I cooked mine a little longer (about 3 hours) than instructed, added some extra salt & pepper, a couple teaspoons of minced garlic and a couple of bay leaves. It was fabulous. My 8 year-old son loved it.

Wonderful taste and very easy!  I added a ham hock and more salt based on the other reviews.  I also added sliced carrots instead of shredded.  We served over cornbread.  This was a big hit in my house.  It turned out very creamy.  Wonderful dish for a cold night!

Made it for the 2nd time. Used 1 lb of mixed beans again instead of navy beans and this time I steamed a cottage roll and used the ham broth and cubed cottage roll meat Result was fabulous.

Beautifully simplistic recipe.  I will make this again.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was a touch too bland for me.  Next time, I will try adding something to spice it up just a little bit.

Not bad.  I did jazz it up by adding bullion cubes (4--I added a lot more water!), bay leaves, dried minced garlic, and pepper--partly bc I had turkey instead of ham.  I didn't have potatoes but it was fine without, and I cooked it for a long time as others had suggested (18-20 hours).  The only thing in the soup a little worse for wear was the turkey, so I'd suggest adding that later if you use turkey; the ham would probably be just fine.   This was a very nice weeknight meal for when I didn't want to cook--told bf my dinner plan was soup and salad.  He made the salad, I made this soup, and voila!  Dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the suggestion to add 2 bay leaves and 1/2 Tablespoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. I also didn't soak the beans over night. I did just for an hour and then rinsed and added the ingredients. I also used 4 cups of ham broth from when I cooked the ham. Ooooooh so delicious!

I found this soup to be very bland, I added chicken boullion and then later added a ham hock to let it cook another several hours to add flavor.

this was delicious!  I can't wait to make it again.  I did take some recommendations from other users and added salt, pepper, bay leaves and chicken stock.  I didn't have ham and used a smoked sausage instead with great success.  So comforting and satisfying!

This is an excellent recipe. The only change I made was to add a ham shank instead of the cooked ham. It added a smokey flavor that was out of this world. I made the recipe a couple of days ago, and I'm still amazed...

Excellent BUT....This will be very bland soup without some help.  I made with chicken stock vs water and I added per reviews: bay leaves, salt,pepper, garlic, liquid smoke and thyme and it was still pretty bland.  So I put in about a pound of ham slice with bone and cooked another 4 hours or so in the slow cooker. Now ya got something! Better yet the next day and thereafter of course.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought there were too many beans.  Next time I'd cut the amount of beans in half.  The soup had a nice flavor in the end.

This was great! I was so pleasantly surprised. I've never had bean soup that I liked before, but my boyfriend asked me to make it for him sometime. I made a couple of changes (added a bay leaf and garlic, left out the potatoes), and it was delicious.

I had a bag of mixed beans to use, and this recipe worked great.  I did put a little chicken boullion in it, as well as a ham hock for a little more flavor after reading  some of the reviews, I also like a little ditalini pasta... Very good soup!

I've made this three times and really like my latest version.  For the beans, I do a hot soak (boil for 5 minutes), soak first overnight then rinse every 6 hours over the next 24 hours or so.  I use two quarts chicken stock, 2 bay leaves, 1 tsp rosemary,  3 tablespoons Knorr chicken bullion, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp salt, and 2 tsp spiracha chili sauce for a little kick.  I then cook in the crock pot low for 18 hours.  It turns out a wonderful balance of flavors and seems even better after freezing for lunch at work.  Admittedly, the elapsed prep time is a little long, but good things await those with patience.  For those using a nutrition counter, 1 serving is 2 cups, the whole batch turns out to be about 16 cups the way I make it.

As suggested by other reviewers I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water and bay leaves. Omitted the potatoes. Added seasonings--salt, pepper, garlic salt and about a TBSP of brown sugar--at the end so as not to toughen the beans during cooking. The brown sugar gave it that subtle sweet/smoky flavor that I associate with ham and bean soup. I also cooked the beans with a ham bone from a leftover spiral ham and added the cubed ham after about 8 hours on low to retain the ham's flavor. Delicious with warm cornbread! A great basic bean soup starter recipe!--Susan C.

We really enjoyed this soup.  I eliminated the potatoes (didn't want the extra starch).  I used some turkey gravy in place of some of the plain water and as I had no ham, I included a chopped up Oktoberfest sausage and turkey. I didn't add any of the herbs or spices others referred to. Maybe the gravy gave it the taste it needed. Nevertheless, this is a very forgiving recipe.  It cooked in the crock pot for about 8-9hrs. Served with fresh baked rolls. I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks to the poster - this was a really nice meal. And very INexpensive.

I made this last night.  Actually started it the night before at bedtime.  My family ate every bit that was served including the kids.  That is a definite plus.  However, if I make this again it will be with a few changes.  I used a small smoked ham equaling the amount requested which I think next time, I will add more.  I also added two chicken bouillon cubes and 2 small bay leaves only because my first thought after reading the ingredients was "where are the spices?"  I set it all night and let it cook through the day on low.  When I came home, I mashed some of the beans and potatoes to make it more creamy.  The result was better but everyone agreed that more ham would have enhanced the flavor.  Not sure if I'll make again....maybe.

This recipe is fantastic! Have made this several times never disappoints....I use chicken broth instead of water and use 1 packet of Goya pork flavor gives that nice smoked ham flavor. Thank you so much for a recipe that is easy and my family loves.

My very finicky 5 year old has repeated all evening, "Mommy! This is my favorite soup in the whole world!" He even wanted more after dessert. So I gotta give it a 5. I didn't have any ham, so used a slab of salt pork and a little bacon fat. However, I know that the ham would've made it much more flavorful. But kids love simple foods and this is a good healthy dinner. We served with a little bell pepper corn bread.

I had some leftover ham from Christmas and decided to try this recipe. We loved, loved, loved this. I used canned navy beans instead of waiting to soak and soften navy beans and also omitted the celery since I do not like celery in soups that much. I also added a bit of flake salt, fresh ground pepper and 2 bay leaves.
The flavor was just amazing and my husband told me that this was one of the best soups that I have ever made and we have been married for 32 years and I cook a lot! I did put everything in a crock pot and let it simmer for about 6 1/2 hours. Yummy!!!  Make sure you add the bay leaves it really vamps up the taste. Oops, forgot to mention that I also used vegetable broth instead of plain water. Great soup will be making this one again!!

Delish! I have been adding 2 cans chicken broth & 2 bay leaves every time, and also garlic powder when I remember. (We make this at least once every 6 weeks- more in the cold months.)

Cooked for 12 hours (but not necessary). Came out like stew: thick and hearty. Used cooked/shredded smoked turkey and chopped turkey bacon instead of pork. Added about half chicken broth/water. Added fresh minced garlic. Seasoned w/ salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, ginger powder to taste. Be careful with cinnamon and ginger. Want smooth and savory, not bitter or spicy.

With the changes that other reviewers suggested, this would be a 5+.  I halved the recipe using 3.5 cups chicken broth, 1/2 teaspoon smoke flavoring, 2 bay leaves, a little salt & pepper, and two cloves of smashed garlic.  I also subbed three green onions for what would have been the half of a regular onion for my half recipe, and it turned out beautifully.  Thank you for a great starter recipe!!

Very good.  I did use chicken broth, garlic, 2 bay leaves and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning to add flavor.  I simmered it all day in the crock pot on low then finished it up on the stove to thicken it up a little.

I add chicken bouillon to make it more flavorful, 3 cubes for the whole recipe.   But this is a great recipe!  Just like my grandmother in-laws, but I gave it four stars because it's just so much soup.  It filled my 6 quart slow cooker!  And after about 8 hours of cooking it started to get mushy.  So my suggestion would be to spit the recipe in half and personally I don't want my beans and potatoes to be mush so 6-8 hours in the slow cooker is plenty long enough.

This recipe was fantastic.  I had to add chicken broth, garlic and oregano to punch up the flavor, but it turned out great.  It made a ton and the entire house smelled yummy when we got home.  Put this with some crusty bread and it's an entire meal.

I wish I had a bigger crock pot--it was filled to the brim.  I used a large can of chicken broth instead of water.  Very good.  I'll use any leftovers to make baked beans. Thanks for the great recipe and suggestions!

This was the best bean soup that I have had in a long time!  I did alter it a bit, I didn't use carrots or celery because my kids won't eat it if they see carrots.  I used another's suggestion of the 2 cans of chicken broth and instead of onions, I used 2 TBSP. of minced onions.  It still gave the flavor, without the chunks of onion... kids won't eat it if there are onions!  They LOVED it!!!  I had so much that I took some to my neighbor and they said it was the best bean soup that they have had in a long time.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this again!!!

This is absolutely fantastic.  Made this for the 2nd time yesterday and it is definitely in the winter soup rotation. Based on others suggestions, I used a 1 quart box of Chicken Broth instead of the water, add a couple of bay leaves, salt/pepper, and a couple dashes of Liquid Smoke.  Tastes even better the next day, and the next day.

I have made some excellent bean soups in the past but this is by far the best bean soup I have ever made. I used 7 cups of chicken broth and a clove of garlic, as another reviewer had stated.  I also added a ham bone plus the cubed ham and used 4 oz of tomato sauce toward the end of cooking. 
Some had stated this was as good as Campbell's soup, but I would venture to say it is far tastier.

Growing up my mother always made soup or chili in the crock pot on Halloween and I've carried on the tradition ever since.  I made this last year and we all loved it.  I was a little leery about shredding the carrots and dicing all the rest of the vegetables.  I was always taught to cut large chunks for the crock pot.  I follow the directions as written and was glad I did.  I will make this again this year for Halloween and can't wait!!

Oh my goodness is this delicious! This soup really tastes like good ole' fashioned home-cooking! I was looking for a recipe that would be as good as some ham and bean soup that I had at a Sunday church lunch, and this is definitely as good if not better. I've made quite a few recipes off this site and this is my favorite so far for ease and taste. I did make a few recommended modifications: bay leaves, plenty of salt and pepper, chicken broth, and a partially cooked ham steak (my own idea; pan-fried and put pan juices and the little bone in the pot for flavor).

Instead of long soaking of the beans: I rinsed, covered with water and brought to a boil(after soaking, rinse twice). As a other members recommended, I also added bay leaves and also chicken broth in place of the water. I used sliced baby carrots instead of shredded and lots of chopped, fresh flat leaf parsley and salt/freshly cracked pepper to taste. It was so good, I ate almost the entire batch myself in week's time!

Good soup!  I followed the recommendations of the other reviewers (broth and bay leaves). Since I cooked it a LONG time, it got very thick so I added about 4 more cups of broth.  My husband likes stews so this was great for him.

I actually found this soup bitter.  Maybe it was the beans.  I did add quite a bit of salt and pepper to try and make it taste better.  Was very close to Mom's but didn't leave me with the same comfort food feeling.

An easy recipe! My first time cooking bean soup/and using dry beans  as well!

My family really liked this recipe.  It was really tasty with a crumbled up corn muffin mixed in- Yum!  I added a couple of bay leaves and some salt and pepper as was suggested in other reviews.  I also, for time's sake, finished it up on the stove top.

A definite keeper!

I took souper saras’ advice and added 4 chicken bouillon cubes  ( or 4 tsp Chicken granules). I think that fact alone gave a bland soup a terrific flavor.I added 3 poor quality ham hocks that were all fat and bone. If you can find a good quality ham hock that might contrubute to a better flavor. My wife wouldn’t let me add milk  to the batch like grandmother used to so I added milk to my bowl and kicked up the flavor another notch for my taste.

It was easy, and a good base, but I found it bland. The bay leaves suggested did help a bit, but perhaps next time I'll add some peppers, or use chicken stock like another poster suggested.

My husband loves bean soup and this is the first time I was able to make it to his liking. With the leftovers  I strained the liquid (saved for future use) and cooked down the beans until thick for burritos adding your favorite ingredients.

I feel like I had to make too many changes to this recipe to make it good.  As written, it was very, very bland.  I added both the diced ham and a smoked ham hock during cooking, used chicken broth instead of water, and added bay leaves, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of tomato puree at the end.  I would not recommend shredding the carrots as they kind of melt into the soup and disappear during the long cook time, next time I would dice them.

This turned out great!  My alterations: I didn’t use water but 2 containers of chicken stock (64 oz total) and a bunch of thyme.  When it was finished I blended half of it to give it a creamier texture.  Yum!

Best bean soup I ever made.  Other than adding a ham bone, I used ingredients exactly as presented.  
Only slight change I made was to cover beans with water, boil for 2 minutes and rest for 1 hour before draining and adding to the slow cooker.  
Flavor was unbeatable, I will use this recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing!

I have been making navy beans and ham for many years.  This was absolutely the best I have ever made.  Added maybe a cup of chicken broth because I had it left and two bay leaves.  Did not have any celery.  Used my ham bone from Christmas which still had a lot of ham on it.  Cooked 10 hours total. So good!  My son asked for the recipe!

We enjoyed this soup. I used left over Christmas ham. I felt there was way too much carrot, so I would recommend cutting down to 1-2 carrots. I replaced water with chicken broth and added two bay leaves. Mine needed more salt, probably depends on how salty your ham is. Served with warm buttery corn muffins. Nice winter dish, thank you.

We loved this recipe.  I did leave out the potatoes because I didn't want to add extra starch, although my hubby said they would probably be good.  I also added 2 bay leaves, a small amount of salt and about 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  We will make again!

I've made this a couple times. The first time exactly as directed. The second time I used bacon instead of ham. I fried the bacon to a crisp, then removed from the pan. I sautéed the onion, carrots and  celery in bacon grease before adding to the slow cooker. I also added salt and pepper.

Really delicious! I soaked the beans overnight with a 1/4 tsp of soda and it alleviated the bloating and gas that beans usually cause me. I add a 1/2 cup of white wine in the last hour of cooking,which really enhanced the flavors.

I used the broth (instead of water)  from a slow cooker cottage roll I made and used two cups of the cottage roll ham leftovers in this bean soup.  OMG yummy.  My family loves this and now we made a slow cooker cottage roll approx. every 6 weeks just so I can make this soup.  I cook it for about 13- 14 hrs; putting it in slow cooker the night before and I just leave it till I get home from work the next day.  My slow cooker is programmed to keep it warming once the required cook time is reached so it's usually in the slow cooker for about 16 hours -18 hrs but about 6 hrs it's just on warm.   It's delish and the ham is even more tender.

Great soup but best to tweek a little.
I used 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken stock.
I also added a small can of diced tomatoes.
After seeing that the soup was too salty for us, I added two potatoes diced to absorb the salt.
I added chopped ham in addition to ham from ham hock.
The longer you cook it the better it is.

This was tasty. I made changes according to other reviews, and used some chicken broth and some water. I also used a large ham hock. I threw the veggies in only 3 hrs before it was done cooking (because of time constraints and, well, kids...), along with a bay leaf, and they were still nicely tender. At the end, I shredded the ham and used an immersion blender to mash some of the beans to add texture.

I followed the recipe, but definitely did my own thing in addition, Next time I'll use less beans because the next morning, the "soup" turned into a pot of beans thanks to the absorption. I found lamb neck bones and browned those with the miricroix (sp) and used 32oz of chicken stock and water. The bacon fat didn't stand a chance with the aggressive flavor of the lamb, so next time I'll just use the lamb because it was delicious with the beans.

This dish is great, family loves it!  As others suggested, I added chicken stock in place of some water, added bay leaves, and black and red pepper to spice it up.  And, used diced ham steak with bone.  My 19 year old son adds shredded cheese to his, and says it takes a "great" meal to "fantastic!"  

Some reviewers have commented about the beans coming out very mushy.  Please note, beans have different cooking times, so can't necessarily be substituted without considering this and adjusting cooking time.  For example, great northern beans take much less time to cook than navy beans.  So, if you only have a few hours to cook this dish, great northern might be the way to go.  However, if you are going to cook in crockpot all day and don't want mush, navy beans will work much better.

I cooked it on the stovetop rather than the crockpot, as I was short on time, and this worked out well.  I'd soaked the beans overnight.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf along with the onion, celery and carrots.  I used 1 qt of chicken broth, and the rest water.  I added some of the ham at the beginning, and more to taste at the end, along with plenty of salt and black pepper.  I also added a bit of white cooking wine, some chopped parsley, and an all purpose seasoning called Spike.  Delicious, as modified.

I doubled this as I had a HUGE ham bone left over from Christmas dinner, and I left out the potatoes since I used them all for the big meal. :)  Doubt I would need them as a thickener as the beans cooked up so smooth and so creamy that each mouthful is just dreamily delicious.  The only things I added was bay leaves and a bundle of fresh thyme, sage and rosemary, all of which I removed at the end of cooking.  No chicken broth as I thought the taste would be unnoticeable and, therefore, a waste of money.  Tomatoes might have been good a good addition and were included in other similar recipes on this site, but I didn't have any on hand and I think they would have made for a very different soup.  I used lots of fresh cracked pepper, but no salt as the ham contributed its share.  I soaked the beans over night and then cooked on the stove top at a very low flame for about 6 hours - stirring every half hour or so.  I could have used a slow cooker, but it had just gone back into the appliance closet after its duty keeping the mashed potatoes warm on Christmas day, and I was feeling a bit lazy. OK, I saved a 10 foot walk, but I but I really hate washing pots and pans by hand.  So I just cooked the beans in the same pot in which they soaked.  But when all is said and done, this was the best bean soup I have ever eaten much less made myself.  Since it made such a lot, I froze a significant portion and will report back on how it freezes and reheats.

I made a lot of changes.  Omitted the ham and did not used dried beans.  Lightly sauteed the carrot, celery, one potato, one Knorr chicken boullion cube and onion, then added one can of bean with bacon soup with two cans of water.  Let this cook up a bit and then blended with a hand blender until 3/4 smooth.  After blending, added one can of drained navy beans.  Delicious.

Added a chicken boullion cube, two bay leaves, 1 tsp salt, and subbed a little pan-fried procciutto and de-skinned and chunked pork bratwurst. Pureed about 2-3 cups of the soup (all but the meat bits). Served with biscuits. Delish!

Delicious and sooooo easy. Definitely add bay leaves and other seasonings to punch it up, but that's one of the nice things. You can season it to suit yourself!! I cooked it for 12 hours and it was creamy and delicious.

This is a very basic and bland recipe that results in quite a bit of soup.  I added a few things for personal flavor like 6 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp chili powder.  The final touch was one 12oz bottle of Dundee Honey Lager beer.  Much, much better with something for your taste buds to savor.

I have been making this for a while now and with the modifications others have suggested, it makes it awesome. Chicken broth or stock makes it super flavorful along with bay leaf. I even like it with some minced garlic and basil every once in a while-and it does get better the longer it cooks, so start this one out late at night or early in the morning. Thanks GB!

This was delicious!  I have been looking for more recipes using beans for the sake of saving money and getting protein without eating a ton of meat.  Very easy to make and is great for lunches for work.

Very disapointed in this recipe. Love to come home to a crock pot of dinner, especially when I am coming down with a cold. Soaked great northern beans over night, followed recipe except added a about 2 tbs. of chicken base. Cooked on low all day, was not home to turn it from high to low. Came home so excited and it was blah, beans were almost gone, they were very mushy. No flavor what so ever, maybe it was the ham. Carrots and potatoes were also too mushy. Cooked it for 8 hours. It needed lots of salt and pepper to make it edible. Husband did not care for it either. The good rolls I bought to go with it ended up being most of our dinner. I will make my regular stove top recipe next time we want ham and bean soup.

Well, I used the rest of a spiral ham and it was way too salty.  I used chicken broth as some suggested. I don't know if that contributed to the saltiness or not.  I think I used too much ham.  I'll try it again next time with different ham.

Fixed this last night it was very good but the beans were almost all gone by the time they were done cooking.  I did use the chicken broth and a little water.  But very good will make again but maybe with more beans.

This was my first attempt at making bean soup.  I took the advice of others and substituted 8 cups of chicken broth for the water, added one large clove of garlic (chopped), 2 bay leaves and a spiral ham bone with ham on it.  I cooked it on the stove for 8 hours. It was delicious.

This is fantastic! Let it cook, cook, cook and it really does get much better! I use a sweet onion and skip the celery because we don't care for it.

I cooked this according to the directions with some of the minor revisions suggested by others. Was very disappointed. It came out more like a thick stew. Not as flavorful as I hoped. Sorry, won't make again.

Excellent!  Did spruce it up a little with some bacon, chicken broth (instead of water), seasoned salt and pepper.  It was perfect for a cold, rainy Sunday night.

We loved this soup!!  The recipe was simple but provided a very tasty meal.  Following other reader's suggestions, I did add 2 cans of chicken broth instead of just water for the cooking.  I also added more ham.  Made for a happy family on a cold night!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I gave this a 2 star because there was a lot of tweaking that needed to be done.  I used home made chicken stock and 1 bay leaf,ham hock, alt n pepper,  a heaping tblsp of minced garlic, cooked it for 7 hrs one day and then the next morning I cooked it for an additional 11 hrs.  Half way through day two of cooking it still didn't taste all that great.  So I cooked up some salt pork in a frying pan till the pieces were crisp and added them along with 1 tb spoon of the drippings.  I also added about 1 c of chopped zucchini because I have so much zucchini this year.  I pureed about 4 c. of the soup to make it creamy.  My 7 year old loved it. Served it with corn bread from this site.

I cut the recipe for this soup down to 4 servings and used great northern beans instead.  I also added half a small white onion, used chicken broth instead of water and added a small can of low sodium V8 and 3 pieces turkey bacon and a bay leaf.  This is one of the best soups I've ever made...the broth is just brilliant.  I'd recommend it to anyone, especially doctored up.  For me the original recipe would be way too bland.  Try it!

I did not care for this, it was easy and a very nice looking dish but I would not fix it again. To be fair I think it was the flavor of my leftover ham that was the taste I did not like. But I like my beans in a thick gravy over rice better than in this soup.

Good soup!  After soaking the beans overnight, I poured about a quart of ham stock over it instead of water.  I cooked the soup overnight (8hrs.) and the vegetables were not too soft.  Needed salt to taste.

Took 2 days to cook in my cheap crock pot, but the soup was great. I made it all organic and it was worth the extra cost.
