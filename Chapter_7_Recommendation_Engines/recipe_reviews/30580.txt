Most authentic recipe I have come across (my mom is from thailand and makes the best beef salad or in thai "yum nua") but I agree, too much fish sauce. She uses 2 limes and about 4-5 tbsp of fish sauce. No sugar and use yellow onions. Don't mix the cucumbers in, serve them on the side. We usually eat this with sticky jasmine rice and our hands. Also, if you can manage roasted (raw) sticky rice that has been ground in a coffee grinder adds wonderful nutty flavor and texture (but beware, it will  make you cough and sputter when you make it). It helps to slice the beef as thinly as possible. But over all, not bad but can be made better!

I found this salad way too salty.  Also, with so much lime juice and a full cup of fish sauce, the salad was more like a soup!  I might try to make this again with the same ingredients, but I will definitely alter the proportions.

Way too watery. 4Tbsp fish sauce and 4 Tbsp lime is just the right amount.  I'm lo carb so I substituted sugar for 2 packets of Splenda. Also, I served mine over butter lettuce and added thinly sliced red bell pepper. Yum!!

Not bad I served it on a bed of lettuce,
Remember always use THAI fish sauce its not as salty, if its not processed in Thailand its going to be on the salty side. Refined sugar will cut the salt taste too.

1cup of fish sauce and the amount asked for the limb juice is way off for me. Like said... it was more like a soup but I tried it the second time with 4 tablespoons of fish sauce and 4 tablespoons of lime juice and a tablespoon of sugar was perfect and 5 stars. It was a big hit at my dinner party. 1 cup of fish sauce is waaaayyy to salty :)

Be careful how much fish sauce you use!!!  Using a whole cup is way too much.  I'll also say that I like fish but apparently fish sauce is not a good flavor for me.  Personally, I thought it smelled like low tide.  I won't be making this again.

I love Thai salad. but I always serve lettuce with the cucumber and white onion any,I also put fresh cilantro over it, other veggies if you like tomatoe, bell pepper with your hot meat and dressing over it along with hot white rice. I use half lime and half fish sauce with how many peppers you want.  Drizzle a litte dressing over rice.  Serve the salad over the rice.  Its good

My fiancee and I make a meal that is similar to this one. We definitly do not add the one cup of fish sauce, we add about 4 1/2 tbsp and the same with the lime juice. We add in some green onion, cilantro, and chili flakes and cook the steak MEDUIM RARE. The dish isn't supposed to be "soupy" but there should be liquid left over. The steak should be cut along the grain and it will soak up some of the juice. We like to eat this dish with rice and then pour some of the liquid from the salad on our rice...the rice helps tone done any saltiness and just goes really well with the dish....

This is an amazing salad. I did read the reviews and I thought that 1 cup of fish sauce would be way too much, so I only used 1 cup. I also added tomatoes and chopped cilantro. I used a couple of serrano chiles so my husband would be able to tolerate this heat wise. I'll be making this recipe again, thanks!

I'm Thai. We normally use fishsauce equally to lime juice (this is the formula!)

I made this last night and I have to say I was the only one who liked it of the family.  That said, it was just the way I like it, salty!  I actually used a 1.75lb piece of flank steak from Whole Foods.  I then used half of all the other ingredients including the fish sauce.  You could use a sugar substitute for South Beach.  I used a Thai garlic chili pepper sauce instead of the chilis - using a few splashes instead.  I normally hate changing recipes and then reviewing them, preferring to review on the actual recipe but I can see this being a winner.  I am choosing 4 rather than 5 stars as I think 1 cup fish sauce is extreme.

I have to give this 5 stars based on the original recipe and some suggestions from another reviewer who's mom was from Thailand.  I used a small yellow onion, 3-4 tspns or so of Fish Sauce, serrano peppers (2), and some Sarracha for my sauce.  This is the only dish i will eat at Thai resturaunts and it seems that once I get hooked they change the recipe on me and it gets sweet.  This dish should be sour and salty with a great mix of these crisp veggies and thinly sliced steak.  All I can say is thank you for saving me $12.95, I will never purchase this dish again unless I am in Thailand.  I am 4 mos pregnant and I will just say this will be eaten for the duration of my pregnancy unless I get sick of it :)

A bit too fishy, tasted and adjusted by omitting all but a TINY bit of fish sauce.

I agree on the fish sauce being too much.
I used 1/3 cup fish sauce and 1/3 cup lime juice and that was perfect. Very easy and tasty recipe without too many ingredients!

It put me in the right direction as far as the ingredients and the dressing. Like the other reviewers 1 cup fish sauce is way too much. I did the 4 limes and maybe an 1/8 cup of the fish sauce just to taste. 

I would probably use a tenderloin the next time making this as well. Ribeyes when they are cooled tend to be tougher while a tenderloin will always just fall apart.
