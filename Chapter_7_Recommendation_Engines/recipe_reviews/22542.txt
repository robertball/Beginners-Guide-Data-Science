This is a great appetizer and so easy to make.  I made a couple of adjustments.  I added garlic, onion powder and green olives w/pimentos.  I took this to our xmas party & it was gone in no time & received lots of compliments.  Thank you.

This is very similar to my mother in law's recipe, although she uses worchestershire instead of hot sauce.  It's soooo good!  I usually have to make two at parties because it goes so fast.

I make this with dried beef (that comes in a jar) and it is great.Very low priced cheese ball yet loaded with flavor and super easy.I mix with a fork rather than a mixer.If concerned about salt, rinse and dry the beef prior to chopping as the beef in the jar is salty.

My niece turned me on to this cheese ball and I've been making it ever since.  She makes it using Buddig pastrami chopped finely and rolled in chopped pecans.  It helps by coating the outside so you can shape it better, plus it looks pretty.

Such great flavor!  I always add extra roast beef.  I also add onion powder and celery salt which compliments it greatly!  Never any left.

I added 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, a total of 6 green onions and 3/4 tsp hot pepper sauce.  Delicious!
