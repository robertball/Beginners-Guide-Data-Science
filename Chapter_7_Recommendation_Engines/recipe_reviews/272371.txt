I’ve made this a few times now, a family HIT! A great way, on a weekly basis, to keep using the sourdough starter fresh and functioning. Muffins come out of the oven looking exactly like store bought... but better. They break in half nicely with just thumbs. You can swap 1/8  or 1/4 of the flour for whole wheat without altering anything else and the recipe will hold up fine.

This is a good and so mole recipe.  I followed it to the letter for this first time.  I’ve used other AR recipes for sourdough English muffins.  They work well too.  This one yields good “books and crannies” and toasts up nicely.  I had trouble working with sticky dough, but left it on the sticky side (rather than adding too much flour). They came out great.
