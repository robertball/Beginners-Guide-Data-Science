Hummmmmmmy...By far, the best grilled fish recipe I've ever had! I forgot to marinade the fish (used freshly caught grouper), so I made sure we kept basting the fish every few minutes on the grill. We placed the kabobs on top of a grilling plate and I'm glad we did - a few pieces would fall off every time we rotated them on the grill. I also added whole mushrooms to the recipe - thought this was a must! We had guests over that aren't big fish eaters and they devoured these...make sure to have atleast 3 kabobs per person! This is now my #1 fish recipe and will definitely try it with other fish and chicken.

This was pretty good.  I used frozen tuna instead of fresh, and substituted 3/4 tsp. ground ginger for fresh...the flavors all worked well together.  Next time i may try the "fresher" ingredients.

Very good.  I was worried that the onion wouldn't be cooked, so I used canned pearl onions, which worked well.  I will definitely make this again, although next time I will marinate longer, I didn't think the marinade imparted much of its flavor in only 30 minutes. Even so, I was very happy with the results.

Yummy.  I was lazy and fried it up in my wok as a stir-fry.  Added water chestnuts and sliced bell pepper and served over rice.  Won't know if leftovers reheat well because Hubby and kids devoured it.

I would give this more stars if I could!  WOW!  We are from Miami and liken this to our favorite dish at our very favorite seafood restaurant- Captain's Tavern.  We made this with grilled (frozen) yellowtail (from a catch 2 weeks ago) and served with reduced marinade on top of the fish.  We accompanied it with black beans and rice (just like our favorite restaurant) and- voila!- we had one of the most GOURMET meals we've ever made at home!  Definitely impressive enough to serve to any VIP guest!  No joke.  My husband was blown away- as was I.  A+++!

Such a fantastic marinade!  I used yellow fin tuna steak chunks with orange bell pepper, red onion, and pineapple.

This was pretty tasty. I made this as a stir fry, adding broccoli, and used the marinade as a sauce. I had to do a chicken version for my husband as he doesn't eat salmon, and he thought it was good too.

This was so good. We had this with fresh salmon for supper 1 evening last week. We will have it again tonight. The only thing I did different was to thicken it with arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch, and my part had bell pepper instead of onion.

I made this for dinner last night and this was AMAZING!! I made some changes to suit my taste:  I used organic portabello mushrooms, purple onions (as the recipe calls for) and pineapple chunks for skewers, in addition to the salmon.
I seasoned my salmon lightly with sea salt and a little garlic old bay seasoning for seafood (not the traditional old bay seasoning).  I also lightly seasoned my mushrooms with garlic powder and sea salt.
The sauce was ok, but for my taste it was not sweet enough, so I added a little honey and a little brown sugar, and WALLAH, the most amazing sauce presented itself! J
I also bypassed the marinating piece, since it took a while to chop all the vegetables, make the sauce, etc. 
Instead, I spooned the sauce on each kabob, and placed the kabobs under the boiler, turning once, when the first side was lightly browned.
I almost forgot, I also simmered the pineapples chunks in the sauce and used these pineapples for the kabobs; it only took a minute or two for the pineapples to cool down to handle.
I served with organic Basmati rice and broccoli. It was so amazingly good, I can't wait for dinner tonight! :)

P.S. I made about a little over two pounds of salmon; doubled the ingredients and used three portobello mushrooms, and used two cans of pineapple chunks for the juice and chunks!  This made about 15 kabobs in total.
