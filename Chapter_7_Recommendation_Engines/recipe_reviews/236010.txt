I've recently moved to Florida where Key Limes are abundant and I have fallen in love with the flavor. This was an incredibly easy recipe to make - my favorite kind - however I did make one change. My limes were very small and two lacked the flavor I was looking for so I added the juice from two more. I served this as a dessert at a dinner party and received raves with everyone wanting the recipe. Next time I'm going to add some cracker crumbs to the mix and serve in puff pastry cups. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy way to get a key lime pie fix!  Very good and very simple.
