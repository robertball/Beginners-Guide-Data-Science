We really like these fajitas!  The best part was with a couple of shortcuts, (bag of frozen peppers and onions, pre-cooked shrimp), this recipe only took me about 15 minutes to prepare! I had some leftover brown rice, so I added that for a little more substance. I tried a little with shredded colby-jack and some sour cream and they were even better!  I'm so happy to have another healthy,(minus cheese and sour cream), easy dinner option!

This was really good and really easy, and that makes it a winner in my book.  I mixed my raw shrimp with about 1/4 cup of cilantro and the juice of 1 lime and let it marinate while I cut and cooked the vegetables.  Then prepared it exactly as directed.  I served it with whole wheat tortillas, spanish rice and chips and salsa.  Hy hubby loved it!  Definitely one to make again.

Hey, what do you know...the WHOLE family found something they liked.  It was easy to make and very quick.  I used McCormick's Fajita seasoning packet.

Good basic recipe. I added 1 tsp. cumin and 1/4 tsp ground coriander (this spice goes really well with spicy seafood in my mind). Also, I threw in the zest of one lime and then the lime's juice to make it a little zestier. Loved it with guacamole.

My local Mexican restaurant makes me a special shrimp & rice dish (they discontinued it, but still make it for a long time customer :) I never knew it would be so easy to re-create at home! Who knew it was just taco seasoning and a few other ingredients! I will be DEFINITELY making this one again. Sorry "LaSenorita's", this IS as good . :)

very good, especially since shrimp aren't too expensive here in Mexico, so we have them a lot. Instead of packaged taco seasoning however, I make my own fajita seasoning according to a recipe from my housekeeper: 1 t corn starch, 2 t chili powder (again I make my own), 1 t salt, 1 t Spanish Paprika, 1 t sugar, 1 t powdered chicken stock, 1 t onion powder, 1 t granulated garlic, 1/4 t cayenne ( or to taste), 1/2 - 1  t powdered cumin. I keep this on hand and use when needed. 
Also used the tip from another review and let raw shrimp marinate a bit with chopped cilantro and a little lime juice (not too long or you have ceviche, which can be good, but just not here)

They were okay. Would not make them again. Not enough flavor in the sauce. Shrimp should definitely be marinated first.

This is a tasty recipe.  I will use less taco seasoning next time and will reduce the amount in half.  I will also use a seaoning mix that is mild as the medium was too spicy for hubby.

This was sooo good. I did add some garlic. I think that next time I will use the smaller shrimp and not as many vegies in the mix. The whole family loved this.

These turned out better than expected.  The only modification I did was i changed the water to 2 tbs water and 1 tbs lime juice.  I also used the leftovers to make a salad the following evening, and it turned out great as a leftover.

Also, to make it gluten-free, I used corn tortillas.

I thought this was a quick, easy meal.  I marinated my shrimp in lime juice and zest and didn't use the whole faijita seasioning packet.  I might use individual seasonings next time rather than the packet.

I made this for dinner tonight since I had nothing thawed and some cooked shrimp in my freezer.  It was simple and pretty good.   I did sprinkle cheese on top and would have added sour cream and guacamole if I had them.   I had to make my own taco seasoning and so I spiced it up a bit with cayenne...

Delicious!  We are really into shrimp fajitas/tacos right now so this was perfect for us!  I made "Chipotle Mayo Relish" from this site to go with.  We loved them!  Thanks!

Were it not for the packaged taco seasoning and an overload of it to boot, this would easily have been a 5-star recipe.  Make your own taco seasoning  - there are some good recipes for that on this site.  This time I used Healthier Taco Seasoning I. Add it simply to taste; in my case that meant far less than the recipe called for.  Five stars.

I was looking for a tasty Quick meal with the shrimp I had thawed.  This hit the spot.  I didnt have the peppers so I used a tomato and the onion.  I pt the tomato in when I put in the shrimp.  They cooked too quick next time I'll put them in when the shrimp are almost done.  I recomend this to anyone looking for a quick tasty meal.

This was, as stated, quick and easy. It was also beautiful. You can add still more color and yet another later of flavor, by using spinach tortillas...oh and for adding tang...lemon or lime juice instead of water. ;o)

Good! I used a yellow bell pepper instead of red just because that's what I had on hand. I used fajita seasoning because I had a packet that had been hanging out in my cupboard for months, but next time will try using taco seasoning. I served it in tortillas with Cucumber Salsa (AR recipe). Thanks! :)

I used fajita seasonings and sliced the onions to match the peppers. We topped the fajitas with cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. Served with spanish rice. Very good!

I added cayenne pepper to give it a kick and next time we'll be adding mushrooms & japalenos (seeded, of course).   The shrimp ended up being overly done; I'm wondering if it needs to simmer with the vegetables instead of cooking it then simmering it.   I would mix the seasoning with water (if that is possible)...I feel like parts of it ended up having concentrated taco seasonings despite the fact that I stirred, flipped & mixed it in.   Overall, we enjoyed it. We enjoyed spicy food so the cayenne was a good compliment!!!

The title of this recipe says it all:  SUPER quick and easy!!  We loved this recipe.  I used most of the taco seasoning and I didn't think the taste was too overpowering at all.   I diced up a few tomatoes and added a dollop of light sour cream to the shrimp mixture in my tortilla.  But other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It was so delicious and healthy for you.  (Well, less the sour cream, I suppose!)  Try this recipe - - you will not be disappointed.

Marinade your shrimp with taco seasoning, fresh lime and olive oil. Otherwise it will be bland. I also made a salad of shredded cabbage, cilantro and lime to use in shrimp tacos.

This recipe is so delicious.  My husband keeps requesting this and it is so easy to make.  Love the flavor and the aroma while cooking.  I used my cast iron skillet to brown evenly.  This is a dinner favorite. This is our new addiction.  Thank you.

I actually skippd the taco seasoning...marinated the shrimp in crushed garlic and lime juice with chili powder. I cooked the peppers and onions then added the shrimp to the mix to cook until pink.  I served with store bought pico de gallo - a mix of tomato, onion, jalapenos and cilantro.  It was PERFECT!

Definitely quick and easy for a hot summer night.  Used less taco seasoning.  Next time will add some chopped avocado, or guacamole.  Hubby added more spice (as always).

We're not a big pepper fan family so we eliminated those.  A sprinkle of crumbled feta is absolutely phenomenal in these! Heck - they're even good enough to stand on their own.
Another "tip" is to use cleaned/frozen shrimp - cooked or uncooked and cut the tails off while frozen.  Makes it so much easier.

A nice change of pace from the traditional chicken fajitas.  I did marinate the shrimp for about an hour in lime juice and garlic.  I also added a little of the taco seasoning and chopped garic to the green peppers and onions while they were cooking.  Like previous reviews I didn't use all of the taco seasoning( probably a little more than half)  I used Old El Paso. Everyone liked them and will probably make again.  I topped them with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.

I've made this twice now, once with taco seasoning and once with fajita seasoning.  Both times, it's turned out delicious!  I agree you don't need the entire seasoning packet... but I've added cumin, corriander, & lime juice!  Also, I serve it with mexican rice so you don't have to use the tortilla for an even leaner meal.

They were pretty good, and a nice way to get some fresh veggies into dinner... I think there was way too much seasoning though, as the shrimp just got covered and was completely overwhelmed. I also never have had shrimp in a fajita before, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it... I will probably end up making this again, with *much* less seasoning on the shrimp!

This was delicious! I did marinate my shrimp beforehand in a tequila-lime-garlic marinade.  I used two red bell peppers and a purple onion (both on-hand). I also made my own taco seasoning using a recipe from this site.  They were so good!  Hubby had seconds!

My favorite quick and easy recipe! If you use pre-cooked shrimp, it takes minutes! But I usually use raw shrimp bc I like the texture better and think it cooks in the flavor more. Also, you can use a variety of toppings, changing it up for picky eaters. The ONLY modification I make is to add garlic powder to the seasoning. DELISH!!!!

This was awesome. Try placing some of the Fajita mixture on top of a bed of spinach leaves. Awesome salad.

This was quick and easy to make. I like taco seasoning enough (and it made it so much easier to do), but in the future I would probably make a lighter seasoning to enhance the flavor of the shrimp. But if you want quick and easy and tasty, this is the way to go.

I give it a five star cuz I mixed it up a bit!! I made it the same as the recipe said for the filling but I used the fried taco recipe for the shell (tortilla) and added chopped spring mix lettuce and cheese and came out incredible!! Love the idea of the fried tortillas! Not to crispy and not to soft! U gotta try it!!!

Awesome is the only way to describe this recipe.  Easy, quick with a sophisticated taste.  Followed the recipe for the most part, except these minor changes.  Used Fajita packet seasoning instead of taco (as that is all I had on hand), added hot pepper flakes while frying the peppers and onions & 1/2 cup of fresh rough chopped cilantro.  Served it with Mexican rice & beans.  OMG it was so yummy.  It is great recipe as I always have frozen peeled shrimp, Fajita seasoning, peppers and onions on hand.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all.

These were good, but felt they needed something.  I can't decide what.  I think I will try the cucumber salsa that another person mentioned and/or fresh tomato.

Exactly the recipe I needed!  Simple, flavorful and fast!  I didn't use the peppers because Hubby doesn't eat them, so I used mushrooms instead.  He loved it!  Thank you so much!

I wanted to make something new for dinner besides the same old spaghetti or hamburger helper. I had chicken and tortillas and this recipe came up with the ingredient search. So glad it did! It was a hit and my husband ate almost the whole batch and I almost didn't get to have any! He said it was amazing and the best thing I have made for a while haha!

My husband loved it. Said it was better than the restaurante's fajitas. I didn't have bell peppers so I just did onion sliced up. I sautéed the onions in olive oil and then was too lazy to take them out (and my husband likes them really caramelized anyhow). So I just put shrimp in their with them. It was so easy and we served it in corn tortillas cause that's what we like! We used Lawry's taco seasoning too cause it is by far the best!

Not bad. For a quick and satisfying meal, this hit the spot. My days are long, so I appreciate filling meals that can be prepared in a short amount of time. Having said this, I do think I prefer a more basic (i.e. garlic & lime) treatment for my shrimp. While I enjoyed this, I am not sure I'd ever pair taco seasoning with shrimp again. Mexican rice, chips, guacamole and margaritas completed our easy weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing your idea, Anne! :-)

Recipe was quick but not as delicious as i thought. Recipe was a little bland and not flavorful. What i did was add a little cumin and coriander like someone suggested and it gave a little bit more flavor to the shrimp. 

Thanks for the recipe nontheless!

Very tasty!!! The only two things I did differently was sauteed the veggies and added the shrimp to them; I did not take veggies out of the skillet and then cook shrimp. I also added garlic powder.  Try this at least once, you will not regret it.

Have had this a couple of times now & need to try something different because using the package of taco seasoning mix leaves it grainy tasting. Either we need to add the taco mix earlier or add more liquid to simmer longer, haven't decided which I'll do. Only other solution would be to use our other fajita recipe & use the shrimp in it because I know that isn't grainy tasting.

Way too much taco seasoning.  Should have done 1/2 package.  I wiped off the sauce with paper towels and made another fajita.  Husband thought it was ok but not great.

This was very yummy!  I made it for a get-together with some friends and they ate every last bit!  I live overseas where I can't run to Wal-Mart and buy taco seasoning, but I do have quite a bit of Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning that I brought with me.  I think I might try it with that next time instead of th taco seasoning!

Like the other reviews recommended, I cut the ingredients by half and used frozen cooked shrimp for convenience. With only a half of seasoning packet I felt it made plenty of sauce and the shrimp had plenty flavor, no marinating needed. Thanks for sharing, will def make this again!

These are excellent!  I definitely agree that cumin, corriander and lime juice should be added for that extra flavor.

These were pretty good, definitely quick and easy.  I only used 1/2 packet of taco seasoning.  We topped the fajitas off with sour cream and shredded cheddar.  I think I like chicken and beef fajitas better, but these are a nice alternative.

I used this recipe last night and it was really good.  I only used half a package of McKormicks Taco seasoning and added some garlic and pepper to taste.  I also added a little sour cream and taco sauce to the fajita and it turned out really good.  I made the spanish rice on the side but ended up saving it for tonight to go with Broiled tilapia.

I used half of the shrimp and taco seasoning and I found this worked well. It was still a little salty. Overall a delicious recipe that I will be using again.

Thanks.  This was excellent!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and sprinkled lemon when the dish was done.

I used a few things I had on hand which turned out GREAT. I had cooked shrimp that I chopped. I added the juice of 1 lime and a package of taco seasoning. I let that 'marinate' while I sliced up 1/2 a yellow pepper, 1/2 a orange pepper and 1/3 onion. I mashed up 1 avocado and added a little garlic salt to that. Chopped cilantro, shredded pepper jack and fresh salsa were all used to top a doubled corn tortilla. My family died and went to heaven... Thanks for amazing recipe to get me going with what I had on hand. YUM

These were okay...but not WOW.  I used pre-cooked shrimp, and hubby liked it.  My son refused to eat it, but I think that was just the shrimp, not the taste.
