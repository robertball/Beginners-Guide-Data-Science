Not too difficult to make the dough, but these taste terrible and are insanely delicate which makes it hard to put the jam on and not worth it when you do. I even doubled the vanilla and they were still totally flavorless.

SLOPPY RECIPE!. there was a MISSED STEP! when you make shortbread, you must refridgerate the dough before rolling, or it simply won't roll  out well.

further, 1/8'' is unreasonable for shortbread. 1/4'' is normal. 

1/8 teaspoon of salt  is needed too.

i made it, because it was just normal shortbread, and it was ok, doing it my way. 

i hope people read my comments before they are scared off shortbread.

This recipe was great!  The shortbread was super delicate tasting but held together well.  I'll definitely use this one again.  Used two types of jam (strawberry and orange marmalade - its all I had on hand). And I sprinkled a little sparkling sugar on the tops.
