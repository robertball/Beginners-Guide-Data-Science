This salad's simplicity allows the fresh vegetables to be the star.  The recipe didn't say what type vinegar to use, so I used white balsamic and added some fresh dill which always partners well with green beans.  I steamed the green beans for 2 mins and 20 seconds in the micro on high which left them perfectly crisp.   This was a welcome change for a nice side salad with dinner.  This didn't knock-my-socks-off, but I did enjoy it.

This is really good, with a little tweak.  Well, that is, if you are like me, you need to add a bit of stevia or sweetener-of-choice in order to enjoy it.  Then, let the concoction marinate for a bit (like overnight - but not necessarily that long - depends on your taste and/or how strong the radishes are).  Lutzflact's choice to add dill made a lot of sense to me, as does adding some black olives:  those ingredients were in another radish recipe I have learned to love (with added sweetener):  matchstick celery, radish slices, minced onion, dill, S&P, and... that bit of sugar.  Yum!

I am rating this according to the original recipe, which I did not care for. Just as others have said in their reviews this was lacking the flavoring of the vinegar when made as stated. I then tried adding an extra tablespoon of vinegar but still found it a little on the bland side. I then began by just sprinkling small amounts of vinegar on, tossing, then tasting until I had the right flavouring. I didn't want to put a full tablespoon on each time as I feared that would end up being too much. Ultimately I ended up loving this salad but I wasn't going to rate it that way. The rating is to be for the recipe as written, not for how it gets fixed up, and I wish people would rate things accordingly and stop rating how well their food tastes once they get done playing with the recipe!

I made it but with amendments. Added just fresh squeezed lemon juice. French style green beans. Then I added precooked lentils. For other flavor used a yogurt ranch dip.

This is a keeper - the colors are bright, the taste is mild. I may add a few green onions on top of the salad for additional flavor next time. Then again I may just leave it as is.

I've been trying to make different side dishes this summer that aren't our usual norm.  At first, my adult son was apprehensive but when I asked if he liked, HE LOVED IT and wants it again.  The only change I made was the fact I didn't use oil & vinegar but a regular salad dressing.

This was a pretty and crunchy salad, but the dressing didn't add much flavor.  It needs more vinegar, maybe a white or red wine vinegar, and some herbs to spruce it up.

A nice, pretty, simple salad.  Didn't have radishes, so I subbed red bell pepper.  Also added a tiny bit of sesame oil and teaspoon of sesame seeds.  Next time I'll do it exactly per the recipe with the radishes, but maybe add something for a kick.  Thanks for posting.

If I make this again I will definitely add more vinegar and oil. It was not enough and needed more flavor.
