I made the recipe just as called for and it was pretty good.  I think next time I might mix some of the sauce in with the meat before I stuff the peppers because I am a huge tomato sauce lover - and I think it would help to tie the flavors of the dish together better.  Overall a good recipe - my husband loved it.  I served it with fresh garlic bread.

This was very very good- and very simple too!  It is almost fool-proof.  I tried this and was unsure how it would turn out since I had never done stuffed peppers without rice before.  It was hit though- I did add garlic and basil to the sausage when it was cooking.  I also cooked the peppers as specified, but then added cheese to the top and let them broil for 1 minute for a cheesy top.  The left over's tasted great for lunch the next day too!

I tried this recipe tonight and really enjoyed it.  I used ground beef instead of sausage and sprinkled all the cheese on top instead of mixing it in.  It was nice to not have to cook the peppers ahead of time....

I cook on top of the stove in a covered pan, increase the sauce to about 3 cups simmer on med for about 35-45 min.  This is a better method for the hotter months when you don't want to turn the oven on.  Check often to make sure the pepper bottoms aren't burning.

Extremely easy to make.  Leaves a delicious aroma too lol.  I used a Creamy Spinach sauce instead of Prego. Still delicious.

OMG!! How good is this!! I love this recipe! I've recently gone off grains, but love, and I mean love stuffed peppers. Since I no longer eat rice, I decided to search and try to find a recipe without. Man am I glad I did! I modified somewhat, but I don't think it detracts from the original recipe as submitted. I used half breakfast sausage, half lean hamburger, because I didn't have enough of either. Also didn't have the Prego sauce, so I made my own Italian sauce with homemade tomato sauce and spices. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Anybody who likes stuffed peppers, will L.O.V.E. this recipe. Give it a try...you won't regret it. AMAZING!

This is the first time I've made Stuffed Peppers, and this recipe is very quick and easy.  I used all the ingredients it asked for and it came out perfect.  Only with one, I added a little crushed pepper flakes, because I like mine a little spicey.

I LOVE this quick and easy recipe!!

This recipe was great, but I changed a few things about it. I did not use any oil, I used hot sauage, and added some spicey Busch's beans to the mix to make it a little more healthy and filling. I don't like regular stuffed green peppers but these were excellent!

Made this for overly critical in-laws and it's now a new favorite.  They were impressed.  I don't follow recipes well, though, I added ricotta cheese, and some diced tomatoes to the mix and it turned out really awesome!  Thanks a ton!

Made it as the recipe directed, however, after reading some of the reviews, I took half of the Prego and half of the Mozzarella using it in the meat mixture and the other half on top of the peppers. Great recipe! Definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe. The only thing I changed was, I added garlic when cooking the sausage and added a little sauce to the meat as well. Will surely make again. Thank you.

We used red peppers instead of green and I didn't have sausage so I used ground beef.  The flavor was great but I would have made more filling for the peppers to fill them further.  I also added more cheese on top bc my family loves cheese.

Very good and very easy to make! The only change I made was that I used red bell peppers because my husband prefers them. It was delicious!

My husband loved this recipe-however, I used a mix of country sausage and mild italian sausage. I also used my own spaghetti sauce.  Everyone loved it, my daughter who hates sausage wants me to try it with hot italian sausage next time!
