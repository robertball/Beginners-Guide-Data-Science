I made 4 different batches of truffles for a work potluck and these were one of the best.  Everyone was so surprised how much they tasted like hot chocolate.  I found the dough to be very soft and sticky so I added some additonal wafer crumbs and that did the trick.  I dipped them in vanilla candy quick and sprinkled the tops with coarse gold sugar.
