Made these for my kids and they LOVED THEM!!!! kids are the harshest critics. These are delish! They taste better when baked until the edges get a little crispy and they are completely cooled.

These are my new favorite cupcakes! My kids LOVE them. They are super moist and fudgey. I make them with a buttercream vanilla frosting. I personally like them with black beans instead of chickpeas and I add 1 tsp of instant coffee for extra richness. Delicious!!!!

Thanks for the recipe! My family enjoyed them hot out of the oven but I prefer them frozen...We eat a lot of chick peas in our family so this was just another way to cook/bake with them! Didn't taste the chick peas at all. I shared with other friends and they were a hit as well - and they are not chick pea fans.
I made the recipe as is.

Was pleasantly surprised how well these turned considering it was my first try at any type of flourless muffin.  The recipe states 20 minutes but it needed over 40 to be done.  But it is light and tastes like coconut flavoured brownie.  My kids loved them.

Even two guys who don't like coconut approved! I would suggest removing the skins from as many garbanzos as you can, for a smoother texture, but even if you don't it's still a nice, dense chocolatey cupcake. I found they took 40 minutes to cook through. Vanilla buttercream with a little shredded coconut is amazing with this recipe.

Loved these. The only thing I changed was to decrease the sugar to a 1/4 cup and they were sweet enough for me. Topped them off with Sugar Free Frosting.

Absolutely delicious. Who would ever know these were made with garbanzo beans. I made exactly as written. Frosted with vanilla buttercream frosting recipe I found on this site. Enjoy!

I am so surprised at how good these taste. I could never get my family to eat chickpeas.. ..ever!! They were begging for more. I made mini muffins and baked them for 10 minutes. They did have a slight coconut taste but the kids did not notice. Definitely will make these again.

These are my no-guilt, good-for-me dessert and they are the BEST!  Soooo easy, and (since I omit the unnecessary sweetener/sugar) healthy as a protein source!  They freeze like a dream, and the basic mix (eggs and beans) freezes as well, so I can get a head start on batch #2 and only have to clean the blender once.

First time making these. The only change I made was to use vegan egg substitute. They turned out so delicious. Very moist.

Really good. Can't believe its chickpeas. I only wish it was low calorie, but I guess you can't have it all. Still delicious nonetheless.

My kids and husband loved them!  My husband was wary about them but then he tasted one and wanted more.  My picky eater couldn't tell there were any "awful" chickpeas in it and wanted more.  I will definitely make them again.  I used gluten free Guittard Semi Sweet chips.

Absolutely love these!  I used Kirkland (Costco) 51% Cacao Semi-sweet Chips and would add an extra 1/4 cup of them and substitute the sugar with honey the next time.  I also added an extra dash of Vanilla (Because I always add extra vanilla when baking).  Even the kids will eat them!   Delicious!!!

Wow! These are superb!  I did remove the chickpea skins (not sure if it's really necessary) and I microwaved the chocolate/oil stirring every 30-45 sec to melt rather than use a double boiler.  I will definitely be sharing these with my celiac friend!!  Recipe made 15 beautiful looking cupcakes.

Delicious! As suggested by a reviewer, I took the time to remove the skins from the chickpeas. Beyond that, whipped up in no time. Was surprised at how smooth and moist they were. Will definitely be making these again! (Great to keep frozen for when you have gluten-intolerant guests!)

How many grams (or ounces) would 1 1/2 cup choc chips be? I use block chocolate in recipies instead of choc chips because of the less sugar. Thank you! Looking forward to trying them!

Absolutely delicious! Perfectly moist on the inside and you'd never know that they had chickpeas in them. Not at all dry and i followed the recipe exact not altering anything!!! definitely recommend. Oh just make sure your baking soda doesn't contain wheat starch or any sort of wheat which would counter act the fact these are gluten free! :)

These are delicious! My son was just diagnosed w celiac disease and I was searching for a gf cupcake. This hits the spot. He doesn't even like chick peas! Plus, it's super easy to make. Only downfall: the coconut oil is a bit too strong a flavor for us. Next time, I'll use olive oil. Otherwise, I would change nothing! I used homemade buttercream icing to top them.

I was looking for a gluten, grain-free recipe for a sweet treat.  This was easy to make and you'd never know about the garbanzo beans.  I baked for 25 minutes so the edges would be crispy.  They taste quite a bit like a brownie.  I might add some walnuts or pecans next time.

glad to have found a healthier cupcake recipe! i was skeptical about baking with garbanzo beans but honestly, the texture is pretty much the same and they came out fairly moist. i would just add a bit more sugar and chocolate according to your own taste.

I made these at Christmas time for my gluten free son and girlfriend. They loved them. Although I do have to say, after they sat for a few hours they didn't look as pretty, but still tasted good.

Pretty awesome! You could not tell there were chickpeas in here at all.  I did add more chocolate, but I like my cupcakes very cocoa-heavy. Ate some the next day for breakfast and didn't feel bad ab

This turned out dry, although that's possibly because I usd unsweetened cacao nibs and added just a tad more sugar.  I will make again and experiment with ways to make it less dry.

AMAZING.  Just amazing.  I can't even believe how good these are, and that they are really pretty healthy for you!  I topped these with the Paleo Chocolate Frosting from this website and they were devoured.  I used dark chocolate and more coconut oil than butter.  My 2 yr old loved them.  I'm going to make a huge batch to freeze so he can have chocolate for breakfast!

Made as is and wouldnt change a thing. Perfectly moist and chewy..just delicious! I let my friends try them (they normally shy away from 'gluten free' and they begged for more :) Will be making again very soon - might add some macadamias next time just to mix it up!

Best ever!  Have made them twice now and can't stop eating them.
My husband had no clue they are made with chickpeas. He asked me to make them again.

This is a really great recipe for using no flour and dairy.  Plus the beans made it healthier for you.  Mine turned out perfect,  I did use veggie oil,  since I didn't have coconut on hand.
