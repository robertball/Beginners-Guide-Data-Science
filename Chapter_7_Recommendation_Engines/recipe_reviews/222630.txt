I followed the recipe exact. I got 12 biggish muffins out of one recipe, baked at 350*, they were done at just over 22 minutes. Not impressed with this muffin recipe. These turned out super spongy with a sticky exterior with not a whole lot of flavor. For me, this really was a waste of ingredients. NOTE: I'm not a novice muffin baker, so I really don't know what happened other than too much liquid?

I was a little disappointed with these because they didn't have a lot of lemon flavor so I would recommend adding some lemon zest if you have it.  I did not add the almonds because I didn't have them, but the muffins were still pretty good.  They were moist and had a good amount of cranberries.

Excellent! I made the large size muffins, and baked them 25 minutes. I used dried cranberries, and let them sit in very hot water for 1/2 hour before adding them to plump them up. The result was a perfect muffin, which browned nicely, was very moist without being sticky, and a delicious muffin. Thanks for posting!

Tasted GREAT - not Dry.  Dryness is the result of over mixing and/or over-baking.  TIP: Since there is no butter in this recipe, I recommend using the paper/foil baking cups in a muffin  pan as mine stuck a little bit (i used butter to grease pan) and about 4 of my tops got pulled off while removing them from pan (even after cooling for 5 minutes in the pan).  RECIPE Modifications: I was out of lemon juice so I had to sour the milk with some freshly squeezed lime and (mandarin) orange juice because thats all I had on hand!!  I used Craisins instead of fresh cranberry - the OceanSpray website said you don't need to soak them - they are ready to use and the substitute is 3/4 cup of craisins for every 1 cup of fresh cranberries.  I skipped the almonds because I didn't have any on hand (seeing a trend?  we just moved 1000 miles away so our kitchen is thin right now) - so I just filled the cups with batter and popped them in the oven. BAKING NOTE: Even at 400* this recipe took longer than 18-20 minutes for me (i do not live in CO); toothpicks came out battery at 18 minutes. I rotated the pan at this point to even out the browning of the top edges, then I added about 7 minutes of bake time plus I let then sit in the oven for about 5 minutes after I shut it off. OVERALL, very easy, very tasty - just plan for the extra time to bake!  Enjoy!

These are very yummy.  I used orange instead of lemon and left out the almonds because my daughter doesn't like almonds.  They are very good and both of my children are eating them as I type.

Well, I did alter this recipe, so if that annoys you stop reading.  I reduced sugar to 1 cup.  I decided to add half a clementine that I lightly pureed in my food processor to the batter.  Since I did this, I reduced the milk/lemon juice mixture just a tad.  Used the same clementine to made a tangerine sugar to top the muffins with.  I zested it into turbinado sugar, mixed well, let sit for a bit, then topped muffins with it before baking.  These are fabulous muffins.  Light and fluffy!  (I found they only needed about 15-16 minutes- so watch your baking times).

I absolutely love these muffins! Probably one of my favorites that I've ever made! I followed the recipe with two exceptions; I added lemon zest and a bit of orange zest and juice (orange lemon cranberry muffins.. mmmmmm) and I added a tiny bit of almond extract (because I didn't have any almonds and because I add almond extract to EVERYTHING!!)! I know people get annoyed when users change the recipe but I feel I didn't change anything, I just ENHANCED it! And these are delicious!! Even my picky eater lemon hating boyfriend ate one!!! If anything at all, I reccomend at least adding the lemon zest which will take care of the "lack of lemon flavor"!! Delicious!!!!

These were perfect! Added the lemon zest (about a tsp) as suggested, and baked for 20-22 minutes (for a dozen, full cups). Fluffy, sweet, tart. Exactly what I was looking for! I didn't add any almonds on top, because I didn't have any, but I have a bunch of cranberries left over, so I will be making these again! And again!
Thanks!

I hesitate to rate this recipe because I changed a lot of things!  First I used whole wheat flour (not whole grain); only used 1 cup sugar; 1/2 cup lemon juice, 1/2 cup soy milk, and coconut instead of nuts.  Also - I prefer butter to oil so I used butter - creamed the butter, sugar, eggs, added wet ingredients, then added the dry ingredients.  They turned out great though!

I modified the recipe to make it a bit healthier.  Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup of regular flour plus a half cup of applesauce. It made 20 muffins and it needed less baking time, about 17 minutes. Not too lemony, but still moist.

Perhaps it is a texture preference, but they were way too "doughy" for our liking with no taste of lemon at all.  For the people who said your muffins burnt, I would suggest you use light coloured baking ware. (Especially if you are trying to bake at 400 degrees!)   Dark coloured tins and cookie sheets get hotter faster and burn things.  The lighter the tin, the longer you can cook without burning.    I would also highly suggest, if you try these muffins, you will want to put a crumble on top.  They really need "something" to boost the flavour and texture.

These went over very well for breakfasts this week. The lemon flavor was not too strong, which was perfect for us. Very easy and inexpensive to make, and they taste much better than making muffins from a box. I did use craisins instead of fresh cranberries, and since I don't like nuts in baked goods I left out the almonds. Great flavor! Thank you for the recipe, bobpiazza!

These muffins turned out well. They taste nice and light (most likely because butter is not added). My muffins also browned in the oven which gave them a nice crunchy texture on the muffin top. 

The modifications I made included adding zest of the one lemon I squeezed juice from and using dried cranberries as opposed to fresh. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup because the cranberries add a sweetness to the muffins. I did not add the almonds.

Added lemon zest and may add a little more when I make them next as we prefer additional lemon flavor.  Loved by all in our family :)

This is a legit recipe.  Follow the directions exactly and youll end up with great muffins.  I took the advice of others and added zest from one lemon which added great flavor.  I sprinkled a little bit of sugar on the top of each muffin before baking them. They were done after 18 minutes in the oven.  Dont overmix the batter, use a spatula and add liquids to your flour mixture gently by hand.  If using craisens, re-hydrate by boiling 1/2c juice or water, take off heat, soak 3/4c craisens for a half hour.

Very tasty & moist. Made about 20 smaller (not mini) muffins. Used 1/4 cup batter in each muffin slot of pan. Followed the recipe but added 1 tsp. lemon zest & decreased sugar to 1 cup. Baked for 18 minutes on 400 degrees. Turned out perfect. If no toothpicks to test doneness, use a piece of uncooked spegetti.

I dont respond to many of the recipes posted.  If they make it to my recipe box, I liked them.  This is the second recipe I have to respond about.  Holy  these are amazing muffins!!!  I read the reviews before making them and decided to add an additional 2 teaspoons of pure lemon extract since I like lemon flavour to stand out.  I didn't use the almonds because we don't like them very much.  They were moist, huge, and delicious.  Thank you for this winning recipe.

These were good, but I am not sure how some said they needed to bake longer!  At 18 min the bottoms were starting to burn! I bake a lot, so I know my oven, but will not bake these at 400 next time, perhaps 350-375. I used slightly less sugar, doubled the batch and only used 2c, could taste all the flavors nicely!

Delicious! I added 2 tablespoons of lemon zest as others had suggested and it gave the muffins a nice subtle background flavor. I also added 1/4 cup of shredded coconut which is a nice touch of chewiness to the muffins. The muffins remained rather pale although they were thoroughly cooked. Next time I plan to increase oven to 420F. Will make these again.

I followed directions exactly. The muffins came out looking perfect; however, the flavor is a bit odd. Not very lemony. I'm not sure what exactly went wrong.

They are tasty muffins! I used oat milk instead of cow’s milk. I added only 1 cup of sugar, and the zest and juice of one full lemon and sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on the top of each muffin before baking. I also used frozen cranberries so I didn’t cut them in half. They turned out great!

These muffins were not impressive at all. They had little to no flavor and it took for ever to slice the cranberries. The only reason why I gave this three stars instead of one is because:
1). It was edible (though it wasn’t very tasty). The muffins were only sweet with the slight bitterness of the cranberry.
2). The texture and look of the muffins were excellent, but I think it is because I frothed my eggs first. The recipe did not specify in doing that, but I knew that frothing the eggs would maybe prevent sponginess. 
I squeezed a real lemon instead of using lemon extract and also added lemon zest. I know lemon extract is a little stronger, so maybe if I would have used that instead I would have gotten a stronger lemon taste and more flavor overall. To sum things up, if you are going to make a cranberry muffin, make sure you make it with orange and maybe some nuts or some kind of spices because the lemon and cranberry by them selves is just not flavorful enough.
Also these muffins had a weird smell too them, which I think is from the cranberry

These were pretty good, but they were overly sweet for my taste. I’ll use half the sugar next time. I’ll also add orange or lemon zest to increase the flavor.

First time making them...
I chopped the almonds smaller and sprinkled them on top with a little sugar.  Could use more lemon flavor, definitely will add lemon zest next time i make these.  Very moist husband loved them.

These muffins turned out very fluffy with crispy edges! The cranberries were a bit tart but I suppose there’s no way around that. There’s not much of a lemon flavor which I prefer. Would definitely make again but will possibly add some orange flavoring next time.

These came out pretty good... beautiful golden brown and moist muffin... I added some lemon extract... next time I will also add some lemon zest... I gave it 3 stars because it didn’t have a strong lemon flavor, just a hint even with the extract added... if this had a little bit of a stronger lemon taste, then these muffins would be perfect....

This is an excellent basic  muffin recipe.  I wanted to use up some buttermilk so I substituted that along with the zest of one lemon  for the lemon juice and milk.  Two thumbs up for sure!

I added my lemon zest, as recommended by others.  They were still a bit bland.  However, the texture is great and they are very moist.  Love the almond topping.

I added lemon and orange zest like other reviewers suggested and they tasted great .  My only problem is the muffins didn't rise like I thought they would.  They looked like hockey pucks.  Not sure what happened but I was happy with the flavor.

These were pretty good. Not as moist as I like. I added orange zest to them because I had some on hand. I'll add more next time, and there will be a next time. Oh I forgot to add that it made 18 muffins, which was fine with us!

I followed the recipe and the only change was that I had to use dried cranberries. I read some other reviews and added a couple minutes to the bake time...mistake, most of them burned on the bottom.  They were spongy and had very little flavor.

I added lemon's worth of zest and a splash of vanilla. These are excellent with those additions. I made these once with muffin liners and once without. Do not even attempt to make these without liners! They were stuck to the pan and so crumbly. But in the liners they are perfect.

Fantastic recipe!  I made mini muffins and the recipe yielded approx. 32 mini muffins.  I used muffin cups for easy serving/cleanup.  Made these for a Thanksgiving Potluck and they're beautiful!  Only changes, I treated this recipe to Meyer's lemon and added zest.  Cranberries are another Super Food, yeah so I'll be making these wonderful cranberry muffins again soon.

I did make 2 changes to this recipe. I added the zest of 1 whole lemon and I added fresh blueberries with dried cranberries. The result was a super moist, tangy, sweet, light muffin that is great anytime. I didn't even butter them, there is just no need. I have added this to my top 5 muffin recipes.

These turned out pretty good! I got twelve muffins out of this. I used dried cranberries, that I soaked in hot water for some time. I also reduced the sugar to around 1 cup, and as suggested by many other users, I added the zest of one lemon. Going to eat another right now! :D

It's really good but the name is misleading. It should be titled cranberry buttermilk muffins or something (or have lemon zest added to the recipe.) There's no lemon flavor because your essentially making buttermilk which doesn't make cake taste like lemon.  I'm glad I only made one batch without any changes. Without changes the recipe is really good but don't expect lemon flavor.  Change the name of the recipe to something more appropriate and I'd give it 5 stars. I am going to add lemon zest like others have suggested the next go round and make it my own.

I made these exactly like the recipe called, except I doubled the recipe. I only had 1/2 cup of oil so I made up for the rest with 100g of vanilla yogurt. These turned out utterly fantastic!

A bit disappointed in these, really.  I used more than 1/4 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice PLUS a little grated zest that it didn't call for and I couldn't taste much of the lemon.  Will try another recipe next time as I like a very lemony flavour.  Perhaps one where it calls for zest and/or lemon extract?

The recipe says "Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just moistened"  but after I moistened I had a half a cup of liquid left over.  The muffins came out great, but there were only 9 muffins. I think next time I'll add ml some more flour and sugar to use up all the liquid.

Excellent recipe.  I cut the milk by 1/8 cup and increased the lemon juice by 1/8 cup.  (I love lemon).  I'll be making this recipe a lot.

Very easy. Nice texture and flavor. Added some lemon extract because I like a lot of lemon. Next time will try a spoonful of cream cheese dropped in the center of each muffin for some additional flavor and texture contrast.

Delicious! I did add about a teaspoon of lemon zest, which made the flavour perfect. My only complaint was that, even stored airtight, these dried out after only about a day... Still tasted great and were a nicer texture when warmed in the microwave. 
I will definitely make these again... Any ideas for keeping a little more moisture in?

I made several small modifications that helped them not be sticky: I used grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil and orange juice instead of lemon. I also added the zest of the Orange and used half buttermilk instead of all milk.  We also sprinkled turbinado sugar on top for a nice crust.

My brother loved these muffins.

I exchanged the sugar for blue agave, used Craisin cranberries, and added white chocolate chips.  The almonds were omitted.

No doubt I will be making them again.

Excellent!  I added lemon zest, after reading prior reviews, and these were perfect.  The muffins were huge, and ready in 15 minutes, a bit too toasty for me at 20 minutes.

These were light, fluffy, delicious! I took the suggestion of others to include a bit of lemon zest.  I also used chopped pecans rather than almonds because that is what was in my pantry.  I mixed some in the batter and put some on top.   I will definitely make these again when I have leftover cranberries! Yum!

These are great. I love lemon so I add the zest of one lemon and all the juice and make up the rest of the cup with milk. I also add about 1/2 more cup of cranberries and leave them whole. Sooo Good!!!
-This time i added blueberries instead. mmmmmmmm

They came out great! I added a little ground nutmeg and ground clove, as well as some vanilla extract. I also added a tiny bit more lemon juice because I love the taste of lemon!  My additions added a great kick! I didn't have the almonds on hand, but I bet they taste great with the recipe. If you like baking with spices like I do, I suggest adding a pinch of nutmeg and clove. The vanilla was key!

Doubled the recipe and added zest from one lemon. Used frozen defrosted whole cranberries and toasted chopped almonds on the stovetop in butter and oil and white and brown sugar.  Didn't make enough to top all so sprinkled others with white sugar. Also made some mini loaves and mini muffins since I only have one regular-size muffin tin.  These were excellent!

i just made these.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used lime juice since that is what I had on hand.  I knew that the lime would not be as strong as the lemon.  I read through several of the other reviews before making and noted that some suggested zest (which I didn't have, only frozen juice that I had stored), and many said it took longer to cook (more like 22 mins).  I agree that the addition of zest would make it considerably more lemony (limey, in my case) and that the citrus flavor was very subtle (even taking into consideration that I used lime vs lemon).  However, there is no way to say that these are supposed to be super citrusy, so no way to say whether it was too much or too little except for personal taste.  I took these out after the 18 minutes minimum cooking time and they were absolutely perfect.  However, my muffin tins are somewhat smaller sized rather than jumbo and I actually got 20 small muffins out of this recipe so they likely cooked a little faster.  I always take cakes and muffins out as soon as they are barely cooked through to keep them moist, and they are VERY moist and good texture.  Those who had dry or crumbly muffins likely overcooked them.  I also took them out of the tins after about 3 minutes out of the oven and let them cool on a rack.  Again, this is a must to avoid drying out cakes and muffins as they continue to cook in the hot tins.  I found the cranberry size to be very nice: there was a big enough bite of cranberry to get that lo

These turned out great! Made a few changes- didn't use almonds, added 30ml more of lemon juice and I used almost 2 cups of whole cranberries, instead of 1 cup halved. And it made 18 large muffins. Next time all I would do is add a lemon zest! Will definitely make again :)

Made these this morning, with a few modifications. This was my second attempt today for lemon blueberry muffins. Used my standard recipe first with modifications, consistency was good but not lemony enough. I found this recipe, and decided to give it a try. 
I used 1/2 cup lemon juice with 1/2 cup milk plus ~1 tsp fresh zest since reviews said lemon flavor was mild. Reduced sugar to 2 cups and added 1/2 cup flour because batter was somwhat thin and I wanted my blueberries suspended. Made mini muffins, 13 min on 380 convection baked nicely, but the muffins were very soft and stuck to pan pretty badly. The lemon flavor was perfect with 1/2 cup lemon juice, strong but not overpowering.
I might try again with this recipe, further modifying to reduce the moisture and sugar and add another 1/2 cup flour, and I would definitely use papers. I'm not a fan of papers normally, but these stuck badly.

Delicious and easy! I substituted the cranberries for saskatoon berries, and baked most as mini muffins (12 mins at 375, turning the tray halfway through, with no nuts), and they were delicious! Nothing to write home to mom about, but still easy to make and tasted good, my roommate and I couldn't stop munching on them.

This recipe turned out really nice. I found the lemon flavor a subtle compliment to the cranberries. I followed the recipe closely, adding lemon zest, adjusted the sugar to just over 1 cup and subbed 1/4 wheat flour for white in an attempt to convince myself it was healthy! I also pulsed the cranberries in a processor so they were coarsely chopped & distributed throughout. Will definitely be making again with orange.

I mixed 1/2 cup left over cranberries from Christmas supper and I used more lemon juice and then mixed some lemon juice with sugar and drizzled on top before baking. These changes made them excellent but do not use muffin paper cups as the sugar topping makes them impossible to peel off.

Made as stated and took one reviewers suggestion to add almond extract instead of almonds. I also sprinkled some lemon zest with turbinado sugar mix on top. These were excellent , even the cranberry haters in my group enjoyed them. I had made some lemon curd, spread on top before devouring and was even better. Definitely making these again!

Very moist. I ended up w 16 muffins and only baked them for 15 minutes. I also added lemon zest for more of a lemon flavor and used dried cranberries that uad soaked in hot water for a few minutes to plump them back up! This recipe is definitely a keeper in my opinion!  Yuuummm!

I agree with Cathy S. Recipe definitely needs lemon zest.  Otherwise I didnt change anything.  I made a double batch as I had fresh cranberries left over from Thanksgiving, muffins turned out very well.

This recipe has become a go to recipe. I sometimes substitute the cranberries with blueberries. When I do I don't halve the blueberries and I make sure that they are the very last ingredient so that the muffins aren't purple.

Delicious and fluffy!  I didn't have slivered almonds so I dusted the tops with brown sugar and they came out crispy and amazing!

I love this recipe!  It is so easy and the muffins turn out great.  I did make some minor changes by using a fresh lemon and adding the zest (Meyer lemons are great if you have access to them).  I also did not put almonds on top, but instead added chopped pecans directly to the batter.  Since fresh cranberries are often only available seasonally, try frozen cranberries if unavailable (although you will need to use whole since they won't chop well after being frozen).

Very tasty! I had leftover cranberries and this seems to be a good way to use them up. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used 1 cup of white wheat flour and one cup of all purpose flour. I also used soymilk instead of regular milk, and threw in a little bit of lemon extract. The muffins are really delicious. I would definitely make them again!

These are good!  Light & subtly lemony - just what I wanted blueberry (subbed equally & left whole) muffins with a hint of lemon, not lemon muffins with blueberries.  I'd agree with extract, oil or zest, if that's what you'd prefer.  I reduced sugar to 1c & oil to 1/3c, as suggested.  I rarely say this, but: perfect.  I'll use melted butter next time probably & half cup more blueberries - or cranberries - or both - maybe add soaked raisins.  I'm outta control sometimes.  :D  Back to this recipe, as I was filling the tin, it looked as if I'd need 18, not 12, which I did. I have 18 level muffins.  Those extra 6 may have fit or not.  I'm not into muffintinwashing ... :/ ... Several days later, 17 said "they weren't this good before"  :)  He's the only one that really liked 'em though.  Good muffin, but no one else likes lemon muffins as much.  I'll make a half recipe next time for him.

I like this recipe, but yes as others have mentioned lemon zest would make it perfect. I also, as always cut back on the sugar. I also used toasted coconut on top, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

Made these muffins for the first time and I added some lemon zest, since I read the reviews first before making the muffins. I found the muffins heavy and lack flavor even though I added lemon zest. I could not taste the cranberries in these muffins either,even though I added extra cranberries.Muffins lacked flavor big time will not make again. Garbage here they come.

I took the advise of a couple other reviewers here and used lemon zest in the recipe. I used the zest of two lemons, and dried cranberries. They turned out well, but even with the lemon zest I didn't find them overwhelmingly lemony. Might try more lemon juice with less milk next time.

I am eating these right now and they are delicious! I live in SOKO where lemon juice is expensive and hard to find. I used 5- 7 drops of lemon essential oil instead, and upped the milk to just under 1 cup. I also cut the sugar to just one cup and used dried cranberries. I am definitely making these more often!

I changed a bunch of things, and they were delicious. Yup, I'm one of those people. 

First, I only had dried cranberries instead of fresh which it appears the recipe calls for. So I cut back the sugar to just a cup since dried can be sweeter than fresh.

Next I didn't have fresh eggs so I used 2 Tablespoons of whole egg powder. Instead of adding 1/4 cup water to go with the dried eggs as I usually do, instead I added an extra 1/4 cup lemon juice.

Not happy with just doubling the lemon juice, I set out to make sure the lemon flavor dominated. I zested two whole medium lemons. It was a LOT of zest.

Also I subbed one cup of flour for whole wheat pastry flour. And I added a Tablespoon each of chia seeds and ground flax seeds. Just because I add them compulsively to everything. 

They were AMAZING. So incredibly lemony, but light and sweet. The only thing I would change is a little sprinkle of turbinado sugar or sugar in the raw on top before baking. And I'm thinking coconut oil would add something special too. Definitely would do the chia again, super yummy.

i did everything the recipe told me......... these muffins came out dry,there was no lemon flavor and if you are going to makethese muffin cut cranberries very fine, big chunks of cranberry makes your muffin bitter, and sour
hope this helps anybody in the future who makes these.

They don't have cranberries where I live at the moment, so I used dried pomegranate. I also substituted 1/3 cup of Trader Joe's Stevia (the one with lactose added)instead of the sugar.  They turned out great.  A little bit dense like a scone, but still moist.  Next time I'm going to try adding a bit of apple sauce!

My family and I liked this, but I was thinking about adding more lemon and sugar to it next time. I also used craisens rather than fresh cranberries because they do not have the fresh all year. I also used walnuts instead of almonds and added them to the batter. They were a big hit with my family. I would just like them a little sweeter and more lemon. I used the regular cupcake tins and made smaller muffins. I had about 48. I wanted them more portioned for my diet.

I replaced the milk with plain yogurt and kept the 1/4 cup of lemon juice - very lemony in flavour.  Super moist too.  Took 21 minutes. Will try reducing temp to 375 and add a few minutes next time (my oven seems to be a bit hot)

These were really lovely and I will definitely be keeping this recipe around.
Some changes I made - used a cup of dried cranberries (didn't have fresh) and soaked them in hot water to plump them up.  Added in the zest and juice of 2 lemons.  Skipped the almonds.
Made 12 large muffins.  The flavour was perfect and the crust on the muffins was so flaky and delicious.

These were really tasty.  Added a teaspoon or so of lemon zest like other reviewers suggested, substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour, and I cut down on the sugar to 1 cup. Think next time I might add a touch more sugar.  But they were so fluffy and moist.  Yum.  Oh, and it took 20 minutes to cook, just like the recipe says.

This recipe was really easy to follow. I did make some changes though...I mixed all my wet ingredients in the blender and used a whole deseeded lemon (peel and all)instead of the lemon juice. It turned out really good especially if you like lots of lemon flavour. Also, I used Splenda instead of sugar and reduced the flour to 1 3/4 cups.

I the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of using some fresh lemon zest (1 teaspoon). I did not like the taste of the muffins neither did my husband. It took 22mins to bake. I don't think that I will try this again.

I would add more lemon probably to enhance the flavor, but otherwise these are great. I did use whole wheat flour and stevia instead to make them a bit healthier.

I made these muffins tonight and they turned out great. They are very delicious! The modifications I made to the recipe included using craisins instead of fresh cranberries, almond milk instead of cow's milk, used only 1 cup of sugar and added 2 tsp of lemon zest. I baked them in the oven at 400 for about 23 minutes and they came out perfect, they came out nicely browned and raised nicely. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Good. Didn't rise very high, but they were tasty. I changed the proportions of milk & lemon juice to 1/2c each.

Tried the recipe as written and it was very good. It was just a little dry, so I think that needs some attention. Next time I'll be putting about 2/3rds the cranberries. This well have a rerun in our house.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast and the muffins were a hit! I made as directed, except took the advice of another reviewer and and used orange juice for the lemon. I also grated and added some orange peel (about 1 tsp) which added to the flavour. The timing to bake was about right, although it did make about 15 muffins. Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins are amazing! I followed your recipe exactly as it is written and they turned out wonderfully and I have honestly never made "from scratch" muffins before. The only thing I added was a bit of lemon zest as that was recommended in your reviews. Thank You!

Did I comment on these already, if I did it isnt showing up! I am making them for my 2nd time tonight! They were so good last time. I had to substitute some ingrediants... but only because I didn't have the original stuff. Like the milk. used almond milk last time and am using silk coconut milk tonight. Whole wheat flour, and brown sugar. I also added the tsp of lemon zest!
Over all I'm giving these a 5 star rating ! YUM!

These are wonderful muffins. I love lemon so I added the lemon peel. I chopped the cranberries but I think next time I will leave them whole and add them to the flour mixture. I also did not care for the almonds on top so next time I will omit them.

Great, standard recipe for cranberry muffins. Not 5 stars because it isn't anything super unique or special, but a good jumping off point to make them your own. I used almond milk instead of regular (which, if you are a bit lactose intolerant, is a fantastic substitute in baking. I highly recommend this if you're considering cutting milk out of your diet!!), half 1 C white flour and half 1 C whole wheat (just personal preference), only used 1 C sugar because that  already seemed like a lot, and definitely add LEMON ZEST! It adds a whole new flavor element to the muffin that should not be missed. The tartness goes really well with the cranberries. I did have to bake mine for 22 minutes, but after years of baking, I've just learned that every oven/altitude is different so just make sure to use the toothpick test, it's a no-fail!

Enjoyed these muffins, although I made quite a few alterations: I used half brown rice flour and half whole wheat, half white sugar and half brown, and coconut milk (which unfortunately does not sour when introduced to acids). Also, I skipped the almonds and sprinkled shelled maple flax on top. I agree that they could use more lemony tang, and plan to use more zest next time, but overall definitely recommend trying these!

They were great!  I used white & whole wheat flour and added a little ground flax to make them a little healthier & reduced the sugar to 1-cup.  I mixed some lemon zest and raw sugar with the almonds for the topping.  Excellent!

I like them just as they are.  For my taste, the amount of lemon is perfect.  This is one of the best I've tried.

These were good muffins. I followed the recipe exactly. They were great warm with a little butter. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because they weren't fantastically great, just good. I didn't have any fresh or canned berries, so I used what I had in my pantry and that happened to be craisens. Lol, but my boys liked them.
