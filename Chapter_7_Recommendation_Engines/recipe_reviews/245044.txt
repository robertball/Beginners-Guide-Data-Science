Thank you for this recipe! I doubled it and made it as a Thanksgiving side dish -- lots of rave reviews.

I decided to try it because regular mac and cheese is just so bland. This recipe provides just enough punch but not so much that it overpowers a main course. It's great alone and also as a side. I served it with ham. I made the recipe as given and also doubled. Both versions were perfect. Thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly except used fettuccine noodles instead of elbow macaroni and added one can of artichoke hearts (drained and chopped) when mixing the noodles with the cheese mixture. For the topping, I used the same ingredients as the recipe stated but substituted packaged plain bread crumbs for the cubed bread crusts . The family loved it. Great for a pot luck!

I used penne instead of macaroni, and a blend of italian, cheddar and parmesan cheeses and skipped the bread chunks, just based on what I had on hand, otherwise I followed the recipe. It was very good. Everyone at the table really enjoyed it.
