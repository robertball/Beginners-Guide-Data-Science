I loved these! I used a strawberry cake mix instead of white and they are pretty and pink and taste  awesome. I have never made homemade icing, so I just used a can of vanilla frosting. I had to make these for an office party and didn't have time to risk my icing not coming out well. Next time I will try the icing. But, i highly recoommend the strawberry cake mix, tastes great!

Not as moist as I thought they would be. I made two batches because I forgot to add the eggs to the first batch and honestly the ones without the eggs were sweeter and more moist.  Not sure I would make them again, I have definitely had better.

after reading all the reviews I find that maybe I can solve a few of the problems I read.  I always let my eggs set out for at least 15 min before I crack that shell.  I add 1 extra egg white.  This gives even t densest of cakes lightness.  When you are making American buttercream and you find it is too sweet, add 1/4 tsp more vanilla and about a TBL of SIFTED flour.  The flour cuts through that sugary taste without affecting the overall outcome.

Wasn't any different than a regular white cake to me and the icing was gritty.

This were good I put butter in the mix instead of oil and I put a little may for moist in the batter. I made the icing with whip cream,frosting pack from frosting creations,a liitle butter,and vanilla flavoring.

I tried this recipe and the first time the batter was really thin but the flavor and texture were okay. I noticed the ounce on the white cake mix I used (and the only ones I could find at my local grocery were less than 18.25 ounces. So I tried the recipe again and use one full box of white cake mix and enough out of a second box to equal the 18.25 ounces the recipe calls for and the batter was perfect texture and it resulted in larger and fluffier cupcakes. The icing is perfect as is. There is no flaw to the recipe that I can find - just that cake mix companies have cut back the amount of batter mix in the boxes.  They are delicious and now that I've figured out the reason for the thin batter I will be making these a lot for years to come.

The icing was a bit too sweet, and the cake was kind of odd tasting.

This recipe needs to be updated just a little because I followed the directions on the cake mix and they came out perfect at 13 minutes.                  I've made this with strawberry mix and white. I feel that the plain white needs just a little more flavor so I added some raspberry extract to the batter & frosting- and made a little raspberry coulee to fill ?? yummy!!

Followed the recipe as written - was disappointed there was no champagne flavor.  The cupcakes were moist, everyone enjoyed them, but if I didn't tell people there was champagne in them, you would not know.

This recipe was very good. I always put my own twist on things, so to make it my own I put a maraschino cherry in each cupcake and added 2 drops of pink food coloring.  And, just for those who feel adventurous, anytime you use a boxed cake mix add an extra egg, replace the water with milk (except for this recipe), and replace the oil with melted butter and double amount. Your cakes will be moist and dense, not crumbly.

Made excellent moist cupcakes and a generous amount of DELICIOUS frosting. I used paper liners to make cleaning easier and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Cupcakes came out great, I only used egg whites which made them come out very light and fluffy.  I also used French vanilla cake mix for more flavor. The frosting is amazing. This time I made vanilla however I want to experiment with other flavors like lemon  and strawberry

I made the recipe.  They are fun twist on cupcakes.  I used a package of vanilla instant pudding to the dry ingredients to add moisture.  I also used Fratelli Prosecco instead of Champagne.  Lastly, I added a little lemon juice to the frosting & I think 3 cups of confection sugar instead of 4.

Very easy and some of the best cupcakes I've ever had! The champagne seems to make them just a little less sweet, which is good, and they're also very light. I made them pink the first time for my daughter's 21st birthday. The 2nd time I made them was for an anniversary party, so I left them white and sprinkled some white and gold shimmer sugar on top. They made a beautiful presentation. They were a huge hit both times I made them.

Very yummy! I used Moscato d'Asti (sparkling white wine) and the flavor was delicious! I only used three cups of sugar in the icing, and added a splash more white wine. These were great for New Year's Eve!
