Keeper Cookie Alert! This cookie is delicious, easy to make and versatile. If you don't have lavender it is ok, use a floral honey and it will taste heavenly all the same. I made three batches. In one I used dried rose pedals (equalling 10 rosebuds) instead of lavender and a mild honey. Batch 2 I used floral honey but no lavender or roses. Batch 3 I used rose pedals and cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg for a Christmas effect and they are delicious. They are moist and tender but sturdy. Only 5 ingredients, easy instrucions, even I couldn't mess these up. They don't crumble and even hold up to being dunked in hot tea. Thanks Sueb for another super cookie recipe. All were made with gf flour instead of regular.

These were interesting. Pretty good after I got used to them. Made them as written except added 1/4 cup of white sugar and about 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt (which made a huge improvement). Liked the whole wheat flour.

I used white flour instead of wheat flour.  These cookies are more like a soft flat bread.  They are very good considering there is no sugar. I will make these again.  The honey sweetened the cookie very well!

These are so yummy! I added an additional tablespoon of lavender flowers and sprinkled sugar on top. They're not too sweet perfect with a cup of coffee or a cup of tea!

wasn't very sweet but I don't think I put enough honey. They are very good with tea.

Definitely needed some salt and a bit of sugar, but overall, not bad! I'll probably tweak the recipe again before making again.

These cookies are alright. I do like how they are not overwhelmingly sweet, plus they have lavender so I like them by default. The only thing about them is that they are a bit dry. I didn't add all the flour, either, and they still were kinda crumbly. Maybe it was user error, I dunno, but the flavor was good! Thanks for the recipe!

Has potential as a recipe. Instructions weren't clear enough for the novice baker though.

It would have helped if the recipe said if the flour was self raising or plain (all purpose) flour. I ended up using half and half - which may not have been the best idea. Also no idea what size spoon the batter is meant to be dropped from - teaspoon, tablespoon or something different.

The cookies turned out ok. The flavour is very subtle though, even the honey doesn't come through very strongly (and I chose a strong flavoured honey). I added lemon zest as well - so that could be why.

Will definitely give them another go, maybe with a smidge of salt added. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
