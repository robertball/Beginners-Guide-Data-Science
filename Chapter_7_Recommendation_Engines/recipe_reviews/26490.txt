I never made cranberry sauce before, and decided that I would make it for the family Thanksgiving dinner this year.  It was a HIT.  The only thing that I had to change is that when you first start cooking this, bring to a boil then reduce to medium heat and wait for the berries to burst.  Otherwise it doesn't get as thick as you would expect. I figured this out based on reviewing other similar cranberry sauce recipes before making this one.  I decided upon this one because of all the spices that were in this. They really made a delicious cranberry sauce.

WOW! This stuff is so good I couldn't stop eating it out of the saucepan and I've never been a fan of cranberry sauce! If you can boil water, you can make this.  After reading other reviews, I decreased sugar to about 1 1/2 cups and I grated the zest of one small orange right over the pot as it cooked, which I think gave it just the right layering of flavors without overpowering it.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper and has now joined my holiday recipe collection.

I love this recipe, the changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 1.5 cups and instead of adding the sugar at the end i cooked it all together to make more of a gelled chutney type. We have tried it with pork chops and found it to be a wonderful addition. Will use this recipe for years to come.

Never really liked cran sauce, but wanted to be adventurous this holiday season.  We give this 5 stars with our modifications:  substituted the water for orange juice, halved the sugar, eliminated the spice bag itself and just tossed in the cinn sticks and cloves (easy to remove before refrigeration).  We also sprinkled in a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  FYI - it took much longer than 15 minutes cooking time for all the berries to burst.  Overall, smelled fantastic while cooking & was a huge success at the table.

This MADE our Thanksgiving dinner, and I will never go back to canned cranberries again. It was so easy. I wrapped up the spices in a coffee filter and tied with thread since I didn't have a  spice bag.

My family and I LOVED this.  I served it along with the turkey at Christmas dinner, and everyone said that they would no longer use the canned variety.  It was easy to make; the only change I made was that I substituted orange juice for the water.

My husband cringed when I told him I wanted to make cranberry sauce for this upcoming Thanksgiving because he has HORRIBLE memories of cranberry sauce, past & present!

OMG!!! This cranberry sauce is so tasty, delicious, tangy and easy to make!  I rarely follow any cooking recipe to a "tee," so I did improvise a bit.  

I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and instead of bundling spices, I used a few pinches of nutmeg, a few pinches of cinnammon and an exotic mixture of dried allspice (with ginger, anise, clove, cinammon & nutmeg).  I went VERY EASY (a spinkle or two) with this exotic allspice 'cause I didn't want the sauce to become too bitter.  Also, the cranberries, sugar & water DO need to cook for approxiamtely 20 minutes to get a true sauce consistency.  

But ohhhhh so good!  I cannot believe how tasty this recipe turned out, with a deep red color...so pretty, too!  Cannot wait to serve this cranberry sauce to my family for Thanksgiving!  Thank you!

UPDATE: I am changing my rating to 5 *'s!!!!! My mom requested I make this again for Xmas dinner. I took some to my bf's parent's house too (we had Xmas dinner with both my family & his). Everyone LOVED this (except for my bf and one of his bros - confirmed cranberry haters!). My only change this time was to add the sugar in the beginning as this is how I've always done it. Yum, yum!!! What an excellent recipe!!! My family just RAVED over this! Served  alongside the "after Thanksgiving" dinner I prepared for my parents, bf & myself. My bf didn't care for this (but he dislikes cranberries anyways). This is a very "sticky" cran sauce that must be covered when put in the fridge to prevent it from drying out (my usual relish is not "gooey" like this... the high sugar content is the reason). Before serving, just stir and it will be fine. I must warn that the prep directions are a bit off. It will take at least 20 to 30 min. for your cranberries to pop. Simply bring a pot of cranberries & H2O to a boil (I subbed OJ for the H2O called for) and, when the berries begin to pop, reduce heat to low, add sugar and simmer until thickened. If some of the berries do not burst, gently mash them w/ a potato masher or pulse on low speed w/ a hand blender. Other than that (and also subbing homemade vanilla sugar for white sugar - thanks What a Dish for the idea!), I followed MARJK's directions to a T. This was a HUGE hit and will definitely find a place in my "keeper" file. Thx. for sharing!

My family was not a big fan of cranberry sauce until this recipe.  My sister likes to take the leftovers to mix with cream cheese & eat on bagels after Thanksgiving.

I'm not a fan of cranberries but this recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I couldn't stop tasting it!  I didn't use the whole spices--just the powdered ones and it turned out great.  I made this to use in the Cranberry Squares recipe on this site.  I took them to work and they were gone almost immediately.  BIG HIT!  Thank you!

We come from a family that had the cranberry jelly from a can plopped on a fancy dish.  I thought it was for show all these years.  I saw this picture and it looked yummy.  I could not resist.  It was delicious!  I even put it on toast!  I froze some in little amounts to use it as preserves.  I did lower the sugar to 1.5 cups and used orange juice instead of water.  My whole family loved it at Thanksgiving!  I took some to my mother in law who likes cranberry sauce.  She loves it too.  Thank you for sharing!  This will be made regularly in my family.   If you dont like cranberry sauce.. you will like this!  try it!

My friends and family always love when I make this.  They make sure that I am on the holiday menus for this.  No more Cranberry Sauce in a can, that's for sure!  My son even likes when I make more than enough so that he can use the leftovers for his pancakes, waffles, cheescake, ice cream, etc.  He just can't get enough.  I have to freeze extra cranberries to make it throughout the year.  And he is a VERY picky eater, he wouldn't touch the can stuff with a 10 foot pole.

I cut sugar down to 1 .5 cups. Used coffee filter for spices.  I used 1 tbsp. of ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon sticks..  Made a double batch on thanksgiving and froze half for later.  I've used this sauce as an excellent glaze for baked turkey and chicken breasts in the oven.  Yummy.

I had already cooked fresh cranberry sauce according to package directions, but wanted to "do something more" with it so I looked online for suggestions and ran across this recipe.  Without measuring, I added the spices suggested: cinnamon, cloves & allspice.  My husband and 5 kids (ages 8, 7, 6, 5 & 4) said it was the best cranberry sauce they have ever eaten.  My 5 yr. old daughter said "It tastes like pie!".  :)   YAY! for a new holiday favorite! :)  (Next time maybe I will look up the recipe.)

This was surprisingly very good. I'm usually a fan of the cranberry sauce in a can, but this was a nice change with all of the spices. I used orange juice instead of water. I also strained the mixture for a smooth sauce. Perfect!

This recipe was delicious! Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving. I did use a few different kinds of sweetener to give it some depth - used some sucanat, some brown sugar, and some pure maple syrup. Love the spices in this!

Made this at Thanksgiving.  It was a big hit.  I used Splenda (unfortunately, i got a little carried away and had to do a little adjusting, but it was still wonderful!  Easy to do (but they don't have to know that!)

I prefer whole berry sauce and knew the flavors I wanted for my sauce this year. I used this recipe as a baseline and doubled it. I also added a dash of nutmeg (less than 1/8 tsp.) and instead of whole berry allspice or whole cloves (which I didn't have left after mulling cider), I just added a few shakes of ground for each. This was amazing cranberry sauce, everyone raved about it, and in addition to my other cranberry relish, I think if offered a nice traditional element to the dinner. One family member was eating it over ice cream. I appreciate the tartness still being captured, so I recommend tasting the sauce as it is cooking and adding sugar as needed rather than all at once. Fabulous sauce.

I made this last year (using others advice and lowering the sugar and lowering the temp to medium and adding sugar at the beginning) and it was really good and I don't even like cranberry sauce.  I just spoke to my boyfriend on the phone about our Thanksgiving menu and he said, "Hey are you making that cranberry sauce again?"  Definitely a keeper!

This was the most simple recipe and tasted so wonderful! I loved the effect that the spices had on the cranberries.  I made this on Tuesday before Thanksgiving and had to stop myself from picking at it before we served it.  Will keep to make in the future.

This was pretty tasty!  I think it was a little sweeter than I usually eat... next time we're going to reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup and replace the water with orange juice to see if that brings the sweetness down.  Otherwise, the balance of spices made a perfect compliment to the cranberry.

This is the best cranberry sauce I have ever made! It's fresh, fruity, and bright, with such a delicious flavor from the spices added. I found, however, that it called for way too much sugar. I cut it down to 1 cup and thought it was perfect, sweet and tart. Some of my sugar-loving family members, however, thought it could use a bit more, so I guess it's a matter of taste. But I still think 2 cups is too much, and will always cut the amount back. This is fast becoming my go-to cranberry sauce recipe, because it's easy, tasty, and fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!!! Out of a sense of tradition, I love serving fresh made cranberry sauce...But this recipe makes it unique, and much more flavorful. The spices add a marvelous touch. (I did, however, substitute orange juice for water, for added flavor.)

This was the first time I did not go with the canned cranberry sauce. So glad I took the plunge. It was delicious. My husband was even willing to eat a lot of leftover turkey as long as he was able to put the "new" sauce on it. Our grandchildren loved it too. Will never go back to the old stuff.

Absolutely delicious. This is the best cranberry sauce we had ever had.. Our guests asked for the recipe. I didn't add quite as much sugar as the recipe called for and it was still incredibly sweet and perfect.

This is the first cranberry sauce I have made and I think it turned out pretty good. I added a little orange juice and like the flavor. Was a bit tart but paired with the turkey I thought it was very good. My family didn't go crazy over but we have never been big cranberry sauce eaters. Will make again! Thank you!

Loved this recipe.  I did use ground spices.  I also finely chopped a jalapeno pepper (seeds removed) and added to the saucepan.  I reduced the cooking time to 2 minutes and poured over a brick of cream cheese.  Served with water crackers or crackers of your choice.  Wonderful appetizer.

Excellent! I loved the spices! Don't skimp on the sugar, or it will be too tart. This jelled nicely into a firm sauce in the refrigerator, so make sure to transfer it to your serving dish before chilling.

I made this for Thanksgiving and I don't think I'll buy cranberry sauce again. I didn't have the whole spices so I just put in a couple dashes of ground spices. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 c. and I think the sweetness was perfect. I also added the zest from one orange. I put the sugar, water and cranberries together over high heat and let them boil to get the cranberries to burst faster and it didn't take long.

This was my first time ever making cranberry sauce from scratch. I have always used the can jelly to go with my turkey dinner. All these years I've been deprived of the real thing, just because of pure laziness. What was I thinking??? This year I used this recipe and it was phenomenal. I didn't changed a thing and it was so easy to make. Even my husband, who hates to eat "sugar" with his turkey, tried it and loved it. No more can jelly for us, ever. Thanks. ;)

This is better when you substitute orange juice (w pulp) for the water.  I also added a little (1 Tbsp.) of orange brandy with the sugar.

I love this recipe, and so does everyone who's tried it. I make a double batch with frozen cranberries, bring the water to a boil, and then turn it to medium to cook for ten minutes. For the spices I use an oblong tea steeper which perfectly fits the cinnamon sticks and makes for way less mess than a spice bag. I decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup (so 3 cups for a double batch), and make it the night before so that it can gel up in the fridge. Soooooooo good!

First time making fresh cranberry sauce - yum!  This recipe is great.  I added some fresh orange zest and also some shredded apple.  I also just sprinkled with ground cinnamon because the store was out of cinnamon sticks (that's what I get for shopping the night before Thanksgiving) but did the whole cloves and allspice.  I will definitely make this for future Thanksgiving dinners!

This stuff is awesome.  I've usually don't like cranberry sauce, and I've never made my own before this, but it is truly wonderful.  I made it exactly to the recipe and this will definitely become a holiday standard.  Thanks for a great one.

Excellent as is. I halved the recipe for 9 of us and it was plenty with a little left over. I didn't have cheesecloth or a spice bag so I used a tea ball for the cloves and allspice and just threw in the cinnamon sticks, fishing them out when it was done. I would only change the cranberries to 24oz since they usually come in 12oz bags- I don't think any of the other quantities wuold need adjusting with the slight increase in berries.

I made this with orange juice instead of water and about half as much sugar. Pretty good! Mine was a bit runny so I'd add less water/juice next time.
** Made it again this year for the second time with OJ and just the recommended water and it turned out great!

This is amazing!  My husbands told me to make sure & buy him a can of the jellied stuff because he hates real cranberry sauce.  He is STILL raving about it.  I caught him using on toast this morning like jam.  The spice mix is key.  It imparts a unique flavor to the sauce unlike any other I have had.  I will be making this every thanksgiving!  Thanks for the EASY & DELICIOUS recipe!

This was ok but nothing fabulous, I had to boil the cranberries a lot longer than suggested. The spices add a nice flavor.

This is fantastic! This is the first time I've attempted to make cranberry sauce from scratch and I was blown away.  The spices are perfect. I pulsed it slightly in the blender to make it a bit more saucy.  I've put it on everything from waffles to a peanut butter (and cranberry sauce) sandwich.

I truly do love this recipe! I tried Orange juice instead of water though. If you do decide to try orange juice I stongly suggest you use a brand that is fresh squeezed not from concentrate! I usually prefer Simply Orange, but I also use Minute Maid.

I'd never made homemade cranberry sauce ( I know, I know) because I thought it would be too much trouble and that my husband wouldn't like it. After having some at a holiday party he asked me to make some for Christmas.  Fantastic.  I've bought my last can of cranberry sauce.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this! A few tiny changes based on other reviews. I used OJ in place of water, reducing sugar to 1 cup and instead of a spice bag-which I didn't have- I used 1/4t of cinnamon, 1/4t allspice and 1/4t ground cloves. Perfectly sweet with a little tart. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing!

I agree with the other reviewers - too much sugar. I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, and even that seemed like too much. Otherwise, this was very good!

This recipe was such a sucess! the recipe was soo easy to follow! the only thing I would change would be not so much sugar, maybe only half of what theyre asking for. and I added a small pinch of ground cloves , and 2 whole cloves, it gave it an amazing flavor. I also took the advice of the ohter reviews and added the small stick of cinnamon.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Instead of water i cooked the berries in orange juice. I also used ground spices instead of whole spices. Just whatever spices you and your family enjoy. Easy and delicious. : )

Fantasitc!  Definitely making this for thanksgiving.  I used 1 cup water, and then substituted 1/2 c. orange juice for the remaining 1/2 c. water. I also brought the cranberries to boil and then reduced heat to medium-low, squishing the berries against the side of the pan.

Every year my family prepares yet another cranberry recipe for the holidays. It's more for tradition and not taste because we usually put a bit on our plate and leave it at that. This is the first recipe that was more than tolerable. It had a nice sweetness and spice that really made it unique. I think we found a keeper for our traditional dinners. Thank you!

Im rating off of my changes I made to the recipe because this recipe was a little off. the berries took longer than 10 minutes to pop... it was more realistically an hour. i didnt have a spice bag so I used a coffee filter and tied it off with a bread tie on top and it worked perfectly. even after letting the spices stew in the sauce it didnt have quite the cranberry zing so I hence added a little ground cinnamon and ground clove. For some reason in my family my grandmother always put chopped pecans in the cranberry sauce so I added 1/4 a cup and it was a perfect amount.... that is after I took out 1/4 cup sugar out of the recipe in fear it would be to sweet and even after taking the quarter cup out it was still a little on the sweet side. All in all after a few twecks this recipe has potiental and turned out divine.

I love this.  I've been making it every single year for thanksgiving and christmas for the past 3 years.  It is a total hit!  I also save the cranberry "water" once i drain the cranberries to help add flavor to the next years batch!  It says to put it in the fridge for 8 hours or more, but I always cook it day of.  This sauce is almost better warm, and will have more chunky cranberries.  So good!

Try about 1 cup of sugar Then sweeten to taste. I used about 1 cup and it was fine.  This receipe has great flavours. I didn't have any cheesecloth so I used a coffee filter tied with thread. I was a bit nervous but it held up fine.

I couldn't find a spice bag so I used cheesecloth, which kind of fell apart a bit. I had to cook it much longer than stated in the recipe. It had too much of a clove flavor for my taste.

The flavors in this cranberry sauce are truly exceptional however I only gave the recipe 4 stars because of the 2 cups of sugar!  I only put in 1 cup of sugar and it was the perfect sweetness for me (and I consider my tastes in cranberry sauce to be pretty average).  I recommend starting with just half of the sugar and then adding more to taste if you want.

This recipe is awesome.  No one, not even myself, enjoy cranberries.  However, I thought I'd give it a go.  I only used about 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and it should probably go up to 1 3/4, but any more than that and I think it would be too sweet.  I used extra allspice and cloves because I enjoy the flavors.  I also did as another review suggested: I hit a boil at high and then reduced it to Med. Low.  I also cooked it for longer to allow it to thicken up a bit, and it did so as it cooled.

All in all, a WONDERFUL recipe! My only complaint is against the cranberries themselves:  the little 'woody' sticks that came out of the cranberries as they burst.  Don't know what to do about those!

Love this cranberry sauce! I only made it with 2 cups of fresh organic cranberries and brown sugar. I added 2 sticks of cinnamon and 3 gloves. Once it cooled down, I removed the cinnamon sticks and cloves. I also added about a cup of fresh orange juice and sprinkled orange zest.
DELICIOUS!!!!!!

I doubled the recipe but left the sugar at 2 cups. For the spices, I added 1/8 tsp each of cinnamon, ground cloves and allspice. Great!!

This recipe is just wonderful and I have gotten raves both times I have made it.  I used  a 12oz bag of cranberries, substituted orange juice for the water and added in the zest of half an orange.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used light brown sugar.  Finally, I added in a handful of chopped pecans (probably equal to 1/4 to 1/3 cup) a minute or so before I took the sauce off the stove.  The spices and the orange zest really make the sauce incredibly flavorful.

This was excellent! My niece in law and I whipped up this recipe as I was disappointed with a few attempts on other recipes, but one previous attempted turned out well. BUT this one was soo delish. We easily exchanged the sugar for SPLENDA(R) with no problem and it was quite nice, thick and sweet with a little tartness. At our family gathering there happened to be 3 different types of cranberry sauce. 1 store-bought one and 2 that I made from here on AR, this one beat the other 2. As everyone preferred this one over the others. Will totally make again!! TY

I used half water and half OJ, and then half white sugar and half brown sugar, otherwise followed the instructions.  This was the best cranberry sauce I've ever had.  And the scent is divine with the addition of the whole spices.  This will be a tradition for me.

This is the first timne I've ever made (or eaten) homemade cranberry sauce and YUM!

I modified it a little based on some other recipes I came across:  Instead of 1 1/2 cups water, I used half water & half OJ.  I cut back the sugar to 1 cup (and it would have honestly still been OK with less).  I also added a little orange zest and a splash of Grand Marnier (it was for Thanksgiving and I thought it might help ease family tensions!)  I also cooked it for a bit longer (probably about 15-20 min) to get a nice jellied consistency (I prefer not to have too many whole cranberries in my sauce).

I will never eat the canned stuff again!

I made this for the first time a few years ago. I enjoy cranberry sauce from the can, but I was willing to try this. WOW.. it was a real hit! Everyone in the family likes this, even those don't like cranberry sauce. I make it every year now. In fact I can't come unless I bring this!

A definite keeper! This will be a staple for all turkey dinners at my house from now on! I couldn't find whole allspice berries so I subbed for a little over 1/4 tsp ground allspice. ***UPDATE*** I did dry some of this recipe with the other cranberries I was drying for "Awesome Sausage, Apple, and Cranberry Stuffing." Also, this was the first side my daughters ate when I fixed their Thanksgiving plate. It really is that good. I'm going to have to figure out how to can this recipes since buying cranberries off season is impossible.

This was a huge hit!  Even my super-picky seven year old twin boys were all over it, becuase, "Mommy, it smells SO good!"  Also only added 1.5 cups of sugar and put it in the fridge to cool 30 minutes prior to re-heating our left over chicken from last night.  Zero complaints!!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner at our home this year, and it was the most talked-about dish on the table. By the end of the meal, several of us were dipping our dinner rolls in it, and one clever cousin walked into the den after dinner with a bowl of vanilla ice cream topped with leftover cranberry sauce. It's remarkable. I'll never again be able to stomach another slab of that wobbly, rubbery canned stuff ever again. Good thing this recipe is also really, really easy. The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was I used my stick blender to make the mixture smooth. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is the best cranberry sauce I have ever had and the first I have ever made! It is very easy to prepare and has wonderful flavor - the only thing I added was the zest of one orange which balanced the sweetness some other reviews commented on. This is an instant holiday favorite!

Okay, no one in my family even likes that canned cranberry sauce stuff, including myself. I just knew there was more potential for deliciousness rom fresh cranberries. This was one of the biggest hits of the Thanksgiving table this year - everyone LOVED it, cranberry haters included! When I took it off the heat it was pretty soupy and sloshed around everywhere, but it definitely sets into a jelly-like consistency in the fridge overnight. Perfect amount of spices and sweetness. It's great!

I normally am indifferent to cranberry sauce, but this one is delicious.  It's not got the bitterness that cranberry sauce usually has, and the spices really add a lot.

This year is the first time I made my own 'stewed' whole cranberries for Thanksgiving (as opposed to the gelatinous mass from a can :). I used Splenda instead of real sugar, but I think I needed a little more than I used. This is a good recipe, but oddly, it was a little bland. (Seems strange to write that since cranberries are so tangy.) Next time I might try adding orange or lemon juice or zest like I read in some of the other recipes on this site and give it a slightly more multi-dimensional flavor.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  It turned out really good.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The kids even loved it, not something I can say about other cranberry sauces!

I loved this!  I only had one cup of fresh cranberries on hand, so I had to scale the recipe down to 4 servings.  I really wish I had made more, because it only really made 2.5 servings for us and it was so good.  I used my homemade vanilla sugar for this recipe, which added a little something special (and little vanilla bean specks).  And I really loved the spices in this.  They gave it a different twist.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is terrific! Per others' suggestions, I did reduce the sugar to about 1 1/2 a cup. I will definitely use this recipe from now on. I've already received requests to make this again for Christmas. My husband said it had a real 'holiday' taste.

I couldn't stop sampling it on the stove last night - it's delicious - but it only needed a little over half the sugar.  I doubled the recipe & used three cups of sugar & it was MORE than enough.  I added a few tablespoons of orange juice & the zest of one lemon, too, which I think added a little variety of tartness to it.

I had never fixed cranberry sauce before, and this was so easy! It was also a smashing success at Thanksgiving. I received compliments from everyone including those who "don't like cranberry sauce." I did use a hand mixer after chilling to break up the berries more so that it wasn't so tart if you got a whole berry in a bite.

I followed other reviewer's ideas:  cut to sugar to 1 cup, and used OJ instead of water.  I'll never go back to the canned stuff again.

Wonderful!   I didn’t have the allspice berries, but added about 2 tsp. of orange zest.  I also didn’t have a spice bag, so put the spices in a coffee filter and closed it securely with a clean rubber band.  I will probably cut the sugar back to 1-1/2 cups next time, as I thought it was a little too sweet.

Delicious and easy recipe. Who knew that making cranberry sauce was so simple and so much more delicious than the can stuff. I did take everyone else's advice and brought the sauce to a boil first (it only makes sense). I also followed another person's advice and added some orange zest, which REALLY set the taste of the top.  I did only add a couple of pinches though, so it wouldn't overpower the sauce.   I will definitely be making again and not just for the holidays.

I have been making this cranberry sauce for years!  It’s absolutely my favorite part of Thanksgiving.  I make extra to put on left over turkey sandwiches...makes a great chutney.  It’s great on pork as well.  Soooo good!

I've been making this cranberry sauce recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas for years now. I never seem to have sticks of cinnamon, so I just use some powdered cinnamon, and I tie the spices up in a coffee filter with some sewing thread, because no spice packets. 

I double the recipe, and instead of the four cups of sugar that would be required, I use 3.5. 

Everyone loves it! No orange, no nuts, no horseradish - just sweet tart spicy cranberries!

Holy yum!  I just made this and it is phenomenal.  I swapped orange juice for the water and added spices to our taste.  I also  simmered and simmered letting the cranberries take as long as they wanted to break and then some, ultimately 45 mins.  So freaking worth it!! I am seriously considering making it year round.

Everyone loved it! My husband said he’s officially been converted from the can. LOL! Simple and easy to make. I only used 1 1/2 C of sugar simply because we ran out. Still perfectly sweet without overdoing. This will be our go-to every holiday from now on!

I've made this recipe twice now, once a few years ago for Christmas and again this year for my family on Christmas as well. 

Before I made this sauce, i never really liked cranberry sauce. To me it was the nasty artificial looking canned sauce you buy at the store even if no one likes it. My family did this every year I grew up for both of the "Christian" holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. I saw the recipe and it sounded great so I thought I'd give it a try. As many other reviewers already stated, the sauce is delicious. The spices infused with the bursting berries add a complex and very seasonally appropriate flavor to a traditionally boring recipe in serious need of an update.

I was looking forward and to this s recipe, Andy made it yesterday.  Realizing there was a lot of sugar included, I actually cut it down to only 1 cup, but despite this the recipe is WAY too sweet.  Also, the cloves taste is overpowering.  
Sor4y, I don’t like this recipe at all, and I won’t make it again.  It’s back to cranberries plus oranges, mixed in a blender, without much sugar. I could eat that at every meal, Andy certainly at every holiday.

For most of my life, I *HATED* cranberry sauce.  My dad, however, loved it.  One year I went looking for recipes and found this one.  Very simple to make, and smells delightful.

I wiped up a bit that had spilled down the side of  the container, and tasted that.  Surprisingly tasty, bright and fresh and not too sweet.  (I cut the amount of sugar like some other reviews.)  Then I licked the spoon I'd stirred it with.  I realized I'd fallen in love when I sat down with the cooking pot and a spoon to get every last drop of tart deliciousness.  This recipe made me a cranberry convert!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  If you're an experimental cook, don't be afraid to play with it.   Put the zest of one orange in it.  Since you bought an orange, throw the juice in too, and add water to make the called-for volume.   You can double the called-for amounts of spices if your tastes buds need a wake-up call.  You can even throw a shot of pomegranate liqueur into it after you turn the heat down, which is DELICIOUS btw.  I change it a little every year, and every year my family, friends, and coworkers clamor for more.

This cranberry sauce is delicious! I made it this past weekend for our Thanksgiving here in Canada. It was a hit! Everyone enjoyed it and couldn't believe it was home made. I didn't change anything except to add a little more sugar and before I discarded the spice bag, I took out some of the cinnamon sticks and kept them in the cranberry sauce.

I love this recipe. So easy to make. The boasting flavour of cranberries and spices. Very tasty. Great with chicken, turkey, and pork. I’d even use it as a condiment with cheese and crackers.

I have made this twice now. Both times to use in Banana Cranberry Bread on this  site.  I didn't have whole spices, so I used ground. It smells so divine cooking!  I would most likely use the whole spices if I were not combining it with other ingredients as it would make for a clearer gel. Definitely easy to prepare and yummy to eat!

I rated this 5 star because I love homemade cranberry sauce but, I made a few mistakes and this recipe doesn't deserve for me to rate it lower for my mistakes. I thought because I didn't have any of the whole spice berries I could adjust ground spices instead.....probably shouldn't have done that because I wasted a whole bag of cranberries. I have however learned my lesson and plan on doing it right the next time around. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My husband bought two bags of cranberries that made 1.75 times the recipe. I made the recipe  almost exactly as written, including the full amount of sugar. The cranberry sauce came out great. In my opinion, it needs the sugar to contra the sourness of the cranberries. It would be helpful if the recipe mentioned the length of the cinnamon sticks to be used. The ones that I have are 4"  in length, and the cinnamon flavor stands out in the finished cranberry sauce. It is still excellent, but I may use less cinnamon in the future. I did use orange juice instead of water as suggested by other reviewers, and brought the berries to a boil on a high temperature before turning it down to medium. I cooked it the suggested 20 minutes, added the sugar, and then cooked it an additional 10 minutes on a medium heat. It looked watery when it was done, but jelled as it cooled. This cranberry sauce is definitely better than any you can buy in the store, and you know what's in it. I might also mention that it was very easy to make.

After reading other reviews, I made a couple of adjustments: I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, as I prefer it tart, substituted OJ for part of the water, and added grated orange rind. Did not have allspice and so just skipped it. I think I might have added a tad of nutmeg instead. It was still delicious and I've already been asked for the recipe! It's a very forgiving recipe, so you can play around with it however you'd like, and it's pretty foolproof. One note on timing: I used very fresh organic berries, and they burst almost instantly.

Made this for Thanksgiving, my father, who is an excellent cook, RAVED about this, I now have a new job on Thanksgiving every year. He loved it so much we're having turkey for Christmas so I can make it again. It's an explosion of flavors in you mouth,so good! Only thing I did different was used orange juice instead of water.  I'm not a fan of cranberry sauce but this, is a keeper!

This has become my family's favorite cranberry sauce. If you boil the sugar with the cranberries, it will come out a little thicker. I use a potato masher at the end to mash the berries.

I have made this  twice and yes it is a little sweet but I just put some extra cinnamon in to help mask the sweet. My only problem is that both times I have made it , it has come out soupy, I might try adding some unflavored gelatin next time to see if that helps to thicken it up.

Love it!  Because I always make my own, I modified slightly.  I used apple cider instead of water, plus half a chopped apple and substituted the white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar, and added a little freshly grated nutmeg.  Delish!

I wanted to make this  cranberry sauce  for Thanksgiving so I made it Saturday as A trail. It came out perfect. Will go great with our fried turkey and baked ham. Thanks for great recipes.

This was really simple to make but was a hit at the table. Nice recipe, fast to make, and totally delicious. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I used 8 cups of cranberries, 3 cups of water, 1 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of ground allspice, about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and about 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves. (I didn't have a spice bag etc so approached the recipe this way.)

live in mexico. so ingredients are hard to find plus we don't eat sugar.  only 2 of us so reduced cranberries to 1 cup, used dried cranberries because I couldn't find whole. only used 1/4 tsp stevia and used orange juice instead of water eyeballed spices because i'm not good at math. turned out GREAT.  wish I could have made it the way it was written but sometimes things just don't work out the way we want however this turned out great anyway.

This will be my third year making this. I pretty much follow the recipe (sometimes add a bit of vanilla bean, but nothing else) and it has been a huge hit. I make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas at everyone’s request and make a bit extra to have at New Years with cream cheese on crackers. Love it so much!

Awesome!  Have made it 4 times since Thanksgiving, both with water and with orange juice (as suggested by other reviewers).  Both ways were good but we preferred the orange juice.  Big hit with family and friends.

My husband won't stop raving about this. It was the first time I have ever made or have even eaten homemade cranberry sauce. I used a coffee filter and string from a teabag to submerge the spices. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 and a half cups of sugar. I'm not sure if I didn't cook it long enough, but many of the berries were still whole, and it was kinda watery, so maybe  cook it longer? It will be a tradition from now on. No more canned stuff for us. It was so easy. The expensive part was buying the cloves and allspice berries, but now I have enough to make it again and again, so it works out.

This is my husband's favorite way to have cranberry sauce.  It's easy to make, though you do have to watch it as it cooks so it doesn't burn.  This has become a must have item every Thanksgiving.  Leftover sauce goes well with pork chops too.

Couldn't be easier! And this is FANTASTIC.  Is there anything better than a simple, great tasting recipe?! I did as some suggested and used orange juice for half the liquid. Definitely more like 20 min to get the majority of berries to pop. First time I made it (last week) I put the cloves, cinnamon sticks, and allspice berries in and fished them out at the end. This time I emptied a tea bag, filled with cloves and allspice, and stapled shut; cinnamon sticks went in separately. Hoping this works as I don't even know where to buy a spice bag! Over 5 days I ate ALL of this by myself. I should be ashamed,  but it's soooo good! I had it with pork,  all by itself and poured over vanilla ice cream.  ;-)

A keeper for a basic recipe.  Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 Cups and cook long for thicker texture.  I also added 1/4 Cup orange juice and zest.  Make it a day or two ahead and save it in the fridge.  Really nice flavor.

Yummy!!! My family loves loves this cranberry sauce.  For dessert try it with a slice of pound cake.  You'll be coming back for more.  Only thing I did different was use orange juice in place of the water.

I made this in the slow cooker and it came out great! I didn't have a spice bag so I just used ground spices to taste. The last half hour I mashed the cooked berries and added a slurry of 1tsp each cornstarch and water to thicken. I'll never buy the canned stuff again!

Great recipe! It's nice and tart, just the way I like it.
note: I ran out of white sugar, so I ended up using mostly raw sugar, which worked out fine.

I saw this recipe and decided to try it this year for Thanksgiving dinner. I have never made cranberry sauce before so I was a little nervous. It turned out better than I imagined, and I hope we never go back to the canned stuff! So easy, and so much more delicious! I read several reviews first, so I decided to make it with orange juice instead of water and a cup and a half of sugar. I boiled it for about 25 minutes. Perfection!

Made this last night.  I am not a cook (in fact Thanksgiving meal will be the first meal I've made all year!) and this was so easy!  We didn't have a spice bag or strainer so we used a nylon which worked great.  My house smelled amazing, the sauce was so good we tried it before it cooled and it looks beautiful!  Will definitely make this again. :o)

This was a tough one to rate with my family.  Most of my family aren't fans of cranberry sauce.  My mom always wants it with a turkey dinner, but then she's the only one who eats it and I end up throwing out half of it.  I thought maybe this would be something everyone liked.  It turns out that everyone except my mom liked it, but they still didn't want it with their turkey meal (don't like sugar with the meal) and I still had to throw it out!  It was good though.  The only thing I changed was the proportion; a 12 oz bag of cranberries is only 3 cups, so I scaled everything by 3/4ths.  Of course, 3/4 * 5 whole cloves doesn't give you something realistic, so I just rounded up to 4.  I have a food mill that I use get the chunks out.

This was a hit! I needed one more gluten free dish even though I nor my husband eat cranberry sauce.  Not only did we try it, we LOVED it.  First off, the spices really come through and makes it very flavorful.  I reduced the sugar somewhat and it was still very sweet (though not overly sweet).  Second, this recipe is super simple to make that if you never attempted to make your own cranberry sauce, you will do fine.  

I made minor modifications to the recipe (reduced the amount of sugar to 1.5 cups, boiled the water with the spices included then add the cranberries and cooked the cranberries for at least 30 minutes and popped those that did not pop on their own) based on other reviews.  Also, I used a coffee filter and thread instead of a spice bag and it worked really well.  I would highly recommend this dish (I created an account just to write a review for this recipe!).

I boiled the cranberries in orange juice instead of water and cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. For allspice substitute, combine equal parts 1/4 tsp each of ground cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and  1/4 tsp black pepper.  When you use the spices you gently take apart and reseal in a new teabag. I've been using this recipe since Thanksgiving 2013. My cranberries take 30 minutes to pop.  Very easy recipe; make ahead of time!

This is the cranberry recipe I will use from now on, loved it.  Only substitution I made was replacing half the water with tangerine juice and a dash of salt.  Then after it was cold and set spread a thin layer of sour cream, mint leaves and whole cranberries to decorate.   Thank you ALL RECIPES !

I was honestly surprised by how easy and tasty this recipe was! Since it was just a few of us I reduced serving size to 4, which fit our needs. I also used 3 bags of mulling spices instead of the whole cloves, allspice and cinnamon sticks (since that was what I had on hand) and the flavor was still nice! I will definitely be making this again next year!!!

Been using this for a few years but this year I added a can of  pineapple chunks along with the cranberries and it was yummy! I figured it would add more fluid to the sauce, and it did become watery and was not thickening but I added the rest of the sugar (1/2 cup) and simmered a little while longer and got it thick. Normally I only add a 1 1/2 c sugar.

I used this recipe this Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit!  I substituted orange juice for the water, and cut the sugar to 1 1/2 C.  I also doubled the recipe so I'd have some leftovers.  I put some of the leftovers in jars in the freezer to serve later with ham or sausage, and kept the rest to put on bagels with cream cheese for breakfast. The texture is very similar to cranberry preserves...not completely gelled like the canned version.  I really enjoyed it.

Absolute rave reviews and a hit with everyone, even those who would never touch a cranberry without massive coaxing!  Easy to make and well worth it- I've been threatened if I don't duplicate this during the next holiday.  ;)

I followed the directions exactly and it came out all watery, even after cooking until the berries began to burst and keeping it for 20 hours in the fridge. (maybe I should have boiled it longer?)  I assume I must have done something wrong because everyone else seems to have had success, but I am usually very anal about directions and exact measurements so I don't know where I went wrong. I wanted to post this to hopefully help others as I thought this was a no-fail recipe and it unfortunately failed me. So if you are planning this for a big dinner, maybe make a practice batch first so you know it comes out ok. I wish I had!

I never thought i was a fan of cranberry sauce,but after tasting this one i realized that cranberry sauce isnt so bad after all. But from what i heard from the guests, this was absoultely delicious!I took a masher and mashed the berries a bit so it wouldnt be so chunky. I had ALOT of compliments on it. I will defintely make this one again. I didnt change a thing expect for omitting the allspice berries, couldnt find it at the 2 grocery stores i went to.

Such a hit with all our Thanskgiving guests! Very delicious. FYI, if you can't get a hold of a spice bag, I used a metal loose tea holder and it worked well. Thanks for the recipe!

So simple, my 8 year old daughter made it! So tasty, there is none left!

I followed the advice and only used 1 cup sugar and orange juice instead of water.  Thank heaven Christmas is only 4 weeks away!
