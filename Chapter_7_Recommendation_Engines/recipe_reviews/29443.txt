This recipe was ok. I felt that it was a bit too "vinegary" tasting though. Although, vinegar was not called for in the recipe, the sherry and ginger together make for a pH extreme. Also, mango chutney's vary greatly depending on the brand & this ingredient was the most prominent as per volume in the sauce. Perhaps it would have been better if I had used the same brand as the recipe's author?

I pretty much liked this. I used some dry Chinese rice wine in place of the sherry, as that was what I had and ended up enjoying how it balanced the sweetness of the chutney and complemented the ginger quite nicely.

The only negative for me was that even 30 minutes at 350 F wasn't even close to long enough to get my fish flaky, which meant that my potatoes sat on the stove a little longer than I'd have liked.

Great flavor.  It goes well with white rice and a vegetable.  I used Steamed Brocolli.

Easy and delicioius. Wouldn't change a thing. I prefer grilling swordfish, but not when it's COLD outside! The marinade makes a delicious sauce over rice. Add some broccoli or asparagus and you've got one killer mid-winter meal.

My fiance and I loved this! It was easy to make, it didn't use too many ingredients, and it tasted delicious. I will definitely make this again.

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe at all.  I tried it because I had the ingredients on hand.  I usually grill swordfish, so maybe we didn't like it because it was baked.  We didn't even finish it--a waste of an expensive fish.

The fish was moist and tasty, in contrast to how swordfish can often be.  An excellent recipe.

Incredibly easy and tasty option! This is definitely the best swordfish meal I've had at home!! The fish comes out so tender and the taste is great. Even better -- it's INCREDIBLY easy to make! Just a few ingredients and hardly any prep time.   We used a thermometer to make sure steaks were 125-degrees before removing from oven.

This recipe is terrible.  I love sherry, and I love mango chutney, but the two just do not go together.  I mixed up the marinade and tasted it to see if there was enough ginger. Thankfully, I had not put the fish in it yet.  I didn't ruin the fish, but I ruined a jar of my homemade mango chutney.

Excellent recipe. I used Patak's Major Grey Chutney, which already has ginger in it. It worked out great.

An added bonus for this recipe is that leftovers make incredibly good cold sandwiches the next day.

Family enjoyed it. I have only made swordfish once before and was looking to expand my fish options. It was simple a easy to make. I used three swordfish steaks because there was three people eating.Let it set in the marinade for almost 2 hours but it still came out good. I like the mix of the seafood with the ginger and mango. Served it with mashed potatoes and carrots. There were no leftovers.

I halved the recipe, cooked as instructed for 25 minutes and it was very good.  This was the first swordfish I ever cooked and i appreciated the simple ingredients and flavor.  I do think some salt and pepper would be good to add to the marinade.  The fish tasted best with the sauce spooned over the portion.

Yuck--it was horrible. My family is not very picky, but I couldn't blame them for not wanting to eat it!
