These are awesome!! They're very sweet and yummy. I used a regular sized muffin pan, and the recipe made 18. Instead of baking them for 30 minutes, it took 20-25. After struggling with 2 butter knives to make the topping, I just used my hands to toss it together lightly, and it came out fine. Also, I chopped the apples into small pieces instead of slicing them and used paper liners. It was very easy to remove the muffins from the liners. Highly recommended! =)

Excellent muffin recipe! I would highly recommend this for fall baking and to anyone who loves apples! I doubled the amout of vanilla and added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. You could easily substitute raisins for the walnuts in this recipe which is really nice. For the topping I used brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. of flour and 2 Tbsp. of quick cooking oats. These baked up beautifully, but for some reason I got a bit more than 6 - oh well more to eat!

Fantastic muffins! The crumble topping is yummy. I made it with brown sugar instead of white sugar and it was really good.
Also, Don't use paper liners, it makes the muffins soggy. I grease my pan really well and I have never had any problems with my muffins sticking.

To those who say your muffins didn't rise, your baking powder must be expired...

Great recipe!  I made a few adjustments: 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 2 1/2 cups diced apples.  I used regular sized muffin tins and came out with 15 muffins.  I also made a different topping:1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup melted butter.  They were perfect!  Smelled great, tasted great. See pictures I posted. We will definately make these again!  Thank you for this recipe.

What can I say...these muffins are wonderful!
I didn't have any walnuts and used ground haselnuts. I also added cinnamon to the topping.
They realy are light and fluffy, the topping is sweet and crunchy and the smell
while they are baking reminds me of a german christmas market !

Excellent results. Creamed the sugar (used lt.brown), butter, eggs, vanilla and salt quite a LONG time which I read somewhere would help the muff√≠ns really rise. Even sifted the flour as I've often been disappointed by flat muffins. These came out fantastic, apples didn't sink, top was high and crusty, will make again for sure.

We really liked this muffin recipe. After reading reviews, I used 1 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, used a little more than 2 cups apples and made smaller slices to have more apples per muffin and added a little nutmeg to the batter as well.  We don't care for nuts so I omitted them.  I also made my own crumb topping; 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 cup butter.  This topping generously covered 18 regular muffins which this recipe yielded for me.  Will definetly make this recipe again.

I'd been looking for a good muffin recipe for company, and these were absolutely delicious!  These were just as good if not better the second and third days after I made them.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar; I also used granny smith apples which I chopped into small pieces.  This recipe made 12 regular muffins and also a mini loaf.  I sprayed the pans with cooking spray and had no problems with them sticking to the pan.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

These are large, fluffy and tasty walnut apple muffins! I diced up the green granny smith apple instead of slicing them. I followed the rest of the recipe ingredients and directions. I used buttermilk for 1/2 cup milk called for in the recipe. I filled up my jumbo size muffin tins 3/4 with batter and baked 375 degrees for 30 minutes. The muffins rose up and gave a nice apple-y aroma. These are sweet, fluffy and moist muffins. My only small criticism is that this recipe yields 6 jumbo muffins and I suddenly had to whip out my 12 muffin pan to fill up 4 more tins. All in all these are tasty muffins. The cinnamon crumble topping is sweet and tasty.

my alterations: all whole wheat flour, half the sugar (sub brown sugar), leave the peels on the apples, double the cinnamon, extra 1/2 cup of apples. delish! and much healthier. I dont think you even notice the peel on the apple at all, but that's where all the vitamins are! I remove half the sugar from most recipes and it's still very sweet. if you use 3/4 c of sugar that is about 1 tbsp per muffin if you make 12.

My whole family raved of these muffins. I made a few changes simply because of what I had at the time. Instead of white flour, I used 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup old fashioned oats. I also substituted plain almond milk for the milk. And lastly, in the crumble topping I used 3 T brown sugar in place of the white sugar. Because, I do not have a jumbo muffin tin, I made 17 smaller muffins. The end result was a melt in your mouth delight. These muffins are moist on the inside yet slightly crunchy on the outside. There is no question that we will make them again..

LOVE these muffins!  They are a family favorite and I get requests for them every fall.  I do change the recipe slightly by using half white and half brown sugar in the muffins and brown sugar in the topping, but that is just a personal preference.  The only problem is how fast they disappear!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were very good indeed!  Moist and tasty.  Instead of cinnamon, I used Apple Pie Spice to give it an extra burst of flavor.  I diced the apples as I was using standard size muffin tins.  Next time I think I will add maybe a 1/2 cup more.  After reading the reviews I did replace 1/4 cup of sugar with brown sugar and I also changed the topping as many reviewers said that it wasn't that impressive and it fell off.  I used 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 tsp. of Apple Pie Spice and 2 T. of softened butter and it stayed on the muffins even while eating.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make this often for family and friends.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

I had the greatest results. I added walnuts and while folding them in with the apples I added 1/2 c  of sour cream. The idea came from my favorite "banana banana bread" Moist and delish

These were good muffins.  I hate to be one of those people that raves about a recipe and then proceeds to tell what they did to change it, but.... I didn't add the walnuts AND I grated my apples instead of slicing them.  My kids loved these!

These were great. I did a little variation though. I eliminated the walnuts and apples and added frozen blueberries. And instead of adding the batter to jumbo muffing tins, I filled normal ones with the mix to the top, this made giant top muffins! They were delicious!

I used this as a jumping off point.  Reduced sugar to 1 c. 1 cup flour and 3/4 whole wheat. Used 4 apples, grated. Added in  1/4 c each of ground flax meal, wheat germ, and chia. 1 cup walnuts.  Upped milk to 3/4.  Sprinkled top with turbinado sugar instead. Ended up with a dozen using 4 oz scoop, plus one mini loaf. Mind, my additions/changes do not turn out a fluffy result.

Sounds delicious - wondering if it can be attempted in a small loaf pan rather than muffins? Will see.

Be careful not to put too much batter or topping in the muffin tins or they spread out the sides and are difficult to get out of the pan, even with paper liners.  The taste, texture and moistness - perfect.

These are delicious.  Rich, moist, and yummy.  I made them exactly as the recipe instructed and admred the finished product of jumbo muffins.  Then I looked at the calorie count.  Over 600 calories per muffin.  I will make them again but as regular size or even minis.  I couldn't finish the jumbo anyway and a mini would have been perfect.  I think smaller muffins would have come out of the pan more easily, too.

OMG delish!  The best apple muffin I've ever made.  Light and fluffy!  I did add extra apple and they are really moist.  Also, I got 10 jumbo muffins out of this recipe, and doubled the topping to cover them. I did change the topping to 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and half teapoon of nutmeg.  Excellent!

Absolutely delicious muffins!  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar in mine and they turned out fabulous.  I also made regular size muffins and baked them for 23 minutes.  Everyone from my husband to my three year old son loved them.  Easy to make, great results-a keeper for sure!  Thanks Jen!

I just made these and they turned out really well! I made 12 smaller muffins instead of 6 big ones. I baked them at 350 (instead of 375) for 25 minutes (instead of 30 minutes). I sprayed the muffin pan with cooking spray first and I had no problem with the muffins sticking to the pan. I made a few of my own revisions to the recipe. For the flour I used 1 cup of white and 3/4 cup of whole wheat. I cut back the amount of  sugar slightly...instead of 1 1/4 cups of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown. I used 4 teaspoons of baking powder instead of two because I like my muffins extra fluffy. I also omitted half the butter (I used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2) and added 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I doubled the amount of cinnamon (1 tsp instead of 1/2 teaspoon).

I make muffins all the time for my husband to take to work and I will definitely be making these again since they were so moist and delicious! They haven't even completely cooled since taking them out of the oven and there's already four missing. =)

Yummy! My hubby, 10 yr old and 8 yr old LOVE them. I made regular sized muffins, though, baked at 375 for about 23 minutes, that worked out perfectly. Next time I might cut down the sugar a bit. This recipe is a keeper!

So good! We found them pretty sweet, but with the sugar cut (I used just over half the original amount) and half the fat replaced with applesauce, they were pretty much perfect!

Delicious and moist, but not the prettiest muffins I've ever made.  They didn't rise much.  I think they may require a touch more baking powder because of all the moisture the apples provide (just a guess).

Great muffins! Very moist and the topping adds a great crunch and flavor. I let the butter soften before creaming with the sugar which the recipe didn't specify, but it helped. I kept the butter for the topping cold.

When I served these hot for breakfast,I was a little disappointed. They were perfectly adequate, but nothing special. For that reason, there were a lot left over the next day. The next day they were wonderful. Overnight, they had grown moist, and the flavors of the apples and the pastry had blended together. I've never had a muffin I liked better.

These taste awesome, but mine didn't come out very fluffy. They didn't rise much, so they didn't look great with the muffin cups. The cinnamon crumble topping makes it extra tasty! I shredded most of the apple and added some dried cranberries in for taste.

these were wonderful, light and airy. I did make a few changes to make them healthier. I replaced half the butterwith apple sauce, used 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey, and replaced 1/4 cup flour with wheat germ, i also doubled the cinnimon and added a pinch of nutmeg. next time I will try using even less sugar because the muffins are very sweet.

I LOVE these muffins! They came out super tasty, even with a few of the substitutions I had to make. I didn't have enough white sugar, so I replaced all of it with brown. I also had 3 egg yolks that needed to be used before they went bad, so I stuck those in along with one egg white instead of the two whole eggs. I baked these in regular and mini muffin tins (25 and 15 minutes), and replaced the crumb topping for about 3 T of toasted wheat germ, 2 T sugar and 1/2 t cinnamon and they came out just awesome. The apple and cinnamon flavor comes out nice and strong, with the walnuts complimenting both flavors very nicely. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Mine aren't very pretty, but they sure are yummy!!  I used regular muffin tins, finely diced the apples, and used demerara sugar and 3/4tsp cinnamon in the topping.  I forgot to alternate the milk and flour, maybe that's why they turned out a bit flat.  But ssssoooo yummy!  The recipe should state  "thinly" sliced apples and "chopped" walnuts, 1/2 cup "softened" butter, and 2 Tbs "chilled" butter, for those that aren't used to making muffins.

Yum. Baked these for my bf's bday breakfast in bed. A friend of mine described them as having the perfect mixture of texture - crunchy walnuts, juicy and soft apples. They were absolutely delicious when I served them the second day and still very good on the fourth day.

I went with my son on an apple picking field trip.  It was fun, and had a whole bag of apples to use somehow.  The phone rings.  My son's teacher asks if I can bring a cooked item using the apples to school with my son tomorrow.  Apple muffins sound good, and AllRecipes.com was the place to find a good recipe.  This recipe was intriguing with its positive reviews.  If they were for myself, I would have put the crumb topping on them, but I chose to leave off the crumb topping for fear of too much mess in the classroom, and doubled the cinnamon in the muffin to compensate for the lack of cinnamon in the topping.  I also chopped up the apples instead of slicing them.  I did sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top for a little sweet top.  I made regular size muffins and stretched it to make 18 muffins.  The recipe would have better made a bakers dozen.  And they cooked for 22 minutes.  They were fabulous!!!  And the teacher reported that every child in the class liked them and finished them.  That last sentence has to be the most positive review of this recipe.  It's a keeper, definitely!!!  And I can't wait to try them with the crumb topping!  Yum!

very good muffins and great way to use all the apples i have accumulated!  The crumb topping is essential!  I doubled the crumb topping to add extra goodie to the top of the muffins.

Very Very Nice Muffins BUT....I had trouble getting the muffins out of my muffin pan and I believe that was because the apple "slices" did not allow the batter to settle evenly into the cups; I also used a small loaf pan and that too "broke up" in sections.  Next Time I'll use apple "chunks."

Made more than 6, made 11 but could have had 12.  Crusty around the edges. Cooked at my regular degrees for my oven because 375 would have burned them black.  Not sure if I will try again.

Really light and fluffy - great way to eat up windfall apples. Have made several times over the past months. I replaced the nuts with a generous 1/2 cup of raisins, and used a generous 2 cups of mixed eating/cooking apple varieties for a good flavor. Tried without the cinnamon crumble once, but they weren't half as yummy... however I do add a small handful of oats to the crumble topping now.

Very good, fluffy muffins.  I made as directed and used a regular muffin tin.  I used a medium cookie scoop to get a heaping scoop of batter, and doing that gave me exactly 24 muffins, which baked at 375 for 18 minutes and came out beautifully.  Next time I'd do 2.5 cups of apples and .75 cup of walnuts, as well as doing half the sugar with brown sugar to give more depth of flavor.

Very nice texture; airy, not thick or heavy!  They were plenty moist too.  I used Granny Smith apples were a bit tart, so I threw in a cup of white chocolate chips and that added a nice bit of sweetness they needed.  Great recipe I'm sharing at a family reunion tomorrow and I will use again for the teacher's tea before Thanksgiving!!!

Wow! These are delicious! I followed the recipe measurements exactly and the only small change was to dice the apple into smallish chunks instead of slicing. I used a regular muffin tray instead of jumbo and I'm taking some of these in to work tomorrow to share as they are so delicious. Fantastic recipe. Thanks

Pretty good.They did not raise very much...and NO it was not my baking powder and all my ingrediants were fresh and not outdated.But, none the less they were good in flavor...Way to much butter in them they were kinda of greasy.

*WARNING*They stick to everything!Need to fix that too.

I think i can work with this and make it great recipe!

This recipe is great!  A little more effort than the typical muffin recipe, but worth it.  I didn't have any nuts so I just omited them, and they turned out great without.  Moist fluffy muffins... mmmmmm

Excellent muffins - moist and not too sweet!  My family loved them!  I did add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, shredded the apples, and corsely ground the walnuts.  Next time I will also try to substitute 3/4 of flour with whole wheat flour so they'll be healthier for my toddler.  I did not use the cinnamon crumble at all - I had Caramel Frosting V leftovers so I used that on some of them - great combination.

I noticed the first few tins of muffins didn't rise very much and I had all fresh ingredients so I added another tablespoon of baking powder to the rest of the batter and the rest rose a bit more. I baked the medium muffins for 24 minutes and used paper liners. They popped right out of the pans and weren't soggy. Really delicious and they make the whole house smell awesome.

I accidently messed this up. New oven set it on grill not bake OOPS. Anyway still tasted AMAZING. Mine stuck in the pan and didnt rise (my fault) so I scooped it all out of the muffin trays and made a layered desert with it instead. in a glass serving bowl I put the crunchy tops of the muffins, layerd it then with some vanilla custard, drizzled spiced apple sauce (pureed cooked apples with cinnamon and brown sugar) then added the  muffin crumbs (insides) another layer of custard and sauce etc etc and so forth till I ran out. Last layer I used custard then topped with chopped walnuts. It was a HUGE success at the dinner that evening!
(works with all disaster muffins if they taste okay, just use complimentary flavours :) )

Another delicious muffin.  I omitted the top as I was in a hurry to get them into the oven.  I diced my apples and used pecans (because I had then on hand.)  I also made 12 regular muffins and baked then for 20 minutes.  Great cold the next morning for breakfast.

This is a GREAT muffin recipe. The muffins are delicious. Everyone loved them. I didn't used the topping becuase I didn't want to bother with it. Instead I spinkled the top with a basic cinnamon/sugar mixture and it was fantastic. I've made these many times. I have noticed that the moisture content chnages with the type of apple you use. But the taste of the muffin is always good!!!

I love these muffins!! They are so moist and packed with apples! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and added a little nutmeg and ginger to it for an added kick! I also used brown sugar for the topping. I will definitely make these again- I think they would be excellent for brunch!!

These turned out pretty good.. the topping is a nice touch and the muffins came out sweet and moist.  Maybe I shouldn't say "came out" though, because they're still in the kitchen stuck in the [well-oiled] pans.  Use muffin liners.

I did not like this recipe.  Tasted like very dry cake.  It also made much more than 6 jumbo muffins.  My family said they were just ok.

Wow! Wonderful! Made these today and they were easy and wonderfully delicious.  Chopped the apples instead of slicing, but other than that followed the recipe to the tee.  This is a real keeper. You can't tell these from bakery muffins. It made six jumbo muffins and a small little loaf pan muffin.  Thanks, Jen.

This is a great recipe.  I brought the muffins to a brunch, they were a hit.  They thought that I got them from a bakery. I was asked for the recipe. The best apple muffins that I've made.  Thank you.

I liked this recipe. The crumb topping on to was really good, although I did have to add a bit extra flour to make it crumbly. I also added some nutmeg, which gave the muffins a nice spicy taste.

We LOVED these muffins. What a delicious treat they are. They're light and fluffy just as described and the taste makes them better. I had to go out and buy a large muffin pan to make these but it was definately worth it! Highly recommended

Great base recipe! 

I can't have milk so I did 1/2 cup of orange juice with 1 tsp of baking soda instead of baking powder.  I also added a little more cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I baked these in smaller muffin pans and they were ready in 18 minutes.

The walnuts are key. So tasty. 

Thanks!

Easy!  Used all lt.brown sugar & a mix of whole wheat & oat flour; also used 1T of Greek Yogurt to milk to make the 1/2C.  Used suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp Nutmeg. These turned out GREAT!  Have lots of fresh picked apples, so will be making more batches to freeze for those cold winter mornings.

I just tried this - they taste great  - BUT - They basicly did not rise - they were not light and fluffy - they were very dense. I made them twice assuming I forgot something - but they were the same both times - What Happened?

These are amazing!  I baked mine in regular tins and it made 16.  I did make a few changes but I am sure they would be perfect as is. Here are my changes: 1. cut the butter in half but added 4 oz of unsweetened applesauce.  2. Used only 1 cup of sugar, 3/4 white and 1/4 brown and 3. I used lowfat buttermilk instead of milk.

These are scrumptious, moist, light, flavoursome and oh so delicious.  I used UK muffin cases and a 5cm ice-cream scoop and got a yield of 20. Baked at 160C (fan oven) for 20 minutes. Big hit with folks in my office.

Substitutions/variations based on other reviews:
Used 1cup white caster sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar
Spices: 2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon all spice
Topping: used  2 tablespoons flour and 1 tablespoon rolled oats

Pretty good. The only changes I made were 1 cup sugar instead of 1.25, used slivered almonds instead of walnuts & adding some oats to the cinnamon crumble.

I thought they were great! Made as instructed. Hubby wasn't as keen - not sure why? Muffin top was quite flat though. Maybe more than 2tsp baking powder necessary but then again one doesn't want it to taste like baking powder.

I would leave recipe as stated.

DELICIOUS :) very simple to make and results in fluffy moist muffins. ALSO it has the right amount of sweet taste.  CHANGES: used 1 c. white sugar and 1/4 c. brown sugar. replaced walnuts with pecans used 1 tsp baking soda +  1/2 tsp white vinegar mixed with milk

Overall an excellent recipe, perfect for fresh fall apples.  Do yourself a solid and if you can, buy fresh apples from your local farm or farmer's market.  There no comparison in flavor between fresh farm produce and produce bought at the grocery store.  Some varieties of farm apples can be stored for several months under the right conditions, and still have more flavor then the grocery store version. My one complaint, way too much sugar.  I feel most recipes call for way too much sugar, so I always cut in half. I used 1/2 c sugar, and I think with the streusal topping, and ripe apples, when I make this again I'll cut it to 1/4 c sugar in the batter.  I also cut the streusal's sugar from 1/2 c to about 3 Tablespoons. I warmed my eggs in hot water while I fluffed the sugar,  then added the eggs, I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 2 t ground cinnamon, 1/4 t ground cloves, 2 1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 c buttermilk instead of milk alternately with the flour, 1 c finely chopped walnuts (in a food processor that I pulsed 5 seconds at a time until I reached my desired consistency), and used fresh finely chopped Pippin Apples that I put in the processor.  I folded the walnuts and apples in. I got 16 muffins.  Be careful not to overcook!  Mine took about 15-18 min at 375 F.  My Grandma taught me you can tell if a muffin is done by lightly pressing on the top of the muffin.  If it bounces back, it's done, if it pushes in and stays that way, it needs more time! Happy baking!

Awesome muffins!!! I halved the recipes and made 7 large-sized muffins, really great even without the walnuts, and i used cinnamon-sugar instead of butter crumbles for the toppings..still taste fantastic. Also, i diced the apples. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made 12 standard size muffins with this recipe.  These muffins have an excellent buttery flavor.  I used Granny Smith apples and diced instead of slicing them, left out the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand, and I only used 1 cup of sugar for the muffin batter.  I gave these four stars because the crumble topping wasn't that impressive.  I didn't think there was enough of it, and it fell off the muffin when you were eating it.  The crumble topping on the banana crumb muffin from this site is a much better topping.

These are delicious.  I don't have jumbo muffin tins so I used my standard ones - this recipe yielded 17 muffins in paper liners.     I doubled the topping recipe (to cover 17!) but I think that multiplying the topping ingredients by 1.5 is the best idea since I had extra leftover. I used Granny Smith apples and I small-diced them instead of slicing.  Baked for about 20 minutes in my convention oven.  My family loved them.

So yummy!!  I made these once for a friend of ours, and now he will do ANYTHING for a batch of these muffins.  For the topping, I use my old standby BH&G fruit crisp topping because it has oats and brown sugar and I just like it better.

These are very tasty. I got 18 regular sized muffins out of this recipe. Instead of the topping I used Red and White Sugar crystals. Gave it a nice sweet crunch on top. Also I left out the walnuts since I was making these for a school party. I stirred in about 1/2 cup of cinnamon chips instead. Thanks I will be making these again!

These were delicious!  I'm not even a huge fan of apple, but they were great!  I'm allergic to eggs and had to use an egg substitute, but they still turned out perfectly.

I never baked muffins before, but I looked at this recipe and had all the ingredients in my pantry so I gave it a go.  It was lot easier than I expected and the results were OMG!  Krunchy, sweet cinnamon crumble topping elevated this muffin to one of my all time fav.

Yum...my three year old girls loved helping me make these, especially sprinkling the topping.  I substituted raisins for the walnuts and brown sugar for the white in the crumb topping.  I also shredded the apples instead of slicing them, which I think is much easier to work with.  I baked them in regular muffin pan and I had 12 full muffins.  I could have probably made 14 or so regular muffins from this recipe.  These are definitely a keeper.

I have made a double batch of these twice.  The first time I made exactly as the recipe states, except I chopped up the apple slices.  The batter was light and fluffy, but the muffins themselves didn't overwhelm me.  The second time I sliced the apples like the recipe calls for but doubled the spice and added a smidge more sugar.  They are good, but I think I still like the batter better than the final product.

Flattened out on top - likely a result of overfilling the pan, or else too much baking powder.  Will probably be better the next day as the flavors blend.

I made these muffins without the topping and they turned out great.  I made these both as jumbo and regular size and everyone thought the regular size turned out better... the smaller ones had a nice crusty outside with every bite.

These are so good! I made them healthier by using Splenda instead of sugar and water instead of milk, and I didn't even put the crumble topping on them. They turned out a little crunchy on top and so light and fluffy inside! So good, I love this recipe!

this recipe was awsome. Every one liked it. It was moist and full of flavor. the only tweaking i did was 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar and i added cinnamon to the topping. I have made this twice in one week and my daughter is helping me make it for her 4H contest at school!

These are really yummy indeed! I put soy milk instead of regular and reduced the sugar to only 1 cup which is more than enough...next time I will use even less. For the top sprinkle I kept the butter (cut in big pieces) in the fridge together with the sugar, cinnamon and flour required and just before sprinkling the muffins I used a fork to cut down the butter in the pea size bits.
Gold recipe for sure! Thank you!

These were delicious, but made these modifications for the batter mix: I used 1/2 cup white + 1/2 cup brown sugar (the extra 1/4 cup of sugar is unnecessary. 1 cup was sweet enough). I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger. I chopped two peeled MacIntosh apples finely, but not minced. I used all of the batter in a standard 12-muffin tin, sprayed (no muffin papers), and they fell out perfectly after 30 min with no burning. Will definitely make these again.

i used this recipe in a pie tin to make a kind of coffee cake. i would recommend using only one egg (the taste is overpowering) and more apples. i also added oats and used brown sugar. otherwise good.

I rated a 4* as I made minor changes as per other reviews.  I used margarine instead of butter, reduced sugar to 1 cup, increased cinnamon to taste, and diced apples.  I also baked them in a standard 12 cup muffin pan. The muffins have a nice flavor, and I will make these again if I find myself with apples nobody will eat, like this morning.  Great recipe, thanks.

I left out the walnuts because my husband doesn't like them. Also, to cut fat, I substituted half the butter for applesauce, and used only a cinnamon-sugar mix for the topping. They tasted great. As I don't have a jumbo muffin pan, I used a regular muffin pan, but I bet they're better in jumbo size.

I didn't have any apples so I replaced them with 2 bananas, used margarine instead of butter, and cut the sugar to 1 cup. I didn't make the topping and it still came out great, it was actually fluffy and light. I didn't grease my non-stick muffin tin and the muffins came out easily.

These are awesome muffins, definitely earning 5 stars from all of my friends and family that have tasted them.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly and they were great.  The following times I have made them, I have used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce.  This makes the batter thinner, but the muffins were lower in fat, remained moist for longer, and cooked just fine.  I also added more cinnamon.  Cooking them in regular muffin pans works just as well as the jumbo ones.  One last tip, I've found the substituting apple pie spice for the cinnamon is good, too.

After reading all the reviews first I opted to use small muffin pan (dozen) and I used non stick pan and greased it as well, THEY STILL STUCK!! Very annoying when I did everything possible to get them out in one piece, I even put them in the freezer as other reviewer suggested, it did help a bit. I found they did not rise very well and all my ingrediants were fresh and not outdated. I diced the apples instead of sliced. They tasted great, but next time I will use paper cups(not that will make difference as others said they stick in that too)
If anyone can figure out why they stick to everything please post reason...
I also use brown sugar for the streusal topping.

These were really good, but I used whole wheat flour and substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I also diced up the apples.  Sliced? (shrugs)

These muffins taste great! They did not rise and were very greasy though. :( Definantly do not use paper liners. Ours were soaked through. I made a couple of changes. I substituted 3/4 of oat flour, 1/4 brown sugar, added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamin, chopped (not sliced) the apples, and made regular size muffins. I also used brown sugar in the crumb topping. Baked 25 minutes-made 16 muffins. Over all I liked this recipe and will make again! Thanks from one Jen to another! :) EDIT- In an effort to use up apples I made these again today and they rose great and made perfect muffins. YUMMY!

I love these muffins.  I had been using a 'basic' muffin recipe and adding cinnamon, apples, and raisins to it but these are so much better.  Much more flavorful then what I had been using.  They have truly become a family favorite.

Delicious, fluffy, just the right crunch on top, I had to stop myself from eating two of them as I was taking them out of the pan!!!  I substituted 3/4 whole wheat flour, used 1 tsp cinnamon in batter, and used 3 apples, 1 shredded and rest small diced. The walnuts were small diced, too.  The tops did not dome for me...maybe I put too much crumb topping on top...?  Excellent flavor!!!  Thanks!

Wow, these are great!  I altered the recipe by using 1 cup white, 1/4 cup brown sugar; 1 cup white and 3/4 cup whole wheat four; 1 full teaspoon cinnamon; and pecans instead of walnuts.  For the topping I used brown sugar instead of white.  My batter made a baker's dozen regular size muffins that baked for 20 minutes. Thank you.

Taste was very very good, but I think some of my baking ingredients have lost their freshness and power because they would not rise. (I am also using Splenda). I will definately try again once I get new baking powder.

I don't like baked apples, and I love these muffins!  The recipe made, for me, 12 regular muffins and 2 dozen mini muffins.  I keep them frozen in the freezer and just warm them up for a quick and yummy breakfast.  Delicious!  Definately a keeper!

I followed the recipe verbatim in terms of ingredients, but put the muffins in my average sized muffin tin, not a jumbo tin.  The muffins tasted okay, but they didn't rise at all, and were incredibly messy, stuck to the muffin pan.  I sent one batch of muffins (I made two batches) with my huband to work and received no feedback, whereas I made the chocolate chip pound cake (also from this site) and had 6 people ask for the recipe.

I would definately recommend this recipe. It is one of the best muffin recipes I've had. It's moist enough, and has the right amount of spices with the apples. I also used mango's along with the apples and it still tastes great. Thanks

I left out the walnuts and halved the white flour with wheat and white sugar with brown.  These muffins were SO good that I was forced to run out that SAME morning to get the fixings to make more.  All of those leftovers were stolen from ON TOP OF THE FRIDGE by my very small dog(how?).  I guess he couldn't take the smell w/out having a taste himself!  Great recipe!

These are great.  Texture remained awesome even after substituting 1/4 applesauce for a 1/4 cup butter.  I also left off the topping to cut out calories and left my apple chunks fairly large for extra moist muffins even the next day.

Excellent flavor, even better the next day.  I chopped the apples since I made mini-muffins.  The recipe made 36 mini-muffins and 1 large muffin.  For lower fat, I substituted  unsweetened applesauce for half of the margarine and they were still great.  I sprayed my nonstick muffin pan with Pam, and still had a bit of difficulty removing the muffins, so if you don't have nonstick tins, I would use cupcake liners.

This is the best muffin recipe I have ever tried.  So simple yet so delicious! I had several requests for this recipe already!  I chopped the apples instead of slicing.  I also used regular sized muffin tins.  I think I will bag up the dry ingredients in ziploc bags for even quicker mixing on busy days, and freeze chopped apples for these when I freeze my pie apples.

Love the base recipe but I made minor adjustments. Firstly, I halved the butter using Gala Applesauce (2 oz butter & 1/4 cup  applesauce). Secondly, using peeled chopped Gala apples. Thirdly, I substituted the Walnuts with 3/4 cup of ground pecans which I added to flour mixture. All were placed in large muffin tins with parchment paper liners. Baked for the 30 minutes yielding 12 good sized muffins! Perfect & yummy!

Delicious!
The directions state to slice the apples. My opinion is they should be diced.

I used a smaller muffin tin and it made 17 and took 24 minutes. The whole house smelled awesome! I didn‚Äôt put the topping on top and they were still perfect. Will make again maybe with pears?

I used up the last of my apple crop this year making these tasty muffins.  They will come in handy for a quick fall breakfast.

Really outstanding recipe.  I make them so much now that I omit the paper muffin liners and just brush the pan with butter and then lightly dust with flour.  This makes a nice crisp crust on the bottom and they seem to stay fresh for several days in my ceramic cookie jar.  They really are great for breakfast or an afternoon snack

The taste is fine but they are very crumbly and came out of the cups all crumbly.  I've made many muffins but these are the worst.   I doubt if I'll make these again.  I  used plenty of Pam.

So yummy, thanks for sharing! Reduced sugar half cup and used half brown for remainder (for topping too). Made 12 (baked 20 mins) and was worried about too much batter but filled each to near top and they rose to a nice height with no spillage and that was with an extra 1/3 cup of apples (had large apples). Use cupcake liners. Was short a few and the bottoms on those were a bit soggy but still delish!

This muffin recipe was delicious.  I couldn't image so simple ingredients would turn out a muffin this good.  I made one simple change and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose.  Will make again real soon.   Whole family loved them.

Moist, flavorful, etc.  Instead of the topping I mixed egg white with water and brushed this on the top to give them a nice crunch.

Used up some sad apples that were soft and past their prime.  They worked great.  We really liked this, I'll make it again soon with the remaining apples.

I made everything the same except substituted whole wheat flour instead of white and they were so moist and rose well. I didn't even add the topping. They are a real treat with less guilt! :)

This was fantastic! I chopped my apples rather than just slicing them. I used the little bit of low fat vanilla yogurt I had leftover (1/3 cup) and then judged how much milk to add for a good consistency- turned out delicious. I also added 1/4 t nutmeg. I will probably bump the cinnamon up to at least 3/4 t next time.

Family loved this recipe. Even my granddaughter that is a picky eater loved it. I diced the apples and doubled the recipe. Put it in two regular cupcake pans and 2 mini loaf pans. I sprayed it with pam but not enough. Some stuck. Next time I will use Crisco and see if they come out better. With that much in the oven I ended up cooking them 30 minutes anyway.  Will make this again and soon,.

These had a very good flavor - maybe a little sweet though.  Next time I make these, I will cut down on the sugar a bit.  They were very hard to get out of the tins, so I would suggest using muffin cups - and maybe even greasing the muffin cups.  Overall a delicious muffin though - they only lasted one day in our house! :)

These were easy to make with stuff you have on hand at home, and simple, good instructions. The outcome deserves 5 stars. Also, I only have a 12 muffin tray so I made 12 smaller muffins as opposed to 6 jumbo, and it works perfectly.

For the topping, I did not make the crumble because I did not feel like fussing, and still, the muffin tops were a tiny bit crunchy while the inside was super moist and tasty! These were really flavorful yet light enough to have 2 or 3 of them with your coffee (I was hungry ;o))

What I changed after reading other reviews was to add more spices that I like, such as nutmeg, more cinnamon, and even a tiny sprinkle of clove. Aside from that, I used some brown sugar. I will definitely make these again, they were great.

Really good recipe. I was hoping for bigger fluffier muffins but they weren't bad. Didn't quite get that round oomph that I wanted but they still tastes delicious. I added chocolate chips. Will make again for sure

These didn't rise as much as I expected, the tops were more flat than peaked, next time I may add a tsp more of baking powder to get a better rise. Despite the flat tops, they were quite yummy. My son and DIL thought they were the best muffins I have made, so five stars for that.

I baked these yesterday.  Double all the ingredients and made 24 regular sized muffins.  Baked at 375 degrees for 23 mins.  I skipped the fancy crumble top and reduced 40% of the sugar (just me, I don't like them too sweet).  Still came out soft and yummy.  Thanks for sharing!

I took some of the other reviewers suggestions. I like to make baked goods as healthy as I can. (I used 1 large Rome apple which equaled 1 cup DICED, not sliced apple) I changed the recipe as follows: 1/4 c.unsalted butter, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce (actually I dumped in one of those small individual applesauce cups that comes in a 6-pk. package), 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, & added 1 tsp. apple pie spice in addition to the 1/2 tsp. cinnamon listed in the orig. recipe. Since we love walnuts, I used 1 cup chopped walnuts. I noticed in the recipe that they added the salt in with the butter, sugar, etc.  I instead added the salt in with the dry ingredients & then followed the orig. recipe directions. Baked them at 350 degrees for approx. 25 min. You do need a deep dish muffin tin. This recipe made 12 deep dish muffins. If you don't have a deep dish tin, then I would guess this recipe would make 24 regular muffins. They came out PERFECT! So moist & delicious! This is a keeper. I'll be making these for Thanksgiving & Christmas.

I followed the recipe, but didn't have jumbo muffin pan, so I used regular size (yield 12). No idea what happened, but they were soggy on the bottom, crispy on the edges & completely caved in in the middle. (One reviewer suggested that was from expired baking powder, but mine is brand new, so maybe from the butter in the topping?) The flavor was really good, though, so I scooped the muffins into a bowl, kinda smashed them all together & told my family it was apple cake crumble. :) I may try the recipe again in a loaf pan, just to see.

Made this a few weeks ago. Would definitely make again and again. Doubled the amount of vanilla, as well as the cinnamon, also added a handful of raisins. Also chopped the apples into small/fine pieces. This made 6 large muffins and 6 regular cup cake size ones.

Tried these muffins this morning and after looking at the ingredients thought there was to much sugar. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and found that was plenty sweet. I omitted the streusel topping  as well.  It needs more cinnamon without the topping so next time I will increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp and maybe add 1/2 cup of applesauce for a little more moisture. Overall, the recipe is great just modified it to my personal taste.  Rated it as a 4 because of the amount of sugar used.

I loved this recipe but added 2 tablespoons chia seeds, and 2 tablespoons crushed flaxseed and substituted flour with gluten free, and butter with dairy-free spread! Also reduced the sugar. Best dairy and gluten free apples i have EVER tried, and my family agreed!!

I used 3 cubs of crab apples (because I had lots) and they turned out delicious! I substituted brown sugar for the crumble topping

This was fabulous! I followed the directions exactly for the muffin and made a crumble topping we like (flour, butter, oatmeal, cinnamon) and I will most definitely make these again! They were light and fluffy but still had substance and sweet but not too sweet.

My son wants me to give this recipe a 5 star rating.  He and I baked these muffins together.  I reduced the sugar to a little less than 1 cup of brown sugar and we omitted the nuts.  They were so easy to make and they were light, fluffy and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Was delicious - with my alterations! :) I was feeding a large crowd, so I doubled the recipe, which made 3 dozen muffins (using a regular muffin tin). For a healthier variation, I cut the sugar in half and used 1 C. wheat flour & 1 1/2 C. white flour. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon called for, and added a wee bit more milk as the mixture seemed to thick at first.
I thought the strusel topping really added a nice touch to it. These muffins went over really well!

Nice basic muffin. Prefer extra spice such as suggested with nutmeg. I like the reviewers suggestion of oatmeal in topping. Would have liked baking time suggestion for smaller muffins.

Tried this recipe today, as I had a taste for a great muffin with a cup of coffee.  These did not disappoint. Used the exact ingredients called for in the exact proportion, except for the apples. I used a little more than two cups and I left them in nice chunks. The result was nice warm apple bites within the muffins.  My husband bit into them and just sighed ..."wow, you can really cook!"  Will definitely make these again.

This recipe is really great! It's really tasty and my kid loves it. I've adjusted the recipe a little though by cutting back the amount of the sugar to 25g and using brown instead of white sugar.

I thought these were delicious! I used regular muffin tins, and at a 1/4 cup of batter per muffin, made 19 muffins. I also cubed the apples instead of slicing them, and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts (what I had on-hand). I just used my hands to mix the crumb topping :P so it worked up easily. Thanks for a great recipe!

great recipe.  I used raw sugar instead of white and it tasted great.  I also used salted butter and left out the salt.  But it turned out great.  Thanks!!

These muffins do not turn out well as the recipe is written.  I followed the recipe exactly, and am a trained chef, and these ran all over my oven.    1. They taste pretty good, but look unappealing.  2. They come out flat, with no crown. 3. They are extremely sweet. 4. Maybe too much leavening?

A great recipe to start with.  I would try adding a little nutmeg or something.  If baking in normal size muffin pans or small ones, I found that they baked perfectly at 20 minutes at 375 degrees f.  Depending on your oven you may need to cook a little longer.  These were perfectly moist.

These were REALLY great!!  Although I think it wouldve been better suited for me to do 7 muffins, rather than 6.  They were filled to the brim, and I had a little extra batter leftover.  If I had filled all 6 to the 3/4 line like mentioned, probably couldve gotten 7.  Will be making again for sure!  Thanks

Loved these muffins.  Smells like heaven when you are baking them.  I doubled the recipe and used regular muffin tins and it made over 2 dozen.  Also I didn't use the crumble topping and just sprinkled lightly with cinnamon.  Also added more cinnamon to the whole recipe than it called for and a little allspice.  If you don't add the crumble topping make sure you add extra spice to batter to make up for less sugar.

Overall yummy recipe.  I like to mix the wet ingredients together, then stir in the dry ingredients.  I don't think you need to alternate mixing in the milk with the flour.  I also used 1/4 cup of butter with 1/4 applesauce.  Then also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups white flour.  Finally I cut the sugar down to just 3/4 cup which turned out just right.  I can't imagine how sweet it would be if you used the full amount called for .

These were GREAT, I made two batches in two days. I cut the apples into chunks and mixed in some walnut "crumbs" with the topping for an extra nutty taste in the topping. Will DEFINATELY keep this recipe on file!

Great recipe, my husband and I really enjoyed these, very fluffy and moist with the bits of apple...Yummy!  The topping didn't do much for them, will probably leave it off next time I make them.

I used one cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white.  They were delicious! I would make without the topping as we arent "sweet" eaters, but other than that they were very good.

Delicious! I used regular muffin pans and it made about 18. I baked them for about 25 minutes. They came out smelling good and tasted awesome!

This recipe was amazing! I made a few tweaks to it though and added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and like 2 and 1/4 cups apples diced very small. The only thing that you need to be careful about is overfilling, definitely make sure with the crumb topping and muffin batter that it is for sure 3/4 filled, mine went over and they got a little stuck, oh also make sure you spray the pans a ton if you don't use muffin cups because they do stick pretty easily, I love eating these muffins!

Great muffins!  I had to leave out the walnuts due to allergies and made about a dozen and a half of the regular sized muffins.  They seem to freeze well and are a great way to use extra apples.

Really yummy and moist.  Raised nicely.  I thought that the topping would stay more separate but it kind of baked into the muffin, which was fine.  Definitely delicious!

These are the BEST muffins ever, HOWEVER....I've made them twice now and sprayed the muffin tins and tops of tins, and these muffins just don't want to come out of the pan!!!!!  The first time I thought I may have let them cool too long - this time I took them out immediately after removing from the oven - still stick so bad.  Wish someone could recommend doing something to stop this - I like the large tins and I don't know of ever seeing paper liners for the larger pans - maybe there are such things - if so, that would do the trick I guess.

reviewed by Renee March 2010  I made this with a small adjustment, I added nutmeg and used 1/4 cp brown sugar with 1 cup sugar. The reviews are really helpful. I always  read them. I made 6 lg muffins and only needed one big apple. Luv the recipe. Now a fav.

Absolutely Delicious!  Light and airy.  I did not add the struesel to cut down on some of the decadent calories and they were still delicious!  I also only used 1 cup sugar and they were still delicious! What a great recipe to use up some of the apples I had on hand!

I will give them 5. My boyfriend said they should be 4 because he wasn't eating them all in one sitting but he still cleaned them up in 3 days. I would recommend to not fill them to full because the tops will spread out a lot. Other than that thanks for a great recipe

These are really good, they came out of the oven an hour ago and are already half gone!  This recipe made 18 regular muffins.  I left out the butter and flour in the topping.

Wonderful muffins. I only substiuted 1/2 cup milk for pumpkin pie mix (I had some leftover from a pie I made) and used 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. I omitted the topping just due to time constraints and they where wonderful. I main 18 standerd size muffins.

OMG these are fluffy!  Followed the recipe except diced apples small instead of slices. Used standard muffin cups because I don't have large (I need to get them). I used paper liners, just seem easier for transporting.  They felt a little squishy when taking them out but once cooled they were fine.  Made about 18 muffins.  I substituted brown sugar for the topping but that didn't work out to well, not sure if it was because I had more muffins and should have doubled recipe or if white sugar just works better but will absolutely be making these again. Brother said they were delicious and he doesn't use that term lightly, a very high compliment from him.

These are amazing! I followed some of the changes that other reviewers had suggested - like doing a 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar for the topping (for the cinnamon, I substituted pumpkin pie spice and added about 2 tsps?). But totally delicious!

Incredible! So fluffy and sweet; great for an on-the-go breakfast. I subbed applesauce for 2 Tbs of the butter. Next time I will omit some sugar too, since they were really sweet. I added some wheat germ on top for extra nutrients. So yummy! I made 12 regular muffins and a small loaf from the batter. They disappeared fast!

I made these for the first time last night.  They were amazing right out of the oven, but still tasted great today at room temperature.  I made 18 regular size muffins (with liners) and the only change I made was subbing brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping. De-LISH!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I really liked this muffin.  I grated the apples with the peel and made them into mini muffins - they are great for breakfast or after school snacks for the kids.   I will absolutely make again.

I wasn't sold on this one, but it may have been the baker.  I'm a pretty good muffin maker, but these just didn't work for me.  I overfilled the cups, and I guess that's a big no-no.  I also rushed the mixing part.  I did the sugar and butter (lovely) and then dumped in the wet stuff.  Yuk.  I folded that into the dry, being careful not to overmix.  It looked okay at that point, but something still went wrong.  While the muffin part in the cup was light and fluffy, the tops were non-existant.  I ended up trashing the whole batch, but WILL follow the recipe again and follow mixing instructions.  Will review my rating after 2nd batch is complete.

I left out the walnuts, cut the recipe in half and also didn't make the topping. I did add chocolate chips, though, and these turned out great. I'll definitely make these again. Mine baked for 20 minutes as I used regular muffin papers. Yummy!!

I had a can of apples that i wanted to use so i tried this recipe. So glad i did. I chopped the apples and made 18 regular size muffins. Used sour cream in place of the milk, omitted the crumb topping and drizzled with caramel topping while still warm. Got rave reviews from guests.

One of my favorites to make in bulk and freeze for easy breakfasts on the go. These are moist and not too sweet.

this is an awesome muffin recipe. it made 12 muffins in regular sized tins. I followed the recipe exactly (but diced the apples) and it was wonderful. the topping was crunchy and the amount of apples and nuts was perfect. next time i would add a tablespoon of chopped nuts to the topping for a bit of extra crunch.

Very tasty muffins.  A bit too sweet for my liking.  Next time I'll put 1 cup of sugar instead 1 1/4 cup.  Made 18 small muffins.

As I write this I am baking the muffins so I haven't yet sampled them. But they do smell and look amazingly delicious. I did add a bit more milk, about 1/4 cup. I didn't have cubed butter either for the crubble, I only had margarine that is  very soft. So what I did was made it the way the recipe says and then I added about 1/8 cup more flour, sprinkled a bit more white sugar, and added a bunch of rolled oats(about 1/4 to 1/2 a cup). Then I rubbed the mixture in my hands until it crumbled. 

Overall I think this is a  amazing recipe and will definetly use again =) Kudos

These turned out great.  I first tried them about a year and a half ago and took them to work.  Everyone at work loved these and asked for the recipe.  Which, I directed them to this site.  I made these for Christmas in 2008.  My family loved them.  This Christmas my neices and nephews were eager to have these for the holidays this year (2009) and were disappointed when I didn't make them.  Needless to say, I think next year I'l make it a tradition to bake these for the famiy for the holidays.
The only thing that prevents me from making these is the prep time.  I prefer to have fresh apples that I've cored and peeled.  This takes a lot of time.  Therefore, it's a once a year recipe that I'll do in BIG batches.  Will see if there is an easier way to prep the apples for the future.

These muffins were fantastic! The reviews always help me choose a good recipe and this is one of them. I happened to use a regular size muffin tin and made 18 muffins but they didn't last 2 days. My boyfriend had eaten 8 in one night. And one of the tips I followed was to use 1 cup sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also decided to add a dash of nutmeg and ginger to the crumb topping. Now everyone wants me to make them their own personal batch!

Wow - these are amazing! Instead of slicing the apples, I chopped them so you get cubes of apple in every bite. They are so moist they don't need any butter at all - even three days later! Great recipe!

I made these over the weekend for a potluck brunch that I hosted and they were a huge hit! I had to whip up another batch because people could not get enough. Since I was pressed for time, I did not make the streussel, but they were wonderful without it. The only change I made was using almond extract because I was out of vanilla. Absolutely wonderful! These will be in regular rotation in my home.

Delish!  I chopped the apples instead of slicing, and used Almonds instead of Walnuts because that's what I had.  Baked them in regular size muffin tins (got 16 muffins) and they came out light and tastey.  Excellent recipe.

These were good, but I am pretty sure I messed them up...I didnt have butter so I used apple sauce...I didnt have milk so I used butter milk...and I added a smashed banana.  With all of that they were still good, they were gone in a day, but I think if I had made them as the recipe is they would have been wonderful.

This recipe was great!!!! The muffins were very moist and fluffy! I diced my apples and used half brown sugar hlaf white sugar for the topping. The only thing I would change is to use less sugar in the batter! Overall, a wonderful recipe I will use over and over!!!

These were really good, just a tad bland. To make them a bit more healthy, I used half whole wheat flour, half regular, and substituted half of the oil with applesauce. I also used half brown sugar, half white, and added a dash of nutmeg. This is the kind of muffin I don't feel guilty eating.

Great recipe. Made with mini muffin pan and the muffins were flat (new can of powder). Made again in bunt pan and it was perfect. Baked for 55 minutes, no nuts, added nutmeg and chopped apples to bite size.

Although not light and fluffy (I put in 4 apples -- chopped fine), these were delicious and a hit with everyone in the family.  Great breakfast after a morning swim at the Y.  I reduced the shortening and used half applesauce to intensify the flavors and save some fat.

These are great,very fluffy and moist.  I made them without the topping to save calories and they are still delicious.  I also used a smaller muffin pan and freezed the leftovers.

These were great! I made regular sized muffins, since I don't have a jumbo pan, and it made a dozen plus about 6-9 mini-muffins. The only things I did different, was I chopped the apples instead of just slicing them, and I got lazy and didn't do the topping, just sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar. I'm sure the topping would make these even better! Oh, I also didn't add the walnuts because we don't really care for them.

I've made smaller muffins than the recipe called for. Did not want an extra amount of butter in my muffins, so i omitted the topping and sprinkled each muffin with brown sugar. The flavor was great, but they didn't rise very much, even after i added extra baking powder.... hmmmmmmm, fluffy and delicious anyway!!

I omit the walnuts cause the husband doesn't like them.

When it comes time for the apples, I just cut them freehand over the mixing bowl into dice size.  Its not a big deal if they are bigger than that, it just means you get more yummy chunks of apple in each bite.

I can't believe I am capable of making such delish muffins!! All thanks to Jen for posting this marvellous recipe. Minimal changes on my part: sub butter with oil; used part plain and self raising flour. I was pretty liberal with cinnamon and nutmeg myself :)

These tasted wonderful.  The only change I made was grating some of the apples and slicing the rest based on another reviews recommendation.  The crumb didn't come out right for me so I'll have to try making a change on that next time.  If you have lots of apples on hand and would like to make something tasty with them, this is a great recipe.

These muffins were just what I was looking for. I shared them with a neighbor, and she just loved them as well.  Thanks for sharing a great muffin recipe that is moist and delicious.

Awesome muffins, everyone loved them. I added a bit more cinnamon then was called for, also a bit more apple...I would probably add a even more next time. Other then that, wonderful! (I do have to say they tasted much better the second day.)

Fantastic! I'm really picky when it comes to muffins, and I'm not a very good baker - but these came out wonderfully flavorful and moist, and everybody at work loved them. I left out the cinnamon topping, used only 1 cup of white sugar, and 1/4 c margarine + 1/4 c butter.

Yummy! I added craisins and reduced the sugar to 1 C. These were great.

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't add walnuts OR the buttery topping and used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light, but it was still great!  They were moist, easy to make, and can handle substitutions, (such as whole wheat flour instead of white.)  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I plan on making them again, and again, and...

quite good and simple to make. i liked it better without the topping. also the apples mostly sunk to the bottom so the distribution was not even.

This recipe was terrific. I needed a quick muffin for guests. I followed suggestions of 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Excellent flavor and texture. Very moist. Will try with only 1 cup sugar, just a little sweet. I used what apples I had which were Red Delicious. A tarter apple would probably need the 1 1/4 cup sugar.

I must have done something wrong as I could not get these out of the pan. I did substitute whole wheat flour for white. I wonder if that could be the problem? They still tasted great.
