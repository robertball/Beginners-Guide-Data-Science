Great potato salad for those who love red potatoes like I do. I added about a tablespoon each of dill relish and mustard though. Hint: cook the potatoes kind of slowly so the outside isn't too soft and the inside isnt' too crunchy, ,like mine were the first time!

Since I found this recipe a month ago, I've made it at least 6 times (mainly for family & neighborhood get-togethers).  It's received rave reviews at all.  I love that you don't have to peel the potatoes.  This saves alot of time if you're preparing for a larger crowd.  I would suggest salting the potatoes before boiling and increasing the salt/pepper seasoning X 2.  Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  This will be a staple in my collection.  A perfect, creamy, crunchy potato salad.

This recipe turned out wonderfully.  Having read the reviews, I added bacon, dill and red pepper to the mix and thought it tasted superb.  I also used apple cider vinegar in place of distilled white, and wonder if red wine vinegar might also be yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

An all time family favorite - with one change. I eliminate the vinegar and milk, and add granulated garlic (or garlic powder) to taste. We're not fond of vinegar in our potato salad, and the additional garlic flavor makes the dish! I've also made this dish using regular potatoes - peeled, and finely chopped yellow onions in place of green onions. It's very good! I usually top with a sprinkling of paprika, parsley flakes and halved, hard-boiled eggs for presentation. Everyone asks for the recipe!

I don't even like potato salad and I liked this one! I was instructed to bring p. salad to a cookout so I grabbed this recipe. Added bacon bits and shredded cheddar cheese, and it was a huge hit! This is now my designated dish at gatherings! Thanks for changing my mind about potato salad :)

I made some changes to modify our taste.  With these changes, I think this is a great recipe and simple too.  I omitted the eggs (don't care for eggs).  I reduced mayo by 1/2.  I added more green onions.  I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed and 1/4 teaspoon dill.              Also, needed more salt than recipe stated.  Per all recipes' cooking potatoes tips, my potatoes were the perfect texture.  I left the skins on cut them into bite-size chunks.  Place them in a pot and cover them with water.  Bring to a boil and salt the water.  Keep the pot at a gentle boil and cook for approx. 8-15 minutes until tender and drain.  Cool potatoes by spreading them on a baking sheet in a single layer.  I never liked making potatoe salad because I'd either have hard or mushy potatoes.  If you follow the cooking steps, I think you'll have perfectly cooked potatoes.

I was attracted to this recipe because I love green onions and prefer red potatoes to others. I took some suggestions from the Summer Potato Salad recipe on this site: I replaced the vinegar in this recipe with lemon juice, and the salt with seasoned salt. To cut down on the mayo I used 1/3 plain yogurt instead. I don't think the yogurt made a difference in the taste. But I thought it needed more flavor when I tried it so I did add a few tablespoons of dijon mustard, a lot of fresh parsley, and some salt. It turned out well.

This potato salad was bland, bland, bland.  I didn't even have to ask my husband what he thought of it - his face told all!  He said it was a little bit better with some mustard in it, but it still wasn't that good.  The only good thing about it was that it improved with age.  2 days later it tasted much better.

This recipe is nearly identical to my mother's - it has been a hit at family gatherings for years. Even folks who don't normally eat leftovers manage to spirit away some of it away! (I'm one of those who hate mayo and eggs, but go figure - this is one of my favorite dishes!) Ours doesn't have the celery, and, for those who find the recipe here too bland, we use a fair amount of cayenne powder. When we were children, there were two bowls of this - one with Best Foods mayonnaise, and one with Miracle Whip. Now we're all happy with the Best foods version. Oh, and ours has about a tablespoon of prepared mustard. I agree with those who prefer to cube the potatoes first, it is quite difficult to get red potatoes cooked through and still retain the peel otherwise. Someone suggested sprinkling the salt, pepper, and vinegar on the potatoes while they are still warm - I think that is an excellent idea, but would only work if they had been cubed prior to cooking. I guess what I would suggest for those who have offered less than five stars is this: potato salad is a very traditional, familial dish. If you find a recipe too bland, or it lacks or includes ingredients which aren't your preference, tweak the recipe to suit yourself. This particular recipe has excellent proportions, and is a terrific base for your preferences. Great recipe!

I cut back on the mayonnaise a little. I just added it by the half cup until it looked about right. For our family, this potato salad was a great base but we think it needs a little "oomph". I'd make this again but I'd add some spices next time.

Brand new favorite in our house.  We do find it's too much mayo so we add it to taste.  Also, try it with red wine vinegar instead of white.  It's an amazing transformation.

This is absolutely the best potato salad I have ever eaten!  Incredible!  I modified it ever so slightly, adding only a splash of milk and vinegar rather than the full amount called for.  I also used half sour cream and half mayo.  I also added celery salt, onion powder, parsley, and garlic powder and used only egg whites.  It actually tasted like a homemade ranch dressing, so good!!!  I took it to my family reunion and there were no leftovers.  I will never again make another potato salad--thanks for an amazing recipe!!!!!

I add 3 tablespoons of Dijon Mustard, one bunch of scallons and 1 box of pre-cooked bacon.
I put the potatoes and a large mixing bowl and add the chopped up scallons. I microwave the bacon and set aside 4 pieces. Next I crumble up the bacon and put it in the bowl and mix. 
Next I add the dijon mustard to the mayo mixture , mix it into the potatoes, add the eggs and mix again. Finally I pour the potato salad into a dish and top with the remaining crumbled bacon. I have attached a pic as well.

As with all recipes on this site, I make it a habit to read reviews before I start. This is what I did, I cut the vinegar & milk in half added hard boiled egg white (no yolk)a Tbs. of Miracle Whip, half a dill pickle, a squirt of mustard and a couple shakes of celery seed. My 10 and 12 yr old daughters are not picky eaters, they do however have their opinions, they absolutely LOVED it.

This is a great recipe and close to what I have been looking for.  I cut the potatoes before cooking and added a tbs. of vinegar while cooking.  This keeps the potatoes firm after cooking.  I supstituted yellow mustard for the vinegar and it turned out like I wanted.  The oringinal recipe was fine but I had to adjust to what I was looking for.

Absolutely delicious! I decided to make potato salad for our July 4th dinner and I found this recipe and decided to try it. I was a little scared though, since some of the people reviewing it said that it was missing things, etc. but I didn't find this to be true at all. I stuck to the recipe 100% and I only had a tiny bit left at the end of the night. I'll definitely make this again and again!

Delicious.  As with all mayo-type potato salads, be careful not to overcook the potatoes - like I did.

This was great. I had a little problem with getting the potatoes just right, but the sauce was delicious. I will definitely make this again with cooking my potatoes longer.
Thanks for the recipe!!!!

So wonderful!  I read the reviews and added 4 chopped hard-boiled eggs and 1 lb. cooked bacon. I also used Red-Wine Vinegar. It was super!  Everyone just loved it.  It is great as a side dish on those hot summer days when you are grilling out and don't want to heat up the oven.

This is now my favorite potato salad and I make it for parties and holidays. I add chopped dill pickles, finely chopped red onion, and sprinkle paprika on top. It's delicious!

This is one of my favorite potato salad recipes.  One comment is that you need to keep it cold.  It doesn't really taste all that great warm.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks for the post.

This is a great recipe.  I used cider vinegar in place of the white distilled vinegar and used half low-fat mayonnaise and half regular mayonnaise.  My whole family loved it.

This salad came out great!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white and added diced red peppers for color.  I also added a little bit of fresh dill.  Yum!

Made a few modifications: I used dijon mustard in place of the milk, rice vinegar in place of white, added a couple more eggs, and used miracle whip light.  Held up nicely for several days.  Very good traditional recipe.

My husband thinks I am the queen of potato salad thanks to this recipe.  It is very good.  I don't use green onions, I use chopped sweet ones instead.  I also add diced dill pickles and a little mustard.  Yummy!

Excellent!  My family loved this easy, easy, easy potato salad.  My advice:  if you follow the recipe, as is, add some sugar to counter balance the vinegar.

YUMMY!

This recipe is incredibly easy, but tastes awesome! A few simple adjustments on my end (more onion, no celery), but I loved it. I like not having to peel the potatoes, and the red gives it some color!

This was a very good base recipe. I feel that it needs more vinegar and perhaps some herbs (dill?) to liven it up. Having said that, this is the type of potato salad that I prefer and I will make it again with modifications. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very bland, even after I added dill. Absolutely way too much mayonnaise - unless you really like it - and I had cut it in half. If I make this again, I would definitely add garlic, fresh herbs (dill or maybe tarragon?) and possibly some mustard - it really needs something.

This is a very good potato salad. I didn't have green onion so I used yellow onion instead and I used about a 1-2 teaspoons of sugar to tone down the bitterness of the vinegar as suggested by a previous review.  I think next time I will use less vinegar and less mayo, but otherwise a very good recipe.

Y-U-HUMMY! This is an excellent basic recipe for Potato salad...I cooked my potatoes a little longer so they were firm but soft in the centre, and I added a little dill...its was awesome.  I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!

I tried this recipe and I have to admit, the potatoes were a bit too firm. I know I should have cooked them longer than 15 min and I will add at least 5 more min to the cook time. Aside from that, the flavor was great and the prep was easy. I am going to give it one more try before I bring it too an event.

I am not going to give this any less then five stars because I only used the recipe as a general guide to make potato salad. So I will just leave you with some info. I used regular baking potatos since the red ones at the store didnt look apealing. I used a couple eggs and maybe half a celery sliced super thin for a little crunch. I used salt, pepper, celery seeds,dill, and mustard powder. Combined with mayo and a dash of milk and lemon juice and a little squirt of regular mustard. This turned out very good and easy to make. Dont be intimidated to improvise when making potato salad. I found if you taste the seasonings before adding them to the potatos you can gage what is laking or needs adjusting. Good luck! Happy eating!

I took the advice of Roxy52278 on this one... I added a Tablespoon each of mustard and relish as was suggested. Also, because we love green olives, I choppped up a handful of them and added those as well. I served it yesterday with our 4th of July spread and everyone loved it. This is a definite keeper!

Great recipe! I'm giving it four stars since I took the recommended changes and will also do some more the next time around. First, my tweaks as per other reviewers: I used one cup of mayo, one cup of green onions, one tablespoon dijon mustard, one tablespoon of w'shire sauce ... but kept everything else the same. The dressing, initially, tasted overwhelmingly like onions but it was plenty to cover the potatoes. I figured the flavors would settle overnight. Next day, I tasted and the salad was actually sort of bland! I was surprised. I added in at least another teaspoon or two of salt and pepper and a bunch of paprika. I was thinking I'd add more dijon mustard or w'shire next time and I may have to go through and read other reviewers and see what they did!

This is good!  Everyone liked it when I took it to a cookout.  I add a "squirt" of dijon mustard to it for a little different flavor.  I sometimes also add relish.  Yummm!

This was great!  Brought it to a 4th of July party and got a ton of compliments.  Note: I used only 1/2 cup of mayo (because that's all I had) and it was low fat and it was still great!  No need to pile on the extra calories and fat if you don't need to.  It will still be great.

This is my first time making potato salad, and it turned out great. A little tart though, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and I used sweet relish instead of celery.
Higly recommended recipe!

This is a great recipe. I made it pretty much as is, but I did take some of the suggestions in other reviews and added a little dry mustard and some bacon bits. I also added a little Cajun seasoning to add some zip. I'm taking it to a cookout tomorrow -- can't wait to hear the compliments. Thanks for the recipe!

This is very similar to one I've been making for years, but I don't add vinegar or milk.  Red Potatoes, Eggs, Mayo, Red Onion, Celery chopped, and chopped radishes.  I've gotten a lot of compliments and its my only sure dish.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used balsamic vinegar which gave the salad a wonderful flavour.  Also doubled the salt/pepper, added a couple of finely chopped dill pickles, and topped
with paprika for colour.  Everyone loved it and I'm making it again tonight!

Good potato salad, would add some bacon next time.  Would give it a little more flavor.  I also added dill.

I don't make potato salad that often because I never seem to have a great recipe. They are always just so so. This was really good. I made half of the recipe. I used about 1 lb. of potatoes and red wine vinegar in place of the white. I think it could have used a little more mayo so I added some Miracle Whip to change it up. I skipped the eggs just to save time. In place of the green onions I used McCormick Minced Onion Blend. I was only able to refrigerate this about an hour so I'm betting it will be great tomorrow. Two thumbs up here.

Easy since you don't have to peel the potatoes.  I used regular size (not baby) red potatoes, and they needed to boil 22-25 minutes.  I left out the eggs, added dry dill and parsley for some color and flavor.  Made the day ahead--it was a little dry the next day, so added some mayo and milk to make it creamier.  It is a delicious basic potato salad---will definitely make again.

WOW!  I finally found a recipe that tops my mom's potato salad.  I added a small amount of bacon to this and it was perfect.  There is nothing I would change.

I love this potato salad recipe.  I veganized it and friends didn't even know the difference.  (i.e. use vegan subs. for mayo/dairy and skip eggs) I also use lemon juice and a little cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar and add some grey poupon and I think adding the mustard is what makes it.  I also sprinkle some parsley and paprika over the top to make it pretty.

As is, this is OK. I found it to be pretty bland, personally. But with these modifications, it was great!! I mixed some grey poupon in with the mayo mixture and added dill and a little garlic salt to give it the kick it seemed to be missing.

it was a great creamy potato salad. as is it was a little bland so i cut down the mayo by 1/2c and subbed sour cream and added extra garlic and spice to my taste. overall very good basic recipe that you can elaborate to your own style.

This recipe is GREAT! It gets great reviews from everyone and I love it for the simplicity.  I followed some of the other reviews & added salt when boiling the potatoes and doubled the amount of salt & pepper in the mix.  Tastes just as good without the green onions too.

This was a very good creamy potato salad, only thing I did different was to add crumbled bacon and also 1-1/2 tblsp. chipotle mustard. Gave it a kick of flavor. Also replaced green onion with red onion. Delicious.

This is the best I've had!! I always thought my Mother made the best, but must change my mind. I didn't even get a chance to refrigerate finished product before my family starting digging in. My husband said it was better than his grandmother's. A must have for any recipe box!! Thank's for sharing.

I thought this potato salad was good but not great.  I much prefer more of a vinegar taste in my potato salad and I didn't think there was enough in this recipe.  Next time I will tweak a bit and add apple cider vinegar and add it to potatoes when warm to absorb more of the flavor.  I used less mayo and eggs then called for, and still thought it was a bit much.  Overall people liked this at my last cookout, so I will give it 4 stars.

The combination of ingredients is nice, but when I made this, the overall taste was too mild.  I will make this again, but with WAY more salt/vinegar.

Very very good. I was scraping the bottom of my mayo jar, didn't have a full 1 1/2c. but it didn't ruin a thing. I did add a tiny bit of powdered Keen's Mustard (with a tiny bit of milk). I also used white wine vinegar as I was too lazy to fetch the regular from the basement. A simple, quick and tasty recipe especially if you are pressed for time in the preparation. I did the potatoes and eggs earlier in the day and when I was ready to mix together - it was in the fridge in less than 30 min. & with plenty of time to get cold before the BBQ. Most assuredly on my repeat list.

This was great! I did a tiny bit of tweaking (omitted eggs, added 1 tsp dry mustard powder, sub'd lemon juice for the vinegar, and used half Miracle Whip as someone else suggested). Diced potatos before boiling. Sorry if I changed it "too much"! but this isn't the way I normally make potato sald so thank you for the idea. Very simple and turned out fantastic. Was better the next day.

I love potato salad and this was delicious! I did not add any vinegar, I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I overcooked the potatoes a bit but it didn't take anything away from it all. Yummy!

I had been looking for a great red potato salad recipe and this is exactly what I wanted!  I pretty much followed the recipe as it's written with only a few modifications: I added a little sugar since it was a little tart from the mayonaise and vinegar, used half mayo - half Miracle Whip (salad dressing) to help take away some of the tartness, apple cider vinegar, extra salt and pepper, seasoned salt, and a little extra green onion and celery for more flavor and crunch.  My mother, who is a brutal food critic, loves it and ORDERS me to make this for every family occasion!  My church members also fell in love with it and are still asking me for the recipe!

This is the perfect potato salad recipe ~ Truly it is. Hellman's is the choice mayo for it and I used vidalias instead of green onions. Delicious! And as Americana as a recipe can get :)

Perfect! When you think of red potato salad, this is what you are thinking of. I added a smidge of dill as others suggested, and used a bit more celery and green onion. I also used light mayo. The dressing was the perfect amount. Thanks for this one!

This was fantastic.  I left out the hard boiled egg since I'm not a fan and used water instead of milk since we were having a dairy free guest.  I made this a day ahead and it tasted great!

I don't make potato salad cause it never comes out good but this was fantastic. I made this for my sons graduation party and had many compliments! I added a squirt of yellow mustard to it to give a little extra flavor. The second time I made this I did not cook the potatoes enough, so make sure they are cooked enough.

This potato salad is great. I love it. I use russet potatoes because it's what I have on hand. I think it's the vinegar that makes it so yummy. And I use miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.

This is the easiest, best potato salad I've ever made.  It's even soooooo much better than Ina Garten's ... and I absolutely love Ina!  First made this for July 4th and the family absolutely loved it!  I'm making it again tonight!  If you like classic red potato salad you will LOVE this recipe!

For my first attempt, I made this for a barbecue that I was invited to and everyone loved it.  I didn't have the distilled white vinegar so I had to substitute rice vinegar and it was still wonderful.  This will be the only potato salad that I will be making. Thanks Dwagner!!

Great results. I used Vadalia Onion in place of green onions (personal choice). Store had no small size red potato available. Worked fine with large size. I cut them before boiling..

This is my new go to potato salad recipe.  The scallions give it a mild onion flavor, which we perfer over diced raw onion in many other recipes.

Once again, Allrecipes delivers!  I made this potato salad for 80 people at a work BBQ.  Followed the recipe exactly and got more compliments than I can count.  This is a great potato salad for a crowd because it isn't heavy on any one flavor.  People said it is great basic potato sald without all the fluff people tend to put in these days.

After all the great reviews I was surprised that I was so disappointed with this salad. The only change I made was to cut back the mayo by 1/2 cup and substitute with 1/2 cup of sour cream. With a better dressing this would have been good, but it tasted very greasy and oily to me. Not one I'll be making again.

As written, this recipe is simple, straightforward yet excellent potato salad. The proportions of potatoes to dressing on this recipe are very good, so it is easy to use it as a base and then change it up depending on your preferences. Add in bacon or fresh herbs for a more little pizzaz.

I made this yesterday for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit. I forgot to grab green onions the night before while I was at the store and substituted the green onion for red onion.  This was very good and everyone ranted and raved about how delicious this was.

A bit bland for my tastes but a good basic recipe for when you are serving a group people and aren't quite sure what their tastes are.  It is also looks nice on the plate.  I crumbled some bacon into the salad.  Next time I will add a squirt of spicy mustard.  I think it will give it a nice kick.

This was a HUGE hit at a potluck I brought it to, got a compliment from everyone! I only used one cup of mayo and added minced garlic, bacon and shredded cheddar cheese. I boiled the potatoes slow as another reviewer recommended. When they were done boiling, I cut them in half and spread the potatoes open on a cookie sheet and put them in the fridge to cool faster. The way this recipe asks you to cook the eggs is weird though, I tried it and my eggs were still a bit uncooked. Still an awsome tasting recipe!!

I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out great (except for the potatoes that weren't cooked enough despite the fact that I boiled them for 20 minutes). Modifications: Added 1 tbsp of mustard and 1 tsp of Worchestershire.

I loved this potato salad.  I did make some of the changes that other people did: less mayo, more green onion and s&p and spicy mustard. It was delicious!

This was the first time I ever made potato salad. I got really good feedback from everyone. I didn't use all of the mayo (just used one cup). Also, I added bacon.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his crew at work for lunch.  The bowl was empty in minutes!  They all said it was the best potato salad they ever had...a few of them even wanted me to call their wives with the recipe!
Thanks for the best potato salad recipe.

This was very bland, even though I followed others' suggestions and used 1 tsp. of seasoned salt instead of the 1/2 tsp. salt, doubled the pepper, added 1 T. dijon mustard, used 5 eggs, and added crumbled bacon bits.  I only used 1 cup of mayo and that was ample.

I liked this recipe very much and I like changing it up even more.  To make this salad more interesting, try adding 1 green apple, green grapes, and shredded carrots.  Chop these ingredients very small and mix them in the salad.  If you really want to be brave, try adding some chopped pineapple!  Verrrrry refreshing salad.

I made this for my father-in-laws birthday party. Everyone liked it. The only thing I did different was to add a little mustard for color. Once I added some sliced radishes. This is a keeper.

If I were to prepare this salad again, I would cut the "Vinegar" down to  a 1/2 TBS. The excess vinegar masked the flavors of the other ingredients. Otherwise it was a good easy recipe.

I thought this was great- DH said it was a 4 because it had too much sauce and not enough pepper.  I mixed the dressing and poured it on the potatoes while they were still hot.  In the future, I will add celery seeds because that's how my grandmother does it!  This recipe was a lot like hers and, boy, was it good!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I did make a few modifications: Ommitted the milk and eggs (hubby dosen't like them), used 1 cup of mayo, some bread and butter pickle juice, 1TBS of vinegar, and some garlic powder.  It was a nice basic potato salad recipe and had a nice flavor that was not over powering.  Great for a cookout since it is not your typical mayo and mustard salad.

FINALLY!, a recipe for good old fashioned potato salad.  Didn't change a thing and it came out perfect...well, so our family and friends said on Saturday.  I, too, had to stop myself from sampling so there'd be enough for our BBQ...lol.

Excellent starter recipe and easy to customize!  I cut down on mayo (about 3/4 cup) and added extra green onion, green pepper and black olives - just my personal preference.  I've made it twice for cookouts and come home with an empty bowl both times...my husband's friends love it!

This is a great old fashioned creamy base, but lacked depth of flavor. I added about 2 T of german-style mustard, some chopped chives and flat leaf parsely. Wonderful.

This is similar to the potato salad Mom used to make with a few tweaks.  I left out the eggs and used yellow onion.  I also used sea salt and rice wine vinegar which seems milder to me.  Husband loved it!

This made an excellent potato salad.  However, after about 2 days the dish gets a strong celery/onion flavor that many find unappealing.  There is an easy solution: eat it up quickly!  Which shouldn't be a problem because this household loves potato salad.

Really good all-around recipe.  I would reccomend cubing the potatoes first, and then seasoning the warm, cooked potatoes with vinegar, S & P.  (it absorbs flavor well at this point) Good porportions of mayo mixture to potatoes.

This was really very good! Reminded me of the potato salad my grandmother would make for our Sunday barbecues when I was a kid. It could use a little something though. Maybe some fresh parsley or basil! Or maybe try some sweet relish!

15 minutes of potato cooking wasn't long enough, cooked it 30 minutes.  And I added 1 tablespoon pickle juice, and 2 large diced pickles.  I thought it was a great and simple recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! I looked this recipe up when I had some red potatoes to use up and wanted something different than my usual mustard/pickle relish potato salad. I did add a squirt of mustard as another reviewer suggested but otherwise made just as written. This will definitely be going into my regular rotation.

My husband and his best friend ask for this potato salad every time we go camping or BBQ. It's very easy to make. The only thing different I do is add Dill pickles then it's perfect.

I used about 3.5 lbs of regularly sized red potatoes (cubed to bite size pieces, started with cold water with a tbs of white vinegar and boiled 8 minutes until just done) and red onion (what I had).  I did not think the cup of celery nor half cup of onion was enough, so I added more until it looked right for our tastes.  I used light mayo and made 1.5 times the dressing with about a tablespoon of mustard added in.  This is a great base recipe and easily modified to suit your family's taste and what you have on hand.  Definitely reminded me of my grandmother's potato salad but was a bit lighter in taste (light mayo).  Make the day ahead if possible because it is much more flavorful the second day.

Thought I should post a review after using this recipe so many times. This is a very good basic recipe as posted, but I add 1 t. spicy mustard, 1 T. sugar, and 1/2 t. dill weed to make it classicly great (amounts if not doubling/tripling recipe). Huge hit everywhere I take it!

This is the best 'red' potatol salad recipe that I've found.  I took it to a baby shower & received lots of compliments!  The only changes that I made were that I used 6 eggs, sweet onions, a little more salt, & I omitted the celery.  Excellent recipe!

I mostly threw together my own dressing (I hate measuring stuff). But I used the cooking method with this recipe and it was perfect. I have tried before to make potato salad, and it always ended up too mushy. Nobody ever specified "tender but firm" before! One of those tips I will always remember now. Thanks so much.

Really delicious potato salad. Tip: Make sure you yourself allow plenty of time for the potatoes to cool. The salad definitely took much more time to prepare than I expected. I think it took me a good 45 minutes to make before the refrigerating. Also, I skipped the eggs and added crumbled, cooked bacon. The final product was delicious :)

Made potato salad for the first time in my life and it was a hit out of the park!
Use six eggs.  Use olive oil mayo (a little less than required), make up the difference with sour cream (2-3 tbsp.).  Use red wine vinegar.  Use more than a 1/2 c. of green onions if they are bland, will try red onions next time.  Needs way more salt than 1/2 tsp. and I used garlic salt and regular salt to taste.  Add freshly chopped dill and start with a couple tbsp., then add to taste.  Add fresh parsley to taste.  Squirt with some fresh lemon juice, don't over do this.  Made the night before, flavors melded perfectly by the next day. it was the only thing that we ran out of at the BBQ...YUM!

This is a great recipe. I replace the vinegar with dill pickle juice. The entire family hates onions so that was a know-go also.

Needs more flavor! this is a good base, but even doubling the salt and pepper didn't do enough. I added fresh thyme and two more eggs. I think next time I will add some Dijon mustard.

Really good. I did use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar because that is what I had. Other than that, made it as directed. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Made potato salad for the first time in my life and I just love this one. I did chop up a couple small dill pickles and add to it and a little galic powder but other than that the exact same thing and it is good.

Took advice and used red wine vinegar. Also didn't have green onions. Used white onion, but only 1/4 cup or so. Still turned out really well. I think the green onions would be best, but this was still very tasty.

Good old-fashioned potato salad.  Tastes even better the second day.  I used low fat mayo to reduce the calories.

This was my first time to make potato salad and it turned out great. I halved the recipe, omitted the milk and vinegar, and added a few tablespoons of mustard, a tsp of garlic powder, and chopped up bread and butter pickles.  I served it warm with BBQ pork steaks and a salad.  Yum!

This turned out very well. I omitted the white vinegar, and added some Dijon mustard and a couple tablespoons of Miracle Whip because I like the little bit of tang it adds. I also added some finely diced white onion, red bell pepper, a bit of paprika, garlic powder, and just a tiny bit of cumin for some spice. My husband prefers it with some bacon, but I'm not a big fan, so I've made it both with and without, so I guess it just depends on your preference.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, except my potatoes needed to be cooked just a bit longer. My family really enjoyed it including a guest who said he never really liked potato salad previously.  If you like highly seasoned food then you might find this bland.  I enjoyed the subtle flavor of all the ingredients. My husband said it was the best potato salad he had ever tasted.  Thank you DWAGNER!

I dont have family living near by so I cut this recipe down to third. I used what I have in the house. No celery ,red onion instead of green. I gave only 3 stars because it was kind of bland. I added more salt ......vineger and still not tasty enough. Ill come back if I find the right ingredent to put in. Maybe like the other reviewer days it needs to sit for 2 days.

Loved this recipe. I cooked the potatoes about 7 minutes longer because I found that 15 min. still left them a little a crunchy. Made it a little healthier using light mayo and bac-o's. Still tasted delicious and got lots of compliments.

Nice simple fresh potato salad.  I added some finely sliced red onion and a bit of paprika too.  Not a huge fan of eggs, so I only used 2 - chopped them until they were almost crumbs and used them as a topping.  will make this again.

I made this by boiling peeled and sliced sweet potato and Holland potato (which went on sale last week) separately to ensure perfect potato tenderness. Followed recipe to T. but added bacon, 1/2 tsp of paprika and 1 tsp of sweet relish for added flavour. The taste is rather like normal potato salad even with my added ingredients... missing the "WOW" factor.

This is a really easy recipe. I added a about a 1/2 cup of Italian dresing to give it some more flavor and it turned out awesome! I will keep this recipe probably just add Italian dressing mix (in powder form) the next time I use this recipe to keep things a little healthier.

This is the best recipe. I have been using this recipe since 2002 - I cook my potatoes a little longer and chop them into bite size pieces. I add a couple extra eggs - for my dad! It always gets rave reviews every time I make it, and I get asked to make it many times!

This was just okay.  A very basic potato salad recipe.  But, not great unless you add to it.  Mine turned out pretty good with some additions, but the recipe as is, is kind of bland.

Wonderful recipe! Very easy to make and delicious. I'm new to making potato salad from scratch and it was a breeze to whip up. The only change I made was I only used one stalk of celery, chopped up, since neither my husband or I are very fond of it. Would recommend!

I made this for a family BBQ and everyone really liked it.  It was a nice change from the mustard version one of use usually makes!

I was looking for an alternative to the classic yellow potato salad.  I enjoyed the red potatoes.  I didn't have celery so added onion salt instead. Following other suggestions, I cut the potatoes before boiling for 15 min and they turned out perfectly. I also added 1 tablespoon of sweet relish and 1/2 tsp of mustard powder.  I liked this recipe, but I don't think it's quite perfect yet.

This is a great basic potato salad. Quick and easy. I followed the directions to a tee. Next time I would add two more eggs, two Tbs of prepared mustard, and some additional salt. All and all a great starting base.

Love this recipe.  I have made it several times in the past three weeks.  I have only changed two things -- I added a dash of mustard and reduced the mayo just a bit.

Doesn't get much better. I followed the preportions in recipe, which were near perfect. Subed half mayo for sour cream. Used heavy cream for milk. Red onion. 

I could easily have stopped here because it tasted so good. I just have a hard time following directions, so, I added a touch of Worchester sauce, mustard, fresh dill, and cyanne pepper.

I loved this receipe but more important, my husband also loved it. I added bacon bits and shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I didn't have any celery so I increased the green onions and added celery seed. I thought it was perfect!

I don't eat P-Salad personally, but I made this for a BBQ and it got rave reviews. Based off other recipes I added a little celery salt & ground mustard (1/2 tsp of each) and some crumbled bacon. Based off all the feedback I'd say this is a def keeper.

Great, quick and easy to make, went over great.  Added more salt while boiling and boiled a little longer at a lower temp.  Added dill pickles minced, a little pickle juice, some fresh ground pepper, and a bit of mustard.  Fantastic!

I hated potato salad until this recipe came along. It's the only one I will eat. My husband gets me to make it just so he can take it in his lunch. We make it just as the recipe says. Super big hit!

This was an all around great potatoe salad recipe. It was my first time making it but it tasted delicious. One thing to do is to leave yourself plenty of time to make this or make it the day before. I misjudged how long it would take the potatoes and eggs to cool.

I have tried soooo many potato salad recipes and every single one of them would be missing something . . .but this one has it all.  Great texture, great flavor, not too much mayo.  I did add some dill, but other than that it was perfect.  I took it to a barbeque and my friends have already requested it twice more since then.

I made this for the first time on Memorial Day when having folks over for the first time... probably not a good idea to make an untested recipe but the user reviews were just too good.  WE LOVED IT!  My guests loved it, my husband loved it, I loved it.  My guests asked for the recipe! I just made another batch just for us.  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe.  I didn't change a thing!

The mayo mixture to this is great...I did not have red potatoes, just made potato salad from what potatoes I did have and mixed the mayo and seasonings into and it is by far the BEST my family has tasted.  We will never go back to our old recipe!!!

This was a good potato salad recipe, but I made a minor change.  I used yukon gold potatoes instead of red and I omitted the celery as I'm not a fan; instead I used celery salt.  This was good and we'll probably make it again, but next time I will reduce the amount of mayonnaise to about 2/3 cup.

I love potato salad but never knew how to make it.  This is my first one and it turned out so great!  Per other reviews, I used mustard instead of milk and doubled the eggs, and made dressing in a separate bowl before pouring over.  Its great!

EVERYTIME I FIND A NEW POTATO SALAD RECIPE, I TEND TO CHOOSE ONE WITH SIMILAR INGREDIENTS. HOWEVER, THIS ONE STILL TASTES NEW & DIFFERENT. VERY POTATOEY, FRESH & DELICIOUS. IT'S PRETTY MUCH MY POTATO SALAD EXCEPT THIS USES SMALL POTATOES, & GREEN ONIONS RATHER THAN REGULAR ONIONS, & LOTS MORE CELERY---LESS EGG. WELL IT'S A KEEPER WITH JUST THOSE FEW CHANGES THAT DIANE HAS! THANKS FOR THE NEW TWIST DIANE!

My family loved this potato salad!  I ommitted the vinegar because none of us care for a vinegary taste.  I also added a bit more salt.  This recipe was very simple and a great side for burgers or barbecue!

Very good, very simple.  I substituted a Walla Walla sweet onion for the green onions--yummy!

I was looking for a different variation of a potato salad in place of the ordinary one that everyone makes, so I decided to try this recipe for the fourth of July party and not one person asked for the recipe or said that they like it. It was O.K. but very bland. I made it exactly like the recipe called for only I doubled it to serve 12 people. I won't be making it again.

Delicious. I recieved rave reviews from my guests when I served this. I used baking potatoes instead because they were what I had. I also added a teaspoon of paprika and another one of dry mustard as suggested by other reviewers. Makes great left overs too.

I pulled this recipe at my wife's request. She made it (exactly as the recipe directed) for her relatives (5 adults, 3 children) and they all loved it. Everyone raved about the flavor and the consistency. I personally would add a little more salt, about a teaspoon, but I like my foods with lots of flavor, otherwise no changes. This is a guaranteed "will make again" recipe.

How can something so simple, be so delicious?  After all the compliments, I have decided to claim this potato as mine (sorry DWAGNER!) ;) I used new red potatoes and just quartered them.  The second time I made it, I had no celery, so I chopped up some sour dill pickles, and really enjoyed the flavour. This is going to be my only potato salad recipe, as in my family, traditional potato salad is the only way.

No fail means no joke! This is the BEST potato salad I've ever had!! I have an VERY finicky Italian uncle from Brooklyn, when he went back for thirds, I knew it was a winner!  EXCELLENT! This is how I'll be making potato salad from now on! Thanks for sharing!

this is a great basic potato salad recipe that can be tweaked to fit the taste of those you are serving.  my husband is watching his cholesterol and likes it a little sweeter, so i delete the eggs add some pickle relish.  when he is not sharing in the salad, i happen to love fresh dill and a little mustard when making it for myself.

Very good.  I did leave out the vinegar, I just don't like vinegar, and added about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.

Excellent recipe. A very traditional potato salad. My only change was using pickled hard boiled eggs instead of plain hard boiled eggs. The pickled egg gave it an extra bit of sour. Will definitely make this recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good base for potato salad. With three pounds of potatoes, you need more salt Add what you want.  I like olives and capers.

I just made this and it is pretty darn good. I have never been able to make potato salad, but I followed recipe almost to a tee. I did not have green onions so I used dry minced onion. Also added dill weed and a little mustard from previous reviews. Would of gave a 5, but I feel the 2 table spoons of vinegar was just a tad too much. I'll cut it down a bit next time.

I had never made any kind of potato salad and chose this recipe for my "first time" as I love red potatoes. I made it exactly as written and found that 2 hours is not near long enough to chill it completely, but once it was mixed up well enough and chilled enough it was very, very good. I ate this for 4 days until it was gone! I think next time I will try pickle juice instead of vinegar but it's excellent as is.

I was looking for something not too complicated to go with burgers tonight and I found this recipe.  It sounded good so I gave it a try just as it was written.  It was terrific, delicious....great!!  I love to read the changes people do to the recipes here; however, sometimes it is so changed it doesn't even resemble the original....so when they rate it as great...what are they rating theirs or the original???  Love it "just as it is"..Thank you Donna. P.S. I always keep notes on the reicpes of variations people try...just in case.

I would recommend cooking the potatoes slower so that they are not crunchy. Also, I added a little mustard and fresh dill. I felt that this enhanced the flavor tremendously. I would make it again but with my changes.

I made this yesterday for a picnic. I followed the recipe to the letter. Everyone liked it, I liked it also, had a nice dill flavor. I like a sweeter tangy mayo salad dressing. But how do you argue with success they ate it all. This is a keeper, I already printed it and its in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Straightforward, can't miss potato salad. I subbed buttermilk for the milk, and white wine vinegar for the white vinegar to up the flavor. Next time I may try replacing some of the mayo with yogurt (to cut back on the fat), and roasting the potatoes. They seemed a little soggy to me when boiled.

I love this salad! It is very flavorful on its own, but I did add chopped bacon and it was absolutely perfect. The kids gobbled it right up. I will be making this again. Thank you!

I made it and it was yummy.

I did make the following changes:

no eggs (didn't have any)
less mayo (could not bring myself to use 1 1/2 cups!)  I used 3/4 cup.

I tripled the milk though.

Next time I make it I will probably add bacon or boiled eggs or capers.

This recipe is a keeper for me.  I am not a fan of hard boiled eggs so I eliminated those and added 1/2 t. of celery salt & a little dry mustard. I also reduced the mayo to one cup.  Real yummy taste and I loved the green onions.

Decent potato salad which was enjoyed by all who ate it. I did add a little dried dill and a teaspoon of sugar to the dressing. I would suggest cooking the eggs longer. Mine were not done after 12 minutes.

Great basic recipe for red potato salad.  I added a few dashes of ground coriander as well as a few sprinkles chervil to give it a little more flavor.

We all enjoyed this potato salad, but next time will tweak a little.
Slice potatoes(like scalloped)and use half miracle whip/half mayo.  Bacon bits would be great unless restricted by koser menu.

I've made this twice now and it has been excellent.  My only change was omitting the eggs due to a food allergy, other than that it turns out perfect as is.

As written, I thought this potato salad was a little bland.  I let it sit overnight to give the flavors a chance to blend but wound up having to punch it up a little with the addition of more salt and pepper and a little mustard before taking it to a party.  It's a good starter recipe though, and I'm glad I tried it.

Very good!  I had to cook potatoes approx. 25-30 mins.  Omitted eggs.  At first, I thought mayonnaise mixture was too tart, but after pouring it over potatoes, I added a dash of mustard and a few drops of dill pickle juice.  Salad was still not cold after 2 hours, so I would recommend allowing more than 2 hours for chilling.

This potato salad was wonderful.  It's the first potato salad I've ever been successful at making and it was a huge hit at our big family BBQ.  My father-in-law, who isn't supposed to eat one of the ingredients due to allergies couldn't even keep his fork out of it.  They were all asking for the recipe. Thank you so much for this "no fail" potato salad recipe that was such a great hit!!!!

Thank you DWAGNER! I have been searching for a great potato salad recipe; everyone in my finicky family loved it.  I tweaked the original recipe a bit;red wine vinegar instead of white, red onion instead of green.  I added 1/2 cup of sliced black olives, two tbsp of dill relish, 1 tbsp yellow mustard, doubled the amount of pepper and (seasoned) salt, and added tsp each of paprika and basil.

This is one of my favorite potato salad recipes.  I sometimes add a little more vinegar or yellow mustard because I like my potato salad more tangy.  It does help to make it the night before to give the flavors some time to blend.  The red potatoes are a nice touch.  They are not only pretty, but the flavor is a little different than regular potatoes.  It is a great dish for "fancier" party such as a bridal shower or ladies luncheon.

I made this recipe a few night ago, and my husband and I loved it.  I especially loved the texture that the celery added.  I had leftovers and ate it the next day, it was even more tasty after being refrigerated for a day.  Next time, I will make it a day in advance so all the flavors come together.

This is a simple recipe that makes a fantastic potato salad.  My older daughter was so happy to see it in the fridge when she came home from college today.  She immediately filled a bowl and ate some as an afternoon snack.  A definite keeper!

This potato salad had a wonderful flavor.  I made it for a family get together and everyone came back for seconds, and some thirds.

Love this red potato salad. I steam the potatoes until tender but firm and added paprika. Will definitely make again!

A staple in our house! My family doesn’t like the “crunch”, so I omit the green onions and celery. This is my go-to dish when going to a BBQ, always a crowd favorite!

I had not made my own red potato skin on salad before, this was the ticket. My husband LOVED this so much, he took a helping then went back for more saying it was AWESOME 10+. ** I did add a dash of dry mustard "jazzed it up bit", my Auntie Lorna always says with this, and a finely chopped dill pickle as well. YUMMMMMMMM!

This is my go to recipe for potato salad. Over the years, I have modified it to perfection. Instead of regular salt, I add a tablespoon of seasoned salt and a teaspoon of garlic salt. I add 3 tablespoons of vinegar (not 2) and a teaspoon of pepper (not half) for an extra kick. People are always asking me for the recipe.

Easy and tasty.  I substituted miracle whip, hence left out the vinegar, added a dollop of yellow mustard and a dollop of horseradish sauce to give it some zip.  I did not quite use all of the dressing, also used 3 of the 4 eggs, 3 seeemed like enough.

I haven't made potato salad in 20 years. This recipe seemed simple and straightforward and contained most of the ingredients I am accustomed to having in a potato salad. So I decided to dive back into potato salad world with it. It was good and I would make it again. I grew up with potato salad that had a bit of sweet pickle in it and I would definitely add that next time. But this is a delicious potato salad as is and a great place for folks to start before customizing it to their taste.

It is our go to potato salad. We never have milk in the house so I use half and half. Sometimes I substitute vidalia onions for the green onions if that's what I have on hand. Other than that I pretty much stick to the recipe.

This was awesome! I cut potatoes before boiling. That keeps them from becoming a mushy mess. I added a whole onion and a bit of dill for fun.

Made a small batch as there were only going to be two for dinner.  Added pickles and mustard as others suggested.  Also, used 2/3 mayo and 1/3 low fat, unflavored yoghurt.  Have been using this combo of mayo and yoghurt for 20+ years.  No one has ever noticed.  Potato salad was very good.  Will make from now on, since peeling is unnecessary.

Wasn’t overly impressed and had to doctor in a little bit and definitely way too much of the mayonnaise and I had to drain it a couple different times over the course of 24 hours.  Everything to everybody’s individual taste I understand that but I will definitely say the mayo portion was too much!

This is a great base recipe and I followed it to a T, but I felt is was a little bland.  I added some spicy deli mustard and some bacon to it and Bam!  My husband said it was some of the best potato salad he's ever had and he loves all different types of potato salad.

It was a good basic recipe.  I had a craving for potato salad for dinner and two hours to do it in.  I looked for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for and not to difficult to assemble.  I did specifically look for potato salad recipes that didn't contain mustard since I'm not a huge fan of that style of salad.  It was good for the dinner table that evening but felt it was missing a pop.   I thought this might improve by letting it sit overnight but unfortunately did not.  I would advise adding your special tastes to this one to improve for that WoW factor.

I volunteered to make potato salad for our high school marching band's family picnic, and was dreading it.  I chose this recipe because of the simplicity, and my husband and I both loved it.  Looking forward to pleasing the crowd at the picnic tomorrow.  :)

I used the recipe as is, but I did take the suggestion to add dill relish and mustard.  I added 1 tbsp  of each, as suggested, but next time I would add maybe 1 1/2 tbsps of each.  It was delicious, and very simple to make.

I diced the potatoes before I cooked them, and followed ROXY's suggestion of adding a bit of dill relish and mustard. It was the best potato salad I have ever prepared, and will definitely do it again.

Typical and similar to potato salads I've made before. I've been know to add bacon bits, red onion instead of green, mustard, and double amount of eggs. Red potatoes are ideal for roasting and potato salad with the skin on.

This was my first time making a red potato salad and it was really good, but bland.  I made 2 tiny changes, which punched it up a bit.  I added an extra 2 tbs of Vidalia onion, about 2 tbs dill pickle juice and 2 diced dill spears.  I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe, we used 6 eggs instead of 4 and added 1/4 cup yellow mustard and 1/8 cup spicy mustard and 1/2 tsp. of paprika. Yum!

We loved this! We modified the recipe by adding some mustard to the sauce (not much bc I don't like tons but enough to add a zing) and chopped bacon. Delicious! Got rave reviews from others at the dinner.

Great egg & mayonnaise-based potato salad. I doubled eggs for 6 servings -- 4. I also added the suggested 1 Tbs of mustard (again for 6 servings)

I tried to follow the directions exactly because that is what I am rating.  I actually thought there was too much vinegar so added a bit of sugar to counteract that.  I tasted it after I assembled it but before it was refrigerated.  I liked it and will probably make again.  4 stars because I needed to change it for our taste.

Made this many times now, and it's always a hit. I add a little dill as others do, but otherwise it's great as written.

I'm not crazy about potato salad. Now that I've found this recipie, I actually enjoy it. My in laws make me bring it to every family function. Unfortunately I can't add onions due to allergies in the family.  I felt like it was missing something so I added Garlic dill Pickles and I also fry up Bacon and toss it in. excellent recipe!

I think this is a four star recipe as written but after playing around it could be much better.  I suggest adding about 1/2 teaspoon fresh dill paste, and 1 tsp of mustard.  I also substituted about 1/2 cup of sour cream for the mayo.  Dusted with paprika.  Also - I left the vinegar out altogether as it adds a funny taste.

I too added dill and omitted vinegar and salt.  I over salt the potato as it cooks and the salt is absorbed making it unnecessary to add to the dressing.
 So good.My husband loved it.

Meh.  Very bland.  I added some mustard.  It is not a very exciting recipe.  Too much mayo and not enough acid flavor.  I will let it chill a bit more, then maybe add some paprika or chopped parsley.   Maybe a touch more vinegar?  The salad at my grocery store deli is better and a lot less work!

It was very good! I made this two times. I added celery salt to boost the flavor and its my substitute for salt in all salads. The second time I added 6 slices of bacon to the salad, cooked and chopped up and it was even better!

Excellent, excellent. Only change was adding some dill and leaving the celery out just because of personal taste preferences. This will definitely be my go to recipe for potato salad.

Easy and delicious!  What could be better than that?  I omitted the eggs because I do not care for them and the recipe was still excellent.  My husband gobbled it up and I just offered to make it for a potluck.  Great recipe!

Hands down the best potato salad I have ever had!!!
I didn't have green onion on hand so I substituted with dried chives, I also added dried dill weed and dried flat leaf parsley oh and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white distilled.

I added a chunk of onion, 2 tablespoons pepper,& sea salt, 1 clove unpeeled garlic,and a dash of white wine vinegar to the water. 
This allows the potatoes to absorb the ingredients that are also  added later.  made for 18 people. It was very popular.

Very good base recipe but I jazzed it up!  I added some white onion in addition to the green onion, a tablespoon mustard, a tablespoon dill relish, a few extra shakes of pepper, and a tablespoon of dried dill. Taste the dressing once you whip it up before pouring over potatoes to make sure it doesn't need anything else.

This recipe should be the springboard recipe for the potato salad-eating world.  It should be encouraged to add whatever else you feel makes your potato salad the best for you.  For me it must include chopped dill pickles and pickle juice, Dijon mustard, par-cooked diced carrots, freshly ground pepper and a bit of Tabasco sauce.  It's Memorial Day today and I'm having mine for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!

We LOVE this potato salad! It's my go-to recipe for all family functions. We always make a recipe as written first, then start tweaking things to our own tastes. I substituted red wine vinegar for the white vinegar and we add about a teaspoon of dill seasoning. We've also been known to throw some bacon bits in there from time to time. Even our friends who don't care for potato salad come back for seconds and thirds of this recipe!

first time making. Used 1 and 1/2 lb gold potatoes and 4 eggs. Used red onion chopped really fine. Put garlic powder and dill on warm potatoes.  Adjusted vinegar and mayonnaise and celery for my amount of potatoes. Tasting it before I put in refrig , i added more salt, pepper and a bit more garlic powder. Hubby snuck a taste and is really looking forward to dinner!

Fabulous!   I made this to the recipe and even picky hubs (who swears by  potato  salad with dill relish) loved this   even better.   I was careful not to cook the potatoes too long, just  barely  to tender as others have mentioned.   I also  find full fat mayo ( I hate to say it) gives the  best  flavor, wonderful mouth feel, perfect (just keep portions easy...if you can).  I have  recently switched to  using 'just Mayo' -   uses non gmo canola and no egg   but very tasty.  Altogether, a wonderful taste of summer, thank you  dwagner.

Fantastic potato salad and I'm very picky.  I couldn't get baby reds at the store here (we are limited in our produce) but the baby yellows worked fine.  My problem with lots of potato salads is the dressing, and this one really was perfect.

Very good!  Added 1/2 cup mustard and lots of white onion.  Also used 2 additional boiled eggs.  Delicious!  Best potato salad I've ever had!

Classic potato salad in our family with 2 small changes.  I omit the milk and add 2 tbs Dijon mustard.  To get the full flavor I suggest making this the day before and letting the flavors ripen overnight.

The recipe was a good starting point. But I would recommend cooking the potatoes longer than the suggested 15 minutes to avoid some raw potatoes. I also added sour cream and some shredded cheese on top for flavor since it did seem lacking. Overall decent recipe!

This was great!
We made it with purple potatoes because we had them.  Otherwise we did it with no changes.  We thought the flavor was perfect.
We refrigerated it for almost two hours and had it as a side dish with cold cocktail shrimp and seafood sauce that came with the shrimp.

I made this recipe and it turned out awesome! the only thing I did different was added 1 teaspoon of mustard and 2 teaspoons of vinegar. Even my boyfriend said it was good n he's not much of a fan of potato salad!

First time I made this without any changes and I would rate as a four star only because I'm used to my mother's recipe which included pickles and mustard.  With these additional items it tastes a lot like the potato salad Mom made and my personal taste elevated it to a five star!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I found this salad really bland. It was only with a lot of doctoring (dill, parsley, and celery seed helped, mustard made it even better) that we were able to enjoy it.

First the red potatoes need to cook more than 15 minutes--about 17 or 18.  Next the eggs need to be brought to a boil, covered and left on the burner for 18-20 minutes. I have done it that way for the past 40 years.  For some reason, I decided to try the instructions in the recipe. I ended up with 5 eggs that were not hard boiled.  As far as the seasoning, it varies from person to person.

Although my mom loved this potato salad, I thought it was too bland.  I added crumbled bacon and dijon mustard, but didn't change anything else.  Had to add alot of salt and pepper to get any real flavor.  I will definitely make again as it's a simple recipe, but will have to add more modifications to fit my personal tastes.

Awesome recipe!  Of course, I added some personal touches.  I omitted the green onions (don't really like them), added chopped red bell peppers, and more salt and pepper to taste.

I don't like vinegar so I skipped this step and skipped the celery as well. It's a hit EVERY time I make it. Even my husband's son who doesn't usually like potato salad loves it. The red potatoes make all the difference and it's definitely my preference. It's a tasty and simple recipe!

I love red potatoes since I worked on a potato, carrot, onions and bean (navy bean)farm as a child; I changed it the second time because I found it had too much mayo.  I also added dill pickles and pickle juice instead of vinegar, left out the milk and salt and made home made olive oil mayo with a tsp of mustard powder and a pinch of paprika(or Lowensenf and it was great. Put a salt grinder on the table.
 Back when I worked on the farm baby potatoes were considered seconds and we were a big family with 9 kids; we bought 75# bags of baby potatoes for $2.00 from the farmer I worked for.

This was ok but nothing special.  Maybe I should have let it chill for longer? I did not add all the dressing bkz it would have been too mayo-ee. Those who gave it 5 stars seem to have added other ingredients, i.e. bacon.

This is a great recipe. I do not like green onions, so I substituted 1 teaspoon of onion powder instead. In addition, I added some mustard powder and garlic powder for some extra flavor. Delicious!!!!

This recipe is so good, easy too. I made this potato salad for the first time today, but modified it to my family's tastes. I boiled the potatoes about 15 min, after cooling, I added onion, two hard boiled eggs, and mayonnaise. I didn't measure mayo or onion, as I know how much we like in our salad. When salad was well mixed, I topped with paprika. We had ham and a garden salad with it. I'll make this potato salad more often, it's a nice change from the tradional potato salad I've made for years.

So delicious! We added a few extra eggs & some cooked, crumbled bacon. You could also add some dill, but this recipe is already excellent as is!! Thank you for an easy new staple to our home.

I was looking for the right recipe to make a potato salad with unpeeled red potatoes and it had just the perfect amounts for the size salad I wanted to make.  Great directions on the potatoes and the egg directions are also what I was taught to do, they come out just right.  I added a tbsp of mustard, and used a few radishes and some celery for some extra crunch and color.  And also used Miracle Whip (about 1/2 as much instead because I wanted less creaminess - usually the mixture I make overwhelms the potatoes.)  Love it with any summer meal!

I love that this recipe is very simple.  Easy to throw this together.  I did change a few things.  Because of my lack of mayo, I used 1cup olive oil mayo and 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt.  The yogurt made it too sour so I had to add some sugar. I also omitted the celery.  It was very good.  No one else would eat it.  I think they were snobbish to traditional egg and mustard potato salad.  I ate the whole thing as left overs .  I will make it again.

easy to make, I used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar, and I used olive oil maynaise, topped it with pancetta cubes I browned in a pan, shredded cheddar cheese, red and green onions, salt and pepper.  Yum!

Excellent recipe as this is one of my favorite potato salads and it is very easy to make!  I didn't have green onion the first time I prepared this so I used red onion.  We liked it so much I continue to use the red onion, but will try the green onion in the future.

This was great and easy!  I made it and omitted the vinegar and added a bit of spicy brown mustard.  Delish!  I had to extend the boiling time as the potatoes weren't done.  Then I lost track of time and overcooked them a bit.  I diced them and put them in the freezer for roughly 20 minutes and it worked.  So many compliments even from people who said they didn't like potato salad.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good potato salad, I used red onion instead of celery.  Next time I will probably add some mustard.

If what you want is old fashioned potato salad then this is the recipe for you. I made just a couple changes. I used apple cider vinegar and I added 1 tablespoon yellow mustard. I took off whatever potato skin came off easily and left the rest.

It was ok.  I didn't have red potatoes, so I used chef potatoes.  It was ok in taste. My kids didn't like it either, so I'll give you 3 stars...perhaps I should of bought the red potatoes..maybe it will come out different.

This potato salad was okay. Not great, but not bad. I can't quite put my finger on what it was we didn't like. We ate it that night but I don't intend to make it again.

My husband is not a fan of potato salad, so when he liked this I knew it was a hit.  Pretty easy... and this was my first attempt at home-made potato salad.  Not as good as my mom's, but still yummy.

I really enjoyed this.  Added an extra shot of vinegar for flavor  and a little more mayo.  I took it out of the fridge for a 1/2 hour before serving.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe was pretty good, but I found it didn't have a lot of flavor after it was chilled. The only change I made to the recipe was to use half mayo half miracle whip, and I ended up adding a little celery salt to give it some additional flavor. I really like the change from traditional mustardy potato salad. With a little more practice, I think I'll really enjoy it!

This lacked some little "zip"...I'm not quite sure.  Will definately require furthur taste-testing later tonite.
Overall, good.  Very good, and different from the mustardy type potato salad my husband is so enamored of.  
He didn't like this, so that actually was a point in the recipe's favor.
