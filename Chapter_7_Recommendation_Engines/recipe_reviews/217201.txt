DELICIOUS! You could easily add chicken for another layer of flavor, but by no means does this recipe need it. Super easy to make, nice and cheesy. I hate mushrooms but ate them up with this recipe.

We used the whole wheat pasta noodles we had in the pantry already. I would have loved 2 zucchinis in this recipe, but again, not necessary to enjoy the recipe.

Quality recipe base, but don't recommend seasoning with basil/oregano/red pepper as called for below.

Freaking amazing. I made it exactly by the recipe and it is unbelievably good. It's even better the next day. My husband raved about it. I just finished the leftovers for lunch and I was sad that it was all gone.

This was really good! Would like to try with chicken. Only thing I did different was I added a 2nd zucchini and at least 2 oz less of the baby spinach.

I used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh - thawed and pressed out most of the water, and added it just before the flour.  I also substituted white wine for about half the chicken broth, and added chopped cooked chicken.  This was a HUGE hit with my family - including the two picky children - and everyone requested that I make it again.

Great way to use spinach!!! It smells, tastes, and looks like a restaurant dish! Added a little extra flour for a thicker sauce. We made it without baking it in the oven with the cheese on top for a lower calorie dish. Still delicious and rich.

I had a random collection of veggies I needed to cook, and came across this recipe. This was a really easy and pretty tasty vegetarian meal (with vegetable broth instead of chicken). I cut some of the pasta (to 4 oz) and increased the veggies and cheese a bit to mesh with my lower carb life style, but I didn't leave out or add anything that wasn't on the list. I was afraid it wouldn't be enough pasta since the original recipe calls for twice that amount, but it was perfect for me, and very filling. I'd make it again for sure!

This was yummy, yes, a little cheesy but hey. The zucchini and spinach really added a great taste. Not sure how a couple of the comments said it was bland. I didn't think so at all. They must have left something out or added something extra.  I used Veggie Rotini and my zucchini were a bit small so I used 2. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow after hearing how it tasted as leftovers.  I will say if you're worried about so much cheese you could leave out the 1/2 cup mozz or even cut back some on the parm inside the dish and you'll still have enough cheese on top for the taste.  Make sure you cook out the flour some or you'll have a floury taste.

I wouldn't change anything except maybe a lil more Rigatoni but this came out delicious! I could even make this the night before, bringing back to room temp, put in fridge, then when ready add the mozzarella and serve!

This was phenomenal! Even better as leftovers! I just used a brick of cream cheese instead of the Neufchâtel. The only thing I would try next time is to use a little bit more broth to make it saucier. Overall delicious! Will be making it again soon!

I just helped my 8 year old daughter make this for dinner.   It was quick, easy and soooo yummy!  My little Masterchef critics all agreed it was "restaurant quality".  
We followed the recipe almost exactly, except we substituted the Neufchatel with Philadelphia cooking crème (Italian 3 cheese flavor). 
I think the prep time indicated is more than what we needed.  
We prepped the veggies while waiting for the water to boil for the noodles & made the sauce while the pasta cooked - so everything was done in the time it takes to cook pasta + the 10 minutes to bake at the end.  
We will absolutely make this again!

Doubled this with my fingers crossed to have leftovers...it didn't disappoint!!  We're not big 'shroom fans, so kept the amount at single recipe amount & dry sauteed them first to eliminate mushiness.  They add such a nice flavor to the recipe.  I also added a cup+ of finely chopped onion & sauteed it with the garlic as well as upped the spice amounts a little bit.  Lastly, I substituted bouillon rather than broth.  Great recipe.  Will definitely make again (and again!!)

Delicious! I added a yellow squash in addition to the zucchini. My only issue was that it was a little too cheesy, next time Make I will go easier on the Parmesan cheese

My family liked this recipe. Pretty simple if you have the ingredients. I did not have the cream cheese or the spinach. I don't think I will use the cream cheese in the future. It did not need it. Shredded carrots might be a nice addition. I added cooked chicken to make it a one dish meal.

Excellent!  Loved the flavor that chicken added to it and it felt more like a meal.  I had leaf spinach from the farm market, worked great.  I cut back a bit on the cheese, less cream cheese and mozzarella to make it a little lighter.  Everyone loved it!

Great recipe! My husband usually turns up his nose at white sauces, but even he loved it!
I substituted a little chopped onion for the zucchini, and I made Alfredo sauce (butter, flour, cream) with chicken boullion instead of the chicken broth & cream cheese. I also used mozzarella, pepper jack, and Parmesan cheeses (what I had on hand). 
It would be good with ANY cheese combination and over ANY kind of noodle (I used spaghetti squash).

This was pretty good, but we both thought it was a little bland.
I left out: mushrooms b/c I didn't have any
I added:  extra garlic salt, salt, freshly ground pepper, a little extra dried basil, some fresh tomatoes right before baking (for some more contrast),  and chicken that I sauteed in garlic (finely diced) and olive oil.

Even with the additions we thought it could something else; just very 1 dimensional on flavor, even with the garlic and cheese. Maybe the spices need to be increased (and definitely needs salt!), or, maybe use fresh basil, and/or add something to give some contrast...we thought bacon would be a great addition :)  It is pretty easy to make and looks very nice coming out of the oven, especially with the addition of tomatoes...so I'll definitely make again, but will play with other additions to liven it up.

I use the vegetables that were available like squash, red onion, tomatoes, shallots, green onions,. Then I substituted some of the chicken broth with white wine. I didn’t use as much cheese.

I tweaked the recipe with pseudo-portabello mushrooms (from Aldi), and added squash, red pepper and roast turkey. It was AMAZING.

Delicious! I didn’t have any spinach so used some basil instead and added some red bell peppers just because I needed to use them. The flavors are amazing

I added an extra zucchini as mine was slightly smaller than what I like as well as an onion. I used herb and garlic cream cheese and cheddar cheese instead. extra garlic of course 

It was very good

Pretty darn yummy. I cut back slightly on all that cheese and added vegetarian sausage. You could definitely play around with this one and add chicken or other/different veggies. Will make it again.

I love cheese but this recipe has a bit much. It would be better if the cheese was more of a sauce.  I would recommend more broth or add milk to keep creamy.  I thought the flavor was good might even add some artichoke.

It was bland right out of the oven and reheated the next day.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot.  We used rainbow bow tie pasta and added some other seasonings due to our taste but this was a great recipe.  Rich and creamy so not an every night meal but it was very good!

Pretty good, but a little plain. I love how easy it is, but even with adjusting the seasoning up I still thought it was bland.
