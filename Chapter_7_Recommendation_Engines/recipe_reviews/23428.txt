I have made this several different times, I love it, have found that little less carrot and a lot less onion (I use dehyrated onion) helps hold the meatball together better.

Difficult to make and the meatballs fell apart and made it as if I had never formed the meatball ingrediants into a ball at all.

I wanted to make this a little bit Greek-y so I made the meatballs with half ground beef and half ground lamb, and used fresh mint as well as dill (was aiming for a keftedes-type of flavor). Unfortunately, the meatballs completely fell apart. The soup tasted ok, but the sludgy/eggy texture wasn't great, and it looked really unappealing. Thanks anyway!

The lemon soup was good, and the meatballs were decent too.  I was just not a fan of the combination.  The lemon was far to bitter to be paired with the taste of the meat.  It might be better if the lemon was not as strong, or if you used a more bland meat, such as chicken.

We really didn't care for this at all.  Cooking the meatballs in broth would help, but I'm not sure if that would even be enough.  Hope others have better results!
