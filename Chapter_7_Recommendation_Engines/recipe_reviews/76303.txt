This was wonderful! Previously, I have only fried okra or put into gumbo. I used fresh out of my neighbors garden, and sauteed quickly just until tender crisp - perhaps that is why it didn't turn "slimy". I did substite olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and added some red pepper flakes for kick. Was a hit with my company.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Excellent side dish! Fresh cut okra-when in season. works just as well as the frozen cut variety. For those that like the 'taste' of bacon grease, as another reviewer said, try this: after mixing the sugar, vinegar and oil together pour it into the skillet and stir. This will help the sugar melt quickly and also 'pick up' the flavor of the bacon. Remove from heat and cool slightly.  pour over the veggie mix and toss. Add crumbled bacon. This is equally good served at room temperature.

I have had a variation of this with breaded okra. It is absolutely delicious and addicting! However, this un-breaded version is going to be better for you and just as good! I'm doing the low carb thing, and if I substitute splenda for the sugar, this is completely "legal"!

This has expanded my previous okra possibilities! I added a little more bacon, because bacon fat rules! And I added some blanched (frozen) black eyed peas! Yummy goodness!

Great summer recipe very light. I found the hints of adding bacon just before serving to be very helpful. I have done this dish 2 times in the past month as my garden okra is really coming in now. I have 2 other things: First, I cut the sugar down to 1/4 the second time and it was much better.  The first time I used the full 1/3 cup and it was too sweet. Just for new users even though okra is cooked until tender, once marinated with other ingredients it becomes a bit slimmy so you may want to make sure boiled okra is a favorite. I love it, great recipe.

Because I didn't have time to completely chill this, we ate it still slightly warm. I thought that the bacon might get lose it's crispness if I added it in with the veggies, so I sprinkled it on top just before serving. We really enjoyed this. Thanks, Lunana!

We always grow a ton of okra and are looking for new recipes for our favorite veggie.  This was great.  However I did make a few changes.  I only cooked the fresh okra until tender and warm all the way through. I also added cheese, about a 1/2 cup and replaced the corn syrup with mayo.  A new favorite!

My family and I have grown up eating fresh home grown okra.  About 10 years ago we tried raw okra with ranch dressing and it was delicious!  We were pleasantly surprised.  Very little slimy taste you get with cooked okra.  Hope some of you readers will give it a try!

Wow! This was outstanding! I let it chill for about four hours before sampling, and I couldn't believe the flavor. Everything melds together so well. Like Caroline C, I added the bacon just before serving, so it wouldn't be soggy. This is wonderful, thanks Lunana!

This made an intresting side dish. I used veggie bacon instead of real and it was quite tasty.

Yum! The trick to end the slime?  Saute, grill, or roast with a touch of oil, but without *any* fluid.  Continue cooking, stirring as needed, until the strings of slime stop (and then a little longer if you wanna be sure).  The day we made this, there was NO SLIME....  Love this new twist to okra! Doesn't need the bacon, IMHO, though we used it the first time.  Cut into smaller little rounds. Used 1 T raw sugar and 3 servings of stevia powder - lower cal. Had only a little leftover - not sure my family would eat this after a couple of days, since you could finally see the slime taking to the dressing, but it didn't taste or feel slimy at all.  Since we like roasting and grilling okra, and we saute it for smothered okra or etc, we'll just cook up extra when we roast, grill, or saute, and toss some in a bowl to make the salad the next day!  Gotta admit, when I made this, my kids were squirmy, but they enjoyed it some. But hey, the used to hate grits, and now love 'em.  They're learning to love okra bit by bit too!  Thanks Lunana and allrecipes for helping this northern gal with okra!  Next....., callallo soup (sp?)

Made it per the recipe and it is very delicious.  I'm a big bacon & okra lover so I think I'd increase the amount of bacon and okra when I make it next & I do plan on making it again!  It was a hit for the whole family...thank you!

I tried this the other night and used fresh okra from my garden and it turned out great. It's a great dish for a hot day. As a suggestion... after it was almost gone I took a small cucumber that I had from the garden and added it to the mix and let it chill over night had it with my lunch it was good to.

I have never taken this salad out without taking the recipe because everyone wants it. If you do take it out, take each item wrapped separately so it doesn't get gushy. I fry the okra in corn meal till it is brown and really crisp and that makes it extra special and is the reason I don't mix it all till time to eat. The dressing is divine.

Excellent and delicious dish!  Had friends over and they LOVED it.  In fact, some said they don't like eating okra but this dish they will eat.  I had doubled the recipe and let it marinate for about a couple hours or so before serving it.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I love okra, but hesitated making it because of the slime factor.  This a very nice and fresh salad with barely a trace of slime.  I am a total bacon addict (cooked six slices - three for the salad, three for the chef) but I don't think it really needed it.  Next time I think I'll add some fresh herbs.  It was lovely and fresh but could have used a little more zip. Basil?  Crushed red pepper?

We had a surplus of tomatoes & okra over the last week that I couldn’t keep up with, and I was looking for something different to make with it. This was soooooo very good. I wish I had seen it earlier this summer!!
I didn’t have green bell peppers, so those were omitted. I also sautéed the onions with the okra (because we aren’t huge fans of raw onions), and added some minced garlic, salt, and pepper to the sauté pan. I didn’t get to chill it, so we ate it lukewarm.
 Everyone loved it, so it’s a keeper! I also might try it with the balsamic vinegar, instead of white like someone else suggested, for next time.
