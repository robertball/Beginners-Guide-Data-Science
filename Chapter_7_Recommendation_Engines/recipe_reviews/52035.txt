I made this in a punch bowl using 2 qts. cranberry juice, 2 liters gingerale, 1 qt. orange juice, 2 C. lemon juice and 2/3 C. honey. (32 servings) I thought it was good and my guests seemed to like it. I served vodka on the side for those wishing to imbibe. It went along with my bird theme.

Obviously this recipe makes a small amount, just under a cup.  It can be easily increased.  I didn't like the addition of the lemon juice.  Next time I will leave it out.  It made it to tart for me.  THX

I had all these juices left over after a party, so I tried this. I like that it makes just enough for one person.  A nice little refresher for my afternoon. I had run out of honey, so I used a stevia blend. It IS a little tart, though, as others said. So be forewarned.
