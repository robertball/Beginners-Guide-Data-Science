This was a really delish marinade! The only reason I didn't give it five stars, was because it didn't really live up to its name ~ the marinade wasn't orange-y enough at all.  In fact, my husband didn't know it had marmalade or the oj in it until I told him. That aside...the marinade made for a really tasty and tender tenderloin.  It was not salty at all (compared to all the other marinades I've made).  A hint here, for easier blending of the ingredients: melt the butter, then add the honey and marmalade, stir with the spoon you used for the honey...and it will slide right off the spoon ~ not sticky and no waste =^.^= ~ then add to remaining ingredients.

I also covered it with foil for the first 15 minutes or so, uncovering it during the final 5-10 minutes.

After reading the other reviews, I made a few changes. I doubled the orange marmalade, and also used olive oil instead of butter. While there still wasn't a strong orange flavour, it was detectable and a very tasty pork meal. A definite make again.

We couldn't taste the orange flavor either.

I agree with the other reviews.  This was a really good recipe but the orange flavour needs to be increased.  I too left out the butter and used olive oil.

This recipe was first reviewed in '06 - and still needed a picture.  I made the marinade as directed - except instead of using 1 cup orange juice (my oranges were yucky when I cut them open to juice them) I use 1/3 cup orange juice concentrate - I also added the zest of one orange.  I reserved half of the marinade and used the rest on the pork.  I grilled the pork to 145 degrees and let rest.  The reserved marinade I put in a sauce pan and reduced to a thick sauce.  The meat itself did not have an outstanding flavor but with the orange reduction it was outstanding.  ****  Note:  Since this recipe was published - the internal temp for pork has been reduced to 145 by the USDA.

After reading other reviews, I decided to brush orange marmalade over the loin the last 10 minutes of cooking time. I omitted soy sauce because of gluten intolerance. Still came out great. I will make this again.

My boyfriend & I enjoyed this dish! I added a little extra orange marmalade as well as some orange zest and it turned out perfect. Will definitely make again.
