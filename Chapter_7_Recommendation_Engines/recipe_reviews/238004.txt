As cook suggests in her notes, do freeze either the peach or the strawberries, otherwise, you'll find yourself adding ice, diluting the flavor.  The one ingredient that I could not taste was the ginger, so I'll add a bit more in the future.  Very, very nice smoothie which also breaks down well nutritionally.

Why can’t you make your suggestions like one fruit being frozen and one being fresh in the recipe instead of the footnote as I don’t read the footnotes until I’m done and ready to take a photo and review it so therefore I used both fresh peach and strawberries!
