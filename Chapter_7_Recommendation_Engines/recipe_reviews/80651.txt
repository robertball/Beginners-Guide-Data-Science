I have cooked this recipe twice now, once with the bone in chicken and once with boneless skinless.  We are health concious and usually use boneless skinless anyway. My husband and I both preferred the boneless skinless. We also soaked the lentils about a 1/2 hour before using them and cooked the chicken alot longer in the skillet right off and then longer in a dutch oven on the stove. It is very tasty.  I added cumin and basil and omitted the rosemary, as my husband is arab and this dish, done this way, is more like his own culture's food. Also, I added extra lemon.  Great dish and eay to make.

YUMMY!! I will definitely make this again and again.  Like other reviewers, I soaked the lentils for an hour and doubled the lentil cooking time.  I also left the salt until last since salt prevents the softening of pulses.  I used a jar of olive tomato sauce and I served it over macaroni.  It was absolutely wonderful, what a great lentil recipe, thanks!  (By the way, if you're using red lentils, you can probably stick with the cooking times.  Brown lentils take the longest to soften.)

Delicious and very satisfying, especially on a chilly evening.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it matched well with the lentils.  The chicken came out very tender. I had to add about an extra cup of water as the lentils cooked.   I actually thought that the flavor was delicious before adding the tomato sauce, so I might try omitting it next time for a change.  Definitely use fresh rosemary if you have it on hand, and don't skip the lemon juice -- it really brings the flavors together at the end.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good.  I used 1 tsp fresh basil instead of 1/2 dried because my husband, the food snob, said that dried basil is really to be used when it can cook for awhile for the flavors to escape. We all liked it and then, my husband put a few drops of a very nice Balsamic vinegar and some long shavings of parmesean reggiano cheese on it for garnish and wow!  I thought it was good but when he did that, I knew what the others were talking about when they said it needed something more.  I will add the Balsamic after the lemon juice from now on.  Thanks!  We love this!

I had never had lentils before but I really loved this.  My husband and one year old son loved it also.  I added a little fresh grated motzarella cheese on top.  I also cooked it all my croc pot on low heat for about 6 hours - turned out great!

Put all in the crockpot before bed and the wonderful smell woke me up at 5:30 in the morning.  Used 14-oz can of pureed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

I used almost 3 cups of broth and skipped tomato sauce and lemon juice.  It turned out to be a very comforting food.  I love it.

This recipe was great...

I will certainly be making this one again - incredible! I had people flocking to my apartment, asking what the smell was...

This recipe was quite filling, very satisfying...

I used red lentils; they soften much quicker than brown, and gave the dish a saucy consistency (I served over spaghetti).

I also used salsa rather than tomato sauce. I really enjoy spicy food, so this gave it an extra little kick. Thank you to the person who made that suggestion! Very much appreciated!

A tiny bit of grated ginger also tastes great!

For vegetarians out there, tofu substitues well for the chicken. I would recommend cubing, and sauteing in some oil for about 2 mins (extra firm tofu)

Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Wow! I've been trying new recipes with lentels and this one is now my favorite! I put the spices in before the stock to release their flavors. Next time, I might omit the tomato sauce (taste tested and it was great before the sauce, also). Wonderful both ways!

What a tasty, easy dish! I used 3c stock (my own turkey stock from this year's Thanksgiving - pulled from freezer- and low sodium by default), a can of diced salt free tomatoes and fresh ground black pepper, cumin, turmeric and chili flakes for spices. I started with the onion and garlic (double to 4 cloves) and spices for a few minutes, to infuse the oil and toast the spices. Then browned the chicken while finishing the the onion and garlic - no need to add then remove chicken. Then added the lentils and stirred for a couple of minutes, then the carrots, same amount of time. Then I added the liquid ingredients, a bit of salt and put on the lid and simmered all  for a good 1.5 hours while doing other things. I finished it off with the lemon juice and garnished with fresh cilantro. I used one pot, no in and out of anything - a happy stew was had. Dark meat would also be tasty but I used breast. Also think it would be nice with spicy sausage or even a firm white fish, added at the end. Thanks for the idea.

It was a little bland to me as I love spicy flavorful foods so I added extra spices of CUMIN and Trader Joe's Every Day Seasoning. Served this over white rice. Froze half of the recipe for lunches.Great go to quick meal any type of meat can be used...

I've made this recipe about 4 times now.  The first 2 times I made it as stated.  Delicious!  I then left out the tomato Sauce at the end.  We liked it better.  I made it last night for dinner using french lentils, no tom sauce and spiced pumpkin seeds as garnish.  We served it over brown rice and everyone was in heaven.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if possible.  Don't be afraid to play with it.  Oh also I always cook it in my crockpot 6 hrs on low 4 on high.

really healthy and good. the longer you cook it the better. the directions confuse me because there are too many timings. I just saute the onions in oil. add the chicken and cook about 20 mins. add the remaining ingredients and cook about an hr and 30 mins. then i d-bone the meat, discard bones and put meat back. if you like a little kick in your food. add a bit of cumin and pepper flakes. i made this recipe into a stew/soup like texture. tastes way better that way! so add more chicken stock!

LOVED this - whole family did.  A couple of small changes:  soaked lentils 1 hour before cooking.  added cumin to chicken breasts (used boneless thighs) before adding to broth.  And added a splash of balsamic vinegar at end.  Served over basmati rice, but great on its own...  Did not add tomato sauce based on reviews, but will try diced tomatoes next time for an added something.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Five stars for being healthy AND good. I followed the recipe except used boneless chicken, and grilled them slightly before adding to the mix. I did use the tomato sauce and it really complemented the other seasonings. Finding good recipes that use lentils is hard, but this was a great one...will make again!

This is pretty good the way it is but I will probably add more spices next time. I did soak the lentil for about an hour prior to cooking. I served this dish over Basmati rice, which worked together perfectly. Thank you for this recipe.

One of my favorites!  The tangy flavors of tomato sauce, lemon juice, and garlic are nicely balanced by other ingredients.  It is the perfect dish for cool evenings -- and even better as a leftover.  The whole family loves it!

This was very good.  I used 4 smallish boneless chicken breasts cut up into 1-inch pieces.  The only other changes I made were to add cumin (recommended by so may others) and at the end, added a tablespoon of sherry vinegar at the end along with the lemon juice.  If it's a little too soupy, simmer uncovered for a few minutes to reduce down.

This was so good, I have never had much success with lentils in the past, but came upon this recipe looking for something I could make using lemons and rosemary from my garden.  I made some changes using what I had at home: 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken boullion instead of broth, no tomato sauce, fresh rosemary, doubled because I didn't use basil, added ~1/2 Tb. balsamic vinegar at the end with the lemon. This was great, I can't wait to eat leftovers.

One of the few lentil recipes that my boys will eat.  I doubled it and used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I also let the lentils soak for an hour before starting.  I did not have a problem with mine drying out, probably because of the added chicken.  My lentils were just perfect with this timing.  I added extra garlic because we love it.  I also used both parsnips and carrots because that is what I had.  I also added the salt at the end.  Really needs some rice.   Basmati was great!

Pretty tasty, and really nutritious.  I did, as other reviewers also reported, omit the tomatoes - the taste was nice prior to adding them, so I decided to cut my losses.

The flavor of this recipe was pretty good, but i think that the tomato sauce wasnt really necessary.  I tasted the mixture before the tomato sauce was added, and it was delicious as-is. Also, i had to cook my lentils for over an hour, so if i do make this one again, i will be soaking the lentils first and i will definitely omit the tomato sauce

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't soak the lentils, but I did use 1 tsp of fresh rosemary and fresh basil and added it while the lentils were cooking with the broth, I also used a jar of marinara sauce in place of the plain tomato sauce, I am not a lemon person so I omitted it but dh asked me to add it next time and also to try some cumin or curry in it. Thanks for a 5 star recipe!

I threw everything in the crockpot, added green pepper and substituted duck instead of chicken.  YUMMM!  I also used 1/2 spaghetti sauce and 1/2 homemade salsa.  And 1 1/2 c. chicken stock.  Served over macaroni.  Great winter, warm up your body & soul dish!

Great! First time preparing and eating lentils. My family loved it, even my very picky 4 year old. I made it with cut up chicken breat and cooked it first then added it in with the lentils. I added more chicken broth and I forgot the lemon juice. We ate in tortilla shells. I will be making this again and trying new ways to serve it.

Good!  I added 1/2 chopped green pepper and used a chunky style spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  Tasty with rice.

This was extremely tasty! I've never made lentils before, but I'm now a convert.  I changed the recipe slightly: soaked 1/2 cup dried brown lentils for about 2 hours before cooking; used chicken breast diced up into large pieces instead of bone-in chicken pieces, and seasoned with salt and pepper when cooking them.  kept all other ingredients in the same amounts, so it made the final result a little more liquidy.  I subbed fresh chopped tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  I was going for a more middle-eastern taste, so I subbed 1 tsp cumin and 1/2  tsp baharat spice blend (google it!) for the rosemary and basil.  stirred through lemon juice and plain yoghurt at the end, served over basmati rice and it was fab! If I had any fresh mint, I would've added that too.  great recipe for lentil virgins :)

Great hearty meal - and healthy too! I used cubed chicken cutlets. Meant to season them while cooking so they absorb some flavor... next time! Used shredded carrots, added garlic with the onion; cumin and coriander in place of rosemary and left out the tomato sauce. I used red lentils but will definitely use brown next time as the red lentils just turned into mush and I had to quickly cook rice for this to be served on. I could kick myself for having forgotten to add the lemon juice at the end... with the cumin, coriander and lemon juice flavors, this becomes very similar to a Persian stew - which is just yumminess all around!

This dish is quite flavorful. i soaked the lentils and added the onion, carrot, and garlic to the chicken instead of removing the chicken (I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs). I found that soaking the lentils decreased the cooking time.

Really good. This was my first time cooking with lentils, and I didn't have the time to soak like other reviewers mentioned, so I didn't. That said, the recipe could have used an extra 15 minutes or so of cooking to soften the lentils a bit more. The flavor was great, and due to the other reviewers, I skipped the tomato sauce and rosemary and added cumin and coriander instead. Delicious.

Family did not like this. Soaked lentils x 1 hour and cooked longer and they were still tough. Just an odd mixture, the lemon juice didnt add anything to this and it was time consuming to make.

Who knew lentils could be so good. As reccomended by others, I soaked the lentils and used fresh herbs but other than that I followed the directions exactly. This was really good. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy.  I did as others have suggested and added some cumin in it and wow did it taste good.  I also added a bit more chicken stock as well to prevent from drying.  I could eat this all alone without the chicken.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for a good healthy recipe.

Excellent. I did everything as written, except: soaked lentils for approx 45 mins before cooking, used onion/celery/carrot juice instead of chicken broth (didn't have any broth) and added a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe :)

I love, love, love this recipe! Hubby usually pours BBQ on everything I make, but he ate as is and ate the leftovers the next day! I made it without the tomatos, omitted the oil and I didn't have rosemary, but it was delicious without.  I have made this twice in 10 days.  Thanks for this wonderful and healthy recipe!

This recipe was AWESOME. The texture and flavor reminded me of the fried taco filling my grandma makes. Very good left over!!!  I added more chicken broth instead of water when the lentils became dry. I omitted the rosemary because I didn't have any, but added cumin.   This is a repeat recipe! Try it out! You won't regret it!

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT, FULL OF FLAVOR AND SOMETHING OF A CHANGE. I USED RED LENTILS AND SERVED OVER BROWN RICE, FOR THE HEALTH FACTOR. YOU MUST GIVE THIS A TRY. WILL USE THIS AGAIN HOWEVER, I WILL REMOVE ALL OF THE SKIN. THIS IS A KEEPER!

This is an excellent recipe and it made the best lentils I ever had (and I like lentils). The only reason I am docking a star is it took a lot longer to cook the lentils than the recipe stated and my large on the bone chicken breast halfs got overcooked a little bit.  

Also, I noticed a lot of recipes talk about not enough liquid - I ended up with too much liquid (soupy lentils) and I measured the ingredients as stated.  

Next time I will:
1) take the chicken out based on the recipe time, but will continue cooking the lentils for at least 30 more minutes
2) use 1 cup of lentils instead of 3/4.

Okay, sorry I just threw a lot of extra stuff from my kitchen in this. First tho, let me suggest you put the lentils on to cook with the chicken broth first, before you do anything else.  That way they are softened in plenty of time.  After browning the chicken breasts I threw them in a 350 oven while I prepared the rest if the recipe.  It takes time to chop a large onion and a few carrots and garlic!  It took almost 10 minutes to soften the onions.  Instead of tomato sauce i used  2 cups of fresh chopped tomatoes.  I had some boiled potatoes on hand so I diced them and added them too. I even had corn on the cob in the fridge, so, yes, I shucked them and tossed that in too.  After adding the lemon juice, I also added some fesh chopped cilantro. Yum!  To serve, I cubed the chicken pieces, set them in the center of a good-sized bowl and put slices of fresh avocado on top. Then I put a dollop of sour cream on that.  Lastly I sprinkled chopped boiled egg on top.  Tis is like a soup recipe from Columbia that one of our exchange students shared with us except theirs had no lentils.  Anyway, it was a delicious, filling, fresh-tasting meal!

This was absolutely DELISH! instead of tomato sauce i added in a fourth of a cup of my homeade salsa (diced tomato, red onion, parsley, and olive oil) it turned out super flavorful and yummy. going to serve this over rice. was a little too soupy because i used extra broth like others had suggested so i just simmered for 10 more minutes, uncovered... did make my brown lentils a teensy mushy but not too bad. Overall great recipe!

We made this the other night with boneless skinless chicken breasts. Otherwise, we followed the recipe exact using red lentils. We really LOVED the texture and the veggies, but we thought it was missing a little kick. We love spices, so the next time we make it, we'll probably quadruple the garlic and add a serrano pepper or cayenne powder. It's a perfect, healthy meal with a side of whole wheat flatbread and a salad.

I omit the tomato sauce and add a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh tomatoes instead.  Also soaking the lentils before you cook them shortens the cooking time.  I also have a moroccan seasoning that I add to the pot that really brings out the north african flavours.  Yum!

This was exactly what I was looking for. Simple, hearty, delicious and healthy. This will definitely be put into regular meal circulation. 
I used French lentils, and frozen chicken thighs. No tomato sauce, but hit it with a drizzle of high quality balsamic vinegar at the end. I couldn't stop eating it, the kids were mixed reviews, curse that late snack. The hungrier ones loved it, lol.
Incidentally, I had soaked the lentils for aboooouut uh, 2 days. I had planned to make it sooner. So I kind of eyeballed the liquids.
I served it with some crusty sourdough bread and red wine (for me, not the kids ;)Cheers

This is fantastic. I substituted tofu for the chicken and zucchini for the carrot, but everything else was just as the recipe dictated. Even my carnivore boyfriend loved this wonderful dish. Thanks for giving us something new and different to try! Will definately be making this over and over!

This is my new favorite recipe!  I omitted the tomato sauce because as I tasted the lentils at the end, it already tasted great.  I also omitted the rosemary because I don't care for it. There was plenty of flavor!  For my starch, I added 1 can of whole potatoes (cubed) about 5 minutes before the end. Makes a great one-dish meal!  I used boneless chicken tenderloins but I think it would work well for any chicken cut.

This is an excellent base recipe. A person could do just about anything with it.  I prefer not to add the rosemary. It is still very flavorful and has a comforting stew-like texture. Very nice!

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I used fresh basil and rosemary and cooked the chicken for a lot longer. Other than that, the cooking times were right on.  For the lentils I used the generic lentils from the grocery store, so I didn't have any trouble with cooking them- I did not soak them either.  Definitely add the lemon juice.  I served this over whole wheat spiral pasta with parmesan cheese- Delicious!!

This turned out quite good.  Used boneless, skinless chicken cubed, didn't add the salt as I didn't feel it needed it with the chicken broth and subbed salsa instead of tomato sauce per a couple other recommendations.  I skipped the rosemary as I didn't like the sound of it with this dish.  Otherwise, served over whole wheat spaghetti and found it to be a very hearty and filling meal.  Would like to try using different lentils as I used red and find these to take on a mushier consistency, almost seems like potato is in the dish (found the same when I made Spinach Lentil Soup from this site).  Anyway, great dish!

Very delicious dish, but I tweaked it (as I always seem to do) by adding a skosh of Madras Curry, some black pepper, 4 fire roasted red sweet peppers and some smoked, sliced Andouille sausage.  I also threw in a few good dollops of a good yoghurt right before serving to add creaminess and tang.  It was very good before.  It's even better now and is a meal by itself.

I saved a bunch of time by using canned lentils, drained and rinsed.  I left out the rosemary because I don't really like it, and added a few healthy shakes of cumin, which made it wonderfully tasty!  I skipped the tomato sauce too, as my hubby's not a fan of tomato in his lentils and it was wonderful for a cool autumn night!

I was looking for a good recipe using lentils, but this didn't do it for me. I followed the recipe exactly, but found the rosemary overpowering. I also agree with another reviewer that the sauce tastes better before adding the tomato sauce. Has potential, but I would tweak it a lot if we tried it again.

I am not a huge fan of lentils, but this recipe was great, very tasty! I think that I would leave out the tomatoes next time. I fed a household of 14 and there were no complaints (which is amazing)!

This was my first time cooking with lentils, and I have to admit I was a little intimidated by them.    I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make one change, I used the meat from a precooked rotisary chicken in place of the bone in chicken, I just added at the end with the spices and tomato sauce, this cut back on the cooking time a lot.  This recipe was so easy and tasty, I am excited about trying some new lentil recipes!!  Thanks!!!

Loved it!  I should have listened about the extra broth for the lentils...they ended up a little less tender than I would have liked and the leftovers were a tad dry.  I didn't use the rosemary, carrots or lemon juice and it was still fantastic!

Suprisingly delicious-not a big lentil fan but I may change my mind!- my 11 month old couldn't eat it fast enough.  As far as my other children were concerned-also not big lentil fans and not as daring as mom was to try them- the chicken was fantastic.

This is very good and very different!  I really liked it, and my two year old said "Mommy I yike this" (surprisingly, because of the lentils and veggies)!  I also added a red bell pepper, because I had it and it was about to go bad.  I rarely cook with bone-in chicken with skin, or with dark meat, but it was really good.  I used a package of chicken thighs.  VERY inexpensive, nice change!  Next time I would remove the skin, we picked it out anyway.  I would recommend this, but make sure you don't overdo the rosemary (I almost did).  It can get that "perfumy" taste.

Great recipe for non lentil lovers. Put all ingrediance in a crockpot for 6 hours on low. My tweeks: no carrots,petit diced tomatoes 1/2 can and added turmeric and red pepper flake. In the crock pot I added things in this order. 1st layer lentils,onions,tomatoe seasoning and water. Then added skinless chciken thighs season them again and added a few more onion. I adjusted the salt while cooking. Family liked it and they're not lentil fans.

Loved it! Doubled the recipe and I used Boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bit size pieces, and tomato and basil sauce instead of tomato sauce. I just cut the amount of basil the recipe called for. I think I might add some green bell pepper next time!! I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of water... This was absolutely yummy tho...

I really love this meal, but husband is only so-so about it.  Maybe he just doesn't appreciate lentils.  Aside from soaking the lentils beforehand, this meal seems to come together pretty fast.  The cooking time allows me to get my kitchen mess cleaned up which makes after dinner clean-up that much easier.

The whole family loved this!  I used fresh herbs instead of dried so I added them with the chicken instead of at the end.  Green lentils probably could have cooked a bit longer, but I'm not sure since I don't have a lot of experience with lentils.  They were great, though!  And while Parmesan was not necessary, we did use just a little on top.  This is going in the Recipe Box for sure!

I loved the flavors in this dish.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and as I was unsure how I would like the addition of so much tomato sauce, just added several healthy squirts of tomato paste from the refrigerated tube always on hand in my fridge.  We enjoyed this with a salad and corn bread.  Try this recipe, I think it's a winner.

I made the Slow Cooker Lemon Garlic Chicken from this site a couple of days ago and had some leftover shredded chicken that I used for this recipe.  It was great, turned out very flavorful.  I left out the tomato sauce and exchanged cumin for the rosemary as others had suggested.  We will be making this again for sure, a tasty dish with little effor.  Thanks for the recipe!

I skipped the tomato sauce because this was just so tasty without it (kept the lemon though)!  Easy to prepare and an awesome slow-carb meal. Served with asparagus- DELISH! Easy, yummy, and healthy. It's definitely going into the rotation!

Well, when I pulled out my chicken, it was expired. So I went ahead and just made the lentil part, which was easy and tasty. I was worried about waiting too long for them to be done, so I soaked them for probably about an hour (accidentally-I meant it to be 30 minutes...), then they ended up cooking for about 40 minutes. I didn't add salt or any of the tomato sauce stuff. I'll have to try this again with chicken ;)

Pretty tasty. I soaked my white lentils for an hour beforehand and they were perfect. I also used fresh rosemary and basil from the garden (1 tsp each- needs more). Splashed in a bit of balsamic from previous reviewer suggestion. I chopped up my chicken into bite size pieces so didn't cook them the whole 20 minutes, but more like 5. Will use the whole pieces next time. I didn't use any tomato sauce per previous reviews. And forgot to add the cumin everyone was suggesting. So my result wasn't following the recipe perfectly, but was pretty close. And it's pretty good. It's certainly easy. Thanks!

This was just ok.  I ommitted the rosemary because I don't really like it and added cumin intead.  I found that the recipe was kind of bland and if I made it again would add more spices.

We love this recipe! I usually will soak the lentils overnight, and then they will cook in closer to the time the recipe states. I also use boneless skinless chicken, either thighs or breasts. For our family of 6, I also double the lentils because we love them, and then there are some leftovers for lunch the next day. I also don't use the tomato sauce.

My husbad didn't like the flavor at all, but I thought it was pretty good. It heated up well as leftovers as well. I did find myself preferring the lentils more than the chicken though, so next time I might make this a vegetarian dish and skip the chicken all together!

Very good and different, exotically flavored chicken dish.  I made it once and it seemed a little too salty so the second time I made it I used a pinch rather than the 1/2 teaspoon as directed.  My family loves it.

I liked this recipe a lot but thought it was a bit bland, either needed more spice or more sweet. I remembered how my mother used to make apricot chicken, so I chopped up some dried apricots and tossed 'em in. Great surprise!

My family loves lentils and I was looking for a different way to prepare them.  I had a some chicken so I searched for a recipe and this one came up.  I used boneless skinless breasts and added a little cumin and Mrs. Dash and it was more than wonderful!!  Great for a chilly day.  My 17 year old son can hardly wait till I make it again.

The recipie was nice though soaking lentils before hand would have been best. I replaced the tomato sauce with small can of mexican salsa and enjoyed the spicy kick.

This recipe has become a goto for our family.  I keep lentils on hand just for this.  Tasty.  I use boneless chicken breasts or legs and chop them up before cooking.

This was great! I appreciated the suggestions in the comments and followed many of them - diced tomatoes instead of sauce, soaked the lentils, extra liquid. 

I was craving something a bit more exotic, so I added some cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg (all in small amounts). It was just what I was looking for. 

Maybe some lemon zest as garnish next time ...

This was fabulous!  I soaked brown lentils in cold water for an hour.  Doubled the garlic and carrots, fried with garlic and placed fried bone in chicken thighs in bottom of crockpot.  Mixed vegies with remaining ingredients (used canned pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce) and added 1 tsp. ground cumin and pepper, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar.  Cooked on low for 5-6 hours and served over basmati rice.  I think next time I may try with salsa instead of tomato sauce, as another suggested and maybe serve over macaroni

This is delicious and simpler to make in a slow cooker 6 hrs on Low setting. I substituted one can of diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, added 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1 tsp curry and 1 tsp kosher salt. I used 2lbs of chicken thighs and removed them to shred then returned to the slow cooker.  I stirred 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar completion. I served over brown long grain rice with a slice of lemon. My house smelled great and the meal was very flavorful!

I used canned chicken, canned tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Also reduced the lentils and added some barley instead.  Accidentally added a little too much rosemary and the flavor was way too strong, so added a lot of water and turned it into soup. It was a total hit! One of the best tasting soups ever!

I did the crock pot method. Used fresh cut tomatoes and I had a yellow bell pepper to add.  I also added a little balsamic vinegar near the end. I was looking for a new  Chicken recipe and I'm glad I found this.

Very good. Changes I made were bc I didn’t have the ingredients on hand. I had no onion, or carrot. Used onion powder. My can of tomato sauce was 5 oz too Much but I added it in. Delicious flavor, need to cut back the salt for me next time. I also didn’t cook as long as it said - we were hungry and it was late! Delicious. We all 3 enjoyed eating this recipe

Excellent!  I only had red lentils ... used a 14 oz can of tomatoes and pureed them instead of tomato sauce which I added with the broth and 3 tablespoons of brandy  ... added one diced rib of celery and some button mushrooms ... will be making this again and again ...

Easy, few ingredients, and delicious.  Despite the lengthy prep time, most of the time is cooking, very little actual preparations needed.

I did make some changes to this dish.  I didn't like the idea of basil and rosemary, So I decided to add some different spices such as cumin, chili powder and cinnamon. Everything else I made the same. It was very tasty. I had to cook it longer than the recipe said, until the lentils  were softened.

Awesome! Didn't have rosemary , used 3/4 tsp cumin and fresh basil. Used some tomato paste with salsa and a bit of water cause I didn't have tomato sauce. Tastes great!

My husband and I loved this recipe! However, I have to eat a low-histamine diet so it was with some adjustments. I made it without the lemon juice and tomato sauce. As a result I found I had to double the herbs for enough seasoning. I also used 1 lb. chicken thighs and substituted 4 T dried minced onion (rehydrated before sautéing) because that was what I had on hand. I increased the garlic cloves to three because my husband and I love garlic. I also used 1/2 a carton of chicken stock because I don't use the canned kind (too many chemicals). And I cooked the chicken in coconut oil because I don't cook with olive oil (it breaks down in high heat creating DNA-damaging free radicals and oxidants). The lentils came out so creamy and delicious! The only change I would make next time I made this recipe is to increase the amount of the lentils to at least 1 cup dry and increase the chicken stock/broth accordingly. Oh, I used fresh rosemary instead of dried because that was what I had available. I just increased the amount by three times as a result. I can't wait to make this again. It was soooooooooo hearty and satisfying. Oh, last thing. I topped it with EVOO before serving. It would also be quite pretty with a little fresh chopped parsley.

Eh it was okay. Definitely needed more liquid than the recipe states. Taste gets boring after awhile. It is a hearty meal. I discovered I do not care for rosemary.  I followed the directions exactly only changing it to add more broth as it was drying up.

Absolutely delicious.  This dish has a very nice flavor, something that feels very homey and comfortable.  I did cook the chicken a bit longer as I had big pieces.  I am thinking this would be fabulous in the crock pot after the chicken is browned.  I will make this again.  My daughters loved the lentils.

I made this with boneless chicken.  I added 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks.  Added bay leave, oregano and basil.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used fresh tomatoes, chopped up.  I used almost the whole 32 oz chicken broth carton.  Added lemon juice, italian parsley at the end of cooking.  Served with grated cheese.  Even better the next day.

I used red lentils, which may have been my ultimate downfall. They took MUCH longer to cook. The chicken came out pretty bland and flavorless too. The recipe is definitely chock full of protein, but I didn't like it enough to keep it saved as a favorite.

I used what I had on hand. Meaning, I used boneless skinless thighs, vegetable broth & thyme instead of rosemary. Sometimes you just do what you have to. My husband gave it high praise, "You can make it again." I'd love to make when my son comes home from being overseas!

It's not very pretty but it sure is good. I used skinless boneless thighs, lo-sodium broth, tomato only (Pomi)  tomato sauce and just a dash of salt. The first time I made this, I used low sodium tomato sauce and full amount of salt recipe called for. It was really good but too salty for me . Excellent and very healthy  (if you cut some of the sodium out) dish.

3.5 stars, only because I have altered it quite a bit. Here are my changes: 1. Season chicken with turmeric, salt and pepper before searing them. 2. Chop a whole onion and more carrots/sweet potato/butternut squash (they all work really nice) - about 3 cups. 3. Follow the rest of the recipe, but skip the tomato sauce. Add some spinach if you like. 4. Finish it with 1-2 tbsp chopped fresh basil and lemon juice. Divine! Serve over pasta (orzo, penne, etc).

I decided to omit rosemary and basil. I fried some cumin and black mustard seeds before adding onion. I also added a pinch of Garam Masala, 2 teaspoons of sour cream and a little bit of balsamic vinegar as suggested by others. The result was outstanding! I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent.    Here's some serious time savers:    Used chicken breast (about 2 pounds).   Cut up into small cubes.   Browned and removed from plan.    While chicken was browning and placed some water on to boil.  As soon as it was boiling, I poured that over my lentils.   They soaked in the hot water while chicken finished boiling and, then onions were cooking.    At the point when you pour in the lentils, they only need about 8 minutes to cook.    Then, pour in chicken and tomato sauce and chicken just needs to warm up and get a little flavor - mine sat for 5 minutes because it was already 7:45 and we were ready to eat.  Excellent and ready in under 30 minutes.

I was looking for a "use what I have" solution for supper and ran across this recipe for lentils and chicken.  I had half a rotisserie chicken and a lemon - everything else on the list are pantry staples for me so I gave it a whirl.  To be honest, I expected the results to be okay - but I was thrilled with the resulting dish!  I made it exactly as presented with only 2 changes.  I used already cooked chicken which I pulled from the leftover rotisserie chicken, and my tomato sauce can was 2 ounces lighter than what's called for.  It came together in almost exactly 90 minutes.  I served it over white rice made with a little olive oil added to the boiling water, and tossed with chopped green onions and parsley, and a salad on the side.   Every bite tasted better than the last!  It's definitely a new go to for us and will likely be a preferred choice for using up rotisserie chicken!

I've made this a couple of times now, in various incarnations, and it's fantastic every time! I've started adapting this recipe to a roast chicken. I combine everything (adding only half of the called-for chicken broth since the bird will have drippings of its own) and let the chicken rest atop the mixture and roast the chicken in the oven at 400 F for 1-1.5 hours or so. Once taken out of the oven, you have a delicious mixture beneath the chicken that you can serve beside it!
I also like to add other vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions for more flavor

What a great and easy recipe!  I was looking for a healthy, low carb meal with basic ingredients I had in my home already... and this was it!  I used boneless chicken thighs (because thats what I had on hand).  I followed the recipe exactly and therefore, did not pre-soak the lentils as others suggested (there was no need to either, they were cooked perfectly as is), and I did add the tomato sauce. It was a bit soupy at the end, which would have been fine if I was serving it over pasta or rice.  However, since I was eating it as is, with no rice or pasta, I turned up the heat and just boiled out the liquid for about 5-10 mins at the end.  Delicious!  My boyfriend loved it as well and said to make sure to keep this one in rotation.  No need for any added rice or starch!  He went up for seconds, and the little bit leftover today I already ate for lunch- Yum! Served it with a side of asparagus.  Thank you for a great, easy, healthy, and delicious recipe!

This recipe was delicious.  Seeing as I had to use what I had on hand, I made some changes.  After viewing the many reviews here, this is what I went with.  To start, I soaked the lentils for 2 hours.  This cuts the cooking time and the lentils are tender.  Instead of chicken broth, I used 1 packet of Lipton's Onion Mushroom soup, which makes 2.5 cups.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch pieces.  I omitted the Rosemary, salt, Tomato sauce, and lemon juice.  

In a 5 quart pot, I put 1 tbsp. olive oil and heated on medium.  To the heated oil I added 1 tsp. dried basil, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. black pepper, and 1 tsp. Adobo seasoning.  After infusing the oil with the spices for 2-3 minutes, I added 1 large onion, diced, and sautéed for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  I then added the chicken and stirred the mixture until chicken was browned, about 5 minutes.  I drained the lentils, 1 cup, and stirred them into the mixture along with a  14.5 oz. can of low sodium sliced carrots, also drained, for another 5 minutes.  This coats all the ingredients with the spices.  Lastly, I added the 2.5 cups of the Onion Mushroom soup and brought to a boil, covered the pot, then reduced to simmer for about 45 minutes.  I also added 4 tsps. flour to thicken the broth into a gravy.   All the ingredients came out moist, tender, and full of flavor.   I served this with white rice prepared in Onion Mushroom soup instead of water.  Next time, I will add corn, fresh tomato,

Excellent! I usually finish the chicken by baking in the oven until fully cooked. Then I cut it up and stir it back in. I find green lentils work the best. The red lentils turn to mush. I usually boil the lentils in a separate pot until they are cooked. Besides my method, I use all the ingredients as stated and it turns out delicious! If you don't like rosemary, this isn't the recipe for you. My husband and toddlers love it too!

I made this for the first time tonight and I have to say I really like it! I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I used chicken bouillon and omitted the salt I also didn't have any tomato sauce so I diced up some tomatoes instead. I have to say it is quite delicious and full of flavor!

This dish was very good. Even my very picky kids almost licked the plate clean. I used more lentils and second time around used Italian seasoning instead of the rosemary and basil and it gave a much better flavor. Was very tasty, and healthy. And if I can get the kids to eat something healthy, I'm making it! So this will be in our regular rotation from now on. Thank you!

Update. I did what another reviewer said and added a few drops of balsamic vinegar and it made it more flavorful. And I let the lentils soak for an hour before cooking and used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Also I've made it with boneless skinless chicken breast instead and it came out great.
Update: I was pressed for time so made this in the slow cooker. Used boneless chicken breast which I cut into medium size pieces. Threw everything in the crockpot, and used 21 oz of chicken broth, 2 tbs lemon juice,  and added the balsamic vinegar. Cooked on low about 6 hours. Came out great.

Really delicious!  I took another reviewers note and went more middle eastern (because that's what I was craving) so instead of Rosemary I added thyme, cumin, and sumac.  I will try the way the recipe is written in the future. This recipe is very flexible and so delicious!  I had hoped for leftovers for lunch but unfortunately there are none!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added an additional clove of garlic, a tsp of good balsamic vinegar right before serving, and lemon wedges on the side instead of adding it to the whole dish.  Family loved it!

I enjoyed this recipe but felt like it was missing something on its own. We had it on a bed of couscous and in the future I would serve it with warm na'an bread. Will make again and use on top of either rice, pasta, couscous, etc.

I loved this recipe! Added fresh tomatoes,cumin and cilantro served on a heated whole wheat wrap with shredded mexican mix cheese. For additional toppings salsa or picante sauce with a dollop of plain greek yogurt.  I don't use sour cream anymore on anything as you can't tell the difference and so much healthier!

This was the first time I have tried to cook lentils.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was I soaked the lentils for an hour before hand and I used a hole cup of lentils instead of 3/4.  I just added a half of can of water when I added the tomato sauce..oh and I used chicken tenders instead of bone in chicken.  It was really good.  I served it over basmati rice.  Next time I make it I'm going to add some spicy curry powder to it.  Yums!

this recipe was fairly easy and tasty.  I used canned chicken and added 1 can of Rotel and 1 can of tomato sauce.  I also used oregano and basil instead of rosemary and made the dish a little southwest.  Added Monterey jack cheese to the bowl and voila!  It was very good!

Tasty and easy.  I used diced chicken breast and red lentils.  Had leftover tomato/mushroom Marsala sauce from a meal I cooked earlier in the week so used that.  Added a few splashes of hot sauce to spice it up a little.  Garnished with a cheese of my choice.  Will make this recipe again.  Made enough for several "left over" meals.

I left out the  Salt andRosemary (because i didnt have any!). Used diced tomatoes instead of sauce. Also used chunks of chicken breast instead of bone in chicken. It was GREAT!! First time i ever cooked lentils,i did soak them a bit before cooking. But I will be making this quite often.

It's a great easy recipe. I've made it multiple times and I love it!!! It's hearty, tasty, home cooked meal. I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about lentils but doesn't know if they'll like the final product. Kids have even given me 2 thumbs up because they loved the taste...which I must say lentils usually wouldn't be one of those foods. Lol I would recommend soaking the lentils overnight or even while chopping veggies...it makes a difference in the cooking process.

I made this recipe as is (with the exception of using boneless, skinless chicken breast meat because that's what I already had on hand) and thought it was pretty decent.  I also thought it tasted a little better after sitting in the fridge for a day or two.

I give this 5 stars for being cheap, healthy and tasty.  I did not have tomato sauce or lemon juice, but it was just fine without.  As others suggested, I tossed everything in the crock pot for about 6 hours on high.  I used chicken thighs so the meat was really tender and falling apart and the general consistency was almost like a stew.  Served it over egg noodles to positive reviews from the entire family, toddler included.  Thanks for an easy, healthy weeknight meal.

The whole family loved it! I let the lentils soak as stated in several reviews. Also added spinach the last 10 minutes but that's just because we love it! Excellent the way it's written too.

Really good recipe.  Made it almost exactly but used boneless and skinless chicken breasts, 1 tsp. of fresh rosemary and forgot to add the lemon juice.  Husband proclaimed it "a keeper."  This one is going into rotation.  Thank you for sharing it.

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice now, and it is always so easy and delicious. The only difference is that I use boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of bone-in because it's easier.

I have made this several times, except I omit the rosemary (I hate rosemary), and I love it.  I actually don't use chicken though, I use bone-in ham steak and it's fabulous.  I've also tried it with smoked sausage, and that's my favorite.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Super easy & versatile.

Boneless, skinless breasts, didn't soak the lentils, had to sub shallot for onion, V8 for broth, and diced tomatoes for sauce (using what was in the cupboard), and forgot to add the herbs & lemon.  Still was very good & kids ate it.

I used green lentils and increased the cooking time. Instead of braising the chicken in the chicken stock liquid, I added the herbs and tomato sauce and braised the chicken in that for 40 minutes. Came out great!

Loved by the whole family (husband, 3 year old and myself)
Very easy and VERY good. I just changed a couple of things. I put my Lentils in water for about 45 min. I cut my chicken in chunks and cooked it fully. I used about 1/2 an onion.
I will be making this meal again

This turned out great. I soaked my lentils in salt water for about 2 hours before hand. I've not had much luck with them cooking to tender in the past without doubling or even tripling the cook time. This worked well. I also used 1 tsp basil instead of basil and rosemary because I dislike rosemary so much. I used boneless skinless breasts because that is all I buy and I also used salsa instead of tomato sauce because I did not have tomato sauce on hand. I will make this again and will probably use it a lot. It would be wonderful without the chicken as a side dish but the next time I make it, I will chunck the chicken.

An excellent dish that was very tasty.  The directions were clear and easy to follow.  It was my first time using lentils and I could have let them cook a few minutes longer, but even with that it was a very good dish.  Nice on a cold and rainy December evening.

Very good! Everybody liked this dish. I soaked the lentils as some had suggested and it did cut down the cooking time. I had chicken tenderloins that I cut into bite sized pieces and that cut down the cooking even further. I took the cumin substitution suggestion, used tomato puree, and added one of those Swanson's Flavor Boosts (veggie flavor) instead of salt. This was a great combo and will be made again.

My family and I love this dish. It has a great flavor and is very easy to prep and cook.  I make it with boneless, skinless thighs, and usually use red lentils.  I've made it a couple of times, and will definitely make it again.

This was delicious! I took a couple of the suggestions I read -- I used chicken breast cut into cubes, and for seasoning I eliminated the Rosemary and used 1 tsp. each of Basil, Cumin, and Turmeric. I was a little more generous with the chicken broth cause I didn't want it to be dry, I used a total of 16 oz. It was the perfect consistency for my husband and I, that of a lentil stew. I will definitely make this again, and the next time I think I'll add a little chopped parsley right before serving. Mahalo!

Never had lentils before, not to crazy about them.  They have texture like beans.  But the chicken itself was pretty good.  Not sure if make it again, unless our vegetarian friend comes over.

This was pretty good. I soaked the lentils for a few hours. I cut up 2 chicken breasts in bite sized pieces and cooked them. The only change I made was to add a splash of balsamic vinegar along with the lemon. We both agreed that this would have been better without the chicken, but perhaps I overcooked the chicken. We'd make it again.

This didn't go over well with my husband and I. We have a problem with the texture of the lentils. I soaked them for an hour per a previous reviewer and cooked them a tad longer as well. We didn't like how the lentil skins came off into the dish after soaking either. Perhaps this was the wrong recipe in which to try them for the first time. I ended makeing a salad with the chicken from this recipe instead.

I give this five stars, but only if I think of it as "Lentil Stew".  It's a delicious, healthy, and easy to prepare lentil stew.

Very yummy! I substituted mushrooms for the carrots, only because I was out. It was fabulous. I also used tomato paste in lieu of tomato sauce, for the same reason. It was great. I did add water a couple of times while cooking, probably due to lack of liquid without the tomato sauce. I will defintely make this again! Thanks.

This was very tasty and very filling.  I added more broth than called for so it wouldn't get dry...but then it was a little too watery so I mixed together cornstarch and a little white wine to thicken it up nicely. We enjoyed it very much.

We both loved this! I didn't have lemon juice on hand, but it turned out really well. It would be easier to eat with boneless/skinless meat. I agree with the other reviewers who suggested adding more broth- trouble is, how much? It seemed like I went through at least 4 cups of broth throughout the entire process... But I will make this again and again. Definitely.

I was very surprised by the final result.  Wasn't so sure while it was cooking.  I used red lentils and seasoned the chicken before browning with pepper, and poultry and Italian seasoning.  I like the addition of the tomatoe sauce.  It made the lentils creamy.

Recipe was great!  I couldn't believe how flavorful it was.  I would recommend soaking the lentils for a few hours before cooking them or cooking them for double the recommended time.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my favorites list.

To begin with I WAS afraid of the Lentil ingredient,  but as it turns out, I like lentils.  I thought this was very good.  My husband thought it was ok but isn't looking forward to it again so I think I'll make it for my mother and myself sometime.  I know she will love it.

Good overall.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were a little dry in the middle, so next time I'll try thighs.  The lentils were a bit bland (sauce was good, but too many lentils in a bite and it lacked flavor), so next time I think I'll add the spices when I return the chicken to the skillet, or maybe even earlier.

I didn't have all the ingredients called for in this recipe - I didn't have the carrot or the tomato sauce, and I used boneless skinless chicken tenderloins instead of bone-in pieces - and it still turned out great! Rich flavor, very moist and tender chicken - I will definitely make this again, as I imagine it will taste even better with the rest of the ingredients.
