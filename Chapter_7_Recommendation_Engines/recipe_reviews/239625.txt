My husband loved these so much as they were coming out of the oven, I’m not sure I’ll frost them. Perhaps half. And 8 cups of flour is a lot of cookies! I cooked 102 - 1” cookies and thats with sneaking dough-tastes. Cutting this recipe in half would make mixing a little easier too. I love Italian cookies! Not too sweet.
