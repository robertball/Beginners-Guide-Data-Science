The cinnamon was over powering and there was not enough other spices to deal with it.  Meat had no flavor, definately not what I remember of a great Ukrainian meal.

Instant Pot Update (made in 8 quart):  Put barley, onion soup, bay leaf, water and oxtail in instant pot.  Cook 40 minutes on soup/stew setting, natural release.  Remove oxtail and separate / shred meat.  Add remaining veggies and shredded meat to instant pot, cook 5 minutes on soup / stew setting, natural release.  The difference between the two methods, in the instant pot: the meat doesn't separate as easily, the barley is much softer, the color of the soup is not as vibrant .  Both methods are flavorful and the veggies are cooked. .  .  . .Alternate method for slow cooker soup: you can also cook the diced beets separately by boiling in water.  Add at end, because the barley will drain the color of the beets.  My daughters favorite!  The soup (without the sour cream) freezes well. I dice the beets to cook faster, if you want larger beets, cook separately and add at end to soup. No beet tops, add chopped Swiss chard.  You may have to add more seasoning (salt, pepper, onion soup), depending on amount of water added.
