After reading the other reviews I only used two cups of low fat sour cream and kept everything else pretty much the same. I do think I ended up using more chipotle peppers, but I am a big fan!  This is excellent on pita chips, tortilla chips and veggies!

A great twist on traditional ranch dip. I made this for my sister's wedding with rave reviews.  I used 1 1/2 packs as per another's suggestion and 3 whole chipotle peppers, chopped.  Thanks!

This dip is fantastic.  My husband and I use it at all of our parties and even take it to some.  We love it.  My only suggestion is that (even though this is inconvenient) use a packet and a half of ranch seasoning in the dip to give more flavor.  Also you can substitute  Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice and it gives the dips a slightly different taste that is really great.  Especially if you don't have a lime sitting around.  Overall this recipe is a real crowd pleaser!

I made this dip for a 4th of July party--- Little did I know I should have tripled it!!!  It was so good everyone was asking for the recipe and I've been asked to bring it back several times--even when I just come over to visit friends :)  
Also... the other day I made it as the "sauce" for my enchiladas!!!  SOO YUMMY!  This dip can be used for anything!!! WONDERFUL!

Instead of adding more Ranch seasoning, I just used less sour cream. I used one 16 ounce container and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Very tasty though next time I will use less cilantro or maybe leave it out completely. It was a little overpowering to me but everyone else liked the flavor.

i didn't have chipotle peppers so i roasted a combination of different peppers and blended them together in place of the peppers. it worked out quite good.
