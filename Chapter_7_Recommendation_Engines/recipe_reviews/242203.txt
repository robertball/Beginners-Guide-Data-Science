SOOOOO good! This has the perfect name bc it has all the freshest flavors of summer! I never would have thought to simmer cobs to make a broth, but it works well! I added about 1.5tsp of salt to really bring out the flavors. The only change I made was that I started out with 5 cups of water instead of 4. I figured with it simmering for so long, a lot of liquid would evaporate, and for 5 servings, I thought it could use the extra liquid. The 5 cups I started with reduced down to 4 cups of finished broth, which was perfect.  I'll be making this one again. It's the perfect summer soup, at a time of year when you don't normally crave soup!

Perfect receipe when your craving soup in the summer.  Light, right amount  of sweetness, delish.  Lends itself easily to variations and additions as desired.

Excellent base recipe but I did modify it based on what I had on hand. I added peas, onions and red peppers. Also added shrimp at the end for some protein. I'll make it again.

I added more water than suggested and halfed the tomatoes  (just because I ran out) and it was still great! I would recommend not adding salt in the cooking process and just put it on the table. I liked it but my wife though I over salted it.
