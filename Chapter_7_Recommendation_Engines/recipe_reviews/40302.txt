This is alright, I liked the addition of garlic, but not so much the dill, or pickle juice.  I'll stick to leaving the pickle as a garnish.  Thanks anyway Genevieve.

Here's another suggestion:  I saw an episode of "Paula's Home Cooking" yesterday, and she put ground beef boullion on the rim of the Bloody Mary glass!

This recipe for a Bloody Mary tasted okay, but the dill was too much.

This was my second Bloody Mary ever, so I am not the best judge, but I like it!  As someone suggested, I didn't add the dill - I'm not a big dill fan.  And I used the celery salt on the rim instead of in the drink as was done when I ordered the Bloody Mary at a resturant.  I garnished it with green olives and a pepperchini.  Also, I used straight tomato juice and I think it would be better with the tomato vegetable juice as suggested.

Genevieve, this is a good base for Bloody Marys! I love the addition of dill, I also add a touch of horseradish, and worstershire sauce, and a dash of black pepper. Try lining the rim of your glass with lime juice and Old Bay seasoning.

I agree, the dill is a bit much for my liking. But I did find the pickle juice interesting, thank you Genevieve. I used tequila instead of vodka and turned it into a Bloody Maria. I think tequila complements the spices so much better than vodka. I've converted almost everyone I know into staunch "Maria" lovers, even the ones who say they hate tequila!
