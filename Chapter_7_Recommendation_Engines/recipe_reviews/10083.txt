Tastes just like the pecan bars at my favourite bakery.  The only thing I did different was add more pecans.  Yum!

OMG...how could anyone rate these anything other than a 5 star? I love these. Just made them for my husband's thanksgiving meal at work. These are great for a potluck because you can cut them up and dont need silverware, plates, etc.  Much better than pecan pie, I think.  Crust resembles shortbread...but a little different.  I doubled the pecans as other reviewers suggested.  I will definitely make these again...THANKS!

It's true to it's word if you love pecan pie you will love these bars. I doubled the recipe and bake it in a jelly roll pan..got twice as many and they were wonderful.

Tip: I doubled the Pecans... measured them whole and pulsed them in the food processor until they were the right size.  I also toasted the Pecans first when they were whole.

For the crust, I used all butter... no margarine.  I also used 1/2 of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups standard flour and to add some heartiness. 

These were delicious!

Be careful when you put it in a jelly roll pan. I did that and had an absolute mess in my oven.  You have to be extra careful when putting it back in the oven.

My kids love this. It's really sweet and rich. I didn't even have enough corn syrup so I ended up using less, plus I substituted some honey, but was still short the whole amount. I can't imagine how sweet it would have been had I completed the recipe with the whole amount. I'll probably keep making it the way I accidentally did this time!

Good recipe, great flavor.  Def. needs to bake longer than 50 minutes at 275 degrees.  after that, I turned the oven up to 325 and baked an additional 22 minutes.  I used all butter too, didn't have margarine.

I used light corn syrup as that's all I had. I first tried one after it had cooled & it was good but I thought it lacked sweetness. After sitting overnight, it's pecan pie perfection! Thank you so much! I'll definately be making these often!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving when I realized too late I didn't have enough pie pans to make my pecan pie.  It was a great substitution, and I almost liked it better pecan pie!

Was looking for Pecan Pie in bar form and this was exactly what I wanted.  The filling was substantial vs the bar being primarily crust.  The only difference was I got 3 cups whole pecans and chopped it, using all 3 cups. It was delicious and held it's shape great.  I thought it would be soggy the next day but it tasted better each day!

This is an amazing recipe, that taste super YUMMY!!   I decided to make things a little sweeter and much faster, and I used graham cracker bits.  This gave the bars a much sweeter taste.  I would have given the recipe a 5, if I could have found a way to sweeten the pecans.

Followed the recipe, except extended the baking time to an hour, as recommended by several reviewers, and did not firmly pack the brown sugar - was almost out of it. Operator error! I ended up with an eggy cake like blondie, which was edible but not great. I have made the Pecan pie bars 1 recipe and felt it more closely resembled pecan pie - a favorite which goes over really well at southern potlucks. I think I will continue with my old recipe.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use all butter, light corn syrup and 1 1/2c pecans. For added sweetness, I substituted 1/4c of the corn syrup with 1/4c of molasses.  Tastes just like pecan pie with a "yummy factor" of 10!

These were delicious. Everybody who ate them raved about them.  I used all butter and had to bake my crust much longer than the recommended 10 minutes. Probably double that time. I baked until the crust not wobbly when I removed from oven. The rest went exactly as written. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Made them for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  I think I like them even better than pecan pie because of the crust on this, which is absolutely delicious!

Delicious!  They were a huge hit with my family and a party we went to.  Only 8 people and they were gone!!!  Very easy too.  I didn't have dark syrup and just used light...I will probably keep this change.  They were just so good!  Thanks for posting!

These were absolutely fantastic! I baked them the day before, refridgerated them overnight, and served them at Thanksgiving dinner. My family gobbled them up! However, i had to bake them about twice as long, because the middle was still liquidy when i tried to cut them. But these were delicious nonetheless! 5 stars for sure!

These were so good! I recommend using 2 cups pecans instead of 1 cup. Also, don't mix them into the filling. Instead sprinkle them evenly on top. This way all the nuts get toasted rather than just baked into the filling. After they cool for a while put them in the fridge for an hour or so. The taste will develop and get even better. I definitely recommend these!!

I added them to my cookies this year for Christmas and they were delicious.  They tasted exactly like pecan pie.  The only change I made was to use light corn syrup because that was all I had on hand.

These are fantastic!!  I doubled the pecans as some reviewers suggested.  I only had butter, so I used a cup in the crust.  These bars are so rich, they are almost sinful.  Delicious!  A huge hit at my family Christmas gathering.  Thanks!

Delicious! 4 stars as is, but 5 stars if you double the pecans like another reviewer suggested.

Absolutely delicious!  I've made this twice now, and used all butter both times.  The second time I reduced the butter by 2 Tablespoons and this made the bottoms less oily.  I'll reduce it a bit more next time to see if it still holds together properly.  This was just my preference to make them easier to eat out of hand with less messiness.  I also used more pecans based on other reviews.  You can't really have too many pecans in pecan pie in my opinion.  These disappear quickly with husband and son around and are very easy to make.  They are also attractive enough to serve as a dessert with plates and forks.  Great recipe!

These were AWESOME!!!!! I did as some of the others suggested and doubled the pecans, otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and they came out perfect.  Very addicting little devils though.....
I will definitely be making these for Thanksgiving instead if pies.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

So I think the recipe is delicious, however the cooking time seems to be off for me. I took it out after only 50 minutes, and it was not at all done. I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes and that seemed to do the trick. So I would recommend more like an hour in the oven, not 50 minutes.

I was not impressed with these bars.  The filling was gritty and not as good as a pecan pie.  I won't make them again.

I followed this recipe completely but I have to say that these were the worst pecan bars I have ever tasted.  I was so dissapointed because all the reviews were so good.  I don't know what happened but the taste of these is not good at all.

I just made these today and absolutely love 'em! They are very simple to make and have the perfect amount of pecans. The only thing is there is a little too much dough for me. I like more of the filling so I think next time I'll take the dough ingeridents down by a 1/4 and see how that works. Other than that they are very, very yummy!

I only wanted a small pan of pecan pie bars so I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a 8 x 8 glass dish.  In place of 2 T. of butter/margarine I used 6 T. of flaxseed meal.  I baked the crust a little longer than called for because it just didn't seem to be baking fast enough.  I don't know if that was from the flaxseed meal or what.    I only used 2 eggs and added a splash of bourbon.  I doubled, chopped and toasted the pecans first.  I baked the bars at 275 in a convection oven for about 35 minutes.  They are chewy and delicious.  I only gave them 4 stars because I don't know if they are the "best" pecan pie bars or not.  The flaxseed meal was good and added a little nuttier flavor plus made them a tiny bit healthier.  I'll make these again.

These bars are delicious!  I think the next time I make them I'm going to cut the butter by 1/4.  2 sticks seems a little too much.
The first 2 times I made them i only had light corn syrup so I used 1/2 C brown sugare and 1/4 C white to add some of that dark / molasses flavor.  they were good.  But this time, I bought the dark corn syrup - had used up all the light!! - and they were phenominal. 
 Also, I used twice the pecans.

I used all butter in the crust and I toasted the pecans in the oven first and let them cool while I baked the crust and made the topping. It was a  big hit at the potluck! I'm going to make the crust with gluten free all purpose flour  for my gluten free son!

YUM!! 
I changed up a recipe just a little bit because it seemed like quite a lot of sugar to me (my family and I like our sweets, but not too sweet!) In the shortbread crust I added only 1/2 cup of brown sugar rather then a whole cup and baked for 15 minutes.  I added 3/4 cup butter instead of 2 cups of the mixed.  I only used 1/4 cup of white sugar and added in an extra cup of chopped pecans. Cannot wait to dig in tomorrow after Thanksgiving dinner! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were great when they were warm and fresh, but after a day old, became a little bland. And the egg flavor in the filling started to come out quite a bit. I'm not sure that I would make these again.

I made these ahead for Thanksgiving this week, thinking they would be a good substitution for Pecan Pie. I thought they were, but my husband says no.  What does he know anyway???!! That's why the four stars, since the name is Pecan PIE Bars.  Try using more pecans and topping with whipped cream.  YUMMY!!!

Super Easy. The only change I made was to double the amount of pecans, I'm not crazy about the gel. I also added a light sprinkle of salt before cooking for that sweet salty effect.

I will not make this again. I followed the recipe and the crust never got hard. It was always mushy. I put them back in the oven three times and the crust never did anything. Then the top was too crispy. I threw them all out.

I was disappointed in the results, especially the crust of the pecan bar was pasty and unedible.  It definitely needed more cooking time than 10 minutes and and 275 degrees was too low to adequately cook this recipe.  The bars were gooey and no one wanted to eat something that looked undercooked and unhealthy.

These did not come out well for me at all.  They were dry and the crust did not set well.  May try it again just in case I did something wrong.

The taste and texture of the filling is excellent.  This is ruined, however, by the crust which is overly greasy and mushy.

These are pretty good, but when I asked my husband how he liked them he said, "You've made better."  So that's why it only gets 4 stars.
