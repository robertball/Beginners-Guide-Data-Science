I've made several of these 'make ahead' casseroles and this is by far the best.  It doesn't dry out, it's very flavorable and just the right thickness!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've lost track of how many times I've made it.  People at work have started asking for morning birthday parties so that I will bring this instead of a cake!I use summer sausage and it adds a great flavor.

This was great. Followed mostly as written; I subbed mushrooms for the sausage and I cut the recipe in half (cooked it in a square 8-inch pan). Not too eggy tasting, which my boyfriend prefers. Yum!

I really didn't like this recipe.  It was blah tasting - I kept thinking I left out something, but I didn't.  I think it was because of the bread -- way too much, it drowned out everything.  It looked nice, but tasted bland.

My mother-in-law said, "This may be the best thing I've ever eaten for breakfast." (I used ham instead of kielbasa.)

The flavor of this strata is great. I had a bit of a problem with getting all of the liquid/egg mixture to cook like some of the other reviewers. I think next time I'll reduce the liquid a bit and it should be fine. I baked it for the allotted time, then covered it with foil to prevent burning and let it cook longer. It mostly solved the problem, but it was still a bit mushy on the bottom of the pan.

The flavor of this recipe was outstanding - green onions, cheddar, cream, yum.  I modified this recipe for 4, and I think the measurements the website gives don't really translate well.  I couldn't get it to firm up.  After an hour and a half in the oven, I gave up.  And even with foil on top to keep it from burning, the top still got really tough, so really no part of it was serviceable.  I'm so disappointed because like I said, it tasted good.

Made this recipe for my child's 1st communion brunch.  Delicious.  Plan to make it Christmas morning, as it is soooooo easy!

I had a breakfast with Santa brunch today and everyone loved it...it was gone within minutes and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I did change the recipe a touch by using sausage and letting the bread cubes sit out overnight to dry out a little bit.  This recipe is one to save.  Also, I had a second dish in the oven at the same time so it took a bit longer so the top finished before the rest so I covered it with aluminum and let it bake a little longer.  This was excellent!!!

Nice fluffy recipe.

Being from Canada, I made the recipe with 8oz of back bacon.

I used 7 eggs instead of 10, and it was still as fluffy as it should be.

Instead of dry mustard, I used about 2 tblsp. of dijon mustard.

This was an awesome recipe that I will use again!

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  I made a few minor adjustments.  I used the entire 13oz package of turkey kielbasa and 3/4 loaf of a 16oz Italian baguette.  I also didn't have dry mustard so I substituted 1TB of prepared mustard.  The strata was a tad watery after cooking but everything was fully cooked.  I think next time I'll reduce the milk to 3 cups instead of 4. I also think I will chop the kielbasa into small pieces next time as well.  Overall the flavor was fantastic and it was so simple!

Yep!  It's as good as they say.  Easy easy, and therefore fun!  The smoked sausage or kielbasa and onions add a nice flavor.  I picked this recipe to use up half a loaf of ww bread.  As others suggested, I reduced the milk to about 3 cups.  Turned out perfect and I will make again.

This was a hit at the office.  The french bread lent a nice texture, better than the white bread stratas.  Also, we are blessed with many fine German and Czech sausages here in south central Texas so I used a good pork/venison garlic sausage.  The nutmeg added a nice earthy flavor reminiscent of some of my favorite Norwegian recipes.  Bravo!

***WARNING*** DO NOT PREHEAT OVEN BEFORE PLACING PYREX OR ANY KIND OF GLASS BAKING DISH IN A HOT OVEN! PLACE COLD CASSEROLES IN A COLD OVEN!!!! PLACE DISH INTO COLD OVEN FROM REFRIGERATOR AND THEN TURN ON TO 375! Your dish will break/shatter if placed into hot oven straight from refrigeration!
I've made many stratas over the years. It still takes 45 min - 1 hour to bake.

I make breakfast for 30 people once a month and this is one of the menu items.  It always gets compliments and requests for the recipe.  I love that it can be made the night before.  I use ham.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

It was OK. I added extra spices after reading other comments. I cut the milk in half and doubled the amount of bread. But it was still pretty soggy. I think with a little tweaking it will be a great recipe. It was very easy to put together. Thanks!
