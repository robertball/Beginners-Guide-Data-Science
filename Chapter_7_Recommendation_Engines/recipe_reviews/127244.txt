This is a great fruit salad that I make during the Holidays.  I omit the coconut and add walnuts or pecans instead, and also add a drained jar of halved maraschino cherries.   This recipe is great to make to taste, use the fruits in syrup for a sweeter taste and the fruits in juice for a nice light fresh taste! I also use the pineapple tidbits instead of the chunks to make it easier to eat. Adding more marshmallows makes it drier just in case there's too much juice.  And it's better the next day!

Made this, except swapped the sour cream for vanilla greek yogurt, and added walnuts & nectarines and it was awesome.  Creamy, tangy, and sweet.  Would make an excellent healthy breakfast with the yogurt swap (and maybe minus the marshmallows...)

My mother-in-law makes this recipe, and it's so easy and good.  I also add halved maraschino cherries, bananas, and a little sugar to the sour cream.  This is our family favorite.

Been making this recipe for years. I only make for the holidays. If I don't, dinner just isn't the same. Yummy!

Pretty good - the sour cream gave it a bit of a sweet and salty kind of feel. I think next time I'll just use cool whip. But thanks for sharing!

Loooove this fruit salad! My aunt introduced me to it three years ago and my hubby hasn't gotten enough of it yet! Don't change a thing, it's perfect.

Good, but too sweet for us... un-naturally sweet.  It didn't taste healthy or "home made."  Next time will use cream cheese.  There is a really good fruit dip on this site that uses cream cheese and it would be good incorporated into this recipe somehow.  Thanks for sharing, though.  The kids liked it!

Hubby and I are not a big fan of fruit, and are always looking for yummy ways to get fruit on the table.  What's not to like about THIS recipe!  We will be making this again!
