This is very similar to a Mexican dish called calabacitas.  The differences are to omit the bacon-but you can use bacon grease, add diced tomatoes and some garlic while cooking the zucchini, or Mexican squash.  You can also add chopped green chili.  Cover and cook diced zuch and tomatoes with spices, onion and garlic until tender (10-15 mins. Don't over cook). Add corn (I use canned), heat through and top with cheese--cover till melted.  I use cheddar cheese but I'm sure the MJ is very good. Mexican squash looks like zucchini except that it is a light green color.

What a wonderful sidedish this was!  My whole family enjoyed it more than the pork roast I served it with.  I was too lazy to use corn from a cob, so I just thawed some frozen corn, and I accidentally bought Colby cheese, but it tasted great.  I also diced up the bacon before cooking it, as I find it easier than crumbling it afterwards.  This will be a regular dish from now on.

Fantastic! Everyone loved it even my brother who despises vegetables. 

The cheese seemed unnecessary and I will probably leave it out next time.

5/30/06--- Loved this! I didn't have monterrey jack so I subbed a mixture of mozzarella & parmesan. UPDATE 6/01/06----I used the leftovers from this for a snack as a wrap. I spread vidalia onion vinaigrette onto a warm flour tortilla & loaded it w/ the reheated Melody. Wonderful!!!!

I really loved this recipe! After I made it, it looked like A LOT and figured I'd be eating leftovers for a week.... not so, the bowl was empty that very night.
I ended up using frozen corn because we don't have fresh corn in Alaska this time of year. I also didn't have monterey jack cheese so I just used this cheddar/monterey jack blend. One addition I added was some chopped red bell pepper.
You could do a ton of variations on this if you wanted-- very VERSATAILLE!

This was excellent fresh cooked, but did not taste as good reheated since the zucchini tends to get overcooked and watery when microwaved. Those who thought it mushy to begin with probably overcooked the vegetables.  It tastes best tender-crisp.

Delicious and simple!!  I used frozen corn and fresh zucchini and it worked really well.  I added diced red peppers and about a teaspoon of butter to the bacon drippings for a little added flavor.  I also omitted the cheese and let the crumbled bacon simmer with the corn and zucchini for the last 2 or 3 minutes of cooking.  Everyone, including my picky 2 year old, LOVED it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Super easy and very refreshing.  I used canned corn, drained, and it turned out great.  For a little added crunch I added some french fried onions when served.

Really quite tasty!  The bacon lends a nice taste throughout the veggies.  I used frozen corn and broccoli and fresh onion.  I will make this again.

We all thought this was great!!  I used less than a tablespoon of bacon fat in a no-stick pan, sauteeing the squash and onion for 5 minutes, then adding the corn and heating for the 10 minutes.  Wonderful flavor, color and texture!  Thanks!!

Corn on its own is just...corn.  So is zucchini...just zucchini.  Put the two together, add some bacon (and garlic) and we've got something special.  Too good as is to add cheese, so I didn't.

Although not huge zucchini lovers we did really enjoy this recipe.   I used uncured apple smoked bacon and added some grape tomatoes for color and a small clove of garlic, minced, for flavor.  It took less than five minutes for my vegetables to be crisp/tender.  Although I used fresh corn frozen would have worked just as well.  The cheese was not necessary to make this a five star veggie combo.   Served alongside a simple baked haddock topped with Bostonâ€™s Legal Seafood style oyster cracker crumbs, this was both a tasty and attractive dish.

This is really tasty. I used turkey bacon, so I added olive oil for the drippings. Also added salt, garlic powder, and fresh parsley (since I had it on hand). Thanks for the recipe! I don't think I would have thought of this combo on my own.

Very tasty but make sure you do not overcook the zucchini because it will get mushy.

Delicious!  We really enjoyed this very different recipe.  The zuchinni and corn was a wonderful mix!  SO flavorful!!  It took a little more time since I used fresh corn, but I will probably try it w/ frozen corn the next time just to see if it's close in taste.  If not, I'll take the extra few minutes necessary for the fresh corn.  It's worth it!  Also, the onion and bacon really added to the wonderful flavor.  I wouldn't leave anything out of this one!

Really delicous.  My bacon didn't yield much dripping so I used vegetable oil and had to add some salt for flavoring.  But both my husband and I enjoyed it tremendously.

Awesome!!  I added 1/2 of a chopped red bell pepper for color and 3 extra pieces of bacon and some minced garlic.  I also increased the cheese to 1/2 cup.  Quarter zucchini in 1/2" slices for best texture.  Very good recipe.

This was easy to prepare and very tasty. I doubled the recipe and used red onion for a little more color. Everyone loved it. Although I think anything you top with cheese and bacon would be a hit.

You know a recipe's good when one of your young piglets decides to finish the dish right out of the serving bowl! Of course she asked if anyone else wanted the rest before she did it. (thanks goodness we taught her manners, ha, ha) I always add more seasonings, but what more can I say Gail?

The bacon and cheese were what I could taste the most - which is good, cuz I love both! I love bacon and cheese in just about anything. I used thawed frozen corn and cut the zucchini in rounds, then quarters. I think keeping the zucchini thick and chunky allows it to stay crisp yet tender (it cooks fast).  This was very filling.  I served it with mushroom rice and the Pan fried asparagus (this site) and hubby and I were stuffed.

This week I got lots of fresh vegetables without any idea how I was going to use them.  I love this site because you can just search for ideas.  I found this recipe and I had all the ingredients.  I added some garlic. Yummy!

What a wondeful vegetable dish!  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  My little guy who doesn't usually eat zucchini ate it all.  The monterey and bacon added another dimension to the already delicious vegetables.  This will definitely be a keeper in my house.

My husband loved this dish, even though he claims to hate zucchini.  For me the bacon taste was too overwhelming.  Next time I'll just adjust proportions.

Love this!  Sauted the veggies in olive oil instead of bacon fat, used bacon pieces (packaged) instead.  Could have done w/out the cheese, didn't need it.  My kids didn't like it, but I loved it!

I used canned corn and leftover Swiss and cheddar cheese  that needed to be used. My teenager who normally doesn't like anything green (other than money!) ate a big helping without ANY complaints. Definitely a repeat recipe. Next time I will double it for some leftovers!

This was a great way to use up the sweet corn and zucchini from the farmers market.  It was so yummy!  I didn't add onion (used onion poweder for flavor) since my brother despises onion, but probably will the next time I make this.  Thanks!!!

Serves 5 ... not in this house! My DH ate four servings of this himself! I didn't have Jack cheese on hand so I used reduced fat Mexican cheese (yummy). I will make a slight change next time but I don't think it will change anything but lower the calories a bit. I will reduce the bacon to 2 slices and bacon fat to 1/2 T. For those of you on WW ... with this change and making it serve 4 instead of 5, it will be 4 pts.

Wow! So good. I doubled the bacon and zucchini and did not add onion. I also added fresh garlic to the saute. So delish. I used a good quality smoked bacon. Could not get enough. Making this again tonight.

Hubby loved this and so did I.  It's wonderful how all the flavors are enhanced by the bacon and cheese.  It's a keeper.  NOW I know what to do with my zucchini.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

YUM!  This recipe was delicious!  I made a few changes, due to the items I had on hand.  I made with butternut squash instead of zucchini, I used a can of shoepeg corn, and I also used mild cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack.  I was a little unsure about the bacon, but it actually added a nice touch!  It turned out great!  Very yummy!

Very good.  I was surprised at how much this makes.  I used a mexican cheese blend, as that is what I had, and used a bit more black pepper.  I also used a few sprays of a non-caloric butter spray that's made for corn on the cob.  Thanks for sharing!

This vegetable dish is a WINNER.  Face it: bacon grease makes everything taste better.  I added some chopped red bell pepper to make this a colorful and delicious dish.  The leftovers were great...the zucchini was a little more soggy, but it was wonderfully flavorful.

I realy enjoyed this as a side dish to the Burgundy Pork Tenderloin (from this site) we had for last evenings dinner. Would never have thought sauteing this combo in that tad amount of  bacon drippings could add so much flavor.

I would not recommend this. After adding the cheese, the whole thing turned into a greyish goopy glue thing. I threw it out after tasting. We had to go with a back-up dish!

I used butter instead of the bacon grease, since none of us likes bacon greased vegetables, and it came out really good that way too.  Husband loved it, and one daughter loved it too (the other wouldn't touch it because it had zucchini in it), and I personally liked it alot.  The kid that hates it will just have to suffer!

Made it twice. Cut in half for two and for a twist, I added fresh tomatoes and fresh oregano in the last minute or two before the cheese and bacon.  It was really fresh tasting and pretty.  I didn't have jack cheese so I used a Mexican blend I had on hand - just a sprinkle on top!  Don't overcook it.  All the veggies are better with crispness and the tomatoes don't need to really cook at all.

Quick, easy, tasty! Tasted it before adding the cheese so probably won't use the cheese next time as it was plenty flavorful without it. Unfortunately some of my zucchini was bitter, but we really enjoyed this dish. Only added some garlic as others had suggested.

Very good!  We all enjoyed it!  I used Turkey bacon peices, 1 zucchini, corn, 1/2 onion and a small yellow peper.   Very good!  Did not add any cheese!  The flavors are incredible!

A friend gave me a bag of zucchini and decided to try different recipes on this site and this is one of them that I choose.  And....so glad I did!  Only change I made was to use a mexican blend cheeses because I did not have M/J on hand.  Personally, we felt that the bacon made this recipe.  Thanks, Molson7, for submitting such an easy and tasty side dish!!

Delicious!  My daughter is slowly veering away from certain veggies (zucchini being one) :(  so I made it this way to see if she'd like it better.  She did!  I normally MAKE her eat at least half her veggies but this time she ate about half on her own.  Nice recipe to get the kids to eat there vegetables!

i thought this recipe was good. i used the pre-cooked bacon instead of reg. oops! i didn't see i need the bacon grease before i bought it. for the corn i used what was left from the herbed corn recipe from here. it was exactly enough.we used Romano cheese instead of m. jack.  hubby said it needed more cheese and bacon and next time leave out the corn & onion lol. i do agree it needed alot more bacon and i added extra cheese to mine.

Wow!  this was unexpectly REALLY good!   Even my "anti-veggie" husband loved it!  What a tasty way to enjoy summer vegetables, fresh from the garden.   I've made it twice - once just as written, and the first time with cheddar cheese and the real bacon bits that come in a jar - because that's all I had on hand.   I did add a chopped tomato the second time, for a little added color - and because I had a lot of tomatoes harvested.  It was yummy both ways!   I'm planning to make this with grilled buffalo burgers for company.   Because my husband REQUESTED it.   Wow - that's just shocking!  LOL

Used two slices of bacon. Took bacon out and just put everything else in the drippings. Didn't transfer to a bowl before putting bacon or cheese back in. Loved it and husband loved it too.

We tried this recipe out last night and it was incredible! I don't eat red meat so I opted for turkey bacon, but the zesty flavors of the vegetables cooked in the drippings and the snap of the cheese fooled my husband into thinking it was pork. We'll be using this again soon.

Fast, Easy and Delicious! Everyone loved it. Followed recipe except cooked onions for a few minutes and then added zucchini and corn for the last 6 or 7 minutes. Perfect side dish. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this (what's not to like about bacon and cheese!), but my family disagreed.  I did sub turkey bacon and added some diced red pepper too.  Not sure if I'll make it again, but it gave me some ideas of other combinations to try!

THis was really really good. I even got my family who hates zucchini to eat it. I did use the bacon grease but didn't put the bacon in it and used to a little bit of parmesan cheese as that is what I had on hand.

This tastes great.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I recommend that people only use one tablespoon of the drippings as recommended - any more than these vegetables would get greasy.  This whole recipe only requires one cooking vessel, which is very handy, and both the taste and appearance of the dish is awesome.  Thanks!

This was excellent!!  I added some garlic and of course extra bacon!  I didn't add the zucchini until the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking to avoid the overcooking.  Thanks for sharing this one!!

This dish was so simple and delicious.  I used precooked bacon, canned corn, green onions, and cheddar cheese, just because I had them on hand.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!! After I sauted all the veggies I did have to drain it bec it was alittle watery. I also added some garlic and think tomatoes would go good with it too. Oh and I used mozzaralla cheese bec thats all I had. Great way to use up all the zucchinni coming from my garden this year. Will def make again.

I didn't care for this, my husband thought it was good though.  It just had a weird woody taste too it.  When I saute zucchini it's usually with onion, bacon grease, butter, garlic salt, onion powder then I add a Roma tomato and some cheese so I thought this would've been good since it's similar but the blend of ingredients just didn't seem to go well with each other.  Maybe it was the corn??

Deliciously complex yet subtle flavors in this pretty dish.  Used precooked bacon and sauteed the veggies in olive oil instead of bacon drippings.  Also tossed in a handful of chopped tomato at the end because I had some leftover in the fridge...added extra color.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I like to use Hormels "Real Crumbled Bacon" with picnic bacon which has 50% less fat than pan fried bacon and I also use 2% shredded cheese which cuts down on fat and calories. This recipe is a "must try". It's a definite keeper!

This recipe is Fantastic.  My husband can't wait for me to make it again.  I've already made it twice.  The bacon gives this dish lots of flavor, and it goes with everything.  Good way to use zucchini from the garden.....

What an easy and quick sidedish!  The flavors combine so well.  When I cook bacon, I always cook the whole package, transferring the drained, un-used  part to a freezer container.  Later, that shortens the prep time of other recipes.

I really loved this!  I did not add the monterey jack cheese because my husband doesn't like cheese and didn't want the added fat.....it still was delicious!  I made the mistake of adding a clove of garlic...normally I love garlic but you don't need it; it overpowered the flavor of the zucchini and corn.  I used frozen green giant white corn niblets.  Next time I will only use 2 pieces of bacon; I think that's enough and I really don't want the added fat calories.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  I can't wait to use the zucchini that I am growing in my garden!

My boyfriend LOVED this!  He said it is the best dinner I have ever made!  I cooked everything beforehand, put the veggies in a casserole dish, topped it with the cheese and bacon and put it in the oven until the cheese was melted.  It sure looked like a lot when I put everything in the skillet, but really wasnÂ´t that much after cooking.  Next time I will double it and add mushrooms.  As a main dish, my guy ate more than 3/4, along with 3/4 of another zucchini dish I made up on my own.  Two thumbs up from Marc!

I made this tonight for dinner and I agree with everyone else who rated this recipe, it is delicious and makes a beautiful presentation! It taste's great with or without the cheese. One word of caution when cutting the corn from the cob, the corn flies everywhere if you're not careful. To make this recipe even easier, I used the already cooked bacon you can now buy in the stores.Just fry it in the pan for 30 seconds and you will have enough grease for the recipe. Enjoy!

This was pretty good - a nice change of pace from plain veggies.  I didn't have any cheese, so we left it out, but it was still good.  I don't think it'll be a regular item on our table, it will be nice once in a while.

I fix this without the bacon as a low fat alternative and cooked the veggies in a little olive oil instead.  Great with or without a little shredded cheddar sprinkled on the top.  This will become a staple side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

We're always looking for a new way to use up our abundance of zucchini in the summer. The bacon really gave it a nice flavor. This was tasty and different!

I found fresh yellow zucchini at the produce market this week, what a surprise, and I remembered making this with my own garden fresh produce last summer, so I tried it again...almost as wonderful!!  I change the onion to a large one, use frozen corn as the Alaska person did but I also add a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce to the bacon grease and a sprinkle of Nature's seasoning, which has garlic, pepper, chives and parsley in it.  (Very yummy on most veggies!)  I also change the cheese to low-fat motzerella!

My girls wanted zucchini for a Thanksgiving vegtable.  I had no idea how I was going to fix it.  Finding this recipe was great-- it was easy and the kids loved it as well as the adults.  It was a big success!!!! Thanks!! Plus being able to adjust the recipe for 15 people was great.

I really love this dish.  Last time I didn't add the cheese because I was having it with another cheese-dish.  I will use this all year long.  Even with frozen corn it's still good.

As a New Englander, I love a good casserole dish. This was wonderful. I had some meatloaf leftover and I crumbled it and added it to the casserole a meal in one dish with leftovers for the next day.

I love zucchini and am always looking for new ways to serve it.  The real test is if my husband likes it or not and he went back for two more helpings.  My kids wouldn't touch zucchini with a ten foot pool, but I'm a huge vegetable fan and usually serve two or three vegetable dishes with our meals so everyone has something to choose from.  This was quick to make... I put it together while our ham was cooking... and a nice change of pace to the usual ho-hum meal.

I left out the cheese topping when I made this. Never knew how well corn and bacon went together. This is very simple to make and has great flavor. I dont have much experience cooking zucchini or squash and am not a fan of the tomato sauce zucchini I often encounter. This is far superior to that side dish and I made sure to keep from overcooking to ensure everything still had texture. Fantastic and will definitely be making this again!

This was fantastic! I added fresh diced jalapeÃ±os and shallots. I also used TJ's frozen grilled corn instead of fresh corn. I sautÃ©ed everything in an iron skillet and when the veggies were ready, I topped with the cheese and bacon and put it under the broiler and browned it. It was a great presentation and tasted superb, and the adults and kids both went back for seconds and thirds. I scraped out the seeds from the zucchini before sautÃ©ing, which made it less watery and it was great for leftovers (although I rarely have any left).

This was great even though I omitted the bacon. Instead I sprinkled on some Epicure "bacon-like" seasoning.  

Update: made again and just used bacon seasoning but found it a little bland. Next day ate it cold but grated some cheddar in and added imitation crab. This made it a lot tastier.

Made again without bacon. sprinkled a little cumin on it and added feta. it was great.

This is so good. It's best to cook to tender crisp.  I add yellow squash and extra bacon at times. I prefer the recipe without the cheese.

I made this today for lunch and fell in love. Instead of regular bacon, I used turkey bacon and added some sweet balsamic vinaigrette for a different taste. No other seasonings were needed. Will make again!!

Delish! Even my picky husband liked this (although he thinks this would be better without the zucchini lol!). :) How can you go wrong with BACON, fresh corn and cheese???!!??!??!? I loved the sweetness of the corn, the smokiness of the bacon and how the zucchini tied it all together (and added a nice little nutritional boost!). This paired PERFECTLY with my Cinco de Mayo meal of guisado verde and saffron rice. Thanks for sharing your recipe, MOLSON! This will make MANY appearances at my dinner table, especially during the bountiful summer months! :-)

This was great! I've sauteed zucchini and summer squash many times, but adding the bacon made this way better. I used one zucchini and one crookneck squash, and I added in some grape tomatoes, halved. It was delicious with dinner and reheated well the next day.

This is a very yummy side dish. I did not have an onion, but I did add a seasoning blend called "Spike" and I used colby/jack cheese. It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again, next time with an onion.

Delicious!  We don't use black pepper, so I sprinkled the medley with kosher salt and garlic powder. A wonderful dish.

My new favorite zucchini side dish!  Excellent flavors; loved the bacon & cheese!  I did use olive oil instead of bacon drippings, but don't use too much!

I thought this was a nice change of pace from our roasted or sauteed zucchini.  The flavors and textures were comforting and paired well with the flank steak I made.  I added about 1/4 t salt as well as the pepper, and I'm glad I did.  I didn't have any fresh corn so I used a can of shoepeg corn.  Next time I make this I will use less corn, maybe by half.

Yummy!  We loved this recipe.  I only had Colby/Monterey Jack, but it was delicious.  Will be a family favorite for sure.  Can't wait to eat it again.

No need to measure - I chopped up  3/4 of a summer squash, 1/2 tomato, 1/3 red onion and sauteed after the bacon pieces finished browning. Put it all in a ramekin along with the bacon & topped with shredded Montery Jack - baked for 5 min in the warming oven and we enjoyed every bite. This recipe is a keeper

Very nice. I was in a rush to prepare this before my power went out again due to the Hurricane so I forgot the bacon. Didn't really matter because it was still very good. I did add garlic and red pepper flakes and used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack because that's all I had. Will make this again for sure. Next time I will try with the bacon.

Very good!! My hubby didn't seem interested until I made it one night for a late quick dinner. He said he didn't think it would be good at all but he loved it!! I made it with pre-cooked bacon (hormel from cost-co is the best) so it was really fast.

Wonderful recipe! I used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow summer squash, diced. Happened to have 2 ears of fresh corn left from last nights dinner so I cut the kernels from that. I did 5 slices of bacon, drained off all but about 2 TB and added some olive oil, and a TB of butter....needed the extra calories :)  I started the squash and after about 3 minutes or so I added the diced onion and also 2 cloves of minced garlic. Seasoned with salt and pepper as it was cooking.  I had a Mexican blend of Cheddar and Monterey Jack so I used that plus about 1/4 cup of shredded Parmesan.  Hubby loved it! Another super hit recipe for summers abundant squash.  Served this with a lovely marinated grilled Swordfish with a Cucumber Sauce. Perfect summer meal! Definitely a keeper!

Had fresh zucchini from the garden and needed a new recipe. The family adored this! I used frozen corn and added in Nature's Seasoning. No leftovers from our family of six. Even the 2 y.o. ate it up.

I cheated and used precooked bacon and canned corn. Very yummy. After sauteing the zucchini and onion I just mixed in the bacon and corn, put the shredded cheese on top and put the lid on the melt the cheese. I will make this again. Also I used 2 medium zucchinis for anyone wanting to know how many to buy! This was a little more than 2 cups.

I did not care for this at all! I was surprised because of the reviews. I chose this recipe because I was looking at another similar one, but it had 2 full blocks of cheese and this one only had 1/2 cup. However, even the 1/2 cup of cheese seemed out of place! It might be because it wasn't baked? The cheese would not stick to the ingredients. I am guessing because of the greasiness? I like all of the ingredients, they are actually some of my favorites, but they didn't taste good together at all! And, the whole onion I thought was a little much, for one pan, as it and the corn domninated the dish. I really hate to rate recipes this low, but I found the mix of flavors and textures in this dish to be very strange and it ended up being tossed, because I wouldn't serve it.

I think this was awesome for a side dish or if you have a large serving it will fill you up for dinner or lunch!  We didn't even have left overs.  I did not use bacon grease for veggies and took the advise of another reviewer and used olive oil.  I used fresh corn which tasted fabulous.  I added some sea salt and garlic and topped with a mexican blend cheese.  great flavors, easy to make, and i couldn't ask for more!  we will make this again.

Everyone in our family thought that the bacon flavor in this recipe was overwhelming. I will make this again because I really liked the combination of vegetables, but I will use olive oil so that the flavor of the vegetables comes through.

This was really yummy and very easy to make.  I didn't feel like frying some backon so I used the packaged bacon bits and the leftover bacon grease from breakfast.  I substituted canned corn for fresh and was all out of monteray jack so I used the cheddar I had on hand.  It still turned out delicious! I'll definitely make this again!

This is good as a main too over rice.  I added about 1/4 lb sausage when used as a main.  Very good.

This was a hit.  I sauteed the veggies in olive oil and seasoned with a little garlic.  I used Parmesan cheese in place of Monterey Jack.  No leftovers!!

Well, let me start out by saying that I left out the bacon entirely- The stuff I had on hand was expired! So I used a little bit of olive oil and some sea salt to stir-fry the veggies instead, and then added the cheese per the recipe. Pretty tasty, and I can't wait to try it with the bacon!

It was so good my husband told me multiple times throughout dinner and that we needed to make sure and get this recipe for future uses. Changes I made:  used cheddar and swiss cheese (because that's what I had) and threw in a mushroom that needed to by used up.

This was very good.  I had some corn leftover, so I added that the last few minutes.  I think I'll try this again with some garlic and a pinch of cayenne for some heat

This was good, but the bacon and cheese really defeat the "healthiness" of veggies.  The second time I made it with just corn, zucchini, onions - added 1 tbsp bacon grease and 1 tbsp olive oil - seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  SautÃ©ed, was prefect and both of my boys loved it!

This was good!  I used bacon bits because I had them on hand which made it a much quicker dish.  The flavors go well together.  Fast and easy, thanks!

This is a great recipe!  We used zucchini, corn and onions right from our garden.  I cook with an iron skillet and decided to make this recipe at our annual family campout.  It was a hit!  It has great visual appeal as well as great taste.

I was looking for a quick, easy way to cook up my zucchini, thinking I would bake them with some shredded parmesan cheese, when I saw this recipe. Thinking it would be nice to get in more veggies, I made it, using pepper jack cheese instead, and LOVED it. Unfortunately, I did not have any onions but I'm really looking forward to making this again with the missing ingredient.

Great easy recipe! Perfect for a 'fresh from the garden' meal. I added garlic and salt, used frozen corn, and omitted the cheese. Fantastic. The first time I served it, I was asked for the recipe and we have eaten weekly at our house. Thank you for the simple, healthy, and delicious recipe!

This was FANTASTIC. As a vegetarian, I didn't use the bacon but added a minced green chili to give it kick. We LOVED IT. I agree with previous reviewers that this can be ruined by overcooking. The veggies should be tender with a slight crunch. I will cook this often! Thanks

This was aweseome!  I was worried it would be bland, but it wasn't!  I didn't have fresh bacon so I cooked in butter and tossed bacon bits on top.  The only way it could have been better was with fresh homegrown corn to go with the zucchini and onion from my garden.

This is AMAZING!  I made this with tacos and my kids had two helpings each!  The sweetness of the corn and zucchini goes really well with the saltiness of the bacon and cheese.  Delicious!!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times and several different ways. You can add anything to this. I have added diced potatoes, eckrich polish/kelbasa sausage (chopped up). I have also made this into a main dish or you can even serve it over mashed potatoes. Wonderful dish and very kid friendly. My kids love it just cause it has bacon and cheese in it. They forget about the veggies.

LOVED this!! Very simple and delicious. The corn and zucchini go very well together. We didnt care so much for the cheese but the bacon added great flavor. I think this is now my new favorite side dish (well one of them ;)

I absolutely hate zucchini and dreaded the idea of having zucchini bread again at another family outing.  I was determined not to eat the stuff once my mom brought me another pound of it to my home.  I checked this website and this recipe appeared.  Oh my goodness!!  Better then great.  I love healthy veggies and this did it.  My three children loved it.  I used frozen corn and it worked just fine.  This recipe will become our way to impress new visitors to our home.  Big thumbs up.

Very tasty recipe. I omitted the cheese, because I forgot to buy any, and it was still amazingly good. I ate the leftovers for my lunch the next day and loved them just as much as when they were fresh-cooked. 2/12/13 update--made it last night with the cheese & it was really yummy. Not more yummy than last time, just still a delicious recipe!

Fantastic recipe, however, I did make a change.  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I used sharp cheddar.  I also used more than a pinch of freshly ground black pepper.  This is a very yummy!!!!

This was great! I had good cheddar at home, so I just grated that and used it. I also bought pepper bacon at the counter instead, and then just didn't add pepper when cooking. Everyone liked it! Thanks!

Tasty way to use up zucchini. Next time I will saute the onions until tender before adding the rest.  I don't care for crunchy onions.  I used extra sharp cheddar since I had no jack cheese and added a pinch of cayenne.  It would be great with red bell pepper.  I will make it again.

4 stars because I change the recipe, but I like the idea of it!  I left out the bacon and onions...just sauteed the zucchini and corn in EVOO and added kosher salt, black pepper and a little butter. It was a hit all around. I will make this again...it's a great way to have zucchini!

This recipe was wonderful if you get excited by the thought of stale bread. It was blah, bland, and tasted exactly like it should when you mix zucchini and corn together. Nothing special. And color wise, it was monotonous. And why use bacon grease?! If I could change anything, it would be DON'T MAKE THIS RECIPE.

This was a big hit at a recent party - the bacon makes for a nice surprise and tends to motivate non-zucchini eaters to try this one - and they all ended up liking it!  Will definitely repeat.

Great way to get rid of that extra zucchini. I used half a can of corn (a whole can looked like a bit much and I don't like corn all that much). The bacon and cheese were a nice touch, I liked it without the cheese as well. Thanks!

This was even better than expected.  The corn adds a nice bit of sweetness.

I thought my sister was bringing me zucchini from her garden, but she brought yellow crookneck instead.  So, that's what I used to make this and it was GREAT!  Contrary to what other reviewers said, this was wonderful the next day (even cold out of the fridge).  You don't want to cook this too long...that might be why others have experienced it getting soggy.  Try adding a little cayenne if you do as I did and use the yellow squash.  It adds a little zing.

This was just what I was looking for - something different for zucchini. My husband said you can't go wrong with bacon and cheese in any dish - he also gave 5 stars. I cooked it a little longer so it would be softer for the kids (3 and 1 year olds also ate it) and used cheddar because that's what I had. Only other change was adding a couple cloves of garlic. Great flavor and quick. A keeper!!

This wasn't a bad recipe, but it's a little different of a combination that I'm used to so I probably won't make it again. But if you're looking for something new to try, try it - you may like it.

Very quick and tasty side dish. I used olive oil rather than bacon fat and also used green onions. I toyed with the idea of ading minced garlic but decided against it, glad I didn't it didn't need it. I will make this again. Thanks.

This was really good; the flavors work really well together.  It's a great way to use up extra zucchini in the summer and fall!  I didn't have corn so I just added an extra cup of chopped zucchini and my husband loved it.  Next time I might reduce the bacon to 3 strips as I thought there was too much.

Absolutely yummy; the slight crunch of the zucchini, the sweetness of the corn, melty cheese (I use mozzarela instead of the jack) and the perfect food--bacon.  Be careful and don't use too much bacon grease, a light touch is best.

I tried this for the first time about six weeks ago and have had it several times since then... always with fresh zucchini and fresh corn off the cob.  I use the leanest bacon I can find.  I also made it recently with pork tenderloin (sliced the tenderloin, pan-fried, revmoed and then made this dish in that pan with no bacon).  HIGHLY recommend it.

Suprised that such a simple recipe was so good.  I used Canadian bacon and olive oil instead of bacon to cut back on fat.  Also used roasted garlic for a more mellow garlic taste.

Terrific!  I am on a diet so I had to modify a bit. I omitted the bacon for a 1/4 tsp ham season soup base and completed forgot about the cheese.  This was so good that I had the leftovers for lunch.

This recipe was very good, although next time I make it I will probably saute the onions for a few minutes to soften before putting in the zucchini and corn, so the latter won't be quite so soft.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  My husband is not crazy about zucchini and he asked for seconds and leftovers to take to work.  I used turkey bacon so I didn't have any dripping to saute my veggies with so added a little olive oil, came out perfect.  Thanks so much!

This is preety good stuff. I had some corn on the cob that had been roasted on the grill, so I cut it off the cob and used it. It came out beautiful. Also very quick and easy. Gotta like that. Thanks.

Pretty good!  I added a little garlic powder.  I am just one of those people that thinks I can't eat vegetables without a little garlic.

This rocks!  I used fresh corn, which is easy to slice off the cob if you stick one end of the ear into the tube of your tube pan - just slice away, and all the kernels fall into the pan!  I sliced my zucchini on a mandoline, into really thin slices, and since I had a handful of fresh snow pea pods, I threw them into the mix, too.  I did try the pre-cooked bacon, and it was much easier and less messy, but it didn't give off much yummy bacon fat so I had to use a little butter.  I would have liked more bacon flavor, but the dish was wonderful, and when I reheated the leftovers in the micro, the squash was not mushy or wet (maybe because it was so thinly sliced?).  Whatever, this recipe is awesome!

I made this dish this weekend, and it was wonderful!!  My boyfriend loved it, and so did I.  It took no time at all to make, and the bacon really makes the veggies taste yummy.  I made it again last night for myself to take to lunch.  Thanks!

This is a nice change of pace from plain corn or zuchini. It turned out nice and my 9 year old ate it,  he complained about it being too spicy, my fault I put more than a pinch of pepper. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great!!  Easy, simple and a great addition to my christmas dinner.  The bacon drippings added a great flavor to the dish.  Next time I'll probably add some spices for more taste.
Thanks Gail!!

Great dish - these are my two most favorite vegetables, cooked in bacon drippings!  I threw away too much of the bacon fat by mistake, but added a little butter, which added nice flavor.  I wouldn't use the fresh corn anymore - it tasted raw.  If I use it again I will cook it longer, or just use canned corn.  THANKS!

I used a green & yellow zucchini as well as some red pepper I wanted to use up. Other than that I cooked as directed. After cooking I felt it needed just a bit of flavour so I sprinkled on some season salt. This was delicious and I could make a meal of just this dish. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Thanks for this recipe! It combines my summer veggie favorites...Corn and Zucchini.  As an added note...I reccomend chopping the back Prior to cooking. Depending on the thickness of the bacon, it can be difficult to chop once cooked. If you can't eat bacon (For some Odd and strange reason...Other than allergies) Use Fried Onions for that Crispy texture and taste.

Had some zucchini from the garden looking for ways to use. Had some left over corn on the cob. Had a few slices of bacon left. Had half a red onion from another recipe. 

This recipe is very forgiving, and can be followed to the letter or modified (improvised!) as you like. I opted for pretty much as is, and it was a bit mild, but good . I strove to get a bit of browning on the zucchini and onions in the saute, then added the corn I'd cut from the cob. Already cooked, it only need a good heat through. 

When I make this again in this straight up version, I might go for a bit more 'carmelizing' of the zukes and onion, maybe even the corn. And there's always the endless modifications with herbs and different cheeses, as well as other veggie add-in like green pepper or tomatoes, to name two... Great 'platform' recipe, or a very decent stand-alone.

I made with what I had....didn't have enough corn, and didn't have the right cheese....but still an awesome meal.  I gave it 4 stars because of my inadequate supplies....but definitely need to put this in my keep file.

It called for 4 pieces of bacon but I used 8.  Wasn't sure if it should have been thick sliced or regular.  Mine was regular with some thin.  I didn't have Monterey Jack so I used mild and sharp cheddar.  I also didn't have fresh corn so I used canned corn with just a little bit of the juice (table spoon maybe).  DELICIOUS!!!!  I might make this at the next big gathering and double or triple it and put the finished into a slow cooker.

Delicious! I used a touch of the bacon drippings and a bit of butter. I also added some cumin and some Cajun seasonings. I omitted the cheese because I felt their were enough flavors going on. I would definitely make this again!

It was a nice variation on calabacitas. But I must point out, it's a "medley", not a "melody". Medley. We enjoyed the recipe, though.

I also added some red bell pepper for color and taste!  This was a great way to get some healthy veggies.  Bacon and cheese!  What can possibly make it better.

This is a good prep-ahead veggie side dish to bring to a potluck.  It needs to be reheated, so definitely undercook the zuchini and stir in frozen corn.  I sauteed one onion and one red pepper in the bacon drippings, but did not include the bacon in the dish for our vegetarian eaters.  I tripled the recipe (12 servings) and used 3 large zuchini, estimating 1 zuchini to give 2 cups chopped.  1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper and yes, SALT.  Put everything into a 9 by 13 baking dish.  I didn't want to chance the "gooey-mess" mentioned by another reviewer and stuck with grating about 4-6 tablespoons of a very hard parmesan on the top of everything and covering with foil to go into the fridge overnight.  Next day, during reheating, we put it into a 350 degree oven, uncovered, for about 30 - 40 minutes.   It had a spicy kick to it, which everyone seemed to love.

Made this  because I had three small zucchini I needed to use up and I also happened to have the other ingredients on hand.  Was a little unsure of how it would turn out but decided I would take the advice of another reviewer and instead of serving this as a side dish, I tossed the mixture in a tortilla.  DELICIOUS as a wrap!!  Healthy and fresh tasting but satisfying as well with a sprinkle of cheese and bacon!! Was so pleased with this recipe.

I've made this a couple time now and man, it's good!  I use frozen corn.  I also tried pre-cooked bacon crumbles that I cooked in the pan to brown and crisp up.  I love cheese but opted to not use it (to save calories/fat) because it was so tasty even without it!  Thanks for the recipe~

So much better than you would imagine. I left out the cheese as many others had suggested - didn't need it. My 4 kids all ate it without complaining! I never would have thought of such a combination. Once I do the prep work I salute it for about 8 minutes before it gets mushy. Thanks!

Made this a week ago and used precooked bacon, it came out pretty good. Made this again with fresh bacon and tasted even better! I think I'll start altering the recipe now and adding things that my friend likes.

I will make it again. I used yellow and green squash and a "fiesta blend" of pre-shredded cheese. I feel like it could have one more ingredient but I can't think of what it should be. I will definitely keep this recipe and play around with it!

I've made this for Christmas dinner the past two years and both years it has surprised me with how good it is! I just make it as a simple side dish and don't think much of it, but then I take a bite and YUM! Definitely add more bacon than what the recipe call forâ€¦ because, let's be honest, everything needs more bacon.

This is a great recipe! I add squash & a fresh spicy pepper I grow in my garden to give it a little extra zip. I can't get enough of this, it's so good I make extra so there are leftovers to warm up the next day.

I used fresh zucchini, frozen roasted corn, prepared real bacon bits and low fat shredded mexican style cheese. I forgot the onions. It was very delicious! I will make it again.

I absolutely love this recipe, and it is perfect exactly as written. It's best to make in August when I can use zucchini and corn fresh from the farmer's market, but it's great anytime of year.

I substituted cream corn for the fresh corn.  It did not look as nice, but the cheese melting in with it made it very decadent.  I also added herbes de provence.  It was really tasty!

This was great! So simple to make, and even my husband who doesn't like veggies didn't mind it, I'm sure it had something to do w/the bacon and cheese.  I used frozen corn and fresh zucchini and it was fine.

This recipe turned out fantastic.  I used frozen zucchini and onions, and canned corn, because that was all I had.  Let me tell you that I HATE canned corn.  In this recipe? It is soooo good.  I added some lemon pepper and dill, and didn't use any bacon grease.  Also I had frozen shredded parmesan cheese that I used instead of MJ.  So easy and delicious.

I made this for the first time ever tonight, and it was just wonderful! My husband raved and raved, and my son had seconds.  Loved the differnet use for abundant zucchini!  Very quick and easy prep with ingredients that I almost always have on hand. The only change we felt it needed was to add some sea salt, which enhanced the flavors to our liking perfectly.

This was a great dish, but I've been told "anything with fried bacon is wonderful", lol. All kidding aside, this is a fast, easy and super delicious dish. Have it on my standby list for when I can't think of anything else. Never have any leftovers either!

Delicious! I only had real bacon bits so I sauteed the vegetables in a little oil and a pat of butter. After they were cooked I added some diced ham that I sauteed in a separate pan and the real bacon bits. I only used a little shredded cheese though. This made a quick, easy and flavorful meal!

I loosely followed this recipe.  I used fresh Zucchini and about a tablespoon of butter and fried up the zucchini.  I like my zucchini a little mushy so i did over cook it a little.  then i added frozen corn and bacon that i cooked in the microwave.  it turned out really well!  i would definitely recommend this recipe.

This was my first-ever recipe cooking zucchini. I make this a lot and it always turns out strong. I usually use frozen corn (fire-roasted corn from Trader Joes), mix in some yellow squash and hold the cheese. Be careful not to overcook. Its perfect when the squash is al dente! And the bacon brings it to another level.

My husband and I loved this. I have made it a few times now and varied it each time, adding diced tomatoes or pinto beans instead of bacon. I always add a handful of cilantro because it compliments the flavors so well.

One of my new favorite recipes.  I love zucchini, and my kids love corn, and we all enjoyed this tonight.  The bacon adds a salty, smokey flavor.  I did not add the cheese at the end.  I did add some salt, pepper and garlic salt to the veggies. I also used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash because I had both.  Delish!!!  Love this one!

One of the best vegetable side dishes I have made!  Bacon makes vegetables better.  I used frozen corn.  The only thing else I have to add is that I don't think the cheese is necessary.  We had the leftovers the next day, I forgot to sprinkle the cheese on, and we didn't even miss it!

Love this....can use frozen or canned corn. Cheese and bacon optional, altho it is good to saute the onion in the bacon grease. I always toss in a handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley and/or basil leaves. Don't overcook the zucchini, and leftovers, if any, can be gently heated. However, leftovers are rare!!

I relied on the positive reviews and gave this recipe a try.  I was not disappointed!  It was a nice mixture of flavors and my family loved it!  I used turkey bacon which didn't create adequate drippings, so I added a little olive oil to the pan as the bacon cooked.  Frozen sweet corn worked fine as an alternative to fresh.

pretty tasty recipe .. I used 3 slices of bacon and cut with scissors - fried in a cast iron skillet then removed. Added some minced garlic and bellpepper to the onions and sauted until tender before adding 1 can of drained Fiesta Corn (with peppers) and 3 sliced zuchnni (which was more than 2 cups -probably almost double) --stir fried until cooked but still somewhat crisp -turned off and folded in 1/4 cup of 2% Mexican Cheese and bacon pieces --needs a little salt.

Good recipe, even the kids went back for seconds. I added some chopped garlic, used minced onion and a can of corn since those are what I had on hand.  I drained the bacon grease and used the corn juice to cook the zucchini. Will make again.

Good recipe! My husband who hates zucchini ate this and even said i could make it again. Instead of using the bacon drippings to saute the veggies I used EVOO and it came out great! I also added some minced garlic to the skillet. It is good with or without the cheese.

Very tasty - we used cheddar cheese and it was really good. I would probably try a milder cheese next time. It does cool down quickly so serve immediately.

This is a great way to make good use of the summer vegetables grown in your garden!  Sometimes I also add chopped green beans and grated carrots into the mix.  You can pretty much put in any veggies you have on hand and it'll turn out nicely.

A little bland but a good base flavor. Will experiment next time with some other spices to see what may work. Good beginner though.

Great taste and a good way to get your veggies - can even skip the cheese and cut back on the fats/butter...

I enjoyed this recipe, i can never follow a recipe exactly, i always feel like i have to add something.    I added 3/4 cp Hungarian Wax Peppers Colby Jack Cheese instead of Mont Jack And sprinkled it with Curry Powder and Garlic Powder for an extra kick.    Was very very well received even those who don't usually eat veggies.  Will keep this one

This was great!  both my kids liked it! I substituted the bacon with butter and topped the meal with a smoked cheese so it still had a smokey/bacon flavor. I threw in  can of chickpeas to make a vegetarian dinner!  I served it with whole grain flat bread and tortillas and the kids had a blast scooping it instead of having to use a fork!  I'll surely  make it again!

My children, who don't like onions and are not fond of zucchini, love this dish.  I made a double recipe for two adults and two teen boys and there were no leftovers.  I chopped the bacon before cooking but otherwise followed teh recipe and it was fabulous.

This recipe is a hit at my house! To save time, I use a can of whole kernel corn, drained. We also love using the leftovers for filling in quesadillas later in the week.

So easy, and used fresh zucchini from my aunt's garden (and canned corn).  My family loved this side dish (but snickered about the name).  My onion was a bit bigger than "small" so we had a bit excess onion - next time if I can't find a small one, I'll use half a medium instead of all of a medium!  But it was a great way to enjoy the vegetables of summer!

I made this recipe with a variety of summer squash from my garden and my family loves it. But of course anything cooked in bacon grease is always delicious. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this one again and again.

This was delicious.  It's a nice, easy to make veggie side.  For the cheese, I sprinkled just a little parmesan at the end.

More like 3.5 stars but I'll give it 4 because it seemed to go down well with my guests.  This was just okay, nothing spectaular.  Followed the recipe exactly - didn't have a problem with soggy veg at all.  Not sure I'd make again though.

This is fantastic. My husband usually hates zucchini but he asked for seconds! I used turkey bacon (cooked in the microwave)and lots of pepper. I added some minced garlic as well and used frozen corn. Absolutely delicious.

this recipe was really good. i followed it almost exactly as it is. i used a red onion, which i thought went well with the bacon and zucchini. to make it part of my main dish, i served it over cheese raviolis, and then topped it with grated parmesan.

I made this for the first time on Christmas day.  I doubled the recipe to serve ten.  The only change I made was to add salt.

It was a huge hit!  I barely had any leftovers.  Even the picky ones ate some.

I will make this recipe again, for sure.  I like the idea of adding tomatoes, and garlic, or adding Italian or Mexican seasonings to accompany those kinds of entrees.

This is pretty good, though I used turkey bacon instead.  Not the best idea, since there was very little oil left over afterward - adding a pat of butter and/or salt to saute everything else might have helped.  I added some garlic and oregano to this recipe.  It might have also benefited from some diced tomato.

really good, with limited cheese, lots of ground pepper and fresh veggies. My son, who is not a big veggie fan, ate a plate full before dinner. I did not have bacon on hand so I did not use it, but it would be a meal with it, and a tasty sidedish without. The real key to this is to use fresh corn off the cob.

A neighbor gave me a bunch of zucchini on a night when I had planned Mexican, so I modified this somewhat to fit our menu.  Boy, was it delicious--everyone went back for seconds, which never happens with veggies.  I just added a small can of diced green chilies, a drained can of pinto beans, and a few shakes of chili powder.  This was very easy to prepare and couldn't have been more tasty, will definitely make this again and again.

Easy and delicious!!  Fresh corn makes all the difference I'm afraid!  It was great prepared exactly as the recipe shows, but for kicks, I cooked up some spinach & mozzarella raviolis and then topped with spaghetti sauce and the corn & zucchini medley, bacon, and cheese.  It was delicious and a little more filling!  This will definitely be a repeat recipe!

AWESOME!  The veggies were so tender without being overcooked and mushy.  Sauteeing them in the bacon grease also added a ton of flavor.  Will definitely be making again.

This is delicious!  I added some additional salt and probably more than a "pinch" of pepper.  B/c of a dairy allergy I left out the cheese, but frankly I don't think it needed it!  We will definitely make this again! :-)

Yummmy!  I have a hard time finding veggie dish recipes I like (I'm a meat and potatoes girl) but this one was wonderful!  The veggies ended up with a more sauteed texture than crisp, but they were great.  I used pepper jack cheese and added a bit of finely diced red pepper.  I did cook the onion a bit longer to make it soft and added a bit of italian dressing as others suggested.  This will be a regular use of the abundant zucchini from our family garden this year!

I enjoyed this dish. The bacon definitely makes it.  I added a bit of italian dressing on the advice of a previous review and liked it.  We didn't use any cheese and the only corn I had on hand was canned.  But it went well with our salmon and rice.

I made this as a side dish for our New York Strips this weekend for fathers day and everyone *LOVED* it! It was so easy and chessy and super delicious!!! My little tweek was using canned fiesta corn which includes red and green peppers. I will make this dish forever. Thank you!

This recipe received rave reviews from my family. Will definitely make it into the regular routine in the summer. I used the ready bacon that is almost cooked when you get it. I would recommend if using that to wait until it is on the plate to add the bacon. My bacon got a little mushy as a result of leaving it in the pan too long.

This is a different and VERY tasty way to prepare zucchini!  The only alterations I made were to add a couple extra strips of bacon, and I used a can of corn b/c I didn't have fresh.  Everyone gobbled it up!

It was a pretty darn good side dish and fairly easy to prepare. It didn't quite "wow" so I gave it 4 stars, but its definitely solid and I'll probably use the combination again. I only used 2 slices of bacon (ours were pretty thick,) and just a smattering of cheese.

What an easy delicious meal! Made exactly as recipe said except I sprinkled with havarti cheese and then rolled in whole-wheat wraps. Yummy!

Good base recipe.  I added some orange bell pepper to the veggie mix for color, a little minced garlic, and used cheddar jack instead of plain jack cheese.  Very flavorful.  Using fresh veggies for this one is must to have the right texture.

This is the best recipe for a zucchini side dish and I've been looking a long time. I did not change anything in the recipe and it turned out great! I highly recommend using fresh corn right off the cob for this one. Thanks for the great recipe!

Really liked it, maybe because we used fresh vegetables... it came out great. We added more spice to it by using a little bit of chile pepper and a 1/4 tsp of red pepper.

FABULOUS- like many reviewers, this side was better than the main dish.  I used canned corn and colby cheese, but other than that went by the book.  Thanks- a way to actually get my husband to eat vegetables!

This is really, really good.   Made it on the grill in a cast iron skillet while cooking chicken/sausage.  We decided it actually didn't need the cheese, it was perfect without it ... will be making again and again ... definite keeper!

I really enjoyed this simple dish.  It's not exciting and doesn't offer much in the way of complex flavors but it's easy to make and tastes good, which sometimes is all you need.  Makes a great side for a chicken dish.

This was just what I was looking for! Simply delicious! The bacon taste really makes the fresh veggies pop.  I've made this twice in the last week.  Second time I left out the cheese and liked it just as well.

This was so easy and so good!  The only change that I made was that I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the Monteray, because that was all that I had in the house!  Awesome recipe, my kids, 4 & 2 loved it also!!!  Next time i will add more bacon, because we love it so much, hahah!!!

This one was blah. It tasted bland, and was definitely not worth the effort. I think the recipe calls for too much corn. The sweetness of the corn overpowered the bacon and cheese flavors. It would have been much easier to crack open a can of corn!

This wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either.  Probably won't make again because there are so many other recipes for zucchini that we like better.  Sorry.

Very good. I used turkey bacon and left out the cheese. I also added a few canned diced tomatoes.

Substituted cube steak for bacon. Added Â½ red pepper, 1 leek, and Â¼ t cayenne pepper. Used Co-jack cheese. Batch for four served 2 people for dinner. Almost enough, . . . if only it were not so tasty.

i forgot the cheese at the end, but it was delicious anyway!!! very easy and very tasty. I will advise if you buy thick cut bacon like I do that you only need 2 strips instead of 4. plan to make this as a side dish often!!

This was excellent and very easy to make.  I used my homegrown sweet corn that I had frozen last year, and it was great, so I can imagine how wonderful it would be with fresh corn!

This recipe was a disappointment for me.  Since all of the ingredients are some of my very favorite foods, I expected something spectacular, especially considering the great reviews.  I actually didn't like it at all.  My husband, who wasn't thrilled about trying it, actually liked it pretty well.  I doubt I would make it again unless I substituted some other vegetables--maybe potatoes instead of the corn.

This is soo good.  Everyone loved this dish, even my husband who does not like corn nor zucchini!  I will make this again and again.
I added a little bit more bacon, and a bit extra spice.

It was good, not wonderful, but good.  Definitely dresses up regular old corn.  Both husband and I thought that lots of salsa improved it greatly, and we think that it needs twice as much bacon and a dash of salt.  As we ate, I kept thinking of ways to dress it up...Southwestern kept coming to mind:  hot peppers would be good in this and it would be good in a tortilla or wrap with some doctoring.

This is wonderful!!  I didn't have any bacon, so I used olive oil, added a little garlic salt, cilantro and marjoram (about 1/2 tsp each) and we all loved it!!  Even my 2 year old grandson.  Will definitely be making this all summer!!!  Thanks Gail!!

Overall, a tasty recipe, even if it seems like an odd combo for me.  I substituted 1 tbs olive oil for the bacon, since my bacon was precooked.  Mom found it "weird- not bad, but weird" and my twin inhaled it. Dad ate a little, as he's not an onion fan. Very tasty side.  Also, makes 5 BIG portions- be sure to use a large skillet.

I had my doubts at first because I didn't think that type of cheese would taste good with zuchinni, but I was wrong! The whole dish was delicious and I ate more of that then the main dish I had prepared!! I'll definitely be making that again.

WE really loved this one. I sauteed the onions and a clove of garlic in olive oil first for about five minutes, the added the rest of the veggies. I like corn and zucchini crisp tender like the other reviewer. I then sauteed this for a few minutes only. Anyway you cook this up I'll bet it is double delicious. My girl is a vegeterian and she wants it a lot. Thanks for a great zucchini side dish.

This was so good!  The only changes I made were canned corn, turkey bacon, and a mexican cheese blend.  My husband agreed with the many other men who said that this was yummy!  I will make this often!  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Yummy.....I used 2 pretty big zucchini, a frozen bag of white corn, 1 med. onion, 1/2 lb. of cooked crumbled bacon and montery jack cheese. Excellent...very rich and high calorie...but worth it. The taste was great...easy to make and plenty of it.

Soooo good! I have twin toddlers who are boycotting vegetables, and they even ate this! My husband couldn't stop eating it. Thanks!

This was very easy and very good.  The kids loved it.  My 11 year old pretty much done it her self, except for cooking the bacon.

I've made this side dish a couple times and my whole family enjoyed it.  I add more cheese and bacon, so how could I not love it?  Stick with the jack cheese in this recipe- I accidentally used mozzarella once and it was not as good.  We'll make this one again- a great summertime side dish.

Made this last summer and we loved it.  Sort of forgot about it over the winter, but was pulling out my zucchini recipes for the season, and came across this one.  Made it again, and it's better than ever!  Can't wait until my corn comes from the garden also!  We can eat this as a meal, but it's great as a side dish also.

Very tasty combination.  Great way to jazz up a veggie side dish.  My husband loved it.  My only suggestion is to follow directions.  The first time I made it, I sprinkled the cheese while it was still in the pan and I came up with a gooey mess.  Tasty but messy.  Thanks Gail

This makes a perfect sidedish for just about any meat you can toss on the grill.  I made it all summer and never got tired of it.
