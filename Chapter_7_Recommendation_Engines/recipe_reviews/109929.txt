I made one alteration to this recipe, accounting for personal taste.  No one in my family is fond of liver, chicken or otherwise, so I used crispy bacon instead.  I also recommend saute-ing the spaetzle in smaller batches.

We swapped out the livers for bacon also. Managed to cut out the last stick of butter by serving the breasts on a plate with scoops of sauce over them and just tossing the spaetzle in the rest of the sauce. There was no talking when we ate - just lots of yummy sounds!
