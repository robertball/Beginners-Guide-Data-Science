This was a big hit at a recent family gathering.  I will definitely be using this recipe again. Be sure to bake the wontons long enough.  I think I had to bake them 6-7 minutes.  You want them crispy.  YUM!

My whole family really enjoyed this dip! I've now used the cream cheese mixture in several other recipes with great results!

This is the first time I really couldn't eat some kind of dip. I'll dip just about anything. I even followed the recommendations for modification and it still just tasted like soy sauce flavored cream cheese. The toasted wontons were good, though!

I agree with other reviewers saying there is too much crab...other than that we really liked.  Thanks for the post.

Hmmm ... these were easy to make and fun too.  Based on other's reviews, I cut the crab in half and was glad.  I also omitted the ginger root as I forgot to pick it up at the store ... missed it a little but not tons.  These weren't as creamy as I'd hoped ... wonder what would happen if you added more cream cheese??

Not super impressed with the idea of this dip being cold.  It wasn't bad, but I think I will use it for the filling in homemade crab rangoon!

I don't know what everyone else is talking about. I made this recipe exactly as the recipe called for. I made no modifications, and it was wonderful. If you ask me, it tasted exactly like crab rangoon filling. I took it to an asian inspired party and everyone LOVED it. I think the people who reviewed it and didn't like it, made too many changes to the original recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe, but I have ALWYAS served it HOT, never cold.  Hah!  I just realized that I mis-read the original recipe, but for those of you who had it cold I would strongly urge you to give it one more shot but try baking it until it's hot and bubbly.  Cold just sounds nasty.  In addition, I used low-fat cream cheese, and instead of duck sauce my friends and I all liked it with hot chile sauce (sambal olek or some other Thai-style hot red sauce).  I also added some thinly sliced scallions or green onions for a little extra zip and crunch.  I get requests for 'my' recipe all the time.

I liked it pretty well. Not my idea of rangoon really but I thought it was good. My family however, did not. That being said, I won't be making it again. :(  Good recipe though. Just can't justify making it if I'm the only one going to eat it.

I just made this for a party and it was a hit!  I did make a few modifications though: 1) I added about 1/2 a cup of shredded mozzarella to the cheese mixture.  2)I used imitation crab meat and decreased the amount to about 8oz. 3)I substituted home-made sweet and sour sauce for the duck sauce. 4) I topped it with sliced almonds before baking and green onions after.

This recipe was very disappointing.  There is WAY too much soy sauce, which overpowered everything else.  Will not be making this again.  Even cutting back on the soy sauce, it still wouldn't taste like a crab rangoon.  Simply awful.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Too much soy sauce, not very eye appealing, the paprika was too bitter. I would never make it again.

I read all of the reviews prior to making this and decided to cut the crab in half and I'm glad I did. I too used imitation crab due to availability in my area. I'm not sure how others felt the soy overpowered because I ended up adding even more after tasting it. This is good but I think it might be better warm as another suggested. The wonton chips were a nice touch and also fun to make.  This is one I will make again and I am anxious to try it warm next time.

It was quick and easy, but I didn't like the results. It wasn't creamy at all! I am going to try again and AT LEAST double the cream cheese. I used minced garlic and minced ginger root from a jar as well as imitation crab meat, which seemed ok. Definitely needs some green onions. I served Duck Sauce on the side and just used tortilla chips (couldn't find any wontons around here!) I'll give it another shot!

I have to say I loved this dip as well as all my guests...BUT I didn't really think it tasted like crab rangoon.  Either way it's a new 'Go-To' recipe for me.

I didn't really like this. I'm giving it 3 stars because the duck sauce that I bought was too peachy and I think that's mostly what ruined the flavor.

This spread definatly grew on us.  We thought it was just OK on the first day, but after 2 or 3 days it was much more interesting.

I used this recipe as a guideline and made adjustments.  I only used 1 tbsp of soya sauce, I used green onions instead of parsley. I used 2 cans of crabmeat and still found it was creamy.  I didn't use the paprika and I brushed oil on the wonton wrappers and I found I had to flip them after 5 minutes and bake for an additional 2-3 minutes.  I also used Thai Chili sauce in place of the duck and heated the dip for 10-15 minutes in the oven.  Everyone raved about the dip.

I would cut back on the amount of the crab meat the next time I make it. I crab over powered the cream cheese and you didn't notice that it was even there. I also left off the sauce over everything. It wasn't missed.

I decreased the soy sauce to 1 T and substituted chopped green onion for the dried parsley. I also added a few shakes of sriracha sauce and 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Instead of fresh crabmeat, I substituted a 12 oz can of white crabmeat. Everyone loved this recipe!

I misread the ingredients and only used 2 tsp of soy sauce. It didn't really taste like crab rangoon,but it was tasty. I would have liked it creamier, so I think I'll add sour cream next time, and I like someone else's idea to use scallions and Thai chili sauce. I'll try that too next time. I didn't use duck sauce or paprika, which seems like the biggest complaints in the other reviews, and I served with club crackers.  Yum!
