Excellent. I made a small batch of it with all yellow cherry tomatoes since I didn't have enough room in my blender to add the red. I was happy with the taste without the red. Also had a yellow pepper instead of the orange and a nectarine in lieu of a peach. Otherwise, everything as written. I will make this over and over again, very refreshing and I just finished making it -it's in the fridge to only get better. (Another nice thing about this is there will be a SF Giants game on later.)Thanks, Chef John!  **Now the day after and it's more mellow - pure heaven.
