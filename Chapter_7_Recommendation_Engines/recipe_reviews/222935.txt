I'm allergic to onions so I substituted a chunk of a green apple for the onion and I mixed 1/2 cup of water with the same amount of beer for steaming.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My family all loved it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of my substitutions - I didn't feel it was fair for me to rate the recipe based on my substitutions, but we all thought it was delicious.  We have no small children - the youngest at home is almost 21, so everyone eating this were all adults.  I'll make it again but next time I'm going to use half a peach in the neck and use all water.  For my oven 90 minutes was long enough to cook the chicken.

We've made this type of chicken before, just never with lime and rosemary.  My family loved this chicken.  I made it as written; only we grilled it instead of putting it in the oven.  It took about 1 1/2 hours at medium temp to cook on the grill.  The chicken was very moist with a faint hint of lime.  I served this with 'Summertime Tomato Salad' and 'Hot Ponderosas!' both AR recipes.  Dinner was enjoyed by all.

We love beer can chicken and this was no exception.  The lime added a nice touch.  I didn't have a red onion so I used a small red potato in the neck cavity and pulled the skin over it to close it up.  The potato was as tasty as the chicken.

This recipe is absolutely perfect! I skipped the rosemary because I don't care for it, but otherwise prepared the recipe exactly as described. I have a beer can rack for grilling that I picked up at Big Lots years ago so it holds the chicken nice and steady. Rubbed garlic in the cavity, stuffed an onion in the neck, rubbed salt and pepper and squeezed some lime on the outside skin and I was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. A 5 lb chicken took about 1 hr 20 minutes in a 340 degree convection oven (but honestly my convection oven does not seem to cook THAT much faster)-what a wonderful inside grilling method. Definitely will be a repeat at my house!
