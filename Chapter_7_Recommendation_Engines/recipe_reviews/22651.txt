This recipe is awesome . . . I have substituted imitation crab meat for the shrimp, which tastes wonderful, too.  It's a favorite at our home for SaturdaySunday afternoon get-togethers, holidays, etc.  Thanks for sharing!

This actually tasted a little sweet, I guess because of the cocktail sauce.  I'd suggest adding some horseradish to the cocktail sauce to give it more of a kick.  I think it would be better without the mozzarella, which just took away from the taste of the shrimp.  There are so many appetizer recipes with cheese that I'd just prefer that you tasted the shrimp more.

I took this appetizer to a Christmas Party last night.  Not only did it look festive, with the green onions and red tomatoes, it was delicious! Two other people asked me for the recipe!

A great change of pace from layerd bean dips! Very good. I don't think it really needs the tomato though, it just seems to make it wet. If you think it needs some color, maybe chopped red or yellow bell pepper would be an idea. I actually think I like it best with just the cream cheese, cocktail sauce and shrimp.

Made this recipe this weekend for a football tailgate.  I did change it up a bit, using sour cream in the base along with the cream cheese to make it more "dip" friendly.  I used the frozen shrimp as suggested and also removed the tomatoes and the mozz. cheese from the dip.  It was great!  I would make it again.  A word to the wise, my wife thought thre was too much cocktail sauce so perhaps cutting back would be a good suggestion.  Wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

Definately a keeper, however found the frozen baby shrimp to be tastier for this recipe instead of the canned.  (Less of a fishy taste).  Very good though!

I made this for Christmas Day, and we really enjoyed it!  I just did the cream cheese mix, cocktail sauce, and frozen, small shrimp and left off the green onions, tomato, and shredded cheese, and I am glad I did, b/c I liked how it came out just fine.  I think if I had added those other things, you wouldn't be able to get the shrimp flavor as much.  Will make again!

This was a big hit on our Christmas Eve appetizer buffet.  I left out the green onions as a personal preference and used a shredded cheddar mix instead of mozzarella because that is what I had on hand and also added chopped crab meat.  Served with Ritz.

I only gave 3 stars because there is so much missing from this recipe. As is- it's like what you would find on the back of the cream cheese box, simple & easy but, if you want to make it special with some depth, taste & color you need to add much more like others have stated.
this is what I did:
less cocktail sauce (or it's to sweet)
to taste horseradish
imatation crab meat
chopped pimentos
dash of white pepper
a bit of chopped fresh parsley
and you HAVE to add sour cream or your have this really thick cream cheese mess that hard to serve. Then your have a nice appi to serve with crackers and fresh veggies

I made this for our family Christmas party and it was a huge hit. I did omit the tomato like some others suggested because of the cocktail sauce. I definitely think I will be making this again.

This tasted good but was just weird. People liked it once they tried it but the cream cheese and shrimp mixture turned people off.  Maybe you shouldn't tell people whats in it so they aren't turned off by it.

I mixed the shrimp in with the cream cheese mixture, didn't put tomatoes or cheese on top.
Everyone loved it.  I did use full size shrimp cut into smaller pieces.  Served with crackers.

I make a similar recipe but you mix it all together except cocktail sauce ( no tomato) into a ball.  Pour cocktail sauce over it. I use frozen salad shrimp thawed a pound of it. Serve with a knife and crackers add more cocktail sauce as needed. Really yummy.
