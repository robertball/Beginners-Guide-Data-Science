This recipe was a hit at a recent holiday party, but I made a few changes. First, I used corn flakes. They look a lot more like leaves than rice krispies do. Second, I didn't use frosting. I put the food coloring directly into the marshmallow mixture. It took a bit more color, but the results looked much better than icing. I also added a drop or two of red to get the green to darken properly.
