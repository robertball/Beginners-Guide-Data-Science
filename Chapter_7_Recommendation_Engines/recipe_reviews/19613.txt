Deeelish! My family and I love this, and guests
"wow!" at it, too! I tweak it a little: just 1 cup vegetable oil plus 1 cup good olive oil, and then cut the white wine vinegar to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup red vine vinegar. This will become your exclusive steak marinade!

This is the GREATEST beef marinade.  I used it for a london broil cut and I marinated for 8 hours,  not three days and it was still delcious.  This receipe make a lot of marinade so I would cut the recipe in half for shish kabob pieces.  Thanks!

This is the best beef marinade we have ever run across.  We add 3 - 4 cloves of minced garlic, either fresh or store bought in a jar, and marinate tri-tip in a gallon Zip-Lock for the three days.  It's fantastic every time and every one who tries it has to have a copy of the recipe!  Enjoy!!

This was by far the best marinade I have ever had on a steak.  Very tender, very flavorful.  But I can see why some people just didn't like it.  I think it's a love it or hate it dish.  The only thing I changed was I used red wine vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. of cloves.  A must try!! We grilled it on our george foreman grill.  A keeper!!

This marinade is "delish".  I have tried it on several different cuts of meat and we love it.  I don't like the flavor of the soy sauce too much so I tend to add only a tablespoon of that and then about a tablespoon or two of seasoned salt to the mixture.  Also for those that use this on a grill, I have also added smoke flavoring to the mixture, and YUMMY!!

My husband loved this marinade..I thought the flavor was pretty good, but I was most impressed with how tender it made the meat.  We had a very tough cut of beef and after 2 days in this marinade it was wonderful.

Followed recipe except used a little less clove.  Marinated London broil almost 4 days, meat wasn't close to tender and the clove taste was gross.  Everyone else said kabobs had a good flavor, but I think they didn't want to hurt my feelings.  This was pretty disappointing.

This was absolutely fantastic. The meat had such a nice tangy flavor, the kids loved it too. Used it on a cheap roast and cut for shish kabobs. Oh and cut back to 1 tsp of cloves.Very juicy and tender

My husband drools over this marinade.  It is so fragrant with the just the right spiciness.  It works well with pork, too.

THIS IS THE BEST MARINADE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!
I grilled shish kabobs with it (I had never made them before, plus I used mesquite charcoal) and my husband flipped.  HE LOVED THEM.  I am on the low carb diet so  I just had the meat and I LOVED IT TOO!!!  I didnt have the clove so I added 1 1/2 T pureed garlic (available in a jar in the produce dept) and I only marinated it for 1 hour) Even so, It was fabulous.

A wonderful marinade.  I added garlic and cut back on the cloves and it was great.  We used it to marinade our shish kabob meat for 3 days prior and the meat was very tender. Highly recommend this recipe to everyone.

My husband and I found this recipe this morning, so we didn't marinate for 3 days, just 3 hours.  We used it with a chuck roast and can't believe how AMAZING it is!  We did make a couple of substitutions to avoid going to the store!  We didn't use gr. mustard or the cloves, but did add 1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic.  A MUST for every roast!  My husband is ready to throw away all of our 'jarred' marinate and stock up on these ingredients!  Thank you so much for sharing!!

I swear to you, this is the best steak marinade I have ever had. I made this and poured it over four 8oz filet mignon steaks. I let them marinade for 3 days and grilled them just right. I can't imagine how it could be any better. I love it as is. Don't change a thing!! Thanks!!!

Horrible! Nasty! What was I thinking??!! Cloves?
If I could give it less than a single star I would..no offense Debi. The clove taste was WAY too overpowering. You gotta like cloves A LOT to use this recipe. What a waste of good meat.

I've made this twice now & this is the best marinade I've ever used.  I admit, I did use it as a base and I changed a few things.  For our tastes, I use garlic (minced & sliced) instead of cloves, 1/2c olive oil & 1c vegetable oil, red pepper flakes & after the first time I made it, I now omit the salt.  I also forgot the vinegar the first time, too, and it was still good.  We've used it on kebabs, it is so tasty.  My husband loves it!

This was fantastic and a big hit at a big bbq that I hosted.  I used it on thick pork ribs, and everyone loved it!  I did not add the cloves as that was not the flavor I was looking for.  I marinated the ribs for 24 hours and the meat was totally tender.  Delicious!

Love this marinade!!!! I also cut down on the  soy sauce as I am not a fan of it. I halfed the marinade recipe and only used 1 TBS soy sauce. I also used Balsamic Vinegar instead, let it sit for three days and broiled them. I had a left over piece the next day, and it tasted even better the second time around! Great recipe Debi!!! Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a gathering and it was very disappointing.  The kabobs were salty, but worse of all; there was this totally gross clove taste.   I caught one of my guests running their meat under water just so they could eat it!  With some adjusting, I think it can be a good marinade, so I am going to give it 2 stars.  As is though, I would definitely not recommend.

Excellent!! I halved the recipe and marinated a london broil for 24 hours. I then grilled the meat. What a great flavor. I find that london broil can be kind of a tough cut of meat....but this was so tender and juicy. I was shocked how tender this was. I thought that half of the recipe made plenty of marinade for the london broil and I brought the rest up to a boil on the stove and used that as a sauce for the cooked meat. Will make again very soon!

I gave this 3 stars, because it wasn't awful, but my husband did ask me to delete it from my recipe box ;-( Based on the great reviews, I was pretty excited to make this, and it just didn't live up. I left out the cloves, not sorry I did. The oil flavor was too strong (and they were greasy). I marinated for just over 24 hours, and the meat had an odd texture. I also left out the lemon juice, and it wasn't missed at all. Just not sure what everybody else sees in this recipe. We usually use the 'Kabobs' recipe, which is a teriyaki marinade, and it is REALLY awsome. Maybe that's just the flavor that we prefer. I think we'll stick with that recipe from now on - I feel like we wasted good beef on this one.

An excellent marinade recipe.
According to my opinion it doesn't take three days to ripen.

Really easy recipe.  I used it to marinade beef for kabobs.  I will leave out the cloves next time, my kids kept trying to wipe the taste off thier tongues!  Other than that, the flavor was great!  Thanks!

Very good, it gave the meat a ton of flavor. Maybe cut down on the soy sauce a little for a little less salty taste. Otherwise, very good.

I had high hopes for this marinade after reading the reviews. But my high hopes turned into disappointment when I actually tasted it. It was too salty, too greasy and a pain to grill because of the flare-ups from all the oil. Not taking the saltiness in to consideration, the flavor was just bad. I'll keep looking for a good marinade.

Absolutely Delicious!!! Made this for kabobs and it was great - everyone raved about it! I used top sirloin beef and marinated it for 2 days (I wouldn't recommend anything less). Next time I'll try 3 days. GREAT!!!!

My boyfriend was out of the country for a couple of weeks and hadn't had any beef while he was away.  So I purchased a couple of steaks and used this marinade over night.  These were the best steaks I had ever cooked.  They were so tasty and tender!

Way to salty even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce. Reduced the clove amount after reading the reviews but it still didn't do it for us. Also, added fresh minced garlic.

I like my meat to taste like meat, but this marinade added just the right amount of flavor without over powering the meat.  I marinated london broil over night and when I grilled it, it came out tender and juicy even at medium-well.  I will use this again when grilling!  YUMMY!

Wow!  This was a big hit at my dinner party!  I added about a half a clove of garlic for a little extra kick.  It smelled like a chinese restaurant outside our house!  The neighbors even came over to ask what we were cooking!  Great Recipe..will use again! :)

Very good flavor, but I don't think the added salt is necessary, since soy sauce is salty enough by itself. Garlic works really well with this too.

I tried it with red wine vinegar and didn't have much luck.  It was not very good. The meat tasted like a beef jerky. If I ever try it with white wine vinegar, I would also cut back on the cloves.

This is the BEST marinade we have ever had!  Easy and quick, ingredients are common.  We used it for shish-kabobs. 9 yr old loved it and so did my husband.  All I heard was "Man, this is tasty!" all the way thru dinner! We marinated for 2 days in a ziplock bag. Definately a keeper!

This is my first comment on here and I've been on here for a couple of years!  This recipe is so worthy of writing up and sharing!  It's amazing!  I usually marinade a flank steak for 12 hours in this delicious mixture and put it on the grill!  It is so hummy!  I'm always asked for this recipe everytime I make it!  Thank you so much for making our life a little more enjoyable with this recipe!  It's worth 10 stars!

Went out an a limb and used this as a marinade for 15 pounds of cubed bottom sirloin for a block party we hosted...it was a huge success. I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the cloves and parsley and added a teaspoon of garlic powder. Phenominal. The meat was incredibly tender...no one even needed a knife to cut it. And the flavor was exactly what I had been hoping for. This is now my ONLY beef marinade (even marinated a couple of boneless strips in it for an hour for supper tonight). Can't be beat.

I marinated a roast I was smoking and was it delicious.  It only marinated about 6 hours but that was fine.  Really flavorful without overpowering the meat.

This did not suit our taste at all.  I will not try again but I would suggest to leave out the cloves and salt, maybe add a tablespoon of brown sugar or molasses.  If using for grilled meat I would add a little liquid smoke.

I tried it because it looked easy.  First, I thought previous reviews are a little too exaggerated, but OH MY GOODNESS!!  This IS THE BEST marinade I ever had.  And surprisingly, this goes well with any types of food.  I served it along with Greek food, but this fit right in.

All eleven of us loved this marinade.  The beef was so tender, we didn't need knives.  The flavor was pleasing and not overwhelming.

Simply outstanding!  I scaled the recipe back as we used it on a smaller roast (only had about 7 hours to marinade).  I also cut back on the cloves after reading some reviews, and also knowing how strong of a flavour cloves tend to lend.  I am glad I did this...the flavour was certainly noticeable enough, but in a GREAT way.  We loved this marinade (I used a heaping teaspoon of the cloves based on half the recipe) and also added a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic!  SO YUMMY!  Will make this one again, and soon!

Over-powering clove taste and slightly sour.  The meat did tenderize, but we had to cover the taste with a lot of barbecue sauce. Sorry, but this marinade just about ruined by July 4th meal.

Simply Delicious, excellent combination of flavors. You can substitute beef broth for the oil and put it in the crock pot with a roast and it really is fantastic.

I love this marinade.   I admit I make one change. Rather than marinading in a bowl I put it in a bag with as much air as possible removed.  I have also found I can deglaze the pan with a tablespoon or two of ketchup and maybe some of the same ingredients in the marinade like the vinegar and worcestershire sauce makes a great pan sauce.

I made a smaller amount since I had some thin-sliced steak to marinade.  I left out the salt and the cloves and kept the meat in the sauce overnight.  I grilled the steaks and they tasted great. I topped them with grilled peppers and onions, and the Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread found on this site and wrapped it all in grilled pitas.

This recipe is reminiscent of A1 Steak Sauce.  It's very good.  I used chuck steak and marinated for three days.  It was a hit.

I used 2/3 the amount of cloves called for and marinated some tough beef for 3 days before making kebobs. I was surprised at how good it was considering I don't like cloves and generally find them overpowering.

so this was my first time marinating my steak and was mostly using this recipe as a guide but i added, without measuring, worcestire as the base, half a squeezed lemon, a splash of low sodium soy sauce and hot sauce, garlic powder and regular basalmic vinegar. delicious!!

The flavour is OK, perhaps a little vinegary - that may be my choice of vinegar. It didn't do too much to tenderise an eye of round after 48 hours. I would use this again but tweak it.

We did not particularly like this recipe and I was quite disappointed because after reading the reviews I was expecting this one to knock our socks off! My family felt that after 3 days of marinating, it was just TOO much.  It was very strong.  If I were to make this again I would probably cut back on the vinegar and maybe the worcestershire sauce or just not marinate it for quite as long....but I doubt that I will make it again.

I sliced my steak, marinated 30 min and 'kabob'ed them. Big mistake - too salty. Will try this again with basting or perhaps marinading w/o slicing the steak first. Too many ppl love this recipe for me to give up on it.

I've used this marinade with sirloin steak and a chuck roast and both times grilled the meat.  With the steak I marinated it 1 day and it was so good, then with the roast I let it marinade for 2 days.  The roast was so tender.  I didn't have parsley on hand so I used chopped cilantro instead.  We love this recipe and will use it a lot!

Awesome!  Served this on Mother's Day.  Everyone loved the flavor.  Only marinated 24 hours and was still delicious and flavorful.  Second time forgot the worcester sauce and it was still great.  Left out cloves both times - not a big fan of cloves.

This made the most delicious steak I have ever had. I used a big piece of flank steak and only let it marinade for a day, then I bbq'd it on real high heat, real quick. It was juicy, flavorful and so tender. YUM!!

This marinade was excellent. Like some of the others, I didn't add any salt since I thought the soy sauce was enough and it was plenty salty. I used it for shish kabobs and marinated for 24 hours and it was fantastic.

Made it tonight,halving and eyeing ingredients. Added garlic powder after reading some other reviews. Marinated 1 1/2 lbs. cubed sirloin about 90 minutes. Kabobed with only mushrooms and red onions and grilled on medium 4 minutes, turned for 3 more minutes. Medium well and SUPER TENDER! Never would have thought of cloves in a marinade for beef, but WOW! Look out, RIBEYES!!! Made 4 skewers with 4 pieces each. Have 10 more pieces still marinating for 2 more days for steak salad. Boyfriend loved it! Serve with salad and garlic pasta or rice pilaf and crusty bread. Yum!

This marinade is great with chicken and vegetables especially mushrooms!  I omitted the ground clove as that didn't sound good to me,  Also, I only marinaded the chicken and mushrooms for 4 to 5 hours.  It was PLENTY of time for the marinade to do it's magic.  I may try ground or fresh ginger the next time...

Awesome. Loved by the whole family. I was a bit leery of the cloves so cut back a little but I don't really think I needed to. I didn't have enough time so only marinaded meat for a few hours and it sill came out great. I can't wait to try again with a longer marinade time to see how much better it can taste! Will definitely use this again.

I marinaded sirloin steak cut into cubes for kabobs for 3 hours.  It was way to vinegary tasting for me or my husband.  I thought it took away from the natural flavor of the beef too much.

This was just YUMMY!  I left out the cloves but had everything else in there.  Marinated a serloin flank steak for a couple of hours and then grilled it.  Even my daughter loved it!  (picky eater queen)  :)

This marinade was fantastic!  We used it on Kabobs and let it marinate for about 24 hours.  I had them for my son's first birthday party and everyone loved it!!!

I always wanted to marinate and grill a chuck steak but was disappointed with this marinade. My ANGUS chuck didn't get very tender after 3 days and and the edges had too much lemon flavor.It did taste good sliced super thin with melted provalone cheese on a hoagy, though.

It's good no doubt,  but not Michelin starred rating that's been mostly given. But I'm guessing as an Indian more spicy is better, so this is more a western palate recipe.

Cloves on beef.  Tasted really funky to us. I’ll go back to garlic and herbs.

The marinade was delicious.  However the receipt called for adding 1 1/2 tsp of salt which i decided not to add.  The meat food was delicious but it still tasted too salty so I think they should recommend using lower sodium soy sauce.  This is why I only rated it 2 stars.

My husband raved about this "Beef Marinade I" recipe (5 stars). I was stunned because I didn't especially like it (3 stars). I am so happy to have a recipe that my husband truly loves. Thank you Debi for sharing your recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I left out the lemon juice because I can't have it.  I also did not have ground cloves but used cinnamon and nutmeg in its place.  Everybody loved it!  Definite keeper!

Sooo good. I came across this at lunch and only ended up marinating my beef for about 5 hours. We BBQ'd it on skewers with cuts of orange and green bell pepper, small chunks of white onion, diced mushrooms and every now and then a halved cheery tomato. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely making this again. :)

Me and my family are not fans of cloves so we chose to skip them. It still turned out utterly amazing! I can't wait until the next family BBQ to whip this baby out.

great marinade.  I used stew meat since it was already precut at the grocery store. The only thing i did different was add about 1/4 c of brown sugar to for extra flavor.. otherwise great!

Great Marinade! I changed the marinade only a little, I'm not a big fan of Soy so I backed it off to 1/2 cup and added more Worcestershire. Marinaded the meat for four hours, great taste. I think I'll add the vegetables to the marinade for a few hours next time and let the meat marinade a little longer. Easy and great tasting. Thanks.
