Oh my goodness!  I served this to guests and none of us could stop laughing (after our faces unpuckered!)  do not use 1 cup of the lemonade powder.  maybe 1/4 cup.  the lemonade mix I used was presweetned, but this was tarter than eating a fresh lemon!

My daughter was looking for a simple recipe to make for a pie contest (she was 6).  She made this and it won first prize in the junior division.  We decreased the lemonade mix by half (we used Country Time) and it was perfect!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I cut back on the lemonade mix by half as one reviewer had suggested.  Though the pie had good flavor it did not congeal-it was a runny mess after 3 hours of refrigeration. However about 12hrs later I did get a firmer consistency. I did follow the ingredients and intructions except for cutting back the lemonade mix.
