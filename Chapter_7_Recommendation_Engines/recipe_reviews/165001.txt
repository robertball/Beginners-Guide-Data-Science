Uh, isn't this a burrito?  Oh well, a rose by any other name. . . it still tastes good!

I used my own homemade taco seasoning and homemade salsa. I used ground turkey to make it a little healthier and I added chopped yellow onion and red pepper as well as fresh minced garlic to make it stretch a little farther. This was a quick meal that I appreciated on a long day. I did also add in fresh chopped tomatoes. NOTE: For feeding three boys and myself, they ate their "wraps" and I had a taco salad with extra lettuce and the chopped tomato.
