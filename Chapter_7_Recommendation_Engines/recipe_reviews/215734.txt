This is very easy to make.  I had cooked up dried garbanzo beans, and I found that I needed slightly more liquid than called for, but it might just have been my beans.  This is also very easy to add extra ingredients to, as I did when I made it the 3rd time, when I added a clove of garlic and some jalapeno pepper.  Great recipe!

We thought this was very good! I did end up having to add extra italian dressing and even a little of the liquid from the beans to get a nice consistancy. I served this with homemade pita chips that were seasoned with garlic powder, sea salt and cracked pepper. Not your traditional hummus, but still very tasty! I am looking forward to playing around with some other additions. Thanks for sharing. :)

Love this!!  Way better than store brand hummus.  The walnuts give it a great flavor.  My daughter is allergic to sesame seeds and this gives us a great alternative to traditional hummus!

My rating based upon my preparation notes here:    There are different quality EVOO. I used one with robust flavor meant for salads and marinade. If EVOO meant for saut√©s is used then the end product is lacking in flavor.      I doubled the salt and pepper in this recipe for better flavor. Companies prepare chick peas differently in the canning process. To prevent a grainy texture I brought them to a boil and simmered them 5-10 minutes before adding them to my blender. Varying amounts of water are in each can. I advise pouring the water from the pan into a Pyrex measuring cup, blend your peas and seasoning then add water back as necessary to achieve a desired texture.Following these notes may give you the optimal outcome. The texture and flavor is great.

Great easy way to make hommus! Followed the recipe and added garlic - two cloves. Great! Will make again.
