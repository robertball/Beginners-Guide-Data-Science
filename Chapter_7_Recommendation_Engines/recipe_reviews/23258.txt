There was no mention of sugar in this recipe, which must have been a mistake. So I had to guess and I added two cups of sugar.  The cake turned out alright, but it was lacking something. It needed more spice and I think it would have been better with the addition of walnuts and raisins.  It took a very long time to bake (1 hour, 15 minutes) and I had to put aluminum foil over the top of it to keep it from burning after the first 30 minutes of baking. Plus, there was too much batter for one pan. It was okay, but nothing special.

I did follow the recipie, despite the lack of sweetener, and found it bland and dry. It was inedible.

I added 2 cups of sugar to the oil & pumpkin mixture and baked for ONLY 1 hour (not 1 hr 15 mins as suggested). I increased the amount of lemon juice in the glaze to 2 tablespoons as well. The cake came out delicious, moist and not too sweet.  

Since I keep a kosher home, I search out vegan dessert recipes to go with meat meals. This was very good after a roast chicken dinner!

Very disappointing. The lack of sweetener in the dough is not made up by the glaze at all. I didn't feel that the cake was edible and threw it
out. I did use a flexible silicone bundt pan for the first time and would rate it a 5 star!

Where's the sugar in this recipe?????  I tasted it before baking and knew there was something missing.  I reviewed what I did and I followed the recipe to the letter.  I ended up reading reviews and added sugar five minutes after I put it in the over.  We'll see what happens.  Recipes should be removed from this site if there is a mistake in them.  There is obviously a mistake in this recipe.

When I tasted the mix before it was put in the oven it didn't even taste like it was going to be good then (most cake tastes ok before it is baked and good when it is done) This cake burnt in the oven at somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes. I thought it was just me, added sugar to the recipe, and tried again. A lot of wasted ingredients and nothing to show for it. I will do something different next time for sure.

I thought it was unusual for a cake recipe to exclude sugar, but I made it anyway. Awful! It definitely needs the sugar.
