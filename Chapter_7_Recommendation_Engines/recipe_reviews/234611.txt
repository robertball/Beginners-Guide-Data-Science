This could be really good with a few modifications. I followed the recipe except for the frosting. I didn't have any canned frosting on hand so I mixed 1/2 cup powdered sugar with a tbsp of milk and stirred in the two tbsp of apple butter.  These really don't need frosting and without it they would be more like an apple danish. My son loves sweet rolls but he found these too sweet.
