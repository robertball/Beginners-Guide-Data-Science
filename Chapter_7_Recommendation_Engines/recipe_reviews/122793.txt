This is a favorite of mine now... replaces all the summer cookout pasta salads. It also is a great way that I have learned to get rid of all my leftover New Year's Day Hams.... My family loves it! I follow it to the T in the recipe, however I have replaced the chopped sharp cheese with a different kind, such as Pepperjack, or Colby.  The dill pickles truly make this whole recipe stand out.

This was very delicious! I used shredded cheese instead of diced because that's what I had on hand, and I tossed in some Italian dressing in place of some of the mayo and mustard. This is great by itself, or served on a lettuce leaf for fancier presentation.

I accidently added some diced celery to this because I could have sworn this called for some until I re-read the recipe! It was a nice mistake though because I liked the extra crunch it gave to this. I also used yellow mustard in place of the dijon because I don't normally have that on hand and I added a few splashes of pickle juice for extra flavor. This was a different kind of pasta salad than I'm used to (I normally go for ranch/italian style ones) but it was surprisingly delicious, especially the pickles. This will be a great 'after easter' salad for us when we usually have too much ham and way too many eggs to use up. Thanks!

I ate this macaroni salad many many years ago.  I remembered all the ingredients and started making it from my head.  To this day, I still make it almost exactly as your recipe reads.  Except I don't measure.  Mmmm.  Thank you for putting it out there for everyone else to enjoy!

This was really good. I am a goober though, I couldn't find dill pickles in my pantry, so I used dill relish, however after I made this dish, I discovered a jar....any way it still worked out rather well. I have no complaints with this dish at all. My kids really loved this, even my son being picky about eggs, ate it. Will make again.

I don't like mayonnaise, so I appreciate guidance when making these types of salads for my family.  This was loved by them all - the only suggestion I received was that possibly capers might compliment the flavor.  Also, I did add a few peas cooked from frozen in the same water I boiled the eggs in.  Very nice!

I made this dish last night with leftover ham.  I switched the cheese to pepper jack, as we like a little "bite" to our food.  It was really delicious!

Really good recipe, I have been looking for a recipe like this for awhile, i love the cheese and the crunch from the pickles, as always you can add to it if you want but really good just the way it is.

This was a hit. I don't like eggs or pickles but there was just enough in this to be good for me. If you like more pickle flavor then add more chopped pickle or maybe some pickle juice. Otherwise this is perfect. Everyone enjoyed.

This is so simple & so yummy!  It will be the only mac salad I make any more.  The only thing I changed was regular mustard for dijon because I didn't have it in the house.

We really liked this salad.  All I had was shredded cheese, so I added 1 1/2 cups of it.  Also added one extra egg.  For the chopped pickles I used dill pickle relish.  Loved the addition of the pickles to the pasta salad.

I just had to use up some leftover ham and didn't feel like anything hot in the 90+ day.  This was surprisingly GOOD!  Only had green onions (which NEVER hurt anything!) and used both chopped dill pickles and some sweet relish.  We enjoyed it for dinner and had leftover for lunch today.  It is really good....the pickles make it!!!

Thank you very much for this great recipe, Lori!  I added a little white sugar & some pickle juice, subbed pepper jack cheese, adjusted amounts of some ingredients to taste and left out the ham.  Really great!

This really works well with left over ham, sometimes it's nice to have an option for something other than ham sandwiches or ham and bean soup and this definitely fit's the bill!  So easy and so delicious. It's different than a regular macaroni salad. Very unique and I get lot's of compliments on how good it is!

This is a good salad and the dill pickle adds a nice contrast.  It seemed to be popular at a recent picnic potluck.  Next time, though, I will double the mayo/mustard combination.  I like my macaroni salad creamy and it was a bit dry using the amounts recommended in the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Very flavorful.  We are not big mayonaise pasta salad people, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that the mayo did not overwhelm the recipe, it added just enough flavor.  I did add a little more dijon mustard than the recipe called for and used dried minced onion in place of the fresh onion.  Finally once, I placed it into my serving pan it looked like it needed a little color, so I topped it off with sprinkles of paprika for added presentation.  Yum!

YUMMY!!!!!  Love this salad!  I did change it a tiny bit....I added a few more eggs, some chopped celery and some of the pickel juice to the salad. Next time I make it I think I may add some green peas and maybe some carrot to make it a true main meal salad! SO GOOD!

Great way to use leftover ham, fast and simple. It does seem to be missing something so next time i'll add oregano +/- onion or garlic salt. I'll also go a little lighter on the dijon mustard next time. Very yummy indeed

I don't know what I did wrong but wasn't really something I will ever make again.  The pickles made it seem to salty for me I think.  Thanks for sharing though. Everyone else loves it so it must have been a mistake on my end.

This was delicious!  I did mix some of the pickle juice with the dijon and mayonnaise and also made 1 1/2 times this mixture as it called for.  I used cubes of sharp cheddar and also grated carrots for color.  One person who doesn't like pickles did like the flavor also so you could make it with just the pickel juice vs chopped pickles.

This reminds me of the ham and macaroni salads served at church luncheons from long ago. I add a cup of chopped celery and a little more mayonaise. If I'm out of dill pickles, a cup of sweet relish works just fine as well.

this is good.  one day i didn't have any salad dressing so i used my honey mustard dressing (Ken's) and a little sbit of sour cream.  still good.  you can play around with this recipe, it will be good with anything.
