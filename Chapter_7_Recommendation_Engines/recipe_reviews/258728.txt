I loved everything about this! The char on the veggies was a really nice touch and made a huge difference in the overall flavor.

Made this, but our Roma tomatoes were on the small size. I used 24 instead of the 18 and it was just PERFECT.  Added a hatch pepper to the mix also.   The recipe as is, only made a little over 2 pints. Next time I will at least double the recipe to make more for canning.  Love the stuff. Made it last year too. 
Now to go buy more peppers and make a double batch. Thank you for sharing.
