This is delish! I appreciate that it uses whole grain pasta and turkey sausages. Even with all the veggies the kids gobbled it up! A very colourful and flavorful dish! I don't really care for green peppers so I used zucchini and peas for the 'green stoplight' colour, I loved that combo of veggies! I liked the beef stock in this too, I think it makes the turkey feel like beef but chicken stock would be just as good. I used a tablespoon of cornstarch with an extra 1/2 cup of stock to thicken the sauce so it stuck to the pasta better and topped it with grated Romano cheese. I served it with the recommended garlic breadstick and green salad, Yum!
