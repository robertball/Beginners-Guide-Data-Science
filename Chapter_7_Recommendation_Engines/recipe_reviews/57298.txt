Pretty good!  A nice sauce with a bit of a zip to it.  I wanted something a bit different than traditional sauce for some chicken mozzarella ravioli.  I was looking for a cream based sauce and didn't want it to be very heavy so this looked like it would be interesting. I used Mr/Mrs T bloody mary mix for the juice and only 32 oz.  I was afraid with so much liquid, the sauce would be too thin for our taste.  I also drained the diced tomatos for the same reason. The sauce turned out the consistancy we like.   A very easy recipe to add spice to your pasta.  A keeper for sure.

So easy and had everything (or equivalent) in my pantry! My kids ate it over penne pasta with parmesan cheese on top.
