An excellent cheesecake.  Rich and beautiful with all the toppings swirled majestically overtop.  We're all fat now and we don't care.  A perfect yearly treat!!

Yum!  I took this one to a family dinner and it got rave reviews.  I used a ready-made chocolate crust and only had about 4 hrs to refrigerate, but it was delicious!

I love cheesecake, and I did like this although I liked it better plain. The oreo cookies and the toppings took away from the cheesecake taste.  My boyfriend said he didn't like it that much at all. It was very easy to make, but next time I will use the cream cheese filling in a graham cracker crust.

I made this for a fundraising event - and it was fabulous!  Everyone raved over the way it looked and one gentleman even asked if it was really homemade. I sliced the cheesecake, placed it on the plate and then drizzled the fudge & caramel toppings over the top.  Really a nice looking dessert that tastes great.

Although I think the title is misleading (because it only has chocolate crust), this was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner! I made it in a spring form pan. I followed the recipe up until step 3, where I changed it a bit. After letting the cheesecake cool a bit, I made a caramel topping which I spread out to make a top layer before refrigerating. I used 1 (7 oz) package caramels, 1/4 c. evaporated milk, and 3/4 c. chopped pecans. Place caramels and evap. milk in a heavy suacepan. Heat over medium until smooth, stir in pecans.

This cheesecake was terrific! I made it for my husband's birthday & he loved it.  I had never made a cheesecake before, so I was a little nervous, but it turned out great & was very easy.  The only thing I did differently was buy a premade Oreo crust instead of making one.

I used a pre-made pie shell, which worked well.  Everyone, including my husband loved it.

This cheesecake was ok. There was entirely too much filling, and the filling was not dense enough. The toppings did add some nice flavor and texture, though not enough for me to make this recipe again.

This was OK, but I also thought the cookie crust overpowered the taste of the cheesecake.

Made this a couple years back for Thanksgiving.  My boyfriend loved it so much he didn't want to share it with anyone! lol.  I modify the recipe by using a a Keebler graham cracker crust.  It's quicker and helps to  enhance the cheesecake flavor-- without detracting from the toppings.  This recipe is now my go-to for holiday desserts!

Made this cheesecake for my boyfriend's family the weekend I met them…. His grandmother said I'm now her favorite because of this cheesecake! HAHA! Seriously though, everyone absolutely loved this.  It's the perfect mix of sweets!
