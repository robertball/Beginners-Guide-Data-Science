I haven't found a tuna recipe that tastes much different and more fantastic than adding a can of tuna and peas to a box of mac and cheese. I always add some extra cheese in when I made this. So if you like tuna casserole, or what we called tuna yuk you will like this, it's not worth the extra effort. Just make some mac and cheese and mix in tuna and peas.

This was good.  I used macaroni noodles instead egg noodles (because i didn't have any egg noodles).  I also omitted the peas (my daughter does not like them) and added a handful of kraft shredded mexican 4 cheese blend.

I wouldn't make this for a special dinner, but I love it for everyday eating because it's cheap, easy and doesn't have a lot of ingredients, but does include veggies and protein.  Perfect for a busy, poor grad student.  Or, I'd guess, family.  I'm going to try adding more or different veggies for variety.

This was okay, but definitely on the dry side. I had to add more sour cream and milk. The flavor was pretty good, though.

Good Stuff!  I didn't think this would have enough flavor, but it was very good!  Nice change from the "cream of" soup recipes.  I did double the tuna because I like lots, and used mushrooms rather than peas, my toddler son won't eat peas.  He liked it too!  Thanks!

I think this is a good base recipe, not using canned soup, that can be tweaked to suit individual tastes. We used macaroni, cooking some frozen peas with the pasta, and cooked about 1T of diced onion, a diced celery stalk and a clove of garlic in 1T butter, before adding 2 cans of tuna (one just didn't seem like enough), a good amount of pepper and about 1t "Mrs. Dash" seasoning, before stirring in the sour cream, milk and elbows. A nice, easy, tasty weeknight meal.

I made the recipe as stated except for halving it and adding 1 t garlic salt and 1/2 t lemon pepper and using frozen peas.  It was okay as is.  After taking an initial taste though I decided to jack it up even more by adding a hard boiled egg that was hanging out in my refrigerator and about 1 ounce of Velveeta cheese.  With those adjustments, I would give it 5 stars.  Thanks!

This is a simple easy recipe. It tastes a little bland. I had to add a little more sour cream to make it moist. Even though it needs "something", I kind of liked it.

I also used mushrooms instead of peas and I added a teaspoon of sweet mustard to make the sauce slightly more pungent. Overall, I would make this again.

This was quite good, though a bit on the dry side. I will be using this recipe again, but I'll experiment with additional milk, sour cream, cheese, and different spices. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a really bland recipe.  Thought it was too runny.  If I do make it again I will add some other things and cut back on the milk.

Tasted waaaaay too bland for me. I have never had any kind of canned tuna recipe (besides sandwiches) so I wanted to give it a try...this recipe seemed easy enough so I gave it a try. Well, I was sorry...sorry to say I won't be making this one again.

It was quick and easy. It tasted good but I felt like it needed another flavor that I couldn't pin.
