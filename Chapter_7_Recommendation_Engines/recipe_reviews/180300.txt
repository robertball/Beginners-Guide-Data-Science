This was amazing! So amazing that I won a chili cook off with this recipie! The one thing I changed was I added brown sugar to  it when I thought sugar wasnt enough. I also added more peaches than apples. This will be the chili that I will make instead of the boring old kind from now on.

I was at first very nervous over trying this with the amount of chili powder called for but decided to go for it. This was our first encounter with a banana pepper and it was delicious in this. I even added the pinch of cayenne. I think the fruit cuts the spiciness down. Will do this chili again.

Excellent!  If you're looking for something sweet and spicy, this is it!  I used one small white onion in place of the red onion because that's all I had and I used two banana peppers from the garden instead of one.  My husband and I loved it.  I may try brown sugar in place of the white sugar only because I personally would have liked a little more sweetness, but my husband said it was perfect just the way it was.  Will definitely keep this one.  Thanks!

I used two cans diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce because we like tomatoes. I also only had canned peaches so I used 1/2 can peaches in place of fresh peach. The chili has a sweet and spicy kick!

I originally didn't think Fruit Chili would taste good but this was amazing! I used banana and coconut milk as well in this, which turned out wonderfully. Quick, simple, and delicious.

I actually won the chili contest at my work with this one too! I took some of the advise such as sauce and tomatoes (with green chilis), splitting sugar between brown and white, two glasses of water, and I also split the meat with ground beef and sausage.  The taste unique and the flavors really complemented each other.  Oh and because "Fruity Chili" turned people off I renamed it Chica Loca Chili (Chiquita banana inspired)

This sounded weird, but it turned out as good as they said. I used a slow cooker for a work pot luck. I just added the fruit right before I put it out.

I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and used the canned peaches as suggested by lisa73177. This was a great recipe.
