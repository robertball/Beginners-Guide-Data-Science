Something tells me I'm about to gain weight, and I blame Aunt Martha! ;)  I made this coffee cake two days ago - and it's gone. I substituted brown sugar for the sugar in the walnut mixture (and used almonds because that's what I had). I also used whole wheat pastry flourr, and put the sugar/nut mixture in the middle, which made a delicious, ooey gooey ribbon in the cake. Then I topped it with a glaze made of powdered sugar, milk, and a little almond extract. The sour cream is what really makes it awesome. i will absolutely make this again. Thanks!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but I had way too much batter and instead of going with my gut feeling I went ahead and but it in the oven. It started spilling over and now its all over my oven. The batter tasted great while I was making it.

Three stars is being generous. I looked at the amount of batter and immediately knew it would not fit into a 9"x5" loaf pan. I chose to use a 9"x9" baking dish and it still was too much batter. 
The coffee cake had a pleasing flavour, but I found the coffee cake was too dry.

I too had a problem with the batter running over into the oven and I had to bake it an additional 25 minutes which resulted in the nuts on top burning.  I think next time I will bake in an 8 inch square pan and eliminate the extra sugar in the batter as it was a tad too sweet, but will add the chopped nuts.  Half the sugar in the nuts for the topping.  My husband very much enjoyed the flavor of the cake.
