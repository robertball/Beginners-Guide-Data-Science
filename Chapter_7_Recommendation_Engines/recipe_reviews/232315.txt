Only changes were red pepper instead of green ( red were on sale for 20 cents) and I used a gorgonzola flavored cracker. I liked the texture but some may find it too soft..I would say drain the tomatoes off if you like a firmer loaf

This makes a huge loaf. The trouble with it is that it was very wet and relatively flavorless. I made it exactly as the recipe said, except that I drained it when I put the rest of the sauce on top. I will not be making this again.

I made half the recipe. It was just delicious but I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I am making this recipe from now on! Loved it!

Well....what can I say.  This had the potential to be good.  Probably just my family's tastes are different.  But I found it to be VERY heavily seasoned.  Not sure if it was due to the stewed tomatoes....or the thyme (I DID put in half the called for thyme...should have cut it even further or left it out)...but everyone found it inedible, except for me...but only because I refuse to waste food.  It was highly unpleasant.  The texture is good, it smells good.  The sauce on top seems fine.  Just the seasonings are off.  I DID make two modifications.... 1/2 the thyme (as mentioned) and instead of 3lbs turkey, I used 2lbs turkey and 1lb 93% beef...neither modification would have made the seasonings this overwhelming.

This was different but very good. Makes enough to feed a houseful. Excellent for people who don't eat red meat, plus lower calories. Absolutely recommend it.

Made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!  Used 2/3 ground round and 1/3 ground turkey - not much grease in the pan. Mashed potatoes as a side dish made this the perfect comfort meal (no other veggie needed with all the veggies in it). Split the meat mixture in half before baking; I will freeze the other half for another time. The tomato sauce mixture made a lot.
