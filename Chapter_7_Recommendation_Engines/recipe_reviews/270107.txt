Excellent soup!  I doubled the recipe for a potluck and it was almost all gone.  I didn’t add the bay leaf as I was out.  I used 3 sweet potatoes.  I used 1/2 low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 regular.  No other changes and several people raved about it!  What’s amazing is that it has 1/2 the calories as other sweet potato soups and still creamy and full of flavor.

So delicious! I will definitely make this again and again. I didn’t have Gouda so I used mozzarella instead. Everything else was as recipe directed. I will admit though that the finished product did not look as colorful and appealing as the posted photo, lol

I followed the recipe as written, I didn't change a thing and will not!  I make a lot of soup because my Mom is losing her teeth and now this is my new favorite soup and so very easy to make.
