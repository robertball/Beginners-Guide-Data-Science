Deceptively simple and--Delicious! The two key instructions made all the difference. 

1. Salting and draining the cucumbers to get a note of crispness and lose the slight bitterness is a game-changer. 

2. Adding the red wine vinegar and tossing before adding the olive oil allows the salad to soak up the vinegar instead of being made water-proof by adding oil first.

Made it as written. Delicious. Served with toasted pita bread. Got better over a day or two.more flavor after it was in fridge a day.  Salting the cucumbers and rinsing them after 15 mins made a big difference and definitely worth the extra effort. Kept them crunchy for days till we ate it all.

Fabulous salad. A little different from my usual effort and I think I will stick with this one. 
I made 2 differences - I had to add 1 clove of Russian garlic  only because I love garlic and I used lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar mainly because I had no red wine vinegar. Absolutely delicious. If you are looking for a Greek salad recipe go with this one.

When fresh, itâ€™s fantastic. Still good leftover but it loses a little of the crunch. Definitely a keeper

Lots of chopping particularly  if you use Chef John's cubing method but well worth it.  It was still fresh a day later.  You can also make it a day earlier IF you don't add the dressing.  Chopped scallions on top was a good garnish.

I am not big into salads and I am not sure why I even tried this. However, my wife and I absolutely loved it, and it will be something I make often. To us, it was a meal in itself.

This is a terrific salad for two, I cut it in half and pick up some of the ingredients at our market's salad bar, saves on a lot of waste of things going bad in the refrigerator.  I toss in a 1/2 can of garbanzo  bean in this dish and some cooked chicken or even fish if I want to just make a meal out of this.  I serve ours with Pita.

Best Greek salad ever! Made it several times over the last few months. We definitely prefer it over traditional Greek salads.

Wow!  This is one delicious salad!!!  Even my skeptical, meat and potato loving husband thought it was really good.  I mistakenly used a can of sliced black olives with jalapeno peppers and in my opinion really added to this recipe.  Didn't have so didn't add the green olives.  Otherwise pretty much went by recipe.  Thanks for submitting this!

Wonderful Greek salad recipe. Made it as stated with the exception of the green olives. Mine had pimentos in them. I could have taken them out, but didn't.

Excellent! I think maybe some green olives would go well in the salad as well; as an optional substitute for black olives.

Used dried oregano, 1 t., 1/2 t. respectively. Also one Roma Tomato (peeled), 2  green onions, & topped with freshly toasted sunflower seeds. 
Was heavenly. As usual, Chef John is amazing!
LAst week, made his creamy bay scallops & pasta recipe! Was simple yet tasted like I worked all day cooking -many thanks to you, Chef.

I made this for myself and scaled it back. I didn't have tomatoes on hand and I wanted to use up a red pepper and a remaining cucumber.  I didn't realize I was out of kalamata olives, but I used some of a jar of marinated olive antipasto and a few garlic stuffed olives.  I used dried oregano since that's all I had on hand and I also didn't have any feta cheese. I used several light drizzles of the vinegar and a few drizzles of olive oil, lightening it up considerably. It was fantastic and I will definitely not hesitate to make for a crowd and take to potlucks. Paired wonderfully with a glass of Chardonnay!  I'm going to have the rest for lunch tomorrow. I could also see adding chicken and making it a main dish.

I have used this website for years.  It's my go to place for recipes. However, I have never reviewed anything even though I read most reviews before I try a recipe. This time I am doing a review! Chef John always has excellent recipes. This is absolutely another winner. As I always do with his, I made it just as he wrote it and it was perfect!!!

Good. Just make sure that you put the feta cheese in After you are done putting in the vinegar and olive oil. If you put it in before, the salad does not look as nice.

I had forgotten to buy red wine vinegar so had to make it with balsamic vinegar instead.  And it was very delicious!  It just darkened the ingredients a bit.  I served it over a bed of lettuce and with pita chips and hummus for a tasty and very filling dinner.  My meat-loving hubby really liked it too!

This is an excellent salad! I didn't miss the lettuce, either. For the olives, I had a jar of Greek medley marinated olives, so I went with that, and they had delicious Greek flavors. This was nice to have as a big dinner salad, with a glass of red wine, or course! Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!

I loved it. I also soaked the onions as I have trouble with the rawness of them. I would soak both for 15 minutes next time and let dry longer.

I omitted the Bell Peppers and I added about 2 tablespoons of minced fresh Mint. I also was unable to get the English Cucumbers so I used regular ones. All in all, it turned out spectacularly. You may need to add more dressing because the amounts the recipe calls for just isn't enough but that's just my taste. My Husband loved it and he's extremely picky. I will make this again.

All the flavor of a typical Greek salad, but without the lettuce (which is just a filler, in my opinion). Don't skimp on the feta!  A colorful dish that would look appealing for a potluck or summer barbeque.

It was about a year ago when I had my first Greek Salad in a NJ diner and it was delicious. Several times since then, I have attempted to replicate the dish using recipes I'd find around the 'net. A couple were good, a couple were not so good; but none of them hit the mark. THIS recipe hit the mark, spot-on. I didn't change a thing. Bravo. Brilliant. Two Thumbs Up. Five Stars.

I made it with no dressing at all.  Also left out the oregano.  We all loved it.

I added carrots, and didn't have fresh oregano, so next time I would try the fresh oregano and add avocado.

I was never a fan of Greek salad until I discovered this little gem of a recipe.  Thank you, Chef John!!!  This was so delicious and addicting!  I brought some to work and coworkers loved the colors and aroma.  I directed them to Allrecipes/Chef John.  You rock!

After tasting, I decided it needed more oregano. Lovely recipe, only complaint is the excess liquid at the botton is distressing, but in any case it tastes great. Fresh, crunchy, great range of flavours.

I don't like olives but enjoy the flavor of Castrelavano olives. Mild, buttery flavor for those who don't like the sharp flavor of kalamatas

This hearty heart healthy salad was a family pleaser.  I added hearts of palm and artichoke hearts. Chicken, tuna, chickpeas or salmon could be added as well.

Replaced the Feta with Cabot's dangerously sharp cheddar (food preference of my guest) and it was a spectacular success. 
May become a staple for fancy private dinners. 
I would mention that the Video made a lot more sense than the written instructions though.

This is a great refreshing salad.  I don't like tomatoes so I add red peppers instead & it was still a great salad.  I liked the saltiness that the olives brought to the dish.  Yum!

This was a quick and easy salad to throw together. Only modification that I made was to use a regular cucumber, as I had one on the fridge, crying to be used up! Like Chef John said, you really can use the ingredients list as a rough outline, depending on your tastes. I liked that I could put to use some of the fresh oregano that is growing in my herb garden. We served this with some grilled chicken thighs and my Za'atar roasted potatoes.

This is over the top delicious. My husband and I have made it 3 times so far this summer. We took it to the beach in individual Tupperware one time, beats carb loaded sandwiches and chips.

For us, the olives were overwhelming and drowned out the other flavors. Next time, I will skip the olives or just use a small amount as a garnish, add a few diced and drained regular tomatoes and almost 1/2 again as much feta cheese. I think I will try adding some dried mint next time as well.

I always make it just like the recipe reads the first time; then I'll tweak it if it needs more.  I don't need to tweak this one at all.  It was great. Very refreshing.

Absolutely delicious.  Was looking for a good healthy salad. 
Thank you Chef John!  I made it with only one exception, leaving pimentos in the green olives.  As other reviewers stated, this was even better the next day.  Went well with greek seasoned grilled chicken breasts.  Today will enjoy Greek wraps with leftover chicken and salad and romaine.

Added a can of Albacore Tuna, fantastic with or without. Very refreshing.
