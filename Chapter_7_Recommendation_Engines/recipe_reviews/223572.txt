This was easy to make and comes out very creamy. I would definitely double the lime juice. It tasted too sweet before freezing but just right after freezing. It's very avocadoy so if you don't like the flavor of avocado or guac, this one's not for you.....

I have a very similar recipe, I just use 2 avocados. This is a great summertime dessert, avocado and lime make a wonderful combination. Not too sweet, but you can definitely use less sugar if desired.

Like the other reviewers said, it tastes very avocadoy and very creamy, and not too sweet.  I think this recipe would use more lime juice and less avocado.

I forgot to boil the sugar and water and instead just put everything in the blender.  They still came out great and I will make them again.  Next time I'll see if dissolving the sugar changes the overall flavor or texture.

This was just ok. It was too thick for my blender so I had to add more water, maybe that's why these just didn't have enough flavor for us. I did not boil the water and sugar, just threw them right in the blender and had no issues with the sweetness.
