These are perfect for Christmas!  I confess that I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have time for a dry run with it as written and I was looking for a plain rich chocolate flavor.  My changes were simple - omitted lemon zest and wisked 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa into the dry ingredients and 1 tsp. vanilla extract in with the eggs.  The result was the flavor I'd hoped for with a light cake texture.  I'd prefer a slightly denser texture, but this can't be beat for for an easy, quick, from-a-mix recipe.  Using a 1-inch melon ball scoop yielded a small cookie - perfect for cookie exchanges.  Otherwise I would double the cookie size.  The trick to the crackles is to roll the dough balls around until the confectioners sugar is thick and even all the way around.  Be sure not to overbake or the cookies become too firm and dry.  Very pretty!

Everyone Loves this cookie. To make more decadent add 1 cup white chocolate chips fold into prepared batter. This white chocolate really makes a difference and brings these cookies to a level of pure indulgence!

I also did with chocolate fudge cake mix and added 1 cup white chocolate and then placed a hersheys chocolate drop in center of each ball I call this a Triple chocolate cookie crinkle!

Needed to make 90 cookies for a Christmas Cookie exchange and decided to try these for a few reasons: pretty, tasty, and inexpensiveo make.  I read the other reviews and decided to use the lemon zest anyway.  Don't skip this part!  It gives the cookie a plate-cleansing, bright flavor, but just a touch.  You don't even need to use a full teaspon.  Also, even though I doubled the recipe, I only got 45 cookies!  I used a 1 inch melon baller.  I suspect I bought the wrong box mix: so WARNING- make sure it is Duncan Hines CAKE and not Red Velvet CUPCAKE box mix.  I guess the box mix would have had a bigger amount. BUT that all being said, the cookies turned out delicious and beautiful!  Next time, I will use the rigt box mix!  Oh. And these cookies ARE messy but worth it!

Followed the recipe as well as what some others recommended: added in a quarter cup of cocoa and a dash of vanilla. Didn't have any lemon zest so I used a half teaspoon of lemon extract. (I agree with the commenter who urged people not to skip the lemon, it doesn't make these lemon flavored just adds a depth of taste to the cookie.) Also, as has been written here, I didn't think the cornstarch was necessary to making the powdered sugar coating. After the first batch, I mixed in some milk chocolate chips and some Andes Peppermint Crunch baking chips. Oh boy, are they wonderful!

Delicious and pretty. I think the temp could really be 350 as the box suggests opposed to 375, to ensure they don't overcook on the bottom of the cookie.

These were fantastic! The only thing I changed was using lemon extract instead of the zest. I didn't measure it, just dribbled some into the bowl. Everyone loved them and they disappeared so quickly - I will definitely make these again.

The cookies came out super moist and thats always huge plus. Although they were far from bad tasting, the flavor wasn't exceptional either. It's not a cookie you impress with.

Great cookie recipe but I would recommend a couple of changes. Refrigerate the dough for a least 2 hours or overnight. There is no need to use any corn starch but roll a thick layer of powdered sugar on the dough balls. Lemon zest is optional depending on your taste buds.

These cookies present so beautifully! I made them for a party, and they were really soft and tasty. I thought the dough was painfully thick, so I added another tablespoon of melted butter, which worked out great - the cookies didn't spread too much or anything. There was a lot of left over powered sugar left over, so I'd halve that in the future. Also, the lemon zest does have a nice flavor, makes it distinctly different from a chocolate crinkle cookie. I used a tablespoon to scoop out the cookies, and it yielded 34.

Made these into cutouts.  Regardless of the size/thickness, the lemon zest is very off putting.  And, there's no reason to put cornstarch into the powdered sugar.  This is nothing like Panera's red velvet crinkle cookie.

I made these cookies for Christmas and followed the recipe exactly, except that I took others advice and refrigerated the very sticky dough a bit, baked them on a wax paper- covered cookie sheet, lowered the temp to 350F and baked for 15 minutes. Perfect. I used a melon scoop and made 48 cookies with a  relatively small amount of powdered sugar left over. They have a nice crackled appearance, chewy middle and a clean taste. They do taste like lemon, however.  If you want them to taste like chocolate then these aren't it and maybe by adding a cup of white chocolate chips, as someone suggested, would do the trick. I will try that next time.

These couldn't have came out better if I tried! I did end up using Betty Crockers' Red velvet cake mix (not that it matters) and I took them out after 9 minutes.  Very adorable and super delicious!

I have made these cookies several times and they are always devoured!  I also add white chocolate chips and it makes for a more decadent cookie.  Chilling the dough for at least an hour is important because right after you mix it, it's quite sticky.  Also I found that baking it for 8 1/2 minutes makes them nice and soft.

These were pretty good, loved the lemon zest in them.  Also added 1cup of white chocolate chips into batter.  Using a small melon baller for cookies, recipe makes about 2 dozen.  Had quite a bit of powdered sugar mixture left.  Baked cookies for 11min.  Delicious!

I happen to LOVE the lemon zest and actually use the zest of 1 large or 2 small lemons AND the juice of those lemons. It cuts the sweetness of the box mix and the powdered sugar. I’ve been making these for the last 7 Christmases and they’re always a hit and they’re asked for all year long. I will say that I use a small ice cream scoop and I only get about 21-24 cookies depending on how level I make the scoops. The scooper is a little more than a tablespoon. 9 minutes + cooling on the pan gives a great cookie.

Made these for a work birthday party and they are delicious. I will make them again at the holidays. I added about 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa and 1 tsp vanilla extract, and did not add lemon zest.

I really wanted to like these. I made the cookies as close to the recipe as I could (Duncan Hines RV cake box is now 15.25 oz and not the 18.25 oz. listed on the recipe). Maybe the missing 3 oz.  is why they just didn't have the flavor I thought they would. I did like the lemon zest and I might make a version with scratch red velvet cake and use the zest again.

The cookies are very good but there was a huge waste of confectioners sugar.  I could have cut it back by half.  Also, I really couldn’t form balls until after I dipped a teaspoonful of dough in the sugar because the dough is so sticky.

This makes a pretty cookie - wasn't my favorite, probably because of the box mix - but it went quickly and presentation was very nice. Note the size of the box mix on this recipe - 18.25 oz. I used a Betty Crocker box mix, added the 1/4 c unsweetened cocoa powder, 1tsp vanilla, and left out the lemon zest/extract. While mixing this up, it didn't look like there is enough wet ingredients so I added a little olive oil at a time (don't use more egg since this will make it more cakey). I did chill it in the fridge for about 2 - 3 hours before scooping the dough out using a tablespoon and rolling it in the powdered sugar to make a thick covering. I baked these in a 350 degree oven for 12 minutes and came out very good - somewhat crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.

A holiday social pleaser. Did not have lemon zest, but was fine without.

Like most, I added 1/4 unsweetened cocoa and 1 tsp vanilla. I didn't bother with a powder dusting. Plain Jane. Delish!

This recipe is so easy. Will add this to my list of Christmas cookies. I added the lemon zest and a 1/4 cup of cocoa. The dough was very sticky so I refrigerated it for a half hr and it was much easier to roll.

These turned out great. I also added 6 oz white chocolate chips. And used lemon juice instead of the zest.

These cookies certainly look impressive with such a beautiful red peeking through the powdered sugar crust.  I'm sorry to say we didn't find that the flavor to lived up to expectations and considering the mess the sticky red dough and powdered sugar made I don't think I'll be making these again

I followed the advice of adding 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and some vanilla. I didn't have a real lemon so I used lemon juice concentrate, next time I'll do real lemon zest. The cookies are more cake-like than I enjoy but they are a beautiful maroon color with a perfect powdered sugar "crinkle " effect, no cornstarch needed

These cookies were easy. I added half the lemon and it tasted normal. These cooked well and looked A+ but tasted like a B+... Easy cookies for my last Christmas batch (4 total). These were the least special but an easy last for a good assortment. If you're looking for a special cookie recipe, this isn't it. It is easy AF though

Easy cheater cookies for Christmas!  I took out the lemon zest, added unsweetened cocoa like another poster suggested, and also added almond extract.  They have a great consistency!  Don't freak out at the batter - it's super wet and thin for a cookie batter, but it will turn out just fine.  I used a 1.5 TBSP melon ball scoop to make my cookies consistent sizes, and it helped me to work with the wet dough.

This was excellent! I can barely keep my kids away from eating all of them tonight! The only changes I made were from the reviewer who suggested 1/4 cup of cocoa and a tsp of vanilla. I also omitted the lemon zest since I didn't have any, and added 2 tsp of water since the batter was a bit dry. Oh and we added a few chocolate chips to the batter for some extra chocolatey yumminess. We'll definitely make these again! Now my 4 year old is saying, "I love you like a red velvet cookie!"

I liked them, everyone else seemed to love them.  I don't care for box mix cookies overall so might be a little biased.  Don't forget to add the white chocolate chips!

Made these exactly as stated and they were delicious!!  The lemon zest is a must!  do not omit this ingredient.  My family loved them. They only lasted 2 days in our house before completely disappearing.

These cookies were delicious! I did make the changes that other reviews suggested. I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 cup of white chocolate chips. I did not add lemon zest because I thought it sounded like the 'what doesnt belong here' item. I baked them at 350° for 10 minutes and they were perfect. My husband loved them and he doesn't like red velvet anything. I will definitely be making them again

I got 48 cookies. I think the temperature is too high as my first batch burned. I'd lower the temperature to 350. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added some Christmas color morsels and liked that idea (red, green and white) . I also used 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract as I didn't have any lemon zest. I liked the addition of the lemon taste.  I make chocolate crinkles all the time. I don't add the cornstarch to the powdered sugar when I make my chocolate crinkles but did this time  as this recipe called for it and I found it a good idea as it made my powder sugar go further and I only needed the 1 cup as directed in the recipe.  I used parchment paper to bake them as it is easier and they don't stick.  My only disappointment was that the first batch burned. I'll make them again but I'll try reducing the temperature.

Tasted great but adding a half teaspoon of  vanilla and half a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. I only used a pinch of cornstarch. Very soft and chewy. I made sure to use more powdery sugar before setting it to bake. I took the cookies out after 6 minutes, any longer it would've been hard and burnt.

It turned out amazing! I rolled it in the powdered sugar and squished them and cooked for 11 mins. I took out the lemon zest (as I didnt have any lemons) and it was all good. A lot of extra powdered sugar though. Overall its amazing! YUM!
