Delicous! This comes pretty darn close to the fast food version if I do say so myself! It tastes great and turns a plain burger into something really, really good. I used this on "The Perfect Basic Burger" which is a great base for adding toppings and sauces. Great along with shredded iceberg lettuce, cheese, pickles, and chopped onions on a toasted sesame seed bun!

Family absolutely loved this!!!  It is now requested at every barbeque and definitely "dresses" up a burger beyond the normal accompaniments of mayo, mustard and ketchup!  NOTE:  DO NOT substitute the French dressing for ketchup as it changes the flavor significantly.  Thanks Cairol ~ definitely a winner!!!

This is about the recipe that I use when I want to make my home-made version of a "BM" burger from that famous Golden Arched restaurant. Very easy.  Shape and then Cook 2 very thin beef burger patties on a skillet, grill, pan w/e. (Try to avoid using leaner beef). Season them to taste with nothing but salt and pepper while cooking. While they're cooking mix up this special sauce concoction. I use thousand island dressing, normally just eyeball it as it's very easy to after you make it a few times. If you want a little more acidity/saltiness add a TINY bit of vinegar, want it sweeter? add more sugar. too much acidity? add more mayo. And I use fresh onion. Use thick burger buns and carefully cut the top piece of the bun into two pieces w/ a serrated knife. VIOLA! You have your 3 piece BM bun. Optionally toast the 3 burger bun pieces and then Layer items as follows: Bottom burger bun, special sauce, MORE fresh chopped onions(optional), shredded lettuce, beef patty, the halfway bun (half of the top piece that you cut in half), then more special sauce, chopped onions, shredded lettuce, the second beef patty, a slice of American cheese, the other half of the top bun. DONE! Now you have a great tasting fresher BM with 100% certainty that some 16 year old didn't spit a loogey in it. I usually pair this delicious burger with some GREAT VALUE brand frozen seasoned french fries and no ketchup for those fries! This special sauce also makes an EXCELLENT french fry dipping sauce. Enjoy!

This is DELICIOUS and tastes even better than the sauce on the commercial burger (you know, the one with two "all beef patties"?

Thanks for sharing!!!!!!

This is outstanding, and is EXACTLY like the famous fast food chain's "special" sauce! Very important to use the French dressing and not ketchup because it will not turn out the same at all. We stored this in the fridge for about 3 hours before using on our burgers, and I could not believe how this tastes like the famous fast food sauce. I recommend making this ahead of time, because the flavor was much better as it sat and the ingredients blended together. I have tried many other recipes for burger sauces and this is the winner for sure! Thanks for sharing , we will use this often! :)

Tasty sauce! I halfed the recipe since I was only making 4 burgers and that was still plenty. I didn't have pickle relish and chopped some pickled cucumber chips. I've made this twice. The first time, I didn't have French dressing and used 1000 Island dressing and that worked as well. More flavorful with French though. My husband liked it so much that he slathered more on his burger. Thanks!

yup, tastes like mac sauce.  i think i ended up adding a little extra sugar because i prefer mine sweeter and i didn't have dried onion so i used 1/2 tsp of minced fresh red onion.  made this for a barbeque and everyone loved it on their burgers and hot dogs.  will definitely make this again!

This sauce is absolutely fantastic!!  My family loved this.  This was even better than, *ahem*, that fast food place with the famous special sauce.  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe that indulges my fast food craving with ingredients fresh from my own kitchen!

The search is over!  This is THE sauce recipe for the ultimate burger.  We keep this onhand and use it as a dip for chicken tenders, salad dressing, etc.  Very versatile!  As others mentioned, I also used the "Creamy French Dressing" recipe by Taste of Home Test Kitchen off of this site, and then made the sauce.  For even better results, use homemade bread and butter pickles for the relish.  DIVINE!  Thank you, Cairol!

Pretty darn good!  A little more rich than the fast food version-I think I'll use only 1/4 cup French dressing next time.  Otherwise, tastes fabulous on the burger!!

This was very,very Good!!! I used it on Hamburgers, Hot dogs, and sandwiches. I also used "Creamy French Dressing" from this site! At Jack in the box if you ask for it they have a secret sauce too. I ran into some employees that didnt know about it well this recipe is close to that but even better! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.....God Bless.

This sauce was good.  I made a half batch because ther are only two of us who would want this.  I thought the recipe would be just like the "special sauce" at the local chain.  So I was a little disappointed to find out it wasn't.  next time i will try thousand island to see if it is closer.  The sauce was definately good though!  The fiance ate 3 burgers and added more sauce than I had put on for him!  Even with a half batch we still have plenty and I'm trying to think about what else I can put this on.  We might make some omelets and put this on it, not positive yet. Thanks for the treat to make the burgers special!

GREAT recipe!  I made a half batch because I wasn't sure we would like it.  Not fans of sweet pickle relish.  Even debated making this using dill relish.  So glad I didn't.  We had this on "Mini Cheeseburgers" from the AR site and everyone LOVED it.  It was also good with pretzels dipped in it.  Next time I will make the full batch size.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was VERY good! I posted a picture. I had to use onion powder instead of dried minced onion, but I added fresh minced onion to the burger! It was almost EXACT. I will use this recipe every time I make burgers. Thanks for sharing!

YUM! I scaled the recipe down, but followed it exactly otherwise. I didn't have any creamy french dressing on hand, so I made my own using the 'Creamy French Dressing' recipe from this site, and it produced great results. This is one of the better hamburger sauces that I have tried. While this didn't taste EXACTLY like the famous chains version, IMO, we loved it, and I will definately be using this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum!  Delicious burger sauce!  This will give an ordinary burger that extra special addition of flavor!  I think if thousand island dressing was used in place of the french dressing, this recipe would taste very close to the famous fast food burger sauce.  Nonetheless, this recipe is delicious as is and perfect on burgers!  Makes a good dipping sauce for french fries as well.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This is yummy and tastes just like the Big Mac sauce.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Gives an ordinary hamburger just a little jazz.  The only change I made was not to add the sugar. This will be a regular addition to my cookouts.

I did not have French dressing but I did have low-carb ketchup, so I used that. I also used low-fat mayonnaise. I chopped up my own garlic-onion dill pickles and I omitted the sugar. At the last, I added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Pretty good, but I think I'll cut back the mayonnaise next time and make it more 50/50 with the ketchup. Maybe add some hot sauce and a few spices.
