This is an incredibly simple recipe that can be made with common ingredients. I made these last night to use up some extra cream cheese I had and the folks at my office scarfed them down in no time flat. They go great with coffee or tea. Just one tip: make sure to work with the dough when its still chilled or it will be difficult to fold the pastries.

The cookie is fairly easy to make. I had a problem with them exploding open in the oven but found that I needed to roll the dough thinner and I probably need to use a bigger circle. I did not think that using a 2 and 3/4 inch diameter circle would make a difference but it did. It was hard to get enough jelly in them. But all that aside it is one of the most delicious cookies I have ever tried and I will keep trying until I can make them perfect (or until I weigh 500 pounds which ever comes first)!

I made these cookies this evening. It goes very well with tea or coffee. It is simple and delicious. I sprinkled roasted sesames on top before I put them in the oven. The filling can be changed next time I will try these fillings: apple-cinnamon-walnut mixture peanut butter chocolate or more savory taste feta cheese and parsley would be great too. Thanks!

This is the most delicious recipe for Kolacky I've ever made. For those who found the dough 'difficult' to work with I offer a suggestion: It is helpful to form about a generous 'cup' of dough into a 'patty' before refrigerating it. I made three 'fat' patties out of this recipe then wrapped them in plastic wrap before refrigerating. Place them on the counter to soften A BIT before rolling them out. This makes them easy to roll out....hope this helps:D

I would give it 5 stars for taste and 2 for ease if I could. The cookies were delicious. It's just so difficult to work with this dough. I kept it in the fridge for 3 hours took out half and by the time I had crafted 5 or 6 cookies (it takes some practice) it was too soft to work with. I ended up tossing batches in and out of the freezer as I made 4-5 cookies at a time. I went through A LOT of flour just to keep from it sticking to my workspace. All in all the cookies look ok taste great. But the time and labor that went into about 20 cookies (I had to scrap a couple from leaking) could be better spent with something else.

I didn't have a problem with the dough staying chilled but I didn't get them think enough plus I started out using too much filling (hint definitely use a measuring teaspoon instead of eyeballing off of a kitchen spoon). I had to bake them longer because I got the dough too thick and my first dozen or so didn't stay sealed. However ultimately they came out tasting pretty good.

I made this used date filling and ate almost all of them. I put the dough in an oblong shape and cut slices off. next time I will try rolling it out and cutting it would just look better. I never even got the powdered sugar on they were great without it...
