I made this recipe for my son's class.  And it was wonderful.  He has severe food allergies and this recipe is both egg and peanut free.  I added a bag of milk chocolate chips to the batter.  This gave it more of a chocolate taste and less of a cocoa taste.  I made cupcakes instead of the cake and I baked them for 22 minutes @ 350 degrees.

I cut the recipe in half and it fit and 8 x 8 cake pan. I also added a quarter cup of semi sweet choc chips, and a teaspoon of baking powder. I also used Nesquick cocoa instead of unsweetened cocoa..came out very good..

My husband, who is allergic to eggs, has done without sweets for most of his life because, as you know, baking without eggs is a challenge. Now, being the good wife that I am (haha), I've been searching the internet and trying different eggless recipes. This is the best chocolate cake recipe we have found thus far. It is true to it's description and is very moist HOWEVER both my husband and I feel there is something lacking in the flavor; it tastes a bit bland. My husband just doesn't feel it is "chocolatey" (is that a word?) enough. Perhaps next time I will add a few semi-sweet chocolate squares to the batter. This recipe is a definite keeper - it just needs a tad bit of something extra.

It helps to also thoroughly mix the wet ingredients first then add to mixed dry ingredients and combine for about 1 minute.  Pour into cake pans, let sit 5 minutes to let the baking soda start to work then bake about 30-35 minutes for 2 round cake pans

This cake came out moist and chocolately.  I didn't change the recipe at all.  Made for husband who is allergic to eggs and enjoyed it myself more than most cakes!!

We loved this recipe!  My son was recently diagnosed as having an egg allergy and we needed an egg-free birthday cake recipe ASAP.  The whole family loved it and I would highly recommend this recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. This cake tasted just like every cake I've had that is vegan; dry and bland. Couldnt taste chocolate at all, and not sweet enough. I don't understand how it is getting such great reviews. Followed recipe, but added a tiny bit more cocoa, which apparently still wasn't enough.

This was so easy. My daughter loved it. I made a glaze with Green and Black's maya gold dark chocolate which gave it a nice orange flavour.

Thank you sooooo much for this recipe!!!  My brother is allergic to all dairy and eggs and has never been able to have ice cream, cookies, etc.  So when I came across an eggless chocolate cake, I just had to try it.  It is one of the most delicious cakes and my brother was thrilled to have something that involoved chocolate!!!  Thanks!!!

I was looking for a Birthday cake recipe that conformed to my Church'es Lenting Fasting Regulations, and this turned out to be a Winner! It's eggless, milkless, cooks great with olive oil for vegetable oil (for those watching their cholesterol), and goes well with a Coffee Icing. I added a little colored icing and some chocolate sprinkles, and had good results. A tablespoon or two of ground hazelnuts in the batter doesn't hurt anything. I would eat this this cake even if it weren't Lent!

This eggless cake is the best I've made by a mile!  It is tender and moist, but does not taste like an under cooked brownie like most eggless cakes.  My 7 yr old is allergic to eggs so over the years I've tried many  eggless recipes and egg substitutes but none of them were beyond "ok" in flavor or texture.  Normally eggless recipes tend to get overdone on the edges and stay underdone in the center, not with this cake!  This cake rises PERFECTLY, it even came out of the pan without any trouble, which has always been an issue in the past when trying to decorate.  At my son's party this year I made 2 cakes, one regular, the other with this eggless recipe.  Most of the guests actually liked this one better, which is saying a lot.  The only thig I did different was to add about 1/4 cup of Hershey's syrup (we love chocolate).  Definitely worth 5 stars!

I love it! However made that changes: instead 1c. oil  I added 1/2c applesauce & 1/2c oil, instead 3c water - 2c. reduced fat milk + 1c water, plus I added 3/4c milk chocolate chips. I have small kids that's why I made these changes, so it will be healthier for them and attractive with chocolate chips! Almost forgot to mention: I made muffins out of this batter and a lot of them! Thank you for great eggless recipe!

I am a vegetarian but do not eat eggs. I love to bake. Usually my egg substitute works on most baked goods so I have no problem. However, my cakes never have a stable base without eggs and end up breaking. When I saw this recipe I was eager to try it, hoping it would solve my cake baking problem. And boy was it great! I rose up wonderfully and was so rich, chocolaty and fluffy. I added 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips to add a nice crunch. I didn't have a 9x13 in. pan so I baked mine in two pans. One was a 8x11 in. oval pan and the other a 8x8 square baking pan. I filled them 3/4 of the way and baked it for 30 minutes. It rose all the way to the top and was crusty on top and soft and fluffy on the inside. After letting it cool I iced it with chocolate butter cream frosting and white icing. My family was so eager to eat it and were waiting with their plates and forks by my side. They even ate the smaller cake without any icing. My brother even added a piece to ice cream and ate it like a warm brownie. This is a wonderful recipe I will use again!

For those who find the chocolate taste lacking a bit : add 2 teaspoons of instant coffee to 1/2 cup boiling water mix well then add the enough cold water to make up the rest of the three cups need for the recipe....delish and makes is a nice dark chocolate taste with out adding any more cocoa.

I'm sorry but this just wasn't what I was expecting. This is the first eggless cake I have ever made, and I wont be making it again. I baked following the recipe, but it did not have the richness or moisture I was wanting. The center did not completely bake while the edges were burning after one hour in the oven. Perhaps if I had halved the recipe it would have baked better, or if I had done cupcakes, but still the flavour was lacking and I doubt I will make it again.

My husband is allergic to eggs.  I've found in my quick bread recipes that a tbsp of cornstarch mixed with two tbsps of water works well as an egg substiture.  But I never cared for how it worked in cakes, so thought I'd give this one a try.  It's okay.  I took the advice of others and added some chocolate chips to the batter.  Still seems a bit dry to me.  I made the chocolate frosting recipe on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa and it helped.  Hubby isn't home, so we'll see how he likes it tonight.

Such a wonderful cake! i followed the suggestions of using dark chocolate chips (used 1/2 a bag). I also substituted 1c of strong coffee for 1c of water. Makes it even richer with a tint of coffee taste. Next time I'll 1/2 the entire recipe. Makes too much for 2 people! 

topped with homemade chocolate frosting and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and coconut.

I have used a similar recipe and it's one of my favorites because it's a moist cake that is easy and quick to put together.  Some of the other reviewers said the cake was lacking something in flavor.  Try adding about 2 tsps of cider vinegar to the water, oil, and vanilla mixture.

We really liked it, it's easy to make, no egg so batter is safe for kids to lick!
It was moist, and not as crumbly as other cakes, also didn't have that baking soda taste that similar recipes have had. I used the Busy Day Cocoa Icing from this site, and it's a nice quick cake easy to whip up before dinner!
I was testing this recipe for Cupcake Cones and it worked really well. 
What I really liked about it is that it's not overly sweet, so it's great with icing, also that it didn't seem as crumbly as other chocolate cakes.

Thnx Ginger for one perfect eggless chocolate cake!! Loved it! I made 
cupcakes with this recipe, made a hole in between and added chocolate 
ganche right in the middle (got the idea from Starbucks). Served it 
*little* warm (by heating 10-15 secs in a microwave) with 2 scoops of 
Eddy's Grand Fudge Swirl Ice-cream. For Chocolate ganache - followed 
the very basic recipe - Bring 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to boil. Mix 
it with 8 ounces of chocolate chips + 1 tablespoon of Vanilla Extract 
until u get a smooth shiny yummy Chocolate Ganache. (Used 
Ghirardelli's 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips  	 for ganache) Workz great :)(had added 1 teaspoon of vinegar in the cake mixture - just for fun) Cake came out real moist.  
*yum yum yum*

We were craving chocolate cake, but had run out of eggs. I found this recipe on AR and it was lovely (even though I screwed up quite a bit). I skipped sifting the flour, cocoa powder and baking soda and just dumped them into the batter (out of sheer laziness)! Also, not having enough oil on hand, I substituted the oil for slightly salted butter (3/4 cup). I altered the order of a wee bit because I always like to beat the butter and sugar until light, add the essence and then add the flour and liquid (water) alternately into the butter mixture.
This turned out to be quite a HUGE cake, also because I baked it in a 10" round deep cake tin so I'd suggest baking it for a little more than 1 hour but do watch it carefully to prevent burning!
Thanks a lot Ginger for sharing this cake! We didn't find it bland at all ... infact for all the screw ups I made, I thought this was a very forgiving cake! :D

Amazing chocolate cake!! Not too sweet...as per some reviews I added some chocolate chips, and it was wonderful.  Definitely filled that chocolate craving, and so handy to not have to use eggs, milk or butter.  Yay!  all ingredients on hand!  Go for it, you won't be disappointed!

Interesting recipe, could be better. I won't comment on texture or baking time, as I used a round springform, but I had some issues.

The cake is slightly bland. I think it could use more salt. I'm not certain about adding more cocoa, but that probably might help as well.

I think for the next time I might also use milk instead of water. Again this is a taste issue rather than a texture issue.

For this cake I will probably serve the rest with a cocoa whipped cream topping to try to fix the blandness

I'll give this recipe kudos for moistness - but for taste it rang flat for me. A heads up to people who haven't dealt with egg-less cakes before - it seems a trend to me that the batter will seem much more watery than a traditional cake batter. It also might help with lumps to sift the cocoa powder and flour together. 

I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting the recipe in half and baking it for 45 minutes. The cake while extremely moist fell apart out of the pan even after letting it cool for 15 minutes. The chocolate flavor is actually a bit bitter and there isn't much depth of flavor to the cake.

I baked these for my daughter's second birthday. There was a little boy with dairy and egg allergies attending and I wanted him to have something he could eat. These turned out beautifully as cupcakes, the rise was beautiful and the texture was great. I didn't add all the vanilla, only 1tsp and used a strong coffee in place of water. The flavor was delicious and tasted like the conventional devil's food cake recipe I usually use.

This is a great cake, my daughter has egg allergies and now she can enjoy a birthday cake! I took several of the suggestions listed in the review section. Mixing wet ingredients completely and then adding to dry ingredients made a huge difference.  I also added semi-sweet small morsals and they cake was great.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 1st b-day. I made 12 cupcakes and halfed the recipe. I added milk instead of water and about 1/2 pk semi-sweet choco chips. It turned out great. Really light, simple to make and full of flavour.

My son was recently diagnosed with an Egg/Peanut Allergy so finding treats for him has been a challenge! This recipe was great! The best one I've tried!  I added a bag of mini chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar to add taste(this was per someone else's suggestion).  Excellent!

I made this recipe as cupcakes and mini-cupcakes for a party with a little boy who is allergic to eggs- half the recipe made 12 cupcakes and about 18 mini-cupcakes. I added half a bag of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips, and they were so moist- my son and sister and I couldn't stop eating the minis! I'm planning to make some cream cheese frosting to go with these and I'm sure they'll be a hit at the derby party!

Great cake! My son is allergic to milk,  eggs,  peanuts and tree nuts. He was very eager to have a birthday cake for his fourth birthday with Thomas the train on it. I purchased a picture of Thomas from my local grocery store and put it on the top. 

In the words of my oldest son," I don't like the cake, I LOVE IT!" The cake was a hit!  My son got exactly what he wanted.

I did add approx half a cup of Enjoy Life semi -sweet chocolate chips.

Wonderful texture and very moist - it's the kind of cake that makes your teeth look black when you eat it!
I took other's advice and greated 4 squares of dark chocolate into it (in a reduced recipe), but it still could have done with some more to give the flavour some oomph.
I will definately make again!

Not bad, but we prefer "Grandma's Eggless, Butterless, Milkless Cake" recipe from this site better.  It is moister and tastier.

I am extremely happy with this recipe! My daughter has an egg allergy and she wanted a chocolate cake. It came out very moist and the kids in her class were asking for seconds at her class party. (See picture of cake with orange flowers) It was very easy to make also. From start to the finished product...about an hour and a half. I used TWO 10 x 2 inch Wilton round cake pans and baked them at 350 for 45 minutes in a gas range. 

Helpful tip: my Grandmother taught me a cool trick when making a round layer cake. I cut strips of cloth and sewed them end to end (long enough to wrap around cake pan 2 times). I wet them down with water and, without wringing them too much, wrap them around the pans. This will keep the tops of your cakes from forming a dome. They will bake COMPLETELY FLAT. Unfortunately, I was in a rush today and forgot that step. So, my daughter has two single layer cakes for her birthday today. 

Happy Baking! Heather

This was OK.  Had a good taste, but a little dry.  I made cupcakes with this recipe.  The very center was fairly moist, but the tops and sides were down right crispy.  And the batter stuck to the baking cups very badly.  So i recommend if you want cupcakes, just PAM your muffin tins and dont use paper cups.  Maybe a 9x13 cake would keep more moisture better than cupcakes. Probably so.  They definately need to be frosted.  I did mine was store bought vanilla. Tasted good!! :)  I didnt make this due to an egg allergy, its b/c i ran outta eggs.  Bummer!

I think it turned out alright.  I substituted apple sauce for half the oil and put in 2 1/4 c. splenda with 3/4 c. brown sugar and then iced it with a whipped dairy-free chocolate frosting.  I also added a package of semi sweet chips to make the cake richer.

This recipe deserves 5 stars. I halved the recipe and made a minor change. Instead of mixing baking soda in the dry ingredients First I kept it aside and when My batter was ready I mixed the baking soda with equal vinegar and quickly folded in the batter and put it in the oven.  Cut layers and made a black forest cake.

My son has an egg allergy and this recipe has been a blessing! I just made this in a bunny-muffins pan for tomorrow (Easter.) I followed the recipe but added a generous cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips (because that's what was left in the bag.) 22 minutes in my electric oven and they're perrfect! I dipped the bunnies in white chocolate and decorated with jelly beans and chocolate twizzlers cut into strips for whiskers (we don't like black licorice.) They kids all love them! Thanks!

I do not eat chocolate cakes but I made this for a friend who is Vegan and loves chocolate. Made it for her 21st birthday. It was one of the easiest cakes I ever made and she said it was just wonderful. Her friends all enjoyed it. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

Very good and moist.  I didn't have any cocoa powder so I melted semi sweet chocolate chips incorporating the oil in with it as it melted.  I frosted them with peanut butter frosting. Turned out great.

I made this cake for a coworker's child, who has multiple food allergies.  This was his first "real" birthday cake (previously had only had frosted angel food cake), and the family loved it!  It came out just a little dry and I found it to be a little too rich (more like dark chocolate vs. milk chocolate flavoring), but overall, a success for the birthday child and his family!

This cake was unexpectedly delicious! I don't have egg allergies; I was just simply out of eggs but dying for chocolate cake. It was finished baking at 45 minutes and turned out wonderfully moist. I added a glaze on top which consists of 2 tbsp butter, 1/2c sweetened condensed milk, 2/3c semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 3tbsp corn syrup. It's a lot of cake, though! Next time I'll cut the recipe in half.

Completely undrewhelmed. In all fairness I did substitute butter for oil & added 1/2 cup cocoa powder, cake was very dense & chocolately but not at all moist. Will keep searching for a chocolately & moist cake.

I chose this recipe because I needed to make a cake for my egg-intolerant 1-year-old nephew's birthday.  I did a test cake just to check the floavor and was very impressed.  I halved the recipe for the test and when I didn't have enough oil, I made up the difference with Hershey's Syrup.  Fearing it still wouldn't be chocolatey enough (several other reviews), I melted 1/4 cups of choc chips with a little butter and threw that into the mix.  Fabulous...you would never know there aren't eggs.  Can't wait to make this for my nephew next weekend!

I followed this cake exactly and it was awesome. I can't believe I'm saying it but it was. Dense yet very moist. It's even better out of the fridge or after a couple days. It was so good that I couldn't stop eating it even after a belly ache.

Surprisingly delicious. I used this recipe for an easter surprise, and I doubled the chocolate and used milk instead of water... Very rich and delicious. Saved!

AWESOME!   This cake received many compliments.  No one believed it was eggless and dairy free.  I have made many eggless cakes(my 5 yr old son has an egg allergy since 10 months) this one was the best!  I changed nothing.  MAde as is and will make it again and again and again.  Thanks.

After learning my 4 year old is allergic to egg among other things, we weren't sure what he was going to eat. I used this recipe and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and it turned out perfect! He was so excited to know he was still able to have some sweets. Thank you!

I substituted the baking soda for baking powder because it didn't make sense to me to use soda, and the cake turned out pretty dense, so next time I'll either try the soda or add more powder. It tasted very good though, I made it with this Pudding Iicing from this site, which was very good

WONDERFUL!!!  I really wanted chocolate cake, but lacked the important milk/butter/eggs necessary. So I went out on a limb and made this. I used grapeseed oil instead of Veggie and really think it made no difference. It took the entire 40 minutes to cook and I'm considering putting a glaze on it. Possibly lemon but I'm not sure. It'll be fine to eat plain though too. Great Cake!

Greetings from Barmitszpa, the recipe worked fine, up until the part when I put the cake in the oven, then my little son crawled up on a stool and changed the temperature when I wasn't looking. So when I went to check on the cake, it exploded all over my face and i now have 3 degree burns all over my face!! So I liked it, but no I have 3 degree burns, so I give you a 3.

Good recipe. I decided to make this b/c my 4 yr old wanted chocolate cupcakes and I didn't have any eggs. I did decide to change the recipe a bit after reading the reviews. First I halved the recipe so there were only 12 servings. Then I doubled the cocoa powder and vanilla. Also since I love chocolate orange I replaced the water with orange juice, added a tsp of orange extract and the zest of one orange.  Overall a good recipe to start with and tinker with. The texture was dense but nice which may have been because I doubled the cocoa.

This was my first time experiment in baking something. And I am really thrilled... It came out really well... Chocolaty,spongy,moist. After reading the reviews I did some slight alterations to the recipe. I used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil.I used the measurements for serving 8 persons.I added half cup of semi sweet milk choco chips to it. Also I added 1oz semi sweet dark chocolate square. I also added some walnuts and cashew in it. It really tasted yummy

This recipe seriously amazed me! I am not allergic to eggs, nor am I a vegan- My only excuses are that it's 10:30 at night, I have no eggs, and I had a craving. So I decided to try this eggless recipe. I made it into cupcakes rather than a whole cake, and they came out so moist and yummy- A perfect snack! They didn't even need icing. These actually came out way better than the last chocolate cupcake recipe I tried on here, which DID use eggs. I have an aunt and cousins who are vegans so I'll definitely be sharing this recipe, and using it again!

Good vegan cake recipe. Almost all eggless baked goods have some sort of textural issues so you have to work a little harder to compensate. I used 2 nine inch cake pans and made a layer cake. The tops and edges get quite crispy and chewy so I would recommend leveling the top as usual and also going around the outer edges with a bread knife to remove that part as well. A rich frosting is a must to boost the flavor. The inside was very moist and it held together nicely. Don't forget to let it cool in the pan and whatever you do, don't overbake it.

This is a great recipe! I recently hosted a birthday party and one of the guests has life-threatening allergies to eggs and soy (and happens to be a very picky eater, too!). I scaled down the recipe to serve 6, used canola oil and made it into cupcakes. It turned out fabulous, and he ate every bite!! I'll definitely be making this again!

I did alter this slightly and added about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter. I usually don't rate recipes I alter, but in this case I wanted to. My mother is allergic to eggs and I personally do not like chocolate, but I ate a piece anyway because it was her birthday. The chocolate chips I added created little pockets of gooey chocolate, which was a pleasant surprise. this cake was thick! Not dry, just a thick cake when cooked in a standard cake pan. The rise was good and the texture was fantastic. Will definitely make this for my mother again :)
I do however wish there was a suggestion for what type of icing to use. I just used plain whipped cream and we liked it just fine.

Very moist. I have added another half a cup of extra red cocoa powder, and instead of all purpose flour, i used half all purpose and half almond meal. I made the salt to 1 1/8 tsp to enhance the chocolatey flavour. I lessened the sugar but replaced it with semisweet chocolate shavings. It was soooo good! It wasn't sweet at all and it was chocolatey goodness! My grandma loves it! Everybody loved it.

Not very spongy but definitely moist! Very chocolatey.

Bake it for full 1-Hr as it tends to remain a tad bit undercooked  at the bottom. Make sure to blend the mixture well with a hand mixer to avoid lumps.

Delicious! Scaled it to 2 servings, mixed it in a large coffee cup, and cooked it in the microwave for 90 seconds. Topped it with some quartered strawberries.

I make chocolate cakes from scratch frequently and this was one of the best even vs egg containing. I followed the recipe but also added 3 oz of melted semisweet baking chocolate to boost the chocolate flavor. Baking in 8" rounds, bake for 35 minutes. In cupcake tins, 22 - 25 minutes, made 36 cupcakes. Topped with chocolate ganache, it was a hit with my daughter who has egg allergies as well as the rest of the family.

We have a new member in our family with severe allergies to eggs. Excellent recipe, rises well but you can tell there is something missing. But who cares it's chocolate !!!! and there were NO leftovers. I didn't change a thing to the recipe.

I baked this for school camp as a child had an egg allergy. All the kids loved it and my son has demanded it for his junior school graduation. The first time I added chocolate chips, this time I have added 1Tbsp dried coffee powder. An absolute winner of a cake, thank you!

I made this cake recently and used half real sugar and half splenda.  Still turned out great (moist and chocolaty).  And it's nice that it's lower in fat.  I recommend AAA+++!

Um... it tasted good, but you can tell it's different from your average cupcake.  The texture is a little softer.  I did add the chocolate chips, but I don't think it was absolutely necessary.  Get a good frosting on there and you won't notice the cake is a little different.  I also added a tsp of instant espresso powder but not sure if that really added anything.  Good if you have an egg allergy; if not, stick with a traditional recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! I'm new to the world of eggless baking, and most of the recipes I've tried haven't worked out, but this one certainly did! I made it for my boyfriend's roommate (who is allergic to eggs) for his birthday, and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, but added some milk chocolate chips on  the advice of other reviewers. This has definitely become a new favorite recipe!

The cake rises beautifully, has a lovely texture, and looks wonderful--but it's taste is quite bland.  Next time around, I'll probably incorporate other flavors.

Update: The chocolate used really affects the taste! Invest in some quality chocolate.

Amazing! I am allergic to eggs, dairy, soy, and wheat, so this cake was perfect. I used rice flour instead of wheat flour and it still came out great, moist and so flavorful!!!!!!

SUPER MOIST, DELICIOUS CAKE, I AM SO EXCITED I FOUND ONE WITHOUT EGGS!  WHEW HOO!  BUT LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS SAID, IT SEEMS TO BE MISSING SOMETHING, IT'S BLAND FOR SOME REASON.  NEXT TIME I MAKE THIS, I WILL DEFINITELY ADD A CUP OF CHOCOLATE CHIPS, OR MELT CHOCOLATE AND DRIZZLE IT ON TOP ONCE IT COOLS.

This cake is a god-send!  My 4 year old son has food allergies and this was the first cake I made for him.  He LOVES it!  He was so happy to be able to eat eggless, nut-free chocolate cake! The cake itself reminds me of a brownie texture but it's still cake-like too.  This recipe makes a lot of cake! I can usually get a double layer 10 x 2 round cake, plus enough to make a dozen cupcakes to freeze and two 3 x 1 round layers as well.  While it is very chocolately I do find the vanilla scent to be overpowering, but that's because I don't care for vanilla.  Now...if I could only find an equivilant in a yellow cake...

Will definitely add chocolate chips next time, as they came out fine but lacking sweetness. I made up for it last time by using mocha frosting and vegetarian friends  loved them.

This cake is so good! It is moist and delicious. My son is allergic to eggs and this cake was perfect for his 1st birthday party. For his 2nd birthday party I'm using the same recipe but making cupcakes instead. There's a lot of batter! I got 38 cupcakes. I read the other reviews and used less sugar, added semi-sweet mini chocolate chips and subbed applesauce for half of the oil. YUMMY!!!

I was planning to take cupcakes to my daughter's school for her birthday, but there's a friend who is allergic to eggs. So, I found this recipe and made it right away. It is delicious!! I couldn't believe that it was so good without eggs in it. I used milk instead of water and added a little bit of baking powder as well as the baking soda that is required in the recipe. Great moist and chocolaty. I made cupcakes and it took about 20 minutes to cook. try it, it works!!

I made this only because I didn't have any eggs on hand.  It was wonderful!  Like some others, I halved the recipe, using an 8 x 8 pan and baking for about 45 minutes.  I then used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze that was posted by Ginger, and then topped it with chopped pecans.  It was a hit, and I will definitely make it again, even if I have a refrigerator-full of eggs!

Delicious cake!  Great to know you don't need eggs or dairy to make a tasty cake.  It was even better with a coconut-flake vegan frosting that I quickly made (sugar, earth balance margarine, vanilla and coconut flakes).

I tried the regular recipe and made a test batch of cupcakes to check for dryness.   They were dry and tasteless, as reported in some other reviews.  So I added eveything I could think of to improve the flavor & texture with some improvement, but not enough to consider this good.

Was looking for another recipe on this site similar to this one when I stumbled across this. Was making it for a potluck. Have to say it was quite dense and took so long to cook it was just a tad too dry when done. Probably won't make it again.

I made cupcakes of this. I think it was a mistake to put water in them because you could really taste it. Or better said: you didn't taste! Try it with milk, it must be better.

I made this for my 6 year old's (she and her sister and cousin have egg and dairy allergies)birthday and served it alongside a "box" cake.  This one was devoured - no one knew the difference and all three of the girls felt like she got to have the same thing as everyone else at the party.  This will be my "go-to" chocolate cake recipe from now on!!!

Surprisingly Good.  My son is allergic to eggs so I am constantly looking for baked goods that can be made without. I added about 4 ounces of chocolate chips and 1 TBSP of baking powder to the recipe.

This recipie is awesome.  It came out moist and rich and everyone loved it.  I made it into cupcakes which only took about 30-40 min to cook.  I will definately make these again even if there was no one with an egg allergy here

Not sweet enough to stand on its own. Tasted better with some frosting on top. I might add chocolate chips next time like others suggested.

Definitely a recipe to experiment with. I'll certainly bake it again. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate powder, so I used Nesquick instead, and I ran out of vanilla after the first spoon, so I substituted it for Spanish "Licor 43". I also didn't add the baking soda and salt because I used self-rising flour. Once all ingredients were mixed, it didn't look right. It was very watery. The end result was a pleasant surprise.

This cake turned out moist and chocolatey and not too sweet. It was perfect frosted with chocolate icing. I also added some baking powder because I wasn't sure how it would rise without eggs. My next project is to try and make a chocolate layer cake using this recipe.

This cake was not as good as I had hoped.  I mixed thorougly as the recipe suggested but the cake was tough.  Any suggestions on how long is long enough for mixing?  It had a nice flavor, not too sweet, so I may experiment with it again.

I'm a home baker. One of my customers asked for an eggless chocolate cake and I used this recipe. The feedback was great. Truly it tastes great eventhough it's eggless. This is the best eggless chocolate cake I ever had.

My first ever chocolate cake and do I love it! I tweaked the recipe from the reviews and added 1 cup of instant coffee (Nescafe) adjusted for 8 servings. It's a little too sweet for my taste but I think unsweetened whipped cream would take care of that. And the ingredients are so simple, available in anyone's pantry. Thanks for this wonderful and easy recipe!

I used coffee in place of water and halved the recipe 

(I tied coffee grounds in a filter and put it in water after it had finished coming to a boil, dunked it around a bit until it "brewed" enough) 

so it was technically a devil's food cake but it brought out the chocolate flavor. However, it did still have a bit of a bland taste to it; adding the chocolate chips is a definite must. I'll maybe try adding more sugar next time but I did like it! 
Made it for a friend who is allergic to eggs.

My son has severe egg allergies and I have been making this cake for a few years. One reviewer stated that it didn’t have any flavor, but the secret to any amazing chocolate cake is to replace the water with very strong coffee or espresso. I use this cake in my annual ice-cream cake recipe with homemade whipped cream frosting, always a hit!

I did not care for this recipe. I was so thrilled by the look of it. I thought omg it’s normal. Then we dig into it and everyone had his look that one sees in the movies only except it was real life and for something I’ve baked. It tasted like butter flour. So much sugar yet it wasn’t even sweet. The icing couldn’t even help it.

I took it out about 10 minutes early and the entire shell of the cake is hard. The inside is soft and has a really good flavor. If I use the recipe again I will be checking it at 30 minutes. It was made in a 9 x 13 pan.

Hi, firsly thanks for the recipe. I've never made eggless cake before. It's night time, I don't have eggs at home and still wanna bake something  for my kids without going out to get the eggs.

The cake texture is ok, moist. However it lacks flavour. The taste is too plain for my liking. Not chocolatey enough.

I don't think I will use the recipe again, but if I did, I'd probably do what others said they did, add choc chips to enhance the taste.

This was great! I forgot I ran out of eggs, but had promised the kids we would make cake. This came through & didnt disappoint. The kids we were watching even commented on how tasty they were. We made cupcakes though. (Easier to share) Approx 15 minutes.

We serve this cake at every birthday celebration at the preschool where I work. I cut the recipe by one third because we have to bake it in a crock pot and the full recipe overflows! We accidentally used baking powder instead of soda and it made the cake even taller. Sometimes we add chocolate chips. I decorate it with icing sugar sifted over a stencil designed by the child and serve it with fresh berries.  5 stars!

Texture resembled a brownie. Hard on the outside and soft inside. 
It rose double the batter, so be prepared for that. I had to use 2 round cake pans, about 9 inches across, because the recipe makes a lot of batter. 
I substituted brown sugar for white. 
Also, I put this on top: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8436/shiny-chocolate-glaze/ without it, the cake may have been to dry.

I had an eggless cake order and I found this recipe. After reading the comments and the ingredient list, I decided to make a few tweaks that resulted in a rich, moist cake with depth of flavor. Here are the changes: reduce flour to 4-1/4 cups, replace 3 cups water with 1.5 cups strong coffee and 1.5 cups buttermilk (if you don't have buttermilk you can pour one and a half cups of regular, room temperature milk and add a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice, let it sit until it curdles) add 2 tsp salt, add 1 tsp baking powder, add an additional 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. I also added 1/2 cup more sugar, but this is to taste.  Bake at 345 degrees and keep an eye on the cake. You want to pull it out as soon as it's cooked through and the toothpick comes out clean. Bake time will depend on the size of the pan and how much batter you use.

I read the comments and followed several hacks. My husband and I devoured this cake, and without icing. It was very chocolaty, dense but rose enough to be a true cake, and was moist. Below are all the hacks I used. 
cut the recipe in half (except for vanilla because I love it)
used coconut oil
replaced half the water with coffee
added 1 cup chocolate chips
added baking soda last after mixing it with apple cider (equal amount)

This recipe is awesome. However, i made some changes for it to taste better according to me. Instead of 3 cups of water, I added 2 cups of milk, and 1 cup of water. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup. I also added some baking powder. I later cut the cake in half, and added some melted white chocolate and sprinkles. After that, it tasted even better!

I tried making this cake and after having it in the oven for an hour, I checked it with a cocktail stick and the cake collapsed on itself. It was entirely liquid inside.

I scaled this back to half and it made one layer of a 9 in round cake.  It was moist and super chocolaty and the top was crust was crisp- almost like a brownie.  I didn't even put frosting on it.  I'll make it again!

Not very chocolaty, and a bit dry, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 and  would use one cup of boiling water plus the 2 other cups of water, the boiling water releases more chocolaty flavour. I also added a bit of baking powder to puff it up a little bit (though I'm not sure it helped much), and I reduced the vanilla by 1/2. I also added about an extra 1/8 cup of cocoa just for good measure. After that it became much more chocolaty, and adding a bit more oil would probably help with the dryness.

I needed an eggless chocolate cake for a little girl who is allergic to eggs. I tried this cake with a few adjustments and the result was a cake that tasted just like a regular chocolate cake with eggs. I used cake flour instead of AP flour. Instead of water I subbed for coffee and 2% milk, more milk of course. Don't over bake this, forget the time given, just test the cake with a skewer every 5 minutes after the first 25 minutes.

was well received by all, nobody believed it was eggless for sure.  I used melted butter instead of oil, used a mixture of milk and water instead of all water.  Surely a keeper.

This cake was AMAZING.  I'm a big brownie fan, so having a nice, dense chocolate cake was perfect.  The only alteration I made, since it was my first time making it (and always follow the recipe) was to change one tablespoon of the plain vanilla extract to some vanilla butter nut that I had.  My only "criticism" (ha!) is that it very nearly took over the 13x9 pan, and I almost didn't have room to frost it in the pan!  :)  Thanks for the great recipe - we'll definitely be using it again!!

Nice and moist....if in hurry its a good one cause basic ingredients most will have in cupboard but it lacked in flavour. Was hoping it would be more like the no egg cake recipe that I lost and it didn't come up to par.

This is the first time I'm making an eggless cake. My son needed for school and I didn't have any eggs. I quartered the recipe as I was not sure how it will turn.. It was very soft and very flavorful. I added extra dark chocolate pieces to it following some of the reviews. 

This is a keeper

The only thing I did off recipe was changed it to 2 tbsp vanilla and 1 tbsp chocolate syrup.... gave it a little more chocolate kick.  Otherwise, definitely a nice "soft" texture, great for cupcakes!

I wanted to make the batter "fuller" so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 cups of rolled oats, 50 g of slivered almonds and grated two sour green apples, and as previous comments suggested, chocolate chips. The cake was delicious, I love this simple recipe!

I found this recipe years ago and have been making it for nearly every family gathering since.  The cake is delicious very moist and chocolatey - perfect for frosting for birthdays.  My extended family now requests this so often I've gotten the responsibility of making it for nieces' and nephews' birthday cakes.  In fact, I will be making it tonight.  One recipe easily makes 26 cupcakes and they are wonderful.

I loved this recipe because I'm lactose intolerant and have to be very careful with desserts.  I was very surprised how this cake looked and tasted like a regular chocolate cake. I didn't tell hubby that the cake was eggless and he loved it. It's a hit with my family. I'm not telling because I know he will not believe me.  I'm definitely making this recipe again this week.

This was a wonderful recipe..I made a few changes however. I halved the recipe and baked it for 35 mins in an 8x8 pan.  Here are the other changes: 1 cup of sugar. 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of coffee. A splash of coffee extract with a splash of vanilla extract. I also made a warm ganache that I poured on the cake the moment it came out of the oven (I poked holes in the cake first). The ganache seeped into the cake and made it AMAZING. I think this is my new fav chocolate cake.

This is a great recipe. I make it for our Preschool where there are a few kids with allergies. My suggestion is to cut the cocoa to 1/2 cup & add a box of chocolate pudding. Turned out very moist. Once, I had to use gluten free flour for one child, I added a little orange juice to kick in some flavor.  It does make a lot of cupcakes, so if it's just for home use I suggest halving it, I still got 24 regular cupcakes.

I tried this recipe. The only ingredient I skipped is the vanilla extract. The cake turned out moist but the cake smells of soda and tastes bitter. I am not sure what went wrong. I used TJ's baking soda and I used a glass container to bake the cake. I have done eggless cakes before and had good results. Since most of you had good results, I am assume I did something wrong here.

I made this recipe for my son's birthday party.  It's a great recipe!  I only made changes because I couldn't resist, but here's what they were: added a box of instant chocolate pudding, added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, substituted chocolate soy milk for the water, substituted canola oil (only because I didn't have vegetable oil).  The batter was poured into a 9x13 glass dish, and took almost 1.5 hours to cook on 350 degrees, with my oven on the convection heating setting.  Next time, I may leave the baking powder out and add 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it more moist.  I will also investigate adding a heating core (Google Wilton heating core), as I felt it took way to long to cook through the center.  My version ended up tasting a little like a brownie.  With icing, I felt it was great and the guests at the party did not know the difference. Thank you for the recipe!

My daughter has a bad allergy to eggs, so for her 2nd birthday party, I had to baker her her own batch of cupcakes. I added chocolate chips to the recipe as people suggested and these came out great! Others ate some just to taste the difference and they liked these just as much as the others. Thanks!!

This was good! I doing a little party for my daughter's birthday and have a kids that have food allergies. I wanted to make just one batch of cupcakes. This fit the bill! I think the key is using good quality cocoa powder. I halved the recipe and made cupcakes. Very moist and held together pretty well. I added a little peppermint extract for fun and they taste a little like a peppermint paddy :)

i too cut the recipe in half and added 1/2 tsp baking powder as suggested by another viewer as well as 1/2 sour cream and it turned out wonderfully..not too sweet, rised beautifully and is scrumptious..made choc sour cream frosting substituting unsweetened cocoa rather than semi sweet choc chips in the frosting.  it's a great cake!

Amazing. I have been searching for years for an eggless cake recipe that wasn't dense and that didn't fall flat or become chewy. A small part in the middle did not bake properly, but that may be my oven. The taste is well-balanced and it is very moist and fluffy.

I cut the portion of this recipe way back and made it for 6 rather than 24.  I followed the recipe exactly however I added 1 tablespoon of PB2 Chocolate Peanut Butter powder. I made 4 large cupcakes and 7 mini cupcakes. They were WONDERFUL!!! The cupcake bake time was about 40 minutes. Halfway through the baking process I pulled the muffin pan out and dropped a spoonful of peanut butter into the center of one of the cupcakes. HOLY COW!!!! It was the perfect addition to the cupcake. I did not ice or frost them. I am in LOVE with this recipe!

Not having eggs in the house, I baked this cake for Valentine's Day.  It is an easy, quick and tasty cake.  I found, however, that it stuck to the pan, therefore, I will grease and flour the bottom the next time.

A delicious cake indeed. Very moist and chocolatey. The only thing I did was substitute one cup of water for warm, strong brewed coffee. Coffee will bring out the rich chocolate flavor. I will defintely try this recipe again!

VERY nice, moist, and chocolatey cake. A couple of adjustments here and there, though. I quartered the recipe as the original had too big of a yield. Instead of  using all unsweetened cocoa, I did half-coca, and half- hot chocolate mix. I also cut down the sugar by maybe an ounce or two, since my hot cocoa mix was sweetened. For the water, I was iffy about it, so I did half-water and half-milk. Definitely used maybe half of the amount of vanilla that was called for. And for the oil, I did half-melted butter and half-oil. As you can tell, I really like to do half-and-half for everything. Lastly, I mixed 1 tbsp. flax seed powder with 3 tbsp. warm water to substitute an egg. It held the cake together very well. That, I think, is a MUST.With all of these modifications, the cake turned out FANTASTIC. Now I just need to find a good frosting...

This cake was really good.  I also cut it in half and used an 8x8 pan, and cut the time to 50 minutes.  I added some chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was by far the best "eggless" cake recipe that I have tried. I halved the recipe and made 18 cupcakes. I did use 1/2 the amount of oil, and the other half I used applesauce. I added about 7 or 8 chocolate chips to each cupcake before I put them in the oven. My entire family loved these, not just the one who has an egg allergy. Thank you Ginger P. for a definite keeper.

Most excellent recipe.  I made cupcakes out of the batter on a day when we were very low on supplies, ie, no butter, no eggs, no milk.  I was totally blown away with the results.  I also added chocolate chips and a small amount of vinegar as one reviewer suggested and this worked really well. I shared them with some of the kids at our local school and several of them wanted the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.  This recipe will now replace my much  more expensive recipe that I have been using for years.  We don't have food allergies in our home but we definitely know what tastes good.  Something else I noticed was that the ones that got left in the lunch box at school for almost a week were still very edible when they were found.  This must be because of the lack of dairy and other ingredients that rot really easily.  Kia ora

Excellent recipe. I added just a *tad* more oil, salt and baking soda than the recipe asked for. I made this for some friends who have kids with allergies, and these were a massive hit! Honestly? Compared to cake made with eggs & dairy, I think the flavour is lacking just a tiny little something. However, it's pretty darn close and about as good as you're likely to get with vegan baking. I made this as cupcakes and they were really, really yummy. The texture was absolutely perfect. Moist, tender and light. I also loved it that all the ingredients were things that I already had - no need to go out and buy a bunch of specialist products. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and was a bit skeptical about it since I've never done a cake like this. I was blown away by the flavor. It was so moist and full of flavor that I doubt I will ever make another boxed cake mix again. My father had a slice with his morning coffee today and had the same opinion as me. His only complaint was that he could taste the cocoa powder, which we both agree would probably be remedied by some frosting, my thinking would be some homemade cream cheese frosting. The next time I make this, I will try using applesauce instead of the oil and see how that tastes, as I know that it is a common subsitute for oil.

This was very good. I have made this twice, both times I halved the recipe. The 1st time I made a 9x13 cake no problems the 2nd time I made 24 cupcakes, but bcse. of not having eggs they did not rise very well, but they were still good. I think for cupcakes I will make as written next time. The cake was enjoyed by all. Thank you for posting!

I honestly expected this cake to come out horrible. Not because of the recipe, but because I didn't have most of the things it called for. But somehow, it still turned out to be not bad at all! I cut the recipe in half since I was low on flour, used butter instead of veg. oil (I was out), light brown sugar instead of white (also out), and left out the vanilla (again...out). I did add an extra 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa, but everything tasted fine. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't say it was the best cake we ever had, but at 10 at night, using an unreliable dorm room stove and wishy washy ingredients, it more than took care of our chocolate cravings. I'll definitely try it again when I have everything.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever made. I didn't have eggs so thought that this recipe would be a substitute for my regular recipe, but this will be my regular one now.  I added a cup of chocolate chips and made it in 2 cake pans but other than that I did not change the recipe at all and it was perfect.

This cake was yummy. My little boy is having a birthday party and one of the children cant have eggs. I didnt want him to feel left out so Im making this. I added 1/2 bag of milk chocolate chips to my trial run, and used a chocolate buttercream icing. It was perfect

This was delicious. The only change I made after reading other reviews was I added 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. It was "chocolate-ee" enough for my gang! Thanks for such a great recipe.

My son is allergic to eggs so I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe to turn into cupcakes for Thanksgiving since every pie we made had eggs in it!  If you are planning to make cupcakes from this, it will make approximately 40 regular size cupcakes.  It is A LOT of batter! For the cupcakes, they only need about 25 minutes in the oven.   I iced them with basic cream cheese icing but I actually like them plain.  I did sub milk for the water and added the choc chips but I will not add the chips next time.  I think they are moist enough without.  I will probably make his birthday cake out if this in the Spring!!

I made this cake according to the serving size of 24 at home and it turned out really great,we all luved it. I used this recipe to bake an eggless cake of about 4 servings for a test at school. However, when I reduced all the ingredients accordingly and baked the cake, the batter turned out very very dry and the cake had a really dense texture. So just a suggestion, if you're not baking this recipe according to 24 servings, you might want to add some liquid to the batter like milk

This cake was "missing something", and not just the eggs. We added nearly a 3/4 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, but the flavor was still flat. The chips were good and gooey and gave it a dark chocolate flavor to this cake. It was moist too. It didn't need as much time as listed.

I was craving for something chocolatey so i decided to give this recipe a try since im allergic to eggs.

I halved the recipe, substitute the water with milk, add chunks of chocolate and made it as cupcakes instead. It turned out GREAT! Moist, fluffy and yummy! Very easy to make. Will definitely make this again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was really easy to make.  I substituted, olive oil for vegetable oil and also added coffee as suggested by 2 other reviewers.  Instead of making a whole cake, I baked them into cupcakes but only had it in the fan oven for 20 minutes.

This made very moist cupcakes, that are surprisingly tasty!  There have a bit of a "glaze" to them, which make it easy to frost and fun to eat.  My son has egg and milk allergies and this was perfect for his b-day!

Pretty good. I was surprised that a cake made without butter and without eggs can turn out soo good.  It does need icing to set it off though.
