Absolutely fantastic! Perfect for fresh breakfast syrup. We skipped the canning part and used immediately. Fresh squeezed lemon made the difference for a refreshing but not overly sweet syrup. We also used frozen blueberries and kept the strained berries on the side when serving. Will definitely make again!

This syrup came out perfectly. The vanilla added a very nice flavor. I've also substituted strawberries for the blueberries. Both syrups were a hit with family and friends.

Not too sweet, which I really liked. Easy to make. I would just like to use something other than Karo syrup, but otherwise a great recipe.

Nice! Very easy to make and this thickens up beautifully. I only got one 1/2 pint jar out of this, but that was fine for us. I plan to use this over waffles and ice cream for the kids. Thanks for sharing. :)

8.18.18  Needed some blueberry syrup for a recipe, and after stopping at three stores and finding none, I searched AR and this recipe came up.  I strained just enough syrup that I needed for my recipe and then mashed the blueberries to make what I suppose really is a blueberry sauce.  I didn’t think the syrup had all that much blueberry flavor, and I just couldn’t see discarding the blueberries considering how expensive they are.  I scaled this down to 12 servings, but don’t think you’ll have enough to serve over waffles or pancakes because the yield is small.   I ended up with 3 oz (the container is marked) of the blueberry “sauce,” so you’d have even less than if you strained into syrup.  You might have enough for a small dollop over ice cream or a slice of pound cake. It tasted  fine, and this served a purpose today, but I won’t make this again.
