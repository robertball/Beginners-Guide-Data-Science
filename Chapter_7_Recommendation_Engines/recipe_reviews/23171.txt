I use white flour in this recipe and I also add a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  This is great served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Very good for a last-minute dessert w/ few ingredients. I only had one can of cherry pie filling so I used that & a can of blueberry pie filling. Also, I only had about 1/4 c. of pecans so I filled the rest of the cup with slivered almonds & chopped walnuts. I love that the topping is so nutty. We ate it up by the next afternoon.

I LOVE this recipe!  So simple, easy, and incredibly delicious!  The pecans add an extra something that makes it wonderful.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the topping...made it really good.

This was very good warm from the oven, with some Kirkland vanilla ice cream on top. I added a dash of cinnamon to the topping before sprinkling on the cherries, and used regular unbleached flour. Also only used about 1/3 cup chopped pecans, may leave them out next time. Delicious!!!

I didn't have cherry pie filling - but had three cans of cherries - so I made my own filling (recipe usually on the cans!).  This way you can avoid the artifical colors that are in pre-made fillings.  The topping came out great!!  Thanks!!

OMG! Someone stop me from eating the whole thing myself!!
I made my own filling, and then topped vanilla ice cream on top. I was licking the bowl clean afterwards. Going to try this recipe with peaches...

Didn't like the whole wheat flour. Made quite a lot too. I'd recommend halving the recipe. Good though.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL! Added a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg and the family gobbled it all up. This will be a holiday staple!

I gave it 5 stars because it is what it is...easy and we were camping.  Maybe it was that I thought there was too much of the canned pie filling (used blueberry) and that the focus was on that?  Or else I was thinking it needed a crust made of the same topping ingredients.  It WAS perfect for camping having few ingredients, easeof making and taste, though, so I will make it again for on the road.  Thanks!

This was VERY, VERY Good!  I used white flour and added 1 cup of fresh blueberries to the mix as well.  I didn't have any nuts but added a tiny amount of cinnamon to the topping as well.  The recipe is very flexible to do with it what you want!  Tastes great warmed up with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on it!!! YUM!

This is very, very good. Not too sweet. I used Lite Cherry Pie Mix, but that's the only change that I made. I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

This is such a great recipe!  So easy and so tasty.  I don't like to use too much sugar so I used a lightend cherry pie filling.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  It was fantastic served warm with vanilla ice cream.  My hubby is already asking for another one.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I'm not a dessert person and always end up buying something overpriced and tasteless when I entertain. This was sooo simple and yummy. I served it warm over vanilla ice cream and my guests raved enough that I gave them the leftovers. I had only used one can of filling so I have extra topping to make another one soon. I'd like to try it with apple filling as well. Thanks!

Very simple to make, but  a little too sweet.  Next time, a little less sugar or light cherry pie filling.

The pecans make a difference. Don't leave them out! Also, I used my own sour cherry pie filling with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. This is a great addition to the lunchbox when you bring your own lunch to work.
