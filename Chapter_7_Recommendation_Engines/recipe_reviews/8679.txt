EXCELLENT! But not a 5 star recipe due to so many changes needed. 1st, if you're not going to use bone-in chicken then don't complain if you end up with a dish that's just "okay". Half the flavor of any dish calling for bone-in chicken comes from the bones. I did this: bought a chicken cut up from the grocery & removed skin, sprinkled w/ kosher salt, pepper, & paprika before browning. For sauce I added 3 cloves of garlic minced; 1 & 1/2 cup wine, 2 8oz boxes chicken broth, 1 & 1/2 cups water mixed with chicken stock base, 1 cup fat free sour cream, 1 tbspn Olivio (butter sub). Put LOADS more paprika in than called for, both Hungarian paprika & HOT Hungarian paprika (probably 1/4 cup paprika total). Added more salt & pepper. When chicken was done, I removed, de-boned & returned to pan after letting the liquid cook down to 1/2. Still had several cups of liquid & would NEVER recommend reducing to what this recipe says. Mixed a few tablespoons of flour with the liquid from the pan & added to sauce to thicken. Served over noodles. STELLAR! Restaurant quality! Company worthy!

This is a very good recipe, and this is a Hungarian talking.  I personally like lots of sauce, so I increase the liquid.  HUNGARIAN paprika must be used to get the true taste, or bland is an understatement.  I also would never use boneless/skinless chicken breasts (to decrease cooking time as some have done) because the skin and cooking time is essential to meld the final flavor of "paprikas" (the Hungarian spelling of what is pronounced "paprikash").  Overall, this is the only recipe that I've ever had that can compare to the family recipe.

Very good, flavorful.

There are a couple of things I would note. The sauce you are to make at the very end from drippings will require a lot more than is suggested in the recipe.  You will need to add more wine, more paprika, more oil.  Also, you will probably need to add a more salt and pepper than you would think.  Other than that everything should be very delicious.

if you are using american paprika, don't bother.  american paprika might as well be called bland.  hungarian paprika is what you want to use for anything that is a paprikash (obviously, that is a hungarian word).

This was delicious.  My husband and son devoured it.  I followed others advice and doubled the wine and chicken broth.  I love spicy food so was going to add cayenne as suggested, but once I tasted my sauce no extra spices were necessary. WOW it was spicy.  I made sure I got Hungarian half-sharp paprika(spicy) not a sweet paprika and it hit the spot.  I had added a tad(tsp) more than the TBLS in the recipe. Will make this again and again!!

This recipe is really easy and delicious. To save time, I deboned the chicken and cut it up into pieces before cooking. This cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes.

I'll admit I was skeptical about this one. But after one bite, I couldn't stop eating! I served this with dumplings. Delicious! My husband is excited there is leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Didn't care for this but Dh thought it was Ok.  Not enough depth of flavor for my palate.  Would definitely add some additional spices if making again.

This recipe is a good start.  I have been to Hungary several times and actually watched how this dish is prepared though it varies greatly from cook to cook.  It is best cooked with a whole cut up chicken with the skin on or at the very least bone-in chicken breasts with the skin still attached.  Add several cloves of garlic while cooking the onions-and you can even use a red onion for additional color and  flavor.  You may also use bacon drippings instead of lard or olive oil.  The bacon drippings add additional smokey favor to this dish.  Use 2 cups of diced onion.  I used nearly 1/4 cup of regular hungarian szeged paprika and a little hot paprika to taste.  Be sure to salt and pepper the chicken while browning- sprinkled with a little smoked paprika.  Be sure not to burn the paprika because it will become bitter.  I also used 12 ounces of chicken broth and added a little saffran to help layer the flavor and enhance the color of the sauce.  The equivalent of one medium diced sweet green pepper should also be added.  You will probably want to add more sour cream and a dollop on the plate when serving.  This dish should be started in a skillet then transferred to a heavy pot to finish cooking ( approx 1 hour).  It can be served still on the bone but usually is deboned. Always serve with hearty homemade noodles or spaetzle  ( never italian pasta). This is a hearty fall/winter dish and should be served with crusty bread.

This was excellent!  We'd gone to Budapest recently and I had a wonderful Chicken Paprikash, which I wanted to try to replicate.  This was a bit different, but lovely all the same.  Here's what I used: 2 ckn breasts, 1 tbl sweet paprika, 1/2 hot paprika, 1/2 c wine, 1/2 c water, 1 c sour cream, extra sour cream, a pinch of garlic powder, and as per the recipe olive oil, and onion.  I followed the recipe until #2, when I found it unnecessary to remove the chicken to boil it down.  Instead, I left the ckn in to desired thickness, then added the sour cream and a bit of flour to thicken, and even more wine and water if desired.  Over spaetzle, this was great!  Can't wait to share with others!

This is really very good!  I added more wine, broth and sour cream at the end (after removing the chicken) and let it reduce to make more sauce.  I also used more onion.  Next time I will even make more sauce and serve over green beans or egg noodles.

Great recipe.  I used lowfat sour cream and added mushrooms to bulk up the meal.  Chicken base with reduced salt added to the flavor as I used chicken tenderloins.  Added to my recipe box and will use again for sure.

I recently tried chicken paprikash at a Hungarian restaurant in Key West and decided I'd like to try making it at home. I substituted chopped up pieces of chicken breast for the whole chicken. Also, I used alot more spices than recommended and more chicken broth as I wanted more sauce. They came out great! I decided to use an allrecipes dumplings recipe at the last minute, to mimic the knedily that accompany the stew and they were also delicious. So easy to make, and so good.

I was looking for a different way to cook chicken, and found this recipe. I cook for myself, and often, things taste all right, but not always notable. This is a really good recipe. While making it, I found that the sour cream I had on hand was questionable. So, I substituted a little grated parmesean cheese, and it still came out well. I did follow some of the other reviewer's suggestions of adding garlic, extra paprika, cayenne pepper, and a bit more wine than the recipe calls for. The aroma rising from the cooking process is truly unique, and somehow comforting.

Ok...for everyone out there that thinks this recipe is a little bland....I agree with you.  Try adding 2-3 cloves of garlic to the saute (but don't burn it) or some garlic powder once you add the wine and broth.  Also add a couple of bay leaves to the broth and 1/2 to 1 teaspoons of ginger...and while you're at it.....double the paprika (Hungarian of course).....and for those of you that are doubling the sauce recipe....try 3 T of paprika first and then see if you need any more.  But above all.....make sure you are adding enough salt.  I cannot stress that enough.  Salt bring out the flavor in food.  Even when baking a good dessert cake from scratch, the recipe will require salt (and if it doesn't....add at least 1/8 teaspoons.....you won't regret it...i promise).  So taste this dish as you're making it a couple of times to make sure it's salty enough (without over doing it)....keeping in mind that the sour cream in the end will take away a little bit of the saltyness.  Enjoy!!!

Basically good. As with others, i also altered the recipe by increasing the wine and salt and pepper. Instead of sour cream, i used Greek-style yogurt. Nice!

My mother made this for years as I was growing up and I also make it.  Here is what we do: Use bone-in chicken, cut up, salt and set aside.  Add canola oil to dutch oven.  Heat, add chopped onion and cover the top of the onions with hot Hungarian papkria til onions are soft.  Add chicken.  Add 1/2 to 1 c. water.  Cover til chicken is cooked.  Remove chicken to platter, keep warm.  Mix flour into sour cream.  Gently add to liquid in pot, stirring til thickened.  Do not boil.  Add chicken back into pot.  Forget the pasta, noodles, rice and whatever else these people are using!  The only way to serve it is with hlousky which is a drop dumpling made with flour, salt, egg and milk.  Mix til thick.  Flick bits into boiling water, drain, keep hot.  Serve chicken with gravy over the hlousky.  Perfection!

Made exactly as described, garnished with parsley.  First bite was a bit tangy -- used chardonnay wine.  Is that why?  Also, my partner complained that the sauce was a little "gritty."  I didn't think so, and I don't know what would explain this.  I would appreiate any thoughts from other reviewers who have tried this one.  I thought it was very good but not great.

This was good! I've never had chicken paprikash before, but it's one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes. I had to use regular paprika, which was okay. I plan on buying the real stuff. While I did really enjoy this (I served it over bread dumplings), I'd never make it for the bf because rumor has it, his mother makes a mean dish of chicken paprikash. And it's well known not to compete with mama's cookin'! So, I'll keep this little gem to myself. Thanks Jill!

Can't get sour cream where I live, so I substituted cream cheese instead and it was really lovely. My husband's favorite recipe so far!

Made it as written the first time; made it with modifications the second time: added 1 clove minced garlic and added it with the onion. Doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the sour cream. Added one thinly sliced green pepper and cooked with everything for the last 10 minutes. Did not reduce the liquid. Made with the Pioneer Cut Dumplings recipe on this site. With the modifications, it tasted just like what my mom used to make. Delicious!

BF's mom used to make this for him all the time. I have never made it. So I was a little nervous how mine would hold up. He loved it! I used chicken breast and plain yogurt in place of the sour cream. I ended up adding more paprika at the end.

This is vay good!  I added smoked paprika and it was the best.  I do not use the white wine my children don't like the taste of the wine.  I do add a little cheyanne pepper and I like to use a stronger chicken broth.  No need to make changes it great over grandma brand noodles from the frozen section I like them chewy and the husband does not like dumplings so this is a good alternative.

Very good dish!  Instead of a whole chicken, I chopped up one jumbo chicken breasts (or 2 average-sized chicken breasts).  I doubled the amount of paprika and added a bit more of chicken broth and it turned out great.  I served it with a side-dish of pasta (from allrecipes.com) rather than serving it atop ordinary / unflavored pasta.

This is a great Paprikash recipe-just like my
Hungarian mom made except she used milk instead
of wine. My whole family enjoys this.

Very Very greasy and took almost an hour and ten to cook. I followed exactly-even REAL paprika. The sour cream did not mesh with all the grease from chicken skin. If using bone in chicken as I did maybe remove the skin??

5 stars. I have no idea how traditional this is, but it was delicious. Only thing I added was red pepper flakes and a clove of garlic (and some s&p along the way). Oh and I used thighs vs. the whole chicken since that's what I had on hand.

As several reviewers have said, this needs considerably more paprika than the recipe calls for.  I used about 3 TB and it was delicious, but could still use a bit more.

I wasn't going to review this because I made so many adjustments to it, but after tasting how it came out when I made it, I had to. First, I'm on a very strict diet, so I can't have a lot of fat. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast cutlets and pounded them to about a quarter inch. Then I browned them in olive oil. Removed from the skillet and followed the recipe as stated with the onions, paprika, wine and broth except I doubled them because I love sauces. Then I returned the chicken breast cutlets and simmered until they were done. I did not add the sour cream because of my diet, but I just poured some of the thickened sauce on top of my chicken and it was AWESOME. Full of flavor and what a great flavor it was! I had it with asparagus and I dipped my spears in the sauce on my plate. I can only imagine how good and flavorful this is when made the RIGHT way. Awesome recipe!

My Mom is from Hungary, I have been making the family Paprikash for years, when I saw this recipe I combined the two...Add (3) cans of low sodium Chicken broth and (2) cans of water, follow the recipe then add the broth and water.  I also use 1/2 cup of Paprika, it's more like a soup / stew.  Then I use my Mom's Spaetzle recipe and drop in at the end...It's so delicious, my entire family LOVES it, great on a snowy day.  Get some hot Italian bread for dipping and away we go...!!

wonderful recipe! I took advice of other and increased liquid to make more sauce. Added a total of 1 cup chicken broth omitted the wine; 1 cup of sour creme; and two heaping tablespoons of Hungarian paprika. Husband said this was a keeper!

Wonderful flavor. Even better than the recipe my family has handed down over the years.  The wine gives it a very rich flavor.  I like a lot of sauce so I used 3-4 tablespoons of paprika, 1 cup of white wine, 1 cup of broth and 2 cups of sour cream.  I used 4 large boneless/skinless breasts instead of the whole chicken.  I also cooked my spaetzle in chicken broth instead of water. Yummmm

It was just okay, but bland overall.  I didn't have any Hungarian paprika on hand, maybe that would have improved it as some other readers recommended.

That's ah spahcy meahtbohl! Yum! I used split chicken breasts instead of a whole cut up chicken, Hungarian hot paprika (1.5 tbsp), and I doubled the sauce. I did not have wine, so I used a total of 1 cup broth. And since I used more broth, I added an extra tablespoon or so of sour cream.  Served over egg noodles.  Mmmm....and do not bother if you do not have real Hungarian paprika - you will be disappointed.

I used about 1-1/2 tablespoons of paprika.  About 1/2 tablespoon sweet and 1 tablespoon hot.  It made for a very nice and spicy sauce.  I also used a slotted spoon to take the chicken out of the skillet and put into a bowl with the sour cream so that the sauce would be a little thicker.  I used pieces of chicken breast that were cut small, so I cooked it for a little less time.  Yummy.  We will definitely have this again.

This was very good Jill.  I agree with the reviewer that said to use Hungarian paprika.  American paprika doen't have much taste to it. I used bone-in breasts only and doubled the recipe (doubled all but the onion). Pretty low carb too, with just a green salad as a side. Husband and I enjoyed leftovers for lunch the next day. Will definitely make again.

This is an amazing dish and it tastes almost exactly like the version my hungarian friend makes.I changed it slightly by using chicken thigh meat and then I add mushrooms green peppers, and 2 whole tomatos. that is how my friend made it. thanks for sharing this amazing recipe, I will make it over and over and over!!

This end result of this was very good and tasty. I will definitely make this again. It was a little time consuming for a weekday. Next time I'll do it on a weekend when I don't have to rush so much. Once I get it down I can do it on a weekday. Thank you!

This is very good - very authentic.  I'm Hungarian and this is very very close to the family recipe.  I added garlic, doubled the sauce and paprika and served over hungarian dumplings (nokedli) - you HAVE to have these with chicken paprikash!

I've made this dish a few times now and just love it.  It's by far the best-tasting paprikash I've had.  I do tweak some of the measurments and add a touch of cayenne pepper since I can't find the "good" paprika.  I serve it with spaetzel and mix it all together before dishing out.  Delicious.  Thank you for this recipe!!

This looks great - exactly what I was looking for! I will probably use boneless, skinless breasts - as that is what I have on hand - and serve over homemade spaetzle. I do have the Hungarian Paprika though!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because I could not find hungarian paprika but made the recipe anyway.  I added cayenne pepper but still found it somewhat bland. 
It was easy to make.  I used chicken legs and kept them in the pan the whole time even while I cooked the onion.  I also omitted the white wine and increased the amount of stock and sour cream per other reviewers' suggestions.
I will definitely try it again if I can find the paprika.

Loved this recipe.  I omitted the onion and used some onion powder per my taste.  I used all chicken broth instead of broth and wine.  I also made with three boneless skinless chicken breasts.  It seems like the paprika and sour cream measurements are off as I probably doubled everything and then some to make alot of sauce.  Served over noodles.  YUM!

Very good dish.  I used split chicken breasts as suggested by other raters.  I couldn't find the hungarian paprika, but still thought it was great.  I will make it again.

I was disappointed in the flavor.  Very bland.  Might try again doubling the paprika and adding some cayenne, but it seemed like a lot of work for so-so taste.

Yum!  The chicken is so tender, and the sauce is not overpowering, but creamy and spicy.  I added a little cayanne to mine, but it would be good either way.

My husband and I are eating healthier which can sometimes mean bland.  Not this one! It was awesome!  I did "doctor" it a bit. I used fat-free sour cream and doubled the broth and wine as well as added an additional teaspoon of paprika. It turned out perfect, just spicy enough and alot of flavor.  We served it over garlic and basil pasta noodles.  It if was this good with "healthier" ingredients, imagine how good it would be with the "bad stuff".

I didn't care for this recipe much but my husband loved it. I used Hungarian hot paprika and it did have the perfect amount of spice to it. I skipped the wine, this didn't seem to matter much. The sauce turned out kind of greasy. Next time I make this I'm going to skip the olive oil and not brown the chicken first to see if this helps.

Well, I was excited about this dish.  I bought Hungarian Paprika specifically to use with it.  It was only OK.  It may have seemed better if my husband hadn't picked at it and didn't even try it because he didn't think he'd like it.  Ah...well...another try, another fail...  If it was a bit better, I might make it again even though my husband will pick at it - but it wasn't that great.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have wine so I used chicken broth, and increased it to 1 cup.  Chicken was moist and the sauce was very good.  I will make again.  And again!

I NEVER review the recipes I get on here, I sadly must admit!  But this one I had to!!!  This was my first time making the dish, and it was wonderful! I did have to increase the paprika by a lot, but followed the recipe to a tee.  Thank you!  I am actually going to make this dish again in 2 days once this runs out!

Apparently Hungarian paprika isn't extremely handy around my area, so I had to settle for Spanish. I knew that would make this dish pretty, but bland, so I added a small amount of crushed red pepper, sugar, and fennel.  Definitely added some flavor that would have been missing otherwise. 

I also used diced chicken breast, because that's what I had handy.  

Someday, I hope to make this recipe with bone-in chicken and the correct paprika, but I thought it was great even just working with what I had. 

Like others, I would make more sauce next time.  

And I just finished the leftovers--they're awesome.

Hmmmm...I don't know what to say but we really didn't care for this at all. My son liked it very much, but neither hubby nor I did. We didn't think it had much flavor although I actually added more paprika than called for. I did use Hungarian sweet paprika, maybe that made the difference? Sorry, we just didn't care for this one.

Dee-licious!! The sauce this made was so good, I could almost drink it as a beverage, lol. My SO, who NEVER puts sauce or gravy on anything, was spooning ladles of this over his chicken and the wide egg noodles I served with it. I agree with the hot Hungarian paprika being a "must", as well as doubling the broth, wine and sour cream. Will make again and again.

This recipe rocks! It has been my family's favorite this winter. Even my sauce and onion-phobic son loves it!
I have used all cuts of chicken successfully-boneless breasts, boneless thighs(my favorite),cut up pieces (good for buffets),etc. I add minced garlic and use 1T. hot hungarian paprika and 1T. regular (or sweet) hungarian paprika.

I made this recipe using 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 4 pieces). I doubled the liquids to make more sauce like everyone suggested. I also added three cloves of garlic and a large pinch of ground ginger. I served it with potato and cheese perogi (the fozen kind out of a box -- boiled for recommended time then browned in the same skilled for a few minutes). I garnished with a few sprinkles of dried bay leaves. It was fantastic!

One of our absolute favorites! Originally found in a betty crocker cookbook that seems to have vanished...

I highly season and brown the chicken beforehand...usually powdered versions of onion and garlic and salt and pepper.

I never use wine, just broth. This is probably the most demanded recipe in our house...and all the boys (4 of them) love it. The sauce itself is amazing.

I serve over steamed jasmine rice. I have made this for years.

This was really good. It does need a lot of salt and pepper, I seasoned the ingredients with every step. I added garlic and celery just because I had some that needed to be used up, and I served it over brown rice.

This is a very authentic-tasting recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken because that is what I prefer. I used Hungarian Sweet paprika, which I think is a must for that authentic taste and aroma. I also easily doubled the sauce, because we like having lots of sauce.

I used boneless skinless because it's what I had on hand.  I reduced the simmer time to 20 min to keep the meat from drying out.  I served it over egg noodles.  Everyone loved it!  I look forward to using bone-in chicken for an even better flavor, as pointed out by one of the other reviews. This is a surprisingly simple dish to make, yet is quite impressive!

I'm not Hungarian (Italian actually) so I never had a Paprikash recipe. So when I thought I'd wow my friends with a neat dinner, I used this recipe and it turned out fabulous! This is a keeper!

I have been looking for a good Paprikash recipe for a long time and I must say this one is it! It reminded me of the one my Mom made as a kid. I did add ALOT more hungarian Paprika (about 1/4 cup in all) but that really was the only change I made. My kids loved it to!!

Well...I just made this dish tonight for dinner; and let me tell you: It was wonderful! I made some changes on it: did not have any white wine, so I increased the chicken broth. Also, even I had the Hungarian Paprika it was not the regular one, I have the HOT version of it; so I decided to use it...The results were very gooooood! My kids love it! I served it over plain white rice. Yummy.  Thanks for sharing, Monica

This was okay ... I think it would be better if you added a little garlic, maybe some chili powder ... I did, btw, use Hungarian paprika and bone-in chicken and, as I said, it was okay, but I do think it needs some tweaking ... thanks!

I loved it, my partner wasn't crazy about it. Definitely use the good paprika and double up on the sauce. The original recipe wasn't saucy enough.

I love chicken paprikash but could never make anything close to Mom's. This recipe is very close but I did change a couple of things to make it even more similar. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 1 cup of sherry, 1 cup of sour cream, omitted the chicken broth, 2 chopped garlic cloves, and tons of freshly ground black pepper. I also never removed the chicken from the pot and it was perfect! I served mine on top of home made spaetzel. The leftovers the next day were even better!

The sauce was delicious!  But you definitely need to make more than the recipe calls for. I increased the sauce (sour cream, wine, chicken stock and paprika) by 50% and used only two large chicken breasts and I still would have liked more sauce.  Served over egg noodles. Next time I'll try it with whole cut-up chicken and spaetzle or dumplings. Great recipe!

My husband and I thought this recipe was GREAT.  I used 4 chicken breasts cut into 3 pieces each, then added a little more oil, doubled the paprika, wine, chicken broth and sour cream, as we like lots of sauce.  I used the hot Hungarian paprika, which made it very spicy and flavorful.  I served the chicken over a bed of garlic parsley fettuccini (which you can buy in your local grocery store). I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you Jill!

Made my father-in-law's day having this old family dish made in his honor. He loved it, and it went over surprisingly well with the kiddies. A little messy, but worth the effort.
