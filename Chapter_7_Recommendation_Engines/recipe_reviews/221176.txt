Even my son, who won't eat cauliflower, loves this soup. The only tweaks I made were to roast the garlic and cauliflower at 400 before adding to the soup. This extra step added a LOT of flavor. I also discovered that changing the cheese added dimension. One time, I used Bellavita brand asiago and it was a definite game changer.

Absolutely delicious as written. Would not change a thing. Creamy, but with texture with just enough spices.

Delicious recipe....used leftover steamed cauliflower. The cream cheese and Asiago add a nice, tangy flavor setting this above the overly creamy soups.

Delicious soup! I pulsed the cauliflower and cheeses in the food processor instead of using a potato masher

This recipe is a keeper. I did change a few things around...I used a 32 oz Box of Chicken Broth to boil Cauliflower in, but after accessing everything ink re I wanted thicker soup so I then took 8oz of Broth out the pot before putting the cheese mix in. Also, you don’t really need the fresh herbs...I moved around my weekly food budget thinking I needed them and I didn’t, but it was a nice touch. Overall, I loved and the cauliflower as cheese mix great beginning to a roast or mashed cauliflower “potato” dish!
