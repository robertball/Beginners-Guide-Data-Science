This was really easy and tasty. Used fresh crab. The panko was a bit too chunky and visually not so appealling. Would recommend crushing them before coating the cakes. Also, we ended up broiling for about 8 min to give them a golden color. Lastly, the dip is great, but watch the lemon, it could be overpowering. These are a great tasting alternative to mayo and fried cakes.

I've always fried crab cakes before, but I won't do it again! This recipe reduces the fat in the classic crab cakes by substituting yogurt for mayonnaise and eliminating the oil the crab cakes absorb in the frying process. Yet the panko keeps them crispy. The lemon zest added to the flavor. Putting the crab cakes on parchment paper makes cleanup easy and keeps them from sticking to the pan. I turned them halfway through baking so they would brown on both sides, without any breaking apart as they often do in frying. I added minced celery and minced onion instead of the green onion and bell pepper. I did not make the sauce, but I think the crab cakes would have been better with a sauce. I will use this recipe for crab cakes from now on.

We all enjoyed these! I made the crab cakes as written except cut back on the panko by at least half....I made my own version of tartar sauce to serve with them as I wouldn't get hubby to eat the yogurt sauce....we'll definitely be making these again soon!

The lightest fluffiest crab cakes we've ever had. I regularly make these. I use plain Noosa yogurt instead of nonfat Greek yogurt and I  add fresh dill to the dip.

These were awesome! I made them into little balls for a party appetizer. I substituted Herbs de Provence for the basil and parsley.  Low fat and delicious.

Tasty but could use a little more spice.  We used fresh crab and let's just say there weren't any left on the platter at the Super Bowl Party!

I liked the sauce, but the crab cake itself was a little bland for my taste.  If I make these again I will add some spice(s).

Tried this with what I had on hand (green pepper and red onion) and didn't dip in panko, instead sprinkled the tops with panko before spraying and baking. Cooked a bit longer, 20 minutes to a golden brown. DH and I enjoyed with cocktail sauce. Incredibly simple to make.
