This is a lovely alternative to rice. For those of you who say it is too bland, here is what I do: use a deep skillet and sautee the garlic then add the orzo and chicken broth instead of water. Sautee the chicken separately with garlic and serve it on top.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I had to modify it just a little bit. I brought a small pot of chicken broth to a boil and cooked the orzo in that. I had planned to drain off any extra broth, but it ended up soaking all in and making the orzo really nice and creamy. I sauteed the garlic and red pepper in olive oil then added the pieces of chicken. When the chicken was finished I added the orzo to it and stirred letting it sit on low heat for about 10 minutes. The result was YUMMY! My husband really liked it and has asked for it again. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe because it's fast and delicious. We love strong flavors and the red pepper makes it great.  I add at least 1 clove more of garlic, plenty of salt and spice, according to my taste that day.  You can slant this recipe either Greek or Italian, to your tastes.  If going Greek, add 1 tsp. oregano, chopped Greek olives and crumbled feta,(before serving), if desired.  To swing it Italian, add basil instead of oregano and serve with shredded parmesan.  I've made this several times, sometimes subbing diced Italian-style tomatoes when I don't have the spinach.  Either way, spinach or tomatoes, you can't go wrong with this easy delicious recipe!

The recipe here was overall a great base. I took the suggestion of cooking the orzo in chicken broth and added oregano for my spice.  I diced the garlic in order for the flavor to come out more (along with adding a few extra gloves in order to prevent any blandness).  I went with tomatoes instead of spinach, and found it was quite the hit.  I served this with peas and corn which provided enough extra "color."  It was a HUGE hit with my family; however, my one caution would be to NOT overcook the orzo. I did that a bit and although it was still delicious, that would have made a difference.

Yummy!  Very easy to make and full of flavor.  I did find it a tad oily though, so next time I will only use half the olive oil.

I loved this and will be making it again.
I added cayenne as well as onion , yellow pepper and a whole head of garlic. I first browned the orzo in oil then added the rest . I also browned the chicken first and set aside then added at the end . Used chick broth as well.

I picked 4 stars, but wpuld have been closer to 3.5.  It is not bland, but a littel one dimensional.  I added pepper.  I would add more lemon and a bit of lemon zest next time.  I agree that it was a bit oily.  I would do 1.5 tbs next time.

People ask me to make this all the time! When I don't have fresh basil, ground works fine. Diced tomatoes also taste good with this.

This was awesome!  Boiled orzo in 2.5 cups chicken broth, was perfect, didn't need to be drained.  Oil, garlic & red pepper, I didn't measure, just used what was to our taste.  Tossed in cheese when I added orzo, parsley & spinach.  Cooked until spinach was wilted & topped with more cheese.  Loved it.  Was super simple for a week night, chopped chicken & garlic while waiting for chicken broth to boil.  Tore spinach, chopped parsley, grated cheese while chicken was cooking.  Tossed it all together, let it cook a couple minutes and dinner was served.  I didn't time it, but I'm sure dinner was on the table in less than 30 minutes.    Like someone said a little feta, olive and a squeeze of lemon could make this Greek.

To add flavor, I cooked the orzo in broth and add more red pepper.  I also added romano cheese and let it melt into the orzo mixture.

this, was very good but i only gave it four stars because i think it would have been sort of blah without the additions that i made.the amount of chicken is sort of vague, so i used an 11-oz. breast. i added a red and an orange bell pepper, cubed, some thickly sliced mushrooms, and doubled the spinach. following the advice of another reviewer, i cooked the orzo in broth until it was creamy, and i covered the pot after adding the spinach to help wilt all the extra spinach. it was very colorful, with lots of complimentary tastes and textures.

This is easily moved up to five stars with a few simple changes. First, yes, yes yes, cook the orzo in chicken broth for much better flavor. Also, I only use 1 tablespoon oil for sauteing the garlic and chicken and I add a sliced onion while I'm at it. I love the spinach in this dish, but it would work just as well with some pre-steamed broccoli, peas or diced tomatoes. This is just such a yummy dish that begs for you to be creative and make it a little different each time!

Very nice! I upped the garlic to 4 cloves, and added 1/4 of a preserved lemon to the chicken toward the end of the sauteeing, I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great combination of flavors and textures, and healthy!  The orzo pasta makes this VERY kid friendly.  I usually toast the pasta for a few minutes in a dry skillet prior to cooking in boiling water, adds a little nutty flavor.

This recipe was great, I didn't see the suggestion about boiling it in chicken broth until after my orzo was in the water.  I added some chicken boulion into the boiling water in the last 4 minutes of cooking and it tasted great.  I will definitely keep this in my "need a meal quick" recipe book.

I gave it four stars instead of five because I altered the recipe a little since a lot of people said it was bland.  

For the orzo, I first browned it in 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.  Then I added two cups of chicken broth and let it simmer (covered) for 15 minutes.  

For the rest, I doubled the garlic and parsley and followed the cooking instructions as in the recipe. I also added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan and 1/2 lb of sauteed mushrooms the same time I added the spinach.  Turned out very very good.  I'm keeping this one around.

My husband and I don't share tastes too often, but we both liked this recipe. I got my pasta and cheese, and he got his chicken with a kick, thanks to the red pepper.  I followed the recipe with the few exceptions: the orzo was cooked in chicken broth, used basil instead of parsley, and added mushrooms, yellow squash, and zucchini the last couple minutes of cooking the chicken.  Easy and delicious way to eat your veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I did make a few changes, such as cooking the orzo in chicken broth. I also grilled my chicken breast before cutting it into chunks and adding it in. I upped the garlic to 4 cloves, just because I love garlic! I also substituted petite fresh green beans for the spinach, as I don't like cooked spinach. This was a simple, quick meal that I'll make again.

My husband and I love veggies and frequently add in some sliced carrots, broccoli, and whatever else we happen to have on hand.  I like to add a splash of dry white wine after the garlic and red pepper have been browned.

It's a great side dish if you leave out the chicken or it can be a nice and light summer meal with grilled chicken or fried fish

ORZO...the new rice...who'd a thunk it. I DID not know.  I always thought..."What's the point".  If you want pasta...USE PASTA. Then I realized I'd rather use rice shaped pasta...THAN RICE.  Also, I try to use Whole Wheat products when available...as it is with ORZO.  Though I still haven't figured out Whole Wheat Gnocchi.  I'd be buying WW potatoes if I could find them. Alas, that's another time and place.  As far as the rest...add mushrooms, broccoli and WAAAAY more garlic if you want to ooze any garlic out of your pores. Plus, how can you call something a garlic dish to feed 4 without adding a lot more than 2 cloves?  The better Parmesan you use...the better it tastes. I like to add more spinach also...since spinach reduces so much. Arugula would probably add a peppery nature to the leafy greens if one wanted to try that, or add both. Another time I cooked it I did the broth/stock instead of water to cook the Orzo. Also added diced garlic to the brothsock. Added a flavorful element. Lots of Parm/Regg also.

Easy to prepare and with a green salad, a complete meal.  My husband said it is ok but rather bland.  I get that.  We are garlic lovers so I used 5 cloves of garlic, slicing them into thick slices.  The taste was not overbearing at all.  The recipe didn't say to do anything with the garlic, but when garlic is sliced it provides more flavor.  Next time I make this and there will be a next time, I will use about 10 cloves of garlic as it really gives it a little kick to bite into a browned tender slice of garlic.  I didn't have spinach, so I used frozen peas at the last.  Next time I will be prepared with spinach, which I think may kick up the flavor and reduce the blandness. Also, the increased garlic will give it a distinctive taste.  The 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper is just right.

This is one of my go-to recipes and one of my husbands favorites! I usually add extra spinach and leave out the parsley. I also use chicken broth to cook the orzo in.

FANTASTIC!  It is a special moment when you come across a recipe that really just straight up knocks your socks off and by golly, I had one of those moments tonight! 

As suggested by the original poster, I tossed in some dice tomatoes along with the rest of the ingredients and found an instant hit.  

Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was great!  I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and added onion and cayenne pepper.  I also used the whole bag of spinach and cooked the orzo in chicken broth.

This recipe was very good, I was impressed. I did double the red pepper and it gave it a nice bite. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and added some lemon juice over the top which turned out nice too.

The orzo makes this recipe ( I added more like 1 1/4 cup) and you need to use fresh parsley, as opposed to dry, since this recipe doesn't have many spices.  I added some pepper to taste, but overall, it's a great recipe as is!  I think it would also be delicious with salmon in place of the chicken.

This is a wonderful dish. I'm a novice at cooking, but it's surprisingly easy to make. I'm just not into washing the dishes after wards. =) I like to change it up a little by adding rosemarie and topping it off with good helping of sundried tomatoes, instead of parsley and cheese. I love this dish. Thank you.

I boiled the orzo until al dente in water alongside a lot of salt, and a large clove of garlic (be sure to pull that after draining), after draining I melted about a tablespoon of butter with it. For the chicken I cooked the breasts whole, each side sprinkled with salt, pep, and garlic pwdr, first side with a bit of red pepper flakes... sauteed in a tablespoon of oil. Pulled them when they were almost done, let chill a sec and then diced. I added some diced onion and chopped garlic to the pan until brown and then a little butter and then the diced chicken with about a quarter cup(or enough to coat chicken and orzo) and let it all cook and blend for a few minutes. then i added the parsley... mixed it up... put into serving bowls and topped with the parm. Very good and very simple.. I will definitely keep this in mind for easy "please anyone" meals... my 8 year old asked for seconds! Next time I might go a little easier on the pepper flakes (and I may not have even used 1/4 tsp) but that is my only complaint!

This was a great starting point.. I made the recipe.. But, didn't add two cloves of garlic because i made a sauce    creamy sauce.. Melt 1tsp of butter add 2 tsp of crushed garlic and then 1/4 cream the 1/2 of parm cheese.. mixed it all together and added chicken and orzo.. I also topped with broccoli.. It was AMAZING!!!!.

This was a great one pot meal and easy enough to make on a busy weeknight. I used fresh broccoli in place of the spinach and left out the crushed red pepper flakes. Yummy I would make this again.

Excellent!  Used one more clove of garlic about 3 cups spinach, and cooked orzo in chicken broth as other suggested.  It looks fancy, but very simple!  Will add to the dinner rotation!

I cooked the orzo in chicken broth as suggested by others.  I imagine this dish would be pretty bland without it, but be careful: it does increase the saltiness of the dish.  With the broth and olives added, it definitely turned out on the salty side.  I used oregano instead of parsley and omitted the spinach.  Next time, I will try it with tomatoes, as suggested, and use less oregano (I used 1/2 tsp per serving).

This was very good but could be five stars I think.  Next time will add some diced tomato and sautee the orzo with garlic before cooking in chicken broth.  I also might sautee the chicken in some white wine and garlic as well. Liked the heat of the red pepper flakes. Also, will use more spinach next time.  Very good for a quick meal that left us a lunch for the next day!

I thought this was good, but a little bland (I did cook the orzo in chicken broth), but my husband loved it. He is SUPER picky, so anything he likes is good in my book!

Made this tonight for dinner. It was very good and easy. I made the chicken ahead, and would not recommend that. I did substitute tomatoes for the spinach since we do not like cooked spinach.

This recipe needs a lot of help.  It is really bland with no sauce to speak of.  Maybe cook the orzo in something other than water (wine, broth).   It's a few ingredients away from being enjoyable.

Super easy & super tasty.  Great for when you are short on time.  I followed others advice & cooked the orzo in chicken broth.  I also seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning, salt & pepper before I added it to the pan.  Doubled the garlic & the spinach and added mushrooms as well.  the boyfriend cleaned his plate & went back for seconds.

Nice basic recipe. Not a whole lot of flavor though. We had to doctor it with more salt, red pepper and garlic powder. 
I would recommend cooking the orzo in chicken stock. I also added tomatoes.

I thought this was just OK, but my kids LOVED it. I used tomatoes instead of spinach, and added italian seasoning. Instead of crushed red pepper, I sauteed some Anaheim chilis I needed to use up with the garlic. I loved how quick it was.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a few modifications.  I sauteed a red bell pepper for a few minutes before adding the garlic and red pepper.  I also used cilantro instead of parsley which I think adds great flavor to the dish.  Also used steamed broccoli instead of the spinach.  This was very tasty.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you.

I loved this recipe, but I had to add more red pepper. I also used chicken and shrimp, which was great!  Next time I plan to add pine nuts, tomatoes and possible some basil for a different flavor.

Decent recipe, but definitely needed some changes. The first time I made it, it was quite bland. This time, I used arugula instead of spinach and cooked the orzo in low sodium chicken broth. It turned out MUCH more flavourful that way, and just as healthy.

Orzo was a nice change to regular pasta or rice.  Added a splash of sherry cooking wine, and a can of low sodium chicken broth half way through cooking chicken for more flavor and to keep the chicken moist.  Turned out very nice!  Comforting, but still pretty healthy winter meal.  Thanks!

I have to give this five stars just for being so fast and easy! It was less than 1/2 hour, start to finish. I did cook the orzo in water with chicken bouillon, just for added flavor, and took the suggestion of the submitter to sub diced tomatoes for the spinach. This is a very versatile recipe, you could make all kinds of changes to the seasonings to suit your own tastes!

This is a favorite for our entire family, including two toddlers.  It also lends itself very easily to modifications depending on tastes.  Our favorite way to do it is to cook the orzo in low sodium chicken broth, we use leftover chicken which we previously seasoned and smoked so we don't add any salt, and we substitute 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables for the spinach.  It is an EASY, FAST weeknight dinner that everyone loves and gets our kids to eat their veggies.  Thanks for the post!

REALLY good recipe!! Tastes even better the next day! and for the novices like myself... orzo is to be cooked like a PASTA not a RICE, so stop looking for a specific quantity of water to cook the pasta in because once it's cooked, you drain orzo like spaghetti noodles.  Took me a minute to figure that out :)

I followed the tips that others posted of using chicken broth instead of water and made a soup out of it. I added some chopped onions to the skillet with the garlic. I did not add the spinach to the skillet to cook it. Rather, I added the spinach and the contents of the skillet to the pot of orzo and broth and just heated it over medium heat till it reached serving temperature. It was excellent!

When looking for quick dinner recipes I came across this one. I made it for my boyfriend one night and not only was it super quick to make it was a big hit. I threw some mushrooms in one night and it was a great addition.

Was great and simple. Next time I will add more garlic but we are garlic addicts. I used part plain olive oil and part Fustini's Tuscan Herb EVOO.

This was great! As some of the other reviewers suggested, I cooked the orzo in chicken broth. I also upped the garlic to 5 minced cloves because we love garlic. Definitely a do-over meal!

Sorry, but I found this to be dry and rather tasteless.  Maybe with some changes it would be better, but I won't make it again as written.

I thought this really lacked flavor. I feel like I threw in everything but the kitchen sink to make this taste better, but it just didn't work. I did use tomatoes instead of the spinach and that added a little bit more to the flavor. I probably wouldn't make this again, sorry!

Great inspiration recipe...got me thinking of how to use orzo. Sauteed the garlic and red pepper, added chicken and fresh sliced mushrooms (added some butter to the EVOO for the mushrooms...I like the flavor better). Once mushrooms were soft and chicken was cooked, I added the orzo to the skillet along with a little more red pepper flakes. Cooked about 5 min. Served with parmesan cheese. Amazing! Thanks for the inspiration :)

Great side or main dish. Used other reviewers suggestions and cooked orzo in chicken broth. Also added artichoke hearts in water. Great with Parmesan cheese, but would also be good with Feta.

My family didn't eat much of this; it's probably better right from the stove.  I will try this again to get it where my family will eat it.  I made it and left to go out of town to leave for my two boys and husband.  I came back with a lot of the chicken left.  Perhaps I used too much chicken?

This is a great recipe! I was worried that it might not have enough flavor from the other reviews, but it was perfect! I made a double batch for my large family, but only used the 1/4 tsp of red pepper because my family is sensitive to spicy foods. I also put spinach in only half of it, because some of the little kids wouldn't like it. I added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the mixture when it was done, and stirred it up until it melted. This helped boost the flavor, and everyone enjoyed this dish. It is healthy, easy, and yummy. I'll be making it again!

This was good for a light supper. I left out the red pepper flakes (family doesn't like spicy), I used a little of the reserved cooking water from the pasta to deglaze the pan, and only lightly wilted the spinach. Other than that - I followed it exactly.

This was quite good! I didn't cut up the chicken, and I forgot to get the spinach at the store (I will def add next time). The red pepper adds a bit of zing which is good.  I added tomatoes as previously suggested as well as italian herbs and mushrooms which was gave a good flavor. Had for lunch the next day and reheated wonderfully. My non-adventurous (orzo is new for him) boyfriend loved it!!

im not impressed with this recipe at all. I think it needs alot of altering. i am very particular on texture of food, and i did not enjoy how oily it was in mix with the pasta. I have never cooked with orzo before, so it didnt come out as al dente as i wanted it. But personally i think i am going to use rice. The chicken is REALLY good... i am just not a fan of the orzo and oil. It might be better if it is over rice, because the rice will soak up alot of the oil, vs the orzo kinda made it seem worse... i probably wont use THIS paricular recipe again, but might use some of the steps and build it into something else.

My husband and I really enjoyed this simple, quick recipe. I followed a fellow reviewers advice and cooked the orzo in chicken broth. I also added tomatoes and used salmon instead of chicken. Great recipe. Will definitely make it again.

This was very good and healthy!  I used frozen spinach and added a can of stewed tomatoes and some oregano.  Also, I didn't have any orzo on hand, so I served this over couscous.  I already have requests for the recipe!

I cooked this nearly as-is, the only thing I changed was to cook the orzo in chicken broth instead of water. It does give it a nice, creamy texture as another reviewer suggested and brings out more flavour in the dish.  I also probably added more garlic since I love it, and possibly more spinach and red pepper - we like spicy!  All in all a superb recipe, thank you for sharing! A very nice alternative to rice dishes.

this is a great start that i've made several times. Definitely boil the orzo in chicken stock and load up on veggies! I've added mushrooms, peas and diced tomatoes. Used some italian seasonings and more garlic to spice it up.

Delicious! This was really, really great. The flavors were light and refreshing. The only change I made was to deglaze the pan with a little white wine after cooking the chicken, which I think added a nice flavor. I think this would be great with a little lemon squeezed over top right before serving too. Very good. Thank you! :)

This is the ultimate tasty, healthy recipe. I use whole grain ozro that tastes exactly like regular orzo. I add mushrooms and shallots and adjust the red pepper to my taste (just a little more spicey). It's the perfect meal!

The recipe is good as is considering it is low calorie, but a bit bland.  To add more flavor, I added sundried tomatoes.  If you've never had sundried tomatoes, try them in this recipe.  They are delicious and made this recipe 5 stars instead of 4!

I liked this because it is relatively healthy, cheap and easy to prepare, and called for simple ingredients. I read the reviews about it being bland so I made the following additions: I seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning, black pepper and garlic salt and let it sit a little prior to cooking, I added some white wine to the chicken and let it simmer before adding the orzo, and I added chopped roma tomatoes just before serving. When I make this again, I will cook the chicken in olive oil AND butter and season with cajun seasoning.  I think that will liven it up a little more.  But overall, this is a keeper and will be a regular at my house.

Great Recipe!  Simple, 30minutes or less and delish all for 300 calories - how can you beat that!  I did what some others suggested and also added chicken stock to the garlic chicken and orzo mix to keep it moist.  It was a great light dish and would definitely make it again.  Reminded me of a low fat version of risotto.

Made this recipe yesterday for dinner and it was fantastic!! I cooked the orzo in chicken broth as others stated and didn't drain it...gave it a nice base for a sauce.  I quadrupled the garlic (which I usually always do) and added mushrooms, a tomato, kale, red pepper and threw on some scallions at the end. I cooked the chicken first and took it off the pan and sauteed the veggies and since I didn't have any red pepper flakes I added cayenne to the veggies.  Threw the ck in, then the orzo and voila! an awesome dinner!!  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it again!!

We really enjoyed this. I cooked the orzo in chicken broth, which really gave it a lot of flavor. I've already made this more than once!

I didn't have any parsely so I did as another reviewer suggested and instead added rosemary and lemon juice and I cooked the orzo in chicken broth. The pasta came out delicious and I could not get enough of it. I underestimated how much spinach to put in and continued to add it to leftovers. The chicken, however, came out bland and rubbery. It didn't take on the flavors at all. Next time I'll add more vegetables and skip the chicken.

I read the previous reviews that said this was kind of bland, so I kind of modified it.  My family doesn't like spinach, so I used a can of diced tomatoes, and instead of red pepper flakes from a jar, I crushed my own (ouch! I forgot to wear gloves!!).  I had inadvertently used the fresh parmesan for another recipe so had to use from a jar, but it was ok.  That said, my family LOVED this recipe and it was SO EASY!!

My husband and I loved this dish. Per some previous suggestions, I cooked the pasta in chicken broth. I used basil instead of parsley because I had a bunch to use up. I used a bit more spinach than called for because we like it. The crushed red pepper gave it a wonderful spice that contrasted wonderfully with the spinach and parm cheese. It was so easy to  make too.

What a great recipe! I found a terrific sale on fresh Spinach and Chicken on my way home from work and was grateful to have found this one. This recipe was perfect, quick and easy. We cooked the orzo in chicken broth like others mentioned and recommend it highly. It was a bit 'kicky', but that could have been from the heavy hand of my husband when I wasn't looking:)

I enjoyed this recipe last night and it was very good, I had never had orzo before and found it to be light and yummy.  As suggested I cooked in in chicken broth.  The whole thing was yummy.  The one thing I did differntly is I browned my chicken half way so it would have color took it out of the skillet then added my garlic/onions then threw the chicken back in with the orzo. Yummo!  Try it you will like it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.   I added just a little more red pepper for extra kick and it was great.  There were no leftovers, which was kind of disappointing, but I will be making this again.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was good but was missing something.  I doubled the spinach.  I also added a little lemon juice and lemon zest.  It helped but it was still a little bland.  The next time I make it I will probably add some more spices or make a sauce or something to add to the flavor.

I followed the recipe this first time and the family liked it a lot. I gave 4 stars only because my kids thought it was a little spicy so I might decrease red pepper next time but my husband and I loved it as is.

Great recipe. I browned the chicken in truffle oil for a little extra flavor and cooked the orzo in chicken stock, as well. Since there are only two of us, there is enough to freeze for another meal. Love it!

It was a simple dish with a nice kick to give it flavor.  I poured a little white wine & cream into the skillet for a richer flavor, but it's great as written.

I was really excited about this recipe and I took all others reviews. I cooked the orzo in chicken broth, I added more garlic, I also added zucchini. Maybe I just don't like orzo....it was too mushy. Despite the mush I thought the chicken would make up for it. It did not. I am not even sure how to adjust this recipe. I will not be making this again.

Used canned chicken (4 cans) with 1/2 of the juice drained, and sautéed it with garlic powder to save time. Omitted the spinach since no one in my family likes it, and added 1 can of cream of chicken soup to make the recipe a little creamier. Turned out great and everyone liked it. Did have a bit too much salt, so will omit that the next time I make it. ??

I used chicken broth to cook the orzo, added extra garlic, extra red pepper and some Italian seasoning. Even with these changes I found the flavor lacking.  It is just kind of blah.

Really, really enjoyed this meal. Instead of crushed red pepper flakes I used a dash or two of Cayenne Pepper, and I cooked the orzo in chicken broth. I also added regular italian seasoning ontop of the parsley, and didn't have any spinach(which i regret as that would've made it even better). Overall though this dish was a huge hit. I also probably used more garlic than it called for as I did minced garlic and then added more garlic powder. Will definitely be making again.

This was tasty. I cooked the orzo in vegetable broth instead of water.

This makes a great base recipe. A few hits with the spice weasel and I think you'd be good to go!

Pretty bland. Cooked orzo in chicken stock, added extra garlic. I ended up using rooster sauce and hubby used Worcestershire to add flavor. Next time I'll omit spinach and add tomatoes

This recipe is so easy to make, which is very important for me, as I'm really not a great cook.  The meal is so light and very flavourful! I took the chicken broth advice per the earlier reviews, as well as added some cherry tomatoes and kept the spinach. It went down a hit, and I will be making this again very soon!!

Easy, quick, and yummy. I made the orzo in chicken broth and used 2 chicken breasts, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. For a healthy, easy recipe, I give it 5 stars.

I added another 1/4 cup of orzo, because I love it, and used pre-cooked chicken (so paranoid about cooking chicken) and another 2 tablespoons of oil (since I used more orzo)> Also some dried onion onion from tastefully simple. It was delish. I was very impressed with this new dish, it's going into our rotation.

Followed it to the tee and it was very easy to make.  The only thing I did was drizzle some olive oil over everything on my plate when I served it because I love having olive oil on my orzo.  definitely something to throw in the mix when you want a light and healthy dinner

I love this recipe and I like that it is versatile and you can throw in whatever veggies you have on hand. I used fresh tomatoes, carrots and broccoli. I also mixed the Parmesan into the dish - used about double what the recipe called for. The other thing I love about this is it is a quick and easy one-dish meal.

In theory, this is a great recipe. However when it comes to seasonings, I found it flawed.  First of all, I used lemon pepper instead of crushed pepper. That was purely subjective because my dinner guest doesn't like red pepper. I followed the recipe to the letter and when it was done, I found it very bland and dry. I added more olive oil, Badia coarse garlic powder and parsley (a saving grace for any meal), some fresh basil a dash of lemon juce and more lemon pepper. I then put the burner on simmer for 30 minutes while we had cocktails. This brought all of the flavors together and it was perfect. I plated it on a bed of collards rather than spinach. Again, purely subjective.  The bitterness of the collards was the perfect compliment to the sweetness of the lemon.

Have made this a few times and not only is it a good dinner, the leftovers make a great lunch! I use a bit more parmesan and fold it directly into the orzo. I have also used feta and added a squeeze of lemon juice. Nice easy recipe! Thank you!

I cooked the orzo in low-sodium chicken broth, used roughly 3 cloves of garlic (1 regular clove and 1 enormous clove, so more than 2), but I am just not real impressed with this recipe. I added Italian seasoning and the parmesan cheese and that helped, but still not an amazing recipe....Bummer. I'm sure I could tweak it a bunch and make it better, but I'd rather work with a recipe that has more flavor.

Amazing delicious flavorful.  I cooked the orzo in chicken broth.  I used 4 cloves of FRESH PRESSED garlic.  I used a 1/2 T of red pepper flakes and about 1/2 C of olive oil and sizzled the garlic til fragrant and added 4 portions of vaccuum-sealed Pollock from the freezer aisle and cooked until done.  Right before adding the spinach, I added 1T of fresh basil.  Then I added the 2C of washed spinach and kale mixed (you MUST try this variant also!!).  I let the spinach wilt and timed the orzo to be added at the moment the spinach wilts (less than 5 minutes will do the trick).  Add the 1C of cooked orzo (makes a bunch) and you have a main course for 4.  Topped it with fresh grated parmesan and MORE grated fresh pepper.  So amazing, I don't think a single piece of orzo was left.  I wish I had bread or salad but this was just FINE as a main course.

This is a great recipe as is and modifying it also. I think next time I will add the spinach before the orzo though. And the time after that, I will add some chicken stock, double the pepper flakes & garlic (we like spicy) and steam some broccoli and/or asparagus. Any veggie will do! Thank so much, it's great!

EASY/quick recipe! I also boiled the orzo in chicken broth, which made it tasty. next time i won't drain the remaining broth and will just add it to the chicken to soak up.  Ill also add more garlic and try rosemary or basil and splash it with lemon next time.

My family REALLY liked this one. I followed some of the suggestions to improve the flavor, plus I used (fresh) lemon juice at the end. My son even told me the next day that he really liked 'last night's' dinner - and that's a true compliment coming from him!

I could only give 3 stars for my first try at this recipe.  I will try this again and try to enfuse a little more flavor into it.  Mostly it was the orzo.  My daughter who normally likes dishes w/orzo just didn't like it at all.  I followed recipe, but just didn't turn out quite as expected.  I think I will sub. ck. or turk. sausage in place of breast.  And, try to flavor up the orzo a little more.  I will rate again after further experimentation.  Of course........then it wouldn't be THIS recipe, but I will try to keep it as close as I can without seeming like a whole new recipe.

This is an awesome dish.  I made one change and on the last step actually cooked in some parmesan cheese then topped with a little more. It was perfect.  The family loved it.

Wow!!!  I loved this and the fact that the only fat in it is from the olive oil (oh and some parmesan, my bad).  I upped the garlic cloves to 4 and probably added more red pepper (I like spicy food) and more spinach, because I love it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Thuoght it was a bit dry so I added a bit of white wine and a little chix broth. Would probably be super with a little alfrado too.

This gets 5 stars for being so easy but it was a bit bland for me.  Next time I'll use chicken broth for the orzo (should have read the reviews before cooking), and maybe add sausages.

Really thought this was a great recipe, the next time I think I would cook the orzo in chicken broth and add some lemon for more flavor.  I also would add a little more orzo, spinach and chicken, for I found that the recipe was a little small for 4 people, since I wasn't serving anything else with it.  It was a great hit with the family, so a big thumbs up for sharing this recipe.

I thought this was ok. I cooked the orzo in broth and added about a half tub of Philly cooking cream garlic and herb, which helped boost the flavor.

Followed others suggestions: cooked orzo in broth, used wine to deglaze pan and added ALOT more garlic. Used fresh parsley, oregano and some rosemary (only because son brought the wrong herb from the garden!). Used brocolli and spinach. Thought this still needed more spices. Good basic recipe even with the changes but may not be a hit at my house. Kids will eat it, my 3 teenage boys eat anything and are not picky..... but voted it needed more flavor. Kinda ho-hum.

Six enthusiastic thumbs up!!! (there are three of us) I wanted to go a little Greek with this so I added Oregano while cooking the chicken and feta just after the spinach wilted before removing from heat. Oh yeah, and due to not realizing my crushed red pepper does NOT have a shaker top, I ended up at least doubling the crushed red pepper, but it was just right for us. Last alteration is I added two cubes of chicken bullion cubes to the boiling Orzo water while it was cooking since I didn't have any chicken broth hanging around.

This recipe was really good.  I added diced yellow onion when I sauted the garlic and red pepper flakes and deglazed the pan using a small amount of chicken stock. I also used frozen spinach versus fresh.  It still turned out really wonderful.  Both my husband and my dad (who can be really picky) ate every bite and told me how good this was.  We added this recipe to the keeper pile and will definantly fix again.

This is VERY good I duobled the recipe and wish I would have made even more! I did as suggested and boiled orzo in chicken broth. I also didn't add chicken to the orzo because I was using this as a side item to chicken I had already made.

This recipe is extremely versatile and very tasty! The first time I made it, it definitely could have used some salt, so make sure you salt the orzo to taste while sauteing. I also used chicken stock, and left out the spinach and Parmesan. The second time I made it with the spinach, and used shrimp instead of chicken and served it with tilapia... yum!

I made this awhile ago and it was alright.  I just made it again tonight and it was even better.  I didn't have any spinach the first time I made it, the addition of the spinach made a differance.  It was fairly quick and easy and I used shaved parmesan cheese and added cracked pepper on top which was great.

This recipe is great the only thing is that I LOVE garlic and in this recipe, there just isn't enough. I triple the garlic and add just a touch more red pepper flakes. Also I cook the chicken before adding the garlic... lf you like your garlic, I recommend this.

My husband really liked this, but I thought it was kind of bland. I followed other suggestions and added extra garlic and tried to season it with other seasonings, but still thought it was bland. Adding diced tomatoes with italian seasoning helped quite a bit. Will probably not make this again.

this was very good. i gave it a five star to try to get it out of the 4 posistion. if you follow a couple of the reveiws like boil orzo in broth and add more garlic and peper to taste it comes out great. i also added a little bit of white wine to chicken while cooking to add a little more depth. no tomatoes on hand, but will add next time.

This was good and I will probably make it again.  I didn't give this 5 stars because it doesn't knock your socks off, but its a good and easy side dish.  When I make it again I will probably use wine as someone suggested to deglaze the chicken and may add more parmesan to the dish rather than just a topping to add some more flavor.  I did cheat and use canned chicken which may have affected the dish's outcome, but like I said-it was easy and good.  Overall a light dish that seemed healthy.

We love spicy, but the red pepper flakes were too much, so I will reduce those.  I also will leave out the spinach.  The dish was very good, but I did use 3 chicken breasts.

This was really quick and tasted good.  We're not huge fans of heat though, so I'll reduce the amount of red pepper flakes next time.  I prepared the orzo with a can of chicken broth and a can of FF cream of celery soup to add some creaminess.  Good weeknight meal!

I thought this was really enjoyable, light and healthy. I didn't think it was too bland but I did cook the orzo in chicken broth instead of water and upped the garlic count a bit.

Admittedly, I was using tofu instead of chicken, but this came out not only bland, but downright bitter. I had rescue it with a sweet red sauce.

Good dish! A little on the spicy side but I definately enjoyed it. There was something missing but I couldn't put my finger on it. Next time I am going to try putting cherry tomato halves and diced onion in it.

Really yummy! It was too spicy for my kids though! My hubby loved it, to my suprise! I added double the amount of minced garlic & a little basil too. I also added cooked broccoli & carrots & it was a great main dish! I didnt' have to serve anything else with it! It seemed like there was something missing though. The flavor was a bit lacking. I added some lemon juice too. Anyway, a good dish still!

I made this recipe for my family who hates anything green.  I love fresh spinach in my dish.  So since it calls for fresh parsley, I chopped the spinach up in small pieces and when asked what all the green stuff was, I just told them it was parsley for seasoning.  My husband would be furious if he knew I fed him spinach ;)

This is such a great recipe! The variations are only limited to your imagination! I used 3 parts chicken broth and 1 part water to cook the orzo. I had a leek that needed using so I sauteed it with the chicken. I didn't have spinach so I used arugula (YUM) and I added a fresh diced tomato for color and topped with a little shaved parmesan. This dish is light and packed with flavor. Can't wait to try it with shrimp. Great recipe, will use again and again.

This was a great combination. I added Garlic Salt Pepper to it to add more flavor. This was a great recipe because I had some Orzo noodles but I could never think of what to do with them, now I do thanks!

I always like to try recipes first the way they are written. It was good, although a little bland. In the future, I will do as some of the other reviewers have suggested and add more garlic and a can of diced tomatoes. It would be a very easy recipe to adjust to your own taste though. Will definitely make again!

This is a 5 star recipe with some slight modifications. I took others advice and cook the orzo in chicken broth, which makes a huge difference. I also season the chicken breast with Magic Chef poultry seasoning and pepper. I increase the garlic to 5-6 cloves (we love garlic in our house) and add a little more crushed red pepper. Great healthy recipe that has become a staple in my kitchen.

Hubby made this for dinner, it was really good but my only suggestion is to salt the water like the sea as Mario Batali.  Lightly salting = under seasoned orzo.

I made this by following the instructions exactly. It turned out to be just okay. I didn't think that it was spicy. It must have had a little heat to it because my son didn't want any part of it. It was pretty quick and simple to make.

This was fast and simple to make with things I have in my pantry.  I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception being that I cooked the orzo in chicken stock instead of water.  I thought it was a decent economical meal.  It was a tad on the spicy side which I was surprised about.  If you don't have a spicy pallet I would cut the red pepper down to 1/8 t or your might find it very spicy.  I would probably give this 3.5 stars if they let me.  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe but not into hot & spicy so I used poultry seasoning for the chicken instead then added cherry tomatoes. Took others advice and cooked the orzo in 3 cups chicken broth. When the orzo was almost done, I added a bag of baby spinach and some of the sauteed garlic from the chicken. When the spinach was absorbed, I added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese into the orzo. Yummy!

This was a nice, healthy dish. But it was pretty bland and unremarkable. In the future I may try adding more or different veggies to make it more substantive.

Very tasty.  I added sundried tomatoes to the garlic & hot pepper mixture and used some of the olive oil from the tomato marinade to cook the garlic and the chicken.  Used frozen (thawed) spinach instead of fresh.

This was an excellent and easy meal that even my husband enjoyed.  The only modifications I made were that I added a splash of italian dressing to the chicken and a bit of butter with the rice to make my hubby happy.  I also used an itlaian cheese blend rather than just parm. The hubby is generally so picky that he won't take leftovers for lunch but this one he did.  This will become a regular at our house.

I have to agree that this would be a VERY boring recipe if made as the recipe originally says.  However, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and made some additions.  In the end it actually turned out pretty good, but something still seems to be missing.  Here's what I added to the original:  For the orzo, I cooked it in a mix of broth and water.  (I would recommend all broth.  I didn't have enough on hand.)  When cooking the chicken, I seasoned it with Italian seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder and cooked it in a mix of olive oil, a little butter and white wine.  To make it a complete meal, I thought it needed more veggies, so I added some onion, mushrooms, red pepper, extra spinach and tossed in some small grape tomatoes toward the end.  I will probably make it again, but need to do some thinking on what to do to make it a little more flavorful.

Very good, super easy and cheap. I added a can of diced tomatoes w/basil for a little more color.  I also doubled the recipe and made enough dinner and then lunch for the next couple days.

I have made this a few times and think with enough little changes have finally mastered this recipe. Here is my revised version:
Ingredients

1 cup uncooked orzo pasta 
16 ounces Broth  
2 tablespoons olive oil 
4 cloves garlic: minced or crushed 
1 tbls crushed red pepper 
2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces 
salt to taste 
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley  
4 cups fresh spinach leaves 
grated Parmesan cheese for topping 
Optional - 1 cup mushrooms 

Directions
Bring a large pot of broth to a boil. Add orzo pasta, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain almost all broth. Season raw cut-up chicken with seasoned salt (and old bay if you have any). Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the garlic and red pepper (and mushrooms if you use them) 1 minute or until garlic is golden brown. Stir in chicken and cook 2 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned and juices run clear. Reduce heat to medium, and mix in the parsley and cooked orzo. Place spinach in the skillet. Continue cooking 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until spinach is wilted. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.

I really enjoyed this and so did my husband. I love one dish meals that have your protein, carbs and veggies in it. I think next time I will add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to liven it up a little more. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Thought this was a good, simple and quick meal to fix.  I added the a chopped tomato to it and would recommend it.  It is a good base that you can tweak to your liking.

Overall it's a good base recipe that allows for a lot of personal touches.  I took the advice of others and cooked the orzo in chicken broth.  The chicken was bland for our taste even with some seasoning added.  The next time I make this, I'm going to try using my chicken cutlets that have more seasoning in the bread crumbs.

I really loved this recipe because it was so easy and quick to make, not to mention very tasty.  The only modification I made was to cook the pasta in a mix of chicken broth and water.  I made this for my husband who's a chef and even he enjoyed it, he said it was light and flavorful :)  I will be making this again for sure.

We're trying to eat healthier and this fits right into my plan: no cheese, cream, or butter.  My husband loved it, as did I.  Because of what I had on hand I used broken whole wheat linguini instead of orzo, canned tomatoes instead of spinach, yellow bell peppers (because I originally misread "red pepper flakes"), and added some Tabasco sauce.

This was a great one dish meal.  I cooked the orzo in chicken stock, and didn't drain it before adding to the rest of the mix.  Also, increased the amount of garlic, salt and peppered the chicken directly, and added a little bit of chopped bell pepper and mushrooms when I put the chicken in.  Also, I don't think that the spinach needs more then a couple of minutes in the pot.  All in all, lots of flavor, and my 3 year old ate it so I'm happy.  I'll make this again. Thanks!

This was wonderful and so easy. I made it following the orginal recipe, but I think next time I will cook the orzo in chicken broth and try some seafood in it. I also used asiago cheese instead of the parm and it really added some more flavor.

Thanks for this fantastic recipe! As did a previous reviewer, I also used fresh basil and it was fantastic! Don't leave out the red pepper flakes. They give this recipe a nice zip! I think I might add some fresh sauteed mushrooms next time. What a great recipe to play with!

We cooked our chicken with a spicy rub on a charcoal grill instead and it tasted awesome.  Will definitely make again.

Not bad - has a subtle flavor to it but still a nice kick to it as well.  Used half the amount of oil, a generous shake of Italian seasoning instead of parsley, and threw in some tomatoes.

this is a family favorite after a little bit of jazzing up, if you add half of an onion finely diced to the garlic with crushed red pepper, with a little extra of each, and some dried parsley before you add the chicken it's a better. then instead of grated parm cheese, i use the italian shredded mix with romano. be sure to cut back on the oil.

I read what some of the other reviewers said about the dish being bland. I made quite a few modifications including adding chicken stock to the boiling water, as well as all of my spices. I cooked the orzo with the spices to try and add some flavor. Then I cooked the chicken separately on the grill using the same spices, minus the red pepper. I was very generous with quantities in both situations. After the orzo was done, I topped it with the grilled chicken. It turned out delicious. My boyfriend, who hates chicken, ate so much he couldn't move :)

As it is written, so very bland. It is beyond frustrating to make a recipe with this many stars to find out in the reviews that almost everyone added to it. Therefore the rating given is not for this recipe at all.

I have made this many times. The recipe is good as written but only gets better by making it your own. Husbands favorite is with 1 tsp oregano, extra garlic, black olives, half a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and feta cheese ( as suggested by another reviewer). I also cook orzo in chicken broth for extra flavor. Very easy recipe that can be thrown together quickly with items on hand.

Doubled the garlic. Used a tablespoon of butter with olive oil. Boiled the orzo as many others did in Chicken/Garlic broth. Didn't have spinach so just skipped it. Had steamed asparagus for the side greens.

Fast and easy and tastes delicious! I love dishes that tastes this good and give you meat, veg and starch in a single entree! I used a bag of Tyson diced grilled chicken to make it even easier.

I followed other reviewer suggestions and boiled orzo with something other than plain water. I used beef bouillon because that’s all I had on hand and it was delicious! I skipped the peppers because I have little ones and substituted cilantro in place of parsley and that pushed it over the edge for us! It was super delicious and a new staple in the household!

After reading the reviews definitely used chicken broth to boil the noddles. It makes a BIG DIFFERENCE.  I added fresh red peppers. I seasoned the chicken with Himalayan salt and black pepper . It was delicious! Awesome recipe . It allows room for exploring and still taste good

I did boil the orzo in chicken broth versus water for extra flavor. I did use 3 garlic cloves versus one.  I added about 1/2 tsp of oregano when adding the parsley and tossed it good.  I also added a cup of halfed kalamata olives and feta cheese for more of a Greek flavor.  My family loved it!

This was a very easy recipe that worked out well for a weeknight meal.  3/3 thought it needed salt but it's a great start - it just needs something besides crushed red pepper to kick up the flavor.

I'm giving this 5 stars even as written, mainly for how easy and tasty it is.   Also 5 stars for the  versatility of this recipe and the suggestions of various meats/proteins and vegetables that can change according to your taste, mood, or refrigerator contents! Based on earlier reviews, I made a few changes which we all loved, even my extremely finicky 13 year old. 

I began by sautéing garlic (used LOTS because we love it) in olive oil and a little butter.  Added the crushed red pepper and sautéed a little longer, then the cubed, seasoned chicken.  I also added some sun-dried tomatoes and the parsley & spinach just to wilt when chicken was nearly finished.  I removed the chicken & veggies to a bowl, added about 4 cups chicken broth to the same pan, brought to boil and added the orzo.  I think it's really important to use the same pan as the chicken was cooked in, deglaze with broth and cook orzo in that liquid to add flavor.    I allowed orzo to cook until al dente, or slightly softer and almost all the liquid was absorbed.  I added a splash of white wine & returned the chicken mixture to heat for a minute or two.   After dishing up on plates, I topped with parmesan cheese.

Loved it. Someone said they made this like their linguine with clams and I agree. I used a whole bottle of dry white wine and a box of low sodium chicken stock to cook the orzo in. I also added slide grape tomatoes, pan seared before adding garlic and red pepper. No additional salt necessary!

Good, but a bit dry.  Sprinkled a bit of olive oil over the top before adding the parmesan cheese.  Husband said it was good.

I had really high hopes for this recipe; I had found a similar one except it was vegetarian. I was very disappointed. The spinach  is overpowering. Something about the combination of scents of the red pepper, garilc, and spinach is pungent and unappealing and really makes your breath smell afterwards. I wouldn't make this again.

Very good main course meal.  Did as others suggested using chicken broth (2 cups), also added sugar snap peas and organic garlic seasoning.  Will make again.

I will make it again but will probably boil the orzo in chicken broth. Felt it needed a little more seasoning/flavor. Add more spinach too. It wilts down to nothing. All in all a good, easy dish.

I have now tried this with a couple different variations and it is easy to tailor to your specific palate. Personally I enjoy a bit more garlic and red pepper flakes and just depending on the day I may also include some diced tomatoes though it does introduce more liquid to the concoction.

Deleted the spinach....didn't have any.  Added Italian seasoning.  It was very good, easy to make.  Next time will add just a little lemon juice at the end to brighten the flavors!

I made this recipe as-is.  The chicken did have a nice kick, but overall the dish was bland for me.   I think I will make this dish again, but next time double or even triple the spinach and cooke the orzo in chicken broth instead of water.  This is a great diner for the night before a tough workout!

Even though I messed it up, I will give this recipe the benefit of the doubt. I tried to make it in a slow cooker and the pasta turned to mush.  As long as I've been cooking, I should have known better. However, it was still very good.

I cooked this twice and while the first one turned a little bland(i only used chicken stock to cook the orzo pasta) the second one turned out fantastic. For the second trial, I took Suzy's suggestion and saute the garlic until golden brown and then added chicken stock to cook orzo pasta. Whoever trying this recipe, you have to do this before you cook orzo. And also, try not to overcook orzo. That would turn everything down.

This was good! I cooked the orzo in water seasoned with Better than Bouillon. I used diced cooked chicken from my freezer as well as frozen spinach because it's what I had. I doubled the garlic. I kept tasting and adding salt. At the end, I put parmesan on top, put the lid on, and allowed it to melt. This was a really good 1-dish meal, not at all bland as other reviewers said.

I cooked the orzo in chicken broth and added 1/3 cup of the pasta broth while adding the orzo to the chicken. I also used 2 heaping teaspoons of minced garlic rather than 2 cloves of garlic.  I think adding the pasta broth added flavor as well as made it a little more moist.  It was an easy dish to make and I will definitely make it again.

The adults and kids all enjoyed this dish.  I could tell as the chicken was finishing & I was about to add the cooked orzo that the dish would be dry, so I quickly made 1/2 cup chicken broth in the microwave with bouillon, and added that just before the spinach.  After letting it simmer, I could tell I would want it a bit creamier, so I added a bit of half & half (maybe 1/4 cup) & stirred everything together, then added the cheese, stirring again before serving. It will definitely be in our rotation!

I had a few cherry tomatoes so added them for a pop freshness.  I also added thyme and rosenary.  Will do it with shrimp next time.  Fast and easy and GOOD.  Will definitely make it again.  This dish could go Mexican, Italian or Asian easily.  Try it !!!

I made this using cut up pork chops.  It was so good that I cannot wait to make it again with chicken.  I was a bit concerned when i was making it that there was no gravy or sauce but it just did not need it.  My husband and I gobbled it all down.  No leftovers!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, because I've learned to read allot of the reviews first.  I get really irritated & disappointed in those of you who give 5's & 4's for a recipe & then basically change or add more seasonings & different ones.  Come on COOKS, rate it as written NOT as you've changed it to suit your likes!!!

doubled the garlic which I crushed up, sprinkled crushed red pepper and chipotle flakes on the chicken and put it all in the crockpot. sprinkled a bit of spicy sriracha oil over it and cooked it until it was done. Then added 1/2 c. uncooked orzo pasta until it was done. Tasty dish

I followed the recipe and it seems to be too much garlic and that was from my son in law who loves garlic.  The recipe doesn't say how many it feeds. I would have doubled it for my family of four.  No salt in the recipe. it just seems to be missing something. I think the recipe has potential but needs work.  I'm not sure what it is missing but its just not finished working out the details. I did like the noodles which I have never had.I liked the parsley and spinach but the other recipe she developed this from had small tomatoes cut in half and I think that would compliment this recipe also.

This dish was good, I had to improvise.  I used shrimp and scallops instead of chicken.  I only had one can of chicken broth and one can of beef, I used what I had.  I only had frozen spinach and that's what I used.  It still came out delicious.  I will make it again using the correct ingredients.

I made a few changes. I browned the chicken in grass fed butter and garlic and seasoned it with salt and pepper. I also browned the orzo then boiled it till it was  al dente. Afterwards, I combined the orzo and chicken and added a little bit of chicken bouillon and cayenne pepper and some broccoli. The husband loved it!

I made it and it did not disappoint.  It freezes well and tastes just as good when it is re-heated in the microwave oven.  Best to thaw in refrigerator before microwaving though.  Microwaving from frozen is not as good.  I will make it again.

This is delicious!  It was a blustery snowy day and I wanted to make something easy, tasty and with minimal clean up.  I had all the ingredients, or thought I did.  When I looked for my Orzo, I couldn't find it so I had to find a substitute  because I didn't want to go out.  I used large pearl Israeli couscous which I cooked in chicken broth.  It was really good and this is a recipe which will go in my "tried and true" file.

This was a tasty and easy meal to prepare.  I want to try this with different pasta and some other veggies.  I followed other people's advice and cooked the orzo in chicken stock.  Added a small amount of butter to it in the end.  I used more chicken and cut and seasoned it the night before (salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, garlic).    When cooking the chicken, I also sprinkled some basil and rosemary in.    In the end, I had a creamy and spicy dish that I liked.  My only issue was that I didn't salt the orzo enough, since I have to watch my salt intake, so there was a little something missing.  Next time I will have to experiment.

Just "stuffed" myself on this recipe.  Followed directions with only changes being 3 garlic cloves, sprinkle of Italian seasoning, drizzles - extra olive oil & chicken broth.  Will consider doubling up the recipe for a party next week!

Ok. Some tricks. Greeks use orzo a lot. Do NOT over cook is first. You can undercook firm. It will cook more and quickly when you add to chicken. Definitely use lemon juice. It brightens all the flavors. I’d use Parm and Romano. I’d also sauté the spinach slightly in butter and garlic before tossing it in. 
I grew up with orzo tossed in roasted lamb juices with a bit of chunky tomato sauce sautéed in the lamb juices. Yum!

This is a good basic, starter recipe, but I do agree that it is a bit bland as written.  I will definitely spice it up the next time I make it, most likely with Sriracha.  Using broth or seasoning the water while boiling might also be good.  It's not bad, it just needs a little adjusting for more flavor.

Because so many people were saying this is so bland, I decided to use some of their recommendations the first time I made it.  I added a whole onion (chopped),  doubled the garlic, and used Italian seasoning (about 1/2 a tsp). I also boiled the orzo in the Better Than Bouillon roasted chicken base.  I did include the crushed red pepper that is called for in the recipe. With the changes I made, the recipe is EXCELLENT, but still a little bland. Next time, I will add a little more red pepper (a 1/2 tsp), and/or add pepper.  I usually add pepper to everything but decided not to this time.  I think it definitely needs a little pop.  My 16 yr old son still ate 2 helpings, so this definitely is a good recipe, but it just needs a little tweaking.  Adding red or green peppers, mushrooms, etc. would be good, too! And by the way, this is so easy to make and takes little time!

Simple prep that is perfect for weeknights.  I added garlic powder  and used Perdue chicken shortcuts. I also sauteed the garlic with some extra cloves.

The basic recipe is a great start. I added green and red peppers, onions, and doubled the garlic. Also used some Italian seasoning and topped the dish with fresh basil. Big yum! Even my picky husband said it was a keeper.

I found this same recipe on another site but  it was for Chicken, Orzo and Spinich soup.  I made the soup and my family ate it up, not a drop left over.  You cook all of the ingredients just like this recipe says and after cooking add to 8 cups of chicken broth, put the orzo in the broth and cook for 9 minutes and then let sit for 10 mins before serving.  Top with the cheese before serving.

I used the modified version of this recipe, per the most popular comment - using chicken stock & garlic for the orzo and sauteing the chicken separately in shallots, garlic, red pepper flakes, & olive oil. The orzo turned out really good! The chicken-to-orzo ratio was too much, though, I would certainly double or even triple the orzo next time I make this. Despite the fact that I sauteed the chicken in shallots, garlic, red pepper flakes, & olive oil, I still felt like the chicken lacked flavor and was kind of bland. Might have been better if I had cut the chicken into even tinier pieces (smaller than bite size) so that they blended into the orzo better.

This is a keeper! I tweeked it just a little from reading other reviews, didn't have any chicken broth so I cooked my orzo with a couple boullion cubes, drained some of the water, but not all. I also added a couple lemon wedges and a splash of white wine and fresh basil to my chicken and garlic. Looking forward to adding some cherry tomatoes next time!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe as printed.  I did, however,  finely chopped the garlic and omitted the red pepper (husband doesn't like).  Since I have never made orzo before, I boiled it in water for only about 10 min. and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't measure my spinach but it covered a 6-inch plate so it may have been at least 2 cups.  I did cover the skillet after I added the spinach so it would wilt faster.  In any event, we really liked this dish and I will definitely make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the chicken had a lot of flavor but the pasta was definitely bland.  I'll take the reviewers' advice and cook in chicken broth next time for more flavor.  I'm not a spinach person so I did pick some leaves out of my portion but my husband liked them.  Overall it was an easy, healthy meal.

Very good, and I will make this again.

I took some hints from the comments. I stuck to the receipt except I added crushed basil, oregano, and I added half a can of Rotel (Mild) diced tomatoes. 

If you do not like spicy food, this does have a kick to it, so just do not use the red pepper. If you like moderate spicy, like me, this is great.

I gave it four stars because it was great! (My mouth didn't need therapy after it, so not five stars)
On using chicken broth for the orzo instead of water: I used 2 cans (14.5 oz each) of Swanson's chicken broth, brought it to a boil and added the whole box (16oz) of orzo.Let boil for 5 minutes then turned to low and let it simmer for another 5, stirring regularly from the start. Comes out creamy and delicious!

Used pre-cooked, marinated chicken (soulvaki flavored).  Boiled orzo in chicken broth.  Sauted mushrooms, then added garlic with spinach and then dumped everything into that pan.  Added chicken broth and a little more olive oil and Italian seasoning for flavor and to create a sauce.  Stirred in parmesan.

Nice base recipe. I made some changes based on the recommendations here... 

Used Chicken Broth instead of water, used more garlic, etc. 

In addition, I also added Sun-Dried Tomatoes and some dried italian blend seasoning and it was delightful.

Good quick recipe but rather bland. I’m giving this 4 stars because my children ate the entire thing. I sautéed a half of diced onion along with the garlic then added the chicken.  I suggest seasoning the chicken prior to cooking for additional flavor.  I saved some of the salted pasta cooking water  and was glad I did because my chicken skillet was dry. Next time I make this I am going to add 2 more cloves of garlic and a can of diced tomatoes.

It was too bland.  The chicken needs more flavor, perhaps by marinading it in lemon juice and olive oil, or maybe in a chili sauce.  

Any suggestions?

Was looking for something new and healthier and found this dish. Like others I did tweak the recipe a little.  I added extra garlic and cooked it with the chicken. Also cooked the orzo in chicken broth, retained the broth after draining then added some back when serving. I added the rest of the broth to the leftovers. This worked well. Orzo soaked much of it up overnight. A great tasting dish both the first time around and the next day.

Simple, quick recipe. I cooked the orzo in chicken broth, as suggested by other reviewers, but I did not let it soak up all the broth. I cooked it al dente. I also added thinly sliced onion, red bell pepper and steamed fresh green beans. I let the vegetables sauté with the garlic, then cooked the chicken separately. Then I added the veggies to the chicken and topped with the orzo. Excellent!  This is my work lunches for the week.

This was OK as written, but 5 stars with the modifications: chicken broth, onion, more red pepper, rosemary.  Be sure to keep the proportions/ratio between orzo, chicken and spinach.

A great start for a great dinner!  It was just 4 stars to me as written as I felt it sounded a bit bland.  I added 2 tablespoons fresh, chopped basil, about 3/4 tsp. dried oregano,  and 1/4 tsp. lemon pepper seasoning.  With those additions it became a 5-star recipe.  I love the spinach with the chicken and parmesan cheese and orzo.  It came together very quickly; perfect for a weeknight dinner.

I took the poster's advice and tried it with shrimp. The reason for my lack of stars was because my husband didn't like the dish. He didn't finish his plate, which is surprising as he loves shrimp and pasta dishes.  Even my two toddlers ate this. I was worried it was a bit spicy for them, but they finished their plate. I followed on of the reviewer's tips to cook the orzo in chicken broth, and I think it helped immensely.

I wasn't impressed by any means. Felt like it was missing something. I'm not sure what though.

This is a great dish! Next time I will put more garlic. There's not enough garlic for me. (It's a garlic recipe) I will put more spinach to.

This is delicious and is easily one of my favorite regular meals I’ve found on Allrecipes. My only modification is that I’d at least double if not triple the amount of garlic used.

I made this and omitted the spinach. I love spinach, but my family does not. I thought the recipe was good, but my family absolutely loved it. I will make it again because it was so easy and because everyone liked it and ate it.

I added the juice of half a lemon the same time I added the chicken. We loved it! The only other comment I have is that it isn't very spicy. You may want to add more red pepper flakes to your liking. Definitely will make again!

Only 2 garlic cloves and still very garlicky. I like that but be prepared. Only thing I would change is beefing up the spinach. Will make great leftovers also. Yum!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water and used less of it and didn't drain it to make the pasta creamier.  It still seemed a little bland, so I added some white wine and lemon juice.  It was okay, but nothing special.

Really liked it, but think will tweak after  reading reviews.  Will toast orzo in dry skillet, chicken stock subbed for water, use less oil,  add tomatoes.  Won't add pepper but count on lemon juice for a little more flavor.  Thanks so much for reviews - I learn so much from each of you!

Everyone loved it, even my extremely picky (and brutally honest) sister. It was quick and easy to make. I see a lot of reviews suggesting cooking the pasta in chicken broth, which is the same idea I had. I used a little bit of Mrs. Dash, garlic salt, and chicken seasoning in addition to the chili flakes and it turned out very flavorful! I will definitely make it again, I can't wait to test it out on my roommates!

Pretty good; I cooked the orzo in 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth like one review said and I didn't have to drain it. I also added freshly ground black pepper, peas at the end, and a little less of the red pepper flakes and it was still plenty spicy for my family, anyway. I agree with other reviewers that this could maybe use a little more garlic, herbs, etc.

Have read other people's comments about this being a bit bland I added not only onion but also chilly flakes to give it a bit more taste and it turned out really nice, although I have to be honest having brought orzo pasta to make this it would have been just as nice with rice from the cupboard

I've made this twice now and the family loves it.  I cooked the Orzo in broth for extra flavor and added some garlic salt when combining everything.  It's a simple easy meal  - even in the summer.

To start off with I sautéed the chicken and minced garlic and red peppers, removed  from pan, sautéed mushrooms, then onions and green peppers.  I then deglazed with whine wine , added chicken broth, brought it to a boil and added brocoli and orzo with a bit more minced garlic.   I would add more spices the next time.  The family really enjoyed it.

I followed the advice of several people and boiled the orzo in chicken broth, doubled the crushed red pepper, and added rosemary, oregano, and basil. It definitely had a nice flavor, but everyone in the family thought it was dry. It needs some sort of sauce, but I haven't quite figured out yet what will work with it.

I made slight modifications by following other reviews and cooking the orzo in chicken broth. It was still bland. I like it ok, but not my favorite recipe. Trying to think of other things to add to it for flavor.

Dig this base. I used more garlic and sauted with black truffle oil and lemon zest. Also cooked orzo in a veggie broth. Lots of black pepper and home dried peppers. Dried rosemary,fresh parsley and aged parmesan to finish. As soon as spinach wilted, added lemon juice.

Husband and I enjoyed this. I did the changes other raters did and did it all in one skillet. First sauted the garlic,red pepper and chicken in 1 1/2tblsp olive oil. Removed and then made the orzo with chicken broth. Added a handful of chopped roma tomatoes and lots of spinach . Added back the chicken and kept warm.

Two changes:  1 garlic clove instead of two and I lightly toasted the orzo in the pan along with garlic and red pepper flakes.
Delicious recipe!  Teens loved it. Simple and quick.

I love this recipe! I will add a little more garlic and more spinach next time. I didn't have orzo, so I substituted linguine and it was great. I saved a little bit of pasta water to make a little more sauce to finish wilting the spinach. So good!

I change around types of pasta plus the vegetables depending on my mood. Orzo despite looking like rice is pasta so any will do. Pasta is best with other ingredients especially vegetables.

Easy to make and easy to alter to your taste buds. I cooked the orzo in chicken broth as I always do, added more garlic, and added some of the cooked chicken broth to the frying pan with the chicken for an added broth to the meal. Can also add broccoli instead of spinach. Great and easy dish to keep as is or to alter to your taste!

This is really delicious!  I would use a little less chicken and a little more spinach.  I think I'll leave out the red pepper flakes next time.  Great recipe!

Garlicky Chicken:  I did not use the Orzo but used small eggs noodles instead and it was very good as the noodles sucked up all the olive oil and garlic.

Delicious, and so simple! I cooked the orzo in chicken broth as others had suggested, and threw in extra garlic and crushed red pepper because, well, that's what I always do. I was concerned that there would be too much chicken for the amount of orzo, but the ratio was perfect. This is going to be my go to recipe, for sure!

This was amazing. I tweaked this recipe because I'd read all the reviews that said it ws bland. I did cook the Orzo in plenty of salted water-not chicken broth. I made 1.5 times the recipe because that's how much orzo I had left in the bag. I always use a lot of garlic-more than the recipe called for-but that's personal preference. After the chicken was finished cooking I squeezed about a tsp of lemon juice in the skillet. After adding the cooked orzo I added about a cup of shredded mozzarella and about a half cup of grated Parmesan before mixing in the spinach. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I added bacon, because well everything is better with it. Also added a sliced shallot and sprinkled Penzeys Fox Point seasoning on the chicken. I didn't have fresh spinach but did have asparagus, so I used that. And included some grated gruyere along with the Parmesan cheese.  Looks delicious, just waiting for hubby to come in from mowing and we will dig in.

just made this...not sure what I did wrong but I followed the recipe except took others advice and cooked the orzo in chicken broth.  it did absorb most of the broth but some of my orzo still stuck to the pan.  once I added everything together I had to add a little more water so that the orzo wouldn't stick again, and that helped.  I may make again as it was flavorful but not sure.

Made a few changes but it's a good start. O cooked the orzo in 3 cups  chicken broth. I added all of it, as there isn't much liquid left, for the pasta. I also added more garlic along with Mozzarella cheese. Threw in some sauteed brussel sprouts and a delicious meal!

I really liked this - it's a good, solid recipe that was enjoyed by adults and our three-year-old. I will say that it looks creamier in this picture than mine turned out. I ended up adding a little chicken boullion, basil, oregano, water and then mixed some of the parmesan right in with that to make it a little more flavorful and creamy. Very good!

My husband and I are picky eaters and have a hard time finding recipes that we like.  This is a quick, easy and yummy meal. I added 2xs the garlic and red pepper, and a little Italian seasoning and black pepper, as well as a third cup of spinach (a spinach and kale mix).  We will definitely be making this again.  But I will probably add even more spinach next time.

Don't think i've ever had Orzo so i had to try this....I Love it...I took advice from others and made the orzo with chicken broth ,milk and the spices...It turned out so creamy it was great with fresh spinach...I made the chicken how I usually make it though.. I season it and sear it on the stove top and finish it in the oven...really juicy...with the changes its a new favorite in this house....Thanks for the idea!!!

My, oh, my!!! This was so good! I've made it twice now so far but this is my first time rating this recipe. I used all the ingredients as stated but cooked the orzo in chicken broth and added a little squeeze of lemon. My husband and I were really wowed with this recipe. And it's easy, too. I will be making this as often as I can. There are so many delicious recipes on this site that I've made that I almost never use recipes from anywhere else. Thanks All Recipes and all you who submit so many wonderful recipes.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of cooking the orzo in chicken broth as recommended by another reviewer. I thought the recipe was easy to make and was very tasty. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe with some modifications.  I sauteed onion and mini yellow and red bell peppers in 1/2 the oil and added red chili flakes when they were softened.  Then I scooped out the onion and peppers and added the rest of the oild and sauteed the chicken with sea salt and pepper.  I cooked the orzo in water and fat free chicken broth.  I added the peppers and onions back into the chicken, added the orzo, and then the spinach.  Topped with some grated romano cheese. I salted along the way just to be careful to avoid over salting as well as keeping the dish well balanced with the veggies.   My husband loved it, will make again

This is a very easy, quick and inexpensive dinner. I upped the orzo to a cup and half and the chicken to 1.5 lbs so I could have lunch for two the next day. Definitely making this again.

This was okay, nice garlic taste. I used black pepper and cut out the red pepper flakes just a little, I should have used the whole bag of baby spinach as it sure did add color to an otherwise colorless dish.

I agree with many of the reviews in that the base of the recipe is good and it is quick to make but it needs some punch with additional flavors. I added more garlic and lemon.

By far one of my favorite dishes. It's very light and easy to make. The crushed red pepper adds the perfect amount of spice. This definitely made it to the dinner rotation!

Looking for healthier recipes for my family....this one was a big hit.  I will definitely make it again.  I did not add the red pepper flakes and I added a little extra parmesan cheese to the dish itself.

Ok, but pretty bland even after adding salt, pepper, lemon juice, and the cheese. Won't make again.

very good.  I added chicken bullion to the orzo after it was cooked.  Use the larger pan next time. 4/29/16 cooked chicken in broth seasoned with Allseason salt, onion and garlic powder. I used more pepper.  Use more than 1/2 cup of pasta and cook it longer than 9 mins.

When I make Orzo pasta as a main dish or a warm side dish I always cook it  this way : melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium size skillet, add 1 cup orzo, cook, stirring frequently until grains are just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of chicken broth and cook on medium low heat, stirring  often until all the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. At this point any precooked meat or vegetables can be added.
So that is the way I cooked my orzo for this recipe, and I added 8 oz sliced sautéed  mushrooms too. 
This way of cooking the pasta did not help how bland the chicken tasted though. If I make this recipe again, I might try marinating the chicken pieces in the garlic, pepper flakes and add some thyme, or rosemary and little bit of lemon juice.

Very good I made this when I was feeling under the weather and I could taste it especially the pepper flakes probably helped me. I added the broth to my skillet and cooked the orzo in it and added the spinach the last few minutes.I didn't feel up to chopping up garlic so I added 1 tb from the jar I love garlic.Thanks for posting.

Chicken is a little bland without extra seasoning, as per other reviews I cooked the orzo in chicken broth, be careful not to overcook. I  also added tomatoes instead of spinach to the chicken, pretty good recipe.

Solid choice for a weekday night. Easy to make, easily available ingredients, a hit with the kids. Made as is, except I added a third chicken breast half. It was barely enough for 4 people (including 2 young kids), so maybe double next time for left-overs.

I made it with an onion and yellow pepper sauteed with the garlic.  Then added the chicken and browned it, added a can of mild Rotel (will probably use original next time) before adding the orzo and spinach.

Simple dinner to make. I challenged myself to make a weeks worth of meal with only what I had on hand in the pantry,fridge and freezer. Might sound easy but we were low on staples and had no extra money. So I found this recipe to use the last pitiful amounts of garlic and spinach I had. The flavor was plenty, not bland. The only thing I did was season the chicken leg meat, what I had instead of breast meat, with salt,garlic salt and pepper. I cook in a cast iron skillet and I think that ads lots of flavor to everything I cook. I will make this again, even when I'm not challenged financially!

I cooked the Orzo in chicken broth, and instead of Parm I used 8 oz freshly grated Swiss Gruyère cheese and added about 3 mins before taking off stove so the cheese melted and mixed throughout, It was absolutely wonderful

I love this simple recipe!  I didn't have crushed red pepper so I used Southwestern spice instead (Pampered Chef). I also used frozen spinach pellets, four of them because that's what I had. YUM!

This was delish! Only giving a four because I did it  tad different. Kids don't like spinach so cooked that first by adding evoo to skillet & teaspoon minced garlic, then once garlic fragrant adding spinach until wilted. Set aside. Wiped out same skillet then cooked chicken with an additional amount of evoo. Cooked orzo in chicken broth, reserve cooking liquid. Once chicken and orzo in pan, added reserved liquid - made it a little thicker - then added 1/4 grated Parmesan reggiano cheese. My family devoured it! Should have doubled it as they were asking for seconds!!!

My husband and daughter loved this! I used the parsley as notes but it would taste better without it. The parmasan really adds to the flavor. I cooked the orzo in water with chicken bouillon cubes and the flavor was delish!

This dish is time-efficient and cost-effective. It needed a little more flavor, so I added traditional prego sauce to the dish and it was AMAZING! I will be making this again. Great family meal!

This recipe was such a hit that I will definitely make it a part of my "go to" recipes again and again.  I didn't change anything and everyone loved it.  I did think about adding a few chopped sundried tomatoes but I think I will leave well enough alone.

Very easy and tasty recipe! Even added a bit of a twist, try putting some mushrooms and asparagus in.  First time using orzo, think it will become something that I use more often. Again thanks for the recipe!!

Made this last night and it was a hit. I also took the suggestion of adding chicken bouillon (I had no broth). In the future I will have to remember to adjust the salt in the chicken when doing so as it was over the top salty. I cubed the chicken and added the salt and parsley flakes all together and mixed well. I also peeled a potato and let it sit in the final mix toward the end and it helped absorb enough salt that it was edible. I had some basil outside so I added that as well. Even my picky 11 yr old ate it with a smile. Will definitely make again as I've saved it to my box.

I modified the recipe and it turned out fantastic. I added a bullion cube to the water in which I boiled the orzo in and this helped to add flavor. I sautéed the pepper and garlic and then threw in the chicken which I had seasoned with garlic salt. Then,  I cooked the chicken through and added some cherry tomatoes. Also, I added these basil flavor cubes to the chicken mixture. Once I mixed in the cooked orzo I added a generous amount of cilantro and parsley spice and it turned out great!

I love this recipe, I added a lot of stuff only because I had it on hand and to myself why not.  I used a 32oz box of chicken broth and 2 cups of orzo, maybe a 1/4 cup of percorino ramano grated cheese and it made a creamy saucy pasta and then I added a chopped roma tomato, onion, jar of artichoke hearts, spinach, garlic, and a good squeeze of lemon.  The dish took a total of maybe 20 minutes tops.  I will make it again and probably change what I put in it to whatever I have on hand.  The recipe itself is great or a starter to whatever you want to make of it.

UGH, I hate giving this recipe 2 stars.  But I always rate "as written" and I always appreciate the same, so that I can then look for ways to improve it.  So I will say, for those interested - this is a NEW FAVORITE in my house!  As written, it is genuinely so bland.  But I read reviews and tasted throughout the process... used more garlic, cooked the orzo in chicken broth... added a generous amount of salt and freshly ground black pepper... added a little more red pepper flakes... and at the very end, juice of half a lemon (I had doubled the recipe though, I would have juiced a 1/4 if it was as written)... and my family RAVED.  I doubled the recipe for the three of them (I had already eaten) and it was GONE at the end.

So I'm sorry for the two stars, but great starting point and thank you for the recipe!!!!  :)  I'm told this is a keeper with the changes by some picky eaters.

Very good.  I did follow some of the recommendations.  I cooked the orzo in chicken and used 8 cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of red pepper.

Amazing,, Just wonderful, I followed recipe with exception of adding some vegies, I added 3-4 cloves of garlic,( we love garlic) I browned garlic and red pepper flakes in a dutch oven, then added chicken,and rosemary, when chicken was done added a sliced mexican zucchini, to the orzo I added about a cup of baby carrots sliced and let them cook with orzo, then drained and added to chicken and zucchini, with handful of frozen peas,parsley, S&P as I went, also used Low sodium Chick. broth as I went along so it wasn't too dry, then fresh spinach, served in low pasta bowls with shaved asigao and parm. cheese and some red wine. complete fantastic dinner. Definately going in my weekly meal rotation. Thanks for awesome recipe.

I took the advice from some of the other reviews & added chicken broth. I added a splash to the chicken while cooking & again after adding the orzo, it served to deglaze the pan just a bit. The orzo on its own IS bland BUT it offsets the spice of the chicken so it works. I served it with some Garlic toast and it was more than enough for a main meal. We'll make this again (husband approved!).

Love this recipe - you can leave as is, or add more garlic, substitute chicken broth for water - and, a variation I love - broil a nice piece of Alaskan wild salmon - and break it up and use that instead of the chicken. You can substitute orecchiette for orzo, as well. The point is, it's a fast, easy recipe that includes all of the staples for a great meal. I turned around and my boys had eaten it all!

My husband and I loved this dish! Took the recommendation to use chicken broth instead of water when cooking the orzo and was glad I did because it was still fairly bland, but overall had great flavor. Also added some lemon juice to the mix. Will definitely make this again!

It was definitely really good. I am in Italy right now so I could not find actual Orzo but I used the Italian version and it was much more risotto like. I think it was still very good & would definitely do it again.

I set up a week of recipes and did this one first thinking it would be our least favorite.  Boy was I wrong and now afraid the rest of the week will not hold up to this one.  

I did add some roasted broccoli to add more veggies to the meal and it worked out great.

Tasty, but serving size was too small.  Next time I think I would add more chicken and spinach!

Love this recipe and so do the picky, hard to please kids! Like others, I cooked the orzo in chicken broth, but also added black olives to the finished product as well as feta cheese sprinkled on top. Family favourite! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very bland.  We ended up having to modify the recipe to give it flavor.  It could be the base to a wonderful meal if you make your own changes.

Made the recipe as is, with the exception of cooking the orzo in chicken broth.  It was a huge hit with the teenage kids!  I will definitely make again, and will try some alterations that have been suggested.

I made this last night and it was great! I also cooked the orzo in broth since that makes it taste much better. My husband and I liked the little bit of kick from the red pepper. I also like that the recipe is easy to change up (add different ingredients) so I can see myself making this many more times!

I made this two nights ago for dinner.  I want to say I made it exactly as written but I would be lying.  I followed the reviewers suggestions and added a can of diced tomatoes (along with the fresh spinach - this mom does what ever it takes to get her kids to eat their veggies!) and cooked the orzo in 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth, which I didn't drain because the orzo sucked all the broth right up.  I also only had whole wheat orzo so that is what I used.  I finished up the recipe as directed.  The results?  A very flavorful and deliciously healthy recipe that my entire family loved.  My husband surprised me the most, he loved it and requested we have it again soon and he is not into healthy foods at all.  I will probably continue to make it with those modifications because my family enjoys it and that is all I can ask!  A really great base recipe though!  :)

This recipe is pretty good. It's simple to make and tastes fine. My main objection is that it isn't particularly flavorful. It needs a little more than just garlic for flavoring to really make it good; the recipe is a little bland as-is. Next time, I'm going to try marinading the chicken in Italian dressing and tossing a bullion cube in with the orzo.

It was really good. I am rating it a 4 because I cooked the orzo in chicken broth and there was too much garlic and red pepper flakes. Also, my boyfriend thought something was missing.

Really good!  Easy to make.  Four servings really only feeds 2-3 people, though.  Jeff requested different pasta (does not like orzo). I cooked the pasta in water with about 1 Tsp of chicken boullion.

I mixed it up (quite a bit) but we enjoyed it.  I browned bite sized chunks of chicken in olive oil and garlic, mixed in about a teaspoon of red pepper.  Once the chicken was about 1/2 cooked thru I dumped in a 16 oz box of orzo and let it brown.  Then I poured in a 32 oz box of chicken broth and 3 heaping spoons of pesto sauce.  Turned it down to about medium low, popped the top on it and left it alone for 20 minutes.  Stirred it all up and shredded some fresh parm over the top.  Yum!

As other users suggested, I used chicken broth to cook the Orzo. I also added rosemary, basil, parsely and garlic salt to the chicken while it was cooking. I added a few slices of onion as well as 1 whole green bell pepper, sliced, which gave it a nice "crunch". I omitted the olive oil and used a non-stick pan, which worked out fine. The juices in the chicken are enough to avoid sticking/burning on the pan. I also used frozen spinach since I could not find fresh. I also added the juice of 1 whole lemon which added a nice flavor to it all. In the end, this was a super easy and fast meal to make.

oh goodness, I never made orzo before (I'm a rice kinda gal) and this was so easy to make.  I used chicken broth instead of water to cook the orzo like the others recommended along with more crushed pepper because I like heat...can't wait to make this again.

This was spicy for me, I think the oil infused with the garlic and red pepper makes it stronger than you anticipate.  This felt like a healthy dish, and probably was.  I liked the Orzo.  One cup doesn't seem like enough, but it makes plenty.

I really liked this recipe but I have to confess I cheated. My local grocery store was out of orzo (all brands, if you can believe it) so I grabbed a box of rice pilaf to substitute, prepared it on the side and added it in after the chicken was cooked through. It was delicious and I will definitely make this again.

It was a hit in my house, my husband and teen son ate 2 plates.  I did cook the orzo in chicken broth as suggested by other posters and added a cup of frozen peas during the last 3 minutes.  I also added some fresh basil and oregano to the chicken during sauteeing.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good and very simple. Only change I made based on past reveiws was to use about 1 1/2 t.chicken soup base instead of salt. Gave it a little extra flavor. Very good base recipe though. Thanks!

Great recipe, I have made it several times. I boiled the orzo in chicken broth, once I left out the chicken and added mushrooms. Always great!

really excellent nice flavors and a bit of spice.  I would recommend cutting up chicken before hand so that the pepper flakes don't burn.

This was a  wonderful recipe!  I also boiled the orzo in chicken broth, it left the orzo so nice and creamy! I sauted LOTS of garlic (5 cloves), and onions in olive oil and added it to the mixture. I added some Greek seasoning, a BIG handful of fresh chopped cilantro and more olive oil. This was remarkable!!!

Very good. The only changes I made were to cook the noodles in chicken broth instead of water and I added basil. My whole family loved it.

This recipe was pretty good.  If I make it again I will probably add more seasoning.  My only problem with it was it was a little bland for my tastes.

What a wonderful recipe!  Especially loved the spinach added to the orzo.  I would use a non stick pan next time because the orzo stuck a little to the bottom even with the olive oil.  GREAT!

Unfortunately this recipe was not one of my favorites.  The orzo noodles reminded me of mushy rice and the flavor was just so so.  It was edible but not something I would ever make again.

I really enjoyed this!  I ended up cooking the Orzo in chicken broth as others had suggested.  I also added some onion and red and green peppers to the dish.  My boyfriend ate it! He ended up finishing it all in one sitting!  So a serving for four was actually one for me and the rest for him! lol :)

Not a bad dish but it truly did need a bit of remodeling. I coated the chicken pieces with highly seasoned flour and sauteed, used chicken broth in lieu of water for the orzo, added garlic and onion powders to the pasta and mixed in some freshly grated parm cheese. A good start tho and the family was pleased. Thank you!

Didn't think this dish was anything special.  It was pretty bland.  I didn't make any revisions because I saw everyone rating it so well that I figured it was good the way it was.  Boy was I wrong.  I'm not saying its bad, but it definitely needs revisions.

This recipe is AWESOME!  It is extremely easy to make, and is a fast recipe to make.  I once tried it with lipton's chicken and broccoli rice as a side dish because I didn't have orozo.  Great both ways.

tasty!! I followed a bunch of the modification suggestions that I read here and the result was great! using chicken stock (I used low sodium) for the orzo made it so creamy and adding more red pepper flakes/garlic upped the heat and added great flavor! this will be one I always go back to and it made me a big fan of orzo (esp with chicken stock!) which is a pasta that I don't use ever! only thing is, does anyone see whole wheat orzo offered anywhere?

Great and easy. I let the orzo absorb all of the chicken stock then added it to the chicken for a few minutes. I added the spinach last, a quick stir and its done! I have made this a few times, very good!

It was very light and good.  I recommend seasoning the chicken with seasoned salt before cooking to add a little more flavor.  I also added a tablespoon at a time of chicken broth to orzo and chicken mixture when heating to keep it from getting too dry.  Also use shredded parmesan

It was a pretty easy recipe, but I felt it lacked flavor aside from the spiciness from the red pepper.  It tasted better with loads of parm cheese on top. I don't think I enjoyed it enough to make again.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. I used a little garlic salt and grilled the whole chicken breast and cut it into cubes. I followed the suggestion of others by sauteing the orzo with the garlic then adding the chicken broth and the rest of the ingredients. It was not bland at all.

Sorry, I got excited about making and eating this dish, but was disappointed.  The recipe is fine, but I think we just did not like the texture of the dish.  It could use more flavor, a 'kick'.

A basic flavorful recipe. I opted to add a pinch of italian seasoning and a little extra parmesian cheese.

I was nervous trying this because my husband does not like cooked spinach. But he loved it as well as my 13 year old son. I didn't put the red pepper in as I am not a fan of red pepper but I did add a small onion and sauted it with the garlic. It was awsome. It works really good to use up left over chicken to.

This is a very good base recipe.  I used another tablespoon of olive oil and sauted one shallot along with the garlic.  At the very end I added the spinach for wilting and also a nice handful of diced prosciutto (you could also use pancetta.)  We all licked our plates and wanted more!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Followed others advice to cook orzo in chicken broth.  Added cherry tomatoes, lemon juice and rosemary at the end. YUM YUM!

I never tried orzo before but really liked it.  I took others suggestions and cooked orzo in chicken broth which was completely absorbed so no draining.  Used italian style diced tomatoes instead of spinach so that the kids would eat it and added some extra garlic which gave it a little kick.  I think the chicken could use more seasoning before cooking to add more interest.

Very good. I used risotto instead of orzo noodles and my family loved this. Equally I added extra garlic, italian dry seasoning blend!

5 stars for the orzo as we grilled our chicken, and I made the pasta as a side dish. I sauted the garlic with a little onion and some mushrooms, then added the cooked orzo (in chicken broth) with the remainder of the ingredients.  Great way to get hubby to eat some spinach. Will make this again and try adding chicken or shrimp.

I subbed boneless/skinless chicken thighs dusted with seasoned flour and added a can of petite diced tomatoes (garlic and oregano). Doubled the garlic. Also added chicken broth to adjust consistency. WOW.

Really good but with a few changes. I substituted roasted garlic for the minced. I just roasted it in the oven and then squished it to get it out of the cloves. Then I added a 1/3 or so cup of cream to blend all the flavors together better. I served lots of fresh grated parm on top and my family loved it, a keeper.

Very good although I did make some changes based on other reviews. I added chopped tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and I doubled the spinach. I also used chicken broth instead of water to boil the orzo. I added a splash of white wine and some of the chicken broth from the orzo at the end and when I mixed the orzo with the chicken I splashed some extra virgin olive oil over it.  I will def. make this again my husband loved it!

As another person mentioned, this is a great "base" recipe.  There was nothing "wrong" with it at all. It just wasn't bursting with flavor.  I took the advice of others and used chix broth.  I think w/o that it would have been bland.  I will try this again and maybe put my own spin on it.  It is a great lower fat recipe and a good way to sneak in veggies.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was delicious.  I overcooked my chicken, so it was a little dry, but that's not the recipe's fault!  Next time I'll be more careful with that.

Very easy and quick to prepare. I made minor changes, such as using thighs and added a bit more garlic and spinach. Really couldn't be simpler. Next time I may add some white wine when sauteeing the chicken. This dish was great the next day as lunch also.

I thought this was excellent.  It had really good flavor and was so simple to make.  I think next time I will substitue basil for the parsley and possibly add some diced tomatoes as suggested.

This was kinda bland.  As others suggested I cooked orzo in chicken broth.  I also added more garlic and spinach and italian seasoning.  Even though it's not terrible -- definitley edible-- the majority voted not to make it again.

This was DELICIOUS.  I changed it just a bit, cooking orzo in chicken broth, substituting diced tomatoes for spinach and i also added artichokes and that really added a great flavor.  i trippled the garlic and used oregano.  i used the 2 tbs of oil and didn't think it was oily at all.  i also added some shredded mozzarella cheese melted on top and it was really delicious!

I made this and the whole family loved it kids and all.  The only thing I did was to make sure I seasoned every step.  Salt the water for the orzo and add salt when the spinach went in.  My husband loved it and was upset because it was all gone and he didn't get any more.

I'm giving this 4 stars, I thought it was OK, but like others, a little bland. Hubby and son really liked it though. I cooked the orzo in chicken broth per others' suggestion and added more spices to the chicken. All in all, pretty good. Will probably make again.

I tried everything to make this flavorful. I cooked my orzo (which was veggie flavored) in homemade chicken stock, I marinated my cooked chicken (left over from a roast) in lemon and parsley, I added capers and chunks of tomato, I threw in some extra stock in the last stage, and I topped it all with fresh parm. cheese...but it still lacked any flavor. This pasta dish needs a sauce of some sort. Other than that, I don't know how one would get liven this dish up.

This was more like a 3 1/2 stars.  Was worth trying and everyone ate it. But when asked if I should make it again only one person said yes.

I thought this was pretty bland.  I cooked the orzo in chicken broth and even added more parsley and garlic.  It was still just okay.  I may try again by adding other ingredients, because the recipe is a pretty good base.

This dish was good, not amazing.  When you are done, the chicken is white, the orzo is white and the spinach is green.  It just needs something...like something taste-wise (like a sauce) and something color-wise.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought it needed something, but it tasted ok and was very fast to prepare.  Also, it is extremely healthy what with all the garlic, chicken breast and spinach. I also used brown rice instead of orzo for extra health. I definitely agree with other reviewers who said to double the spinach.

I would give this four stars if I hadn't made a couple changes that made it tastier (in my humble opinion). I added an entire bunch of fresh chopped spinach (about 6 cups), and also a hefty shake of lemon pepper for zip. What I thought made it phenomenal was the fact that I was eating 30 minutes after starting to prep the ingredients!

Great recipe! Loved that it had just a bit of spicy-ness to it. Had never had orzo until now, but would definitely eat it again and use it in future recipes.
