This is about the wonderful flavor of bacon and this recipe is great. If you have fears of becoming obese from eating this then don't.

I tried deep frying at different tempuratures but it was horrible. Didn't taste like bacon anymore and the flour coating was gross.

I soaked the bacon in milk and eggs with a lot of pepper and a little salt.  I added a lot of pepper to the flour and a little salt.  I double dipped and floured the bacon, so much better.  The egg and milk mixture left over I scrambled.  Eggs were very good and oh so moist.  A piece of toast and breakfast was ready.  We ate 3 pieces each, that's only one and a half slices.  At three slices for both of us a pound goes a long way.

This recipe was easy and tasty. The batter was a little bland, next time I will add more spices to the flour mixture.
