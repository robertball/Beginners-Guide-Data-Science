This was great! I bought and avocado for this and had it out on the counter but totally spaced cutting it up before serving. It didn't need it but it sure would have been that much better with it in there. The kale did not wilt as fast as I thought it would. I was expecting it to wilt like spinach but it held its form well so you could actually do this 30 minutes or so in advance prior to the rest of your meal getting done. I have never seen red kale in my area so I threw in some romaine hearts that I had on hand. The dressing is spicy alright but the smokiness works very nice in this.  This is great and I cannot wait to try it again WITH the avocado this time.

my review is only for the dressing.. which tasted more like what i'd use as a marinade.. as HOPHEAD warned.. be very careful with how much chipotle powder you use.. it's very strong/spicy.. with that being said.. i halved both the chipotle powder and paprika knowing it would be just too much.. i also tripled the *soy*.. this was in need of some kind of cooling agent so i added 2 T of ranch dressing.. i'm no stranger to heat/spice, but without the ranch it would have been inedible.. either way it's always fun to try something new/different

This is a remarkable salad. Be cautious with the chipotle powder.
