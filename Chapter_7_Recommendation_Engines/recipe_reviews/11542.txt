I made the brownies, but added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup 
nuts instead of the 3/4 cup nuts the recipe called for.  This really 
increased the "butterscotchy" flavor of the brownies and made them 
extra special.  People now ask for these well in advance of their 
birthdays as presents.

These brownies are really good.  They rise quite a bit and come out cake-like.  I only gave it 4 stars because it really does need a modification to the recipe - butterscotch chips added.  I added the chips and the brownies were great.  Without them you are relying on the brown sugar alone, it's just not enough.

These make a great gift and taste good as well.  I double the vanilla and add a pinch of salt to the mix.  It really brings the recipe together.

These are very tasty.  I baked them for work and for my husband.  Everyone thought they were great and very moist.  However, the main comment is that they don't have a strong "Butterscotch" flavor.  But these are delicious anyway.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  
12/23/2000...I made these in jars for Christmas gifts except I did not include the nuts in the jar.  I noted the nuts in the card for the recipent to add when mixing.  All recipents that have baked them,have enjoyed them.
Thanks again..

Guess I am in the minority here but we just didn't care for these brownies, I am glad we tried the recipe prior to making the jars as gifts.

I tested this recipe before giving it as a Christmas gift and with the addition of the butterscotch chips (1/2 cup) these are really good.

This recipe was amazing. I gave it as a gift before making it, that was the only mistake I made with the recipe, this is because I found that this recipe is more like a pie than a brownie. If you bake this recipe at 350* for 30-35 minutes in a cake pan it come out gooey on the inside and has the texture of a pecan pie. If I had made it before giving it as a gift I would have changed the cooking temp and time on the directions. This recipe tastes so good warm or refrigerated. I changed the recipe a little by using 3/4 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup nuts. I recommend this recipe to anyone.

Before giving a gift of food, I always try out the recipe... unfortunately not all work. But this one did. When baking, I did make the mistake of baking in a smaller pan which caused the brownies to overcook in some areas. Next time, I will use the correct size... I know they will come out perfect! Thanks for such a good gift recipe.

I made "jars" for Christmas 1999.  Everyone had raving reviews and loved being able to bake the brownies on their own whim.

Made these for gifts. Altered the order of packing them into the jars a bit based on other reviews. When I made a batch my husband said they were the best brownies he's ever had. I found the batter to be more like cookie dough though? Still tasted yummy.

Unfortunately, the ingredients don't make for the prettiest presentation ever in a jar. The outcome is not bad ~ the brownies were a nice chewy texture and were not too sweet,  but I agree with other reviewers - add 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to give not only an extra layer of color to the jar, but a punch of flavor & interest to the brownie (I would do a ratio of 1/2 cup nuts & 1/2 cup chips).

Amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly.  My only recommendation is to grease the pan LIGHTLY!  With all the butter, it doesn't  need much and the center was a little gooey. I did manage to get all the ingredients into a wide mouth 1 qt jar. I accomplished this only when I started with the brown sugar and ended with the flour mixture. PACKING is the key. I used a metal mallet to help pack it in.  While still a little warm, I drizzled  a confectioners sugar/milk (with a touch of almond extract) icing on top to add that finished touch. Bonus:  These are great warm or can be made a day or two ahead, stored in an air tight container, and they will taste fresh. (But make sure you hide the container or they will be gone!)
