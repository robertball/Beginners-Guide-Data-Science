I used canola oil instead of olive oil since it has a more neutral taste and lets the apple cider vinegar and caraway seeds shine through more

I made this salad and it was very tasty.  I accidentally used fennel seeds instead of caraway and the flavors are good together.  I did add some mayonnaise.
