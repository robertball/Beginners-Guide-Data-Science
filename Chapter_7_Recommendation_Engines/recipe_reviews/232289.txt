This was the Johnsonville Sausage remake recipe I chose.  I used ground sausage in place of the canned ham and I diced red skinned potatoes in place of the canned. It was wonderful!  So good!  Served with an over easy egg to break open over top.  Really, really good.  So good, in fact, I even got another marriage proposal from the Hubs!  Mmmhmm - score!

This is quick and easy. I seem to always have Spam on hand to make one of my comfort foods, a Spam sandwich. This turn out great for breakfast with eggs and toast. Next time I will go with homemade potatoes.

I thought this was a very good recipe. My son even ate the Who Hash, and he is very picky. I changed up the luncheon meat to smoked sausage. I have made variation on this for a long time and have always enjoyed it.

Ok, really quick and easy.  Needs lots of freshly ground pepper and it's even better with ketchup.  My son was surprisingly appreciative, he-who-loves-hot-hot-chili.  Definitely comfort food.  I'll probably try it with the over-easy eggs next time.
