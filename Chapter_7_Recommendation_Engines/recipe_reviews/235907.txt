Yummy!  Loved the onions and the heat was right up my alley.  I even added some sliced jalapeno piece on top to give the bite a little color.  I could eat a lot of these.  I skipped the tomato paste just because Grumpy doesn't like it.  For this reason my topping was just a little liquidy, but that was fine, I just strained the oinons out with a fork to top the cracker so they didn't get soggy.

I just loved everything about this bite! The onion topping was excellent and my girls ate these up. Hubby actually enjoyed them too as he's usually not one for eating onions but he really put some down. There is nothing I didn't like about this...my family said it rocked. And I think one kid added Dill Relish on top of hers too. Thanks Lil...it's a keeper.

I am giving this a 5, because I absolutely loved the onions on this. I even realized I was out of hot sauce after starting the onions, and subbed 2 Tblsp of chili sauce and 2 small pinches of cayenne for half the recipe. I followed the rest of the ingredients as is. I used cooked and sliced Trader Joes all-beef hot dogs and yellow mustard as suggested. I am looking forward to making hot dogs over the next summer holiday with these onions. Having it all on a cracker was fine, but the cracker just seemed somewhat dry and on the butter side to me with this combination. Maybe, if they sat a little longer the cracker would start to soak up some of the yummy cooked onions. I plan to make more of these as an quick appetizer for Super Bowl. They do present well because of the onions. ty

These little treats are the essence of NYC.  For authenticity, the hot dogs must be cooked in hot water.  I went a step further when serving and made one plate as per the recipe and another small plate topped with sauerkraut in place of the onions.  These almost made the football bearable.  Thanks, Lillian

What a unique little treat these were and so easy to prepare. My onions didn't sauce up as much as some I see in the pictures but they were perfect for us just the way they turned out. This one is a keeper. Thanks Lillian!

I've never had an authentic NY push-cart hotdog, but this recipe makes me want to go hug a vendor!  The onion mixture is fantastic, and really adds a fantastic sweet and tangy flavor to the hotdogs.  Even my 11 year old daughter who normally will not TOUCH onions if they're featured in a recipe loved these!  I can't wait to serve these on Super Bowl Sunday, they're easy, quick, and can be made ahead.  You created a definite winner, Lillian!

We used the push-cart onions the traditional way, topping a hot dog.   What a nice change from same-ole mustard and sweet pickle relish.  I added a little more Louisiana hot sauce which gave this just the perfect zing for us.  Thanks, Lillian, for developing this recipe, it's a winner.

Yum, yum!  These were very simple to make and really packed a flavor punch!  The onions were fabulous!  I felt like I was eating a chili dog, but, without the actual chili!  Very tasty and fun to make!

The heat on these was over the top. I loved the onion mixture just wished it was a little less spicy for us. I will make these again and just play around with the spice. My kids even tried these(didn't tell them they were onions) and liked them. The mustard does tame the heat a little. Nice bite!

One bite sensations! I lived in NY and these brought back some great memories. Did not have yellow mustard so had to improvise and go with the Grainy mustard I had on hand.

Surprisingly good! Onion topping is wonderful. A little tedious to put together, but which finger food isn't? I suggest to have the hot dog pieces on stand by in a pot and just make a few at a time. They will be gobbled up right away!
