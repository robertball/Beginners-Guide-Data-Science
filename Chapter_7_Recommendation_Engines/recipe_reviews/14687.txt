I really liked this recipe. Although I knew it would be on the bland side, I added these options to it and it was grand! :)

1 tablespoon worchester sauce
1 whole yellow onion chopped
2 teaspoons garlic salt
1 teaspoon onion salt
1 heaping tablespoon minced garlic
1 heaping tablespoon of Knorr beef Boulion

I didnt add garlic to hamburger untill the last 20 seconds of browning. And I added the worchester sauce to the milk. Mixed Knorr beef Bouilion into flour misxture. Instead of bread, I used penne pasta, and had fried okra on the side. All I needed was a trench and a canteen! Just kidding!  Delicious! :)

I would make this again.  It's easy and cheap.  After reading the reviews, here's what I did differently:  Added chopped onion. pressed garlic and sliced mushrooms while browning meat.  Used 1 bouillion cube and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  Everything else was the same.  Oh, I did just keep adding worchestershire sauce to taste.  This dish was certainly thick enough to serve over toast or biscuits this way.  I served mine with mashed potatoes and peas however.  It's just what I had on hand.

Always better with some garlic added. Most raters miss the point that this (at least in the Army I served in for 24 years) is a breakfast item. Pour the SOS over a pile of hashbrowns, then put a couple of over-easy eggs on top of that. Cut through it all with a knife so the runny yokes, SOS and hashbrowns are mixed. Then wolf it down along with some strong black coffee. That is a breakfast to help you face the day. For additional authenticity, eat outside, standing up, in the dark, on a cold morning, while whiffing deisel fumes from a nearby truck. Ah, the memories.

As many have commented the recipe as written is going to be bland.(Sorry Suzanne). To make this recipe a FIVE star try the following. As the meat is browning I add both garlic and onion powder, about a teaspoon of each to 1 lb, as well as the other seasoning. Be carefull with the salt however because beef bullion tends to be salty. I substitute a pinch of celery seed for the worcestershire sauce. I don't want the "batch" to be to brwn. My kids love it!

This was much better than just hamburger gravy.  It's a fast and simple recipe and most people have all the ingredients on hand.  The kids loved it!  It's better if you cook the beef with the flour coated on it long enough for the flour to brown a little.  This will become an easy staple!

I have never cared for the taste of plain, unseasoned ground beef, so I liberally seasoned the browning beef with garlic powder, Lawry's season salt and pepper.  I also added a half an onion, diced, to the beef.  I really didn't measure the Worchestershire sauce, just let some bobble on out of the bottle, but I'm sure it was more than 1/4 teaspoon.  I also added a cup of frozen peas with the milk.  I served this over refrigerated jumbo whomp biscuits from a cardboard can.  Very comforting and good.  Will definitely make again.

I didn't feel like cooking all night so I decided to try this recipe. It was fast, simple, and very fulfilling. I added a medium sized onion, a clove of garlic, and 5 large mushrooms. I served it over  rice and it was just fantastic!! It is a real keeper. I will surely make it again. Thank you very much for the submission Sue.

This is a good recipe. I personally have tried a package of AU Jus,fresh mushrooms, garlic and chopped onions and when making this. Mix the Au Jus in about 1 cup of hot water and add to ingredients.This will give it a richer flavor.We love it over mashed potatoes !

With the exception of using a bouillon cube rather than powdered beef base, this recipe is an authentic Army recipe. I prepared this breakfast favorite for Rangers in Savannah, GA hundreds of mornings and rarely had leftovers. If you make double portions (or save half of what's left) it's a cinch to turn this product into Beef Strogganof! Just add sour cream, mushrooms, salad dressing and boil some egg noodles. Makes dinner a breeze! Rangers Lead The Way!

I loved this recipe! Even though I was out of the worcestershire sauce it still turned out great.  I added an extra boullion cube to make up for it.  In the future, I'm going to try adding sour cream or maybe cream cheese...maybe even mushrooms.  A very good, basic recipe that has infinite possibilities.

Pretty good and easy although DH did not care for it. Definately needs more spice if you like more flavor. Next time I'll dice some onions and mushrooms and saute the mushrooms while the ground beef is cooking. I topped mine with Mrs. Dash and a tiny bit of Lawry's Seasoned Salt and it was great! Definately not something for someone who bases tastes on looks (that's my husband! He turned up his nose and took one bite and said "I don't like it"). I think kids would like it...my 1 yr old seemed to. Give this one a try and spice it up...quick and easy!

Ah, yes, SOS, "a fine grind of meat and vegetables in a creamed-base sauce" is how Army and Air Force 'menus' described it. 
I usually saute minced onion and garlic along with the ground beef. I add lots of finely ground black pepper along with salt after cooking the flour in and adding/reducing the liquid. Another tasty addition is poultry seasoning (or ground sage). Go easy with the seasonings until near the end--flavors can and will concentrate as the liquid is reduced--remember, you can always add more and cook them in for a few minutes. I rarely use Worcestershire, which can add sweetness, as does milk. If you use cream, the result isn't quite as sweet (milk adds that property to a 'cream'-based gravy) or, if like me, you want to cut those calories, use nonfat condensed milk (unreconstituted) instead.. Immediately after adding the liquid, the SOS should be thinner than you like it--it should be simmered for 15 minutes or so to blend and mellow the ingredients (no 'raw flour taste this way) 
If the end result is too thin, cook it longer; if too thick, add a bit more liquid than you like and cook down. This is a very good ans easy base recipe, and one that most guys I know (at least the ones that like ground beef) enjoy; certainly most ex-service people (and often service brats, too!). Of course, as another reviewer stated: to be authentic, it should be served on toast.

I cooked SOS almost daily in the Army and I can tell you, the beef bouillon and the Worcestershire sauce have got to go. They do not add to, but only take away from true Army style SOS. In place of using those two items use garlic powder and when browning the ground beef of at least 80/20% lean to fat add 1/2 cup chopped onions. Please have a bottle of hot sauce on the table for your dinners to further their military tastes.

My husband is active duty for 20+ years. I made this tonight - as wrote (added a small cube of cream cheese - but I would never tell him) - and he said it was "dead on" what the Army serves. I did use alot of pepper - as that is how he likes his. This is not meant to be a gourmet meal with mushrooms, onions, garlic, etc. It is great if that is how you like it - but soldiers eat it as wrote - bland and all. This is a really good recipe - my hubby said it takes him back to drill sgt. school when after being on the trail for days on in - this was an ultimate comfort food.

Im giving this 5 stars because it is the basic way to make SOS those who are complaining that it is on the BLAND side keep in mind a recipe of this nature is NOT meant to be perfect on flavor (although in my opinion this one does not lack there) this type of recipe is designed to feed the masses, large groups of people, or families on a budget and need a filling meal. THIS is what it is. If you need more flavor may I suggest salt and pepper to taste. Chop up a RED ONION take a can of peas drain it and add it to the mix.... I have fond memories of the type of dish this is, Growing up with a divorced mom she always made sure the kids were not only fed but full. This SOS kind of dish was one of my favorites served on top of toast> Let me tell you if there was a way to make ends meet in the kitchen my mom could do it. Thank you for posting this recipe and taking me back to my mothers home cooked gotta feed the kids kind of cooking. I had her recipe but sadly lost it, this one was very close to hers.

Made this the other night for the family.  From the second helpings they had, I'd say it turned out pretty good.  I did add/omit a few ingredients to the recipe to pep up the meat.  2 cloves of minced garlic.  1/3 onion (diced).  Omitted the bouillon since I didn't have it.  Added garlic powder, onion powder, mrs. dash, and lots of fresh cracked pepper.  I served over bowtie pasta.

It definitely needs spicing up. Granulated onion and garlic, Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper both... My hubby and I happen to love this kind of "meal" every now and then... with Ore-Ida hash browns and the shingle. Thanks for the post!

mmm, this one REALLY hit the spot!  i did make a bunch of little changes to the original recipe though.  I added 2 cans of mushrooms, 1/2 cup chopped onions, 1 Tablespoon garlic powder, 2 boullion cubes total, and 2 teaspoons of Worchestershire sauce total.  (I hate when people post all these changes and then say, "Oh yeah, this recipe was fantastic," but i can't resist, cuz it really WAS good with these changes!!  I tried to include measurements so ya'll can do it this way if you'd like.)  Anyway, with my modifications, it had a GREAT flavor and was a VERY warming, stick-to-the-ribs type dinner over some toast!  Plus, it was easy and quick!!  A winner in my book!

This was pretty bad.  It was bland, even after I incorporated some of the others' suggestions and added spices.  It looked and tasted like congealed meat.

Love this recipe!  My father use to make this in the winter time for Breakfast for his six children. Stick-To-Your Ribs kind of meal. Kept us warm on our long walk to school. He also used Chicken Broth in place of Beef Broth. Yum

I really liked this. I added the extra spices suggested. I think it was a half tsp of onion and garlic powder. I also added quite a bit of pepper. There were no leftovers and it was nice change.

Everyone loves SOS!  Growing up in a military family, we always knew when it was the end of the month and money was tight!  The Worchetershire sauce added a little zip!

Very good, and quick!  I did make some changes.  I used ground chuck, instead of ground beef, and added onion and garlic powder while cooking.  I couldn't stand the thought of adding the flour to the hamburger grease (too fattening), so I drained the grease, and added about a cup of water before adding the flour.  I also used 2 bouillon cubes, instead of 1, and added a can of low fat cream of mushroom soup.  Served over No Yolk egg noodles.  Yummy!

I made this one night because I needed a quick dinner.  Although it doesn't look very appetizing, don't let looks fool you.  I added onions and frozen peas and my kids loved it!  So did I.  I served it over noodles and rice.  Yum, Yum, I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

I read all of the negative reviews and have one thing to say....try it for breakfast on toast or biscuits. That's how my family has eaten this for years and it is a Christmas morning tradition. The only difference is we do not add the worcestershire or beef bouillion. A trick - by a packet of dry white gravy mix to add to the mixture as it is simmering, it will thicken it right up like sausage gravy. It is great!!

I was thinking that this recipe done exactly as listed would be a bit bland. I used only a half pound of beef, and cut the ingredients in half, too except for the bouillon cube. I still used a whole one. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce but I substituted with a quick sprinkle of soy sauce. I added some garlic salt, diced onions, tiny bit of onion powder, pepper, and dill weed. The whole thing came out marvelous!!! If the original recipe had more spices, this would definitely be a 5 star rating!!

oh no...this was like lumpy paste.  I followed the recipe hoping it was like a dish a friends mom made when I was a kid...not it.  If you're staring at a pan of this stuff right now wondering how you're going to choke it down..  1. DISSOLVE 2 more cubes of boullion in about half of a cup of water and add slowly.  2. stir and let simmer a while longer to thicken up again. 3.  Salt Salt Salt.  It's not great and I still have the taste of kindergarten paste in my mouth but at least I didn't have to cook anything else tonight.

YUM!!  I made this tonight for dinner, served it over egg noodles with green beans and blueberry cobbler.  I didn't use the worsch. sauce or the beef boulion because I didn't have either, but I did add garlic and onion powders and lots of black pepper.  Very good!

The recipe is similar to mine and thus I know it is superb, but the picture you got on that recipe is not what SOS looks like. I can give you a good image to go with that recipe.

My mom used to make this all the time. My Dad was in the navy so he was quite familar with it. My husband and I were both in the Army and I was never once served this, but that is neither here nor there. We make this with ground turkey, minced garlic and onion, an extra dash of wort, sauce and salt and pepper. The most important part: to be authentic it must be served over buttered toast. S.O.S stands for S*** on a Shingle. Shingle being buttered toast. Thanks for the recipe.

Thanks for the memories. My mom used to make this for me when I was a kid. We called it hamburger gravy.  I used white meat ground turkey seasoned with garlic powder, season salt, pepper and lots of worchishire and  no beef broth.  I also added a can of mushrooms and served it over Grands biscuits.  YUMMY.

I thought this was wonderful! I had nothing in my house to make for dinner so I got on the internet and found anything that I could cook with what I did have (which was very little).  I came across this recipe and I had all the ingredients so I made it and to my surprise it was very yummy. This has made it into my dinner rotation. I did add more Worcestershire sauce, black pepper and seasoning salt. I also browned a small onion in with the meat. At first I was going to serve it over biscuits but after I made it I couldn't imagine eating it like that so I made egg noodles instead. Good choice! I think there was enough taste to it but next time I will play around with it to see if it is possible to make it better. Thanks for adding one more dinner to my rotation.

I thought it was a pretty bland; needs something to spice it up a bit.  Instead of just milk, try a can of cream of chicken soup, plus enough milk to bring it to desired consistency.  Try sauteeing some onions in with the ground beef.  Much better this way!

My husband said SOS on the ship he was in the Navy was red. I don't know what it was colored with unless it was paprika or catsup. Anyway, he gave the recipe as written a three rating. It was OK but I think I'd zip it up with Season All or some garlic and onion powder next time.

A very good comfort food!
I mixed the flour into half and half instead of milk,and i added sausage and minced dried onion to the beef while cooking,because to me,ground beef is just too bland by itself in this recipe.
Hubby gobbles it up!

I wasn't a fan AT ALL of this recipe.  I felt like I had to eat it so I did, but it was not flavorful at all and I added onions and way more worchestire sauce.  (I also made it exactly as directed.)  It also looked about as good as it tasted.  Yuck!  Not a keeper. I can't believe it got so many good reviews.

It is a little bland which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I added some garlic powder and sauteed the beef in olive oil and that gave him some flavor! Otherwise, it is great! :)

A good stick to your ribs food and quick and easy meal. I sometimes use dried beef in the jar, but great with hamburger too. Like biscuits and gravy only for dinner. Yum. Never any leftovers.

I cook twice a week for a group of veterans and a couple weeks ago they threw out the challenge that I couldn't make SOS for them..the ARMY way.  Well, when they said that, I said, "Wanna bet?"  I won the bet.  They devoured this like starving vultures.  It is easy, quick and can be served over toast, plain bread, biscuits (which is what I used) rice or potatoes.  I didn't change anything, BUT I did have a bowl of finely chopped onions so they could put their own on top which is how we always ate it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Seeing how most thought this recipe was too bland, I decided to add the sauteed onion and garlic.  This still wasn't enough for me so I increased the Worchestire sauce and also threw in 1/4 c. of onion soup mix!  It turned out very good, I would reccomend this to the ones who think it's bland.

This was pretty gross.  I think you need the memories that go with this one to make it edible.  Would not make it again as noone would eat it in my family.  I made it with the cream of mushroom soup (I even used the full fat version) and onions and more worcestershire sauce.

This was really good!  It looks terrible, yes, but it's very nutritious.  High in Calcium. I added onions, peppers, and tomatoes.  I had a complete meal! I am always looking for ways to increase my daughters calcium intake and this was very easy! We ate it on toast "just like the soldiers do!"

Loved it. I added some mustard and a clove of garlic and it just lifted the flavour a little. We haven't descided yet if we like it better with pasta or with potatoes. Both are great. Another idea is to add hot sauce (we like spicy food.) Terrific comfort food if you're having a bad day !!!!!

This is a great recipe -- quick and easy and real comfort food. Yummy with mashed potatoes or biscuits.  I like to add a chopped onion while the hamburger is browning.  I also add a little extra worcestershire sauce.

Very quick and easy.  I added more worcestershire sauce and I used two boullion cubes because the meat was water buffalo which has no flavor.  We had it on top of biscuits.  My husband loved this in the army and he still does.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is fantastic!! I have a family of 5 that I am feeding, and three of them have very hearty appetites. So I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. I added one large chopped red onion, and though I doubled everything, I added extra beef bouillon cubes (4). And did not add any salt. This recipe reminds me of my days in the military. Those who claim it's bland are forgetting it's called ARMY SOS. however I did not find it bland at all. This is a quick easy meal to make as well as delicious, and very inexpensive if on a budget. This is a keeper, even my fussy picky eaters love this and always get seconds.

This was very easy and I too like many others added more spices. I added half of a sweet onion, few dashes of cilantro, garlic salt, onion powder and 1 clove garlic. My kids liked it alot over the egg noodles. Thanks for the submission!!!

I rate this recipe as a 3 only because lack of taste so I modified it by adding onion and garlic while I cooked the ground beef add 2 1/4 t worstersire sauce and adding season salt for more flavor, I also after it was done poured it into a 9x13 dish topped with 4 pieces swiss cheese then put pillsbury crescent roll on top and made it into a casserole my grandson loved it and said this recipe is a keep :) next time though I will use biscuits on top of the casserole.. I will use this recipe again and as I type this up my grandson is asking for seconds lol

This is a great recipe! It's economical, quick and easy to make. My husband loves it. I fry the hamburger up with 1 small onion, then add a couple hearty dashes of hot sauce to the gravy. Wonderful dish!

Added some extra seasonings, but this was pretty good.  I will definitely make again when I'm searching for a way to use up hamburger.

serving this on pasta or rice is fine but it was designed to be served on a slice of bread, plain or toasted. SOS stands for "sh*t on a shingle" or in more polite terms "same old stuff" My WW2 vet father knew it as S on a shingle and ate it both on base in the US and in the field kitchens in the rear areas behind the front lines. I also knew it as S on a shingle and it was always served on bread. Using ground beef is a variation because many people either don't know what chipped beef is or can't find it anymore. The original name for SOS was creamed chipped beef on toast. If you can't find chipped beef you can use chopped up  deli-style roast beef slices or pastrami slices. The cook in our messhall never put onions or garlic in his SOS  but being a good  Louisiana boy he added his favorite hot sauce which turned the SOS a light pink. Very tasty and he took a lot of good natured ribbing about the color but everyone always went back for seconds. Including me. My dad would have liked it also.

This was good. I added garlic and onion and it was a little bland as others mentioned. Even so I would make this again. I served it with egg noodles and everyone ate without  complaint.

I made this years ago after getting it from this site and totally forgot what it was called! Found it again and after adding, peppers, onions, mushrooms, garlic, and a little spice, it was very tasty and filling over mashed potatoes. Thanks!

I grew up on this recipe, as my father was in the military. It has always been a favorite for me. My husband grew up with it too, and his version is really good. He browns the ground beef longer than normal, so it seems to take on more flavor. He's also very liberal with the seasonings--garlic salt, seasoning salt (I know, it's a lot of salt) and pepper. He also always includes diced onion and of course the worcestershire.  I love it served over toast, and he likes it over potatoes.

This was a mess hall regular during WWII according to my dad. We had it on a regular basis. My mother made it the same way she made dried beef & sausage gravy. We always served it over toasted bread. Its was a fairly inexpensive way to feed a family of 8. I grew up and made it my own by adding bit of garlic powder and a tablespoon of sugar and lots of fresh ground pepper.
It is very similar to dried beef gravy or sausage gravy.

Really yummy with my simple modifications. Added 1 chopped onion, sauteed with the ground beef, then a few chopped garlic cloves toward the end. Add good shaking of garlic powder, along with the black pepper and a few shakes of tabasco sauce, which actually gives more flavor than punch. A full T of worcestershire and 3 or so Tablespoons of white wine. Also added chopped, fresh parsley at the end. Added more milk for more cream to serve over mashed potatoes. A family-loving meal!

Tastes like what my dad used to make.  I leave out the salt because the beef bouillion is already salty.  Use whole milk for the creamiest gravy.

This was simple and VERY easy! My Husband who is stretching his cooking wings made this without mishap and it turn out fantastic. It is very heavy and I can imagine not very light on the fat and calories but it is REALLY GOOD! My husband added a can of peas to this and it made a great one dish meal!

This is okay. It's a little lacking in flavor and presentation...but if you are low on ingredients and just need something that you can quickly throw together, it works nicely.

YUMMY! Very quick & easy to make! My husband who "hates SOS" licked his plate clean & asked for 2nds, & 3rds! I didn't have the worcestershire sauce so I added 3 bullion cubes instead of the 1. It turned out great! The picture does not do this dish justice! We ate it on top of lightly buttered toast. I am not big on leftovers but this was just as good warmed up! Next time I will try the worcestershire sauce. I am sure it will still be just as delish!

Wow! My dad was a chef in the Army and this is almost exactly his recipe. I love how this turned out; creamy, flavorful, and great over buttered toast, served with a fried egg on top and a side of fried potatoes. Good thing we only have if once in a while.

This is a dish that was served for breakfast when I was in the U.S. Army.
I loved it. I make it occasionally for dinner. An old army friend also asks for it to be on a diner's menu. Hasn't happened yet. You have to be an old G.I. to appreciate it.

Excellent. Very similar to the kind my hubby used to be served in Cadets. I add mushrooms and onions. Freezes very well.

This was great!  Growing up we didn't have much money and I remember eating something very similar to this recipe.

Just proves you don't have to sped a lot for a great taste.

This is good, if you like beef gravy.  Personally I think there are better things to do with ground beef.
However, just a few revisions.  Add 3 garlic cloves and try Miso Soup paste instead of Beef Buillon.  Miso Soup Paste is LOADED with flavor and all natural - no chemicals!!   It really does add real depth to this dish.

Good recipe, DH loved it, it was alright for me, and my 2 year old, who usually isn't picky, preferred the plain noodles. I added a pinch of salt and 2 beef boullion cubes and let them dissolve in the water for the noodles (Riggatoni noodles was all I had on hand). I added 1 tablespoon of the noodle water, when the noodles were done, and added it to the beef mixture when adding the beef boullion cube. I also took the advice of other users and added extra ingredients for seasoning. I sauteed 2 chopped garlic cloves in with the beef. And added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon parsley when adding the salt and ground black pepper. I also gave the flour time to brown before adding the milk and worcestershire sauce.

Loved this recipe. Cooked up fast with what I had on hand although I could see adding some mushrooms and some extra seasoning like others suggested.  I will definetly make this one again as is, as both my husband and I enjoyed it.

This recipe is great, thanks!  I used extra lean ground beef, non-fat milk and some ground red pepper; didn't have a bouillon cube. It was delicious. Over toasted light wheat bread, one serving is about 200 calories. One trick is to put the non-fat milk in a covered container along with the flour and shake vigorously to blend (be careful lid is secure). Then pour the milk and flour mixture over the meat, stirring constantly until fully thickened. I'm thinking of making this again and adding a little onion powder.

This probably would have been pretty bland had I made it following the recipe exactly. Instead, going on what others reviewed, I:
 sauteed half a med. onion, chopped & 4 cloves of minced garlic before adding ground beef
 increased the Worcestershire to about 1/4 cup
 cut out the salt entirely and added 1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp. of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, meat tenderizer & parsley. 
 my husband had his with shredded cheddar cheese on top

We are not a fan of bland food and my husband and I liked it enough to have it as leftovers for lunch the next day. We had it over toast, although I think if/when I make it again in future, we'll try like another suggester and have it over garlic toast.

I would give this recipe a 5 stars however I had to change a few things in the recipe. I cooked 1 chopped onion and 1 stalk of celery with the ground beef and added 1/2 cup of green peas near the end. I also added a little garlic powder and paprika for seasoning. EXCELLENT! I served over egg noodles. My husband loved this. However I dont think it would have been as tasty without the changes ( a little too bland otherwise).

My husband despises creamy sauces, so I made this for my kids and I while he was out of town.  I tweaked it a bit by sauteing chopped onions and sliced button mushrooms with minced cloves of garlic for a few minutes before adding the ground beef.  I also added quite a bit more Wor. sauce than the recipe calls for.  We had it over Minute Rice and loved it!

FAST & Delicious!  Used 2 boullion cubes and a fair amount of black pepper for the extra "bite!"  Served over biscuits.  Family loved it!  Very versatile as can serve over potatoes (of any form) rice, noodles, toast or any bread.  Although not the best presentation, but still gets 5 stars because of easiness, taste, and versatility.

I have made this several times.  Our favorite way is to make more by increasing milk to 4 cups, flour to one-half cup, bouillon granules to 2 t. and so on except don't increase the ground beef. Excellant.  Even better is to add crumbled crisp bacon.  Good on biscuits or toast.  Believe this one.  You'll be glad you did!

I've never tried it like this before.  I always made SOS by browning some ground beef, using the grease to brown some flour golden, slowly adding a bit of milk and then some water, adding salt and black pepper till it tastes right for a good skillet gravy, adding the browned ground beef back into it, and pouring it over toast.  That's the SOS I grew up with.  For it to be right, you will need more than a pinch of salt and pepper though either way.  But I think any tweaking different would have to be caramelized onions and/or garlic and mushrooms.  Wouldn't do anything different than what I already do.  I just can't see adding the other ingredients.

I just cooked it this evening for my husband and my self. Very delicious! I added a little bit of white cooking wine while the ground burger was cooking, then added sliced onions and mushrooms before adding the milk and worcestershire sauce. Served over rice with corn and rolls, was pretty amazing if I do say so my self! =)

Immediately made one alteration to the recipe.I cut back on the flour to only 1 to 2 tbsp of flour per cup of milk.The more flour you add the more bland and thick (we're not making mortar here)it gets.Other than that we loved it!Try it over egg noodles instead of rice (as shown)the rice will make it even blander

Very easy to make and quick as well.  Only problem was it left a little to be desired in flavor town.  Needed some onions and more seasoning for the gravy imo.

Loved this recipe over ashed potatoes and a side salad.  First time I made a gravy from scratch so I was totally excited.  Have made this many times and the hubby loves it.

Yummy, simple! AIRBORNE-CHEF's additions of garlic powder & onion powder & reducing salt = very good advice. I dashed some paprika on mine before serving. Wholesome and hearty recipe.

Followed recipe with the suggested additions of onion and garlic, I also had some ground sausage on hand with a couple of shakes of Cayenne. As a joke when I asked the Hubby what he wanted for dinner tonight he said SOS, well he's getting SOMP (Mashed potatoes)!

YUM!  I haven't had this since I was a child. It sure looks the same, I think the garlic and Onion make it smell and taste better!  Thank You for posting this recipe!

i haven't made something like this in a long time. i really enjoyed it and my picky 7yr old liked it (my toddler wouldn't try it) anyway yes its a bit bland but its one of those "adapt to taste" recipe. I'd saute some onions but i know my kids wouldn't eat it if they saw them in their food. so i added onion powder and a bit of garlic powder and a bit more salt. I used fat free milk around 1 3/4 cups just got it to the right consistency and left out the worcestershire..never liked the stuff

Good, but needs seasoning. I sautéd 1 chopped onion with the beef and still found it to be bland so I increased the wostershire and added a little granulated garlic. It came out quite good. Cheap and easy and very tasty with a little more seasoning.

I had to add too many things to this to rate it any more than a 3 star. After all my additions I would say it was still not quite a 4 star. It was a simple recipe but Im really not sure if I would cook this one again. We served over noodles.

I add some seasonings to this, but my purpose in using this recipe is because I love to have canned hamburger on hand for those quick nights where I need supper fast, and have some homemade bread to get used up. This is the perfect way to make something fast, and reminds me of my grandma's SOS when I was young. Thanks for reminding me of this recipe and for sharing.

I read most of the reviews before making this recipe.  I added fresh garlic, onion & fresh parsley & skipped the bouillon.  Used 2 cups of milk & blended the flour in the milk.  Served over egg noodles.  My husband told me this was a "keeper" after the first bite.  Will definitely make this one again.

My mother made this dish often only she served it over boiled potatoes and called it hamburger gravy.  Has been and always will be a family favorite.  My recipe is the same minus the worcestershire sauce, but that gives it a little zest.

Quick and easy to make, but I would rate it as being OK.  Nothing really special about it.  The taste was OK and the texture fine..it just wasn't a big hit around here. My husband being ex-military wasn't that impressed, and he always talked about this dish before. I did add onions and garlic to mine. No one wanted seconds and some did not even finish their first helping.

Awesome and sooo easy!  I used about 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce instead of just 1/4 tsp....not near enough!  I also used a little bit of cayenne pepper...gives it some heat!  This is a quick and easy meal that your family will love!

My mom use to make this as far back as I can remember,I have made it for years and now my daughter makes it...we always have it over mashed potatoes and we put some frozen corn in the gravy at the end....best comfort food that there is.....I really think that the secret to have a tasty and not bland tasting gravy is to be and season your hamburger while it is frying up...just a little salt and pepper and onion  powder will do the trick.  Great recipe.

This was really very good. I started off by sauteeing mushrooms with onions & garlic, added the beef & then continued on with the remaining of the recipe. Cheap, easy & tasty. Thanks so much for sharing.

Excellent!  I added Onion Onion and Garlic Garlic.. from Tastefully Simple.. to the ground turkey while it was cooking.  Also cut back on the worchestshire sauce.. only about 1.5 -2 tbsp.  I cooked about 8-10 oz of spiral noodles and layered them on the bottom of a 9x9 pan.  Poured creamed mixture over noodles, sprinkled with about 1/2 cup shredded white cheddar cheese and bread crumbs with butter..(2 finely chopped ends of a loaf of bread and 1 tbsp. melted butter)..cooked in oven 350 for 25 minutes... Everyone LOVED it!  Kids included!  =)  This is going to be made again and again!

This is a very good recipe, it was perfect for my family of picky eaters.  I used fat-free evaporated milk for more creamy texture with less fat.  It turned out quite thick, but I was able to add more milk a little at a time until I had the consistency I prefer.  Served over egg noodles, but would be delicious over biscuits for breakfast.

This was quite good, though somewhat bland without adding extra sea salt and pepper to taste.  I normally use a boxed Beef Stroganoff mix, which has frightening amounts of sodium, so this was a welcome change.  I also used reduced sodium beef boullion, so that may explain it having a little less flavor.  I do think it is a keeper though!

This was quick, easy, and everything is usually in my pantry.  It was pretty bland though.  If I make it again, I'll add some more spices, garlic, etc.

I made this last night for dinner.  As a latin I knew I would need more seasonings because salt, pepper, and a beef boullion cube just wasn't going to cut it so what I did was..  seasoned the ground beef with adobo, oregano, and Ms. Dash (The Yellow One) and then placed on a skillet to brown.  While that was going on I diced FRESH mushrooms, green bell perppers, and a yellow onion and sauteed them in a sepearate skillet with olive oil for about 15 minutes on a Medium setting.  As the meat was almost fully browned I threw in that mixture then followed the recips according to the instructions.  Entire Family loved it.  It was not dry. It had lots of liquid and it was very tasty!  GREAT RECIPE!

I made this for dinner tonight since it sounded quick. It was missing something. I might use this again if I need something quick and good.

Yummy! My husband is crazy about creamed chipped beef, but I on the other hand find it to be a bit bland. This has more taste than the chipped beef. I served this over egg noodles (with a touch of butter on them) and added a bit of salt seasoning. Next time I may add a little garlic and/or onions and some mushrooms. This is a great, easy recipe. Thank you!

Really delicious, quick and easy. This is a great meal when your cupboards are low! I added a few dashes of onion powder and served on egg noodles, even my picky 7 year old gobbled it down! Very versatile, next time I think we'll try it with a bit of green peppers in it! Thanks this is definitely a keeper :P

Ah good ole SOS.  I remember having this as a kid. A few days ago I was trying to figure out what to do with a package of hamburger so I came here and did a search and ran across this recipe.  I hadn't thought about SOS in DECADES.  Made it for supper and 4/5 recommended having it again.  Guess that's a good sign.  The other one is a fussy eater and said...mom you don't put "whatchamacallit" sauce in GRAVY.  Never should have let him see the bottle on the counter.  Oh the joys of mothering a teenage picky eater!

My mother made this for me when I was young.  The only difference is that she omitted the bouillon and the worcestershire sauce.  I make it now for my own children.  I like to have this for breakfast on toast.

This was perfect.  This was the second time i have made this recipe.  I changed up the seasonings, as the first time i made this i followed the recipe pretty much to a T and it was a little bland.  If you like it hot, this is the ticket.  Ground beef, two minced garlic cloves, and a small onion in the skillet.  At the flour stage i added the flour, salt, and 1/2 cup of diced tomato.  Then comes the milk and worchestershire.  At that point it's still a little bland.  I added (to taste) Cayenne, Cumin, extra salt, and a big grinding of course black pepper.  I left it to simmer for another ten minutes and then dumped it all over egg noddles.  Definitely a crowning accomplishment for something so simple.  my boyfriend and neighbor asked me to boil more pasta mid way through so they could have seconds! The flavor is awesome.  Might be nice with half green onions and half reg onions.  I would put this up against the Angel Chicken Pasta, also from this site, and another great recipe, if you haven't tried it.

This is definetly an add-on recipe! It is an EXCELLENT base to expand on! I have made this recipe numerous times adding onion, and various seasonings. My husband who was in the Army when I first made it said something to the effect of "This sure isn't the stuff they serve at the mess hall. Both my kids enjoy this as well!  A quick, simple recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!

Reading other's advice for improvements, I really re-worked this recipe and it tastes great!  I browned the meat, then added 1 onion and 1 large clove of garlic and cooked for about 3min.  Then I added 10oz of sliced, fresh mushrooms.  I seasoned with seasoned salt and Hungarian paprika for color.  I let the mushrooms saute until they became soft, and then I followed the recipe until the very end when I added about 1/2cup of canned corn and lots of fresh parsley.  I served this over egg noodles and the kids loved it!  Yummy.

I was worried this would be too bland after reading the reviews but with a few minor additions, my kids BEG for this.  And the other night when I announced I was making this, they were literally bouncing up and down all over the place like I had just said we were having banana splits for dinner. I wish I had the video camera going. The only changes I make are sauteing onions first to add to the ground beef and then once the sauce is going, adding a can of mushroom pieces, 2/3 cup of frozen corn, and a sprinkle of Emeril's Essence.  I serve it over egg noodles or biscuits. Comfort food at its finest!!!

I made this because I've always heard about SOS but have never had it before.  I must say, it is quite strange.  But I found it to be very good and very filling.  Took a bit longer than 10 minutes to absorb the flour and get as thick as I liked.  But it was worth it.  Definitely not something you serve to guests.  LOL

I don't see why people are complaining about it being bland.  It just leaves room for the cook (me!) to tweak the recipe to their liking.  I add onion powder and garlic powder, and sometimes an onion and fresh mushrooms.  I love this stuff.  It's quick and easy and makes great leftovers!

I used ground turkey and extra wortscheshire (however the heck you spell it), to try to add some flavor to this recipe.  If you have picky eaters, they may love this because it is so basic and bland.  My two year old chowed down!  

This would be a great recipe to add things to i.e. mushrooms, garlic, onions, seasoning, etc.

My Dad was a cook for the Army and the only way to make this is over a baked potato or toast. Leave the boulion out and leave war sauce (worcesershire) out.  i think you will be much happier to season it with salt and pepper as you please.

Maybe if you do the sauteed suggestions (which I did not) this dish would be tasty.  My family thought this recipe was very, very bland.

I generally like bland dishes, but this was a little too bland-like meat flour milk.  I even tried cooking onion and a clove of fresh garlic with it, and later doubling the worcesteshire (sp?) sauce, but no help.  The texture was delightful, though, so I gave it a 3 stars--just missing something.

This has become a tried and true standby in our house. It's so comforting and SO good! At first I had a hard time getting my hubby to try it...it's not pretty to look at, but he's sold on it! I usually add more Worcestershire and sometimes throw in some pimentos or a hit of Tabasco. Delicious over toast and perfect now that the weather is cold. Not fancy at all....just GOOD!

Pretty bland.  Edible, but bland.  I was looking for a recipe for this because my mom used to make it a lot when I was a kid.  Her recipe was much better.  I know she used a lot of onion and cooked it with the beef.  I'm an "army brat" so my family is very familiar with S.O.S.  My grandma told me she used to make it with smoked salmon (added at the very end of cooking) or bulk sausage, for more flavor.  We always served this over toast.

I had tried this recipe about a year ago, then totally forgot about it until tonight...haven't been grocery shopping in over a week, but who doesn't have most of these ingredients on hand?  Even me!  I read the reviews and thought about embellishments (couldn't remember if I'd added any the last time I made it), but since I really didn't have any, I made it completely as is, and served corn on the side.  It was fantastic!  Served it over toast because I wanted something fast, and the combination of the creamy gravy and the crunchy toast was great.  You can't go wrong with something so simple, we all just loved it.  It will definitely be making the rotation from now on!  Thanks Suzanne!!

I've made this numerous times for my husband. I keep trying new things but he says he'd rather have this. I don't add anything to it...just dump it on a piece of toast and watch hubby smile. 
This is easy to make, easy to freeze and reheat and easy to please a hubby with.

My husband and I were both in the Army. We had been missing the SOS dish they served once a week at our mess hall. I didnt know how it was made so I looked it up on here and tried this recipe and a couple others. THIS IS THE ONE!!! This is exactly how the Army makes it. All you vets out there, this is just like the mess hall ladies used to make. It made me miss having KP! lol
Thank you Suzanne, for the wonderful recipe that brought back the wonderful memories!

Very yummy! I added garlic and onion powder for a little more flavor, served over cheddar garlic biscuits (on this site). My 4 and 5 year olds loved it! Just like my dad used to make!

This was a surprisingly good recipe. My husband wasn't a huge fan, but I liked it. At first, I thought I had made a huge mistake when the ground beef floated around in the milk. But, the sauce thickened up considerably, and it was very good on toast.

This tasted like hamburger meat and flour.  I added onion powder and some italian seasonings and it still tasted like hamburger meat with flour.  I LOVE bland food but this is beyond my tastes...sorry

If you're looking for an easy, cheap comfort food to feed your family, this is it.  If you're used to foods with tons of seasonings and complex flavors, you're not going to find it here.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can easily adapt it to meet the needs and tastes of your loved ones.  And, as I said before, it's a cheap meal!

My husband was soo happy that I served him Army's SOS!!!.
He had talked about this before, but I didn't make the connection, so unwillingly I served him a dish of good memories.
I also addded sauteed onions, garlic and celery in butter, as long as more Worcestershire sauce that what the recipe calls for, a little tomato extract and some paprika.
I did this with mashed potatoes, but my husband absolutely insisted on having this on top of buttered toast.
Yes, the recipe is bland, it is an Army recipe after all, but you can fix it to taste.
All in all, I was able to serve my husband comfort food in a pinch, using few ingredients.
Thanks!!!.

Good but not great.  Like others, I too found this quite bland and somewhat undesirable.  I should have known better but I guess I was in the mood for something quick and simple.  My hubby wasn't to crazy for this either.  Thanks anyway.

This was a very nice change of pace. I added 1/2 an onion, and 1 tsp worchestershire sauce. I served it over buscuits with eggs. My husband loved it and so did the kids. Yummy!!!

Very good. I sauted some green onion, onion and garlic and added to the mixture. I also added Maggie seasoning instead of Worcestershire sauce. The second night I added corn, real diced tomatoes and black olives. I will do that from now on as it adds some color and flavor, not to mention veggies. It was a great dish.

This was pretty bland for my taste buds, but my little guy (2 yrs.) chowed it down (hence the 4 stars).  I added frzen peas & mixed it up with macaroni noodles.  Very easy, inexpensive & a good way to sneak in those veges.  Thanks Suzanne.

GREAT BASIC RECIPE FOR YOUR COLLECTION. Add noodles and sour cream for a dish better than Hamburger Helper. I've added spincich, garlic,  noodles and sour cream and everyone loved it. We didn't like it on toast but to each his own.

This was great!!!! I served it with Mashed Potatoes and bisquits and my dh & ds loved it and so did I. It is so simple to make with a few ingrediants- I'm adding this to my regular menu. I did add a little bit of seasoning salt like a few others suggested, but I think it would of tasted great without it too.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit! My husband asked what I was making and he remembered his mom making this when he was a kid. He said she served it over boiled potatoes so that's how we had it. This one's a keeper. Thanks Suzanne for sharing.

Excellent!  I enjoyed this very much over some spaguetti and the hubby ate it on toast and we were both very impressed with it. Turned out awesome!  I also added some Red Hot sauce and it gave it a nice spicy tang to it!

My whole family loved this!  I added a little more Worcestershire to flavor it up a bit; we served it over mashed potatoes.  It was a very simple, quick meal.  It didn't reheat as well as I'd hoped, but it was great the first night.

This was very simple to make and very fast. I had dinner on the table in about 15 minutes.  I added a can of mushroom pieces and a little bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning. It's nothing fancy, but it sure does taste good!

Great recipe.....easy and tasty.  My hubby said and I quote, "You can make this again."  My daughter (13yrs. old), on the other hand thought is was okay.  She said she'd eat it again.  Wait 15 minutes, that opinion will pass!!!!  I served it over noodles.  If my son was home, I would have to double it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I also added further seasoning (an extra boullion cube, more soy sauce, garlic powder and onion), served it on toast and my family loved it. My husband (former Navy) informed me what the SOS really stands for and we had a chuckle! A quick, easy recipe using things on-hand...I'm sure it'll be made frequently here!

Really easy to make.  I put in some extra virgin olive oil while browning the beef, more or less doubled the amount of salt, pepper and Wostershire sauce and then added some garlic powder in the end. Was really great on top of mashed potatoes.

Great recipe.  I thought it was very tasty although my kids turned their noses up at it.  My husband liked it.  I will make it again.

Excellent recipe - I use it cooking for a church men's group.  I use 2# hamburger and 1# hot sausage and triple the rest of the ingredients (since you have 3# of meat instead of one). I also use powdered milk and water to make the required amount, though I mix the milk in with the other dry ingredients, mixing them in with the cooked meat, then add water to arrive at the desired consistancy.  Enjoy!

After reading previous reviews, I added 2 cloves of garlic while browning the meat.  Used seasoning salt and twice the Worcestershire sauce. It was yummy!

We have made this for several years.  Sometimes over pasta (various kinds) and sometimes over potatoes, even sometimes over toast!  Now that I am dairy free, I am wondering how to alter it.  Last time (starting the process of doing dairy free then), we did half regular milk, half almond milk, but I'm unsure if my hubby will do it with ALL almond milk.  Has anyone else tried it with either coconut milk or almond milk?

I don't use milk so I subbed cream of mushroom soup.  Added chopped fresh mushrooms and green pepper along w/the onion.  Still a bit bland.  Would make again with added seasoning

Sooooo many recipes for this classic! I decided on this one, and I'm happy I did. The family is now junkies for SOS (lol)! I used a tad more garlic and meat. This is the perfect fall back recipe for one of those "what do you want to do for dinner" situations. Thanks!

I had shy of a pound of meat, so I just eyeballed the ingredients.  I made it with a little garlic powder, onion powder, less salt, and more Worcestershire.  Very tasty and economical.  Will eat the other half for lunch tomorrow and definitely make again.  Thanks.

My family loved this recipe.  I even used almond milk instead of regular whole milk and it was delicious.  I added garlic and lots of worstishire sauce to the meat mixture.  I mixed the final product into egg noodles and served it with a green beans, corn and a biscuit. Great easy dinner.

I gave it 5 stars but I did change it as most people did. I added garlic, half an onion, onion salt, garlic salt, pepper and lots of red pepper flakes. It turned out great and with lots of flavor.

I made this same recipe for my husband and served over scrambled eggs. I thought it was wierd at first but he said that's how he had it in the army. The men were allowed either 2 sausages, 2 skimpy strips of bacon or ALL the s.o.s. they wanted! He chose the s.o.s. over his eggs every time. Good recipe!!

To all you "foodies" trying to add something so this isn't so bland, forget it!  This recipe has a history.  Legend has it that SOS was first served in France during WW1.  Originally, it was Boeuf a la sauce d' Argonne which had been prepared for the officers' mess, but with the impending battle no one was eating.  The Marines were moving fast and outpacing the field kitchens.  It was Army cooks who came up with the idea to fire up their field stoves and get hot chow to Marines advancing along the eastern front.  Slap a spoonful on a stale slice of white bread and enjoy.  PS the Marine version is better! (of course)

I was surprised I liked this so much. My husband loved it. It reminded us of a quick and easy beef stroganoff. I added a chopped medium onion, a few minced garlic cloves and a bit of rosemary. I also used 3 beef bouillon cubes instead of 1 and was much more generous with the Worchestershire sauce.

I give this 3 stars because it is not special.  It's pretty bland.  But, it's fine.  I cooked rice to go with it and together they were even better.

This is such a classic traditional comfort dish, I simply had to give it 5 stars.  I was in such a dreary mood today, I really needed a good old fashioned *food hug*.  With my tummy warm and full, I feel all snuggly now (grin).  I did drain beef, then went right to making the roux before returning beef to skillet.  Simple - certainly not gourmet - but a wonderful kitchen staple.

For what this is, it's fantastic. Quick and simple. Definitely add onions and fresh garlic. Consistancy is perfect. Heck of a lot better than in the box "hamburger assistant". As stated by other reviewers, this recipe can be built on....but then would it really be SOS? Thanks Mary 48! Do what you love and love what you do!

Great recipe that you can add ingredients to suit your own taste.  I added garlic salt, garlic, onion powder, ground sage, lots of pepper, green beans, corn & small pasta shells.  Kids loved it too!!!

My husband (Vietnam Vet) was craving SOS one night so I searched and found this recipe.  Here's what I did to "spice it up".  I added about twice as much worchestershire and several shakes of Tabasco sauce, and I added it after browning the flour and before adding anything else.  "cooked in it" before continuing. Also, I highly recommend using "Better than Bullion" brand reduction.  It's sooooo yummy and really adds a strong beefy taste.  I make this a lot and serve it over plain old Pillsubry biscuits from the exploding can.  DH LOVES it.

This is very similar to what an Air Force cook showed me back in 1975 when they had real enlisted cooks and not contractors who don't have a clue how to make this very traditional dish.  The only difference was that she added a very small diced onion just as the beef was turning brown and didn't use bouillon.  I still make this today, but I drain the beef if there is a lot of grease and add butter before adding the flour.  It's yummy, and great over homemade breakfast potatoes.

So easy, nice and PLAIN.  Didn't have any regular milk in the house so I used the bullion and just made broth.  Worked just fine for brown gravy.  Served on top of grilled sourdough.  Even my picky three year old ate it.

Omit the Worcestershire sauce and substitute garlic, then switch the beef bouillon to chicken broth, and this recipe is quickly changed to a great stroganaff as well!

This is one of my family's favorites and definitely a go to recipe when I'm not really in the mood to cook. I've been making it for years and I make it this same way except that I add onion. We usually have it over mashed potatoes instead of toast or biscuits. My husband likes to top his with corn.

Perfect comfort food.  I remember eating this growing up in the 60's.  Would never serve this except on mashed potatoes.  If using chipped beef, toast is the best.  I did as others and added onion and garlic to the beef while cooking.  Thank you for the recipe.

I loved this recipe! It's just one of those weeks when money is low and there isn't much left in the fridge/ freezer. I needed something fast, easy, cheap but would taste good too. This was great. I think I'll try adding mushrooms next time the ole' budget allows. :)

Very good, put it over rice.  Family members told me that it's usually called " on a Shingle" and put over toast....haha.  I doubled the recipe and it made great leftovers to bring to work.  Next time I think I'll add a chopped up carrot to the meat while it's cooking, to add a little flavor, and to make it prettier.  I did add about 2 tbsp of minced garlic and one chopped onion to the meat, which I'm glad I did...... I don't think it would've been as good without it.  I did use the advice of another reviewer and let the flour cook for a bit before adding the milk.  It did seem like a lot of milk at first but it did cook down into a nice gravy.  I was soooooo tempted to drain the fat from the ground pork, but I used lean ground beef, and I'm sure the fat helped with the gravy.

Perfect for a quick, easy meal that doesn't break the bank.  Per other reviews I added some garlic salt and onion powder to give a little more taste.  Came out great.  We served over egg noodles.  Thanks Mary48!

This was great! My USMC husband LOVED it. He has been begging me to make creamed beef for a long time. I've been looking for beef recipes that will work with ground bison as that is what we eat. This fit the bill. I doubled it and added some butter as bison is very lean, whole milk from the local dairy and organic worcestershire sauce. I also added sauted onions & garlic and a little parsley. I was so glad to find a recipe that doesn't call for a can of condensed soup. That stuff is vile.  Served over homemade buttermilk biscuits this was great.

Great Recipe! I just needed something quick to put together for myself, and it did the job. Since only cooking for myself I scaled the recipe to about 1/2. I did however add 2 cloves of garlic, half a white onion and some mushrooms. I also didn't have beef bouillon, but used chicken bouillon and that did the job.   Thanks for sharing!

I make a very simalar dish. I would reccomend eliminating the salt and add 1 or 2 more bullions cubes for flavor. My family loves it with corn added and over homemade biscuits. A good one when you can't decide what to make

This was quick and easy, but I thought it really lacked taste.  I remember having this growing up and it had a sweeter taste to it.  That being said, my husband, son and our dinner guest enjoyed it.  I likely won't make this again.  I served it with sweet peas and on whole wheat toast.

Not too bad, but it wasn't the same as the one my army dad used to make.  I make mine with onions, garlic and mushrooms that I add while the beef is browning.  I also take the easy way out and use cornstarch instead of flour.  I prefer to serve mine over rice or egg noodles instead of toast, but that's just a personal preference.  If you are looking to trim some calories, use very lean beef and use water instead of milk.  You may need to up the amount of beef base/bullion.  Just watch the salt, as it's in the bullion as well as the Worcestershire sauce.

I had never had this before but heard my father and husband refer to it from their days in the Army and Air Force.  We made a couple minor modifications, and even my hubby who was glad to get away from military food said it was good enough to make again.

I added some extra seasonings while browning the ground beef; 1/2 tsp of onion and garlic powder.  I did not have any noodles on hand, but had garlic mash potatoes.  It was ver well seasoned in combination with the potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I like this very tasty and hits the spot. My changes are did not add salt, added a can of cream of mushroom, added mushrooms, garlic powder, minced onion and only a cup of milk. Next time I wont add as much worchire and maybe throw some peas in there. Very good and easy.:)

A "5" because it was inexpensive,quick, easy and tasty. The color threw the kids off for a minute-but they liked the flavor. I served with buttered noodles and peas for a real old-fashioned comfort dinner.

My family really loved this recipe. I did follow some advice from others and just added a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder which worked really great with the rest of the ingredients.

We LOVED this!  After reading several reviews saying that the dish was low in taste I opted to use three bullion cubes instead of one and the taste was perfect.  We served it over bow-tie noodles but I am thinking it'll be just as great, if not better, served over biscuits or toast.  Yummy!

This was pretty good, I added 1/2 a large white onion (chopped), a little bit more salt, and more whorschter sauce. My husband liked it! It is very cheap and very easy. Can't go wrong with that.

My dad, a WWII Vet, used to make this for dinner when mom was sick.  I changed it a bit by  adding sliced mushrooms,sauteed onions, some garlic salt,  a can of cream of mushroom soup and baby peas. Served over toast--delicious! Brings back such memories

I think this was very tasty. Four stars because like everyone else, I changed some things. :) I sauteed some garlic and browned the beef in it. Also sauteed chopped onion in butter (maybe a handful) and added it at the end. Added freshly-ground black pepper and cut back to liquid to one cup--it just seemed like 2 1/4 was way too much. Maybe I'll give it a try one of these days though. All in all, this is a delicious recipe when it's the week of payday and you're running low on meals to stretch!

Quick, easy, comfort food.  Added onions and mushrooms as others had recommended.  It came together quickly and it was good, I will make this again.

A good basic recipe that is great when kicked up a notch:  cook meat with a diced onion, fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter and garlic, sour cream, etc.

While I liked that this was quick and simple to make, and that I also had all the ingrediants on hand, I didn't particularly care for the taste. It had a very floury taste to me, maybe part of the issue was that I used 97% lean ground beef so there wasn't enough fat the make a good roux, but I'm not sure. I did add tons of pepper, garlic and onion powders, ground mustard and some chili powder, but it wasn't enough to mask the flour. I'm glad that I tried this recipe, but I won't be making it again, sorry.

Good but a little bland for my taste.  My husband liked it.  On the advice of other reviewers I added 3 cloves garlic and one onion when browning the beef.  I also doubled the Worcestershire sauce.  Still bland.  I would suggest adding additional spices.

This is a great quick meal.  I add chopped onion with the ground beef and serve it over buttered toast.  It doesn't look so appealing, my 5 year old son said yuck.  But I told him it's what the soldiers eat, so he took a bite and really liked it!

I made this adding Rotel tomatoes, 2 garlic cloves and additional spices.  My husband liked it, but said it tasted like hamburger helper.  It would be great as an appetizer served on Ritz crackers using X-tra hot Rotel tomatoes! Not sure if I will make it for dinner again.

Thanks for the very easy and yummy recipe! I needed a recipe for ground beef that would take only a few minutes. I didn't have any onions in the house or I would have diced some up and added it to this recipe.  My kids ate it up and so did my husband! (and he's the hard one to please)

My husband loves this!  He's been in the Army for 14+ years and loves when I make this.  Because of some blood pressure issues I use sodium free bouillion and omit the extra salt.  Very easy to make and good on egg noodles or the classic toast.

Bland? ya somewhat. I sauted and onion and threw in some celery. I have a habit of destroying perfectly good recipies somehow but this one was good. I (of course) didn't have worchishire sauce so I put a little sage, seasoning salt and celery seed( yes celery seed)in it then had hot sauce, Soy sauce on the table. I put in soy sauce for myself and my kids (2yrs and 3yrs) My husband added hot sauce to his. we all ate it and enjoyed it. Not my favorite recipe of all time but I don't enjoy spending lots of time on a meal that my kids don't eat! I'll keep this one in my recipe box for sure!

I was a cook in the army and used to love this. This tastes exactly like it! I was thrilled to have found this recipe again. Thanks!

Okay, so I'm reviewing and giving 4 stars... however I did have to tweak this. I added extra Worcestershire sauce and some cayenne pepper. With these tweaks it tasted pretty good over mashed potatoes. Will make again with the changes!

Tastes just fine but it's brown in color. The real army sos was white in color. Probably from the over-abundance of flour in their recipe. The other plus is that you don't have to hit the latrine 3/4 hour after you have eaten. I won't speculate why! I added 1/2 handfull of vertically cut onion; two shakes of garlic powder; two shakes of sage. Sauted the onion first then added the hamburger and followed the recipe. Put the SOS over biscuits that I made from this site using the bulk biscuit mix recipe. Good flavor but not outstanding so it only gets 4 stars. Mix and match your own spice ideas until you come upon a mixture you like.

This was fantastic! Very quick and easy to make and a big hit all around.  Using ideas from other reviewers, I reduced the milk to 1-1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup sour cream, as well as added 1/4 cup finely chopped orange pepper and 2 finely chopped shallots. I was jealous there was only enough leftovers for one of us to take to work for lunch today. :(

I'd be willing to bet I haven't had this for almost 40 years, and my sweetie says he hasn't had it since he was in the service.  I needed something quick, remembered seeing this being reviewed, and figured, "sure, why not?"  I question if there's a lot of really great nutritional value, (I swapped out the hamburg for chipped beef, which is the way I remember it, and made a roux using the proportions given, slowly whisked in the milk, whisked it smooth and then added the chipped beef, omitted the salt but otherwise followed the directions).  It's fast, filling, economical, and nostalgic.  Reasons good enough to make it again.

I use sausage instead of ground beef and it's one of our favorite breakfast recipes.  We just pour it over biscuits...My daughter asks for it all the time.

My mom use to make this all the time.  Instead of worcestershire sauce and boullion she used cream of mushroom soup.  She then poured it over mashed potatos or rice.  I prefer this recipe and added extra seasonings.  Thanks for the post.

I thought it was strange that there was no call for garlic so I added it (I have a ground beef/garlic rule), which I'm glad I did because it gives it a different dimension.  My boyfriend LOVED this recipe, especially after I added sour cream for creaminess!

This is a quick, easy meal that's well liked in our household.  We have made it often, and have served it several different ways like over toast, rice, and egg noodles.  Recipe is good the way it is, but It's an easy recipe to modify to your taste.  I like adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sour cream to thicken it up a bit more.  I also use garlic salt in place of regular salt.  I add a bit more bouillon & worcestershire to suit my taste.  You could even throw in frozen peas and carrots.

I make creamed ground beef at least once a month, but I never could get much flavor in it until now.  This was very good.  I will diffently be making it this way from now on.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a big hit! Added a half chopped onion. Omitted the boullion cube..too lazy to crush it up, peppered it real good, and used half teaspoon Worcestershire.  Served over toast.

Some people complain about this being bland, but you just have to season to your taste.  It was so comforting to eat this again.  My mom used to make it when I was little.  When I made it, I didn't have bullion so I used about a tsp. of beef demi-glace.  I chose to add onions, garlic, basil and more salt and pepper.  I loved it on buttered white toast, and I tried eating parmesan on top.  It was sooo yummy, I ate three open-faced sandwiches.  I hope you all enjoy it!

The family liked it! We've had it several times and served it on something different everytime-Toast,potatoes, or rice.  We added a some seasons that cater to our New Mexican taste buds (Tabasco, chile powder, or green chile), but other than that it is great.

This just seemed kind of blah to me.  It was quick and easy to prepare but I've done the same type of recipe with instant brown gravy mix and had better, more flavorful results.  It was just OK, however my 3 year old son LOVED it.  He ate two good sized portions of it and thanked me for making it.

I could tell during cooking that this was going to be a bit bland so I doubled (at least, I just guessed) the worchestershire sauce, and ended up stirring in a cup of sour cream.

It turned out like stroganoff.   Very easy.  I'll make it again!

This was pretty good, and was a fast made meal. Instead of bread or mashed potatoes, I poured it over home-made cornbread. This was a great spicy/sweet mixture. I will make this again.

My family thought this was great! I didn't even have worcestershire sauce (I thought I did), and it turned out very well. We did use suggestions from other reviews adding more flavor with garlic, cayenne..etc. I'll use this for a good gravy recipe from now on.

My Mom makes a recipe similar to this for my Dad (retired Army also), but she would substitute a jar of that dried beef that you can find.  Also served over toast or biscuits.  One of my Dad's favs.

I grew up eating something like this...we called it "hamburger gravy" and we ate it over mashed potatoes.   When I made this I added a chopped onion and two cloves of garlic (everything tastes better with garlic!).  I also had to play with the seasonings because what was listed wasn't enough (for our tastes).  I ultimately added a lot more pepper and salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.   I also added a can of corn and served it over egg noodles.  It was yummy!

Good tasting, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Reminded us of biscuits and gravy with beef instead of sausage!

This is a super easy recipe that tastes good, too (if you like this sort of gravy/meat mixture).  My husband suggests it every time I am not sure what to make for dinner, or am not in the mood to cook.  Our 3 yr old likes it too.  We've been serving it on toast, either as an open-faced sandwich or cut into points.  It would be good with mashed potatoes, too.  

One thing I have been doing is adding the worcestershire after the flour & bouillon (before the milk).  I tend to add more than the 1/4 teaspoon worcestershire because it just doesn't seem like very much.

The family really loved this, I had mine over toast but the rest of them had it over noodles and just loved it.  I used a clove of minced garlic which added some extra flavor.  Great!

Very good and sooooo easy!!!  I added a little more worcestershire because we love it so much and also added garlic powder when cooking the meat for a little extra flavor.

My husband is gluten intolerant so can't have flour, toast, or traditional noodles.  I left out the flour and mixed cornstarch with the milk instead, then served over rice.  I added some onion and garlic for a little more flavor.  I think I might throw in some mushrooms next time. A hit with my family and very easy, this is a keeper.

I made it just as it said, except I added only onions. I thought with 300 reviews and 4 1/2 stars, it had to be good. It even sounded ok in the recipe. Wrong.

My family is japanese hawaiian and I remember that my aunt used to make a dish similar to this when I was little.  Naturally, instead of serving it over egg noodles or toast, we had it with sticky rice.  I made this tonight and pretty much followed the recipe as is (I added the bullion a little late... I'm not a big fan and thought it would be fine with just the salt, pepper, worscheshire and an addition of garlic powder, but after a taste test, I realized that it was needed.)  I sauteed some onions (I would have put them in, but the kids would have liked it that much less) on the side for my hubby and I because I figured he would want it jazzed up a bit and served a green salad on the side for all of us.  My picky 6 year old gobbled it up and declared it the best thing I've ever cooked (last night I made chicken parmegiana from scratch... thanks a lot kid!)  My 10 year old said it was great, but he's a foodie and loves just about everything.  I really liked it and it brought back memories of my childhood, but my husband said it was "interesting" and that he couldn't get past the way it looked.  He said that when he closed his eyes and didn't look at it, he thought it was good.  Oh well, three out of four... overruled!

I like it with ground turkey and chicken bouillon.  I also add some frozen peas, and serve it over egg noodles.  Yesterday, though, was the best ever... I served it over orzo, which mixed in nicely.  I might add a little paprika for color next time.

This recipe needed a ton of help.  

Add garlic salt (1 tablespoon), use 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce, add 1/4 cup more flour.  Even then though, lacked any real kick or flavor.  Wouldn't make again, sorry!

I remember this from childhood but I didn't have the recipe.  My Mom called it hamburger gravy. It was good then and good now.  You can add whatever spices or veggies you like (garlic, onion, mushrooms etc.) to jazz it up if you want to. I've made it over both rice and mashed potatoes. It's easy on the budget too.  Thanks Suzanne!

Quick, easy and delicious. I love the fact that, aside from the ground beef, this recipe uses things readily at hand in a moderately stocked pantry. I was honestly thrilled that it tasted so good. My family loved it!

I followed the additional suggestions by all viewers by adding chopped onions, minced garlic, garlic powder, extra Worcestershire sauce, paparika, and dried basil. However, I felt this dish was still a little on the bland side. Easy to make, however, I dont think we will be eating this again.

Not too bad, but pretty bland.  I used ground turkey instead of beef because we prefer it.  Then I added one teaspoon of Worcestershire,garlic powder and onion powder.  My toddler didn't complain but didn't eat much either.  Her dad had seconds.  I may play with this recipe more at some point.

This recipe was so simple and quick!  Great to throw together on a week night.  I followed others advice and used two boullion cubes, and a little extra worcestershire sauce.  I also used a can of cream of chicken and a can of milk, plus a little bit extra.  It was a little salty for my tastes, next time I wouldn't add any extra salt.

Simple food, simply taste good... I added 2 cans of celery soup and I took the advice of other reviewers by adding minced galic, chopped onion, sliced mushrooms, a pinch of paprika and dried basil. Then added some more worchestershire for taste. Oh, one more thing...THIS MUST BE GOOD FOR BEEF CHIPS (instead of ground beef), then serve it over rice or noodles.

I loved this recipe! I made it exactly as is (didn't take anything away or add anything). My five y/o is the pickiest eater and he even loved it. He said it smelled better then Daddy's cologne! :-)  I served it over toast but will try it over the garlic cheese biscuits next. Also, I will always have the ingredients on hand for a last minute meal and it's so quick and easy to make it will be a good dinner before my sons soccer practices and games.

THIS RECIPE WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! BESIDES TASTING GOOD, IT WAS EASY TO MAKE, HAS LOTS OF ROOM TO EXPAND, THE KIDS LOVED IT (EVEN THE LITTLE ONES) AND VERY CHEAP TO MAKE!! THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WAS USING BEEF BASE INSTEAD OF BEEF BOUILLON BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE BOUILLON, LESS SALT AND WE ADDED FROZEN BROCCOLI DURING THE SAUTE PROCESS. THE KIDS HELPED MAKE IT AND WE PUT IT OVER ELBOW NOODLES AND IT TASTED LIKE A VERY YUMMY BEEF ROAST!! LOVE THOSE GROUND BEEF RECIPIES!! THANKS SO MUCH! :)

Mo family loved this with onion, garlic, mushrooms, more pepper, more worcestershire and a touch of sherry.  It's similar to beef stroganoff without the sour cream, and it's a nice change.  My only problem is with the name.  If I told my kids what it's called, they'd never eat it, so I leave off the Army SOS part.  Of course, there's nothing particularly appealing about Creamed Ground Beef either.  Also, 1 pound of ground beef won't make 6 to 8 servings, at least at our house.  I'd say you should only count on 4 servings unless you're feeding small children.

I had to add a can of cream of mushroom soup. I served this over egg noodles. This is almost like beef stroganoff (I make mine with sour cream and cream of mushroom soup. I guess with the soup added I might use this if I don't have any sour cream but it just didn't have enough flavor for us.

This is great.  Very easy and fast.  I added a chopped onion and mushrooms to cook along with the ground beef and I added 2 bouillon cubes instead of 1.  I served it over texas toast and my husband and I both enjoyed it quite a bit.

The title of this recipe caught my attention since my husband is in the army and so I thought I'd try it out. I made it last night for dinner and put it on top of white rice. It was so simple and delcious. My husband said that I can make this recipe anytime I want because he absolutely loved it. He said that putting it on rice is what made it so good. I will definitely keep this recipe in mind whenever I have nights that I need to get something good and hot on the table FAST! Thanks Suzanne!

Doesn't look very appetizing but it's actually good. It got thumbs up all around and it required almost no work for the cook! We added onions, and next time I'll use another dash of black pepper or even a few more drops of Worcestershire. It gets 4 stars not for appearance, but for being good, easy, quick and economical.

i have to say this recipe is very tasty but more than that my two little boys love the army and for them this was great.  my brother is in the service and sent us army trays(those big silver ones you see in the movies) and that is what i served it on.  they got the biggest kick out of this recipe.

I really enjoy this recipe.  I have been using it since August or September of 2002 and it is a hit everytime I fix it.  Sooo easy and really tasty.  The first time I fixed it I used a pot roast seasoning pack rather than the beef cubes and it was even tastier!  :-)  Thanks.

I made this for my family the other night.  My husband wouldn't even try it, but my mother said it was a lot like what her mother used to make.  I used seasoned salt instead of salt.  Next time, I will add a little more seasoning and double the sauce.  Yummy and easy!

hubby liked it and it was very easy to make...  also a good standby since all of the ingredients are usually on hand.  I don't think I'd ever make it for guests, but will make again for us.

also served with egg noodles...  may have added extra pepper too.

Excellent recipe, very easy and delicious!  I have a family of 7 and 5 are kids, they all love it, and it saves me so much time in the kitchen.  I usually make hot biscuits and serve this over them.  And there are just a few ingrediants in the recipe, which makes it even better.  You will love this one!  P.S.  I add salt and pepper to tast, good stuff here!

This is what it is "Sh*t On a Shingle".  But if you are like my husband and love SOS than this a a great, easy recipe.  It is what I make when I want something quick and don't have much of anything in the house.

This is a great recipe when you have few ingredients on hand, and only a little time. I added more worchestershire sauce to taste and served it over boiled potatoes.  It certainly was tasty and will keep this recipe on hand for those days when we need something to fill our tummies but not a lot of time to cook.

This is similar to what my mother used to make. I will make this again, but I will saute an onion with the ground meat. Then I will add a little more seasonings and more worschestire sauce. I served this on a baked potato for myself. Good recipe, thanks.

This was a tasty and quick meal that we plan on adding to the rotation. Not fancy or for guests, but great for those nights when you don't feel like doing too much. Green beans and applesauce rounded out our meal.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't have boullion cubes, so added a generous spoonful of boullion granules.  I also put in a can of mushrooms.  We tried it over baked potatoes and biscuits...Yum!  Even my finicky kids ate it.

My husband was suprised to come home to find that I had made this dish.  He hadn't had it since he left the Army. I served it over scrambled eggs with toast on the side. He loved it and so did my 5 year-old, to my delight.

I agree with a few of the raters that the taste was alittle bland. But just adding onion powder/salt and garlic salt to it- make it VERY GOOD. I poured it over rice and had veggies and a salad. My picky family loved it! It doesn't look appetizing but for being so simple- it's really good!

I found it quick and easy, but I added onion while browning the beef and corn
while thickening the sauce. It was good but needed more Worcestershire, which I
added before serving, as well as some garlic powder and lemon pepper.

After browning the beef, I drained the excess fat off then I added an extra beef boullion cube for extra flavor.  Instead of toast, I poured it over "dirty potatoes".  (mashed potatoes made with the peels left on!)  It tasted just like I remember in school.  My 8 year old loved it!

Very close to the actual recipe from the Army Quartermaster Corps, which I found elsewhere, but this isn’t a “serves 100” recipe.  The main difference is this includes beef bullion and the Army uses powdered milk.  It turned out very well, but needs more of the gravy portion.  I ate the Army version thousands of times in my 12 years of service.  This good enough for THIS old soldier!.

Classic. Great as is. It comes together quickly and really stretches a pound of ground beef. We love it on toast, but it's fine with just about any starchy side. My husband even ate it as a dip with tortilla chips. Sometimes I sub a few dashes of Maggi or Knorr liquid seasoning for the Worcestershire sauce. Oh, and if you use ground breakfast sausage instead you get lovely sausage gravy for biscuits.

I modified this recipe like a lot of others. I diced up a small onion with the ground beef. used beef base instead of a bullion cube. I also threw in a bag of frozen peas at the end.i thought the dish could use some color.  i also added a lot of ground black pepper and used seasoned salt. I'm not sure how much Worcestershire sauce I added but it was more than original recipe.  served over egg noodles.
it's a good little recipe and easily modified to your own seasoning preference! I would definitely make again.

Perfet
Be sure to cook 5 minuets after adding the flour to get it sticking to the bottom them scape off after the milk is added.
I had this in the Army and it is just the same as we ate.

This is such a rich comforting dish. It has such a creamy flavor and would go great paired with green beans or broccoli on the side.

I was surprised that this was actually good. I tried it because my husband loves ground beef dishes and he did like it. Made it as is( always do the first time and then change to our tastes). Next time I may change a few things but pretty good as is.

This one of my favorite prepare and eat quick meals. I made a couple small changes. I chop up an onion and add it to the skillet while browning the ground beef. Also I like to add one half teaspoon of minced garlic to the skillet during the browning process. I add some worcestershire sauce to taste. Instead of regular milk, I make it creamier by using buttermilk. Not everyone is a fan of buttermilk like me but I love the flavor and texture it gives the meal. Not as much flour is needed when using the buttermilk. I have found that I dont need the salt when I use the other flavor enhancements of onion, garlic and worcestershire sauce. Tastebuds may vary. LAST: I love to pour this over hash brown potatoes with two over easy eggs on top. YUMMM.

I made this for my former Airforce husband.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added 1 tsp each of onion powder and garlic powder.  It was good, however, it turned out a little floury - meaning it tasted a little floury.  I cooked the flour with the beef for the five minutes listed, but I think should have cooked it longer before adding the liquid.  All in all, it was pretty good and I'll make it again.

Saute 1 small onion then add ground beef. 
Add a couple garlic cloves. 
Use dried basil (2 tbsp ish) or pesto to season.

I had some onion, red pepper and peas to get rid of so I thought I would use this as a base for the using up of the veggies. I ididn't change anything othe than add those vegetables. I sauteed the onion and pepper a few minutes before adding the hamburger. Once it was all cooked I added the ingredients as directed. As to the reviews that call this bland you could add salt but sometimes bland is okay. I've always been curious about Army SOS and I'm glad I used this recipe. We really enjoyed this dish.

I have made this recipe multiple times.  It is quick and easy; perfect for busy weeknight!  Usually served it over mashed potatoes.   Yes, you can spice it up a bit to your preference.  All being said it is a great basic recipe and has been a definite keeper in this gal's quick meal toolbox!

After reading all of the mixed reviews I didn't get my hopes up, but ended up being very impressed with this dish. I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand. I browned my ground beef in the microwave,  and had intended on making a roux with the flour using butter instead of grease from the meat. So, I melted butter in the micro and dissolved the bullion in that. I also only had dehydrated onion instead of fresh so I let this soak in the bullion mix too. Only to discover I was out of flour. I did however have two packs of brown gravy. I poured the bullion butter, and gravy packs, Milk, salt, pepper, and Garlic powder in the skillet. Soon as it started to thicken I added the browned beef, a can of mushrooms, and a half can of corn. I didn't drain the mushrooms because I wanted to thin out the "gravy" a little. I served it over rice, and it did not disappoint. It reminds me of a hamburger helper almost. Hubby and 15 year old loved it. Zero leftovers. Next time I think I will mix the rice and gravy together, top with parmesian and bake in the oven to make more of a casserole. Very good, and the only reason  I only gave 4 stars is bc I changed the recipe so much.

I made this recipe with 1 Tbsp worchester, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1 tsp chicken bullion (because I was out of beef bullion).  Here's how it stacked up for our family of four that includes a picky 12-year-old and 10-year-old.  Kid Rating: Thumbs up!  They both want to have it again.  Adult Rating: Ambivalent to not-so-good.  With virtually no flavor there was nothing to dislike, but also nothing to like.  Neither of us would crave it again, but neither of us would protest if the other made it.  Visual Appeal: A big, fat goose egg.  The final product was an unappealing taupe color that congealed quickly.  None of us thought it appeared appetizing.  We all agreed that it tasted better than it looked.  Preparation Rating: Very quick and easy!  I was pleased that I was able to throw it together quickly on a day when we had very few food options in the house.  Overall, this recipe has it's merits--namely ease of preparation and kid-friendliness.  But it also has some significant drawbacks: unappetizing appearance and bland taste.  It really does need some significant tweaking to add flavor.

Even my picky kids like this, it is my go to when I am running out of groceries...or looking for some comfort food.  Tastes good over pasta, rice or mashed potatoes.  I do like to season with extra pepper and garlic.

Very authentic SOS. This is an army breakfast staple.
Home fries topped with SOS then 2 eggs.
Salt and pepper them.
If its too bland hit it with a health blast of "Sriracha sauce"
Or make a shingle, white toast. I like to tear it up then smother it.

I have not tried this yet but I will.  I ate a lot of SOS in the Navy, but that version was like sloppy joe over toast. I never thought about putting the beef in a gravy, but sounds good.

This was GREAT!!  Easy, fast, and simple. Served it over egg noodles. Used basically what Cody added to it to give it flavor, but I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and not as much milk. It turned out amazing in about 20 minutes start to finish, and cost me about $9 dollars to make. Can't really tell how much of each ingredient I used cause I'm kinda a flavor to taste kinda guy. Just use Cody's recommended ingredients and that can of soup and season to taste. You could literally feed an army with this also. Enjoy!!  I did!!

This was pretty good. My family liked it. Like others commented, ground beef tends to be bland so extra seasoning is a must. I sautéed a whole small onion with salt and pepper and 2 cilantro bouillon. I added 2 pound ground beef since that's what I had. Seasoned again with a little more salt and pepper. I brown my meat on medium heat and not stir very much. I find if I brown it higher than that and stir to much, the meat tends to toughen. It does take a bit longer to cook but worth the wait. Once browned, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and let it cook 1-2 minutes. I used 1/2 cup flour since I had 2 lb meat. I was able to use the same amount of liquid measurements the recipe calls for (2 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce). It was the perfect amount even though I had more meat. I served over white jasmine rice. Nice quick dish for a weeknight meal. Thank you!

Skip the beef bouillon and add a can or two of Campbell's Beefy Mushroom soup to this recipe.  You will taste the difference, really good flavor.

I liked the recipe however I had to use soy milk. YOu can make it two ways add more flour or leave out some milk. I added about a table spoon more flour to get the thickened state. Soy milk is all my family drinks due to milk allergies. Great recipe but this is just a alternative way to do this. Military spouse love that I can do a themed supper on occasion for my navy husband

Decent and quick.  Family all enjoyed the meal.  However, it was bland with only Worcestershire Sauce and S&P.  I omitted the salt as the bouillon had enough of its own.  Next time I'm adding some nicely browned mushrooms and onions.  Will definitely make again with some modifications.  Yum

It's a good recipe but I make it by scrambling the beef with chopped onions and garlic, then removing it from the pan, I make a rue sauce with the drippings.
I don't use Worcestershire. Then salt and pepper to taste.

Very easy, quick, tasty meal. I had all of the ingredients, except for Worchestershire. I substituted Teriyaki Sauce & it was good. I probably used more than 1 cube of beef bullion because I used Knorr Caldo con sabor de Res (Beef) bullion in the jar & also I doubled up on the pepper. I served over instant mashed potatoes because that was all I had. Yummy!

Great recipe! I browned the beef along with 1 chopped onion, added a bit of red-hot chili as my husband likes it spicy. Also stirred in 1/2 cup of shredded parmigiano reggiano cheese at the end along with spaghetti (as I wanted to make white sauce pasta) and sprinkled with oregano. I know I made lots of modification but this is a great base recipe for me and my DH loves it! oh, I didn't have any whorcestershire sauce, so used none but still tasted great.

Good recipe.  I am sure Worcestershire sauce was not available in the Army when they got to eat this, but it adds flavor.

I added a non measured amt of Worschestire sauce and added garlic and onion and pepper flakes. Served with Penne Pasta. Yummy!

So good!!!!  And so easy!!!!  I didn't need 6 servings, so I cut in half.  Still used a full boullion cube though with no salt.  Kinda balances things out.

I gave this a five because my husband ( a former Marine) and son raved about it. My husband said this was what he remembered. The only change I made was replacing the flour with cornstarch to thicken the mixture. I served these over butter biscuits and the flavor was fantastic!

This is a fast and easy dinner, but the best way to serve it is over eggs and toast! Place 2 pieces of toast on your plate. Cover with scrambled eggs and then the SOS!!! Mix it up and use sausage instead of ground beef for more of a breakfast dinner.

This was a good, fast, and cheap dinner which is always nice. Of course it's not something you'd serve to company, but it does the job. The only changes I made were that I used more worcestershire sauce, at least a tablespoon, and I also used some season salt. Wasn't bland at all as some other reviewers had stated. Good for a fast and cheap meal :)

I used to make pinwheels, and made a homemade gravy using the grease from the ground beef.  No one really LOVED the pinwheels, SO this was an excellent alternative recipe that would give me the gravy flavor that we liked....with the meat in it.  Then we could put it over our biscuits like biscuits and gravy.  It was really good.

This was surprisingly good.  On the advice of others I kicked it up a little with a generous amount of Worcestershire sauce, some onion, and a good bit of coarse black pepper.  I think I will be returning to it for a quick weeknight dinner.

This was a simple economical meal.  My dad used to fix this when I was little.  He ate it quite a bit when he was in the Army.  I, like other reviewers seasoned the meat, and added onion and garlic.  I actually made the "creamed gravy" seperate, and then added the meat to it.  I served mine over homemade biscuits with a side of steamed peas.  Dad usually served ours on toast points and occasionally on biscuits.  I had to laugh when I saw the SOS.  I wander if it stands for what I think it stands for?  Thanks for a simple recipe that takes me back.

I like this recipe, it is just lacks the wow factor. I will make again, seeing as you don't need a whole bunch of special ingredients. Good for quick suppers when you don't want to run to the store.

I had never heard of S.O.S. before, I was just looking for something simple I could fix because i was sick of being in the kitchen. It was great! With changes, of course. I did add lots of seasoning (garlic and onion powder, touch od cayenne) chopped onion and bell pepper and ever threw in some leftover canned corn. It was tasty over mashed potatoes. Next time I'll try some peas for a heartier meal. Thanx!

This was my favorite breakfast item in the military.  When I make it at home I add a can (drained) of diced tomatoes and some other spices.  I serve it with cheesy scrambled eggs and biscuits.  Yummmmm!

While it wasn't bad, it was, like everyone else said before adding their own things in, bland. It's definitely a great starter to make more interesting, but I don't think I'll cook it again because I'm not that creative ;)

I Love this recipe, you can eat it over rice, over egg noodles,over hash browns for breakfast, or over toast ( a shingle). You can doctor it up how ever you like, for breakfast I put a little sausage in with the hamburger, for dinner I sprinkle a little garlic powder and more pepper. My kids love it as much as I do, the first few times I made it they would say yuck I’m NOT eating that then after I got them to try it they wolfed it down and asked for more. My dad used to make it for us he was a military vet. And I used to have it in the chow hall when I was in the army.

This was good, but needs more seasonings or it would have been bland...  I added minced garlic, onion powder, and little paprika.  I think with the amount of liquid this recipe could also take another buillion cube as well and maybe omit the added salt.  It's an easy dinner to make when all you have is ground beef!  We ate it on toasted french bread.

I didnt expect to love this dish going in just b/c it is S.O.S. So it was easy to prepare, I did add some green peppers and onions. All in all I will make it again when I am low in the ingrediants department! (Also I made it w/egg noodles, I think this would have the full effect on toast, hence the "shingle")

Great recipe! A couple tweaks: I added some chopped garlic and a bit of SOY SAUCE. Even my roommate loved it!!!

Well, it is what it is - fast, tasty, cheap and filling.  Thanks for reminding me of this old standby.

This is a great and simple meal. We always serve it on egg noodles. Favorite of the whole family.

I really liked this recipe, but my fiance was "iffy" on it.  I think it was the milk that bothered him... if he hadn't seen me put it in, he probably wouldn't have had a problem!  :)

It was very easy, and I may try to make it again and use less milk or more seasonings.

Don’t forget the bullion on this one! My kid’s didn’t like this at all. Even the "I'll eat anything" one. My youngest couldn’t get past the presentation. If there is a way to spruce it up I would. It was very bland. I don't think I could get away with making this homestyle hamburger helper again.

All the qualities of a great recipe! Cheap, quick, easy and tasty! I flavored my ground beef a bit extra with garlic powder and onion, other than that followed the recipe exactly!  Will definitely make again!

This was just ok in my opinion.  However, I did make it according to Cody's suggested changes -- maybe I should try it again according to the original instructions and see if we like it any better...  I'll let you all know!

I didnt have the beef cube, but I made it anyway and it was actually really good. I added some garlic salt on top of mine and it gave it that little bit of a flare. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would!

This recipe was only good after it has been modified (a lot) which to me means that it is not the recipe itself.  Once I added a can of mushroom soup, a can of onion soup, garlic salt, onion salt, and seasoning salt...it was quite tasty. The original recipe is definitely lacking in flavor.

This was just so-so.  A very filling meal but rather bland on the flavoring.  I followed the recipe as written but if I make it again I'll try to get some more flavor in there.  Maybe saute a small diced onion?

This is great.  For a different taste, use evaporated milk instead of real and skip the whats-this-here sauce, hehe!  Don't forget to throw in some dried parsley.  You an also use the chipped or bottled beef slices diced up, instead of the beef.  Or, try some ground up pork and beef and lamb, for your meat base for this receipe.  This really fills you up for beakfast on a cold morning!  Oh, I forgot.  This receipe is S_____ on a Sningle, so try it on top of two slices of buttered toast!  Change the type of bread and rolls for a different taste.  Not just on top of noodles!

Excellent dish! I added 2 beef bouillion cubes and a onion but left everything else the same. My 6 year old snarfed down his plate in 3 minutes and then asked for another helping.

This was just okay. I doubled the worcestershire and sauteed a clove of garlic with the beef. I also threw in a can of mushrooms. It was definitely still lacking in flavor and it was a bit thicker than I would normally prefer. I might play around with this again, though since it is so quick. Thanks.

I made this for my family, after reading the reviews I added onions, I would have added mushrooms if I would have had any on hand, also plenty of garlic and season salt. It was very yummy! My husband loved it as well as my 3 year old son. I served it over biscuits with green beans. It thickened nicely, very simple, made with items that most have on hand. 4 stars because it's a good base to work from, can easly change the flavors by adding personal ingredients. Next time I am going to add a bit more milk, bacon and shredded cheddar cheese and make a bacon cheese burger soup.

Good basic recipe. Needs some work but is easy to make into many different versions, add some garlic & Italian seasoning for Italian flair, onions & mushrooms and parsley for American flair, or add chili powder & cumin, great posablites here

This is a great recipe. My Mom always made it when I was a kid and all she could remember about it was that my Dad ate it in the Army. I added onion when browning my ground beef. Adds great flavor. It's good over noodles or rice.

This dish is ment for breakfast and yes, typically served in the military in years past. Serve over toast or buscuits. I like to top mine with a fried egg.

This was decent.  I added lots of pepper and cooked the beef with onion and garlic to give it some more flavor.  I'll probably make it again just because it uses ingredients I almost always have on hand, but it's not one of my favorites.

This is an awesome recipe. Its great on its own or with whatever spices/veggies you have on hand at the time. Its sort of like a homeade hamburger helper, which makes me feel as though it is healthier than the store stuff!

This was so quick and a life saver for dinner.  My gravy loving son at it, while the other only ate the pasta underneath.  I used Whole wheat penne and it turned out great!

I thought this was a bit disappointing after reading the other reviews.  I might make this again, but would add some other spices to it.  I thought it was a bit bland.

This was pretty good, very easy and quick to make.  I also like it because it calls for very few ingredients.  I served it over bowtie pasta.  My husband added cajun seasoning and ate it on toast and liked it as well.  The next day I heated it up for lunch and sprinkled seasoning salt on top and thought it was the perfect spice it needed to kick it up a notch.

As the name alludes, this is a perfect emergency meal.  Very filling, very easy, quite quick, but a bit bland.  Extra spices are nice.

Made this lastnight and it's a great base recipe.  After having read some of the reviews I decided to add a few more spices of my own according to taste; I used beef gravy granules instead of beef bouillon and 2 cups of milk which helped in the thickening process.

Also, added a bit more pepper, salt and worcestershire as well as some cajun spice for a bit of kick =)

Great recipe and I'll definitely make it again!

I was very amazed.  Despite the look of it it is rather tasty.  I only gave it a 4 because I had to add more spices.  I sauted onions and garlic and added to the beef.  I also added more pepper and worchester sauce.  I served it over bisquits..Quite the comfort food.  Thanks. I will be using this again

My husband used to speak of SOS, so I was happy to find the recipe.  I was skeptical at first because it seemed TOO simple.

WOW!  We loved it!  It was delicious in it's simplicity!!  We put it on the traditional toast, and EVERYONE loved it!  I added a touch more of seasoned salt for our tastes, and it was great!  It is a perfect "what should I make with groundbeef?" meal!!  Thank you so much for sharing!

we love this recipe, its great any time and as someone mentioned, it is great when you are low on groceries (or funds).  i add the extra flour to make more of a white sauce, sometimes adding the other things to change it up.

This dish is tasty and filling, and is easy to make and economical.  It is very similar to another recipe I have used time and time again from a 1950's Betty Crocker cookbook, called "saucy hamburger crumble."  I love hamburger gravy, it's one of my old standbys, and you can serve it on whatever you have on hand--noodles, macaroni, rice, potatoes or toast.

Not bad at all. Definitely comfort food. Added onion and garlic powder and a little seasoning salt and ate it on top of macaroni as I had no egg noodles. Kids loved it. Thanks.

Very simple - I gave it 4 stars simply for the ease.  It is nothing fancy - but I know I will make it again on a crazy night when I am in a hurry. 4 stars seems high for what it is..but I know if i give it less - that I will not rememeber to make it again and it is great for those rushed nights. I did add a bug huge dallop of sour cream to give it more flavor.

I was pleasantly surprised.  I was not expecting much from this recipe but I found it quiet tasty.  I used more than a pound of beef and added more beef bouillon and worsteshire (sp?)  I kept the milk the same.  My 1 and 3 year old ate it up and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  We had it over broken up fetticini noodles with cooked frozen veggies on top to make it a complete meal.  Will definately make again.  Quick and easy!

This is a combined rating. I grew up in a military family and we had this every once an awhile. Eating this remined me of those times growing up. I liked it well enough, but my husband (who used to be in the military) didn't much care for it. In defense of this recipe, I think I made it a little too thick. I will be making this again. Thanks!

This is the best when you need to whip up something fast but it's a little bland, my boyfriend adds a little hot sauce to his just to add some spice to it.  It's good served over rice or toast too.

This was a good alternative to buying Hamburger Helper.  Very easy to make.  Served over egg noodles.

This was good.  I added some garlic salt, diced onion and 1 teaspoon of w.sauce.  It was too bland otherwise.  I didn't have beef boullion so sub'd chicken.  We don't eat white flour, so used wheat and worked fine.  The fat from the beef soaked up the flour, so it wasn't nearly possible to simmer that mixture for 5 minutes as the recipe calls for.  Added in nonfat milk and served over wheat egg noodles.  It came out really good with the above additions.

I made this last night for dinner.  My fiance loved it!  I put mine over toast, and he had his over egg noodles.  Either way was very good.  The only thing I did differently was add more bouillon, it was much too bland without it.

You know, there where was just something missing for me.  I actually thought it rather bland.  However, my wife loved it!  Go figure.  I would only give three stars, but considering the wife, finally gave it four.  Will try again.

made this the other night. My husband and I really liked but my daughter said it was ok but would eat it again. It is so easy and it was nice to make something on the stove instead in the oven when the weather is so hot.

I added a bit more seasoning, and twice as much worcestershire sauce to give it more flavor. 
I thought it was pretty good for a quick dinner, and i had all of the ingredients already on hand. If i lived alone, i would probably make it again, but I think my family would order pizza if I tried to make it again with them here. LOL

I used Budding Sandwich Meat (Beef) as this was what my mother always used.  I omitted salt, figured the lunchmeat and boullion would have enough.  Great Recipe.

I read the reviews for this and therefore I decided to add onion and garlic to add flavor.  It needed more than just that, but I can't put my finger on what it needed.  It was really bland.  Sorry, but I won't make this again.

This dish is so simple and easy to make!   I have even made it in the slow cooker using 1 1/2 to 2 lbs browned beef, extra milk, cornstarch, 2 boullion and extra pepper and still could'nt mess this up!

This recipe was a good basic recipe like most have said. However, I gave it 3 stars because the recipe itself has to be added to, with seasonings and vegies. So while my version was good I see some ppl's disappointment with it when they failed to read reviews and just made it as is. I added oinons, red and green peppers and peas and seasoned it with adobo and a little red pepper with the additions it was  a four.

Okay...we Loved this recipes...of course I added to it. I added onion while browning the ground beef. Didn't have any worcestershire sauce so dumped in steak sauce instead. Added some peas and carrots. A little sour cream and there ya' have it!!! Yum. Very good basic recipe.

This was a nice, quick, easy dinner and tasted so good over egg noodles. At first I didn't seem to like it and then the favors came together and it tasted good. The only thing I did, was held back alittle on the milk. Added as I seen to need it. And opps added more worcestershire sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

This is definitely a good choice for those of us who are poor but too snooty for Hamburger Helper.  Plus it is probably cheaper than Hamburger Helper.

I used 1/2 tsp. Worchestershire sauce and added some minced fresh serrano chiles after the flour which added heat to give more flavor without making it taste like chili con carne.  I also had some green onions and parsley on hand, so I chopped those and added them after the milk.  It ended up looking like brown and green ghoulash, but it had better flavor.  

I will make this again because I am a poor student and making food from scratch is better than processed food from a box.  Next time, I will try it with mushrooms and onions.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it is quick and easy to make, and becuase you can mix it up easily for a variety of dishes. I added veggies to mine (peas, carrots, and onions) and also used more worcestershire sauce (about 2 teaspoons), and a few more spices (garlic & onion powder and a small pinch of chili powder). I served it over egg noodles and the family was pleased and full. The very little that was left over heated up fine the next day, and the flavor of the worcestershire sauce was stronger. There are so many things you can do to the basic creamed beef base. Add whatever spices and veggies you have on hand and this is a great meal that's quick, easy, and inexpensive. Thanks Suzanne!

This is now a family staple.  I have never had SOS before and was pretty scared to try it. My husband requested it, and said it tasted just like his dad use to make.  I do add sauteed onion and garlic to mine.  Gives it a little extra flavor. 
I loved it!  I was very nicely suprised

It was chilly last night, so this meal was perfect.  I did, however, add lots of chopped onions and some sliced fresh mushrooms to the beef when I was browing it.  Great flavor--a real comfort food!

This was delicious and so easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I added more Worcestershire sauce and beef bouillon to give it extra flavor. I made buscuits to go with this and was able to have this done while the buscuits baked. Fast, easy, tasty.

I thought the beef was excellent but when adding it to the noodles, it tasted bland. the creamed beef tasted excellent though. I however left out the ingredient "bouillon cube" because I didn't have it and added more worcestershire sauce to make up the difference.. so that could be why.

I should've read previous suggestions about extra ingredients. It was very bland, and my son wouldn't touch it. It definitely needed an extra something. I ate it just because I made it, and it was there. Will not be making again. I got my hopes up thinking it was going to be similar to the Army recipe my mom used to make with creamed chipped beef....not even close!!

I upped the flour to 1/2 cup, and added more spices and W/Sauce cos we like it spicy, but other than that, a really easy and yummy meal.  Really good with buttery egg noodles, or buttered toast.

We thought this was very good. Will cut back on the salt next time. I had to use a  little more flour to get it to the consistency that I wanted it at. My ultra picky child ate this too. So there will definatly be a next time. Husband said, It's not like the Army's there was more beef than there's. I probably used closer to 2 lbs of beef for the three of us and I had no leftovers.

This recipe was really easy to make. My kids and I loved it. I added some of the other stuff that other people had mentioned plus I had put some soy sauce on top after it was done.  You don't have to put the soy sauce in the food.  you can let others put it on if they want to.  Again, I thought this was really good.  :-)

This is a wonderful base recipe.  I added onions and garlic to the hamburger.  I tried as other reviewers had to double the worcestershire, but next time I will not do that.  I added some paprika to the flour and served over biscuits.  The whole family loved it!

This was good, I added garlic powder with the meat, which gave more flavor.  Kinda like biscuits and gravy with hamburger instead of sausage, but since our family likes that, no problem here! I served over garlic cheddar biscuits - very yummy!

Yum! Just like my Dad used to make! We also make vegetarian version sometimes with crumbled boca burgers and vegetable broth. If we're feeling fancy, we add onions and garlic.

This is a decent base recipe in which a lot can be done to vary to flavor according to individual taste. While I'm used to more gourmet dishes, my husband grew up on this sort of food -- so I tried it tonight and he almost ate the entire thing! He definitely approved, which means I will probably make this again. However I WAS wary of it being too bland, so I added more Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, chopped onions, garlic powder, and a pinch of paprika and dried basil. This is a great weekday dish when you're tired and need something quick, cheap, and filling to prepare.

quick/easy. comes out similar to frozen creamy beef dinners. 
changes i made: sauteed onions, added beef to brown with a dash of paprika and salt. added the following spices to flour: granulated garlic, dehydrated onion. added a little bit of cream of mushroom soup to the milk. (if using a lot of creamed soup- decrease the flour or it'll come out too thick)

I've saved this recipe for a day when I'm lacking food in the fridge and pantry since I know I always have these ingredients. I took advice from other reviewers. Added chopped onion and substituted the salt for paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and parsley and instead of milk I used cream of Chicken with a little bit of milk. It wasn't too bad but it wasn't the greatest. Maybe needs some tinkering. Goes great with french bread though.

This is a great recipe, I substituted soy crumble for the beef, and turned it into a vegetarian recipe. I also sauteed onions and garlic, and then added the soy.   It was quite good.

Not bad at all! Next time I'll add a bit on diced onion.  It is great on toast... and maybe even in the morning over biscuits.

I can just imagine how bland this recipe would be if I had followed it exactly.  I ended up adding spices, garlic powder, alot more worchestshire sauce, onions, etc......-and it still came out bland.  I served it over egg noodles.  Good comfort food.

I followed the suggestions for extra garlic, onion, and Worchestershire.  It turned out great and was served over horseradish mashed potatoes with a side of cooked cabbage.  I've made it twice.

Man, was this easy! And very good - warm, filling comfort food at its best. I added onion powder and doubled the Worcestershire sauce, which helped combat any blandness. The end result looked like sausage gravy to me, so I served it over biscuits.

Yes, bland.  Will be adding minced onion and garlic powder next time.  Good potential though and very quick and easy.  Added garlic powder, mushrooms, and peas.

Very tasty!!  Just made this for supper, my family loved it.  Served it over rice for my husband and 2 year old.  I had it served on w/w bread.  I added some garlic and onion salt to it, and a can of peas towards the end.  Had to force myself to stop eating it!!

I gave this a 3 - my family loved it but I thought it was awful!  There was some flavor that really bothered me but I can't pinpoint what it was.  My husband commented that if you added celery it would probably be very good, and I agree, if you like the basic recipe.

I will be the first to admit that as a man, I'm not the best cook.  This was easy to make though.  When my wife and I finished, I realized that I had just made gravy with ground beef over rice.  Some might find this appealing, but we just thought it wasn't the best.

This was just okay.  I had sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms and added to my meat mixture but still found it kind of bland tasting. I also added more Worcestershire sauce than it called for.

I definitely added some other spices, like oregano, grill mates for beef and seasoned salt. I also added extra worcestershire sauce and a few spoonsful of sour cream and a dash of white wine.  Very tasty..... and quick.

This is a great base, but I thought it needed more ingredients or seasoning...very bland.  I served it over hot buttered egg noodles. If I make it again I would add onion, gr. pepper, or sour cream.  I gave it 3 stars b/c it has potential and my husband LOVED it!

I did not care for this dish.  I followed the recipe very closely, except for adding some herbs and onion powder to compensate for the blandness some others had mentioned.  That didn't seem to help, as it was still fairly tasteless and had very poor texture.  The only reason it gets 2 stars from me is that my teenage son liked it enough to have seconds (I hope he enjoyed it, because I sure won't be making it again!).

This was great. I had a very small amount of ground beef left over and didnt know what to do with it, so rather than make a burger i tried this recipe.  (i just eyeballed the amount of ingredients to accomadate the small portion of beef i was using) it was quick,easy,and filling. i loved it over the toast but will use egg noodles when i make it for my family. thanks!

my dad (retired navy officer) hated this stuff when he was active duty, but i saw this recipe and thought it would be neat to try.  i think it's great!  i served it over rice and my son ate a whole serving, and he hates meat!  i did use ground turkey and didnt have any worchestershire sauce, but it's still very tasty, cheap and FAST!  good alterative to stroganoff.

This is a great comfort food dish. We ate it over noodles.  I added about twice the amount of pepper to give it a little "bite."  It makes really great leftovers too.

Quick and easy, my family raved.  Served over potatoes, it was delicious.  I added onions and mushrooms, and they accompanied the meal perfectly.  Thanks so much, will use this often.

Seemed like we were eating pure mush. There was no visual appeal to this recipe. Taste was dull and texture was too runny. Will not make this recipe again.

This was a big hit with our 4 kids who loved it, for myself and my hubby will spice it up next time with more seasoning and the suggested mushroom soup. Served it over whole wheat bisquits and there were no leftovers! It's a keeper especially for busy nights.

I enjoyed chipped beef on toast as a child when my Mother would make it for our family.  I was hoping to capture that same taste with this recipe.  To my disapointment this recipe was not enjoyable.  The taste of Worcetshire sauce was to overpowering. No one in my famiy liked.

I've made this several times.  I do agree it needs more seasoning.  I've sauted onions with the ground beef. It's great served over potatoes, noodles and rice.  Not a fancy dinner but quick and easy.

My husband is a very picky eater, so I thought I'd try this and he loved it.  I served it over a bed of rice and he gobbled it up.  I didn't make enough for him.  Next time I will try serving it over egg noodles.  Thanks.

A litte too bland, added extra spices and more worcesterhire sauce.  It reminded me of a glorifed "Hambuger Helper".  Might make again, if I am in a pinch to make something.

This recipe is perfect when time is short and a quick hot meal is required.  I microwave a potatoe and cut it up and pour the mixture over the potatoe.  It is outstanding this way.  Try it.

I just made this and it is good. I like the fact that just about anything could be added to it for variety. Onions, peppers, rice, macaroni, noodles, the list goes on and on. Also served over toast, or potatoes or substitute the ground round for sausage, mild or spicy. This is just a really good recipe. Thanks!

My husband (ex-Army guy) was not thrilled by the prospect of eating it but thought it wasn't bad. Much better than the Army's. The kids ate it pretty well.  Very easy and will do on those nights no one wants to cook.

My husband has asked a million times for me to make SOS like he had in the service.  I never realized that it was so easy!  My husband said this recipe was better than he remembered.

The only problem I had with the recipe was not making enough!  My little picky kids licked their plates!!   This recipe reminds me of the dish my grandmother used to make.  She never wrote the recipe down and it was lost when she died.  I'm glad to now have it in my recipe box for my family to enjoy and pass on to my kids!

I poured this over toast and my husband (who is a picky eater) enjoyed it and took the leftovers for lunch the next day. Not too bad.

This recipe was quick and easy but lacking in flavor.  I had to add tons of spices and vegtables just to make it edible.

Tastes just like my mom used to make but without the crisco! I didn't feel so guilty eating it since it has less fat.

This is just as I remember it from the Army. It was easy, delicious and the whole family loved it. I didn't change anything except double the recipe and I thought it was great.

A little salty the first time I made it but I think that was a mistake on my part.  Makes a good sidedish with boiled rice.

My husband LOVES this and I love it because it is quick and easy!  I do add a little "extra" seasoning and serve it over toasted BBQ bread with a side salad.  It is good comfort food!

My husband really liked this one.  It is something that I won't make often because you can easily get tired of it.  It reminded me a lot of a hamburger helper meal and the hamburger didn't really taste like anything more than burger. I also didn't realize that this was just a meat dish but we ate ours over rice and cornbread.  It was much better that way. I will probably try it again in a couple of months.

I served it over noodles. My husband said it tasted bland. It was edible for him. He finished his plate. I ate a few bites and decided I had enough. My 2 year old daughter would not try it. I gave her plain noodles and she was happy. I won't be making it again.
