I was very excited about trying these Nutella popsicles, but, after mixing everything together, you really couldn't taste the Nutella.  I ended up adding quite a bit more until it had the chocolate hazelnut flavor I love.   I thought the popsicles were going to be creamy, but, they were actually pretty icy.  Due to the high fat content from the whipping cream and nutella, I was hoping to make these as a special treat for us, but, unfortunately the flavor didn't come through.

Made this yesterday. I believe I added 3-4 scoops of Nutella though. The Popsicle stick route didn't work so I decided to go with the ice tray. Works for me. They came out great either way. I wonder if I can use 1% Milk...

I used 6 'heaped' tablespoons of nutella. 300ml extra thick cream and judged milk, prob 150-200ml. Bloody lovely. Made 6 large lollies. Just like shop bought icecream. Would recommend making smaller ones because very rich and fattening but are fab for treat.
