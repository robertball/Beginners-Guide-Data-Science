hi I am indonesian--and pisang goreng is just the best. if you try to bake the bananas in the oven on a baking sheet (425 F) until they're crispy, and use egg substitutes and reduced-calorie margarine (instead of butter), you'll cut down on a lot of fat.

I'm an Indo girl too, and I LOVE pisang goreng!! DO NOT use banana's that are too ripe, they'll be soggy after you fry them. Adding the rum was something new to me...but it's delicious!!

I've made this a few times and it has come out perfectly every time. Try dusting the bananas with powdered sugar for a nice presentation or drizzling with chocolate sauce. I add regular vanilla instead of powdered vanilla and often exclude the butter. If you want it to have a stronger rum taste add a little at the end. So easy and delicious!

This is really good.  Reminds me of home.  You can also use cooking bananas (plaintain).  Let them ripe first for 1 or 2 more weeks, until their skins turned black.  By then, the taste will be sweet and the meat will be firm, not mushy like the regular banana.  Yumm....

I made these just to try something different. They were pretty good, although we could barely taste the rum flavoring. Also, if I were to make them again, I would use bananas that weren't quite so ripe - the fritters were a little too mushy for my liking. Thanks, Unieng!

These are one of my favourite desserts and I have been looking for a recipe like this. Because bananas are fairly expensive where I am right now I made a half batch, then having enjoyed them so much, made another one. I pan fried them instead of deep frying and didn't add any rum cause I don't have any. To substitute I spiced them with nutmeg and cinnamon instead which is beautiful as a dessert, especially with vanilla ice-cream or maple syrup. For the second batch I added a little coarse ground pepper to the mix, which I know sounds strange but it tastes great and adds the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the dish. Try it!

My Indonesian boyfriend and I love these!  I have made these twice already and they disappeared fast!  We used regular bananas, but will try the cooking bananas next time.

Loved the recipe.  My mother always made them with a beer batter (flour and beer) and it was SO easy.  Try heating equal parts of soy sauce and honey in a small pot parts and add a bit of spicy 'sambal' for a dipping/serving sauce....... yummy!

Living in Jakarta for a good amount of my childhood my family used to make these frequently.  There is something a little 'off' about the recipe can't really put my finger on it and we certainly didn't use rum in ours but still good and reminded me of those days. For those of you whom have never had this, the best way to describe it....it is sorta like funnel cake with banana inside!

These weren't bad but they definitely needed more sugar for my liking. Since a lot of the batter mix is left in the bottom of the bowl, the sugar probably didn't really mix in well. Honey might have solved this issue since it's a liquid. Also, I'd prefer it if they were a little crispier on the outside.

Well..I've tried it but nothing fanciable about this one. Just ordinary. The Pisang Goreng stalls can be found everyday (day and night!) throughout Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia...and I think there are more better recipes out there to be tested.

They were a huge hit. I didn't have any vanilla powder and used cocoa powder instead for a chocolate taste and dipped them in a chocolate sauce and made a cream cheese compote for dipping as well. My two year had a blast!

The fritters tasted good and were all gone in minutes. The dough was tough to work with as bananas would not easily stay folded in the dough. After a while, I came up with a “folding” method using 2 spoons, but apparently, brought in too much dough per slice and ran out of the dough with almost 1 full banana left.

I made it and got an extremely thick batter that I couldn't even stir. I had to add water to get it to an ok consistency. I'm not sure what I did wrong because I did the half cup of milk.

I tried this, and I made few variations to it and it turned out great. Instead of rum flavoring I used cinnaomon and instead of cutting the banana in a slice I cut it in vertically so the result was circular banana bites. I also used semi-ripe banana so I wouldn't have to deal with the "smusshy" taste. All in all it was a great recipe

Very good dessert that's not too sweet. I didn't deep fry mine because I don't care for deep fried food. They are great plain old pan-fried! I even got a few picky friends to munch on them. Try it!
