I used the half mozzarella half cheddar string cheese and this worked pretty good except the cheddar seemed to melt faster than the mozzarella and oozed out some. This didn't get as brown as I would have liked but I suppose that is due to keeping them healthy and baking them in the oven instead of deep frying. Don't skip the freezing step because it definitely needs this. Overall great recipe and a healthier alternative.

Delicious! This was my first time making these and this was the first recipe I used. My boyfriend and I love them and have already made plans to make them for our next party!

Absolutely AWSOME! Made them as an after school snack and they were gone before I could take a picture. I used only half a cheese stix, but you probably could do a whole. Plan on making them again!

Really tasty and easy! To make them crispy, I sprayed them lightly with nonstick cooking spray before popping them in the toaster oven. That way the oil was lighter and more evenly distributed than it would've been with drizzled olive oil. I left mine in for a few minutes longer - about seven minutes total. Lastly, I can't say why, but I think the flour step makes a big difference. The egg and breadcrumbs seem to bond better.

Family loves it I made a small batch and they were gone in seconds. They take a little while to bread but cooking only takes minutes. Can't wait to make it again and make a bigger batch

These were great, though a little labor intensive.  I took off the tin foil and baked them an additional two minutes. My cat made off with two of them. He was desperate for them!
