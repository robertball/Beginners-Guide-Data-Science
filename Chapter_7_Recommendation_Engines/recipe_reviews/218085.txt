Wow, I am always looking for ways to cook pork chops that don't dry them out...I don't know if it was the lemon that tenderized the meat, but this simple recipe was just delicious, I only added a little cracked pepper!!!

This was an awesome dish.  I use pork loin fillets and EVOO instead of vegetable oil.  Did use the garlic and marinated for around 24 hours.  It was by far one of the best recipes I have used lately.

by far, the most tender and tasty chops we have ever had.  I marinated them for about 7 hours, and because the chops were fairly thick and boneless, i ended up grilling them about 6 minutes on each side.  Super flavor, thanks doonze for the best pork chop recipe ever.    this recipe was perfect for 4 adults.  The garlic was optional, i used it and glad I did.

This a very good, simple marinade that takes about a minute to put together. It enhances the flavor of the pork chop without covering it. As a matter of fact, next time we use this recipe I think I'll cut slits in the pork to allow the marinade to penetrate the meat even more, then I'll wrap the chops in foil to cook with a bit of the marinade. Report to follow...

These were very good! I tried two different marinades on 2 different chops, they were both very good. I marinated over 24 hrs also. Moist and delicious! Would make again.

I used the oven method, and I could taste the lemon juice, which was not necessarily bad, but I thought it needed a little something. If I made this again I would add some spices to perk it up, maybe the pepper as another reviewer suggested, and seasoned salt or Mrs Dash. The pork chops were not dry at all, though. I think overnight marinating would be best.

I made this last night for dinner and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again. The only thing I changed was I used canola oil and garlic powder.

Did this for tonight. It sat in the marinade for 6-7 hours and was thrown on the grill. It turned out amazing! The entire family enjoyed it! Next time I will leaving it in the marinade for a full 24 hours and I'm sure it will be that much better.

Baking works out fine for this, but allow 40 - 50 minutes with the pan near the top of the oven.

Tried this last night...four hours marinade.  The family loved it--keep this marinade recipe I was told.  I will certainly do that.  But next time I think I will add MORE garlic.  THANKS!

Easy and very tasty. Used EVOO instead of vegetable oil other than that no changes. Did cook them in our Nu-Wave oven since it was cold out and I didn’t want to fire up the grill.

Pork chops were amazing I marinated them for 24 hours and instead on minced garlic and oil I used tony chachere's famous Creole cuisine injectables roasted garlic and herb and it was amazing. I grilled it for 4 minutes over high heat on each side placing the chops onto aluminum foil to keep the grill from catching fire because of the marinade.

I broiled the pork chops. I thought the lemon juice was a bit overpowering and will cut it in half next time.

We eat pork chops quite often and I was skeptical with what is in this recipe! My wife likes lemon, so I decided to give it a try! I used center cut pork chops... 8 total! My wife and I didn't care for this recipe... the chops didn't taste good at all!!! I marinated them 24 hours in the frig and decided to fry them in a frying pan on top of the stove instead of using a grill or oven. By doing that, it's no different than putting them on a gas grill... unless a person uses charcoal. There was so much liquid (marinade) in the chops I had to pour some out so they would sear and brown up. The marinade liquid would've definitely done the same thing in the oven. First and last time I'll make these!

I put this in the oven last night as last minute meal with all of the ingredients dumped into one pan. Sprinkled a little Adobo and onion powder on top covered the pan with foil and baked for about an hour. Turned out perfect for our tastes. The lemon and worcestershire combination was delicious. Even our two year old loved it. I am definitely adding this to my cooking rotation.

So yummy! I had no time to marinade so I put everything in my instant pot. The marinade permeated the meat nicely. It was so good, we used it as a juice to accent the meat. I will be making this again and again.

We used the oven method, but I was disappointed with the results. The pork chops were dryer than I hoped for. I won't make them again.

I made it on George Forman grill. Not enough flavor. It may be good made on a charcoal grill.

Very tasty and easy. I started late so only marinated for 2 hours, but it was still excellent. My kids loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I hate to give a rating less than 3 stars. Made as written and marinated for 6 hours. I should have paid attention to the recipe description. I have no desire to make "Tangy Chicken" from this site should I ever stumble upon it. Just not for our taste buds. Too much tang--overpowering, needs something else to balance (maybe brown sugar and some herbs, s&p helps everything usually, but wouldn't in this recipe). Not inedible, but not too our liking to make again either.

Delicious Tangy Pork Chops Haiku: "Easy, quick to make. With ingredients on hand. Didn't blow me 'way." Husband adored this, me, not so much. I really prefer its original incarnation, according to the cook's description, AR's "Tangy Pork Chops" - it may have a longer ingredient list, but I like its end result much more. My pork chops were pretty thick, so I grilled them 6 min. per side, and while they were just a touch dry, I had marinated them overnight and found that the flavor just didn't permeate the meat enough.
