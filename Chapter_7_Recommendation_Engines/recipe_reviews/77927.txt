After reading all of the reviews and following some of the other reviewers' tips, we ended up eating a delicious meal using this recipe. I made the burger patties exactly as written, but after forming them I put them in a 425 degree oven for 10 minutes on each side to bake off a good deal of the grease. While they were baking I sauteed two large, sliced onions with a teaspoon of minced garlic in two tablespoons of butter until the onions were soft. To the onions I added the three cans of Cream of Mushroom soup (used fat-free), two soup cans of water, two beef boullion cubes, and enough Kitchen Bouquet (probably about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon)to darken the gravy/sauce mixture; I let this simmer over low heat until all of the meat patties were browned. Then I drained the grease from the browning pan, wiped the pan clean, put the meat patties back into the pan on top of a bit of the gravy/sauce, and poured the rest on top of the meat. Reset the oven to 350, covered the pan with foil, and baked for one hour more. This was delicious; lots of flavor and the patties were very moist. We put the gravy/sauce on top of mashed potatoes, and also had fresh, lightly steamed broccoli on the side. Thank you for this recipe...my husband and son went crazy over this (husband ate three meat patties, son ate two)! I used the entire three pounds of ground beef and ended up with a total of 12 patties. So glad I don't have to cook tomorrow!

I scaled this down to one pound of 'burger and two cans of soup. Instead of making seperate patties, I covered the bottom of the dish with the hamburger, cooked 10 minutes @ 350 degrees, poured off the grease then cut the meat into six seperated sections before pouring the mushroom soup over the top then I put on the canned mushrooms. I made this just like the recipe called for with the exception of getting rid of a LOT of grease before puting the soup on. You can also make this with tater tots inbeded in the soup before putting it in the oven for 45 minutes.  If you want to put the tater tots on, don't put the foil cover on. Very easy, very quick and very tasty.

I will never forget when one of my high school friend's mother made this when I spent the night. Loved it, came home raving about it, and finally got my mother to make it. Still make it to this day. Great comfort food!

Very yummy-- I scaled this down to 1 lb of beef and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I left out the milk and used an egg instead to help hold the patties together. I also seasoned the patties with onion powder and seasoned salt instead of garlic powder and italian seasoning. Following the advice of another reviewer, I first browned the patties at 425 for 10 minutes a side and then poured off the grease (glad I did- it was the cheap stuff, so there was plenty to pour off). While doing that, I sauted half an onion and a clove of garlic, then added the cream of mushroom and about 2/3 can of water and let that simmer until the patties were done browning. After pouring off the grease, I added the gravy mixture to the patties, covered with foil, and baked at 350 for another 25 minutes. It was GREAT. Served with mashed potatoes and black eyed peas-- a good cheap meal!

I found that the meat was a bit mushy the first time I did it ( following the recipe) 
so the next time I only added half the milk and and only half the crackers, I also added some misses dask garlic and herb seasoning.   And to the soup I mixed it with a pack of brown mushroom gravy mix and 1 1/2 cups of water then I pored the gravy mixture over the patties. It came out great and my family ate right up!!!!!!

I did not care for this recipe. Seeing how A/R came and edited my review, I guess you can't be specific as to WHY you did not care for a recipe. I'll say it again. Recipe as written, turned out greasy and unappealing. Better read the reviews that changed this one around before trying, that's all.

This was allright. Nothing special, but decent nonetheless. Both my hubs & I agree that Anne Marie Sweden's hamburger steaks w/ onions & gravy is FAR superior to this recipe (these "steaks" were too bland for our liking). Yes, the two are different, but only slightly so - the gravy here is mushroom based & Anne Marie's gravy is just a basic (but SUPER flavorful) brown gravy. As many others have done, I too made several changes. W/o them, I'm afraid I would have liked this even less. Keep in mind that I only made 1/3 of this recipe (4 steaks) since I was feeding 2 people. I set my oven to 425 degrees, baked my steaks for 10 min. per side, reduced the oven temp. to 350, drained all grease & then proceeded as directed. My other changes were to saute a sm. (sliced) yellow onion & a t of minced garlic in 1 T butter until softened / fragrant, top my steaks w/ the mixture, add a .75 oz. packet of McCormick brand brown gravy mix & 1.5 c. H2O to my can of condensed cream of mushroom soup & pour over all. After I took everything out of the oven, I noticed my gravy hadn't thickened (I worried about adding so much H2O, but it was too late to do anything about it). To fix the issue, I mixed 1 T cornstarch w/ 1 T cold H2O, poured my gravy into a sm. saucepan, added the cornstarch slurry & brought to a slight boil to thicken. Perfect! Served w/ garlic mashed potatoes & corn, this was an "OK" meal, but not one I'd repeat again. Thanks anyways, RHONDA! :-)

I thought this was really good!  My changes were, omitting the milk (I forgot it, and I'm not sure how it helps the dish anyway) and to the mushroom soup I added worchestershire, a teaspoon of onion powder, beef bouillion and a few pepper flakes.  It was very flavorful and I think I liked it better than some of the salisbury steak recipes from this site.  Thanks!

Crackers instead of bread crumbs?  That is genius!! I don't know why I didn't think of it before.  My family really enjoyed this and my picky 11 yr old son even asked for more!  I added one egg to the meat mixture and after I formed the patties, I dusted each with flour.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, mixed it with evaporated milk and poured over each patty.
They were delicious!  Served it with a salad, mashed potatoes and ranch style beans.

This was exceptionally good. My husband will eat anything I make but doesn't usually say anything either good or bad -- he just eats. Tonight I made this and he said it was perfection... ^_^ Very high praise. The only changes I made were to scale it to use a pound of hamburger & to add half a sliced onion to the top of the patties before the soup. The sauce/gravy was phenominal over rice. I'll definately be adding this to my recipe box... Thanks!

This poor man's hamburger steak is wonderful!! great flavor all the way. I did listen to other reviews and follow what they said, i also changed it up a bit to suite our taste. I followed it completely except, i only made a third of the recipe. I cooked it on 425 for 10 minutes on each side before reducing heat to take off grease. I also mixed in half a can of soup instead of using it as a gravy on top. This made it so delicous. Instead of the mushroom gravy on top, i used a pack of brown gravy mix but added some of the cream of mushroom soup and added a can of fresh mushrooms to it as well. yum.. thanks for the dish!!

I used crushed Ritz crackers in place of the saltines because that was what I had on hand, used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk, used two cans of cream of mushroom soup (I wanted a thicker gravy) and I used fresh baby bella mushrooms. I cooked the mushroom "steaks" in the skillet, moved the steaks to a baking pan, then left the drippings in the skillet and sauteed the mushrooms with chopped onions with a little butter before adding the soup and milk. I just made sure to scrape the meat drippings off the bottom of the pan to capture all that good flavor. I did add a little worchestershire sauce to the "gravy". This was a quick and comforting dinner that was quite budget friendly (nevermind it used up a little of this and a little of that from my pantry before our big move) and fed all four of us very well, with a side of mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli. NO leftovers. My littlest especially loved this which was especially nice because.....that kid dosen't seem to eat much lately.

THis is a great recipe.. Here is how I do mine (more like the Amish here in Pa.).. after mixing the ingredients I then press into a cookie sheet  to  about 3/4" .( I omit the Itialian seasoning) Chill in  refridgerator for about 4 hours  Then cut into squares, dredge in flour then "brown" (not cook through) both sides in a small amount of oil. Remove, Then put into your baking dish,Top w/ mushroom soup Diluted w/1/4  Can of milk or water. Bake 1 hour 325 Degrees

This was SUPER good! I wasn't planning on changing the recipe, but when I went to my pantry to get my cream of mushroom, I noticed that I only had 2 cans of that and 1 can of golden mushroom, so I just mixed them all together. I did brown the hamburgers first as suggested by some other reviews. I then chopped some onion and sauteed that in some olive oil until tender and then mixed in the 3 cans of soup to combine. I then poured this mixture evenly over the top and covered and baked (they came out very moist). This is definately comfort food, and I will be making it again! Thanks for posting. :)

I didn't bake this, I made it in my electric skillet. Used Ritz Crackers because that's what I had on hand. No canned soup aloud in my house so I used an AR recipe for Home made Cream style Soup Mix. You should check it out!! My husband said tonight's dinner was restaurant quality.

This was yummy! I added an egg to the ground beef mixture to help hold it together, and browned both sides a little bit in the frying pan to get rid of some of the grease...cut up an onion and added it to the mixture before putting it in the oven...it ended up having to cook for about an hour and a half before the onion cooked all the way. Turned out great, the "gravy" was delicious when served over rice, served corn and green beans on the side. Thanks!

Very good. Nice simple dinner. I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup and topped them with cracked black pepper and sautees onions instead of mushrooms. Served it with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. I will certainly make this again.

Was quite pleased with this. Quick and easy. Agree with others that it was quite greasy at end of baking time. I made the "steak" mixture as written (just made a 1/3 recipe, as I had a pound of ground beef thawed in the fridge.) Probably went a little heavy on the spices, only "halved" the quantity there. Served with potatoes and carrots.  Nice comforting meal on a cold November night.  Thanks.

Great start for a meal to suit us all.  Took lots of ideas from comments from others.  Scaled the recipe for 4 - I had only 1-1/2 pounds of HB. Added a packed of AuJus gravy mix, subbed 3 cloves minced garlic for garlic powder. Sweated one yellow, sweet onion with minced garlic. Then added 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 soup can water, l soup can water, 1 t Worchester Sauce.  Lots of black pepper as we like that. Served with elbow mac and steamed green beans.  
THE ENTIRE family loved every bite and wanted more!!!  SO Easy, SO quick, and so satisfying.  Thanks, Rhonda35 for a great recipe

this is very good but i suggest you use a high grade of meat so there isn't a lot of grease in the soup.  And you don't cook the meat first you follow directions exactly as they are written.

I followed the recipe and would have to agree with the other advice given, drain off the fat. Cook the meat first at 425 for 10 minutes, then drain fat and add sauce.  Cook at 350 for 30 minutes.  There wasn't enough sauce for the mash potatoes I served with it, so next time I will add a can of evaporated milk.  I also didn't have any saltine crackers so I used a garlic & herb crackers I had. Turned out good.

I made this with ground sirloin and left out the mushrooms since my husband and I aren't huge mushroom fans and it tasted great!

Easy and delicious.  I used hamb. patties and covered with soup mixture.  This was even a hit with the kids, who can be picky.

They call this poor man's for a reason. I rated this 5 stars because I had to substitute the crackers for italian bread crumbs and only had 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in my pantry...I had not been MAJOR grocery shopping since before Christmas and this came out delis with what if anything I had. I followed the recipe to a "T",besides the bread crumbs and soup mix mix-up..lol,I also added a little onion powder to the mix. From one down home working woman to ... anybody, this is an easy great comfort food for everybody, especially this Southern Minnesota Family!8)

Cheap and easy, a great weeknight meal!  I only used 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 cup cracker crumbs and 1/4 tsp. of spices.  This was a touch bland so next time I will add Worcestershire and minced onion to the patties.  Overall though, we were quite happy with this.  Thanks!

I decided to make this for dinner tonight because I actually had all the ingredients on hand! Well not the saltines, but I just used breadcrumbs instead. It was pretty good and very easy to prepare. Kind of a cheaper variation of salisbury steak, which I think I would prefer if I had more time. But this was good enough for me and the family to make again on a budget.

UPDATE: I tried this recipe again but fried it in the pan like another reviewer suggested. Much tastier and faster too!

Looking for something different and easy? This is it. Some people said it was a bit greasy, maybe you should try a leaner meat. My beef is home grown and lean.

Pretty good, although I don't like mushrooms so I used a can of cream of onion soup instead. I scaled down the recipe to 2 servings which made 4 patties. I cooked on the stove top browning the patties with sliced onion and minced garlic for added flavor. Once patties were browned on both sides I drained fat, added soup, a bit of beef broth, and beef bouillon.

Great recipe! I didn't add the mushrooms, but it tastes good anyways.. Crackers surprisingly worked very well, I'm used to using bread crumbs, and was afraid that it wouldn't work very well but it worked perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this dish!  For the most part I followed the recipe, but like some other users I dredged the patties in a flour/saltine mix and then browned in a skillet before baking.  Served the mushroom gravy on the side rather than baked with the patties, and garnished with fresh chives from the garden.  I'll definitely be making this again!!!

Delicious comfort food! I seared my burgers on the stovetop just for color and to get rid of a litttle of the grease. Then I finished in the oven. Added a little minced onion to the burger mixture as well. Also mixed gravy mix and a little milk in with the cream of mushroom. It was outstanding and very easy! Will be making this one again!!

Great patties!  I fried them in a pan on the stove and then removed them.  I sauteed onions and fresh mushrooms, added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk, dash of worcestershire.  Whisked until blended.  Added the patties to the mixture and simmered for about 20 minutes!  They were great!!  Tasted like a "grandma" meal!

I love these.  Only one thing I did differently was to brown these in a pan beforehand...cuts out a lot of grease from the gravy and makes them even more tender.

this was good, but it took longer for mine to  cook. probably because i made very large patties. i followed the recipe to a "T" except i used fresh mushrooms on topinstead of canned. mostly because that is all i had but also thought fresh mushrooms are best.

I cut the recipe in 1/3 and made five hamburger steaks.  I didn't like just the cream of mushroom soup on top.  Next time, I may just use regular mushroom gravy and cook the hamburger steaks on the stove top.  My husband would give it four stars.  It's a very easy recipe.

This is very tasty.  I took the suggestion of lexiandjack and made a gravy.  I added beefer upper instead of kitchen bouquet.  I find beefer upper has a nice beefy taste.  I added a little worcesterer sauce and my husband loved it!

These were good.  I did add more seasonings as others suggested.  Also, I put some french onions on the top after backing.  I ended up with quite a bit of sauce.  I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with six large hamburgers.

This was really good!  I made exactly as written but added a few drops of worchester sauce.  Only reason I rated as a 4 and not 5 was because they were a little on the greasy side after cooking.  But...nothing a paper towel couldn't help!!  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

I made this recipe because my husband, who lived in Hawaii for a long time, loves traditional Hamburger Steaks, and I was trying to recreate his restaurant experience at home.  I followed the recipe except instead of using soup to form a white gravy (unheard of for Hawaiian hamburger steak), I used a brown gravy.  The next time I make this, I will make the patties very thin, and decrease the cooking time so they don't become overdone.  Serving with rice is perfect!

I will definitely make this again! Delicious!  I made a few changes:  First of all, I adjusted and cut the recipe down to 2# of beef and it made six nice sized patties.  I added one egg to the beef mixture (it happened to be a huge double yoke).  After I formed my patties, I dredged them in flour and browned them in my sacred iron skillet.  Instead of mushrooms, I covered with grilled onions before adding the gravy. 
For my gravy I mixed 1 (18 oz) jar of Heinz homestyle savory beef gravy with 1.5 cans of cream of mushroom soup. (It made a nice batch -- enough for mashed potatoes).

Served with mashed potatoes, english peas, corn and Texas toast.  (I added a photo).   Yum.

This recipe was good, not great. The meat needed something more. I'm not quite sure what, but needed a little more taste. That being said this recipe is extremely easy and perfect for large dinners.

I wish I had read the reviews first because mine was swimming in grease (although unhealthy, mighty tasty). I think in the future I will cook the patties for a bit and then pour off the grease then put cream of mushroom and mushrooms on and cook it the rest of the way. However, I gave it five stars because myself and my kids gobbled every bite on our plates until we were full as ticks. My two year old kept asking for more and you know how picky a two year old can be.

These were delicious!  I used a combo of ground beef and turkey and seasoned with Nature's Season Salt.  I added a few extra crackers and baked the patties without the soup topping for 10-15 mins which helped get out some of the grease.  Drained and then topped with sauteed onions and garlic and soup.  Baked 45 mins, flipped and then baked 15 mins more.  YUM YUM!

We love these!  An easy and inexpensive meal that is good with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.  I did add some garlic, and Worcestershire sauce and used fresh mushrooms.  I also used panco because I did not have an crackers.  Yummy!

This is very good I also kind of do this with pork chops and it's a hit with my family have it quite often...but what I do is brown the meat In a large skillet with the seasonings and then make a homemade gravy in the skillet by using flour with the drippings to brown then add in soup n also a brown or mushroom gravy packet then put it all in a dish and let it bake in the oven till super tender and the gravy browns more and it's delish!

Husband, tween, toddler and mom approved!  I don't usually rate recipes that I didn't make exactly according to the recipe, but I think this recipe would be excellent no matter how you make the patties!  I just used some Lipton Onion soup mix I had on hand (I've made a jar of it homemade) instead of the written ingredients because I didn't have them.  I did bake the patties before adding the soup to remove some grease, though I used ground round and there wasn't much. It could have been mixed in with the soup.  Since I only was cooking for 2 adults and 2 kids I cut the recipe way back and only used one can of soup.  Two would have been better.  To compensate for less gravy, I took the patties out and added a little milk to the remaining soup to thin it out and extend the gravy.  Not that often that my entire family ohhhh's and ahhhhh's over dinner.  This simple recipe was a hit and will be in our regular rotation now!  Thanks RHONDA35!

I scaled it down a bit. I used 2 lbs. of 90/10 ground beef, 17 saltines, 1/3 cup of milk, 1 XL egg, 2 cans of soup, 1 teaspoon of Montreal seasoning in the meat and another in the soup. I omitted the salt and pepper due to the saltines, soup, and Montreal seasoning containing large amount of salt. The garlic powder & Italian seasoning stayed the same amount. I left out the mushrooms. I seared the patties both sides first and put them side. I didn't have any fat in the pan so I took the soup and seasoning and heated to a boil, scraping up the hamburger bits. Poured the soup on the patties then covered dish with foil and baked in a preheated oven at 425 for about 20-25 minutes. This was really delicious. My family raved about it. Next time, I'm going to use low sodium soup and crackers since it was still a bit salty.

I grew up with a recipe similar to this.  My Mom just crumbled and cooked the hamberger, then mixed it into the soup mixture.  We called it Hamburger Gravy over Mashed Potatoes.  You can use as little or as much hamburger as you want.  Simple, cheap and filling.

Simple and good.  Good low-carb if you use one egg in place of milk. ( also did not serve with noodles or rice.)  Used French onion soup mix for burger seasoning.   Followed advice from others and browned burger in 425 degree oven for 10 minuted per side to start.  Sautéed onion and garlic in butter to start,, then added gravy sauce ingredients.  Need to cook dish at 350 for only 30 minutes.  Author prefers burger to be well done.  Not necessary.   Will make again as a easy comfort food dinner.  Thanks!

This is a 5-star recipe AS LONG AS YOU PRE-COOK the hamburgers, then DRAIN AND WIPE the pan clean of grease .... THEN oven bake them.  The taste & flavor of these ingredients is awesome!

After reading many many helpful feedback entries I too cooked the patties for 10mins each side in a 425 oven, drained off the grease and then returned to dish. I sautéed onion, garlic and added a knorr beef stock cup to pan. After the stock melted I added the cans of cream of mushroom and allowed to simmer until the meat was done on the 20 mins of first step. After draining and wiping out dish I spooned gravy mixture on bottom replaced patties and covered with rest of gravy. Covered with foil and cooked for an hour more at 350. I also was heavy handed with the garlic powder and added onion powder. Simple and scrumptious!

This is the first time to write a review for anything.  My husband loves hamburger and I always look for new dishes.  We both thought it was the best hamburger steak we had ever had and the next visit from our family, I will make this for them.  Great, Great, Great!!!  Thanks for sharing.      Jenny in Alabama

I used what I had on hand, 1 can cream of mushroom and 2 cans beefy mushroom soup, 24 wheat crackers and left over fresh mushrooms and onions from steaks we grilled yesterday.  I browned the patties first, but I do not feel it was necessary to add to the flavor, but it did get rid of some of the grease and there was still a great deal of grease after baking for 50 min....I used 80/20 beef and an oil separator along with white paper towels to remove the excess grease.  The flavor was awesome and I will make it again. It is in the "Clean Plate Club" per hubby's empty dish...I think if I put the patties in the baking dish and cook for about 30 min..without the soups and then drain and add the other ingredients that may help with the grease problem..Also may use a can of tomatoes drained or stewed and see how that is...I will cut the milk to a half cup to firm the patties up some...

I followed the recipe "almost" to the letter.  I did add a bit of steak sauce and worstershire.  It came out great!  My husband LOVED it and said it was the best he had ever eaten.  Needless to say he took a plate to work the next day and he normally doesn't do leftovers!  I served it with creamed potatoes, cabbage, brocolli casserole and rolls.  YUMMY!

I liked this recipe. I didn't measure the ingredients but it came out great. Also, I didn't have time to bake it so I fried the patties on the stove to speed up cooking time. Turned out great!

My family really likes this recipe. I tweeked it a little bit. I substitute 1 egg for the milk. I only used 2/3 the crackers and add some Mrs Dash original seasoning. Most of my family do not like mushrooms so I used just basic jar brown gravy and topped it with yellow onions. I cooked it covered at 350 and then uncovered it for the last 10 minutes and turned up the heat to 425. It really browns the top good.

So simple and my family loved this comfort food. The soup made it's own gravy and there was plenty of it. I served this with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side. As my husband said you just can't go wrong with meat and potatoes. I like a lot more spicy savory food, and am not a fan of mushroom anything so I personally thought they were rather bland. Thanks Rhonda this was great for such an easy dish.

This recipe was a hit in my kitchen last night. I served it over toast and my husband had seconds and eagerly took leftovers to work for lunch the next day. Warm delicious comfort food. Like many others have suggested, I would cook off some of the grease before adding the mushroom soup.

These were great.  My husband especially liked these.  I scaled the recipe back to 1 lb of beef.  I used 1/4 tsp. of all the seasonings after reading some of the reviews that said these were bland.  I also mixed in some worchestershire sauce and minced onion with the soup.

This meal wasn't for me.  It was an interesting way to prepare ground beef, but I didn't think it had very much flavor.  But keep in mind, I prefer chicken over beef, so I'm not the best judge.

We made a few alterations to this recipe.  First, we scaled it to 1lb of ground beef and we added fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) and about 2 small onions.  Instead of baking this dish, we followed the suggestion of a few other reveiwers and just made it on the stovetop.  We found that we had to add about 1/3-1/2 can of water to the soup as it was quite thick (mushrooms and onions probably had something to do with that!)  In the end, it wasn't bad...but both DH and I felt it lacked something.  I think we will try to make this dish again, but I will add some worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture and maybe some garlic.  In my opinion, this recipe is a good starting point, but it needs a bit of 'tweaking'.

What's not to love?  Quick and easy to make, very tasty.   My grandson said it was the "bestest" meat he'd ever had.  Thanks for a great family recipe that I will make again and again.

I love this recipe!  Its definately very quick and easy to make.  I've made it twice now; once I made it with sauteed onions on top of the patties, added the soup, then put fresh sliced mushrooms on top of that. Yummy!

very good and easy to make. the meat is super tender, might tweak it next time so the mushroom flavor isn't so strong and the gravy isn't as thick.

I did saute some onions and garlic and then added Cream of Mushroom soup to that.  Without that addition, I feel it owuld have been a bit bland.  Everything else in the recipe was PERFECT!

I cut the recipe in half ..as per other comments Baked at 400*  10 minutes each side of patties then drain off grease..
and to the 1 can of mushroom soup I added ..2 beef bullion cubes and 1 TB Worcestershire Sauce ..Poured gravy over meat and lowered temp to 350* and baked 30 minutes .. 
YUMMY !!!

I followed the recipe but instead of using milk I used 2 eggs and I also added onion powder. I cooked it in the oven for 20 mins then I added cream of mushroom soup on top. We are not mushroom eaters so I didn't add mushrooms but all in all.....it was awesome!

Made these a couple of nights ago. It's comfort food straight out of the Midwest. Rather than using mushroom soup, I used the meat drippings to make gravy. There really wasn't much fat left from the lean meat, and people liked it.  The recipe is reminiscent of something my German mother used to make, although, it seems to me she incorporated mustard into the recipe.

This is a good recipe! Like others said, I put the patties in the oven at 450 for 10 mins a side and drained the fat. Meanwhile I sautéed onions and garlic, the put the soup in and added a little gravy I made. Put it over the top of the patties and cooked for an additional 25 mins. So good. I did forget to cover but they still came out great!

Did not care for this recipe. Browned hamburgers in pan as others recommended to drain off excess grease. However, dish still remained greasy and mushroom soup did not mix well with the grease.

didnt have the ranch seasoning so i used onion dip mix i had on hand. tasted great. i did take some of the advice of other reviewers and browned the patties first and drained of grease first. very delish, we ate with rice yum. you have to kind of stir the soup and patties at the end to make the gravy. very good recipe.

Not bad at all. We used ground turkey instead (cheaper), reduced fat ritz crackers (what we had in cupboard) and followed rest of recipe as it states. To speed up the cooking I put the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. Yes, the gravy mixture seemed to come out greasy, but, it's called the "Poor Man's Hamburger steak" and not the "healthy man's steak" (would be costly and more work involved). Anyways, my husband and children loved it. Super quick and easy, no mess in kitchen, and you can portion the hamburgers for a "healthier" portion size. I'd make it again.

Super easy and you can make substitutions. We have a large family with kids of all ages and they were ALL wanting more (age 3 to 15). Weird how such an inexpensive dish can pack so much flavor. Def a do-again dinner!

I made this with fresh mushrooms rather than canned and added onions. I used the golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom.This was a good dish. I served it with baked
 potatoes and steamed veggies.

Yummy! I prepared this recipe after having had loads of company the day before and needing something 'comforting'. Ahhh...it was marvelous. I made it exactly as written except only used 1 lb extra lean ground beef and 1 can mushroom soup. Oh, and added half a finely chopped onion. My 3 boys and husband gobbled the entire pan up in minutes and hubby commented that it reminded him of his mother's good meals. I'll make this again for sure.

very good. made onthe stove top and added mushrooms and oinions and browned first. I think maybe next time i would bit a bit of brown gravy mix in just to made some flavor. very quick and easy though!

Made this exactly as directed, I loved it, hubby said I don't hate it but I don't love it, sonny said really good without the gravy. Alas, this will become a starting point recipe. I thought it was a great "different" way to prepare ground beef. Next we will try salisbury steak submitted by Kelly Berenger since I found it had a similar taste to salisbury steak.

Awesome Recipe!!  I've made this twice and didn't change a thing.  The main idea is to keep it "cheap" with flavor... too much "tweaking" and it's no longer a "Poor Man's Steak".. Will make this again! Thanks!!

This dish was pretty good. I did add sliced onions to the top of the patties before I added the soup. I also used  lean beef to cut down on the grease factor.  I served boiled new potatoes and fresh baby carrots. Tasty easy meal to make for people with little time to spend in the kitchen.

I made this for dinner last night and it was great!! I cut the recipe in half, put the patties on top of some onions, and only used one can of soup (only because that was all I had). I will definitely be making this again!!

This is the best.  My whole family loved it so much, they want me to continously make it weekly.  My children loved it so much, and they're picky eaters.  This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

What an easy and great-tasting dinner! I made this with my 3 year old and it was very simple. It made the entire house smell super! We used the mushroom soup that the burgers simmered as a gravy over our mashed potatoes! It was out-of-sight! She had 3 helpings! This is a keeper!

I thought this was a great, quick meal. I made it last night and my husband loved it. I added a little cheddar cheese to the top. I thought I had enough for left overs, but he ate it all!
