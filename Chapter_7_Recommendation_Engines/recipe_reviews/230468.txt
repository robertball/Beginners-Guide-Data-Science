I make a recipe similar to this, only instead of shortening I use melted butter. I like to soak the raisins in hot apple juice or unsweetened chai to plump them a bit before I use them in this recipe. We love these muffins.

Yeah, yeah, I used my blend of apple pie spices, which doesn't include ginger, so I'll take any blame for the subtle flavor - although I don't know that I'd want more.  These might be good with chopped apples in them.  They aren't bad, just a little on the heavy side, moist.  On the other hand, when asked, E, 15, said he wouldn't mind seeing them again - if I felt like making 'em.  :?  :)

I added 2 eggs and a quarter cup of milk because it was too dense. I left out the clove (personal preference)The addition of the egg and milk thinned it nicely and made a delicious muffin. I also added an oat crumble topping before baking. Yum!

I made these with no changes, and they were very good, moist and the right texture for muffins, BUT they should be named "Applesauce SPICE Muffins"--they taste like spice cake, so much so that I couldn't taste the applesauce. (I know, I should have known this from reading the recipe, just wanted to give others a heads up).

After reading the reviews and seeing the consistency of the batter, I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut milk and a 1/2 cup of maple syrup.  I also used my own gluten free flour blend.  I am always in search of gluten free, egg free, dairy free, corn free, yeast free, and others recipes due to many food allergies and this was good for those with and without allergies!

The flavour was good although a little bland... And they were really dry even though I added an extra 1/4c. more liquid. I ended up having to substitute 1/2c. Oil, 1/2c. Apple juice for the applesauce since I didn't have any on hand. I also added an egg and addt. 1/4c. Apple juice. Next time I would add a bit more oil

I did 1/2 tsp soda and 1/2 tsp powder so it wasn't so dry.  I also had to add 1 tbs vanilla, 1 egg white, and 1/2 c milk.  Great flavor, but way too dry without my changes.

I was looking for a low-sugar muffin for my kids and these no sugar muffins are perfect. The raisins give them a bit of sweetness, but they are less sweet than your usual muffin.  I used butter instead of shortening.

I changed the recipe a fair amount! I used 1/2c coconut sugar instead of honey. I used 6Tbs butter instead of shortening. I added an egg. I used 1c cranberries (that I simmered in 1/4 c. cranberry juice) instead of the raisins. I also added 2tsp baking powder to the recipe. They turned out delicious!!!!

Way too dense. With addition of 3 eggs and a splash of milk, they were okay. Flavour is ok. Definitely could use some kind of topping.

I made this for my daughters for school snacks using ww flour, minus the raisins and walnuts.  Baked well, made 24 mini muffins.  They were a bit bland so would add the extras in next time, maybe carrot too.

I didn't have Crisco, so I used butter. It was way too dry and, for my taste, not sweet enough.  But my husband loved them so they're gone.

I have reservations about giving this recipe 4 or even 5 stars since I didn't follow it to the letter.   I like a cakier muffin, so although I used all the same ingredients except for the oil (I used melted butter), I followed the recommendations to add an egg and a splash of milk to the wet ingredients.  The batter was still thick but the results were excellent.   Inexperienced bakers should be warned to not overmix the batter.  Overmixing will change the texture. It might also be noteworthy that muffins should not be left to cool in the muffin pan.  That also changes the outcome.

I left out the cloves, but otherwise followed the recipe completely - everyone was amazed to know there was no sugar in them! They taste better fresh and warm, though - they became a little soggy in the fridge by day two.

I did what others had suggested and added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup milk. And instead of adding all the spices listed I just did a hefty teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. The muffins are nice and fluffy but they don't really have any sweetness.  If I make these again I would add 1/2 cup of sugar. They just need a little something.

Too dry originally; as someone else suggested - added 1/4 milk and 2 eggs, much better batter. Didn't have honey so used maple syrup and skipped the nuts - personal preference

I've never encountered a muffin recipe without eggs and milk. I add two eggs after seeing the consistency of the batter. In the oven now have to update in 20 mins.

To strong in cloves and very dense muffin.
