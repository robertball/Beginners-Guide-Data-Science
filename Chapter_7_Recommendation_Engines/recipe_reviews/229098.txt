I found it to be a bit bland.  The next time I made it I  substituted extra sharp cheddar, a bit more sour sour cream, a dash of cayenne and  seasoned salt. Overall a good comfort food.

My husband fell in love with this!  Actually me too!  HOWEVER I DID CHANGE IT.... I added the following ingredients to make it more colorful  :) ...I added (a can) of green French beans, 1 cup of small diced potatoes(cooked)1 can of mushroom soup, mushrooms, chives, large clove of garlic, whipping cream *instead of milk; 4 oz cream cheese and I placed grated cheese in the mixture as well as on top.
 ***My husband said I could make this EVERY week :)  Thanks for sharing your recipe - awesome idea...biscuits in a cream mixture!

Very easy and a quick dinner. I didn't have pimiento but it was good without it. It's usually just for color anyway. I made scratch biscuits. I will be making this again

The only thing I did different was added a second cream of chicken soup, green beans, and corn. My boyfriend is a very picky eater and he loved this.

This was super quick and yummy! I also added in green beans, navy beans, salt, pepper and cumin. I made bisquick biscuits since I didn't have frozen biscuits on hand. Will make this one again.

Easy to make and the whole family (including the non-chicken fans)loved it (in fact they were the ones who asked they we "put it in the rotation" of meals we love and make on a regular basis).

I have been making this for years. My hubby loves it ! I am a little concerned re the salt from the soup etc., however we do not have it every week. I saute fresh mushrooms and add to the mix, crumble some cheese (any kind I have )over the chicken mix and cover with a can of pillsbury crescent rolls. Yummy !!

Loved this recipe.  Quick and easy.  I left out the pimento simply because I didn't have any.  Baked the biscuits while the sauce cooked on the stove top.

Everyone loved it. I found that the biscuits{I used Pollsbury  buttermilk biscuits } seemed to soak up all o fthe liquid.  I think I will try baking the biscuits first next time.

I replaced onions with onion powder because I was avoiding grocery shopping. I think the temps are too high. We reduced the heat but the biscuits (canned - not frozen) still got very brown. So if using canned - cook the meal longer before putting on the biscuits. This was FANTASTIC.

This is by far one of my family's favorited meals! I make it as written except I probably add a bit more cheese than it calls for and I use canned biscuits when I don't have frozen. Delicious!

Very good, although I would suggest canned milk or water rather than milk.  It tastes kind of sweet with milk.  I also would add petite peas.

Easy and good. Didn't have pimentos, but added a can of green beans. Sauteed some garlic with the onion, otherwise made as is. Everyone loved it! This will probably end up in my weekly rotation. Thanks!

I added fresh chopped carrots & celery and fresh mushrooms.  I sautéed the mushrooms and onions then added chicken.  Once the chicken was done I added the soup, sour cream, milk and added parsley and cooked for about 1/2 hour over medium heat to cook the carrots and celery before putting in the oven.

What a great, easy dish to prepare!  Needed something in the way of a comfort food for an ailing family member & this filled the bill.  Added a handful of frozen green pepper for a little color & flavor, used canned jumbo biscuits and forgot to add the milk but the sauce was a nice consistency.  Thanks for a keeper.

My family love this recipe! I like to add vegetables though. Usually just a frozen mix. I used a soup mix last night including carrots, peas, okra, potatoes, celery, lima beans, and corn. It was, in our opinion, the best vegetable mix I've used yet. Also, I eliminate the pimento.

I made this months ago..... I loved it and the kids loved it... I just never wrote a review on it... I am always looking for new recipes to try or new ideas... This one I will be doing again in the near future :) 
I added some corn and peas to mine... It made a great meal that everyone liked....

Thanks Miranda,Delish, going back to these old fashioned recipes, they are simple and easy. Have made it twice since I found it followed exact recipe think next time i'll add more soup and a few extra veggies just to change it up a bit but it's fine as is!

Loved this!  I had some cooked rice leftover that I wanted to use up so I added a 2nd can of soup and doubled the milk as well.  Then I added defrosted peas and pearl onions to the mixture before putting into the oven - absolutely delicious.

It was really good, I added some peas and carrots to make it a little healthier and used a butter substitute. I got a 9/10 in my family's review, good job!

Too much processed food and way too much sodium.
