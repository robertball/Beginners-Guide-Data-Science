OMG! This stuff is beyond good! It's smokey, slightly sweet and definitely spicy! I used a 14 oz. bag of cole slaw mix vs. shredding cabbage. I used Hellman's light mayo and only 1 Tbsp. of chipolte peppers in adobo sauce because man are those peppers ever hot! I would add those to taste as you mix the dressing. Since I had cut that in half and yet wanted to maintain a level of smokiness, I added 1/4 tsp. of smoked paprika.  I mixed everything together and let it set in the fridge for a couple of hours. This stuff is fabulous! It was perfect with "Chili Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Apricot Ginger Glaze" from this site. I can't wait to try this with pulled pork!

So good! I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 plain yogurt and used a tad less chipotle/adobo sauce because I have wimpy tastebuds. Really excellent flavor combinations. Thanks! :)

I got this recipe on top of my Hellman's jar. Figured it would be a hit as I like all the ingredients less the chipotles in adobe which I had never tried. I loved it!  I used ingredients as shown except I only used 1/4 cup of mayo (and didn't miss it).  Now I need more recipes with chipotles.....

Yum-a-licious! I didn't really measure the ingredients, but followed it as-written but dropped out the cilantro (BF doesn't like) and threw in some red pepper because I had some chopped. A bag of slaw mix made prepping super easy and I didn't end up with a ton of extra cabbage. It tastes good right away but even better after letting it sit. Great side dish!

So good.  I used lite mayo.  Did not change anything else.  This was so good.  VERY spicy.  Will make again.

Eh...this was okay, but I was expecting better. The flavor profile sounded so interesting. I'm not sure exactly what it needs. Maybe just one tablespoon chipotle? Maybe a little vinegar? Maybe it's just not my thing. Probably won't make again.

This dish went really well with our pulled pork sandwiches. Due to a mix-up, ds got parsley instead of cilantro, so did not use cilantro (or parsley). After reading the other reviews, I chickened out on the adobo peppers and added red pepper instead. I thought the red pepper would be easier to control. Regardless, we loved this cole slaw.  I used a bag of shredded cole slaw mix and the dressing was really just enough for the whole bag.   Next time I plan on trying some adobo peppers so I will plan on updating my review accordingly. Until then, nice change of pace..cole slaw with a little kick plus easy to throw together quickly.

This cole slaw was pretty good. I was expecting it to be really spicy, but it wasn't too bad. My husband really liked it and my 3 year old ate a few bites of his. I paired it with a Mexican casserole to stay with a Mexican/Southwest style meal. We will definitely make this again when we get tired of the regular cole slaws. Thank you for this recipe!

no offense to anyone but this has got to be one of the worse things I have ever tasted. Maybe I did something wrong. I used half the amount of cabbage and onion because I like more sauce in my cole slaw and the sauce smelled sooooo good but when I tasted it a few hours later it was very bitter and way to hot and I love hot and spicy food but this was not a good hot and spicy.

Love, love, love this slaw! It is requested by friends every time we get together! Last time I made it, I used packaged broccoli slaw and it was even better!

I love coleslaw and I wanted to love this one, but we weren't crazy about it.  I did add less chipolte because we don't like things too spicy and it still turned out quite spicy.  I think the cumin overpowered the other flavors, so maybe decreasing the cumin a little would help.  On a positive note, quite a few people at my picnic did enjoy it!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I am not usually a fan of coleslaw, but was looking for a way to use some leftover chipotles and came across this.  I am so glad I tried it.  I love the spice in this dish.  After making it a few times as a side dish for family events, my mom came up with the idea of using it as a topping for fish tacos.  This is now how I use this cole slaw all the time.  It doesn't matter what kind of fish you use because this cole slaw makes the tacos.  Delicious!  Can't wait to have it again tonight!!!

I made this for a bbq this weekend.  I tripled the sauce (calculated to 12 servings) and it was just enough for two bags of pre-shredded cabbage and carrots.  I made the dressing the night before, then just added it to the dry ingredients a couple hours before serving.  Easy and delicious.  Spicy, but not too spicy.

My family thought this was ok.  It had fairly good flavor and nice heat...but we couldn't eat too much of it.  Kind of overwhelming for some reason.  I followed recipe exactly.  Probably won't make again.

I love spice but I've found that Chipolte peppers are just a little over the top so I used green chilies and added some cayenne to the sauce for some heat. Not a fan of the cilantro so that was replaced with flat leaf parsley and cut back on the cumin as it tends to overpower quite easily. Went really nicely with ribs and family enjoyed very much. Thank you!

I've got to believe I did something wrong because this was absolutely the word cole slaw I've ever tasted.  I love spicey food but this was burn the throat spicy with no taste other than the burn. Definetly was the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce that ruined it for me. Followed recipe exactly but perhaps should have just used the sauce and not the peppers....

I wanted to make this so those in my family who aren't coleslaw fans would have an alternative. But the peppers were too hot and the flavor profile just tasted off.

My dinner party RAVED about this coleslaw!  As someone else noted, I used the bagged coleslaw, which already has the carrots.  The only change I made was; when I taste tested it, the chipolte peppers do make this very spicy, so I tamed it down a bit with another couple tablespoons of mayo.  I served this with ribs, cornbread and corn on the cob.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe. Can easily cut calories by substituting some of the mayo for yogurt. If you swap the honey for molasses it is even better.

Made this today and it was exceptional!  Once of the best cole slaw recipes I've tasted.  I used a package of cole slaw mix, and probably used a little more chipotle peppers than the recipe called for(we love spice), but otherwise kept as is.  This is a keeper!

This was fantastic! I love Asian flavors in coleslaw and this one was exceptional. I served it with grilled peanut chicken from this site and toasted pitas - the combination was fantastic.

I got this recipe off a Hellman's jar and it is delicious! I am not normally a fan of cole slaw, but love spicy food. The chipotle peppers packs a punch. I am having it with BBQ chicken, and it was awesome apired with baby back ribs.
