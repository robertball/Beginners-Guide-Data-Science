There must be an error in the cooking directions on this recipe, in step 2.  It has you cooking at 425 for an hour and 10 minutes for medium rare.   That is way too long. I checked the bison council website and they recommend searing the meat stove top and cooking at 225 - so that is what I did.   The Bison tenderloin was so tender you could cut it with a fork and the Cherry Onion chutney made a lovely addition.

This was really good but I did alter the recipe as the cooking times seem wrong. I also added a touch of Chili powder and cumin to the rub. Then I preheated my grill, leaving an area for indirect heat. I seared the loin on all sides and then moved it to indirect heat (300 degrees) for about an hour with an internal temperature of 135. The Chutney was really good and the perfect compliment. Though it doesn't say in the recipe when to add the onions back into the cherry mixture, no big deal I just added them back in a little bit before I put the pears in and it turned out great. I will definitely do this again for company or a special occasion.
