This is the first time I've ever made pickled beets and I thought these turned out wonderful :) The spices add a really nice warmth to the recipe and the beets are quite addictive! It's also an easy recipe and a great way to use up a bunch of beets! These would be so great in all kinds of things, like salads and such. So good! Thanks for the recipe!!

while pickled beets are not everyone's favorite, this recipe ought to be a pickled-beet-fan's favorite! Very easy and just the right amount of spices.

I was looking to replicate a recipe from my grandmother-in-law and this worked nearly perfectly! I think the only difference is this one has a bit more cinnamon but I still love it just the same AND my 4 year old approves as well!

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and love it.  Have given away several jars, and people keep asking for more.  I use 3 cups of sugar, just to try and cut back a little, don't notice a difference.  Love the taste.

This is the BEST beet recipe. I have printed it and made it over and over. This fall I lost the print out and I was panicking that I wouldn't be able to find on Allrecipes.com thank goodness I did! I now saved it to "my recipes" I will never loose it again!

Absolutely fantastic! I do not can them.  After cooling I simply put in very large canning jar in the refrigerator, let the flavors blend for a couple of days, and enjoy.  Everyone raves, even those who thought that they didn't like pickled beets.

I took this recipe of pickled beets to a church potluck tonight and I was over the moon with compliments.  More beets are coming out of the garden this week.

Very good recipe -- a few small changes -- used apple cider vinegar and 2 tablespoons of whole cloves and 3 cups sugar. Next time will reduce to 2.5 cups. This was a very big hit-- and now required to bring when we have dinner with the fam.

i'm not a beet lover but my husband is so when we came into a couple of bundles of beets i thought i'd surprise him and try to pickle him some. well all i can say is wow. these are so good that i had to sit down and write my review right away. i scaled the recipe down to 9 servings and was alittle short on vinegar but with some minor adjustments they came out perfect. i didn't try the beets themselves but the juice was awesome. i got 3 pint jars and my husband is already trying to hide them so no one else can have any. this is definately a keeper and i will be doing them again.

This must be my mom's recipe.  She has been gone a few years now, but made it every one of her 78 years of marriage.  Now I make it with canned beets as I can't grow them where I live.  There is just no other acceptable pickled beet recipe,

These beets are awesome.  The addition of the cinnamon and cloves makes them extra special.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  10 would be more like it!  I love pickled beets, but hate paying the price the store asks for...and it's such a small jar.  Well, no more store bought beets for me.  This recipe yielded much more for me, but I did use a few more beets, probably about 18lbs.?  Anyway, I got 4 quart jars and 6-7 pint sized jars.  Gave them for part of my food basket I give to each family member, along with jams and preserves that I've canned in the summer.  Everyone loves these beets!  They are well spiced and flavorful.  I did reduce the salt to 1 T. to avoid the excessive saltiness that the other reviewers complained about.  I will make this each summer/fall when beets are in season.

Like another reviewer, I cook and peel beets first (easier to peel) and then cut.  I put in hot syrup and bring to a boil before putting in jars.

Wow...I just made these and tried a beet before I put them in the jars. If that is a sign of what is to come once we pop the jars, I can't wait!!

My first time canning beets. What a great recipe! My whole house smells delicious and they taste wonderful! The only problem I had was not knowing for sure how much 12 pounds was...no kitchen scale. So I ended up having to make more syrup as I had too many beets. But no big deal.
Thanks for submitting, it's a keeper!

Love it, Second year making it!! only thing I changed is the Cloves, not a big fan of Cloves, so I didn't add them. My kids also are big fans of this recipe of spiced pickled beets.

Awesome! I added a bit less sugar than asked for, added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon. And some sliced red onion. We made them for family Christmas gifts this year and added a pretty label and cloth top. It made 7 large almost full jars. I added a touch of water at the end to each jar. Hopefully they will be delish. The one or 2 we taste tested were fab!

I don't really like pickled beets that much but I like these, it turned out great. I sure wish I could print this recipe however, eventually I will have to copy it by hand for fear of losing it I'm not sure why some recipes on this site are not printable

Just got into canning and this was the second beet recipe I tried. It was fantastic. Very tasty and I think this will be my go-to recipe. I absolutely love 'em.

This recipe is just what I was looking for!!  I made a very small batch just to try the recipe (used 2 pounds of beets).  Because I was making such a small quantity I didn't bother with the canning process, I just refrigerated them.  But, I will be making the full recipe for canning since these pickled beets are FABULOUS!!  Thank you for sharing!

I made it pretty close to the way it is written,( i don't always measure, when cooking) and my family loves these beets. we also pickled some hot peppers from the greenhouse of different varieties, and some eggs too, and a large garden worth of beets too . its a nice recipe. i will do these every year with my garden beets. always nice to find a recipe that you will carry on.   Nathan.

This is the best pickled beet recipe that I have found so far. They are not as tart as some that I have tried in the past. The flavor is mild. My family liked them, and my family is picky. I planted more beets, so that I can make some more. 
So why didn't I give it 5 stars? I have had better, but she wouldn't give me the recipe. I will keep looking.

Awesome recipe, very easy to follow! This was my first time canning beets and they turned out soooo yummy! Didn't change anything in the recipe except that I used 500 ml canning jars instead of the 1 quart jars because I wanted to have more jars of beets to give to family and friends. I ended up with 12 x 500 ml jars plus some extra that I put in a container to eat since I didn't have any more jars.

I used a little less of the spices just because it was sooo much more spice than I had ever made beet pickles with.  We really like how they turned out.

Just finished eating the last of ten pints I made several months ago and must say that this recipe is as good as it is easy.  But  you can save yourself the hassle and work of using fresh beets.  I used canned sliced beets (63 cents/can) and found that one can of sliced beets neatly fit into a  one pint jar.  Have the hot brine (per recipe) ready. Drain off the beet liquid from each can and pour the beets into sterilized jars.  Ladle the hot brine into the jars, then seal and process.  Easy peasy!

I love pickled beets and saw the reviews for this recipe so I tried it. I got the beets for $4.99 for a peck. The peck was a bit more than 12 pounds - more like 14 pounds. The time frame is right on for the recipe. The aroma is magnificent! I ended up with 7 quarts and one pint. I did not have liquid to fill the pint jar, so I am eating the beets and my oh my are they the BEST beets I have ever had. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Beets are not one of my favorite root vegetables, but they have a reputation of being packed with nutrition and I enjoy them pickled.  This recipe has certainly placed beets on the list of foods I will eat more regularly.  It was easy to prepare, and the result was appreciated,...Nicole

I had to combine a couple recipes to make these perfect so reviewing this exact recipe isn't totally accurate. However, it's a great place to keeps notes for next time. Here's what I did. I didn't slice them because I like bite size small or quartered beets. Then I doubled the brine because I wanted 12 to 14 pint jars. That doubled the cinnamon and it looked like WAY to much so I took over half of it out. I added a handful of whole cloves to the brine (not ground) and one to each jar. When the brine was done, I could've drank it it was so delicious!  In the end, I had a ton of brine left and think I could've gotten away with a single batch for my 13 pints.  These are the best pickled beets I've ever had!!! (sorry mom).

Used a 4-4-4 ratio vinegar, beet water and sugar. Reduced to 1 TBSP Cinnamon, 1 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp semi crushed whole Cloves
