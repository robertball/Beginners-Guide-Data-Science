I love the frosting and when my children were young, I always made this frosting.However, the last two times i made the frosting the sugar did not dissolve all the way and it tasted like grains or sugar.  What did I do wrong?  Thanks

I made this to frost a devil's food cake and it was wonderful. You have to work fairly fast while frosting your cake as it starts to set up (crust) a bit, so be sure to smooth the sides and top the way you want them because you can't really go back and do it again after a few short minutes like you can with buttercream. It was a nice light frosting and was wonderful with the deep chocolate cake, although it could be a little less sweet. Next time I will try to add a bit less sugar and see what happens.  Also, I did not have graininess the next day as some other recipes of this type have suggested. All in all this one is a keeper. Thank you!

I made this frosting over the weekend, and saw other comments on other sites that address the "grainy" issue some are having. The advice given on those is...don't let the boiling water touch the bottom of the pot in which you are mixing the frosting. Keep the water to a low simmer so that the water doesn't touch the top pot. If it touches, the frosting gets grainy. Hope this helps! I simmered the water and it turned out great.

good and easy to follow recipe. i read that many complained they had sugar granules not fully dissolved when making this frosting. my suggestion would be that, try and use fine granulated sugar. if you don't have any, just pulse some regular granulated sugar in your blender. after adding all the ingredients in a bowl, put over double boiler, let the water boil first and then lower the heat. when you put your bowl over make sure the water ISN'T ACTUALLY BOILING. you'll cook your egg whites if you do this. just make sure there are tiny bubbles at the bottom of your pan. you just need  the steam to heat the eggs. now, instead of going straight with the mixer, USE A HAND WHISK FIRST and stir. This will make sure that your sugar is fully dissolved. After the sugar has dissolved, then use the HAND MIXER, and whisk at full speed for about 3-4mins. I took my bowl off the boiler after that and continued whisking until you get that nice frothy consistency and lastly add the vanilla essence. Hope that helps!

Folded in just under 1 C semisweet choc. chips right after taking the frosting off the heat, then quickly frosted my cake.  It made a GORGEOUS chocolate swirl pattern as the chips melted in the warm frosting.  I sprinkled a few chips on the top afterwards, too.  Delicious and looks great!

I used the extra fine sugar hoping I would not have the grainy texture problem.  _--Didn't work. I am guessing my problem is I didn't let the mixture sit on the top of the boiler long enough before I got in there with the mixer. (I was sorta afraid to wait too long and risk the sugar burning!!) It formed the peaks and it tasted the way my hubby remembered--it's just that darned texture thingy.  The pressure to replicate his Grandma's 7 min. frosting recipe is too great...I don't know if I can bring myself to go down this road again.

This is really good frosting.  I made it to top an angel food cake for a birthday.  My dad said it tasted just like when he was a little boy, and the kids loved it.  It was a little sweet for me, and I added only 1 3/4 c sugar.  The only thing about this recipe that I didn't like was that it made way too much frosting for one cake and you can't really save it for another time.  I ended up throwing a lot of it away.  I would make it again, but probably cut it down by 1/3.

Paula Deen's recipe for this says the graininess is caused by letting boiling water splash on the underside of the bowl. You can also use cream of tartar instead of the corn syrup, which would cut down a bit on the sweetness, and the 'gelatinous' texture someone mentioned. Paula's recipe is available on the food network site.

my mom and grandma always make this and use a plain white cake (2 8in layers) then put sliced bananas in between the layers and on top of the cake. They use this icing and it is delicious. Needs to be eaten the first day though because bananas tend to get gross looking the next day

I am making seven minute frosting in a few minutes.  Before I put the mixture over the water I mix it together until blended.  Then, I turn the water down and mix sometimes for only 5 or 6 minutes.  I take it off the water and mix for another minute or two until I get the right consistency.  Hope this helps.

Makes a GENEROUS amount for filling and frosting a nine-inch cake.  This frosting is yummy, but the texture is not quite like I remember it as a kid... it's more marshmallowy and gelatinous.  My mum's recipe did not use corn syrup, so maybe that's why.  Great with dark chocolate cake.

This was quick and easy to make. I didn't have any grainyness. You must quickly frost your cake as this icing cools rapidly and can become unworkable! I had more than enough to frost a 9 inch layer cake. I used it to frost a coconut cake instead of my usual buttercream.

I have used this recipe for years and have learned (the hard way) that if the water from the bottom pot touches the bottom of the top pot the icing will be grainy.  Now I use smaller amounts of water in the double boiler and it seems to be the solution to the grainy problem.  Good Luck!

Made to frost black chocolate cake (delicious) from this site, baked for a birthday. The frosting looked good but tasted very very sweet. By the time we were ready to slice the cake, the frosting tasted grainy. unappealing. Not sure what was worst the sweetness or the texture.sorry but will not make it again.

Yuck. Too grainy ruined my cake by "frosting" it. Sugar didn't dissolve. I made this 10 years ago, looked amazing and wasn't grainy. I checked many things to make sure I followed the recipe right so I don't know what's up with this frosting. 

Sorry

Yes I'll make it again. Tried to follow the suggestions but it still came out grainy. The family still loved it. Next time will use less water and lower heat.

RECIPE: great one, but too sweet for me. I usually go with 1 cup sugar to 2 egg whites ratio. 
PROCEDURE: (@) place all ingredients in the bowl and whisk gently over a double boiler. It will be gloppy at first but once you get the sugar grains to melt, the mixture will be a smooth, even, syrupy consistency. You can then switch to your handheld mixer and beat until fluffy. (@) my handheld mixer's cord is not long enough to reach my stove, and I won't be bothered to use an extension cord, so I made changes in the process. what I do instead after achieving the smooth even syrupy consistency is remove the bowl from the double boiler then transfer into a bigger mixing bowl and beat with my mixer. VOILA! NO SUGAR GRAINS IN THE FROSTING!

One note...For all variations of this 7-minute frosting that find their finished icing to be grainy ( Undesolved sugar )... be sure the water in the double boiler does not touch the bottom of the top boiler.  Let the surrounding steam and heat cook your mixture while constantly beating...could take a few minutes more to get a firm but smooth frosting.  Works EVERY time !!  Have fun !!

I make this a lot!  Changed the recipe over my 50+ years of baking! Add 3/4 cup marshmellow fluff to stiff frosting.  No grains, no crust! Can ice right on a hot cake too!  I use the 1/4 t. tartar and 1 T. corn syrup,, 2 egg whites, sugar, water......never fails!

THIS IS IT! This is the frosting from my husbands childhood memories! However, I have to almost mess it up to get what he's been looking for, which is fluffy, moist frosting with a dry outer crust. This was achieved by cooking & whipping over a simmering double boiler for 10 minutes & frosting the cooled chocolate fudge cake immediately. VERY sweet for my tastes but it was exactly what he's been looking for!

Very Good Recipe. Came out perfect. Made another Coconut Cake recipe on this site and sub this for the frosting then toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on top. Awesome!!!
