At first I wasn't sure if maybe I would ruin 
the cake by adding the sugar/water solution.  Fearful
that my dessert would become "soggy cake," I only 
added half of the mix.  Next time, I'll
know better--add it all!  It truly makes it a wonderful,
unique dessert!

This cake was pretty good, but I decided not to use the sugar glaze.  I thought the cake was already sweet and didn't really need it.  I also added a bit of vanilla

My husband, who is retired, made this cake and everyone who ate some wanted the recipe. The lazy ones wanted to know when he was going to make another one. My husband was a plumber. So, yes it was easy to make.

This pound cake is amazing!  I made it for my step father who is really particular about his pound cakes, and he loved it!  It's super flavorful and moist.  You can definitely taste the hint of coconut from the extract without getting an overwhelmingly coconut flavor.  The texture comes out almost like a fudgey consistency.  The only thing I had to alter was the baking time.  Had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes to achieve the appropriate doneness.

Light, moist and delicious.  Flavoring goes all through the cake.  Co-workers really enjoy it when I make one and bring it to work.

This cake has a great flavor!  I really enjoyed it.  I couldn't find my tube pan so I ended up using 3 smallish loaf pans.  They baked for about 40 minutes and I turned the oven down to 300 because the edges were getting dark.  It is definitely sweet.  I may attempt it again with a little less sugar.  I think it would be a great candidate for a good dousing of rum if you like rum cake.  I also did not have coconut extract so I used vanilla extract in place of it.  I love the crunchy top and edges!  It is a bit crumbly which made it difficult to cut into thin slices and a bit messy.  Overall taste and texture is very good.  I will make LOTS of little holes next time.  I didn't make nearly enough so parts of the slices were a bit dry.

I made this cake substituting a cup of pina colada mix instead of the milk, regular and evaporated. I used the leftover mix for the glaze. It turned out perfect and was a great hit.

Too sweet.  I followed it exactly, but much too sweet, even without the glaze.

I love this recipe it was so easy to make, because I have kids I decided to put a little color to it and it was great. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect. I will be making this again. Also I did not use the glaze just like the other person said the cake is sweet so I cut down the sugar to 2 cups and a half but next time I will only use 2 cups. Great recipe

I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8X8 glass pan for 55 minutes. It turned out great and the flavor is wonderful.

I added half a cup of macaroon coconut, and used water instead of milk, and this was a fantastic cake. I didn't get around to making the glaze, and it was still gobbled up; I can only imagine how good it would be with that extra flavor inside. I will make this again, and soon.

Great, I had made it before a long time ago and it was called "5 Flavor Pound Cake."
