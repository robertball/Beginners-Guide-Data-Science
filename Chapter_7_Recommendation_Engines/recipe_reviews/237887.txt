Curious and interesting. First off, I didn't quite understand how the zucchine were supposed to be cut as it is written "sliced lengthwise and sliced".  hmmm??  Nor could I understand why they needed to be peeled, so I didn't peel them.   I made one half as written and the other half with some garlic added when saut√©ing the zucchine.  I like that there is no salt, parmesan has it already as does the tomato sauce.  The original version is a nice idea.  The garlic in my second attempt added some extra flavour and I preferred it so will continue to do it this way in the future.  Thanks for sharing.

I think, this could have really worked with a fresh tomato sauce. I tried something that seemed similar at the Bone Fish Grill recently, with cubed zucchini, which I did do here too. My only other real change was cutting the basil and oregano in half and that was plenty. I also ended up stirring in a couple of pinches of garlic salt. My issue was the canned tomato sauce, just really had such a strong canned/salty flavor that was very dominant. It almost reminded me of the jarred sauces loaded with vegetables. I may try this with crushed tomatoes, instead, and then re-review. I think, that will do the trick for me. ty

It was a great summer dish. I supplemented with Vodka sauce from the jar. I used 2 yellow summer squash and 2 zucchini unpeeled. I sliced it lengthwise into 1/4" thick slabs. Next I cut strips 1/4" thick from the slabs and tossed out the seed section. Salt the strips for about half hour in a colander then rinse and dry. Fry up 4 cloves garlic and 2 shallots for 2 minutes in the oil and add squash. Sprinkle on your Italian seasoning and cook for 6-8 minutes tossing occasionally. Stir in a couple cups of your favorite sauce for 2 minutes, turn off heat and cover in cheese...enjoy!

I cooked the zucchini in oil for 5 minutes, which was perfect and not too mushy. I would cook it at medium low heat next time and use tongs to put the zucchini slices in, because the grease spattered up and burned my hand when I placed them in the pan. I would also cut the zucchini into cubes so it's more bite-sized. I ended up cutting the strips into cubes with kitchen scissors at the end.  I would also put the zucchini slices on a paper towel after cooking to absorb some of the oil.

Both my brother and I weren't so sure we liked zucchini until we had this! Made it tonight and it was easy, quick and delicious. Served it with grilled chicken and roasted red potatoes. Awesome. Added garlic and some crimini  mushrooms to the zucchini  (to use them up) and they worked well together . Thanks for this great recipe!

It appears as if some of you think tomato sauce is from the can.  No, No.  I have made this with my Italian parents.  If you want a delicious dish, use the good  spaghetti sauce in a jar or make  your own.  We had these on Summer Sunday's with the homemade spaghetti sauce.  of course, the main meal was spaghetti!!!

I made this for dinner to go over spaghetti for our veggie night. I added cremini mushrooms like another reviewer had said just to use them up.  Worked out really well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is simple and wonderful.   I've made this a couple times.  Quickly becoming our go-to veggie side with Italian food.

Great side dish, especially when we were trying new ways to use up our bumper crop. I used our homemade salsa and also added a bit of shredded cheddar on top. I put a lid on for a minute or so at the end until the cheese was melty.
