Fabulous recipe - my family has been making it for years.  One suggestion - make the bars a "sandwich."  Spread half of the cereal mixture in the pan, top with the melted chips - and spread the rest of the cereal mixture on top.   Keeps the gooey chocolate on the cookie - and not on you!

These are very tasty bars, but it would be helpful if the recipe pointed out more carefully what one reviewer noted - that is, to barely let the corn syrup/sugar solution start to bubble and then quickly remove it from the heat, so that the bars will be soft.  I didn't know to do that and ours are really hard to bite into and chew.  But, we can just barely bite into them and they are still really good!  So with that modification, I would have given them 4 or 5 stars!

Have made these for years from an old German village church cookbook.  Always loved.  Always a hit.  Don't leave out the butterscotch chips -- they make all the difference.
Enjoy!

A family favorite and personal specialty!  I ate these all the time when I was pregnant!  My hubby jokes my daughter is made of scotcheroos.  :)  After making these many (MANY) times, here are my tips:  1.  Make sure you boil the syrup and sugar just the right amount.  About 30-45 seconds at full boil.  Sugar should just dissolve.  Less, and they won't stick together well, more and they'll be too hard.  2.  It's best to mix the chocolate and butterscotch chips on a double boiler or something, but in a hurry, just pour them both on top of the rice krispies, and stick them in the microwave or oven for a bit to melt, then spread them with a spatula.  Don't let them burn!  This is the way Grandma always makes it.  3.  My Aunt uses Milk chocolate chips, and people like that.  (I like the butterscotch, though.)  Just butterscotch is great for people who don't want or like chocolate.  4.  These are great in both a 9x13 pan, and a jellyroll pan.  It makes them thinner.

Fabulous!  I brought these to a party recently and everyone loved them!  I would suggest only refrigerating them for an hour before cutting into squares, otherwise they get too hard.

This has been a favorite of mine for years.It's quick, easy and no bake.  It works with Rice Krispies or Special K. You can also use chunky peanutbutter.

This always a big hit at bake sales.  I sometimes don't use the butterscotch chips.  I use all different type of chips, just make sure you use a full two cups.

Being the eldest of 5 kids, these treats didnt stand a chance. 
They smelt so good, I had to put a timer on so the sibs would let it stand for the full 45 minutes!!! Easy, simple and quick.. I'll definately be making these again!!

YUM!  Peanut butter and chocolate are my favorites so I knew I would love this.  It is the BEST!  To make these for a halloween treat, I formed them into mice.  I used an Easter egg pan which I greased.  Once formed, I dipped them in the melted chips instead of spreading it.  I used whole almonds for the ears, string red licorice for the tail, and a tube of Wilton black decorating icing for the eyes and nose.  The recipe itself was so easy to make as were the mice.  You could make them bigger as rats as well.  Thank you Karo for sharing such a delicious recipe!

I absolutely love these!  I do make a couple changes though.  First, I double both chips to 2 cups each.  Second, I add peanut butter to the corn syrup and sugar before heating.  I bring it just to a boil...one bubble...and I take it off the stove and immediately add cereal.  I have never had them get hard or crunchy when doing it this way.  Must try recipe!

My mom has been making these for years and they are a family favorite.  For those who have trouble cutting them, try taking the sugar/corn syrup mixture off the stove as soon as it starts to bubble (don't wait for a rolling boil) and make sure you use full fat peanut butter, not the reduced fat stuff.

I was excited to find this recipe after my husband brought me home something similar from a local bake shop. I had no idea what it was called, but it was so good! Before making this, I read every review to see what changes ppl made. It seemed that most ppl increased the chocolate & butterscotch chips to a full bag. After making it and following those reviews, I would stick to what the recipe calls for. As much as I LOVE chocolate, I found it was too much for the amount of rice krispy the recipe calls for. Or if you do increase the chocolate, I would increase the rice crispy too. I only used half a cup of sugar as well figuring that it would be sweet enough (which it was) with the chocolate on top. Annnnnd, I'll use a little bit more PB next time! Great recipe, glad I found it!!!

I thought this recipe was good but way way too sweet!  I don't know if you need the extra sugar in the syrup. If I ever made these again, I would omit the additional sugar.  Also, the people that are having difficulty with the end product being hard, you are cooking the syrup and sugar mixture too long.  It should never boil as that is how you make hard candy.  If you are unsure of what temperature is ok, try using a candy thermometer and keep it under the soft candy stage.  Hope this helps.

I use a slightly different recipe with only Rice Krispies, PB, honey and chocolate but any variation is a huge hit! A helpful hint: I keep mine in the fridge after pressing into the pan and let it cool before spreading the chocolate - it just makes for easier and more even spreadibility.

I must admit these turned out much better than I anticipated.  They were good but I wouldn't say great; however if your looking for something easy that the kids will probably like these will do the job.

Great go-to recipe! Always a hit! I agree with the reviews, that not letting the sugar-corn syrup mixture come to a boil is the key to soft bars. When you see the first few bubbles, turn it off right away, add the peanut butter, and mix well. I also have found that about another 1/4 cup of peanut butter helps them stay chewier too.  Awesome!

Awesome recipe, for a change of pace, instead of making bars, pour over popcorn and spread out on waxed paper. This is one of those snacks that is hard to leave alone.

YUM.  These were great and fairly easy.  I had the peanut butter pre-measured so I could add it in once I took the corn syrup and sugar off the heat.  I used a double-boiler to melt the chocolate, also.  Taking these to a party, so of course I had to test one (or 3) before I went.  Hehe.  These are great!
Another note:  I made these again yesterday for another get-together and realized at the last minute that I was short about a cup of rice cereal.  I substituted crushed corn flakes for the remainder and I couldn't tell a difference - they still came out great!

Like many others, I've been making this recipe for YEARS. Always a huge crowd pleaser. I have a few suggestions regarding the prep.  Your life (and cleanup) will be much easier if you spray your mixing spoon and bowl (before you add the rice crispy cereal) with Pam. Also, when I press the mixture into the pan, I spray a big, fat spatula with Pam and use that to flatten and smooth the mixture. Works great.

They tasted delicious but were rock hard! Make sure you remove the sugar from heat immediately or they will turn hard.

These are delish! I didn't have butterscotch chips on hand, had only a bag of milk choco chips so I used that. Made the mistake of refrigerating them for a couple of hours...it was hot in my kitchen....and they got so hard only a jackhammer could have cut them! They were fine after they sat for about 15 minutes. Next time I will follow the recommendation to put the chocolate in the middle of two layers, that's a great idea! These bars were history in no time!

My mom made these when we were kids, and now I make them for my kids! Great for any potluck event or family gathering.  SO ADDICTING, you can't eat just one!  The chocolate may not seem thick at first, but when it firms up, it's plenty.

I have also spread the cereal mixture into a rectangle, topped it with the melted chips and then rolled it up "jelly roll" style. Slice the pinwheels an inch thick and allow them to set up. Or you can freeze them in single layers divided by parchment or wax paper. This is a great make ahead party treat. Just set them out to thaw.

The wife and brother absolutely loved these! I personally would give it like a 3 or 4 star...but that is because I'm not a fan of chocolate...but it is super gooey and thats always a plus with us!

We have made these for over 35 years.  One of my family favorites.  Sometimes I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet!  Make a great gift for the chocolate lover!  NOTE:  IF YOU COOL THEM TOO LONG BEFORE CUTTING...JUST LET THEM SIT ON COUNTER A BIT TO SOFTEN BEFORE TRYING TO CUT.

I made a small batch of this in the microwave. I cooked the syrup and sugar for 1 1/2 minutes stirring it every 20 seconds. I used Life cereal. I like it.

No problems with this bar, sweet and satisfying especially with a strong cup of coffee. I'm aware Karo submitted this version but I was all out of corn syrup (surprise!) so I substituted honey. I made these to satisfy a childhood memory my boyfriend had of peanut butter chocolate cereal bars so I also nixed the butterscotch and used all chocolate chips on top. I have a hunch the 'scotch chips would make this more flavorful still but I sure haven't gotten any complaints making it with just chocolate. Followed the recipe and reviews closely and allowed the mixture to come JUST to a boil: the bars were firmer than the marshmallow recipes but I actually prefer them that way to pack so easily for work. I will make these again, thanks so much for submitting and sorry Karo!

I tried twice to get the butterscotch morsels to melt smoothly when combined with the chocolate morsels. The first time I tried cooking the chocolate as instructed on the stove top w/o a waterbath.  The chocolate mixture seized up. I threw it out. The second time using the microwave and microwaving on 70% power at 30 second intervals I had the same problem. On my third attempt I finally melted the chocolate morsels individually and spread the chocolate on top of the bars.  I then melted the butterscotch morsels in a separate bowl and melted them. I ended up having to add crisco into the butterscotch morsels to get them to a point of smooth consistency.  For all my work these were good, but rather sweet and I'm not sure they would be worth repeating regularly.

This is the exact recipe we've been using for years - it is ALWAYS a huge hit wherever I take them. I'm usually not a fan of butterscotch, but they're really a necessity in these. I've had them where people don't use the butterscotch chips, and they just don't taste anywhere near as good. I never refrigerate mine because they get too hard, I just make sure and make them well before I'll need to take them anywhere. Delicious and easy!

I was disapointed with the lack of gooey texture in the bars.  They were rather hard.  Perhaps less cereal or more Karo would help this.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again as directed.  I did find one suggstion to be nice:  extra chips!  I used 1-1/2 cups of each.

I made  this per the recipe and they were rock hard. I could hardly get them out of the pan. I made them for a bake sale and ended up not using them at all. I will go back to the regular rice krispie bars. Very disappointing.

I don't like overly sweet desserts & I really just wanted to use up some old cheerios so I skipped the sugar & just used dark choc chips, it was really yummy, more like a cereal bar this way. I used the fridge to cool & a big sharp knife to cut. I'll make again.  super easy too.

I had these many times, but had no idea what they were.  The mix of chocolate and butterscotch on top is divine.  Also it's so much easier to push the rice krispies in here than with rice krispie treats where the marshmallows get hard fast.  Delicious and you can cut them into tiny pieces since they are so dense and fun to eat.

Just made a batch for the holidays and my husband and I did some taste testing.  These are delicious, however very sweet!  Cut into very small bars.  I found this recipe easier than the traditional Rice Krispies Treats and like it much better.

My aunt makes these with the sole difference that she puts the butterscotch/chocolate in the middle.  I tried them with the choc on top this time, but my aunt's strategy is better, as it keeps your hands cleaner and gives it a softer consistency due to the soft chocolate in the middle.

made these for the first time for a work bake sale and had to make a second batch as the first were gone before I could even get them out of the house the only thing I did different is I did not use 6 cups of rice crispies I only used about 4 1/2 as that is the most I could stir in and they were nice and chewy this is a keeper for sure

I have been making these for about 30 years now and they are always everyone's most requested item on my Christmas candy plate. I, like another viewer, use a whole bag of chocolate chips and a whole bag of butterscotch chips because this is the way my recipe read from home ec class and 4-H  back in the 70's. The only complaint I have is that they are not that easy to cut. I turn mine out on a cutting board and use a really large very sharp knife to get them cut as evenly as possible.

Awesome recipe!  A favorite during harvest!  I leave them in the trucks for the guys to pick up when they unload the combines.  They are ALWAYS gone quickly.  I usually make a pan a day during harvest!  I use 1-1/2 cups peanut butter - makes it chewier.

I've made these for years, they're super easy.  I usually boil the syrup peanut butter mixture for about 15-30 seconds just to make it easier to mix in with the cereal.  There are never any leftovers when I take these to friend's!

Very similar to the Scotcharoo recipe (spelled with an "a") on this site.  A nice alternative to Rice Krispie Treats.  Try microwaving the peanut butter mixture.  It takes less than three minutes-stir after each 45 seconds to 1 minute.

A childhood FAVORITE!! My mom's best friend, "Aunt" Sonja would often make these fabulous treats for me when I was a little girl living in Spokane, WA back in the early 1960's.  She always used Kix cereal but I find that Reese's Peanut Butter cereal works GREAT, too!  The Reese's PB cereal really gives it an extra punch of peanut buttery taste!!! YUMMMY!!!!

This is really good! Timing is everything with this recipe so do not boil for more then 30 secs. I take mine off the heat at 25 seconds and work quickly to get the peanut butter mixed. one of my favorite desserts!

made this for the first time, but used microwave instead of cooktop...waved the corn syrup & sugar for 1 minute, stir, add peanut butter, wave it for 2 minutes stir after each minute, poured over the rice krispies & combined...also waved the chips 1 minute then stir to blend....all worked very well

i used the full 12 oz of both the chocolate chips and the butterscotch.. these were tasty, but messy!  next time i will take the suggestion of putting the chocolate/butterscotch inbetween layers of the crispies.

AMAZING. I didn't have any chocolate chips and the store was closed, but I decided to make them anyways! I used Cocoa Crispy Rice cereal (it's all I had) instead of regular Rice Crispy Cereal. And I added a little extra peanut butter. I stuck them in the ice box for about 30 minutes and then cut them. They are so soft and chewy! SUPER yum! I can't wait to try them when I have some chocolate chips in the house!

My sister discovered this recipe over 25 years ago & it has become a family favorite. Our kids request them whenever they come home for a visit & we always serve them at family get-togethers. I like to use crunchy peanut butter just to add a little crunch to the bars. Easy to make & delicious!

These are overly sweet and quite chewy. The next day they were so hard I could hardly cut them.  Is there a revision that would make them more the texture of the original rice krispies treat?

Excellent!!!!!  I did use crunch peanut butter as that was all I had.  Next time I may spread them out on a cookie sheet to make them thinner and easier to cut.  Thanks for a keeper!!

These were requested at our last school bakesale, but we didn't have them.  To prevent that from happening again, I made this recipe.  They were very good.  I did substitute 1.5 C Butterscotch and .5 Cup Hershey's Special Dark chips.  Because they are difficult to cut, I scored them while still warm, and then once again a few minutes later.  When cooled, they cut up beautifully.

I'm only giving this one 4 stars because, as written, this recipe is way to sweet. I've been using this recipe for years with the exception that I omit the sugar. Between the corn syrup, the peanut butter, and the chocolate and butterscotch chips,  there's more than enough sugar to make these a sweet, delicious treat. Very easy, too!

I made these and for some reason, they ended up being rock hard. Honestly, I couldn't even cut them without sawing through them- it was easier just to break off a piece and eat. I couldn't give them to my 2 year old because I was worried he would hurt his teeth.

This is the first time I have ever seen the title Scotcheroos for these squares other than the ones I make.I have been making these for 50 years, and they always disappear very quickly. My college age grandsons LOVE them. I also use the whole bag of chipits. You can also substitute peanut butter chipits for the butterscotch. Using a slightly smaller pan gives you lovely thick pieces!

Husband tried to be helpful and ended up turning the melted chips into a weird brownie flan type thing. Made him run back to the store to get more so I could redo it. Otherwise, just like when my mom and I would make them when I was younger!

I only used 5 cups of rice cereal.  I also only used 2/3 cup of sugar.  Turned out great, and tastes great.  Next time I will use a smaller pan also. 9x13 is a bit too big.

I did it like this: 
Peanut butter and the corn syrup together. don't mix. Add rice crispy cereal to peanut butter and corn syrup. Melt chocolate and butterscotch chips together on the stove. Then pat down mixture in a pan of any size (depends on how big you want it to be). Pour chocolate and butterscotch mixture on top. Let cool. Eat

I made some changes according to what I had on hand, and they didn't come out as good as I had hoped.  My fault!  I could tell that if I had used the right ingredients, they would have been great, so that is what my rating is based on.  I don't rate things on my own mistakes.  Can't wait to make these again with the proper ingredients.  Maybe I will add some crumbled pretzels because I love them with chocolate and peanut butter.

If you are a noob to cooking as I was when I made this and if you are the type to read the directions as you go instead of beforehand, then I have a few words of advice for you. This recipe is delicious, but there are a few things you should know:


1) Grease everything. Grease your hands. Grease the utensils you're using. Grease the cups. Grease the ceiling. Grease your clothes. Grease the sink. Grease your dog. Grease anything the mixture could possibly come into contact with.  


2) When they say a large pot to boil the corn syrup and sugar together in, THEY MEAN IT. I used a medium pot because I thought eh, I don't need a large pot to boil two cups of stuff in. I was so wrong. I didn't think much of my medium pot while I put the peanut butter in the mix because it's just another cup. But my brow started sweating when I saw you had to put the 6 cups of rice krispies on top of it. It was like a rice krispie waterfall on my stovetop. This leads to


3) Do NOT let the syrup/sugar/peanut butter mix to sit for too long. During my scramble of trying to find a large bowl to toss the mess in, the corn syrup/sugar/peanut butter mix began cooling and hardening beneath the cereal. Wut. When I finally found a large bowl in a cupboard, I had to beat the hardened sugar lump out of the bottom of the pot. Then the bowl started tipping because I realized I had set it on the sink ledge. Panic ensues again as I grab the bowl and the pan and relocate them to free counter space. Well this is a

These are truly delicious.  Instead of corn syrup, though I use organic agave syrup, which is, to me healthier, and instead of a whole cup, I use about 3/4 cup, and also 3/4 cup of sugar, and they are still delicious.  Everybody always loves them, they go fast at potlucks and celebrations.

Very good recipe. I refrigerated them for about 1/2 hour before cutting them so that the chocolate would harden. After I cut them, I put them back in the fridge, because it was warm in the house and the chocolate was melting. After being in the fridge for a while, the bars got VERY hard and brittle and difficult to eat. I took a few bars out of the fridge, and they became soft again after just a few minutes. Now, I store them in the fridge and just take them out a few minutes before I'm going to serve them. Works out perfectly!!

Turned out perfect. I took them to our fall neighborhood block party. I dressed them up with Halloween candy corn and pumpkins. The kids loved them of course.

My Grandmothers recipe calls for 1/4 cup of butter also to melt in with the sugar, peanut butter and syrup,a nd that's what I do. I have had many compliments and people asking for my recipe.  They stay nice and gooey for about a week!

Like another reviewer, I also used a full bag of butterscotch chips and a full bag of chocolate chips.  I wanted a thicker layer of chocolate, and I knew the quantity indicated in the ingredients would be just enough for a thin layer in the 13x9 pan.  (I've made this many times before.)  You can also try using less butterscotch chips and more chocolate chips if you want more of a chocolatey flavor.  Both versions are yummy!

This has been our family favorite for decades! I still have the original recipe square my Mother cut  from the 1960's Rice Krispies box. Now the secret is out BIG favorite to take to any gathering. As others noted once the syrup and sugar start to boil remove from heat to complete mixing. They are a bit harder when boils too long, also I have been using a sheet cake pan instead of  a 9X13 and by pressing them thinner makes more , just use a whole 12 oz bag of choc. chips & butterscotch chips.

I will say that I received rave reviews from my family. I personally would have liked them to have more rice crispy and a tad less chocolate. As I said my family LOVED them. Thanks for sharing.

we have also made this for years.  Everybody loves them. They do not last even a day around our house.  I make them a lot for 
other people and every time I make them for someone new, they ask for more.   Just don't ever over boil the sugar mixture or you will have hard treats:)

This is pretty much the same recipe we use at work, and with the suggestion noted by one other reviewer to not overcook it, it also helps to add a couple teaspoons, or even tablespoons of vanilla to the corn syrup and sugar mixture.  It really helps to ensure a chewy bar, not TOO chewy or tough.

These are great. I did let my sugar boil for about a minute to get it to melt- I re-read reviews while they were setting up and became afraid that they would be hard, but I have had a few and they are not too hard yet.

Made this for my husbands office and they were apparently a hit. I personally found them far too sweet and if I made them again would omit the butterscotch for more milk chocolate. Split decision on this one.

I grew up eating Scotcheroos from a recipe exactly like this one...came to find it and so glad I did.  They are sooo good!!!  Like, stupidly, good!  Everyone always loves them.  My mom insists you should double the chocolate and butterscotch topping, but I think it's perfect as is.  Yay Scotcheroos!

these taste better than the store bought ones. I didn't put chocolate/butterscotch on the top. Also added extra peanut butter like an extra half cup and added an extra half cup of crispies

Excellent! Missed these for a while and finally thought to seek out the recipe. Took them to a family reunion and left with an empty pan. :) I especially like the addition of butterscotch chips to the chocolate - it really set off the flavor.

I didn't care for the butterscotch chips. Next time I will use all semi-sweet chocolate chips. Other than that, I thought it was great.

AWESOME!!! By far the best rice krispy bars ever. Whenever I take these bars to a potluck, cookout, or picnik I never had leftovers, not even once. Both kids and adults love these. They disappear very quickly...that says alot about how good these bars are. I am always requested to bring scotcheroos to every gathering. =)

I absolutely love the taste of peanut butter crispies, but the chocolate on top is way too much for me.  Next time I'll try cutting the chocolate / butterscotch mixture in half or removing it altogether.  Oh, and living in a small apartment I have no 9 * 13 pan, much to my surprise. So I put the dish in two 8 * 8 pans which worked fine. Next time I'll probably cut the recipe in half and just use one 8 * 8 pan.

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe.  Maybe only using 5 cups of the rice crispy cereal would have been better.  Seemed very dry when everything was done.

This recipe was great! Although I did make a couple of changes: I added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and did 1 1/2 cups butterscotch chips to 1 cup chocolate chips. But, other than that it was great!

My boys loved these. They are very good, but extremely sweet. I almost didn't use the butterscotch chips because I personally don't care for it very much, but since my sons do I used them anyway. As expected they are very sweet. I was surprised the recipe called for adding sugar to corn syrup because it's a sweet syrup already. Next time I think I will probably be making the following changes: either completely cut out the sugar or cut it way back. I also think I would prefer the recipe without the butterscotch chips and will instead mix in some peanut butter (probable 1/2 to 1 cup) into the chocolate. My husband loves peanut butter and chocolate together.

I love this recipe but here is what I do different. I use 2/3 cup light corn syrup, 2/3 cup dark corn syrup and 2/3 cup sugar.  Then on the top I use 2 cups chocolate chips melted with 2 tbsp veg. oil  (personal preference not using butterscotch chips) Yummy!!

My family has been making this for years.  However, we substitute 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of syrup.  They are very moist and chewy and never get dry.

Awesome!  Made it for lots of family at Thanksgiving and they were gone.  I doubled the semi-sweet choc. chips because we aren't into butterscotch and the kids and adults loved them.

I love this recipe. My family has been making this for years!!! Wouldn't change a thing on it, but like another reviewer said, sometimes I don't even use the butterscotch chips and they are still wonderful!
