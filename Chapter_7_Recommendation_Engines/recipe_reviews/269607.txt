These are okay. They definitely have to much butter. The cookies leave wet marks on your hands when you pick them up. I'd also recommend baking them for a couple more minutes.

Good flavors! Makes 2 bigger cookies. I would cut back the butter just a little next time and increase the cook time in a bigger oven.
