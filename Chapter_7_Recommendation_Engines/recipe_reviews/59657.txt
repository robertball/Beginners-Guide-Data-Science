Very easy to make and I find it delicious, although I did change the recipe a little. I sauted diced ham and onion with some garlic, then added it into the mixture. I didn't have enough spinach or ricotta cheese, so I added two more eggs. Then I topped off the pie with green onion and some cheddar cheese. It tasted great. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I decided to try out this recipe when I needed to use up a large amount of fresh spinach.  It was a good choice!  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.

Here are the changes I made:  I added 1 tablespoon of onion powder and some minced garlic.  I shredded one cup of sharp cheddar cheese and used this as a topping.  Broiling the pie for the last five minutes ensured that I had good browning of the cheese.  I think the sharp cheddar cheese and the onion powder made all the difference!

I've never made quiche before and this was great to cut my teeth on. The only thing I regret is following other recommendations to add garlic. For me, the peppers and onions made a sweet and delicious addition. The garlic was a completely dissonent note

This was delicious, and it could not have been easier!  I did use frozen spinach (squeezed) and added some chopped green onions (just trying to get rid of them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Some people mentioned that it was bland, maybe I was just generous with the spinach, but I did not find it to be so, and that is usually my first complaint.  I also almost always add garlic, but I resisted this once, and I'm so glad I did! mmmm spinach!

I tried this recipe once and loved it so much I layered it in between noodles and tomato sauce for a really good spinach lasagna.  It was a great vegetarian alternative to turkey, and my Thanksgiving guests loved it!

I used feta and garlic cream cheese instead of ricota. It was delicous. Will cook again.

Added at least 1tsp paprika, 1/2 jalapeno, full cup (not just 1/2 cup) red pepper, and about 1/4 cup onion. Excellent flavor, but took about 2x the time to cook (about 1.5 hrs) @ 350 degrees.

Totally delicious.  I didn't have red peppers, and I put in some onion and garlic. My kids loved it too. So easy!! I made it without a crust too.

This was so flavorful! I sauteed onions, garlic, & mushrooms to add to it, added salt & pepper and used cottage cheese in place of ricotta cheese. I also added 1/2-3/4 cup of mozzarella in it and again on top in last five minutes of baking.

This was a great dish although I did change it quite a bit! I fried mushrooms and onions instead of the pepper and I used loads of spices- black pepper, paprika, garlic powder and salt. Was absalutely delicious and already almost finished!!!!

Made it for dinner and then enjoyed it again the next morning for breakfast.  Really enjoyed the full spinach taste.  I didn't have a red bell pepper so I sliced up some green onions and saut√©ed them up and added to the mixture, following what someone else did.  I also only had a 15oz container of ricotta cheese, so that's what I used. It cooked in 45 mins for me. My daughter and I both enjoyed it!

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted pretty good also. I added a little mozzarella cheese and cheddar since I had a little extra in the fridge to use up. My husband had a good idea he thought that salsa or hot shot would go good with it.

I defrosted approx. 12 oz. frozen chopped spinach and drained it, added 1 TSP. minced garlic & used 1 15 oz. container of Ricotta. Was short on time and nuked it on power level used for eggs to get it started and then finished in oven. Worked just fine and will add diff. meat & veg. ingredients suggested by other reviewers the next time. I will definitely try this as a lasagna layer. A keeper! and thank you to CANDLELADY9AH

not too bad as a starting point - i used only a 15 oz. container of ricotta and added some milk to thin the mixture.  also used garlic, onion, a little dry mustard and some salt and ground pepper.  probably didn't need a recipe to make this in the first place.

This was good, but wouldn't really call it a quiche. You really must enjoy ricotta cheese to like this pie. Next time I make it, I will add some shredded cheddar rather than the parm. Warmed marinara sauce makes a nice garnish when serving.

What a great recipe for my arsenal of Low Carb side dishes, and great presentation for company.  As someone else mentioned, hubby can't do bell peppers, so sauted a chopped med onion to replace the peppers.  Ended up baking it almost an hour to really set it up, but we loved it!  I think the only thing I might add the next time is a little black pepper to the onions while I saute them to enhance flavor.It is a bland dish, but was yummy with ham steaks since they were salty!  Thank you SO much!  OH, and my daughter thinks it would be pretty with a little cheese sauce on it, that would be good too!

I made this as an entree. It was good but very rich, and I feel like the texture leaves a lot to be desired. The pie would benefit from the addition of some garlic or garlic powder at the very least...Overall, I thought it was okay, but, while my husband would not openly admit he didn't like it, he picked through it to eat just the spinach. Sits heavy in the tummy too - but I should have known!

I changed this a bit. I added 1/4 onion and sauteed the red pepper in a bit of butter and then added the fresh spinach.  I also added some salt and pepper and nutmeg.  I cooled this in the pan and then poured the ricotta mixture over.  It was really good and tastes much better than the average spinach quiche.  I would serve this with some tomato basil soup and a salad.  It doesn't rise very much but has a lot of flavor. I had leftover ricotta cheese to use up.

I had a lot of ricotta cheese looking for a home and this recipe looked interesting. My only regret was not looking at the reviews before I started cooking. Had I done so, I would have been much more generous with my spicing.  While I did add some seasoned salt and powdered garlic, I was much too stingy so the resulting dish was quite bland. I would, 
however, make it again.

I didn't have ricotta so I added 2 cups cottage cheese, 1/2 c lite sr cream, and 1 c feta cheese. I increased eggs to 6  and I baked it in 2 deep dish shells and topped with cheddar for colour. So good!

Very good but needs salt, pepper onion or garlic powder.
