Made as written. Surprised at amount recipe made. Was sorry to dump bean gravy down the drain but did so anyway. Very tasty dish and will definitely make it again. Keeping ingredients on hand is worth while.

Delicious! Made it to go along side a smoked tri-tip & grilled corn. I followed the recipe except that I mixed the beans into the quinoa at the end. It’s so good and there’s so much left that we’re making enchiladas for the left over beans & quinoa tomorrow night.
