Nothing wrong with these ingredients!  Unfortunately just tossing some rosemary on to the chicken did nothing to flavor it. The lemon came through nicely, but the sprigs of rosemary simply dried up and blackened.  I love fresh rosemary with chicken, and perhaps chopping up the leaves and marinating with the rosemary, garlic and lemon would build the flavor I'm looking for.  I'm also thinking that using these ingredients in a compound butter and then rubbing under the skin would be an awesome way to infuse more flavor.

Delicious! I used all bone-in breasts and 2 chicken legs for the little guy. These came out very moist and tender. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used some dried. This also made great pan juices. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to use an extra lemon to squeeze the juice on the chicken before baking to get a better lemon flavor. Made a great dinner tonight...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I just made this today. I used bone-in chicken breasts and dried, instead of fresh, rosemary since I had none. I stopped the cooking at 40 minutes since breasts have a tendency to over-bake and dry. It came out delicious: tender, juicy and very flavorful! This is a prime example of recipes that I love-quick, easy, simple ingredients, and tasty results.

Great recipe! Made it for a graduation feast back in High School for my club. Scaled the recipe up to accommodate about 60 people and I used whole chickens sectioned, had a light layer of olive oil to the bottom of the pan and applied the rosemary lightly all over, And very finely minced the Garic, and layered the lemon slices evenly on top as well as the onion slices. I also included carrot and celery with it and it turned out great, Amazing flavor and if you cover it and roast it in a convection oven it melts in your mouth, definitely recommend this recipe.

The whole family loved this (husband and toddler included). I agree with other reviewers to keep the chicken skin side up for crispness and to season under the skin. I increased the salt to help give the chicken more flavor. Also, I added cut up new/red potatoes and quartered Brussels sprouts. This will definitely go in the meal rotation!

Quick question....I already know this recipe will taste great but am wondering what to do with the garlic cloves. Are they left whole or crushed, etc? I could do it the way I think it should be but would like to make it the way it was intended. Thanks for the help!

Yum! Used two large bone in chicken breasts. I added a little white wine to mixture. Cooked in convection oven at 425 for 40 minutes, turned off oven and left in for 5ish minutes to keep warm while I made rice and broccoli and the chicken was perfectly done. Next time I'll make a gravy from that delish pan juice.

This was awesome - followed the recipe exactly; it was so delicious!  I made it with both thighs and boneless chicken breast.  Both were good but next time I would make it with just the breasts - we found that it absorbed more of the flavors better than the thighs.  As an added bonus, the house smelled wonderful while this was cooking.  This is a keeper.

This turned out great. It was simple. I put some  the ingredients under the skin of the chicken leg quarters that I used, and laid the lemon slices on the bottom of a glass 13 x 9 dish. Delish!!!

Delicious and easy recipe! I smashed the garlic cloves with the flat of a kitchen knife. I also sliced the lemon really thin to let the juice out. Next time I will leave all the skin sides up to crisp better.

Wished could give it 10 stars.  Followed the recipe exactly, except to sprinkle the mixture with 1 teaspoon of Greek seasoning & adding quartered red potatoes.  This is a definite keeper in my recipe file.  Thank you.

This dish was perfect just the way it was. I did use a deeper pan to cook the chicken, thinking the juices would overflow a cookie sheet-type pan. The chicken turned out moist and flavorful. I used the breast meat for chicken salad the next day, which worked out great, too. A big hit!!

Loved how this chicken turned out! Very tender, full of flavor, and super easy to make. I used 2 large boneless breasts, each cut in half,and 3 bone-in thighs, used 2 lemons and placed them directly on top of the chicken, and cut the garlic cloves into large chunks. I only had to cook for 30 minutes. The fresh rosemary is fabulous. Next time I will cut up some zucchini and summer squash and throw it in there! I served with rice pilaf. This is a new family favorite!!!

Although it needs a bit more salt this is very good. Have recently discovered how tasty roasted/grilled citrus is. You can also add regular or sweet potatoes to the mix.

I used boneless chicken breast cooked at 350 for 20 min (10 each side). I added a little fresh lemon thyme to the mix. Served with garlic roasted potatoes and broccoli. Dinner was amazing and loved by all. Sorry no pics, forgot to take them.

Made this for the family and it was a huge success! I added a bit of Latin flair marinated the Chilean over night in some Goya mojo marinade, seasoned with adobo and sazón as well. I used dried rosemary since I didn’t have any fresh handy.

This has always been a favorite of mine since childhood, my mother would make many variations of it with different herbs and vegetables.  It was also one of my go to recipes when I was a young bride about a hundred years ago.   I always started out with a whole young, fresh chicken or two if we had company.
Rinse the chicken inside and out, remove giblets and backbone, cut up chicken into ten pieces, rinse again, put in a bowl, cover and refrigerate.  About a half hour before roasting add the lemon, garlic, fresh rosemary, White wine and olive oil and re-cover.  When the oven is preheated spread out the chicken in a roasting pan.  Add the Onion (in 6ths), one or two red potatoes cut in large chunks, half way through the roasting time add about 1 1/2 doz cherry tomatoes and black olives this add a lot of color and if I have it, I'll slice a half of lemon thinly and add that too.  I like to serve this on a bed of Arugula.  The pan juices make enough of a dressing so salad dressing really isn't needed.  This is such a very pretty dish and very easy.  (hint: never marinate chicken for longer than a half hour, the breasts will turn to mush). Just serve this with a good Sour Dough and plenty of wine ( I like a red with this dish).

Very good and easy recipe!  I would add more lemon and squeeze the lemon in the marinade.

I always adapt and adjust a recipe once I have tried it for the first time. This one is simple and stands up as an easy and flavourful dish. Will make it often.

More like 4½ stars. Or  4¾.  4&7/8? Tried it once, simple, superb. Making it again now, adding sliced oranges just for the helluvit.

*Note: The added orange slices were OK I guess, but the recipe was better as is with just the lemon. I was a little generous with the amount of lemon and rosemary and garlic, that's how I like it.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was the juice of another lemon before baking and half a lemon afterwards (it was left over from a lemon vinaigrette). Made mushroom risotto as a side dish and it was a good compliment! Delicious!

This turned out ok but was lacking in flavor. I was really excited that I had found a recipe to use the fresh rosemary that I had on hand but I hardly tasted it at all. Chicken was nice and juicy though.

Delicious. Making it again for the second time. Used skinless chicken thighs. Only change I made was used dry rosemary and added potatoes. Made rice on the side.

this is a favorite in our house! I use thawed chicken breasts we get at Costco for 25~30 minutes and add oregano and just a little thyme, there are never left overs! The boys love it and so do I!
