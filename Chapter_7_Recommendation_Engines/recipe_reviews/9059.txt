We double the recipe and exchange one of the cans of cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken to give it added flavor

I thought that the bad ratings were being pretty harsh considering all the great reviews that this recipe received, so I decided to try it.  To my disappointment I kind of agreed with the negative reviews more than the positive ones. The smell of the dish is very difficult to handle, I just kept thinking it's going to taste wonderful, so we'll get past this smell,  but it didn't happen.  It left a bad after taste in our mouths and actually, not a very pleasant first taste. My husband said it was alright, but he wouldn't recommend us trying it again. Maybe I did something wrong in making it, I was pretty sad that it didn't work out, I was excited about trying a new recipe.  Oh well, maybe next recipe will be better.

Excellent Recipe.  This was a very easy and delicious supper, that looked like it came from a restaurant.  I doubled the chicken and sauteed it in garlic butter.  I will make this frequently.
Thanks Brenda!!

This is terrific and easy!  I added more chicken (1 pound total) because I want more protein in my family's diet.  I also added more broccoli (2-3 cups total) to make this a complete, one dish meal.  The kids loved it!

Pretty good.  I used frozen chopped broccoli and it turned out fine. With the mushroom soup, I don't think it tastes like true alfredo sauce, but we liked it anyway.

Delicious!!! I stir fried the chicken with butter and garlic too. My husband is picky and he really liked it as well. I also used the parmesan cheese in a can. Sometime I'll try using the real stuff. I'll definitely make this again.

My husband said it was very good and I should make it again.  Very easy to prepare.  Added extra salt, garlic and a little pepper to spice up the taste some.  Worked out well.

Great dish! Easy! I did not have any broccoli so I used diced pimentos.  Gave it a nice color.  I also used penne pasta and fresh parmesan cheese.  My husband says it's a "keeper". Thank you.

I'll stick to my old fashioned sauce of 1 stick butter, 1 pint heavy cream and 1 cup parmesan cheese and just add broccoli to that.

This was pretty darn good, and I loved how easy it was. I did make some changes. I used cream of chicken and doubled the sauce. I also added garlic powder,crushed red pepper, lemon zest and a little lemon juice. Hubby complimented me three times and had seconds, I guess that means it's a keeper.

I sauteed garlic with butter and olive oil and added sliced red peppers, then added the chicken.  I used cream of broccoli soup for a change of pace and used penne noodles.  Also, I added in a some freshly grated pepper.  The sauce was very tasty.  We loved this and definitely would make it again.

Tried this earlier and sure it's fast and easy to make but this flavor is what you would expect from just canned soup mixed with Parmesan.Nothing too special but if you need an easy meal,I guess it's ok but I would probably save my cream of mushroom soups for pork chops.

Pretty good when you saute some onions and garlic in butter first and then add the chicken.Not anything fancy, but a good cheater way to make alfredo quickly!

I used linguine instead of Fettuccini and seasoned it with black pepper.  Next time I will season the chicken before frying with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder and Mrs Dash for chicken.  All in all very quick and tasty.  I will make again!!!

I really liked this one.  I ended up having to make a few modifications since I didn't have anything on hand but it was easy and turned out great!  A surprisingly good dish for such simple ingredients.  Definitely a keeper for when I'm not feeling like making my alfredo from scratch.  I highly suggest fresh zucchini to go with (or replace) the broccoli.  It really added to the dish in my opinion.

I dont like it.  ITs boring.    This recipe is useful for eating by yourself or a quick lunch that you'll defrost.  I would not serve this or call it gourmet by any means.   If I decide to make it again, It will be my "thrifty" food to tend to my hunger.

this alfredo is really not like an alfredo at all, just a white sauce.  the mushroom smell is a bit overpowering but it wasn't bad tasting.  not what i was expecting because it really doesn't taste like alfredo, but it's not terrible.  it tastes vaguely like a side dish my mom used to make with an old Campbell's recipe.

SUPER EASY and DELICIOUS. I tried this one last night and even my 2 year old said mmmm! I did shorten the already quick cooking time by using pre-cooked chicken and frozen broccoli which I cooked with bow-tie pasta.

Loved it!  Put my own spin on it - deleted chicken, added fresh mushrooms, used 1/2 can of cream of mushroom AND 1/2 can cream of chicken.  If you want this to tase more like an actual alfredo sauce, use lots of fresh ground pepper and add a bit of nutmeg - that'll do it!  Yum yum.

Not bad - it needed ALOT of extras to give flavor.  I can't imagine how it would have tasted if I hadn't sauteed the chicken with LOTS of garlic and added garlic powder and ground pepper to the soup mix.  I still found it sort of bland.  I'll try again - with more seasonings and even more garlic.

Skipped the parmesan.  Loved the cream of mushroom soup idea and added Classico brand Alfredo sauce and a little milk b/c that's what was on hand.  I just wanted to "soup' up a store bought sauce I had and this did the trick!  Now I will make it like this every time!  Also added spices to chicken as it cooked for extra flavor.

This is perfect for a fast, easy-to-make dinner and when you're craving the creamy Alfredo sauce.  My husband isn't much of the Alfredo sauce eater but he'll eat this dish when I make it!  You may want to adjust the milk and parmesan cheese portion to thin out the soup sauce.

I love alfredo and so does my family. Without the cream, the taste just wasn't Alfredo. It was one of those dishes where the first bite was ok but as I kept eating,it wasn't.

Made this yesterday and it was wonderful! The only thing I did differently was that I added a bit of pepper and garlic and marinated the chicken in pepper and garlic powder for a few minutes.  This was really tasty and other than that, didn't change a thing. Not sure why negative reviews are so harsh, they must have done something wrong or skipped a step that was key because you can tell that even if I didn't add garlic, this STILL would have been really tasty!  I never liked this dish till I came across this recipe. We loved it, and for us it's a keeper.

This turned out AWESOME!!!  Easy!!!  As good as anything I have had in any italian restaurant.  I was skeptical, thinking nothing this easy could be this good, but I was wrong.

it kind of reminded me of my mother's version of beef stroganoff, with a few changes.  
i did not use chicken, instead i added mushrooms, yellow onion and fresh garlic.  i had it over linguine pasta.  topped it with a little more parm and fresh parsley.  pretty tasty~

VERY Good. I used whole-wheat fettuccine and the sauce covered the strange taste and texture (haha). I also added A LOT of sauteed fresh garlic with the chicken, and I don't think it would have been nearly as good without it.

I found this really good!  For all the people out there that said it was tasteless or whatever, if you have ever made real alfredo you know what goes into it.  So make changes to this base recipe accordingly! I added a bit of sour cream, chopped mushrooms, salt, pepper and lots garlic.  I also used cream instead of milk.  This was Delicious!

This is a great quick recipe.  I will def make again!!  I did change a few things though, some on purpose & some because it is what I had handy.  I sauteed approx 4 cloves of minced garlic, salt & pepper before adding the chicken.  I also increased the amount of broccoli to 3-4 cups, and substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom-it is what was in the house.  I also used a mixture of fresh asiago cheese, and canned parmesan-also what I had on hand.  My brother and father both said it was a good dinner.  Not low-fat, but I will make this again.

I thought this was pretty good, but I changed the recipe so it would taste a bit more like the classic alfredo.
First, I doubled the meat & sauteed it in butter & minced garlic (2-3 cloves), and then added in sliced mushrooms.
Next, I used only half the soup and used heavy cream instead of milk, and then added in 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese. This helped with thickening & taste. And, just a dash of tobasco or pinch of red pepper flakes gave it a teeny bite.
Last, I steamed the veggies separately (broccoli, cauliflower & baby carrots) until al dente and added them in after the noodles to the sauce. 
Good & easy basic recipe, it just needed a bit of help, and of course... love! :)
**As a note, if you add 1/4 white wine to sauce to simmer it would taste even more authentic.**

It was alright... edible but I will not make this again. I would not recommend mixing the broccoli in with the noodles to boil. Actually I think I would serve the broccoli as a side dish.

I cooked this tonight and it was not good. It was edible but it tasted like soup with chicken, pasta and broccoli like a previous review stated. I should have listened to them. I will not make this again. I am used to eating meals with more taste and seasoning.

Blecch! This recipe would taste better if it used a cream base rather than a cream-of-mushroom base.  Although it tastes OK when made, as leftovers it keeps poorly and ends up smelling bad. This dish is bland and the mushroom flavor does it more harm than good.

This is a super good and quick dinner!  I have been making it for a few years, but I lighten it up a bit.  I use chicken tenders, lowfat milk, 98% fat free cream of mush, cooking spray in place of butter, and add 2 tbls of light sour cream for extra texture.  I usually end up with an extra sprinkle or 2 of the parm, as well.  My kids are soooo picky, and they come back for 2nds!!!

This was a really good quick and easy meal.  I doubled the recipe and used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken.  I sauteed some onion and fresh mushrooms along with the chicken, and also addded a splash of white wine.  Hubby loved it!  Next time I make it, I might try some sliced olives, roasted red peppers, or some more fresh veggies to go along with the broccoli.  I loved this recipe because it was similar to alfredo sauce without all the fat and calories.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

This was really easy (I rushed home with only about an hour to make dinner and managed to make some garlic toast too!) and really good!!!  I doubled the broccoli and chicken and added some fresh pressed garlic to the butter when I sauted the chicken.  I did have to add another splash or two of milk but it really was excellent.  Next time I plan to add some fresh shrimp to the saute.

Very good and simple to make.  I added sauted diced garlic and baby carrots.  To heighten the flavor and make it much easier, when I made this the 2nd time I used a jar of alfredo pasta sauce and added some Gourmet Garden Garlic Blend Cream that you find in the refrigerated section of the grocery store near the sour cream.  I also blackened by chicken by seasoning the chicken pieces with blackened seafood cajun seasoning and flash grilling them.  This was good.

My husband the picky eater loved this.  I enjoyed this because it was easy to make which is important to a mother of 3 who are under 3 of age.  You can also substitute any dry pasta that you have at home.  I didn't have fettuccine like I thought.  Remember to season with salt and pepper.

This was really yummy!! I had to tweak just a bit, I added 3 cloves minced fresh garlic to the melted butter and used some heavy cream instead of milk, only because I had on hand and needed to use it up.  Very quick and satisfying meal.

As someone who always needs to "kick things up a notch" with extra seasonings of some sort, I'm so surprised to see how many people felt this needed something extra. After a little salt and pepper, it was just delicious. I wouldn't be opposed to sautéing some garlic with the chicken sometime, but that defeats the point, which is an incredibly easy and tasty dinner you can prepare in little time.

This was fabulous with these changes: heavy cream instead of milk, seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning before cutting up, saute the chicken in butter and olive oil (per another reviewers suggestion) with a teaspoon minced garlic, and added salt and pepper and I didn't have fettuccini so I used rotelli. Absolutely wonderful. My husband and I went back for seconds but couldn't finish because we were so full!

This was ok, but kind of bland.  I had to add some salt at the end.  It helped but it still needed something.  Wasn't bad, but I probably won't make again.

I lightened this up by using half the pasta (vermicelli) and nearly tripling the chopped broccoli. I also took others' advice and threw a big garlic clove in with the chicken. It came out super creamy and delicious. My kids inhaled it. A keeper!

This was pretty good.  It was fast and easy.  I did what some of the others suggested.  I added more chicken, more broccoli, and garlic powder.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

Pretty good,  A nice easy dinner. It was a little bland. I also cooked the chicken with lemon juice, oregano, garlic, Lawry's seasoned salt and vegetable oil.

Pretty good, I've made it a few times.  It's not as good as a real sauce, but this is a much healthier option.  This recipe is from the Campbell's can...

Good stuff!  My husband got home from work late, so it got kind of cold and thick before I was ready to serve it.  I just added a little more milk and cheese and reheated it right in the skillet...worked out great.

Tasted good and was easy to make.  Used 2 chicken breasts and added more cheese.  Next time, I will add more broccoli and some spices to give it a little more flavor.

Negative reviews be darned. I've been making this specific recipe for over ten years. It was the first recipe I ever saw on here and became my go to "new boyfriend first dinner recipe". I have had people beg me for this Alfredo time and time again and it has never failed to impress. I now make it for my Husband who loves it as long as he doesn't have to see it being made because, yes, it looks odd in the pan until it thickens up. I sprinkle paprika on it at the end as a garnish. 

Thank you Brenda!!!!

I REALLY modified this recipe! I doubled the chicken, butter and pasta. I use 2 heads/bunches  of broccoli. Then I tripled the milk and cheese. I like it creamy! Plus, I use 3 cans of the combo cream of chicken and mushroom. I also added some lemon pepper to the sauce and I used an Italian blend of cheese instead of the grated Parmesan. It came out great!!!

I like to used gorgonzola rather than parmesan in my alfredo sauce. Marcella Hazan said to use only the best freshest gorgonzola and to let it soften. I freeze it and use a grater just because it's easier to handle. I also used cream of chicken rather than cream of mushroom. Usually I make my own bechamel sauce, but I was lazy and I had an extra can of cream chicken on the shelf. And, yes, this comes up as a Campbell's recipe.

Just made this for dinner, my kids loved it. The only changes I made was leaving out the butter (We didn't miss it). I also used 1 large Can of Chicken instead of cooking and shedding the chicken which cut down on the prep and cook time. I bet this would taste really good with asparagus too. Really fast, really good dinner.

Used high fiber pasta instead to make it healthier, and used mushrooms instead of broccoli.  I also sauted 2 thinly sliced green onions with the chicken for a couple of minutes before I added the rest of the ingredients.  Added great flavor and a wonderful green color.  With the addition of garlic and pepper for flavor, it was amazing.   It's not exactly fettuccini but it still tastes great.   Put parmesan cheese on top to serve.

This is a family favorite in our house now!  Love this recipe!  Only change I make is I switch up the pasta and sometimes add shredded cheese and use a touch less of the Parmesan!  I also add garlic and Italian seasonings when I saute the chicken.  So YUMMY!  Try this... you wont be disappointed!

My daughter made this meal and wanted to type up the review:    I am 15 years old, and it was a quick and easy meal for me and my sister to make for my family. My father doesnt EVER eat broccoli and he FINALLY ATE some. I will most definitely make this meal for my family again!  Scrumptious!  Oh yeah, I added salt, pepper and garlic powder...it was so yummy!  We made garlic bread on the side.  I can't wait to make this again! Thanks for the recipe!  DB

I used an organic cream of muchroom soup which was not condensed so I omitted the milk.  Flavor was good.  I would double the broccoli; 1 cup was not enough for us.  I would also add the Parmesan cheese on top rather than stirred into the sauce as someone else mentioned.  (Makes the pan a lot easier at cleanup.)  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic with Smart Balance "butter" to saute the organic/free range chicken.  I steamed the organic broccoli for only 2.5 to 3 minutes in a steamer basket on top of the boiling pasta; I did not add it to the water.  That left it "crisp/tender".  Nice idea to use the soup for a lighter version of Alfredo.

Made this for my "picky" family and it was a hit. Used angel hair pasta, added parsley for some extra flavor. Was very good and as a busy mom of four, super easy and fast. Loved how easy it was to cook. Will definately add this to the "busy nights" file.

This was delicious. I made enough to feed an army, and my mom and I nearly finished off the whole thing! Instead of linguine noodles -because we don't have any - I used egg noodles and omitted the parmesan (we put this on top when it was hot instead so we could balance out the taste to our likings). Added mushrooms and a dash of salt for flavor, but this was seriously good.

5 stars for simplicity, but I needed to zip it up a bit.  First, I cook the chicken in olive oil rather than butter and add fresh garlic, pepper, and a touch of salt.  I double the recipe and now use 1 can of Cream of Broccoli Soup and 1 can of Cream of Chicken Soup.  I mix them with the milk and fresh Parmesan before adding to the pasta.  I steam broccoli and cauliflower to crisp tender rather than adding to the pasta water (personal preference).  I also add some sliced red pepper for color.  My kids love it, and that's what matters to me!  Thanks!

This is a completely tasty weeknight dinner.  This recipe came together so easily, and was soooooo tasty.  It happened I had chicken tenders marinating in olive oil, garlic and Italian seasoning in the fridge, they had been in that mixture for about 24 hours, left over from another recipe, and that was the only change I made.  Very satisfying and so, so yummy!  My kids approve.

this is a good basic recipe but it looked a little bland to me. i added some herbs and spices to my chicken and some garlic to my sauce to spice things up a bit. the recipe is pretty flexible, try some different combinations.

Okay my new girlfriend is REALLY picky about the foods she eats so for our first dinner i let her decide the menu.  She picked broccoli Fettuccine Alfredo.  Even being in the culinary field I never did much with Alfredo's because I am not normally a fan of them.  But i must say I followed this recipe exactly and we both absolutely loved it!  She brought some home and didn't even get to eat it because her parents stole it and ate it.

I needed an alfedo sauce recipe and didn't really have the right ingredients.i didn't add any chicken or broccli. I used this as a base and add 1/4 cup each cream cheese and sour cream, and a little garlic powder and parsley.  I tossed it with spaghetti and served it as a side dish at dinner party. hubby said it was good.

As written, this recipe is OK. Doctor it up and you've got a keeper! I season the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and saute it in olive oil. Then I add the mushroom soup and milk. Cream would work well too. Then I add seasonings to the soup mixture, until the taste is just right.

I made it without the broccoli, and I sauted fresh garlic for about a minute before I stirred in the chicken to saute.  I was amazed at how easy, fast, and tasty it was.  It didn't seem like a typical cream soup recipe.

Great recipe!  I did modify it a bit.  We didn't have any milk since my husband finished it before I got home.  So I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and it turned out great.  You might want to use some milk if you like a thinner sauce but we like our sauce thick. I also used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic instead of plain and sprinkled some italian seasoning on the chicken while sauteing it. My husband has requested this as a weekly meal!

Effortless and enjoyable.  I had roasted garlic cream of mushroom, not the plain kind, and it had a great flavor.  I'll be making it again.  I also liked it because it's a lot healthier then a regular alfredo sauce. Feeding my family flavorful non fatty foods is something I try to do, but we like flavor more than healthy.  This wouldn't be on my mother-in-laws diet, (she'd take out everything but the chicken and broc)but it'll do just fine in our home.

VERY GOOD I ADDED EXTRA BROCCOLI AND DIDN'T ADD ALL THE PARMESAN CHEESE. I THINK IT MIGHT BE A OPTION TO ADD CREAM OF CHICKEN AND CHEDDAR CHEESE SOUP.

This recipe was very tasty! I made a couple of substitutions depending on what was in my pantry -- rotini pasta instead of fettuccini, cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and I added some garlic and about a half cup more milk. What I really like about this is that there can be many variations and it's quick, easy, and leftovers taste just as good the next day!

Great quick recipe...was looking for a side dish to use up some fresh broccoli. Made a couple of substitutions...used whole wheat linguini and ommitted the chicken...also threw in a can of mushrooms and about a teaspoon of fresh garlic butter leftover from the night before...absolutely delicious and a big hit with the family!!
Will definately make this again!

This was easy to make, but it was pretty tasteless.  If you're going to make it I'd recommend adding some garlic when cooking the chicken and use fresh parmesan cheese.

I am still learning my way around a kitchen, and this was fast, easy, and I had everything! This never happens! :) I put black pepper on top for a little added flavor. I think next time I make this I'll put more broccoli in it. 

But a great recipe, and way healthier than real alfredo!

This recipe was decent. It needed something else with it. Was quite easy to prepare though.

My family loved this recipe, especially my 12 yr old son. I doubled the recipe, used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken. I also substituted cauliflower for the broccoli and ziti for the fettuccine to save a trip to the store. It was very tasty!

A quick recipe that is easy to make low-fat.  I use half-fat mushroom soup and low fat parmesean cheese.  Yummy!

I used sour cream instead of milk and a cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan cheese which made it a little bit more creamery. Typical way my mother used to make it and served over an egg noodle.

I pretty much doubled everything in the recipe, plus i added a ton of mushrooms (my family loves them) to the sauce as well as a 4-blend italian cheeses.  I put crushed red pepper in it for a little zest and added fresh cut garlic to the sauce.  It turned out delicious!  I highly reccommend!

This recipe was super easy and delicious! I did change it up a little bit. I doubled the recipe, sautéed some garlic and mushroom with the chicken and I didn't have a can of cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken and it came out great. Next though, I think I'll season the chicken. Definitely will be making this again.

I made this recipe just as written. This is NOT alfredo at all which is deceiving. However it's not bad, it is more like a homemade version of chicken hamburger helper with veggies thrown in. It didn't taste bad, or smell bad, and my family liked it for what it was, but we all agree this is in NO WAY chicken alfredo, so please don't get your hopes up. All in all for what it is, its a good quick dish, and if you wish you can make many alterations to it with a pleasant outcome. I will definitely make this again, I rated it 2 stars because the name is deceiving but the food is GOOD.

I haven't made this myself, but my brother has made it for us a few times now, and it's really tasty! And he says it's super easy, which is why I had to find it to add to my own recipe box. As far as I know, he follows the recipe as it is and doesn't change anything.

It was pretty good. My boyfriend liked it a lot, but I did add a couple of things for better flavor. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used Ragu alfredo sauce, but it never really tasted flavorful to me so I added some salt, garlic powder, and a little black pepper. It turned out delish. I've also tried this dish with shrimp and it tastes pretty good too. Overall this is a great recipe!

I used just what I had around the house so I used macaroni noodles instead of fettuccini and frozen peas instead of broccoli.  It turned out really well!  Will make again!

At the last minute i realized i didnt have any parmesean cheese. All i had was a big block of cheddar cheese, so i cut up some thinnn slices and put it in the sauce. It came out delicious...the cheddar was a nice twist..and gave a little kick to the flavor.

This really is very a simple recipe. It does need to be kicked up a notch. I used cream of chicken soup and added lots of garlic and italian spices along the way and some red onion adds a little extra flavor too. The family approved!

THANK YOU!!! The recipe was very simple and yet satisfying after a long drive home for work....and theres more left over for lunch! What more can a 23yr old ask for!! This is my 2nd dish I made for myself. Yes...I'm just learning how to cook. It's sad when my mom moving away and I eat out so much I can't stand another fast-food meal, has finally brought me to do something. Google is my best friend...this site will soon be. No one is going to believe I made this LOL... Oh and I saute my chicken with garlic as well, just as another mentioned..MMMmmmMM...Ciao!

This was great.  I used Green Giant boxed Immunity vegetables.  Broccoli, red and yellow peppers and carrots in a light garlic sauce.  I also added two minced garlic cloves and I didn't have any mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken.  Also I didn't have any fettuccini but I had whole grain thin spagetti.  Came out great and I've got a lot left over.

Excellent way to use leftover roast chicken!  I just sauteed a little garlic with my already cooked chicken, added a little Garlic Salt with Parsley (from lawrys) and it tasted fantastic!

This was so simple!  I had everything I needed!  I used the thin spaghetti I had in the cupboard... but everything else was on the nose!  I tasted terrific!  Maybe next time I'll add garlic... (we love garlic)!

Easy to put together and tasty. I too sauteed a minced clove of garlic with the chicken, and used 1/4 cup of Coffee Cream (Half-and-Half in the US) and 1/4 cup milk for a bit thicker & richer sauce. For 4 servings however, I would definitely consider doubling the sauce ingredients.

good quick basic recipe though I changed the amounts: used a whole package of pasta (12 oz?) and doubled everything else.  The whole family liked it.

I thought this recipe was great. It doesn't taste like 'REAL' chicken al fredo but it is a good substitute. My husband who will eat anything I put in front of him actually looked up and said 'this ain't bad' - a huge compliment from him.

I rated this 5* because for the ease of prep, time and cost involved, it is an excellent recipe.  I added a handful of freshly grated parm and roasted garlic.  I sauted the chicken in butter with garlic salt and a dash of creole seasoning.  The sauce was salty, as all cream soup sauces are, so I did not salt the pasta.  Turned out perfectly and tastes like a mushroom alfredo sauce, not a typical alfredo, which I usually find somewhat bland.  Would also make a great side dish without the chicken.  I will make again.  Yum!

It's hard to really rate a recipe when you have to change it due to allergies, etc.. I had to skip the canned soup and make my own following the creamed soup base recipe on this site due to MSG problems.  I used tri-colored rotini and addeded some garlic powder in the cream sauce.. Very good!

I was looking for a fast and easy recipe for dinner tonight and I found it in this. I did add a little more broccoli and a handful of fresh spinach as well as a generous scoop of premade spinach dip. I also used cream of chicken instead of the mushroom, oh and I added a crushed clove of garlic to the chicken as it fried in the pan. 

I did'nt expect the response from the family, everyone loved it and came back for more! It was awesome. Not the lightest recipe, but we have no leftovers :)

This was just alright. It was very edible, but I will not be making it again this way. I prefer the true alfredo taste which this is lacking. It is worth trying though to see if you like it, and it is definately easy.

I usually rate by my family's reaction.  My husband's reaction was "eh".  However, I didn't have broccoli, which I think would've given it a better flavor.  I did add 1/2 c. of shredded mozzarella and I will do that the next time I attempt this recipe.  It's worth trying again.

To make things simpler...I used NoYokes egg noodles and cooked in the Cream of Mushroom soup...I just added 1/4 can of water. Add the cooked chicken and peas when the soup has cooked down a bit and continue cooking for about 10 mins. Wonderful all in one pot!!

Good stuff!   I added about 1 Tbsp of minced garlic and some salt and pepper to taste while I was sauteeing the chicken.  My 1 and 2 year olds gobbled this down, as did my picky husband.

I thought this was delicious but my family wasn't too crazy about it.  Mine was a little too dry so I think I used too many noodles and they soaked up the liquid.  I prefer to boil my chicken but either way it was good.

We loved the taste of this sauce! I added garlic.  I think I cooked longer due to my noodles taking longer than expected, so the sauce thickened too much.  Either way, I'll def make again, just start my noodles sooner :) Thanks for another great addition to my dinners :)

This recipe was ok.  I only had 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup when I made it, so it probably would have been better with the regular cream of mushroom soup.  It is pretty bland, you do need to add your own flavors to it.  I will try it again.

I love this recipe for its simplicity! I did add garlic while browning the chicken, and spinach when it was all heating together. It turned out great.

Very good.  This was actually quick, and it tasted like I had spent all day cooking.  Definately a keeper.

This recipe is very fast and easy, but the taste just wasn't there. The chicken needs to be sauteed with garlic!
