Wow.  What a big soup indeed.  Not only did my husband offer the unprovoked, "this is the best soup I've ever had," there were clean bowls at the end of the meal- four of them.  The significance?  My children ate vegetables- and liked it. 

First of all, I'm one of these cooks that shamefully can't leave well enough alone and cannot, will not, has not, ever left a recipe as is.  It's not in my genes.  Graciously, Chef John gives us all creative license in his video to waver from the recipe and I did. 

So, let me tell you what I changed, mostly due to what I had on hand and wanted to use  up, and also because I'm pretty sure I was in the wrong grocery store to find "cranberry beans."

I used frozen chopped onions- (I know, but it's what I had) two 14 oz cans diced tomatoes, 1 can small white navy beans in lieu of the cranberries, and a large bunch of romaine lettuce instead of swiss chard and cabbage.  I refused to pay $4.99 for the chard and I forgot to buy the cabbage.  I did throw in about a half cut of large carrot dices that held up well, and fresh green beans cut into 1/2 in pieces.  Lovely.

That being said, everything else I left untouched- except- I did cut a bit of the parm rind and throw it in while it simmered- awesome call.

It was amazing.  We had a beautiful loaf of three cheese garlic bread from our local bakery to dredge up the beautiful sauce between hearty bites.  I will be placing this recipe in my PERMANENT collection, and you should too.

This soup is excellent!  I made as written with the exception of the beans.  I couldn't find cranberry beans and I don't really care for garbanzo beans.  In their place I used light red kidney beans and cannellini beans.  Also, I never cook my pasta in the broth....I always cook it separate and add to the individual serving bowls.  This helps the pasta not get mushy and soak up all of the broth if I want to save some for later or give some away.  If I do give some away, I always give a bag of pasta to go with it!  I will definitely be making this one again.

Excellent dish.  Liked the pancetta and I would recommend adding more to the recipe.  My husband who is Portugese loved this dish and even said his parents would have enjoyed. Grocery store unfamilar with cranberry beans but I looked it up on the internet and now know what they are. John excellect selection of spices as it has the right amount of spicyness.  Highly recommend!

This is a great recipe.  I of course changed it a bit as chef john suggests most people will do.  My changes were I didn't put in any cabbage or Swiss Chard as I don't care for those very much in my soups.  Also the plum tomatoes I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilli's instead.  I am a garlic addict.. so I doubled the garlic... probably will not do next time as it was a little too strong even for me.  For the beans I used red beans, and garbanzo.  Anyway, it was great, loved it and will definitely make it again.  this recipe has earned a permanent spot in my recipe book.

Wanted to make minestrone with what I had on hand, but didn't think I could do it without zucchini and carrots. Then luckily, I ran across this recipe which called for just about everything I had. It turned out fantastic, thanks Chef John! It's my favorite minestrone I've ever made or eaten out. My whole family truly enjoyed it.

I am vegetarian, so I left out the meat and cheese, but added portabella  mushrooms which I sauteed with the celery & onions. Instead of Italian seasoning, I used fresh thyme and rosemary sprigs. I used dried great northern beans, and added the cooking water to the soup which added a lot of flavor. Also, I cooked the pasta separately and added to individual bowls because I didn't want it to get soggy.

The cabbage made the soup really delicious. I used savoy cabbage because that's what I had on hand. And for the first time, my family ate Swiss chard without complaining...success!!!

The soup is just as good using common ingredients like bacon, cannelini beans (or garbanzo), any kind of pasta, etc.  I did find Parmigiano-Reggiano but this is another way over priced ingredient.  Just use the standard shredded Parmesan and it will be just as good.

I thought this was a fabulous recipe and very easy to make.  Of course, I love Chef John's recipe, always flavorful and he allows enough room for individual creativity and diversity with personal flavor preferences.  Here are the few subtle changes I made:  4 ounces pancetta because that is the portion I purchased from Trader Joe's, instead of cranberry beans, I used a can of white beans, instead of a 28 ounce can of tomatoes I substituted 2 15 ounce cans of basil-garlic chopped tomatos, left out the cabbage and used all Swiss Chard.  Lastly, I used 1/2 cup red wine in place of some of the water.  Seasoned to taste.  Thank you again Chef John!

My third time making this recipe--love it.  Easy to adjust, to what you have on hand.  I kept the base recipe the same--chicken broth, tomatoes, onions, carrots, garlic and spices.  I've used black beans, have made it with chard the first time, then with a bag of "greens", which I kept to about 2 cups.  I left out the garbanzo beans and red flakes, as I thought that may be too much. I made it with pancetta the first time, was very good. Second time, I used chicken Italian sausage, to make it a little healthier. Another adjustment--I leave out the water, and as the soup reduces, I may add a little more chicken broth, but that's it.  That's just my preference--I like a thicker, richer soup.  I also cook the pasta separately. Finally, I add some nice grated parmesan---delicious! Thank you, Chef John.

This is a fantastic recipe that is so delicious.  I did not have dried cranberry beans or canned garbanzos; used 2 cans red kidney and one can cannellini.  Chef John's recipes are so good, I stick with what is written if I have everything listed in the recipe.  If not, then substitutions are made out of necessity, primarily.  This time, I did add some fresh oregano and rosemary because it is in my garden and fresh herbs always make recipes so vibrant.  LOVED this soup -- but it makes ALOT OF FOOD!  Oh, I did add 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to the soup -- it's some thing I add to most of my Italian soups and sauces----05/23/16.  I made this again tonight.  Since the last posting, have gone vegan, so used vegetable broth and did not add the pasta because I am avoiding gluten.   This is, basically, a very delicious vegetable soup with cranberry beans.  I added carrots the last 10 minutes of cooking and green beans the last 5 minutes of cooking.  And, of course, fresh rosemary and oregano and a splash of balsamic at the end.  Delicious!

Chef John never disappoints!  I made this soup with turkey bacon instead of pancetta (I can't eat pork), spinach instead of swiss chard and white cannellini beans instead of the cranberry beans specified. Amazing flavor.  Many thanks, Chef.

Was I the only one that bought frozen cranberries for the cranberry beans? LOL! To be honest, that's what attracted me to this recipe, the mistaken belief that it  was some exotic type Minestrone soup that contained cranberries. The soup was delicious, even without cranberries.

This was a good recipe and I'll make it again with a some tweaks. I made the recip as described this time, with only one exception.  I didn't have any cranberry beans, so I used a can of kidney beans. As the recipe notes, you'll need to add quite a bit more water as the soup cooks.  Next time, I'll probably add more chicken broth right from the start and cut back on the salt a little.  I think this would improve the flavor.  The red pepper flakes give the soup a little spice, which I don't associate with minestrone soup.  I like spicy foods, so I didn't mind that, but I might cut back a little in the future. Next time, I'll definitely add a carrot or two and some zucchini.  I might also add a potato. As Chef John says, add whatever you want, but I think these would be good additions.  Overall, I enjoyed this and will make it again.

We truly enjoyed this.  Used fresh tomatoes that were soft so I had to use up.  Only used a pinch of red pepper and that was perfect amount of spiciness.  Since we were allowed to use whatever we wanted I had cabbage coleslaw I had to get rid of and romaine lettuce leaves.  Did not add any beans. Only used chicken broth no water.  It was perfect.

So good and a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies.  The swiss chard makes this soup beautiful.  The beauty of this recipe is that it is forgiving if you omit or substitute some of the veggie ingredients.

Ah, Chef John! You continue to amaze my family with your fantastic recipes! This was incredible!!! I did make a few edits: I hate garbanzo beans and I couldn’t find cranberry beans so I substituted with 2 15 oz. cans of Navy beans. I’m not a fan of pancetta but I love bacon so I used bacon. I added no salt, because the bacon brings enough salt for my taste, and I cut the crushed red pepper in half. I also didn’t add the 4 cups of water, because I like my soups to be more like stews. I served with toasted ciabatta bread and my family devoured it!!! Chef John, you are my go-to guy! When I look up recipes I search “Chef John” and just scroll through your creations. Haven’t had a bad recipe yet!!!

You cannot go wrong with Chef John. All of his recipes that I have tried are wonderful. This is no exception. My husband is a raging carnivore so I doubled the pancetta. I could not find cranberry beans so I used canned great nothern beans as a sub. I was afraid the beans would become mushy during the 45 minute simmer but they held up nicely. Otherwise followed the instructions exactly. The soup was magnificent. I like to wait until soup (or any dish really) is done before adding any salt. I found this soup did not need the salt that was called for (possibly because my canned beans were salted alread). In my opinion, this was more like 8 - 10 servings (not 6 as stated). There were plenty of leftovers and the soup reheats perfectly.

We love the "no rules" way about this soup and prepared the base with celery and onion but being that my husband likes his meats we added a pound of ground Italian sausage (drained and salt amount reduced). We then decided on carrots, cabbage, kale, red kidney beans, cannellini beans and pasta. It was a big bold soup that we served with a crusty garlic bread.

Didn't have pancetta so I used bacon, added carrots more chicken broth than water and added tomato paste in addition to rather than in place of;  I like mine on the robust side. It made 6 quart jars that now reside in my pantry.

I didn't have pancetta, so I put in some home made meatballs towards the end of the cooking.  I didn't have ditalini, so I used small elbow macaroni.  Didn't have the greens mentioned in the recipe, so I used fresh spinach.  Didn't have garbanzos, so I used canned cannellini beans.  Didn't have cabbage, so I used fresh zucchini and green beans. In other words, I accepted Chef John's comment that this is a vegetable soup and you can add any vegetables you want.  It was delicious.

I messed this recip up! I can also give it 5 star's because I tasted it before I ruined it and it was lovely. That said, there are a few things I would do differently to the original recipe. I would leave out the garbanzo beans (yuck) & I would add more bacon because...well it's bacon, yeah? I used bacon instead of pancetta because they did not have pancetta at Walmart.
I was able to find dry cranberry beans but they took much longer to cook that I expected - not sure why -and I used minced garlic from a jar because I had it and bought spinach because they didn't have Swiss Chard . Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I made it the day before because it's always better the next day right?
Now to get to my mess... after tasting the minestrone & finding it lovely, I decided it was a little bland looking. So I went back to the store & bought shredded carrots. I was reheating the minestrone in the slow cooker because I was having a crowd for dinner & didn't want to watch it. I thought the carrots would cook through as it heated. They did not and they didn't really add the color I hoped for so I added frozen corn - not a good choice - then I had some chicken I wanted to use up ...you can see where this is going can't you?
 I admit it, I ran amok & ruined this dish. I also forgot to add the spinach. Not one single person even commented about the dish. I will make this again though, lesson learned!

Here's the beauty of Chef John's recipes: when it is important to stick closely to each part, he lets us know. When we can deviate from the recipe based on our preferences or ingredients on hand, he also lets us know. I LOVE this guy!!! I am very experienced in home cooking and have a pretty discerning taste and EVERYTHING I have tried of Chef John's is amazing!!! I don't think you can ever go wrong with him!
This soup was amazing, even though I had no greens. I did have Italian sausage but I think it would be wonderful even without that. Hubby loved it, and we have no doubt that it will be even better tomorrow. ***NOTE: this soup does not freeze well---turns into mush, so eat it up, don't freeze.
Thanks, Chef John! In my dreams I will meet you! Tell wifey, no problem, just want to glean all I can from you! :)

I have only made split pea and lentil soup before, so I was very excited to try this.  WOW!  What a tasty soup this made!  I didn't have Swiss Chard at my supermarket, so I had to substitute collard greens.  I also added a can of red kidney beans.  It was delicious, very hearty and my son and husband loved it!  The only thing I will say was that my soup came out a little salty, but my Italian seasoning I had also contained sea salt (I saw this too late).  I just kept adding water to the soup, and it turned out okay.  I will have to invest in some new seasoning next time around!  That being said, I was really delighted with Chef John's recipe.  Can't wait to try his chicken soup recipe next!! Thanks for sharing!! :)

Very good. Ended up needing quite a bit more liquid. I used 4 extra cups of chicken broth. My fiancé (who doesn't care for soup) commented that this was pretty tasty.

As Chef John notes, this isn't a soup you make the same way twice.  I made it with what I had from the garden, similar to this, but with variations in the veggies.  Just wanted to mention (in case someone else hasn't)unless you're going to finish the soup in one sitting, it's better to cook the pasta separately and add to the soup as you serve it so it doesn't soak up the broth and get huge.

I just started growing Swiss chard this spring. When I saw this soup recipe, I just had to try it. It is so delicious. I pretty much followed the recipe but added sausage and fresh herbs. My husband wanted second bowl! My whole family loves this soup!

I usually don't like minestrone soup that is served at most restaurants and I made this soup at the urging of my husband.  I LOVE this soup.  It wasn't as hard as I thought it might be and it does take some time to make.  I watched the video and I made it exactly like he said (the first time I made it I added too much pasta, but it was still good).  I used the Swiss chard as listed and although I don't think I had ever had Swiss chard before it really added to the dish.  I have and will make this soup again in the future.

I really like this recipe and the way you encourage variation of ingredients in your explanation. I've made it several times, always using the proportions as instructed but varying the ingredients to what's on hand and it is always very good.

I give this recipe 5 stars plus.  It was delicious.  Instead of pancetta I used pieces of ham that were left over from a ham that I had baked previously. Everyone who tasted this soup said it was the best minnestrone they had ever had!

It was SOOOO good.  One of the best soups I have made.  I didn't use a few things like the pancetta, cranberry beans, swiss chard or pasta.  Trying to make it as low carb as I could.  Used fresh spinach for the chard and pinto beans for the cranberry beans and regular crushed tomatoes.  Didn't bother with extra olive oil and used the good old jar of Parmesan.  I can throw all my other Minestrone recipes out.

L O V E D.  Even better the 2nd night.  Served with LaBrea whole wheat bread.  I don't think it needs the extra fat by drizzling on the olive oil at the end.  I increased pancetta to 4 oz.  Didn't know what cranberry beans were so just used pinto beans which i had on hand.  This will be a staple soup of mine! - CC

My first attempt at minestrone. It was fantastic. I did sub light red kidneys for the cranberries and kale in place of swiss chard, as none of our stores carried it this week apparently...we have found a new household fave. FANTASTIC!!!!

I made a vegetarian version, which is ridiculous I know, but it turned out great. I accidentally poured in a can of plain tomato sauce and then poured in a can of diced tomatoes in an attempted save and it was awesome!

Chef John rocks and love many of his recipes but for me I didn't like it.  My kids thought it was okay but not want it again.  It had a real tomato taste to it like a tomato soup I suppose.  I did follow the recipe to the letter.  I don't know.  We all agreed it was okay but not much of it was left when supper was over!

Using bacon the next time! Also keep some extra chicken broth on hand to add  for leftover meals as the maccaroni soaks up the liquid.  The crushed red pepper seems to heat up the mixture as it sits.  You might want to use a bit less of the peppers, if you're sensitive to hot-spicy dishes.  I doubled the batch to have for a few days. The family enjoyed it, saying it smelled like spaghetti or pizza!

Super delish!! The cranberry beans took a little longer to cook because I had the heat on low. Next time, I’ll crank it up. I did add more water, and approximately 1/2 cup more of crushed tomatoes. I followed the recipe to a T, except I used red chard. If you don’t mind the heat, leave the same amount of red pepper flakes, otherwise reduce it just a bit. I can’t wait to make it again!

Cold, wintry mix Saturday and a pot of this soup simmering on the stove=happiness! Taste tests are delicious! Added a Parmesan rind. Could not find cranberry beans nor Swiss chard at the grocery, substituted great northern beans and lacinto kale. Will try to find cranberry beans and Swiss chard for next time. Thank you for the yummy recipe!

I made no changes. The soup is nice and hearty and adds a healthy addition to our dinners. I'd personally season a bit more. But, I admit I tend to 'season' by sight (without a measuring spoon).

I loved this recipe.  I can eat it every day.  The one thing I would change is the meat.  I liked it, but my wife and daughter prefer veggie only versions of the soup.  I'm good with it.  Bring on the meat. Haha!

The soup was absolutely amazing without the meat and Cranberries I doubled the recipe and added some green beans and a little bit more chicken bouillon to flavor since we skipped on the meat . My seven-year-old loved this he says it was the best meal ever! Thank you so much John

My go-to recipe every time. I only tweak the beans (use canned kidney and cannelloni) and add extra veggies like broccoli and zucchini when I have it. One of my and my family’s favorites!

I made this with whatever vegetables I had on hand.  It was so good and easy.  I was a little salty for my taste so next time I will not add any salt or use tomatoes and broth that have no salt.

Delicious!  Made my veggie version by skipping the pancetta and chicken broth. Used cannellini and garbanzo beans  and spinach instead of chard.  Great meal to welcome the fall season. Yum...

Very good! I did have to change a few things because I didn't have pancetta nor the Swiss Char. So I substituted Bacon for pancetta and spinach for Swiss Chard but it worked out fine. Thanks Chef John!

When I get kale from my CSA, this is always my go-to meal.  I  seem to add or delete veggies based on what’s in my fridge.  The base recipe is awesome.  Never disappoints!! Can’t wait to eat.   ;)

I’m soo happy at how amazing this recipe turned out!!! I am not a big fan of minestrone soup, I like more cream base soups. I made this for my mom and husband who love minestrone soup and they said it is even better than what they get at some of our local restaurants. I used kale instead of Swiss chard and followed other’s advice on using cannellini beans instead of cranberry beans. Absolutely a must for your personal recipe book!!

I've made this soup many times, the only change being that I substitute bacon for the pancetta and use more than called for. My kids love it, other family members love it, and even multiple people that "don't like minestrone" love this recipe. It's a winner. That being said, I love everything chef John does.

As everyone else seems to have done, I made a few changes...left out the meat and changed the types of beans.  I also used kale instead of chard and it held up really well.  It's definitely  going into our regular rotation and deliciously fills one of our biweekly vegetarian nights.

No changes other than adding the rind of cheese as specified by another rater. So good, and perfect for late summer with the abundance of veggies.  Thank you Chef John.

I left out the garbanzos and swiss chard, only put in one 14oz can of tomatoes (crushed) and substituted a pound of ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe and it was a huge hit!!  The leftovers were even better the next day, will definitely be making it again soon!

Followed the recipe exactly minus the cranberry beans as I do not have access to them.  I also made my own pasta.  The soup was just okay, kinda boring.

Modified it a bit for my vegan wife: no pancetta or chicken broth.  Substituted vegetable stock, leeks instead of onions, cannelloni and dark red kidney beans for garbanzos and cranberry beans, baby spinach for Swiss chard. Added merlot wine, fresh chopped oregano, thyme powder to listed ingredients. Turned out fantastic! Will try the chef’s recommendations next time. Just used what I had on hand this time around.

As always, Chef John knocks it out of the park with his amazing recipes.  I could not find the cranberry beans, and we are not big fans of garbanzo beans, so, I added kidney beans instead.  His little touches of olive oil for drizzling and garnish on the top make this Minestrone Soup a home run!!!

Another 5* recipe for Chef John.  The base of the soup is perfect in my opinion.  The additional vegetables, beans, and pasta are adaptive to what you have on hand.  Frozen spinach,  assorted fresh veggies, canned beans ( northern black, kidney, garbanzo ) all worked well.  Family loves this, from 5 to 70 year olds!

Absolutely amazing.  I added lean ground beef to make it a bit heartier and it was perfect! Tasted like something from a restaurant ... only so much better.  Will be making this again for years to come.

This was amazing! I ate left overs for 3 days for lunch! I added a bit more pasta...bc i like the pasta. Couldn't find cranberry beans so i used pinto. I really wish I could have found cranberry beans!! But even with the substitute, this recipe was amazing! And it made my house smell so good!

My local store did not have cranberry beans so I substituted pinto beans.  In the future I would just use canned beans,  it took way longer for the raw beans to cook.  It’s a very flavorful and hearty soup.  Thumbs up for sure!

If Chef John created this recipe,  I knew it would be fantastic,  and indeed, it was a Delicious soup. Substituted fresh spinach(had it in the fridge) for the chard, and finely chopped bacon for the pancetta.  Added some veggies that I needed to use up... zucchini and yellow squash,  bell pepper,  and chopped fresh green beans. This minestrone recipe is a dependable starter recipe to create your personal soup of the day,  while using assorted soup fixings from your refrigerator and freezer.

Made this recipe and followed the ingredient list for the most part (used pinto beans instead of cranberry). I was very impressed with flavor, the cost to make the meal and the amount of soup that was made. Also, You’ll need to add water no mater what. Making this again for sure!

This soup recipe is the best!  It tastes just like my mom made when I was a child. I used ham hocks instead of the pancetta.  There is nothing like soup on a cold and wintry day.??

Absolutely fabulous! One of my new favorites! Changed a few things— only used 1.5 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes, bacon instead of pancetta, spinach instead of Swiss chard (I have that in hand way more than Swiss chard), and I also added some leftover unseasoned beef from taco night! AMAZING!

I made this soup for dinner last nite and it was absolutely delicious! My husband is still raving about this soup and he is a very picky eater/food critic.!  Will definitely make this again but will cut back on the pasta to 1/2 C. I passed this recipe along to my sister as well!

I did not have Kale on hand so just used Cabbage. Also, only had Chili flavored Garbanzo beans so drained them as much as possible and used those with Black beans.  Served with Freshly made croutons and shredded parmesan.  Delicious. and So easy to whip up.

Would be 5 star if I had used spinach or kale instead of chard. Chard too strong and woodsy for me. A truly great soup though

Just based on personal preference and availability, I used zucchini, pintos, and a bit of green pepper rather than green beans, cranberry beans, and chard.  And with some in the family who limit meat consumption, I added some large shrimp at the end rather than pancetta at the beginning.  Anyway, the general approach and seasoning seems right.  Thanks.

Another excellent recipe from Chef John, but watch the amount of red pepper flakes you put in! I used 1/4 to 1/2 tsp for my family, and that amount did not overpower the taste of the soup.

My husband loved it.  Instead of chicken broth I used beef bone marrow and only 2 cups.  I used Canadian bacon instead of pancetta. It was great.

This was a great soup.  I did add some Italian sausage.  Next time I would add more swiss chard.   I was kind of skimpy on it but really like the flavor of it.  This is a keeper and it freezes well.

This soup was Heavenly.  I used cannellini beans as we do not like kidney beans. I found carrots, onions and celery already chopped in my grocery store's produce section.  You can definitely tell when the soup thickens and when to add some water. Do not add any extra pasta, the measurement is perfect.

I did make this and I stuck to most of the recipe. I did not have cranberry beans, but used kidney beans, I could not find any fresh chard, but I substituted romain lettuce and used napa cabbage, I also added sweet Italian sausage. It turned out very delicious and I will make again. Thank you Chef John for your soup.

So many great recipes from Chef John over the years - I have lost track but I made this Minestrone Soup this week and it is excellent.  Used San Marzano Plum Tomatoes and Boars Head Pancetta.  Excellent.

I pressure cooked the beans first. Drained but saved the liquid to use instead of broth.  I then followed the directions but used my IP.  I am vegetarian so used about 2 oz of Morningstar Farms veggie bacon instead of pancetta.  I added all the cooking ingredients and pressure cooked for 5 minutes, let it vent naturally, about 7 minutes, then switched on the slow cook feature on high for 3 hours.  Perfect and beyond belief delicious.

This was amazing! Read some of the reviews and decided to make some adjustments. Added carrots during the sautéing process with the onions and celery. Prior to adding the plum tomatoes, this is where I decided to add the red pepper flakes and tomato paste for a more robust taste and allow the oils from the pepper flakes to seep into tomato paste. Instead of Swiss chard, decided to use kale and added zucchini. Hope this helps others with their Minestrone.

I made this for dinner , followed most of the ingredient list, per what I had, and the taste was amazing. My daughter makes this all of the time, so I decided it was a must try. It did not disappoint. Chef John speaks the truth;you can use whatever vegetables you have, and it will be delicious. I used canned diced tomatoes, cut up green beans, great northern beans, and the three main vegetables for any base; carrots, celery, and onions.  I also added frozen, homemade, uncooked meatballs, for a meaty touch, just a few. It was pure heaven. This will become a main dish soup in our household.

I made this soup omitting the pancetta strictly for caloric reasons.  My husband loved this as did I. He has requested that I make it again.  I did not change anything about Chef John's recipe this time, however next time I think I will try it with spinach.  I was able to find "green chard" which seemed a tiny bit bitter to us.  This is a hearty soup and will be great with some of Chef John;s sour dough bread.

I make this all the time. Stick with the ditalini pasta as it doesn't swell and break up like other pastas,  or....just cook the pasta separately. The reason I make this all the time is that it's actually a great diet food. I can skip breakfast, eat a bowl of this at 10:00 AM and be OK until dinner. It's the right balance of carbs, fats, protien and fiber. I keep the base and switch up the veggies/legumes depending on what's fresh and cheap. Pancetta is best, but ham with a little extra olive oil is a decent substitute.

Wow are there ever a lot of ingredients! In any case, this is a great way to eat vegetables. I will be making this again. Next time I will cook the pasta separately so the leftovers don't get mushy. 
Note: I used canned cannellini beans instead of cranberry beans and omitted the pancetta.

Great recipe.  Made two times in March and will make again.  Family liked it and followed recipe but left out cabbage and used navy beans  and cannellini beans.  Also used spinach for Swiss chard.  Couldn't find cranberry beans.  Soup was still excellent and reheats well.

Of course I loved this soup.  Who wouldn't.  My soup was so thick it almost didn't need thickening by the pasta, but I love pasta so I put in pasta. I don't have a large family so  I find I have to cook pasta separately when using in soups and then combine the two at serving time.  This is the way I put the pasta into this soup too.
There are many possible ingredient variations and I used one or two, but the character of this great soup remained.

Ooo soo good. I substituted and added  here and there. Just a few examples, leftover spring salad mix and cucumber and broken buckwheat noodles. The  seasoning I left in tact, perfect for my family. I absolutely believe the broth is the boss. When you have a good broth, you have a great soup.

I made this with the instant pot and it is great.  Just sautéed all the veggies, added tomatoes, spices, pasta and broth .  Put it on  high pressure for 6 min and then slow release for 8. It was perfect and I dumped a bunch of spinach fresh basil and parsley.  Oh I added more broth at the end.  I used the 6 cups asked for but felt it needed more.  Great recipe

I followed the recipe as written except I used kale in place of the chard and used northern beans in place of the pink beans. Delicious, easy to prepare and will make this hearty soup again. I shared with two friends and both requested the recipe.

Just like the reviews this soup is spectacular. It was so simple. I added 3 tablespoons of corn starch bcz it didnt thicken up enough. I also usedsmall white beans instead bcz I dont like garbanzo beans. I also served it w parmagian crisps. Try this, you will like it.

I loved it!  Big bold soup!  Usually I have to add more salt for flavor but not this one.  I used canned navy beans and garbanzos and that worked great.  It's a keeper!

I used my Instant pot to pressure cook everything but the pasta for about 15 minutes, then added the pasta until soft.  Quick, easy, and hearty! Husband loved it.

I made the recipe exactly as posted. It was wonderful. For the Parmesan, I did throw a few rinds in while it was simmering. 
I thought the taste was very good right after making it and it got better each day afterward. I will make this again for sure. 
Thanks Chef John.

We loved this soup. I did make some changes. I used zucchini instead of Swiss chard and I used red kidney beans and navy beans , I also used bacon.  I would really like to use Spinich in it but as long as my husband is going to eat it that won’t be happening!

Based on the reviews we expected the best Minestrone ever. It was OK, nothing special. We followed the recipe since it was our first time making the soup (except we kept the pasta separate) but is seemed to be bland.

Hearty and tasty.  The first three bites I had to accompany it with water because I'm a sissy and normally can't handle the capsaicin heat.  However, I ate one bowl + half more and live to tell about it.  I know  my hubby & son will love it as one of them sneaked a taste before it was finished and liked it.  I used a can of canceling beans rinsed  instead of cranberry beans.

Very good - loved the flavor!  I omitted the pancetta to keep the cost down.  Next time I will puree one of the cans of beans and add some hamburger to satisfy some of our family members.

Hearty and delicious. I made a double batch which was a large amount. I only changed Swiss chard to spinach bc I knew what spinach tasted like in soup. I didn’t add pasta to soup for it would turn to mush. I served with salad and French bread to complete the meal. It was really good. I live in fl and it’s hard to eat hot hearty soups when it’s 100 degrees out so I made this on a fall day that was 75 out and wasn’t too heavy on the stomach. You can feel good eating this with all the beans and vegetables in it, lots of flavor and minimal calories. I sent recipe to my family to make and I am the taste tester and send only good recipes to others that turned out atleast decent of better. Will make again

Ok, I liked all the ingredients in this soup, however, I can't believe no one mentioned how HOT it is. Cut the red pepper flakes and the salt in half so that it tastes like minestrone.  This soup burned my throats the entire time I was eating eat.

This was delicious!  Taking a cue from Chef John and using what I had on hand, I subbed bacon for pancetta, spinach for Swiss chard, and kidney beans for garbanzo beans.  I also added 2 diced carrots, with 20 minutes to go.  Cooked the pasta separately so it wouldn't be mushy, cut the red pepper flakes and salt by half, and added a glug of red wine.  The result?  Even my picky eater ate it without complaint, and the rest of the family declared it good!  As others have said, this is a "big" soup - and I wouldn't make it spicier or saltier.  It might replace the minestrone recipes with zucchini for me!

Like others, I had to sub something for the cranberry beans because I couldn't find them. I used pinto beans since they were smaller and closely related. I had my doubts about adding dry beans to the mix, and unfortunately, I was right. I cooked it for at least twice as long as it called for and the beans still weren't quite done, but by then I had to quit cooking it because everything else was too done. I'm going to trust that the cranberry beans would have prevented the problem, so 5 stars it is, because it was still very tasty! Just to be safe, next time I'm leaving out dried beans altogether.

Excellent soup! Like another, I used all chard instead of cabbage and chard, and also added a can of green beans. Really wonderful soup and will keep in the rotation for sure.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. I had been craving minestrone that was like the minestrone I had as a kid. This recipe is so flexible but always flavorful. You can replace and add so many different vegetables. I personally prefer carrots over beans and it tasted amazing still. I also didn't add any meat.

No pancetta used.  Used garbanzo and kidney beans, kale for the Swiss Chard, rotini for the pasta.  Didn't care for the parsley garnish.  Used 1/2 of cayenne pepper.....was spicy enough.
Robert seemed to like this, but I thought it was missing something.

This soup is so GOOD! I followed the recipe as is except used kidney beans instead of the cranberry beans. Will make again for sure!

We really enjoyed this soup. I used cabbage, kale, garbanzo beans, white beans, and red kidney beans. I found the pancetta just kind of disappeared into the soup and really didn't add much in the way of flavor, so I think next time I'd add some sausauge or maybe just double or triple the amount of pancetta.  Overall though, wonderful recipe!

Great flavor, tons of vegetables. Make sure you cut your greens very small, as I did strips and it was kind of stringy for some bites...  But, this is a very good soup!

I made the soup according to the instructions however I added one large (diced) carrot and some frozen string beans.  It was delicious!!  I like the bite that the red pepper flakes give to the flavor of the broth. I  will make this again.  Thank you Chef John!

Used Prosciutto.  Need to add much more chicken stock.  Could have been more flavorful.  A bit too thick, and if I added more liquid it would have not had any flavor at all.

I couldn’t find cranberry beans so I used cannellini beans and I also used farfalle pasta because I didn’t know what ditalini was and I was at the store and couldn’t find it.  Other than that, I did the rest the same.  The first night I tried it, I didn’t care for it that much.  I think it was the strong flavor of the pancetta that I had never used in a recipe before.  But I will say that by the 2nd and 3rd days, I was enjoying it very much.  So much so, that I plan to make it again this week.  :)   Thanks for the recipe Chef John

This is the soup that reminds me of my Grandmothers' kitchen. If I could give this a sixth star I would! I've made it twice, and each time varied the veggies a bit depending on what looked fresh at the market. (I've never seen a Cranberry Bean, so I substitute red kidneys). If you're serving this immediately, and expect no leftovers, then by all means add the pasta and let it soak up some of that glorious soup. If, however, you expect leftovers - Make the pasta separately and add to bowls. (After twenty four hours in the fridge, the pasta had soaked up just about all the soup!!). I used Pecorino Romano cheese at the end - Man is this good!!

I made this recipe on the fly and used what I had on hand, this changed it a bit but Chef John wasn't kidding, you can throw almost anything in. I substituted the celery with diced carrots. I had no Swiss chard and no cranberry beans, but the rest of the recipe was basically the same...lots of yummy cabbage. I also used extra garlic and bigger noodles. They said it was "The bomb" and the pot of it was gone in 10 minutes. I will make this again and several versions of it as instructed lol

This is an excellent recipe. It allows you to use what's in your refrigerator. I followed it almost exactly. I didn't have any chard but did have zucchini and carrots so that is what I added. Its makes enough to share or freeze. Make sure you use real parmesan not he one in a can or jar. it makes all the difference in the world.

I ommited the chard, not a family favorite.

The soup is wonderful, paired up with crusty bread, perfect.

This is definitely a keeper.

I simply love Chef John's recipes; I am never disappointed when I prepare his creations! I loved the combination of flavors for this dish. The addition of pancetta was a new twist for me and gave the soup base more body.  Speaking of body I added a zucchini and it blended in really well. This will definitely go into my regular meal rotation but I think I will skip the red pepper flakes the next time. It was a little too spicy for my taste. Overall, excellent!

This was so hearty and delicious! My whole family loved it (event the picky ones). I substituted spinach for the swiss chard and added some sweet potato. I also had to add water to keep it from being too thick (but I do love a nice thick soup). It made a bunch so a future dinner is ready and waiting in the freezer. Will make it again (and again).

I made many changes in that I added kale and lots of other veggies. It smelled divine and the critics rated it divine. It went to the soup luncheon at the church where it mellowed out overnight! I tasted after it was finished cooking and it was good!

Awesome soup! So good and so easy! The only differences I made were- bacon instead of pancetta (only because that's what I had), spinach instead of chard and a can of Romano beans instead of the fresh cranberry ones, no chickpeas and no pasta. With a soup this hearty you don't miss the pasta! An Italian friend of mine taught me the trick of throwing in parm rinds- what a great trick! And so soft and delicious afterwards. I will be using this recipe all fall and winter!

Made this recipe with a couple changes. First, I couldn't find pancetta, so I used regular bacon. I also added a couple of different canned beans in place of the cranberry beans. Other than that I followed the rest of the recipe. It turned out fantastic!! Full of flavor and not too watery, and I ended up having to add water to it. If you like minestrone, try this one! Thanks Chef John!

Best minestrone yet.  Like the other surprised domestic types,  my whole family also cleaned their bowls.  I subbed great northern & kidney beans for the cranberry beans and prosciutto for the pancetta, had to use half bok choy/ half celery. Thanks for sharing,  will make again! !

We had a vegan guest, so we modified the recipe a bit. We all really enjoyed it. We removed the chicken broth, pancetta and Swiss chard. We added vegetable broth, bean sprouts and a little extra pasta to make it a main course.

I even made a couple veggie substitutions and this was wonderful! The only thing I wish I would have done differently would be to flash chill the soup in the freezer right after the noodles were done cooking or take it off the heat while the pasta was al dente. I took the pot off the stove after they were done, but it was still hot enough to over cook the pasta.

Very good. Like the spices.  Haven't made it exactly like the recipe, but I do like the base ingredients for the deep flavors.

This is probably the best minestrone I have ever had.  I didn't have chard, cabbage, or cranberry beans.  I used cannellini beans instead.  I don't think the recipe suffered and will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe for the most part. The only change I made was to eliminate the water and increase the amount of chicken broth. I also added chopped zucchini. Soup turned out wonderful. Was the first time I used Swiss Chard. It is definitely a keeper. Next time I may add carrots and potatoes.

This was a great Minestrone recipe.  Used kidney beans and green beans instead of garbanzo beans. Spinach instead of chard.  Very hardy, did add extra water because it was so thick with vegetables.  Tastes even better the second day!!

love love love this soup, I did make  a few changes  we aren't fans of cabbage, so I used zucchini.  Also my husband loves meat balls so I use this instead of pancetta.  Next time I will make it the same way.

This is the best soup, I did make several changes.  Sauteed the veggies in grapeseed oil and bacon.  I used 2 cups of sweet onions,  8 cloves of garlic, lots of carrots and celery.  I added 3 cups of veggie broth, one cup of chicken broth, and 2 cups of water.  I found dried cranberry beans in the store, so I cooked them in the pressure cooker and then added them to the above mixture.  I added the cabbage, garbanzo beans and the spices per the recipe. I also added a leftover piece of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, as well some left over cooked green beans. Did not add the Swiss chard, didn't have any on hand. I also added a handful of a mixture of very small dried beans and grains I purchased at Trader Joe's instead of the pasta.  Cooked per the recipe.  This soup is to "die for".

This is the best soup that i have ever tasted. Thanks Chef John! I've made it four or five times. I added six diced fresh plum tomatoes and doubled the cabbage. I've used  Swiss Chard, escarole and Red Chard with equally great results.

Wow, this was fantastic! My husband thought it was a little too spicy, but I thought it was perfect. I substituted bacon for pancetta and also couldn't find the cranberry beans, but didn't substitute anything in their place. By the end of cooking I probably added about 4-5 extra cups of water and it still had a great flavor.

This soup was delicious.  Only  thing I did different was I added a pound of grouND sirloin and a large carrot.  I also couldn't find the beans, so I just used a can of kidney beans.  Soooooo good.

I just used a can of Italian stewed tomatoes with a chicken seasoning packet and 2 cups of water with some celery and garlic after 5 minutes of boiling that:  I added kidney beans, garbonzo, beans,  green beans and spiral noodles that I had cooked separately and for an added taste I added chopped jumbo shrimp.

I substituted the cabbage for fresh spinach instead.  I was very good.  Like the other reviewers, I used less expensive beans.  I used a can of light red kidney beans instead of the cranberry beans.

Excellent soup with incredible flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly except for replacing cranberry beans with canned, drained cannelloni beans.  Because we like a stew-like soup, I did not add the water.  This is the new family favorite!  Thanks, Chef John, for another winner.

I was looking for an authentic Italian vegetable soup.  This minestrone was a heart/hearty /healthy soup that tastes great.  
I couldnt find cranberry beans, so substituted  pinto beans. The babykale/chard/spinach blend I found at Sams club worked fine.  I used San Marzano tomatoes which gave a sweeter taste.  Next time I might add a little wine.

The whole thing about minestrone is being able to modify the ingredients to what you have on hand or what you prefer,  but the base of this recipe is spot on.  Some additions to try in addition or instead of what's in the recipe are kidney (cannelloni beans) or navy beans, diced zucchini, crumbled Italian sausage, kitchen cut green beans.  Overall my whole family enjoyed this and it will stay in my Allrecipe file!

This was outstanding.  I loved it.  If your family is sensitive to heat, I would cut the pepper flakes back by half.  The grand kids thought it was a bit "spicy".  Excellent and easy.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for except I was unable to find cranberry beans anywhere. It was delicious but very spicy for my family. Next time, I will use 1/4 t of the red pepper flakes instead of 1 t!! I like it spicy, but my family does not!!! Thanks for this delicious veggie filled soup.

Hubby and I loved this!  Couldn't find cranberry beans, so used pinto beans, and 28 Oz diced tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  (Did use a little less salt, and a little less red pepper flakes.).  Great flavor, and, like most soups, just gets better the next day.  I did not find that the ditalini soaked up too much broth overnight, even though I cooked it in the soup.  It did make a lot ... have eaten 4 big bowls, and still have lots left, but that's not a bad thing!

Really good and super flexible. Used four strips of bacon instead of pancetta, skipped the celery, but added a bit more onion, used canned borlotti beans instead of dried cranberry beans, only a quarter tsp of red pepper flakes, orzo instead of ditalini, and skipped the salt (I did need to add some at the table). Also forgot the parsley. Since I didn't used dried beans I added the pasta with the cabbage and then added the beans when it was al dente (saved a bunch of time this way). Threw in the chard once the beans were warm and turned off the heat. The parm and olive oil really add something. Simple, basic recipe that I will make again. Maybe with sausage next time? Or maybe not.

We loved it!  I substituted pancetta with sausage and as chard is not available I used carrots.  Also used a bit more pepper flakes to make the soup spicier.  Thanks Chef John.  Definitely going to make this again.

Excellent! Followed recipe exactly. The next time, I might leave out the garbanzo beans, just because I think the soup is hardy enough with out it.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made.  I used red kidney beans and cannelini, and I had some spinach, so I skipped the chard this time, but will try it in the future, as it is so pretty and tasty.  Since I used all canned beans and spinach, my cook time was shorter, too.

Excellent soup.  Instead of Swiss chard I used chopped spinach.  The cranberry beans are great.

I have made this soup about 4 times now and every time I make it I am surprised at the flavor. I could just eat the broth alone but adding all of the other yummys makes it that much more exciting. My husband does not like cabbage or beans but he asks me to make this a lot. Funny how you can get them to eat healthy and like it. The red pepper flakes give it a real kick so just know that 1tsp will give it some heat. I Love this recipe

Absolutely wonderful!  My recipe for minestrone soup is getting deleted from my recipe box, because this one is the new replacement. This soup got the best response from my family. All through dinner it was hmmm.
Thank you Chef John, I hope everyone tries this soup. It is a keeper, and the go to. I couldn't find the cranberry beans so I did use cannellini beans in their place. Everything else is spot on in flavor and amounts.  Kat >^..^

This soup was decent. Very hearty and very thick. Be sure to have a giant dutch oven to make it in. This time I put in one italian sausage. Next time I'd like to do 2 or maybe even 3 because the sausage is the best part. I also think it needs mushrooms.
The tomato flavor is pretty overwhelming. I think next time I'll try some red wine to give it a different flavor. All I really taste is tomato and chili flakes.

This was just ok. 2 things to know ahead of time- 1. very salty!! 2 tsp of salt is way to much, 1tsp would have been plenty. 2. This makes a large pot of soup, great for potlucks or big family dinners where you are feeding a crowd.

This soup is delicious.   Well worth the time it took to make it.   I used black beans instead of cranberry beans (which I could not find).  I made it once with pancetta and once with bacon and both times it was just as good.  This recipe goes in my favorites box!

This was a great recipe.  As others said the full teaspoon of red pepper flakes may be a little spicy for some tastes.  Instead of the pancette, I used about 1 1/2 cup of diced smoked ham and added chopped carrots, green bell pepper, button mushrooms, and substituted spinach for Swiss chard and pinto beans for cranberry beans.  It was wonderful!

This was the best minestrone soup I have ever had!!! I didn't use the cranberry beans because I could not find any at the store. Instead, I used a second can of garbanzo beans. I also used a full cup of the pasta. I have a VERY picky eater in my household!!! Let's just say that everyone finished their dinner!!

This is the best minestrone ever!!  I've made it three times and followed the recipe to the letter.  My grown kids love it too.  We eat it with toasted garlic bread, parmasean and olive oil.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.

Watch amount of red pepper, use to taste, used 1/4 tsp myself. Added mushrooms and shredded carrots to use them up, yummy. Also used fresh basil as I was out of parsley. Was devoured by family who loved it. Will make again.

First time making Minestrone soup. I doubled the recipe and tweaked it a little bit, however. I did double the amount of pancetta, but it didn't seem to have enough flavor so I added a small amount of bacon lard. I also added no salt seasoning along with the italian seasonings. I stopped at three different stores for the cranberry beans, they didn't have them (they were high end stores, too), so I sub with northern great beans and I added some light kidney beans. The swiss chard bunch was too much, even for a double recipe and since we are watching carbs, I just used 2/3 cup of small shells for the double batch . I gave it a 4 star because I don't think this soup would have been as good, had I not added some additional seasonings. I think next time, I am going to try it with beef broth instead of chicken. It did give me a good base to go on, though. I would agree with another person, not to add so much water and add the macaroni separately, especially if you are going to make enough for left overs for the next day or even to freeze or can.

Made this many times when I was taking care of my elderly parents. Became my father's favorite soup. Substituted the pancetta with Italian sausage. Sacrilege? It worked great when browned and fortified the character of the soup.

Served with garlic bread and a small side salad. Cannot emphasize enough the outstanding flavor of this soup!

I tried it and it was very good. However I think there is a mistake 
with the 2 teaspoons of salt. Way to salty. On the video Chef John indicates a big pinch of salt but the recipe calls for 2 teaspoons.
Other than that it is great and I will make it again.

Soooo good!!  I made little changes too, as expected. Used Salami instead of Pancetta, lentils instead of cranberry beans and escarole instead of Swiss chard. What a yummy soup!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe. I put in more of the pancetta and since I didn't want to bother with the cranberry beans, I decided to put in some lentils, although any type of canned beans work well. I also added potato and carrot. It's just wonderful! I've already made it 3 times and  have placed the leftover in the freezer.
