I really expected not to like this, but I chose the cilantro/lime instead of the orange /sage ones & I could not get enough of the citrusy /buttery flavor. I will definately be making this again.

This was an easy and quick recipe :) My variations included adding onions after cooking the pork chops 5 min on each side (10min total)...added the sliced onions onto the bottom of the pan, then placed the porkchops back on top. Mixed squeezed orange juice and some orange marmalade, honey, and 1 T cornstarch together to make a thicker glaze. Poured over pork chops, put a lid over top and cooked 10-15 min longer. It was fantastic!!!

I was pressed on time and this recipe looked like it would be quick to make, so, I thought I would give it a try.   I am so glad I did!   The chops cooked very fast and were moist and juicy.  The orange and sage gave the chops a lot of flavor and worked perfectly with the pork.   I served with steamed fingerling potatoes and baby green peas.  I will definitely make again and will also try the suggested lime & cilantro combination.

Tender, easy, on the table in 30 minutes, and bursting with flavor. I made as written and it was good. I didn't see the footnotes until afterwards but lime and cilantro would be right up our alley. Can't wait to try that next!

I'm a sucker for weeknight meal done in under 30 minutes. This one did not disappoint. The orange-sage pan sauce was so easy to make and added just the right amount of flavor to this dish. My chops were slightly thicker than 1/2" but the 4 minutes per side was almost dead on. I will definitely add this to my quick dinner menu.

These went together quickly and were very good.  Followed the recipe exactly, just cooked a bit with the cover on so juices wouldn't dry up.  Family liked them a lot.

Easy, simple and delicious. The glaze made with ICBINB, orange and sage is really tasty. I seasoned the pork chops with garlic salt and pepper . The garlic flavor was a great addition to the sauce. I can't wait to make the variation of this recipe with lemon and cilantro. This recipe is a Keeper!!!

This was a great quick meal. I like the orange and sage, but even after a bit of time the sauce wasn't the consistency I would have liked. I think if I were to make this again I would substitute orange marmalade for the orange juice or add it to the recipe for a little bit of sweet to set off the savory. I would also like to try the lime and cilantro version as I am a big fan of cilantro.

Delicious one pan meal that's done in under 30 minutes! I changed this up a bit by using thinly sliced boneless/skinless chicken breasts and the suggested variation of lime and cilantro in place of the orange and sage. It turned out amazing. That pan sauce, wow. I served this alongside cilantro-lime rice and steamed broccoli. It was a hit. I can't wait to try it with pork chops as written next time.

After reading the footnotes I decided to use cilantro along with the orange and I'm glad I did. These were easy to make with great flavor. Next time I will use lime and cilantro.

This is a great quick and easy recipe.   I used real butter though.   And next time I'll add more fresh OJ to get a little more sauce.   Very good!

This is an easy, delicious recipe.   I was afraid the sauce would be too thin so I added cornstarch & pineapple marmalade (didn’t have orange marmalade).  It turned out to be a little thick so I added chicken broth.  It was still great, but would have been fine without all the revisions.  We will definitely make it again with pork chops or chicken & also with lime & cilantro.  Just proves there are many ways to prepare this dish!

Made this on a night where I had chicken on hand so I made Orange Sage chicken. I added a big heaping tablespoon of brown sugar & extra cup of Orange juice with some corn starch.
Definitely a keeper

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I used Orange Marmalade instead of Peaches and the sauce turned out PERFECT! I didn't use Wine cause I was in a hurry and just didn't have any but the next time I make this I'll try it. And I'm impressed with the chops and how well they turned out! And they were eaten before I could get a picture. Next time I'll make them alone and THEN call the wolves! Lol

I substituted lemon juice for the orange juice, and fresh cilantro for the sage, as other reviews suggested.  I also used bacon grease in place of the butter (currently cannot have milk products). It was very delicious!  Our chops were pretty thick, so after I turned them, I covered the pan with a lid and kept checking for doneness with an instant-read thermometer.  They came out moist and yummy! We had sautéed green beans on the side, and they were tasty with the lemon sauce too.

I made it, sort of.  I didn't have the exact ingredients, so I improvised.  I used 8 pork loin chops, 1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1/4 cup soy sauce, fresh sage from the garden, about 3 tablespoons chopped, pepper, a little vegetable oil, and a pinch of salt.  I marinaded for about 2 hours, then grilled to 150 degrees.  My family and I loved it, it really was good.

This was very good! The ICBINB spread made a wonderful glaze. I will make this again. I used pork tenderloin for this one because it's our favorite.

Great, simple recipe!  I like another reviewer's suggestion of using orange marmalade next time.  I did use thicker chops but it didn't seem to have much of an impact on the cook time.
