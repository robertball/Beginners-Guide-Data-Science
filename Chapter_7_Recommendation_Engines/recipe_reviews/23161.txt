Excellent recipe.  I made some adjustments...used all cornbread (no white bread) and added a pound of sage sausage.  Needed to cook twice as long as stated.  Lovely!

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone piled it high on their plates and then got seconds.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  It was sooo delicious.  I only used about half a loaf of white bread.  I could not find a 16 oz cornbread mix.  I used one Jiffy 8.5 oz mix and one Shawnee Mills 5 oz mix, made them separately, and then crumbled them into the bowl.  Turned out great!  Thanks, Holly, for sharing this awesome dressing recipe!  It tastes as good as, if not better than, my mother-in-law's wonderful dressing!!  When I made this recipe again, I made it the day ahead and placed it, covered, in the refrigerator.  The next day, I baked it and it was wonderful!  Being able to make it the day before made my Thanksgiving Day a bit less stressful!!

I used this recipe to make my Christmas dressing. This was my first time ever making dressing. I was so thrilled at how easy to follow the recipe was and the dressing tasted fabulous. This was by far the best dressing I've ever had. It even beat my grandmother's and that says it all.YUM!

To all those who gave their expert opinions that southern dressing does not have bread and only uses boiled eggs....that's just not correct.  I am nearly 70 years old and have lived in the south all my life.  One of my southern grandmothers always used bread and cornbread mixed.  My other southern grandma did not.  One used boiled eggs, the other didn't boil hers.  To say southerners only cook things one way is to limit their versatility.  By the way,  both my grandmas made delicious dressing! Since they, too, lived in the south all their lives, I consider theirs authentic southern dressing.   I thought this recipe was very good, and a nice change from my personal recipe.  Good job, Holly.

Delicious!  I used all cornbread instead of the loaf and baked it longer. Will be making it again for Christmas.

I doubled the recipe & used chicken drumsticks. I also put some bay leaves in the water when the chicken was boiling.  This turned out great!  It was time consuming, but very easy.  There are so many ways to vary this recipe according to taste.  Thanks so much!

The eggs was kind of weird, to me, so I did not use; I also made 2 pans of actual cornbread and used no bread (also strange to this Southerner). I put my onion, celery, and a can of corn in the food processor and pulsed til teeny-tiny, so each nite of dressing would have veggies in it.  Had to take 2 stars away for each weird ingredient (in my mind casserole has eggs).

I loved this recipe. It was a little time consuming to make but was absolutely delicious! I added two cans of sliced water chestnuts which gave it more texture.

Last year I had to make the dressing for our family Thanksgiving celebration for about 40 people.  I had never made dressing before and search the internet for a recipe.  I selected this one.  It was pretty easy and very tasty, even if I do say so myself.  I received alot of compliments and 2 requests for the recipe.  I'll admit that I didn't use a whole loaf of bread in the recipe; as I was mixing everything together it just didn't seem like it needed a whole loaf.  The only problem I had was that I had put the dressing in a deep dish to bake and it took longer to bake than the 30 minutes listed on the recipe.

This was great!  The only thing I added that, to me, makes it actually Southern was ground sage.  2 teaspoonsful.  You can add it to your taste but this is a really good recipe!  If you don't have celery, used cream of celery soup and a little celery salt and it will be just fine!

I made this recipe this weekend.  I made a couple of additions.  I added 1 container of Swanson's chicken stock.  Instead of using half cornbread and half loaf bread, I made it from a whole pan of cornbread.  Overall, the recipe came out well.  I scaled it back to make 9 servings.  I used rotisserie chicken in the mixture.  I will definitely use it again.

I scaled this back to 9 servings, and made a few changes without compromising the original recipe as written. S a last minute addition, I used one small 6oz can of cooked chicken, an additional egg than the scaled version required-i used 1/2 loaf of white wheat bread & leftover frozen cornbread, so I thought it may have dried out a bit. I ended up using 3cups of ready to serve broth and 1cup of whole milk. I also dotted some butter on top of the 9x13" pan before cooking it @375 for 25mins.

This recipe is much like mine, except for I use the stewed meat of a whole chicken, not breast meat which adds more flavor to the dressing.  I also use butter not margarine.  Happy Cooking from one Southern Gal who LOVES her Great Grandmomma's Dressing recipe!  =)

Thanks to this recipe I have been designated as the "bringer of the dressing" by my mother-in-law. I used two large cans of chicken breast, including the liquid, with three cups of canned chicken broth. I upped the onion and celery, one large, sweet onion and six stalks of celery. I baked at 325 for one about 50 minutes. The extra ingredients allowed me to bake my Dad (the dressing nazi) his own small loaf. For my Dad to eat and enjoy any dressing besides my Mom's is AMAZING! Thanks for sharing.

Outstanding southern dressing. I ALWAYS cook my cornbread in an iron skillet . It just gives that something extra. I added chicken bouillon granules to my cornbread mix before baking and left off the bread as my family doesnt like pasty dressing. I made a gravy out of the broth , flour , oil and cream of chicken soup and we ate this for 3 days !! YUM ! best dressing ever .

Absolutely fantastic recipe!!!  The only change I made was to mix by hand, rather than a potato masher.  It gave a chunkier stuffing . . . which I love!  It was GREAT!!

This dressing was a hit at my house; it was moist, the way we like it, and had the most wonderful flavor.   I omitted the bread and used corn bread only, and also used 1 cup onion, 1 cup celery, wonderful, is all I can say.  Nancy

My family loved this dressing!! I left out the celery (because I have picky kids) and I added some celery salt instead. I think next time I may just add a can of cream of celery soup! I will be making this again!!

I read the reviews before making this and "tweaked" it a bit by using other viewers suggestions. I added sage and sausage and lil more butter. Thanks for sharing.

This is the first year that I went against my family’s traditional recipe.  I did change a few things.  I have mentioned before in many of my rating, I cook by scratch ONLY!  I did not use the chicken halves; after cooking my turkey, I omitted the butter and used the dripping from the turkey and I made my cornbread from scratch. I plan to go against it every year now. Thank you.

Very easy to make and it tastes wonderful!  I added 6 cups of broth and needed to bake it about 15 minutes longer as a result.

This was incredible. I follow the directions exactly. I plan on making this weekly. I used a cornbread recipe from the back of white lily self rising cornbread though instead of a mix. DELICIOUS.

LOVED THIS!!!! I have been trying to reproduce my grandmothers dressing and by adding a 1/2 cup chopped pecans I have found it! I also like a  1/2 teaspoon sage and 2 teaspoons of Bells Seasoning (a VERY good poultry seasoning blend) Thanks this is great!!!!

EXCEPTIONAL...I was looking for a great recipe that would please both sides of the family whom have very different dressing recipes in the family and I succeeded.  This was my first time to cook Christmas dinner and I wanted a recipe that they would enjoy and I could add to my very own Christmas tradition list.  WONDERFUL!!!!!

This recipe is great i added maple pan sausage along with the shredded chicken, and it turned out GREAT! I also sauteed my onions and celery in butter so they would be soft and not crunchy,(cause my family is VERY particular about onions! LOL All in all this is a very GREAT recipe ! !

I loved this recipe. It was my first time making stuffing and it turned out perfect. Sometimes you get stuffing that is too mushy or too dry this was just right. My family loved it also.

I agree FlowersandCandy!! I was going to say that a true SOUTHERN cornbread DRESSING (NOT stuffing) contains NO WHITE BREAD, and an addition of sausage... delicious!

Excellent dressing.  I see the debate over true southern dressing having white bread or not.  My family is from KY and are true southern cooks through and through.  Some of the women add white bread and some don't so there is not just one "southern way"  I did not make any changes to the recipe and it is delicious.  Can't wait for all of the southern ladies in my family to rate this next to theirs.  I made it the day before and baked it the day I served it and everyone loved it.  I was not sure I would like the chicken and almost left it out, glad I didn't.  The only thing I did different than the recipe was baked it about 20 min longer than the recipe called for since my dish was cold.  Next time I will increase the bake time by a little more.  Another keeper for sure!

This was very delicious! I made this recipe exactly the way the recipe says to make it without one deviation. It was perfect!  Very easy and worth the time involved.  The shredded chicken was a new ingredient for me to add to dressng (stuffing) and I will forever continue to use THIS recipe.  The time for cooking states 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Definitely go with the "until golden brown" option. You can't go wrong!  Enjoy!

This was good. The only thing i would do different next time is reduce the amount of poultry seasoning. I didnt care too much for it. I also had to bake an additional 20 minutes.

This dressing is SOOOO good.  Not hard to make, either, but very delicious.  The only thing hubby and I did differently was added a it more celery and onion, but that's an individual thing, I think.

This is my first time making dressing other than from the box...BOY was it good, I doctored it up a little by adding sausage, and a lil brown sugar I haven't been cooking from recipes long so I didn't measure the sugar it was abouth 1/4 of a cup and 1/2 pound sausage. This dressing is exactly what I wanted for Thanksgiving but a couple days later is good for me! Thanks!

This was GREAT! My first time making my own stuffing. However I changed it a bit. Instead of the day old bread, I made homemade cornbread using Dixie Lilly's southern cornbread recipe and just let it sit out for a couple hours. I added boiled eggs, and took away the celery. You can also use canned chicken broth if you dont have enough broth left over after boiling your chicken! LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

In my part of the country, no self-respecting cook would dare make cornbread dressing without a few chopped green onions--never bell pepper--and thyme instead of poultry seasoning. 
Also, I am reminded of a new bride who proudly made Thanksgiving dinner for her in laws.  Unfortunately, she used a sweet cornbread mix--she has never lived that one down.

I made this recipe to a T, minus as much celery. I gave it 4 stars because even after adding 6C, I found it to be a little dry. Also, I believe there should be sage added, as well as double the amount of poultry seasoning. Overall, pretty good recipe.

Yup--loved it!  Comfort food at its best.  I only used half of my cornbread and it still made enough to feed an army.  I added steamed green beans for a one-dish meal.  Great way to use up leftover turkey--I shredded mine in the food processor.  I used parsley, sage, thyme, pepper and garlic powder and was generous on the amounts for the herbs.  Thanks!!  Delicious!

This stuffing recipe was a hit this thanksgiving with my family. Holly, thank you for sharing. This is only my second time cooking for thanksgiving and it was a success. I prepared following the recipe only change I used store purchased chicken broth and added a little extra. I'm shy in the kitchen so bringing this recipe to life was amazing for me. I greatly appreciate all the reviews it helps me tremendously.

I made this recipe last week, and it is the best dressing ever! I used only 1/2 a loaf of bread, and only 3 eggs. I did not include the chicken, because I will have a turkey with it.I am making 2 more pans today for Thanksgiving tomorrow. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. If you add chicken thighs to the pot with your chicken breasts (and increase the water accordingly) the liquid you reserve will be much more rich and flavorful. (You can skin the chicken thighs after cooking and use them in giblet gravy, for chicken salad, or for BBQ chicken sandwiches on a different day.  (The meat freezes well to be reheated for sandwiches later.)  Doing this made the dressing MUCH more flavorful.

My first attempt at homemade dressing, and my family loved it!  I didn't have cream of chicken, so I used cream of mushroom, and no chicken breast.  Still fabulous!

I use this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Instead of the loaf of bread and Jiffy Cornbread I use Jiffy Baking Mix instead. This insures that it is not too dry. Other than that it is perfect and my family loves it night after night.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner this year.  It was a big hit with everyone!  I followed the recipe except for a couple of minor changes.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, because I find thighs to be more flavorful and lower in cost to purchase. The only other change I made was to use the bagged bread cubes instead of fresh white bread.  This was for my own convenience. I purchased the unseasoned variety so it was really just dried white bread.  Most of the dressing was consumed during dinner, but the rest was requested by the guests to take some home. I will make again very soon.

Yup, this is traditional Southern dressing! Usually use turkey rather than chicken- always cook extra turkey legs the day before for the broth and meat. No extras here- just cornbread, white bread, eggs, onions, celery, butter, poultry seasoning and broth. Grandma would be proud. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I have made it 2-3 years now for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is great as is but I have now changed it a tiny bit for our tastes. I add an 8oz package of mushrooms chopped up and I use fresh garlic and saute it with all of the vegetables. I got lazy with the cornbread and buy an 8x8 pan already made at the grocery store :). 
If I don't have cream of chicken I use cream of mushroom. I boil 4 leg quarters instead of the breast halves because we prefer dark meat. I use Tony chacheres  for seasoning because its always in the house and works well in this recipe. It usually takes a minimum of 45 minutes to an hour in the oven- I bake it in my glass pyrex so I can see when its golden on the sides and bottom too. I always prepare this a day in advance- cover in the fridge and cook the day of.  The recipe is great as is but can easily be modified for your tastes, I live up north now but have to have my southern dressing for the holidays and this recipe made that possible!!

I will make this recipe again.  I consider myself a pretty awesome cook, but dressing was just not one of my strong suites.  I made a few alterations and my family love this!  Instead of chicken I use smoked turkey, cook it until I can shred it.  I only use cornbread no loaf or white bread.  I also add sage, salt, pepper, and 1 10.75 ounce can of condensed cream of celery along with the cream of chicken. I use the broth made from boiling the smoked turkey.  It was so yummy!

There is no 16 oz. package of dry cornbread mix, so not sure if the recipe calls for a 6.5 oz. pkg. I used 3 packages and left out the bread. Make sure the recipe is a little soupy when you mix it all up so it won't be dry after it's cooked. Had to bake it 45 minutes before it was done. My family said it was a little bland even after I added 2 tsp. sage.

Yes, I used fresh herbs from the garden, sage, thyme, Italian parsley, rosemary. I used much less bread the second time I made this and less eggs. I added finely diced onions, celery and green pepper lightly sauteed in olive oil. I also used a large pan of  homemade corn bread made in a large cast iron skillet. I substituted butter one time and canola oil the second time. I found it delicious either way. I geuss I made it more like my usual way the next couple of times and liked it better but found the  closer to original  batch was also good! I usually add a large pinch of red pepper flakes/crushed pepper to my dressin' as well. Sometimes I make it eggless like  poor country folk may have to do occasionally and also like that just as well or better.  Adjust the liquids(broth/water) to your desired level of  wetness in the finished "dressing".  I like mine fairly moist to almost wet for most servings. That requires making the mixture very ,very wet and juicy before baking! I had never used a can of soup before in my cornbread dressing, nice easy way to flavor the mixture. My mother  used only a left over biscuit or a couple slices stale bread in her cornbread dressing and only one or two eggs. The onions,celery and bell pepper where always used together with a generous  handfull of fresh parsley.(always plentiful in the cooler seasons here in the south. Hence my  taste are prejudiced. Many variations, most  are delicious when they feature the cornbread and have that texture o

First time ever making this further more tasting cornbread dressing. My 4 and 6 yr old loved it! Will definitely make this part of my holiday menu through out the years. Only thing next time I will use all cornbread instead of mixing in regular loaf bread.

I have made this several times since I found this recipe  years ago. Its easy and always excellent.  I don't think I realized how good it was until this one thanksgiving when I was forced to eat some one else's oyster dressing... no thanks.  I will stick with this. I don't make any changes other than I have done it enough times to eyeball it....  This one's a keeper.

I thought this was good. I bought cubed cornbread that came with a seasoning packet so I cut the poultry seasoning and pepper in half. I used much less bread, as I prefer the taste of the cornbread in dressing. So, I also cut the egg amount in half and the dressing was plenty soft after baking.  I also left out the chicken as I was serving it with turkey. So, I used part broth with the water. I chose this recipe because it was like the one I normally use but with less butter. I must say, although too much butter is not so healthy, I prefer the flavor of my regular more buttery cornbread dressing.

Turned out good but not granny worthy good. I can't imagine not using the eggs as one review suggested. I also added a bit more sage/poultry seasoning. Other then that, not bad.

I have made this recipe twice, and it has been a big hit twice!!! I made a few minor adjustments; I omitted the bread altogether,(used more cornbread), added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and cooked about 15 mins longer. Very easy and very good!!!

This stuffing is wonderful! I'll use this recipe from now on.  I was skeptical about the eggs, but followed recipe, and I'm glad I did.  It looked like mush when I put it in the oven but came out light and yummy.  I made for Thanksgiving so I didn't add the chicken. Loved it!

Overall it is a good recipe.  But I thought it lacked depth of flavor.  I thought it could have used a bit more of something, namely sage, and perhaps something else.  In truth I made this over two days, since I had a lot of things to make and only one oven in which to make them.  So I ended up using chicken broth rather than the chicken stock from the breasts.  Also a 1 lb loaf each of white bread and cornbread are going to require a HUGE mixing bowl.  I ended up having to mix everything in a big pot that is normally used for chili.  After mixing everything up, I put it into two baking dishes (nearly twice the suggested servings although I made it pretty close to the recipe) and put it into the fridge to store for baking the next day.  In the end I found out that my family prefers the traditional white bread dressing, so I won't be making this one again.  is' good just not great.

Too much poultry seasoning.  Too wet.

eggs make it way too heavy and we all hate canned soup.  I will stick with my old recipe it's the best.
