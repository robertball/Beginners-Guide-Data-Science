We liked this. Light, fresh flavors, and unusually delicious served at room temperature.  I adjusted the amounts of oil and vinegar, however, to the 3:1 ratio I prefer. I also added some sliced black olives, basically because I had some leftover in the fridge after making a pizza but it was actually a very nice addition.   Also, to make this more carb-friendly, I doubled the amount of zucchini.  Wouldn’t hesitate to make this again…and I probably will.

Made this as directed for a family get-together.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.  Had a little bit left over, so the next day, I added a chopped tomato and half an avocado and a little vinagerette.  Oh my, even better!

I didn't have Orozo, so I substituted  the pasta that's about the size of quinoa (I can't for the life of me remember the name)  I am not fond of white wine vinegar, and didn't like the flavor, so I added the juice of a fresh lime which improved it greatly.  I think I would do it again for a change.  An uncommon way to use zuchinni.  Oh, I also added a little sun-dried tomato with the oil.

I added avocado, cherry tomatoes, and a handful of walnuts.  I replaced the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar.  It was good for lunch on the go.
