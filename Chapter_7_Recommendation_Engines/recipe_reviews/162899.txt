If I could give this negative star rating I would. I bake a lot and these were a complete disaster! I made the recipe as written and it was too runny, the batter overflowed onto the oven floor and the batter left in the cups did not bake and rise, but were left concave, and a liquidy, goey mess. I do not suggest anyone make this! The only positive was the batter did taste good.

Sorry about that! I did say that the batter would turn out runny when submitting the recipe, but that was omitted when they edited it, unfortunately. I originally made them and frosted them with ganache, which made them super decadent.

I just spent more time cleaning the oven!  This was a complete mess.  The recipe said runny it was more like a flood.  I'll try the hazelnut recipe again but from a different book.

These cupcakes did not turn out for me.  But I'm pretty sure it was all my fault!!  After putting all of the ingredients together the batter was really, really runny. So I left out the 1/3 cup of water and added 3/4 cup flour.  I'm sure this threw off the chemical balance resulting in brownies that sunk in the middle.  Bummer because I love hazlenuts and they're not cheap!!  Oh well, if you try these, just beware that the batter is runny.   Maybe I'll try them again some day--especially since I now have two jars of Nuttela!

This was an interesting experience. We decided to cut it in half. Even so it made 12 not 9 ENORMOUS cupcakes (but at least they didn't spill into the oven)! They were tasty, but top anything with nutella and can it really be bad? They also imploded and could not stand up on their own (not even LifeAlert could help them). It was a good effort, but something is not quite right.

This recipe didn't turn out for me at all. I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes caved in. When pouring the batter how full do you recommend? I think maybe I just needed to put a little less batter in each cup...they taste delicious but are in no shape to serve to anyone!
