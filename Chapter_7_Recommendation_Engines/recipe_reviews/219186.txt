The kids really liked it. The brown sugar gives a sweetness the kids crave. I had to pull it out of the oven five minutes early because the bread was about to burn. Used a bag of precrumbled sausage and made it even easier. Overall a good recipe that we will likely make again. Simple and fast. Really 3.5 stars, but had to round up to be fair.

I loved the simplicity! My 2 toddlers loved it, & I wasn't complaining. Maybe next time I'll try it with homemade biscuits in a muffin pan.... 
Thanks Rick!

This is a good quick recipe that is easy and tasty. Next time I make it I am going to leave the brown sugar out and make with spice chicken sausage for the adults.

I added a layer of mushrooms to this and didn't realize until I had the thing in the oven that I forgot the brown sugar. No harm though. I used a yummy homemade turkey sausage in this

very yummy... just came out of the oven... i would highly suggest using 2 cans of crescent rolls instead of 1. Also I would put the cheese between each layer instead of all on top. I had mine in for about 23 min and it came out dark brown almost burnt... i dont know if using 2 cans would change that result in any way but next time im only going to put in for 17-20 min
