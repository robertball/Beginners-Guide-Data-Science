This is the same recipe that I have used for years, but I couldn't figure out how to make the raisins softer without boiling them. Thanks to this recipe, I soaked them. The only thing it didn't mention was how long to soak them. I gave it a good guess. I soaked them in warm water for about 45 min. they were the perfect consistency. Not to hard and not to mushy.

These were great.  But I turned mine into Rum Raisin cookies.  I put the two cups of raisins in a saucepan with one cup water and a half cup of Captain Morgan's spiced rum.  I brought it to a hard boil, and then turned down the heat and simmered it until all the fluid was absorbed.  It took about thirty minutes.  After the cookies were baked and cooled, I drizzled a glaze over them that was just powdered sugar and Captain Morgan.  Everybody says they're one of the best cookies I've made.  And I've made a lot of cookies.

fabulous cookies!!!  I added 1 t. cinnamon because raisins ans cinnamon just go together.  I wonder how they'd be with ricotta substituting for the shortening?

I myself do not like raisins, so I did not try them, although everyone who had them tried to convince me to eat them because, and I quote, "they are THE BEST raisin cookies that I have ever had!!!" - My Mom. I asked everyone who ate them to rate them 1 to 10 and most rated 9/10 so I decided to rate them a 4/5, due to the fact that I was told, more than once, that they were a bit too sugary. I definatley recommend that you try to make these cookies. They are very good, apparently, so happy baking! :D

Great cookies.  But I altered the recipe just slightly.  I decreased the cookies by 1/2 cup sugar, and by one egg.  I also did 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup margerine and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  They turned out fantastic.

I have made this several times now. The one thing I do different is soak the raisins in rum. I use about a cup of rum for 2 cups raisins. I put the vanilla in the raisin rum mix and just dump it all into my butter, sugar and flour mix.
