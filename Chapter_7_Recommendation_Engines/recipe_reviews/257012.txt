They are so-so pancakes. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of regular flour. I feel like they were missing something...banana, something. My kids ate them and were happy, but my taste buds weren't begging for more.

Oatmeal Cinnamon Pancakes Haiku: "Pretty good pancake. They were quite thick and poofy. I used quick cook oats." Other than swapping quick-cooking oats for old-fashioned, I was faithful to the recipe, and the pancakes turned out okay (very tall, puffy) , just not cinnamon-y enough for that to be a flavor name featured in the title. With butter and syrup, they were good, just not outrageously so.
