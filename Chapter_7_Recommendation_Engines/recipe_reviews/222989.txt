Instead of plain salt, I used Johnny's Seasoning Salt (which I also increased quite a bit) and I took Christine's suggestion and added a teaspoon each of onion/garlic powder. I have not had decent jo-jo potatoes since I moved to the East from the Northwest--these remind me of home. Everyone loved them. I served them with a homemade ranch and meatball subs.

Fun, new-to-me way to make oven fries!  I cut into fairly think wedges and the crispy coating really adhered well.  I cooked at a lower temp but preheated the oil in my jelly roll pan while I was breading the potatoes.  Used red potatoes because they were starting to sprout, I think regular Idado would be more suitable but it's nice to know that red or even Yukon could be used!

These are very good! After reading the first review, I decided to double all of the spices (except the cayenne), and I also added in some onion and garlic powders. These baked up perfectly in the time specified, but I felt that they still needed more salt (I think the addition of the salt would've enhanced the flavors even more). All in all this was a fun new way to serve fries and one that I will be making again (w/ more salt, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

Should have read the reviews closer before making! By following the actual recipe to a "T", you end up with white flour potato wedges.   Doubling up on the spices would be the answer.

I doubled everything except the flour which I cut in half. I also added four tablespoons of parmesean cheese, that got it! Great starting point though.

I love these kind of fries--reminds me of home--but they are such a pain, I rarely make them.  These are very tasty, but yeah, still a bit of a pain.  I did these in batches and played around with the oil part to find out what worked best.  I tried spraying with the spray oil (you really do have to coat) and drizzling with oil.  these really need to be completely covered in oil, so what seems to work best for me is drizzling, but then flipping and moving around the oil until completely covered.  A pain, but better than frying and turns out delicious.  I did double the spices and use seasoned salt; glad I did.  thanks for the recipe!

I amped up the spices but not the flour. Delicious will be making these again.  I tasted a tiny bit of the flour before dredging to ensure the right degree of flavor. I thought it definitely needed more salt. A real must-try, do yourself a favor.

Double all spices, add 1 teaspoon each: garlic, onion powder, seasoned salt and instead of drizzling with oil, SPRAY with vegetable oil spray until no white shows. nobody likes powdery fries... then perfect. thank you :)

I followed the recipe but it ended up with the flour showing through. I am assuming that I need to add more oil for these to really turn out. Has anyone experimented with using more oil?  And is there a way to make them a bit more moist?

Doubled spices, added 1 tsp. garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, left out the cayenne (b/c I didn't have any). Then I sprayed with olive oil instead of drizzling. Would like to try to double dip them next time!

I veganized this recipe by substituting the milk and egg with almond milk and a flax egg. It came out fabulously, and is very filling!

I would use less flour and more spices. - they should be fried somehow- either deep fry or skillet.  i had to go back and spray with oil to coat all the flour potatoes.  I would make it again but probably deep fry.

I reduced the flour and doubled the spices like the other reviews had suggested. Reduced the flour to 2/3 pf a cup
But still the fries did not look that good. They looked quite pale and dry.

Not bad but I found it works much better if you dip in the batter twice.

I didn't care for these fries.  The texture wasn't appealing to me.  I tasted a lot of flour.  I tried to make them exactly as the recipe is written.  However, I did make some in the oven and I fried the others.  The fried ones were much better but of course the coating all came off.  The flavor would've been nice if the coating didn't have the dry flour texture or would've stayed on during frying.  I did coat them with oil as recommended by one reviewer.

Simple and delicious. I pretty much added my own seasonings but I used the cooking technique provided. Everyone, especially my 6 year old cousin, enjoyed it!

These were ok, not as much flavor as I would have liked.
