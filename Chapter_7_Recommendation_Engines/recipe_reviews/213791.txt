Great for breakfast - I used my large pancake flipper and light Cheddar cheese instead of a Mexican blend as that's what I had on hand. I must say, breakfast burritos are a bit easier...

Easy fast breakfast. I used some leftover Easter ham. I don't know what an inverted turner is, so I just used my regular ol' pancake flipper. Do put the tortillas in the skillet before adding the cheese or toppings or you will have a difficult time (messy) trying to get them there if you already put the cheese in unless you use slices. This was good, but breakfast tacos are so much easier and faster.
