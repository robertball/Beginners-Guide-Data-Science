I love ceviche' and this was a really good simple version. The cucumber was a bit more overpowering when I opened the container, but the dish was delicious. I definitely make this version again, but only when I don't have the time for my favorite ceviche' recipe!

This was quite good, however being that the recipe called for pre-cooked shrimp I wouldn't call this a ceviche. Ceviche is seafood that marinates and "cooks" without heat in a citrus juice for several hours. Not a fan of the cilantro so I left it out and replaced the greenery with parsley. Family enjoyed this very much and thank you!

This is an easy, quick ceviche recipe that our family has been using for years.  We use green onions instead of red and also add lime juice, avocados and octopus.

Good ceviche on the fly though I still prefer the traditional uncooked seafood in lime juice. I think I might add the mary mix to my favorite ceviche for serving next time. Thanks for sharing!
