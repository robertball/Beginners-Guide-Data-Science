I added a slight twist to the original recipe and I got rave reviews for the dish!  I used a packet of Taco Seasoning on the ground beef, used monteray jack and colby cheeses instead of american, and crumbled nacho cheese flavoured doritos on the top of it.  Nearly everyone in my family helped themselves to seconds!!!

Great recipe! Modifications that I made: 1 teaspoon of "Taco Seasoning 1" and used 1/4 cup of cheddar and 1/4 cup monterrey Jack cheese instead of the American slices. Since I was out of milk, I used 1/3 cup light sour cream instead. My husband loves this one!

Great recipe for people who surf the net too long and find they don't have much time left to get the dinner on!  It was easy; had all ingredients; tasty and filling and best of all the kids loved it!  I have added this to my recipe box.
Happy.

One of my favorites now- 

One little tip: I've found if you use generic soy sauce- follow the recipe; however, if you use the higher quality stuff you may want to use a little less- 

 I've made this recipe with wheat pasta, lean ground beef, skim milk, and fat-free Kraft Singles which turned it into a great low-fat dinner too!

Just got done eating this for dinner and my husband and I both agree that it is very tasty. I added some Velveeta cheese and a little bit of leftover shredded sharp cheddar, and left out maybe one or two of the American cheese slices.  What's weird is my husband and I both really like Hamburger Helper but I won't buy it anymore because of the trans fat in it (I try to avoid most foods with hyrdogenated oils).  So this, to us, was like Hamburger Helper, only better.  Thanks for the easy, quick, and yummy recipe!

My family LOVED this.  We used 1lb of ground beef instead of 1/2 and used half cheddar cheese and half American cheese.  YUMMY!!

My family just got done eating this for dinner. It was fabulous!! I changed a few things like more meat and pasta, less soy sauce, I add taco seasoning and used monterey jack and colby cheese. I also used garlic and onion powder. I have two very picky step children and they loved this meal!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe is just like it says, Beefy, Cheesy Pasta.  My husband I enjoyed this homemade version of Hamburger Helper.  I did change the recipe a bit and added some sour cream and a little prepared mustard to it.  My consistency before adding the sour cream was a bit too dry in my opinion.  It was a nice change to our weeknight meal selections.  It was fast, easy, tasty.

This is quick and easy, and both my husband and son like it.  I have found that it is tastier with more cheese. Insttead of American cheese slices, I use a shredded 5-cheese blend.

I am literally typing this as I am eating. FANTASTIC!! No alterations made to the recipe aside from a few spices as I am a bit of a chilli lover. Looking forward to enjoying the rest for lunch tomorrow at work!!

Really like your quick and easy recipe! I made two changes ... Only used half of an onion (red) because that's what I had on hand and spiced it up with triple the amount of Mild Mexican Velveeta Cheese ;-)

I was a little skeptical about the combination of cheese, soy sauce and milk, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was really a simple, tasty, quick to fix family meal.  I used mozzarella cheese -- don't like American.  I will keep this recipe handy for a last minute meal.

I used ground venison and added a bit of Italian Seasoning and shredded marble jack cheese.  Very tasty!

As others have said, the mixture of cheese and soy sauce was different, but this simple dish is delicious. Me and my wife were shocked at how good this turned out. Kinda tastes like a much better version of hamburger helper. One thing I added was a little sharp cheddar cheese just because of the fact I love it. Thought it was a pretty good addition. I look forward to eating it for lunch tomorrow.

WOW! Better than I thought it would turn out.  I made this recipe just how it was written out.  It was very hard not to follow suggestions but I wanted to make this because of the ingredients.   I usually have these items on hand and I have to say it was real good.  I was most skeptical about the cheese slices but glad I stuck to the recipe.  I hope it taste just as good for lunch tomorrow.

Super easy and tasty recipe.  I doubled the recipe to use a full pound of ground beef.  Instead of the sliced cheese I used about 1 1/2 cups of cubed velveeta cheese.  Really liked the flavor the soy sauce gave to the dish.  Thanks!

Easy, yummy and a hit with both hubby and my picky 8 yr old. My 7 year turned her nose up but she does on most ground beef dishes! More for us though, right? LOL!  I only had 4 slices of American cheese but it was still yummy! I added a little more soy sauce because I used more noodles and 1 lb of ground beef but the flavors meshed together well and this will make awesome leftovers this week! Thanks so much!

I wanted to like this due to the simplicity, but I made it exactly as directed, and it was dry and bland and inedible. Sorry.

I thought this was bland. The cheese didn't add much cheesy flavor. I liked the soy sauce but had to add a lot of soy sauce to make it edible. Don't think I will make this again.

This recipe is very easy to make and my kids liked it to a point.  I think it would have been much better with less soy sauce however as it made it to salty for are taste.  I usually don't cook with salt.

Very similiar to Hamburger Helper.  Good, cheap and comforting--but a little bland.  I use Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy seasoning to liven up the dish.

Way better than I had anticipated!!!  I added half a bag of frozen stir fry veggies to the ground beef after it had browned, and added flour to the cheese sauce to thicken it up.  Very Very good!!!  My fiance was very happy with it, as was I.....

Love it! It is definitely glorified Hamburger Helper(but I love HH). Changes I made was do half soy sauce half Worcestershire sauce, added taco seasoning, used onion powder instead of real onion and drained the meat after it cooked. Used shredded cheddar cheese and velveeta instead of singles.

This recipe was perfect for a busy mom with little time to get dinner on the table!  I increased the ground beef, decreased the soy sauce by about half, and added a bit more milk-delicious! My picky toddler loved it! Thank you so much for sharing this. I'm never buying Hamburger Helper again!

Took some advice from others that made this recipe sound so much better.  Basically changed it quite a bit but....I used 1 lb of ground beef, taco seasoning mix, eliminated the soy sauce, added chopped fresh green and red pepper, onion powder (can't eat onions), garlic powder, light sour cream and shredded low fat chedder cheese.

My family loved this!  Inexpensive and Delish!  I used shredded Sharp cheddar instead, and it was a hit!

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe and second time followed some sugg to increase meat and use taco seasoning. I also added some old el paso queso which gave it a lot of flavor and some spicyness. Much better after tweeking.

I added sour cream and taco seasoning. I also used a little pepper jack. I tried it with penne instead of rotelle. I enjoyed the rotelle more, it held the flavor better. Very good over all, I will cook it again.

Initially a bit bland, but I rescued the dish with a few additions and modifications.  Added fresh red peppers & some cumin, along with some sweet corn to boost the flavor a bit.  Swapped out sharp cheddar cheese for the American cheese and increased the milk content.  Added salt and pepper too.  Didn't use but a teaspoon of soy sauce.  Also added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Granted, it's no longer the original recipe, but was much better with these changes!

This was delicious!  I've made my own hamburger helper stuff before....I really like how easy and simple this was.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, too!  I followed everything the recipe said.  I did use ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also added hamburger seasoning to the turkey as it was cooking...habit.  The only other addition was a can of low-sodium beef broth.  I alternated adding that with the sliced cheese....gave it a smoother and wetter texture.  Oh, I did use penne pasta because that's what I had on hand.  Excellent!
UPDATE: I have also made this several times using the meat base and boxed mac & cheese. Turns out great that way, too!

Fast, easy, and surprisingly good.  I needed more so I added more meat, more pasta, and a little onion/garlic powder as suggested.  I'll admit that I added a little cheddar to make it a little more adult.  Was good before the cheddar, so overall a good meal.

I will give it 4 stars. Yes it is like a hamburger helper but on being in college with minumum funds its not that bad. I modified it. 1 lb. ground beef 1/2 onion 2 cloves garlic. Used 1/8 cup soy and 1/8 cup worchester sauce pepper and garlic powder and cayenne (i used a good portion of cayenne)  I cooked on box (1 lb) of the mini ziti and set it aside. In pot i boiled the pasta in put heat on low added a combination of heavy cream and milk a little more than suggested (eyeball the consistency) 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup shredded mexican or nacho cheese/ 3 slice medium cheddar and 2 tablespoons of the la victoria medium cilantro salsa. It's pretty good not knowing what to have for dinner

This dish wasn't bad.  I used 1 lb. of hamburger (instead of a half lb), but even with the extra meat, I think there was too much of a soy flavor to this dish.  Next time, I'll reduce the soy sauce, and maybe substitute it with a little beef broth so it isn't dry.  It really is a good quick dinner if you don't have too much time, and you want to put something on the table that the family will enjoy.

I call this glorified Hamburger Helper.  I make this recipe when I have hamburger and I'm low on time.  It has great flavor and you can make it as thin or as thick as you like by changing how much cheese and milk you add to the pasta (I use fine egg noodles).

Easy dish to make.  I may have used a bit too much soy sauce. The dish is pretty much a home made hamburger helper.  Very tasty.

With the changes I made, it was pretty good.  I used colby & jack cheeses instead of american, and added an additional 1/4 cup of milk and about 1 cup of frozen peas.  I used 1# of beef and 8oz of rotini.  I also used Worcerstershire sauce instead of soy.  Turned out pretty well, and we all enjoyed it.

This was ok at first but the more I ate, the more I decided I really didn't care for it.  It is very much like a variation of Hamburger Helper, which I eat occasionally.  My husband said it was ok.

Good flavor, but the proportions were not right for me.  5 cups was WAY too much pasta, even with 3/4 lb. of meat; next time I'll try about 3 cups.  And definitely more cheese - I also mixed it in.

Tried it tonight with a few modifications, but the family loved it!  I used 1 package of Jenny O's Breakfast Lovers Turkey Sausage instead of beef, whole wheat penne, and provolone cheese.  I have some intensely picky eaters in my family, and my daughter would like to know if I would make the same meal for breakfast tomorrow!!  Guess this is a keeper!

I really was not a fan of this recipe, though I was hoping it would come out well after reading the positive reviews.  It tasted very bland, so I added a bit of Velveeta, which helped a little.  It was a sub-par glorified version of Hamburger Helper

This was pretty good.  I used elbow pasta and it worked well.  I would say this has a really similar taste to a Hamburger Helper meal but without the long list of ingredients that you worry about! I would make it again, maybe using a little less soy sauce.

We really like this! I make it exactly as written and it goes over great with my family of 5 (3 small children). I do use Velveeta since that is what we usually have on hand. We do not eat boxed dinners, and I was looking for some quick ideas for practice nights. We have had this many times and will continue. Thanks!

Super easy and very tasty.  As others suggested, I added about 1/4C taco seasoning and it turned out very nicely.  A much appreciated, healthier alternative to boxed-a-roni!

Very good and very easy to make.  I used a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the American cheese. Will make again!!

This was EXCELLENT. I used Rice in place of the noodles and chicken in place of the beef and shredded cheese in place of the sliced. Couldnt be better.

This is a homemade version of Hamburger Helper (which I do not eat due to trans fats and MSG).  I followed other suggestions and added a large spoonful of sour cream, and I didn't have any taco seasoning so I added a couple of dashes of taco seasoning and garlic salt.  It was really good- definitely comfort food though.  Also I added finely chopped onions, red and green peppers when I cooked the beef.  Again it was yum.

Great base recipe!  Didn't give it 5 stars because I made a few changes. As suggested by other reviews I doubled the amount of beef to 1lb, and milk to 1/2 cup. Used 3 slices of American cheese, and some left over Velvetta ( All the cheese I had at hand). Also, as the beef was cooking, it seemed to be missing some spices, so I added some ground black pepper, a pinch of cumin and ground mustard, and a bay leaf. Right before serving I mixed in some frozen sweet peas, and some dry parsley flakes. Really, really tasty!!! Did I mention I made this like in 30 minutes????!!!! Will definitley make again!

My fiance literally inhaled this dish!! Made recipe for 2 servings & had to double the amount of milk in order to help make the entire mixture more cohesive. I highly recommend "cheating" and using shredded cheese. I liked that it wasn't too heavy -- perfect amount of cheese & beef.

Great recipe.  Very similar to beef stroganof or Hamburger Helper meals.  I modified this slightly by including cabbage with the onions/meat.  I also didn't have processed cheese and used shredded cheeses instead, which worked just fine.  I served it in a bowl with sour cream on top and a piece of buttered bread on the side.  Next time I would consider adding a can of mushrooms and/or water chestnuts.

I would have liked it a little cheesier and I even added some shredded colby jack in addition to the american slices.  We had a huge onion, so I only added half and that was too much.  Might be okay with a sweet onion.  I'll cut back to half the onion next time.  My husband loved it!  And we both thought it sounded good with the mexican seasoning as other reviewers mentioned.  Maybe we'll try it that way next time.

This is a nice little basic and quick recipe when we are rushed and just want something tasty.  My husband likes soy sauce so for us that was not a problem. Added some garlic, but will not rate a recipe after I have taken it apart by the seams.  Thanks for your submnission - we always need quick, easy and tasty recipes in our files.

Granted, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used a bag of shredded mexican-type cheeses, a pound of beef and a pound of pasta.  I simply found it kind of bland and unexciting.  Seasoning could help that, but you might be better off making a proper cheese sauce, as well.

Way too much soy sauce.  I cut the soy sauce down to about 1/3 cup and it is still way too much.  Just leave the soy sauce out.  We did not like the flavor at all!  We will not be trying this again.

Decent meal, but quite blah. I made as the recipe stated except used a combo of monterey/colby cheese and shrap cheddar as we rarely buy american cheese. Not sure if it's worth the time to make it again.

Great tasting!  Used colby and jack cheeses instead of american.  The only reason we won't have this very often is due to the rising cost of cheese.

It is a good recipe for what it is...cheap, quick and easy.  It did taste a lot better than Hamburger Helper.  We used cheddar cheese instead of the processed american and a whole pound of ground turkey.  I will make again if I need a quick meal.

I can't speak for the rest for everyone but sometimes we have to watch our pennies and this seems like a good recipe for that. However, I did choose to make a sauce and then added it to the pasta/meat mixture. I didn't add anything in except what the recipe said too. All in all it was pretty good. Kids didn't complain and hubby like it too. Though I did find that the little we had left over didn't keep well in the fridge. It didn't taste like it did when I first made it. Other than that, I will make it again. Just not in the amount I did before.

Yummy, easy and quick!

I used a box of Kraft Macaroni that I had on hand (the kind with the squeeze cheese) and just added a little more macaroni.  No onion so I used onion powder - came out great!  Served with sweet peas and dinner rolls and it was ready in less than 20 minutes.  Thanks!

I came across this recipe quite by accident, but I'm happy I did.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my family loved it.  My 6-year-old remarked, "Mommy, I want you to make this every day for the rest of my life."  If that's not a compliment, I don't know what is.  :)

We really liked this a lot.  I used velveeta.  We ended up adding some soy sauce, I suggest adding it to taste.

Overall - I liked it. But here is what I changed and what I would like to try next time. First of all - I halved the recipe, added a few extra splashes of milk and 1/8 of a cup of worchesterchire sauce and used 1/2 American cheese and 1/2 pepper jack cheese (instead of all American). It was actually very good, though I think kids will like it more than adults (it is exactly like Hamburger Helper but without as much salt and preservetives). The only thing I would change for next time would be to use powdered onion instead of fresh because even though I chopped them very finely they were still very "present" in the dish (crunchy, etc) and that did not go well with the other textures.

I was afraid the soy sauce would overpower everything else but it turned out really nice. The only change I made was to add a package of taco seasoning.

My family loved this. Even my kids who are the pickiest eaters asked for seconds and thirds. I did add double the butter and milk called for to help moisten it up. And I didn't have enough american cheese, so I added 3 slices of american and some cheddar cheese. My husband and I like it with the cheddar and we will be making this again soon. Thank you for a great new addition to our menus.

The flavor was great! - but I thought it wasn't "saucy" enough, a bit too thick.  Will adjust next time maybe adding in some cheese soup.

This recipe is excellent for what it is - a quick and easy dinner.  The only modification I made was I used 2 slices of American cheese and then a few ounces of Mexican cheese blend shredded cheese.  I will definitely make this again next time I have a time crunch and want something easy and yummy.

I cheated with this one and used 400g of Goats Cheese (for 4 servings) Which took a good deal of time to melt.  It worked a treat though, a Top notch recipe I'd recommend to anyone and it was so easy to make too!

This was all right but not 5 stars.  I'm not a huge fan of box dinners but I WAS expecting more of a hamburger helper-like consistency.  Maybe next time I will use condensed chedder soup or something because I found it to be a little dry.  I soy sauce gave it a great flavor though! I will definitely be experimenting with this in the future.

I doubled the meat/sauce portion.  I used Velveeta instead of American cheese.  I also sauteed the onions and garlic, along with 4 stalks of celery, separately and then added it to the browned meat.  While this recipe had a nice taste, it was almost completely overwhelmed by the salt.  Everyone liked it, but next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce.

Excellent recipe considering how basic it is. Has a very good taste as is and doesn't overpower or underpower your taste buds. Remember though that soy sauce has a ton of sodium in it, so it's probably not the healthiest dish. You won't regret this recipe.

I use ground turkey breast, whole grain rotini, lite soy sauce and low-fat cheese, and it still tastes great. In fact, I've made it with regular pasta but find the whole grain, in this dish anyway, tastes better. Quick, easy and very good. Thanks!

This was awsome. Who would of thought something so simple could taste sooooo good! I was out of onion so didn't use it. Used garlic powder and a pound of ground turkey. Also didn't have American cheese ( don't like it) so I used a mixture of Colby and cheddar. Because these cheeses aren't as creamy, I added a bit more milk and sour cream. I've heard people say you can't give a recipe five stars if you don't make it the way it's written, but this was such a great start and it was so good, I couldn't give it less.

What a yummy meal! Quick and super easy. I did however put more milk in then listed, only because i like it more creamy. Other then that i followed this recipe like it says. This is so good and cant wait to try it with other types of cheeses. Thanks!

Everyone loved this.  Will definitely make again.  Had to leave the soy sauce out due to a picky daughter but tossed in some bacon pieces and added some chili powder.  Doubled the batch and there is barely enough for lunch tomorrow!

A simple and quick homemade version of Hamburger Helper.  My husband likes it better than the store bought... the soy sauce is a nice change from the ordinary flavors.

I'm extremely surprised at how well this came out. I was pretty desperate for something to make for dinner and while I was very skeptical at several ingredients (soy sauce? cheese???), the results were great enough to make this definitely a keeper recipe and one my boyfriend is going to continually request. Very good. Thanks!^^

I was very surprised at how easy and GOOD this was. I only had penne pasta but it turned out great. Also didn't use the full amount of soy sauce but a good deal of it. Used colby jack cheese because that's what I had on hand. Will use this one again, especially if I'm in a pinch.

This was good. I had to add a lot of spices to suit our tastes. This tastes a lot like a boxed helper mix. Thanks!
