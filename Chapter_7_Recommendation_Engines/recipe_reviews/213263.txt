My husband and I both enjoyed this soup.  I thought that 2T of poultry seasoning was a little too much, I will use less next time (I could taste it a little more than I would have liked).  Also - the 2T of melted butter wasn't enough liquid for the dumplings so I had to add water to the mixture - but they were fantastic dumplings!  We would definitely make it again, it was very easy and tasty.  My husband recommended thickening and putting in a pie crust.

I followed the directions, mostly, I didn't use any of the poultry seasoning as it stated, I used fresh garlic instead of the powder. I also had to use some water for the dumplings as another had stated. I didn't have time to cook it for 6hrs so I cooked it on high for 4hrs and put the dumplings in for the last 30 min, I let the dumplings cook for 15min then took them out and thickened the soup with corn starch and water as my hubby doesn't like thin soups. Once I thickened the soup, I put the dumplings back in the crock pot and con't to let them simmer for 15min. My hubby said it was the best turkey soup he had tried, even better than his grandma's which is a huge deal. Happy cooking!!

Excellent!! I used box biscuit/dumpling mix instead of the dumpling recipe since there were some that altered it. Total hit with everyone!!

The dumpling mix is way off.  You'll def have to add milk or water - probably about 1/4 cup!  Also, 1 tsp salt in only 1 c flour!?  Darn!  I should've thought about that before I made them.  They are sooooo salty!  Also, 2 Tbspn's poultry seasoning is  A LOT!  I doubled everything else, but only used 2 heaping TSPN's of it and it seemed to be plenty.  Not a bad mix of ingredients, but you'll need to adjust the proportions.

I always add more dumplings but either way this is far better than chicken and dumplings and my family loves it. i make it every year at this time using left over turkey that I put in the freezer.

I made this and thought it was yummy!!!  The dumpling recipe was a little off but I kept adding melted butter until it was doughy.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this from scratch by boiling a turkey carcass for 4 hours and using the broth in place of canned stock and the poultry seasoning- it is much healthier and tastier that way.  I'll use this again with chicken bones as well.  

I've never had dumpling soup before, and it turns out we quite liked it.  From now on I will choose dumplings in my soup over noodles. I did have to simmer them for about 30 minutes to get them fully cooked, though.

This soup is very easy to prepare and great for the crockpot when you have leftover turkey.  I have to say, though, I was NOT a fan of the poultry seasoning. It gave the soup a bit of an odd flavor.  I would omit it next time and maybe add a chicken boullion cube or 2 instead.

My family loved this. Followed the suggestion of others and used less poultry seasoning.  Also thickened the turkey mixture before adding the dumplings only because we like ours a little thicker. I used a different dumpling recipe too. Turned out great!

Not bad! I used broth from a boiled turkey carcass left over from Easter along with whatever veggies I had in the house.  I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I tried supplementing with other herbs like basil and rosemary.  When I checked on it after 6 hours, it seemed pretty bland, so I added quite a bit of salt.  The dumplings really added some substance, and the overall flavor ended up being pretty good.  A few tips on the dumplings: I had to add a bit of milk to get them to the right consistency, and I would definitely follow another reviewer's advice and use less salt next time--maybe 1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp. Also, the temperature in the crockpot was not hot enough to cook the dumplings as well as I would have liked, so I ended up transferring liquid to a pot on the stove so that I could get the liquid to simmer. All this being said, it was a great way to make use of leftovers, and I would definitely make it again, just with a few adjustments.

I tried this recipe with leftover turkey. It smelled so good cooking in the crockpot all day!  I followed the soup recipe as written  (except didn't use corn). There was WAY too much poultry seasoning. It actually turned the soup a greenish color and the flavor of it was overwhelming.  I think 1 tsp. would have been plenty. For the dumplings, I tried following the recipe as written but ended up having to add about 1/4 cup of milk in order to get the dough to stick together.  The dumplings were definitely too salty to eat. I wish i would have read other people's comments about the salt and poultry seasoniing before i made it.  It might have turned out better.  As it was, no one in my family of 4 liked it.

Great recipe--must cut the chicken seasoning as to make the soup less salty.  Also, the biscuit recipe is faulty--just use bisquick, or omit them all together.  Soup is still delicious!

Made it with a little less poultry seasoning like everyone suggested. The soup it’s self was ok I omitted the corn and added barley and turnip. The dumplings were very salty and the mixture was really off it needed a lot more liquid than 2 tbsps butter so I added 1/3 cup milk. Will try a different recipe next time.

We did try this recipe. There is nothing to "firm up" because it's the consistency of dry pie crust. 

I'm anxious to try a different version.

I had a recipe years ago for Turkey Dumpling Stew and I absolutely loved it. So, I went to allrecipes to find a great recipe! Sadly, this isn't it :( I read all the reviews and therefore only put in 1 tbsp of poultry seasoning and put the slow cooker on high for the last hour to cook the potatoes all the way through. Well that didn't even help.

This soup is good minus the dumplings.
