It was a very delicious recipe. I made it without doing anything different and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

I have not made this recipe yet but I wanted to point out to the other reviewers that the reason behind the different measurements of ingredients is most likely due to the fact that the magazine version serves 4 and this version serves 2.

I, also, saw this in the magazine and would like to know which recipe to try.  

This is not the first time I have encountered conflicting information between the website and the magazine.  There was a Copycat Broccoli Cheese soup that also differed.
