Awesome flavor! These were perfect for our Patty's day breakfast. I followed the recipe except some leprechauns turned ours green! My kids loved them and my husband said they melted in his mouth. These will definitely be tradition for us from now on. I served them with breakfast sausage, white cheddar cream eggs, and homemade hash browns. Thank you for a great recipe.

I added a splash of milk because I don't like my french toast too eggy. Also, I didn't have confectioner's sugar so when I put the toast on the griddle I sprinkled a little turbinado sugar and nutmeg on the face-up side, and when I flipped it the sugar caramelized, so the toast had a lovely flavor and crunch. This was delicious - the best French toast I've ever made!

Thank you sandhockey for a wonderful and perfect recipe. This was absolutely delicious. Made it for Sunday brunch and the next day for Monday dinner. I did not change a thing.

I made it for St Patrickâ€™s Day breakfast. Quick, easy and excellent, with the soft taste of Baileys

Simple and absolutely delicious just as written. I topped it with fresh blackberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and served with pure maple syrup. Brilliant! :)
