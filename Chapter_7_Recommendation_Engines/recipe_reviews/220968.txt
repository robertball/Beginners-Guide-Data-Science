I used reduced fat cream cheese and I did add some Frank's Hot Sauce and fresh ground pepper. My husband thought this was a little bland. Next time I will double the onions and chives. Other than that, the boys seemed to like it. As in, they inhaled the whole dip in 20 minutes. EXCELLENT way to use up leftover ham.

Super easy to make, delicious to eat! Very, very yummy :) I tend to eyeball measurements, so probably more cheese than required. I did initially loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil, then uncover it towards end of cooking.  I made the dip the night before, so cooking time was longer than stated because it was refrigerated...but well worth the wait!

I used the recipe for the filling as a dip with tortilla chips. I added chopped celery and baked in a glass pan for 30 minutes at 350.  This was a great way to use up leftover ham.

This was a hit at a casual dinner party at our house last night.  I prepped the dip the night before and stored in the frig until time to bake.  I had a hard time finding a round loaf of bread for some reason, so I had to resort to "Plan B" and hollowed a fresh loaf of Italian bread instead.  Even my dad, the "cheese hater", enjoyed this dip.  I found it a tad too rich, so I'll probably cut the cream cheese in 1/2 and use 1/2 sour cream if I make this again.  THANKS for the recipe, Danielle MacDonald!

Too much cream cheese and not enough seasoning. Tries dipping various foods in it and still didn't help. This is a good base recipe but I think it needs a lot of tweaking.

I used the filling to make crescent roll bundles, minus the green onion and chives. Yummy!  Half the recipe is enough for one can of crescents.
