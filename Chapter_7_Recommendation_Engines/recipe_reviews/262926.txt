I was so excited to try this recipe but  I got a burn notice so I knew then it did not have enough liquid. I added what I thought would be an ample amount of additional chicken broth and tried it again, after stirring  the stuck on bottom.  I got another burn notice and again, added more liquid,  (call me determined to make this work!) and stirred and scraped the  bottom of the pot.. Finally  got it to pressure and let it do its thing.

BY the time it was all finished, it had  basically turned to mush due to all my having to stir the bottom. It tasted okay, but was not pleasing to the eye.  

I will try this again but will make sure I at least double the liquid.

Same complaint as reviewer before me. I followed recipe EXACTLY. I kept getting a "burn" message because there was not enough liquid. What a pain. Had to transfer the whole mess to a stove top pot to finish cooking. And it is bland. Could cooks who submit such recipes PLEASE have them be kitchen tested? Or is that what us suckers are for?

Delicious - I do not own an InstaPot, so I made this recipe in a traditional high pressure cooker. It is a bit labor intensive but the end result is worth it.

I made this according to the recipe and the cooking instructions didn't work. I followed the instructions to the letter and I got a burn error because there wasn't enough liquid in the pot. I ended up adding two more cups of broth and still ended up with a burn error before my Instant Pot ever came to pressure.  That being said, it did cook long enough to get the vegetables tender and the flavor of the dish was OK, but a little bland.
