Good recipe. Tweaked it a little to suit our needs. I used whole tiny cherry tomatoes, added the avocado on the top of each serving (didn't want the cut avocado to get brown before we ate it), and added a bit of Old Bay seasoning for more flavor. Husband liked it very much. Leftovers were better the second day and I didn't have to cook tonight. I think this would also make a nice potluck dish. Thanks for submitting!

This is a very good summer dinner. I followed another reviewers advice and sliced the avacado on top and it made a very pretty presentation. I also added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to give it some zip.

I left out the mayo and bacon and instead used a lowfat bacon ranch salad dressing. This recipe tastes even better after spending a night in the frig.

This was good but the pasta was too much.  Next time i will skip the pasta and serve with lettuce on a baguette.

This was a big hit with dinner guests, and my kids.  My 9 year old even wanted the leftovers for breakfast the next day!  We chilled the plates before serving and this made it perfect for a hot summer night.

I've made this twice in a week.  I left out the bacon both times, I'm sure it's great with, just trying to cut out a little fat and it wasn't missed.  Fresh lemon juice is a must, it makes it!

I added a can of rotel tomatoes drained, and chopped black olives. I left out the bacon and cheddar cheese. I added crumbled feta cheese instead. I added about a tsp. of curry powder too. I rated it five stars with my changes. :)

Excellent just as the recipe is. I followed it exactly as instructed except I only used about 1/4 of the amount of mayonaise that the recipe called for. The whole family agreed it was a very flavorfull and healthy meal. I will surely make it again.

I made this dish for a group of 16, so I doubled the recipe.  In the future, I would use less pasta and no lemon.  Overall I think the recipe is a nice concept, but falls flat on execution.  Try another shrimp pasta salad recipe instead.

This is a great recipe. Very light for a summer meal. I added imitation crab to mine instead of the shrimp. I also took some recommendations from the reviews and added onion and mustard.  Very good!

Cut recipe in half.  Didn't add tomatoes. Added red onion, celery salt and dijon.   Served the avacado on top at the last minute.

Normally, I like to try a recipe the way it is written the first time but I needed a shrimp salad recipe and I chose this one because I had all of the ingredients except the pasta.  I planned to serve it over mixed greens that already had sliced tomatoes and green onions and didn't want the pasta anyway.  Just reading the ingredients in the dressing told me it had to be spiced up a bit.  I added Dijon, a little Kosher salt and garlic pepper to the mayonnaise and lemon juice and mixed well.  On top of the green salad I layered the shrimp, bacon, avocado and cheese then poured on the dressing, finishing with a good sprinkle of course ground pepper.  It made a nice presentation and was tasty enough to make again.

Tasty Pasta salad....I did not serve over lettuce. The crushed red pepper gives it just enough zip with the plain mayo base so all the other flavors come through...Hubby really like it.
Suggestions:
Don't forget to salt you pasta water
Put the avocados in the lemon juice called for in the recipe and they won't turn brown.

Remninds me of BLT pasta salad. Absolutely use oldbay on the shrimp. I'd half the mayo, or just add gradual tablespoons.  Next time I may use equal parts mayo & yogurt.

This was amazing and simple!!! I left out the bacon and didn't serve it on a bed of lettuce, but you can buy frozen shrimp already cooked and deveined and makes this recipe so simple, easy, and delicious!!!

This is a great recipe.  New cook here, thank you to everyone for some great advice.  One thing I did was increas the lemon juice and I used mapple bacon which REALLY kicked up the flavor.  I serve it a dish at a time and let the consumer add a little salt and pepper.  Next time I really want to add some mushrooms to it and see how it turns out.

Made this for BF and he loved it! I of course, made some adjustments for our tastes. I used a 12 oz box of whole wheat pasta, juice of one lemon, 4 slices of turkey bacon and omitted the crushed pepper.  I also didn't serve it over the lettuce...we loved it better this way. I salted/peppered to taste and added 1/2 tablespoon of Dijon mustard for some extra flavor. He's ready for me to make it again! :)

I made this a few nights ago and I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not a mayo fan but this was just enough to make the salad creamy.  I substitued orzo for the penne pasta.  It was very good.

This recipe was a hit.  I bought the shrimp pre-cooked and used whole wheat penne pasta and low-fat mayonnaise to cut calories.  I also used the advice of of two other reviewers and added a little dijon mustard and waited until the last minute to add the avacado.  Great dish!

Family liked it very much.  Didn't add all the pasta, and put the avocado on top in case we had leftovers.  Great.

Super easy fast salad to put together and a hit everywhere you go! I do add a little bit of pepper, salt and garlic salt for flavor.

Yummy! Next time will add a few stalks of fresh chopped celery. I didn't have any tomatoes. Will try that next time as well. I did add a bit of finely chopped red onion. Excellent!

I'm not too sure what to say about this recipe.  The first time I made it...wow, our mouths watered after each bite (we used elbow macaroni).  The second time was for our big feast on Thanksgiving Day and used the penne pasta but it didn't taste the same as the first time where we used elbow macaroni.  Perhaps it didn't turn out the same as we doubled the recipe...who knows.  I will make this again but will stick with the elbow macaroni.

For us, this was on the bland side as others have indicated.  I never use straight mayo as a dressing in a salad like this.  It's too thick and I think it overwhelms the taste of the other ingredients. I always use a mixture of mayo and sour cream, thinned with milk.  To this, I added Old Bay, celery seed, the red pepper flakes as well as salt and pepper.  Even after that adjustment it was relatively lacking in flavor, despite having a combination of many of my favorite ingredients.  After a few bites, I added a few sliced green olives on top - it helped, but I wouldn't include them in the salad itself.  I really can't put my finger on what exactly would make this a "good" recipe for me, but as this is we probably won't repeat it.

An enjoyable pasta salad where the lemon really gives it a fresh taste. As many have said this has a lot of mayo in it and it is very creamy from the avocado as well. I made two versions of it, one with avocado and one without and I actually preferred the one without the avocado even though I love avocado. If I make it again, I will decrease the amount of avocado and increase the shrimp and I will perhaps throw in some crab meat as well. Not the greatest but not the worst.

This was the most fabulous and different salad.  We loved it.  We cut the pasta and shrimp in half (used prawns)and kept everything else the same.  I can't wait to bring this to a pot luck or have as a side dish at a BBQ.

Rather than adding diced tomato, I cut the tops off of some tomatoes, used the insides in the recipe, and served the shrimp & pasta salad in the tomato shells. I stood the avocado slices on end, so they would do double duty as a garnish, along with a sprinkle of Litehouse Freeze-Dried dill.

I got the kids involved in making this one.  I did everything with the exception of the mayo, miracle whip instead (all I had).  Will try next time with mayo.  Had the girls shred the lettuce, cut the avocados and mix all the ingredients.  My oldest(7) asked and took it to school for lunch the next day.

Awesome! I did mix the dressing ingredients separately first before adding it to the salad.  Crushed red pepper looks like a lot but is the perfect amount! That plus the lemon juice adds a nice kick.

I skipped the bacon and used Monterey Jack cheese instead of the cheddar. Soooo good! Use the freshest (and preferably organic) ingredients you can find and this will not disappoint! I will definitely make this again and save it among my favorite summer recipes.

We just didn't like it.  The only substitution I made was exchanging chives for green onions (not a big deal).  It was too mayonaissey (sp?), and the flavor wasn't pleasing to us.

This dish is a great dish as is and as a base - just change some spices - cumin is quite good.  Scallions and slices green olives are nice additions. Have made similar salad using sea legs.

i made it one time and it was a huge hit. the only thing I did differently was i mixed the mayonnaise and lemon juice together first so that its was an even mix, then tossed it all together. everybody loved it so much that we skipped the lettuce and they all were eating it out of the pan. lol

I didn't use the lemon juice, and just waited to put the avocado on at the last minute, then seasoned with salt before serving. We loved it!

This was very bland so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little celery salt.  I also thought there was too much mayo (and I like a lot of mayo).  I will make again, but with less mayo.  This would also be good as a sandwich on a roll, without the pasta.

I just made it and it is really good. I didn't use the red pepper, so it was a little bland. I added garlic salt and pepper instead, just a couple of dashes of each.

Yummy.  Creamy and delicious.  Need to eat right away as avocado turns brown like an peeled apple.

This was better the next day, but I agree with some of the other reviews it was a bit bland.  Will make again but will use the avocado and tomato as garnish instead.

I know that a lot of people really liked this, but I found it very bland.  I even added a lot of seasoning to try and help it, but it never really came together well.  The only thing that might work would be to use a ranch flavored salad dressing in place of the mayo.

My husband loved this recipe, a lot more than I did.  I served it with hot bread and made a meal out of it.  It was light, but probably not something that I will make again.
