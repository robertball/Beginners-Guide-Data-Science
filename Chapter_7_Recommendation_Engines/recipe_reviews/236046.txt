As a person who cooks all my family's food from scratch I absolutely love the way this recipe is cooked.  No fuss or muss, I make a batch while doing the dishes so that I am right there to turn off the oven after 10 minutes.  Probably because of my high altitude, or a hot running oven I did have to adjust the cook temperature to 285 degrees.

I thought it was a little bland, so I doubled the salt and vanilla.  But since I found this recipe, I have found that this cooking method works on all the other granola recipes I have found as well, so no more babysitting granola in the oven for me.

Thank you so much poster of this recipe.  My family has really benefited from this.  They get much more granola these days.

This is an excellent recipe with lots of room for variation. For mine, I add chopped almonds, cashews, and flaxseeds, and I bump the salt up to 1/4 tsp. because salty granola is delicious. =) It's also safe to increase your vanilla to 1 full teaspoon, or to use 1/4 tsp. almond extract instead. Either way, if you keep pretty close to the original recipe, your granola will turn out great. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

Ok. This actually works! I was skeptical. It's an easy energy conserving way to make granola. I did substitute butter for the coconut oil and honey for the maple syrup. I also changed the oven temp to 350. My family loved it with their personal favorite add ins like raisins.

I used butter, increased the vanilla to 1tsp because it is so yummy and the rest was easy. All in my family loved this. And the bake for only 10 min then oven off and off to bed is great! Thank you, will be doing this with various modifications...

I'm making a second time right now! I didn't have nutmeg, so I added almond extract. I also added a little flax seed that didn't affect it at all but gives extra nutrition. It's just so easy and versatile!!!

What a great technique - bake for 10 min, turn off the oven, and leave it overnight!  This method works very well.  I subbed honey for the syrup (personal preference), added more nuts, and increased the wet ingredients by a half to get bigger clumps of goodies.  YUM!
