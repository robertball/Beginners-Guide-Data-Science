This recipe is scrumptious!  After looking at the ingredients, I knew I was going to love it.  It’s easy to alter according to your preference: I used an extra ½ can of black beans, frozen baby white corn (I microwaved it), and extra avocado.  I also made my own salsa recipe really quickly with lots of garlic and cilantro!!  One night, my family spooned it over hot baked potatoes, and we loved every bite.  We also have added chicken from the barbeque and a little bit of cheddar and put it over baked potatoes.  Dave, thank you for sharing your recipe that is now one of our favorites!

I didn't read the recipe properly before I made this one.  I just threw everything together in a bowl (minus the fresh tomatoe and avocado).  It tasted alright, but I left it in the fridge overnight.  The next day I added the avocados and tomatoes and the flavours had melted together and it was amazing!  Perfect healthy snack and especially great before I work out.  Thanks and I will make this one regularly.

I made a small batch just tosee if I'd like it  and I sure did.  The next batch I made full size, but as I was mixing the avocado with the cottage cheese I had 2 ideas.  The first was I mashed the avocado and mixed it with the small curd cheese until well blended.  Then I thought this would make a great wrap, so I heated the beans and corn with half the salsa.  I spread about 3 tbs of the avocado mixture on warm WW tortillas, spread the bean mixture over that and topped with a little more salsa and diced tomato. Absolutely delicious!  Great recipe!

This is the best recipe ever.  I made it for a Mexican party I was having and people couldn't get enough of it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I've made it several times and every time someone asks for the recipe.  I used a can of corn instead of frozen or cob corn and it worked out well.  It makes a lot, but it's so good it is gone in no time.  It is definatly a favorite.

While this is DELICIOUS I am a bit confused by the description which states it can be stored in the fridge for several days? I can't imagine anything with avocado not being disgusting after the 2nd day.

Yum! Some of my favorite ingredients all together. My proportions are different, it seemed like too much cottage cheese & salsa for me so I eyeballed it. A good quality (homemade) hot salsa really adds flavor. It's great, thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  This is going to be a mainstay around our house from now on.  It's great with chips or wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla (like a burrito) as another reviewer mentioned.  So, so, so good!

Yum! This stuff is great. I love cottage cheese, so didn't mind trying it out in this recipe. I didn't have any avocado, but it is still good without. I used it as filling for an omelet yesterday, it was fantastic! Thanks for the recipe :)

Perfect! Just what I was looking for. I omitted the corn and added a little garlic powder and sea salt and threw it all together without cooking anything. Just ate it out of a bowl without chips. Yum!

My co-workers and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I am giving it only 4 stars because of it's apperance.  I had to talk people into trying it because it was so unappealing to the eye.  I would definitely suggest added some lime juice to keep the avocado green.  I will be making again and trying to find ways to make it more visually appetizing. I can't imagine it would have been touched at a party if I weren't standing beside it suggesting it to people.

I really loved this salsa. You can adjust the heat by choosing different salsa. I also just used canned corn and left out the extra tomatoes. People are usually very surprised at how good it is because it doesn't look real appealing.

This was not bad and pretty healthy. I will make it again and tweek a bit. I used a small cluster tomatoes added an extra avocado and used pace. I mashed the avocado with 1/2 black beans and added to cottage cheese. I wanted to make it more dippy.

This was surprisingly good.  I will admit, it does not look all that appetizing, but it was definitely delish!

I added a few things:
*  lime juice
* olive oil & vinegar dressing (splash)
* Freshly thinly sliced serrano peppers

I like it with a bit of a bite.  Served with tortilla chips.

In the future, I may add to the recipe some refried beans to make it more of a thicker dip.

My roommates and boyfriend were incredibly skeptical when I first made this, actually so was I to some degree.  However, it was absolutely delightful!  I couldn't stop munching on it with tortilla chips!  I made a slight change by adding a handful or so of cilantro which was a nice touch and added a yummy extra zing to it.  I also just used canned corn, since that was what I had on hand and it tasted just fine.   I will be making this again soon!

While this was tasty.  It barley got touched at the party I brought it to.  My husband took the leftovers and put it on a wrap and made buritos with it.

I just had this for lunch, used low-fat cottage cheese, my homemade salsa, black beans and an avocado. Left out the corn and extra tomatoes. Was a great healthy lunch because I used a spoon...no chips...doesn't look so great. Very filling. Thanks Dave.

Yum! I cut the amounts back based on what I had available, left out the beans, used homemade salsa and a little salt and pepper to taste. I had some mexi-corn leftover and that worked great in place of the cob of corn. I think this recipe has a lot of wiggle room and it's very tasty!

Great idea; I wouldn't have thought to use cottage cheese this way. I just rinsed black beans and dumped right in and skipped the cooking part. I agree it's best to let the beans, salsa and cheese hang out together in the fridge awhile to develop the best flavor. Thanks!

Absolutely love it! The origin of the recipe invites changing it up based on what you have on hand. Definitely like it with fresh tomatoes, lots of cilantro and lime juice. I've added about half a cup of organic salsa when I was low on tomato and that worked, too. Usually settle for the quicker canned or frozen corn. It has been a huge hit at parties and pot lucks.

Really tasty!  I used a can of corn instead of fresh corn (I bet the Fire Roasted Corn from Trader Joe's would be GREAT!) and threw in some diced jalapenos from a can I had leftover in my fridge for some added flavor.  I agree with other reviewers who said it really needs to sit overnight for the flavors to meld together- it makes a difference!  My husband (who doesn't even like cottage cheese) and I had it on fajitas one night for dinner, I had it with some brown rice in a tortilla as a burrito for lunch, AND I used it as an omelette filling.  A keeper!

I think this was tasty; I only gave it 3 stars because I think it needs something. I think a diced jalepeno, maybe more beans, less cottage cheese... or more tomatoes perhaps. It could use some garlic, onion, cayene pepper, cumin.

Quick and awesome. I added some hot sauce because my salsa was just "mild". Very healthy alternatives to putting mayo. Next time I will two two avocados just because my family is a huge avocado fan.

Like it - I halved the cottage cheese, but still used a whole avocado, one tomato, most of a can of black beans, no corn, and only a few spoonfuls of salsa. Very yummy.

OK, so the ingredients were so weird I was totally skeptical. Read the reviews and decided to try it. OMG - so yummy. I can see using it in burritos and on baked potatoes if you can stop scooping it with chips. Thanks for the recipe. It is a real winner.

This really is gorgeous - unlikely but gorgeous! Very simple too, and will be easy to vary depending on what one has available. I made it as per the recipe but used frozen corn, dry-frying the kernels from frozen first (adds more flavour). We had it on baked potatoes last night, then I filled a taco for lunch and I've had to tightly cover the bowl to stop myself scoffing the rest...

Note to "looders" - I would bet your salsa tasted fantastic (how could blk beans & corn not?)  I'm thinking the main purpose of heating the black beans, etc. first would be as a safety precaution.

I have made this twice in one week and the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  It doesn't look great but it tastes fabulous!  My husband, my 5 year old and I were fighting over the last bites in the bowl.  The second time I made it I added little more corn, more salsa, an extra half can of black beans and an extra avocado.  Something in this mixture keeps the avocados from turning dark and it keeps for days in the fridge.  I've been eating it for lunch everyday.  This recipe is a keeper!

I liked this salsa.  It is not the most appealing looking recipe I have ever made, but tastes quite good.  I used one (14.5 oz.) can of mexican diced tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes. I used half the amount of cottage cheese, and about two teaspoons of taco seasoning, as it was a little bland without it.  I will make this again for a healthy snack/meal.

Oh Dave!  This is good stuff!  I wanted a dip that was half way healthy and this really hit the mark.  I did not change a thing and it was great.  Have made it about 5 times and most of those were when we had friends and family over because this does make a lot.  RAVE REVIEWS from all...one guy must have told me 5 or 6 times that "this dip is unreal".  Served with corn chips and Triscuits.  Used fresh home made salsa that I had on hand.

Good flavor. I used medium salsa and half the cottage cheese and thought this a bit bland to the taste; hot salsa would probably help.  We also found it visually unappealing, so I heated it in the microwave and added some shredded cheddar cheese to the top.  The health quotient went down a bit but the appearance improved a lot.

This is so delicious. I made this with leftovers I had from cottage cheese chicken enchiladas and black beans with rice- two recipes from this site. My husband and I are not cottage cheese eaters normally and we couldn't get enough of this salsa! I left out the avocado because I didn't have one and it was still great.

I like the concept but it was a little too bland for me.  I'm going to try it again with less cottage cheese and homemade salsa.  I gave it a 4 because I think it has potential as a healthy snack.

I used Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes and should have drained it better. Still, I enjoyed it on chips, wrapped in a tortilla, and on baked potatoes. I tossed the avocado with lime juice before adding which helped them not to brown, but I agree that it's still not great looking.

oh wow! what a genius way to incorporate such healthy things!!!! I looked at it and im not gonna lie, i was skeptical. but then again i was skeptical about everything with cottage cheese including omelettes and those were delicious. so i decided to try this (just mashed avacado, heated frozen corns, and quickly stir fried black beans with onions and some cumin with some garlic and pepper and mixed cottage cheese with it all with some salsa...turned out to be great!!!) It was a great snack entree! However, just not appealing to the eye but i felt at peace knowing i got my omega-3, protein, calcium, vit c etc :)

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  I made it nearly as written (I only had 24 oz cottage cheese), and it was bland...can't imagine it with another 8 oz!  This shouldn't surprise me because the salsa is the only real thing with flavor.  So I added 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of cayenne for some flavor and probably could have added more.  Now it's probably 4 star.  I'll keep playing around with the spices to make it 5 stars because I love the concept and the nutritional value of the ingredients!

Very yummy, healthy salsa!  The only thing that I did differently was add some lemon juice (to prevent the avocados from turning) and a handful of fresh cilantro .

This is sooooo yummy!!!!!   It was a big hit at the party I took it to.  That was once people got over the look of it.   It isn't the prettiest dish out there, but the flavor is soooo good.   I used low fat cottage cheese and only used a 16 oz container, which seemed to be enough.   I also added the juice of 1 fresh squeezed lime.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

Even though this recipe doesn't look that appetizing it tastes amazing. I had a party and everyone agreed that it looks bad but they all asked for the recipe after they tried it!! I added a little taco seasoning and it gave it a little kick.

I didn't have salsa, but I added a little ranch dressing, chili powder, and cumin. It was very tasty with a nice little southwest flair. Almost like a guacamole and salsa combo.
