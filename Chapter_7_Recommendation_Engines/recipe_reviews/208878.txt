i visited Israel in June and nearly every meal came with this type of salad, even breakfast!  even so, i have made this many times and usually emulsify the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt & pepper and then drizzle that over the mixed veggies.  blending it helps intensify the flavor IMHO.  a tip i learned in Israel is to grate the lemon peel of the lemon used.  again, the flavor is just kicked up a notch.  nice if you like lemon as I do. (7/11)
--so i made this and immediately ate a big bowl with a panzella cracker.  just super fresh, clean flavors, delicious. i used persian cukes & followed recipe exactly.  while licking the bowl it occured to me that chick peas and some feta would make it spectacular. and that second bowl was indeed. (oh yeah, fresh tomato was the only item i didn't have. i did have a can of muir glen diced toms but decided to wait until i put everything else together.  honestly, i thot it was perfect w/o them. i only drizzled olive oil as well.)

I stuffed this into a pita picket. I am thinking that it would be easier to manage if it was rolled like you would a burrito, as the filling would fall out if you just rolled it pita style. This was really good! The only thing, the garlic was a bit much for us, so next time I will add garlic to taste! Great recipe though!

Yummy combination of flavors. I loved the parsley, mint and lemon - so simple. Took a lot more prep time than I imagined it would - lots of peeling and seeding and chopping. WAY too much olive oil. I would at least halve it and drizzle slowly till you get the consistency you want. Too much salt for my liking too so I will play with that. Nice and refreshing and will definately make again though!! Served in a pita pocket with some cream cheese.

So good!  Don't make ahead though, I made the huge mistake of making this the night before and the dressing leached all the liquid out of the tomatoes and cucumbers and it was like soup.  When it was fresh it was fabulous.  If you want to do anything ahead of time, just keep the dressing separate and dress at the last minute.  I should have known this, but I wasn't thinking.  Definitely keep the mint, it gives a little something, you can't even tell it's mint, it just tastes herbal and good.

Just in case any one reading this recipe travels to the Middle East: This is widely known as Arabic Salad or "Salata Arabiya" throughout the Middle East, not Israeli Salad. It is absolutely delicious!

This was really good! Was surprised at the amount of cukes needed, but it ended up great! Substituted 3 Hot house for the roma. I served it with moussaka and a pumpkin bread loaf from this site.

This a great salad.  I added in shredded cabbage to add volume and crunch, and used only 3-5 graded garlics.  I only used a drizzle of olive oil and added more lemon than the recipe calls for.  I subbed dried mint for fresh and added in 1/4 of a chopped jalepeno.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Mmm I loved the mix of flavors!  My boyfriend had his in a pita with hummus and I kept mine as a salad, and we both enjoyed.  I liked this because all the ingredients were things I already had in...yay for convenience!  And deliciousness =)  Thanks Maslow

I've made this for years, usually for 4th of July or a late June family reunion and it's always a hit. The last few years I started adding in about a cup (2-3) mangoes, small-diced, and substituting the mint with cilantro. I like it this way even better as the sweetness of the mango goes perfectly with the acid of the lemon and astringent feature of the cucumbers. And I always make it the day before and then adjust seasoning a few hours before serving if needed.

Great recipe! Simple and delicious! I'd recommend less parsley and less mint leaves (unless you're crazy about them). It looked and tasted wonderful!

This salad is delicious, light and fresh.  It has a tad too much garlic for our tastes and it makes too much.  I will 1/2 the garlic and the overall recipe next time, but I'll definitely make this again.

Very good! My husband asked if he could have some for his lunch the next day :)  I didn't feel I needed 1/3 cup of chopped garlic, but I added 5 cloves, it was fine that way. I also thought 1 TBS of salt as too much, so I cut back the salt and pepper to probably 1/2 of that.

I always add back olives, leave out the mint and put a bit of red wine vinegar rather than lemon juice.

This was pretty good but my husband is a meat eater and the first thing he asked is where is the meat. So the next day we cooked up some pasta noodles and made some chicken and added it to the recipe. It was just fine the way it was but the added chicken and noodles was pretty good too.

This was a good salad - the only thing i would change is the amount of salt - next time i would try a tsp of salt instead of a tbsp.

I had the opportunity to visit Israel this summer and have been looking for a recipe for the cucumber / tomato salad that was so delicious.  This recipe is close but not quite as good.  I will have the try it again when cucumbers and tomatoes are ready in the garden.

I followed some of the advice in other reviews and used just a little less parsley, mint and olive oil.  I did use garlic infused oil, as I didn't have fresh garlic on hand.. results were the same....WONDERFUL !  Fresh, great taste... will make this again....

This is a great middle eastern classic that has been around a lot longer than israel. A great compliment to falafel, shawarma, and many other traditional Arabic dishes. Also great on its own.

I love, love, love this salad!  It is easily adaptable to individual tastes.  We add lime juice and smoked paprika for extra zing, or spoon it over romaine lettuce and add grilled chicken for a complete meal.  It is our new go to recipe for the summer! You can even cut the amount of oil by 1/3 and it still tastes great.  For additional color I added a yellow pepper.  You MUST try it.

this was very tasty.. topped over Indian Turkey Burgers With Lime, Cucumbers, and Chutney (from this site) and used it in place of the Lime/Cucumber/Chutney.. used sweet onion for the green.. and replaced with lemon as Vkruliko posted.. and tripled it.. had to use dried mint for fresh.. halved the olive oil and reduced the salt by about a third.. ty for the recipe

My husband really liked it.  The kids ate it.  I thought it was just okay.  I think I'm not much of a fan of parsley though.

Definitely my summer favorite! I make this repeatedly for pool parties. Be sure to peel and seed the cucumbers. I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and that is plenty. I now omit the red pepper and use garlic salt instead of plain table salt due to personal preference.  Very addictive and cooling when its hot outside. 
It makes a huge batch. I re-figured the calorie count and it is more like 55 calories per cup. Can't beat that for swimsuit weather!!

This salad has a fresh, light flavor. The mint was a bit overwhelming, so I plan to cut in half next time. Be sure to mix and toss in the dressing right before eating. The copious leftovers were a liquid soaked mess after a day in the fridge.

This is the second time I made this. It worked out better when I cut the salt and pepper back to a teaspoon each. I added the salt and pepper mix to the olive (or canola) oil and lemon juice mix.

I am giving this five stars because everyone at the pot luck I took it to raved about it.  It was not my cup of tea.  But I will say that the amount of garlic (that seemed like it would be way too much) was fine.  Maybe a little too salty...but maybe not!

this is good I shopped at farmers market so had to change to fit ingredients I could buy. NO FRESH MINT NOR PARSLEY, regular tomatoes instead of roma since I must go out tomorrow. only 1 Tablespoon of garlic. 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper: UPDATE I added more garlic and I added all salt and pepper required for recipe to salad dressing - awesome. I could do that as had previously made half recipe of dressing so made another half and put in half of all ingredients including salt  and pepper.  truly AWSOME I did add some dried parsley to dressing. I did not add dressing until needed as am using over 4 days and did not want to wilt before use.

This was good. My boyfriend was not a fan for reasons he couldn't explain just said he didn't like it. He doesn't seem to be a big fan of parsley but I thought it blended so nicely that he wouldn't notice. I on the other hand really liked it so in fairness gave it a 4.

I thought this was super yummy!  Really refreshing and healthy.  Easy to make.  I ended up using a a mixture of colored bell peppers for added color.  Only trade off is that I had garlic seeping out of my skin for two days.  Totally worthy it!

The mint, parsley and green onion all try to trump each other. These do not compliment each other in the slightest. And if you take away the battle of the 'greens' everything else is incredibly bland.

This is more properly called a Middle Eastern salad.  My Syrian grandmother Brought this recipe with her when her family immigrated at the beginning of the 20th century.   We ate it with garbanzo beans tossed in to make it a complete meal.

The classic is great.  But if you add kalamata olives and substitute the mint and parsley with basil, you get a great variation.

This is a great salad! I am not a big fan of cucumbers so I sub with peeled zuchinni and it is just as wonderful without the over powering favor of the cucumber! And I have used both cucumber and zuchini and it is still wonderful! Yum!

I made this quiche with sweet potatoes, not yams as shown in the thumbnail. I discovered while making it that I didn't have Dijon mustard. I mixed yellow mustard with red wine vinegar (no white wine vinegar available) and a pinch of sugar. Otherwise I followed the recipe and my guests and I were delighted! 
I made the quiche ahead, chilled it, and reheated it covered in foil at 350° for 16 minutes. It was only lukewarm throughout. The Surimi, Spinach, & Red Pepper quiche that I reheated along with this Rosemary Sweet Potato quiche was piping hot. I served the two quiches with Israeli Salad.

7.3.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/208878/israeli-salad/ ... 'Halved the recipe & maybe didn't quite halve it as it was kinda bland.  Seriously, it could just be my measurement.  I thought a third cup of garlic - full recipe - was yowza so decreased substantially.  The mint & lemon was subtle.  I subbed a jalapeno for the green pepper.  'Super mild so I wasn't on fire.  Thanks for asking.  ;D   Maybe by tomorrow I'll like it more; today, just okay.

This was a very refreshing, and not to mention healthy, salad! I read that salads like this are served in Israel with all meals. I didn't have mint on hand, so I omitted that. My olive oil was garlic-infused, but to make sure, I sprinkled a little garlic powder in. I also used sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. I had fresh parsley on hand from a plant that I recently purchased, so that made a little difference. I enjoyed this (scaled down the recipe) with seared scallops and a chilled white wine. Perfect meal on a hot summer night!

Delicious and savoury, if a tad salty, would recommend cutting that back slightly but otherwise a great dish.

This recipe tastes amazing when fresh, but it doesn't keep well.  Be sure to use it up immediately, otherwise it gets a bit of a sour taste, and the veggies start to disintegrate.

The recipe is slightly not accurate.  Ingredients of the salad has tomatoes, cucumbers, multicolored peppers, radishes, green or   Vidalia onions, green olives and anything you can think to add.  Add salt and black pepper. Parsley.   Mix it with olive oil and freshly squeezed lemon.  The veggies are cut into very small cubes. Similar to salsa.  This is served with all meals  am and evening, except big meals that are served between 12-3pm.
I have never seen garlic used with this type of salad.  At the cooked meals lettuce wth some vegetable and than garlic is sometime used.

Love it!  Just need to season with garlic, lemon, and olive oil to personal taste.  My daughter is doing the Whole 30 diet and this recipe came in very handy.  Thank you.

Very refreshing salad. I followed the recipe as printed but set the  oil, lemon, garlic, salt and pepper aside since I wasn't going to eat it right away. I'll make this again but will use English cucumbers and a bit less less salt.

Instead of drizzling over separately, I wisked the olive oil, lemon, salt & pepper together before drizzling over the veggies.  It seems to solidify the flavors better. 
But absolutely refreshing, delicious dish, all the same.

Delicious. Fresh. Takes a bit longer than 25 minutes though. Next time add crusty bread and make a panzanella. This time I added watercress. Filling and great.

The recipe itself is great and my co-worker loved it. I will not make it again only because I was not enamored of the mint.
