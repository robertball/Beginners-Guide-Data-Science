Don't be intimidated by this recipe if you have some experience with baking.  It truly makes excellent danish.  Here are my modifications:  Use your Kitchenaid stand mixer to mix all the ingredients for the butter-less basic dough, then attach the dough hook and knead, adding flour as necessary (about 6-7 minutes of kneading).  I did not use all the flour (I was short by about 1 cup as the dough was getting saturated and I did not want it to dry out or become tough).  Secondly, remove dough hook, remove dough from bowl, spray inside of bowl with non-stick cooking spray, place ball of dough back in sprayed bowl, and spray top of dough with non-stick cooking spray.  Third, cover entire stand mixer with a large plastic bag and allow to rise for about 45-60 minutes (or until dough basically is filling the whole bowl).  Those three steps right there take out all the work of kneading by hand.  I followed everything else to the letter except:  I made an apple filling by peeling 4 large granny smith apples and chopping into very small pieces, adding 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  I then placed the apple mixture on the stove on medium-high heat, added about 1/3 cup of flour, and allowed apple mixture to cook, stirring frequently, until the apples were soft but still held their shape (about 15-20 minutes of simmering).  I then took the apples off the stove and allowed them to sit until I was ready for them.  When I was ready to form the pastries, I took one of th

This recipe is somewhat complicated and probably not for the novice baker. But the result is out of this world. The directions are clear, easy to follow, and give a good idea of the amount of time needed.

This was one of the best danish pastry recipes I have ever tried!! I cut the recipe in half just in case it didn't turn out (hate to waste good ingredients) and did alter it just a little to be honest. I did use a non dairy margerine and water instead of milk but I had to for dietary reasons. I cannot imagine it coming out better though. It was flakey and light not greasy at all. The recipe called for lemon and almond I was a little eh about that so I used vanilla and nutmeg wich is really just a preference. I also gave the dough 2 turns and then left it in the fridge overnight giving it the last turn in the morning before rolling out. This is a sticky dough so please do not add more flour to it as that will make it tough. Instead flour the table or pastry board evenly not neccessarily generously when rolling. use flour to roll as needed but watch how much you use as with any pastry dough. I also like to brush off the excess as I fold the dough over to minimize the addition of flour. This should be a very soft dough. Also I recommend wrapping in parchment paper as opposed to wax paper. It will not stick as much.

Excellent recipe, though a lot of preparation time is needed.

I would suggest doing steps 1-3 the day before you want to make the danishes, then keep refigerated overnight.

If you like pecans you should try cutting the rolled out dough into 14x1 inch strips, cover with broken pecan nuts and maple syrup. Roll up strips and bake. When done, add a thin glaze of almond icing.

This is a good basic recipe. I like the simplification of the puff pastry dough method. 

To begin, I halved the recipe. For filling, I used one large granny smith apple, peeled and thinly sliced, ½ cinnamon, ½ cup sugar, ½ cup brown sugar, 3 tbsp. cornstarch, and ½ cup water. It cooked over low heat until thickened, then pulsed in food processor. I allowed it to cool while I made a cream cheese filling: 1 block cream cheese, 2 tsp. sour cream, 1 tsp. lemon juice, ½ tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. corn starch. 

Other than those changes, I followed the recipe. Beautiful pastries! The family loved it.

Thank you, thank you for this wonderful technique!!! I'm one of those people who rarely follow a recipe exactly. In fact, this time, I used my own dough recipe but wanted to leave a GLOWING review on how this member explained on adding butter & rolling out the dough to make a real Danish pastry.

I've made puff & Danish pastry before but not much as I find it too labour intensive. Placing tiny bits of cold butter on the rolled dough & then folding & rolling, endless number of times got to me.

But the idea of mixing some flour with soft butter, rolling it into a thin layer, made cold & then used is BRILLIANT! I laud the person who thought of this.

I made my pastry today & am so happy with the results. I used a home-made mix of ground roasted almonds with baked mashed apples, raisins, cinnamon, sugar & some butter as a filling. I dare not make this too often as it tastes so good but is so rich.

I arbitrarily decided yesterday that I wanted to serve pineapple danish for this morning.  I had the frozen pineapple  to make a filling, just wasn't sure on the pastry.  This is definitely a more sophisticated recipe then many but it works well and is scalable.  I used about a quarter of most ingredients and used one envelope of dry yeast.  Worked like a charm.  Wife loved the result.  If you haven't been successful with this, print out the recipe and read it carefully.  Slow down.  Chill the dough a bit longer.  Don't forget to roll the dough out and fold it extra times.  On your final roll make sure you get it down to 1/4 inch.  Don't forget the rise after you fill the pastry.  It will double - it really will especially if you set it on the stove with the oven on (or recently on).  Good luck and good pastry!

This makes a tasty danish, but, in my opinion, is a little too labor intensive to make it worthwhile.  It was yummy though!

This is a super recipe! I had a little over a cup of flour left over that was not needed, my dough was great and easy to work with. I also didn't have active dry yeast on hand, I only had instant yeast, so I used a little more then 3 1/2 teaspoons and they turned out perfect. Made some with Strawberry Preserve, and some with Confectioner's Custard and some with chocolate chips, then drizzled them all with confectioners' sugar and water. I will be making this recipe again and again...

I finally made Danishes after years of wanting to but too afraid to take the plunge! I'm happy to say that my fears were unfounded. These rose beautifully in the oven, were light and fluffy, and tasted great.

However, I did run into a couple of problems, which I will chalk up to inexperience. First, I couldn't get the dough to stay in the shapes that I *tried* to form. Second, the bottoms of the first batch burnt, while the tops were just barely done. I lowered the temp. to 425F for the next pan but the bottoms still began to darken before the tops were baked through, so I switched to "broil" for the last little bit, which worked well. My oven tends to run very hot so next time I will either bake them on a higher rack at 425F or lower the temp. all the way down to 400F.

Very good!!   4+ labor intensive but worth the effort. The trick of mixing the butter with flour and rolling out between waxed paper is sheer genius.  Gives much better butter distribution than the traditional way of putting hundreds of little pieces of butter on the dough and rolling.  This makes it foolproof. Thanks for a keeper!

Excellent recipe, though a lot of preparation was needed. After making the dough I rolled it out and cooked apples and sweet cream cheese in the center and then let rise and baked it.  I took them to work all of my co-works loved them.

I halved the recipe, since it was my first attempt.... and actually made the dough in my food processor.
made half of that into 9 croissants and the other half I made 8 danishes with raspberry preserves and glaze... The croissants are quite good, but the danishes hit the "to die for" mark. My only goal now has become to make sure I do not eat them all before I can serve them. lol

Okay, so I begin by saying I am a novice baker, so don't hold it against the recipe.  I didn't like the taste (too much almond) and it was dry.  I spent a lot of time on this and was disappointed.  I had to scramble to make another dish at the last minute.  Not my favorite

Walking around my apartment with my chest puffed out now. I just made a DANISH PASTRY! Do NOT be intimidated by this recipe. While it does require time, the actual hands-on time is rather small because you have to be quick when you're handling the dough and butter for the turning/folding parts. Mixing/kneading takes the usual 10 or so minutes, after that you work the dough for less than 5 minutes at a time, then it goes to the fridge for a half-hour. Do laundry while the dough rests. I halved the recipe, and only used 1/4 of my dough for my first batch (made 6 cream cheese danishes). I understood the directions well enough but I was apprehensive, so I watched some "Baking with Julia" videos over at PBS. There are at least 3 very good videos on danishes, puff pastries, and croissants which use similar (though cold-butter) methods that provide a good visual for technique. Good that I did because the creaming method wasn't working very well for me (too creamy), so I froze my butter batch for about 20 minutes then beat it into a flat rectangular sheet. Only hiccup, but there's always more than one way to skin a cat... Give this recipe a go. If it doesn't turn out perfect you'll still feel like you learned something. And I am sooo going to adapt this for some savory puff pastry recipes.

First time trying it and it was great. You can freeze the dough and use only what is needed at the time. I have now adjusted to half servings when planning it for the weekend treat.

I found the instructions to be inadequate to the task. Admittedly, I am not an expert baker but even so, I didn't understand what I needed to do until I watched a video on YouTube. The butter squished out of the dough when I tried to roll it out and created a giant mess, despite returning it to the refrigerator repeatedly in an effort to keep it cold. Overall, I would never attempt this recipe again.

I'm 17, so although I love baking I don't have a ton of experience. This became abundantly clear to me today, since during the majority of this baking escapade I felt like I was being beaten over the head by a frying pan- primarily due to my lack experience and apparently lack of brain cells. I screwed up this recipe in more ways than I can count, or at least care to admit! (I could almost hear the ingredients crying "what did I ever do to you?!"). Yet, by the grace of all that is holy, these Danishes were actually delightful despite the fact that half of the dough had to be THROWN OUT (Note to self: don't put sticky dough on wax paper and then attempt to get it off because that is a battle you just will not win). Basically, do a couple practice runs if you're not familiar with baking Danishes before you make these for some big event! However, these are defiantly worth a try, especially if God's face smiles upon you and they actually turn out okay! ;)

Wonderful, flaky pastry.  I used it to make my own version of a "butter braid".  My family loved it.  As others have said, the recipe is involved, but I was able to get 4 large braids out of it. I baked one immediately, freezing three and all were delicious and rose nicely.  I only altered the amount of almond extract to 1/4 the amount as a personal preference.

I thought that this was a great base to work off of.  I made strawberry and stawberry-cheese danish, and they turned out to be wonderful and tender.  The only suggestion I have is to make sure you start with small portions of dough when you are making something because when it rises and bakes, it grows!

This was a great recipe, but alot of work. I took one reviewer's suggestion and did steps 1-3 one day and the rest the next day. I brushed a combination of brown sugar, cinnamon and softened butter on dough before cutting into strips. Found the recipe on Crumb Boss website. I drizzled a vanilla glaze on danish. They were a big hit. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is time consuming but worth every minute. I have made it four times already, I use fresh cherries or berries tossed in a light simple syrup for the center so it is not too sweet, I also like to add a spoonful of homemade pastry cream. I would recommend it, if you have patience, it will pay off.

My husband said these were the best danish he'd ever had! Lots of steps, but worth it. Makes a wonderful, flaky pastry. I filled mine with cream cheese. I used vanilla extract because I was out of almond and they turned out great.

What a fantastic recipe.  Exactly what I was looking for.  My only mistake was not sandwiching my butter sheets between two separate sheets of wax paper.  I made a tower of wax/butter/wax/butter/wax.  Needless to say, it was nearly impossible to peel easily.  Still won and got the butter off, but not in one solid plank.  Now I know for next time!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is a time consuming, but the finish product is wonderful.  I will make it over and over again as my family loved it. The idea of creaming the softened butter with the flour and then folding it into the dough was a great tip. I used my large kitchen aid mixer to do the kneading.  I tried several different folding techniques.  The dough is easy to work with. Thanks Cindy!

I find that adding a little mace, taking out a little almond extract and leaving out the lemon makes it really tasty.

The only problem I had was, after rolling a few out, I got to rolling them much closer to the thickness of store-bought pastry sheets. Those hardly rose at all. The ones I rolled to 1/4" (as instructed) were light, airy fluff bags. Great recipe.

While being a novice at baking but refusing to give up, I tried this recipe. My danishes turned out wonderful but I did notice (probably because I'm a novice) that they weren't all that light. A bit dense but absolutely WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to try making them again.

This was my first attempt at making pastry dough so I was very careful to follow the instructions as carefully and accurately as I could (I even made cutouts to compare my dough and butter). The dough came out exactly the way I wanted it to: flaky, visibly layered, and buttery. I ran out of almond extract, though, so I had to substitue vanilla. That said, the almond was pretty much all I could taste. I think next time I'd substitute both extracts with vanilla. I made a simple cream cheese filling I found on this website, but it didn't go too well. It was too rich, and that combined with the flavor of the pastry was a little much.. I think a fruit filling would suit them better.

I made this and filled with homemade almond paste for bear claws. Also filled with a cheesecake mixture and strawberry and blueberry preserves. People said they were better than any store bought pastry. Admittedly I am a advanced pastry chef, but I dont think this is a difficult recipe.

I did have some concerns when the butter started leaking out while I was rolling it out, but after a few folds everything turned out great, and I filled half with jam and half with pastry cream and fruit.

these made beautiful danish i put nutmeg in it and it paired amazingly with apples. I squirted simple syrup on them at the end of bake time and put them in the oven for one more minute. They are better than most danish. Alot of people pull frozen ones out of boxes. A factory danish is no competition for a real baker.

I am an experienced breadmaker, did my best to follow this recipe to a "T".   Had a hard time with the butter breaking through the dough when rolling out the layers, maybe just need practice on that part. I left in frig about 45 min between rollings.  I cut the strips narrower because the dough was raising while I was cutting them and they were awfully large at 3/4".  The recipe did not say how many it should make. I got 15 but the last was small.  I baked them for 8 minutes at 450, they were not even close to being done. Baked another 3 minutes and 30 seconds and removed them, thinking that they HAD to be done by then.  Mistake.  They were still doughy. In looking at several other recipes, instead of 8 minutes, it is saying 18 minutes

This was my first time making a pastry from scratch and I was overall happy with how it turned out. I read through the instructions ahead of time and followed them closely as I was making them. One thing I did different was I put the dough back in the fridge after each roll and fold because it was a hot day, so I was concerned the butter would melt, but it didn't :) I made the dough one day, placed it in the fridge overnight, and shaped and baked it in the morning. Overall it took me roughly 6 hours. For the shapes I made pinwheels, diamonds, spirals and braids and for the filling I used raspberry jam and made a cream cheese custard. I topped some with berries and chopped nuts. I would make this recipe again for a special occasion!

Very time consuming to make but well worth the effort. The danish is light and flaky almost like a croissant. I filled them with a cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla mixture and topped with some strawberry filling. The family went nuts over them and will become a new staple on the holidays.

Absolutely delicious! These turned perfectly flaky, this technique of incorporating the butter made things so much more simple than any other I've seen. I hand mixed the flour and yeast with the milk mixture, then used Suzanne's suggestion of using my Kitchenaid with the bread hook attachment to knead in the rest of the flour. I also needed a few more minutes bake time, but overall an excellent recipe. These go wonderfully with a classic cream cheese filling and a blueberry sauce. I was worried it might no turn out well due to the difficulty, but it wasn't so bad, just time consuming. Definitely worth it though.

I will write a review when done but I wanted to thank reviewer Michelle Berger. I would have added more flour because my dough was a little sticky  and I used the whole 8 cups  :)
This is so delicious. Rolling the butter out  in the dough is ingenious. To shape I rolled the dough to about a 1/2 inch thick and created 2 butter braids. Filled with cheese filling, recipe on this site , by pokey-turtle. Froze one and baked the other right away at 325 for 20 min. Perfect and well worth the effort!
This Recipes creates 2 huge butter braids. Next time I'll make it into 4 normal sized butter braids just before step 5  :) The frozen loaf thawed in about 8 hours and raised perfectly for baking!

It's the first time I made bread like stuff, the dough was really sticky. Is it usual or I missed a part?

I cut the recipe in half. This recipe makes A lot!
Its a bit labor intensive. Before the final flip and roll I placed in the fridge overnight. Rolled and cut in the morning. The dough itself isn't very sweet. I recommend a glaze on top at the end. It rises perfectly! A little denser than I wanted but very good! Next time I will sprinkle sugar on after the egg white glaze!
