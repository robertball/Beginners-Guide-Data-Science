So tasty!  I liked that this was a lasagna recipe that didn't include ricotta (not my favourite kind of cheese). There are few enough ingredients here that most people people will have these all on hand.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and hubby loved it. No, he raved about it. This is now one of our favourites!

Just a quick update -- This is the 4th time I've made this dish, but I found a time-saver that really works great. Instead of using dry lasagna noodles and having to boil them, I bought oven-ready noodles (which are fresh noodles) and this cut down on the time needed to cook everything. I just rolled the filling into the noodles and popped it all into the oven. Excellent! Turned out better, too!

--- Another update (July 30 '10): Made this meal ahead of time and froze the lasagna rolls - it turned out excellent. I made the rolls as per my instructions above and froze them (without the sauce). When almost ready to use, I defrosted them in the fridge for a day and put them in a greased pan, poured the sauce over them and cooked for an hour at 350 degrees. Perfect. Will make these in batches and freeze for later use. Thanks again Philadelphia!!!

Very delicious and easily modified. I love adding mushrooms, red peppers, italian seasonings and basil to the mix to give it a little more flavor (and vegetables). Adding meat to the sauce also works great because it adds more protein and makes it more filling....

I have been making a very similar recipe for years. The only difference is I add 1 egg to mine (which I think makes the filling a little more firm and less runny.) I also make it into one big roll. I have always gotten rave reviews on mine but was looking for a way to make individual servings to bring to my work Christmas party. This recipe totally fits the bill! Thanks so much for submitting a recipe that is EXACTLY what I'm looking for!

This was excellent. My entire family loved it, even the 2 year old couldn't get enough. I did add mushrooms and garlic to the sauce. I also only had whipped cream cheese, which worked just fine. It was seriously delicious and really pretty easy. My vegetarian husband said to give it 5 stars..so did my 7 year old. Bam. Going in the recipe box.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and added almost a full can of seasoned collard greens (what I had on hand). My 7 year old loved helping roll up the lasagna noodles. All three of my children loved it (almost unheard of)! Fast, easy and delicious!

followed recipe exactly except added some garlic powder, basil and orgeno to chs mixture.
turned out well, made just enough mixture and rolls were perfectly shapped and didn't fall apart.  next time I might use half amt of cr chs and use 1/2 amt of ricotta - cream chs made it too heavy and there wasn't enough of an "italian" feel.  will also use fresh spinach instead of frozen.

This was just ok for me.  It needed more seasoning.  A little bland for my taste.  I will make again but add more seasoning.  My mom thought it was great.

This was decent. The kids wouldn't touch it, but my husband and I thought it was good enough to eat the left overs the following day. It needed more seasonings -- garlic, basil, oregano -- something! I even used homemade spaghetti sauce, and it was just okay. I let the spinach thaw out in the fridge during the day, and it was still cool after it cooked. I would definitely thaw and bring to room temperature if I do it again. Also, I only had about 2.5 oz of cream cheese, so I added some ricotta instead because I like the texture. Maybe that's why it was so bland? Next time I would add more of the spices required for a lasagna to make it a more interesting dish.

Tried this one and went exactly by the recipe and it was great! Even my tween, who "doesn't like" spinach ate it up :) I made a couple extra lasagna noodles, in case they stuck together or tore, and ended up using all eight noodles... which was a good thing, because they ate every one!

Good basic recipe. I added chopped onion, garlic, red/yellow/green peppers, and zucchini. It was even tastier after sitting 'til it was only lukewarm.

This was delicious!! I added grilled shredded chicken breast and some seasoning. It made 6 rolls and my 14 year old ate 4 in one day1 He then turned around (on facebook) and requested I make more same day. My best friend was also there to taste then and she went home and made them for her family. Thanks this is a sure keeper!

Added toasted Pine Nuts & fresh grated Nutmeg to filling; sprinkled dried Turkish Oregano to tomato sauce prior to baking; otherwise used recipe as detailed.  Became a Gourmet hit at the dinner party!  So easy, worthy of time and effort.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make! I did add mushrooms which tasted great, and I also substituted low fat cheeses in place of full fat.

Very tasty recipe-I did not have lasagna noodles so I spread the cheese mixture on top of curly pasta and made the pasta into a casserole but the cheese mixture was delicious and used my homemade sauce-Even the kids ate it!

This was tasty, easy to prepare, and surprisingly healthy, actually. I have been searching for a while for vegetarian recipes that are both yummy and low-cal (surprisingly it can be difficult to find non-fattening vegetarian entrees). I used light cream cheese, low-fat mozzarella and fat free cottage cheese and took the calorie count down to about 250-275 per serving, which is really amazing considering typical meat lasagna is around 800 per serving. I think lasagna rolls are better this way because you only eat one noodle with each serving, which means you only get about 75 calories from the pasta. Instead of topping this with spaghetti sauce I used alfredo sauce (prepared from a mix with skim milk and no butter) because my boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes. I think I would have much preferred marinara sauce and it would have been even healthier. Overall a great, easy, nutritious recipe.

I made this recipe but first I sauteed fresh spinach, garlic and red peppers in a small amount of oil and seasoning then I continued to follow the recipe.  It was very simple and flavorful!

I made a few substitutions... I used philadelphia original cooking creme in stead of cream cheese, I also added pepperoni and fresh Italian seasonsings and some garlic of course and fresh spinach. It was AMAZING!!!! could only eat two, and my husband (a pig when it comes to Italian cusine) could only eat three because its VERY rich and extremely filling. It was a very pretty dish, and well worth the mess, I will be making again in a larger batch because they make great leftovers!

This was okay.  I did not have cream cheese so used ricotta instead.  It's very plain.  I added garlic powder, oregano, and italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  I think I would have preferred regular lasagna.

This is excellent and easy. I chopped fresh spinach to the mixture instead of frozen. I also added a pinch of Italian seasoning and garlic salt. I only had slices of mozzerella so I layed them out then spread the spinach cheese mixture. YUMMY

Wasn't too sure about the cream cheese in this recipe (I usually use ricotta), but I actually liked it better. I doubled the cream cheese, added 2 eggs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and some salt and pepper, and it came out perfect. Everyone loved it, and I love how neat it is to serve (not messy like regular lasagna that usually gets all mucked up when I cut into it!). Next time, I will use this method for my Chicken Alfredo and Broccoli lasagna. This was so yummy AND more cost efficient because of the cream cheese vs ricotta :)

Used no cream cheese (ran out). Just sauteed seasoned mushrooms and zucchini, lastly added spinach. Spread the mixture along with sauce on lasagne strip. Rolled up - topped with tons of sauce to completely cover and cheese. Heated in oven covered in foil, after cheese was melted broiled the top.

I doubled the recipe and added onions, peppers, carrots, and used fresh spinach (I don't like the texture and flavor of frozen spinach). I also added Italian seasoning as well as salt and pepper. If I make this again and am feeling particularly sinful I will omit the veggies. I think just cheese on its own would be best in this recipe.

What a wonderful and EASY dinner! I'll definitely be making this one often.  The only modifications I made were slightly reducing the amount of spinach (I used about 3/4 of a 10 oz. package) and adding some garlic salt and italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  It was out of this world.  One of those recipes that makes you excited to eat leftovers for lunch the next day.  I boiled a couple extra noodles in case I needed them but this made exactly enough to stuff 6 noodles.  Next time, I'm doubling the recipe!

I made the sauce for this recipe from scratch instead of buying the spaghetti sauce.  It was a variation of Annabel Karmel's hidden vegetables pasta sauce.  My kids unwittingly had red and yellow bell pepper, carrots, tomato, and spinach in a single meal (mwahahahaha) and this is the first recipe I ever made that all family members really really liked (I am generally a terrible cook so thank you so much for this recipe).

I made it this way and it good.
Then I changed it and it was 10X better.
I added fresh spinach (instead of frozen). I added Mild Italian Sausage (remove skin and cook first). I use Ricotta Cheese instead of cream cheese. 
Everyone loved the changes...so I keep making it my way.

This was delicious and a hit with everyone, even the toddler! I added ground chicken to the mixture (1/2 pound) which was great for flavor and protein. Would definitely make it this way again!

Made these as a new addition to our family Easter buffet. They went like hotcakes, with requests for the recipe; which I happily shared.  I'll definitely make again, if for no other reason than I only got a wee taste off my daughter's plate...She's not generally someone who shares... Followed recipe to the letter. Well, might have added a few chilli pepper flakes to the sauce to add a little kick to the rolls??... My sister, the non-pasta lover, is still raving about this recipe and that speaks volumes!!!

This is outstanding! My husband does not like ricotta cheese, so the cream cheese was a great alternative for us. It was just so good and easy. I made two pans of these, one with spaghetti sauce and the other with garlic alfredo sauce. Both were delicious!

I was very surprised at how flavorful this turned out! I used fresh spinach, sautéed with garlic n' oil. Also I only used about 1/3 jar of the sauce instead of what it called calling for. It was SO GOOD!

I've been making these for years...a big hit at our home! The only differences are that I use 6 oz. cream cheese and end up using the whole bag of mozzarella cheese between the filling and the topping. Delicious!

Very , very good and simple!!  Instead of using the 4 ounces of cream cheese , I used 1/2 cream cheese & 1/2 ricotta. I also sauteed some sliced mushrooms with minced garlic in a lil bit of olive oil & added that to the roll. Everyone enjoyed this easy & very yummy dish! Will b making this one very soon again!!

I liked this.  Easy and forgiving recipe.  I didn't have quite enough spinach and it was more than enough.   I also threw in a little Italian sausage I had.  Could possibly try a little more cream cheese next time?  Will make it again.

Great recipe.  To make life easier you can buy the oven ready noodles and boil for a minute or two to make them pliable.  Makes it so quick.  I add roasted red pepper and it adds even more flavor!  Husband LOVES it and it's great left over.

This was a huge hit at my house! I changed out the red sauce for white though because it's what we had on hand. I ended up needing 7 noodles instead of 6 though.

Excellent Recipe!  My wife is very picky but really enjoyed this!  Very easy to make, just be sure to let the cream cheese come to room temperature or soften it first the way the recipes calls for.  Also, I ran some cold water over the noodles after draining them to cool them off and help them to not stick to each other.

I changed the stuffing cheese to ricotta cheese because I did not have any cream cheese.  It was a great hit with husband, loved them so much he ate two right away.  Next time I try it I will do half with cream cheese and half the ricotta cheese and see which one tastes better. We enjoy heavily spiced foods, so when I make it I add more vegetables and seasonings to the stuffing.  I think almost any stuffing choice will work with this recipe. I buy fresh noodles and do not pre-cook them, I roll stuffing around noodles, cover with lots of sauce and bake.
