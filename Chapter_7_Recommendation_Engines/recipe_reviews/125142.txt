Great simple recipe!!!  I needed something quick and easy and this hit the spot!  I cut the recipe in half as it was only for 2, and added some shredded asiago as well as the parmesan to the top.  The tarragon flavor was wonderful, it really brought the dish together. My husband raved about it.... I will definately make this again.

This was quick & yummy, & even my picky boys liked it! The tarragon made it very fragrant. I might try a little sherry in the sauce next time, just for a little extra zing.

Also, I would just note that four good-sized chicken breasts yielded about the right amount of chopped chicken.

i love this casserole. i don't usually have half and half so i almost always just use regular milk and i usually use a little more cream of chicken soup to make it creamier (one family sized can as opposed to two regular cans). i really love this dish!

This was a good dish to make during a busy work week!  My family enjoyed it.  I cheated and saved more time by buying a ready cooked chicken from the grocery store!  I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 to cut down on calories.  Tasted great!  It was super fast to make and something my son and husband (both don't cook) can do without me being home.  And for that this gets 5 stars!!Thanks!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I've never used tarragon before and was quite pleased with the outcome.  I used the cream soup base recipe from this site instead of the canned soups and I added some garlic powder and used ff milk, it was wonderful, will definitely make this again.  This recipe fit in my 9x13 pan

This was extremely bland.  I would try it again, but I'll add vegetables and more spice, perhaps just regular ol' salt and pepper.  Maybe sun dried tomatoes.

This is the 2nd time I have made this recipe. This time I halved the recipe. Cooked some chicken breasts and thighs with the "boiled chicken" recipe on this site. I added some of the chicken stock to the soup so the casserole would be moist not dry like last time. I did one teaspoon dried tarragon and 3 tsp. fresh tarragon. The recipe turned out great, next time will add some mushrooms.

I have made this recipe a few times for my large family of 8.  I of course make the recipe to serve about 12 people.  My family loves it and it is so easy to make.  It tastes amazing, and there are so many ways to change it up a bit.  The first time I made it according to the recipe... but then I got the idea to add pees and carrots... and make it more like a chicken pot pie but with noodles.  It was delicious both ways!

Was very delicious!  I cut the chicken and pasta back a bit to make a more 'saucy' dish (used 2 large boneless chicken breasts cubed and 1/2 lb pasta).  I also added some breadcrumbs to the top with the parm cheese.

I'm going to try it with seafood!  Excellent recipe.

An easy, delicious dish! My mom used to make this all the time. I got hungry for it and searched this site for it.. made it for the first time myself tonight. Incredibly easy to put together, very quick and inexpensive. It tastes great reheated too!

This can be a very simple dish to make.  I boil the chicken ahead of time and cut it.  Then when I get home from work, I cook the noodles while I am mixing the other ingredients and pop it in the oven.  It has a wonder flavor and my daughter loves noodles.  I think the noodles give it a spin on the typical casserole.  It has become a regular at my house.

I liked how it was super easy to make.  Next time, I think I will saute some onions, peppers, and mushrooms so it can have a little bit more flavor.

my family did not enjoy this casserole and i believe it was mainly due to the tarragon. I have never used tarragon & actually had a hard time finding it in the grocery stores for some reason. I think I would make this casserole again but substitute the tarragon with another seasoning. Maybe add some vegetables as well.

My sons loved this recipe.  I used bow tie pasta and I think when I make it again, I will use the 12 oz bag instead of the 16 oz bag.  I added garlic and some onion salt and I think I will add fresh mushrooms next time also.  But- very nice flavor and consistency!

I know tarragon is in the title but I found out I was completely out when I found this recipe. So, I used 2 bay leafs in the water when I boiled my pasta and added parsely instead of the tarragon. I also used 1/2 of 2% milk, as I don't keep half and half on hand. WOW! Was this gooooood!! This is one of those great recipes that you can add ingredients and it's just as good!  I did add tarragon to my grocery list; for future use!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is very good. The family really liked this. I made it for six servings. That called for one can of soup. Well, the next time I make it I'm going to add another can of soup.

This was OK, I did like the tarragon for a change of pace. I had some trouble with the proportion of the sauce. I was going to cut the recipe in half but when adding a cup of half and half to a can of soup it was VERY thin. So I added another can of soup and that was perfect with 3 c of chicken and 8oz of pasta. We all liked this recipe but it wasn't anything to write home about.

This turned out great, although the first thing my husband said was "this isn't very healthy".  Maybe next time I will try to lighten it up.  I halved the recipe, and used cream and milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 because that was what I had.  I did add a little bit of wine, onion salt and garlic powder.  The chicken was left over from a roasted chicken that I made from this sight (it was awesome too).  I also used more tarragon, but my spices are pretty old so they didn't have much flavor.  Overall, a great dish for leftover chicken, quick, easy and tasty.

I added 1/2 chopped onion and 2 tsp garlic powder when cooking the cubed chicken. Had to omit the noodles as I didn't have any. I added some bread crumbs as a topper. Not too bad but sweet. I'll add fresh garlic next time.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The tarragon sauce is subtle and just right with the pasta.  I substituted linguine with egg noodles and topped it off with shredded cheese.  My boyfriend had seconds and thirds, and that doesn't happen very often!

This was pretty good - I sauteed onions with the chicken and added peas and used bow-tie pasta.

Good flavor, but a bit dry to my taste. Would cut back amount of chicken slightly next time.

Easy and tastey. I used a deboned rotisserie chicken. Reduced terragon to 2 tsp. Made me think of Olive Garden.

Super easy and everyone liked it! Can't go wrong. A touch of sweetness to the flavor.

I tweaked this just a bit. First, i boiled 6 chicken thighs in chicken broth, seasoned with pepper and just a pinch of tarragon.  I added 1 soup can of chicken broth to make it a bit more saucy. I also added a bit of garlic and pepper to the mix. And i topped it off with a mix of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago.

We made it as directed and it was very good.  The tarragon flavor was really tasty.  Reheats nicely for leftovers.

If I was rating this based on how easy it was to make, I'd say 4 stars but I thought this recipe was extremely bland.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  It could also be because I have never been a huge fan of tarragon with chicken.  The minty flavor of the tarragon just doesn't mix well to me.

I didn't really like this recipe. The tarragon was a bit overpowering.
