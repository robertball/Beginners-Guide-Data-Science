This is amazing...I never knew a non-mayo slaw could be so good.  I'm watching my calories, so I substituted egg beaters in for the yolk and 1/3 c. 1% milk in for the half and half, and it still turned out great.  Thanks so much for the recipe - it's a keeper!

This is the best cole slaw recipe! I also added an extra spoon of sugar.  After it came out of the fridge, I poured it over a bag of precut cole slaw foud in the produce dept. and instant PERFECT cole slaw. I will never buy the store made stuff again!

This was the first time I have made coleslaw dressing from scratch (I was too lazy to go to the store!) and it was great! Everybody really enjoyed it...more so than the store bought dressing. I didn't have half and half on hand so I used half whipping cream and half whole milk instead.

This was a very good recipe.  Next time I make it (and I will make it again) I'll increase sugar to 4 tablespoons.  Just a personal preference.  Thanks, Letha!

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for! Everyone loved it and I didn't change a thing.  You can make a double batch and freeze half.  Defrost in frige and you are ready to go.

Very simple to make! I added celery seeds, a bit of salt and pepper, and mixed it with broccoli slaw. I let it sit for six or so hours to marinate a bit, it was very tasty!  What's even better -- is that this recipe has ingredients that are *always* around the house, so there's no need to ever buy slaw dressing again!

This dressing was great!! My daughter who doesn't like  slaw had seconds. I made this with broccoli slaw. I didnt' have half n half so I used heavy cream and I did add some celery salt and celery seeds just because I seem to like them in my slaw. Thanks Letha this will be my only dressing for slaw from now on,

I never made a cooked dressing like this before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  When the recipe said "boil until thick" I was confused since it never became what I think of as "thick".  I suppose one egg yolk will only do so much thickening.  In the end, after reducing by about 1/4 it became what I would call "coat a spoon" consistency.  Still very liquid, so I was worried I failed somehow.  After dressing a slaw and refrigerating I think the consistency turned out to be just right.  I didn't add additional sugar as other reviews suggested since I don't like things too sweet.  I like this slaw dressing better then any others I've tried so far.

This dressing was excellent!  I substituted sugar for splenda and used 1/4 cup of skim milk and 1/4 cup of light cream.  I don't like mayonnaise cole slaw dressing, but this was light and creamy!  It reminided me of my German grandmother's cole slaw that I have long since forgotten!  Thanks

Never made dressing before and this came out awesome! Even my horribly picky boyfriend liked this dressing. I did add  a little bit more sugar like others have. This recipe is a keeper.

I normally make a vinagrette type dressing for my cole slaws and my family prefers this.  I have just made this recipe and I am glad I did.  It is delish!  I tweaked it by using a tblsp of organic mayo instead of raw egg and used it for a broccoli slaw with craisins and pecans.  mmmmm!!

We didn't are for this one at all probably because of the mustard.  I like some cole slaw so next time the mustard is out. If you don't swing you'll never get a homerun.

This was my first try making my own cole slaw. The dressing was very good, although I dont know if I let it get thick enough. I might have also used too much cabbage with it...I will try this recipe again!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is probably a very good recipe.  I must have done something wrong, because mine never thickened.  It tasted good, but it wasn't thick at all.  I will give this another try though.

Easy to make and delicious. I was concerned about the amount of mustard and the flavor was a little strong when I tasted it.  However, when poured over the cabbage and allowed to sit for a little while, it was perfect!

It was delightful to find this Cole Slaw Dressing from the "Old Country". Decades ago I had tasted it, but did not know how to make it. I like to add, that I used "Essig Essence" (a german vinegar)the dressing tasted authentic and my family just loved it. Thanks for posting, you made my day.

Nice. A sweet and sour. Reminiscent of Penn Dutch style. The key to this dressing is to not bring to a boil too quickly and whisk constantly. Make sure to reduce the liquid before allowing it to cool. When making this dressing again, I will double the quantity for better coverage of a bag of coleslaw mix. Chill the coleslaw.

Cole slaw came out great! I did substitute agave for the sugar and added a teaspoon of ms dash for seasoning

This was pretty good. Coleslaw dressing is the only dressing that I don't make at home, so I thought I would try this one the see if I could make something  better than bottled. This didn't quite hit the mark. It was a little too vinegary and not thick enough, so I will keep looking. Thanks!

Maybe I've forgotten how coleslaw dressing tastes like?  Too runny, too tangy,

Yummy and easy.  Was enough for one bag of cole slaw mix.  Next time I will drain well before using on a Bar-B-Que sandwich.  Might add some celery seed next time.

my laptop battery died before I could read all the directions so I threw all of it in the pot at the same time... it wasn't as thick but it was still awesome
I used Dijon mustard and it added a little more tang :)

I made this dressing for a broccoli slaw to go as a side for grilled hot turkey sandwiches (also from this site) and it was okay.  Modifications used were increase sugar to 4 tbsp and used a tangy dijon mustard. It was a bit runny; but tasted better the day after, once it had time to settle with the slaw.

I never tried Cole Slaw dressing before, so I cant compare it to other Cole slaw dressings. But it tasted great, I like the texture too. I used an apple cider vinegar because I didn't have a white vinegar at home. It was still good.  I use it for a chicken salad.

It was very tasty!  I had about a half cup of cream cheese left over, doing nothing, so I threw that in as well . . plus a squirt of lemon . . less mustard next time.   I’m quite pleased with the way it turned out . . not any better necessarily, just a little different ..

To limit carbs, Swerve (granular) substituted for sugar. Despite my ability to read, the egg yolk wasn’t added until the other ingredients except the half and half had reached boiling temperature (201F at my altitude). The pot was cooled in an ice bath to less than 100F and the egg was whisked in. Still being impatient to see thickening, another tablespoon of Swerve was added. The pot was again cooled, the half and half added and whisked in. Tasting suggested adding sweetener (a mistake), and the result was 10 ounces of too sweet dressing, but it was tasty. The only carbs were in the half and half, about 4 grams. The taste: reminiscent of Mennonite sweet mustard.

Made this tonight and it was really good. Mine never got what I would consider “thick”, but it did finally get to the consistency that would coat the back of a spoon. I did add pepper to this recipe - we like pepper in our slaw. And, because I didn’t have half & half or heavy cream, I substituted whole Mike and it cane out fine. I increased the sugar by one tablespoon as suggested by another reader, however when I make this again, I will increase by a total of two tablespoons. All in all, great coldslaw dressing recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I did not like this dressing.  I don't know how it went wrong but with all the 5 star reviews it had to be something I did wrong.  I didn't have white vinegar and had to use apple cider instead.  Maybe that was it?    I had such high hopes for it.  I love cole slaw but don't like any of the dressings I've ever made.  Gave it 3 stars since it isn't the recipe author's fault .

This is delicious! I did make one change, I substituted fake sugar for the real sugar and it turned out wonderfully. 

Thanks for the recipe!!

This did not work out for me at first, with lots of tweaking I made it work in the end. Next time 1/4 cup of each vinegar and cream, let egg mixture cool a bit before adding cream, seasoned with pepper and onion powder.

Excellent, simple and most importantly, the wife loved it. I did make it as listed, and agreed that it was just a little too sour, so I added one more tablespoon of sugar. Perfect! Served over shredded lettuce, julienned carrots, and one sliced, hard-boiled egg.

This is a terrific recipe. I do not usually eat coleslaw because I don't like mayonnaise, so when I found this non-mayo version I wanted to try it. It's delicious, tangy and not too sweet. Now  make coleslaw all the time!

This was pretty good. It's different than the super sweet store bought stuff, but I like it. I did double the sugar. I used grey poupon mustard. Probably shouldn't have because it over powered the recipe a little.

Good, but a bit to much vinegar.  Next time I'll probably use apple cider vinegar, and cut the vinegar down to 1/4 cup.

I also wanted it a little thicker, so I added a spoonful of arrowroot powder (cornstarch substitute).

I made this recipe as written. It thickens slightly as it boils. When cool, it's thick. It covered a small bag of cole slaw mix from the produce section of the grocery store. I had enough left over to freeze in a Ziploc bag for another time. It was vinegary...just like I was looking for.

I made this by chance after searching different sources. I remembered it having an egg in it. I had not saved this recipe. I wanted to use it again because it tasted very good and was exactly what I had hoped for on my slaw. So now I've saved it to my favorites!!!! Great!
