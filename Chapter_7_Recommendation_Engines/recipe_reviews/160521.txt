Good, but I felt like it was missing something. Then I remembered that the one I made before had guacamole. That's the missing ingredient.

I always make this, but put the refried beans, then mix the taco seasoning with the sour cream, then salsa, lettuce, tomatoes, green and reg onions, chilis, olives, and cheese. I have also thrown in black beans with the refried beans. YUM. I have even added some rice super yum! Always flys off the table!

Yummy!!!! I made this for a little get together at my boyfriends house- I should have made a double batch! It was gone in no time and everyone wanted more!!!  I used homemade Salsa which I think made a huge difference! I made it like the recipe, only I didn't use olives, and added some Picco on top- I also served with chips. I'll be using this recipe allllllll the time =)

Awesome dip! I brought it to a girls night out at a friends house. People couldn't get enough!! If you have 2 cans of the refried beans the rest of the ingredients would make 2 dishes since everything else you only use half of (cheese/ sour cream).

This is my go-to party dip. Now that I've started making everything from scratch and using more organic products, I make my own refried beans, taco seasoning and salsa. I also now use fat free or reduced fat sour cream and 2% shredded cheese. I'll tell you, it's always the first thing to go. Always. I had one guest come to a birthday party and really get ticked that I didn't make it. NOTE: I don't serve this with crackers, I serve it with tortilla chips. I highly recommend the Refried Beans without the Refry for your refried beans from this site.

I was skeptical at first because this recipe seemed too simple.  No avocados, no expensive ingredients.  But it is DELICIOUS.  I just made it, so it hasn't even had time to set, and I've already eaten far more than one serving.  I will make it all the time, since the ingredients are cheap and the recipe is quick.

Totally a big hit on the camping trip!! I made the day before we left and for supper the night we got to the campgrounds, whipped it out and we had a nice appetizer while the hamburgers were cooking. Nice and cool for a hot day!

EZ & cheap, guests ate it over the "store bought 7 layer dip" that another guest brought to the super bowl party. I didn't think it was so great.

I made this and it was hit! But! as someone mentioned before, there was a missing ingredient, and I agree....guacamole is the missing link. I didn't have time to make it fresh, so what I did was just slice some avocados up and added it on top. It made it look pretty and it was eaten within the hour! I do think if it wasn't eaten that fast, the avocado would've oxidize, so be careful.
