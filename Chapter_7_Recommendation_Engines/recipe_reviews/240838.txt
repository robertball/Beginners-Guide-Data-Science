Followed the recipe exactly using fresh lobster claw meat. These were good but I felt they were lacking something.  Maybe some sort of breading in the stuffing?  I would make these again but with some alterations.

I've had many of jalapeno poppers and these were to die for! I really liked that this recipe didn't call for cream cheese like most do. I used imitation lobster since the real deal is a special treat and something I only get once a year at best. I can only imagine how awesome these would be with the good stuff.  I already cannot wait to make these again!
