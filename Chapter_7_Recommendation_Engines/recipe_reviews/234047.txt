I didn't have quite enough sugar for 1/2 the recipe, but went ahead anyway (with about 3/4 cup). I thought my dried Bing cherries were bland, but the little touch of vinegar added the tartness they needed. I made 11 tarts, muffin-tin size; they were plenty sweet, and really tasty.

Far too much sugar. Too much cherries. They were nice.  I think it is the toffee that makes it.  May make it again.
