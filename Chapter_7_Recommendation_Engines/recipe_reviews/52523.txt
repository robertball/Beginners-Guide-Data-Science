This was awful.  I am sorry but the flavors just didn't mix well.  I also think the medium heat setting is too hot because it got very thick even though I stirred constantly.  I made this for our Easter ham dinner and just didn't serve it because it just didn't smell, look or taste edible.

This recipe was awful by itself. I reduced the vinegar and doubled the brown sugar.  This made the recipe pretty good and just a lite taste.  Without the changes the recipe was something that would kill the grass.

i altered the recipe a tad. Added more brown sugar, used fresh pineapple and put it all through the blender (omitted the raisins and I didn't have cornstarch).  But it all was great basted over ribs on the BBQ. Just have to keep an eye on it so the sugar doesn't burn too fast over the flame. Next time I might add garlic.

This is a great basic glaze recipe!  I don't like raisins, so I left them out.  And I didn't have pineapple juice so I used orange, and it worked very well.

Less corn starch should be used to make it thinner. I used it on top of pork chops which worked very well.

I used apple cider vinegar for this recipe, and it seems to work better than other types. It does seem to thicken quickly, but orange juice solves the issue easily.
