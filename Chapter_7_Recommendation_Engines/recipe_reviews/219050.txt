I loved this recipe.  How can you go wrong with black beans?  I used green onions and red bell peppers instead of green cause I like the sweetness of them.  Other then those I would not change a thing.  Thanks Cindylee

It's good. But as a side for a hot dish, I think it's too cold. Next time I'd probably take it out and let it sit for awhile before serving with my main dish.

Mmmmmmmm!!!  I did NOT use salsa, instead I made my pico de gallo: Diced Tomatos, Diced Red Onion, Garlic, Cilantro, olive oil mixed with this recipe, put in a sealed container, shook, and put in fridge for an hour.

I agree with a previous reviewer in that I think this is better served room temperature.  I used peach salsa and fresh frozen corn and no bell pepper (not a fan).  I added some fresh cilantro.  This is a good side dish!  Thanks.

This is also great if you add a tablespoon of cumin and chopped celery and a bit of cilantro.

This was so easy and good.  If you like cilantro add it, I think it made it so much better

The first recipe on this site that came out terrible.  Flavors were all wrong.
