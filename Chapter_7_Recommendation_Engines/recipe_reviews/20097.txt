I submitted this recipe with Spike brand seasoning mix as one of the ingredients, but Allrecipes changed it to "salt free seasoning". I highly suggest using Spike, which is not salt free, instead. I usually put in basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and thyme as well. Also, the cornstarch need not be mixed with 1/4 cup of water -- a tablespoon or two, mixed together with a fork or whisk, is plently.

We didn't feed this to any kids, but we did feed it to a very picky Brit, and he loved it, as did we! This is a great, healthy vegan substitute for alfredo. We tossed this sauce with angel hair and seared portabellos. We added extra sea-salt and a dash of thyme, which seemed to really round out the taste and give it a robust flavor without overpowering the mushrooms. Excellent. Worth the tiny bit of extra time it takes to make it.

I agree that as-is, this is a pretty flavorless recipe. Prior to trying this I made a similar version without the block of tofu and came up with essentially the same thing. In both cases I increase the nutritional yeast to at least 1/2 cup, and add lots of garlic salt and some ground mustard. That usually gives it a more flavorful and cheesy taste which my vegan husband and I love : )

I made this to go with the sweet potato gnocchi and it was great.  However, I used vanilla soy milk instead of plain to get the sweetness needed to match the pasta.  Also, I added 3-4 packets of turbinado, a little oregano, and garlic salt to add to the flavor.  It turned out amazing.  My husband, who is not a vegetarian, had no idea that it was not a completely fattening and unhealthy cream sauce.  It was wonderful with the pasta.  I even surprised myself with how good it came out (I was a little concerned after looking at it in the blender!) -- who knew you could make an amazing cream sauce with tofu and soy milk!!!  :)

This sauce is great mixed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Except we never used the dill when we tried it. Overall, this is one of the best vegan recipes I have found, and I was very happily surprised to discover how much like cream this sauce tastes.

The best vegan cream sauce I've tried yet. I agree needs a bit of spicing up. Sautee portabellos in garlic and olive oil, then add finished sauce to the pan of mushrooms. The jiuce from the mushrooms gives a hearty, salty flavor that is great. I followed someone's advice to add 1/2c nutr. yeast, and it worked great. Plus salt, cayenne, hot sauce.

I used this sauce (minus spices) as a substitute for heavy cream in the Cajun Chicken Pasta recipe and it was fabulous.  The hot spices zipped this right up.

I LOVE CREAM SAUCE! i've been experimenting with how to do a vegan cream sauce for a few weeks, and this recipe is it! the tofu is a wonderful base! It can easily be spiced so follow any non-vegan recipe. You've just made my life better! Thanks!

Was good, but only after I added salt.  It had no flavor before that.

I used only 16 oz tofu pureed with garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley, salt, pepper, paprika, and sundried tomatoes. No soy milk or any other ingrediants.  warmed it in a pan and tossed it on tortillini with chopped fresh spinach and sauted zucchini.

followed additional instructions, and this came out wonderfully. not exactly like traditional, straight-up cream sauce, but like "a creamy" sauce. i used vanilla soy milk - oops. still came out great; also used spike, which is a great seasoning, but left out the dill (personal perference). i know that i will continue to tweak this a bit, and use it again and again. thanks, from vegans and lactose intolerant sauce lovers everywhere!

Sadly, this did not work in our household. I am lactose intolerant and deprived of all foods rich and creamy, so I had hoped this would work out.  I even used real butter and doctored it up.  I did eat my dinner, but I didn't eat any leftovers.

Excellant substitute for alfredo sauce.  I would add more parmeasan cheese though.  It tastes a little dull without it.

great, except that the uncooked garlic was much too prominent.  sautee the garlic first, then add to the blender.

Never use thyme in it.  Gross.  But other than that flavour it was good.

This sauce may not be very flavorful, but when you add salt and pepper on you plate, it really pops.  I used nutmeg as my non-salt spice, although I think the cream sauce needs salt, because it does lack flavor.  I used more than what the recipe called for, for dill, because I like the flavor of dill.

This sauce is a good base, but I agree as it is written it is pretty bland. I added extra spices and some cheese and it really perked it up.

I can't believe how goooood this is!  I really outdid the spices (because a few other reviewers said it was bland). Make sure you use SPIKE brand for the seasoning. I served it over zucchini pasta - this made it low-carb, low-fat, xtra healthy. YUM! Oh, at the suggestion of another reviewer, I added tomatoes, mushrooms, canned but drained artichoke, and some fresh spinach. I just dumped these veggies into the pot when the sauce was heating. Yummy! I'm so happy.

Really good recipe! I left out the dill but add carrot, peas and corn that had been sauteed in vegan butter and garlic. I added the veggies in right before the corn starch so they had a few minutes in the sauce.

YUM! i didn't have any tofu on hand, so i left it out and instead added extra nutritional yeast for creaminess (used half a cup as suggested by other reviewers.)  I made way too much pasta and halfway through cooking i decided to cook up a second half batch, which was just enough for a whole box of pasta.  I used whole wheat pasta which normally is a little dry and this sauce was really creamy and worked great with it.  Because i left out the tofu we browned a pouch of boca crumbles for protein.  i also used some left over veggies that i had; a mix of corn, peas, green beans and carrots. My boyfriend loved it, and so did i.  with the boca crumbles it almost had a beef stroganoff flavour, something i haven't eaten in YEARS. Cannot wait to try it with mushrooms.

Great texture and very easy, but lacks the spices to make it really good. Maybe garlic and cayenne pepper?

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and added a few teaspoons of sugar. It really does make it taste more like a cream sauce because dairy is slightly sweet. I also added 4-5 large marinated mushrooms because they were in my fridge....and ooooo, SO GOOD!

We plated this up for our 13 yr. old son and his friend without telling them what it was. They were both REALLY into it. I got compliments. That's right, from teenage boys. It was great. I changed a few little things: I used 1/2 cup tofutti sour cream and 1 cup soy milk (bc I had some s.c. to use up). I also nixed the dill and added fresh basi, salt, & pepper... Holy delicious, Batman! A very versatile recipe-- I'm thinking of adapting it for vegan fondue, nacho cheese sauce, mac n' cheese... yum. I would've taken a picture, but it was gone before I could get to the camera :)
