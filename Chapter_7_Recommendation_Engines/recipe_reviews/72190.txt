This recipe is really yummy I served it with eggs but used left over corned meat (not the canned type) which I think added to it - I have also made this replacing the grated potatoe with mashed - that was even better

These were great! Thanks! I grated some cheddar cheese on top, which improved them.

My GirlFriend made this dish while I was at work. She said they were nice and crunchy when they came out of the oil. However, when I got home 4 hours later, they were soft and not very good looking. However, I found out today that they are very good tasting when put on a saltine cracker with mustard, green onione slices, and lettuce. I enjoyed them as a snack and will get my GirlFriend to try them this way, and we will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I need to make these again.  I used a reviewers recommendation to use mashed potato instead, but found the results more conducive to a casserole dish layered with muenster than to a frying pan.  It fell apart and disintegrated in the oil.  The bit we did put in the casserole was good  but needed more seasoning.  I'll do it again with grated potato and then will repost.

was a little wetter than i was expecting or hoping for, but once i got it into the pan, was great!
the temp of the cooker and the time are directly related...... it took me a few tries to get it right, but it turned out GREAT! :D

I made some by the recipe and then added some cheese to the rest as another reviewer suggested.  I did like them better with the cheese.  I think they would also taste better being served along side sunny-side up fried eggs.  These were OK.  However, I don't think I will make them again.

Not too special.  Just reminded me of corned beef hash out of a can.  Won't make again.

Didn't work for me at all!  I was so disappointed.  the pancakes didn't even try to hold together.  I followed the recipe so I have no idea what the problem was.  The product I ended up with wasn't  very good either.  I'll just stick with corned beef hash out of a can.

My Mom always made these for us 7 kids when we were growing up and hers were delicious! I have 4 suggestions:
1. To remove liquid from shredded potatoes, place them in a salad spinner and spin dry.
2. Add 1 - 12 oz Can Corned Beef, instead of 1/2 can.  
3. For extra seasoning and a crispy coating ~ Mix everything together, roll into golf-sized balls, flatten into patties and generously coat each side in seasoned bread crumbs before frying. 
4. DON'T fry them in so much oil, it makes them soggy!!!

I used leftover colcannon and left over corned beef from St. Patty's Day and they were delicious. Because I used leftover potatoes I had to add about a 1/4 of flour to stiffen the mixture up.  Thanks for the lovely leftover idea!

This wasn't bad but it wasn't good. Texture was wet, corned beef flavored potatoes really. Will not make again.

These are reminiscent of corned beef hash patties we make in Hawaii. Just one adjustment, when you flatten like a pancake, it only needs to cook 3 minutes per side.

It tastes great, but it didn't form into pancakes at all. I doubled the green onions and omitted salt.
