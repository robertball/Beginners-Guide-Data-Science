This was great.  I added a little red bell pepper for color and a pound of baby shrimp with the last broth addition.  It was a great Valentines Dinner for my husband who loves risotto!

I made this dish exactly as written, with the suggestion of adding cream. The flavors compliment each other well, and the dish was a hit at my dinner party! Thanks for the recipe

This was good, but needed some more seasonings.  I used a pound of crabmeat and thin asparagus to ensure it would cook quickly.  I added salt and pepper and cream with the cheese to make it creamier.  If I made this again, I would probably saute the onions with some garlic for more flavor.

Even though it takes about 40 minutes to prepare, this recipe is VERY easy. You literally just stand by the stove, stir, and occasionally scoop in additional broth. I'm currently in Italy and made this recipe in a 5'X 5' foot kitchen! I didn't have asparagus or crab, so I substituted mini shrimp and broccoli, and it was great! Even better on day two when all the flavors congealed. I will definitely be making this again. It would probably be really good w/ chicken in it too. It's a great base recipe.

I never made risotto before and it came out delicious!  I added 2 cloves of garlic, a little Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper while cooking the onions and peppers.  I like my asparugus "well done". I added them after the onions and peppers were cooked so they wouldn't be too crunchy.

Really good, needed a bit of extra seasoning (which is why I only gave it 4 stars).  Will make again, great base recipe even the kids loved it!

This was very, very good.  Only thing I did differently was to roast the asparagus first - roasting gives it so much more flavor.  This recipe is a real winner!!  Thank you.

Not worth the effort. It tasted fine but I didn't think it was anything special.

This risotto DID turn out well, but not amazing. I did not make any changes to the recipe.

Easy and quite good.  Would add another colored pepper, maybe red for variety.

another great version of risotto. I must admit though, I prefer adding one cup of white cheddar or asiago over the parmesan. This is also good with grilled red onions and the asparagus.

A very nice basic risotto recipe. I didn't have wine so just used a bit of extra stock. I also cooked the asparagus first in a griddle pan to soften them before adding with the crabmeat at the end. Lovely combination of vegetables and crab plus flavours. Could also have perhaps added some fresh herbs at the end (parsley?).
