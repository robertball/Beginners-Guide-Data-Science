Hi! I'm Mary, the person who sent in the recipe. I read some of the reviews and I hope people understood that the onion dip used is the ready made kind that you buy in the refigerated section of the grocery store. I use an 8 ounce container. It is not the dry soup mix.

I made this casserole yesterday (with a couple of changes), and it was delicious!  Instead of the onion dip, I combined a package of Ranch Dressing mix with an 8-ounce carton of sour cream and sprinkled the top of the casserole with French-fried onions in lieu of using the margarine.

I opt. for 8 oz light sour cream vs. the onion dip.  Also use light cream cheese and cut the butter down to 1/4 a cup...I have had it all different ways, very yummy and much faster than cubing/boiling etc!

Love this! I'm weird- I like instant mashed potatoes better than real! So I knew I had to try this recipe. After reading the reviews, I decided to use 1 1/3 c. milk. It worked out great. Baked 30 min. I also used my electric mixer to blend the cream cheese mixture, as well as after putting it all together. I might try the sour cream/onion powder thing next time to make it totally smooth. But it's terrific the way it is!UPDATE: I used 3 cups of water & 1 1/2 c. milk this time. I also put the dip, eggs, & cream cheese in the blender to make it smooth! Even better this way!

My family couldn't get enough of these potatoes! I sub'ed sour cream for cream cheese as some others did and used prepared onion dip right out of the dairy case at the grocer. I thought it would make the dish "soupy" but it didn't and the potatoes weren't dry as some others mentioned. Added a sm. can of french fried onion rings (crushed) to the top, melted butter and poured over. Delish! Next time I'll make sure to have cream cheese on hand. I'm anxious to see if the potatoes come out creamier. Thanks, Mary. This is a keeper!

I made this recipe for a large family Christmas gathering. It was very good and everyone kept going on about how good it was.

The only bad thing...the recipe calls for one "PACKAGE" of onion dip. That confused me and I accidentally bought a small package of the "make your own dip". The recipe should read...1 8oz "CONTAINER" onion dip.

Other than that, it was a great hit and I'll make it again.

I've made this several times now, and it never lasts long.  Rather than 8 oz. of onion dip, I just use a 1.5 oz. packet of dry onion chip dip mix.  This is a delicious side dish, thanks for the recipe!

Since I was doing all the cooking this Thanksgiving, I wanted to save time on preparing somethings so I chose this recipe...NOBODY knew they were instant mashed potatoes and I didn't mention it until dinner was finished...I did make a couple of changes though, instead of cream cheese I used sour cream and I didn't have any soup mix so I just omitted this step...they were still delicious!  A Keeper!!!!

Awesome new way to make mashed potatoes!! Just be sure that the baking dish is well greased as it tends to stick but overall very tasty! Next time, I'm going to double the recipe so we all get our fill!! Thank you Mary and your mom!!

oh my gosh.  SO GOOD.  i doubled the recipe, and here's exactly what i used:  2 c milk, 4 eggs, 8 ozs french onion dip, 8 ozs white cheddar bacon dip, 8 ozs lite cream cheese, 8 ozs lite sour cream, only 1 1/3 sticks butter (instead of 2 whole sticks), 4 c water, 6 c flakes, 2 ozs bacon bits, 2 tsp salt.  i put it in a 3 qt dish & was concerned it might puff up a lot and spill over, so i put a little in a bowl & microwaved it to see if it'd puff up - it didn't puff up.  of course i tried it, and my husband & a friend of ours, and we all thought it was PERFECTION. thanks so much for the recipe, m. ellen!  UPDATE: made again with light butter & fat free onion dip (and had to add bacon bits!) and it was still delicious.  not as great a texture as the original way, but still REALLY good and will definitely make it again this way.

Have been using this recipe for several years and use the recipe as is or I use several variations w/the dip flavors.  We love all types, but our favorite is using White Cheddar and Bacon Dip - and I add some bacon bits and some shredded Vermont White Sharp Cheddar.  Dee-lish!!  And if you want to be really BAD - a little bacon grease.

I've made this twice now and am making it for Thanksgiving. The first time I used onion dip in a packet, but didn't care for the chuncks of onion, so next time I used Ruffles onion dip in the jar and it was perfect.

We didn't have the onion dip, but substituted one package of onion soup/dip mix with a 8 oz of sour cream.  We also added 1/2 pack of real bacon bits and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar on top.  DELICIOUS!

Very quick and easy and quite tasty. Feeding just two for supper, I halved the recipe, but rather than using half a container each of cream cheese and onion dip, I just used one whole (8 oz) tub of the Chive & Onion Cream Cheese. Added about 1/4 cup of bacon bits too. I will definitely make this again. It will probably be on my holiday side dish list since it can be made up ahead.

Made these for dinner tonight, lucky for me my SO is a good sport about new recipes.  I followed this recipe to the letter, and it turned out awful. Was way to soupy. I will add more Potato Flakes and freeze these and try again another day.  Don not think I will be making these again.  Sorry Mary, I was so looking forward to these after reading all the great reviews.

I have made this so many times and it alwasys turns out great.  I sometimes use 8z sour cream (instead of onion dip) then I add 1 tsp. of onion powder or 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  I also use a stand mixer before I pour everything in the casserole dish and it turns out very smooth and creamy.  Everyone loves it and it is so easy!

I took this to the family dinner yesterday.  It was very good.  A change from regular mashed potatoes.  I didn't put in all of the milk it called for because the potatoes seemed to be very thin.  But next time I will use the amount it calls for because after it bakes it thickens up,  Also I didn't add salt because the onion dip seemed to be salty enough. Wrong again.  Make this dish exactly as it is written and you won't be disappointed.

I don't even like instant mashed potatoes & I loved this!!! I didn't have any onion dip on hand, so i substituted onion soup mix and added extra milk. It turned out great. Next time i will make it with the dip, and see how that works. Definately a winner!!!

I think this recipe was creamy but a tad on the bland side.  I used french onion chip dip and added a bit of Mrs Dash also.  My husband said he really couldn't detect much taste other than potatoe and butter.  I will maybe double the amount of chip dip next time.

I dislike potato flakes but had a leftover box that I wanted to useup in a new way.  I'm saying this because maybe this recipe just isn't good for those how don't like instant potatoes.  I found this recipe to be really gross.  I had 1 serving and the rest will be thrown out - and I HATE to waste anything but this just should not be eaten. Obviously a lot of people have enjoyed this recipe, and perhaps I'm a potato snob, but I would say if you just generally dislike potato flakes, this isn't for you.  If you do, well eat your heart out!

This is a Great Recipe!  The only change that I made was decreasing the Salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  I love being able to mix it ahead of time and bake it when needed!  Regular mashed potatoes cool down so fast once on the table....this one stays good and hot in the casserole!  We place it on a trivet in the middle of the table!  Thanks for sharing this Great Recipe!

Thanks Mary for the note about the refrigerated onion dip in the tub - I was thinking as I read the recipe that it was the package of dry mix as well!

My hubby loves mashed potatoes and I decided to try this to put a new spin on things.  The recipe was quick and easy and the potatoes were delicious.  Thanks again Mary!

I love this recipe.  Made with no changes on several occasions.  I have made this a couple hours ahead when entertaining, popped it in the oven with the rest of the meal so I could enjoy the company, and it comes out perfect every time.

This casserole was delicious!  I used sour cream and a tsp. of onion powder in place of the onion dip and beat it all up in my mixer and it turned out fluffy and creamy!

I used a McCormick Toasted Garlic and Herb seasoning pack instead of onion dip and it was a big hit. I saw someone dragging a roll through the leftovers on the bottom of the casserole dish.

This was very tasty! I didn't have onion dip so I used fat free sour cream and an envelope of onion soup mix. I also added chopped bacon pieces to the mixture. Yummy!

NOTE: make the instant potatoes according to package directions!  I needed twice the water that was called for in this recipe.  I brought this to a potluck and everyone enjoyed it.  I also added some shredded parmesan and cheddar, and some chopped green onions.  I cooked this in the slow cooker on low for a few hours and then kept it on warm for the party; that worked out well.  Nice easy recipe.

This was great. So easy to make and didn't need any adjustments. I did add french fried onions to the top but the casserole was excellent by itself!

This is the only potato recipe that I use now!! It is great, EVERYONE that tries it wants the recipe!! The only difference that I do is I will use Lipton dry onion soup mix mixed with sour cream, or for people that dont like onion flaver try with ranch! just get the dry packet and make the dip with sour cream...that is the way my 2,5, and 7 year olds like it!!

This was a huge hit! I didn't want the onion flavor so I used sour cream instead of dip. Also, I ended up using 2 cups of milk instead of 1. Otherwise it would have been too dry!

I really liked this recipe.  The flavor was really good.  Only one complaint; it was a little dry.  Next time (& there WILL be a next time!) I will add more liquid.  Probably milk.  My guests all raved about the flavor.  I think it was the creamy onion dip!

Pretty good but tasted surprsingly like basic mashed potatos even with everything added!  It tasted almost better the next day microwaved for some reason.  Somewhat boring but I will make again when I want a mashed potato casserole.

Kids loved it, adults were non-committal.  I would make it for the kids again (maybe as a thing to keep in the fridge for my eldest who is NEVER EVER full and always looking for something to eat) but not necessarily for a meal - we had a birthday party today, I made it as a test run (I always have a 'new' dish - it's become a tradition) and while the kids inhaled it (including the visiting kids)) the adults weren't impressed.  Neither hated it nor loved it.  I might try making it adapted w/ real potatoes and cutting back on the onion dip.

Made this for a pot luck today and it was fabulous!  A major hit with all the cooks in our group. Missed the posting regarding the pre-made dip, so used French Onion Soup Mix - didn't notice anything missing.  Added some shredded cheese and bacon crumbles to the top for additional taste and presentation. Will definately be making this again.

We really liked these. Next time I may use half of the onion dip and replace it with sour cream to tone it down a little for the kids but other than that they are good.

This had a good taste, but the consistency was like eating wallpaper paste!!!! I tried to add more milk but just didn't work for me.  Might be better with real mashed potatoes, but will not use again.

I didn't care for this at all - although many of my guests seemed to like it.  The consistancy was strange and it looked more like a quiche than mashed potatoes.  I was looking for a Thanksgiving shortcut, but next year I think I'll be back to the old fashioned mashed potatoes.

I really didn't like these for some reason. I used a packet of onion soup mix w/ sour cream. These were way too dry. I also thought the onion flavor was too strong. I may try these again w/ ranch instead and more liquid.

I just was searching for a way to use up my onion dip... this turned into a wonderful surprise!  The flavors are nicely blended.  My husband said he liked it better than regular mashed potatoes.  I actually followed the recipe as given, and didn't make any changes like I usually do.  This one's a keeper... thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this to go with our Easter Ham.  We really enoyed it.  I used 8 oz Sour Cream in place of the onion dip, just because I don't like onions in my potatoes.  It turned out very moist. I will make it again.

This dish was good, but very rich.  I recomend serving this with something not so rich in flavor, because my husband and Mother in Law couldn't move after dinner.  I personally thought the dish was a bit on the salty side, probably because of the onion soup mixture.

Okay 5 Stars include the changes from several Cooks. The way I made it; substituting butter for margarine, 8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream along with about a cup of grated cheddar cheese to the egg mixture along with about a teaspoon loaded potato soup spice by McCormic and quarter cup of real bacon bits. I also added about a teaspoon of Hidden Valley Ranch dry seasoning mix and I took someone else's tip and topped it with about a two cups of french fried onions, which I made from scratch (not hard to do- look it up on All recipes).

Very good and easy to make, easier than peeling, boiling and mashing.  This won't be my go-to mashed potatoes as I still prefer real potatoes but this is definitely great as a fancier side dish!

The only change I made was to top with cheddar cheese and sprinkle with paprika. These potatoes were delicious and much easier than my other potato casserole recipe.

My family loves this! Thanks for clarifying  the "onion dip". I have substituted sour cream and any dry soup I have on hand. ( missed the dip on my shopping trip ). If I have any casserole left I turn it into soup. Just add milk, shredded cheese and any ham or bacon that I might have on hand. Super Yummy!

Ok, I could tell these were made with boxed potatoes (probably because I knew they were in there), however, everyone else loved them (including my mother who hates boxed potatoes and says she's tried putting onion dip in things, and it always ends up with a wierd flavor)! I made the recipe to the 'T', and doubled it. It filled a 9x13 pan to the top, and I sprinkled it with smoked paprika. They were creamy and delicious. I got tons of recipe requests and people even we're bringing home leftovers by the plateful. Awesomely easy recipe, will be using it again.

I use sour cream instead of onion dip, and add sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture before baking.   It taste very close to real twice baked potatoes!  I get asked to bring this dish to every gathering.

Loved it!  I used sour cream and a small amount of bottled ranch dressing.  Topped with Kielbasa turkey sausage and pepper jack cheese for the topping.  Yum!

The first time I made this exactly as written, the next time I used a packet of ranch dressing and tonight I made it using bacon bits and subbed the cream cheese for shredded cheddar to make 'loaded baked potato'. They are ALL really good. This recipe is very versatile and super easy to make. It doesn't taste like boxed potatoes.

This was good but I guess I'm not an instant potato person.  I would use real potatoes if I made this again.  I did use the hint and topped with fried onion rings and it was a great idea.

I made these as the recipe stated and they were very good but I think they could be a little better.  The next time I will use ranch dip instead of french onion. I felt that the french onion flavor was a little strong.  I will also add some Parmesean cheese or something like that the next time.  Overall a good and easy recipe.  I actually made this a head of time and then just put it in the oven before guests arrived and it made for a quick and easy meal.

This is a very tasty version of mashed potatoes and it doesn't require as much work as traditional mashed potatoes.  I accidentally left mine lumpy but the time in the oven softened it all up.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I made it just like the recipe, except I forgot to top it with butter.  I did however, sprinkle the top with paprika and dry parsley flakes.  It made it much more appealing.  I served it to a group of about 10 (doubled the recipe) and there was not a lick left.  I will be making this over and over again.

This recipe was delicious!  I'm making it to bring to Thanksgiving but I wanted to try it ahead of time to see how it was.  It has a lot of fat in it, but you could try substituting lower fat ingredients or just make it only for special occasions.  For my husband and I, I served it with ham steaks and sweet corn.  I think it'll go really well with the cornish hens my family makes for Thanksgiving.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and not only did I dislike the dish ,so did everyone else. I used onion dip mix... after reading other reviews I think I probably should have used an onion dip, but I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the potatos ended up a little too dry.  However the flavor was wonderful.  I was a little confused as to if the onion dip was a dry package or pre-made so I used pre-made which gave it an excellent flavor.  Even my son, a very picky eater, loved the taste.  I would add more water next time, and there will be a next time!

I did not care for this recipe. The potatoes were overcooked on the outside and too mushy on the inside. I think I'll just stick to regular mashed potatoes...they are a lot less work.

This tasted really good, but it seemed a bit much for mashed potatoes.  I think I'll stick to plain ol' butter, milk, and salt mixed with some mashed up potatoes.

Great Recipe! Everybody loved the dish and nobody could tell that there were no "real" potatoes in the recipe. Very easy and quick to make - I would highly recommend! :o)

This is a great recipe for those of us who dread peeling potatoes. I used sour cream instead of the dip to make it less savory to go with roast beef and gravy. This worked out very well. I might try a little more liquid next time. Very good.

Delicious! The cream cheese and onion dip made these potatoes very creamy and added just a little "zing". Great with hamburgers!
