This was quite tasty; something I'll be making again, no doubt. It could probably use a bit of salt, especially since I noticed it, but didn't really mind because I don't use a lot of salt anyway. Other than being a little time-intensive to cook the spaghetti squash ahead of time (I actually did that the day before), it came together pretty fast.

Loved the idea of using spaghetti squash in a quiche. The texture was just right. I used a variety of vegetables. I used a red pepper, broccoli, and mushrooms. The beauty of this is you can use any veggies. After sauteeing the veggies inn a cast iron pan, I followed the rest of the recipe as is, except I just mixed everything together in the cast iron pan, then topped with the bread crumbs, and topped with four slices of swiss cheese. Absolutely delicious!!

This was SOOO yummy! My family loved it. I actually added steamed asparagus in to the spinach. It didn't last long that's for sure. :)

A good base recipe, (although it would need salt for sure.)  I changed it up quite a bit, and it was fantastic.  I will definitely make it again this way:  I sautéed fresh chopped kale, onion, garlic, and 3 chopped mushrooms, and added that plus 1 chopped tomato into the squash mixture.  I used 6 eggs and half a cup of cashew milk for the egg mixture.  Also, I used gluten free breadcrumbs.  For spices, I added a tsp salt, and pinches of onion powder (a must with egg dishes!), garlic powder, basil, parsley, and sage.  Baked it in a 9"x11" glass dish lined with parchment paper.  Delicious!!!

I added cremini mushrooms, green pepper and 1  cup of feta cheese.  Also added sumac to season.  We loved it.  The feta added the needed salt

The first time I made spaghetti squash made spaghetti w/italian chicken sausage & it was okay but nothing to rave about.  So I was anxiously looking for another recipe to try & found this one.  I tweaked the recipe a little.  I cut up cherry tomatoes and put them in the mixture along with shredded mozzarella cheese.  My husband & I liked it but next time I will slice large tomatoes & add a lot more mozzarella cheese - these 2 items really added a lot of flavor.

Didn’t care for the bread crumb bottom, it was soggy, but tasted fine. I’ll use a gluten free crust next time or nothing at all. I will fix this again. Great for left over lunch next day!

I agree. A little bland, and I added diced turkey bacon. Will make again. I will just add cheese and a little more pepper.

This is a great recipe that is easy to modify and use up what you have on hand. I called it “cleaned out the crisper casserole” because I just started pulling out the stuff that had reached the end of freshness. It was very well received. No one left hungry.

Made this per the recipe except added some additional seasoning. Served with a salad.  My daughter and I both loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

I agree with the other reviews stating the recipe is a bit bland as-is.  I would add some chopped sun-dried tomatoes & some feta or parmesan cheese if I were to make this again.

Very fun and tasty dish.  I doubled up on the spinach and added a can of diced, drained tomato for more veggies. I used egg whites and 3 T cream instead of the milk. Will definitely make it again and share the recipe with friends and family!

This was actually better than I thought it would be. I did cut down on the onion a bit and added  a cup of fresh mushroom. Also, agree with others that it needs salt. I added a teaspoon.

The pepper was a overwhelming, and the lack of salt, or cheese to replace salt, left the dish tasting bland and lifeless.

I screwed up and forgot to buy bread crumbs.  It turned out (obviously) too moist.  I should have followed the recipe.  I'll try again soon.

Great recipe ! I added things that I had in the fridge that I had to use up - green onions, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and a little Parmesan cheese. Turned out great and will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe!
