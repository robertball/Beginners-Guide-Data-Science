I made this recipe for a potluck with a UK theme. Some people really enjoyed it
and others didn't liek it at ALL. I used a raspberry syrup and was pleased
 with how it came out.

Perfect recipe. Truly wonderful and well worth all the effort for special occasions. Tastes exactly like my British husband's mom makes it in England. We make it in a turkey roasting oven. $20 special around Thanksgiving. The roaster allows us to get the desired temperature without heating up the entire house with the oven. Be aware it generates a LOT of steam in the house. The interior of the windows in the kitchen gets wet when cooking this. Kind of alarming. The only changes I ever make are to add another tablespoon of syrup. In regards to the syrup, any "golden syrup" will do.  You can substitute Karo, maple syrup or a jam but it's not as good. The golden syrup is a must for this recipe.

I wanted this as my Birthday Cake this past week.  We added a few more tablespoons of syrup.  If you don't eat it hot out of the oven - you miss out.  This was delicious!!!  A real Treat!
