If you want something really rich and complex, try this! But do not use that much chocolate; you don't want to put half your calorie allowance for the day in a cup. I made it with a bit under 1 cup of chocolate chips, and it was excellent.

Not bad for a simple Hot Chocolate recipe. Might need to try this again with fresh whipped cream.

You don't have to put in all the spices but I still used the cinnamon.
