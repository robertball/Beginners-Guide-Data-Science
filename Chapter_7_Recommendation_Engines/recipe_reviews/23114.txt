When I tasted this jam, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven - it's THAT good!  I gave a jar to my brother, and he said it was the best jam he'd ever tasted!  Really easy to make, too.  (But let it start to set before you put into jars, or the banana floats to the top!)

This is the yummiest jam I've ever tasted! This was my first attempt at canning anything and it was so easy. I used a waterbath canner and processed the jars for 10 minutes in it. The amazing thing about this jam is that it really, really, really does taste like strawberry! This is perfect for my stepdaughter who is allergic to strawberry but loves the taste of strawberries! I would let it set for about 3 minutes before pouring into jars just because my first poured jar had the banana and jelly part seperate a bit, but all the rest were perfect, so I'm thinking the pectin just needs a moment to set before you begin pouring. If you mash your bananas up well, it mixes just fine, and comes out a lovely rosy red color perfect for the holidays! This is a great first recipe for someone who has never attempted a jam before.

If you've never made jam before, start with this recipe.  The ingredients do the work themselves.  The result is beautiful, delicious and unique.  I have made bunches of this for Christmas gifts!  To can: wait for jam to gel a bit (this took mine about 45 minutes,) put jam in your canning jars, place in large pot, fill with water to one inch above lids, and boil 15 minutes.  Remove and place on towel to dry.  The lids will suction down while cooling.

I make lots of different fruit jams,  this is a nice addition as it uses different fruit.   We like the fruit taste without the pectin.   Skip the water.  General rule is one cup sugar to one cup fruit, adjust based on if fruit is sweat or tart.  Chop up the cranberries before you measure them, this gives a better measurement and you don't have whole cerrberryy skins..   I had  3 cups of berries so used 4 cups of sugar, figured the bananas did not need much sugar.   Cook the cranberries  with just the sugar ( it will liook dry but as soon it starts heating there will be plenty of juice).  Add a pat of butter and turn the heat down to prevent foam.  Cook until translucent an thichened them add the bananas for the last minute.  No pectin required.   If you boil your jars and lid, you can put in the hot jam, add the lid and it will seal.   Being doing that for 50 years and the jam wiil keep for over a year.... If you don't eat it first.

Great taste and easy recipe.  I found it to be a bit too sweet so I may cut the sugar next time.  Also, I didn't taste banana at all.  I thought this jam tasted more like strawberry than cranberry - maybe because it's so sweet?  Also, after the initial 10 simmer of the cranberries, they were still mostly whole so I mashed them up with a spoon.  Maybe that's the difference?  Possibly, if I had left them whole, I would have gotten a more tart taste and would have been able to distinguish between the banana and the cranberry.  But, since I mashed the cranberries, they just blended with the bananas and created a strawberry taste.  Overall a good, quick and easy recipe.

This is such a beautiful jam that if it didn't taste so well, I would never open it!  But the taste is so good I can't resist!  I am wrapping these up for Christmas gifts ... makes 5 half pint jars.  I was not sure if I would like this recipe because I am not crazy about cranberries but I am sure glad I tried this recipe out!

I've made this jam for several years to give as holiday gifts.  My friends eagerly look forward to it--and some even place "orders" long before cranberry season arrives!!

Good starter recipe. As is, way too sweet but it's easily bendable to cut the sugar back, if you so choose. Which I did. That's really the only issue I had was just too much sugar. Very simple, so simple that I was able to make this with my youngest son and really have no issues at all.

I came across this recipe after my daughter started bringing home over ripe fruit that would otherwise be trashed, and buy cranberries when in season for another fantastic recipe on here.  The first batch I cooked as directed but was not so keen on using the pectin and it was a bit on the sweet side but still delicous, the second batch I made today I doubled the recipe and didnt use pectin and halfed the sugar and its still delicous... have had rave reviews from neighbors.  I use pint jars since my opnion is that half pints can be used in one setting.. Thanks Barbara for this wonderful recipe

I absolutely ADORE this recipe! I had never tried making my own jam before, so chose this one because it sounded easy -- I never expected it to be so delicious! When cranberries are out of season, they can easily be substituted with raspberries (fresh or frozen), which also taste amazing with the banans.

I made this as Christmas gifts and it was wonderful! The cranberries calmed the banana flavor.. it was sooo good! It reminds me of eating banana bread. The recipe was easy to make and I loved eating it on toasted english muffins with a little cream cheese.  The picture showed doesn't do it justice!

Well, I thought this was not very good at all. The texture was ultimately weird and inconsistent, sometimes grainy like cranberry sauce and sometimes jammy. I also thought the cranberry/banana flavors clashed instead of mixing well.

I was so happy to find this recipe my mom used to make forever ago! This jam is terrific. I used wild cranberries which tend to be more tart  and it turned out perfect!!

Great flavor!! I modified the cooking times buy following another jam recipe I use quite often...boil the cranberries as directed on this recipe then add the other ingredients aside from the pectin and lemon juice and bring to a full boil for 3 minutes. remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes. add pectin and lemon juice and stir until well mixed. Let cool for another 2 minutes then stir for 1. process as usual.

Quick and easy, best of all super tasty! I cut the sugar to 3 cups per other reviewers "too sweet" comments, and used a box of pectin instead of liquid. Loved the recipe, and I'm stocking up on cranberries so I can have this stocked until next cranberry season.

Neat recipe, but I personally thought it turned out too sweet.  I guess I was thinking that because it was cranberries it would have there great tart flavor - but it didn't.  Maybe my bananas were too ripe - I took some overripe ones out of the freezer to use.  I'll probably make this recipe again, only with less black bananas!

Tasted really good, I tasted alot of banana which mine were pretty ripe which made them easier to mash, but next time if they are super ripe I may just use a little less then called for... One thing I will say use ALOT bigger pot then you think you'll need because when it starts to boil it goes to town and you don't want to boil over... oh my what a mess that could be.. lol..

Just a note about a recipe similar or the same as this one:  The University of Alaska Extension Recipe Booklet for Wild Berries Recipes had this recipe, which was called Cranberry Banana Jam, and it was made with the local lingonberries (low-bush cranberries) that grow native to parts of Alaska.  I think some of the problems noted in the review with big cranberries would be eliminated using the smaller berries, so it makes sense that at least a similar recipe came from Alaska.  The first time I saw this recipe was when I moved there in 1970, and it was still in the last booklet I had when I left in 1998.  I agree, it is a great recipe.  btw, my signature gift was wild rose petal jelly, also made from the same booklet.

I made this yesterday to have for holiday baskets, saving some in a bowl for husband to try. He Loved this jam!!  Now I have to make more for him or hide what I have if I want to keep it for gifts!
Like some suggested I only used 5 cups of sugar, but for me it was still a little too sweet, so I may tweek it a liitle more next time.  It set up perfectly with no problem at all

I prefer jam with less sugar, so i cut back a bit. Otherwise perfect, the flavor is wonderful. would never have thought of combining banana and cranberries! Make sure you don't boil it for longer than 1 minute after adding the bananas.

My first jam! Success! Per other reviews, I decreased the sugar to 5 cups and it was plenty sweet. I might even try 4 cups next time. Not quite as red as the photo but next time I'll try skimming more of the bubbles off the top. Still a pretty deep pink and delicious! Made 8 6oz. jars.

If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would.  I tried this recipe thinking it would be perfect for gifts at Thanksgiving dinner.  Unfortunately, the dominate taste is that of bananas!?  After reading other people's  reviews  I decided to cut back on the sugar, and used 3 1/2 cups sugar and 1 cup Splenda....and also cut down on the bananas, which I mashed with a fork the first time and found them a bit too big, so I mashed them well for the second batch and they looked much better when jarred!...I used 1 1/2 cups of bananas instead of the recommended 2 cups.  This helped the flavor of the cranberries shine through a little but still was not anything to write home about.  The first batch made 8- 8oz jelly jars and the second (filled a smidgen fuller) made 7- 8 oz jelly jars.  I did find that following some other cooks suggestions I let the second batch set up for approx 5 minutes and this did help in the even distribution of the jam.  While I was waiting I did skim the frothy bubbles off the top which made a big difference in the appearance of the second batch!!!  It was much brighter and more like the photo.  I also flipped the jars about every 15 minutes after the 10 hot water bath and they all set up and the chunks were evenly distributed.  I do not think I will make this recipe again but it was fun to try it a couple times.  I intend to use it as a topping for whole grain pancakes and on oatmeal.

I tried this recipe as I had left over cranberries and ripe bananas in the fridge.
I agree with the other reviewers--this is and easy and fast, interesting use of these ingredients.  Next time I make it I will add less sugar, as it is overly sweet for my taste and I will add
more lemon and maybe some lemon peel/slices, ala marmalade, if the jam is still too sweet with reduced sugar.

This jam is delicious. I made it for christmas gifts, and I received rave reviews.  I had my Mom sample it prior to giving it out and she liked it so much she did the same thing.  This jam makes EXCELLENT PB&J sandwiches!!

Really very good!  I added 1 cup chopped pecans and the recipe yielded me 10 half-pints.  I thought the color of the end product was a little off so I also added 2 drops of red food coloring.  Great gift idea for Christmas!!!

We have enjoyed this recipe since 2002.
It is excellant and beautiful to give with its sparkling red color. My family asks each Thanksgiving if I will make 2 batches of this to have for the holidays and give as gifts.

This simple recipe seemed perfect for a first time jam maker; but, just to be sure, I only made half of a batch. Big mistake, it was all gone within a couple of days. I was surprised how many people really liked this jam. Thank you for the recipe.

This was yummy.  I would suggest straining the cranberries out because they're a little tart when you leave them in, and they also all float to the top of the jar and make for a strange presentation.  Really yummy though!

I had bought a lot of cranberries when they were on sale and didn't know what to do with them. I love bananas so I tried this recipe. Unbelievable!! So very, very good! The only thing different I did was use my immersion blender on it to make it smoother rather than chunky! Will so make this again!

This jam is amazing. I tried it out because of all the great reviews and I'm so glad I did. I made a bunch of this and gave it away as gifts. Everyone raved about it! Next time I will make more for myself.

After reading the reviews, most said not a lot of banana flavor-tasted more like strawberry, I decided to make it.  Mine has an extreme banana flavor, but unless you bite into a cranberry that is still "whole" you do taste strawberry.  I love the strawberry taste, but not the banana.  Mine also had a lot of bubbles in my jar once I poured it in, so mine is not as pretty but I do like it.  Just not crazy about the banana.

Very easy to make- set up beautifully.  I mostly tasted banana, and I didn't use really ripe ones, but maybe with time the flavors will meld more.  Most of the cranberries stayed whole, so I gave them a quick mash.  It yielded six 12oz jelly jars.

I like the concept, but it was way too sweet (I'm used to making low sugar jam) and the tartness of the cranberries didn't come through like I'd hoped.  All I tasted was banana.  I might try again with low sugar pectin and less banana.  We'll see.

This is the perfect recipe for a first time canner like myself. Easy, not too complicated, or too many ingredients. And the taste is great!! Appreciated the tip about letting it set before putting in jars or bananas float to the top, I had that problem the first time and thought I'd ruined it. But a quick stir and it is just fine. Today was second stab at it, and had better luck with it. This is good stuff!!

Loved this jam...  I actually made this last winter and forgot to rate it.  I gave it for gifts along with a spiced apple jelly and this was the favorite by far.  It has a strawberry-ish flavor, and sets up wonderfully...  firm, but easy to spread at the same time.  I can't wait for it to get cold again cause this one is a definite repeat in my house.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This jam is great! My first attempt at making jam or canning anything, so simple and tasty. I wanted a more consistant color and texture so i wisked it smooth, rather than just stirring it together. Lovely color and flavor. Great gifts.

I love this jam. It made enough to give small jars as teacher's gifts and for family. It is very sweet and my sister didn't like the banana but it's not a fruit she's partial to anyways. I will definitely make this again but probably only half a batch.

This was an amazing match of fruits I thought, so I just had to try making it.  FUN, and a good winter jam to make!  I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water.  Used about 5 cups of sugar, not 7, and the dry powdered low sugar/no sugar pectin.  I also added a touch of bourbon vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Everyone went crazy over it! Was well worth "gifting" to those who love these flavors.  And pretty indeed.

Flavor is good. Never used pectin before this and it wasn't thick enough. I suggest using corn starch instead.

Good recipe - first cranberry jam recipe I've found. Very different, and it tastes great. I made it as written, though I might not put quite as much sugar in next time so you could taste some of the bite of the cranberry. Very sweet, not tart at all. I could definitely taste the banana more than anything else, so I would also recommend using overly ripe bananas to add a sweeter, less banana-y taste.

I cut the sugar in half per some of the comments above and this was just fantastic. It didn't set as firm as a result, but this will just take pancakes and waffles to the next level! Next time I am going to also try and cut the banana back a bit and add more cranberries... just curious what that will do for the flavor.

I just got done making the jam, very unique, and interesting flavor. I used powderd pectin and boiled it with water to use.it was very easy to make, and the jam set up very nicely. I made some in jelly jar containers, and some  in pint containers for us. Giving away some in xmas baskets filled with homemade gifts in jars. Thanks for posting, can hardly wait to try on some toast in the morning.

The only thing I will change for the next batch is to decrease the bananas and sugar and increase the cranberries. Good stuff!
