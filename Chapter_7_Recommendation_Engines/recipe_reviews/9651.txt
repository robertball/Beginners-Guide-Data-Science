I used butter instead of shortning, and I increased the cream cheese to 1 cup. I also added a crumb toping of:
1/2 cup sliced almonds
1 cup flour
3/4 cup oats
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 cup marg
2 tblsp whipping cream
and just used my fingers to mix it till crumbly and sprinkled it over the top. Really good!

I tweaked this recipe a bit...I used 8oz of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, a pint of blueberries and vanilla instead of almond.  More cheesecake like on top, cake-like on the bottom, like a pastry.

Excellent! I altered the recipe by using 3 eggs in the crust (instead of one) and using vanilla.  For the topping, I only used 1 egg and 8 oz. of cream cheese.  when I placed the blueberries, I sprinkled with cinammon and a little fresh grated nutmeg.  This turned out beautifully and was so yummy.

These blueberry bars are great!  I added a little bit more cream cheese (1/2 cup) as someone suggested and more blueberries.  I highly recommend this recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add a little sugar and cinnamon on top of the blueberries.  There are not like bars, more of a coffee cake, but a great taste!  YUM!

Very tasty!  I used less sugar, butter instead of shortening, vanilla instead of almond, half wheat flour, 2 cups blueberries, and cooked for 5 minutes longer.  They are more like cake or pastry than actual bars.

I really like the dense cake-like bottom layer. These are good as made with 8 oz cream cheese, but next time I'll double the "cheesecake topping", as it's just not enough. " I used all vanilla extract, butter instead of shortening,  and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. I'll make these again!!

Not impressed with recipe.  Too many other recipes out there that are great.  Certainly did not taste like cheesecake.  Edges crusty and rest cakelike...even used an airbake pan.  Would not make again.

This is delicious!  With my changes...which is why I only gave 4 stars.  I used a whole block of cream cheese, butter rather than shortening,  more blueberries than called for, and vanilla extract rather than almond.
The cheesecake topping is delicious!

OMG - just made these for my family.  I needed a new blueberry recipe and this certainly did fit the bill.  My husband helps me rate new recipes as keepers or nevers and this was definitely a keeper.  I did not use the almond flavoring but used vanilla instead and it came out awesome.  thank you for a new favorite in my house.

My family liked this.  I think I will try lemon extract next time instead of the almond (it is very strong) and/or a little lemon zest in the cream cheese mixture.  I will make it again.  It's a nice use of blueberries.

We didn't think this tasted anything like cheesecake.  I usd the amount of almond extract called for and felt it was too much almond flavor, it seemed more almond than blueberry flavor.  It was better the first couple of days and got soggy when covered.  Instead of a 9 x 9" pan I used a 28 x 18 cm pan and it wasn't too thin.

This is definitely a winner with my daughter and I.   My husband thought it was a little tart.  I took some of the suggestions and increased the cream cheese, decreased the eggs and added a dash of cinnamon over the blueberries.  Hard to mess thi one up.

My family loved these! Do to previous comments, I put the bottom layer in a 9x13 pan, doubled the blueberries and doubled the top layer recipe. This evened out the layers for us.

This recipe was great, it was easy to make and everyone loved it, they all went back for seconds. One thing however, it did take a little longer to cook then mentioned in the recipe. Also when making this recipe consider how much you like the taste of almond, or almond extract because it calls for quite a bit and you can definitely taste it in the bars.

Despite carefully following  the recipe and making sure not to overmix or overbake, these did not turn out as I expected at all. First of all, they did not taste like cheesecake (much to my dismay). Secondly, they're not really what you would expect of a traditional bar cookie...the crust turned out to be very cakey, and the fact that the topping kept slipping off didn't help much either. I would not make this again, nor would I recommend that you wait an hour hoping for something good out of this.

We think this cake is delicious, however, a cheesecake it ain't. Nor does it taste like a cheesecake. It is a wet-bottomed cake, (in a good way) which keeps it moist.  The almond extract gives the cake an exquisite taste along with the blueberries. I think vanilla may be substituted as some reviewers suggest but you'd be missing out; trust me!

I used a sugar substitute (Equal Plus) that's have real sugar and half Equal, because we are diabetics. I added extra blueberries to  it. The bottom of the bars came out too soft, making for mushy bars. The top and blueberries were very tasty. I guess if I decide to make this again I will have to use pure sugar, but, I still don't know how the bottom of the bar would come out.

Waste of blueberries and cream cheese.  The bottom layer was fine, as was the blueberries, the topping however  Tasted like scrambled eggs with sugar mixed in.  Won't be making again.

Ok...but not great. I have made way better blueberry deserts. Next time I will make my normal blueberry cake instead.

These came out great! However, I made a few changes. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. salt to the crust. I removed the almond extract from the topping and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. lemon zest. I will definitely be making these again.

These were excellent.  Easy and came out perfectly.  I followed the recipe and added the crumb topping as suggested .  I served it warm with ice cream at a dinner party.

I decreased the sugar in the crust to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 tsp. salt. I put the full amount of almond extract the recipe called for, and it wasn't overpowering at all. They could have used at least another 1/2 cup of blueberries, but other than that, these came out great. To me, they tasted like super moist blueberry muffins.

UPDATED REVIEW:  Made these again, with 2 cups of frozen (freshly picked) blueberries and one bar of 1/3 less fat cream cheese with 2 eggs.  Fantastic.  I brought them to a girls beach weekend for breakfast and my friends raved over them!  A keeper! **************************************** These were OK.  I messed up the recipe because I didn't have enough cream cheese.  4 ounces with two eggs was very liquidy and I was worried that it would taste eggy.  I went ahead with the recipe anyway, and although it didn't come out the way it was supposed to, it wasn't bad.  I'll give it another try, and use a full bar of cream cheese next time, and maybe just one egg.  This is one of those recipes that needs to be tweaked a bit!

These were cakey and not cheescake-like at all, IMO.  They were good, but not great, and I likely won't make them again.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good!  I increased the amount of blueberries to 2 cups and also increased the cream cheese to 8 oz., using 1/3 less fat version.  It turned out tasty without being too sweet; a nice change from cheesecake topped with cherry pie filling.  It's a keeper.

This was actually very good. I made this because I had blueberries in the fridge..fresh ones that I knew were going to go bad if I didn't do something! I also needed to take a dish to a party. So, I made these. I have yet to go to the party, it's tomorrow and I made these tonight. I mixed mine up too, with the topping, with oats, cinnomin, pecan halves, brown sugar and a little flour just put this on top of the cream cheese topping and viloa! It baked a while, but I had my husband try it and he liked it. I made sure he wasn't just "lying" ..lol. I would make this again, although a little on the fatening side, but my family owns a resturaunt and most are over weight anyways, including me just a bit, so I am sure they will love these tomorrow. Thanks!

I had to add extra cream cheese, because it came out too liquid. It wasn't overly sweat. The cake part was a little dense. With a little more tweaking I think this recipe could be pretty good.

I am 14 and I love cooking. This is an amazing recipe it is so good. My Dad loves blueberry cheesecake and he loves this. I doubled this and put it in a 9x13 pan and it worked well. I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the crust and it was good. I would recommend this to anyone

It is delicious and tastes like a baked cheesecake, not too sweet. I used 2 cups blueberries and a full (UK ) pack of cream cheese 280g. Next time I would dip the berries in flour so they don't sink. I used an 8"x10" pan

I made this recipe using Junberries (serviceberries) since I pick them every year. I also used butter instead of shortening. It was delicious. As it states, best the next day after refrigeration.

I doubled the ingredients through All Recipes, however, I wasn't paying attention to the directions (those were doubled) and forgot one in for the crust. However, they turned out fine. 

Also the direction state in the crust to add  almond flavoring, but not the amount and then again states to add almond flavoring to the topping without an amount.

6.3.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9651/blueberry-bars/ ... Pretty, but bland. True, I forgot the almond extract in the base; but not the cream cheese part.  'Think it needs that - the almond - & maybe some vanilla, too.  I used butterflavor shortening.  'Sure that helped; but, if you try, go for real butter - & more sugar - in the base & cream cheese part.  The cream cheese part didn't stand out tastewise.  It somehow blended in with the base while baking.

This recipe is just ok. I have made it twice and won't bother again. It's alright,more of a blueberry coffee cake than anything. Not worth the cost of the berries. But if you have a bunch of berries to use up....

My family cannot get enough of this.  I make it about once a week and they even eat it for breakfast.  I made some changes - I use plain vanilla extract because my husband is not fond of almonds and I use the entire block of cream cheese and butter for the shortening.  Make sure you cook it for at least 60 minutes otherwise it is mushy.    When I make this for company it's gone in a flash.  Not too sweet and loaded with fresh (or frozen/thawed) blueberries.  Yummy.

These weren't bad.  My blueberries sank to the bottom, but it didn't alter the taste at all.  It was a nice experiment though.

We made these with lemon extract instead of almond extract (nice touch), and used 8oz. of cream cheese.  The thick "base" was very much like my grandma's cake-like fruit cobbler.  The "topping" was not nearly as cheesecake-y as I would have liked, and wasn't as thick of a layer as I think it should have been to warrant the term "cheesecake".  The family enjoyed it as a breakfast dish, but it was not at all what I expected.  After re-reading the recipe, I should have recognized it as a cobbler-y base.  I probably won't be making it very often.

Hmm.  I'd agree with the statement of them tasting like blueberry cheesecake if the layer of cake on the bottom wasn't so thick, and the layer of cream cheese on the top wasn't so thin.  They're ok, just not really what I was looking for.

This recipe has some issues.  I ended up using 2 eggs for the crust, and 2 eggs for the topping, as well as a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese.  I had my wife take them to work, and everyone seemed to love them.  Highly doubt I will make again.  The dought was serverly dry.

Nice! I also increased the blueberries. I didn't have almond extract so I used lemon, a little less in quantity because didn't know how strong it would be. That added a very lovely flavor. They are not too sweet, just right. Next time I think I'll cut down on the amount of crust to let the berries shine through more. And cinnamon? That would be a great touch too.

Very good! I used 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening, 2 cups of berries and 8 oz of cream cheese.  First I tasted it after 30 minutes from oven and didn't like it !!!! But as all cheese cakes, it should stand for at least 1 hour before eating (my opinion). When my guests arrived it's been 3 hours since cooking and I reheated it. Tasted really good!!! Will do again. Thank  you for the recipe!

These bars are super yummy! I added 2 1/4 cups of blueberries and a bit more sugar into the crust batter. My family LOVED this recipe. I will certainly make these again for my next gathering or for a fun weekend project!

Excellent!Made no changes to this recipe. I read one of the reviews where they added a crumble. Fantastic! I tweecked the crumble to 1/2 cup flour, 3/4 cup oats,3/4 cup brown sugar,1 tsp nutmeg,1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup butter and 2 tbsp whipping cream. Also added lemon zest to chese mixture and a sprinkle of cinnamon over blueberries. Will make this again.  Thanks.

I made this recipe for a crowd of veterans as a breakfast treat. It was gone immediately.  Instead of blueberries, I used frozen (thawed) strawberries. VERY GOOD!

I tried this using vanilla instead of the almond extract which I didn't have on hand.  First oops.  I also tried the topping as one review stated.  Just not my favorite.  I might try again and follow the recipe as listed.

This recipe called for way more almond extract than was necessary.  The crust is more cake-like than crust-like.  I would have preferred a crustier crust.  The recipe also does not call for enough of the cream cheese topping.  I used the entire package, not just 6 oz. and it was barely enough.  The recipe is okay, but far from great.

I made this with canned blueberries. I thought it came out really good.  I also used low-fat cream cheese with only one egg.  Will definately make again, can't wait to try it when fresh blueberries are in season.

These "bars" turned out more along the lines of a tasty cobbler.  It is pleasing to the palate, and my family will eat it, but it is definitely not the cheesecake like pastry that I was expecting.  I will attempt to make again some time and see if I did something wrong this time.

I should've trusted my gut and listened to Robert, Rosaline and ATARAXICA.  But, I had 4 oz of cream cheese to use up and GOBS of blueberries.  I did heed the warning about "Almond'ness" - and did half & half Vanilla & Almond Extract, where called for.  Didn't help.  The topping didn't resemble cheesecake at all in any form. Had an "Eggy" taste that just overtook any other flavor.   Totally deceiving, as it smelled sooo good when baking.  Don't waste your time or ingredients.
