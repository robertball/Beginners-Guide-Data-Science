I've been aware of these easy biscuits for many, many years, but never bothered to try them until today, when I had an opened carton of heavy cream I wanted to put to good use.  I brushed them with melted butter before baking  them at a higher temperature than the recipe instructed, 425 degrees. When I pulled them from the oven I gave them  a sprinkle of California Garlic Salt.  I had low expectations, but I was more than surprised, in a positive way, with the outcome.  These were some of the softest, fluffiest, most tender  biscuits I've ever made.

With only two ingredients I was somewhat concerned about how these were going to taste. These were excellent. The dough was a stiff dough that I had to actually use my hands to mix, but most people use their hands to mix stiff doughs like breads and biscuits. Try these biscuits, you'll like them, and you can dress them up and make them sweet or savory.

These are delicious! I didn't expect so much from two ingredients (well. OK, 4.  I had to make my self rising flour with 2c flour, 1T baking powder and 1/2 t salt).  I had visited a farmer friend and gotten milk from his cows.  There was lots of cream on the milk which I skimmed off.  So I was looking for a recipe to use it up.  I made drop biscuits.  The batter is somewhat 'sticky'. The biscuits are very tender yet crispy outside.  I am planning to make more and freeze the batter in 'drops'.  YUM! (also made butter to put on them.  Heaven!)

I make homemade biscuits several times a month using self-rising flour. However, you need to add shorting or oil.  I put 2/3 cup canola oil or coconut oil along with 2 cups of SR flour.  You mix it with the flour until the mixture looks crumbly like corn meal.  Make a hole in the middle of the mixture and add the heavy cream all at once.  Stir until the dough is formed.  Procede as this recipe instructs.  I never buy can biscuits. If you don't have self rising flour you can add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of baking powder to all purpose flour and follow with the oil and other ingredients.  Additionally to make scones add 1/2 cup sugar and raisins.  I hope this is helpful to someone.

These were very moist and very rich biscuits. They needed a bit of salt though for flavor. They almost tasted buttery, I guess because of the cream. They didn't rise much though and were a bit flat, but they were good for just eating plain. They were very delicate and didn't hold up to splitting and would not be suitable for a biscuit sandwich. Easy recipe though and only 2 ingredients!

This is a great, easy to use recipe. I usually add a tablespoon or two of chopped fresh parsley or other fresh herbs to use with creamed chicken over biscuits. This is the best way to make biscuits!

These were so easy and yummy!  I used a scoop to make drop biscuits and they even split nicely.  Topped them with chocolate gravy for an over the top treat.  Would be great for strawberry shortcake with a little sugar and almond extract added.

My husband loved these and they were sooo quick to make!  I used light cream instead of heavy cream and I made my own self- rising flour using was half whole wheat.  Great little drop biscuits.  Thanks for posting.

I thought these turned out pretty good.  I was a little skeptical because there was only 2 ingredients.  I did have to add a little more cream than called for.  The dough was just too stiff to work with.  I just eye-balled it til I got the right consistency.  Very light and a touch of sweetness.

Crazy easy.  I vow to never buy canned biscuits again.  I had some whipping cream that needed to be used up, so I had nothing to lose giving this recipe a try. I made some butter from the rest of the leftover whipping cream; we had delicious fresh, hot biscuits with homemade butter and jam. What's not to love?  This recipe is fast and easy enough to make on a school morning, and will delight my kids to wake up to.  One reviewer suggested adding fresh herbs, whch I will try, and maybe even try adding a little sugar and dried fruit to make scones.  Thanks for sharing, Monique, it will be a staple in my recipe box.

So EASY! Absolutely delicious. I made mine as drop biscuits to get them on the table quicker. Recipe does not need to be changed in any way. Wonderful with butter & honey or jam. Also great sprinkled with garlic salt instead to make a quickie version of Cheddar Bay Biscuits from Olive Garden.

These are great and so easy!  Be sure to not make the dough to thin or the biscuits will be too thin.  Next time I'll keep the dough thicker.  Because of the flour on the outside they didn't stick to the pan at all.

Super easy.  I had some SR flour to use up.  I made a half recipe and used LF milk.  Got 6 drop biscuits (heaping TBSP size).  I'm sure the cream would add even more.

Delicious and so easy!  Froze some as suggested in the recipe.  The frozen dough still tasted great but this recipe is so quick it actually takes way longer to use the pre-made frozen dough than to whip up a fresh batch!  I made drop biscuits both times and just patted into round shapes.  They don't split that evenly that way but they are so fast and delicious.

I am going to toss out all other biscuit recipes. Recipe is perfect & does not need "tweaked." Husband ate 4, and he does not like biscuits. He is a "roll" man. Best eaten immediately, as they did not reheat nicely the next day. Kudos for this recipe!!

I'm really impressed with how well this works, I was skeptical. I accidentally bought self-rising flour and was scouting ways to use it - this recipe came first. Of course, with only cream and flour, these bicuits taste pretty much like cream and flour. They worked great with Bill's Sausage Gravy from this site, but I wouldn't eat them plain. Thanks for the recipe - fun and easy. :)

5 stars for being surprisingly good and so very easy!  I made half a recipe, and added some italian herbs to go with my italian meal.  I was delighted and pleased.  I did add about 1/4 t. of salt, and I would do that again no matter if I added herbs or not.

Simple yet amazing. I made scones instead of biscuits and they are the best I have had. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup shredded coconut and 1/2 cup raisins, cinnamon and vanilla extract. They are addictive.

Great biscuit. I can see how it could get bland though... I feel as if it's wonderful with something, and can be a amazing building block for something more. Blew me away at how quickly I was able to make them.

Just as advertised! Super easy and two ingredients! Very light! I read other reviews and added salt but since self rising flour includes salt it doesn't need more in my opinion. Additional salt made the biscuits too salty. I used biscuits as topping for (fake) chicken and biscuits.

Amazing I must say - especially for how easy it is. I used whole wheat flour, and added about 1/4 cup more of heavy cream. I ate them with butter and honey, mmmm. Next time I will try adding shredded cheddar cheese to this before baking.

I had some leftover cream from another recipe on here and found this simple recipe. I made this last night to go with shepherds pie my husband had made and my family couldn't get enough of these! These were really easy to make too. My husband said they were the best biscuits I've ever made! Thank you for sharing such a simple but amazing recipe! I will be making these a lot more.

very easy, very quick, delicious. I also made the honey butter, it went very well together.
