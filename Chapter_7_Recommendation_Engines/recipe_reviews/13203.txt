This was easy. Based on other reviews, I pureed the broccoli/onion base. Then I added some finely chopped red peppers and chicken to give it texture and color. Don't let the soup boil after adding the cheddar- it will separate and you'll end up with something you didn't want.

Quick, easy and very tasty! I have now made this soup three times, in less than 2 weeks time. My 3 1/2 year old son declared it delicious and has been requesting it! The only thing I don't agree with is the amount servings. One recipe will feed my husband, my son and myself, along with a sandwich or burger, without a drop left. Also, I know it says that the cheese is optional, and I suppose it is. However, I used aged sharp white cheddar. Oh my, that is good. I also grated the onion on my cheese grater instead of chopping. That way we get the flavor of the onion and my son can't find them! Tonight we added some chopped cooked chicken and cooked pasta for a complete meal. I used to make a more complicated broccoli soup, but this one has replaced it!

I tried and rated this recipe in 2004, but because I had to add so much more broccoli than called for I guess I didn't bother to keep it in my recipe box, so today I read reviews and tried it again. Made 2 batches--1 with oregano and Mexican 4 cheeses from Kraft--the other no oregano and cheddar. I tried each batch before putting in the cheeses. My opinion is 1) you need twice as much broccoli as the recipe calls for 2)cheese is a must, 3)the amount of oregano was negligible. I preferred the oregano/Mexican chhese, but both were good. I will use this recipe again only with my alterations!!!

Excellent and so easy!  I made a few changes.  I cooked the onion and one minced clove of garlic in 2 Tbsps of butter then I added the broth brought it to a boil and tossed in the broccoli.  I didn't add the cheese to the soup, but served it as a garnish on top.  My husband and I gobbled it up  and soaked up the creamy broth with crusty french bread.  Thanks for the recipe Marge!  I'll definetly make it again.

I added powdered mustard and worcestershire sauce for extra zip.  My husband loved this soup!  I'm sure I'll be making it many times and it was so easy!

I am watching my carb intake so I omitted the flour completely and cut back on the milk quite a bit. The milk I used was fat free evaporated milk which made it creamy and thickened it up on it's own. I just added enough to give it a "creamy" look. This was very good--the cheeze was just enough to give it a nice flavor without going overboard. My husband even commented that it was good and he's not much of a soup eater. Next time, I think I'll puree the broccoli/onion with the chicken broth before adding the other ingredients and I'll add fresh minced garlic.

Very good. I added one diced stalk of celery and one diced carrot. Also added somme thyme and garlic power. Pureed some of the soup it the end- so it was part smooth and part chunky. Add the cheese...that shouldn't be optional.

I used fresh broccoli, added one shitake mushroom, one clove garlic. The onions, garlic, and mushroom were cooked in a separate pan in scant amount of oil while the broccoli steamed in the chicken broth. [The oregano was omitted at husband's request.] After the milk/flour concoction was added, along with onions, broccoli, etc. and had thickened, I pureed all before adding the (cheddar) cheese. Served with very crusty bread for dipping. Thank you for posting this.

It is a wonderful soup.  I am vegetarian, so I changed it to vegetable broth...which worked well.  I recommend trying this soup!

I made this several times and now make one consistent change. We like the chunks of broccoli so I steam it separately and add it after the soup thickens so that it doesn't disintegrate during the stirring process. Thanks for a recipe that is so easy and good without using processed cheese products. Edit 2/28/12: I save a bowl now by chopping the broccoli stems into the broth as directed and just adding the florets for a minute or so before the cheese.

Nothing says comfort like a nice warm, creamy bowl of this soup!  Definitely add the cheddar cheese - it makes it so rich and comforting.  Like others have said, I'm not sure how you would get 5 servings out of this - I made this and 2 of us ate the entire pot at one sitting!  We had thick slices of rosemary/olive oil bread warmed and slathered in butter to go with it.  Delicious!

This soup was super easy and very tasty!  I liked that it used fresh broccoli and cheese that was not processed cheese.  Also- I was amazed that it tasted so thick and creamy with no butter or heavy cream/half and half!  Next time, I will cut back the oregano just a bit (1/4 tsp.) and I will double the recipe (for us- this made 2 large bowls of soup).  Like others, I would say the cheese is a must!  Thanks for sharing- I will make this again.

This soup is delicious!  My husband will not touch broccoli or onions but, he ate this like it was candy!  It turned out only making about two servings for us, but maybe that's because it's so good!

Just made a big batch of this for my work week.  It was delicious!  As did some of the others, I also pureed it, along with the spices and cheese for a smoother soup.  The only thing is that I thought the oregano was a little overpowering, so next time I will use 1/4tsp rather than 1/2tsp.  Definitely keeping this recipe in the book.  Thank you for sharing!

This soup is simple, quick, and infinitely healthier than most of the butter and cream versions I've seen.  I don't really love the oregano because I feel it overpowers  the broccoli flavor, so I omit it or cut way down.  Also great with cauliflower!

I love this recipe for its simplicity, flavor and that it can be easily altered to be as low-fat as you like (the flavor doesn't come from the fat). Delicious as written, but I do prefer to double the broccoli, as I read in other reviews. I also enjoy throwing in some minced garlic cloves and shredded carrot for color. Thank you very much for posting an delicious alternative to all those broccoli soup recipes with icky processed cheese.

This is very good, but not exceptional.  However, it's great if you want cream of broccoli with fewer calories - a very tasty compromise.

This soup was very good, quick and easy.  Not quite as yummy as Panera or au bon pain, but much healthier without all the butter and cream or half-and-half.  All in all a good trade-off, since I got my broccoli-cheddar soup "fix" without all the guilt!  I did as others suggested and used less oregano, but no other changes.  I used lower sodium chicken broth and 2%-milk cheddar cheese, added a little salt and pepper to taste at the end.  I will definitely make this again, thank you for the recipe!  edit:  I changed my rating from four stars to five stars. Love it!  I just reheated the leftover soup I made yesterday, and it is even better the next day.  Just as yummy as restaurant broccoli-cheddar soup.  I will make this again and again.

I made this recipe to use up a bunch of over steamed broccoli.  I added a little garlic powder, and used reduced fat cheese.  So simple and so good.  My kids all loved it and I did, too...Definitely a keeper.

OMG amazing! How much easier or more delicious could it get? I used a bag of frozen broccoli which wound up being about 4 cups of it, but kept everything else the same. I followed others advice and threw half of the broccoli and the onion in the food processor, then followed the directions. Also added a few dashes of dried mustard. Next time I may add some shredded carrots. Thanks so much for the recipe:)

For as simple as this is, it is suprisingly good.  Only change I made was to use fat free half and half instead of milk.  Didn't use the oregano, just salt and pepper.

Yum-O!  Loved this soup!  It's quick and easy and you really can't go wrong with the flavours.  I've made this twice now (I doubled the broth and broccoli because my hubby and son LOVE soup but kept the milk/flour the same).  You can play around with the herbs and cheeses (I happend to grab the Italian seasoning and thyme this time, not just oregano), I added a dash of nutmeg and used a sharp cheddar.  I used my immersion blender just before adding the cheese.  Can't wait to maybe try it with some asiago for a different flavour.

I think this is great! This is the first time I've made a cream of broccoli soup. I used this one because it seemed simple, amd I like that! I made a couple alterations: added half a carrot, half a celery stick and I puréed them with the broc and onion before I added the milk part. Then I steamed about a cup more broc cut up in tiny pieces and added that when I added the cheese. I also doubled the cheese. Very good!  I also took a little of the onion out before I puréed, it smelled a bit oniony to me.

For how simple this recipe was, it was delicious!  I skipped the onion for preference, but did add some onion and garlic powder with the salt and pepper.  I also found my soup wasn't quite thick enough for me, so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and easy. I chopped up the broccoli and onion in the food processor and used fat free milk plus 2 tablespoons of 1/2 & 1/2. This soup is a keeper and I will be making in again.

This is my first Broccoli soup I cook and it was great!!  Super easy to make, I made some minor changes. I saute the onions in a little bit in butter, I also add half cup of white wine, and some paprika because I love spicy food. This recipe is delicious! better than in many restaurants!!

Really delicious, although I did make some minor changes.

1st, Used about 300g of Broccoli, as much as was in a bunch
2nd, NO FLOUR - I used 100ml of cream and 135 of milk and it was the perfect consistency
3rd, BLEND - once the broccoli is cooked with the onions in the stock, allow it to cool and then blend and add it back to the cooking pot

Everything else about this recipe was perfect and its the BEST broccoli soup i've ever had!

Delicious! I used skim milk, but I'm sure the soup would be even creamier if whole were used. I also pureed part of the broccoli with a handheld mixer but left lots of chunks. Very easy recipe!

I wasn't keen on the idea of whole broccoli florets swimming about in broth, so I used a hand blender to whizz it up. I then thought it wasn't nearly broccoli-ish enough, so I added another couple of cups, let it soften, then used the blender very briefly to chop up - not puree - the broccoli. The Cheddar cheese is an absolute must, imo. I also added a dash of heavy cream. I liked this a lot. Husband thought it was a tad salty. I would make it again, perhaps with a combination of broc and cauliflower. Thanks, Marge!

So quick and easy!  I followed the recipe and used my immersion blender to puree the soup after I added the milk.  The oregano was a perfect addition. Next time I will try some of the additions others have mentioned, but this soup is very tasty as written.

This is my new favorite cream of broccoli soup recipe. I did make modifications though. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 white onion, 2 cloves of garlic (minced), and sautéed the onion/garlic in 1 Tbsp of butter in the soup pot...once that was ready I added the chicken broth. Rather than 2 cups milk, I substituted 1 cup half and half. Also, I garnished with cheddar cheese and noticed it needed more salt and pepper than I initially thought. Served with French bread. Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this might be too good to be true, tasting great without any butter or cream, and for a lower fat soup it was decent, and for ease in preparation it's awesome! I thought about adding evaporated milk but decided to try 1% to see if you could get away with it, and it ended up being the perfect consistency to eat in a bread bowl, but if you want to boost the taste (and consequently the calories), I would use evaporated milk. It definitely helped to add cheese, I just wish I had sharp cheddar to boost the flavor. I would add less oregano however, it was a little overpowering. Luckily the kids ate it pretty well, even the non-broccoli lovers, so that's why I gave it 4 stars, for myself I would have given 3.

This was really good!  I love that it has fresh broccoli and not processed cheese.  After reading other reviews I added more broccoli (about 3 1/2 to 4 c) and almost another cup of chicken broth to help it boil in.  We love broccoli in our house, so I cut them in all sizes to cook so some broke down, but we still got some chunks in our soup. With all the extra I put in my husband, daughter (2yrs) and I finished almost all of it!  One nice sized bowl for leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is so easy to put together, it's cheap, and it tastes great! I also used a wand mixer to puree the broccoli a bit for a smoother consistency. I don't know what a "serving" is, but I doubled the recipe to use a 16 oz. bag of frozen broccoli. We ate this once as a meal with homemade rye bread and once as an appetizer, so the serving seemed a bit small, as I made a 10 serving batch. Definitely add the cheese. Thanks for the recipe, Marge!

This was delicious. I had to tweak it a bit due to not having fresh broccoli on hand. I also doubled the recipe.  I cooked a 12 oz bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower and then mashed a bit. I also used 4 cups of chicken bouillon as I didn't have chicken broth. I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee.... Fantastic. The kids loved it! Thanks so much for sharing!!

This soup was very yummy and my boyfriend loved it.  However, in order to make it for 4 servings, I found myself practically trippling all the ingredients, especially the broccoli, broth, flour and milk.  We like big, full bowls of soup, especially when it's real good!  And I love cheese, so we upped that too.....lol!  The soup is rich enough, but if you like a more substantial, creamy soup, I would recommend using half heavy cream with half the broth.  Quick and easy, we'll most likely make this soup again.

Delicious!  To be fair, I did make a few changes, as follows:  Used frozen broccoli, and ran half of it through a food processor until it was in pretty small chunks, used home made turkey stock instead of chicken broth, grated the onion on the smallest holes on my cheese grater because neither DH or I like chunks of onion, and used evaporated skim milk in place of whole milk, to give it a nice creamy taste without all the fat and calories, and omitted the oregano.  

That's a lot of changes, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  It was super easy, and I will absolutely make it again.

I am giving this a 5 because it was good and so easy and quick to make.  
I took the suggestion of another person on here and put my broccoli and onion in the food processor then cooked it in the broth.  
Doubled the recipe.  Used one bunch of fresh broccoli.

Really good soup!  Changes I made: I probably doubled the broccoli and tripled the milk and added cornstarch to thicken it more.  I also added some Worcestershire sauce.  I usually do more complex Broccoli soup and this was a good basic recipe!

I am totally addicted to this soup right now.  It is easy - it is healthier than most creamy broccoli soups, and it's made from stuff you typically have on hand.  I do pulse my cooked veggies in the  blender for a second or two before adding the milk/flour, and I season with liberal amounts of garlic powder in addition to salt and pepper.  But I find that making that puree of sorts doesn't leave you missing the cheese.  As a side note, I own a restaurant and I serve 2 different home-made soups daily.  This is one I proudly serve!

I made this for my daughter who just got braces, so she needed something soft.  Very delish.  I did increase the amount of broccoli and broth and sauted the onion with fresh garlic in SmartBalance butter blend first.  Also added 1/2 cup of heavy cream.  As long as you don't boil the cheese, you really can't mess this up.

I made this soup this evening and Boy was it Delicious.  I was searching for a recipe that did NOT include Velveeta (not a fan)  My 5 year old had 2 big bowls and My 1 year old ate a whole bowl himself.  I had so much Broccoli I ended up making a triple batch and sending some to my parents house they just called with rave reviews. I shared this recipe on my facebook

very good soup. my family loved it. It was quite lovley,however I did double the amout of broccoli and i found it worked much better. The soup was otherwise very filling and homey and my kids loved it. Four stars for a good recipe. also for anyone trying this recipe this soup loves pepper so don't be afraid to add some extra.

This was really lovely - I was surprised, actually!  My 2 year old, who turns his nose up at every green vegetable put in front of him, scoffed the lot!  I have to say, I agree with whoever said there should be more broccoli.  I added about 300g and it still had a really gentle flavour.  I prefered the soup before the cheese, but it was still lovely against the sharpness of the cheddar.  I blended it, as recommended by other reviews, and don't think I'll have it any other way now!  Quick, simple, and tasty!

I'm sensitive to dairy and wheat so I made some changes.  Instead of the milk I used 1/2 the container of silken tofu saved the other half for later.  Left out the cheese and flour.  It was so good, loved it! Used frozen vegetables so I can make this anytime.

Good, and healthy too.  I used left over veggies that were for dip.  Cauliflower, baby carrots, and broccoli.  I processed half of the mixture in the blender.  I used corn starch instead of flour because I don't like the taste of flour.  I also put the cheese on top, so I could control how much fat I was putting on my soup.  Will make again.  Kids ate lots of veggies and they don't know it!!!

Really good...I pureed about 1/2 of the mixture, depends how chunky you like it, and added, a dash or so to taste of nutmeg, and sherry...I always use fat free milk, when I can, to keep my food on the healthier side...my guests love it!

I like this soup only for dipping bread or breadsticks in it. Maybe next time I will not add the flour-milk mixture, because without it the soup was a wonderful greeen colour and nice taste.

Easy and great tasting! I substituted leeks for the onion and sauteed them in a TBS of butter prior to adding the broccoli. I added 3 medium carrots and upped the chicken broth to 32 oz. (one carton), which fixed the serving size problem. I also pureed the soup prior to adding the flour/milk mixture. The cheese is essential, it gives the soup a great flavor. Even though I thinned it down a bit with the extra chicken broth, the soup was still creamy, without being heavy. My whole family raved about this recipe!

Great recipe.I added about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of grated carrots. When you don't add oregano and pepper it tastes exactly like the broccoli cheddar soup from panera bread.I will absolutley fix this again. Everyone could'nt stop eating!

I loved this recipe so much I wanted to make it for friends to jazz it up a bit I added 1 to 1 and a half cups of cooked gnocchi. I also sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the onion before adding to the stock. I grated aged parmesan over instead of adding cheese to the soup. It Simple and Tasty!

Perfect for a cold day. I used fat free milk, so I added 1 additional tbs. of flour. Cheese should not be optional in the soup. I omitted the oregeno b/c I thought it sounded weird and it came out perfect.

I'm giving it four stars because I made a few substantial changes:  omitted the oregano, added mustard powder, used half light cream cheese and half grated sharp cheddar.  I also threw in a bit of mozzarella I had, used whole wheat flour and 1% milk and vegetable broth.  I thought it was great, and it took about 10 minutes to make.  Nice and rich tasting.

This was really good. I sauteed the onion in 2 tbsp. butter, and used extra cheese. I also added a bit of mustard powder. I only had frozen broccoli and it worked well. I will leave out the oregano next time because to me the flavor was too overpowering. This recipe is so easy, and very good!

Very nice recipe.  Very easy and quick to make too, which is really nice.  Doesn't make 5 servings though (2 or 3 bowls).  Double it up if you are making for more than 2 people.

I made a few changes to suit my tastes.  Like another review, I sauteed up the onion with a clove of garlic (I put garlic in just about everything).  I chopped up the broccoli into small pieces, then after they cooked in the broth, I used an immersion blender to puree the broc and onion, but I left some chunks for texture.

In my opinion, the cheese is key to the recipe, the soup is somewhat bland without it (oh yeah, I added lots of pepper too, but that's also standard for me).

Great recipe, thanks!

This was a great recipe and very easy. I did make a couple of changes: I made a double batch (which didn't make a ton, either), and used 1 pkg. frozen broccoli/califlower/carrot mix (thawed); I sauteed the onion with 2 cloves garlic in canola oil and then added broth; added a dash of cayenne and the, used the immersion blender just before adding the flour mixture; used 1/4 cup heavy cream; and only about 3/4 of the cheese. 
However, I am sure the soup would be fine without all of my additions. It's a great basic recipe to tweak to suit your taste.

Delicious.  I added some celery salt and didn't have oregano so I put in a dash of Italian seasoning.  Also, I added cubed ham.  I'd make it every other day if I could!

This was pretty yummy with the substitutions I made. I used a head of broccoflower instead. I also used veggie broth. I used skim milk and then added a big splash of heavy cream. Didn't have any oregano. I pureed some of it to make it creamier. Everyone thought it was yummy, so next time I will double it since it only made about 3 servings.

Good soup. I tweaked it a little bit here and there, mostly adding more shredded cheese. My daughter liked this as well as my husband. My son didn't. Made a lot of soup.

I made this for dinner tonight. I did like the flavor I did use Veggie stock instead of Chicken stock and it did taste good. I do think it was missing something but I am not sure what. Good Flavour base! Will make again maybe will add in some other seasoning.

Great start to a recipe I now love! I doubled the broccoli, added parmesan and cheddar (a lot!) and added more spices and a bit of apple cider vinegar to cook down to add some zing. That was my 2nd attempt and it was a hit.

I made this soup tonight and it is excellent! I doubled the recipe based on another review and it was just enough for our family of four. I had to add a little more flour mixed with a bit of water just to thicken it up a little bit but that may have been because I double the recipe, otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly and it is superb.

Very easy to make and very tastey. I did omit the oregano. This soup is also as good as Panera Bread.
I also added more cheader cheese. I will make this again.

Good.  I used homemade ham stock and it needed a little salt but other wise it was good.

Easy and delicious.  Mother Ann suggested this soup on thebuzz and I had a lot of broccoli to use up.  This soup was very quick to put together.  I actually liked the leftovers for lunch the next day the best.  The flavors just seemed to meld together.  I forgot to add the Cheddar cheese and will probably not add it the next time since we enjoyed it so much as I fixed it.

Followed the recipe and doubled amount of broccoli. Omitted the oregano. Love that all the ingredients are fresh and healthy. Served with salad and warm sourdough rolls. YUM!

If you want to make a "meal" out of this soup there is no way you get 5 servings out of this soup. I would say the original recipe would barely feed 2 normal sized hungry adults. I doubled the recipe and got just over 3 decent size servings. I added close to 6 cups of broccoli and didn't add the oregano based on other reviews. I liked that it used fresh ingredients as opposed to overly processed ones, but I don't think I would make it again. It was ok...not great.

What a refreshing change from frozen broccoli and processed cheese soup.  I pureed the broccoli and red onion together before adding it to the broth.  I also used cornstarch to thicken it instead of milk and flour.  I look forward to making this soup again.

I'm giving it 5 stars for the base of the soup....I of course made my own addages of celery, carrots, yellow potatoes, poultry seasoning, and w the 2 cups of cheddar, I added 1/2 small velveeta.  This is the best soup ever.  Even using it as a 'dip' with crackers is awesome.  My 3 yo is loving it!!  Thanks for the recipie :) Happy cooking everyone!

I thought this tasted allright. I used frozen broccoli to save time and ended up adding a couple more seasonings, when it was done, for added flavor. I thought the oregano seemed like a bit much and did half and it was plenty. It makes no more than 4 cereal bowl sized servings.

Flavor was good, though a little bland but I thought it was too thin and needed more broccoli.  A good basic recipe to branch off from.

Very average recipe. Easy to make, and for sure put the soup into the blender to grind up the broccoli, I was wondering why the instructions left that out! The finer the grind the better, I was surprised at how quickly the broccoli got ground up so I turned off the blender prematurely. Hence I didn't get a very creamy soup, since there was still plenty of texture from tiny broccoli bits. Next time!

I loved this!  I got four small bowls of this, so it is definitely a side dish.  I chopped my broccoli up into very small pieces before I measured out 2.5 cups, so I definitely had enough broccoli.  It actually turned out to be a very thick soup.  I saw that other reviewers pureed their's, so I did the same with mine except that left about 1/2 cup of broccoli and onion chunks.  I tasted the soup before I added the cheese and it was very good without cheese.  I did add some seasonings to it (thyme, dill, celery seasoning).

Very quick and easy and tasted great!  Changes---used American cheese instead of cheddar and added a couple small potatoes and then mashed the veggies some after they cooked in the broth.

This was recipe was a good base however I did not like the oregano.  The oregano over powered the soup.  I will try making this again but without the oregano.  Also, I pureed the ingredients to make it smoother and not chunky.

Delicious.  I close to double the amount of broccoli and chop it small before cooking.  Also use thyme instead of the oregano.

This soup was lovely. I made it for a get together over the holidays and everyone was impressed. I blended the soup before I added the cheese, I think this brings out the broccoli flavor a little more and gives a nice texture. I also added double the flour to make the soup a little thicker. Would definitely make this again.

Great receipe, easy and quick. Only wished I had increased the amount. I followed the receipe for 5 servings and only got enough for 3 servings. Next time I'll double the receipe and if necessary freeze some.

So easy a husband can make it! I double though because we like it as a meal.  Definatly too much oregano though, I used about 1/2 the second time I made it.  It definatly needs the cheese! I made this the week we all had colds and it felt so cozy and good going down!

Used 1 lb bag frozen broccoli and also added a shredded carrot; looked just like the broccoli cheddar soup from Panera! I will add more salt next time, but overall this was great.

Super simple recipe--like 5minutes! After the broccoli cooked I stirred in the cheese and milk with a whisk--that was enough to 'break up' some of the broccoli, but still leave some bigger pieces. Doubled the recipe and that used 2 heads of fresh broccoli, with a little leftover. Excellent, quick and easy!!!!

Very good and very easy to fix.  Only modifications I made were to cook the broccoli and onions in the microwave for about five minutes, then put it in the blender along with a cup of half and half and the seasonings.  But if you're making it for more than six people, the recipe needs to be tripled at least.  Thanks a lot for an easy meal!

This soup is fabulous!!!! It is so quick and easy. It is my favorite broccoli cheese soup. I would like to suggest that when adding the flour to the milk, use a whisk or blender on low speed. It makes the thickening process go a lot faster.

so very easy to make and used broccoli out of my own garden. i didn't have any oregano so added some cayene pepper, also put 3/4 of it through the blender to make it smooth then quickly did the last 1/4 to keep some chunks.  didn't have any but will make it with bacon pieces next time.

This was so easy and very good.  I did not have fresh broccoli, so I used a frozen, bagged mixture of broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower.  I didn't measure the oregano, I only added a pinch, which was just the right amount.  Any more would've been overpowering.  I also used skim milk and mozzarella cheese.  It was so creamy - - never would've known it was low-fat.  I had leftovers the next day, which were even better.  This combination of veggies reminds me of a creamy soup a neighborhood restaurant serves...creamy vegetable medley, I think.  Thanks Marge!  I will make this again and again.

I'm cooking for one this week so I'm trying to keep it simple and relatively healthy.  Taking less than 20 minutes from chopping the veggies to scraping the bottom of the bowl, this fit the bill!
The only change I made was to zap it with the immersion blender a bit before adding the cheese.

This was really delicious.  Used Veggie broth and like a previous reviewer, wasn't so sure about big broccoli florets so I broke down and used the blender for just a split second.  Flavor was great.  Do yourself a favor and add the cheese.  Will make this again!

I fried the celery, onions, shredded carrots and broccoli in three tablespoons of vegan margarine. Then added an extra cup of ckn broth, extra 1/2 cup of lactose free milk. Two extra tablespoons of flour too. I also added Traeger Blackened spice and sea salt. The dish was completely lactose free and delicious!

Made this soup yesterday. I made some changes, instead of milk, I used coconut milk, added some carrots, and as per some suggestions, I sautéed the onion and garlic and than added the broth which i somewhat diluted to lessen the salt. It still came  out very delicious.No need to put the cheese. Very easy and simple to make.

Delicious! I did 1.5 times the recipe with 2 times the broccoli and a few small changes. I caramelized the onions, added a bit of celery and then added broccoli with stock to boil. I blended the soup with a hand blender before I added the milk/flour mixture. I did not, however,  increase the amount of oregano, but did add a bay leaf. The cheese I used was the grated cheese mix from Costco. Simple and easy!

This really did not "knock my socks off".   It was okay, not awful, not great. Just seemed a bit bland.   Will find a different recipe next time I have broccoli I want to use up.

I made this and other broccoli soups from AR over the last winter. This one was ok, it is definitely kinda on the thick side. 
I used some extra chicken broth to liquid it up. I couldn't eat it when it was so thick. 
But all in all a pretty good recipe. I would def. make it again and play around with it. It is my #2 broccoli soup recipe I would say. 
 :-)

This is my all-time favourite soup. I've tried many different broccoli soup recipes and they all end up too thin and watery, or with a very bland flavour. This soup is rich and thick and is packed with so much flavour. The one change I make is that I add a lot more oregano than it calls for, the flavour it adds is amazing. I always double or triple the recipe so I have lots of leftovers, and it never lasts long in my house!! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

Since I didn't have any fresh broccoli, I used a 12 oz. bag of frozen broccoli. It worked just fine with the amounts of the other ingredients. After the broccoli was tender, I removed the crowns but left the larger pieces of stem. I used the immersion blender to blend up stems. I then added the crowns back in. My only problem with this soup is I did not at all like the addition of the oregano. I tasted the soup before adding any, then tasted again after adding only 1/4 tsp. Amazing how only 1/4 tsp. oregano gave such a heavy flavor. I believe this would be perfect for my family if I omitted the oregano.

I was looking for a quick soup. This definitely fit that bill. But it just wasn't very good. I can see that if you added things, pureed it, and went "up from here," it may be okay. But as is -- no thank you.

I had a tooth issue and was looking for a nutritious lower fat soup that I could eat without much chewing and this one fit the bill.  I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk because that's all I had and I think that added a richer flavor.  I also roughly mashed the broccoli so that there weren't big chunks because of my tooth problem and I liked that texture.  I did add the cheese(2% milk, lower fat)and thought that added some flavor that would have been missing otherwise.  So much better than the nasty canned or packaged soup.  Will definitely make this again, thanks for sharing this easy recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I read the reviews and made just a few small changes:  I sauteed the onion and a clove of garlic before adding the broccoli and broth.  And I used a can of lowfat evap milk since I only keep almond milk in the house.  I did add the cheese, and it does make it ultra-yummy.  So nice to find  a recipe without cream and/or processed cheese.  Thank you!

Great recipe.  I used cream instead of thickening milk and also doubled the amount of broth.  I felt there wasn't enough soup base.  I just cut the broccoli pretty fine and didn't feel the need to puree it after.  Great texture and fantastic flavour considering the recipe was fairly basic!

It was definitely very quick..but at the expense of some flavor.  Next time, I'll saute the onion and maybe some carrots in butter first.  It was still tasty, but maybe adding the powdered mustard as someone recommended, or some nutmeg, to give it another zip!

I wanted to love this recipe but I just did not. I thought it was bland. Perhaps a little salt would have helped, but it would not have done the job. My husband, however, did enjoy it and was happy with it. So I thought three stars would be a nice compromise. Others have loved this soup. I really liked the idea of starting with a chicken broth as the base and the simple-ness of the recipe. I will look some more for the right soup for me.

Very yummy on a cold day. However, I omitted the onions and added diced potatoes and either apple wood smoked or hickory bacon. Super good either way.

I would rate this a 5 star I made this just as the recipe called for.We could not believe how creamy and rich it tasted. I put the broccoli and the onion in my food processor before cooking it and then after it was cooked ran it through the processor again then added the milk, flour and cheese. Sargedom

this recipe is a good simple creamy soup. when I made this I did tweak it to my own taste. I used a roux (equal parts butter and flour) to thicken this instead of just flour. I also added about a 1/4 cup of cream. One other thing I did was cook down the onions in about 1T of butter to soften them up and to add a little more flavor.

This recipe was super easy and very tasty.  Great recipe for the young chef.  My 7 year old was fascinated that we made such a delicious soup in minutes with just a few ingredients.  Definitely going into the cookbook for many years of enjoyment!

This is a very basic broccoli soup.  I was looking for something healthy and lo cal after the holiday and this fit the bill.  Despite using my homemade chicken broth, I thought the soup still lacked complexity but it was still good.

Watery yet thick at the same time, I think the beer made it watery but on the up side it also did take the bitter taste out of the Broccoli

Very yummy.  I made 1.5 times the recipe since a can of broth is about 1.5 cups.  I doubled the broccoli and added a couple carrots.  Next time I would increase the cheese a bit.

The original recipe is perfect. I changed the amount of broccoli and oregano the second time I made it for personal preferences. I used 3 cups broccoli rather than 2 1/2 and 1/4 t dried oregano rather than 1/2.

Delicious!  I blended broccoli/onion (minus broth) ater veggies were soft. Blended until smooth. Returned to pot.  Brought back boil, added cheese, spices.  Returned to boil.  To serve, layered cooked pasta, then hot soup.  We added Tapatillo.

This was delicious! After following recommendations from other reviewers, I doubled the recipe, and it made about 5 servings that disappeared very quickly. I doubled everything except the cheese, 1- 8oz block of sharp cheddar was just enough, and anymore would have been overwhelming in my opinion.

Did not go over well here at all. I followed the recipe except that I pureed the broccoli a bit like others had recommended. My son that will eat anything couldn't even eat this. I thought it was just edible, nothing that I would make again.

REALLY GOOD!! I added a little more broccoli, almost 4 coups, I like substance in my soups. And a little more cheddar, and I used Sargentos SHARP cheddar, made a huge difference. I could definently double up the recipie, it goes pretty fast. Otherwise AWESOME!

Great soup and very easy to make! Instead of cheddar I used Dubliner Irish cheese (about half of what the recipe called for) and the soup was delicious! I also added a bit of garlic and one stalk of celery like other reviewes mentioned.

i liked that this recipe didnt call for butter or processed cheese (velveta/american) which is why i made it. i added some parsley and diced celery in addition to the onion & cooked it with the flour and a little chicken broth first (about a 1/4 cup). then i added the rest of the liquid ingredients, brought them to a boil, then added the broccoli last and cooked it for a only a few minutes because im not a fan of over-cooked broccoli, i like it soft but still crisp at the same time. i also added the cheese to our bowls, rather than the pot of soup itself... my husband and i both enjoyed this, it was a great way to use up some of the fresh broccoli we had.

I thought this was a nice change from the real cheesy broccoli soup. I sauteed the garlic and onions - thats about all I changed - its very good  - I'll use it from now on - you can taste the broccoli - not just cheese.

i liked this recipe because it was easy, but i made a few changes (many recommended by other people as well.) i sauteed the onion in olive oil first, added garlic, cooked the broccoli for longer, added more broccoli than the recipe called for, and mixed it all in the blender before adding the milk and flour. the cheese is a must! overall, a good base recipe for an easy, tasty soup.

This recipe is awesome!! Very easy to make, only changed a couple of things. Instead of milk I used Heavy Cream. after the brocoli gets soft I used a Masher to breakdown the brocoli into smaller pieces. Made it for a dinner party so I had to make it ahead of time. I made it in my rice cooker and let it simmer til I was ready to serve... Was a hit with everyone. Definitely will make this recipe again.

We love it.  I used left over broccoli that I had in the freezer.  I did saute the onion and a garlic clove in a little butter.  Then I pureed the onion, garlic, and broccoli.  Salt and pepper (love that pepper) are a must.  Didn't have cheddar  so the Italian in me said "Parmesan". Try it you'll like it.

This is an excellent soup, however, I did make a change or two. First, I used 3 cups of chicken broth and added 1/2 cup of cream to the 1 cup of milk.  I needed to add 6 Tbsp of flour to get the right thickness for the soup. I also minced, very finely, the onion and the broccoli stems in a food processor and left the heads whole. The oregano was a perfect pairing to the soup, it really brought out the flavors well.

This soup was just ok. I used 3/4c skim milk and 1/4c fat free h&h. I also used reduced fat cheddar. Maybe it had something to do with the changes I made, but this soup was just a little bland for me.

This is fabulous!!! Very easy to make, a great way to get rid off excess broccoli. I love how the oregano and broccoli taste together. I actually used, 1% milk and 2% cheese to lower the fat and calorie content and it still maintained its thickness and is still very tasty. I'm a very picky eater so that's sayin' a lot!

Ohhhh soooo good! I wanted it to be super creamy so I changed the milk to heavy cream. It definetly needs salt cause otherwise it will be bland tasting. I used Sea Salt cause I like the flavor it gives soups. I also left out the oregano cause I dont care for it much. I also blended the broccoli and broth before adding the cream and flour. Just delicious soup!

For a lower calorie soup, this is really good. I made it for my husband and a friend and they really liked it! The only change I made was adding a little garlic powder in addition to the minced garlic, and I used mozzarella cheese because I was out of cheddar-ended up fantastic!

My family enjoyed this very much with a loaf of French bread for dinner. I did add an extra cup of broccoli plus 2 stalks of celery chopped, cut the flour down to 1 Tbsp. and omitted the oregano (preference only). I also pureed the soup and definitely added the cheddar cheese for flavor. Thanks for a really nice recipe!

This was very quick & easy. I used a hand blender to puree the broccoli and onions in the broth to make it thicker. Didn't think the flour was necessary. I was looking for a recipe that required basic ingredients and didn't call for heavy cream. Thanks for sharing.

This was an excellent recipe!  Very simple and healthy.  I used reduced sodium chicken broth and skim milk and added a little extra flour to increase thickness.  I used a hand blender to puree the mixture just prior to adding the milk and flour mixture.  I sprinkled cheese on top of each bowl and it really make this dish.  I will be putting it in my regular rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My family loved this.  Pureed the soup and doubled the recipe.  I actually used some half and half - because my hubby wanted it rich - it was good, but next time I may try it will milk only.

This was really good and easy soup. I ate this for five days in a row at dinner. I am going to make it again soon too. I actually used about 3/4 old cheddar and 1/4 parmesan for this recipe. I think I made it a little grainy, but no matter! Still good.

I have become so addicted to this soup!  It is by far the easiest and quickest soup you can make.  I double the recipe and to keep the cholesterol lower, I use half the amount of cheese which is enough for me. Great recipe for diabetics or those on a low carb diet.

This was really fuss-free and yet delicious! My dad grimaced when I told him that it was broccoli soup but after tasting it he said it was very tasty! Will definitely make again.

I thought the 1 cup of cheese was sooo sinful so to make this soup a little healthier, you can cut down on the cheese (I added only about 2 tablespoons because my family tends to like soups that are not overly cloying. This makes the texture less thick but I think it still tastes superb!

This soup is easy, quick, and delicious.  It's not too fancy and hits the spot.  I always double it as the recipe is a small amount. I agree with other reviewers that it helps to blend it to make a smoother soup.

This was pretty good for a quick soup.  As other reviewers said this does not make a lot - next time i would definitely double the recipe and add more flour to make it a little bit thicker and possibly omit the oregano since it added a bit too much tangy-ness to the soup.

I thought this was excellent.  Easy, healthy, and tasty.  I chopped my broccoli. I made a few changes to make it vegan: I used vegetable broth. I used soymilk instead of milk and in addition to the flour, I added nutritional yeast, garlic salt, and pepper to taste. Didn't use the oregeno.

I tried this recipe as an alternative to one I usually do  that calls for half and half or a heavy cream in it and that says to saute the butter and onions then add flour  as some reviews of this one suggest.  I was surprised at how little in taste and texture this recipe was in comparison.  Still it is edible and easy.

I was looking for a quick and easy soup and came upon this recipe. Everyone loved it, but I did make a few additions...sauteed onion and garlic in a half of stick of butter, only had one can of regular chicken broth, the other can was chicken broth with garlic, used frozen bag of broccoli florets and had to add a little extra of milk and flour, we like it on the thicker side. This will certainly be made again.

I agree with a few others...this recipe does need the cheddar cheese, it shouldn't be an option...the serving size is not correct to agree with another reviewer.I also put a bit of butter(smart balace) and salted/peppered it a bit more as well.  Other than that, a great base recipe without all the "condensed cream of..." added to it..

Excellent, easy, tasty. I blended the broccoli before serving. Easy to modify.

It was good, but I was looking for something a bit creamier. I also found it was too much oregano.

I cooked it in my rice cooker (which also has a "soup" setting, and it took much longer than I expected it to, especially since there is no cook time listed on this recipe. I'd estimate it took about half an hour, though I have no idea how that translates to stove-top time. 

I might try this again, using heavy cream instead of milk, or more flour, or some other adjustments.

I really enjoyed this, even though I let the milk curdle by boiling it.  Once in awhile I get broccoli-cheese soup at a local restaurant and this is just as good.  My kids wouldn't try it, though; I think it was too "green" for them.  :)  I thought the cheese was necessary, though; I tasted it before adding the cheese, and thought it was rather bland.

Great recipe! Loved it.  I was wanting a basic creamy broccoli soup recipe and this fit the bill.  You can tweek it however you like but the basic recipe is great.  Thanks Marge!

Great soup!  I followed all the steps.  Tried it.  Then added the cheddar, and loved it both ways.  YUMMY!

Very satisfying soup. I make it all the time for a simple weekend lunch for me and my husband. I add Eidam cheese instead of cheddar. I think the soup needs a little something extra to punch it up. Next time, I might try other reviewers' suggestions and add garlic and/or worchestershire sauce.

I liked the texture because I'm not a fan of pureed soups, but I'll definitely do something to add more kick next time, found it a little bland.

Was very good.  I followed the recipe with one exception.  Instead of using cheddar cheese I used Dill and Herb Havarti.  It was nice, but cheddar would have been much better.  All in all, an easy and delicious recipe.

The easiest and best tasting soup ever!  I sauted the onion and some garlic with 2 T. butter like another reviewer and pureed 2/3 of the cooked broccoli and onion before adding the milk/flour mixture.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious, but in reviewing the quantity of ingredients, there was no way this would make 5 servings.  (I don't know what you consider a "serving")  I doubled the ingredients and it barely made enough for 5.  Very good soup!

Very fast.  Very yummy.  I used swiss instead of cheddar.  Delicious.  Will make again.  Will try what the others suggested and put in some hame or bacon.  Yummy!

This was sooo yummy! I ended up adding diced ham to this. I used this to go into "Italian Bread Bowls" from this site. Thanx for sharing this keeper!

This was a hit at my house. Broccoli taste was great and the cheese really made it creamy. Very good over baked potatoes too!

Very good.  Next time I would omit the oregano.
