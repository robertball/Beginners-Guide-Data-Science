Excellent salmon! I really wanted to make this on the outdoor grill, but we are in the middle of a heat wave right now and it's too hot to do anything outside. So I ended up making this on the George Foreman Grill. I marinated the salmon for about 3 hours and the salmon was so tender and flavorful. I set some of the marinade aside and simmered it on the stove for a few minutes then spooned it over top the finished salmon. Delicious! Can't wait to try this on the outdoor grill.

I've used this technique for years. I made it for the wedding receptions of both my kids, and quickly gained the reputation for making the best Salmon in the West. A couple of tricks: I marinate the fillets in the bottom of a cooler, or in a glass baking dish in the fridge. I sprinkle each fillet with a touch of kosher salt, cover the fillets with brown sugar and drizzle soy sauce on top of the sugar. This draws the natural juices from the Salmon, and turns into a thick dark syrup after a 1/2 hour or so. I let the salmon marinate for several hours. I then quickly rinse the fillets to remove excess sugar and place on the grill flesh side down. This creates the unmistakable grill lines of charbroiled salmon. Watch carefully to not overcook. Check the ends of the fillets. Once you see the salmon has turned opaque about 1/4-1/3 of the way through, slide a couple of spatulas underneath and slide the fillet toward you and flip it away from you. Now that the skin side is down, you can allow it to BBQ as long as you need to until it is done. Once flipped I like to spread a heated mixture of spicy BBQ Sauce (like Cattle Boyz) and butter on top of the flesh as it continues to grill. NOTE: 1) try to grill pieces that are a consistent thickness. Cut thin sections off the fillets and grill them separately. 2) Do not overcook. The flakes should be somewhat translucent in the center. Overcooked salmon will be dry and lose most of its flavour. 3) I do not recommend re-using the marinade!

OH MY GOSH!  This is the best marinade ever!  Seriously, my husband was late coming home from work and I almost ate his salmon too!  I saved the marinade and threw shrimp in for the next night and that was great too!  Trying chicken tonight.  Added 1/4 C lemon juice because I didn't have lemon pepper.  Seriously, BEST EVER!  Thanks for sharing Heather!!

I only had time to marinate for 15 minutes.  So then I wrapped serving sizes in aluminum foil (with generous amount of marinade in there, too), and put on the grill for 15 minutes.  Came out great!  

If you try this, watch and smell for burning around the 15-minute mark.  if the marinade cooks off, it can burn if you leave on too long.

I'm a chef and I was looking for something a little different to glaze my fiance's salmon. She absolutely loved this glaze. I had no problem with the flavor of the glaze going throughout the whole salmon as I was glazing the salmon frequently while it was grilling. Great glaze. Thank you

This is a great, simple marinate for salmon! I chose to broil it in the oven (5 minutes per side) and it turned out great! It was the perfect flavor for salmon! I used to get No-Name Salmon Filets, but now there may not be the need!

It's very full of flavor, but it's a bit too sweet, I also added lemon juice, it was wonder full, next time just down the sugar to a few teaspoons less, but great recipe, very tasty and easy.

I know I should be eating salmon (it's a superfood!), so I've tried out many recipes on this site trying to find the best way too cook the fish. After literally years of looking, I found it! I couldn't believe that such simple ingredients--especially the dried herbs, could blend together to make such a great flavor. I followed it exactly as written. I used fresh salmon and marinated it almost 24 hours. Thanks for the great recipe, Heather!

Absolutely Delish! This was the first time I grilled Salmon, and this marinade was quick, easy, and complimented the fish greatly.
 I recommend this to anyone looking to get their feet wet with trying salmon for the first time. You won't be disapointed.

This is the best salmon I've cooked at home. It also worked in the oven. I cooked it at 400 degrees, and the marinade caramelized around the fish. Yum-mie!!

Oh my gosh-this was so good.  I usually do salmon w/ dill, garlic & lemon but I always love a new salmon recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I admit a lot of the time I don't do b/c I usually add something or another).  This was so good.  I too had to use a George Foreman b/c I do not own an outdoor grill and I only made 2 filets so I halved the ingredients.  The only thing I changed was I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I placed the filets into a glass dish, sprinkled salt on each, and then poured the marinade over them and made sure they were completely covered.  I left it in the fridge, covered, for about an hour and then cooked them on the Foreman grill on medium heat for about 5 minutes. They were cooked perfectly. I served them over a spinach & arugala salad and asparagus and rice as the sides.  Thank you SO much for this recipe-I would have never thought of this on my own and it was SO good.

This turned out well although I was a bit disappointed that the marinade didn't carry through the salmon more.  It was merely a surface flavor and felt it would have been nicer if the flavor had been stronger.  However, it was very good.  I had one large 2 lb. fillet so I found it easier to mix up the marinade in a large pan and place the salmon in.  I flipped it around and left it, skin side up, to marinate covered in the fridge for over an hour.

I'm a salmon idiot - it's always horrible and dry.  This is the best salmon on the planet I think.  I'm not even crazy about salmon - eating it only because I'm supposed to for health.  But THIS recipe is so easy and makes the salmon taste so, so good.  It's a definite keeper for me!  Thanks, Heather!

This dish turned out excellent. I broiled mine instead of grilling it. Made it for dinner, and my husband adored it. I do think I might use a little less sugar next time though.

delicious.  Our family went from not so excited about eating Salmon to being happy to eat it 2 days in a row.  Great Recipe.  Marinated it 24 hrs, and had some more at 48.  It does setup well.

Yeah, this was good and super easy.  Not a big fan of salmon, but while at the store they were practically giving it away so we ended up with like pound or more of it so I double the recipe (just to make sure) and wow, delicious. Cooked on an inside grill and the third piece of salmon I baked. 350 for like 30 min.  We'll have leftovers today - maybe salmon cakes? Anyway, finally a recipe whereby I can really enjoy salmon! Thanks!

AWESOME recipe!   This is my first time writing a review, that is how good this recipe is!  I have used it 3 times now and every time it turns out perfect.  The longer you marinate it, the better it is.  I use the lower sodium soy sauce.  To die for the next day served cold on a bed of lettuce with your favorite dressing!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Those who love salmon rated it 5 stars and those who are trying to like salmon gave it 5 stars!  Marinated it and then cooked on a cedar plank on the grill for about 20 minutes.  It was moist and extremely flavorful!

My husband loved it! Did not have garlic powder so substituted with salt and was still superb!. Use the excess marinate as a topper by heating it on the stove and glazing it over the finished fish. With wild rice and string beans seasoned with Badia; my husband said to mark this dish as his favorite. 
Thanks a bunch!

This was the first time I grilled salmon, and my husband doesn't like soy sauce, so I was concerned he may not like this version.. But he loved it! My kids ages 10 & 7 loved it as well.. Big hit and healthy! The marinade was an excellent blend! (I didn't have lemon pepper handy so I used a tbs of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of black pepper).

Very good. Thought it might be salty or oily, but neither. We will try just 1 1/2T olive oil though next time. Did boil marinade to put over salmon when finished as others suggested. Already gave this recipe to someone else.

It is difficult to rate this recipe since I don't eat fish.  I made this for my husband, who said it was dry but had a nice flavor.  More than likely, this was due to grilling too long.   I also used frozen salmon; not sure if that was a mistake.

I loved it I followed the recipe exactly except for the parsley; I marinated 4 salmon steaks all day. (caught on the beautiful Coast of B.C., Canada)  its great a bit sweet ( I have a sweet tooth anyway and it saves from having dessert); boiled the marinade as well and poured over the top, yummy!!! a bit of lemon would tone it down (I will use it next time) the salmon are really fresh and abundant at this time of year the sockeye season just opened! Happy fishing and cooking.

This recipe was delicious!!! The marinade is amazingly easy and relatively easy on time. Other marinade's require more hours.  I made it for dinner & my guy said, "Thank you honey, that dinner was so good, what was that seasoned with!!!" Five stars *****

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out GREAT!  I marinated the salmon for about an hour and a half and cooked them on the George Foreman grill!  So easy and so good!  A keeper for sure!

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have thyme, so I used dill weed which we love, especially with salmon.  From now on when we have salmon for dinner, I'll have quite a dilema trying to decide between Heather's Grilled Salmon and Grilled Firecracker Salmon!  They're both so good.

Excellent marinade. I marinated all the salmon for about 5 hours. My husband and I enjoyed the salmon and fought over the leftovers the next day! Fine restaurant quality!

I'm a foodie and love to cook. I have had to learn to like slamon over the years because it is healthy. I've tried many recipes and this by far is the very best grilled salmon my husband and I have ever tasted. This rivals any gourmet restuarant's salmon.  The marinade is great  and the secret to great grilled salmon is to NOT overcook it.  Place skin side down on a hot charcoal or gas grill and let cook for no longer than about 7 or 8 min. We do not turn it over. The center of the salmon should be moist and wet looking and undercooked. It will continue cooking as it sets off the grill.

this is the first time I have eaten salmon and REALLY enjoyed it!  it was so moist and juicy, usually , I find salmon to be dry.  And my guests who do not care for soy marinade, absolutely loved it !  so give it a try! I will definitely make this again.

I marinated my sockeye for a couple of hours, and the only change I made was to reduce the brown sugar by half, and use some yellow onoin I had in the freezer since I had no shallots on hand. I cooked it on my Foreman grill, and it was amazing. The Boss did ask me to up the sugar by a bit next time, but this recipe got the coveted green check and is going in the binder!

I loved this recipe and so did my picky daughter who "did not" like salmon!!  She loves it now.  I tried both oven and grill and you just can't mess this up.  I even let it marinade over night (I forgot about it) and it was still DELICIOUS!!

This was really delicious! I let it marinate about 2 hours and cooked on an indoor grill (it was 18 degrees outside). Made for a lovely meal served with baked potatoes and sauteed green beans, peppers, and mushrooms.

Excellent!  My grill's been acting up lately so I just baked on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil at 450 for 15 minutes.  Instead of shaking off the marinate and discarding it, I spooned most of it over the salmon to bake with it.

I don't eat meat or fish but I made this for my gf and and sister and they loved it. I didn't have thyme but I used a bit of rosemary and apparently it worked out just fine.

I wish I had more time to marinate this.  It was really good even though it marinated only 30 minutes.  I bet it would be phenomenal marinating longer!  Served with pasta, olive oil and garlic.  Very good!

Great Recipe! My friend made me this for my birthday dinner almost a year ago, and I finally just found the recipe for it! So naturally I had to make it right away! Although I didn't have Lemon Pepper or Parsley, I was able to add a few other things and it turned out great! I added a bit of allspice, some oregano(just a pinch) and I substituted ground thyme for dried thyme. My sister was begging me to make it again after the first bite! Definitely will make again!

I omit lemon pepper since I didn't have it on hand and I added fresh chopped garlic instead of powder.  The favor was good and my kids said it was the best fish dish I have ever made!

I love fish, particularly salmon.  I cannot count the
salmon recipes I have tried.  Just when I 
thought there was nothing new...  this. And it is 
tops.  Even my wife who is not big fish fan and 
certainly not a sweet food fan loved it.  I'll be 
cooking this on the stove this winter, but on the 
grill.... heaven on earth.
Do yourself a favor and try this.  And thank you HWaldron.

I too like dill, garlic & lemon on salmon, but this was a great change and my family loved it.  We did make two changes, though.  First, I used steelhead instead of salmon, which we actually like better (we get it at Costco for substantially cheaper than salmon). Second, I topped it with a salsa of pinapple, bell pepper, lemon juice, jalapeno pepper and cilantro (on allrecipes.com).  It complemented the fish perfectly !!

I mixed everything in a ziploc bag and let sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.  It turned out with good flavor but not the best I've ever had.

Okay, now I can throw away all my other soy sauce-type salmon recipes, this is THE ONE!  I was out of lemon pepper so I just used black pepper and some lemon juice.  I made the whole recipe for 3 fillets and set some marinade aside for basting. This recipe is truly delicious!

I'm new to grilling salmon and my friend told me I had to try this recipe.  We made it together for our families.  The touch of sweetness made this salmon a tasty treat.  It was so fabulous, no one had the will power to leave the leftovers for our teenagers who were at work.  We will HAVE to make a second batch!

Made this exactly by receipt, cooking it on the grill. It was absolutely delicious.  The family loved it.  The salmon was very tender, perfect texture.  This will be a family favorite for sure. I put sliced lemons on the grill, placing the salmon on top of the lemons. This gives a great flavor and keeps the salmon from sticking to the grill.

Delicious!  My family loved it!  Used the oven broiler, & smaller pieces; watched it closely as to not overlook (4 min./side). It's definitely a "go-to" recipe for me.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made some modifications due to diet... 1st I always use fresh garlic, 4 cloves diced, 1-2 tbsp of brown sugar and liquid aminos for soy sauce substitute (very low -sodium, compared to low- sodium soy sauce) I also use coconut oil blend instead of olive oil. I also cut the soy sauce, oil and water down to 1/4 cup. This recipe never fails to impress us! My 4 yr old loves it!

"..reheats nicely for lunches the next day!" Are you kidding me Heather? For reheating you need leftovers! We grilled a pound fillet so we'd have some to top salad the next day. We scarfed the whole pound. Thank you for an easy, fabulous marinade made with pantry staples. I'll be hard pressed to try other recipes now.

Impressive served to guests or a wonderful everyday meal. Be careful when broiling as it can burn quickly. I grilled it on High on the second highest level 5min each side as directed, but watch it closely. This will certainly be a family favorite. Delicious!

This was one AWESOME recipe for Salmon. I also tried it on a smoker with wild cherry wood and it was great. Took longer to cook, but extremely worth it. Many Thanks for placing this AWESOME recipe out here to share with the rest of us.

This is absolutely awesome.  I usually tinker a little with recipes, sometimes to suit my taste a little more and sometimes just so I feel like it's more my own, but I do not mess with this one at all.  The only variation was I squeezed a lemon wedge in the marinate and put regular ground pepper in because I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand.  I'm sure it made little if any difference, but I can't rave enough about this recipe.

I must admit...I am one to definitely fry the fish I make or cover it with some sauce and this is just about the only fish recipe where I can eat it without doing any of that.Thank you ! This recipe is perfect. Love the marinade!

Salmon is good just about any ole way, but this is very good.  Nice selection of ingredients in the marinade.  My husband loved it and he is not really a fish guy.

Made the full amount of marinate (except cut the oil in half) for two larger pieces of salmon.  I baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.  By far the best salmon recipe we've tried from this site.  The flavors really complement the salmon.  I marinated for about 1.5 hrs before cooking and while the oven warmed, I reduced the marinate by about half and then based the fish with it during baking.  Will definitely have again.

WOW. I am not going to lie, my boyfriend and I, while making the marinade, questioned this recipe mainly because of the smell. It didn't seem like it would be "flavorful". Boy where we wrong. This was the BEST salmon I have EVER had. We followed the recipe to a "T". We will be making this on a regular basis!

We've been making salmon for years with similar flavors, but it's nice to have a set recipe for this delicious flavor! It's a wonderful marinade and the perfect addition to the salmon's natural flavors. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Heather you know how to marinate some Salmon! Found this recipe to dress up my Salmon and the whole family just loves it! They now expect this dish as a regular meal. Easy healthy dinner. We serve it with some homemade mashed potatoes and asparagus... Yummy!

This was AMAZING. I only had the frozen cheap salmon and a Foreman grill. I marinated overnight and this was DELICIOUS, even as leftovers! I might try this on chicken too. Yum!

considering I am very cautious of salmon, because of it's notoriously strong flavor- this recipe ROCKS!! Did it just as written, and LOVED it! Thanks so much for helping me see that I can make fish at home that I'd actually enjoy eating!

This was the best. I didn't leave any of the herbs out like I usually do (picky husband) and it was great. Everyone liked it. I cooked mine on an indoor grill, 5 minutes each side. It was perfect. This one's going in my recipe favorites. I cooked the leftover marinade till it thickened and put it on the salmon.

Very good results.  I have made this several times.  I've followed the recipe exactly and once used italian seasoning blend because I was out of basil.  Turned out great both ways ! I have also found that I can cut back a little on the oil to decrease the fat without sacrificing a thing on this yummy marinade.  I'll definitely make this one again and again.

What a great little variation.  Would suggest maybe a little rice white to break up the sweetness.

Absolutely hands down the best salmon I've ever tasted. My friend was over for dinner and she said she didn't really like salmon very much. Well, let's just say she's changed her mind. Absolutely no changes necessary to this great recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is delicious! I ran out of the lemon pepper so I had to adjust - 1/2 tsp lemon pepper, 1 tsp lemon juice. Yum!

Great recipe! I'm not very skilled with grilling so I just put the salmon in the oven covered with foil for about 15mins. It was very delicious!

Heather, this is a fantastic marinade. We have to watch our sodium and cholesterol, but your editor's note was reassuring. Even though the fish marinades in a lot of stuff, many ingredients are minimized once the marinade shakes off and the fish is grilled. Use reduced sodium/lite soy sauce without compromising flavor. Thanks so much!

Excellent marinade.  The Salmon was delicious on the grill outside.  It's too hot to cook indoors.  Followed directions first time and it tasted wonderful.  Will definitely try again.

I followed this recipe except I decreased the brown sugar just slightly, as someone recommended. I also basted the sauce on as I grilled it.  It is the best salmon we have ever had.  Even my picky eater kids liked it.  It's a keeper for sure!

Best salmon recipe I've had in a very long time! I scaled it down to make 2 fillets and just used a tsp of dried Italian seasoning instead of the individual herbs and it worked beautifully. You can broil for 7-8mins instead of grill (makes it easy and a quick clean-up with tin foil) and squeeze lemon juice over when hot from the oven. It's a must try with Roasted Garlic Zucchini and Tomatoes along side, made the perfect light but hearty meal and I can't wait for lunch today to finish leftovers.

Excellent marinade.  Like a previous rewiewer, we are going to try this on chicken and shrimp.  We marinated it for 4 hours and it didn't affect the consistency of the salmon.

This was my first attempt at grilling Salmon for my husband's birthday party and it was a total success! Everyone loved it! (I don't eat fish) and my husband enjoyed the leftover for the next couple of days. I will make this recipe again. Also guests requested copies of this one.

Amazing. We had freshly caught salmon from Lake Michigan, with the skin still on one side. I grilled by placing the filet, skin-side down, on pieces of aluminum foil, and cooked on low for about 10 minutes, until the fish began to flake, while basting with leftover marinade. The marinade was absolutely amazing. Just a big sweet, but rich and tangy. Will definitely make again, and might try with chicken. One note, we didn't have lemon pepper, so replaced with lemon juice.

Great recipe.  I bought an expensive salmon fillet and when I opened it, it was reeking fishy so I came looking for a recipe to neutralize it.  This worked perfectly, it tasted like salmon but not fishy.  I didn't have time to marinate so I BBQed on a foil tray and dumped the marinade over top, then basted.  I will make it again!

This recipe was so amazing that we had grilled salmon every week this summer and never tired of it.  Works fine with 1/8 cup brown sugar splenda to reduce sugar content.

My husband and daughter loved this recipe!  They said it tasted like gourmet restaurant fish, which considering I'm not a great cook I took as a huge compliment.  I followed the ingredients exactly and baked it in the oven (it was raining too hard to BBQ) at 350 for 25 minutes.  20 minutes would have been a bit better since it was a touch overdone.  I will definitely make this again!

Let me begin by saying that I am not normally a fan of salmon but many people in my family love it. Made this for a special birthday dinner and everyone absolutely loved it! The perfect balance of sweet and salty. Only change I made was to sub fresh pressed garlic for the garlic powder. Like this so much made it again later in the week. Especially good with Coho salmon which is in season right now. A definite keeper recipe!

Made it. Not very good. Something missing. I really good salmon that needed nothing more than salt and pepper. I thought it would be delicious with something that sounded good. It was not good. May be it would be good for Carp or Atlantic Salmon. Not really good salmon.

I followed the directions exactly with the exception I used fresh parsley instead of dried and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Hubby was a bit skeptical (he's not really a big fish fan - especially Salmon), questioned why we were having this, but threw it on the grill anyway (he's good about things like that). Let me tell you - this is one of the best marinades I have ever used. I've had marinated Salmon before  & wasn't real impressed with the way it had been prepared. But  we were both blown away with the flavor and wish we had grilled more. You need to try this one - you certainly won't be disappointed!

This is Lisa's husband reviewing and rating. Made this with some fresh Coho Salmon I caught here on Lake Michigan. From line to grill! Doesn't get any better then that!
Modified the recipe a bit. Used raw honey instead of brown sugar and fresh minced garlic instead of powder. Doubled all ingredients except the soy sauce (used only 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup). Marinated for about 1.5 - 2 hrs. I also set aside a half cup of marinade before adding salmon fillets. Heated the extra marinade on the grill and we used it as an au jus. Salmon turned out fantastic. The honey caramelizes while picking up a great smoky flavor from the hardwood charcoal. Fantastic! So good I'm making it again tonight...the second night in a row!

The sauce tasted good when I made it.  However, when put on the salmon, it completely overwhelmed the taste of the salmon.

I have been using this recipe over two months now, at least twice a week; I do not bother to look for another one as this is such an easy recipe but absolutely delicious. I saw some of the reviewers said the salmon less flavor,  my opinion is you must marinate the fish and let it sit for at least a few hours (I usually marinate one night before). The marination will bring all the flavor to the fish - keep in mind when you marinate such long time you need to cut down the ingredients too. I marinate 1lb of fish but using ingredients in  this recipe under '4 serving', I also cut down the sugar to half potion. My husband loves it. This is my lifetime recipe, so Thank you very much!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Marinated fresh Coho salmon for about 8 hours and then grilled on a cedar plank.  It was wonderful.  We've made this a few times for guests and they always rave about it.  We also throw shrimp into the marinade for about an hour or two and grill that too.  It's great!

Heather's Grilled Salmon Haiku: "Kudos to Heather! I used this on trout fillets, instead of salmon." This was unbelievably good fish. I used it on a large steelhead trout from Costco that I'd cut into fillets and frozen (cheaper than salmon and just as good when marinated and grilled.) This was a smidge on the sweet side, but no complaints otherwise.

I made this exactly as written, marinating it for at least two hours. My fillets were all a consistent small 6oz size and relatively thin. It took exactly 5 minutes on each side at medium grill heat. Grilled flesh side down first then flipped over to finish on the skin side, brushing on extra marinade. There was a nice crisp caramelized coating when I was done.The next day I reheated the leftovers with stir-fry veggies and rice and a splash more of soy sauce and it was just as good.

We loved this.  I replaced a little more than half of the oil with fresh squeezed orange juice for a lighter version.  The flavor of this was fantastic!

This had great flavor.  I used 2 filets and halved the ingredients, used only 1 tsp of brown sugar, used 6 real garlic cloves minced instead of powered.  I didn't have lemon pepper so used grated lemon peel with a little of the juice and black pepper separately.  Had grilled asparagus and Seeds of Change quinoa and brown rice or I've used Costco's quinoa and kale in the frozen case.  I also added hot peppers to the marinade mixture.

I have a very picky husband and he loved it! I cooked it more like 6-7 min per side because he likes all his food well done. Will definitely make this again. I added a sprinkle of ginger and pepper as well as a few drops of fresh lemon per side and served it with lemon wedges over a bed a fresh spinach. Very flavorful and healthy!

I've made this several times and it's delicious.  I didn't like salmon until I tried this recipe. Childhood memories of fried patties made with salmon out of the can made me avoid salmon for most of my life.  Try this!

This was THE BEST marinade I've EVER used!!!  Incredible outcome!  My family & I all go to Alaska to fish for salmon every other year, so I have alot of wild salmon to cook.  I've used many different recipes, but this one IS THE ONE!  It is easy, delicious and WOW, my family all raved over this one!  This is a keeper!  Try it!  Thank you Heather for a truly DELICIOUS recipe!

Wonderful recipe Heather. Loved it. Being Canadian, I tweeked it a little bit by using maple syrup instead of brown sugar. I used lime juice instead of lemon pepper and when I grilled it, I presoaked an untreated cedar plank and then set it on the grill with the salmon on top of it. It produces a wonderful smokey flavour thoughout the fish. Thanks for the lovely marinade.

Oh delicious! I made this last night because I had all the ingredients in my cupboard, with the exception of thyme. I used Italian Seasoning instead (because it has thyme in it). This turned out fantastic. Squeeze a little lemon on top of the salmon before you eat it - yum. I baked this at 400 for 15 minutes. I will definitely be making this again - on the grill in the summer. Thanks!!

Based on all the positive reviews, I thought it would be really, really good.    I liked it but was disappointed.  My family was neutral on it.   I marinated the salmon for about 6 hours, and grilled it.   I cooked up some of the remaining marinade to use as a sauce on the table.  The sauce had good flavor so  I might try the marinade again, but next time on chicken.

Perfect, a family favorite! I've been making this for 5 years now,  none of us can even order salmon at a restaurant because it's always a letdown after this.  I also bake it in the oven, when doing so I bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes depending on the thickness and I bake it in the marinade it comes out so tender! Sometimes I use hoisin sauce instead of the soy/olive oil combo.

I love grilled salmon so I decided to try this. All I can say is WOW!!! This is probably the best salmon I've ever had! Bar none. And I've eaten some pretty good salmon, in some nice restaurants. But this is so much better. This will make my regular rotation.

I don't think I will ever make salmon any other way now that I have found this marinade!  So many marinades are either bland, or so strong that you can't taste the salmon.  This one is just perfect, and made with ingredients that most will already have on hand.  Thank you!

Amazing! This is now my go to recipe for salmon! My husband keeps asking me to make it again. It pairs really well with Bird's Nests from Trader Joe's and sone fresh asparagus :-) 
We don't have a grill so we just bake@400 for about 10 minutes

OMG! I absolutely loved this recipe for salmon. I minimized it for one about 10 oz salmon, split into 2 servings and only used half of the soy sauce, but it was still very, VERY good. Still get the salmon flavour but nothing is overpowering. And that's saying a lot, cause I'm not the biggest salmon fan. But I would definitely recommend this to anyone!

I just fixed this tonight with some grilled asparagus and French bread. Didn't touch the bread, I filled up on the salmon and asparagus. I wasn't going to add the brn sugar because I don't care for sweets, but I'm darn glad I did. This is the best salmon I've ever fixed. Thanks Heather, good job!

I'm not exactly an expert chef especially when it comes to fish, but I did live in Seattle for 5 years and this is easily as good as any salmon I had there, including at restaurants. Probably the best fish I've ever tried.

I can't believe it, this recipe was so awesome, my whole family loved it, and they are not all fish eaters, let alone salmon eaters!! I followed the recipe and directions as stated except that I baked my salmon rather than grilling it,, worked great for us!

I liked this salmon because it didn't taste too "fishy."  My husband (the real fish person) thought it was a little too sweet.  I will certainly make this recipe again, but I think I'll cut back on the brown sugar and maybe add a clove or 2 of crushed garlic.

AMAZING!! I grilled these on cedar planks and it was incredible. Followed recipe with one exception - I didn't have lemon pepper, so I squeezed some fresh lemon and sprinkled black pepper into the marinade. Simple and so good. Will definitely keep this in rotation!

This was a fantastic recipe, I was looking for a new marinade for Salmon. I followed the recipe exactly, I also doubled the recipe, I marinated the salmon in 1/2 of the marinade i made for about 2 hours and then while I was grilling the salmon I kept brushing the salmon with the other half of the marinade.. Great Flavor!

Out of this world delicious! I did not have the lemon pepper but used a tbsp of lemon juice instead. I marinated for 2 hours and cooked on cedar planks on the gril. I boiled the marinade to make a sauce. Excellent!

This was amazing! My husband and I both loved it. It was simple to make on a Thursday evening. I let it marinade for about 2.5 hours before grilling and we grilled the salmon to a medium doneness. Yum! I will be making this again within the next week.

What can I say?  Everytime I make this it's gets better and better.  My husband absolutely adores the sauce. Note** if you baste the salmon in the left over sauce twice while on the grill it's amps the flavor**.  This is the only way I will eat salmon now! - Nicole

It was a little sweet to start with, but by the end I had become accustomed to it and actually began to enjoy it more with each bite.

Delicious.  I marinated the salmon for about 2 hours and cooked it in a grill pan about 4 minutes each side.  My husband and I love seafood, but he has never been particularly fond of salmon until I made this recipe.

Used this recipe with some wild alaskan salmon...DELICIOUS! Just the perfect amount of flavor. Some marinades over power the flavor of the fish. This was excellent. Definitely a keeper!

This was absoluetly delicious...  It was resutrant quality in my book.  I am sure if I let it sit and marinade for a few hours it would be even better.  It was great just soaking it in the ingredients for 10 minutes and broiling it.  So good!

Used this marinade with a little added dill and lemon zest.  Then plank grilled it. According to my son (whose favorite dinner is salmon) this was "The best salmon ever!"

This was fantastic and I don't like salmon. At least I thought I did not. Followed recipe exactly.  Used marinade on salmon and halibut because I was afraid I wouldn't like the salmon. The salmon held the flavor better than the halibut.  Cannot wait to make it again.

It was fabulous.  Loved the amount of color it added to the fish and just the right amount of herbs.
I baked/broiled it and it was perfect.
Great recipe, thanks!

i loved this ! i baked this in my oven for 20 minutes instead of a grill, and it came out very delicious and moist. I've made this dish countless times and its always a great meal, usually made with brown rice and asparagus for me :)

I have made this for years but what I do with the leftovers is: For my husband who can eat anything ,I take the cold salmon ,add mayo and relish for a great salmon salad sandwich or for myself who is always dieting I add some vinigar chopped onions salt and pepper all to taste for a great  sandwich for myself.
Try it you'll enjoy it either way.

I've been using this salmon recipe for a while now and it's a big hit in my family. I marinade overnight, wrap the fillets in foil and bake at 350. The time varies. It's delicious!

Delicious!  I decreased the brown sugar to 3 tablespoons.  And, i baked it at 400 degrees.  My 2-1/3 pound fillet took about 25 minutes to bake.

I use the marinade on everything.  My fav is actually  on bone in chicken thighs with carrots , mushrooms, onions, and whatever you want to add and cook in slow cooker.  It cooks in less than 2 hours.  I brown chicken, and double sauce.  Serve over rice.

Absolutely fantastic! The brown sugar caramelizes nicely on the grill which truly elevates this Salmon to yummy status.

I followed the directions, with two exceptions. I used fresh, chopped basil and marinated in a Tupperware for about 4 hours. It was wonderful. It's on my top list of salmon marinades.

I would give this a five except I cooked it in a grill pan on the stove rather than the outdoor grill. Other than that it was very tasty and moist. I highly recommend it.

This was absolutely AWESOME! I added a teaspoon of ground ginger to give it a bit of a "tang". I also broiled on high for 10 minutes. Tender, sweet (but not too sweet), tingle of ginger...this was great. I'm doing this every time!

This recipe was sooo good.  I over cooked the salmon a bit so it was blackened.  My family thought that made it even better.  Thanks for sharing it.

Delicious! Grilling outdoors adds a wonderful smokey flavor! Big hit with the fish lovers in our family including our two year old.
We have a few people watching their sugar intake, so I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  Based on other reviews added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, reduced soy sauce by 1 tablespoon.

Super easy and really good. I made the marinade as per directions and marinaded the salmon for about 3 hours. I couldn't use the outdoor grill because of bad weather so I grilled it in the oven and it came out great.

Hands down best salmon recipe I have. Great flavor, easy to marinade. I baked mine after marinating and the flavor was out of this world. I highly recommend.

It looked like it would be delicious and we marinated it for at least four hours, but for some reason it tasted very bland - it did not seem to absorb the flavours from the marinade.  The idea of reserving some of the marinade and pouring  it on afterwards , which someone mentioned here, would seem to be a good one, but I probably won’t try it again.

This was amazingly delicious. Instead of fresh skin-on salmon, I've used Aldi's skin-off salmon. Like in the magazine, I baked it in the oven since I have no grill. It tasted amazing with the marinade on the fish.  I would make it again for sure.

Great recipe.  I have made the recipe several times but with some modifications.  My wife and I have found that we enjoy salmon when the skin has been removed which reduces the oily flavor of the cooked salmon.  We like the ingredient list as stated in the recipe by Heather.  We have found that if we bake the fish at 350F for 30-40 minutes uncovered, and not grill the fillet, the brown sugar does not burn and turn bitter.  I also baste the fish once during cooking with the remaining marinade which increases the flavor of the recipe. Definitely a keeper receipt that I will try with other fish since I enjoy saltwater fishing!

I'm always short on time and shorter on planning, so marinading is not my thing.  Made this sauce and held back about 1/3 of the marinade.  I let the salmon sit in the marinade for maybe 10-15 minutes and then grilled it.  After flipping the salmon, I poured the portion that was unused over the top and completed grilling.  Was incredibly flavorful and delicious!  If you are in a rush & no time to marinade for hours, this is a great recipe!  Will definitely make again.

I had bought some fresh grouper and wanted something extra to add to it before I placed it on the grill.  I used this sauce and the flavor was amazing.  The only change I made was using Splenda brown sugar, my husband  has to watch his blood sugar.  It came out so flavorful.  I did what another review suggested and kept some of the marinade and heated it to use as an additional sauce after the fish was grilled. AMAZING, I will use this recipe again

We really enjoyed this.  Made it almost as written, but did add an extra swig of soy sauce.  Marinated for about 3 hours, but next time I'll go even longer.  Is a definite repeater!

I used this recipe both for salmon and my wife's cod fillets  . It was a hit! I halved the recipe for both fish types since  we had less fish and I added slightly more brown sugar (than the 1/2) to the cod since my wife prefers hers sweet. I always add more garlic than any recipe calls for. I will definitely use it again!

This was excellent!  I chose this recipe while we were RVing and I had all the ingredients except Thyme.  It was exceptionally easy and lent a mellow sweetness to the salmon which is saying a lot since I'm not a big fan of salmon. My husband is already asking me to make it again.

I have been making this for years, and finally got the time to write a review.  I LOVE this recipe for salmon.  I have made it for guests as well as just for me and my husband, and I always get rave reviews.  I rarely venture out to another recipe for salmon and when I do, I always come back to this one.  It is fantastic and very easy to make!

I have made this multiple times and have always been given rave reviews. Everyone likes it! Hint: use a grill mat and it will come out perfect every time.

My husband has made this many times already, and we plan on making it many times in the future.  It is delicious!  We don't have a grill so we use our NuWave oven.  We marinate the salmon for an hour using this delicious recipe, and then we cook the salmon in the oven.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is delish, I cut everything in half since 2 6oz filets.  Next time I am going to marinate longer so it will penetrate further.  AWESOME, thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Always looking for salmon recipies, we love it.  Served with rice pilaf from this site and steamed broccoli.

Easy marinade with common ingredients. Marinated for about 30 minutes then set skin side down on sliced onions, wrapped in foil and cooked on the grill. Came out perfectly. My salmon-crazy family said this was the best they’d ever had and they wanted this for Christmas Eve dinner. Made salmon croquette sliders with the leftovers the following day and those were also fabulous. This marinade will go into regular rotation at my house.

This is my favorite salmon recipe ever! I did not have lemon pepper, so I just used a little pepper by itself. Broiled instead of grilled. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

10 stars, minimum!  This is our new favorite salmon recipe.  Fearing it might be a little too strong, I did add two TBSP water to the marinade.  I poured the marinade in a large ziploc bag, added the fish and marinated only for a couple of hours...that was sufficient.  Thanks so much, Heather!

Great recipe for a quick marinated salmon!  It had just the right amount of  savory and sweet flavors.   I broiled the salmon instead of grilling because it was too hot outside, but, broiling perfectly carmelized the top of the salmon.

I made the marinade as described but did not have parsley. It didn't seem to miss it but next time I'll make sure I do. Using a baking dish, I sprinkled a little sea salt on the salmon before adding the marinade and then a few sprinkles of Old Bay blackened seasoning just for good measure. Placed the salmon in the refrigerator for only a hour and flipped it a few times while spooning the good stuff on top. Next time I'll plan ahead and make sure it sits a little longer. While my husband put them on the grill, I look the leftover marinade and heated it on the stove. We used lightly oiled foil to make for easy clean up. Five minutes, flipped and continued cooking another six. It was amazing and not only will this be a staple in our home but I think it's going to be a great meal for company. Thanks again, Allrecipes saved the day once again!

My first time making this turned out great!  I  was looking for a quick tasty recipe for a second half of a salmon that I had in the frig. I didn't have lemon pepper so I simply squeezed lemon juice and used black pepper. I also broiled rather than grilled and it still was ready timely. Was delicious! My husband loved it. and wants more. Just bought lemon-pepper spice so I will use it next time. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Looking for something different, came across this one, read the reviews, all 5 stars, just had to do it. My only change was , I did add about a pinky finger size of shaved ginger and about 2 Tsp fresh lemon juice. 8 hrs marinating. This is something to rave about.  Hsb grilled on top of stove (our out side grill died just yesterday) . Served with brown rice & broccoli with reserve marinade drizzled on top(cooked down a little on top of stove, sprinkle of wondra, can use little flour or corn starch.)  My every mouth full was with a Yumm. Great Valentine Dinner.  It's a keeper. Now I must remember to save on this site..Thank You.

This was fabulous!  Had enough left over to use in a Caesar salad the next day.  I used Splenda brown sugar because we have diabetics in the family.  I also didn't use the BBQ, but used a grill fry pan and it came out with a nice blackened crust.  Would definitely do again.

This is a delicious and easy way to cook salmon! We followed the recipe exactly except for the garlic powder, which we doubled. We did not grill it, but instead cooked it in a 400F oven on a cookie sheet with a little oil spray on it. About 10 minutes per inch of thickness of the filets was perfect. Very good with a side of roasted cauliflower and a Caesar salad.

I used the marinade on chicken, used a couple of garlic cloves rather than the powder, and marinated for about 5 hours. Yum! My hubby told me how great the chicken tasted, which he only does if he really likes it (usually I have to ask him how dinner was) so this gets two thumbs up.

I made this for a fundraising dinner party.  I was looking for an easy recipe and this was it!  I made it per directions with the only minor change being I used 1/2 regular soy sauce and 1/2 reduced sodium soy.  I grilled it inside in my oven under the broiler (on top of aluminum foil for easy clean up) 3-4 minutes per side depending on the individual thickness of the salmon pieces.  It received rave reviews from 12 guests.  Thanks for posting it.

I used basil olive oil for the oil, and Ponzi Lime sauce for the soy sauce. My wife and I thought it was the best salmon we ever had. She was surprised that it was grilled instead of baked. Used the extra marinade to coat asparagus before grilling them also. Excellent!

I made it according to the recipe.  The leftover salmon was great chopped up, mixed with celery and mayo.

My Go to salmon recipe. I made it as written first, it was excellent. After that, I started backing up on the amount of soy sauce so it'd be less salty, down to 2 Tbs and that was perfect for my taste. Usually need to be marinated for only about 30 minutes to get full flavor, so great recipe for summer dinner after work - easy and fast.

Ingredients as directed on a Costco salmon filet for sister visit. Didn't marinate it just dropped it in a ziploc while the grill heated. Turned out great!

I've made this twice now. The marinade is REALLY good! The first time I used fresh salmon from the seafood counter. SO tasty! I cooked in my skillet in the kitchen. The second time I bought a bag of frozen salmon. I defrosted the salmon a bit before throwing in the marinade. Still really good! (Of course fresh fish is better but the marinade helped the frozen fish a lot!) Will make again!

OMG! This was so good! I didn't have thyme for the recipe but next time I will. The only thing I added extra was a little fresh-squeezed lemon juice before grilling. The outside was perfect! Not too sweet yet not at all bitter or sour. A little bit of a crunch and perfect on the inside as well..not overly moist but perfectly even! Thank you for a perfect taste sensation! The very BEST salmon recipe I have had!

This is hands down the very best salmon recipe you will ever have!  To add even more flavor, cook it in a water soaked cedar plank on your grill.  I've made this recipe a dozen times and everyone raves about it!

This recipe is great. My wife and I make it a couple of times a week. I make a whole jar of the marinade  and that way we can just pour a little bit out for two fillets. I cook mine in a cast iron grill pan and it makes great seared marks and flavor. About 4 minutes for the first side and 3 minutes for the second side. Microwave the leftover used marinade  with a tablespoon of water and stir for a sauce to go on the fish and rice. We joke and call it "fish bacon", it's that good!

I have made this more times than I can count the family Loves this recipe. I never use the lemon pepper because I'm not a fan of lemon pepper. The only other thing I do is double everything else I marinade the Salome with about  1/3 of marinade the rest I reduce and add to finished Salmon. This marinade is also great on grilled chicken.

Absolutely a five star recipe! Our family loved this! My ten year old told me to write "my kids loved it!" I added all the ingredients from the original recipe, marinated it for two hours, then put it in the oven on convection for about 7 minutes each side. Fabulous recipe! Thank you for sharing!!

I am currently pregnant and food I really enjoy is hard to come by these days. This is the first dish I have had since I found out I am pregnant that I ABSOLUTELY loved!!! Trust me the standards are pretty high these days. I have been told to eat more fish as I am vegetarian but it has been hard with changes in my appetite. I LOVED LOVED LOVED this. I cleaned every morsel off my plate.  I made a few changes: substituted the brown sugar for honey, didn't have thyme so made the marinade without and added a few drops of lemon. I also broiled the salmon in the oven, wrapped in foil with the marinade. I then opened the foil and let it bake for 2 minutes. It dried it out a slight bit as I tried one batch with only the broil method and the other batch with broil and bake for 2 minutes. It came out juicy, flavourful and a nice darker colour because of the soy sauce and being cooked with the marinade. I served it with plain rice, and a table spoon of marinade over the rice with salmon and roasted broccoli.

The salmon was moist and very good.  I didn't have parsley, so I used dried cilantro.  I marinated the salmon for about 20 minutes in the refrigerator and then broiled it for 5 minutes on each side.

This was definitely a Salmon winner for me! I made some very slight changes- I used Whole Foods Lemon Herb marinade (2 tsp) instead of the Lemon Pepper and added 1tsp of cayenne pepper to kick it up. The Cayenne pepper really cuts the sweetness of the brown sugar so you get the zip without the heat. I served it with a yummy Jasmine rice (in my rice cooker). I added diced apricots, green onions and toasted almonds to the rice. This was a big hit of a meal!

A great addition to Salmon. This is a quick marinade and can be ready in 30 minutes. My 17 year old request this recipe more than any other. I make it as written and have made it at least 10 times, although on a griddle in the house. I have never grilled it but I am sure it's just as good.

Always looking for new ways to marinate salmon.  Husband and son loved it.  Used fresh herbs instead of dried.  Googled how much fresh = dried (love Google).  If recipe calls for 1 Tbl. dried, use 3 Tbl. fresh.  Quick and easy.

My entire family (husband and 3 boys) LOVED this salmon!  Even, my pickiest eater said it was wonderful!  I made it just as the recipe stated and marinated a whole salmon overnight.  Then we cooked it on the grill.  There is nothing left of it because it was so good.  Will definitely make this again and again!

OMGOSH! Did the marinade exactly as stated. Superb recipe. I put it on aluminum foil skin side down & then flipped it when time & the skin came right off. I forgot to oil the grate before I flipped it so it did stick a little. Thanx for the recipe & the foil tip.

This is a great recipe for those who are not salmon lovers.  I followed it exactly and thought that the marinade overpowered the salmon.  Both my husband and I love fish and good salmon.  I'm rating this 4 stars however because I think that it's a great way to encourage people to try fish.  I am going to try the marinade on chicken.

this marinade was awesome!  I do not usually care for salmon that much because it is not considered a mild fish compared to something like cod.  I did not have any thyme so substituted thyme with herbes de Provence.  I did double the recipe for about 5 pounds of salmon. When Bbqing put skin side down. It will start to flake a little then I turned the fish over and just seared in the juices and made beautiful grill marks. Be careful not to over cook. When your fork cuts into the fish you should see layers.  Had lots of flavor and recommend only Bbqing the fish because you also get the taste of the BBQ. Very good!  Husband can't wait to buy more salmon to use this marinade again!

Loved it!  I didn't marinate it for an hour and I didn't grill it. I used the broiler in the oven. It was delicious! Next time I will marinate it and I bet it it will be even better. Sharing with lots of friends

This  recapture is awesome ! I have made it and shared it many times. I have turned people who didn't like salmon into salmon lovers! I make it on wood planks on the grill.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe!  For my family I had to back down the brown sugar and because we like it increased the basil.

I've made this twice exactly as written for the marinade. I've had to increase the grill time to 7 minutes per side, and it's perfect. I crave this dish. Best salmon recipe ever...my family agrees.

I used my indoor electric grill, so both sides cooked at once in 5-6 minutes. That marinade is going on some pork chops next time!

I tried this recipe last night.  It was so easy and my husband and I just loved it.  Absolutely delicious.  I used my grill pan on my stove top to cook.  I was in a rush and only marinated 1/2 hour but the result was still very flavorful.  My husband is the salmon lover.  Me not so much.  But this I will make over and over.  I did the salmon on high heat 4 minutes one side and after flipping, less on the other side.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I used plain pepper and some lemon juice.  The salmon was moist.  This is good enough for company for sure.  Try it and enjoy it!

I reduced the recipe by half b-cuz I only had 3/4 lb of salmon.  I added 1T of asian vinegar to the marinade and marinated for 4 hours(needed to leave the house and that's when I returned)/  Also, I decided not to use the grill and baked in a preheated 425 degree oven for 8 min.   Let sit a few while I put the other food on plates.  I make salmon all the time but this easy recipe was the best.  Definetely the best marinade ever!!

The BEST salmon I ever made.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I had a large 2 lb piece of salmon and baked it covered at 425 for 20 minutes then uncovered and broiled for 5 minutes, this is my new favorite salmon recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. The only thing I changed is that I added a little lemon juice and a little pepper because I didn't have lemon pepper. Also used one clove of fresh garlic and the rest dried. I'm on a fresh garlic kick:) The marinade is delicious. I boiled it on the stove while the salmon was grilling so we could put it over the cooked fish. Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! We baked fillets in shallow dish at 400 degrees for 10-12 min. We followed another reviewer's advise and boiled the marinade to serve over the salmon and rice and it was also good but did get a little too thick. Next time I will thin down with a little more lemon juice.

I halved the recipe because I was only cooking 3 pieces of salmon. It was plenty of marinade. I also used a lemon rosemary seasoning in place of the lemon pepper because I didn't have it. It was delicious on the grill!

This is a superb recipe.  I marinated the salmon fillets for about 4 hours.  Unfortunately, we had a thunderstorm at dinnertime so I was not able to grill the salmon.  As another reviewer suggested, I baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes.  I poured on all of the reserved marinade before baking.  It was tasty and delicious and there was a  nice glaze.  My husband and I loved it!    Next time we'll try grilling it if weather permits.

We loved this - definitely oil the grate before you flip as well.  Cooked flesh side down to start, then skin side down.  5 min/side was perfect.

I love this easy to make recipe.  I used a grill pan indoors and the marinade seemed to add a sweet, smokey flavor.  Yum.  

I had some frozen tilapia on hand and used this recipe.  It was just as good as the salmon.  I'm not  a freqent fish eater but this has taken seafood to a new level.

My family loves this marinade. It doesn't overpower the taste of the salmon. I can mix it up after work, marinate it for about an hour and then cook it on the grill. I use a solid grill top and set the timer to flip at 5 minutes. It's makes a fast, delicious dinner served with rice and a Caesar salad.

Fantastic recipe! We like garlic, so I added almost twice as much garlic powder. We love salmon in general and look for good salmon marinades all the time. This is now one of our favorites.

I have tried many salmon recipes and this one seems to be my family's favorite.  It was delicious.  The only thing I did different was to add a teaspoon of minced garlic to the marinade, otherwise everything else was the same.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I cut the soy sauce down to 2 Tbs, next time will try 1 1/2 tbs just to tweak it to taste. Great for salmon, grilled or broiled, and it tasted great the 2nd day when served cold in a salad. Thanks for posting it.

Marinated for a little less than 2 hours. The flavor is amazing. One of the best pieces of Salmon I have ever tasted. Definitely in the recipe book.

Loved it! Added 1 TBS of butter and brushed on the marinade on both sides.  Covered with foil and after an hour baked at 375 for 20 minutes, uncovered and broiled for 5 minutes.  Perfect, best Salmon I have had anywhere.

I made this recipe for a friendly BBQ and it was a big hit. I made it just as directed except I let it marinate for approx. 4 hours....  It has an excellent flavor.  I do not care for salmon and I actually ate some of it, which is saying a lot.  Others have asked for the recipe. The caramel glaze finish that you end up with is outstanding.

I followed most of the recipe, but my grill was out of gas so I followed one reviewer's advice and foiled the salmon before baking in my toaster oven @400F for about 25 minutes. Salmon turned out perfect in texture and taste! I only marinated for about 4 hours but I'm sure I could've marinated for a shorter time. I served with sautéed asparagus (in garlic, butter and onions) over quinoa/brown rice blend. Gonna make this again!

Whoa...this is a fantastic recipe!  The first time I made it, I broiled it in the oven. I just made it for the second time and I did it on the grill as directed.  Excellent both times!  A keeper, for sure!

Excellent flavour and easy to make. I added extra chili flakes because we like the heat. I also baked mine in a glass dish uncovered for 20 minutes and marinated overnight. 

Very nice marinade.

Loved it!  Doctor said eat more salmon, so I have been, but usually at a restaurant.  Watching my sugar intake, so I used  Brown Sugar Substitute.  I chose to broil the salmon (5 minutes per side). This recipe was delicious and easy and much less expensive than a restaurant.  This is my new favorite recipe.

Yummy! Since I'm a novice with Salmon, I baked this. Lined an 8 X 8 glass pan with foil, poured 1/2 the marinade over the salmon and baked for 16 to 18 minutes. Oven was set for 400. I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon to this.

Followed this recipe to the Tee and it was fantastic. Use to only eat salmon at the restaurants because I wasn't confident enough to try and fix it myself, but no more. This better than any I've ever got from a restaurant. Thanks

My husband loved this recipe and he is not a fish eater. I modified the recipe for myself however, by leaving out the sugar and olive oil. I added a tbsp of water and it was more of a paste. I slathered on top of my filet and grilled it! Yummy!

This was refreshing and delicious!  My husband loved it!  I think it needed to marinate for longer than an hour to really soak through if you have thick pieces of salmon though.  Also, next time I try it I am planning on keeping the glaze and adding it over the salmon as it grills as another person mentioned!

This recipe was way too easy. The marinade was easy to make. We left it in the marinade for close to 4 hours. The salmon was tender and tasted amazing! This will definitely be a recipe used over and over again in our kitchen!!

I made this the other night and I gotta say, it was very good. I am trying to eat healthier, who isn't, but I don't like fish so I was nervous but it was really very good. My husband likes all kinds of fish but hasn't had much because I don't know how to cook it right but with this recipe it was perfect! He said this was the best he has ever had! I made it in the electric skillet instead of the grill but that is all I changed. This is for sure my recipe for salmon!

Absolutely the best salmon recipe I have ever tried! Even my 12-year old son eats this! The only modification I made to this recipe was to use a lower sodium soy sauce.

WOW! This was amazing! I let it marinate for around 3 hours and the flavor was just absolutely wonderful. Best grilled salmon dish I have ever made. Make it and you won't be sorry!!

Should be given 10 stars. So good! I cooked the salmon on a cedar plank for 20 minutes on the grill. My husband loved the recipe. I will make again. I also heated the marinade and we used it on the finished product. I marinaded the salmon for 5 hours in the fridge.

This is the BEST salmon I have ever tasted! 

I marinated for about 4 hours, then used our outdoor grill to make it. Make sure to spray the grill with non-stick cooking spray, then place the salmon skin side UP. After a couple minutes, you can flip the fish over, scales onto the grill, and add more sauce. I added a touch of honey to sweeten the fish and it browned perfectly. Will definitely be making this again!

YUM!! from a picky cook.  Very delicious. I was concerned about so much sugar, so I used about half the amount; I didn't have any soy sauce, so I used Bragg's Amino Liquids, a healthy soy alternative, and I had no parsley, so I decided to throw in a healthy sprinkle of powdered ginger.  deeelishous!

Fabulous recipe. Instead of the individual herbs, I just use Italian seasoning. Just a little easier.

This marinade was awesome. Tiny bit sweet and a tiny bit peppery.  We did not have lemon peppper so I used black pepper (1/4 tsp) and it was still great.

We have been eating salmon once a week for many years, and I was looking for a new way to prepare it.  Since finding this recipe, we don't prepare it any other way!  This is the best salmon marinade!  I add a few ounces of Oxygen Southeast Marinade (spicy) and it becomes six stars! Enjoy!

Delicious!  Only thing different was I used a non stick grill basket on the grill to hold the salmon in place and it did not stick to the grill. Tasty as hell and everyone raved about it. Using fresh salmon made a difference also.

A great marinade for salmon. Works under the broiler as well, just cut the time very slightly (4 minutes per side).
