I made this last night for a REALLY picky eater. so I cut out the currants & raisins & used only apples. I had no olive oil, so I cooked the apples in leftover bacon drippings & used a mixture of apple juice and sherry instead of marsala and cider. Instead of cooking spray, I used regular vegetable oil & used ground rosemary instead of leaves (had none!). 

This was the first time I've cooked for someone in about 3 years, and it was absolutely scrumptious. I added lemon pepper butter to cteamed broccoli & parsley butter to boiled whole mini red skinned potatoes. The picky eater wanted seconds of everything, but there was only 1 chop & some sauce leftover which he wanted to save for lunch. I was looking for a really simple recipe with apples & pork chops - and this was it! It was easy to make the changes I did, the flavoring is so uncomplicated that it's perfect for my taste. There were no kids eating, but I know kids who are way less picky than my friend, so I'd guess they'd love it too. Thank you for giving me the means to make a great impression. Next time he'll be a lot more likely to try something different again because it turned out so well the first time.

I really thought this recipe was great, with excellent flavor!  I used thinner, sliced sirloin pork chops that cooked quickly, dried cherries instead of the currents, and the apple cider I had in the fridge.  I suggest using more rosemary (for stronger flavor) and more cider to maintain the liquidity of the sauce once it begins to reduce for the second time.

I don't eat much pork, but I wanted to try something different.  It sounded good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting.

This was great!  The only one who balked at it was my 5 yr old, and she doesn't like anything. I used apple juice instead of cider or marsala (I didn't have any),but that was the only thing I altered.

The rosmarin is not enough, you need more for this amount of meat. just see how much you need and how spicy you want the meat.
Tried it without the currants and its great.

Didn't think this was that good.  It needed WAY more sauce, and the cooking time was off.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

WOW!!  Made this for my picky husband who turns up his nose at pork chops, but not this time.  Used thick bone-in chops and this was delicious!!  Other than peeling the apple, very easy to make.

Wow! What a great recipe. I had to substitute the currants and raisins with chopped prunes and craisins, and I used port instead of Marsala, tarragon instead of rosemary. Wonderful. Flavorful. A keeper. Served w/ stuffing and a simple salad.

Super!  My husband loves it, and so did our company when I served it.  I don't use the rosemary, though; we found it to be way too overwhelming.  The apple/raisin mixture rocks!

I didn't have currants so I substituted dried cranberries.  I also didn't have Marsala wine, so I substituted a dry red wine.  It still turned out great!  My husband's comment after his first bite was: "Mmmmmmm, yeah!"  This is one I will be making again for sure!

Sorry, but thought this recipe was just so-so.  Maybe I did something wrong in cooking it or was just expecting too much. Probably wont make it again.

I will make this recipe again & again.  I didn't have currents but added dried cranberries instead.
I also didn't have the correct wine so I used red cooking wine.  I am sure it will be much better next time when I use the correct wine.

This was a good recipe and my family seemed to like it.  There were no ohhs and ahhhs, but it was nice.  Will I make it again?  Maybe, maybe not.  My family could go either way on that one.
