These biscuits were excellent - soft and tender, inside just as the name implies.  The recipe made 10 good sized biscuits

Pretty good biscuits! The recipe definitely needs an additional 1/4 cup of flour, plus maybe a little more. I ended up with 10 good sized tender and moist biscuits. They're a tiny bit more on the dense side than light and airy.  They're also slightly sweet. I would imagine if you cut the sugar down a tad and added some shredded cheddar and garlic salt, they would make good potato cheese biscuits- I'll have to try it next time.

These were the lightest fluffiest biscuits I have ever baked-- and I've been baking for about 40 years!  I did not use the water-- just added enough milk to make a firm biscuit dough.  I am guessing some of the difference in texture and height is due to the various amounts of butter and/or milk in the leftover potatoes.  Additionally, the type of potato may account for different results, as some are more starchy than others.  My family and I are sold on these biscuits.  They were also delicious  warmed over the next morning for sausage and egg sandwiches.  10 stars for this recipe!

My family LOVED these biscuits.  I didn't add the water it called for, as the milk made the dough moist enough.  I also put in less sugar.  I didn't want to take the time to roll out the dough, so I floured my hands, rolled in  quick balls, flattened, and they turned out just wonderful.  My mashed potatoes from Sunday had the skins on and that didn't seem to change the biscuits in any way.  This is a recipe I will keep and Pass on!  I have 3 kids ranging in age from 5 to 11 and they all loved them.

Super awesome.

I didn't add any extra sugar, I used buttermilk, and I made these into drop
biscuits in my muffin tin. Great recipe.
I'd like to add some spices the next time I make this, like rosemary and garlic.

This recipe made twelve really large biscuits.

I have to give these five stars. I mixed mine in the mixer so I didnâ€™t have a problem with too much liquid. I only added till the dough was right. Mine came out light and soft with a good taste. You could add less sugar or no sugar. One other thing I did was use potato flakes, which gave them a slight potato taste without adding moisture.
Overall a very good recipe. This one is my new favorite biscuit recipe.
Definitely a keeper.
Thanks

These were delicious! I made the recipe as directed, but doubled it. I thought "8 servings" would mean 8 biscuits, but I ended up with  24! Not complaining at all (and neither are my kids). One thing to note with this recipe (and all biscuit recipes): essential to keep ingredients cold. The butter needs to be hard, straight from the fridge. If it's softened or melted, the dough will be too sticky to handle. Use cold water and cold milk, and make sure the mashed potatoes are at least room temperature (although the dough will be easier to handle if they've been refrigerated). We ate these with turkey and gravy for lunch on the day after Thanksgiving... couldn't have been better!

So I had left over mashed potatoes and didn't want to throw them out. Came on the sight and found this recipe. WOW! Glad I stumbled upon this one. I followed the recipe exactly. I mean I didn't change a thing. Tender, fluffy biscuits turned out. I had 18 good sized biscuits and my kids loved them. Even my picky eater husband liked them. Thanks for the recipe. I will never again throw away my mashed potatoes. Next time I will try to throw in some grated cheddar cheese.

These biscuits are indeed very light and fluffy.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed using leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes, skins and all.  The skins in the biscuits were a little disturbing and I wouldn't recommend using that type of mashed potatoes again.  The biscuits were nothing spectacular and actually rather tasteless but as I stated before very light.

great recipe.  I followed the advice of other raters and didn't add the water but I upped the milk to 1/2 C.  I added chives and about 3/4 cup shredded cheese and for kicks I added 2 tbsp of sourcream and onion chip dip on a whim and they came out amazing!  Great way to use up left over mash. potatoes AND even more they are awesome themselves warmed up as leftovers for breakfast with eggs and ham the next morning!!

I made these exactly like the recipe, and I agree with some others that the dough needs more flour. I had to add quite a bit on the board to be able to knead and roll them out. Very sticky dough. But the flavor is very good. I think I'll stick with my standard biscuit recipe for the most part, but this was a new way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.

These were awesome! I left out the salt, and put in garlic salt and about a cup (or so) of cheddar cheese. My husband, who just isn't a huge bread guy, ate 3 at dinner and asked for one this morning with his eggs and sausage saying they "were REALLY good honey" . Little did he know they were the easiest things in the world to make. Only took about 10min. Wonderful!

that's a keeper indeed: I used plain boiled potatoes just smashed with a fork, they turned out to perfection. I like the idea of adding parmesan cheese, too.

I thought this recipe was just okay, although my family seemed to like it. I substituted all milk for the liquid, cut the sugar down to 1/8 cup, added some grated cheddar, and used garlic salt instead of regular. I brushed the tops of them with melted butter instead of milk. They sort of reminded me of the Red Lobster biscuits!

These were fabulous!!!  My only change would be to leave out the sugar.  They taste fine with it, but for a more savory biscuit, I'd leave it out.  Still, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I only put in 1T of sugar and probably could have left it out all together. Like many other reviewers, I just rolled and flattened them with my hands. These were very light and tasty!

These were excellent! What a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes. I had made way more mashed potatoes than I really needed, so I made a Shepherd's pie, and these biscuits on the side. These biscuits were very easy to make, and taste great!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were fantastic!

These were the best biscuits I've ever made, and I've made thousands.  They came out so light and fluffy that I had to use a lot of will power not to eat half the batch immediately.  They were even good warmed up in the microwave the next morning.  Served with honey/butter.

I finally found a way to use up those leftover potatoes no one eats! This is a wonderful savory biscuit recipe! They turned out moist on the inside and nice and crunchy outside just the way I like 'em!  

The potatoes I used were red skin ones that I had "smashed" with butter, fresh rosemary, thyme & chives the night before so that really gave these biscuits great flavor!

I didn't use all the water called for, maybe half of it. Also I used about 1/2 the sugar called for. I didn't really need the dough, just pressed it together then patted it out. I got a dozen biscuits out of it!

These are only second to Kentucky biscuits on this site (only because you can eat those ones with jam, these ones just didn't taste as good cold)

These were awesome.  Fluffy,flavorful, and probably the first biscuit I have ever made that came out tender and moist.  I followed the directions exactly (although I had to shape the sticky dough with my hands and not a biscuit cutter) and a 15 minute baking time was perfect.  My leftover potatoes were rough mashed yukon gold that still had the skins on.  They had just a little butter and milk and also salt, pepper, and parsley.  These biscuits were a wonderful way to use up and "stretch" extra mashed potatoes.

These were great.  I added some stuff to cater to my tastes.  I cooked up some bacon bits and added them once they cooled, also dried chives, and dried onion flakes.  We ate them with poached eggs, it was an all in one meal.

These were delicious!  They rose amazingly high, and had a wonderful tender interior.  I made these with ~2C of leftover mashed potatoes (made with only skim milk the night before) - the extra potato made it moist enough that I didn't need to add the water.

I was a bit skeptical when I saw this recipe but I tried it and it is GREAT!  I only had whole wheat flour on hand and I used leftover garlic mashed potatos and they were lighter than any other biscuits I've tried to make with WW flour.  I am glad I tried this recipe.  It made almost twice as many biscuits as was listed but they are so good I am glad to eat them again tomorrow.

This is great.  I used about 2 cups and maybe 1/4 cup of the water.  I also substituted soy milk for the milk.  Added some Parmesan and garlic seasoning and done in 20 minutes.  Great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.

Nice dough. I used instant mashed potatoes.  These have an interesting texture, not your typical tender, flakey biscuits, but good non the less.

These were really good.  Like other reviewers, I felt the dough was sticky so I added a little more flour.  Also, the biscuits did stick to my non-stick cookie sheet - so I'll spray it first next time.  However, I agree that this is a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  The whole family liked them.

It is important to use fairly dry mashed potatoes otherwise the dough will be too wet.

So delicious! I reduced the sugar to a little under 1 Tbsp but otherwise prepared them as written. I didn't have any leftover mashed potatoes so I microwaved 2 smallish potatoes for about 5 minutes, mashed them with some milk, and let them cool before I added them to the dough. Amazing how crispy yet tender these biscuits are with so little fat! And even after a few days in the fridge they're not stale or hard. Very easy to prepare and much better results than allllll the other biscuit recipes I've always used. Thanks!

These biscuits were absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe to 16 servings and I ended up with about 24 pretty large biscuits! I also had to add an additional 1/2 a cup of flour so it wasn't too sticky though. And I put some grated cheese on top before I put them in the oven and it tasted great! My mom and I love them! They're a little sweet but I think that's good, but you might like a little less sugar... They were very moist and fluffy, really good!

I was very skeptical about making biscuits with mashed potatoes, I didn't even know it was possible. I was worried that they would be too dense but they were perfect! Light, fluffy and flavorful. Very surprised, will definitely make again. Thank you!

No need to add water -- the potatoes provided plenty of liquid so the milk and egg were enough. My mashed potatoes had the skins on them still, which added a pleasant color and texture to the otherwise-pale biscuits. I had put garlic, rosemary, and thyme, in the potatoes, which tasted wonderful in the biscuits, adding lots of flavor.

Thanks for this.  I won the battle over leftover potato salad with this recipe! My little one and I made these  with no changes except using pureed potato salad instead of mashed potatoes  & we turned the oven down to 350, as ours runs a bit hot!  They were so good!  May try drop method next!

I made these into garlic cheddar biscuits by reducing the sugar to 1.5Tbs, adding 1tsp garlic powder (Ok a little more. We like garlic.) and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar. I left out the water, used 1/2 cup whole milk but ended up having to use 3 cups flour. My mashers were from the Moe's Fabulous Mashed Potatoes recipe which uses Yukon potatoes instead of Russet. These were very light and fluffy with a slightly different texture than regular mashers. Lastly, at 450 after 15 minutes, the biscuit bottoms were very dark, but insides *just* finished. Next time I'll either lower the temp and cook longer, or move the oven rack up one.

I followed other reviewers' advice and made savory biscuits. I already had leftover garlic mashed potatoes, so I omitted the sugar and also sub'd buttermilk for the regular milk. I also did not roll them out and cut them, I added a little extra buttermilk and made drop biscuits in my muffin tin. They were a hit!

Very good.  I skipped the rolling and cutting.  To save time I just rolled balls in my hand and flattened on the tray.  I didn't add much sugar - as suggested by others - maybe only 1/8 to 1/4 Tbsp.  Wished I had had honey in the house to put on these!

Its so cool! You never would guess it had potatoes in them. My daughter and husband gobbled up and were flabbergasted that there were potatoes in them. They loved them. I liked it because I didnt have to use shortening. And great way to use up potatoes.

We were disappointed.  My husband made them & had to add a lot of extra flour because they were so sticky.  Doubt if we'll make again.

I screwed up somehow and it came out sloppy and there was no way I was going to be able to add enough flour to be able to kneed it... So I made drop biscuits from it and they were OUTSTANDING. No water only milk.

These are very good and tender! After reading the reviews, I added just 2 tbsp of sugar instead of the full 1/4 cup. I noticed that I did not even have to use all the water the recipe called as it started binding very well with just a bit of the water. I might need to reduce the baking time as my biscuits came out a bit burned. I think this recipe and the Never Fail Biscuits recipe from this site are my favorite ones . I highly recommend to try the latter. You will not be disappointed!

Forgot the sugar. Added chives. Brushed butter on tops before baking, and after. They were good. I can't wait to try them with the sugar - I think it'll add a nice sweetness. Great way to use leftover mashed potatoes.

Yes, no more guilt tossing leftover mashed potatoes. Everyone, young and old loved them. Fluffy, moist, and good.  They rise up better than the tube stuff in the stores, and you don't have to tummy tickle the dough man.

It was very light & good tasting. I used a little less potato because that was all the leftover mashed potatoes I had. Will make again & probably cut down on the amount of potatoes!

Wonderful biscuits. Very light and spongy. 
I prepared the recipe with plain old mashed potatoes/butter/salt. There is nothing I would change at all.
But I could see using jacked-up mashed potatoes too!
I WILL make them again.

These are really good to make if you are running a bit low on potatoes. I didn't add sugar and they were just right for me and my o/h who had them with bacon and onions. I too just made 'em into balls, and I didn't add the water either. But really good, better than ones I made with sour cream :D

I just made a batch of these biscuits- as per one of the reviewer I added very little sugar , no water only milk and did not roll out the dough to save time and dishes :), so I rolled them also in my hand- when done ,the texture was fine, however, it was very bland to my taste- if i make them again i will add perhaps a dry oregano or other herbs - definitely more salt to bring the taste of potatoes with salt ...  I did not enjoy the taste as it is -per recipe ....  also the 450 F may be to high for some ovens, i had to lower my temperature to 400F

Solid biscuits and a great way to use up leftovers.  They were quite sticky, so I made drop biscuits instead, and they turned out great.  I made 6 larger biscuits, so they took 15min to turn golden.  The addition and cheddar and garlic powder improved the flavors.  I'm excited to try them with some sausage gravy.

I made this yesterday night with my leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving. I omitted the sugar from this recipe as I wanted more of a savory biscuit. I also used a half stick of butter still cold, and diced into tiny pieces and mixed with the batter. I added shredded cheddar cheese, some italian seasoning, a dash of salt. I did not add water but added more milk. I only had about 1 1/4 cup of mashed potatoes and ended up with about 12 biscuits. They were delicious, super soft and moist. I will definitely be making these again!

I used leftover mashed potatoes, and ended up using all the liquid, 2/3 cup. I used all milk.  The consistency of the dough wasn't much different than any other biscuit recipe, but the mashed potatoes seemed to make it stickier.  After baking for 15 minutes mine were done, and with a little butter they were fantastic! Although slightly heavier that non-potato biscuits, I don't think this was a bad thing.  I could taste the flavor of my mashed potatoes, which is butter, garlic, salt, and pepper.  I'm having them with dinner tonite, but in the morning I'm going to make sausage gravy, and I have no doubt they will be perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were GOOD!  I had half the amount of leftover mashies, so I halved the rest of the recipe.  I did use a whole egg, so I cut the water.  Made 4 HUGE drop biscuits; I baked for 20 minutes to assure that the centers were done but the tops got a bit dark.  VERY fluffy -- can't remember the last time I had such a fluffy biscuit. Good with just butter, also good with stewed cherries!  Gonna try leftover garlic cheese mashies next time.

All I dis differently was omit the water (feedback from others) and I added some parmesan cheese. This will be a staple for sure!

I make this ALL the time now!! I often make with 1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 white potato... Definitely more flour ... I never bother to brush with milk before baking ... We all love this ... I keep the leftover dough and make biscuits again the next day!!

I tried this recipe today,with a few changes. I grated baked potatoes since no one will eat mashed potatoes in this house(1 1/2 c.).Also used 3/4 c. of oat bran and 1 3/4 c. of white flour. They came out light and delicious. I might try the variation of adding cheese and chives the next time I make chili.Also I added the liquid as needed and used less than the recipe called for.Thanks for the awesome bisquit recipe.

First time I've made biscuits and it won't be the last.  These were soooo good!! I can't think of a better way to use up left over mash potatoes.  My mash potatoes had garlic and herbs so I didn't find these biscuits too sweet like the other reviews but I also added a bit of parm cheese.

This recipe was excellent! I was looking for a way to get rid of extra mashed potatoes and this fit perfectly.  I did not add the sugar and instead added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 cup sour cream and they came out very light and fluffy. I used them as an open faced turkey pot pie. Thanks for such a great recipe!

These are great with left over sweet potatoes - not only does it give them a nice sweet taste but it also adds some color.

These are quite good.  I think I will leave out the 1/4 c sugar next time I make them as I prefer a savory biscuit.  I made them with cream cheese & chive mashed potatoes.

great!  i always have leftover potatoes when we order from the local chicken place.  this was a great way to use them up.  these were soft, almost like a roll.  good flavor.  my only mistake was that i made them with my largest biscuit cutter.  with these, smaller would be better as they are too soft to hold their shape.

Excellent and easy. Based on the reviews here I cut the sugar down to about 1/3 of the amount called for in the recipe and it was the perfect amount. I didn't want them sweet since my mashed potatoes had fresh chives in them. I sprinkled in some Penzey's Fox Point seasoning (awesome blend of shallots, garlic, onion, garlic, salt) for a savory note. When I first mixed in the wet ingredients I left out the water, and then added gradually as I was shaping the ball of dough with the fork in the mixing bowl. I did use all the water called for in the recipe. Thanks for a yummy way to use up left over mashed potatoes!

These are so good, I can't wait to make them again. Because I made them with sausage gravy I only used 2 T. sugar, I was afraid they might be too sweet otherwise.  I still have some leftover mashed potatoes so we may have them for breakfast again tomorrow.

Wow! What a great way to use up those leftovers! Don't get grossed out but I used leftover potato salad that I wasn't too pleased with and added some mashed potato flakes to absorb some of the liquid. Also added some garlic powder and some parsley flakes. Kneaded in the bowl and just shaped into biscuit shapes. Thanks for sharing!

To lessen the calories, I substituted 1/3 cup Splenda for the sugar and reduced fat margarine.  I also substituted Egg Beaters for the egg.  I agree, the liquids are too much.  Next time I will completely eliminate the water.  Sprayed the sheet because I didn't want them to stick.  This was a nice way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  Thanks.

These may be the best biscuits I've ever made. Very moist and fluffy. I did have to add roughly 1/3 cup more flour though because it was so wet like "glop" you would put on top of chicken pot pie. Fantastic recipe!

I doubled the recipe and added a box of stuffing. It's great for Thanksgiving if you're using turkey, and awesome for ranch dip if you're using chicken.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I had to add A LOT more flour to this dough to get it to a kneading consistency.  It started out more like a batter.  They then seemed to be lacking a little flavor.  Other reviews have been quite favorable, however, so I may give them a try another time.
