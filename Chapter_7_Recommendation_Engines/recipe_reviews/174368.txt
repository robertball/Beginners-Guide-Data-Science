This is actually my recipe and I have to say that they altered it a little when they published it. I actually sprinkle a tablespoon or two of flour into the bottom of the crust to prevent the sogginess from the juices. It works really well.

This recipe is good for a base but I made quite a few changes after reading the reviews first. I followed the suggestion to add a little more flour so I used 2 tablespoons flour.  I made homemade caramel sauce and put some in the bottom and on top of the apples as well as drizzled over the finished pie.  I didin't think 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon was quite enough for crumble topping so I added a whole teaspoon.  I cut back on the brown sugar in the pie filling to 1/4 cup since the caramel and the crumb topping was already sweet.  I want to taste a littel tartness from the apples.  Suggestions for soggy crust.  When you are preheating your oven, pop your crust in for about 5 minutes before you fill.  Someone suggested to me a long time ago and I do every pie this way, even the ones I freeze.  I have no problems with doughy or soggy crust.  I'm giving a 4 star since it is a good start to a pie but I did have to altar the recipe.

This is an excellent tasting pie.  The crunchy topping is wonderful, with a nutty (somewhat coco-nutty) flavor.  I didnt't read all the reviews before I made it, but would recommend using just a touch more cinnamon like the other review states. Yummy

I made this for my family, and they all really loved it. I added extra cinnamon to my recipe, however, because I know my family are big cinnamon lovers. Unfortunately, the pie did not have as much of a caramel-y taste as I wanted, but I did not use exact measurements, so I will not rate down for my possible mistake. Very good pie!

Excellent recipe! I read the other reviews about the pie being too 'soupy'. I decided to add a tsp of cornstarch to the filling mixture to avoid this and it thickened up nicely.

I read through all the reviews before attempting this recipe. I took the submitters advice and sprinkled flour over the bottom crust so it wouldn't be soggy. I also cut back the brown sugar in the filling by half so it wouldn't be too sweet (as quite a few reviewers commented it was too sweet) and added nutmeg to the topping and filling. I used pecans in the topping instead of almonds only because my husband dosen't like almonds. I thought there was a little too much topping, I didn't use it all. I think next time I make the crumble topping, I'll increase the butter. This came out very well, it was a very pretty pie. The issue I had was though it looked quite pretty, once I cut it, it bled all over the place and fell apart. And it didn't taste good with the extra flour on the bottom to keep it from being soggy. We didn't go past that. I'm sorry.It was pretty. I feel bad that it just didn't work out for us.

I took both the cornstarch and the flour in the bottom suggestions and had zero sogginess. This is SO GOOD! However, my pie tin was totally overfilled and exploded in the oven and made a mess. Next time I will only use 4 apples and cut the filling by 1/3. I thought the amount of caramel was subtle but definitely noticeable. since I love caramel, I will use just as much caramel next time, even with less apples.

I did use granny smith but left out the lemon juice and it was good this way.  I just forgot it, but since an ealreir review said granny smiths were bitter, I think it was a good thing.  I also skipped the almonds in the topping because I didn't have any, and it was great.  The second time I made it, I made it in a 9x13 aluminum pan and did 1 1/2 times the recipe and I used pecans because it is what I already had.  I drizzed it with a little of the carmel sauce for looks too.  I used the No roll Pie Crust I from this site and it was great too.  Mixed the dough right in the pan I spread it in.  Very easy. Great recipe. taking it to a wienie roast tonight. Oh, I did double the cinnamon in the topping, but I love cinnamon.

I made this for an extended family gathering last year, and it received rave reviews.  I used half green, half red apples in the pie and chopped pecans instead of almonds in the topping.  Someone's ex-BIL, who never eats or converses with anyone, and usually only stays 15 minutes, sat and ate three pieces, swore it tasted just like his deceased sister's pie, and chatted sociably with me for 45 minutes.  He apparently later called the host (who nearly keeled over in shock) to add more raves for the pie.

This turned out fabulous! I doubled the recipe and made two pies, and they were delicious. Gave the other between family and friends.  I took a lot of the reviews and added flour to the bottom of the pie and 1 tsp cornstarch to thicken it up. I wasn't runny at all! I also omitted the caramel during the baking process, since everyone said you couldn't taste it.  I added the caramel on each piece before serving, and you still couldn't really taste it over all the other flavors, but with vanilla ice cream it was great.  I took a tip off the pie shell box and after baking for 15 minutes, I put foil around the crust's edges, and they baked perfect!  Will be making this again next year.

I would not recommend using granny smith apples for this pie. They give the pie a bitter taste that overpowers the caramel. I also found that the crust got very soggy with the moisture from the apples and the caramel sauce. My home ec class will not be using this recipe again.

Very tasty!  Mine was a little runny, but this did not detract from eating it all.   Perhaps next time I will add a little tapioca to my apple mixture to thicken it up.  I baked the crust per a previous suggestion and it kept it from being soggy.

This was delicious.. My first apple pie! I drizzled caramel sauce on top of the crumb coating and it formed a delectable candy texture. I tried both the corn starch and flour on the bottom so did not really think it came out soggy. Next time I would omit the caramel sauce on the bottom because some find it too sweet!

This was INCREDIBLE. When I put all the sliced apples into the pie shell, I was a little concerned because they were piled SO high. The crumble topping was a little perilous! But the apples baked down a little bit, and it turned out fine. It was devoured in no time at all! Great recipe.

It was good, but not spectacular. I couldn't single out the taste of the caramel, so it was basically a waste of calories.

I make this pie EVERY Thanksgiving, Christmas, and if not Christmas, then for New Years!! I also bake the pies (I double the recipe and make two pies) for 2.5-3 hours til the apples are soft. It is my families favorite pie and is requested every year!! I add a little extra flour to the apple mixture and for less juice you can add a tablespoon of corn starch to the apple seasoning mixture to thicken the juice. Sometimes think outside the box and don’t bash the recipe. There is usually a fix of some sort and you may have to play with it til you get the results you desire.

Made this for thanksgiving.  It got rave reviews from everyone!  I will agree with others that I couldn’t taste the caramel as much as I’d like, but it was so yummy no one minded.  I might try a higher quality caramel sauce next time.  My only real complaint was the crust.  I followed some of the tips in the reviews and put a tablespoon of flour on the crust before adding the ingredients, added a couple teaspoons of cornstarch to the apple mixture, and even baked the crust for 5 minutes like one review suggested and the crust still was basically raw.  I’m not an avid pie maker so I’m not sure what I did wrong.  I will definitely make it again but maybe I will try pre-baking the crust or just making it without the crust as a crisp.

This pie gets rave reviews from everyone I bake it for.  There are only 2 things I would change: 1. Melt the butter, don't cube it for the topping.  Otherwise you end up with butter clumps and dry flour patches on top.  Also, wait until after the pie bakes to add Carmel on top.  The type I used hardened when I baked it and made the pie chewy on top.  Otherwise, it's great!

I made this recipe, the juice from the apple mixture ruined the pie crust, it turned into a cobbler.  Tasty, but a mess to serve.  Next time if I try this recipe again, I would add corn starch or tapioca to the apple mixture to solidify the pie filling, and I would cut the caramel in half, and not put any caramel on the bottom pie crust, only on top of the mixture.  Interestingly, I read many reviews that stated they would add more cinnamon, I would do the opposite, I tasted too much cinnamon.

I love the crumble on top!  I made it just as the recipe called for.  I think next time I'll try the flour/cornstarch.

Far too "soupy".  Not impressive.
