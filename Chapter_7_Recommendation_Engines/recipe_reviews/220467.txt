Very good!  We enjoyed this salad.  Used Agave, about a tsp.  Used regular quinoa as I didn't have red and cut the oil in half.  Also, did't use any goat cheese.  The flavors went  very well together.   Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Colorful, tasty salad!  I ran out of quinoa, so used mostly millet.  I omitted the salt, and changed the arugula to spinach.  We didn't need the cheese!  I'll be making this again soon!

What I loved the most besides the taste was that when I had leftovers, salads usually go bad in a day once you've tossed it with the dressing. Because of the arugula this actually keeps well. I was taking it to a potluck so I assembled it all then tossed it with the dressing right before I served.

My sister and I really enjoyed this salad.  I didn't have arugula on hand, but I bet it would be delicious.  Instead I used the fresh spinach I had in my fridge.  I cut down the oil quite a bit, skipped the onions, and threw in some chopped almonds.  This even kept well for lunch leftovers the next day!

I made this yesterday and substituted kale for the arugula and used canned beets because I already had them on hand. It was delicious! I think some reviews mentioned the arugula or spinach getting soggy when the leftovers were saved, but the kale is a hearty green and it was just as crisp the second day. Kale is also really cheap (I spent 43 cents on it!) so I recommend it. I also omitted the sugar from the dressing and added extra garlic. It was a quick, easy recipe. I took it to a picnic and everyone loved it!

I didn't have red quinoa so I used regular, and I substituted the red wine vinegar with balsamic (using slightly less because it's a lot stronger in flavor.)  I also used gorgonzola cheese instead of the goat cheese.  But let me tell you, it still turned out FANTASTIC. The sweetness of the roasted beets really worked with the saltiness of the cheese, and was balanced out perfectly with the slightly bitter/spicy flavor of the arugula. I will make it again and again!!

Good bones, too much vinegar. Next time I'll cut it by a third. Too much goat cheese. I think the arugula is a great addition but didn't like it wilted with the left overs, so I'll probably add it separately next time.

Great tasting vegan recipe! No goat cheese or green onions, subbed spinach for arugula, and white quinoa for red. Used 1/3c EVOO, 1/4c champagne vinegar, 1t sugar, 1/2t salt. No need to mix in steps, waited for quinoa to cool, then mixed all in.  Top with sunflower seeds for crunch.

I enjoyed this very much.  I didn't add any cheese. I used multi color Quinoa.  It was good, but next time I will cut down the vinegar and olive oil to save some calories, like someone else had suggested.  Thanks! That is a horrible photo!!!  Mine was pretty and good looking.

I just made this recipe today and found it absolutely delicious! I am rating it 5 stars even though I used less oil and vinegar to try and be more calorie conscious (1/3 cup of each) because I think it would have been equally tasty exactly as written. I used fresh beets, and only 1 1/4 cups water when cooking the quinoa as that was the package 
directions. Thanks for sharing and I will definitely make this again!!!!

This is my new favourite salad! Made it with white quinoa the first time since I didn't have red one, but due to the beets it got a lovely pink colouring as well. The second time I used red quinoa (first time I used it) which I found to be a little too coarse. I will just stick with white quinoa in the future.

This is SO good.  Mine looked nothing like the photo, but tasted great.  I made two minor changes: regular quinoa and only 2 oz of arugula.

Love this salad; have made it multiple times. The flavor is amazing. Used regular quinoa, more arugula, and less oil and vinegar.

The salad was great the dressing not so much. A bit too sour and tangy. I can easily sub out or make my own next time. Also it needed a bit of a crunch so I added some pecans to it. I would have added walnuts or sunflowers seeds but I couldn't find any in my house. Just needs a little something extra.

this was so awesome.. i used white quinoa for the red.. left out the sugar and the goat cheese, halved the oil (and probably could have gone a little less), and quartered the salt.. all in hopes of making it just a bit lighter.. subbed spinach for arugula and used about half the amount b/c that's all i had left in the fridge.. i ran out of red wine vinegar half way through so i used balsamic for the rest.. didn't slice and peel the super huge beet i used prior to cooking.. i only cut it in half and put it directly in the steamer.. the peel is easier to remove after it's been cooked.. i topped mine with some additional pepper for that extra kick.. ty so much for the recipe

Delicious. We made this to serve as the salad for our Easter Sunday lamb supper. We will be making it again. Used rainbow quinoa instead of red to save a few dollars. Still amazing.

I made this for my family - children in their 30s and grandchildren, 6 & 4 - plus guests; it won rave reviews from all but the 4-year-old.  I will make it again and often and will share the recipe with others.

This is an easy, unique, and healthy one for potlucks.  I just bagged up the sliced onions and chopped arugula and mixed them in right before serving.  I also adapted it as a vegan option by leaving the cheese on the side as a serving-topper, rather than mixing it in.  (The mushy cheese ain't all that, anyway.)  It's also gluten free.

It needs about half of the dressing.   the first two times I mad it it was greasy and way too tart. I habitually reduce the sugar in recipes, and tried a couple variations.  I  found later it's much tastier with no sugar and balsamic or rice vinegar. The red wine vinegar (or at least the stuff I can get) is way too tart and buries the lovely nuttiness of, well, most of the rest of the ingredients.

I'm also a huge fan of garlic, but for this one, again, allowing the arugula and quinoa to shine makes it better; I'd recommend using a small clove, and chopping rather than crushing.

I am baffled by the review that calls it bland.  This can be a blast of great nutty flavor if it's balanced.

Fresh beets not-overcooked make this.  I kind of overdid my beets once and it was OK, but not nearly as good texture-wise.

I love this salad.  It is so fresh tasting and the combination of flavors only taste better as they marry.  Because there's only two of us I add the arugula as we eat it.  I usually put the arugula on the plate with the beet mixture on top.  I've found that balsamic vinegar is a better choice for the dressing as it has a more earthy flavor that works well with the beets.  I usually use 1/2 lavender infused balsamic with a good Modena and the dressing is out of this world.  I find the infused vinegars are too strong to use alone without cutting it half and half.  I use 1/3 cup olive oil instead of 1/2.  I steam the beets and use the water left over with all the beet juices to cook the quinoa. I don't want to waste those vitamins.   Sometimes we eat this salad alone for a great light vegetarian meal.

Despite it's riotous pink color (which was a little off-putting to some of us), it was a great flavor combination. And very healthy. Needed a squeeze of lemon, though.

Great recipe but way too much vinegar.  Maybe it was my particular brand but used less than it called for and was waaaay too vinegar-y, and I love vinegar.  Next time would maybe use balsamic instead since it has a more mild flavor.  Definitely go easy on the dressing and you can always add more!  Recipe is otherwise very forgiving, can use any ratio of salad mix, quinoa, and beets that you like!  We used one giant glove of garlic and definitely leaves an aftertaste - don't overdo it there.  Consider adding nuts like pistachios for a little more protien and texture.  Also, the diced beets took over 20 min to steam for us and were still firm (but we used more quantity).

Why has this salad not been in the AR magazine yet?  It is delicious, easy to make and filling.  I use one can of beets and dice them and regular quinoa (not red).  I also cut back on the vinegar a little bit... Soooooo good.  Even my "Where's the meat?" husband loves it and brings it to work for lunch.

This is absolutely delicious!  Even my carnivore husband likes it.  I use sheep's milk feta cheese instead of goat cheese, and I roast my beets (wrap in foil and bake at 425 F in oven for one hour, then turn off oven and let cool in oven) instead of steaming them.  When I made this tonight I reduced the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup each and reduced the sugar to 1 heaping teaspoon -- I think it came out even better this way than when I used the original dressing proportions.  The salad also keeps well when there are leftovers.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is really delicious. I don't like arugula, so I just omitted it. I did half the olive oil and mixed the other half with water to make the cup with the red wine vinegar.

My parent have been doing very well on their diets, but are getting bored with their regular salads.  I made this for them and they are now eating twice a week as part of their lunch rotation.  The only thing I change is substituting agave nectar for the sugar and cutting back a bit on the goat cheese and amount of olive oil to meet their allowed calories.

This is my new favourite salad. I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar ( I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand) and also substituted feta for the goat cheese. Lastly, I used crispy onions instead of green onions. This salad is simply delicious!

This was a nice change from the salads we usually make.  And very healthy.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so used red wine.  Also used 1/3 C of both the olive oil and wine after reading previous reviews.  Result was outstanding!  Very good and we will definitely make this again.

This recipe is a great beginning. For the holidays, I wanted green and red. The layers were Arugula, red quinoa cooked in mushroom stock and dressing added after cooked, fresh beets, cucumbers (slightly salted), red pepper, feta cheese, spicey, sweet pecans and walnuts. The dressing was made with these proportions and a bit more, but with chili olive oil and Italian Balsamic Vinegar...regular olive oil and red wine vinegar was also added.  I made this for a bridal luncheon and got a lot of compliments. I will be making it again.

I halved the sugar and the salt. I also used the equal amount of feta rather than goat cheese. It is a good salad, I could see making it again especially since we love beats and are always looking for new ways to eat them.

I made this for a very formal dinner and it was a major hit.  I did not have hazelnuts and substituted almonds that I lightly sautéed in a little olive oil. I also used the  following hazelnut vinaigrette but again I substituted almonds for the hazelnut: 
Hazelnut Vinaigrette
•	1 tablespoon honey
•	3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
•	1/2 cup toasted crushed hazelnuts
•	1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

This was terrific.  I added spinach to the arugula.  Also added chick peas, corn and avocado.  I used regular quinoa, and reduced the sugar to taste. I used a combination of vinegars: white balsamic and red wine.  Will def. make again.

Used regular quinoa instead of red, but otherwise followed as precisely as possible (the rule in our house - change it AFTER you've tried the original recipe).  Delicious.  My husband and I both had seconds!  He wants me to make this dish for company, which is quite easy to make it ahead and just do the very last step right before company comes over.

I reduced the amount of olive oil in the dressing.   Definitely mix a portion of the dressing into the quinoa otherwise it will be too dry.

I admit, I did not make it exactly as written. 1. I'm not a big dressing person so I used half of what was called for.  2.  I completely forgot to use the arugula. I bought the arugula but I had a glass of wine while cooking supper and I ate it without, and it was fabulous.  I'm looking forward to leftovers when I can eat it with arugula. 3.  I added an avocado and didn't use the green onion since I didn't have any.  This was so yummy! I love beets and these flavors work very well together!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful symphony of flavors! I used canned sliced beets and regular quinoa. It tastes delicious without goat cheese, which I didn't have on hand, but I do think goat or feta cheese would enhance it even further.

A few minor changes to cut the vinegar taste (because my husband hates the taste):  Added some sesame oil and some sugar and baking soda.  Turned out AMAZING!

Received rave reviews from the whole family.  My  Grandson ate at least 3 helpings leaving me with a empty salad bowl. Great combination of colors, flavors and crunch. I did add some crushed salted almonds for extra texture

This was so delicious. I added red onion instead of green onions, and chopped celery instead of arugula as I did not have either in my fridge.  My husband loved it.
Will be my summer favorite .

Make this, now! You will not regret it. Next time, I will make as written, but use less oil/vinegar. Also, mix the beets and quinoa together but keep arugula and goat cheese separate. Then, combine when serving. Will stay crisper that way for better leftovers...because this make a lot! (Note to future Janet: try with regular quinoa to see which I like better)

What a delicious salad!  I tweaked it by using honey instead of sugar and I added garbanzo beans too.  Also used feta instead and added some roasted almonds to give it a crunch.

Great salad ! I love beets, so I doubled their  amount. The beets took more 30 minutes of cooking for me. The cooking time varies depending on the the size of the beets,  their freshness and how thick you slice them. The amount of the vinaigrette sounded like a lot to me, so I made only about 2/3 of it and it was plenty. For the greens, I used a mixture of baby kale and spinach. Last, I had about 1/2 cup of chickpeas in the fridge that needed to be used so I threw them in. Oh and I forgot to  add the cheese. I am  sure the salad would have  been even better with it.

I don't believe in salads. My husband and I only really eat them when he's on a dieting kick. I don't normally find them satisfying, I dont like having them as part of a weight loss plan (my stance is that the real Asians over in Asia dont have an obesity epidemic yet, and lettuce salads have never been popular there). This salad, speaking as a certified salad-hater, is pretty tasty, and we eat it as 2 meals. The beets, quinoa, and goat cheese make it filling and satisfying. It's a great combination of zesty, earthy, and sweet. I've made this salad several times now, sticking as close to the recipe as I can. I use a spinach arugula blend cuz that's what my supermarket carries, 4 oz of goat cheese instead of 5 cuz my supermarket carries 8 oz logs, and one time I used mostly white balsamic instead of red wine vinegar cuz I ran out. This salad is a keeper!

This was really yummy and healthy :)

Based on my dietary needs, I tweaked the receipt a bit and added less red wine vinegar and did not add sugar at all. I figured the beets were sweet enough, and they were! I also used a mixed greens bag of spinach and arugula, and added more of it to the recipe. Also added less goat cheese, but regardless, very good and will be making it again :)

This was very good and refreshing.  I did make one change I used goat cheese rolled in cinnnamon and dried cranberries.   I had it on hand from Christmas and figured it would only add to the flavors which it did. Will make again but will cut down on the quinoa -- way too much.

It was fantastic!! I used regular quinoa, and the beets turned it pink (looked really pretty). I also added toasted pecans for a bit of crunch. Next time I make it I'll go a little easier on the amount of olive oil, but delicious overall.

Simply delicious!  My kids enjoyed the red quinoa alone in the dressing.  It's packed full of flavor.  The peppery arugula with the tang of the feta and and bite of the quinoa is just an awesome combo.  Plus your getting greens, and iron, magnesium, calcium and protein!  I'll add this to my salad go-to's.

Good ideas in this recipe. The goat cheese was an excellent idea, and its creaminess pairs really well with sweetness and acid. 

Made a few changes for added flavor and texture.

Left out the grains entirely (personal preference)
Added spinach into the mix
Added chopped walnuts and craisins for crunch and sweetness.
Replaced red wine vinegar with balsamic for more sweetness.
Added tahini to the dressing and blended for a creamy texture.

I had a similar recipe made a lunch presentation so went looking for a recipe!  Thought I would share a few ideas  :) The salad was dressed with raspberry vinaigrette if you don't have time to make the dressing. .  Also you can add pumpkin  or sunflower seeds or nuts to taste as well as dried craisins or cherries or blueberries.

Loved this...it turned out very well, the only thing I changed was to add Lemon Pepper to it as well as some walnuts. The Almonds definetly help with the texture, and while I love Arugula, I felt it needed just a little more flavouring, hence the lemon pepper... Presto.. Perfect!`

This recipe was ok but it was bland. We added walnuts to try to add more flavor/texture but it didn't improve the taste that much. It is probably a good base for a recipe.

I make this salad every time we get beets from the CSA. I love it! The sharp flavor of the goat cheese and arugula with the earthy-tasting beets and quinoa blends so well with the dressing. I reduce the amount of dressing by a quarter or half. This is a hit with the entire family from toddlers to grandparents!

So good! Loved the arugula as it was paired with the quinoa and beets. I used canned beets because that is what I had in the pantry and didn't have the goat cheese and it was even still outstanding. I will be making this salad again soon with the cheese.

This was excellent !!! I felt like I was at a upscale restaurant. Great flavors and was plenty as a meal by itself. Used spinach instead of arugula and added candied pecans on top for an added touch. We ate the beets in chunks and also used the water from cooking them to cook the quinoa which added more color. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

My entire family enjoyed this.  I cut the salad dressing in half, and used slightly less vinegar than the recipe called for because of recommendations from others.  We thought that was just enough dressing.  Otherwise, I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious!

This is delicious!  The recipe makes A LOT, more than six servings in my opinion. I mixed all, except for the greens, with the dressing.  I toss in the greens - arugula, spinach, or other deep greens- with a smaller amount of the quinoa/beet mix at serving time, enough for just the two of us. Then I have plenty of the mix for future salads later on, just add more fresh greens each time. I Only used about 2/3 of the dressing.

Very good. I cut down on the oil to about 1/3 cup and used white wine vinaigrette as it was all that I had. I packaged this to take to work for lunch. I combined the quinoa and the beets, and layered on top of arugula and brought a small container of the dressing. I will definitely make again!

Fantastic and so very pretty!  We'd run out of red wine vinegar, so we used apple cider vinegar, which was good.  I could see adding some nuts (walnuts or sunflower seeds).  Added salmon to the top, the buttery, rich fish flavor went very nicely with the salad.  Thanks for the great recipe.  A definite keeper!

The flavors were really good, but it was way too heavy.  Next time I will try using half the oil and half the goat cheese.

I thought this was delicious, and so did my boyfriend. Of course, we do love beets, so perhaps that makes a difference. I agree with Stacey McG that it is evern better the next day (in fact, it lasted several days). I did make a few changes based on what we had on hand & our preferences: white wine vinegar, only half of the oil, no sugar. Also the store didn't have goat cheese, but feta was a good substitution & stood up well to the mixing. This will be one of our favorites for sure. Makes a great lunch entree, as it's very filling.

This is a great salad however i thought it was a little mushy with the goat cheese crumbles added in the quinoa so i sliced the beets and goat cheese and put them around the plate and tossed the arugula and quinoa in the middle. this was great for those guests that dont like goat cheese or beets they could pick around it. It came out beautiful check out my photo in the gallery.

Excellent.  I've been eating on this all week and, without the dressing, keeps very well in a closed container in the fridge.  I did leave out the sugar and the goat cheese (because I can't have it and didn't have it, respectively).

This is also very good with chopped raw veg (tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli florets) thrown on top before serving.  It makes a very healthy and filling lunch.

Thank you to the person who submitted the recipe.

My sister-in-law brought this to our family's Easter brunch and I can't wait to make it myself.  It was fabulous!  I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit tart, but I found that quality really appealing.  It's so fresh, flavorful and healthy!

This has become one of my favorite side dishes. I like to substitute the goat cheese with feta, and usually omit the arugula (not because I don't like the dish when it's added, but because it's great without it).

My BF did not like this at all. I liked it OK, thought it was a bit much on the tangy/sour side with the vinegar and goat cheese so maybe if I make it again (just for myself) I'll go easy on one or both of those ingredients.

Like the ingredients but the vinegar was too overpowering for me.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time will cut the vinegar in half and decrease the oil and sugar as well.  Nuts would be a great addition to this.  Very versatile!

We thought this was a great salad recipe, even with substitutions. Took other people's advice, and used a little less oil. We did mix in half the dressing right when the quinoa was done. Everything else, we mixed with each serving we had so the spinach did not get soggy. This recipe is a keeper! Looking forward to trying it with arugula and goat cheese instead of spinach and feta.

Incredible.  My only changes were to halve the salt, increase the beets, and double the entire recipe :).   I thought the goat cheese was one of the best parts - don't leave it out!!!  I will be making this for summer parties - it tastes so fresh and delicious.  Thanks for this creative and perfect flavor combination.

Amazing!  I served this dish alongside citrus salmon and roasted asparagus.  Total hit!  I did use white sugar, but would replace in the future with another sweetener.

I make this for every pot luck I go to.  Everyone raves.  Usually use white wine vinegar (because that's what I keep on hand) and recommend including the goat cheese- its a nice flavor addition.

I really don't like arugula or beets, but I tried it and it was a hit for me and my guests.

Double dressing recipe and be sure not to add as much water to the quinoa as the directions state, if changing portion sizes.

I made this for the first time today, with a few modifications, and love it. I used half the oil and none of the sugar called for in the dressing and didn't miss either. I also used white quinoa since I didn't have red on hand, a combination of arugula and baby spinach (which I increased the amount of along with the amount of beets.) I'll definitely be making this again.

Five stars because it is my favorite quinoa recipe that I've tried. Next time I might up the proportion of beets and/or greens a bit.

I was leary looking at the ingredients, but it is really a very yummy unique salad.  Would be a great summer salad, perfect to pair with a white fish!

so glad I tried this out - people at the potluck loved it.  I agree with others that it would be better with a little less oil (and I'm someone who tends to like oily foods).

Loved this healthy, tasty dish! Used regular quinoa, didn't have green onions on hand so left them out, but added chopped pistachios. Delicious! I also didn't love the wilted arugula the second day, so will wait to add when we eat it.

Excellent.  Used 1/3 oil + 1/3 balsamic (little less and added water).  Threw in a bit of horseradish in the dressing and would try adding coriander next time.  Didn't really like blue cheese-stick with goat.

So easy and delicious!  Made the recipe exactly as the directions stated.  I've never cooked beets, so I didn't realize you had to peel them before you cooked them.  I will make this again and again!

This recipe made me really happy. I didn't alter a thing and the flavors balanced perfectly. I especially liked the beets and the goat cheese. This was the first quinoa recipe I've tried that didn't taste like something from a silo. I'm trying to go vegetarian, and recipes like this one certainly help ease the transition.

3 stars for the first day, but 4 stars for the leftovers. It was awesome the next day after all the flavors came together. My husband and I really enjoyed it and it was such a nice/healthy change from the usual side dishes.
