Very yummy recipe.  I make it with 16 oz of lentils, triple the other ingredients, and I add about 3T cumin, 1T curry to the lentils as they cook.  I find the lentils take about 35-40 min to cook.  It is a fabulous recipe to make in advance, and lasts quite a while.  One of my family's favorites - thanks!

This was delicious!  I made this once following the recipe, and we thought it was good.  I tried it again and added a few things.  Instead of olive oil, I used fat free italian dressing.  I also added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and 2 diced tomatoes.  Yum!

So good I made it twice this week!  I didn't use the Bay Leaf or the Celery, as I had none, but I did add a couple of pinches of Celery Seed which seemed to really boost the flavor.  I also made extra dressing, as it was a little dry at first.  I used Puy Lentils(French) , and it was fabulous!!!

5 stars when made with raw vegetables. I made it once as written and then again by cooking the lentils only with the bay leaf and keeping the rest of the ingredients raw. I liked it much better with the fresh raw ingredients. I use about half the onion and garlic called for though. Love the fresh lemon juice and olive oil dressing and have at times sub'd out the lemon juice for red wine vinegar! Seasoning/spice can be altered to taste and additional fresh raw veggies can be added as well. I enjoy this salad and make it often. The plus is it is healthy and good for you!

This is an easy, tasty alternative to the
standard salad fare.  I loved the tangy lemon
juice mixed with the olive oil.  A great
combination!  It's great for making
early in the morning for an afternoon or
evening meal, and tastes great the next
day.  A wonderful recipe!

This was excellent! My husband and I enjoyed it as a main dish and we liked it so much we ate it for breakfast the next day. Color, texture, and flavor are all wonderful. I like to serve it with whole-wheat pita bread.

I made this for a group. I cooked the lentils with half of the carrots and celery and all  of the garlic, bay leaf and thyme. I added the other half of the carrots and celery raw after cooking and draining the lentils to give the salad a little crunch. I also left all of the onions raw and added them and the rest of the  ingredients after cooking the lentils.  This was a big hit. People came back for seconds and thirds. I would definitely make this again.

I would like to say that this salad kept me alive during finals week when my money at school had run out. Lentils were the cheapest thing I could eat without getting scurvy. A huge batch of this in the fridge was excellent  to put on noodles, veggies, and in my tummy! Thanks for the recipe

This was OK.  It's certainly good for you, so for that reason alone I will probably make it again.  I may add some extra seasonings, though.  It was a little bland for my taste.

This recipe was very tasty.  The only change I would make would be to use chicken broth instead of water to kick up the flavor a bit.  My husband and I really like this!

Everyone thought this was very good. The seasoning is mild, but not boring. A food processor made the prip time very quick.

My first time making (and eating) lentils and this was so easy and SO yummy!  I doubled the dressing, and added a touch of liquid aminos to my own bowl.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this!  I make it with half the olive oil, often use dried parsley, and have found that yellow onion works very well when I don't have any red.
I find it takes a bit of getting used to - most people can take it or leave it the first time they try it - but it really grows on a person.  It's one of my favourite recipes.

The best! I've been trying different recipes for lentils for quite a while, and I feel that I've now found a keeper. I followed the recipe faithfully and felt that it needed a little adjusting at the end. The addition of some top quality balsamic vinegar beautifully brought it around to where I wanted it to be. Thanks, Jen, for sharing this!! I am intrigued by another reviewer's suggestion to only cook the lentils and then to add the other vegetables raw, I will try that or a variation of it next time.

More lemon!  More pepper!  Good basic flavors and an easy recipe make this great.  I liked it better after it had been in the refrigerator for a little while and the flavors had settled.

The first time, I made the recipe as written, and it was a 3 1/2.  But since then I've made it just cooking the lentils, and putting everything else in raw, and we're enjoying it much better!  It's nice served on a bed of lettuce.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  To make a larger batch, I cooked 1 cup of brown lentils for about 20 minutes before adding another cup of red lentils and the carrots.  I added a bit of extra sweet balsamic vinegar to the mix.  I'm definitely going to make this one again!  Great for summer and very filling on its own!

Nice texture, healthy enough but bland - I doubled the lemon juice and it just seemed to disappear and leave very little taste of flavour.

This is pretty good!  I recommend using Rice Wine Vinegar instead of lemon juice.  I also added a diced cucumber which made the salad even better!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic! I made this for dinner tonight and served it with toasted pita bread, olives and feta and a creamy cucumber salad and it was delicious. I stuck with 1 cup of lentils, though I used green since that's what I had on hand. I also added 3 tsp of cumin and about 2 heaping tsp of curry to the lentils and veggies as they cooked, and I loved the flavor. Didn't have any celery, so I skipped it. Between honey and me we almost finished all 8 servings! I will definitely make this again, only next time I'll probs double it so we'll have some leftovers!

this is a good salad but I mix balsamic vinigar and some garlic rice vinigar and 2tbsp. of sugar with the oil. this makes it really yummy. I love this recipe for a summer side dish.

This had a good flavor but I cooked my lentils for only 13 minutes and they turned to mush. I ended up serving the dish warm because of this. (I didn't think cold mushy lentils sounded too good). We liked it warm but I will make it again and only cook the lentils for about 10 minutes since 15-20 is way to long.

This recipe was perfect for a warm early summer evening. I substituted supermarket brown lentils, and only drizzled the finished salad with 2 TBS of Oil. We added some queso fresco (mexican fresh crumbling cheese) and this salad was amazing.

Also, leftovers are great for lunch the next day. It keeps very well in the fridge.

Such a wonderful quick and healthy recipe!

This is a nice and very easy recipe.  I couldn't wait for it to cool to eat it. The only variance I found with the original recipe is that it took my lentils 25 minutes to cook.  My friend, with whom I shared this dish, did not want the lentils to be the least little bit hard.

Made recipe as written. Wonderful! Even my 4 year old loved it. I had some feta cheese hanging around the fridge, so we added that just for fun. A nice touch, but not needed.

I have made this countless times now and shared the recipe with so many people.  I use a leek or two instead of the onion because my husband has onion sensitivities.  My toddler even eats this!  I have made it for several get-togethers, always a pleaser. In fact, I had it for lunch today.  Thanks!!

This was a good recipe.  We followed it except I added the celery a little before the end of the cooking time to make all the ingredients blend together. My husband enjoyed it and would like to make it again.  At the advice of another reviewer we added cumin and curry powder and may add a little more next time.  Overall, good recipe.

I love this!  The only changes I made were; I used chicken broth (no salt/msg & fat free) instead of water and added extra celery at the end.  The lentils took approximately 30 minutes to cook and I added extra broth 1/2 way through the cooking time.

We really liked this and even more the next day. I never would have thought the carrots would have cooked enough but they did. I might try using chicken broth instead of water next time. I'm willing to bet that basil would work very well in this also. Thanks jen. This is a keeper!

This is really good. You will likely feel the need for a little more acidity either through additional lemon juice or your favorite vinegar. I added red wine vinegar. I took the suggestions of others- cooking my lentils in chicken broth instead of water, adding cumin to the cooking lentils, keeping the vegetables raw and cutting back the onion to 1/2 cup. Note- As quickly as possible reduce the lentils to a medium simmer. Boiling or fast simmer causes the mushiness some of the other reviewers experienced. Also, one cup of lentils actually requires 2 cups liquid to cook.

I know this is a highly rated recipe but I just didn't care for it. I added extra lemon juice (after tasting it, of course) and it still tasted bland to me. I like lentils, but I won't be making this recipe again.

I personally have been disgusted by lentils for the longest time, (the way their texture mixes with their casings is not appetizing) but this was the best thing I have tasted with lentils. The texture and casings were still bothering me so I decided to make this into a dip/salsa by blending it in the food processor.

I did make a few changes, by adding the diced tomatoes and used light Italian dressing instead of oil, then experimented with Chipotle powder, cumin and paprika, to give it more flavor and added more salt and pepper (blending it beforehand seemed to muddle the flavors). It turns out to be a very refreshing dip!

This is my first time making a lentil salad.  I followed the recipe except I added 1/4 cup of fresh chopped mint.  It could use a little more lemon but that is up to a person's taste.
I will make this again - very good - thanks

I made this using all the ingredients as listed, but I didn't cook all the veggies with the lentils. I only cooked the garlic,half of the onion, bay leaf and thyme. The rest was raw, which I think is best for this salad. I tripled the fresh parsley because it needed it. It also needed a lot more lemon, so I added the juice of one whole lemon. I tried it at room temp and it was very good. I'm looking forward to trying it tomorrow once the flavors meld.

A great, easy recipe that doesn't require a bunch of meddling or corrections. The lemon gives it a nice kick, and the celery provides some nice crunch. Will try to serve it chilled next time. This would be a great dish for a picnic or entertaining because you can make it entirely in advance.

Oh, wow, this is good! I made it with lime juice and celery seed (instead of lemon and celery stalks). It was fantastic as is but I decided to double the parsley, and added a bit of green onion and a splash of red wine vinegar. Definitely will make again!

This turned out so delicious.  I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have any lemon so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  I used about 1/8-1/4 cup.  It worked out beautifully.  I put the lentil salad on top of spinach and romaine with cucumbers and red bell peppers.  It tastes great together.

Quite the delicious salad!  Perfect to make ahead for lunch. I divided the recipe into three portions (instead of 8 per the recipe) for an entree salad portion. I accidentally added 4x the parsley and doubled the celery, but love it that way!  Also, I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar - something that I do with hot lentil soup - and it adds a depth of flavor.

I like the simple ingredients which makes it easy to make but I found it a bit lacking in taste. I added a tablespoon of Dijon and that added just a touch of the right amount of spice.

This was quite tasty although our result required more vegetables. Next time we will add capsicum, corn and maybe some broccoli to jazz it up. Lovely dressing which suits lentils.

I made this as written minus parsley because I didn't have any. I expected it to be bland because of the reviews and the missing parsley. That was not the case!!! This tastes sooooo good! It's not bland at all and it didn't need extra dressing. The crunchiness of the celery made up for all the other veggies being cooked. I thought it was perfect. Wouldn't change a thing.

I hate dicing carrots, so just threw them into the pot in chunks, let them cook with the lentils and onions, then chopped before serving.  Much easier!!  Very nice salad/side dish, but I used only 1T of oil and that was plenty.  Perfect for a vegetarian lunch.

This did keep well and it was a great lunch salad. I did not have fresh parsley, red onion. This would have added the extra zing that would have bumped the rating to 4.5. Maybe cumin?

It smelled really good cooking, but it was really not that flavorful.  Also, I don't think it actually makes 8 servings.

Pretty good - definitely better the next day after marinating for a while.  I added about double the lemon juice, and would probably add a little more next time.

I made the recipe as stated, with the following exceptions:  1. I didn't have celery, so I didn't use that  2. Added about 2 TBSP of curry and 1TB or cumin to the lentils as they cooked. Added some more curry at the end to taste.    And it was awesome! I had a hard time waiting for it to cool before eating it.

We devoured this salad - even my picky father-in-law enjoyed it. Used vidalia onion instead of red, other than that followed the recipe and it was terrific. Nice healthy side dish!

Even my boyfriend, who doesn't particularly like lentils, loved this! I did leave out the carrots and used lime juice instead of lemon juice since I'm allergic to lemons.

I'm making this for the third time in two weeks. It's easy and my whole household enjoys it. I used green lentils instead of brown. Otherwise I followed the recipe. We don't like waiting for it to chill either so we tried it warm, liked it and decided that we can have it warm on the first day and if there are leftovers we'll have those chilled.

I added tomatoes which made the dish so much better....next time I may try it with cilantro and play around with seasonings. All around, I was pleased with the crisp and refreshing taste...perfect for a summer side dish!

Something I will fix again.  I used 2 cups beluga lentils instead of 1 cup brown, a healthy dose of italian seasoning instead of just thyme, plus some cumin and paprika.  I decided to cook the celery in with the lentils instead of adding them cold afterwards and I'm glad I did.  The vinaigrette is good, but once I mixed a little bit of lentils with it, I decided that I liked the lentils better without it.  But all is not lost!  I'll just use it for a salad.

This was great!!! I served this over short grain brown rice and it was a big hit. I've already sent the recipe around to friends and family.  
I made the following changes:
* I used 2 bay leaves.
* I used 1/2 cup parsley.
* I sprinkled salt, much less than 1 tsp.
* I drizzled a little olive oil instead of using 1/4 cup.

This was great.  The flavors really went together well.  Next time, I might add a bit more garlic, and I will dice the celery into slightly larger pieces, since the crunchiness adds a nice texture contrast.

I tried this recipe but didn’t cook my carrots. I diced them very small and added with other raw ingredients. Also added a touch of vinegar.

Easy recipe to vary. I add a touch more lemon juice and some vinegar for extra zest. One you make it a few times, you don't need the recipe, you can just play around with it. Add diced checking and a bed of lettuce, and bam, lunch. I've also added diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and eta cheese. This is a good dish to take to potlucks, travels well and you can make ahead of time. Is actually better after about 24 hours when the flavors have time to marry.

Excellent! Simmered 45 min. rather than 15–with lid on—and this ensured tenderness of the veggies.

I added extra spices to it & cooked the lentils in veggie broth instead of water. Turned out great.

What a fantastic easy salad. Even my picky son liked it. The only thing I did differently was the cooking method because my lentils were already cooked So I sauteed the onions/carrots/garlic . I also let the salad sit in the fridge for a few hours to blend the flavors.  Thank you!

Could use a bit more flavor, but it's pretty good! A good beginner recipe for those looking to cut back on meat consumption.  I will be making this again.

I used vegetable bouillon instead of bay leaf and thyme because I'm not a fan of bay leaf or thyme.  I used way too much and this was pretty salty, but that is not a fault of the recipe.  Like many reviewers, I cooked half the vegetables with the lentils and added the other half later.  I think this one will be part of my regular rotation....once I get the spices right.

This turned out great! I doctored the spicing a bit, and used whatever lentils we had in the house. The carrot was nice in this. Topped with fresh parsley and a little EVO. Kept overnight until our party and warmed a smidge before deployment. Yum!

I added zucchini, squash, red and yellow pepper, and radish. I added the zucchini and squash in with the lentils, but next time I will keep everything raw but the lentils and carrots. The dressing was bland so I added cumin, curry, and celery powder to taste. I'm not giving up on this recipe, but it needs changes in the future

I just made this and only ate a spoonful so far.  It is tasty, but most of all it is healthy.  The only change I made was to add the red onions AFTER cooking the lentils.  I wanted them crisp, for more of a salad texture.  The only complaint I have is that this recipe doesn't give the serving size - it only says it makes 8 servings.  Would it be too hard to include the serving size for those of us counting calories and carbs?

Pretty easy recipe. Tried it as is then freestyled :-) It's tasty as it is (great side dish) but it also lends itself well to variations. I doubled the carrots which I added in the last 5mins of lentil cook time (13-15 mins or else it'll go too mushy). Doubled the celery as well. I added corn kernels and toasted pumpkin seeds to add texture. I add chopped cucumber (no seeds) just before eating. Used a roasted sesame and paprika salt blend. Best part is it's filling and keeps well.

I changed it up since i didn't have thyme or bay leaves I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a tsp of curry and 3 tsp of cumin while cooking the lentils. Once cooked, I drizzled with balsamic vinegar. It was delicious.

Delicious and filling lunch salad. Followed the recipe to a T.  I liked how the onion was cooked rather than raw. Easy to make. I added a bit of feta to my leftovers.

Makes a good base recipe, although it needs some extra seasonings. I've made it several times, but typically I double the celery, onion , and garlic. I prefer lime juice over lemon juice. I also increase the parsley, and have added in fresh thyme and spearmint as well.

Yum! I made as written, except for adding 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp curry powder to the lentils, and I didn't have celery so left it out. Served over a bed of romaine lettuce it makes a perfect lunch!

Delicious! I have made this several times now, and added cumin as per another reviewer's suggestion. I tried it also with curry added, but like it best with cumin only. (And I am a curry fan). One caveat: I have found the lentils need to cook longer than 15-20 minutes. For me, 30-35 minutes works best. Thank you for a super recipe!

Made it.  Ate it.  I liked it.   First time I made it, I followed the recipe.  The next times, I  cooked the lentils without the vegetables - added them later.   Also, I added the other ingredients to warm lentils.  Did not wait for them to cool.

Simple, delicious and healthy. I followed the recipe as is but I cooked the lentils for 25 minutes cause I like them a bit more tender. Enjoy having it for lunch with a sandwich at work.

My husband, mother and I all loved it!  I will definitely make this again.  Very satisfying and healthy.  Instead of 2 T. of lemon juice, I used 1 tablespoon of  lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  I think balsamic mellows out the acid a Iittle.  I didn't have celery, so I didn't add any.  Didn't really miss it.  If I had it, I would have put it in.  I think I may add diced red pepper next time, or even cucumber or diced avocado.  I absolutely love this recipe!

I changed a lot for the recipe based on other reviews. For the vegetables I only cooked about half and left the other half raw, soaking in lemon juice and salt while the lentils cooked. I also added orange and yellow bell peppers and half a habanero pepper. It wasn't too spicy but had just enough kick. Finally, in addition to the parsley, i also chopped up the celery leaves and threw it in with one tomato. I just made it for a potlock and got so many compliments.

This was just okay for me, but I'm rating four stars, instead of three, as part of the reason I wasn't crazy about this is just personal preference:  too many lentils = ) ...yes, I get the irony...a lentil salad with too many lentils.  I choose this salad as a change from bean salads because of the nutritional values (protein; fiber; ETC). Next time I would use half as many lentils, and add more flavor to the dressing.  I actually removed a bunch of lentils from the salad and froze them to use in another batch later. I love carrots...so I will likely end up making a carrot salad with lentils!!!

This "Mediterranean Lentil Salad" has a wonderful tangy lemon-thyme dressing, and the perfect texture (firm lentils, crunchy celery, soft carrots and onions). I enjoyed eating it warm, and couldn't stop eating it! I love vegetarian food! I had presoaked my lentils overnight for digestion and rinsed them well before cooking as I usually do. I was concerned that the lentils might cook too quickly for the carrots to be done but there was no issue. I know that there are several types of brown lentils on the market, and I guess I am using the more firm ones. Thank you Jen for sharing your recipe.

I must have over cooked the lentils because the salad was mushy for me too.  It also wasn't flavorful enough for our taste.  We improved it by adding apple cider vinegar like previous comments suggested.  I think next time I will try it with all raw veges and serve it cold.

My husband and I paired this with a fish dish - we thought the lemon in the 'dressing' would go nicely.  Although the flavors tasted fine, I really didn't enjoy this recipe and neither did my husband.  Something was missing and something else was overpowering....Not sure.  Will not make again.

I just don't think the flavors meshed very well. I wonder if it would be better without the celery....

This was a pretty tasty salad. I liked the combination of flavors, but it wasn't quite flavorful enough. I liked the crunch that the celery gave to the salad; I also liked that the other vegetables were cooked with the lentils and spices for more flavor. Although this salad is a little bland, it is very healthy, so thanks for sharing!

I liked this quite a bit. I usually like spicy food on a regular basis and this was a good change. It is simple flavors yet tasty.  I made it twice before and the second time I think the lentils were overcooked so it was not that great but the first time was perfect. I used red lentils. I like the celery added at the end after the lentils are cooked bc it adds a contrasting crunch to the rest.  If you like super spice dishes this is not for you. It is simple yet flavorful in my opinion. It's a keeper for me.

This was really good, I didn't have any fresh parsley so I substituted dried.  My kids who normally like vegetables didn't care for it, but I will definitely make it again anyway.

When cleaning out cupboards I found way too many lentils and needed a warm weather use for them. I made the recipe just the way it is written. At first my family laughed at me for making lentil salad, but they ate it!

Forgot how good lentils are mixed in a salad. I served mine over cooked rice.

For meat-eaters, you can add a pound of cooked ground beef.  But this recipe is amazing just as it is.
